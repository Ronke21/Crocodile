<text>A sporophyte () is the diploid multicellular stage in the life cycle of a plant or alga which produces asexual spores. This stage alternates with a multicellular haploid gametophyte phase.

== Life cycle ==

The sporophyte develops from the zygote produced when a haploid egg cell is fertilized by a haploid sperm and each sporophyte cell therefore has a double set of chromosomes, one set from each parent. All land plants, and most multicellular algae, have life cycles in which a multicellular diploid sporophyte phase alternates with a multicellular haploid gametophyte phase. In the seed plants, the largest groups of which are the gymnosperms and flowering plants (angiosperms), the sporophyte phase is more prominent than the gametophyte, and is the familiar green plant with its roots, stem, leaves and cones or flowers. In flowering plants, the gametophytes are very reduced in size, and are represented by the germinated pollen and the embryo sac.

The sporophyte produces spores (hence the name) by meiosis, a process also known as &quot;reduction division&quot; that reduces the number of chromosomes in each spore mother cell by half. The resulting meiospores develop into a gametophyte. Both the spores and the resulting gametophyte are haploid, meaning they only have one set of chromosomes. Meiosis in the diploid sporophyte provides a direct DNA repair capability for dealing with DNA damages, including oxidative DNA damages, in germline reproductive tissues. 

The mature gametophyte produces male or female gametes (or both) by mitosis. The fusion of male and female gametes produces a diploid zygote which develops into a new sporophyte. This cycle is known as alternation of generations or alternation of phases.

== Examples ==


Bryophytes (mosses, liverworts and hornworts) have a dominant gametophyte phase on which the adult sporophyte is dependent for nutrition. The embryo sporophyte develops by cell division of the zygote within the female sex organ or archegonium, and in its early development is therefore nurtured by the gametophyte.
Because this embryo-nurturing feature of the life cycle is common to all land plants they are known collectively as the embryophytes.

Most algae have dominant gametophyte generations, but in some species the gametophytes and sporophytes are morphologically similar (isomorphic). An independent sporophyte is the dominant form in all clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms that have survived to the present day. Early land plants had sporophytes that produced identical spores (isosporous or homosporous) but the ancestors of the gymnosperms evolved complex heterosporous life cycles in which the spores producing male and female gametophytes were of different sizes, the female megaspores tending to be larger, and fewer in number, than the male microspores.

== Evolutionary history ==
During the Devonian period several plant groups independently evolved heterospory and subsequently the habit of endospory, in which the gametophytes develop in miniaturized form inside the spore wall. By contrast in exosporous plants, including modern ferns, the gametophytes break the spore wall open on germination and develop outside it. The megagametophytes of endosporic plants such as the seed ferns developed within the sporangia of the parent sporophyte, producing a miniature multicellular female gametophyte complete with female sex organs, or archegonia. The oocytes were fertilized in the archegonia by free-swimming flagellate sperm produced by windborne miniaturized male gametophytes in the form of pre-pollen. The resulting zygote developed into the next sporophyte generation while still retained within the pre-ovule, the single large female meiospore or megaspore contained in the modified sporangium or nucellus of the parent sporophyte. The evolution of heterospory and endospory were among the earliest steps in the evolution of seeds of the kind produced by gymnosperms and angiosperms today. The rRNA genes seems to escape global methylation machinery in bryophytes, unlike seed plants.

<doc id="413341" wikidata="Q3533983" url="?curid=413341" title="Tourism in the Maldives">
<text>Tourism is the largest economic industry in the Maldives, as it plays an important role in earning foreign exchange revenues and employing 25,000 people in the tertiary sector of the country. The archipelago of the Maldives is the main source of attraction to many tourists visiting the island country. Entrepreneurs have been swiftly amassing assets connected to the tourism sector in the Maldives. Given that tourism is the primary economic driver in the Maldives, this trend is affording the substantial influence over the nation&#x27;s economy.

The tourism industry is especially vulnerable to climate change: as one of the island nations expected to be most impacted by climate change, sea level rise and subsequent increased extreme weather, coastal flooding, and coral bleaching damage the natural attractions that bring many of the tourists to the country.

== History ==

President Ibrahim Nasir is credited for having started tourism in the Maldives in 1972 in order to diversify the economy and help in his vision of modernizing the Maldives. A United Nations mission on development which visited the Maldives Islands in the 1960s did not recommend tourism, claiming that the islands were not suitable. Ever since the launch of the first resort in Maldives in 1972, however, tourism in Maldives has flourished. The arrival of the first tourist&#x27;s group is estimated to have occurred in February 1972. Tourism in Maldives started with just two resorts with a capacity of about 280 beds. Kurumba Island Resort is the first resort opened in Maldives, followed by Bandos Island Resort which was developed and opened by Ibrahim Nasir, Nasir also personally set up the first tourist agency known as &quot;Crescent Tourist Agency&quot;. At present, there are over 132 resorts located in the different atolls constituting the Republic of Maldives. Over the decades, the number of tourists in Maldives is rising continuously. In 2009, local island guesthouses started popping up in the Maldives. This was thanks to a change in regulations that began to officially allow tourists to stay among the local population, rather than just on privately owned resort islands. In 2015, a total of 1.2 million tourists visited the Maldives, and another 1.5 million visited in 2016.

In 2018, the Maldives operated 130 island-resorts. Current work is being undertaken to boost tourism room capacity by constructing another 23 properties, which will include foreign developers such as the Waldorf Astoria, Mövenpick, Pullman and the Hard Rock Café Hotel. Extensive upgrades at the Velana International Airport will allow for 7.5 million visitors by early 2019 or 2020.

== Level of tourism development ==
Tourism in the Maldives has started in 1972 with only two hotels, now – there are more than 100 operational resorts. The unique condition of Maldives is that one island is one resort, meaning that one hotel occupies the whole island. By doing so, resorts provide more privacy and more luxury for their visitors. The Maldives are also trying to stay eco-friendly and use more of solar energy rather than diesel. The Maldives provide facilities and services, entertainment and telecommunication services, they also provide numerous resorts, hotels, guest houses, and liveboards.

=== Overview of a typical tropical resort ===

A tourist resort in the Maldives typically consists of a hotel on its own island, with its population entirely made up of tourists and work force, with no local people or houses. China has established a presence in nearly every facet of the Maldivian government, tourism industry, and economy, spanning both the private and public sectors.

=== Arrivals by country ===
Most visitors arriving to the Maldives on short term basis, were from the following countries of nationality:


== Climate change ==

The Maldives&#x27; economy is greatly influenced by any climate changes. Tourism sector can be damaged by the increased likelihood of violent storms, damage to coral reefs, and beach erosion, which are now more likely to happen because of the rising seas.

As a consequence of climate change, Maldives is now facing the problem of rising seas and coral reefs bleaching. According to the World Bank, with &quot;future sea levels projected to increase in the range of 10 to 100 centimeters by the year 2100, the entire country could be submerged.&quot; New government has made a decision to fight the rising seas problem with geoengineering projects instead of trying to move the population. The idea is to rent out other islands and even build new islands, so the population of those islands who are more in trouble could be relocated. One of those built islands is Hulhumale&#x27;.

It has been also pointed out that some islands can grow naturally.

World Bank states that, &quot;Rising sea temperatures also threaten the coral reefs and cause bleaching and death, with the most severe damage in areas that are stressed by pollutants, or damaged by physical disturbance. Vulnerability to climate change hazards has been magnified by damage to coral reefs which has in turn impaired their protective function, thus a negative cycle of impact.&quot;

==Health concerns==
On 24 May 2021, Maldives had the world&#x27;s fastest-growing COVID-19 outbreak, with the highest number of infections per thousand people over the prior 7 and 14 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Doctors warned that increasing demand for COVID-19 care could hinder their ability to handle other health emergencies in the Maldives.

== Environmental concerns ==
=== Ecotourism ===

There is some promotion of ecotourism in the Maldives, with resorts emphasizing recycling of heat that is wasted in producing electricity and stricter policies of waste disposal. 

Nevertheless, the Maldives have frequently come under criticism for their lack of protection of the local shark populations, which have sharply decreased after being hunted extensively for decades. In some areas, sharks have entirely disappeared. Sharks are hunted primarily for their fins. Shark fins are exported from the Maldives to other countries in Asia, where they are regarded as a delicacy. The fins are amputated from the live animals, which are then thrown back alive into the sea. Although this practice is prohibited by law in the Maldives, these laws are not respected or enforced by the local authorities.

In 2001, a local environmental organization called &quot;Seamarc/Marine savers&quot; (known onsite as &quot;Reefscapers&quot;), set up an ambitious program of reimplantation of coral in damaged areas, on the basis of resort sponsorship. 

=== Natural environment === 

The Maldives&#x27; tourism industry is the country&#x27;s largest revenue generator. Due to their underwater scenery and clean water, the Maldives is ranked among the best recreational diving destinations of the world, with over 60 local dive sites across the islands. It was also reported to be the world&#x27;s most desired honeymoon destination, according to a global survey by Agoda.com.

== Safety concerns ==
The level of crime in the Maldives is high and not safe for women . Knife crime in populated areas, like the capital Male, has increased. Tourists should also follow local advice on if there is any danger with swimming. Some piracy and armed robbery attacks have also occurred in the area of Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa. A threat of terrorism is possible; the targets can include: government buildings, schools, places of worship, airports, public places, etc.

On 5 February 2018, the government declared a state of emergency due to the increased protests and aggressive clashes with the police in Malé. Those demonstrations are advised to be avoided.

On 18 June 2023, a Chinese national took to Twitter to share a harrowing incident she encountered during her stay at Maldives’ luxurious Ritz-Carlton resort. In her long Twitter thread, the 26-year-old Chinese tourist accused a resort staff named Usham of sexual assault. She also accused the resort management and the Maldivian police of hushing the matter and taking no coercive steps to investigate her case. The victim, a Chinese national currently pursuing her studies in Australia, in a long Twitter thread wrote that she had reached Maldives on the 6th of June and was scheduled to return to China on the 10th but she decided to extend her stay and checked into the Ritz Carlton Fari Island resort, unaware of the horror that would befall her. Ritz-Carlton Fari Island Resort, owned by The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company and a subsidiary of Marriott International, high-end resort known for its pristine beaches and world-class hospitality.

<doc id="413348" wikidata="Q7170951" url="?curid=413348" title="Singapore Malay National Organisation">
<text>The Singapore Malay National Organisation (Malay: &quot;Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura&quot;; abbrev: PKMS) is a political party in Singapore.

==History==
The origins of Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura (PKMS) were rooted in the Singapore Malay Union (KMS), which was founded in 1926 by Mohamed Eunos bin Abdullah to represent Malay interests. Following the Second World War, the KMS opposed the proposed Malayan Union and merged into the United Malay National Organisation (UMNO), which would become dominant in federal politics.

Despite the KMS&#x27;s connections to UMNO, the modern PKMS originated as an extension of the Johor Bahru branch of UMNO. It contested the 1955 Singapore general election and secured one seat at Ulu Bedok. By the 1959 Singapore general election, UMNO had gained three seats in the Malay-dominated electorates of Geylang Serai, Kampung Kembangan, and the Southern Islands. On 20 February 1961, it became officially registered as the Singapore United Malay National Organisation (SUMNO).

SUMNO subsequently joined the Singapore Alliance Party, which also was an extension of the larger federal Alliance Party and encompassed the Singapore Malay Union along with local branches of the Malayan Chinese Association and the Malayan Indian Congress, and former Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock&#x27;s Singapore People&#x27;s Alliance. In line with the pro-Malay communal policies of its parent organisation, PKMS became a vocal opponent of Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s People&#x27;s Action Party, which it accused of promoting Chinese chauvinism and discriminating against Malays. However, it also shared some of the PAP&#x27;s policies, such as supporting merger with Malaysia and anti-Communism.

Under the Singapore Alliance umbrella, SUMNO contested the 1963 general election but performed poorly and lost all its three seats. In total, the Alliance lost all its seven seats. The fallout from this electoral defeat contributed to sharply deteriorating relations between the federal government in Kuala Lumpur and the Singapore state government which culminated in the 1964 race riots that ultimately resulted in Singapore&#x27;s expulsion from Malaysia in September 1965.

On 19 March 1967, the party assumed its current name, Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura, after the Singapore government passed a new law banning local parties from operating as branches of foreign organisations. However, PKMS continued to maintain ties with its parent organisation, UMNO. During the 1968 general election, the PKMS did not file any nominations and supported Barisan Sosialis&#x27;s electoral boycott of the Singapore Parliament. While the PKMS would contest future elections, it has never won a seat since 1959.

On 3 July 2001, the PKMS joined a political coalition known as the Singapore Democratic Alliance, which included the Singapore Justice Party, Singapore People&#x27;s Party, the Singapore National Front and the National Solidarity Party. Throughout its history, the party has experienced substantial internal infighting. However, it all ended with a court order on 22 March 2012 which gave Abu Mohamed and the Supreme Council the rights to administer the office.

<text>Thomas Schippers (9 March 1930 – 16 December 1977) was an American conductor. He was highly regarded for his work in opera.

==Biography==
Of Dutch ancestry and son of the owner of a large appliance store, Schippers was born in Portage, Michigan. He began playing piano at age four. After graduating from high school at age 13, he attended the Curtis Institute and the Juilliard School.

Schippers made his debut at the New York City Opera at age twenty-one, and the Metropolitan Opera at twenty-five. He conducted world premieres of now well-known music by Gian Carlo Menotti and Samuel Barber. He conducted child actor Chet Allen in a theatrical version of Menotti&#x27;s &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot;. Schippers conducted in all the major opera houses of the United States and Europe, most notably the Metropolitan Opera and La Scala, and founded Italy&#x27;s Spoleto festival with Menotti and once described his perfect orchestra as being composed of &quot;one-third Italian musicians for their line, one-third Jewish for their sound, a sprinkling of Germans for solidity&quot;.

Schippers was a regular conductor with the New York Philharmonic and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and made recordings with them as well, but in 1970 he finally took a full-time orchestral position with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, succeeding his predecessor at the Metropolitan Opera, Max Rudolf. After making several recordings with them and building the orchestra&#x27;s international reputation, his career was cut short by his death from lung cancer at 47 in 1977 in New York City, New York.

During the 1970s, he was appointed principal conductor of l&#x27;Orchestra dell&#x27;Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia but conducted only one concert with the orchestra (in May 1976, including Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Ma Mère l&#x27;Oye&quot; suite). He made many opera recordings in his time, and live recordings of his performances are gradually being made available on CD. His 1971 studio recording of &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; by Gaetano Donizetti with Beverly Sills and Carlo Bergonzi was the first recording in which the glass harmonica was used in the mad scene. In 1974, he recorded, for EMI, &quot;The Siege of Corinth&quot;, with Sills, Shirley Verrett, Justino Díaz, and Harry Theyard. His 1964 recording (Decca) of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; with the Santa Cecilia Orchestra was noted for his dramatic approach.

He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.

==Personal life==
Though reputed to be homosexual, Schippers married Elaine Lane &quot;Nonie&quot; Phipps (1939–1973) in 1965. An heiress to the Grace shipping fortune and a daughter of the noted American polo player Michael Grace Phipps, she died of ovarian cancer in 1973. Schippers died of lung cancer four years later.

According to professor, writer and opera scholar John Louis DiGaetani, Schippers had a long-term romantic relationship with Menotti and a shorter one with mathematician Sean Clarke. One of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s biographers claims that Schippers and Bernstein were also intimately involved.

<text>Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 2nd Earl of Minto, (; 16 November 178231 July 1859), styled as Viscount Melgund between 1813 and 1814, was a British diplomat and Whig politician.

==Background and education==
Minto was the eldest son of the Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto, and Anna Maria, daughter of Sir George Amyand, 1st Baronet. He was educated at Eton, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge and University of Edinburgh.

==Diplomatic and political career==
Minto was returned to Parliament for Ashburton in Devon in 1806, a seat he held until 1807, and then represented Roxburghshire between 1812 and 1814. He took a dim view of the Prince Regent and his government. The latter year he succeeded his father in the earldom and took his seat in the House of Lords. He was admitted to Privy Council in 1832.

From 1832 to 1834 he was Minister to Prussia. In 1835 he was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty under Lord Melbourne, a post he held until 1841, and later served as Lord Privy Seal under Lord John Russell from 1846 to 1852. In his youth, Elliot had gone to Corsica where his father was viceroy and he developed an abiding affection for Italy. He served as special envoy to Switzerland, Sardinia, Tuscany, Rome, Sicily in 1847–8. His influence in the Whig party was partly because his daughter, Lady Frances, was the wife of Lord John Russell.

==Family==
Lord Minto married Mary, daughter of Patrick Brydone, in 1806. They had at least five sons and five daughters. Lady Minto died in July 1853. Lord Minto survived her by six years and died in July 1859, aged 75. He was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, William.

<doc id="413353" wikidata="Q5624210" url="?curid=413353" title="Lorenzo Dow">
<text>Lorenzo Dow (October 16, 1777February 2, 1834) was an eccentric itinerant American evangelist, said to have preached to more people than any other preacher of his era. He became an important figure and a popular writer. His autobiography at one time was the second best-selling book in the United States, exceeded only by the Bible.

==Early life==
Born at Coventry, Connecticut, to Humphrey Dow and Tabitha Parker Dow, Dow was a sickly child and was much troubled in his youth by &quot;religious speculations&quot;, but ultimately joined the Methodist faith. In 1796 he made an unsuccessful application for admission into the Connecticut conference; but two years later he was received, and in 1798—despite the objections of his family—was appointed to be a circuit preacher, on a probationary basis, to the Cambridge circuit in New York. During the year he was transferred to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and afterward to Essex, Vermont, but remained there only a brief time.

==Missionary travels==
Dow made three visits to Ireland and England, in 1799, 1805 and 1818, and by his eccentric manners and attractive eloquence drew after him immense crowds. He took what he believed to be a divine call and crossed the Atlantic Ocean to preach as a missionary to the Catholics of Ireland, and thereafter was never connected officially with the ministry of the Methodist Church, though he remained essentially a Methodist in doctrine. He introduced camp meetings into England, and the controversy about them resulted in the organization of the Primitive Methodist Society.

In 1802, he preached in the Albany region of New York, against atheism, deism, Calvinism, and Universalism. He passed the years 1803 and 1804 in what was then the Mississippi Territory (present day states of Mississippi and Alabama), delivering the first Protestant sermon within the bounds of those future states. Just south of Mansfield, Georgia, on State Route 11, is a large rock on which is a plaque, placed by the Daughters of the American Revolution. It states that on that rock, in 1803, Dow preached the first &quot;Gospel sermon&quot; in Jasper County. In 1807 he extended his labors into Louisiana Territory.

Dow&#x27;s enthusiasm sustained him through the incessant labors of more than 30 years, during which he preached in almost all parts of the United States. His later efforts were directed chiefly against the Jesuits; indeed he was in general a vigorous opponent of Catholicism.

Everywhere, in America and Britain, he attracted great crowds to hear and see him, and he was often persecuted as well as admired. Because the churches were closed to him, Lorenzo Dow preached in town halls, farmers&#x27; barns, and even in open fields. He would preach anyplace where he could assemble a crowd. He preached to Methodists, Baptists, Quakers, Catholics, and atheists alike. He liked to appear unexpectedly at public events, announcing in a loud voice that exactly one year from today, Lorenzo Dow would preach on this spot. He never disappointed his audiences; he always appeared exactly 365 days later at the appointed place, usually met by huge crowds.

Dow&#x27;s public speaking mannerisms were like nothing ever seen before among the typically conservative church goers of the time. He shouted, he screamed, he cried, he begged, he flattered, he insulted, he challenged people and their beliefs. He told stories and made jokes. It is recorded that Lorenzo Dow often preached before open-air assemblies of 10,000 people or more and held the audiences spellbound.

==Traveling preacher==
Dow&#x27;s fame spread, and so did his travels. He traveled on foot and occasionally on horseback (when someone would donate a horse) sometimes accompanied by his wife, Peggy Dow throughout what was then the United States. His journeys took him to Canada, England and Ireland, and once to the West Indies. He was usually well-received although there were exceptions. A fierce abolitionist, Dow&#x27;s sermons were often unpopular in the southern United States, and he frequently was threatened with personal violence. He sometimes was forcibly ejected from towns, pelted with stones, eggs, and rotten vegetables as it happened in Jacksonborough, Georgia around 1820. That never stopped him; he simply walked to the next town and gave the same sermon again.

Lorenzo Dow was personally unkempt. He did not practice personal hygiene and his long hair and beard were described as &quot;never having met a comb&quot;. He usually owned one set of clothes: those that were on his back. When those clothes became so badly worn and full of holes that they were no longer capable of covering him, some person in the audience usually would donate a replacement. The donated clothes often were not the correct size for his skinny body. When he traveled, he carried no luggage other than a box of Bibles to be given away. Throughout most of his life, what little money he ever collected was either given away to the poor or used to purchase Bibles. In his later years, he did accumulate a bit of money from the sales of his autobiography and religious writings. His singularities of manner and of dress excited prejudices against him, and counteracted the effect of his eloquence. Nevertheless, he is said to have preached to more persons than any man of his time.

He died in Georgetown, Washington, DC, in 1834, at the age of 56, after an illness. During his final illness he was cared for by his friend, George Haller. Before he died, he asked that his old greatcoat be used as his winding sheet. He was placed to rest at Holmead&#x27;s Burying Ground. A headstone with an epitaph that he personally selected was placed on his grave:

In 1887, when old Holmead&#x27;s cemetery was about to be abolished, William Wilson Corcoran donated money and Dow was disinterred and moved to Oak Hill Cemetery, near Georgetown.

==Remembrance==
His influence and popularity during his life led to many children of the early 19th century, especially on the American frontier, to be named after him. In the 1818 Washington almanac, there is a humorous anecdote about Lorenzo Dow saving a woman&#x27;s infidelity by pretending to raise the devil (the woman&#x27;s paramour, who was hiding in a barrel, which Dow set on fire). His autobiography became a bestseller and the 1850 U.S. Census counts Lorenzo as one of the most popular first names in America.

==Family==
His wife, Peggy Dow (1780–1820), was almost as eccentric as her husband. She published her journal, entitled &quot;Vicissitudes in the Wilderness&quot; (1833).

<doc id="413355" wikidata="Q1424844" url="?curid=413355" title="Battle of Delium">
<text>The Battle of Delium (or Delion, a city in Boeotia) took place in 424 BC, during the Peloponnesian War. It was fought between the Athenians and the Boeotians, who were allies of the Spartans, and ended with the siege of Delium in the following weeks.

==Prelude==
In 424 BC, the Athenian generals Demosthenes and Hippocrates planned to invade Boeotia. Demosthenes mistakenly sailed too early and landed at Siphae, where his plans were betrayed by a Phocian named Nicomachus. As Hippocrates had not yet arrived, Demosthenes could not attack and was forced to withdraw.

Eventually, Hippocrates arrived in Boeotia with 7,000 Athenian hoplites and 1,000 cavalry, they were accompanied by 10,000 Metics and other non-citizens, and began to fortify the temple at Delium. After five days, the fortifications were complete, and Hippocrates set up a garrison and sent the rest of his army back to Athens. At the same time, the Boeotians gathered their army to challenge Hippocrates, but when they saw that the Athenians were leaving, many of them thought that it was pointless to attack. Pagondas of Thebes, the commander of the Boeotian forces, urged them to attack anyway because he knew that the Athenians would eventually return and use Delium as a base for further invasions.

==Battle==

Pagondas moved his army into position near the Athenians although both armies were hidden from each other by a hill. The Boeotians had 7,000 hoplites, 1,000 cavalry, 500 peltasts and 10,000 light troops. The right wing was formed by troops from Thebes, and the Thebans drew themselves up to a depth of 25 men, rather than the usual 8; the centre by men from Haliartus, Coronea, and Copiae; and the left wing by troops from Thespiae, Tanagra, and Orchomenus. They were later joined by the Locrians. When Hippocrates learned of the Boeotian army, he joined the main Athenian force, leaving 300 cavalry behind at Delium. The Athenians had about the same numbers of hoplites and cavalry, but had fewer lightly armed troops, mostly from their allied cities. They lined up at the usual depth. Because of the asymmetry in deployment, the Theban right wing would almost certainly be victorious but also because of their deployment the Athenian hoplite line was longer and would outflank the Boeotian left line. That unique deployment by the Theban general Pagondas explains the subsequent unfolding and progress of the battle.

The Boeotians charged unexpectedly while Hippocrates was giving a speech to his men. The centre lines saw the heaviest fighting. As Thucydides reports, the Boeotian left wing was surrounded and close to defeat, and only the Thespian contingent stood its ground. The victorious Athenian line got into confusion as it circled round the Thespian contingent and surrounded it. Some of the Athenian hoplites fought and killed one another when they met at the other end, mistaking their countrymen for the enemy. That was history&#x27;s first documented incident of &quot;friendly fire&quot;. It is thought the incident occurred in part because no &quot;state&quot; shield devices were in use, which did not seem to have become general until the Second Battle of Mantinea, fought in 362 BC between the Thebans and the Spartans (and each side&#x27;s allies) . In any case, Pagondas sent his cavalry to support the Boeotian left wing and the Athenians were defeated in turn. Meanwhile, the Boeotian right wing was also victorious, and the Athenians fighting there fled. When the Athenian centre saw that its two wings had been defeated, it also fled. About 500 Boeotians and 1,000 Athenians had been killed, including Hippocrates.

One of the Athenian hoplites in the battle was the philosopher Socrates. Plato has Alcibiades give the following account of the retreat of the Athenians at Delium, and Socrates&#x27; own actions then: 
The Boeotians chased the Athenians until nightfall. Most of the Athenians returned to the fort at Delium, where a Boeotian herald announced that they were offending land that was sacred to the Boeotians and must leave. The Athenians replied that the land was now theirs and was now sacred to them and that they held it in self-defense from the Boeotians.

==Aftermath==
For two weeks, there was no action, but the Boeotians were joined by 2,000 hoplites from Corinth, as well as other troops from their various allies. The Boeotians constructed a strange device, which, according to the description in Thucydides (4.100), seems to have been a kind of flamethrower and used the weapon to set fire to Delium and chase away the Athenians. Only about 200 Athenians were killed; the rest were allowed to escape. After Delium had been recaptured, Demosthenes and his forces finally arrived, but the lack of communication between him and Hippocrates meant that his arrival was essentially useless. He landed near Sicyon but was quickly defeated.

In addition to showing an innovative use of a new technology, Pagondas made use of planned tactical warfare for one of the first times in recorded history. In the previous centuries, battles between Greek city-states had been relatively simple encounters between massed formations of hoplites. Cavalry played no important role, and all depended on the unity and force of the massed ranks of the infantry, straining against the opponent. At Delium, Pagondas made use of deeper ranks, reserves, cavalry interventions, light-armed skirmishers (peltasts) and gradual changes in tactics during the battle.

<text>The hasapiko (, , meaning “the butcher&#x27;s [dance]”) is a Greek folk dance from Constantinople. The dance originated in the Middle Ages as a battle mime with swords performed by the Greek butchers&#x27; guild, which adopted it from the military of the Byzantine era. In Constantinople during the Byzantine times, it was called in Greek μακελλάρικος χορός (&quot;makellárikos horós, &quot;&quot;butcher&#x27;s dance&quot;, from μακελλάριος “butcher”). Some Greeks, however, reserve the latter term only for the fast version of the dance.

The slow version of the dance is called χασάπικο βαρύ / χασάπικος βαρύς (&quot;hasapiko vary &quot;or &quot;hasapikos varys, &quot;&quot;heavy &quot;hasapiko&quot;&quot;) and generally employs a meter. The fast version of the dance uses a meter. It is variously called γρήγορο χασάπικο (&quot;grigoro hasapiko&quot;, &quot;&quot;fast&quot; &quot;hasapiko&quot;&quot;) or χασαποσέρβικο (&quot;hasaposerviko&quot;), the last two terms in reference to Serbian and other Balkan influences on this version of the dance. The fast version is also called μακελλάριος χορός (&quot;makellarios horos)&quot;, 

Sirtaki, the modern staple Greek dance, is a relatively new, choreographed dance, based on hasapiko.

<doc id="413358" wikidata="Q272041" url="?curid=413358" title="Stephen Twigg">
<text>Stephen Daniel Twigg (born 25 December 1966) is a British Labour Co-op politician who has served as the 8th Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association since August 2020. He served as Member of Parliament for Enfield Southgate from 1997 to 2005, and for Liverpool West Derby from 2010 to 2019.

He came to national prominence in 1997 by winning the seat of Defence Secretary Michael Portillo. Twigg was made the Minister of State for School Standards in 2004, a job he held until he lost his seat in 2005. He returned to parliament in 2010, after he was elected Member of Parliament for Liverpool West Derby when longtime MP Bob Wareing retired.

Following Ed Miliband&#x27;s election to the Labour leadership, he made Twigg a Shadow Foreign Office Minister. In his October 2011 reshuffle, Miliband promoted Twigg to the post of Shadow Secretary of State for Education. However, on 7 October 2013 he was replaced in the reshuffle.

==Early life==
He was born on Christmas Day 1966 in Enfield, London. Twigg was educated at Grange Park Primary School and Southgate School, a local comprehensive school, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics, and economics.
He became the youngest and first openly gay president of the National Union of Students in 1990, representing the National Organisation of Labour Students (NOLS). He was re-elected in 1991.

On leaving the NUS, he was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Islington at a 1992 by-election, representing the Sussex ward until 1997, when he stood down following his election to parliament. During his tenure on the council, he became Chief Whip, and briefly Deputy Leader. Twigg&#x27;s ward colleagues were both fellow future Labour MPs: Margaret Hodge and Meg Hillier. He also worked for the UK section of Amnesty International and then for the National Council for Voluntary Organisations.

==Political career==
===MP for Enfield Southgate (1997–2005)===
In the 1997 election, he was elected to Parliament for Enfield Southgate, the constituency in which he had been born and raised, with a majority of 1,433. There had been a large 17.4% swing to him from his Conservative opponent, Michael Portillo. Portillo, a cabinet minister, had been widely tipped to be the next Tory leader, and the loss of his seat was one of the most unexpected results of the election.

A book about the election by Brian Cathcart was titled &quot;Were You Still Up for Portillo?&quot; In the Royal Festival Hall in London, the scene of the Labour party celebrations that evening, the result elicited a massive cheer, as Portillo was widely loathed among Labour supporters. Twigg was forced to give up his role as general secretary of the Fabian Society following this unexpected victory in what had been regarded as a safe Conservative seat. It was also unusual to have an openly gay British MP at that time.

In the 2001 election, Twigg held the seat with an increased majority of 5,546 over Conservative John Flack. Following the 2001 election, Twigg was appointed Parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the House of Commons, Robin Cook, and in 2002 became a junior minister in the Department for Education and Skills, from where he led the London Challenge initiative. In 2004, in the government changes following the resignation of David Blunkett, he was promoted to Minister of State for school standards.

Whilst an MP he served as chairman of two all-party parliamentary groups on epilepsy and youth issues. He is a former chairman of Labour Friends of Israel.

In the 2005 election, Twigg lost his seat to the Conservative Party candidate, David Burrowes, by a margin of 1,747 votes (a swing of 8.7%). During his concession speech, Twigg claimed that he would not be the last Labour MP for Enfield Southgate. He was proved correct in 2017, with the election of Bambos Charalambous, the Labour candidate, on 8 June that year.

===Non-parliamentary career (2005–2010)===
On 12 December 2005, Twigg was arrested in central London for being drunk and incapable in a public place and taken to Marylebone police station. He paid a £50 fixed penalty notice. Twigg commented &quot;I had had a lot to drink and I think it [the police action] was sensible. I have no complaints whatsoever. I take full responsibility for my actions.&quot;

Twigg became chairman of Progress, an independent organisation for Labour party members, and director of the Foreign Policy Centre, a think tank which develops long-term multilateral approaches to global problems. Twigg worked at the Aegis Trust between 2005 and 2010, where he worked on their educational and campaigning work against genocide. He is also a patron of the Workers&#x27; Educational Association.

===MP for Liverpool West Derby (2010–2019)===

Twigg was selected as the Labour Co-operative candidate for the Liverpool West Derby constituency at the 2010 general election. He was elected with a majority of 18,467, garnering 64.1% of the vote.

In October 2010, he unsuccessfully contested the election for the Shadow Cabinet, coming in 36th out of the 49 candidates and winning 55 votes. He was subsequently appointed to the Labour front bench as a shadow minister in the Foreign Affairs team.

On 7 October 2011, he was appointed to the post of Shadow Secretary of State for Education, following the Shadow Cabinet reshuffle.

In the 2013 Shadow Cabinet reshuffle, Twigg lost his position of Shadow Education Secretary and was demoted to the Shadow Justice Team as Shadow Minister for Constitutional Reform.

On 19 June 2015, he was elected chairman of the International Development Select Committee. He supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

Twigg stood down at the 2019 general election and was succeeded by Ian Byrne, who retained the seat for Labour.

===Post-parliamentary career===
In August 2020, Twigg was appointed as the 8th Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA). CPA represents Parliamentarians and parliamentary staff in around 180 Commonwealth parliaments and legislatures.

==Personal life==
In August 2014 Twigg took on the Ice Bucket Challenge in aid of the Motor Neurone Disease Association.

Twigg is a patron of the Merseyside Domestic Violence Services, a patron of Kinship Carers Liverpool and a patron of the Merseyside Branch of the Motor Neurone Disease Association.

<text>Isabella of Mar (fl. c. 1277 – 12 December 1296) was the first wife of Robert Bruce VII, Earl of Carrick. Isabella died before her husband was crowned (as Robert I) King of Scotland. She and her husband were the grandparents of Robert II, King of Scotland, founder of the Royal House of Stuart.

Isabella was the daughter of Domhnall I, Earl of Mar (died 1297 - 1302) and Susanna ferch Llewelyn (died after 1295), daughter of Llewelyn the Great and widow of Máel Coluim II, Earl of Fife. Isabella&#x27;s father was evidently an adherent of Robert Bruce V, Lord of Annandale (died 1295), a man who staked a claim to the Scottish throne. The close relationship between Domhnall&#x27;s family and the Bruces is evidenced by two marriages; the first between Isabella and Robert, and the second between Domhnall&#x27;s son and comital successor, Gartnait (died c.1302), and a sister of Robert Bruce VII.

The marriage of Robert Bruce VII and Isabella probably took place in the 1290s. The union produced a single child, a daughter named Marjorie (died 1316), who was born in about 1296. Robert and Isabella&#x27;s daughter, Marjorie, married Walter Stewart, Steward of Scotland, and their son eventually reigned as Robert II, King of Scotland (died 1390).

Six years after Isabella&#x27;s death in childbirth, Robert Bruce VII married his second wife, Elizabeth de Burgh (died 1327).

== The &quot;Great Cause&quot; ==
As the daughter of an Earl, Isabella&#x27;s life was deeply entwined with the politics of her kingdom. In 1286, a few years after her birth, King Alexander III was found dead on the shores near Kinghorn. His heir, Margaret of Norway, was too young to take the throne at this time, but four years later in 1290, she was brought to Orkney, where she died at 7 years old. What followed was Scotland&#x27;s most notorious succession dispute, one that eventually led to Bruce&#x27;s ascension and the Scottish Wars of Independence. After Margaret&#x27;s death, the Scottish nobles formed factions in support of the two primary families vying for the throne, the House of Balliol and the House of Bruce. The fate of Isabella, her kingdom, and the future Stewart dynasty all hinged on these two houses.

=== Clan Mar and the House of Bruce ===

At around the same time, Isabella&#x27;s father, Domhnall I, Earl of Mar, was seeking a strong ally that could protect his clan from covetous neighbors. When the succession crisis first arose, Domhnall was already amid a clan dispute with John Comyn of Badenoch. Domhnall claimed that the Comyns had pillaged his lands, and he was thus eager for an excuse to take up arms against this powerful neighbor. As the Comyns were staunch supporters of John Balliol&#x27;s claim to the throne, Domhnall found a natural ally in Clan Bruce. As the chronicler, John of Fordun, wrote &quot;all the Comyns and their whole abettors stood by Balliol; but the earls of Mar and Atholl, with the whole strength of their power, cleaved, in the firm league of kinship, to the side of Robert of Bruce.&quot; Domhnall summoned an army within a mere fortnight of Margret&#x27;s death, eager and ready to support his newfound ally. This succession dispute, or &quot;Great Cause,&quot; was what initially brought Isabella&#x27;s Clan Mar and the House of Bruce together as allies.

Isabella&#x27;s father sought to use Isabella to strengthen ties with the powerful Bruce family. And though Clan Mar had no shortage of enemies prior to Margret&#x27;s death, the succession dispute and their siding with Bruce had brought them new opponents. There was thus a great pressure on the part of Domhnall to sow a strong bond with new allies who could protect the Mars from their growing list of enemies, and in this age of diplomatic marriage, that meant that Isabella was to wed into an allied clan. The premier choice for Isabella&#x27;s spouse was the young Robert the Bruce, the Earl of Carrick and future King of Scots—and also the grandson of Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, who was vying for the throne at that time. In the late thirteenth century, the 5th Lord of Annandale was nearing the end of his life, and thus, Domhnall saw the young Earl of Carrick as a potential future king. By pursuing a marriage between Isabella and Bruce, Domnall was not only strengthening his bond with allies, which was his primary goal but was also marrying into a powerful family that might one day rule the kingdom. Isabella, like many European noblewomen in the medieval age, was used as a diplomatic pawn by her ambitious father.

The House of Bruce&#x27;s interest in Isabella was politically motivated as well, though their interest existed before the succession dispute. To the North of the Earldom of Mar laid the lordship of Garioch. Garioch was a land divided between four different co-heirs, including the House of Bruce. Two of the other co-heirs were John Balliol and John Hastings, who would later fight Bruce for the throne. In April 1290, Bruce made an agreement with Nichlas Biggar, a minor nobleman who held a legal claim to Garioch. This arrangement granted Bruce the two-thirds of the lordship which Balliol and Hastings held; yet, in the end, the arrangement was insubstantial for attaining the lordship, so Bruce turned his eyes south to Clan Mar. As historian Michael Brown wrote:As Earl Donald&#x27;s [Domnall&#x27;s] earldom bordered the Garioch and since he held lands in the lordship as Balliol&#x27;s vassal, Donald had a direct interest in the process. These overlapping landed concerns may have fuelled the growing political alignment between Mar and Bruce which was, once again, formalised through marriage.Even before the succession dispute, the House of Bruce sought a marriage with Clan Mar to strengthen their claim on the lordship of Garioch. Their interests would only &quot;overlap&quot; further with Margret&#x27;s death and Balliol&#x27;s rival claim. The marriage between Isabella and Bruce was thus politically motivated—the two clans shared enemies and sought to strengthen their political ties through the marriage.

== Robert the Bruce and Marjorie Bruce ==

Isabella died shortly after her marriage with Robert the Bruce, but not before delivering her daughter, Marjorie Bruce. The details of Isabella&#x27;s death, like her life, are obscured by our lack of primary sources; however, it is likely she died during-—or shortly after—Marjorie&#x27;s birth in 1296. Death during childbirth was far from uncommon in the medieval age. As medievalist, Jennifer Edwards, has noted, childbirth in the medieval age was &quot;dangerous for all women [...] Pregnancy and childbirth were recognized as perilous, as well as uncomfortable, times.&quot; However, Isabella&#x27;s early death—at around the age of 19—was atypical, even for the medieval age. Most women who died during childbirth were much older than Isabella; as a point of comparison, modern scholars have estimated that the average age of Norwich women in the 11th century was only 33. This was due to the frequency of childbirth—as Edwards explained, &quot;this statistic does correlate with the time when women were most likely on a second, third, or subsequent pregnancy and thus most at risk of death in childbirth.&quot; So, while death during childbirth was not unusual, Isabella&#x27;s death during her &quot;first&quot; pregnancy was premature, even for the time.

The year of Marjorie&#x27;s birth (1296) was a chaotic time for her father, as on 26 March 1296 seven Scottish earls loyal to Comyn launched a surprise attack on Carlisle, Bruce&#x27;s principal residence at the time. The attack failed, but it proved to be a catalyst to English King Edward&#x27;s growing frustration with the Scots. In 1296, John Balliol successfully beat Bruce to the throne after being elected by a group of noblemen selected by Edward. But Balliol did not remain loyal to Edward for long, and soon made an alliance with his most powerful enemy—the French. Edward saw the creation of this &quot;Auld Alliance&quot; as a betrayal, and with the recent attack on Carlisle—which Edward considered an attack on England itself—he lost all patience with the Scots. He marched his armies north in March 1296, beginning the Scottish Wars of Independence, and winning substantial victories at Berwick and Dunbar, eventually deposing the then King of Scots, John Balliol. By July 1297, Bruce had joined in the revolt, fighting the English and coaxing Edward towards negotiations. After numerous defeats, Edward signed a treaty in exchange for an oath of allegiance, and due to Bruce&#x27;s habit of turning coat, Edward ordered that Bruce provide the infant Marjorie as a hostage—as collateral for her father&#x27;s loyalty. The details of what occurred next are unfortunately sparse. We know that Bruce never delivered Marjorie, but why Edward did not retaliate against this blatant disobedience remains a mystery. Perhaps Edward simply had more important issues to tend to. The Guardian of Scotland at that time, William Wallace, did not sign the treaty and was still in open revolt. Wallace received a devastating loss from Edward at Falkirk, and with that, the revolt was extinguished. Edward then marched back to England, seemingly content with his victories and made no further demands for Marjorie.

Bruce remained nominally loyal to Edward until 10 February 1306, when he murdered his rival, John Comyn, at the high altar of the Chapel of Greyfriars Monastery in Dumfries. With his rival defeated, Bruce broke his allegiance to Edward and attacked the English garrisoned at Dumfries Castle. Later that year, on 25 March 1306, Bruce was officially crowned King of Scots. Edward marched North that spring to depose his former ally.

Though Bruce lost most of his initial battles as King, he remained elusive and escaped Edward&#x27;s grasp time and time again. In June 1306, Edward&#x27;s forces dealt Bruce a devastating defeat at the Battle of Methven. To keep his family out of Edward&#x27;s hands, Bruce sent word to his brother, Neil, and to the Earl of Atholl requesting that they take Marjorie and his wife to Kildrummy Castle until it was safe. They lived there briefly for a few months until September 1306, when Edward II, Prince of Wales, personally led an assault on the castle. The outnumbered Scots received yet another devastating defeat, but this time there was nowhere to run and the Scottish lords at Kildrummy were captured and executed, including Neil Bruce. The quick-thinking Earl of Atholl, however, managed to escape and took Robert&#x27;s wife, his sister, and Marjorie into hiding. They were betrayed days after their flight by Uilleam II, Earl of Ross, a fervent supporter of Balliol who handed Atholl and the Bruces over to the English. The Earl of Atholl was executed, but Queen Elizabeth and the twelve-year-old Marjorie and were taken alive and held hostage for nearly a decade.

The details of Marjorie&#x27;s captivity are once again sparse, though we know that a cage was built for her outside the Tower of London. This cage was likely designed for the same purpose as the one made for Isabella MacDuff, the Countess of Buchan who oversaw Bruce&#x27;s coronation. MacDuff&#x27;s cage was set in the public&#x27;s view outside Berwick Castle as a warning to rebels and, possibly, as a ploy to coax Bruce out of hiding. According to the chronicle, &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot;, Edward ordered:Because she has not struck with the sword, she shall not die by the sword; but, on account of the unlawful coronation which she performed, let her be closely confined in an abode of stone and iron, made in the shape of a crown, and let her be hung up out of doors in the open air at Berwick, that both in her life and after her death she may be a spectacle and eternal reproach to travellers.Marjorie&#x27;s aunt, Mary Bruce, was held in a similar cage outside Roxburgh Castle, and endured exposure and public humiliation as MacDuff did. Marjorie however, in the end, was spared this ordeal. Perhaps Edward felt Mary&#x27;s and MacDuff&#x27;s humiliation sufficed enough, though, there is no evidence to definitively say why Edward decided to spare Marjorie from her cage; instead, Edward sent her to the Gilbertine convent in Watton, where she lived in virtual isolation for the next seven years.

Bruce fought another seven hard years for his family and crown, culminating in the famous Battle of Bannockburn which saw a Scottish victory over an English army more than triple their size. During the fight, the English Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, was captured. Bruce leveraged this powerful Earl for Marjorie&#x27;s release, and in October 1314, the two sides met and exchanged the English Earl for the Scottish Princess. Of course, Bruce himself was not there for the exchange; instead, he sent the young Walter Stewart—the 6th High Steward of Scotland and hero of Bannockburn—in his stead to the Anglo-Scottish border to retrieve Marjorie and her family. Walter and Marjorie—who were about the same age—evidently took a liking to each other, as the following year (1315), the two married; and with that, the lines of Bruce and Stewart merged.

=== Robert II and the Stewart Dynasty ===
Marjorie conceived a child shortly after her marriage with Walter Stewart, but she would not live to see her child grow. There are different accounts of what followed, with the traditional one being that Marjorie was taking a ride to Renfrewshire in the latter stages of her pregnancy when her horse spontaneously bucked her off and onto the road, sending Marjorie into premature labor and, like her mother, to her untimely demise at the young age of twenty. However, her child, Robert II, was alive and healthy.

While Robert the Bruce did remarry to Elizabeth de Burgh and fathered a young son with her, David II, David was last of the House of Bruce to hold the crown. Though David married several women during his reign and had even more mistresses, he died without children in the year 1371. Since David was the only male heir of Robert&#x27;s, Isabella&#x27;s descendants became the next in line for the throne. The grandson of Isabella and son of Marjorie Bruce, Robert II, succeeded to the throne in place of his childless uncle, continuing the Bruce lineage as the first Stewart to hold the crown.

<text>The Sporting News is a website and former magazine publication owned by Sporting News Holdings, which is a U.S.-based sports media company formed in December 2020 by a private investor consortium. It was originally established in 1886 as a print magazine. It became the dominant American publication covering baseball, acquiring the nickname &quot;The Bible of Baseball&quot;.

From 2002 to February 2022, it was known simply as &quot;Sporting News&quot;. In December 2012, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; ended print publication and shifted to a digital-only publication. It currently has editions in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan.

==History==
=== Early history ===
*March 17, 1886: &quot;The Sporting News&quot; (&quot;TSN&quot;), founded in St. Louis by Alfred H. Spink, a director of the St. Louis Browns baseball team, publishes its first edition. The weekly newspaper sells for 5 cents. Baseball, horse racing and professional wrestling received the most coverage in the first issue. Meanwhile, the sporting weeklies &quot;Clipper&quot; and &quot;Sporting Life&quot; were based in New York and Philadelphia. By World War I, &quot;TSN&quot; would be the only national baseball newspaper.
*1901: The American League, another rival to baseball&#x27;s National League, begins playing. &quot;TSN&quot; was a vocal supporter of the new league and its founder, Ban Johnson. Both parties advocated cleaning up the sport, in particular ridding it of liquor sales, gambling and assaults on umpires.
*1903: &quot;TSN&quot; editor Arthur Flanner helps draft the National Agreement, a document that brought a truce between the AL and NL and helped bring about the modern World Series.
*1904: New York photographer Charles Conlon begins taking portraits of major league players as they pass through the city&#x27;s three ballparks: the Polo Grounds, Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field. His images, many of which were featured in &quot;TSN&quot;, have become treasured symbols of baseball&#x27;s past.
*1914: Alfred&#x27;s son, J.G. Taylor Spink, takes over the paper.
*1936: &quot;TSN&quot; names its first major league Sporting News Player of the Year Award, Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants. It is the oldest and most prestigious award given to the single player in MLB who had the most outstanding season. To this day, it remains voted on by MLB players.
*1942: After decades of being intertwined with baseball, &quot;TSN&quot; adds in-season football coverage.
*1946: &quot;TSN&quot; expands its football coverage with an eight-page tabloid publication titled &quot;The Quarterback&quot;. The tab is later renamed the &quot;All-Sports News&quot; as coverage of other sports is added, including professional and college basketball and hockey.
*1962: J.G. Taylor Spink dies. His son C.C. Johnson Spink takes over the publication. In 1962, after Spink&#x27;s death, the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) instituted the J. G. Taylor Spink Award as the highest award given to its members. Spink was also the first recipient.
*1967: &quot;TSN&quot; publishes its first full-color photo, a cover image of Orioles star Frank Robinson.
*1977: The Spink family sells &quot;TSN&quot; to Times Mirror in 1977.
*1981: C.C. Johnson Spink sells &quot;TSN&quot; to Tribune Company.
*1991: &quot;The Sporting News&quot; transitions to a glossy, full-color all-sports magazine.
*1996: &quot;The Sporting News&quot; comes online, serving as a sports content provider for AOL. The following year, it launches sportingnews.com.
*2000: Tribune Company sells &quot;TSN&quot; to Vulcan Inc., headed by tech billionaire Paul Allen. The following year, the company acquired the One on One Sports radio network, renaming it Sporting News Radio.
*2002: The magazine drops the definite article from its name and becomes just &quot;Sporting News&quot; (&quot;SN&quot;). Subsequent covers reflect the change.
*2006: Vulcan sells &quot;SN&quot; to Advance Media, which places the publication under the supervision of American City Business Journals (ACBJ).
*2007: &quot;Sporting News&quot; begins its move from St. Louis, where it had been based since its founding, to ACBJ&#x27;s headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. The publication leaves St. Louis for good in 2008, when it also became a bi-weekly publication.

=== Transition to digital publication ===
In 2011, &quot;Sporting News&quot; announced a deal to take over editorial control of AOL&#x27;s sports website FanHouse. In December 2012, after 126 years, &quot;Sporting News&quot; published its final issue as a print publication, and shifted to becoming a digital-only publication.

The following March, ACBJ contributed &quot;Sporting News&quot; into a joint venture with the U.S. assets of sports data company Perform Group, known as Perform Sporting News Limited and doing business as Sporting News Media. Perform owned 65% of Sporting News Media. &quot;Sporting News&quot; would join Perform Group&#x27;s other domestic properties, such as its video syndication unit ePlayer and its soccer website Goal.com. The deal excluded the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sporting News Yearbooks&quot; unit and &quot;NASCAR Illustrated&quot;. Almost immediately after the venture was established, &quot;Sporting News&quot; laid off 13 staff writers. Perform Group acquired the remainder of Sporting News Media in 2015.

Under Perform&#x27;s ownership, &quot;Sporting News&quot; shifted to a more tabloid-like editorial direction. The site introduced a new logo and website design in 2016. Following Perform&#x27;s acquisition of ACBJ&#x27;s remaining stake, it began to align itself more closely with the company&#x27;s other units, including replacing Associated Press articles with Perform&#x27;s own Omnisport wire service for articles and video content (which began to constitute a sizable portion of the site&#x27;s overall content). &quot;Sporting News&quot; also began to introduce new localized versions in other markets, with a focus on countries where it had launched its sports streaming service DAZN. These sites are, in turn, used to promote the DAZN service. Perform Media president Juan Delgado explained that the company was trying to preserve the heritage of the &quot;Sporting News&quot; brand by still publishing original content, while also publishing content oriented towards social media to appeal to younger users.

===Later history===
In September 2018, Perform Group spun out its consumer properties, including &quot;Sporting News&quot; and DAZN, into a new company known as DAZN Group. The remaining sports data business became Perform Content, and was sold in 2019 to Vista Equity Partners and merged with STATS LLC.

In the summer of 2020, Lindenwood University of St. Charles, Missouri, acquired the archives collection of &quot;The Sporting News&quot; from ACBJ. The collection was described as consisting of &quot;10,000+ books on baseball, football, hockey, basketball, NCAA, and other sports.&quot;

In December 2020, DAZN Group sold Sporting News to a private investment consortium, which became Sporting News Holdings.

==Athlete of the Year==
===Sportsman of the Year===

From 1968 to 2007, the magazine selected one or more individuals as &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot;. On four occasions, the award was shared by two recipients. Twice, in 1993 and 2000, the award went to a pair of sportsmen within the same organization. In 1999, the honor was given to a whole team. No winner was chosen in 1987.

On December 18, 2007, the magazine announced New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady as 2007 Sportsman of the Year, making Brady the first to repeat as a recipient of individual honors. Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals was also honored twice, but shared his second award with Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs.

In 2008, the award was replaced by two awards: &quot;Pro Athlete of the Year&quot; and &quot;College Athlete of the Year&quot;. These in turn were replaced by a singular &quot;Athlete of the Year&quot; award starting in 2011.

Prior to 2005, the &quot;SN&quot; Comeback Player Award was generally recognized as the principal award of its type, as MLB did not give such an award until that year.

<text>Antikristos or Antikrystós () is a dance of Greek origin. “Aντικρυστός” in Greek language refers to the verb αντικρύζω “be across, opposite, face-to-face” (from Ancient Greek ἀντικρύ “vis-à-vis, face-to-face”). It is also known in Armenia. Antikristos has similarities with the karsilamas dance. It is danced in couples.

<text>&quot;Amok Time&quot; is the second season premiere episode of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon, scored by Gerald Fried, and directed by Joseph Pevney, it first aired on September 15, 1967.

The episode features First Officer Spock returning to his homeworld for a brutal Vulcan wedding ritual. It is the only episode of &quot;The Original Series&quot; to depict scenes on the planet Vulcan.

It was the first episode to air (though the fifth, by production code) of season 2 featuring Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) as the ship&#x27;s navigator. It was also the first episode to list &quot;DeForest Kelley as Dr. McCoy&quot; in the opening credits, and the first episode broadcast in the series&#x27; new time slot of 8:30 pm on Friday night. This is the first episode to use the &quot;Vulcan salute&quot; and introduced the concept of &quot;pon farr,&quot; the Vulcan mating cycle.

==Plot==
Spock, first officer of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, exhibits unusual behavior and requests leave on his home planet Vulcan. Captain Kirk and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy agree, and Kirk diverts &quot;Enterprise&quot;. En route, Kirk receives orders from Starfleet to represent the Federation at the inauguration ceremony for Altair VI&#x27;s new president. Though Kirk sets course for Altair VI, Spock secretly changes course back to Vulcan. Spock claims no memory of ordering the course change.

Kirk orders Spock to Sickbay, where McCoy finds evidence of physical and emotional stress which will kill him within eight days if not treated. Spock explains that he is undergoing &quot;pon farr&quot;, a condition male Vulcans experience periodically throughout their adult life, and that he must mate or die. Kirk sets course for Vulcan, believing that Spock&#x27;s life is more important than his career.

At Vulcan, Spock invites Kirk and McCoy to accompany him to the wedding. T&#x27;Pring, Spock&#x27;s betrothed, arrives with Stonn, a pureblood Vulcan whom she prefers to Spock. T&#x27;Pau, a renowned matriarch, begins the ceremony. However, T&#x27;Pring demands the &quot;kal-if-fee&quot;, a physical challenge between Spock and a champion she selects; unexpectedly, she chooses Kirk. Spock begs T&#x27;Pau to forbid it, but T&#x27;Pau leaves the decision to Kirk; another champion will be selected if he refuses. Kirk accepts the challenge, only to learn that it is &quot;to the death&quot;.

The two fight with &quot;lirpa&quot;. Kirk is challenged by Spock&#x27;s strength and agility as well as the thinner atmosphere of Vulcan. T&#x27;Pau lets McCoy inject Kirk with a compound to offset the effects of the Vulcan atmosphere. Spock later garrots Kirk with an &quot;ahn&#x27;woon&quot;. McCoy declares Kirk dead and requests transport to &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Spock renounces his claim on T&#x27;Pring, who explains that she feared losing Stonn in the &quot;kal-if-fee&quot;. By choosing Kirk, T&#x27;Pring would have Stonn either way: If Spock was the victor, he would release her from the marriage for having made the challenge, and if Kirk won, he would not want her. Spock compliments T&#x27;Pring on her logic and returns to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, warning Stonn that &quot;having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting&quot;.

Aboard &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Spock announces his intent to submit himself for trial for killing Kirk, when he discovers Kirk is alive and well. The injection McCoy gave Kirk was a neuroparalyzer. Asked about what followed, Spock states that he lost all desire for T&#x27;Pring after he thought he killed Kirk. Kirk learns that Starfleet, at T&#x27;Pau&#x27;s request, has belatedly given the &quot;Enterprise&quot; permission to travel to Vulcan.

Leonard Nimoy first used his signature Vulcan salute in this episode.

The chart-topping British pop band T&#x27;Pau took their name from the Vulcan matriarch who presides over events on the planet.

<doc id="413383" wikidata="Q812088" url="?curid=413383" title="Bay Street">
<text>Bay Street is a major thoroughfare in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the centre of Toronto&#x27;s Financial District and is often used by metonymy to refer to Canada&#x27;s financial services industry since succeeding Montreal&#x27;s St. James Street in that role in the 1970s.

Bay Street begins at Queens Quay (Toronto Harbour) in the south and ends at Davenport Road in the north. The original section of Bay Street ran only as far north as Queen Street West and just south of Front Street where the Grand Trunk rail lines entered into Union Station. Sections north of Queen Street were renamed Bay Street as several other streets were consolidated and several gaps filled in to create a new thoroughfare in the 1920s. The largest of these streets, Terauley Street, ran from Queen Street West to College Street. At these two points, there is a curve in Bay Street. North of College past Grenville Street to Breadalbane Street was St. Vincent Street, which was later bypassed with new alignment to the west leading to a stub now called St. Vincent Lane from Grosvenor Street to Grenville Street.

==History==

The street was originally known as Bear Street because of frequent bear sightings in the early history of Toronto. It was renamed Bay Street in 1797 from the fact that it connected Lot Street (present-day Queen Street West) to a bay at the Toronto Harbour. In the 19th century, the intersection of Bay and King Street was home to Toronto&#x27;s major newspapers: the Mail Building, the old Toronto Star Building, and the William H. Wright Building (old &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; headquarters) were all located near the intersection.

Until 1922, the section of Bay running north from Queen Street and ending at College Street was known as Terauley Street (named after the Terauley estate of John Simcoe Macaulay near Bay and Queen Streets). Several discontinuous streets existed north of College Street to Davenport Road - St. Vincent Street, Chapel Street, North Street, Ketchum Avenue. By-Law 9316 joined these streets together as far north as Scollard Street in 1922. Finally, By-Law 9884, enacted on January 28, 1924, changed the name of Ketchum Avenue to Bay Street, extending it to Davenport Road. There is a short street called Terauley Lane running west of Bay from Grenville Street to Grosvenor Street.

==Finance district==
&quot;Bay Street&quot; is frequently used as a metonym to refer to Toronto&#x27;s Financial District and the Canadian financial sector as a whole, similar to Wall Street in the United States. &quot;Bay Street banker&quot;, as in the phrase &quot;cold as a Bay Street banker&#x27;s heart&quot;, was a term of opprobrium especially among Prairie farmers who feared that Toronto-based financial interests were hurting them. Within the legal profession, the term Bay Street is also used colloquially to refer to the large, full-service business law firms of Toronto.

The intersection of Bay and King Street is often seen as the centre of Canadian banking and finance. Four of Canada&#x27;s five major banks have office towers at the intersection — the Bank of Montreal at First Canadian Place, Scotiabank at Scotia Plaza, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) at Commerce Court, and Toronto-Dominion Bank at the Toronto-Dominion Centre — and the fifth, the Royal Bank at Royal Bank Plaza, is one block south. Historically, Bay and King was known as the &quot;MINT Corner&quot; from Montreal, Imperial, Nova Scotia, and Toronto, but since 1961 the Imperial Bank has been part of CIBC and the Bank of Nova Scotia has rebranded itself, so this nickname is no longer widely used. The core cluster of towers has crept north with the addition of the 50-storey Bay Adelaide Centre and the St. Regis Hotel.

==Points of interest==

The Union Station rail, subway, and bus hub partly fronts on Bay at Front, toward the south end of the central business district. The intersection of Bay and Bloor is the location of the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s Bay subway station, toward the north end of the central business district. From its 1931 opening until its 2021 decommissioning, intercity bus service was also provided at the Toronto Coach Terminal on Bay slightly north of Dundas.

Significant condominium development on Bay, north of the financial district, boomed during the 1990s and construction continues on large, 40-plus storey condominiums and multi-use buildings today. The area is defined by Dundas Street to the south and Bloor/Yorkville to the north and crosses through Toronto&#x27;s Discovery District. Another prominent intersection is the one nearest Yorkville at Bay and Bloor, the centre of an expensive shopping district known as Mink Mile.

The area attracts many who work in the financial district and those who work in the Discovery District, nearby hospitals and schools (Toronto Metropolitan University and the University of Toronto). More than 67 per cent (or 10,380) of residents in this area are in the working ages of 25–64, significantly higher than the City of Toronto&#x27;s average of 58%.

Notable buildings include:
* St. Basil&#x27;s Church (Toronto)
* Toronto Coach Terminal
* Residences of College Park
* 777 Bay
* Murano
* Ontario Government Buildings
* Sutton Place Hotel
* Manulife Centre
* Bell Trinity Square
* Toronto Old City Hall
* Nathan Phillips Square
* Flagship store of Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company
* Bay-Adelaide Centre
* The St. Regis Toronto
* Commerce Court
* Brookfield Place
* CIBC Square
* Scotiabank Arena
* RBC WaterPark Place
==Public transit==
Bay Street is served by the route 19 Bay, which is one of few bus routes exclusively serving Downtown Toronto. Bay Street used to be served by streetcars lines, which were gradually phased out after the north–south Yonge and University subway lines opened in 1954 and 1963 respectively. The remaining streetcar tracks between Dundas and College Streets are now used for short turns and diversions.

<doc id="413385" wikidata="Q3488820" url="?curid=413385" title="Spock's Brain">
<text>&quot;Spock&#x27;s Brain&quot; is the third season premiere episode of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Gene L. Coon (under the pseudonym &quot;Lee Cronin&quot;) and directed by Marc Daniels, it was first broadcast on September 20, 1968.

During the episode, an alien female played by Marj Dusay beams aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and, after incapacitating the rest of the crew, surgically removes Spock&#x27;s brain. Captain Kirk and the crew have just hours to locate and restore it before Spock&#x27;s body dies.

Widely regarded as the worst episode of the series, it was the first to air after NBC moved the show from 8:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday nights.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;USS Enterprise&quot;, under the command of Captain Kirk, encounters an alien ship, from which a mysterious woman beams onto the &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge. She stuns the entire crew then examines each of them, taking particular interest in the Vulcan First Officer Spock. When the crew awakens, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy finds Spock in sick bay with his brain surgically removed. Because of his unusual Vulcan physiology, Spock&#x27;s body can be kept alive in this state, but for no more than twenty-four hours, giving Captain Kirk that much time to recover his stolen brain.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; follows the alien ship&#x27;s ion trail to the sixth planet of the Sigma Draconis system, a harsh world in the middle of an ice age. A band of male inhabitants attack the landing party, and a captured attacker warns Kirk about the &quot;others&quot;, also known as &quot;the givers of pain and delight&quot;. Kirk asks about the females of his kind, but is met only with bewilderment.

The landing party is joined by Dr. McCoy, accompanied by Spock&#x27;s mobile body, controlled by a device McCoy has fashioned. The party travels deep underground and encounters a woman named Luma. When questioned, Luma shows the mentality of a child. Spock&#x27;s voice is heard through a communicator, but before the conversation goes further, Kirk and his party are captured. The party is brought before the leader of the women, Kara, the same woman who appeared on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge. Kirk demands to know what they have done with Spock&#x27;s brain, but Kara claims she does not understand what a brain is, exclaiming &quot;Brain and brain! What is brain?&quot; As they try to explain the function of a brain, she realizes that what they are seeking is the &quot;Controller&quot;, on which the underground civilization is completely dependent.

The landing party escapes and follows Spock&#x27;s signals to a control room where his brain has been placed. Kara tells them that the skills needed to remove a brain were provided by a machine called the &quot;Teacher&quot;, and that knowledge so obtained lasts no more than three hours. McCoy decides to use the Teacher himself, and then quickly begins the procedure to restore Spock&#x27;s brain. McCoy&#x27;s new knowledge begins to fade before the operation is complete, but Spock provides assistance after McCoy reestablishes Spock&#x27;s ability to speak.

Without their Controller, Kara fears for the women&#x27;s existence, but Kirk assures her that the men and women can learn to survive together on the surface. Much to McCoy&#x27;s dismay, Spock recites a protracted history of the culture of Sigma Draconis VI.

==Production==
Although the episode&#x27;s story and teleplay were formally attributed under Writer&#x27;s Guild of America West rules to former &quot;Star Trek&quot; producer Gene L. Coon (who specifically wrote its germinal pitch; initial story outline; and a sequence of first, second and revised second draft teleplays) under his &quot;Lee Cronin&quot; pseudonym (intended to telegraph his dissatisfaction with the final episode [while likely also attenuating potential career setbacks from his propinquity to the work] in a manner analogous to the Alan Smithee and Cordwainer Bird pseudonyms), incipient showrunner Fred Freiberger contributed a revised story outline in between Coon&#x27;s first and second drafts that radically altered the gestation of the episode. Thereafter, the final draft teleplay was written by Freiberger-era story editor Arthur H. Singer. Freiberger finally contributed a revised final draft teleplay and additional page revisions during the production period.

In Coon&#x27;s April 1968 story outline, Spock&#x27;s brain is taken by a group of Nefelese antagonists (led by a male named Ehr Von) during a survey of the surface of an asteroid. There is no reference to the Teacher. Upon making contact with Spock&#x27;s brain, Kirk instructs the brain to go into the slon porra, a Vulcan state of complete mental control. Although McCoy studies advanced Nefelese medical techniques that ultimately enable the restoration of Spock&#x27;s body (in tandem with his preexisting knowledge of Vulcan and human medicine), this is done without any human-machine interface. Additionally, upon the completion of the surgery, Spock experiences side effects due to the reversal of several nerve endings, forcing him to laugh when he wants to sneeze; these complications (constituting a soupçon of Coon&#x27;s characteristic levity) are ultimately surmounted through his mental discipline.

== Reception ==
The episode is generally regarded by fans, and those who took part in its production, as the worst episode of the series. William Shatner described it as one of the series&#x27; worst episodes, calling the plot a &quot;tribute&quot; to NBC executives who slashed the show&#x27;s budget and placed it in a bad time slot. Leonard Nimoy wrote: &quot;Frankly, during the entire shooting of that episode, I was embarrassed —a feeling that overcame me many times during the final season of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.&quot;

Zack Handlen, of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, gave the episode a &quot;D&quot; rating, describing the writing as bad and repetitive and the direction as weak. He added that it had its funny moments and some parts had &quot;a lumpy B-movie charm&quot;.

In his book &quot;What Were They Thinking? The 100 Dumbest Events in Television History&quot;, author David Hofstede ranked the episode at No. 71 on the list.

A device similar to that used to remotely operate Spock&#x27;s brainless body is used in the episode &quot;The Magnificent Ferengi&quot; of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; to animate a cadaver.

Swedish synthpop band S.P.O.C.K has featured &quot;Mr. Spock&#x27;s Brain&quot; on their 1993 album &quot;Five Year Mission&quot;.

The rock band Phish performs a song entitled &quot;Spock&#x27;s Brain&quot;.

The episode was referenced in &quot;Modern Principles: Microeconomics&quot; by Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok of George Mason University as an example of how it is virtually impossible to have a command economy, in that not even Spock&#x27;s brain could run an economy.

Star Trek co-producer Robert H. Justman recalled in the book &quot;Inside Star Trek The Real Story&quot; that he was the person who suggested that Spock&#x27;s brain, after being rescued by the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew, actually &quot;takes over during surgery and instructs Dr. McCoy exactly how to go about reinserting it back where it came from - inside Spock&#x27;s skull&quot;.

As of 2023, the episode has an IMDb weighted score of 5.6/10.

In 2012, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; ranked this episode as one of top ten &quot;must see&quot; episodes of the original series.

In 2013, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine ranked this episode one of the top ten most underrated episodes of the original television series, noting that despite it being regarded as the worst episode it occupies a special place in &quot;Star Trek&quot; lore. However, they also suggested this episode was skippable in their binge-watching guide for the original series in 2015.

In 2016, Syfy included this episode in a group of &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise episodes they felt were commonly disliked but &quot;deserved a second chance&quot;.

In 2017, this episode was rated the third-worst episode of all episodes of the Star Trek franchise, including the later series but before &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, by &quot;ScreenRant&quot;. In 2018, CBR included this episode in a list of &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes that are &quot;so bad they must be seen&quot;. A ranking of every episode of the original series by &quot;Hollywood&quot; placed this episode 78th out of 79 episodes. CBS News listed &quot;Spock&#x27;s Brain&quot; as one of the worst in the original series. Digital Fox ranked &quot;Spock&#x27;s Brain&quot; as the number-one worst episode of all Star Trek up to 2018.

In 2017, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked this episode as the second &quot;best worst&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode of the original series.

== Releases ==
The episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993, as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;. A trailer for this and the other episodes was also included, and the episode had English and Japanese audio tracks.

<doc id="413386" wikidata="Q326781" url="?curid=413386" title="Lou Boudreau">
<text>Louis Boudreau (July 17, 1917 – August 10, 2001), nicknamed &quot;Old Shufflefoot&quot;, &quot;Handsome Lou&quot;, and &quot;the Good Kid&quot;, was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 15 seasons, primarily as a shortstop on the Cleveland Indians, and managed four teams for 15 seasons including 10 seasons as a player-manager. He was also a radio announcer for the Chicago Cubs and in college was a dual-sport athlete in baseball and basketball, earning All-American honors in basketball for the University of Illinois.

Boudreau was an All-Star for seven seasons. In 1948, Boudreau won the American League Most Valuable Player Award and managed the Cleveland Indians to the World Series title. He won the 1944 American League (AL) batting title (.327), and led the league in doubles in 1941, 1944, and 1947. He led AL shortstops in fielding eight times. Boudreau still holds the MLB record for hitting the most consecutive doubles in a game (four), set on July 14, 1946.

In 1970, Boudreau was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and his No. 5 was retired by the Indians that same year.

==Early life==
Boudreau was born in Harvey, Illinois, the son of Birdie (Henry) and Louis Boudreau. His father was of French-Canadian ancestry, his mother was Jewish, and both of his maternal grandparents were observant Orthodox Jews with whom when he was young he celebrated Passover seders. He was raised Catholic by his father after his parents divorced. He graduated from Thornton Township High School in Harvey, Illinois, where he led the &quot;Flying Clouds&quot; to three straight Illinois high school championship games, winning in 1933 and finishing as runner up in 1934 and 1935.

==College baseball and basketball==

Boudreau attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity and captain of the basketball and baseball teams. During the 1936–37 basketball and baseball seasons, Boudreau led each Fighting Illini team to a Big Ten Conference championship. During the 1937–38 basketball season, Boudreau was named an NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball All-American.

While Boudreau was still at Illinois, Cleveland Indians general manager Cy Slapnicka paid him an undisclosed sum in return for agreeing to play baseball for the Indians after he graduated. Due to this agreement, Boudreau was ruled ineligible for collegiate sports by the Big Ten Conference officials. During his senior year at Illinois, he played professional basketball with the Hammond Ciesar All-Americans of the National Basketball League.

Despite playing professional baseball with Cleveland, Boudreau earned his Bachelor of Science in education from Illinois in 1940 and worked as the Illinois freshman basketball coach for the 1939 and 1940 teams. Boudreau stayed on as an assistant coach for the 1941–42 Illinois Fighting Illini men&#x27;s basketball team and he was instrumental in recruiting future Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Inductee Andy Phillip to play for Illinois.

==Professional baseball career==
===Cleveland Indians===
Boudreau made his major league debut on September 9, 1938, for the Cleveland Indians at 21 as a third baseman in his first game. In 1939, Indian manager Ossie Vitt told him that he would have to move from his normal third base position to shortstop since established slugger Ken Keltner already had the regular third base job.

In 1940, his first full year as a starter, he batted .295 with 46 doubles and 101 RBI, and was selected for the All-Star Game for the first of five consecutive seasons (MLB cancelled the 1945 game due to war-time travel restrictions and did not name All-Stars).

Boudreau helped make history in 1941 as a key figure in stopping the 56-game hitting streak by Joe DiMaggio. After two sparkling stops by Keltner at third base on hard ground balls earlier in the game, Boudreau snagged a bad-hop grounder to short barehanded and started a double play retiring DiMaggio at first. He finished the season with a modest .257 batting average, but had a league-leading 45 doubles.

After the 1941 season, owner Alva Bradley promoted Indians manager Roger Peckinpaugh to general manager and appointed the 25-year-old Boudreau player-manager. Boudreau played and managed the Indians throughout World War II (playing basketball had put a strain on Boudreau&#x27;s ankles that turned into arthritis, which classified him as 4-F and thus ineligible for military service). In 1944, Boudreau turned 134 double plays, the most ever by a player-manager in MLB history. When he bought the Indians in 1947, Bill Veeck, after being approached by Boudreau, renewed the player-manager agreement with mixed feelings on both sides, as Boudreau stated that he would rather be traded than only play shortstop. Details of possibly trading him for Vern Stephens of the St. Louis Browns in 1947 only attracted fans to the side of Boudreau. However, Boudreau hit .355 in 1948; Cleveland won the AL pennant and the World Series, the Indians first World Series championship in 28 years and only the second in Indians history, with Veeck and Boudreau publicly acknowledging each other&#x27;s role in the team&#x27;s success.

===Later career===
Boudreau was released by the Indians as both player and manager following the 1950 season. He signed with the Boston Red Sox, playing full-time in 1951, moving up to player-manager in 1952 and managing from the bench in 1953–54. He then became the first manager of the Kansas City Athletics in 1955 after their move from Philadelphia until he was fired after 104 games in 1957 and replaced by Harry Craft. He last managed the Chicago Cubs, in 1960.

===Managerial record===
==Boudreau shift==
Boudreau is credited with inventing the infield shift, which came to be known colloquially as the &quot;Boudreau shift.&quot; Because slugging Red Sox superstar Ted Williams was a dead-pull hitter, he moved most of his Cleveland Indian fielders to the right of second base against the Splendid Splinter, leaving only the third baseman and left fielder to the left of second but also very close to second base, far to the right of their normal positions. With characteristic stubborn pride, Williams refused the obvious advice from teammates to hit or bunt to left against the Boudreau shift, but great hitter that he was, not changing his approach against the shift didn&#x27;t affect his hitting very much.

Boudreau later admitted that the shift was more about &quot;psyching out&quot; Williams rather than playing him to pull. &quot;I always considered the Boudreau shift a psychological, rather than a tactical&quot; ploy, he declared in his autobiography &quot;Player-Manager&quot;.

==Broadcasting==
Boudreau did play-by-play for Cub games in 1958–59 before switching roles with manager &quot;Jolly Cholly&quot; Charlie Grimm in 1960. But after only one season as Cubs manager, Boudreau returned to the radio booth and remained there until 1987. He also did radio play-by-play for the Chicago Bulls in 1966–1968 and worked on Chicago Blackhawks games for WGN radio and television as well.

The presence of a Hall of Fame announcer affected at least one game. On June 23, 1976, the Cubs were two runs behind at home in the fourth inning of the second game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates at home when the umpires called the game on account of darkness (since there were no lights at Wrigley Field until 1988), announcing that the game would be resumed at the same point the next day as was normally the case in those days. But Boudreau knew the rules better than anyone else in the park, it turned out, for he went down quickly to the clubhouse and pointed out to the umpires that a game that was not yet an official game could not be treated as a suspended game (i.e., it had not gone five innings, or four and a half with the home team leading, as neither was the case), and as such had to be replayed from the first pitch (as was then the rule in a rain-out). The umpires called the National League office, found Boudreau was correct, and removed the two-run Cubs deficit.

==Later life and honors==

Boudreau was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1970 with 77.33% of the vote. That same year, his uniform number 5 was retired by the Cleveland Indians (he wore number 4 with the Red Sox). In 1973, the city of Cleveland renamed a street bordering Cleveland Municipal Stadium after Boudreau. Boudreau Drive in Urbana, Illinois, is also named after Boudreau.

In 1990, the Cleveland Indians established The Lou Boudreau Award, which is given every year to the organization&#x27;s Minor League Player of the Year. In 1992, Boudreau&#x27;s number 5 jersey was retired by the Illinois Fighting Illini baseball program. Boudreau is only one of three Illinois Fighting Illini athletes to have their number retired; the other two athletes being Illinois Fighting Illini football players Red Grange and Dick Butkus.

<doc id="413401" wikidata="Q7147222" url="?curid=413401" title="Patrick Miller (soldier)">
<text>Patrick Wayne Miller (born January 15, 1980) is a United States Army soldier. He was a private first class during the 2003 invasion of Iraq with the U.S. Army&#x27;s 507th Maintenance Company, serving as a mechanic, becoming a POW. For his actions leading up to his capture, he was awarded the Silver Star for valor. He retired from the United States Army in August 2022.

==Early life and education==
Miller is a 1998 graduate of Valley Center High School in Valley Center, Kansas a town of 5,000 people outside Wichita, Kansas. Employed in civilian life as a welder, he joined the U.S. Army in the summer of 2002, to help pay for his student loans.

==Career==
===2003: 507th ambush===
On March 23, 2003, Iraqi forces ambushed the trail convoy element of the 507th Maintenance Company that had taken a wrong turn near An Nasiriyah. There had been bitter fighting around Nasiriyah, a vital crossing point of the River Euphrates. Miller was driving the last truck in the convoy with Private First Class Brandon Sloan and Sergeant James Riley as passengers. During the attack, he floored the accelerator, trying to steer and duck bullets at the same time. Enemy fire killed Sloan and damaged his truck&#x27;s transmission, disabling the vehicle.

===Silver Star and other awards===
Prior to his capture, Miller had stood his ground firing at the Iraqis with a malfunctioning weapon, feeding bullets into it by hand to protect two wounded comrades. A U.S. Army press release said Miller jumped from his vehicle and began firing on a mortar position that he believed was about to open fire on his convoy.

Miller was held for 22 days with four other members of his unit including:

* Spc. Edgar Hernandez - Mission, Texas.
* Spc. Joseph Hudson - Alamogordo, New Mexico.
* Spc. Shoshana Johnson - El Paso, Texas.
* Sgt. James Riley - Pennsauken, New Jersey,
* Pvt. Jessica Lynch - Palestine, West Virginia. Part of same unit but held separately in a different location

After he was captured, he was repeatedly questioned about radio frequencies that were written on pieces of paper inside his helmet. &quot;Thinking on his feet, Pfc. Miller told his captors that they were prices for power steering pumps,&quot; the release said. &quot;Disgusted, the captors threw the frequencies and his helmet into the fire.&quot;

For these actions he was awarded the Silver Star the third-highest military award for heroism in combat. Along with the Silver Star, Patrick Miller also received a Purple Heart and Prisoner of War Medal on July 2, 2003, during an Independence Day celebration at Fort Bliss, Texas.

On 20 July 2005, while serving with the 183rd Maintenance Company, Fort Carson, Miller was awarded the Combat Action Badge by retired Command Sergeant Major Tyler Walker.

The U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC) at Fort Belvoir, Virginia named its operations center and dedicated a wall in Miller&#x27;s honor in January 2004. Miller attended the ceremony with his mother and his wife and their two small children.

====Silver Star citation====
&quot;The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Patrick Miller, Private First Class, U.S. Army, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a Mechanic with the 507th Maintenance Company, 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, during combat operations in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, near An Nasiriya, Iraq, on 23 March 2003. On that date a huge American convoy headed from Kuwait to Baghdad. A dozen heavy trucks and other maintenance vehicles fell behind the rest and got lost. At sunrise, Iraqi troops ambushed the lost soldiers, firing from both sides of the highway. The Americans sped up to escape the attack, but one Humvee smashed into the back of a jack-knifed American tractor-trailer. Less than a mile behind that accident, Private Miller was driving the last truck in the convoy. During the attack, he floored the accelerator, trying to steer and duck bullets at the same time. During the ensuing battle he single-handedly stopped a mortar attack aimed at trapped soldiers.&quot;

===Miller as a POW===
He was one of five POWs to be interviewed on Al Jazeera. In the interview, he was asked why he came to Iraq, his reply was &quot;I come to fix broke stuff.&quot; Asked if he came to shoot Iraqis, he answered, &quot;No, I come to shoot only if I am shot at. They don&#x27;t bother me, I don&#x27;t bother them.&quot;

Miller lost 25 pounds in three weeks as a prisoner of war, eating boiled chicken, rice and bread so hard he had to throw it against the wall to be able to chew it.

===After Iraq===
After returning to Fort Bliss, Texas, Miller stayed on active duty with the U.S. Army and was transferred to Fort Carson, Colorado (2003-2008), Fort Riley, Kansas (2008-2012), Fort Drum, New York (2012-2015), He deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2013 with HHC, 210th Brigade Support Battalion, 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, (Jan 2013 - Sep 2013), Republic of Korea (2015-2016), Fort Riley, Kansas (2016-2022). He retired from active duty as a Sergeant First Class as of August 2022.

<doc id="413402" wikidata="Q652928" url="?curid=413402" title="Gran Turismo (series)">
<text>(GT) is a series of sim racing video games developed by Polyphony Digital. Released for PlayStation systems, &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; games are intended to emulate the appearance and performance of a large selection of vehicles, most of which are licensed reproductions of real-world automobiles. Since the franchise&#x27;s debut in 1997, over 90 million units have been sold worldwide, making it the highest selling video game franchise under the PlayStation brand.

Handling of the vehicles in &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; games is based on the principles of real-world physics, requiring the player to understand real race driving techniques to be competitive, although various assists are available for less experienced drivers. The series features a wide variety of vehicles, ranging from everyday cars to exotic sports cars and purpose-built racing cars, and from classics to modern cars. Various modifications can usually be made to the cars to alter their performance and appearance. The games often include numerous tracks to drive on, with both laser scanned replicas of real-world venues and fictional tracks appearing throughout the series. The series also performed as technical support for cars in the LMP1 class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Nürburgring 24-hour race.

&quot;Gran Turismo&quot; games typically feature a single-player campaign with numerous races, championships, license tests and other challenges. Completing these events rewards the player with prizes such as in-game money, which can be used to purchase new vehicles or upgrade existing ones. Players generally start with slower and cheaper cars and build up a garage featuring faster and more expensive cars as they progress through the game. Newer installments in the series have also included an online multiplayer element, which features both competitive and casual play. Notable competitions held on &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; include the Gran Turismo World Series and the former GT Academy.

&quot;Gran Turismo&quot; is one of PlayStation&#x27;s most successful franchises, having garnered both commercial success and critical acclaim. The first title in the series was the highest selling game for the original PlayStation, while four subsequent installments have been among the top-three best-selling games for their respective consoles. Multiple entries in the series have been ranked among the greatest video games of all time. In 2023, the series received a film adaptation, and it became a sport for the Olympic Esports with the backing of the FIA. Many car manufacturers have designed concept cars specifically for the series, and it has partnerships with Brembo, Michelin, Mazda, Toyota Gazoo Racing, Genesis and Fanatec. In 2024 Mercedes-AMG recognized &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; as part of sim racing.

==Gameplay==
The &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series is known for its accurate driving physics emulation, a large number of licensed vehicles, attention to vehicle detail, the ability to tune a car&#x27;s performance, and realistic graphics. Its physics emulation includes &quot;real-world dynamics such as weight transfer, suspension response, and understeer/oversteer characteristics&quot;. The Sim has been a flagship for the PlayStation console&#x27;s graphics capabilities, and is often used to demonstrate the system&#x27;s potential. It has a replay system shown with a cinematic presentation. The physics of the vehicles are based on their real-life counterparts, and they are represented in the PlayStation controllers&#x27; rumble features and in specialized racing wheels designed for &quot;Gran Turismo and sim racing&quot;.Although &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; has an arcade mode, most gameplay derives from its simulation mode. Players start with a certain number of credits, usually 10,000, which are used to purchase vehicles from several manufacturer-specific shops, or (more likely at the beginning) from used car dealers, and then tune their car at the appropriate parts store for best performance. Certain events are open only to particular types of vehicles. In order to enter and progress through more difficult races, a license-testing system has been implemented, which guides players through skill development. Players may apply prize money won in events to upgrade their existing car or buy a new one, collecting a garage of vehicles. &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; was the first modern simulator of the 21st century to promote racing with a wheel, instead of a controller.

==History==

The series&#x27; origins can be traced back to 1992, when Kazunori Yamauchi, at the time an employee at Sony Computer Entertainment Japan, started developing the original &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; with a team named Polys Entertainment; that started with five people and eventually became seventeen. The development took five years to complete. In comparison to the era&#x27;s other racing games, which had &quot;over-simplified&quot; arcade-style racing with exaggerated car movement, &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; is a complex racing simulator. Sony initially rejected Yamauchi&#x27;s pitch for a realistic racing sim. However, his team was still working on it as a side project. After the success of the team&#x27;s other arcade racing games, &quot;Motor Toon Grand Prix&quot; and &quot;Motor Toon Grand Prix 2&quot;, he pitched the idea to Sony again, and they accepted it.The first &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; essentially has role-playing elements; players start the sim with &quot;entry-level cars&quot; which can be upgraded over time, and faster cars can be bought with prize money from winning races. The complexities of the simulation are taught to the player through in-sim driving tests. It has a realistic visual style which demonstrated the PlayStation&#x27;s visual capabilities, and had a roster of licensed vehicles larger than any other sim at the time, at 150. The vehicles can also be customized. The game&#x27;s content was accessible via icons in a hub world. The sim was released for the PlayStation in Japan in 1997, 1998 for North America, Europe, and other territories. By mid-1998, it had sold two million copies in Japan. Polyphony Digital was founded shortly after the sims&#x27;s release. &quot;Gran Turismo 2&quot; was released for the PlayStation in Japan and North America in 1999, and PAL regions in 2000. Players could now compete in rally events, and had a larger roster of cars, at 650. Seven tracks are available for racing, two of them available in reversed layouts. The size of the sim meant it had to be put onto two discs.

The next four sims were released on PlayStation 2 (PS2). &quot;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec&quot; was released in 2001, originally titled &quot;Gran Turismo 2000&quot;. The player can maintain their car by changing its oil and washing it in the new &quot;GT Auto&quot; area. Endurance events are racing marathons where the player drives around the same track for a long time, performing pit stops, with the winning prize being a new car. Three versions of a spin-off sim, &quot;Gran Turismo Concept&quot;, were released in 2002: &quot;Gran Turismo Concept: 2001 Tokyo, Gran Turismo Concept: 2002 Tokyo-Seoul&quot;, and &quot;Gran Turismo Concept: 2002 Tokyo-Geneva&quot;. &quot;Gran Turismo 4 Prologue&quot; was released in 2003. The series&#x27; subtitle has been &quot;The Real Driving Simulator&quot; since the first &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;, according to Polyphony Digital. The sim&#x27;s list was significantly larger than &quot;A-Spec&quot;&#x27;s, at 700. The hub world was expanded to be much larger. New modes included a photography mode, and a mode where the player acts as a &quot;mogul&quot; of an AI racer the player employs. The AI racer, known as the &quot;B driver&quot;, races on the player&#x27;s behalf, and gains driving skills over their career. They can perform endurance events.

A youth-focused &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; was announced in November 2004 with a scheduled release date of 2005, though the sim was not released at that time. In September 2006, Kazunori Yamauchi confirmed the sim was still in development. In April 2008, while discussing plans for &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot;, Kazunori Yamauchi was quoted as saying, &quot;we&#x27;re hoping to make &quot;Gran Turismo for Boys&quot; a feature within &quot;GT5&quot;.&quot; In a 2013 interview with GTPlanet, Kazunori Yamauchi said that the 2009 game &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; was a rendition of the &quot;Gran Turismo for Boys&quot; idea, and there was no need for a separate sim.Sony demonstrated an updated version of &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot;, &quot;Vision Gran Turismo&quot;, at E3 2005, and it would be the basis for &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot; when it released years later. Yamauchi said that developing for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) was a &quot;nightmare&quot;, and the game&#x27;s release was delayed multiple times. &quot;Gran Turismo 4 Online Test Version&quot;, Polyphony&#x27;s test of future series development, was released for the PS2 in 2006&quot;.&quot; It featured online play, which was a feature cut out of &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot; mid-development. When online, players could join races seeking entrants, look at other players&#x27; profiles, or join up a chat room to talk over private races with up to 100 people at once. &quot;Gran Turismo HD Concept&quot;, a demo, was the first PS3 sim in the series, and released in 2006. It had ten playable cars and one track.

Since &quot;Gran Turismo 5 Prologue&quot; launched on the PS3 in 2007, the series has included online play. The sim enabled users to race online with up to 16 players on track at once.

Another installment titled simply &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; was released for the PlayStation Portable in 2009. It has 800 cars and 35 tracks, each track having a reversed layout version. It also does not have the series&#x27; traditional career mode; instead, IGN wrote, it was &quot;just racing&quot;. &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot; was shown off at E3 2009, and released for the PS3 in 2010. It was the first game in the series to have the GT Academy, a former initiative in which players of the game could became real-life motorsport racers. According to Yamauchi, the cars in the first two sims were made from 300 polygons, while those in &quot;Gran Turismo 3&quot; and &quot;4&quot; were made up of 4,000 polygons, and the &quot;premium cars&quot; in &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot; were made up of 500,000 (&quot;standard cars&quot; are slightly more detailed versions of those in &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot;). &quot;Gran Turismo 6&quot; was released for the PS3 in 2013, and was unannounced until shortly before its release. It released after the PlayStation 4 (PS4) was already out, which resulted from the same development issues that effected &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot;. Players now had 1,200 cars to drive with.
Yamauchi said the PS4 was much easier to develop for.&quot; Gran Turismo Sport&quot; was then released for the console in 2017. The sim was the first in the series to focus on online-only racing, meaning it has no single-player mode. It also did not include a career mode, and thus, the idea of &quot;car ownership&quot;. The sim received post-release content at no charge, including cars and tracks, along with offline events, as well as bug fixes. The most recent sim in the series, &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot;, was revealed at the PS5 Future of Gaming event in 2020. The title was developed for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, and was released in 2022. The sim brought back the series&#x27; usual career mode.

=== Other releases ===
During Christmas 1998, a special promotional demo of &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; was included with the PlayStation console. The demo was limited to an Arcade Mode race at Clubman Stage Route 5 with three cars (Subaru Impreza WRX, Honda NSX, and Chevrolet Corvette), with the race limited to ninety seconds. Other demos existed in other regions with different restrictions.

&quot;Gran Turismo 2000&quot; was a demo on display at E3 2000 and 2001, promoting the capabilities of the PlayStation 2. Due to a delay in the release date, the name of the final version of the sim was changed to &quot;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec&quot;. A demo version of the sim was given out for the visitors of &quot;PlayStation Festival 2000&quot;, allowing the players to drive a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution V in Seattle Circuit for two minutes.

In the summer of 2004, Toyota sent a demo disc of GT4 along with a marketing brochure for its 2004 Prius hybrid car by way of customer request from their website. The demo was also given out at a presentation of the Toyota MTRC at the New York International Auto Show. The demo disc featured only two cars, namely the Prius and the Toyota MTRC concept car. Two tracks were included, Fuji Speedway (&#x27;90s version) and Grand Canyon rally track, but each was limited to two minutes of play time. Toyota stopped offering the demo discs when the requests for the marketing brochure became disproportional to the real interest in their cars. The disc became a collectible item for Prius owners and is still sometimes available via auction at eBay. The game ran on a modified GT4P engine.

The &quot;Gran Turismo 4 – BMW 1-Series &quot;demo disc features two models of the BMW 1 Series (120i and 120d), and three &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot; tracks – including the Nürburgring (driving around this circuit was limited to three minutes). BMW customers in the United Kingdom who ordered a 1-series before its official release date were invited to a private event at the Rockingham Motor Speedway in Northamptonshire. On departure from the event, all guests were given a pack containing the demo disc. The game ran on a modified pre-release GT4 engine.

With the release of the Nissan Micra Roma, Nissan distributed a press kit for each concessionaire in several countries in Europe to promote the car. This press kit included several photographs, a press information booklet and three discs. One of the discs included in this kit is an official &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; demo named Nissan Micra Edition. Similarly, the &quot;Gran Turismo – Nissan 350Z Edition&quot; demo disc also comes in one of the many press kits available for the Nissan 350Z in the United States. There is no confirmation that a European version exists. The press kit containing the game demo comes with two other discs inside a silver folder. An additional booklet with information and pictures of the Nissan 350Z is also included. The game ran on a modified &quot;Gran Turismo Concept&quot; engine and races are limited on 150 seconds. Only Côte d&#x27;Azur, not available in &quot;Gran Turismo Concept&quot; but available in &quot;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec&quot;, was the available course.

&quot;Tourist Trophy&quot; is a motorcycle racing sim released on 26 January 2006. It was designed by Polyphony Digital. It was largely created off of the &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot; sim engine. &quot;Tourist Trophy&quot; is one of only four titles for the PlayStation 2 that is capable of 1080i output, the others being &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot; and the Japanese version of &quot;Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria&quot;. Polyphony Digital reused the physics engine, graphical user interface and all but one of the circuits found in &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot;. The number of AI racers was reduced from the series&#x27; usual five to only three. &quot;Tourist Trophy&quot; also uses the License School feature that was popularized by the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series, as well as the Photo Mode introduced in &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot;. The B-spec mode, which appeared in &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot;, was removed from &quot;Tourist Trophy&quot;.

The &quot;Gran Turismo Academy Time Trial&quot; demo was released on 17 December 2009. It featured the Indianapolis GP Circuit for the first time in the franchise&#x27;s history and also included a tuned and stock Nissan 370Z. The object of the Time Trial was as the first stage of the 2010 GT Academy to find two of the best &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; drivers to end up competing in a real racing car in a real racing series. The demo showed off a new physics model and some graphical improvements to &quot;GT5 Prologue&quot; but was also criticised. Its primary objective was as the first stage of the 2010 GT Academy and not as a demonstration of the upcoming &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot;.

==Related products==
Polyphony Digital has collaborated with peripherals manufacturer Logitech and auto parts maker Sparco to design official driving simulator kits for the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; franchise. The most recent product designation is Driving Force GT. Two other racing wheels are compatible with&quot; Gran Turismo&quot;.

In 2009, radio-control model car company HPI Racing released an official RC car tie-in: the HPI E10 RTR Ford GT LM Race Car Spec II designed by Gran Turismo (200mm), a pre-built officially licensed radio-control car kit built to look exactly like the cover car for &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot; . Plans for future releases include releasing more kits to replicate other &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; cover cars.

== Sponsorships and partnerships with the car industry ==

&quot;Gran Turismo&quot; lead to greater involvement of the car industry in racing sims . The series increased sales of several of its playable cars, including the Mistubishi Lancer Evolution VIII. The first seven models of the Lancer Evolution series were only sold in Japan, and the eighth model was brought to America in a decision Mitsubishi said was partially inspired by the popularity of the game. The TVR car brand from the United Kingdom increased six-fold in sales after its inclusion in the first game. The series has partnerships with Japan Race Promotion, Brembo, Michelin, Mazda, Toyota Gazoo Racing, BBS, and Fanatec. The series has worked with Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen, Nissan, Chaparral, Subaru, Mazda, Infiniti, Alpine, Dodge, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Ferrari, and various other car manufactures to come up with cars for the future with the Vision Gran Turismo project. Participating manufacturers in the Gran Turismo World Series are Alfa Romeo, AMG, Aston Martin, Audi, BMW, Chevrolet, Citroën, Dodge, Ferrari, Ford, Genesis, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar, Lamborghini, Lexus, Mazda, McLaren, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Peugeot, Porsche, Renault, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota, and Volkswagen.

The series has been involved in sponsoring various sporting events and teams, including Super GT, Super Formula, the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb as of November 2014, D1GP since the 2008 season, the 2004 Race of Champions, the first chicane on the Mulsanne Straight at Circuit de la Sarthe until 2012, and racing teams/drivers such as Prost Grand Prix, Pescarolo Sport, Audi/Oreca, Peugeot, Abt Sportsline, Signatech-Nissan, Audi A4 DTM, Vita4One-BMW Z4, Aston Martin Rapide S, Igor Fraga, Lewis Hamilton, and Sébastien Loeb. In 2009, a &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;-themed cafe opened at the Twin Ring Motegi racetrack. The series also performed as technical support for cars in the LMP1 class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

==Competitions==
===GT Academy===
The GT Academy was a driver discovery/development program initiated through a partnership between Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, Polyphony Digital, and Nissan Europe. The program lasted from 2008 to 2016.Online qualifiers were held within &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;, with the top qualifiers being invited to National Finals in each participating country. The top winners of each country were sent to a Race Camp held at Silverstone, UK for the final selection. The winners were to undergo an intensive Driver Development Program designed by Nissan with the intention to train and license them into a professional driver, competing in races worldwide. The four winning drivers were to join the Nismo Global Driver Exchange and go on to race in the following years&#x27; Dubai 24 Hour. Winners of the Gran Turismo Academy include Lucas Ordóñez, Jordan Tresson and Jann Mardenborough, who have all gone on to compete in professional real-life racing. Some of these winners, who would normally be seen as &quot;non-professionals&quot;, have received praise relating to how they are as skilled as drivers with years of experience. Based on this merit, four GT Academy drivers have been barred entry to the British GT (specifically the &#x27;gentleman driver&#x27; section of the competition).

===Gran Turismo World Series===
The Gran Turismo World Series is a series of &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; tournaments held around the world since 2018. The competition was known as the FIA Certified Gran Turismo Championships until the end of the 2021 season.

===Olympic Virtual Series===
In 2021, the FIA and the International Olympic Committee collaborated and hosted the Olympic Virtual Series, in which &quot;Gran Turismo Sport&quot; was used as one of the games used to host the motorsport event. The motorsport virtual series was an online time trial competition, in which entry is open to all players of Gran Turismo Sport&#x27;s Sport Mode.

In 2023, it was announced that Gran Turismo would be a part of the Olympics Esports Series 2023 as the motorsport event. &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; was used for the inaugural Olympic Esports Week motorsport event in Singapore, held from 22 June to 25 June, and the final was won by France&#x27;s Kylian Drumont.

==Reception==

The &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; sim series has been one of the most popular over its lifetime, appealing to an audience ranging from amateur to professional sim racers like Igor Fraga.

In 2017, &quot;Edge&quot; said the first &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; was one of the 10 greatest video games of the last 20 years. &quot;Gran Turismo 2&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot;, and &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot; have all been named by different organizations as one of the best games of all time. &quot;Gran Turismo Sport&#x27;s&quot; changes to series tradition were initially controversial among fans, but it ultimately became a popular game for esports competitions.&quot;&quot; &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; was strongly criticized by players for its implementation of microtransactions and a &quot;pay-to-play&quot; system. The user score in Metacritic as of 20 March 2022 is 2.2 out of 10, which is Sony&#x27;s lowest user rating and the lowest score in PlayStation exclusive history on the site to date.

Because of the success of the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series, Guinness World Records awarded the series seven world records in the &quot;Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008&quot;. These records include &quot;Largest Number of Cars in a Racing Game&quot;, &quot;Highest Selling PlayStation Game&quot;, &quot;Oldest Car in a Racing Game&quot;, and &quot;Largest Instruction Guide for a Racing Game&quot;. The success of the series has led to other studios creating simulation racing games similar to the franchise. An early example was &quot;Advan Racing&quot; by Atlus, which was released for the original PlayStation in November 1998. Sega&#x27;s answer to the franchise, &quot;Sega GT&quot;, was released on the short-lived Dreamcast console and later had a sequel on the original Xbox before the franchise died off after low sales. Turn 10 would later create the &quot;Forza Motorsport&quot; series for the Xbox consoles, which later saw releases on Windows, which has been often seen as the primary rival of the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series. Other similar titles include &quot;Driving Emotion Type-S&quot; by Square and &quot;Enthusia Professional Racing&quot; by Konami.

In 2005, Maeda Corporation, in association with Tokyo University of Science, researched the feasibility of making a real-life replica version of the fictional Grand Valley Speedway used in the series.

In acknowledgment of the Mount Panorama Circuit&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Gran Turismo 6&quot;, the City of Bathurst in Australia unveiled a new street called Gran Turismo Drive in December 2013. Mayor of Bathurst, Gary Rush said &quot;Driving a lap of our world famous motor racing circuit is a life changing experience for those who have the chance, and the Bathurst Regional Council is very excited about opening up the Mount Panorama experience through the launch of &quot;Gran Turismo 6&quot;.&quot; Also in 2013, series creator Kazunori Yamauchi had a street named in honor of him in the city of Ronda, Spain. Named Paseo de Kazunori Yamauchi, the street snakes around the Parador de Ronda. According to Ronda&#x27;s city mayor Maria de la Paz Fernandez Lobato, &quot;There is no doubt that his work has a huge cultural resonance with people today. He has driven the racing game genre to new levels of realism and his creations are as much art as technology. Ronda’s association with &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; is also a reflection that our ancient city is a modern, vibrant place to live and very much part of the 21st century.&quot;

=== Sales ===
As of 16 November 2022, more than 90 million copies of &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; titles have been sold. It is the highest-selling sim series on PlayStation consoles. The first &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; sold just under 11 million copies, making it the highest-selling sim on the original PlayStation. Gran Turismo 2 is the third-best selling sim on the console, at 9 million. As of 2022, &quot;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec&quot; was the highest-selling out of the entire series, at 15 million copies. It was also the second-highest selling game on the PS2, behind &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;. &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot; was the third best-selling game on the console. &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot; was the second-highest selling out of the entire series, which IGN attributes to the long wait between the series&#x27; main installments. Gran Turismo 6 sold half-the copies of the previous game, being even lower than &quot;5 Prologue&quot;.
==Films==
===Documentary===
At the Jalopnik Film Festival, Kazunori announced a documentary film covering the past 15 years of the game series up until that point, titled &quot;KAZ: Pushing The Virtual Divide&quot;. It was released on 22 January 2014 on Hulu.

===Adaptation===

In 2013, Sony Pictures announced it was developing a &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; film with Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti producing it, with a script by Alex Tse. In 2015, Joseph Kosinski was set to direct the film, with a new screenplay by Jon and Erich Hoeber. By 2018, the Kosinski version was no longer moving forward.

On 26 May 2022, a new iteration of the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; film was revealed to be in development, with Neill Blomkamp eyed to direct. On 14 June 2022, it was confirmed that Blomkamp would direct and announced that the film would be released on 11 August 2023, which is intended to be a non-fiction &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; focusing on GT Academy 2011 graduate Jann Mardenborough and his transition from gamer to race car driver. It was also confirmed that Jason Hall and Zach Baylin would write the screenplay. Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Doug Belgrad and Dana Brunetti will serve as producers. David Harbour is set to star in the film as Jack Salter, who teaches Mardenborough how to drive a real car. Archie Madekwe will play Jann Mardenborough, with Orlando Bloom as Danny Moore. Filming began in November 2022 in Hungary, and wrapped in December. Darren Barnet will play a racer who is ranked at the top at the GT academy and who is not thrilled to see Mardenborough excel. Both Djimon Hounsou and Geri Halliwell-Horner will play Mardenborough&#x27;s parents and Daniel Puig as his brother, Josha Stradowski as Mardenborough&#x27;s rival and Thomas Kretschmann as his father.

<text>Vitis vinifera, the common grape vine, is a species of flowering plant, native to the Mediterranean region, Central Europe, and southwestern Asia, from Morocco and Portugal north to southern Germany and east to northern Iran. , there were between 5,000 and 10,000 varieties of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; grapes though only a few are of commercial significance for wine and table grape production.

The wild grape is often classified as &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; &quot;sylvestris&quot; (in some classifications considered &quot;Vitis sylvestris&quot;), with &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; &quot;vinifera&quot; restricted to cultivated forms. Domesticated vines have hermaphrodite flowers, but &quot;sylvestris&quot; is dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants) and pollination is required for fruit to develop.

Grapes can be eaten fresh or dried to produce raisins, sultanas, and currants. Grape leaves are used in the cuisine of many cultures. The fresh grapes can also be processed into juice that is fermented to make wine and vinegar. Cultivars of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; form the basis of the majority of wines produced around the world. All of the familiar wine varieties belong to &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;, which is cultivated on every continent except for Antarctica, and in all the major wine regions of the world.

== History ==
===Prehistory===
Changes in pip (seed) shape (narrower in domesticated forms) and distribution point to domestication occurring about 4100–3000 BC, in southwest Asia, South Caucasus (Armenia and Georgia), or the Western Black Sea shore region (Bulgaria, Romania). The earliest evidence of domesticated grapes has been found at Gadachrili Gora, near the village of Imiri, Marneuli Municipality, in southeastern Georgia; carbon-dating points to the date of about 6000 BC. The oldest winery in the world (dating to 4100BCE) was found in the Areni-1 cave, which lies in Areni, Armenia. Grape pips dating back to the 5th–4th millennium BC were also found in Shulaveri; others dating back to the 4th millennium BC were also found in Khizanaant Gora. Wild grapes were harvested by neolithic foragers and early farmers. For thousands of years, the fruit has been harvested for both medicinal and nutritional value; its history is intimately entwined with the history of wine.

===Antiquity===
Cultivation of the domesticated grape spread to other parts of the Old World in pre-historic or early historic times. The first written accounts of grapes and wine can be found in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, an ancient Sumerian text from the 3rd millennium BC. There are also numerous hieroglyphic references from ancient Egypt, according to which wine was reserved exclusively for priests, state functionaries and the pharaoh.

The grapevine is referenced 55 times in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), along with grapes and wine, which are also frequently mentioned (55 and 19, respectively). The Bible lists the grapevine as one of the Seven Species of the Land of Israel, and frequently uses it as a symbol of the Israelites as the chosen people. A detailed description of vineyard maintenance is provided in the Book of Isaiah (5:1–7).
Hesiod in his Works and Days gives detailed descriptions of grape harvests and wine making techniques, and there are also many references in Homer. Greek colonists then introduced these practices in their colonies, especially in southern Italy (Magna Graecia), which was even known as Enotria due to its propitious climate.

The Etruscans improved wine making techniques and developed an export trade even beyond the Mediterranean basin. The ancient Romans further developed the techniques learnt from the Etruscans, as shown by numerous works of literature containing information that remains valid: &quot;De Agri Cultura&quot; (around 160 BC) by Cato the Elder, &quot;De re rustica&quot; by Marcus Terentius Varro, the &quot;Georgics&quot; by Virgil and &quot;De re rustica&quot; by Columella.

During the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, the long crisis of the Roman Empire generated instability in the countryside which led to a reduction of viticulture in general, which was mainly sustained only close to towns and cities and along coastlines.

===Medieval era===
Between the 5th and 10th centuries, viticulture was sustained almost exclusively by the different religious orders in monasteries. The Benedictines and others extended the grape growing limit northwards and also planted new vineyards at higher altitudes than was customary before. Apart from &#x27;ecclesiastical&#x27; viticulture, there also developed, especially in France, a &#x27;noble&#x27; viticulture, practiced by the aristocracy as a symbol of prestige. Grape growing was a significant economic activity in the Middle east up to the 7th century, when the expansion of Islam caused it to decline.

===Early modern period===
Between the Low Middle Ages and the Renaissance, viticulture began to flourish again. Demographic pressure, population concentration in towns and cities, and the increased spending power of artisans and merchants gave rise to increased investment in viticulture, which became economically feasible once more. Much was written during the Renaissance on grape growing and wine production, favouring a more scientific approach. This literature can be considered the origin of modern ampelography.

Grapes followed European colonies around the world, coming to North America around the 17th century, and to Africa, South America and Australia. In North America it formed hybrids with native species from the genus &quot;Vitis&quot;; some of these were intentional hybrids created to combat &quot;phylloxera&quot;, an insect pest which affected the European grapevine to a much greater extent than North American ones and in fact managed to devastate European wine production in a matter of years. Later, North American rootstocks became widely used to graft &quot;V. vinifera&quot; cultivars so as to withstand the presence of phylloxera.

===Contemporary period===
In the second half of the 20th century there was a shift in attitude in viticulture from traditional techniques to the scientific method based on fields such as microbiology, chemistry and ampelography. This change came about also due to changes in economic and cultural aspects and in the way of life and in the consumption habits of wide sectors of the population starting to demand quality products.

In 2007, &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; was the fourth angiosperm species whose genome was completely sequenced. These data contributed significantly to understanding the evolution of plants and also how the aromatic characteristics of wine are determined in part by the plant&#x27;s genes. This work was a collaboration between Italian researchers (Consorzio Interuniversitario Nazionale per la Biologia Molecolare delle Piante, Istituto di Genomica Applicata) and French researchers (Genoscope and Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique).

Also in 2007, scientists from Australia&#x27;s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), working in the Cooperative Research Centre for Viticulture, reported that their &quot;research suggests that extremely rare and independent mutations in two genes [&quot;VvMYBA1&quot; and &quot;VvMYBA2&quot; of red grapes] produced a single white grapevine that was the parent of almost all of the world&#x27;s white grape varieties. If only one gene had been mutated, most grapes would still be red and we would not have the more than 3000 white grape cultivars available today.&quot;

==Description==

It is a liana growing tall at a fast rate. Having a flaky bark, its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, deciduous, with 3 to 5 pointed lobes, coarsely prickly-toothed leaf margins and a heart-shaped foot, long and broad. They are glossy dark green on top, light green below, usually hairless.

The vine attaches to supports by tendrils. The stems, called twigs, grow through their tip, the cauline apex. A branch consists of several internodes separated by knots, which grow the leaves, flowers, tendrils and between-core and where to train future buds. During their hardening, the twigs become woody branches that can reach a great length. Its roots usually sink to a depth of 2 to 5 meters and sometimes up to 12–15 meters or even more.

The species typically occurs in humid forests and streamsides.

===Inflorescences===
Their flowers, small and greenish to white, are grouped in inflorescences and their fruits, of different shapes depending on the subspecies, are berries grouped in clusters. The calyx is single-leaf with 5 short, deciduous teeth. The corolla consists of five petals, fused at the top and base, and then falls off in its entirety. Opposite the petals there are five stamens interspersed with glands. The upper ovary bears a very short style with a button-shaped stigma. The wild vine is a dioecious plant, the male and female flowers arise on different plants, but the cultivated forms are hermaphroditic, allowing self-pollination.

The fruit is a berry, known as a grape that is ovoid or globular, dark blue or greenish, usually 2-locular with 5 seeds; in the wild species it is diameter and ripens dark purple to blackish with a pale wax bloom; in cultivated plants it is usually much larger, up to long, and can be green, red, or purple (black).

==Distribution==
&quot;V. vinifera&quot; accounts for the majority of world wine production; all of the most familiar grape varieties used for wine production belong to &quot;V. vinifera&quot;.

In Europe, &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; is concentrated in the central and southern regions; in Asia, in the western regions such as Anatolia, the Caucasus, the Middle East, and in China; in Africa, along the northern Mediterranean coast and in South Africa; in North America, in California and also other areas like Michigan, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Virginia, Washington state, British Columbia, Ontario and Québec; in South America in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru and Brazil; and in Oceania in Australia and New Zealand.

== Cultivation ==

Use of grapes is known to date back to Neolithic times, following the discovery in 1996 of 7,000-year-old wine storage jars in present-day northern Iran. Further evidence shows the Mesopotamians and Ancient Egyptians had vine plantations and winemaking skills. Greek philosophers praised the healing powers of grapes both whole and in the form of wine. &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; cultivation and winemaking in China began during the Han dynasty in the 2nd century with the importation of the species from Ta-Yuan. However, wild vine &quot;mountain grapes&quot; like &quot;Vitis thunbergii&quot; were being used for wine making before that time. In traditional medicine of India &quot;V. vinifera&quot; is used in prescriptions for cough, respiratory tract catarrh, subacute cases of enlarged liver and spleen, as well as in alcohol-based tonics (Aasavs).

In the Mediterranean Basin, leaves and young stems are traditionally used to feed sheep and goats after grapevine pruning.

Using the sap of grapevines, European folk healers sought to cure skin and eye diseases. Other historical uses include the leaves being used to stop bleeding, pain and inflammation of hemorrhoids. Unripe grapes were used for treating sore throats, and raisins were given as treatments for consumption (tuberculosis), constipation and thirst. Ripe grapes were used for the treatment of cancer, cholera, smallpox, nausea, skin and eye infections as well as kidney and liver diseases.

Seedless grape varieties were developed to appeal to consumers, but researchers are now discovering that many of the healthful properties of grapes may actually come from the seeds themselves, thanks to their enriched phytochemical content.

Grapevine leaves are filled with minced meat (such as lamb, pork or beef), rice and onions in the making of Balkan traditional dolma.

A popular cultivar in Australia, &quot;Vitis &#x27;Ornamental Grape&#x27;&quot;, derived from Vitis vinifera x Vitis rupestris, is used in gardens for its impressive foliage that turn brilliant red, scarlet, purple and/or orange in autumn. Originally bred in France, it thrives in a range of climates from hot and dry, to cool moist and subtropical, with different soil types benefitting the plant.

=== Climate change ===
Grapevines are very responsive to their surrounding environment with a seasonal variation in yield of 32.5%. Climate is one of the key controlling factors in grape and wine production, affecting the suitability of certain grape varieties to a particular region as well as the type and quality of the wine produced. Wine composition is largely dependent on the mesoclimate and the microclimate and this means that for high quality wines to be produced, a climate-soil-variety equilibrium has to be maintained. The interaction between climate-soil-variety will in some cases come under threat from the effects of climate change. Identification of genes underlying phenological variation in grape may help to maintain consistent yield of particular varieties in future climatic conditions.

Of all environmental factors, temperature seems to have the most profound effect on viticulture as the temperature during the winter dormancy affects the budding for the following growing season. Prolonged high temperature can have a negative impact on the quality of the grapes as well as the wine as it affects the development of grape components that give colour, aroma, accumulation of sugar, the loss of acids through respiration as well as the presence of other flavour compounds that give grapes their distinctive traits. Sustained intermediate temperatures and minimal day-to-day variability during the growth and ripening periods are favourable. Grapevine annual growth cycles begin in spring with bud break initiated by consistent day time temperatures of 10 degrees Celsius. The unpredictable nature of climate change may also bring occurrences of frosts which may occur outside of the usual winter periods. Frosts cause lower yields and effects grape quality due to reduction of bud fruitfulness and therefore grapevine production benefits from frost free periods.

Organic acids are essential in wine quality. The phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins and tannins help give the wine its colour, bitterness, astringency and anti-oxidant capacity. Research has shown that grapevines exposed to temperature consistently around 30 degrees Celsius had significantly lower concentrations of anthocyanins compared to grapevines exposed to temperatures consistently around 20 degrees Celsius. Temperatures around or exceeding 35 degrees Celsius are found to stall anthocyanin production as well as degrade the anthocyanins that are produced. Furthermore, anthocyanins were found to be positively correlated to temperatures between 16 – 22 degrees Celsius from veraison (change of colour of the berries) to harvest. Tannins give wine astringency and a &quot;drying in the mouth&quot; taste and also bind onto anthocyanin to give more stable molecular molecules which are important in giving long term colour in aged red wines. As the presence of phenolic compounds in wine are affected heavily by temperature, an increase in average temperatures will affect their presence in wine regions and will therefore affect grape quality.

Altered precipitation patterns are also anticipated (both annually and seasonally) with rainfall occurrences varying in amount and frequency. Increases in the amount of rainfall have will likely cause an increase in soil erosion; while occasional lack of rainfall, in times when it usually occurs, may result in drought conditions causing stress on grapevines. Rainfall is critical at the beginning of the growing season for the budburst and inflorescence development while consistent dry periods are important for the flowering and ripening periods.

Increased CO2 levels will likely have an effect on the photosynthetic activity in grapevines as photosynthesis is stimulated by a rise in CO2 and has been known to also lead to an increase leaf area and vegetative dry weight. Raised atmospheric CO2 is also believed to result in partial stomatal closure which indirectly leads to increased leaf temperatures. A rise in leaf temperatures may alter ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo) relationship with carbon dioxide and oxygen which will also affect the plants&#x27; photosynthesis capabilities. Raised atmospheric carbon dioxide is also known to decrease the stomatal density of some grapevine varieties.

==== Cultivation variations ====
The gradually increasing temperatures will lead to a shift in suitable growing regions. It is estimated that the northern boundary of European viticulture will shift north per decade up to 2020 with a doubling of this rate predicted between 2020 and 2050. This has positive and negative effects, as it opens doors to new cultivars being grown in certain regions but a loss of suitability of other cultivars and may also risk production quality and quantity in general.

==== Adapting wine production ====
Systems have been developed to manipulate the temperatures of vines. These include a chamber free system where air can be heated or cooled and then blown across grape bunches to get a differential. Mini chambers combined with shade cloth and reflective foils have also been used to manipulate the temperature and irradiance. Using polyethylene sleeves to cover cordons and canes were also found to increase maximum temperature by and decrease minimum temperature by .

== Chemistry ==
=== Phenolics ===
&quot;V. vinifera&quot; contains many phenolic compounds. Anthocyanins can be found in the skin of the berries, hydroxycinnamic acids in the pulp and condensed tannins of the proanthocyanidins type in the seeds. Stilbenoids can be found in the skin and in wood.

==== Stilbenoids ====
&quot;Trans&quot;-resveratrol is a phytoalexin produced against the growth of fungal pathogens such as &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; and delta-viniferin is another grapevine phytoalexin produced following fungal infection by &quot;Plasmopara viticola&quot;.
* Astringin

==== Anthocyanins ====
&quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; red cultivars are rich in anthocyanins that impart their colour to the berries (generally in the skin). The 5 most basic anthocyanins found in grape are:
* Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside
* Delphinidin-3-O-glucoside
* Malvidin-3-O-glucoside
* Petunidin-3-O-glucoside
* Peonidin-3-O-glucoside

Cultivars like Graciano may also contain :
; acetylated anthocyanins
* Cyanidin-3-(6-acetyl)-glucoside
* Delphinidin-3-(6-acetyl)-glucoside
* Malvidin-3-(6-acetyl)-glucoside
* Petunidin-3-(6-acetyl)-glucoside
* Peonidin-3-(6-acetyl)-glucoside

; coumaroylated anthocyanins
* Cyanidin-3-(6-p-coumaroyl)-glucoside
* Delphinidin-3-(6-p-coumaroyl)-glucoside
* Malvidin-3-(6-p-coumaroyl)-glucoside cis
* Malvidin-3-(6-p-coumaroyl)-glucoside trans
* Petunidin-3-(6-p-coumaroyl)-glucoside
* Peonidin-3-(6-p-coumaroyl)-glucoside

; caffeoylated anthocyanins
* Malvidin-3-(6-p-caffeoyl)-glucoside
* Peonidin-3-(6-p-caffeoyl)-glucoside

=== Other chemicals ===
Isoprenoid monoterpenes are present in grape, above all acyclic linalool, geraniol, nerol, citronellol, homotrienol and monocyclic α-terpineol, mostly occurring as glycosides. Carotenoids accumulate in ripening grape berries. Oxidation of carotenoids produces volatile fragments, C13-norisoprenoids. These are strongly odoriferous compounds, such as β-ionone (aroma of viola), damascenone (aroma of exotic fruits), β-damascone (aroma of rose) and β-ionol (aroma of flowers and fruits). Melatonin, an alkaloid, has been identified in grape. In addition, seeds are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, which helps lowering levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in the blood.

<text>Walker is a 1987 historical Weird Western film directed by Alex Cox and written by Rudy Wurlitzer. It stars Ed Harris as William Walker, the American filibuster who invaded and made himself president of Nicaragua. The cast also features Richard Masur, René Auberjonois, Peter Boyle, Miguel Sandoval and Marlee Matlin. 

An American-Mexican co-production, &quot;Walker&quot; was filmed in Nicaragua, during the Contra War. The film is intentionally full of postmodern anachronisms, such as helicopters, Zippo lighters, automatic rifles, Diet Coke, magazines and cars. Joe Strummer, formerly of the Clash, scored the film.

&quot;Walker&quot; was released by Universal Pictures on December 4, 1987 to generally polarized reviews and grossed nearly $300,000 against a production budget of $6 million, becoming a box-office bomb.

==Plot summary==
In 1853, soldier-of-fortune William Walker flees Mexico, after a failed attempt to incite an armed insurrection. He is placed on trial by US official for breaking the Neutrality Act, but wins on acquittal after giving a rousing speech to the jury. Walker has plans to settle down and start a newspaper, however, his fiancée Ellen Martin dies of cholera. Afterwards, American multimillionaire Cornelius Vanderbilt offers a job to Walker to bring stability to Nicaragua by assisting the Democratic Party in its civil war against the Legitimists. Doing so would secure Vanderbilt&#x27;s rights over an overland shipping route between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Walker, who is a firm believer in Manifest Destiny, accepts and hires 60 mercenaries to join him on his mission.

Despite significant losses, Walker and his corps score a bloody victory in Nicaragua, first in Rivas and then in the Conservative capital of Granada. In the midst of battle, Walker calmly strolls through the battlefield, seemingly unconcerned by the gunfire and death surrounding him. When the capital falls, Walker allows the President to stay in charge while the president&#x27;s mistress, Doña Yrena, seduces Walker. After discovering that the President is attempting to rally other countries in Central America to unite and repel the Americans, Walker orders the President executed for treason and assumes the presidency for himself via a rigged election. From 1855 to 1857, his actions as president become increasingly manic and delusional, with Walker antagonizing his financial backer by revoking Vanderbilt&#x27;s license to the overland trade route and seizing his ships. When one of Walker&#x27;s brothers challenges his authority, Walker kills him without hesitation. Cut off from supplies and reinforcements, he decides to introduce slavery to Nicaragua in an attempt to gain support among the Southern U.S. states, causing the African-American members of his legion to quit in protest. The situation continues to deteriorate as neighboring countries invade Nicaragua. Yrena returns and attempts to convince Walker to stop the carnage - when he refuses, she attempts to kill him, but fails and is forced to run away. Incensed, Walker instructs his men to burn down the town. Taking refuge in the church, Walker gives one final speech to his few remaining men and the Nicaraguan prisoners, stating that the day will never come where America will leave Nicaragua alone, as &quot;it is America&#x27;s destiny&quot; to be there.

As Walker and his men exit the church, singing &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot;, a helicopter arrives filled with American troops clad in modern-day military gear. A man from the helicopter explains that he has been ordered by the State Department to return all American citizens to their homeland. When he asks Walker what his nationality is, Walker replies &quot;I&#x27;m William Walker, President of the Republic of Nicaragua,&quot; so he is left behind. The movie ends with Walker being executed on the beach by Honduran soldiers.

As the credits roll, a television screen displays various clips of President Ronald Reagan discussing the presence of U.S. troops in Nicaragua, the U.S. military conducting &quot;training exercises&quot; off the coast of Nicaragua, and a woman washing the dead bodies of Contras victims.

==Production==
Alex Cox first visited Nicaragua in 1984, during the national election campaign for which Daniel Ortega became president, to see if conditions were as bad as the American media had reported. He discovered that this was not the case. The filmmaker was persuaded to return by two wounded soldiers from the Sandinista army. He later learned of the historical Walker from an article in &quot;Mother Jones&quot; that was largely about US foreign policy in Central America and decided to bring his story to the screen. A history professor at the University of California lent Cox a library card so he could do more research on Walker. &quot;The more I read about him the more bizarre this seemed&quot;, Cox remembers. He hired Rudy Wurlitzer to write the screenplay because, according to Cox: &quot;He understands American guys and the mad impulse that drives certain Americans to be great men.&quot; Cox was not interested in making what he called a long, respectful historical drama that would be shown on &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; because Walker &quot;leads a disastrous misadventure. He&#x27;s a pretty bad guy. I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to approach it in this normal, historical, respectful style.&quot;

The budget was set at six million dollars with most of the film being shot in Granada, Nicaragua. To get into character, Ed Harris led the entire cast in a 10-mile (16.1-km) forced march through the Nicaraguan countryside. The actor was drawn to the challenge of playing someone &quot;who has incredible moral convictions but turns into such an evil person in the name of spreading democracy.&quot; He was also drawn to the script&#x27;s politics, claiming to be anti-Contra and anti-intervention in Nicaragua and saw making a film there as a way to possibly stop the bloodshed.

Cox got the cooperation of the Sandinista government and the Roman Catholic Church because he wanted his production to be a &quot;force for peace and reconciliation.&quot; The Guatemalan government, apparently in a desire to please America, held up Cox at the Nicaraguan border for a week with his entire cast and crew, obliterating his budget. Cox, producer Edward R. Pressman, and leading actor Ed Harris all donated from their own wages in order to bring the film back on track. After a report that Cox was shooting in Nicaragua appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the film bond company sent an inspector and threatened to pull the bond multiple times, requiring Cox to respond with legal threats while filming continued. The delays also meant there was limited time for reshooting. One scene where both of Walker&#x27;s brothers were supposed to be present only had one appear on set. On another day, Ed Harris ad-libbed an entire speech about how America will &quot;be back&quot; and will never &quot;leave Nicaragua alone&quot;. This was filmed &quot;just in case&quot; and ended up appearing in the final film.

The dying economy of Granada received a significant boost by the production with 300 local carpenters hired to build sets, 6,000 people hired as extras and army supplied security guards and a Soviet-built MI-18 transport helicopter used in the film. Electricity poles in the town plaza were torn down leaving homes without light. Some families were left temporarily without a telephone because the production needed their lines and the government could not afford to install new ones. The central square was covered with several inches of dirt to recreate 1850s conditions. The screenplay was edited by the country&#x27;s Vice-President Sergio Ramirez and Minister of Culture Ernesto Cardenal, who were also a novelist and a poet respectively. Both men, along with the Minister of Education, the country&#x27;s Interior Minister, and a military commander, would occasionally visit the set. Two people were accidentally killed during principal photography, both in separate vehicular-related incidents. For one of the deaths, the movie company paid for the funeral and compensated the family. The shooting conditions were difficult because of all of the fires the locals were building, making the air thick and hard to breathe.

Even after filming was over, Cox stayed in Granada, editing the film. He said: &quot;I think we have kind of a duty not to just be the rich gringos and come down here and spend eight weeks and then disappear.&quot;

==Historical accuracy==
As noted by Roger Ebert in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times:&quot; &quot;... anachronisms, guest stars, quixotic poker-faced heroes and utterly pointless scripts&quot;, were the hallmark of films helmed by Cox. There are a number of intentional anachronisms placed to draw comparison between 1850s and 1980s Nicaragua. For example, the characters are shown reading &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;, and a computer monitor is visible in Vanderbilt&#x27;s study. As the movie progresses, the inaccuracies become more and more extreme and it is evident that Cox was using the device to accentuate modern-day events with the Walker era.

Historical accuracy is done away with in a dramatic retelling of Walker&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état. There is no evidence that Walker ever met Vanderbilt or received his support, as the movie suggests. Rather, Walker was supported by Vanderbilt&#x27;s competitors, Charles Morgan and Cornelius Garrison, owners of the Nicaragua Transit Company in his time. James Buchanan is incorrectly mentioned as being the President of the United States after Walker&#x27;s trial, prior to his Nicaraguan expedition. Franklin Pierce was actually the president at the time. Ellen Martin, Walker&#x27;s fiancée, died in 1850. In the movie, she is present at his 1854 trial for violating US neutrality laws, after he invaded Baja California and Sonora Mexico, dying shortly thereafter.

Minor inconsistencies include use of bolt-action rifles, weapons from the World War I era, and Navy Colts in Walker&#x27;s army, not in general use, until midway through the American Civil War, almost a decade later, but it was obvious that Cox was little concerned with historical accuracy.

==Soundtrack==

Joe Strummer had worked previously with Cox on &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; and &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;, contributing songs to their respective soundtracks. He wanted to compose an entire score for a film and &quot;Walker&quot; afforded him such an opportunity. After filming his small part in the film, he would go back to his room and record bits of music onto a four-track cassette using an acoustic guitar and a little plastic synthesizer with guitarist Zander Schloss. They drew inspiration from local music played in bars – a mix of reggae, calypso and Brazilian music.

==Reception==
&quot;Walker&quot; originally garnered polarized reviews. Rita Kempley wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s gross as it is muddled as it is absurd&quot; in her review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Fellow &quot;Washington Post&quot; reviewer Desson Howe criticized the &quot;perplexing fusion of cartoon and docudrama...&quot; In his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen wrote that &quot;[Cox&#x27;s] scenes have no shape, his characters are stick figures, the wit is undergraduate and his soggy set pieces of slow-motion carnage are third-rate Peckinpah imitations.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film zero stars and called it &quot;unquestionably one of the worst films of the year, made even more shocking because it was directed by the often inventive Alex Cox.&quot; Gene Siskel&#x27;s cohost Roger Ebert also gave the film a rare zero-star rating and each critic gave it a thumbs down.

However Jay Scott gave the film a positive review in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, arguing that &quot;Cox exposes the limitations of historical drama in &quot;Walker&quot; with a calculated disregard of its conventions.&quot; Vincent Canby also praised Cox&#x27;s film in &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing that &quot;&quot;Walker&quot; is witty, rather than laugh-out-loud funny. Without being solemn, it&#x27;s deadly serious... &quot;Walker&quot; is something very rare in American movies these days. It has some nerve.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote in &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; that the film was &quot;all over the place and excessive, but as a radical statement about the U.S.’s involvement in [Nicaragua] it packs a very welcome wallop...One can certainly quarrel with some aspects of the film’s treatment of history, but with political cowardice in commercial filmmaking so prevalent, one can only admire this movie’s gusto in calling a spade a spade, and the exhilaration of its anger and wit.&quot; Jim Hoberman praised it in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; as &quot;a superbly scurrilous and daringly self-destructive attack on the Reagan regime’s Central American policies (and the Monroe Doctrine as well). In his burlesque retelling the story of William Walker, 19th century “freebooter” who ruled Nicaragua, Cox refuses to recreate the past — or even dignify it.&quot; Ben Sachs in &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; would later observe that the film&#x27;s reputation had grown steadily since its release and was now regarded as &quot;one of the key films of its era.&quot;

Director Alex Cox was never employed again by a major Hollywood studio, and his subsequent films have received only limited distribution in the United States. In a 2008 interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Cox said: &quot;Distribution is controlled by the studios, and I&#x27;ve been on the blacklist of the studios for the last 20 years... The last movie I was asked to direct was &quot;The Running Man&quot;... which was actually quite a good film, I thought. I would have liked to have done &quot;The Running Man&quot;. It was just that &quot;Walker&quot; happened at the same time.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Walker&quot; presently holds a rating of 44% from 16 reviews.

<doc id="413427" wikidata="Q6512434" url="?curid=413427" title="Lectures on Faith">
<text>&quot;Lectures on Faith&quot; is a set of seven lectures on the doctrine and theology of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first published as the doctrine portion of the 1835 edition of the canonical Doctrine and Covenants (D&amp;C), but later removed from that work by both major branches of the faith. The lectures were originally presented by Joseph Smith to a group of elders in a course known as the &quot;School of the Prophets&quot; in the early winter of 1834–35 in Kirtland, Ohio.

==Authorship==

Although authorship of the lectures is uncertain, studies suggest that the actual wording was largely by Sidney Rigdon, with substantial involvement and approval by Smith and possibly others. Smith was involved, both in their authorship in November 1834 and in their later preparation for publication in January 1835.

The original title of each lecture was &quot;Of Faith&quot;. It was not until 1876, in an edition of the D&amp;C edited by Church Historian, Orson Pratt, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), that the title was given as &quot;Lectures on Faith&quot;.

==Key lecture points==
===Lecture 1===
Faith gives rise to all human endeavors in both worldly and spiritual matters, and is a source of power, both in man and in God.

===Lecture 2===
The human family&#x27;s knowledge of God began with God&#x27;s interaction with Adam before &quot;The Fall&quot;, which knowledge was retained after &quot;The Fall&quot;, and which knowledge has been transmitted via human testimony among Adam&#x27;s descendants. Although people since Adam have had to rely on human testimony to learn about God, God can choose to reveal himself directly (as he did to Adam) to those who live a life of devout prayer and service to God.

===Lecture 3===
In addition to a belief in God, a correct knowledge of God&#x27;s character and attributes as revealed in scripture is necessary for the exercise of faith leading to life and salvation. Effective faith requires the following understanding of God&#x27;s characteristics:

*That He was God before the world was created, and the same God that he was after the world was created;
*That God is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abundant in goodness, and that He was so from everlasting, and will be so until everlasting;
*That God is unchanging;
*That He is a God of truth;
*That God is no respecter of persons;
*That God is love.

===Lecture 4===
From scripture, one can learn that God possesses the following attributes: knowledge, faith (which is His power), justice, judgement, mercy, and truth. An explanation for why each attribute is necessary in order for mankind to be able to exercise productive faith is provided.

===Lecture 5===
The Godhead, or the collective persons of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, is expounded upon:

#The Godhead consists of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost ()
#There are two &quot;personages&quot;, the Father and the Son, that constitute the &quot;supreme power over all things&quot; (, Q&amp;A section)
#The Father is a &quot;personage of spirit, glory, and power&quot; ()
#The Son is a &quot;personage of tabernacle&quot; () who &quot;possess[es] the same mind with the Father; which Mind is the Holy Spirit&quot; ()
#The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit constitute the &quot;supreme power over all things&quot; ()
#&quot;These three constitute the Godhead and are one: the Father and the Son possessing the same mind, the same wisdom, glory, power, and fullness;&quot; ()
#The Son is &quot;filled with the fullness of the Mind of the Father, or in other words, the Spirit of the Father.&quot; ()

===Lecture 6===
The knowledge that one&#x27;s life is in accordance with God&#x27;s will is necessary for obtaining eternal life. Any religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things, does not have the power to produce the faith necessary for life and salvation. Those who have not sacrificed all things will not be able to know that their lives are pleasing to God and will therefore not be able to have the faith to overcome the tribulations that stand in the way of becoming joint heirs with Christ in God&#x27;s Kingdom.

===Lecture 7===
By growing in faith, one draws nearer to God, and in the perfection of faith, one becomes like God.
By faith, one obtains knowledge of God, through which knowledge one can receive all things pertaining to life and godliness.

==Status as part of the Latter Day Saint canon==
The lectures were published in 1835 as the &quot;Doctrine&quot; portion of the volume entitled Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints: Carefully Selected from the Revelations of God. The lectures were selected for that volume by a committee appointed on September 24, 1834, by a general assembly of the church to arrange the doctrines and revelations of the church into a single volume. That committee of Presiding Elders, consisting of Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams, stated that the lectures were included &quot;in consequence of their embracing the important doctrine of salvation,&quot; and that the lectures, together with the church-regulatory sections that followed, represent &quot;our belief, and when we say this, humbly trust, the faith and principles of this society as a body.&quot; Accordingly, the church body accepted the committee&#x27;s compilation on August 17, 1835, as &quot;the doctrine and covenants of their faith, by a unanimous vote&quot;.

Some Latter Day Saint denominations have subsequently removed the lectures from the D&amp;C. The lectures were removed from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints version of the D&amp;C in 1897, although that denomination began publishing the lectures in a separate volume in 1952. The LDS Church removed the lectures from the D&amp;C in the 1921 edition, with an explanation that the lectures &quot;were never presented to nor accepted by the Church as being otherwise than theological lectures or lessons&quot;. This is in contrast to the remaining pages of the original D&amp;C, which are officially recognized by nearly all Latter Day Saint denominations as divine revelation given specifically to the church.

Mormon apologists give several reasons to explain why the Lectures were removed from the scriptural volumes of the LDS Church. According to church apostle Joseph Fielding Smith, the reasons were:
:&quot;(a) They were not received as revelations by the prophet Joseph Smith.
:&quot;(b) They are instructions relative to the general subject of faith. They are explanations of this principle but not doctrine.
:&quot;(c) They are not complete as to their teachings regarding the Godhead. More complete instructions on the point of doctrine are given in section 130 of the 1876 and all subsequent editions of the Doctrine and Covenants.
:&quot;(d) It was thought by James E. Talmage, chairman, and other members of the committee who were responsible for their omission that to avoid confusion and contention on this vital point of belief, it would be better not to have them bound in the same volume as the commandments or revelations which make up the Doctrine and Covenants.&quot;

Brigham Young University&#x27;s Thomas G. Alexander has stated in a &quot;Sunstone&quot; article:
Revision [of the Doctrine and Covenants] continued through July and August 1921, and the Church printed the new edition in late 1921. The committee proposed to delete the &#x27;Lectures on Faith&#x27; on the grounds that they were &#x27;lessons prepared for use in the School of the Elders, conducted in Kirtland, Ohio, during the winter of 1834-35; but they were never presented to nor accepted by the Church as being otherwise than theological lectures or lessons.&#x27; How the committee came to this conclusion is uncertain. The general conference of the Church in April 1835 had accepted the entire volume, including the Lectures, not simply the portion entitled &#x27;Covenants and Commandments,&#x27; as authoritative and binding upon Church members. What seems certain, however, is that the interpretive exegesis of 1916 based upon the reconstructed doctrine of the Godhead had superseded the Lectures.
Other commentators have theorized that the lectures represented official church doctrine in 1835, but that by 1897 or 1921, when the work was decanonized by the major Latter Day Saint denominations, the doctrine concerning the Godhead had changed, and the lectures were no longer generally consistent with accepted doctrines. For instance, in Lecture 5, paragraph 2, it defines the Father as a &quot;personage of spirit, glory and power,&quot; whereas in section 130 of the D&amp;C, verse 22 states that &quot;the Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man&#x27;s.&quot; In addition, the Father and Son are said to possess the same mind, &quot;which mind is the Holy Spirit&quot; (Lecture 5, paragraph 2). The Holy Spirit is not a personage, as defined at the beginning of paragraph 2: &quot;There are two personages who constitute the great, matchless, governing and supreme power over all things... They are the Father and Son.&quot; This could cause confusion when compared with section 130 of the Doctrine and Covenants: &quot;The Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit.&quot; Section 130 was added in the 1876 edition and hence co-existed with the Lectures on Faith.

In 1972, Bruce R. McConkie, then a member of the LDS Church&#x27;s First Council of the Seventy, praised the lectures as follows:
:&quot;In my judgment, it is the most comprehensive, inspired utterance that now exists in the English language—that exists in one place defining, interpreting, expounding, announcing, and testifying what kind of being God is. It was written by the power of the Holy Ghost, by the spirit of inspiration. It is, in effect, eternal scripture; it is true.&quot;

<text>Jan Hendrik Oort ( or ; 28 April 1900 – 5 November 1992) was a Dutch astronomer who made significant contributions to the understanding of the Milky Way and who was a pioneer in the field of radio astronomy. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him &quot;one of the century&#x27;s foremost explorers of the universe&quot;; the European Space Agency website describes him as &quot;one of the greatest astronomers of the 20th century&quot; and states that he &quot;revolutionised astronomy through his ground-breaking discoveries.&quot; In 1955, Oort&#x27;s name appeared in &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 most famous living people. He has been described as &quot;putting the Netherlands in the forefront of postwar astronomy&quot;.

Oort determined that the Milky Way rotates and overturned the idea that the Sun was at its center. He also postulated the existence of the mysterious invisible dark matter in 1932, which is believed to make up roughly 84.5% of the total mass in the Universe and whose gravitational pull causes &quot;the clustering of stars into galaxies and galaxies into connecting strings of galaxies&quot;. He discovered the galactic halo, a group of stars orbiting the Milky Way but outside the main disk. Additionally Oort is responsible for a number of important insights about comets, including the realization that their orbits &quot;implied there was a lot more solar system than the region occupied by the planets.&quot;

The Oort cloud, the Oort constants, Oort Limit, an impact crater on Pluto (Oort), and the asteroid 1691 Oort were all named after him.

==Early life and education==

Oort was born in Franeker, a small town in the Dutch province of Friesland, on April 28, 1900. He was the second son of Abraham Hermanus Oort, a physician, who died on May 12, 1941, and Ruth Hannah Faber, who was the daughter of Jan Faber and Henrietta Sophia Susanna Schaaii, and who died on November 20, 1957. Both of his parents came from families of clergymen, with his paternal grandfather, a Protestant clergyman with liberal ideas, who &quot;was one of the founders of the more liberal Church in Holland&quot; and who &quot;was one of the three people who made a new translation of the Bible into Dutch.&quot; The reference is to Henricus Oort (1836–1927), who was the grandson of a famous Rotterdam preacher and, through his mother, Dina Maria Blom, the grandson of theologian Abraham Hermanus Blom, a &quot;pioneer of modern biblical research&quot;. Several of Oort&#x27;s uncles were pastors, as was his maternal grandfather. &quot;My mother kept up her interests in that, at least in the early years of her marriage&quot;, he recalled. &quot;But my father was less interested in Church matters.&quot;

In 1903 Oort&#x27;s parents moved to Oegstgeest, near Leiden, where his father took charge of the Endegeest Psychiatric Clinic. Oort&#x27;s father, &quot;was a medical director in a sanitorium for nervous illnesses. We lived in the director&#x27;s house of the sanitorium, in a small forest which was very nice for the children, of course, to grow up in.&quot; Oort&#x27;s younger brother, John, became a professor of plant diseases at the University of Wageningen. In addition to John, Oort had two younger sisters and an elder brother who died of diabetes when he was a student.

Oort attended primary school in Oegstgeest and secondary school in Leiden, and in 1917 went to Groningen University to study physics. He later said that he had become interested in science and astronomy during his high-school years, and conjectured that his interest was stimulated by reading Jules Verne. His one hesitation about studying pure science was the concern that it &quot;might alienate one a bit from people in general&quot;, as a result of which &quot;one might not develop the human factor sufficiently.&quot; But he overcame this concern and ended up discovering that his later academic positions, which involved considerable administrative responsibilities, afforded a good deal of opportunity for social contact.

Oort chose Groningen partly because a well known astronomer, Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn, was teaching there, although Oort was unsure whether he wanted to specialize in physics or astronomy. After studying with Kapteyn, Oort decided on astronomy. &quot;It was the personality of Professor Kapteyn which decided me entirely&quot;, he later recalled. &quot;He was quite an inspiring teacher and especially his elementary astronomy lectures were fascinating.&quot; Oort began working on research with Kapteyn early in his third year. According to Oort one professor at Groningen who had considerable influence on his education was physicist Frits Zernike.

After taking his final exam in 1921, Oort was appointed assistant at Groningen, but in September 1922, he went to the United States to do graduate work at Yale and to serve as an assistant to Frank Schlesinger of the Yale Observatory.

==Career==
At Yale, Oort was responsible for making observations with the Observatory&#x27;s zenith telescope. &quot;I worked on the problem of latitude variation&quot;, he later recalled, &quot;which is quite far away from the subjects I had so far been studying.&quot; He later considered his experience at Yale useful as he became interested in &quot;problems of fundamental astronomy that [he] felt was capitalized on later, and which certainly influenced [his] future lectures in Leiden.&quot; Personally, he &quot;felt somewhat lonesome in Yale&quot;, but also said that &quot;some of my very best friends were made in these years in New Haven.&quot;

=== Early discoveries ===
In 1924, Oort returned to the Netherlands to work at Leiden University, where he served as a research assistant, becoming Conservator in 1926, Lecturer in 1930, and Professor Extraordinary in 1935. In 1926, he received his doctorate from Groningen with a thesis on the properties of high-velocity stars. The next year, Swedish astronomer Bertil Lindblad proposed that the rate of rotation of stars in the outer part of the galaxy decreased with distance from the galactic core, and Oort, who later said that he believed it was his colleague Willem de Sitter who had first drawn his attention to Lindblad&#x27;s work, realized that Lindblad was correct and that the truth of his proposition could be demonstrated observationally. Oort provided two formulae that described galactic rotation; the two constants that figured in these formulae are now known as &quot;Oort&#x27;s constants&quot;. Oort &quot;argued that just as the outer planets appear to us to be overtaken and passed by the less distant ones in the solar system, so too with the stars if the Galaxy really rotated&quot;, according to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Scientists&quot;. He &quot;was finally able to calculate, on the basis of the various stellar motions, that the Sun was some 30,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy and took about 225 million years to complete its orbit. He also showed that stars lying in the outer regions of the galactic disk rotated more slowly than those nearer the center. The Galaxy does not therefore rotate as a uniform whole but exhibits what is known as &#x27;differential rotation&#x27;.&quot;

These early discoveries by Oort about the Milky Way overthrew the Kapteyn system, named after his mentor, which had envisioned a galaxy that was symmetrical around the Sun. As Oort later noted, &quot;Kapteyn and his co-workers had not realized that the absorption in the galactic plane was as bad as it turned out to be.&quot; Until Oort began his work, he later recalled, &quot;the Leiden Observatory had been concentrating entirely on positional astronomy, meridian circle work and some proper motion work. But no astrophysics or anything that looked like that. No structure of the galaxy, no dynamics of the galaxy. There was no one else in Leiden who was interested in these problems in which I was principally interested, so the first years I worked more or less by myself in these projects. De Sitter was interested, but his main line of research was celestial mechanics; at that time the expanding universe had moved away from his direct interest.&quot; As the European Space Agency states, Oort &quot;sh[ook] the scientific world by demonstrating that the Milky Way rotates like a giant &#x27;Catherine Wheel&#x27;.&quot; He showed that all the stars in the galaxy were &quot;travelling independently through space, with those nearer the center rotating much faster than those further away.&quot;

This breakthrough made Oort famous in the world of astronomy. In the early 1930s he received job offers from Harvard and Columbia University, but chose to stay at Leiden, although he did spend half of 1932 at the Perkins Observatory, in Delaware, Ohio.

In 1934, Oort became assistant to the director of Leiden Observatory; the next year he became General Secretary of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a post he held until 1948; in 1937 he was elected to the Royal Academy. In 1939, he spent half a year in the U.S., and became interested in the Crab Nebula, concluding in a paper, written with American astronomer Nicholas Mayall, that it was the result of a supernova explosion.

=== Nazi invasion of Netherlands ===
In 1940, Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands. Soon after, the occupying regime dismissed all Jewish professors from Leiden University and other universities. &quot;Among the professors who were dismissed&quot;, Oort later recalled, &quot;was a very famous … professor of law by the name of Meyers. On the day when he got the letter from the authorities that he could no longer teach his classes, the dean of the faculty of law went into his class … and delivered a speech in which he started by saying, &#x27;I won&#x27;t talk about his dismissal and I shall leave the people who did this, below us, but will concentrate on the greatness of the man dismissed by our aggressors.&#x27;&quot;

This speech (26 November 1940) made such an impression on all his students that on leaving the auditorium they defiantly sang the anthem of the Netherlands and went on strike. Oort was present for the lecture and was greatly impressed. This occasion formed the beginning of the active resistance in Holland. The speech by Rudolph Cleveringa, the dean of the faculty of Law and former graduate student of professor Meijers, was widely circulated during the rest of the war by the resistance groups. Oort was in a little group of professors in Leiden who came together regularly and discussed the problems the university faced in view of the German occupation. Most of the members of this group were put in hostage camps soon after the speech by Cleveringa. Oort refused to collaborate with the occupiers, &quot;and so we went down to live in the country for the rest of the war.&quot; Resigning from the Royal Academy, from his professorial post at Leiden, and from his position at the Observatory, Oort took his family to Hulshorst, a quiet village in the province of Gelderland, where they sat out the war. In Hulshorst, he began writing a book on stellar dynamics.

=== Oort&#x27;s radio astronomy ===

Before the war was over, he initiated, in collaboration with a Utrecht University student, Hendrik van de Hulst, a project that eventually succeeded, in 1951, in detecting the 21-centimeter radio emission from interstellar hydrogen spectral line at radio frequencies. Oort and his colleagues also made the first investigation of the central region of the Galaxy, and discovered that &quot;the 21-centimeter radio emission passed un-absorbed through the gas clouds that had hidden the center from optical observation. They found a huge concentration of mass there, later identified as mainly stars, and also discovered that much of the gas in the region was moving rapidly outward away from the center.&quot; In June 1945, after the end of the war, Oort returned to Leiden, took over as director of the Observatory, and became Full Professor of Astronomy. During this immediate postwar period, he led the Dutch group that built radio telescopes at Radio Kootwijk, Dwingeloo, and Westerbork and used the 21-centimeter line to map the Milky Way, including the large-scale spiral structure, the Galactic Center, and gas cloud motions. Oort was helped in this project by the Dutch telecommunications company, PTT, which, he later explained, &quot;had under their care all the radar equipment that was left behind by the Germans on the coast of Holland. This radar equipment consisted in part of reflecting telescopes of 7 1/2 meter aperture... Our radio astronomy was really started with the aid of one of these instruments… it was in Kootwijk that the first map of the Galaxy was made.&quot; For a brief period, before the completion of the Jodrell Bank telescope, the Dwingeloo instrument was the largest of its kind on Earth.

It has been written that &quot;Oort was probably the first astronomer to realize the importance&quot; of radio astronomy. &quot;In the days before radio telescopes,&quot; one source notes, &quot;Oort was one of the few scientists to realise the potential significance of using radio waves to search the heavens. His theoretical research suggested that vast clouds of hydrogen lingered in the spiral arms of the Galaxy. These molecular clouds, he predicted, were the birthplaces of stars.&quot; These predictions were confirmed by measurements made at the new radio observatories at Dwingeloo and Westerbork. Oort later said that &quot;it was Grote Reber&#x27;s work which first impressed me and convinced me of the unique importance of radio observations for surveying the galaxy.&quot; Just before the war, Reber had published a study of galactic radio emissions. Oort later commented, &quot;The work of Grote Reber made it quite clear [radio astronomy] would be a very important tool for investigating the Galaxy, just because it could investigate the whole disc of the galactic system unimpeded by absorption.&quot; Oort&#x27;s work in radio astronomy is credited by colleagues with putting the Netherlands in the forefront of postwar astronomy. Oort also investigated the source of the light from the Crab Nebula, finding that it was polarized, and probably produced by synchrotron radiation, confirming a hypothesis by Iosif Shklovsky.

=== Comet studies ===
Oort went on to study comets, which he formulated a number of revolutionary hypotheses. He hypothesized that the Solar System is surrounded by a massive cloud consisting of billions of comets, many of them &quot;long-period&quot; comets that originate in a cloud far beyond the orbits of Neptune and Pluto. This cloud is now known as the Oort Cloud. He also realized that these external comets, from beyond Pluto, can &quot;become trapped into tighter orbits by Jupiter, and become periodic comets, like Halley&#x27;s comet.&quot; According to one source, &quot;Oort was one of the few people to have seen Comet Halley on two separate apparitions. At the age of 10, he was with his father on the shore at Noordwijk, Netherlands, when he first saw the comet. In 1986, 76 years later, he went up in a plane and was able to see the famous comet once more.&quot;

In 1951 Oort and his wife spent several months in Princeton and Pasadena, an interlude that led to a paper by Oort and Lyman Spitzer on the acceleration of interstellar clouds by O-type stars. He went on to study high-velocity clouds. Oort served as director of the Leiden Observatory until 1970. After his retirement, he wrote comprehensive articles on the galactic center and on superclusters and published several papers on the quasar absorption lines, supporting Yakov Zel&#x27;dovich&#x27;s pancake model of the universe. He also continued researching the Milky Way and other galaxies and their distribution until shortly before his death at 92.

One of Oort&#x27;s strengths, according to one source, was his ability to &quot;translate abstruse mathematical papers into physical terms,&quot; as exemplified by his translation of the difficult mathematical terms of Lindblad&#x27;s theory of differential galactic rotation into a physical model. Similarly, he &quot;derived the existence of the comet cloud on the outskirts of the Solar System from the observations, using the mathematics needed in dynamics, but then deduced the origin of this cloud using general physical arguments and a minimum of mathematics.&quot;

==Personal life==

In 1927, Oort married Johanna Maria (Mieke) Graadt van Roggen (1906–1993). They had met at a university celebration at Utrecht, where Oort&#x27;s brother was studying biology at the time. Oort and his wife had two sons, Coenraad (Coen) and Abraham, and a daughter, Marijke. Abraham became a professor of climatology at Princeton University.

According to the website of Leiden University, Oort was very interested in and knowledgeable about art. &quot;[W]hen visiting another country he would always try to take some time off to visit the local museums and exhibitions…and in the fifties served for some years as chairman of the pictorial arts committee of the Leiden Academical Arts Centre, which had among other things the task of organizing expositions&quot;.

&quot;Colleagues remembered him as a tall, lean and courtly man with a genial manner,&quot; reported his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary.

== A few of Oort&#x27;s discoveries ==

* In 1924, Oort discovered the galactic halo, a group of stars orbiting the Milky Way but outside the main disk.
* In 1927, he calculated that the center of the Milky Way was 5,900 parsecs (19,200 light years) from the Earth in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.
* In 1932, by measuring the motions of stars in the Milky Way he was the first to find evidence for dark matter, when he found the mass of the galactic plane must be more than the mass of the material that can be seen.
* He showed that the Milky Way had a mass 100 billion times that of the Sun.
* In 1950, he suggested that comets came from a common region of the Solar System (now called the Oort cloud).
* He found that the light from the Crab Nebula was polarized, and produced by synchrotron emission.

<doc id="413433" wikidata="Q197969" url="?curid=413433" title="Mooncake">
<text>A mooncake () is a Chinese bakery product traditionally eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival (中秋節). The festival is primarily about the harvest while a legend connects it to moon watching, and mooncakes are regarded as a delicacy. Mooncakes are offered between friends or on family gatherings while celebrating the festival. The Mid-Autumn Festival is widely regarded as one of the four most important Chinese festivals.

There are numerous varieties of mooncakes consumed within China and outside of China in overseas Chinese communities. The Cantonese mooncake is the most famous variety. A traditional Cantonese mooncake is a round pastry, measuring about in diameter and thick, with a rich, thick filling usually made from lotus seed paste (other typical fillings include red bean paste or mixed nuts) surrounded by a thin, 2–3 mm (approximately 1/8 of an inch) crust and may contain yolks from salted duck eggs.

Mooncakes are usually eaten in small wedges, accompanied by tea. Today, it is customary for business people and families to present them to their clients or relatives as presents, encouraging the market for high-end mooncakes.

Just as the Mid-Autumn Festival is celebrated in various Asian localities due to the presence of Chinese communities throughout the region, mooncakes are enjoyed in other parts of Asia too. Mooncakes have also appeared in western countries as a form of delicacy.

== General description ==
Most mooncakes consist of a thick, tender pastry skin enveloping a sweet, dense filling, which may contain one or several whole salted egg yolks in the center to symbolize the full moon. Depending on the custom, mooncakes may also be steamed, baked, or fried.

Traditional mooncakes have an imprint on top consisting of the Chinese characters for &quot;longevity&quot; or &quot;harmony&quot;, as well as the name of the bakery and the filling inside. Imprints of the Moon, the Chinese goddess of the Moon (Chang&#x27;e), flowers, vines, or a rabbit (symbol of the Moon) may surround the characters for additional decoration.

== History ==

=== Mid-Autumn Festival ===
The festival is intricately linked to legends of Chang’e, the mythical Moon Goddess of Immortality.
According to the &quot;Liji&quot;, an ancient Chinese book recording customs and ceremonies, the Chinese Emperor should offer sacrifices to the Sun in spring and the Moon in autumn. The 15th day of the 8th lunar month is the day called &quot;Mid-Autumn&quot;. The night on the 15th of the 8th lunar month is also called &quot;Night of the Moon&quot;.

Because of its central role in the Mid-Autumn festival, mooncakes remained popular even in recent years. For many, they form a central part of the Mid-Autumn festival experience such that it is now commonly known as &#x27;Mooncake Festival&#x27;.

=== Ming Revolution ===
There is a folk tale about the overthrow of the Yuan dynasty facilitated by messages smuggled in moon cakes.

Mooncakes were used by revolutionaries in their effort to overthrow the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, eventually resulting in the establishment of the Ming dynasty. The idea is said to have been conceived by Zhu Yuanzhang and his advisor Liu Bowen, who circulated a rumor that a deadly plague was spreading and that the only way to prevent it was to eat special mooncakes, which would instantly revive and give special powers to the user. This prompted the quick distribution of mooncakes. The mooncakes contained a secret message: on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, kill the rulers.

Another method of hiding a message was to print it on the surfaces of mooncakes (which came in packages of four), as a simple puzzle or mosaic. To read the message, each of the four mooncakes was cut into four parts. The resulting 16 pieces were pieced together to reveal the message. The pieces of mooncakes were then eaten to destroy the message.

== Traditional styles ==
=== Fillings ===

Many types of fillings can be found in traditional mooncakes:
*Lotus seed paste (蓮蓉, &quot;lían róng&quot;): Considered by some to be the original and most luxurious mooncake filling, lotus paste filling is found in all types of mooncakes. White lotus paste commands an even higher premium. Due to the high price of lotus paste, white kidney bean paste is sometimes used as a filler.
*Sweet bean paste (豆沙, &quot;dòu shā&quot;): A number of pastes are common fillings found in Chinese desserts. Although red bean paste, made from azuki beans, is the most common worldwide, there are regional and original preferences for bean paste made from mung beans, as well as black beans.
*Jujube paste (棗泥, &quot;zǎo ní&quot;): A sweet paste is made from the ripe fruits of the jujube (date) plant. The paste is dark red in color, a little fruity/smoky in flavor, and slightly sour in taste. Depending on the quality of the paste, jujube paste may be confused with red bean paste, which is sometimes used as a filler.
*Five kernels (五仁, &quot;wǔ rén&quot;) or mixed nuts: A filling consisting of 5 types of nuts and seeds, coarsely chopped, is held together with maltose syrup. Recipes differ from region to region, but commonly used nuts and seeds include: walnuts, pumpkin seeds, watermelon seeds, peanuts, sesame seeds, or almonds. The mixture for the filling also contains candied winter melon, jinhua ham, or pieces of rock sugar as additional flavoring.

=== Crusts ===

Traditional mooncakes vary widely depending on the region where they are produced. Most regions produce them with many types of fillings, but with only one type of crust. Although vegetarian mooncakes may use vegetable oil, many mooncakes use lard in their recipes. Three types of mooncake crust are used in Chinese cuisine:
*Chewy: This crust has a reddish-brown tone and glossy sheen. It is the most common type of crust used on Cantonese-style mooncakes. It is also the most commonly seen type of mooncake in North America and many Western countries. Chewy mooncake crusts are made using a combination of thick sugar syrup, lye water (碱水, sodium carbonate (碱 [Na2CO3]), flour, and oil, thus giving this crust its rich taste and a chewy yet tender texture. Chewiness can be increased further by adding maltose syrup to the mixture.
**The dough is also baked into fish or piglet shapes () and sold at bakeries as a chewy snack. They often come individually packaged in small plastic baskets, to symbolize fish being caught or piglets being bound for sale.
*Flaky: Flaky crusts are most indicative of Suzhou- and Taiwan-style mooncakes. The dough is made by rolling together alternating layers of oily dough and flour that has been stir-fried in oil. This crust has a texture similar to puff pastry.
*Tender: Mooncakes from certain provinces of China are often made to be tender rather than flaky or chewy. The texture of this type of mooncake crust is similar to the shortcrust pastry used in Western pie crusts or tart shells. Tender crusts are made mainly of a homogenous mix of sugar, oil, flour, and water. This type of crust is also commonly used in other type of Chinese pastries, such as the egg tart.
*Crumbly: Yunnan-style mooncakes are made using a hot water crust pastry that combines different kinds of flour with oil, salt, and hot water to form a dense, crumbly pastry that&#x27;s quite uncommon elsewhere.

=== Regional variations in China ===


There are many regional variants of the mooncake. Types of traditional mooncake include:

*Beijing-style mooncake: This style has two variations. One, called &quot;di qiang&quot;, was influenced by the Suzhou-style mooncake. It has a light, foamy dough as opposed to a flaky one. The other variation, called &quot;fan mao&quot;, has a flaky, white dough. The two most popular fillings are the mountain hawthorn and wisteria blossom flavors.
*Cantonese-style mooncake: Originating from Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, the Cantonese mooncake has multiple variations and is the most famous regional style of the mooncake. The ingredients used for the fillings are various: lotus seed paste, melon seed paste, nuts, ham, chicken, duck, roast pork, mushrooms, egg yolks, etc. More elaborate versions contain four egg yolks, representing the four phases of the moon. Recent contemporary forms (albeit non-traditional) sold in Hong Kong are even made from chocolate, ice-cream or jelly.
*Shanghai-style mooncake: This style is made from shortcrust pastry which is rich, crumbly and buttery crust but not like pie dough. The most popular fillings are similar to those sweet Cantonese-style mooncake such as sweetened red bean paste, lotus seed paste and taro paste with egg yolks in the middle of the filling.
*Hong Kong-style mooncake: Hong Kong has gained its own style of mooncakes. While Hongkongers typically eat Cantonese-style mooncakes, local inventions such as snow skin mooncake have been appearing over the last few decades.
*Teochew-style mooncake: This is another flaky crust variety, but is larger in size than the Suzhou variety. It is close in diameter to the Cantonese style, but thinner. A variety of fillings are used, but the aroma of lard after roasting is stressed. The Teochew also have a fried lotus cake (or lotus pastry) (), eaten on the Mid-Autumn Festival. This moon cake is deep-fried, not baked. The yam filling and flaky pastry crust are what set Teochew mooncakes apart from other mooncakes. These old-school confections are known as &quot;la bia&quot; (朥饼) in the Chaoshan region in the east of Guangdong, where the Teochews came from. La means lard or pork oil in Teochew, which is mixed with flour to make the pastry.
*Ningbo-style mooncake: This style is also inspired by the Suzhou-style. It is prevalent in Zhejiang province, and has a compact covering. The fillings are either seaweed or ham; it is also known for its spicy and salty flavor.
*Suzhou-style mooncake: This style began more than a thousand years ago, and is known for its layers of flaky dough and generous allotment of sugar and lard. Within this regional type, there are more than a dozen variations. It is also smaller than most other regional varieties. Suzhou-style mooncakes feature both sweet and savory types, the latter served hot and usually filled with pork mince. Fillings made from salt and pepper (椒鹽, &quot;jiāoyán&quot;) are common in flaky Suzhou-style mooncakes.
*Meizhou-style mooncake 
*Southern Min-style mooncake 
*Wenzhou-style mooncake 
*Yunnan-style mooncake: The distinctive feature is the combination of various flours for the dough, including rice flour, wheat flour, and buckwheat flour, and a filling that combines Xuanwei ham and sugar.

== Contemporary styles ==
Over time, both the crusts and the composition of the fillings of mooncakes have diversified, in particular, due to a commercial need to drive up sales in the face of intense competition between producers and from other food types. Part of these trends are also to cater to changing taste preferences, and because people are more health-conscious. Therefore, most of these contemporary styles are especially prominent amongst the cosmopolitan and younger Chinese and amongst the overseas Chinese community. However, traditional mooncakes are often sold alongside contemporary ones to cater to individual preferences.

Some of the earliest forms of diversification were by changing the fillings with ingredients considered unusual then. Taro paste (芋泥, &quot;yù ní&quot;), pineapple and durian were amongst the first to be introduced, especially amongst the overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. The crust itself also evolved, particularly with the introduction of &quot;snow skin mooncake&quot;. It is different from the traditional mooncake - the snow skin mooncake needs to be stored inside a refrigerator and is white on the outside. Traditionally the colour white means something bad in China, for example, people will wear a white collar to a funeral. However, this kind of white coloured mooncake is popular with teenagers. Miniature mooncakes also appeared, in part to allow for easier individual consumption without the need to cut the large cakes.

To adapt to today&#x27;s health-conscious lifestyle, fat-free mooncakes also appeared. Some are made of yogurt, jelly, and fat-free ice-cream. Customers pick and choose the size and filling of mooncakes that suits their taste and diet. For added hygiene, each cake is often wrapped in airtight plastic, accompanied by a tiny food preserver packet.

Contemporary-style mooncakes, while increasingly popular, have their detractors. Pricey ingredients have pushed up prices, causing worry of a &quot;mooncake bubble&quot; forming in China. Food critics sometimes point out that &quot;chocolate mooncakes&quot; are in reality just chocolate shaped into mooncakes, and not mooncakes made of chocolate, while others complain that food chains appear intent on coming up with exotic flavors to take advantage of the market, without much thought for how well the tastes fuse together.

=== Fillings ===

Fillings in contemporary style mooncakes have diversified to include just about anything which can be made into a paste. Mooncakes containing taro paste and pineapple, which were considered novelty items at their time of invention, have become commonplace in recent years. In addition, filling composed of ingredients such as coffee, chocolate, nuts (walnuts, mixed nuts, etc.), fruits (prunes, pineapples, melons, lychees, etc.), vegetables (sweet potatoes, etc.), and even ham have been added to give a modern twist to the traditional recipes.

Some other examples include
Traditional Chinese delicacies such as ginseng and bird&#x27;s nest were soon followed by abalone and shark fin. Foreign food companies have also tried to cash in. Häagen-Dazs were one of the first to create an ice-cream mooncake, with a choice of either the &quot;traditional,&quot; snow-skin, or Belgian/Swiss white, milk, and dark chocolate crusts. Other ice-cream and restaurant chains soon followed up with their own versions. Other Western ingredients, including champagne ganache, malt whisky, volcanic-salt caramel and even Black truffles, caviar and foie gras have made it into mooncakes.

=== Crusts ===

Snowy mooncakes first appeared on the market in the early 1980s. These non-baked, chilled mooncakes usually come with two types of crusts:
*Glutinous rice: A crust with texture similar to that of a mochi. This is a snow skin mooncake. These moon cakes are known colloquially as &quot;&quot;snowskin mooncakes&quot;, &quot;ice-skin mooncakes&quot; or &quot;snowy mooncakes&quot;&quot; (冰皮 or 冰皮月餅).
*Jelly: A crust made of gelling mixtures such as agar, gelatin, or konjac and flavored with a wide variety of fruit flavorings.

== Use in other countries and regions ==
===East Asia===
==== Japan ====
Mooncakes in Japan are known as , a transliteration of the Chinese name. Their designs are based on the Cantonese mooncake, are associated with Chinese culture and are sold all year round, mainly in Japan&#x27;s Chinatowns. Azuki (red bean) paste is the most popular filling for these mooncakes, but other sorts of beans, as well as chestnut, are also used.

==== Taiwan ====
The most traditional mooncake found within Taiwan resembles those from southern Fujian. Taiwanese mooncakes are filled with sweetened red bean paste, sometimes with mochi in the center. The most common traditional mooncakes coming from Taiwan are filled mung bean (&quot;lu dou&quot;) or taro paste, generally with a salted duck egg yolk in the mung bean mooncakes, and either salted duck egg or a savory treat in the taro mooncakes. They typically have a flaky crust and are spherical in shape. Instead of the imprinted pattern on top common in Cantonese versions, Taiwanese mooncakes have a red stamp typically in celebratory Chinese character. Modern, more trendy Taiwanese moon cakes are wide in variety that includes low fat, lard free and ice cream versions. Popular modern flavors include green tea, chocolate, strawberry and tiramisu.

===Southeast Asia===
==== Indonesia ====
In Indonesia, there are several main types of mooncakes, from the traditional to the modern mooncakes. The very traditional mooncake has been there ever since the Chinese and Japanese entered Indonesia, they are circular like a moon, white and thinner than regular mooncake. Fillings may include pork, chocolate, cheese, milk, durian, jackfruit and many other exotic fruits made into a paste. This type of mooncake is widely available all year long while the regular modern mooncakes are usually only sold around the mid-autumn festival season.

As a Muslim-majority country, mooncakes are predominantly made with halal ingredients. The crust is typically made from vegetable oil or peanut oil and filled with mung bean paste.

==== Malaysia ====
There are three major cities that have diverse types of moon cakes; George Town, Kuala Lumpur and Sabah. Mooncakes are quite similar to the traditional Chinese. However, many prefer to add 100% pure Hunan lotus seed to maintain the quality of mooncakes. The most popular types, especially in Kuala Lumpur, are White Lotus Seed Paste Cake, Snow Skins and Black Sesame With Yolk.

==== Singapore ====

In Singapore, mooncakes are luxury gifts. They come in a wide variety of flavors ranging from the traditional baked ones, to the Teochew flaky ones filled with yam paste, to snowskin varieties filled with chilled fruit pastes. Traditional mooncakes feature base fillings of red lotus paste, white lotus paste or red bean paste, with 0-4 salted duck egg yolks embedded within. Variations include adding other ingredients such as macadamia nuts, osmanthus, orange peel and melon seeds.

Snowskin mooncakes in Singapore feature flavors ranging from Lychee Martini, Baileys, Matcha Red Bean, durian, and various fruit pastes.

Mooncakes are luxurious gifts in Singapore and are very popular as gifts to clients, friends and family. An average box of 4 mooncakes cost US$60. Many hotels and fine Chinese cuisine restaurants offer mooncakes packaged in elaborate boxes with multiple compartments and jeweled clasps. Mooncake boxes are commonly repurposed as jewelry boxes after the festival ends.

==== Thailand ====
In Thailand, mooncakes (in Thai, ขนมไหว้พระจันทร์) are sold in Thai-Chinese bakeries during festival season. In Bangkok, traditional and modern moon cakes are not limited to Chinatown on Yaowarat Road, but they are also found in stalls of large supermarkets.

==== Vietnam ====
In Vietnam, mooncakes are known as &quot;bánh trung thu&quot; (literally &quot;mid-autumn cake&quot;). Vietnamese mooncakes are usually sold either individually or in a set of four. There are two kinds of mooncake: &quot;bánh nướng&quot; (baked mooncake) and &quot;bánh dẻo&quot; (sticky rice mooncake).

It can be said that &quot;bánh nướng&quot; and &quot;bánh dẻo&quot; are two special kinds of cake in Vietnam. They are widely popular and are sold only during the Tết Trung Thu season. Vietnamese mooncakes are often in the shape of a circle (10 cm in diameter) or a square (a length of about 7–8 cm), and 4–5 cm thick. Larger sizes are not uncommon. Their designs largely resemble that of the Cantonese mooncake, though some other images, such as the sow with cub, fish, shrimp, etc. can also be found.

Vietnamese mooncakes have two basic parts: crust and filling. The ingredients usually consist of: jam, dried sausage, mung bean paste, salt, sugar, cooking oil, sugared lard, lotus seed, watermelon seed, etc. Compared to other variants, Vietnamese mooncakes&#x27; flavor is more on the sweet side. Thus, to balance it, salted egg yolk is often added. They can be baked or eaten immediately.

&quot;Bánh nướng&quot; (baked mooncake) is made from wheat flour, cooking oil, and simple syrup boiled with malt. After being filled with various combinations of salted egg yolk, dried sausage, mung bean paste, salt, sugar, cooking oil, sugared pig fat, lotus seed, watermelon seed, it will be brushed with egg wash, then baked in the oven. The egg wash will protect the crust of the cake from drying out and create the aroma of the cake. The cakes have to be rotated constantly in the oven to prevent burning.

&quot;Bánh dẻo&quot; (sticky rice mooncake) is easier to make than &quot;bánh nướng&quot;. The crust and filling are pre-cooked. The crust is made from roasted glutinous rice flour, pomelo blossom water or vanilla and simple syrup. After malaxating rice flour, fillings similar to that of baked mooncake is stuffed inside the crust and then the cake is put into the mold dusted with a thin layer of flour to prevent sticking to fingers. The cake can be used immediately without any further steps. However, &quot;bánh dẻo&quot; is not as popular as &quot;bánh nướng&quot;.

<text>The Baltimore–Washington Parkway (also referred to as the B–W Parkway) is a controlled-access parkway in the U.S. state of Maryland, running southwest from Baltimore to Washington, D.C. The road begins at an interchange with U.S. Route 50 (US 50) near Cheverly in Prince George&#x27;s County at the Washington, D.C., border, and continues northeast as a parkway maintained by the National Park Service (NPS) to MD 175 near Fort Meade, serving many federal institutions. This portion of the parkway is dedicated to Gladys Noon Spellman, a representative of Maryland&#x27;s 5th congressional district, and has the unsigned Maryland Route 295 (MD 295) designation. Commercial vehicles, including trucks, are prohibited within this stretch. This section is administered by the NPS&#x27;s Greenbelt Park unit. After leaving park service boundaries the highway is maintained by the state and signed with the MD 295 designation. This section of the parkway passes near Baltimore–Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. 

Upon entering Baltimore, the Baltimore Department of Transportation takes over maintenance of the road and it continues north to an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95). Here, the Baltimore–Washington Parkway ends and MD 295 continues north unsigned on Russell Street, which carries the route north into downtown Baltimore. In downtown Baltimore, MD 295 follows Paca Street northbound and Greene Street southbound before ending at US 40.

Plans for a parkway linking Baltimore and Washington date back to Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s original layout for Washington, D.C. in the 18th century but did not fully develop until the 1920s. Major reasons surrounding the need for a parkway included high accident rates on adjacent US 1 and defense purposes before World War II. In the mid-1940s, plans for the design of the parkway were finalized and construction began in 1947 for the state-maintained portion and in 1950 for the NPS-maintained segment. The entire parkway opened to traffic in stages between 1950 and 1954. 

Following completion of the B–W Parkway, suburban growth took place in both Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. In the 1960s and the 1970s, there were plans to give the segment of the parkway owned by the NPS to the state and make it a part of I-295 and possibly I-95; however, they never came through and the entire road is today designated as MD 295, despite only being signed on the state-maintained portion. Between the 1980s and the 2000s, the NPS portion of the road was modernized. MD 295 is in the process of being widened from four to six lanes, with more widening and a new interchange along this segment planned for the future.

== Route description ==
=== NPS segment ===
The parkway begins at a large hybrid cloverleaf just outside the Washington, D.C., boundary at Tuxedo, Maryland, that is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration. Two other routes cross through the interchange. US 50 west of the interchange heads into Washington, D.C., to become New York Avenue, and to its east becomes the John Hanson Highway, a freeway. MD 201, which begins just south of the interchange at the D.C. line as a continuation of D.C. Route 295, continues north on Kenilworth Avenue, an arterial road that closely parallels to the east of the B–W Parkway for some distance.
The portion of the B–W Parkway between the southern terminus and MD 175 is maintained by the National Park Service (NPS). From its southern terminus, the road continues north as a six-lane freeway with the unsigned MD 295 designation, containing brown signs featuring the Clarendon typeface. Along this section of the parkway, commercial vehicles such as trucks are prohibited; however, buses and limousines are allowed. The parkway heads through wooded surroundings near industrial areas and passes over the Alexandria Extension of CSX&#x27;s Capital Subdivision railroad line and MD 201, where there is a ramp from southbound MD 201 to the southbound B–W Parkway. It continues northeast, passing near Prince George&#x27;s Hospital Center, to interchanges with MD 202 (Landover Road) in Cheverly and with MD 450 (Annapolis Road) in Bladensburg and Landover Hills and the former Capital Plaza Mall. Bladensburg itself is a historical waterfront town that consists of houses dating back to the mid-18th century.

It continues north as a four-lane freeway with a wide, tree-filled median, and passes through woodland, skirting residential neighborhoods hidden by the trees. The road has a junction with MD 410 (Riverdale Road) west of New Carrollton. This route provides access to the towns of Riverdale Park, which features an 1801 mansion named Riversdale surrounded by suburban development, and Hyattsville, which has buildings dating back to the railroad days of the 1870s and the streetcar and automobile days of the early 20th century. North of here, the route runs near more residences before entering Greenbelt, a suburban garden community built as a model &quot;green town&quot; during the New Deal program in the 1930s, and Greenbelt Park, a park under the jurisdiction of the NPS that has the nearest public camping area to Washington, D.C. In the northeastern corner of the park, the Baltimore–Washington Parkway comes to an interchange with I-95 and I-495 (the Capital Beltway). This interchange is the only place where the park service has used green signs compliant with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).
Just past the Capital Beltway, the route heads into the heart of the city of Greenbelt, having an interchange with MD 193 (Greenbelt Road). The headquarters of the U.S. Park Police, which patrol this portion of the parkway, is located off this exit along MD 193. MD 193 provides access to College Park, which is home to the College Park Airport, a 1909 airport where the Wright Brothers taught the U.S. Army how to fly an airplane, and the University of Maryland, College Park, a public educational institution established in 1862. At the northern edge of the town, the route has employee-only access to the Goddard Space Flight Center, the first NASA space flight center opened in 1958 that has contributed to many space missions; from here, the route then enters the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, the largest agricultural research center in the world, owned by the United States Department of Agriculture. The parkway&#x27;s only interchange in the center is at Powder Mill Road, south of Capitol College.

Outside the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, the parkway comes to MD 197 (Laurel–Bowie Road) south of Laurel. Near this exit of the parkway is the Montpelier Mansion, a Georgian mansion built by Major Thomas Snowden in 1783. Past MD 197, the road passes through the western edge of the Patuxent National Wildlife Research Refuge, a wildlife center established in 1936 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, crossing the Patuxent River into Anne Arundel County. Here the parkway continues northeast through dense woodland and comes to the exit for MD 198 (Fort Meade Road) to the east of Laurel, which itself is a suburb that originated in the 1830s as a mill town that contains many historical sites, such as the Laurel Railroad Station (still used today by MARC Train), an 1844 Queen Anne house, and an 1840s millworkers house that is home to the Laurel Museum.
Continuing north, the parkway encounters MD 32 (Savage Road) near Fort Meade. MD 32 offers northbound travelers direct access into the fort and to the National Security Agency, while the next interchange, another employee-only access road into Fort Meade, features only a southbound exit and northbound entrance. Fort Meade itself is a military installation opened in 1917 that trained 3.5 million troops during World War II and is still a major fort. To the west of the parkway off MD 32 is the Savage Mill, which was an operating cotton mill from 1822 to 1947 and is currently an antique mall, and the Bollman Truss Railroad Bridge, an 1869 cast and wrought iron bridge along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which is now CSX&#x27;s Capital Subdivision, line between Baltimore and Washington D.C. After this interchange, the road continues to a cloverleaf interchange with MD 175 (Jessup Road), where NPS maintenance of the parkway comes to an end at the south end of the interchange.

=== MDOT segment ===

Past the MD 175 junction, MD 295 signage begins and the road continues north as a four-lane grade-separated freeway maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration, where the truck ban ends. This permits trucks to serve into Fort Meade from Baltimore and BWI Airport. This section of the road features standard MUTCD green signage. It heads through wooded areas and comes to a diverging diamond interchange with MD 713F (Arundel Mills Boulevard), which provides access to the Arundel Mills shopping mall and the Live! Casino &amp; Hotel. Past this interchange, MD 295 comes to a cloverleaf interchange with MD 100. Continuing northeast, the route curves to the northwest of Baltimore–Washington International Airport (the largest airport in Maryland), passing near an industrial park before reaching I-195, the main access road to the airport. Within this interchange, before passing under I-195, the road crosses over Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor. I-195 westbound provides access from the Baltimore–Washington Parkway to the Thomas Viaduct, which carries the B&amp;O railroad line over the Patapsco River, and Patapsco Valley State Park, a state park that preserves the valley of the Patapsco River for recreational purposes.

Still on a northeast track, the route widens to six lanes and intersects West Nursery Road near Linthicum, adjacent to the BWI Hotel District. Past West Nursery Road, the road meets I-695 (the Baltimore Beltway) at a full cloverleaf interchange. Turning north, the route passes under MD 168 (Nursery Road) before crossing the Patapsco River into Baltimore County. Upon crossing into Baltimore County, MD 295 reaches a partial interchange with I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway), with access from northbound MD 295 to northbound I-895 and from southbound I-895 to southbound MD 295. Past I-895, the road continues through wooded surrounding with residential developments behind the trees, before entering the city of Baltimore.

=== Baltimore segment ===

In Baltimore, MD 295 continues as a limited-access freeway maintained by the Baltimore Department of Transportation, still surrounded by trees with urban residential and industrial neighborhoods nearby, passing under the Curtis Bay Branch of CSX&#x27;s Baltimore Terminal Subdivision railroad line and coming to an interchange with MD 648 (Annapolis Road) and Waterview Avenue just beyond the city line. Now running due north, the parkway heads over CSX&#x27;s Hanover Subdivision railroad line before it reaches its northern terminus at I-95. At the I-95 interchange, there are also ramps connecting to Monroe Street. MD 295 downgrades from a limited-access freeway to a six-lane divided city street called Russell Street.
MD 295 continues northeast on Russell Street, where it is unsigned for the remainder of the route, through a mix of industrial and commercial areas, heading to the northwest of the Baltimore Greyhound Terminal at Haines Street and the Horseshoe Casino Baltimore. Farther north, the street passes over CSX&#x27;s Baltimore Terminal Subdivision railroad line before it heads to the west of M&amp;T Bank Stadium, where the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League play. Past here, the road features an interchange with Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, which becomes I-395 south of Russell Street. After this interchange, MD 295 runs west of Oriole Park at Camden Yards, home to Major League Baseball&#x27;s Baltimore Orioles, as a four-lane divided street. Immediately after Camden Yards, MD 295 splits into a one-way pair at the intersection with Washington Boulevard with northbound traffic following Eislen Street northeast briefly before heading north on Paca Street and southbound traffic following Greene Street. Along the one-way pair, the route intersects many major streets in downtown Baltimore, including Pratt Street, Lombard Street, Baltimore Street, Fayette Street, and Saratoga Street.

Greene Street passes the University of Maryland Medical Center between Lombard Street and Baltimore Street, the Baltimore VA Medical Center between Baltimore Street and Fayette Street, and Westminster Hall and Burying Ground at the corner of Fayette Street. Paca Street passes by the Sonneborn Building north of Pratt Street; the Heiser, Rosenfeld, and Strauss Buildings north of Lombard Street; the historic Paca Street Firehouse and Sanitary Laundry Company Building just north of the intersection with Fayette Street; and Lexington Market at the intersection with Lexington Street. MD 295 reaches its northern terminus at US 40, which follows Mulberry Street eastbound and Franklin Street westbound, in downtown Baltimore. MD 129 continues north from the northern terminus of MD 295, following Paca Street northbound and Pennsylvania Avenue southbound.

== History ==
=== Planning ===
Plans for a parkway connecting Baltimore and Washington date back to the 1920s as a part of a system that was initially included in Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s layout of Washington, D.C., from the 18th century. In 1924, Harry W. Nice, who would later become governor of Maryland, called for the parkway to be constructed.

Early proposals made by the National Capital Park and Planning Commission involved a route that followed US 1 north to MD 198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead. During the 1930s, the New Deal programs promulgated by President Franklin Roosevelt led to a heightened awareness of the parkway proposals; a 1937 report by the Maryland State Planning Commission increased awareness further. Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was called one of the deadliest roads in the world at the time) along with awareness of the need to mobilize national defense before World War II provided additional motivation for construction of the parkway.

In 1942, the Bureau of Public Roads began the process to start the construction design for the parkway. Federal and state officials commissioned the J. E. Greiner Company to create designs for the parkway, which included a large Y-junction at the southern terminus to connect with New York Avenue and the proposed Anacostia Freeway. Meanwhile, the northern end included a similar wye, with one end running to US 40 (Franklin Street) and the other end crossing the Inner Harbor, but this was modified in 1945 to the current configuration.

=== Construction ===
Construction on the northern portion of the highway began in 1947 by the state of Maryland, while construction on the NPS segment started in 1950. The land for the portion that was to be built by the NPS was acquired at the same time as Greenbelt Park, a park that is under the jurisdiction of the NPS. The state-maintained portion was completed in December 1950 between MD 46 (now I-195) and Hollins Ferry Road at the Baltimore city line and in 1952 from MD 175 to MD 46. The portion of the parkway within the city of Baltimore opened in 1951 while the NPS-maintained portion opened in October 1954. The portion of the road not maintained by the NPS was known as the Baltimore–Washington Expressway while the section maintained by the NPS was called the Baltimore–Washington Parkway.

=== Post-construction ===
Around the time the highway was completed, the federal government began to promote suburbanization by moving several federal agencies out of the capital in order to protect them against nuclear attack. As a result, suburban neighborhoods began to appear in Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt. In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading to suburban growth that would eventually cause the two distinct cities to merge into one large metropolitan area.

In 1963, the State Roads Commission, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Public Roads (the predecessor of the Federal Highway Administration) (FHWA) created tentative plans to transfer the NPS segment of the parkway to the state of Maryland, who would then rebuild it to modern freeway standards, with trucks and buses permitted throughout. The plan collapsed due to the state&#x27;s reluctance to spend the money necessary to reconstruct the parkway, which was one of the most dangerous roads in the NPS road system.

In 1965, the Goddard Space Flight Center constructed the interchange for its employee entrance.
In 1968, the State Roads Commission proposed to the FHWA that the parkway be included in the Interstate Highway System and designated Interstate 295 (in anticipation of the completion of the parallel-running I-95 that occurred in 1971). The designation was granted in 1969, but later withdrawn from all except the current portion signed as I-295 due to lack of funds available to modernize the route. As a result of the withdrawal of the Interstate designation, the parkway remained an unnumbered road south of I-695 while the portion north of there became a part of MD 3 by 1975. Despite this setback, however, plans still existed to widen the parkway to six or even eight lanes. Even though the 1970 Federal Highway Act provided $65 million (equivalent to $ in ) for this purpose, funding was insufficient to execute these projects. The cancellation of the North Central Freeway and the Northeast Freeway (I-95&#x27;s routing between New York Avenue and the College Park Interchange) offered a chance for modernization, as plans existed to route I-95 via the B–W Parkway; however, this did not happen and trucks were banned from the parkway again.

By 1973, MD 3 was designated along the Baltimore–Washington Expressway between I-695 and Monroe Street in Baltimore. MD 295 was designated along the state-maintained portions of the expressway, replacing the MD 3 designation between I-695 and Monroe Street, by 1981. By the 1990s, the portion of the road known as the Baltimore–Washington Expressway became known as the Baltimore–Washington Parkway.

In the mid-1980s, the National Park Service, along with the Federal Highway Administration, began a reconstruction of the NPS segment to modernize the road, including the improvement of several interchanges. Around 2002, the federal government completed the project with the reconstruction of the MD 197 interchange.

In 2004, Maryland Governor Robert L. Ehrlich announced plans to widen portions of MD 295 near Baltimore–Washington International Airport. The MDSHA widened the parkway from two lanes on each side to three lanes on each side from I-195 north to I-695. Construction on the $12.4 million project, which began in late 2008, was completed in late 2011. The widening made use of the median as the extra travel lanes were to be added inside of each carriageway.

The Maryland State Highway Administration closed the southbound ramps of the interchange between the Baltimore–Washington Parkway and Arundel Mills Boulevard starting Monday, May 7, 2012. The closure was for the expedited replacement of the existing dumbbell interchange with Maryland&#x27;s first diverging diamond interchange. The new interchange was part of $5 million in road upgrades being funded by the Cordish Company ahead of the June 6 opening of the company&#x27;s Maryland Live! development, which features a casino, near Arundel Mills. The new interchange opened on June 11.
=== Dedications ===
In 1983, the NPS-maintained section of the Baltimore–Washington Parkway was named in honor of Gladys Noon Spellman, a congresswoman who represented Maryland&#x27;s 5th congressional district from January 3, 1975, to January 3, 1981, after a bill introduced into the United States Senate by Senator Paul Sarbanes was signed into law. Gladys Noon Spellman was an educator in Prince George&#x27;s County and chairperson of the National Mental Health Study Center before becoming the first woman to serve on the county&#x27;s Board of Commissioners. She suffered a heart attack that ended her congressional career on October 31, 1980, leaving her in a coma until her death on June 19, 1988. On May 9, 1991, the Baltimore–Washington Parkway was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== Incidents ===
In 1989, an overpass being built at MD 198 over the B–W Parkway just east of Laurel collapsed during rush hour, injuring fourteen motorists and construction workers. The incident was blamed on faulty scaffolding used to support the uncompleted span. On July 9, 2005, a sinkhole opened beneath the parkway at a construction site, leading to the complete closure of the northbound roadway. The sinkhole was filled with concrete to shore up the roadbed and prevent further collapse; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers attempted to expedite repairs, but the route remained closed until the next day. On August 24, 2007, both directions of the parkway were closed when chunks of concrete fell from the overpass at MD 193 (Greenbelt Road) onto the northbound lanes.

=== Renovation ===

MD 295 is planned to be widened to six lanes between MD 100 and I-195, and a new interchange is planned to be constructed at Hanover Road. The type of interchange has not yet been decided upon with choices including a diamond interchange, a single-point urban interchange, and a modified cloverleaf interchange. Planning for the $24 million project concluded in 2012.

In September 2017, Governor Larry Hogan announced a plan to widen the Baltimore–Washington Parkway by four lanes, adding express toll lanes to the median, as part of a $9 billion proposal to widen roads in Maryland. The project would be a public-private partnership with private companies responsible for constructing, operating, and maintaining the lanes. As part of the proposal, the portion of the parkway owned by the National Park Service would be transferred to the Maryland Transportation Authority.

In 2019, portions of the National Park Service segment of the Baltimore–Washington Parkway experienced significant pavement deterioration, including several potholes. In March 2019, the speed limit was reduced on the section of the parkway between MD 197 and MD 32 due to poor road conditions. After pressure from Governor Hogan and the state&#x27;s congressional delegation, the National Park Service announced that emergency pothole repairs would take place from MD 197 to MD 198 on the weekend of March 30–31, 2019, with a complete repave to begin in April 2019, several months ahead of schedule. Repaving of the section between MD 198 and MD 175 occurred later in the year.

<doc id="413435" wikidata="Q609726" url="?curid=413435" title="Narragansett people">
<text>The Narragansett people are an Algonquian American Indian tribe from Rhode Island. Today, Narragansett people are enrolled in the federally recognized Narragansett Indian Tribe. They gained federal recognition in 1983.

The tribe was nearly landless for most of the 20th century but acquired land in 1991 and petitioned the Department of the Interior to take the land into trust on their behalf. This would have made the newly acquired land officially recognized as part of the Narragansett Indian reservation, taking it out from under Rhode Island&#x27;s legal authority. In 2009, the United States Supreme Court ruled against the request in their lawsuit &quot;Carcieri v. Salazar&quot;, declaring that tribes which had achieved federal recognition since the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act did not have standing to have newly acquired lands taken into federal trust and removed from state control.

==Reservation==
The Narragansett tribe was recognized by the federal government in 1983 and controls the Narragansett Indian Reservation, of trust lands in Charlestown, Rhode Island. A small portion of the tribe resides on or near the reservation, according to the 2000 U.S. Census. Additionally, they own several hundred acres in Westerly.

In 1991, the Narragansetts purchased in Charlestown for development of elderly housing. In 1998, they requested that the Department of the Interior take the property into trust on behalf of the tribe, to remove it from state and local control. The case went to the United States Supreme Court, as the state challenged the removal of new lands from state oversight by a tribe recognized by the US after the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act. Rhode Island was joined in its appeal by 21 other states.

In 2009, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Department of the Interior could not take land into trust, removing it from state control, if a tribe had achieved federal recognition after the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, and if the land in question was acquired after that federal recognition. Their determination was based on wording in the act which defines &quot;Indian&quot; as &quot;all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized tribe now under federal jurisdiction.&quot;

==Government==
The tribe is led by an elected tribal council, a chief &quot;sachem&quot;, a medicine man, and a Christian leader. The entire tribal population must approve major decisions. 

The administration in 2023 was:

* Chief Sachem: Anthony Dean Stanton (Crawling Wolf)
* Medicine Man: John Brown

Tribal Council

Cassius Spears, Jr., 1st Councilman

Mike Monroe Sr, 2nd Councilman

Councilman: John Pompey

Councilman: Lonny Brown, Sr.

Councilwoman: Yvonne Lamphere

Councilman: Keith Sampson

Councilman: Shawn Perry

Councilman: John Mahoney

Councilman, Raymond Lamphere

Tribal Secretary, Monica Stanton

Assistant Tribal Secretary: Betty Johnson

Tribal Treasurer: Mary S. Brown

Assistant Tribal Treasurer: Walter K. Babcock

==Name and origin of name==
Some present-day Narragansett people believe that their name means &quot;people of the little points and bays&quot;. Pritzker&#x27;s &quot;Native American Encyclopedia&quot; translates the name as &quot;(People) of the Small Point&quot;.

As a result of colonization, there was a great decline of Narragansett language speakers in the 19th century, so modern attempts to understand its words have to make use of written sources. The earliest such sources are the writings of English colonists in the 1600s, and at that time the name of the Narragansett people was spelled in a variety of different ways, perhaps attesting to different local pronunciations. The present spelling &quot;Narragansett&quot; was first used by Massachusetts governor John Winthrop in his &quot;History of New England&quot; (1646); but assistant governor Edward Winslow spelled it &quot;Nanohigganset&quot;, while Rhode Island preacher Samuel Gorton preferred &quot;Nanhyganset&quot;; Roger Williams, who founded the city of Providence and came into closest contact with the Narragansett people, used a host of different spellings including &quot;Nanhiggonsick&quot;, &quot;Nanhigonset&quot;, &quot;Nanihiggonsicks&quot;, &quot;Nanhiggonsicks&quot;, &quot;Narriganset&quot;, &quot;Narrogonset&quot;, and &quot;Nahigonsicks&quot;.

Underneath this diversity of spelling a common phonetic background can be discerned. Linguist James Hammond Trumbull explains that &quot;naiag&quot; or &quot;naiyag&quot; means a corner or angle in the Algonquian languages, so that the prefix &quot;nai&quot; is found in the names of many points of land on the sea coast and rivers of New England (e.g. Nayatt Point in Barrington, RI, and Noyack on Long Island). The word &quot;nai-ig-an-set&quot;, according to Trumbull, signifies &quot;the territory about the point&quot;, and &quot;nai-ig-an-eog&quot; means &quot;the people of the point&quot;.

Roger Williams spent much time learning and studying the Narragansett language, and he wrote a definitive study on it in 1643 entitled &quot;A Key Into the Language of America&quot;. He traced the source of the word &quot;Narragansett&quot; to a geographical location:

Being inquisitive of what root the title or denomination Nahigonset should come I heard that Nahigonsset was so named from a little island, between Puttaquomscut and Mishquomacuk on the sea and fresh water side. I went on purpose to see it, and about the place called Sugar Loaf Hill I saw it and was within a pole of it [&quot;i.e. a rod or feet&quot; ], but could not learn why it was called Nahigonset.

Berkeley anthropologist William Simmons (1938-2018), who specialized in the Narragansett people, gives Roger Williams&#x27;s statement as the last word on the matter, indicating that the precise location of the place seen by Williams could not be determined.

But in fact Roger Williams&#x27;s statement does enable a fairly precise localization: He states that the place was &quot;a little island, between Puttaquomscut and Mishquomacuk on the sea and fresh water side&quot;, and that it was near Sugar Loaf Hill. This means it was: 
*between the Pettaquamscutt (or Narrow) river to the east, and the present town of Westerly to the west (the &quot;sea side&quot; and &quot;fresh water side&quot; indicating East and West respectively in that location); 
*to the north of Point Judith Pond (where Sugar Loaf Hill is located). 
This suggests that the original Narragansett homeland was identified by 17th-century natives as being a little island located near the northern edge of Point Judith Pond, possibly Harbor Island or one of the smaller islands there.

===Salt Pond Archaeological Site===
In 1987, while conducting a survey for a development company, archaeologists from Rhode Island College discovered the remains of an Indian village on a site northeast of Point Judith Pond, adjacent to the land where the Salt Pond Shopping Center was subsequently built. The archaeological site has since been purchased by the State of Rhode Island, and is known as the Salt Pond Archaeological Site or Salt Pond Preserve, and is designated in the Rhode Island Historical Preservation &amp; Heritage Commission inventory of recorded archaeological sites as site RI 110. Excavations revealed the remains of a coastal village from the Late Woodland period, inhabited by about 100 people for about four years, sometime in the tenth or eleventh centuries A.D. Evidence of houses and other structures was found, as well as food storage pits, and evidence of maize farming. The find turned out to be an important one, because no other Native American coastal village has ever been found in the Northeastern United States. A documentary film about the site was sponsored by the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, with support from the Federal Highway Administration, and aired on Rhode Island PBS in November 2015. Excerpts can be seen on Vimeo.

==Language==
Traditionally, the tribe spoke the Narragansett language, a member of the Algonquian languages family. The Narragansetts spoke a &quot;Y-dialect&quot;, similar enough to the &quot;N-dialects&quot; of the Massachusett and Wampanoag to be mutually intelligible. Other Y-dialects include the Shinnecock and Pequot languages spoken historically by tribes on Long Island and in Connecticut, respectively.

The Narragansett language became almost entirely extinct during the 20th century. The tribe has begun language revival efforts, based on early 20th-century books and manuscripts, and new teaching programs.

In the 17th century, Roger Williams learned the tribe&#x27;s language. He documented it in his 1643 work &quot;A Key into the Language of America&quot;. In that book Williams gave the tribe&#x27;s name as &quot;Nanhigganeuck&quot; though later he used the spelling &quot;Nahigonset&quot;.

American English has absorbed a number of loan words from Narragansett and other closely related languages, such as Wampanoag and Massachusett. Such words include &quot;quahog&quot;, &quot;moose&quot;, &quot;papoose&quot;, &quot;powwow&quot;, &quot;squash&quot;, and &quot;succotash&quot;.

==History==
The Narragansetts were one of the leading tribes of New England, controlling the west of Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island and portions of Connecticut and eastern Massachusetts, from the Providence River on the northeast to the Pawcatuck River on the southwest. The first European contact was in 1524 when explorer Giovanni de Verrazzano visited Narragansett Bay.

Between 1616 and 1619, infectious diseases killed thousands of Algonquians in coastal areas south of Rhode Island. The Narragansetts were the most powerful tribe in the southern area of the region when the English colonists arrived in 1620, and they had not been affected by the epidemics. Chief Massasoit of the Wampanoags to the east allied with the colonists at Plymouth Colony as a way to protect the Wampanoags from Narragansett attacks. In the fall of 1621, the Narragansetts sent a sheaf of arrows wrapped in a snakeskin to Plymouth Colony as a threatening challenge, but Plymouth governor William Bradford sent the snakeskin back filled with gunpowder and bullets. The Narragansetts understood the message and did not attack them.

European settlement in the Narragansett territory did not begin until 1635; in 1636, Roger Williams acquired land from Narragansett sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi and established Providence Plantations.

===Pequot War===
During the Pequot War of 1637, the Narragansetts allied with the New England colonists. However, the brutality of the colonists in the Mystic massacre shocked the Narragansetts, who returned home in disgust. After the Pequots were defeated, the colonists gave captives to their allies the Narragansetts and the Mohegans.

The Narragansetts later had conflict with the Mohegans over control of the conquered Pequot land. In 1643, Miantonomi led the Narragansetts in an invasion of eastern Connecticut where they planned to subdue the Mohegans and their leader Uncas. Miantonomi had an estimated 1,000 men under his command. The Narragansett forces fell apart, and Miantonomi was captured. The Mohegans then took Miantonomi to Hartford to turn him in for his execution, to which they were in favor but did not want blood on their hands, so they returned him to the Mohegans for his demise. While travelling back in the forests of northern Connecticut, Uncas&#x27;s brother slew Miantonomi by bludgeoning him on the head with a club. The following year, Narragansett war leader Pessicus renewed the war with the Mohegans, and the number of Narragansett allies grew.

The Mohegans were on the verge of defeat when the colonists came and saved them, sending troops to defend the Mohegan fort at Shantok. The colonists then threatened to invade Narragansett territory, so Canonicus and his son Mixanno signed a peace treaty. The peace lasted for the next 30 years.

===King Philip&#x27;s War===
Christian missionaries began to convert tribal members and many Indians feared that they would lose their traditions by assimilating into colonial culture, and the colonists&#x27; push for religious conversion collided with Indian resistance. In 1675, John Sassamon, a converted &quot;Praying Indian&quot;, was found bludgeoned to death in a pond. The facts were never settled concerning Sassamon&#x27;s death, but historians accept that Wampanoag sachem Metacomet (known as Philip) may have ordered his execution because Sassamon cooperated with colonial authorities. Three Wampanoag men were arrested, convicted, and hanged for Sassamon&#x27;s death.

Metacomet subsequently declared war on the colonists and started King Philip&#x27;s War. He escaped an attempt to trap him in the Plymouth Colony, and the uprising spread throughout Massachusetts as other bands joined the fight, such as the Nipmuc. The Indians wanted to expel the colonists from New England. They waged successful attacks on settlements in Massachusetts and Connecticut, but Rhode Island was spared at the beginning, as the Narragansetts remained officially neutral.

However, the leaders of the United Colonies (Massachusetts, Plymouth, and Connecticut) accused the Narragansetts of harboring Wampanoag refugees. They made a preemptive attack on the Narragansett palisade fortress on December 19, 1675 in a battle that became known as the Great Swamp Fight. Hundreds of Narragansett non-combatants died in the attack and burning of the fort, including women and children, but nearly all of the warriors escaped. In January 1676, colonist Joshua Tefft was hanged, drawn, and quartered by colonial forces at Smith&#x27;s Castle in Wickford, Rhode Island for having fought on the side of the Narragansetts during the Great Swamp Fight.

The Indians retaliated for the massacre in a widespread spring offensive beginning in February 1676 in which they destroyed all Colonial settlements on the western side of Narragansett Bay. The settlement of Providence Plantations was burned on March 27, 1676, destroying Roger Williams&#x27;s house, among others. Other Indian groups destroyed many towns throughout New England, and even raided outlying settlements near Boston. However, disease, starvation, battle losses, and the lack of gunpowder caused the Indian effort to collapse by the end of March.

Troops from Connecticut composed of colonists and their Mohegan allies swept into Rhode Island and killed substantial numbers of the now-weakened Narragansetts. A force of Mohegans and Connecticut militia captured Narragansett sachem Canonchet a few days after the destruction of Providence Plantations, while a force of Plymouth militia and Wampanoags hunted down Metacomet. He was shot and killed, ending the war in southern New England, although it dragged on for another two years in Maine.

After the war, the colonists sold some surviving Narragansetts into slavery and shipped them to the Caribbean; others became indentured servants in Rhode Island. The surviving Narragansetts merged with local tribes, particularly the Eastern Niantics. During colonial and later times, tribe members intermarried with colonists and Africans. Their spouses and children were taken into the tribe, enabling them to keep a tribal and cultural identity.

===18th century===
Ninigret, the chief sachem of the Narragansetts during King Philip&#x27;s War, died soon after the war. He left four children by two wives. His eldest child, a daughter, succeeded him, and upon her death her half-brother Ninigret succeeded her. He left a will dated 1716–17, and died about 1722. His sons Charles Augustus and George succeeded him as sachems. George&#x27;s son Thomas, commonly known as King Tom, succeeded in 1746. While King Tom was sachem, much of the Narragansett land was sold, and a considerable part of the tribe emigrated to the State of New York, joining other Indians there who belonged to the same Algonquin language group.

Nevertheless, in the 1740s during the First Great Awakening, colonists founded the Narragansett Indian Church to convert Indians to Christianity. In the ensuing years, the tribe retained control and ownership of the church and its surrounding , the only land that it could keep. This continuous ownership was critical evidence of tribal continuity when the tribe applied for federal recognition in 1983.

===19th century===
In the 19th century, the tribe resisted repeated state efforts to declare that it was no longer an Indian tribe because its members were multiracial in ancestry. They contended that they absorbed other ethnicities into their tribe and continued to identify culturally as Narragansetts.

The tribal leaders resisted increasing legislative pressure after the American Civil War to &quot;take up citizenship&quot; in the United States, which would have required them to give up their treaty privileges and Indian nation status. The Narragansetts had a vision of themselves as &quot;a nation rather than a race&quot;, and they insisted on their rights to Indian national status and its privileges by treaty.

While testifying about this issue in a meeting with a committee of the state legislature in 1876, a Narragansett delegation said that their people saw injustices under existing US citizenship. They noted Jim Crow laws that limited the rights of blacks despite their citizenship under constitutional amendments. They also resisted suggestions that multiracial members of the tribe could not qualify as full members of the tribe. The Narragansetts had a tradition of bringing other people into their tribe by marriage and having them assimilate as culturally Narragansett, especially as their children grew up in the tribe. According to a record of their statement, they said:

We are not negroes, we are the heirs of Ninagrit, and of the great chiefs and warriors of the Narragansetts. Because, when your ancestors stole the negro from Africa and brought him amongst us and made a slave of him, we extended him the hand of friendship, and permitted his blood to be mingled with ours, are we to be called negroes? And to be told that we may be made negro citizens? We claim that while one drop of Indian blood remains in our veins, we are entitled to the rights and privileges guaranteed by your ancestors to ours by solemn treaty, which without a breach of faith you cannot violate.

From 1880 to 1884, the state persisted in its efforts at &quot;detribalization.&quot; The tribe had agreed to negotiations for sale of its land, but it quickly regretted the decision and worked to regain the land. In 1880, the state recognized 324 Narragansett tribal members as claimants to the land during negotiations. The state put tribal lands up for public sale in the 19th century, but the tribe did not disperse and its members continued to practice its culture.

===20th century===

The Narragansetts lost control of much of their tribal lands during the state&#x27;s late 19th-century detribalization, but they kept a group identity. The tribe incorporated in 1900 and built their longhouse in 1940 as a traditional place for gatherings and ceremonies.

In the late 20th century, they took action to have more control over their future. They regained of their land in 1978, and gained federal recognition as a tribe in 1983. According to tribal rolls, there are approximately 2,400 members of the Narragansett Tribe today. Like most Americans, they have mixed ancestry, with descent from the Narragansetts and other tribes of the New England area, as well as Europeans and Africans.

===21st century===
A 2006 survey conducted in preparation for development of a new residential subdivision revealed what archaeologists consider the remains of a Narragansett Indian village dating from 1100 to 1300. It is located at the top of Point Judith Pond in Narragansett, Rhode Island. This area had been identified in a 1980s survey as historically sensitive, and the state had a conflict with the developer when more remains were found. The state intervened in order to prevent development and to buy the 25-acre site for preservation; it was part of 67 acres planned for development by the new owner.

Further archaeological excavation on the site quickly revealed that it was one of two villages on the Atlantic Coast to be found in such complete condition. The other pre-Columbian village (&quot;Otan&quot; in Narragansett Algonquin) is in Virginia. It has a high concentration of permanent structures.

Preliminary surveys of the Narragansett tract, known as RI 110, have revealed a village with perhaps as many 22 structures, as well as three known human burial sites. There is also evidence of granaries, ceremonial areas and storage pits that may shed new light on the importance of maize agriculture to woodland tribes. 

Historians and archeologists knew that maize was cultivated by Algonquin tribes, but there has never been physical evidence before the discovery of this site. The tribe&#x27;s method of grinding the kernels into a powder was not conducive to preservation. In the first week of excavation, 78 kernels of corn were found at this site, the first time that cultivation of maize could be confirmed this far north on the Atlantic Coast.

The current members of the Narragansett tribe have contributed through oral history to accounts about the ancient people who inhabited this site. They were members of the Turtle Clan, and the settlement was a conduit for trade in medicines. They used the surrounding pond and its many islands for hunting camps, resource collection, fishing, shellfish, burial sites, and herbal collections for medicine and ceremony.

Providence founder Roger Williams was brought to the top of Sugarloaf Hill in nearby Wakefield when treating with the Narragansett tribe. They pointed toward this large settlement and told him that it was called &quot;Nanihigonset&quot;. This site is now believed to be the center of the Narragansett geography, where they coalesced as a tribe and began to extend their dominion over the neighboring tribes at different points in history.

===Land claim suit===
In January 1975, the Narragansett Tribe filed suit in federal court to regain of land in southern Rhode Island which they claimed the state had illegally taken from them in 1880. The 1880 Act authorizing the state to negotiate with the tribe listed 324 Narragansetts approved by the Supreme Court as claimants to the land.

In 1978, the Narragansett Tribe signed a Joint Memorandum of Understanding (JMOU) with the state of Rhode Island, Town of Charlestown, and private property owners in settlement of their land claim. The state transferred a total of to a corporation formed to hold the land in trust for descendants of the 1880 Narragansett Roll. In exchange, the tribe agreed that the laws of Rhode Island would be in effect on those lands, except for hunting and fishing. The Narragansetts had not yet been federally recognized as a tribe.

===Federal recognition===
The tribe prepared extensive documentation of its genealogy and proof of continuity as descendants of the 324 tribal members of treaty status. In 1979 the tribe applied for federal recognition, which it finally regained in 1983 as the Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island (the official name used by the Bureau of Indian Affairs).

==Current events==
The state and tribe have disagreed on certain rights on the reservation. On July 14, 2003, Rhode Island state police raided a tribe-run smoke shop on the Charlestown reservation, the culmination of a dispute over the tribe&#x27;s failure to pay state taxes on its sale of cigarettes. In 2005, the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals declared the police action a violation of the tribe&#x27;s sovereignty. In 2006, an &quot;en banc&quot; decision of the First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the prior decision, stating that the raid did not violate the tribe&#x27;s sovereign immunity because of the 1978 Joint Memorandum of Agreement settling the land issues, in which the tribe agreed that state law would be observed on its land.

In a separate federal civil rights lawsuit, the tribe charged the police with the use of excessive force during the 2003 raid on the smoke shop. One Narragansett man suffered a broken leg in the confrontation. The case was being retried in the summer of 2008. Competing police experts testified on each side of the case.

The Narragansett Tribe is negotiating with the General Assembly for approval to build a casino in Rhode Island with their partner, currently Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment. The Rhode Island Constitution declares to be illegal all non-state-run lotteries or gambling. A proposed constitutional amendment to allow the tribe to build the casino was voted down by state residents in November 2006.

The tribe has plans to upgrade the Longhouse that it constructed along RI Route 2 (South County Trail) to serve as a place of American Indian cuisine and cultural meeting house. These plans have been in the works for more than 15 years. The Longhouse was built in 1940 and has fallen into disrepair. Upgrades are also being planned for the Narragansett tribal medical, technological, and artistic systems.

The Narragansetts have undertaken efforts to review tribal rolls and reassess applications for membership, like numerous other tribes in the 21st century. They currently require tribal members to show direct descent from one or more of the 324 members listed on the 1880-84 Roll, which was established when Rhode Island negotiated land sales.

The current population numbers about 4,000 and the tribe has closed the rolls. They have dropped some people from the rolls and denied new applications for membership. Scholars and activists see this as a national trend among tribes, prompted by a variety of factors, including internal family rivalries and the issue of significant new revenues from Indian casinos. Many of the removed would later form and join the unrecognized Northern Narragansett Tribe.

The US Supreme Court agreed to hear &quot;Carcieri v. Salazar&quot; (2009) in the fall of 2008, a case determining American Indian land rights. The Court ruled in favor of Rhode Island in February 2009. The suit was brought by the state of Rhode Island against the Department of the Interior (DOI) over its authority to take land into trust on behalf of certain American Indians.

The authority was part of the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, but the state argued that the process could not hold for tribes that achieved federal recognition after 1934. The US Supreme Court upheld the state based on language in the act. At issue is of land in Charlestown which the Narragansetts purchased in 1991. The Narragansetts requested the DOI to take it into trust on their behalf in order to remove it from state and local control, after trying to develop it for elderly housing under state regulations in 1998.

==Cultural institutions==
The tribe hosts their annual meeting powwow on the second weekend of August on their reservation in Charlestown, Rhode Island. It is a gathering of thanksgiving and honor to the Narragansett people and is the oldest recorded powwow in North America, dating back to 1675&#x27;s colonial documentation of the gathering (the powwow had been held long before European contact).

In August 2017, the tribe held the 342nd powwow with events including the traditional grand entry, a procession of military veterans, dancers, and honored tribal representatives, and the ceremonial lighting of a sacred fire. There was also a church service, food vendors, and arts and crafts.

<text>Puebla, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Puebla, is one of the 31 states that, along with Mexico City, comprise the Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 217 municipalities and its capital is Puebla City. Part of east-central Mexico, it is bordered by the states of Veracruz to the north and east, Hidalgo, México, Tlaxcala and Morelos to the west, and Guerrero and Oaxaca to the south. The origins of the state lie in the city of Puebla, which was founded by the Spanish in this valley in 1531 to secure the trade route between Mexico City and the port of Veracruz. By the end of the 18th century, the area had become a colonial province with its own governor, which would become the State of Puebla, after the Mexican War of Independence in the early 19th century. Since that time the area, especially around the capital city, has continued to grow economically, mostly through industry, despite being the scene of a number of battles, the most notable of which being the Battle of Puebla. Today, the state is one of the most industrialized in the country, but since most of its development is concentrated in Puebla and other cities, many of its rural areas are undeveloped.

The state is home to the &quot;china poblana&quot;, mole poblano, active literary and arts scenes, and festivals such as Cinco de Mayo, Ritual of Quetzalcoatl, Day of the Dead celebrations (especially in Huaquechula) and Carnival (especially in Huejotzingo). It is home to five major indigenous groups: Nahuas, the Totonacs, the Mixtecs, the Popolocas and the Otomi, which can mostly be found in the far north and the far south of the state.

==Geography==

The state is in the central highlands of Mexico between the Sierra Nevada and the Sierra Madre Oriental. It has a triangular shape with its narrow part to the north. It borders the states of Veracruz, Oaxaca, Guerrero, Morelos, State of Mexico, Tlaxcala and Hidalgo. The state occupies 33,919 km2, ranking 20th of 31 states in size, and has 
4,930 named communities.

===Mountains===
Most of the mountains of Puebla belong to the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The first is locally called the Sierra Norte del Puebla, entering the state from the northwest and then breaks up into the smaller chains of Sierra de Zacapoaxtla, Sierra de Huauchinango, Sierra de Teziutlán, Sierra de Tetela de Ocampo, Sierra de Chignahuapan and Sierra de Zacatlán, although these names may vary among localities. Some of the highest elevations include Apulco, Chichat, Chignahuapan, Soltepec and Tlatlaquitepec. The highest elevations are the volcanoes Pico de Orizaba or Citlaltepetl (5,747masl), Popocatépetl (5,452masl), Iztaccíhuatl (5,286masl) and Malinche (4,461masl) which are found on the state&#x27;s borders with Veracruz, Mexico State and Tlaxcala respectively. In the south of the state, the major elevations are the Sierra de Atenahuacán, Zapotitlán, Lomerio al Suroeste and the Sierra de Tehuacán. Dividing much of the state from Veracruz is a small chain of mountains called the Sierra Madre del Golfo.

The natural geography of the state subdivides into the Huasteco Plateau, Llanuras y Lomeríos zone, Lagos y Volcanes del Anáhuac, Chiconquiaco, Llanuras y Sierras de Querétaro e Hidalgo, Cordillera Costera del Sur, Mixteca Alta, Sierras y Valles Guerrenses, Sierras Centrales de Oaxaca, Sierras Orientales and Sur de Puebla. The Huasteco Plateau and the Llanuras y Lomeríos zone are located in the north and northeast, with the Lagos y Volcanes del Anáhuc in the center and north. Together, they account for over 50% of the state. The east and northeast are occupies by the Chiconquiaco and Llanudras y Sierras de Querétaro e Hidalgo areas and account for about three percent of the state. The Cordillera del Sur and Mixteca Alta are located in the west and southwest covering less than 2.5% of the state. The Sur de Puebla is in the southwest and accounts for 26% of the state. Other southern subregions include the Sierras y Valles Guerrerenses, the Sierras Centrales de Oaxaca and the Sierras Orientales. Together, they account for about 15% of the state.

===Hydrology===

The hydrology of Puebla is formed by three major river systems. One is based on the Balsas River, also known as the Atoyac, which originates with the melting runoff of the Halos, Telapón and Papagayo mountains along with those from the Iztaccihuatl volcano and waters from the Zahuapan River, which enters from Tlaxcala. This river receives further water from tributaries such as the Acateno, Atila, Amacuzac, Molinos and Cohetzala. The river has one major dam called Valsequllo or Manuel Avila Camacho. This river eventually flows west to the Pacific Ocean. The next system empties into the Gulf of Mexico and consists of the Pantepec, Cazones, Necaxa, Laxaxalpan, San Pedro/Zun, Zempoala, Apulco, Cedro Viejo, Salteros, Martínez de la Torre and other rivers on the east side of the state. This system has two major dams called the Necaxa and Mazatepec. The third is the closed Oriental Basin, with a large number of small lakes fresh water springs as well as some volcanically heated springs. The best known of these include Chignahuapan, Agua Azúl, Amalucan, Cisnaqullas, Garcicrespo, Almoloya and Rancho Colorado. Lakes include Chapulco, San Bernardino, Lagunas Epatlán, Ayutla, Almoloyan, Alchichica, Pahuatlán, Las Minas, Aljojuca and Tecuitlapa.

===Climate===

Puebla has many different climates owing to its range of altitudes. It has an average temperature of but this varies greatly locally. There is a rainy season from May until October with an overall precipitation of . The state has eleven different climate zones, but five predominate. The centre and south of the state has a temperate and semi-moist climate, with an average temperature of and of rainfall. The southwest has a warm to hot and semi-moist climate with of precipitation and average temperature. The north is also warm and hot, and additionally very wet; it has a average temperature but with an average rainfall of . The southeast is semi-dry with warm and temperate temperatures, having an average temperature of and precipitation of . The high volcano peaks have a cold climate.

===Ecosystems===

The state has three main ecosystems, tropical rainforests, forests in temperate and cold areas, and arid and semi-arid zones.

Tropical forests are divided into moist, semi-moist and dry forests. These can be found in the Huasteca Plateau, Chiconguiaco, Lagos y Volcánes de Anahuac, Sur de Puebla, Cordillera Costera del Sur, Sierras y Valles Guerrerenses, Sierras Orientales, Sierras Centrales de Oaxaca and Mixteca Alta. The most common species include &quot;Ceiba parviflora, Bursera simaruba, Cedrela odorata, Swietenia macrophylla, Spondias mombin, Brosimum alicastrum, Coccoloba barbadensis, Pithecellobium arboreum, Lysiloma divaricatum, Phoebe tampicensis, Acacia coulteri&quot; and &quot;Ficus spp.&quot; These forests are also exploited for wood and other products, including traditional handcrafts. Low growing plants are used to feed livestock. Little is known about the ecosystems of these forests, but it is known that these areas are important to the regulation of water in area rivers. Human activity has severely damaged over 32,000 hectares.

Tropical forests are divided by altitude. Upper forests are characterized by dense vegetation in fairly humid climates. The tree canopy reaches an average height of 15 meters. Not all species are evergreen, with a number losing leaves during the dry season. During the same season, a number of species also flower. For this reason, these forests never completely lose their color. Common species include &quot;Cedrela sp., Brosimum alicastrum, Heliocarpus spp., Calophyllum brasiliense, Zuelania guidonia&quot; and &quot;Ficus spp.&quot; Most forests of this type are located near the borders with Veracruz and Hidalgo. Tropical forests at lower altitudes are found in areas with median temperatures of over 20 C, and annual rainfall of between 800 and . These areas often have a dry season of seven or eight months, and many of these forests will lose most or all of their leaves during this time. Common species include &quot;Bursera simaruba, Lysiloma divaricatum, Phoebe tampicensis, Acacia coulteri, Beaucarnea recurvata, Lysiloma acapulcensis&quot; and &quot;Zuelania guidonia&quot;.

Colder pine–oak forests can be found in the Huasteca Plateau, Sierra de Chiconquiaco, Lagos de Volcanos de Anáhuac, Sierras Orientales and Sierras Centrales de Oaxaca. These forests mostly consist of pines, oaks, oyamel fir and other conifers (&quot;Abies religiosa, Pinus pseudostrobus, Pinus attenuata, Pinus ayacahuite, Pinus leiophylla, Pinus patula, Pinus teocote, Quercus spp, Quercus rugosa, Alnus spp, Arbutus spp, Cupressus spp&quot; and &quot;Juniperus spp.&quot;). Much of these areas have been extensively logged and some areas are used to farm trees. These trees are used for wood, paper and other wood-derived products. Due to human activity over 107,000 hectares are considered to be severely damaged.

Temperate and cold area forests cover just under 22% of the surface of the state with various species of pine accounting for more than 80% of the trees. These are mostly found in the higher elevations of the mountains where the average temperature is around 15C and at heights of between 2,500 and 2,750masl. Above 3,000m &quot;Pinus hartwegii&quot; is dominant. Pine species which are the most economically valuable and include &quot;Pinus montezumae, Pinus pseudostrobus, Pinus ayacahuite, Pinus greggii, Pinus hartwegii, Pinus lawsonii, Pinus leiophylla, Pinus michoacana, Pinus oocarpa, Pinus patula&quot; and &quot;Pinus teocote&quot;. The second most common kind of forest is dominated by oyamel fir, often intermingling with pines and oaks. These forests are found at altitudes of between 2,500 and 3,600masl and with an average temperature of between 7 and 15C and annual precipitation of . Forests with trees such as &quot;Juniperus&quot; spp., &quot;Pseudotsuga spp., Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;, and &quot;Cupressus lindleyi&quot; can also be found.

The arid and semi arid area can be found in the Lagos y Volcanes de Anáhuac, Sur de Puebla, Cordillera Costera del Sur, Sierras y Valles Guerrerenses, Sierras Orientales and Sierras Centrales de Oaxaca. Types of vegetation often found includes mesquite, huizachal and agave, with species such as &quot;Agave&quot; spp, &quot;Yuca&quot; spp, &quot;Opuntia&quot; spp, &quot;Aristida&quot; spp., and &quot;Stipa&quot; spp. There is no forestry here but a number of plants are used for fibers, waxes, resins, handcrafts, medicine and a number are edible to both humans and livestock. Many of these arid areas subdivide into microclimates depending on minor variations in temperature and precipitation. Some areas, especially dry grasslands, have suffered overgrazing and soil erosion.

In the south, near Puebla&#x27;s borders with Oaxaca and Guerrero are dry mountainous areas, some of which are completely devoid of vegetation, similar to African deserts. Other are populated only by the occasional cactus, with those belonging to the &quot;Fouquieria&quot; genus standing out on the landscape. Where there are arroyos, the vegetation changes drastically to include a wide variety of plants packed along a narrow strip. Other areas in this part of the state are semi-arid, home to a variety of plant and bird species.

===Natural attractions===

Natural attractions in the state include the Bosque Mesófilos de la Sierra Madre Oriental in the north of the state, Piedras Encimadas Valley, Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park, La Malinche National Park, and the Pico de Orizaba National Park. The best known wilderness area is the Izta-Popo National park, which the state shares with neighboring State of Mexico. It is located only west of the state capital and the two often snow covered volcanoes are easily visible from this area, and important to the state culturally. The park is an area protected by the federal government because of its biological diversity and considered to be the &quot;lungs&quot; of the area due to its forests. Access to the park, especially to the volcanoes themselves is more restricted than in the past due to past ecological damage. Even further restrictions are put into place when the Popocatepetl volcano is active. However, the park has numerous hiking and horse paths in the forests that cover the lower elevations. On the slopes, there are many small caves, which in pre-Hispanic times were often used for ceremonies.

The Sierra Madre Oriental, locally called the Sierra Norte, is a series of rugged mountains covered in abundant vegetation, which has had an isolating effect on the people here over the centuries. The Valle de Piedras Encimadas (Valley of the Stacked Stones) is located near the town of Zacatlán. It is really a series of small valleys covering 400 hectares filled with conifer forest. The attraction here are the stone formations which resemble stones stacked one over the other which take on numerous forms. Some have been said to resemble objects such as dogs, elephants, human heads and monsters. Most of the area is only accessible by foot or horseback.

In the center of the state, just before the land rises to the north to form the Sierra Norte, there is an area called the Oriental Basin filled with lakes, both with water and dry. The dry lakebeds contain water only during the rainy season, which runs from summer through fall. The two largest are Salado and Totocingo Lakes. The first is seven km long and two km wide and the second is larger. The largest &quot;wet&quot; lakes are Laguna Preciosa, Laguna Quechulac, Laguna de Atexcac and Laguna de Aijojuca.

==History==
===Pre-Hispanic period===
The territory of the state was one of the first in modern Mexico to be inhabited by humans. Most of the earliest settlements have been found in the valley of Tehuacán, with the oldest near the Agujereado Mountain, which dates back to 10,000 BCE. At this site the oldest sample of corn ever found in the world has been found, which dates back to 1500 BCE. Along with Agujereado Mountain, there are more than 450 prehistoric sites in the Tehuacan Valley alone. Stone tools date to between 6500 and 4900 BCE, and evidence of agriculture to 3500 and 2000 BCE in areas such as Aljojuca, Totimiuacan, Cholula and Izucar. By 900 BCE, there is ample evidence of the cultivation of corn, beans, squash, chili peppers and cotton. The rise of city states was established by 700 BCE.

By the Mesoamerican period, the area was inhabited by a number of ethnicities. The regions of Acatlán and part of Chiautla were dominated by the Mixtecs. Tepexi was dominated by the Popolocas. The central part of the state was dominated by the Olmec-Xicalancas and Nahuas, with strong cultural links to the Toltec-based culture at Cholula. The north was populated by the Totonacs, the Mazatecs and the Otomi, whose cultural center was in El Tajín. In the 14th century, Nonoalca ruler Xelhua, came to dominate almost all of the territory of Puebla. In the 15th century, Aztec domination took over the same area and more. Initially, the center and south areas were under the control of Tenochtitlan with Texcoco dominant in the north. Aztec domination continued until the Spanish Conquest.

=== Viceroyalty of New Spain (1535–1821) ===
Hernán Cortés entered Puebla state in 1519, along with his indigenous allies from Veracruz, on his way to Tlaxcala. The Spanish takeover of the Puebla area was relatively easy. Many of the peoples here were under Aztec domination and saw the foreigners as a way to escape. One notable exception was the city of Cholula. While negotiating with the city&#x27;s leaders, Cortés was told of a plot to attack him and his men. Cortés ordered his army to commit the Massacre of Cholula on 12 October 1519. This act terrified those who opposed the Spanish and they submitted. In 1520, after his initial defeat in Tenochtitlan (La Noche Triste) Hernán Cortés founded a Spanish settlement at Tepeaca, and took areas such as Huaquechula and Itzocan. Many natives leaders then provided men and supplies for the conquest of Tenochtitlan in 1521, and later to go with Pedro de Alvarado to Guatemala. Local indigenous governments survived in the very early colonial period, subject to the Spanish. These included Tuchpa, Tzicoac, Metztitlán, Tlapacoyan, Atotonilco, Tlatlaquitepec, Huaxtepec, Tepeaca, Tlacozautitlán, Quiauhteopan, Yoaltepec, Teotitlán del Camino, Cuautochco and Coixtlahuacan.

The origins of the modern state lie in the founding of the city of Puebla in the Cuetlaxcoapan Valley in 1531 by Toribio de Benavente and Juan de Salmerón. The city was laid out by Hernando de Elgueta, marking out residential areas, commercial areas etc. The city received its royal seal in 1532 but flooding forced the settlement to move across the San Francisco River and start over that same year. The city&#x27;s (and now state&#x27;s) seal was granted in 1538. The city of Puebla was created to secure the route between Mexico City and the port of Veracruz, and was initially populated by soldiers and those who made a living by providing shelter and supplies to travelers between the two cities. However, it soon became the economic and cultural center of the valley areas between the Valley of Mexico and the Gulf Coast, as it provided a starting point for Spanish settlement. The area&#x27;s economy expanded rapidly as many Europeans and indigenous decided to settle permanently, with the settlement of Puebla reaching city status in 1532 with the name of Ciudad de los Angeles.


The Franciscans were in charge of the evangelization process in the state, starting from 1524, when they founded the monastery of Huejotzingo. Between 1540 and 1560, they founded others such as those in Tecamachalco, Quecholac, Tecali, Calpan, Cuautinchán, Zacatlán, Cholula, Huaquechula, Tepeaca, Tehuacán, Xalpa and Coatepec. The Augustinians arrived next, constructing monasteries in Chiautla, Chietla, Huatlatlauca, Tlapa, Xicotepec and Papaloticpac. The last of the evangelists were the Dominicans, who built monasteries at Izúcar de Matamoros, Tepapayeca, Huehuatlán and Tepexi. The bishopric was established in 1526. Initially, the seat was in the Yucatán, but it was eventually moved to Tlaxcala, then to Puebla by 1550. Eventually, its extension included the current states of Tlaxcala and Puebla during much of the colonial period.

In 1783, the royal government in Spain divided New Spain into &quot;intendencias&quot; or provinces, one of which was centered on the city of Puebla. The first governor of Puebla was Manuel de Flon, Count of La Cadena. Initially, this intendencia included Tlaxcala, but it was separated out in 1793. Other parts were eventually separated out into other provinces/states such as Mexico, Guerrero and Veracruz.

===Post-independence===
During the Mexican War of Independence, the city of Puebla remained loyal to the viceroy in Mexico City, sending troops to defend it at the Battle of Monte de las Cruces against Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. Ecclesiastical authorities in the Cathedral excommunicated insurgent priests and battles took place in Izúcar and Chiautla. Most of the south of the state, especially Izucar and the Sierra Mixteca were firmly in insurgent hands. Control then bypassed the capital and reached the more northern settlements of Tehuacan and Atlixco. After Independence, the first governor of the state was Carlos García Arriaga in 1821. The first state congress was seated in 1824, with the first state constitution adopted the same year. The new state was divided initially into 21 parts. The Spanish were expelled from the state in 1827. In 1849, the state was reorganized into eight departments and 162 municipalities and again in 1895 with 21 districts and 180 municipalities.

During the rest of the 19th century, the state developed economically through industry. The first mechanized textile mill was established in 1831, soon followed by 17 others in the city of Puebla. Progress was interrupted by Santa Anna&#x27;s siege of the city in 1845 and two years later when the Americans under General Winfield Scott took the city on their way to Mexico City. The Americans left three years later at the end of the war.
Much of the rest of the century was occupied with civil strife such as the insurrection of Francisco Ortega against the federal government, the Reform War and the French Intervention. The last provoked the Battle of Puebla on 5 May 1862, when 6,000 French troops attacked the forts named Loreto and Guadalupe outside of the city of Puebla, but they were repelled by forces under Ignacio Zaragoza. Zaragoza died some months after this battle, and he would be later honored by having his name added to that of the city. However, less than a year later, the city would be taken and shortly after, Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico would be installed. However, his rule would be brief and the French, along with their conservative Mexican allies, were expelled from the state in 1867.

From this time to the Mexican Revolution, a number of important infrastructure projects were undertaken. One was the Puebla-Veracruz rail line in 1873 and the Escuela Normal para Profesores (Teachers’ College) in 1879. In 1907, a hydroelectric plant was built in Necaxa. However, the economic policies of this area caused widespread unrest, beginning with workers’ strikes. Directly against the regime of Porfirio Díaz was the Club Antireeleccionista (Anti-reelection Club) headed by Aquiles Serdán in 1909. In November 1910, after long government surveillance, troops attacked the Serdán house in Puebla killing Aquiles and his brother Máximo. For this reason, the state claims one of the first battles of the Mexican Revolution.

===Following the Mexican Revolution===
In 1912, the Liberation Army of the South or Zapatistas took over a number of communities in the state. In 1914, they were challenged by forces loyal to Venustiano Carranza, which occupied the capital briefly. However, the Zapatistas would hold power for the rest of the war. Under the 1917 Constitution, the state was reestablished with 222 municipalities. One of the last skirmishes of the war occurred in Aljibes, Puebla in May 1920 when forces of Álvaro Obregón attacked those of Carranza as he was headed to Veracruz. Carranza was assassinated in Tlaxcalantongo in the Sierra Norte de Puebla soon thereafter.

The 1920s immediately after the war was marked by instability. The governorship changed hands frequently with resistance to whoever was in power from other parts of the state. Despite this, the Universidad de Puebla was established by Maximino Ávila Camacho during this decade. True political stability would not come until the governorship of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz in 1942.

===Modern times===
Since the Mexican Revolution, the city of Puebla and its suburbs are one of the most industrialized areas in Mexico, with the metropolitan area ranked fourth in size. Its position near both Mexico City and the Gulf coast continues to be an advantage. However, modern development of the city area has been restricted to outside the city center, in order to preserve its traditional look. This historic center was named a World Heritage Site in 1987, with the Biblioteca Palafoxiana named as part of the Memory of the World Programme in 2005. Today, Puebla&#x27;s economic development is centered on its capital. This capital is part of the megalopolis centered on Mexico City.

In 1977, the center of the city of Puebla was named a &quot;Zone of Historic Monuments&quot;. The same area was later named a World Heritage Site in 1987. In 1979, Puebla was the scene of one of Pope John Paul II&#x27;s early papal visits outside Italy to Mexico for that year&#x27;s CELAM conference over three months after his election and papal inauguration.

In 1998, the state was declared in a state of emergency due to 122 forest fires with affected 2,998 hectares of land over two weeks. Many of the fires were started by fires on agricultural lands and the extremely dry conditions made the fires out of control.

The 1999 Tehuacán earthquake did major damage to much of state, especially many of its colonial era churches, and the colonial buildings of the historic center of the city of Puebla. The state of Puebla was declared a disaster area.

In the 2000s, organizations such as Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF) have accused state governmental officials of restricting and suppressing the press. Some of the threats against reporters have included false arrests and death threats.

More than two years after the 2017 Puebla earthquake when 621 buildings—mostly 16th to 19th-century churches—were damaged in the state, 46 have been restored, 88 are in process, and 380 have not been restored at all.

==Demographics==
=== Largest cities===


In 2005, the state had a population of 5,383,133 according to the INEGI census, ranking fifth in the country. Over 93% of the state&#x27;s population identifies as Roman Catholic with 4.4% identifying as Protestant or Evangelical.

In 1921, Puebla had the second largest population, after Oaxaca, of purely indigenous people according to the national census. Since then, the official census has eliminated categories for race, counting only those who speak an indigenous language. In 2000, an attempt was made to count indigenous ethnicities, regardless of language spoken. This count ranked Puebla as fifth with a total population of 957,650. However, according to the 2005 census, there were 548,723 people who spoke an indigenous language. According to a 2000 census, Censo General de Población y Vivienda, Puebla has the highest number of Nahuatl speakers over 5 years of age. There are 416,968 speakers making up about 8.21% of the population of the state.

The state has five major indigenous ethnic groups: the Nahuas, the Totonacs, the Mixtecs, the Popolocas and the Otomi. The state has two well-defined areas in which indigenous peoples still maintain many ancient traditions, rites, and customs. These two regions are called the Sierra Norte in the north and the Sierra Negra in the south. In these areas, these traditions, and the agriculture they are dependent on, have survived because industrialization has not penetrated the rugged landscape.

The Sierra Norte, especially the municipalities of Cuetzalan, Pahuatlán, Huehuetlán el Grande and Teziutlán, are dominated by the Nahuas, Totonacas and Otomi. There is also a small region locally called the Sierra Negra in which there are communities of Popolocas, Nahuas and Mazatecos, especially in the municipality of Eloxochitlán, Tlacotepec and part of the city of Tehuacán.

The Mixtec people who live in the south of Puebla are part of an ethnic group which are still the dominant indigenous group in an area that stretches over Puebla, Oaxaca and the mountains of Guerrero. They are the fourth largest indigenous group in Mexico. The Sierra Mixteca region in Puebla is part of the Mixteca Baja region, which crosses into parts of Oaxaca as well. In the Mesoamerican period, the Mixtecs of Puebla dominated further north than they do now and archeologists classify &quot;Mixteca-Puebla&quot; art as distinct from other Mixtec arts and crafts. There are an estimated 6,700 Mixtecs living in Puebla, however, many have emigrated out of traditional Mixtec areas into other parts of the state, Mexico City and even the United States to work.

According to the 2020 Census, 1.73% of Puebla&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.

==Economy==

===General economy===

The state is divided into seven socioeconomic regions for planning purposes: Region I-Huauchinango, Region II – Teziutlán, Region III Ciudad Serdán, Region IV San Pedro Cholula, Region V – Puebla, Region VI Izúcar de Matamoros and Region VII Tehuacán.

The state was a diverse economic base supporting industries such as textiles, tourism, agribusiness, storage, medical services, furniture making and logistics services in clusters.(promotedor) In 2010, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s reconfirmed the state&#x27;s ‘mxA+’ rating with a stable outlook due to the state&#x27;s finances. The state&#x27;s economy grew at a rate of 4.5% from 2003 to 2007, above the national average of 3.9%. Since then, economic growth has slowed but less than in other parts of Mexico. Its gross domestic product accounts for 3.4% of the country&#x27;s total.

It is one of Mexico&#x27;s most industrialized states.

However, almost all of the state&#x27;s development has been centered on the capital city and the surrounding areas. This has caused a wide economic gap between rich and poor and between the city areas and the rural areas, with much of the state lacking investment by the government (infrastructure) or by private interests. This has led the United Nations to rank the state as the seventh most underdeveloped in the country, despite the industry in the Puebla City area in 2006–2007, with areas lacking basic services such as health, water and education along with high unemployment. The state is even ranked lower for these than Lebanon, Cuba and Bosnia. The UN blames poor government policies and corruption for much of the state&#x27;s poverty.

According to several NGO&#x27;s, such as the Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social (Coneval), and Marcos Gutiérrez Barrón, professor of economics at the Universidad Popular Autónoma del Estado de Puebla, Puebla has the third highest level of poverty in the country. This ranking takes into account factors such as income per capita, housing, educational opportunities, food supply and family cohesion. As much as two-thirds of the state&#x27;s population or about 3.5 million live under the poverty line. The state&#x27;s Secretaria de Desarrollo Social (Secretariat of Social Development) increased its budget in 2008 to 757 million pesos. Ten of the state&#x27;s municipalities are ranked among the poorest in the country.

Puebla is a state where migrant workers both head to and leave from. Most incoming workers are indigenous from the states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, according to a study done by the National Indigenous Institute and the United Nations. Most of these emigrants are Mixtecs from the south of the state, which head to areas such as Mexico City and the north of the country either seasonally or permanently. Many also head to the United States to work illegally. The migration situation has caused the population to drop in a number of areas in the state. The UN states that the main reason for emigration is the lack of local economic development especially in rural and indigenous areas.

===Agriculture and forestry===

Thirty seven percent of the population is employed in agriculture, livestock and fishing. Agricultural units cover 2,233,897 hectares in rural areas of the state. Just over fifty percent is dedicated to the growing of crops, 46.5% to pasture, 2.6% is forest and .8% is wild vegetation. Agriculture is the most important economic activity of the rural areas, but it is mostly limited to the rainy season from June to October, as there are few facilities for irrigation. This limits the sector&#x27;s growth potential significantly. Due to lack of investment only 11% of the state&#x27;s arable land is irrigated. Seventy two percent of farmland is privately own with the rest belonging to ejidos or other types of communal ownership. The municipalities with the most cultivated land are Chignahuapan, Chalchicomula de Sesma, Tlachichuca and Zacapoaxtla.

The most important activities include production of domestic fowl (eggs and meat), which accounts for 37%, cattle (dairy and meat) at 12%, grains (90% corn) and pork at 10% each, vegetables (tomatillos, onions, carrots, tomatoes, and squash) at 8% and fruit (oranges, limes, cactus pear, apples, avocados and peaches) at 4%. Other important crops include beans, animal feed, alfalfa and sugar cane. Most crops are grown in the municipalities of Hueytamalco, Francisco Z. Mena, Venustiano Carranza, Xicotepec and Jalpan. Most crops, especially corn, are grown on relatively small farms, communal fields and family plots, but perennial crops such as rubber trees, coffee and citrus from are mostly grown on large plantations. The most important livestock in the state are cattle, pigs and domestic fowl. Cattle are prevalent in the municipalities of Francisco Z. Mena, Venustiano Carranza, Jalpan, Hueytamalco and Chiautla de Tapia. Pigs are mostly found in Tehuacán, Ajalpan, Tepanco de López, Tecamachalco and Yehualtepec. The entire state ranks first in the production of domestic fowl with most being produced in the municipalities of Ajalpan, Tehuacán, Tecamachalco, Tepanco de López and Tochtepec. Other livestock raised include goats, sheep and horses.

Other production of primary materials includes forest products and fish. Over 93% of the tree species exploited in the state are conifers mostly cut for wood production. In 2007, the annual production of wood products had risen to . Most forestry occurs in the municipalities of Chignahuapan, Tetela de Ocampo, Vicente Guerrero, Zacatlán and Huauchinango. Fish are both caught wild and farmed and mostly concentrate on species such as carp, trout and mojarra. Most are harvested in the state&#x27;s dams and lakes, which cover a surface area of 6,500 hectares.

===Industry and mining===
The state has been an important industrial center since colonial times, mostly known for the production of textiles and pottery, both of which continue to be made. Today, industries of various types, along with mining and construction employ about twenty five percent of the state&#x27;s population. More than 150,000 small and medium-sized factories operate in the state, providing 60% of the state&#x27;s GDP. Most industry in the state in concentrated in and around the capital. The most important industries are in metals, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electronic items and textiles. Textiles produced in the state mostly involve thread, machinery, knitted items and woven fabrics. Moreover, the first and one of the biggest textile factory in Mexico and in Latinamerica, The &quot;La Constancia Mexicana Factory&quot;, was built in capital of Puebla. Two important employers are Hylsa and the Volkswagen plant, both in the Puebla area.

Two important industries are automotive and agribusiness. The automotive sector is important for the state as a leading manufacturer of both automobiles and automobile parts. Some of the businesses located in the state include Denso México, Arvin Meritor de México, Mabe, Leoni, Hyundai-Kia Motors, Coramex Company and Forteq. Industry related to agriculture consists of both producing products needed by farmers and processing agricultural produce. Some of these companies include Nestle de México, Pasan, Chocolatera Moctezuma, Sabormex, Big Cola, Bomba Energy, Ochoa Comercial, Grupo Pepsico, Compañía Topo Chico, Red Bull, Grupo Bimbo, Unifoods, Novamex, The Coca-Cola Company, Supermercados Gigante, Soriana, La Costeña and Jugos del Valle.

There are nine state and four federal programs targeting small and medium-sized producers, which provide training, consulting, trademarks and other services. Some programs target specific industries such as software. One focus of the state is to promote technology based industries which produced high-value products. There are eleven industrial parks and other special industry zones for this purpose. Another area identified for improvement is higher education, to produce graduates to work in these kinds of industries. Commercial events include the Exintex International Exhibition, which is held in the state each year and attracts textile manufacturers from states such as Morelos, Tlaxcala, Tamaulipas, Guanajuato, Querétaro and Aguascalientes as well as the cities of Guadalajara and Mexico City.

Mining produces calcite, marble, calcium oxide, onyx, and lime. The most important mining processing concerns are Calera Santa Ma. S.A, Marmiparquet S.A, Química Sumex S.A de C.V and Yacimientos de Travertino S.A., and the sector employs about 270,000 workers.

===Handicrafts===

Talavera pottery is the state&#x27;s best known craft. This pottery is a type of maiolica, which was introduced into Spain by the Arabs, and into Mexico by the Spanish. Talavera is considered to be the finest of Mexico&#x27;s pottery traditions, which is still made with the same techniques as in the colonial period. Talavera pottery began in the city of Puebla when the Spaniards brought over from Europe the techniques of making maiolica pottery, itself brought from China via the Arabs. The techniques and designs were based on the pottery made in Talavera, Spain. The high-quality clay and the formation of guilds to ensure quality soon made pottery made in Puebla a near-luxury item. The craft waned after Independence, but made a comeback in the latter 20th century. Today certified Talavera pottery in made only in a handful of workshops in the capital and other nearby communities. To be certified as genuine the same methods as used in the 16th century must be applied. True Talavera pottery is expensive and considered to be collectors’ items.

Other types of pottery in the state exist. One is the black clay figures made in Acatlán de Osorio. Most of these figures are animals and are almost always painted with white designs. Black clay is also used to make cups, plates and other utilitarian items in other communities. Another important clay craft are the Trees of Life, mostly made in the community of Izúcar de Matamoros and Acatlán de Osorio. Traditionally, these are sculptures depicting Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, but the craft has evolved to include other themes as well.

The making of textiles and embroidery dates back to pre-Hispanic times. Traditional clothing such as rebozos, sarapes, shirts and pants are still made in various parts of the state and reflect the different indigenous communities which are found here. Hueyapan is one of the better known artisanal textile producers, with clothing items and others richly and colorfully embroidered. Both the thread used to weave the cloth and embroider it are dyed with natural dyes such as those obtained from the cochineal insect. Another area known for its textiles is Zacapoaxtla in the north of the state.

The town of Amozoc is known for its silverwork. This tradition began when a number of metalworkers of various types settled here after the Conquest in the 16th century. These smiths made a variety of objects from the everyday such as knives, swords, stirrups and more, eventually branching into finer metals such as silver and gold, mother-of-pearl, ivory and more. However, it is silver smithing which has best survived to the present day.

There are two widely practice paper crafts in Puebla. The making of bark paper or amate was known in pre-Hispanic times when such was reserved for special ceremonies and the recording of important information. It had an almost magical quality to it and was used for spells, clothing of idols and other ceremonial purposes. Today, the paper is still made as an art form and often painted with elaborate designs. In Puebla, the paper is still made by hand and often it is hand-painted with pre-Hispanic designs. One area noted for this craft is San Salvador Huixcolotla. Another is San Pablito Pahuatlán in the Sierra Norte. One notable amate paper artist is curandero Alfonso García Téllez, who narrates stories and ceremonies in his works. Another paper craft is papel picado, or &quot;chopped paper.&quot; This craft began with the introduction of crepe paper from Asia. This paper is elaborately cut to form figures and scenes which are then hung for decorative purposes for holidays such as Day of the Dead. This most traditional of these are laborious cut by hand, but most are done today by machine. Those native to Puebla feature a large figure with a detailed background and are considered to be part of the state&#x27;s cultural heritage (Patrimonio Cultural del Estado de Puebla).

A relatively recent craft is the making of blown glass Christmas ornaments in Chignahuapan. This municipality has about 200 workshops which employ about 1,500 workers, which makes the spherical ornaments individually and many are shipped internationally to the United States and Latin America. This craft is still growing and represents one of the more stable small scale manufacturing endeavors in Puebla.

For many rural communities, the making of handcrafted furniture, both fine and rustic, is an important economic activity. One such community is Ciudad Serdán, which makes wooden utensils, decorative figures and banister work in addition to furniture. It has a strong reputation along with Chignahuapan. Areas outside of Ciudad Serdán are known for specializing in reproductions of Louis XV and Louis XVI furniture. The community of Trinidad Alonso Báez is known as the only place in Latin American where pianos are made purely by hand. They are also known for the repairing of musical instrument with many of the state&#x27;s antique church organs fixed by craftsmen from here.

Onyx is a plentiful stone in the state and it is worked into figures and other items in various parts of the state. The most important deposit of the stone is in Tecali and many workshops fill the streets of this town. Most of the pieces made are decorative in nature but small utilitarian items such as plates and ashtrays are also made.

Amozoc has been known for silver smithing since colonial times, when European techniques were brought over by the Spanish. As back then, they still make items such as jewelry, silverware, and items for church rituals. These smiths’ work is considered to be quality, with the finest pieces encrusted with precious and semi-precious gems, gold, and ivory.

The first glass workshop in New Spain was established in Puebla by Spaniard Rodrigo Espinoza in 1542. It remained the only one in Spain&#x27;s colonies for decades, exporting glass items to places such as Peru and Guatemala. In the 18th century, Pedro Antonio revitalized the craft with a new factory. This factory was the main producer until the establishment of the Compañia Empresarial para la Fabricacion del Vidrio Plano y Cristal in 1838. This company introduced French designs and techniques to Mexico. The next major glassmaker was Victor Martinez Filoteo, who established the Fabrica La Luz in 1935. This company is still the major producer of glass items in the state. Small workshops are prevalent in Huaquechula, where they specialize items made with black and smoke-colored glass.

===Commerce and transportation===
Thirty five percent are employed in commerce, tourism and transportation. The state has of highways and of rail line, as well as twenty three major malls. Outlet Puebla was opened in 2001 on the highway between Mexico City and the city of Puebla where it intersects with the Periferico Ecologico. It contains more than 80 outlet stores with major national and international brands such as Reebok, Guess and Pepe Jeans, located on a site of over 30,000m2. The enterprise is run by Asesores en Exposiciones y Calpro, S. A. de C. V. The mall targets traveling customers from the states of Puebla, Veracruz, Oaxaca and Tlaxcala as well as Mexico City.

The international airport in Huejotzingo is linked to the Mexico City airport by land transport. Efforts have been made to expand the airport in Huejotzingo to be an auxiliary to the overcrowded Mexico City airport. The airport has been chosen due to its relatively quiet airspace and proximity to the nation&#x27;s capital. , the airport handles sixty operations per day, 40 of which are commercial flights serving 2.5 million passengers per year.

===Tourism===

The state has 2,600 historic buildings, antiques, bars and pottery workshops. The downtown of the capital is filled with churches, government buildings and large homes, built by indigenous hands for their Spanish overlords. This downtown was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987.

Puebla is working with neighboring Veracruz to promote the area&#x27;s tourist attractions and develop them in an ecologically sustainable way. Both state governments are working with organizations of tour operators, hotels and restaurants to pool a fund for activities such as advertising campaigns, especially to Mexico City and the State of Mexico, which account for 80% of all the state&#x27;s visitors. Another is the reimbursement of tolls for those who travel to certain attractions such as the Africam Safari park and two-for-one specials. Efforts have succeeded in raising hotel occupancy rates from 40% to 56% in a number of areas.

==Archeological sites==
Cantona is a archeological site, located in the north of the state between the municipalities of Tepehualco and Coyoaco. It is divided into three units, with work only done on the south unit, which is the best preserved. Here is found the &quot;Acropolis,&quot; an area with temples, palaces and other seats of authority. The site was occupied between the 7th and 11th centuries CE and reached its height at the time many other Classic era urban centers were falling. It is thought that this city interrupted the flow of goods from the coast of Veracruz to Teotihuacan, one of the many causes of that city&#x27;s downfall. The site is filled with a large number of patios which measure 50 x 40 meters or larger. Total number of patios found is 620, and 997 mounds have been found as well. In some areas, remains of obsidian and sandstone workshops have been found.

Cholula was once a major Mesoamerican city with a multicultural population that was bound by a common religion based on the worship of Quetzalcoatl. The city was a pilgrimage site for the worship of this deity. Its architecture was complex and shows various foreign influences. Its height was reached during the Classic period between 100 and 900 CE along with Tula and Teotihuacan. It was regionally influential for much of the Mesoamerican period, and its polychromic pottery has been found in a large number of sites, indicating trade. By the time the Spanish arrived, it was still a very large city, second only to Tenochtitlan, to which it was subject. Today, the site is known for its Great Pyramid.

Tepexi el Viejo is located southeast of the city of Puebla. It was founded as the seat of one of the most important Popoloca dominions and control much of what is now the south of the state from 1200 to 1500 CE. This area&#x27;s light orange colored pottery has been found as far away as Teotihuacan. The site is naturally protected by mountains and canyons and is divided into five areas. Each has platforms, pyramidal mounds, residential areas and tombs. The most important pyramidal mound is located in the center of the site and other, smaller one is located to the extreme west. Residences are located in the northwest, many of which are L-shaped. There is only one natural opening to the area, which is in the south about outside the city&#x27;s walls.

Unlike other sites in the state, Yohualichan was dominated by coastal groups, which eventually abandoned it in the face of incursions from peoples from the central highlands. The site was a ceremonial center which was probably dominant over other similar sites. Containing niched pyramids as well, it is related to the El Tajín site in Veracruz. There is also a residential area, but it has not been studied.

Tepatlaxco is located on the south side of the Totlqueme mountain. It is centered on a ceremonial center which has more than eight structures, surrounded by numerous smaller mounds. Much of the site was constructed into the mountain itself, causing it to blend in. In addition to the mountain, there are two large ravines to give the site added protection. The most important structure is named Mound A, which also shows the longest occupation. It measures nine meters high and 36 meters at its base.

==Food==

Other foods common to the state include atole with chili pepper (chileatole), spicy mole verde, barbacoa, chilate with chopped onion, cemitas, cecina, guacamole with lime, and mole de caderas or mole espinazo. Many of these are found in the Sierra Mixteca region. However, the state is best known for cemitas, mole poblano, chiles en nogada and chalupas.

The cemita is a kind of sandwich on a roll, related to the torta, particularly popular in Mexico City and the pambazo, which is of French origin and popular in several areas in central Mexico. The sandwich has its origin with two kinds of bread which were brought over from Spain during the colonial period: one called &quot;bizcocho de sal&quot;, which was long and hard and a kind of hollow cracker. Both breads were developed for long storage and eventually were made in Puebla with grain from the Atlixco area. These two breads eventually fused into a unique type that became softer by the mid 19th century. The name is derived from a Jewish unleavened bread called &quot;semita&quot;, which was brought over by Sephardi Jews to New Spain. These were also produced in Puebla state. The cemitas were prepared at home and filled with potatoes, beans and nopal cactus and eaten by the lower classes. Later, an establishment in the Mercado Victoria market began to sell them to the public filled with meat from bull&#x27;s feet with a vinaigrette, herbs, onions and chili peppers. This new filling was a hit and eventually this and other variations became a staple in many markets and popular eateries. Today, a large number varieties exist but all are prepared using the same type of bread.
The best-known mole is named after the city of Puebla, mole poblano. The origin of this sauce is disputed and there are two versions of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had just found out that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop was very pleased with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.

The other story states that the sauce is of pre-Hispanic times and this was served to Hernán Cortés and the other conquistadors by Moctezuma II. The Aztecs did have a preparation called &quot;chilmulli&quot;, which in Nahuatl means &quot;chili pepper sauce&quot;. However, there is no evidence that chocolate was ever used to flavor prepared foods or used in chilmulli. What has happened is that the sauce gained ingredients as it was reinterpreted over the colonial period.

Many food writers and gourmets nowadays consider one particular dish, the famous turkey in mole poblano, which contains chocolate, to represent the pinnacle of the Mexican cooking tradition.

According to the legend of chiles en nogada, there were three sisters from the city of Puebla who were in Mexico City. When the Army of the Three Guarantees entered the capital at the end of the Mexican War of Independence, they were feted by many. At one of these parties, the three sisters fell in love with three of the army&#x27;s officers. Soon after, Agustín de Iturbide himself was set to visit the city of Puebla. Remembering the sisters, the soon-to-be emperor wanted to visit them. Wanting to impress Iturbide but not knowing how to cook, the sisters turned to the nuns of the Santa Monica convent who were famous for their food. The nuns decided to invent a dish for the sisters, which would represent the three colors of the new Mexican flag. On the appointed day, the banquet was prepared with the dish now called chiles en nogada, which pleased Iturbide. The dish contains poblano chile, walnuts, cream and pomegranate seeds, and offered seasonally (August–September) in local restaurants.

Chalupas are thick corn tortillas fried in lard then covered in red or green chili pepper sauce and topped with shredded meat and other things. According to legend, they were named after the barges that the Aztecs used to travel in areas such as Tenochtitlan (today Mexico City). Chalupas are popular in other areas of central Mexico but are considered a specialty of Puebla, where they are served from humble street carts to upscale restaurants.

==Myths and legends==

The legend of the founding of the city of Puebla attributes to the act of the vision of a friar Julián Garcés, who became the first bishop of Puebla. The legend states that while praying, the friar fell asleep, when he dreamed of a festival in honor the Archangel Michael happening in a place with leafy trees and a crystal clear river, flowing from springs. As they contemplated the scenery, angels descended from heaven and traced the outlines of the city to be built. When he awoke, he drew what he had seen, deciding he had had a divine vision. He communicated the dream to other Franciscans and found the place he saw five days later.

The story of the China Poblana is one of the most popular in the state. The girl was taken on the Manila Galleon, but she was sold to Puebla resident Miguel de Sosa for a price ten times what the viceroy offered. She was taken to the city and baptized with the name of Catarina de San Juan in 1620. She maintained her oriental dress which made her conspicuous and it became a fad to imitate some aspects of this dress.

When de Sosa and his wife died, Catherine entered a convent and began to see visions of the Virgin Mary and the Child Jesus. Some say that a number of miracles occurred while Catherine lived at the convent and this provoked a kind of veneration of her. When the China Poblana died in 1882, veneration of her as a saint began in earnest, but the practice was put to an end by the Mexican Inquisition. Today her remains are in a crypt in the Temple de La Compañia in the city of Puebla.

The Aztec myth of Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl, a Romeo and Juliet type story, has equal significance in this state as it does in the Valley of Mexico as the two are equally visible from the city of Puebla, but only in reverse (with Popocatépetl on the left).

There is a popular saying &quot;todo terminó como el Rosario de Amozoc, a golpes y farolazos&quot; (it all ended like the Amozoc Rosary, with blows and drinks). The saying is derived from a legend from the community of Amozoc de Mota in the state. A silversmith apprentice by the name of Alberto was in love with a beautiful girl named Catalina, nicknamed La Culata. However, another apprentice from another shop named Enrique, was also in love with her. Alberto was accepted by la Culata and this made Enrique jealous. Festivities for the beginning of the year were supposed to be organized by the different silver workshops together but the rivalry caused a split in which ecclesiastical authorities needed to intervene. On the first day of the event, at Mass, Enrique saw Alberto and Catherine kiss briefly, which enraged him. During the rosary, while the choir sang &quot;Mater Inmaculata,&quot; Enrique heard &quot;mata a la Culata&quot; (kill La Culata), took a knife from his clothing and attacked the couple, killing Catarina. Alberto took a machete from his belt and killed Enrique. A fight ensued which left many dead and wounded. It is said that one can still hear the cries of Catalina as she died.

The house at Avenida 3 Ote 201 in the city of Puebla belonged to Pedro de Carvajal, who was a wealthy and respected man. However, he lost his young wife as she gave birth to their second child, a boy. When his daughter turned 15, there were many interested suitors but she was not interested in them. One day a monster appeared at a party in the city provoking terror. The monster went to the Carvajal house and ate the younger son, who was playing out front of the house. Pedro offered a large reward for the capture of the beast. One young man, who wanted the hand of Pedro&#x27;s daughter, appeared at another festival, bearing the head of the beast. It is said that this young man gained noble title and the hand of the daughter as a reward.

==Culture==

===The two volcanos===
The state of Puebla is located on the east side of the volcanoes of Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl, opposite of the Valley of Mexico and Mexico City. The two volcanoes have as much significance here as they do on the west side, with many communities nearby maintaining ritual specific to honoring the two. These arose as fertility rituals but today are called &quot;birthdays&quot; with 12 March reserved for Popocatepetl and 30 August for Iztaccíhuatl. On these events, special foods and gifts are prepared as offerings and left in certain places. These traditions have survived despite the evangelization efforts of the colonial period.

===Festivals and holiday===
The state is home to a number of festivals and traditions, from those with a purely pre-Hispanic background, to the far more numerous saints’ days to modern fairs located to regional economies. The largest important events include the Day of the Dead in Huaquechula, the Carnival of Huijotzingo, Spring Equinox in Cantona, Fiesta de Santo Entierro y Feria de las Flores, the Fería del Café y el Huipil, the Huey Atlixcáyotl Festival, the Quetzalcoatl Ritual and Cinco de Mayo, celebrated in the entire state.

Cinco de Mayo—or the fifth of May—is a holiday that celebrates the date of the Mexican army&#x27;s 1862 victory over France at the Battle of Puebla during the Franco-Mexican War (1861-1867). A relatively minor holiday in Mexico, in the United States Cinco de Mayo has evolved into a commemoration of Mexican culture and heritage, particularly in areas with large Mexican-American populations.
Many Americans mistakenly believe that Cinco de Mayo (&quot;May 5th&quot;) is the Mexican equivalent of the United States’ Fourth of July holiday — a date marking the official casting off of colonial rule via the announcement of a new independent country. However, the Mexican version of Independence Day is celebrated on September 16, for it was on that date in 1810 that the commencement of the war for Mexican independence from Spanish rule was pronounced in the small town of Dolores by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla (an event now referred to as the &quot;Grito de Dolores&quot; — &quot;Cry of Dolores&quot; — or &quot;El Grito de la Independencia&quot;).

Cinco de Mayo is an important celebration in a number of places the United States, but it is a minor holiday or even unknown in much of Mexico proper. The only place where the holiday, which commemorates the Battle of Puebla during the French Intervention in Mexico, is important is in the state of Puebla. The French army invaded the country in 1862 and marched from Veracruz towards the city of Puebla. Just outside the city, inexperienced Mexican troops attacked the French who were camped. This resulted in victory, but the French were ultimately able to move on and take Mexico City, dominating the country until 1867. The annual celebration of the battle began in the state in areas of the country not occupied by the French as a symbol of Mexican pride. Today it is the most important state political commemoration. The most important observances take place at the Loreto and Guadalupe forts in the city of Puebla, where the battle occurred in 1862. The highlight is a reenactment of the event at the site.
Like the rest of Mexico, Day of the Dead is celebrated in the state. Two aspects which feature prominently on altars in this state are mole with turkey and large wax candles. Other items can include black candelabras, incense burners, candy skulls, decorative paper cutouts, oranges and other fruits in season. Leading to these altars often are a line of small candles to guide the returning spirits. One municipality which is particularly known for its events is Huaquechula. Here, altars constructed in homes can be of multiple levels and are usually covered in white paper. On the first level, food and drink are usually placed, with religious objects and objects related to the deceased on the second level.

In a number of communities in the state, Carnival is celebrated. The best known of these carnivals takes place in Huejotzingo, as it began as a synthesis of a celebration honoring Tlaloc and the Catholic tradition related to the days before Ash Wednesday. Today, this carnival includes many traditional activities such as music, masks and parades, but this one also includes a reenactment of the Battle of Puebla and local legends such as the kidnapping of a governor&#x27;s daughter and the legend of Agustìn Lorenzo (called the Robin Hood of the 18th century). Locals attend in colorful costumes and masks representing the Conquistadors, demons or animals, adorned with palm fronds or feathers. The capital of Puebla also celebrates Carnival with its signature tradition of the Las Marias, where men disguise themselves as women and mischievous devils.

Another major time for religious observance is Holy Week or Semana Santa. In Puebla, there is the Procession del Silencio or Procession of Silence which occurs on Maundy Thursday, when the city observes a period of silence to mark the death of Jesus.

The spring equinox is the setting for rituals at some of Puebla&#x27;s archeological sites such as Cantona and Cholula. Cantona is an archeological site located near the city of Puebla and was one of the largest cities in early Mesoamerica. Today, the site is popular gathering place on the spring equinox (much like Teotihuacan), where people sing, dance and greet the sunrise on this date. Another site where similar observances are held is the Great Pyramid of Cholula. Here indigenous dances and rituals are performed. The event culminates with the Ritual of Quetzalcoatl, which was an important part of the ancient Cholula culture. This event draws attendees from various parts of Mexico.

The is celebrated in the town of Atlixco to celebrate the area&#x27;s local culture and identity. The name means &quot;Atlixco tradition&quot; in Nahuatl and is centered on the San Miguel Hill (called Popocatica in ancient times) located in the center of the town. It was locally sacred in the pre-Hispanic era, and in colonial times, a hermitage was built there. The event was named a Cultural Heritage of the State of Puebla in 1996. The purpose of the event is to celebrate the survival of indigenous culture after the Conquest.

In July, the Pueblo Mágico of Cuetzalan has the cultural festival of Festival Tradicional, which features traditional dancers who come from various parts of the state. Tetela de Ocampo celebrates its Peach Festival in August. On the last day of August, the Procession de los Faroles (Procession of the Lanterns) takes place in Cholula.

Puebla has a number of annual fairs meant to highlights the various regions’ products. In Huauchinango, an economic fair and a religious observance are conducted at the same time. The Feria de las Flores (Flower Festival) and the Santo Entierro (Holy Burial) occur in the second half of March. It consists of religious events such as processions and masses. Many cut flower and ornamental plant growers come to display their products and there is the coronation of the Queen of Flowers. Other events include agricultural displays, parades with floats, dances, crafts, cockfights, sporting events and more.

The Feria del Café y el Huipil (Coffee and Huipil Festival) takes place in Cuetzalan. The event promotes the area&#x27;s locally grown coffee as well as traditionally made huipil dresses. There are also displays of pre-Hispanic dance, popular music, fireworks and more. The event began in 1949 as the National Festival of Coffee, which is economically important here. The event centered on the choosing of a Coffee Queen, much like other similar kinds of festivals. In 1962, the National Festival of the Huipil was established. Eventually, the two merged to the current event.

Other events to promote Puebla&#x27;s products include the Feria de Café in Xicotpec in March and the Feria Nacional de Puebla. The latter is held in the state capital and brings together many of the state&#x27;s agricultural, livestock, craft and industrial producers in an event very analogous to a state fair. The regional fair called the Piloto de Cholula occurs in September.

===China Poblana===

The China Poblana was a real person who lived during the colonial period. Her real name was Mirra. She was an Indian who was brought over from Manila in the 1620s on the Manila Galleon as a child to work as a slave for the viceroy Marques de Gélves. She was soon sold to ship captain Miguel de Sosa who lived in Puebla. According to legend, Mirra was originally a princess in her home country but her family was displaced by the Portuguese and she was kidnapped by pirates who sold her. Mirra was considered to be beautiful and exotic. She had been converted to the Catholic faith. Later in her life, she began to have visions of the child Jesus and angels. Her fame grew and she was eventually considered to be something of a prophet. When she died in 1688, people began to venerate her as a saint and many women copied her Asian/Mexican inspired dress.

This fashion led to the now-traditional &quot;china poblana&quot; dress. It consists of a red skirt heavily decorated with colored sequins that in one part form the image of the eagle found on the Mexican flag and a blouse embroidered with colored thread and beads around the bust area. It is often worn with a charro-type hat. The outfit is the amalgam of several cultures such as Spanish, especially in the skirt; Chinese, with its use of sequins and beads; and indigenous, with colorful embroidery.

===Dance===
Folk dance of both indigenous and mixed European and indigenous origin are most often seen at religious and cultural events in many parts of the state. Some of the most popular dances include &quot;Moors and Christians,&quot; Dance of the Santiagos&quot; and &quot;Danza de los Arcos.&quot; The last is usually performed only by men who dress in white and with a scarf-like garment across the chest, dance in pairs which carry large arch portals covered in flowers and paper decorations. The dance has a number of variations which can include leaps into the air and complicated twirls.

The Dances of the Quetzales is most popular in the Sierra Norte, especially in Cuetzalan. It is a highly symbolic dance and usually performed in conjunction with rituals that relate to good harvests. The dancers form crosses, which signify the four cardinal directions and move in circles, which symbolize the rotation of time. The dancers wear large circular headdresses of quetzal feathers, which give the dance its name, and red suits. The Dance of the Voladores, which more common in Papantla, Veracruz, is also performed in a number of communities in the north of Puebla. This consists of five men who climb a tall pole and then four fall and spin from the pole while attached by ropes. The fifth dancer stays on top and plays music and dances as the other men fall. Another important dance in Puebla is the Doce pares de Francia, which recalls the events of the Battle of Puebla.

===Architecture===

The colonial architecture of the state is defined by its heavy use of ornamental tiles called Talavera. This is particularly true in the capital. This makes these buildings more colorful than most of their contemporaries in other parts of Mexico and was one of the reasons that the historic center of the capital was selected as a World Heritage Site.

A number of churches and other buildings in rural parts of the state are noted for their &quot;folk baroque&quot; architecture and decoration, especially in Atlixco and the southwest. Folk baroque consists of the use of tile and painted raised stucco based on more traditional Baroque designs, which was most popular in the 18th century. One well known church of this type is the church of Jolapan, which is modeled after the Tepalcingo Sanctuary in neighboring Morelos. The church of Jolalpan contains richly decorated pilasters, Solomonic columns and other elements in a design very similar to that of Tepalcingo. Between these there are a number of small churches which also show folk baroque influence such as those in Tlancualpican and Tzicatlán. The church in Tlancualpican is painted in bright blues, greens and red, with an ornate façade with sculpted leaves, tendrils and niches divided by spiral half-columns all done in stucco. Even more ornate is the church in Tzicatlán, which is a small rural farming village, with the entire surface of the main façade decorated with brightly colored images and sculptures.

In the modern era, architectural styles have evolved into new and sometimes eclectic forms. Skyscrapers, almost all of which are in the city of Puebla, include Edificio Vacas at 42 meters high, Torre Géminis at 50 meters high, Torre Nora at 69 meters high to the tallest, Torre Ejecutiva JVI and Torre Ejecutiva JVI at 100 meters high each. These last two have a triangular shape and are covered in blue tinged glass.

===Literature===
Literature is one of the better-developed arts in the state and includes works such as novels, essays, poetry and theatrical plays. One prominent name from the colonial period is that of José Mariano Beristáin de Souza who was a priest and writers in the 18th century. He is also known for amassing a large library of writings in Spanish over twenty years of his life, which resulted in the Biblioteca Hispanoamericana Septentrional. However, literature would not be a major cultural force in the state until the 20th century. One early prominent writer was poet Gregorio de Gante. In his early career, he was a professor but after the Mexican Revolution broke out the joined revolutionary forces under Antonio Medina. After the war, he began his career as a poet, eventually writing regularly for a newspaper called &quot;El Nacional&quot; and become one of Mexico&#x27;s most popular writers by the 1930s.

Many modern works with themes of social injustice and sometimes about the culture and scenery of the state itself. Modern Puebla literature can be traced back to the work of poet Arturo Trejo, one of the &quot;Generacion de los 50&quot; or Generation of the 1950s.

Elena Garro was active during the mid and latter 20th century, whose writings were said to &quot;grab&quot; the reader. Most of her work was autobiographical in one sense or another. She was married to another Mexican writer Octavio Paz, from whom she divorced in 1959.

Born in Atlixco in 1930, Hector Azar is one of Mexico&#x27;s most noted playwrights in the 20th century. Some of his works include Revista de Revistas, Revista de la Universidad and Jueves de Excelsior. He has also directed and produced plays in Mexico and Europe.

Sergio Pitol Demeneghi is a writer, translator and diplomat who was born in the city of Puebla in 1933. Most of his works relate to the theme of human rights. Much of his writing and translating work relates to his diplomatic functions. His best known works include No hay tal lugar, Infierno de todos and Los climas.
Born in Puebla in 1949, Ángeles Mastretta&#x27;s writings are known for their female characters which are prominent. She has found most of her popularity in Spain and Mexico publishing stories in magazines such as Ovaciones and La Jornada. Her books include El Mundo Ilumninado, Arrancame la vida and Mujeres de ojos grandes.

<text>The early history of Uganda comprises the history of Uganda before the territory that is today Uganda was made into a British protectorate at the end of the 19th century. Prior to this, the region was divided between several closely related kingdoms.

==Earliest history==
Paleolithic evidence of human activity in Uganda goes back to at least 50,000 years, and perhaps as far as 100,000 years, as shown by the Acheulean stone tools recovered from the former environs of Lake Victoria, which were exposed along the Kagera River valley, chiefly around Nsonezi. Rock art in Uganda, particularly in the eastern part of the country, attests to occupation during the Later Stone Age as well.

Uganda&#x27;s position along the central African Rift Valley, its favourable climate at an altitude of 1,200 meters and above, and reliable rainfall around the Lake Victoria Basin made it attractive to African cultivators and herders as early as the fourth century BCE. Core samples from the bottom of Lake Victoria have revealed that dense rainforest once covered the land around the lake. Centuries of cultivation removed almost all the original tree cover.

Central Sudanic peoples and Kuliak speakers were likely the first farmers and herders in Uganda. Central Sudanic peoples first entered Northern Uganda by at least 4,000 BCE and sometime later spread as far south as the Kigezi sub-region in southwestern Uganda by 3,000 BCE. The Ancient Kuliak presence in uganda can be seen in Kansyore Pottery and ancient Pollen samples.

=== Bantu expansion ===
Bantu speaking farmers first arrived in far-southern Uganda in the year 1000BC. They also raised goats and chickens, and they probably kept some cattle by 400 BCE. Their knowledge of agriculture and use of iron-forging technology permitted them to clear the land and feed ever larger numbers of settlers. They displaced small bands of indigenous hunter-gatherers, who relocated to the less accessible mountains.

Meanwhile, by the fourth century BCE, the Bantu-speaking metallurgists were perfecting iron smelting to produce medium grade carbon steel in pre-heated forced-draft furnaces. Although most of these developments were taking place southwest of modern Ugandan boundaries, iron was mined and smelted in many parts of the country not long afterward.

==Early political systems==
As the Bantu-speaking agriculturists of the Uganda area spread and multiplied over the centuries, they evolved a form of government by clan chiefs. This kinship-organized system was useful for coordinating work projects, settling internal disputes, and carrying out religious observances to clan deities, but it could effectively govern only a limited number of people. Larger polities began to form states towards the end of the first millennium CE, some of which would ultimately govern over a million subjects each. More extensive and improved cultivation of Bananas (high-yield crops that allowed for permanent cultivation and settlements) by Bantu groups between 300 and 1200 CE helped this process.

Nilotic speaking pastoralists who lived in the more arid and less fertile North were mobile and ready to resort to arms in defence of their cattle or in raids to appropriate the cattle of others. But their political organization was less, based on kinship and decisions by kin-group elders. In the meeting of cultures, they may have acquired the ideas and symbols of political chiefship from the Bantu speakers, to whom they could offer military protection, and with whose elites they sometimes joined and intermarried. It is theorized a system of patron-client relationships developed, whereby a pastoral elite emerged, entrusting the care of cattle to subjects who used the manure to improve the fertility of their increasingly overworked gardens and fields.

In some regions, pastoral elites were of partly Nilotic descent, while in others they may have derived mainly from the Bantu population (so theorized by the linguist David L. Schoenbrun from certain of those relatives of wealthy banana cultivators who were not eligible for inheritance). The latter had gradually adopted specialist pastoralism as a source of wealth in the area&#x27;s rich grasslands. The earliest states may have been established in the 15th century by a group of pastoral rulers called the Chwezi. Legends depicted the Chwezi as supernatural beings, but their material remains at the archaeological sites of Bigo and Mubende have shown that they were human and perhaps among the ancestors of the modern Hima and Tutsi pastoralists of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi. During the 15th century, the Chwezi were displaced by a new Nilotic-speaking pastoral group called the Bito. The Chwezi appear to have moved south of present-day Uganda to establish kingdoms in northwest Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi.

From this process of cultural contact and state formation, three different types of states emerged. The Hima type was later to be seen in Rwanda and Burundi. It preserved a caste system whereby the rulers and their pastoral relatives attempted to maintain strict separation from the agricultural subjects, called Hutu. The Hima rulers lost their Nilotic language and became Bantu speakers, but they preserved an ideology of superiority in political and social life and attempted to monopolise high status and wealth. In the 20th century, the Hutu revolt after independence led to the expulsion from Rwanda of the Hima elite, who became refugees in Uganda. A counter-revolution in Burundi secured power for the Hima through periodic massacres of the Hutu majority.

The Bito type of state, in contrast with that of the Hima, was established in Bunyoro, which for several centuries was the dominant political power in the region. Bito immigrants displaced the influential Hima and secured power for themselves as a royal clan, ruling over Hima pastoralists and Hutu agriculturalists alike. No rigid caste lines divided Bito society. The weakness of the Bito ideology was that, in theory, it granted every Bito clan member royal status and with it the eligibility to rule. Although some of these ambitions might be fulfilled by the Bunyoro &quot;omukama&quot; (ruler) granting his kin offices as governors of districts, there was always the danger of a coup d&#x27;état or secession by overambitious relatives. Thus, in Bunyoro, periods of political stability and expansion were interrupted by civil wars and secessions.

=== Buganda ===

The third type of state to emerge in Uganda was that of Buganda, on the northern shores of Lake Victoria. This area of swamp and hillside was not attractive to the rulers of pastoral states farther north and west. There, as in the nearby Haya kingdom of west Tanzania, the wealth of the ruling class continued to depend more on banana lands and groves than cattle, and no sharp caste-like distinction between farmers and herders formed. Buganda became a refuge area, however, for those who wished to escape rule by Bunyoro or for factions within Bunyoro who were defeated in contests for power.

One such group from Bunyoro, headed by Prince Kimera, arrived in Buganda early in the 15th century. Assimilation of refugee elements had already strained the ruling abilities of Buganda&#x27;s various clan chiefs and a supraclan political organization was already emerging. Kimera seized the initiative in this trend and became the first effective &quot;Kabaka&quot; (ruler) of the fledgling Buganda state. Ganda oral traditions later sought to disguise this intrusion from Bunyoro by claiming earlier, shadowy, quasisupernatural kabakas.

Unlike the Hima caste system or the Bunyoro royal clan political monopoly, Buganda&#x27;s kingship was made a kind of state lottery in which all clans could participate. Each new king was identified with the clan of his mother, rather than that of his father. All clans readily provided wives to the ruling kabaka, who had eligible sons by most of them. When the ruler died, his successor was chosen by clan elders from among the eligible princes, each of whom belonged to the clan of his mother. In this way, the throne was never the property of a single clan for more than one reign. Bunyoro&#x27;s power began to ebb in the 18th century, with the separation of the Toro kingdom and more importantly the rise of Buganda.

Consolidating their efforts behind a centralised kingship, the Baganda (people of Buganda) shifted away from defensive strategies and toward expansion. By the mid-19th century, Buganda had doubled and redoubled its territory, conquering much of Bunyoro and becoming the dominant state in the region. Newly conquered lands were placed under chiefs nominated by the king. Buganda&#x27;s armies and the royal tax collectors traveled swiftly to all parts of the kingdom along specially constructed roads which crossed streams and swamps by bridges and viaducts. On Lake Victoria (which the Baganda called Nnalubaale), a royal navy of outrigger canoes, commanded by an admiral who was chief of the Lungfish clan, could transport Baganda commandos to raid any shore of the lake. The journalist Henry Morton Stanley visited Buganda in 1875 and provided an estimate of Buganda troop strength. Stanley counted 125,000 troops marching off on a single campaign to the east, where a fleet of 230 war canoes waited to act as auxiliary naval support.

In Buganda&#x27;s capital, Lubaga, Stanley found a well-ordered town of about 40,000 surrounding the king&#x27;s palace, which was situated atop a commanding hill. A wall more than four kilometers in circumference surrounded the palace compound, which was filled with grass-roofed houses, meeting halls, and storage buildings. At the entrance to the court burned the royal fire, which would only be extinguished when the Kabaka died. Thronging the grounds were foreign ambassadors seeking audiences, chiefs going to the royal advisory council, messengers running errands, and a corps of young pages, who served the Kabaka while training to become future chiefs. For communication across the kingdom, the messengers were supplemented by drum signals.

Most communities in Uganda, however, were not organized on such a vast political scale. To the north, the Nilotic-speaking Acholi people adopted some of the ideas and regalia of kingship from Bunyoro in the 18th century. &quot;Rwots&quot; (chiefs) acquired royal drums, collected tribute from followers, and redistributed it to those who were most loyal. The mobilisation of larger numbers of subjects permitted successful hunts for meat. Extensive areas of bushland were surrounded by beaters, who forced the game to a central killing point in a hunting technique that was still practised in areas of central Africa as of 1990. But these Acholi chieftaincies remained relatively small in size, and within them the power of the clans remained strong enough to challenge that of the rwot.

==Long-distance trade and foreign contact (1800s–)==
Until the middle of the 19th century, Uganda remained relatively isolated from the outside world. The central African lake region was a world in miniature, with an internal trade system, a great power rivalry between Buganda and Bunyoro, and its own inland seas. When intrusion from the outside world finally came, it was in the form of long-distance trade for ivory.

Ivory had been a staple trade item from the coast of East Africa since before the Christian era. But growing world demand in the 19th century, together with the provision of increasingly efficient firearms to hunters, created a moving &quot;ivory frontier&quot; as elephant herds near the coast were nearly exterminated. Leading large caravans financed by Indian moneylenders, Arab traders based in Zanzibar reached Lake Victoria by 1844. One trader, Ahmad bin Ibrahim, introduced Buganda&#x27;s kabaka to the advantages of foreign trade: the acquisition of imported cloth and, more important, guns and gunpowder. Ibrahim also introduced the religion of Islam, but the kabaka was more interested in guns.

By the 1860s, Buganda was the destination of ever more caravans, and the kabaka and his chiefs began to dress in cloth called &quot;mericani&quot; (derived from &quot;American&quot;), which was woven in Massachusetts and carried to Zanzibar by American traders. It was judged finer in quality than European or Indian cloth, and increasing numbers of ivory tusks were collected to pay for it. Bunyoro sought to attract foreign trade as well, in an effort to keep up with Buganda in the burgeoning arms race.

Bunyoro also found itself threatened from the north by Egyptian-sponsored agents who sought ivory and slaves but who, unlike the Arab traders from Zanzibar, were also promoting foreign conquest. In 1869, Khedive Ismail Pasha of Egypt, seeking to annex the territories north of the borders of Lake Victoria and east of Lake Albert and &quot;south of Gondokoro,&quot; sent a British explorer, Samuel Baker, on a military expedition to the frontiers of Bunyoro, with the object of suppressing the slave-trade there and opening the way to commerce and civilisation. The khedive appointed Baker Governor-General of the new territory named Equatoria.

The Banyoro resisted Baker, and he had to fight a desperate battle to secure his retreat. Baker regarded the resistance as an act of treachery, and he denounced the Banyoro in a book (&quot;Ismailia – A Narrative Of The Expedition To Central Africa For The Suppression Of Slave Trade, Organised By Ismail, Khadive Of Egypt&quot; (1874)) that was widely read in Britain. Later British Empire builders arrived in Uganda with a predisposition against Bunyoro, which eventually would cost the kingdom half its territory until the &quot;lost counties&quot; were restored to Bunyoro after independence.

Farther north the Acholi responded more favourably to the Egyptian demand for ivory. They were already famous hunters and quickly acquired guns in return for tusks. The guns permitted the Acholi to retain their independence but altered the balance of power within Acholi territory, which for the first time experienced unequal distribution of wealth based on control of firearms.

Meanwhile, Buganda was receiving not only traded goods and guns but a stream of foreign visitors as well. The explorer John Hanning Speke passed through Buganda in 1862 and claimed he had discovered the source of the Nile. Both Speke and Stanley (based on his 1875 stay in Uganda) wrote books that praised the Baganda for their organisational skills and willingness to modernise. Stanley went further and attempted to convert the king to Christianity. Finding Kabaka Mutesa I apparently receptive, Stanley wrote to the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in London and persuaded it to send missionaries to Buganda in 1877.

Two years after the CMS established a mission, French Catholic White Fathers also arrived at the king&#x27;s court, and the stage was set for a fierce religious and nationalist rivalry in which Zanzibar-based Muslim traders also participated. By the mid-1880s, all three parties had been successful in converting substantial numbers of Baganda, some of whom attained important positions at court. When a new young kabaka, Mwanga, attempted to halt the foreign ideologies that he saw threatening the state, he was deposed by the armed converts in 1888. A four-year civil war ensued in which the Muslims were initially successful and proclaimed an Islamic state. They were soon defeated, however, and were not able to renew their effort.

The region was greatly weakened by a series of epidemics that hit the region due to its increased exposure to the outside world. The first of these was the rinderpest outbreak of 1891 that devastated the region&#x27;s cattle. This was followed by outbreaks of sleeping sickness and smallpox that would halve the population of some areas.

The victorious Protestant and Catholic converts then divided the Buganda kingdom, which they ruled through a figurehead kabaka dependent on their guns and goodwill. Thus, outside religion had disrupted and transformed the traditional state. Soon afterwards, the arrival of competing European imperialists — the German Karl Peters and the British captain Frederick Lugard broke the Christian alliance; the British Protestant missionaries urged acceptance of the British flag, while the French Catholic mission either supported the Germans (in the absence of French imperialists) or called for Buganda to retain its independence.

In January 1892, fighting broke out between the Protestant and Catholic Baganda converts. The Catholics quickly gained the upper hand, until Lugard intervened with a prototype machine gun, the Maxim (named after its American inventor, Hiram Maxim). The Maxim decided the issue in favour of the pro-British Protestants; the French Catholic mission was burned to the ground, and the French bishop fled. The resultant scandal was settled in Europe when the British government paid compensation to the French mission and agreed with the Germans who gave up Peters&#x27; claim to Uganda in the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890.

With Buganda secured by Lugard, and the Germans no longer contending for control, the British began to enlarge their claim to the &quot;headwaters of the Nile&quot; as they called the land north of Lake Victoria. Allying with the Protestant Baganda chiefs, the British set about conquering the rest of the country, aided by Nubian mercenary troops who had formerly served the khedive of Egypt. Bunyoro had been spared the religious civil wars of Buganda and was firmly united by its king, Kabarega, who had several regiments of troops armed with guns.

After five years of bloody conflict, the British occupied Bunyoro and conquered Acholi and the northern region, and the rough outlines of the Uganda Protectorate came into being. Other African polities, such as the Ankole kingdom to the southwest, signed treaties with the British, as did the chiefdoms of Busoga, but the kinship-based peoples of eastern and northeastern Uganda had to be overcome by military force.

A mutiny by Nubian mercenary troops in 1897 was only barely suppressed after two years of fighting, during which Baganda Christian allies of the British once again demonstrated their support for the colonial power. As a reward for this support, and in recognition of Buganda&#x27;s formidable military presence, the British negotiated a separate treaty with Buganda, granting it a large measure of autonomy and self-government within the larger protectorate under indirect rule. One-half of Bunyoro&#x27;s conquered territory was awarded to Buganda as well, including the historic heartland of the kingdom containing several Nyoro (Bunyoro) royal tombs. Buganda doubled in size from ten to twenty counties (), but the &quot;lost counties&quot; of Bunyoro remained a continuing grievance that would return to haunt Buganda in the 1960s.

<text>The Russian mafia ( or ), also known as bratva ( ; ), is a collective of various organized crime related elements originating in the former Soviet Union (FSU). Any of the mafia&#x27;s groups may be referred to as an &quot;Organized Criminal Group&quot; (OPG, from Russian ). This is sometimes modified to include a specific name, such as the Orekhovskaya OPG. Sometimes, the Russian word is dropped in favour of a full translation, and OCG is used instead of OPG.

In 2012, there were as many as 6,000 groups, with more than 200 of them having a global reach. Criminals of these various groups are either former prison members, corrupt officials and business leaders, people with ethnic ties, or people from the same region with shared criminal experiences and leaders. In December 2009, Timur Lakhonin, the head of the National Central Bureau of Interpol within Russia, stated that &quot;Certainly, there is crime involving our former compatriots abroad, but there is no data suggesting that an organized structure of criminal groups comprising former Russians exists abroad&quot; on the topic of international Russian criminal gangs. In August 2010, Alain Bauer, a criminologist from France, said that the Russian mafia &quot;is one of the best structured criminal organizations in Europe, with a quasi-military operation&quot; in their international activities.

The Russian mafia is similar to the Italian crime groups in many ways, in that the groups&#x27; organizations and structures follow a similar model. The two groups also share a similar portfolio of criminal activity. The highly publicized Sicilian Mafia is believed to have inspired early criminal groups in Russia to form mafia-like organizations, eventually spawning their own version. The Russian mafia, however, differed from the Sicilians due to their environment. The level of political corruption and arms sales in post-Soviet Russia allowed for their massive expansion, as well as the incorporation of many government officials into the crime syndicates. Russian mafia groups have also been involved in uranium trading, stolen from the Soviet nuclear program, and human trafficking, among other serious activities.

==History==

===Origins===
Today&#x27;s Russian organized crime can be traced back to the Russian Empire, in the form of banditry and thievery, but it was not until after the establishment of the Soviet Union that certain () emerged as the leaders of prison groups throughout forced labour camps with a generally well-defined code of honour. In the aftermath of World War II in 1945, the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, more gangs emerged in a flourishing black market that exploited the unstable governments of the FSU. American attorney Louis Freeh, who headed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) between 1993 and 2001, said that the Russian mafia posed the greatest threat to the United States in the mid-1990s.

When the Bolshevik Revolution came around in 1917, the Thieves&#x27; World was alive and active. Vladimir Lenin attempted to wipe them out, but it failed, and the criminals survived into Joseph Stalin&#x27;s reign.

===1917–1991: Soviet era===
During Stalin&#x27;s reign as ruler, millions of people were sent to Gulag labor camps, where powerful criminals worked their way up to become thieves in law. These criminal elites often conveyed their status through complicated tattoos, symbols still used by Russian mobsters.

After Hitler&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, Stalin recruited more men to fight for the nation, offering prisoners freedom if they joined the army. Many flocked to help out in the war, but this act betrayed the codes of the Thieves&#x27; World that one must not ally with the government. Those who chose not to fight in the war referred to the traitors as &quot;suka&quot; (&#x27;bitch&#x27;), and the traitors landed at the bottom of the &quot;hierarchy&quot;. Outcasts, the &quot;suki&quot; separated from the others and formed their own groups and power bases by collaborating with prison officials, eventually gaining the luxury of comfortable positions. Bitterness between the groups erupted into a series of Bitch Wars from 1945 to 1953, with many killed every day. The prison officials encouraged the violence, seeing it as a way to rid the prisons of criminals.

Then, in the 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev loosened restrictions on private businesses, allowing them to grow legally, but by then, the Soviet Union was already beginning to collapse.

Also during the 1970s and 1980s, the United States expanded its immigration policies, allowing Soviet Jews, with most settling in a southern Brooklyn area known as Brighton Beach (sometimes nicknamed &quot;Little Odessa&quot;). Here is where Russian organized crime began in the US. The earliest known case of Russian crime in the area was in the mid-1970s by the &quot;Potato Bag Gang&quot;, a group of con artists disguised as merchants that told customers that they were selling antique gold rubles for cheap, but in fact, gave them bags of potatoes when bought in thousands. By 1983, the head of Russian organized crime in Brighton Beach was Evsei Agron.

Pauol Mirzoyan was a prime target among other mobsters, including rival Boris Goldberg and his organization, and in May 1985, Agron was assassinated. Boris &quot;Biba&quot; Nayfeld, his bodyguard, moved on to employ under Marat Balagula, who was believed to have succeeded Agron&#x27;s authority. In the following year, Balagula fled the country after he was convicted in a fraud scheme of Merrill Lynch customers and was found in Frankfurt, West Germany, in 1989, where he was extradited back to the US and sentenced to eight years in prison.

Balagula would later be convicted on a separate $360,000 credit card fraud in 1992. Nayfield took Balagula&#x27;s place, partnering with the &quot;Polish Al Capone&quot;, Ricardo Fanchiniin, in an import-export business and setting up a heroin business. In 1990, his former friend, Monya Elson, back from a six-year prison sentence in Israel, returned to America and set up a rival heroin business, culminating in a mafia turf war.

===1992–2000: growth and internationalization===
When the USSR collapsed and a free market economy emerged, organized criminal groups began to take over Russia&#x27;s economy, with many ex-KGB agents and veterans of the Afghan war offering their skills to the crime bosses. Gangster summit meetings had taken place in hotels and restaurants shortly before the Soviet&#x27;s dissolution, so that top &quot;vory v zakone&quot; could agree on who would rule what, and set plans on how to take over the post-communist states.

In the 1990s, in Russia and other post-Soviet countries, vast deposits of natural resources and businesses that the state had owned for decades were privatized. Former Soviet bureaucrats, factory directors, aggressive businessmen, and criminal organizations used insider deals, bribery, and simple brute force to grab lucrative assets. Businesses began building their own private armies of security agents, bodyguards, and commercial spies. They often bought the people and weapons of the former Soviet state or even those of the current Russian police. Russia&#x27;s new capitalists spent millions of dollars for protection, buying armor-plated cars, bomb sensors, hidden cameras, bulletproof vests, anti-wiretapping gear, and weapons, recruiting veterans of the Afghan and Chechen wars as their bodyguards. However, almost every business in Russia, from curbside vendors to huge oil and gas companies, made payments to organized crime for protection (&quot;&quot;krysha&quot;). Businessmen said that they needed the &quot;krysha&quot; because the laws and the court system were not functioning properly in Russia. The only way for them to enforce a contract was to turn to a criminal &quot;krysha&quot;&quot;. They also used it to intimidate competitors, enforce contracts, collect debts, or take over new markets. It was also becoming increasingly common for Russian businesses to turn to the &quot;red &quot;krysha&quot;&quot; (the corrupt police who doubled as a paid protection racket). Contract killings were common.

It was the period of internationalization of Russian organized crime. It was agreed that Vyacheslav &quot;Yaponchik&quot; Ivankov would be sent to Brighton Beach in 1992, allegedly because he was killing too many people in Russia and also to take control of Russian organized crime in North America. Within a year, he built an international operation that included but was not limited to narcotics, money laundering, and prostitution and made ties with the American Mafia and Colombian drug cartels, eventually extending to Miami, Los Angeles, and Boston.

Prior to Ivankov&#x27;s arrival, Balagula&#x27;s downfall left a void for America&#x27;s next &quot;vory v zakone&quot;. Monya Elson, leader of Monya&#x27;s &quot;Brigada&quot; (a gang that similarly operated from Russia to Los Angeles to New York), was in a feud with Boris Nayfeld, with bodies dropping on both sides. Ivankov&#x27;s arrival virtually ended the feud, although Elson would later challenge his power as well, and a number of attempts were made to end the former&#x27;s life. Nayfield and Elson would eventually be arrested in January 1994 (released in 1998) and in Italy in 1995, respectively.

According to FBI reports, the crime boss Semion Mogilevich had alliances with the Camorra, in particular with Salvatore DeFalco, a lower-echelon member of the Giuliano clan. Mogilevich and DeFalco would have held meetings in Prague in 1993. Semion Mogilevich&#x27;s net worth is estimated to be 10 billion dollars.

Ivankov&#x27;s reign also ended in June 1995 when a $3.5 million extortion attempt on two Russian businessmen, Alexander Volkov and Vladimir Voloshin, ended in an FBI arrest that resulted in a ten-year maximum security prison sentence. Before his arrest and besides his operations in America, Ivankov regularly flew around Europe and Asia to maintain ties with his fellow mobsters (like members of the Solntsevskaya Bratva), as well as reinforce ties with others. This did not stop other people from denying his growing power. In one instance, Ivankov attempted to buy out Georgian boss Valeri &quot;Globus&quot; Glugech&#x27;s drug importation business. When the latter refused the offer, he and his top associates were shot dead. A summit held in May 1994 in Vienna rewarded him with what was left of Glugech&#x27;s business. Two months later, Ivankov got into another altercation with drug kingpin and head of the Orekhovskaya gang, Segei &quot;Sylvester&quot; Timofeyev, ending with the latter murdered a month later.

In 1995, the Camorra cooperated with the Russian mafia in a scheme in which the Camorra would bleach out US$1 bills and reprint them as $100s. These bills would then be transported to the Russian mafia for distribution in 29 post-Eastern Bloc countries and former Soviet republics. In return, the Russian mafia paid the Camorra with property (including a Russian bank) and firearms, smuggled into Eastern Europe and Italy.

A report by the United Nations in 1995 placed the number of individuals involved in organized crime in Russia at 3 million, employed in about 5,700 gangs.

Back in Eastern Europe in May 1995, Semion Mogilevich held a summit meeting of Russian mafia bosses in his U Holubu restaurant in Anděl, a neighborhood of Prague. The excuse to bring them together was that it was a birthday party for Victor Averin, the second-in-command of the Solntsevskaya Bratva. However, Major Tomas Machacek of the Czech police got wind of an anonymous tip-off that claimed that the Solntsevskaya were planning to assassinate Mogilevich at the location (it was rumored that Mogilevich and Solntsevskaya leader Sergei Mikhailov had a dispute over $5 million), and the police successfully raided the meeting. 200 guests were arrested, but no charges were put against them; only key Russian mafia members were banned from the country, most of whom moved to Hungary.

One person who was not there was Mogilevich himself. He claimed that, &quot;[b]y the time I arrived at U Holubu, everything was already in full swing, so I went into a neighboring hotel and sat in the bar there until about five or six in the morning.&quot; Mikhailov would later be arrested in Switzerland in October 1996 on numerous charges, including that he was the head of a powerful Russian mafia group, but was exonerated and released two years later after evidence was not enough to prove much.

The global extent of Russian organized crime was not realized until Ludwig &quot;Tarzan&quot; Fainberg was arrested in January 1997, primarily because of arms dealing. In 1990, Fainberg moved from Brighton Beach to Miami and opened up a strip club called Porky&#x27;s, which soon became a popular hangout for underworld criminals. Fainberg himself gained a reputation as an ambassador among international crime groups, becoming especially close to Juan Almeida, a Colombian cocaine dealer. Planning to expand his cocaine business, Fainberg acted as an intermediary between Almeida and the corrupt Russian military. He helped him get six Russian military helicopters in 1993, and in the following year, helped arrange to buy a submarine for cocaine smuggling. Unfortunately for the two of them, federal agents had been keeping a close eye on Fainberg for months. Alexander Yasevich, an associate of the Russian military contact and an undercover DEA agent, was sent to verify the illegal dealing, and in 1997, Fainberg was finally arrested in Miami. Facing the possibility of life imprisonment, the latter agreed to testify against Almeida in exchange for a shorter sentence, which ended up being 33 months.

Vanuatu was a preferred location for Russian mafia laundering money.

===2001–present===
As the 21st century dawned, the Russian mafia remained after the death of Aslan Usoyan. New mafia bosses sprang up, while imprisoned ones were released. Among the released were Marat Balagula and Vyacheslav Ivankov, both in 2004. The latter was extradited to Russia, but was jailed once more for his alleged murders of two Turks in a Moscow restaurant in 1992; he was cleared of all charges and released in 2005. Four years later, he was assassinated by a shot in the stomach from a sniper. Meanwhile, Monya Elson and Leonid Roytman were arrested in March 2006 for an unsuccessful murder plot against two Kyiv-based businessmen.

In 2009, FBI agents in Moscow targeted two suspected mafia leaders and two other corrupt businessmen. One of the leaders is Yevgeny Dvoskin, a criminal who had been in prison with Ivankov in 1995 and was deported in 2001 for breaking immigration regulations; the other is Konstantin &quot;Gizya&quot; Ginzburg, who was reportedly the current &quot;big boss&quot; of Russian organized crime in America before his reported assassination in 2009, it being suspected that Ivankov handed over control to him.

In the same year, Semion Mogilevich was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for his involvement in a complex multimillion-dollar scheme that defrauded investors in the stock of his company YBM Magnex International, swindling them out of $150 million. He was indicted in 2003 and arrested in 2008 in Russia on tax fraud charges, but because the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, he was released on bail. Monya Elson said, in 1998, that Mogilevich is the most powerful mobster in the world.

Around the world, Russian mafia groups have popped up as dominating particular areas. Russian organized crime has a rather large stronghold in the city of Atlanta where members are distinguished by their tattoos. Russian organized crime was reported to have a stronger grip in the French Riviera region and Spain in 2010; and Russia was branded as a virtual &quot;mafia state&quot; according to the WikiLeaks cables.

According to recordings released in 2015, Alexander Litvinenko, shortly before he was assassinated, claimed that Semion Mogilevich has had a &quot;good relationship&quot; with Vladimir Putin since the 1990s.

On 7 June 2017, 33 Russian mafia affiliates and members were arrested and charged by the FBI, US Customs and Border Protection and NYPD for extortion, racketeering, illegal gambling, firearm offenses, narcotics trafficking, wire fraud, credit card fraud, identity theft, fraud on casino slot machines using electronic hacking devices; based in Atlantic City and Philadelphia, murder-for-hire conspiracy and cigarette trafficking. They were also accused of operating secret and underground gambling dens based in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and using violence against those who owed gambling debts, establishing nightclubs to sell drugs, plotting to force women associates to rob male strangers by seducing and drugging them with chloroform, and trafficking over 10,000 pounds of stolen chocolate confectionery; the chocolate was stolen from shipment containers. It is believed that 27 of the arrested are connected to the Russian mafia Shulaya clan which are largely based in New York.

On 26 September 2017, as part of a 4-year investigation, 100 Spanish Civil Guard officers carried out 18 searches in different areas of Málaga, Spain, related to Russian mafia large scale money laundering. The raids resulted in the arrests of 11 members and associates of the Solntsevskaya and Izmailovskaya clans. Money, firearms and 23 high-end vehicles were also seized. The owner of Marbella FC, Alexander Grinberg, and manager of AFK Sistema, a Spanish football club in Málaga, were among those arrested.

On 19 February 2018, 18 defendants were accused of laundering over $62 million through real estate, including with the help of Vladislav Reznik, former chairman of Rosgosstrakh, one of Russia&#x27;s largest insurance companies. The accused stood trial in Spain. The Tambov and Malyshev Russian mafia organisations were involved.

Alexander Torshin is allegedly a high ranking Russian mafia boss.

==Structure and composition==
In the Russian mafia, &quot;Vor&quot; (: &quot;Vory&quot;) () is an honorary title analogous to a made man in the Sicilian and Italian-American mafia. The honor of becoming a &quot;Vor&quot; is given only when the recruit shows considerable leadership skills, personal ability, intellect, and charisma. A Pakhan or another high-ranking member of an organization can decide if the recruit will receive such title. When you become a member of the &quot;Vor&quot;-world you have to accept the code of the &quot;Vor v Zakone&quot; (&#x27;thief in law&#x27;).

==Notable Russian mafia bosses==
* Zakhary Kalashov (born 1953): currently widely believed to be one of the most prominent members of the Russian mafia.
* Vyacheslav Ivankov (1940–2009): believed to have connections with Russian state intelligence organizations and their organized crime partners.
* Vladimir Kumarin (born 1956): former deputy president of the Petersburg Fuel Company (PTK) between 1998 and 1999, and the boss of the criminal Tambovskaya Bratva (Tambov gang) of Saint Petersburg.
* Sergei Mikhailov (born 1958): businessman and leader of the Solntsevskaya Bratva criminal syndicate.
* Semion Mogilevich (born 1946): described by agencies in the European Union and United States as the &quot;boss of all bosses&quot; of most Russian Mafia syndicates in the world.
* Aslan Usoyan (1937–2013): according to operational data and media materials, he was the leader of Caucasian criminal groups, in particular, the &quot;Tbilisi&quot; and &quot;Yazidis&quot; clans, as well as one of the most powerful criminal leaders and thieves in law in Russia.
* Tariel Oniani (born 1952): believed to be the leader of the &quot;Kutaisi gang&quot;, considered the most influential ethnic Georgian organized crime group in Russia.

<text>Elijah ben Solomon Zalman, ( &quot;Rabbi Eliyahu ben Shlomo Zalman&quot;), also known as the Vilna Gaon ( &quot;Der Vilner Goen&quot;; ; or Elijah of Vilna, or by his Hebrew acronym Gra (&quot;Gaon Rabbenu Eliyahu&quot;: &quot;Our great teacher Elijah&quot;; Sialiec, April 23, 1720Vilnius October 9, 1797), was a Lithuanian Jewish Talmudist, halakhist, kabbalist, and the foremost leader of misnagdic (non-hasidic) Jewry of the past few centuries. He is commonly referred to in Hebrew as &quot;ha-Gaon mi-Vilna&quot;, &quot;the genius from Vilnius&quot;.

Through his annotations and emendations of Talmudic and other texts, he became one of the most familiar and influential figures in rabbinic study since the Middle Ages. Although he is chronologically one of the &quot;Acharonim&quot;, some have considered him one of the &quot;Rishonim&quot;.

Large groups of people, including many &quot;yeshivas&quot;, uphold the set of Jewish customs and rites (&quot;minhag&quot;), the &quot;minhag ha-Gra&quot;, named after him, and which is also considered by many to be the prevailing Ashkenazi &quot;minhag&quot; in Jerusalem.

Born in Sielec in the Brest Litovsk Voivodeship (today Syalyets, Belarus), the Gaon displayed extraordinary talent while still a child. By the time he was twenty years old, rabbis were submitting their most difficult &quot;halakhic&quot; problems to him for legal rulings. He was a prolific author, writing such works as glosses on the Babylonian Talmud and &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; known as &quot;Bi&#x27;urei ha-Gra&quot; (&quot;Elaborations by the Gra&quot;), a running commentary on the Mishnah, &quot;Shenoth Eliyahu&quot; (&quot;The Years of Elijah&quot;), and insights on the Torah entitled &quot;Adereth Eliyahu&quot; (&quot;The Cloak of Elijah&quot;), published by his son. Various Kabbalistic works have commentaries in his name, and he wrote commentaries on the Proverbs and other books of the Tanakh later on in his life. None of his manuscripts were published in his lifetime.

When Hasidic Judaism became influential in his native town, the Vilna Gaon joined the &quot;opposers&quot; or &quot;Misnagdim&quot;, rabbis and heads of the Polish communities, to curb Hasidic influence.

While he advocated studying branches of secular education such as mathematics in order to better understand rabbinic texts, he harshly condemned the study of philosophy and metaphysics.

== Biography ==
Elijah was born to Treina and Rabbi Shlomo Zalman in the village of Slać, near Brisk, now in Belarus, then in Lithuania, which was part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, on 15 Nisan 5480 (April 23, 1720).

His grandfather was Yissachar Dov, the son of Rabbi Eliyahu Chassid, after whom he was named. Rabbi Eliyahu Chassid was the son of Rabbi Moshe Kramer, rabbi of Vilna, and his wife was the granddaughter of Rabbi Moshe Rivkes.

Until the age of six, he studied under a rabbi. At that age, he delivered a derasha in the Great Synagogue of Vilna, which his father had taught him. At the request of Rabbi Heschel, the Av Beit Din of Vilna, he added his own scholarly discourse to demonstrate his ability to innovate independently. His book &quot;Shnot Eliyahu&quot; contains an insight he expressed at the age of seven. At this age, he lived for about three months in Kaidan with the town&#x27;s rabbi, Rabbi David Katzenellenbogen, studying under him and Rabbi Moshe Margolies, author of &quot;Pnei Moshe&quot; on the Jerusalem Talmud (who later served as rabbi of Kaidan). At age nine, he began studying Kabbalah, devoting several hours daily to studying the Zohar and the writings of the Arizal. By age ten, he studied independently and no longer required teachers. During this time, he befriended Rabbi Aryeh Leib, later Av Beit Din of Tsechanovitz. From the age of eight, he engaged in astronomy.

As a young man, he married Chana, daughter of Yehuda Leib from Kaidan (1724–1782). His wife took responsibility for managing the household so he could devote himself entirely to study. After her passing in 5543 (1783), he requested that the following be inscribed on her tombstone: &quot;Chana passed away in 5543, 5 Kislev. She left no equal or comparison / There is no path or way to recount her praise.&quot; Later, he married Gitel, daughter of Meir Luntz from Chełm, who was also a widow.

At around age 20, he traveled to Poland and Germany, passing through Leszno and Berlin, and possibly also Amsterdam. He returned to Vilna in 5505 (1745). Over the years, he lived in Vilna but consistently refused to hold an official rabbinic position that would interfere with his studies. Nevertheless, the Vilna community, considering it an honor to have him in their city, granted him a small monthly stipend for his livelihood.

The Vilna Gaon became famous for his extraordinary diligence. His sons recount that throughout his life, he slept only two hours a day, divided into four half-hour segments, ensuring he never slept more than &quot;Sixty Breaths&quot;. He dedicated all his time exclusively to Torah study. His student, Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin, described how, when he was preoccupied with a Talmudic difficulty, he would refrain from eating for days until he found a resolution, appearing emaciated and afflicted.

== Status ==
The Vilna Gaon attained an extraordinary and undisputed status during his lifetime. Among the general non-Hasidic public, his standing was considered exceptional. He was perceived as belonging to the ranks of the Tannaim and Amoraim, the sages of the Talmud, or as akin to the Geonim of Babylonia.

Rabbi Avraham Yeshayahu Karelitz (the &quot;Chazon Ish&quot;) wrote about him: 

Due to this reverence, he was referred to by Litvak Jewry simply as &quot;the Gaon.&quot;

 
The Vilna Gaon advocated for a study approach focused on the peshat (literal meaning) and was himself widely knowledgeable and erudite. His in-law, the author of &quot;Chayei Adam&quot;, wrote about him: 
He opposed sharp dialectical analysis (pilpul) in learning, just as Maimonides, the Maharal, Rav Kook, and other Jewish sages did. In his small study hall, students learned Talmud with the commentaries of Rashi, the Rosh, and the Rif, in a straightforward manner aimed at reaching halachic conclusions.

The Vilna Gaon was highly original in his halachic rulings and often ruled based on his own understanding of the Talmud, even against the Rishonim and the Shulchan Aruch, or in opposition to established customs.
His learning was based on a deep pursuit of the literal meaning from the sources, as well as on textual emendations, especially in less commonly studied works such as the Jerusalem Talmud, the Tosefta, and the Zohar. Despite his historical significance to the Misnagdim, the method of study practiced in contemporary litvak yeshivas differs significantly from his approach. Most of his textual emendations were not based on manuscript evidence available to him but rather on his exceptional mastery of rabbinic and Talmudic literature. In retrospect, many of his emendations have been found to align with accurate textual witnesses.

On the evening following Yom Kippur, the Vilna Gaon would continue fasting for several more hours while studying Torah. He did this based on the teaching of the Sages: 
In other words, the world’s existence depends on uninterrupted Torah study. Since, on the night after Yom Kippur, everyone went home to eat, the Vilna Gaon would continue learning until people finished their meals and returned to study. This idea also served as the foundation of Volozhin Yeshiva, established by his disciple, Rabbi Chaim.

===Kabbalah in his teachings===
By the age of nine, the Vilna Gaon knew all of Tanach and Shas with commentaries, and had already begun studying Kabbalah.
The Gaon wrote commentaries on &quot;Sifra de-Tzeniuta&quot;, which he regarded as the foundational work of Kabbalah, as well as on &quot;Tikkunei Zohar&quot;, &quot;Tikkunei Zohar Chadash&quot;, and other sections of the Zohar, as well as on &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;.

However, unlike other Kabbalists, the Gaon opposed the reception of maggid revelations, as he wished to toil in Torah study and receive divine wisdom directly from God rather than through intermediaries. He also sent his disciple, Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin, to warn his brother, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman of Volozhin, not to accept a maggid that was destined to appear to him, explaining that the maggidim of that generation, particularly outside the Land of Israel, &quot;could not possibly be entirely sacred and free of any impurity.&quot;

The teachings of the Vilna Gaon in Kabbalah are considered a distinct stream (although they are sometimes integrated with the teachings of Ramchal), and many Kabbalists have studied and interpreted them, such as his disciples: Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin in his book &quot;Nefesh HaChaim&quot;, Rabbi Moshe of Tolchin, Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Shklov, and the disciples of his disciples, Rabbi Yitzhak Isaac Chever, Rabbi David Luria, Rabbi Avraham Simcha of Amchislav, Rabbi Elijah of Kalish, as well as Rabbi Shlomo Elyashiv in his book &quot;Leshem Shevo VeAchlamah&quot;, Rabbi Naftali Herz Halevy of Jaffa, and others.

In our generation, the writings of the Vilna Gaon have been studied by Rabbi Yitzhak Shlomo Zilberman, Rabbi Sharya Dublitzky, Rabbi Israel Eliyahu Winterob, Rabbi Yaakov Edes (Divrei Yaakov), and Rabbi Yosef Avivi, who also wrote a special book explaining the uniqueness of the Vilna Gaon’s Kabbalah and the differences between it and the Kabbalah of Arizal.

During the struggle between the Hasidim and the Misnagdim, the Hasidim spread a rumor that the Vilna Gaon did not believe in the teachings of Kabbalah and did not engage in the Zohar or the writings of Arizal. By doing so, they sought to undermine the Gaon’s opposition to Hasidism. The Vilna Gaon’s disciple, Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin, in his introduction to the Vilna Gaon’s commentary on Sifra D’Tzeniuta, sharply criticizes those who spread the rumor, with the following words: 

===The teachings of redemption in his doctrine===
According to the book Kol HaTor, which some attribute to Rabbi Hillel Rivlin of Shklov, in the year 1740 (the Hebrew year 5500), the Gaon began his open engagement with Kabbalah. According to his views on the Redemption, the year 5500 marks the beginning of the “sixth day” of the world, in which preparations should be made for the Sabbath, when the complete redemption will come. This calculation is based on the words of the Talmud in Sanhedrin (Sanhedrin 38b), which states that the world will exist for six thousand years. The Gaon considered each millennium as a day, based on the verse &quot;For a thousand years in Your eyes are but as yesterday when it passes&quot;, meaning that the year 5500 is the morning of the sixth day. Just as the Halakhah requires one to rise early on Friday and prepare for the Sabbath, so, according to the Gaon’s words, one should prepare for the “Sabbath” of the world starting from the “morning of the sixth day.”

===A new Shulchan Aruch===
According to what was written by the Gaon’s son, the Gaon intended to compose a new version of the Shulchan Aruch:
— From the introduction to the Shulchan Aruch – &quot;Orach Chaim&quot;, Shklov, 1803

===His attitude towards secular studies and philosophy===
The Gaon supported secular studies, which included some of the sciences, primarily the natural sciences, and even wrote a book on mathematics, astronomy, and geometry titled &quot;Il Mishulash&quot;. In the introduction to the translation of &quot;Euclid’s Elements&quot; (translated into Hebrew by Rabbi Baruch Shklov in The Hague in 1780), it is quoted in his name:

The words of Rabbi Baruch Shik are supported by a translation written by the Vilna Gaon&#x27;s son, Rabbi Avraham Vilner, of parts of the &quot;Natural History&quot; by the radical French scientist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon.

According to the testimony of his disciples and the books written in his name, the Gaon was knowledgeable in mathematics, engineering, biology, astronomy, geography, linguistics, and music, but he refrained from engaging in pharmacy based on his father&#x27;s instructions.

He also studied human philosophy but opposed the study of general humanities because he did not see them as having true value for Jewish life. The Gaon distinguished between the humanities and the natural sciences, which he saw as &quot;pharmacology and medicine&quot; assisting in the understanding of the Torah.

Rabbi Yisrael Shklov recounts the Gaon’s teachings:
In contrast to his view on natural sciences, he strongly opposed philosophy and its practitioners, as stated in the book &quot;Even Shlomo&quot; (a compilation of his writings) in chapter 11, section 4. He said:
In a footnote there, it is further mentioned regarding this passage:
In his commentary on the Book of Isaiah, chapter 2, verse 6, the Gaon wrote:
The Vilna Gaon&#x27;s commentary on Yoreh De&#x27;ah, section 319, subsection 6, small subsection 13:
Some saw his favorable attitude towards secular studies as the reason for the spread of the Haskala in Lithuania more than in Hasidic Poland. This claim was refuted in later research.

==Attempt to make Aliyah to the land of Israel==

It is known that the Vilna Gaon tried to immigrate to the Land of Israel, and even wrote a letter to his family while traveling to Königsberg, which was later published under the title &quot;Aliyah to Terufah.&quot; In the letter, he wrote that he was going to the &quot;desired Land of Israel and the desire of God, whose upper and lower realms yearn for it.&quot; However, this attempt was unsuccessful, and he decided to return home, stating that he had no permission from heaven to make aliyah to the Land of Israel.

There is disagreement regarding the year in which the Vilna Gaon tried to make aliyah. Dov Eliyach, in his book &quot;The Gaon,&quot; tries to prove from the wording of the letter that the attempt occurred when the Gaon was around forty years old, likely in the winter of Tavkuf Kaf (1759–1760). The book &#x27;Kol HaTor&#x27; states that he attempted to make aliyah in the year Tavmem Bet (1782). In contrast, Dr. Aryeh Morgenstern argues that the attempt occurred around the year Tavkuf Lamed Chet (1778), based on documents from the Jewish community in Holland mentioning a person named &quot;Rabbi Eliyahu from Vilna,&quot; although it is unclear whether this refers to the Gaon. Eli Eliyach suggested that the attempt took place in the summer of the year Tavkuf Zayin (1767).

As described in the book &quot;Kol HaTor&quot;, the Vilna Gaon sought to renew the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel, to revive its desolate areas, and to create a group of wise and moral individuals whom he called &quot;Anshei Emunah&quot; (People of Faith). He believed this would pave the way for the arrival of the Messiah, whom he anticipated would appear in the year Tav Resh (1840). He proclaimed, &quot;The voice of the turtle dove is heard in our land&quot; (based on Song of Songs 2:12).

Following his teachings and through the initiative of his disciple Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin, many of his students made aliyah to the Land of Israel beginning in the year Tav Kaf Chet (1808), in the aliyah known as the &quot;Aliyat Talmidei HaGra&quot; led by his disciple Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Shklov. Initially, they settled in Safed and established the Perushim community there. From the year Tav Kuf Ayin Vav (1816), some of them moved to Jerusalem and re-established the Ashkenazi community there.

==Opposition to Hasidism==

The Vilna Gaon opposed the Hasidic movement due to various distortions he saw in it, which led him to classify it as heresy and a movement stemming from impurity. As early as the year Tav Kuf Lamed Bet (1772), the Gaon&#x27;s signature appeared on the excommunication decree of the Vilna community against Hasidism. In the year Tav Kuf Mem Aleph (1781), he issued another excommunication. He refused to meet with the founder of the Chabad Hasidic movement, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, and instructed that the book &quot;Tzav HaRivash&quot; be publicly burned.

There are various opinions regarding the distortions the Gaon saw in Hasidism. Shimon Dubnov argued that Hasidism threatened the communal structure of the rabbinic Jewish faith by placing emotion before reason, in addition to concerns that it was a new messianic movement rising against Judaism. Others argued that Hasidism was perceived as a frivolous movement that mocked Torah scholars who opposed it, accompanied by actions viewed as lighthearted, such as disrespect for prayer times, standing on one&#x27;s head, and more. Rabbi Joseph Dov Halevi Soloveitchik of Boston added that the Gaon saw Hasidism spreading rapidly, which caused him to fear that it was &quot;the work of Satan,&quot; as holiness usually spreads slowly.

Some claim that the opposition stemmed from the Gaon&#x27;s belief that Hasidism contained elements that differed from the Jewish faith as it had been accepted until then. In a letter from the Gaon, he referred to Hasidism as the worship of wood and stone, a statement that indicates the theological aspect of his opposition to Hasidism, identifying it as deviating from the fundamentals of Jewish faith. He may have meant the oversimplification of complex Kabbalistic ideas, such as the presence of God in the physical world and the existence of &quot;Nitzotzot&quot; (holy sparks) in the world, even in simple things like trees and stones, for the purpose of &quot;clarifying the sparks,&quot; a central concept in Hasidic thought. There may also be a hint to his suspicions that Hasidism continued or resembled dangerous heresy and antinomianism, as seen in the Shabbatean and Frankist movements.

In a letter from Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi to his followers in Vilna, he mentions that the Gaon&#x27;s opposition to him stemmed from a disagreement on defining the presence of God in the physical world.

==His students==
The Vilna Gaon did not have students in the usual sense of the word and did not serve as the head of a yeshiva. However, in the winter of Tav Kuf Mem Ches (1767), he established a beit midrash adjacent to his home, where he occasionally gave lectures, primarily in his youth, and where select Torah scholars studied. They would present their questions and doubts before him. His students felt the immense gap between themselves and him and refused to be called his &quot;students&quot;. The Gaon&#x27;s sons, in the introduction to the Gaon&#x27;s commentary on the Shulchan Aruch, compiled a list of some of his distinguished students:
* Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin – Considered his greatest student, he established the Volozhin Yeshiva, the central yeshiva in Europe, and wrote the book Nefesh HaChaim, in part as a polemic against the Hasidic movement.
* Rabbi Shlomo Av Beit Din of Vilkomir
* Rabbi Shlomo Zalman of Volozhin – Brother of Rabbi Chaim.
* Rabbi Shlomo of Tolchin – One of his first students to immigrate to Israel while the Gaon was still alive.
* Rabbi Saadia – Brother-in-law of Rabbi Shlomo Zalman of Volozhin, a leader of the Aliyah of the Gaon&#x27;s Students. He served the Gaon and wrote down his conduct, which was later published in the book &quot;Maaseh Rav&quot;, and was his emissary in the struggle against Hasidism.
* Rabbi Moshe Shlomo of Tolchin – A preacher in the community of Vilna, a close disciple of the Gaon in Kabbalah, and an editor of some of his writings.
* Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch of Smiatits.
* Rabbi Shlomo of Mohilev.
* Rabbi Benjamin Rivlin.

The Gaon&#x27;s sons write that in his later years, two brothers from Shklov, Rabbi Binyamin and Rabbi Menachem Mendel, came closer to him:
* Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Shklov served the Gaon during his last two years and was one of the leaders of the Aliyah of the Gaon&#x27;s Students to Israel, founding the Ashkenazi community in Jerusalem.
* Rabbi Menasha of Ilya – Author of the book &quot;Alfei Menashe.&quot; Known for his work in science and original philosophical views.
* Rabbi Jacob Kahana – Son-in-law of Rabbi Yissachar Ber, the Gaon&#x27;s brother.
* Rabbi Pinchas ben Yehuda Altshul (Pinchas of Płock) – A preacher, author of several books.
* Rabbi Menachem Mendel – Author of the book &quot;Tammim Yachdav,&quot; a preacher in the community of Ponevezh.
* Rabbi Israel of Shklov – Served the Gaon during the last six months of his life, one of the leaders of the Aliyah of the Gaon&#x27;s Students, author of the book Peat HaShulchan and a commentary on Tractate Shekalim, and an editor of several of the Gaon&#x27;s works.
* Rabbi Hillel Rivlin of Shklov, son of Rabbi Benjamin – One of the immigrants in the Aliyah of the Gaon&#x27;s Students in the year Tav Kuf Samech Bet (1832). The book Kol HaTor is attributed to him, although some claim he was not a student of the Gaon.
* Rabbi Yehuda Leib Halevi Adel of Slonim – An expert in Hebrew grammar who assisted the Gaon in writing his books.
* Rabbi Chiel Michal of Minsk

==His writings==
The teachings of the Vilna Gaon were published in books covering many areas of Torah, including commentaries on the Torah, the Prophets, the Megillot, the book of Chronicles, Mishnahs from Zeraim and Taharot, explanations of the Jerusalem Talmud, Tosefta, Minor Tractates, Torat Kohanim, and more. In the realm of Kabbalah, his teachings include commentaries on parts of the Zohar, Sifra de-Tzeniuta, Heikhalot, and the Sefer Yetzirah, among others. The Vilna Gaon also frequently explained Midrashim through the lens of Kabbalah.

According to the words of Rabbi Israel of Shklov, it is believed that the Gaon wrote all his works up to the age of 40 (except for the glosses on all of the Talmudic literature). After this, he lectured to his students or dictated his teachings to them.

The bibliographer Isaiah Winograd compiled a complete book &quot;Treasury of the Vilna Gaon’s Books&quot; in which he gathered all the Vilna Gaon’s works in their editions as they were printed until the year Tav Shin Nun Chet (1998). Some of his books have recently been edited in a clearer and annotated form by Rabbi Shlomo Bravda.

His student, Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin, writes: 

==His family==
The Vilna Gaon was the eldest of his siblings and had four brothers:
* Rabbi Moshe, preacher and Mo&quot;tz in the town of Podzelova near Vilkomir

==Commemoration==

Synagogues have been established in the name of the Vilna Gaon, particularly in the Shaarei Chesed neighborhood in Jerusalem. In addition, Yeshivat HaGra (now Kollel Avrechim) in Haifa, Yeshivat Aderet Eliyahu and Kehillat Aderet Eliyahu in the Old City of Jerusalem were founded in his name, aiming to follow his path.

Portraits of the Vilna Gaon began to be published as lithographs between the years 1821–1825. The original artist was the head of the lithographic department at the University of Vilna, the Lithuanian-Polish artist Joseph Hilary Globzicki.

In 1999, the Government of Israel requested to bring the Vilna Gaon’s remains to Israel, but the request was denied by the Lithuanian government, partly due to the opposition of the Jewish community there.

The year 2020, marking the 300th anniversary of the Gaon’s birth, was declared by the Lithuanian Parliament as the Year of the Vilna Gaon and the Year of Jewish History. In the same year, the Vilna Gaon Museum of Jewish History in Lithuania was named in his honor.

===The HaGra Institute for the publication of his writings===
In the 1990s, the HaGra World Institute was established in Bnei Brak (Israel) and New York (United States) to print his books and writings with innovations and explanations of his teachings, as well as the publication of the writings of his HaGra students and their yeshivas, led by the descendants of Rabbi Yerucham Fishel Pepper, the brothers Rabbi Nehemiah Pepper and Rabbi Shmuel Yaakov Pepper.

<text>The Protectorate of Uganda was a protectorate of the British Empire from 1894 to 1962. In 1893 the Imperial British East Africa Company transferred its administration rights of territory consisting mainly of the Kingdom of Buganda to the British government.

In 1894 the Uganda Protectorate was established, and the territory was extended beyond the borders of Buganda to an area that roughly corresponds to that of present-day Uganda.

== History ==
=== Background ===
In the mid-1880s, the Kingdom of Buganda was divided between four religious factions – Adherents of Uganda&#x27;s Native Religion, Catholics, Protestants and Muslims – each vying for political control. In 1888, Mwanga II was ousted in a coup led by the Muslim faction, who installed Kalema as leader. The following year, a Protestant and Catholic coalition formed to remove Kalema and return Mwanga II to power. This coalition secured an alliance with the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC), and succeeded in ousting Kalema and reinstating Mwanga in 1890.

The IBEAC sent Frederick Lugard to Uganda in 1890 as its chief representative and to help maintain the peace between the competing factions. In 1891, Mwanga concluded a treaty with Lugard whereby Mwanga would place his land and tributary states under the protection of the IBEAC.

In 1892, having subdued the Muslim faction, the Protestants and Catholics resumed their struggle for supremacy which led to civil war. That same year, the British government extended their support for the IBEAC to remain in Uganda until 1893. Despite strong opposition to getting involved in Uganda, the government felt that withdrawal of British influence would lead to war and the threat of a fellow European power encroaching on Britain&#x27;s sphere of influence in East Africa it shared with Germany in 1890.

On 31 March 1893, the IBEAC formally ended its involvement in Uganda. Missionaries, led by Alfred Tucker, lobbied the British government to take over the administration of Uganda in place of the IBEAC, arguing that British withdrawal would lead to a continuance of the civil war between the different religious factions. Shortly after, Sir Gerald Portal, a representative of the British government on the ground in Uganda, proposed a plan of double chieftainships – whereby every chieftainship would have one Protestant and one Catholic chief. On 19 April 1893, the British government and the chiefs of Uganda signed a treaty giving effect to this plan.

On 18 June 1894, the British government declared that Uganda would come under British protection as a Protectorate.

=== 1894–1901 ===
The Uganda Agreement of 1900 solidified the power of the largely Protestant &#x27;Bakungu&#x27; client-chiefs, led by Kagwa. London sent only a few officials to administer the country, relying primarily on the &#x27;Bakungu&#x27; chiefs. For decades they were preferred because of their political skills, their Christianity, their friendly relations with the British, their ability to collect taxes, and the proximity of Entebbe (the Ugandan colonial capital) to the Buganda capital. By the 1920s, the British administrators were more confident and had less need for military or administrative support. Colonial officials taxed cash crops produced by the peasants. There was popular discontent among the Baganda rank-and-file, which weakened the position of their leaders. In 1912, Kagwa moved to solidify &#x27;Bakungu&#x27; power by proposing a second &#x27;Lukiko&#x27; for Buganda with himself as president and the &#x27;Bakungu&#x27; as a sort of hereditary aristocracy. British officials vetoed the idea when they discovered widespread popular opposition. Instead, British officials began some reforms and attempted to make the &#x27;Lukiko&#x27; a genuine representative assembly.

Although momentous change occurred during the colonial era in Uganda, some characteristics of late-nineteenth-century African society survived to reemerge at the time of independence. The status of Protectorate had significantly different consequences for Uganda than had the region been made a colony like neighbouring Kenya, insofar as Uganda retained a degree of self-government that would have otherwise been limited under a full colonial administration.

Colonial rule, however, affected local economic systems dramatically, in part because the first concern of the British was financial. Quelling the 1897 sudanese mutiny (see Uganda before 1900) under the leadership of protectorate commissioner George Wilson CB had been costly—units of the British Indian Army had been transported to Uganda at considerable expense. The new commissioner of Uganda in 1900, Sir Harry H. Johnston, had orders to establish an efficient administration and to levy taxes as quickly as possible. Johnston approached the chiefs in Uganda with offers of jobs in the colonial administration in return for their collaboration.

The chiefs were more interested in preserving Uganda as a self-governing entity, continuing the royal line of Kabakas, and securing private land tenure for themselves and their supporters. Hard bargaining ensued, but the chiefs ended up with everything they wanted, including one-half of all the land in Buganda. The half left to the British as &quot;Crown Land&quot; was later found to be largely swamp and scrub.

Johnston&#x27;s Uganda Agreement of 1900 imposed a tax on huts and guns, designated the chiefs as tax collectors, and testified to the continued alliance of British and Baganda interests. The British signed much less generous treaties with the other kingdoms (Toro in 1900, Ankole in 1901, and Bunyoro in 1933) without the provision of large-scale private land tenure. The smaller chiefdoms of Busoga were ignored.

=== Buganda administrators ===
The Baganda immediately offered their services to the British as administrators over their recently conquered neighbours, an offer which was attractive to the economy-minded colonial administration. Baganda agents fanned out as local tax collectors and labour organizers in areas such as Kigezi, Mbale, and, significantly, Bunyoro. This sub-imperialism and Ganda cultural chauvinism was resented by the people being administered.

Wherever they went, Baganda insisted on the exclusive use of their language, Luganda, and they planted bananas as the only proper food worth eating. They regarded their traditional dress—long cotton gowns called kanzus—as civilized; all else was barbarian. They also encouraged and engaged in mission work, attempting to convert locals to their form of Christianity or Islam. In some areas, the resulting backlash aided the efforts of religious rivals — for example, Catholics won converts in areas where oppressive rule was identified with a Protestant Muganda chief.

The people of Bunyoro were particularly aggrieved, having fought the Baganda and the British; having a substantial section of their heartland annexed to Buganda as the &quot;lost counties&quot;, and finally having &quot;arrogant&quot; Baganda administrators issuing orders, collecting taxes, and forcing unpaid labour. In 1907 the Banyoro rose in a rebellion called &quot;nyangire&quot;, or &quot;refusing&quot;, and succeeded in having the Baganda subimperial agents withdrawn.

Meanwhile, in 1901 the completion of the Uganda Railway from the coast at Mombasa to the Lake Victoria port of Kisumu moved colonial authorities to encourage the growth of cash crops to help pay the railway&#x27;s operating costs. Another result of the railway construction was the 1902 decision to transfer the eastern section of the Uganda Protectorate to the Kenya Colony, then called the East Africa Protectorate, to keep the entire line under one local colonial administration. Because the railway experienced cost overruns in Kenya, the British decided to justify its exceptional expense and pay its operating costs by introducing large-scale European settlement in a vast tract of land that became a centre of cash-crop agriculture known as the &quot;White Highlands&quot;. A major part of the territory eventually left out of the &quot;East Africa Protectorate&quot; was the Uganda Scheme, in which the British Empire offered to create a Jewish nation-state. The offer was made to the Zionist movement which rejected it, refusing to accept anything other than the ancient Land of Israel.

In many areas of Uganda, by contrast, agricultural production was placed in the hands of Africans, if they responded to the opportunity. Cotton was the crop of choice, largely because of pressure by the British Cotton Growing Association, textile manufacturers who urged the colonies to provide raw materials for British mills. This was done by cash cropping the land. Even the CMS joined the effort by launching the Uganda Company (managed by a former missionary) to promote cotton planting and to buy and transport the produce.

Buganda, with its strategic location on the lakeside, reaped the benefits of cotton growing. The advantages of this crop were quickly recognized by the Baganda chiefs who had newly acquired freehold estates, which came to be known as mailo because they were measured in square miles. In 1905 the initial baled cotton export was valued at £200; in 1906, £1,000; in 1907; £11,000; and in 1908, £52,000. By 1915 the value of cotton exports had climbed to £369,000, and Britain was able to end its subsidy of colonial administration in Uganda, while in Kenya the white settlers required continuing subsidies by the home government.

The income generated by cotton sales made the Uganda kingdom relatively prosperous, compared with the rest of colonial Uganda, although before World War I cotton was also being grown in the eastern regions of Busoga, Lango, and Teso. Many Baganda spent their new earnings on imported clothing, bicycles, metal roofing, and even cars. They also invested in their children&#x27;s education. The Christian missions emphasized literacy skills, and African converts quickly learned to read and write. By 1911 two popular journals, &quot;Ebifa&quot; (News) and &quot;Munno&quot; (Your Friend), were published monthly in Luganda.

Heavily supported by African funds, new schools were soon turning out graduating classes at Mengo High School, St. Mary&#x27;s Kisubi, Namilyango, Gayaza, and King&#x27;s College Budo — all in Buganda. The chief minister of the Buganda kingdom, Sir Apollo Kaggwa, personally awarded a bicycle to the top graduate at King&#x27;s College Budo, together with the promise of a government job. The schools, in fact, had inherited the educational function formerly performed in the Kabaka&#x27;s palace, where generations of young pages had been trained to become chiefs. Now the qualifications sought were literacy and skills, including typing and English translation.

Two important principles of precolonial political life carried over into the colonial era: clientage, whereby ambitious younger officeholders attached themselves to older high-ranking chiefs, and generational conflict, which resulted when the younger generation sought to expel their elders from office in order to replace them. After World War I, the younger aspirants to high office in Buganda became impatient with the seemingly perpetual tenure of Sir Apollo and his contemporaries, who lacked many of the skills that members of the younger generation had acquired through schooling. Calling themselves the Young Baganda Association, members of the new generation attached themselves to the young Kabaka, Daudi Chwa, who was the figurehead ruler of Buganda under indirect rule. But Kabaka Daudi never gained real political power, and after a short and frustrating reign, he died at the relatively young age of forty-three.

=== First World War era military forces ===
Early on in the Protectorate&#x27;s history of occupation the British colonial government had recognised the need for a local defence force. In 1895 the British colonial armed force in the Protectorate was the Uganda Rifles, who were formed as an internal security force (i.e. keeping the peace in tribal areas rather than defending against external aggression). In the late nineteenth century the local defence force was largely composed of Sudanese troops brought in by the British, these troops were commanded by a mix of British and Sudanese officers, local tribes were not that evident in this force defending the interests of the Imperial British East Africa Company. Unfortunately the Sudanese grew resentful of their conditions of service and the Uganda Rifles mutinied in 1897. On 1 January 1902 the somewhat irregular armed force in Uganda was reformed (with far fewer Sudanese and more local tribes in its ranks) and re-titled the 4th Battalion the King&#x27;s African Rifles (KAR). It was with this defensive structure that was in place at the outbreak of hostilities in 1914, although there had been cuts in the KAR in 1911 stretching the force structure of the regiment even further. By the end of the Great War the Ugandan contingent in the KAR had grown considerably and they had become an effective fighting force built out of Ugandans rather than outsiders and had enjoyed success against the German forces in East Africa. The Protectorate also developed an emergency response for the intelligence collection on German activities and performing political-military liaison with allies in East Africa; according to UK National Archive records this organisation (known as the Uganda Intelligence Department) was about 20 strong and included European officers and African soldiers.

Most of this recruitment was done from the northern part of the protectorate especially the Acholi sub-region. The British colonial administration had also fought with the Lamogi clan of the Acholi people in what that culminated in to the Lamogi Rebellion.

=== 1920 to 1961 ===
Far more promising as a source of political support were the British colonial officers, who welcomed the typing and translation skills of school graduates and advanced the careers of their favourites. The contest was decided after World War I, when an influx of British ex-military officers, now serving as district commissioners, began to feel that self-government was an obstacle to good government. Specifically, they accused Sir Apollo and his generation of inefficiency, abuse of power, and failure to keep adequate financial accounts—charges that were not hard to document.

Sir Apollo resigned in 1926, at about the same time that a host of elderly Baganda chiefs were replaced by a new generation of officeholders. The Buganda treasury was also audited that year for the first time. Although it was not a nationalist organization, the Young Baganda Association claimed to represent popular African dissatisfaction with the old order. As soon as the younger Baganda had replaced the older generation in office, however, their objections to privilege accompanying power ceased. The pattern persisted in Ugandan politics up to and after independence.

The commoners, who had been labouring on the cotton estates of the chiefs before World War I, did not remain servile. As time passed, they bought small parcels of land from their erstwhile landlords. This land fragmentation was aided by the British, who in 1927 forced the chiefs to limit severely the rents and obligatory labour they could demand from their tenants. Thus the oligarchy of landed chiefs who had emerged with the Uganda Agreement of 1900 declined in importance, and agricultural production shifted to independent smallholders, who grew cotton, and later coffee, for the export market.

Unlike Tanganyika, which was devastated during the prolonged fighting between Britain and Germany in the East African Campaign of World War I, Uganda prospered from wartime agricultural production. After the population losses from disease during the era of conquest and at the turn of the century (particularly the devastating sleeping sickness epidemic of 1900–1906), Uganda&#x27;s population was growing again. Even the 1930s depression seemed to affect smallholder cash farmers in Uganda less severely than it did the white settler producers in Kenya. Ugandans simply grew their own food until rising prices made export crops attractive again.

Two issues continued to create grievance through the 1930s and 1940s. The colonial government strictly regulated the buying and processing of cash crops, setting prices and reserving the role of intermediary for Asians, who were thought to be more efficient. The British and Asians firmly repelled African attempts to break into cotton ginning. In addition, on the Asian-owned sugar plantations established in the 1920s, labour for sugar-cane and other cash crops was increasingly provided by migrants from peripheral areas of Uganda and even from outside Uganda.

=== Independence ===
In 1949, discontented Baganda rioted and burned down the houses of pro-government chiefs. The rioters had three demands: the right to bypass government price controls on the export sales of cotton, the removal of the Asian monopoly over cotton ginning, and the right to have their own representatives in local government replace chiefs appointed by the British. They were critical as well of the young Kabaka, Frederick Walugembe Mutesa II (also known as &quot;King Freddie&quot; or &quot;Kabaka Freddie&quot;), for his inattention to the needs of his people. The British governor, Sir John Hall, regarded the riots as the work of communist-inspired agitators and rejected the suggested reforms.

Far from leading the people into confrontation, Uganda&#x27;s would-be agitators were slow to respond to popular discontent. Nevertheless, the Uganda African Farmers Union, founded by I.K. Musazi in 1947, was blamed for the riots and was banned by the British. Musazi&#x27;s Uganda National Congress replaced the farmers union in 1952 when it was set up with Abu Mayanja as its first Secretary General, but because the Congress remained a casual discussion group more than an organized political party, it stagnated and came to an end just two years after its inception.

Meanwhile, the British began to move ahead of the Ugandans in preparing for independence. The effects of Britain&#x27;s postwar withdrawal from India, the march of nationalism in West Africa, and a more liberal philosophy in the Colonial Office geared toward future self-rule all began to be felt in Uganda. The embodiment of these issues arrived in 1952 in the person of a new and energetic reformist governor, Sir Andrew Cohen (formerly undersecretary for African affairs in the Colonial Office).

Cohen set about preparing Uganda for independence. On the economic side, he removed obstacles to African cotton ginning, rescinded price discrimination against African-grown coffee, encouraged cooperatives, and established the Uganda Development Corporation to promote and finance new projects. On the political side, he reorganized the Legislative Council, which had consisted of an unrepresentative selection of interest groups heavily favouring the European community, to include African representatives elected from districts throughout Uganda. This system became a prototype for the future Parliament of Uganda.

== Power politics in Buganda ==
The prospect of elections caused a sudden proliferation of new political parties. This development alarmed the old-guard leaders within the Ugandan kingdoms, because they realized that the centre of power would be at the national level. The spark that ignited wider opposition to Governor Cohen&#x27;s reforms was a 1953 speech in London in which the secretary of state for colonies referred to the possibility of a federation of the three East African territories (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika), similar to that established in Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

Many Ugandans were aware of the Central African Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (later Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi) and its domination by white settler interests. Ugandans deeply feared the prospect of an East African federation dominated by the settlers of Kenya, which was then in the midst of the bitter Mau Mau uprising. They had vigorously resisted a similar suggestion by the 1930 Hilton Young Commission. Confidence in Cohen vanished just as the Governor was preparing to urge Buganda to recognize that its special status would have to be sacrificed in the interests of a new and larger nation-state.

Kabaka Mutesa II, who had been regarded by his subjects as uninterested in their welfare, now refused to cooperate with Cohen&#x27;s plan for an integrated Buganda. Instead, he demanded that Buganda be separated from the rest of the protectorate and transferred to Foreign Office jurisdiction. Cohen&#x27;s response to this crisis was to deport the Kabaka to a comfortable exile in London. His forced departure made the Kabaka an instant martyr in the eyes of the Baganda, whose latent separatism and anticolonial sentiments set off a storm of protest. Cohen&#x27;s action had backfired, and he could find no one among the Baganda prepared or able to mobilize support for his schemes. After two frustrating years of unrelenting Ganda hostility and obstruction, Cohen was forced to reinstate Kabaka Mutesa II.

The negotiations leading to the Kabaka&#x27;s return had an outcome similar to the negotiations of Commissioner Johnston in 1900; although appearing to satisfy the British, they were a resounding victory for the Baganda. Cohen secured the Kabaka&#x27;s agreement not to oppose independence within the larger Ugandan framework. Not only was the Kabaka reinstated in return, but for the first time since 1889, the monarch was given the power to appoint and dismiss his chiefs (Buganda government officials) instead of acting as a mere figurehead while they conducted the affairs of government.

The Kabaka&#x27;s new power was cloaked in the misleading claim that he would be only a &quot;constitutional monarch&quot;, while in fact he was a leading player in deciding how Uganda would be governed. A new grouping of Baganda calling themselves &quot;the King&#x27;s Friends&quot; rallied to the Kabaka&#x27;s defence. They were conservative, fiercely loyal to Buganda as a kingdom, and willing to entertain the prospect of participation in an independent Uganda only if it were headed by the Kabaka as head of state. Baganda politicians who did not share this vision or who were opposed to the &quot;King&#x27;s Friends&quot; found themselves branded as the &quot;King&#x27;s Enemies&quot;, which meant political and social ostracism.

The major exception to this rule were the Roman Catholic Baganda who had formed their own party, the Democratic Party (DP), led by Benedicto Kiwanuka. Many Catholics had felt excluded from the Protestant-dominated establishment in Buganda ever since Lugard&#x27;s Maxim had turned the tide in 1892. The Kabaka had to be Protestant, and he was invested in a coronation ceremony modelled on that of British monarchs (who are invested by the Church of England&#x27;s Archbishop of Canterbury) that took place at the main Protestant church. Religion and politics were equally inseparable in the other kingdoms throughout Uganda. The DP had Catholic as well as other adherents and was probably the best organized of all the parties preparing for elections. It had printing presses and the backing of the popular newspaper, Munno, which was published at the St. Mary&#x27;s Kisubi mission.

Elsewhere in Uganda, the emergence of the Kabaka as a political force provoked immediate hostility. Political parties and local interest groups were riddled with divisions and rivalries, but they shared one concern: they were determined not to be dominated by Buganda. In 1960 a political organizer from Lango, Milton Obote, seized the initiative and formed a new party, the Uganda People&#x27;s Congress (UPC), as a coalition of all those outside the Roman Catholic-dominated DP who opposed Buganda hegemony.

The steps Cohen had initiated to bring about the independence of a unified Ugandan state had led to a polarization between factions from Buganda and those opposed to its domination. Buganda&#x27;s population in 1959 was 2 million, out of Uganda&#x27;s total of 6 million. Even discounting the many non-Baganda resident in Buganda, there were at least 1 million people who owed allegiance to the Kabaka — too many to be overlooked or shunted aside, but too few to dominate the country as a whole.

At the London Conference of 1960, it was obvious that Buganda autonomy and a strong unitary government were incompatible, but no compromise emerged, and the decision on the form of government was postponed. The British announced that elections would be held in March 1961 for &quot;responsible government&quot;, the next-to-last stage of preparation before the formal granting of independence. It was assumed that those winning the election would gain valuable experience in office, preparing them for the probable responsibility of governing after independence.

In Buganda the &quot;King&#x27;s Friends&quot; urged a total boycott of the election because their attempts to secure promises of future autonomy had been rebuffed. Consequently, when the voters went to the polls throughout Uganda to elect eighty-two National Assembly members, in Buganda only the Roman Catholic supporters of the DP braved severe public pressure and voted, capturing twenty of Buganda&#x27;s twenty-one allotted seats. This artificial situation gave the DP a majority of seats, although they had a minority of 416,000 votes nationwide versus 495,000 for the UPC. Benedicto Kiwanuka became the new chief minister of Uganda.

Shocked by the results, the Baganda separatists, who formed a political party called Kabaka Yekka, had second thoughts about the wisdom of their election boycott. They quickly welcomed the recommendations of a British commission that proposed a future federal form of government. According to these recommendations, Buganda would enjoy a measure of internal autonomy if it participated fully in the national government.

For its part, the UPC was equally anxious to eject its DP rivals from government before they became entrenched. Obote reached an understanding with Kabaka Freddie and the KY, accepting Buganda&#x27;s special federal relationship and even a provision by which the kabaka could appoint Buganda&#x27;s representatives to the National Assembly, in return for a strategic alliance to defeat the DP. The Kabaka was also promised the largely ceremonial position of Head of state of Uganda, which was of great symbolic importance to the Baganda.

This marriage of convenience between the UPC and the KY made inevitable the defeat of the DP interim administration. In the aftermath of the April 1962 final election leading up to independence, Uganda&#x27;s national assembly consisted of forty-three UPC members, twenty-four KY members, and twenty-four DP members. The new UPC-KY coalition led Uganda into independence in October 1962, with Obote as Prime Minister of Uganda, and the Kabaka becoming President of Uganda a year later.

<text>The history of Uganda from 1963 through 1971 comprises the history of Uganda from Ugandan independence from the United Kingdom to the rise of the dictator Idi Amin.

The Ugandan state was officially named the Sovereign State of Uganda between 1963 and 1967, before becoming the Republic of Uganda upon the enactment of the 1967 constitution which ended the previous system of a republican elective monarchy wherein the President was elected by parliament from among the 5 subnational monarchs.

Early independent Uganda during this period was dominated by the regime of Milton Obote, Uganda&#x27;s first Prime Minister and subsequently President, who after being deposed by Amin returned to power in the 1980s.

==Move to independence==
Uganda&#x27;s approach to independence was unlike that of most other colonial territories where political parties had been organized to force self-rule or independence from a reluctant colonial government. In Uganda there had been some demands for greater autonomy, but these were mostly expressed by local nationalisms surrounding the five constituent kingdoms of the colony. One exception was the long-lived Uganda National Congress, based on the Congress Party of India.

Uganda was greatly divided along national, religious, and ethnic lines. The national divisions were the most apparent. The country was dominated by Buganda, much to the annoyance of the other four kingdoms. The kingdom of Bunyoro felt especially aggrieved having been deprived of its &quot;lost counties&quot; when Uganda became a British protectorate.

Deep religious divisions had developed. The British-linked and British-supported elite had largely converted to Protestantism. The majority of the population were Catholic and they were excluded from power by the Protestants. Uganda also had a significant Muslim population that were excluded from power as well. Ethnic divisions were just as important. Under the British, Uganda&#x27;s economic activity was mostly undertaken by a large group of Indian immigrants who operated many of the businesses and constituted the majority of the colony&#x27;s merchants. Moreover, there was a long-standing divide between the Nilotics of the north and the Bantu of the south of the country.

Upon independence three parties developed. The Democratic Party (DP), modelled on Germany&#x27;s Christian Democrats, represented the Catholic population. The Uganda People&#x27;s Congress (UPC) was supported mainly by groups from the north and western parts. The Kabaka Yekka (KY) (meaning &quot;king only&quot;) was a Bugandan nationalist party. In the pre-independence period the Democratic Party, surprisingly, won the most seats, but not a majority. In the elections of 1962, in preparation for Independence, the UPC and KY united and excluded the DP. Milton Obote, the leader of the Uganda People&#x27;s Congress, became the nation&#x27;s first Prime Minister.

==UPC-KY coalition rule (1962–1964)==
The Uganda People&#x27;s Congress had several obstacles to forming a government. The party leadership was fragmented. Each party functionary represented a local constituency, and most of the constituencies were ethnically distinct. For example, Milton Obote&#x27;s strength lay among his Langi kin in northern Uganda; George Magezi represented the local interests of his Bunyoro compatriots; Grace S.K. Ibingira&#x27;s strength was in the Ankole; and Felix Onama was the northern leader of the largely neglected West Nile District in the north-west corner of Uganda. Each of these regional political bosses and those from the other Uganda regions expected to receive a ministerial post in the new Uganda government, to exercise patronage, and to bring the material fruits of independence to local supporters. Failing these objectives, each was likely either to withdraw from the UPC coalition or realign within it.

The UPC had had no effective urban organization before independence, although it was able to mobilize the trade unions, most of which were led by non-Ugandan immigrant workers from Kenya (a situation which contributed to the independent Uganda government&#x27;s almost immediate hostility toward the trade unions). No common ideology united the UPC, the composition of which ranged from the near reactionary Onama to the radical John Kakonge, leader of the UPC Youth League. As prime minister, Obote was responsible for keeping this loose coalition of divergent interest groups intact.

Obote also faced the task of maintaining the UPC&#x27;s external alliances, primarily the coalition between the UPC and the kabaka, who led Buganda&#x27;s KY. Obote proved adept at meeting the diverse demands of his many partners in government. He even temporarily acceded to some demands which he found repugnant, such as Buganda&#x27;s claim for special treatment. This accession led to demands by other kingdoms for similar recognition. The Busoga chiefdoms banded together to claim that they, too, deserved recognition under the rule of their newly defined monarch, the &quot;kyabasinga&quot;. Not to be outdone, the Iteso people, who had never recognized a precolonial king, claimed the title &quot;kingoo&quot; for Teso District&#x27;s political boss, Cuthbert Joseph Obwangor. Despite these separatist pressures, Obote&#x27;s long-term goal was to build a strong central government at the expense of entrenched local interests, especially those of Buganda.

The first major challenge to the Obote government came not from the kingdoms, nor the regional interests, but from the military. In January 1964, units of the Ugandan Army mutinied, demanding higher pay and more rapid promotions. Minister of Defense Onama, who courageously went to speak to the mutineers, was seized and held hostage. Obote was forced to call in British troops to restore order, a humiliating blow to the new regime. In the aftermath, Obote&#x27;s government acceded to all the mutineers&#x27; demands, unlike the governments of Kenya and Tanganyika, which responded to similar demands with increased discipline and tighter control over their small military forces.

The military then began to assume a more prominent role in Ugandan life. Obote selected a popular junior officer with minimal education, Idi Amin Dada, and promoted him rapidly through the ranks as a personal protégé. As the army expanded, it became a source of political patronage and of potential political power.

== Breakup of the coalition (1964) ==
Later in 1964, Obote felt strong enough to address the critical issue of the &quot;lost counties&quot; which the British had postponed until after independence. The combination of patronage offers and the promise of future rewards within the ruling coalition gradually thinned opposition party ranks, as members of parliament crossed the floor to join the government benches. After two years of independence, Obote finally acquired enough votes to give the UPC a majority and free himself of the KY coalition. The turning point came when several DP members of parliament from Bunyoro agreed to join the government side if Obote would undertake a popular referendum to restore the &quot;lost counties&quot; to Bunyoro. The kabaka, naturally, opposed the plebiscite. Unable to prevent it, he sent 300 armed Baganda veterans to the area to intimidate Banyoro voters. In turn, 2,000 veterans from Bunyoro massed on the frontier. Civil war was averted, and the referendum was held. The vote demonstrated an overwhelming desire by residents in the counties annexed to Buganda in 1900 to be restored to their historic Bunyoro allegiance, which was duly enacted by the new UPC majority despite KY opposition.

This triumph for Obote and the UPC strengthened the central government and threw Buganda into disarray. KY unity was weakened by internal recriminations, after which some KY stalwarts, too, began to &quot;cross the floor&quot; to join Obote&#x27;s victorious government. By early 1966, the result was a parliament composed of seventy-four UPC, nine DP, eight KY, and one independent MP. The Obote regime was to become associated with food shortage, corruption, and the terrorizing, harassing, and torturing of Ugandans, particularly Indian traders.

== UPC multi-party rule (1964–1966)==
As the perceived threat from Buganda diminished, many non-Baganda alliances weakened. And as the possibility of an opposition DP victory faded, the UPC coalition itself began to come apart. The one-party state did not signal the end of political conflict; it merely relocated and intensified that conflict within the party. The issue that brought the UPC disharmony to a crisis involved Obote&#x27;s military protégé, Idi Amin.

In 1966 Amin caused a commotion when he walked into a Kampala bank with a gold bar (bearing the stamp of the government of the Belgian Congo) and asked the bank manager to exchange it for cash. Amin&#x27;s account was ultimately credited with a deposit of £17,000. Obote rivals questioned the incident, and it emerged that the prime minister and a handful of close associates had used Colonel Amin and units of the Uganda Army to intervene in the neighbouring Congo Crisis. Former supporters of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba, led by a &quot;General Olenga,&quot; opposed the American-backed government and were attempting to lead the Eastern Province into secession. These troops were reported to be trading looted ivory and gold for arms supplies secretly smuggled to them by Amin. The arrangement became public when Olenga later claimed that he failed to receive the promised munitions. This claim appeared to be supported by the fact that in mid-1965, a seventy-five-ton shipment of Chinese weapons was intercepted by the Kenyan government as it was being moved from Tanzania to Uganda.

Obote&#x27;s rivals for leadership within the UPC, supported by some Baganda politicians and others who were hostile to Obote, used the evidence revealed by Amin&#x27;s casual bank deposit to claim that the prime minister and his closest associates were corrupt and had conducted secret foreign policy for personal gain, in the amount of £25,000 each. Obote denied the charge and said the money had been spent to buy the munitions for Olenga&#x27;s Congolese troops. On 4 February 1966, while Obote was away on a trip to the north of the country, an effective &quot;no confidence&quot; vote against Obote was passed by the UPC Mps. This attempt to remove Obote appeared to be organized by UPC Secretary General Grace S.K. Ibingira, closely supported by the UPC leader from Bunyoro, George Magezi, and a number of other southern UPC notables. Only the radical UPC member, John Kakonge, voted against the motion.

Because he was faced with a nearly unanimous disavowal by his governing party and national parliament, many people expected Obote to resign. Instead, Obote turned to Idi Amin and the army, and, in effect, carried out a coup d&#x27;état against his own government in order to stay in power. Obote suspended the constitution, arrested the offending UPC ministers, and assumed control of the state. He forced a new constitution through parliament without a reading and without the necessary quorum. That constitution abolished the federal powers of the kingdoms, most notably the internal autonomy enjoyed by Buganda, and concentrated presidential powers in the prime minister&#x27;s office. The kabaka objected, and Buganda prepared to wage a legal battle. Baganda leaders rhetorically demanded that Obote&#x27;s &quot;illegal&quot; government remove itself from Buganda soil.

Buganda, however, once again miscalculated, for Obote was not interested in negotiating. Instead, he sent Idi Amin and loyal troops to attack the kabaka&#x27;s palace on nearby Mengo Hill. The palace was defended by a small group of bodyguards armed with rifles and shotguns. Amin&#x27;s troops had heavy weapons but were reluctant to press the attack until Obote became impatient and demanded results. By the time the Battle of Mengo Hill resulted in the palace being overrun, the kabaka had taken advantage of a cloudburst to exit over the rear wall. He hailed a passing taxi and was driven off to exile. After the assault, Obote was reasonably secure from open opposition. The new republican 1967 constitution abolished the kingdoms altogether. Buganda was divided into four districts and ruled through martial law, a forerunner of the military domination over the civilian population that all of Uganda would experience after 1971.

== UPC one-party rule (1966–1971) ==
Obote&#x27;s success in the face of adversity reclaimed for him the support of most members of the UPC, which then became the only legal political party. The original independence election of 1962, therefore, was the last one held in Uganda until December 1980. On the home front, Obote issued the &quot;Common Man&#x27;s Charter,&quot; echoed the call for African socialism by Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, and proclaimed a &quot;move to the left&quot; to signal new efforts to consolidate power. His critics noted that he placed most control over economic nationalization in the hands of an Asian millionaire who was also a financial backer of the UPC. Obote created a system of secret police, the General Service Unit (GSU). Headed by a relative, Akena Adoko, the GSU reported on suspected subversives. The Special Force Units of paramilitary police, heavily recruited from Obote&#x27;s own region and ethnic group, supplemented the security forces within the army and police.

Although Buganda had been defeated and occupied by the military, Obote was still concerned about security there. His concerns were well founded; in December 1969 he was wounded in an assassination attempt and narrowly escaped more serious injury when a grenade thrown near him failed to explode. He had retained power by relying on Idi Amin and the army, but it was not clear that he could continue to count on their loyalty.

==Rivalry with Idi Amin==
Obote appeared particularly uncertain of the army after Amin&#x27;s sole rival among senior army officers, Brigadier Acap Okoya, was murdered early in 1970. (Amin later promoted the man rumored to have recruited Okoya&#x27;s killers.) A second attempt was made on Obote&#x27;s life when his motorcade was ambushed later that year, but the vice-president&#x27;s car was mistakenly riddled with bullets. Obote began to recruit more Acholi and Langi troops, and he accelerated their promotions to counter the large numbers of soldiers from Amin&#x27;s home, which was then known as West Nile District. Obote also enlarged the paramilitary Special Force as a counterweight to the army.

Amin, who at times inspected his troops wearing an outsized sport shirt with Obote&#x27;s face across the front and back, protested his loyalty. But in October 1970, Amin was placed under temporary house arrest while investigators looked into his army expenditures, reportedly several million dollars over budget. Another charge against Amin was that he had continued to aid southern Sudan&#x27;s Anyanya rebels in opposing the regime of Gaafar Nimeiry even after Obote had shifted his support away from the Anyanya to Nimeiry. This foreign policy shift provoked an outcry from Israel, which had been supplying the Anyanya rebels. Amin was close friends with several Israeli military advisers who were in Uganda to help train the Ugandan Army, and their eventual role in Amin&#x27;s efforts to oust Obote remained the subject of continuing controversy.

<doc id="413452" wikidata="Q5866990" url="?curid=413452" title="Second Republic of Uganda">
<text>The Second Republic of Uganda existed from 1971 to 1979, when Uganda was ruled by Idi Amin&#x27;s military dictatorship.
Amin&#x27;s rule formally came to an end with the Uganda-Tanzania War, which ended with Tanzania occupying Uganda and Amin fleeing into exile.

The Ugandan economy was devastated by Idi Amin&#x27;s policies, including the expulsion of Asians, the nationalisation of businesses and industry, and the expansion of the public sector. The real value of salaries and wages collapsed by 90% in less than a decade. The number of people killed as a result of his regime is unknown; estimates from international observers and human rights groups range from 100,000 to 500,000.

==Taking power==
From Uganda&#x27;s independence from Great Britain in 1962 to early 1971, Milton Obote&#x27;s regime had terrorized, harassed, and tortured people. Frequent food shortages led to food prices experiencing hyper-inflation, with one contributing factor being Obote&#x27;s persecution of Indian traders. During Obote&#x27;s regime, flagrant and widespread corruption had emerged. The regime was disliked, particularly in Buganda where people had suffered the most.

By January 1971, Milton Obote, then President of Uganda, was prepared to rid himself of the potential threat posed by Idi Amin. Departing for the 1971 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at Singapore, he relayed orders to loyal Langi officers that Amin and his supporters in the army were to be arrested. Various versions emerged of the way this news was leaked to Amin. Also, the role of the foreign powers in the coup had been debated after the fact. Documents declassified by the British Foreign Office reveal that, contrary to earlier speculations, it was not directly facilitated by Great Britain but benefited from covert support by Israel which saw Idi Amin as an agent to de-stabilise Islamic Sudan.
The documents however unveil an outrightly positive assessment of Amin&#x27;s personality by the British authorities as well as recommendations of support and the sale of arms to the new regime.

In any case, Amin decided to forestall Obote and strike first. In the early morning hours of 25 January 1971, mechanized army units loyal to him attacked strategic targets in Kampala and the airport at Entebbe, where the first shell fired by a pro-Amin tank commander killed two Roman Catholic priests in the airport waiting room. Amin&#x27;s troops easily overcame the disorganized opposition to the coup, and Amin almost immediately initiated mass executions of Acholi and Langi troops, whom he believed to be pro-Obote.

The Amin coup was warmly welcomed by most of the people of the Buganda kingdom, which Obote had attempted to dismantle. They seemed willing to forget that their new president, Idi Amin, had been the tool of that military suppression. Amin stated intentions about his government&#x27;s intent to play a mere &quot;caretaker role&quot; until the country could recover sufficiently for civilian rule. Amin repudiated Obote&#x27;s non-aligned foreign policy, and his government was quickly recognized by Israel, Britain, and the United States. By contrast, presidents Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya, and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) initially refused to accept the legitimacy of the new military government. Nyerere, in particular, opposed Amin&#x27;s regime, and he offered hospitality to the exiled Obote, facilitating his attempts to raise a force and return to power.

==Once in power==

Amin&#x27;s military experience, which was virtually his only experience, determined the character of his rule. He renamed Government House &quot;the Command Post&quot;, instituted an advisory defence council composed of military commanders, placed military tribunals above the system of civil law, appointed soldiers to top government posts and parastatal agencies, and even informed the newly inducted civilian cabinet ministers that they would be subject to military discipline.

Uganda then became a military dictatorship which was, in effect, governed from a collection of military barracks scattered across the country, where battalion commanders, acting like local warlords, represented the coercive arm of the government. The Ugandan General Service Unit (GSU), an intelligence agency created by the previous government, was disbanded and replaced by the Ugandan State Research Bureau (SRB). SRB headquarters at Nakasero became the scene of torture and executions over the next couple of years.

Despite its outward display of a military chain of command, Amin&#x27;s government was arguably more consumed with rivalries, regional divisions, and ethnic politics than the Uganda People&#x27;s Congress (UPC) coalition that it had replaced. The army itself was an arena of lethal competition, in which losers were usually eliminated. Within the officer corps, those trained in Britain opposed those trained in Israel, and both stood against the untrained, who soon eliminated many of the army&#x27;s most experienced officers. In 1966, well before the Amin era, northerners in the army had assaulted and harassed soldiers from the south. In 1971 and 1972, the Lugbara and Kakwa (Amin&#x27;s ethnic group) from the West Nile were slaughtering northern Acholi and Langi, who were identified with Obote. Then the Kakwa fought the Lugbara. Amin came to rely on Nubians and on former Anyanya rebels from southern Sudan.

Amin recruited his followers from his own tribe, the Kakwas, along with Sudanese and Nubians. By 1977, these three groups formed 60% of the 22 top generals and 75% of the cabinet. Similarly, Muslims formed 80% and 87.5% of these groups even though they were only 5% of the population. This helps explain why Amin survived eight attempted coups.

The Ugandan army grew from 10,000 to over 25,000 by 1978. Amin&#x27;s army was largely a mercenary force. Half the soldiers were Sudanese, 26% Congolese, only 24% were Ugandan, mostly Muslim and Kakwa.

On 7 August 1973, Idi Amin decreed Swahili was to be Uganda&#x27;s official language. 12 out of the 20 districts had chosen this, the other 8 wanted Luganda.

The army, which had been progressively expanded under Obote, was further doubled and redoubled under Amin. Recruitment was largely, but not entirely, in the north. There were periodic purges, when various battalion commanders were viewed as potential problems or became real threats. Each purge provided new opportunities for promotions from the ranks. The commander of the Uganda Air Force, Smuts Guweddeko, had previously worked as a telephone operator; the unofficial executioner for the regime, Major Isaac Maliyamungu, had formerly been a nightwatch officer. By the mid-1970s, only the most trustworthy military units were allowed ammunition, although this prohibition did not prevent a series of mutinies and murders. An attempt by an American journalist, Nicholas Stroh, and his colleague, Robert Siedle, to investigate one of these barracks outbreaks in 1971 at the Simba battalion in Mbarara led to their disappearances and, later, deaths. Several army officers who were suspected of having been involved in the murder of Stroh and Siedle were later appointed to high-ranking positions: Among these were Military Tribunal chairman Juma Butabika, chief technical officer of the airforce Captain Taban, Minister of Transport Juma Sabuni, and Minister for Provincial Administration Ali Fadhul.

===Muammar Gaddafi and the Soviet Union===

During his eight years as Uganda&#x27;s ruler, Amin never forgot the source of his power. He spent much of his time rewarding, promoting, and manipulating the officers and soldiers of the Ugandan army. Financing his ever-increasing military expenditures was a continuing concern. Early in 1972, he reversed foreign policy — never a major issue for Amin — to secure financial and military aid from Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. Amin expelled the remaining Israeli advisers, to whom he was much indebted, and became anti-Israel. To induce foreign aid from Saudi Arabia, he rediscovered his previously neglected Islamic heritage. He also commissioned the construction of a great mosque on Kampala Hill in the capital city, but it was never completed during his rule because much of the money intended for it was embezzled. In 2008 Amin&#x27;s dream of building one of Africa&#x27;s largest mosques came true, and construction was finally completed more than 30 years after it initially began.

Following his foreign policy reversal in 1972, the Soviet Union became Amin&#x27;s largest arms supplier.

East Germany helped to build Amin&#x27;s secret police. During the Tanzanian invasion in 1979, East Germany attempted to remove evidence about its involvement.

===Expulsion of Asians and nationalisations===

In August 1972, Amin gave most of Uganda&#x27;s 80,000 Asians, most of whom were the descendants of indentured servants and other laborers from India, 90 days to leave the country, and seized their property, homes and businesses. At the time of the expulsion, there were approximately 80,000 individuals of South Asian descent in Uganda, of whom 23,000 had had their applications for citizenship both processed and accepted. Although the latter were ultimately exempted from the expulsion, many chose to leave voluntarily. The expulsion took place against a backdrop of Indophobia in Uganda, with Amin accusing a minority of the Asian population of disloyalty, non-integration and commercial malpractice, claims Indian leaders disputed. Amin defended the expulsion by arguing that he was giving Uganda back to the ethnic Ugandan.

Many of the expellees were citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies and 27,200 subsequently emigrated to the United Kingdom. Of the other refugees who were accounted for, 6,000 went to Canada, 4,500 refugees ended up in India and 2,500 went to nearby Kenya. In total, some 5,655 firms, ranches, farms, and agricultural estates were reallocated, along with cars, homes and other household goods. Although Amin proclaimed that the &quot;common man&quot; was the beneficiary of this drastic act — which proved immensely popular in Uganda and most of Africa — it was actually the Ugandan army that emerged with the houses, cars, and businesses of the departing Asian minority. This expropriation of foreign property proved disastrous for the already declining economy. With the economy now run by Ugandan army officers and supporters (many of whom had no experience in how to run a business), all of the local businesses and stores were soon run into the ground from a combination of mismanagement and abuse of power, cement factories at Tororo and Fort Portal collapsed from lack of maintenance and neglect, and sugar production all over the country gradually ground to a halt as unmaintained machinery jammed permanently.

Uganda&#x27;s export crops were sold by government parastatals, but most of the foreign currency they earned went for purchasing weapons and imports for the army. The most famous example of this was the so-called &quot;whisky runs&quot; to Stansted Airport in England during the early years of Amin&#x27;s rule. Ugandan army transport planes flew thousands of miles to England where they were loaded with crates of expensive Scotch whisky, transistor radios, gold Rolex wristwatches, and other luxury items that were purchased for Amin and flown back to Uganda where they were distributed among Ugandan army officers and soldiers. Amin later justified his rewarding and doting on the Ugandan army by quoting an old African proverb, which summed up to Amin&#x27;s treatment of his army: &quot;A dog with a bone in its mouth can&#x27;t bite.&quot;

With the Ugandan economy faltering, the rural African producers and farmers, particularly of coffee, turned to smuggling, especially to Kenya. The smuggling problem became an obsession with Amin; toward the end of his rule, he appointed his mercenary and political adviser, the former British citizen Bob Astles, to take all necessary steps to eliminate the problem. These steps included orders to the Ugandan police and army to shoot smugglers on sight.

===Terror===

Another near-obsession for Amin was the threat of a counter-attack by former president Obote. Shortly after the expulsion of Asians in 1972, Obote did launch such an attempt across the Tanzanian border into south-western Uganda. His small army contingent in twenty-seven trucks set out to capture the southern Ugandan military post at Masaka but instead settled down to await a general uprising against Amin, which did not occur. A planned seizure of the airport at Entebbe by soldiers in an allegedly hijacked East African Airways passenger aircraft was aborted when Obote&#x27;s pilot blew out the aircraft&#x27;s tires and it remained in Tanzania. Amin was able to mobilize his more reliable Malire Mechanical Regiment and expel the invaders.

Although jubilant at his success, Amin realized that Obote, with Nyerere&#x27;s aid, might try again. He had the SRB and the newly formed Public Safety Unit (PSU) redouble their efforts to uncover subversives and other imagined enemies of the state. General fear and insecurity became a way of life for the populace, as thousands of people disappeared. In an ominous twist, people sometimes learned by listening to the radio that they were &quot;about to disappear.&quot;

State terrorism was evidenced in a series of spectacular incidents; for example, High Court Judge Benedicto Kiwanuka, former head of government and leader of the banned DP, was seized directly from his courtroom. Like many other victims, he was forced to remove his shoes and then bundled into the trunk of a car, never to be seen alive again. Whether calculated or not, the symbolism of a pair of shoes by the roadside to mark the passing of a human life was a bizarre yet piercing form of state terrorism.

===Environment===
During the eight years under Amin&#x27;s rule, the Ugandan environment and ecological system was subjected to abuse and destruction by widespread poaching and deforesting committed by both smugglers and Uganda Army soldiers. Amin encouraged officers to engage in poaching and ivory trade, using these as benefits provided to troops in order to keep them loyal. Soldiers frequently engaged in poaching in national parks and game reserves. In course of the Uganda–Tanzania War, Uganda Army troops and Tanzanian soldiers hunted for food and profit across Uganda, causing further environmental damage. It is reported that Uganda lost 75% of its elephants, 98% of its rhinos, 80% of its crocodiles, 80% of its lions and leopards, in addition to numerous species of birds.

===Palestinian hijackers of Air France Flight 139===

Amin attempted to establish ties with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations in June 1976, when he offered the Palestinian hijackers of an Air France flight from Tel Aviv a protected base at the old airport at Entebbe, from which to press their demands in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages. The dramatic rescue of the hostages by Israeli commandos was a severe blow to Amin. Humiliated, he retaliated against an elderly hostage—75-year-old Dora Bloch— who was hospitalized in poor health at the time of the raid and was left behind. Bloch was kidnapped from her hospital bed and killed on Amin&#x27;s orders, along with the entire civilian staff of Entebbe airport.

===Government===

Amin&#x27;s government, conducted by often erratic personal proclamation, continued on. Because he was illiterate his entire life — a disability shared with most of his fellow military officers and soldiers — Amin relayed orders and policy decisions orally by telephone, over the radio, and in long rambling speeches to which civil servants were told to pay close attention. The bureaucracy soon became paralysed as government administrators feared to make what might prove to be a wrong decision that would displease or anger Amin in the slightest which would result in their immediate arrest and imprisonment or summary execution.

Shortly after Amin seized power, the Minister of Defence demanded, and was given, command of the Ministry of Education office building, but then the decision was reversed by Amin for no clear reason. Important education files were lost during their transfer back and forth by wheelbarrow. In many respects, Amin&#x27;s government in the 1970s resembled the governments of nineteenth-century African monarchs, with the same problems of enforcing orders at a distance, controlling rival factions at court, and rewarding loyal followers with plunder. Indeed, Amin&#x27;s regime was possibly less efficient than those of the pre-colonial monarchs.

Religious conflict was another characteristic of the Amin regime that had its origins in the nineteenth century. After rediscovering his Islamic allegiance in the effort to gain foreign aid from Libya and Saudi Arabia, Amin began to pay more attention to the formerly deprived Muslims in Uganda, a move which turned out to be a mixed blessing for them. Muslims began to do well in what economic opportunities yet remained, the more so if they had relatives in the army. Construction work began on Kibuli Hill, the site of Kampala&#x27;s most prominent mosque. Many Ugandan Muslims with a sense of history believed that the Muslim defeat by Christians in 1889 was finally being redressed. Christians, in turn, perceived that they were under siege as a religious group; it was clear that Amin viewed the churches as potential centres of opposition. A number of priests and ministers disappeared in the course of the 1970s, but the matter reached a climax with the formal protest against army terrorism in 1977 by Church of Uganda ministers, led by Archbishop Janani Luwum. Although Luwum&#x27;s body was subsequently recovered from a clumsily contrived &quot;car accident&quot;, subsequent investigations revealed that Luwum had been shot dead.

This latest in a long line of atrocities was greeted with international condemnation, but apart from the continued trade boycott initiated by the United States in July 1978, verbal condemnation was not accompanied by action. In September 1978, Amin banned nearly all Christian Church activities for their subversiveness. By early 1978 Amin&#x27;s circle of close associates had shrunk significantly — the result of defections and executions. Because of his violent temper as well as his erratic and unpredictable behaviour, it was increasingly risky to be too close to Amin, as his vice president and formerly trusted associate, General Mustafa Adrisi, discovered. When Adrisi was injured in a suspicious auto accident, troops loyal to him became restive. The once reliable Malire Mechanized Regiment mutinied, as did other units.

In October 1978, Amin sent troops still loyal to him against the mutineers, some of whom fled across the Tanzanian border. Amin then claimed that Tanzanian President Nyerere, his perennial enemy, had been at the root of his troubles. Amin accused Nyerere of waging war against Uganda, and, hoping to divert attention from his internal troubles and rally Uganda against the foreign adversary, Amin invaded Tanzanian territory and formally annexed a section across the Kagera River boundary on 1 November 1978.

===Uganda–Tanzania War===

Declaring a formal state of war against Uganda, Nyerere mobilized his citizen army reserves and counter-attacked, joined by Ugandan exiles united as the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). The Ugandan Army retreated steadily, expending much of its energy by looting along the way. Libya&#x27;s Gaddafi sent 3,000 troops to aid Amin, but the Libyans soon found themselves on the front line, while behind them Ugandan Army units were using supply trucks to carry their newly plundered wealth in the opposite direction. Tanzania and the UNLA took Kampala on 11 April 1979, and Amin fled by air, first to Libya and later to a permanent exile at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Though pro-Amin forces were left scattered and disjointed by the seizure of the capital, combat operations in the country continued until 3 June, when Tanzanian forces reached the Sudanese border and eliminated the last resistance.

<text>The History of Uganda from 1979 to 1986 comprises the history of Uganda since the end of the dictatorship of Idi Amin. This period has seen the second rule of Milton Obote and the presidency of Yoweri Museveni since 1986, in which Ugandan politics have been dominated by the National Resistance Movement.

==Uganda after Amin (1979–1986)==

===Interim period===
A month before the capture of Kampala during the Uganda-Tanzania War, representatives of twenty-two Ugandan civilian and military groups were hastily called together at Moshi, Tanzania, to try to agree on an interim civilian government once Amin was removed. Called the Unity Conference in the hope that unity might prevail, it managed to establish the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF) as political representative of the UNLA. Yusuf Lule, former principal of Makerere University, became head of the UNLF executive committee.

As an academic rather than a politician, Lule was not regarded as a threat to any of the contending factions. Shortly after Amin&#x27;s departure, Lule and the UNLF moved to Kampala, where they established an interim government. Lule became president, advised by a temporary parliament, the National Consultative Council (NCC). The NCC, in turn, was composed of representatives from the Unity Conference.

Conflict surfaced immediately between Lule and some of the more radical of the council members who saw him as too conservative, too autocratic, and too willing as a Muganda to listen to advice from other Baganda. After only three months, with the apparent approval of Julius Nyerere, whose troops still controlled Kampala, Lule was forcibly removed from office and exiled. He was replaced by Godfrey Binaisa, a Muganda like Lule, but one who had previously served as a high-ranking member of Milton Obote&#x27;s UPC.

It was not an auspicious start to the rebuilding of a new Uganda, which required political and economic stability. Indeed, the quarrels within the NCC, which Binaisa enlarged to 127 members, revealed that many rival and would-be politicians who had returned from exile were resuming their self-interested operating styles. Ugandans who endured the deprivations of the Amin era became even more disillusioned with their leaders. Binaisa managed to stay in office longer than Lule, but his inability to gain control over a burgeoning new military presence proved to be his downfall.

The armed forces numbered fewer than 1,000 troops who had fought alongside the Tanzania People&#x27;s Defence Force (TPDF) to expel Amin. The army had shrunk to the size of the original King&#x27;s African Rifles at independence in 1962. But in 1979, in an attempt to consolidate support for the future, leaders such as Yoweri Kaguta Museveni and Major General (later Chief of Staff) David Oyite Ojok began to enrol thousands of recruits grew to 8,000; Ojok&#x27;s original 600 became 24,000. When Binaisa sought to curb the use of these militias, which were harassing and detaining political opponents, he was overthrown in a military coup on 10 May 1980.

The coup was engineered by Ojok, Museveni, and others acting under the general direction of Paulo Muwanga, Obote&#x27;s right-hand man and chair of the Military Commission. The TPDF was still providing necessary security while Uganda&#x27;s police force, which had been all but destroyed by Amin, was rebuilt, but Nyerere refused to help Binaisa retain power. Many Ugandans claimed that although Nyerere did not impose his own choice on Uganda, he indirectly facilitated the return to power of his old friend and ally, Milton Obote. In any case, the Military Commission headed by Muwanga effectively governed Uganda during the six months leading up to the national elections of December 1980.

Further evidence of the militarization of Ugandan politics was provided by the proposed expenditures of the newly empowered Military Commission. Security and defense were to be allotted more than 30 percent of the national revenues. For a country desperately seeking funds for economic recovery from the excesses of the previous military regime, this allocation seemed unreasonable to civilian leaders.

Shortly after Muwanga&#x27;s 1980 coup, Obote made a triumphant return from Tanzania. In the months before the December elections, he began to rally his former UPC supporters. Ominously, in view of recent Ugandan history, he often appeared on the platform with General Oyite-Ojok, a fellow Lango. Obote also began to speak of the need to return to a UPC one-party state.

The national election on 10 December 1980 was a crucial turning point for Uganda. It was, after all, the first election in eighteen years. Several parties contested, the most important of which were Obote&#x27;s UPC and the DP led by Paul Kawanga Ssemogerere. Most of Uganda&#x27;s Roman Catholics were DP members, along with many others whose main concern was to prevent the return of another Obote regime. Because the Military Commission, as the acting government, was dominated by Obote supporters (notably chairman Paulo Muwanga), the DP and other contenders faced formidable obstacles. By election day, the UPC had achieved some exceptional advantages, summarized by Minority Rights Group Report Number 66 as follows: Seventeen UPC candidates were declared &quot;unopposed&quot; by the simple procedure of not allowing DP or other candidates to run against them.

Fourteen district commissioners, who were expected to supervise local polling, were replaced with UPC nominees. The chief justice of Uganda, to whom complaints of election irregularities would have to be made, was replaced with a UPC member. In a number of districts, non-UPC candidates were arrested, and one was murdered. Even before the election, the government press and Radio Uganda appeared to treat the UPC as the victor. Muwanga insisted that each party have a separate ballot box on election day, thus negating the right of secret ballot. There were a number of other moves to aid the UPC, including Muwanga&#x27;s statement that the future parliament would also contain an unspecified number of unelected representatives of the army and other interest groups.

Polling appeared to be heavy on election day, and by the end of the voting, the DP, on the basis of its own estimates, declared victory in 81 of 126 constituencies. The British Broadcasting Corporation and Voice of America broadcast the news of the DP triumph, and Kampala&#x27;s streets were filled with DP celebrants. At this point, Muwanga seized control of the Electoral Commission, along with the power to count the ballots, and declared that anyone disputing his count would be subject to a heavy fine and five years in jail. Eighteen hours later, Muwanga announced a UPC victory, with 72 seats. Some DP candidates claimed the ballot boxes were simply switched to give their own vote tally to the UPC runner-up.

Nevertheless, a small contingent of neutral election watchers, the Commonwealth Observer Group, declared itself satisfied with the validity of the election. Some Ugandans criticized the Commonwealth Observer Group, suggesting that members of the group measured African elections by different standards than those used elsewhere or that they feared civil war if the results were questioned. Indeed, popular perception of a stolen election actually helped bring about the civil war the Commonwealth Observer Group may have feared.

==Three-months World Bank delegation to devastated Uganda==
Due to their years working for the government before Idi Amin, and both speaking Swahili, David Hines (who in 1959 to 1965 had established Uganda farming co-operatives with some 400,000 farmers), and a British veterinary specialist were surprised to be telephoned by the World Bank to join a 1982 delegation to go to Uganda to &quot;get it started again&quot;.

David Hines found that Kampala was appalling: nothing worked; there was no water, no electricity, no sanitation, no food, nothing in the shops. Lifts in a government building did not work: there was automatic gunfire in the street below.

&quot;Around the country we had an escort of soldiers. I met some people who I had known … they were delighted to see me. Everybody had lost relatives and friends, and many spoke of torture. On safari north and south, we lived on goats and bananas. Up north, I met an old man who recognised me: he flung himself on the ground and said&quot; &quot;You&#x27;ve come back, you&#x27;ve come back&quot;. &quot;In all the fine hotels, everything had been removed – baths, basins, lavatories – and if you were lucky, someone brought you a tin of hot water to shave.&quot;

&quot;Following our recommendations, the World Bank brought in money, two accountants, and various agricultural officers and engineers.&quot;

==Second Obote period (1981–1985)==

In February 1981, shortly after the new Obote government took office, with Paulo Muwanga as vice president and minister of defense, a former Military Commission member, Yoweri Museveni, and his armed supporters declared themselves the National Resistance Army (NRA). Museveni vowed to overthrow Obote by means of a popular rebellion, and what became known as &quot;the war in the bush&quot; began. Several other underground groups also emerged to attempt to sabotage the new regime, but they were eventually crushed. Museveni, who had guerilla war experience with the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frente de Libertaçâo de Moçambique—Frelimo), campaigned in rural areas hostile to Obote&#x27;s government, especially central and western Buganda and the western regions of Ankole and Bunyoro.

The Obote government&#x27;s four-year military effort to destroy its challengers resulted in vast areas of devastation and greater loss of life than during the eight years of Amin&#x27;s rule. UNLA&#x27;s many Acholi and Lango had been hastily enrolled with minimal training and little sense of discipline. Although they were survivors of Amin&#x27;s genocidal purges of north-east Uganda, in the 1980s they were armed and in uniform, conducting similar actions against Bantu-speaking Ugandans in the south, with whom they appeared to feel no empathy or even pity.

In early 1983, to eliminate rural support for Museveni&#x27;s guerrillas the area of Luwero District, north of Kampala, was targeted for a massive population removal affecting almost 750,000 people. These artificially created refugees were packed into several internment camps subject to military control, which in reality meant military abuse. Civilians outside the camps, in what came to be known as the &quot;Luwero Triangle,&quot; were presumed to be guerrillas or guerilla sympathizers and were treated accordingly. The farms of this highly productive agricultural area were looted—roofs, doors, and even door frames were stolen by UNLA troops. Civilian loss of life was extensive, as evidenced some years later by piles of human skulls in bush clearings and alongside rural roads.

The army also concentrated on the north-western corner of Uganda, in what was then West Nile District. Bordering Sudan, West Nile had provided the ethnic base for much of Idi Amin&#x27;s earlier support and had enjoyed relative prosperity under his rule. Having borne the brunt of Amin&#x27;s anti-Acholi massacres in previous years, Acholi soldiers avenged themselves on inhabitants of Amin&#x27;s home region, whom they blamed for their losses. In one famous incident in June 1981, Ugandan Army soldiers attacked a Catholic mission where local refugees had sought sanctuary. When the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported a subsequent massacre, the government expelled it from Uganda.

Despite these activities, Obote&#x27;s government, unlike Amin&#x27;s regime, was sensitive to its international image and realized the importance of securing foreign aid for the nation&#x27;s economic recovery. Obote had sought and followed the advice of the International Monetary Fund, even though the austerity measures ran counter to his own ideology. He devalued the Ugandan shilling by 100 percent, attempted to facilitate the export of cash crops, and postponed any plans he may once have entertained for re-establishing one-party rule. The continued sufferance of the DP, although much harried and abused by UPC stalwarts, became an important symbol to international donors. The government&#x27;s inability to eliminate Museveni and win the civil war, however, sapped its economic strength, and the occupation of a large part of the country by an army hostile to the Ugandans living there furthered discontent with the regime.

Abductions by the police, as well as the detentions and disappearances so characteristic of the Amin period, recurred. In place of torture at the infamous State Research Bureau at Nakasero, victims met the same fate at so-called &quot;Nile Mansions.&quot; Amnesty International, a human rights organization, issued a chilling report of routine torture of civilian detainees at military barracks scattered across southern Uganda. The overall death toll from 1981 to 1985 was estimated as high as 500,000. Obote, once seen by the donor community as the one man with the experience and will to restore Uganda&#x27;s fortunes, now appeared to be a liability to recovery.

In this deteriorating military and economic situation, Obote subordinated other matters to a military victory over Museveni. North Korean military advisers were invited to take part against the NRA rebels in what was to be a final campaign that won neither British nor United States approval. But the army was warweary, and after the death of the highly capable General Oyite Ojok in a helicopter accident at the end of 1983, it began to split along ethnic lines. Acholi soldiers complained that they were given too much front-line action and too few rewards for their services.

Obote delayed appointing a successor to Oyite Ojok for as long as possible. In the end, he appointed a Lango to the post and attempted to counter the objection of Acholi officers by spying on them, reviving his old paramilitary counterweight, the mostly Langi Special Force Units, and thus repeating some of the actions that led to his overthrow by Amin. As if determined to replay the January 1971 events, Obote once again left the capital after giving orders for the arrest of a leading Acholi commander, Brigadier (later Lieutenant General) Bazilio Olara-Okello, who mobilized troops and entered Kampala on 27 July 1985. Obote, together with a large entourage, fled the country for Zambia. This time, unlike the last, Obote allegedly took much of the national treasury with him.

==Return of military rule (1985–1986)==

On 27 July 1985, together with Bazilio Olara-Okello, Tito Okello staged the coup d&#x27;état that toppled President Milton Obote.

The military government of General Tito Okello ruled from July 1985 to January 1986 with no explicit policy except the natural goal of self-preservation—the motive for their defensive coup. To stiffen the flagging efforts of his army against the NRA, Okello invited former soldiers of Amin&#x27;s army to re-enter Uganda from the Sudanese refugee camps and participate in the civil war on the government side. As mercenaries fresh to the scene, these units fought well, but they were equally interested in looting and did not discriminate between supporters and enemies of the government. The reintroduction of Amin&#x27;s infamous cohorts was poor international public relations for the Okello government and helped create a new tolerance of Museveni and the NRM/A.

Okello could hardly expect to govern the entire country with only war-weary and disillusioned Acholi troops to back him. From August to December 1985, the Okello government attempted to negotiate a peace deal with Museveni, the Nairobi Agreement. The resulting ceasefire broke down almost immediately. With Okello and the remnants of the UNLA army thoroughly discouraged, Museveni had only to wait for the regime to disintegrate.

In January 1986, welcomed enthusiastically by the local civilian population, Museveni moved against Kampala. Okello and his soldiers fled northward to their ethnic base in Acholiland. Yoweri Museveni formally claimed the presidency on 29 January 1986. Immense problems of reconstruction awaited the new regime.

==1986 to present==

A referendum was held in March 2000 on whether Uganda should retain the Movement system or adopt multi-party politics. Although 70% of voters endorsed retention of the Movement system, the referendum was widely criticized for low voter turnout and unfair restrictions on Movement opponents. Museveni was reelected to a second five-year term in March 2001. Parliamentary elections were held in June 2001, and more than 50% of contested seats were won by newcomers. Movement supporters nevertheless remained in firm control of the legislative branch. Observers believed that the 2001 presidential and parliamentary elections generally reflected the will of the electorate; however, both were marred by serious irregularities, particularly in the period leading up to the elections, such as restrictions on political party activities, incidents of violence, voter intimidation, and fraud.

In 2001 the Constitutional Review Commission (CRC) began soliciting opinions and holding public hearings on amending the 1995 Constitution. The CRC was set up to examine the constitutional provisions relating to sovereignty, political systems, democracy and good governance. Its report, scheduled for release by October 2003, has not yet been delivered to Cabinet or made public. The Cabinet, however, presented a list of its suggestions for constitutional change to the CRC in September. These changes included the introduction of a full multiparty system, an increase in executive authority vis-à-vis the other branches, and the lifting of presidential term limits. The elimination of term limits would clear the way for Museveni to run again in 2006, and there are increasing signs that he wishes to do so. However, this proposal has also produced significant controversy and it is not yet clear when or how the constitution will be changed.

The Christian rebel group named the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army (LRA) continues to harass government forces and murder and kidnap civilians in the north and east. Although the LRA does not threaten the stability of the government, LRA violence has displaced 1.2 million people and created a humanitarian crisis. At least 20,000 children have also been abducted over the years. The Uganda Peoples Defense Force (UPDF) launched &quot;Operation Iron Fist&quot; against LRA rebels in northern Uganda in 2002 and conducted operations against LRA sanctuaries in southern Sudan with the permission of the Sudanese Government. Uganda and Sudan have resumed diplomatic relations and exchanged Ambassadors; however, Uganda continues to accuse Sudan of supporting the LRA. Sudan denies the allegations.

In 1998, Uganda deployed a sizable military force to eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), ostensibly to prevent attacks from Ugandan rebel groups operating there. There were widespread allegations that Ugandan military and civilian officials were involved in the illegal exploitation of DRC natural resources. After much international pressure, Uganda withdrew its troops from DRC in June 2003.

On 14 November 2004 it was reported that the President had declared a week-long truce with the rebels that was to begin the following day.

In August 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term. In a referendum in July 2005, 92.5% supported restoring multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or &quot;movement system&quot;.

In October 2005 Kizza Besigye, Museveni&#x27;s main political rival, returned from exile. The same month, another of Museveni&#x27;s rivals, Milton Obote, died in South Africa, and was given a state funeral in Kampala.

The February 2006 elections, the first multiparty elections in 25 years, were held with Besigye&#x27;s Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) as the main challenger to Museveni&#x27;s National Resistance Movement (NRM). NRM won most seats in the National Assembly, and Museveni won the presidency.

On 20 August 2007, Uganda declared that it is seeking legal advice on establishing a war crimes court.

On 11 July 2010, jihadist al-Shabaab bombers killed 74 people in Kampala.

On 12 October 2011, US President Barack Obama authorized the deployment to Uganda of approximately 100 combat-equipped US forces to help regional forces &quot;remove from the battlefield&quot; – meaning capture or kill – Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony and senior leaders of the LRA.

In February 2016, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni described the formation of an East African Federation uniting Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan as &quot;the number one target that we should aim at.&quot; In September 2018 a committee was formed to begin the process of drafting a regional constitution, and a draft constitution for a confederation is set to be written by 2021, with implementation of the confederacy by 2023.

President Yoweri Museveni has ruled the country since 1986 and he was re-elected again in January 2021 presidential elections. According to official results Museveni won the elections with 58% of the vote while popstar-turned-politician Bobi Wine had 35%. The opposition challenged the result because of allegations of widespread fraud and irregularities.

<text>The Friendly Giant is a children&#x27;s television program that aired on CBC Television from September 30, 1958, through to March 1985. It featured three main characters: a giant named Friendly (played by Bob Homme), who lived in a huge castle, along with his puppet animal friends Rusty (a rooster who played a harp, guitar, and accordion and lived in a book bag hung by the castle window), and Jerome (a giraffe who was tawny with purple spots and poked his head in the window). The two principal puppets of the CBC version of the show were manipulated and voiced by Rod Coneybeare. Originally in Wisconsin, they were manipulated and voiced by Ken Ohst.

==Beginnings==
The program started in 1953 on Madison, Wisconsin, radio station WHA, a station owned by the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Shortly thereafter, the show was moved to its sister television station, WHA-TV when it went on the air in 1954. Kinescopes of these shows were distributed to a few other non-commercial stations, and some of them made it to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Toronto, Ontario. At the invitation of Fred Rainsberry, the head of Children&#x27;s Television at the CBC, in 1958, Bob Homme moved the show to Canada, where it became a staple show for several generations of young viewers. In the United States, National Educational Television carried both WHA and CBC versions from 1953 until 1970, when NET ceded the network to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).

&quot;The Friendly Giant&quot; was produced by Daniel McCarthy, who would later become the head of children&#x27;s programming at the CBC.

==Format==

The short, 15-minute show was perhaps most famous for its opening sequence. Each episode would begin with the camera panning to the right over a detailed model of part of a village, farm, harbor, city, etc as Friendly could be heard narrating and observing the goings-on in the land below. The pan would continue until it stops at the Giant&#x27;s great big boot on the left coming into view at the edge of the valley and Friendly would ask the viewers to &quot;Look up  ... waaaaay up!&quot; and the Giant would thus invite everyone to come visit his castle, telling them that he will meet them there after letting the drawbridge down and opening the front doors. The traditional tune &quot;Early One Morning&quot; would then be heard being played on harp and recorder, while the camera slowly zoomed into a model of the Giant&#x27;s castle, the drawbridge slowly dropped down, and the medieval inward-swinging double doors that say &quot;Friendly Giant&quot; opened wide in welcome as promised. Once inside, the Friendly Giant would put out three miniature chairs in front of the fireplace for his viewers beside his feet (with only his feet and hands visible), saying, &quot;Here we are inside, here&#x27;s one little chair for one of you, and a bigger chair for two more to curl up in, and for someone who likes to rock, a rocking chair in the middle.&quot; Then the camera would tilt up, as the Giant gave his iconic invitation to &quot;Now, look up, waaaaaay up, and I&#x27;ll call Rusty ... Rusty?&quot; to which he would then summon his friend, Rusty the Rooster. Typically, Jerome the Giraffe would visit, poking his head in through a high window after being whistled for by Friendly. Rusty the Rooster, who lived in a book bag hanging on the wall by the window, would emerge and produce, from the bag, books to be read and other props, some seemingly larger than could fit in the bag.

The rest of the show focused on gentle, humorous chat between Friendly, Rusty, and Jerome, followed by a story or a musical performance. When extra instrumentation was needed, a pair of otherwise silent puppet cats and raccoons and a rooster—Angie and Fiddle, the Jazz Cats and Patty and Polly, the Raccoons with recorder and bassoon and Buster, a Rooster with electric bass guitar—joined in (puppeteered by Gustáv Hársfai (Sr.) and Linda Keogh (Jr). Music for the show was composed by the show&#x27;s harpist, John Duncan.

At the conclusion of a typical show, Friendly plays one verse of &quot;Early One Morning&quot; on his recorder, says goodbye to his friends and his viewers as he puts his miniature furniture away: &quot;It&#x27;s late. This little chair will be waiting for one of you, and a rocking chair for another who likes to rock, and a big armchair for two more to curl up in when you come again to our castle. I&#x27;ll close the big front doors and pull up the drawbridge after you&#x27;re gone. Goodbye. Goodbye.&quot; His hand gestures farewell as the camera zooms out or fades and the castle&#x27;s medieval doors are closed and the drawbridge is raised. The slow reprise of “Early One Morning” continues on harp and recorder throughout. Night falls on the castle as a silvery moon with a smiling face rises into the sky above, a cow jumps over it as in the nursery rhyme &quot;Hey Diddle Diddle&quot;. Originally, other things besides the cow would appear in the sky such as a bird, Pegasus, etc. On occasion, often for episodes devoted to musical performances, episodes would take place during the night.

The shows were largely ad libbed, typically based around a one-page plot summary for each episode. This gave the show an added spontaneity uncommon to most children&#x27;s shows, though the series was marked by a go-slow, gentle nature with naturalistic discussions between Friendly, Rusty, and Jerome, as though the friends were meeting and simply having a conversation as opposed to actually having a set storyline. The simple repetition of its main elements from show to show put it fundamentally at odds with the bolder, ever-changing nature of such shows as &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, but complemented &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot;, which was a similarly low-key children&#x27;s series that usually aired immediately after &quot;Friendly Giant&quot;.

Throughout the 1960s and into the 1980s, &quot;The Friendly Giant&quot; was part of a block of children&#x27;s programming aired by the CBC each weekday morning that included programs such as &quot;Chez Hélène&quot;, &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot;, and the Canadian edition of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

==Cancellation==
In 1985, &quot;The Friendly Giant&quot; was cancelled. The show&#x27;s replacement, &quot;Fred Penner&#x27;s Place&quot;, has been referred to by some people as &quot;the Giant Killer&quot;. By the time &quot;The Friendly Giant&quot; ended, more than 3,000 episodes of the show had been produced.

===Post-cancellation===
After the show&#x27;s cancellation in 1985, the show continued to air in reruns until September 1987, when the show was removed from the schedule completely to make room for new children&#x27;s shows.

The star of the show, Bob Homme, was made a member of the Order of Canada in 1998. He died on May 2, 2000, at the age of 81 of prostate cancer.

Approximately 850 episodes of the show are currently held in the CBC&#x27;s archive, including kinescopes of the earliest episodes.

&quot;The Friendly Giant&quot; was honoured as a Masterwork by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada in 2005.

The authorized biography of Bob Homme called &quot;Look Up – Way Up&quot; is based on interviews conducted with Bob after he retired. Links to memorable audio clips were also included.

The puppeteer of both Jerome the Giraffe and Rusty the rooster, Rod Coneybeare, passed away on September 5, 2019.

===Props controversy===
Props, costumes and puppets from the show were on display at the CBC Museum in Toronto as part of an exhibit called &quot;Growing Up with CBC&quot;. However, &quot;The Friendly Giant&quot; paraphernalia was removed from the CBC Museum after the puppets Rusty and Jerome appeared, without permission from the Homme family, in a sketch during the 2007 Gemini Awards. Homme&#x27;s daughter said that the clip was in poor taste and disrespected the memory of her father. Only the castle wall and window on which Friendly would lean and talk to Rusty and Jerome remained in the museum until 2017.
The train set of the railway yard used in the show&#x27;s intro is on display at the Pump House Steam Museum in Kingston, Ontario.

<text>Elaine Jill Paige (; born 5 March 1948) is an English singer and actress, best known for her work in musical theatre. Raised in Barnet, Hertfordshire, Paige attended the Aida Foster Theatre School, making her first professional appearance on stage in 1964, at the age of 16. Her appearance in the 1968 production of &quot;Hair&quot; marked her West End debut.

Following a number of roles over the next decade, Paige was selected to play Eva Perón in the first production of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Evita&quot; in 1978, which brought her to the attention of the broader public. For this role, she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Performance of the Year in a musical. She originated the role of Grizabella in &quot;Cats&quot; and had a Top 10 hit with &quot;Memory&quot;, a song from the show. In 1985, Paige released &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; with Barbara Dickson from the musical &quot;Chess&quot;, which remains the biggest-selling record by a female duo. She then appeared in the original stage production of &quot;Chess&quot;, followed by a starring role in &quot;Anything Goes&quot; which she also co-produced. Paige made her Broadway debut in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; in 1996, playing the lead role of Norma Desmond, to critical acclaim. She appeared in &quot;The King and I&quot; from 2000 to 2001, and six years later she returned to the West End stage in &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot;. She has also worked sporadically in television.

In addition to being nominated for five Laurence Olivier Awards, Paige has won many other awards for her theatre roles and has been called the First Lady of British Musical Theatre due to her skill and longevity. She has released 22 solo albums, of which eight were consecutively certified gold and another four multi-platinum. Paige is also featured on seven cast albums and has sung in concerts across the world. Since 2004 she has hosted her own show on BBC Radio 2 called &quot;Elaine Paige on Sunday&quot;.

In 2014, Paige celebrated her 50 years in show business. Paige announced on her official website a &quot;Farewell&quot; concert tour and a new career-spanning album &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot; to mark this milestone in her career. Outside of her work in musical theatre, Paige is a vice-president of The Children&#x27;s Trust, a UK charity for children with brain injury.

==Personal life==
Elaine Jill Bickerstaff was born and raised in Barnet, Hertfordshire, where her father Eric worked as an estate agent and her mother Irene was a milliner. Her mother had been a singer in her youth, and her father was an amateur drummer. Paige stands at just under 5 feet (1.5 m) tall, which she says has caused her to lose out on leading roles. Her original ambition was to become a professional tennis player, at which point her headmistress pointed out to her &quot;they&#x27;d never see you over the net&quot;, but Paige continued to play tennis and has referred to the sport as one of her passions.

At 14, Paige listened to the film soundtrack of &quot;West Side Story&quot;, which evoked the desire for a career in musical theatre. Paige&#x27;s musical ability was encouraged by her school music teacher, Ann Hill, who was also the head of the music department. Paige was a member of Hill&#x27;s choir, and her first role on stage was playing Susanna in a school production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, which was followed by parts in &quot;The Boy Mozart&quot; and solos in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; – &quot;a difficult work for little children&quot;.

She attended Southaw Girls&#x27; School – a secondary modern in Oakleigh Park in Hertfordshire where she received two CSE qualifications.

Her father suggested that she should go to drama school, so she attended the Aida Foster Theatre School. Lacking confidence, she initially disliked stage school; her father encouraged her to persevere and she grew to enjoy her time there.

After graduating, her first job was modelling children&#x27;s clothing at the Ideal Home Exhibition.

Paige has never married nor had children, although she had an 11-year relationship with the lyricist Tim Rice throughout the 1980s. She has said that she wanted to have children, but &quot;it&#x27;s a wonderful life I have, so I&#x27;m very fulfilled in other ways&quot;. 

==Career==
===1968–1980: West End debut, new name and &quot;Evita&quot;===
Paige&#x27;s first professional appearance happened when she was 16 years old, fresh from drama school. She was rejected in her first audition, singing &quot;I Cain&#x27;t Say No&quot;. Her drama school teacher encouraged her to change her name and audition again under the new name. Browsing through a phone book for inspiration, she became aware of the &quot;page&quot; she was observing and decided upon that name with the addition of an &quot;i&quot;, becoming Elaine Paige. She was successful in the second audition as Elaine Paige, appearing on stage during the UK tour of the Anthony Newley/Leslie Bricusse musical &quot;The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd&quot; in 1964, playing the role of a Chinese urchin. In 1968 she appeared on record as a member of the vocal group Colors of Love, who released three Albert Hammond &amp; Mike Hazlewood-penned singles, most notably &quot;I&#x27;m a Train&quot;, on Larry Page&#x27;s Page One label under the supervision of Alan Moorhouse. She was also part of the band Sparrow with fellow West End singer Diane Langton, releasing the album Hatching Out in 1972.

At the age of 20, she made her West End debut in &quot;Hair&quot; on 27 September 1968, remaining in the cast until March 1970. While also being an understudy for the character of Sheila, she played a member of the tribe in the chorus, for which role she was required to be naked on stage in one scene. In 1971, she appeared in the ill-fated musical about premature ejaculation, &quot;Maybe That&#x27;s Your Problem&quot;. She also appeared as an urchin in the film &quot;Oliver!&quot; Over the next decade, she played roles in various musicals, including &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;; &quot;Nuts;&quot; &quot;Grease&quot;, in which she played the lead role of Sandy from 1973 to 1974; &quot;Billy&quot;, from 1974 to 1975 playing Rita; and &quot;The Boyfriend&quot;, as Maisie (1975–1976). She had a minor role as a barmaid in the 1978 sex comedy film &quot;Adventures of a Plumber&#x27;s Mate&quot;.

After months of acting and singing auditions, Hal Prince offered the still relatively unknown Paige the title role of Eva Perón in the first stage production of the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, &quot;Evita&quot;. Her performance won her critical acclaim and brought her into public prominence at the age of 30. Julie Covington, who played the role on the original concept album, had turned down the opportunity of playing the role on stage leading to a long search for a new star. Paige eventually competed against Bonnie Schoen, an American initially favoured by Prince for the role. She later said, &quot;Bonnie was already a big name on Broadway. In a way, she didn&#x27;t have anything to prove. She was smoothly, silkily professional. But I saw this as my big chance and, like Eva when she clapped eyes on Peron, I grabbed with both hands. I wanted the role more than anything else in the whole world.&quot; For her performance in &quot;Evita&quot;, she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical, which at that time was called the Society of West End Theatre Award. She also won the Variety Club Award for Showbusiness Personality of the Year. She played the role for 20 months in total, from 1978 to 1980. She also released her first studio album in 1978, titled &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot;.

Just prior to her success in &quot;Evita&quot;, Paige had strongly considered becoming a nursery nurse, but after she sang for Dustin Hoffman, he made her promise that she would continue in theatre work. She admitted that she was &quot;fed up with the whole thing&quot; and that she could not even afford new clothing or to eat out; &quot;Evita saved me&quot; she stated. In the 1980 ITV drama series &quot;Lady Killers&quot;, Paige played convicted murderer Kate Webster.

===1981–1993: &quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;Chess&quot; era===
In 1981, in the &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; episode &quot;The Way to Do it&quot;, Paige plays Susie, a girl working in a small casino trying to keep guests happy and finally eloping with the main character.

Paige went on to portray some of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s most notable female characters, creating the role of Grizabella in the original production of &quot;Cats&quot; from 11 May 1981 to 13 February 1982. She took on the role late in the rehearsal process when the actress Judi Dench had to withdraw due to a torn Achilles tendon. Paige&#x27;s performance of the song &quot;Memory&quot; from &quot;Cats&quot;, with which she had a Top 10 hit, is her signature piece. The single reached number 6 in the UK charts and has since been recorded by a further 160 artists. She reprised the role of Grizabella for the video release of &quot;Cats&quot; in 1998, one of only two performers in the film from the original London cast; the other was Susan Jane Tanner as Jellylorum. Paige&#x27;s website claims that the video soon became the bestselling music video in the UK and America.

The 1983 production of &quot;Abbacadabra&quot;, written by former ABBA members, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, saw Paige star in the role of Carabosse. She then originated the role of Florence for the 1984 concept album of &quot;Chess&quot;, with lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Ulvaeus and Andersson. Her albums, &quot;Stages&quot; (1983), and &quot;Cinema&quot; (1984), rejoined the cast recording of &quot;Chess&quot; in the UK top 40 chart, giving her three consecutive successful albums. In 1985, Paige released &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot;, a duet from &quot;Chess&quot;, singing with Barbara Dickson. The single held the number 1 position in the British singles charts for four weeks, and still remains the biggest-selling record by a female duo, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. From 1986 to 1987, Paige appeared as Florence in the stage production of &quot;Chess&quot;, a role that earned her a second Olivier Award nomination, this time in the category, Best Actress in a Musical. She next sang at the White House in 1988.

Paige then took on the part of Reno Sweeney in the musical production of &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, which she co-produced and starred in from 1989 to 1990. Patti LuPone was appearing in &quot;Anything Goes&quot; on Broadway around that time, so Paige sought to become the co-producer of the West End production as a way to secure the role there before LuPone could take it. Playing Reno Sweeney was Paige&#x27;s first experience using an American accent on stage, and the role earned her a third Olivier Award nomination. Beyond her theatre roles, she appeared in the television programme &quot;Unexplained Laughter&quot; in 1989 alongside Diana Rigg.

In 1993, Paige signed up for a year as French chanteuse Édith Piaf in Pam Gems&#x27; musical play, &quot;Piaf&quot;, to critical acclaim. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that Paige was &quot;a magnificent, perfect Piaf&quot;. The demanding production required her to sing 15 songs, some in French, and to be on stage for 2 hours 40 minutes in total, and forced her to leave early due to exhaustion. Her portrayal of Piaf earned her an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical, her fourth nomination. She subsequently released an album, titled &quot;Piaf&quot;, containing Édith Piaf songs.

===1994–2001: &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; and Broadway debut===
In 1995, Paige was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to musical theatre.

Paige stepped briefly into the role of Norma Desmond in Lloyd Webber&#x27;s West End production of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; in 1994, when Betty Buckley was taken ill and had to undergo an emergency appendectomy. The nature of the situation meant that Paige only had two and a half weeks in the rehearsal process before her first performance. She admitted feeling daunted by the prospect, having seen Glenn Close in the role on Broadway just prior to entering rehearsals. London critics were largely won over by Paige in a performance that &quot;not only wrings out every ounce of dramatic action but delivers some unexpected humour as well&quot; and she took over the part full-time the following year. She then won the Variety Club Award for Best Actress of the Year, and received her fifth Olivier Award nomination in 1996.

During the run of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; at the West End&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre in 1995, Paige discovered a lump in her breast, prompting her to consult her doctor, who at first reassured her there was nothing to be concerned about. She returned twice, and her doctor subsequently sent her for tests that confirmed the lump was cancerous, nine months after she discovered it. Continuing her role in the production Paige did not miss a show. Paige went in for day surgery on a Sunday due to her theatre commitments, had five years of medical treatment and completed a radiation programme. She has since described the period as &quot;the most awful thing that&#x27;s happened to me in my life&quot;.

Paige transferred to the New York production of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; to make her Broadway debut at the Minskoff Theatre on 12 September 1996, staying with the show until it closed on 22 March 1997. On the &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; set in Broadway, the staircase steps had to be raised six inches (15 cm) in order to accommodate Paige&#x27;s short stature, or it would have been hard to see her behind the banister. Paige was welcomed to the Broadway stage with a long standing ovation from the audience, and received largely positive reviews for her New York performance as Norma Desmond: &quot;The lush sound and the sheer power of her voice are, to put it simply, incredible&quot;, wrote one critic, whilst another said &quot;Her voice has great range, remarkable clarity and emotional force&quot;. Paige was the first Norma Desmond in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; to sing one of the show&#x27;s key songs, &quot;With One Look&quot;, which she did first at Lloyd Webber&#x27;s wedding to Madeleine Gurdon, although at the time the song was called &quot;Just One Glance&quot;. Lloyd Webber noted, regarding Paige&#x27;s performance of one of the show&#x27;s other prominent songs, &quot;As If We Never Said Goodbye&quot;, that it was &quot;as good, if not the best, of anything I&#x27;ve ever heard of mine&quot;. Regarding the key lyric in the song, &quot;This world&#x27;s waited long enough. I&#x27;ve come home at last&quot;, Paige had sought to change the way the melody was sung, despite being fully aware of Lloyd-Webber&#x27;s fastidious tendencies. To her, the moment was not exploited to its fullest potential, so she approached the show&#x27;s musical director, David Caddick, and expressed her wish to hold the word &quot;home&quot;, to which he agreed. Although she had been disappointed when she hoped to perform on Broadway in &quot;Evita&quot;, &quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;Chess&quot;, Paige stated of her debut there, &quot;It was just the most perfect time to go with that particular show&quot;. After &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; finished, she developed depression, commenting that the show&#x27;s closing &quot;was the most terrible feeling. ... I&#x27;d felt I&#x27;d lost something so very important to me. I thought it had died and gone away.&quot;

Arts commentator Melvyn Bragg hosted a special edition of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; about Paige&#x27;s career in 1996, titled &quot;The Faces of Elaine Paige&quot;. The episode saw her visiting parts of the world where plays she had starred in had been set: the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires, Argentina where Eva Perón had given speeches; the Parisian haunts of Edith Piaf including a meeting with her collaborator Charles Aznavour; and Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.

In 1997, Paige made her United States concert debut when she opened the Boston Pops season, which was aired on WGBH in America. The following year, she made a guest appearance at Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s 50th birthday celebration at the Royal Albert Hall, performing &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; and &quot;Memory&quot; She then played Célimène in the non-musical play &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; in 1998, but she admitted that she missed the musical element and that the silence was slightly unsettling to her. A Lifetime Achievement Award from The National Operatic and Dramatic Association soon followed. She later performed alongside Bette Midler in a 1999 New York concert to raise money for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.

From 2000 to 2001, she starred as Anna Leonowens in a revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;The King and I&quot; at the London Palladium. Paige had turned down an offer for the role the first time she was approached, but later accepted, admitting that she had &quot;forgotten what a fantastic score it was&quot;, although she did question her own suitability for the role. Before the opening, the box office had already taken in excess of £7 million in ticket sales. The critic for &quot;The Independent&quot; commented, &quot;It may well be impossible to be a success as Evita and a success as Anna&quot; complaining that Paige was not refined enough for the role, whereas &quot;The Spectator&quot; asserted that the role further strengthened her title as the &quot;First Lady of British Musical Theatre&quot;. During her time in &quot;The King and I&quot;, her mother was diagnosed with cancer. Despite Paige wanting to pull out of the show, her mother insisted that she should continue until her contract had finished, and Paige&#x27;s sister, Marion Billings, admitted, &quot;That was very hard for Elaine, having to go on stage night after night knowing she wanted to be with Mum&quot;.

===2002–2013: Radio and return to West End and Broadway===
Paige sang at the opening of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and then made her Los Angeles concert debut at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. In 2003, she played Angèle in &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will&quot;, directed by Peter Hall. She next sang the role of Mrs Lovett in the New York City Opera production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; in March 2004, earning positive reviews from critics, and a nomination for a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical. Paige then embarked upon a UK tour which was titled &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;.

In September 2004, Paige began a weekly Sunday afternoon radio show, &quot;Elaine Paige on Sunday&quot;, between 1 and 3 pm on BBC Radio 2, featuring music from musical theatre and film. The 400th edition was broadcast on Sunday 29 July 2012. In an unfavourable review, the show was described by Elisabeth Mahoney of &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;a chilly, alienating listening experience&quot; and a &quot;rare wrong move&quot; on the part of Radio 2. Lisa Martland of &quot;The Stage&quot; agreed that &quot;it is by far the music that brings me back to the programme ... and not her lightweight presenting style&quot;. However, the show regularly attracts 3 million listeners, and interviews are also featured each week. Paige also focused on television appearances, playing Dora Bunner in the 2005 ITV adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;A Murder Is Announced&quot; in the &quot;Marple&quot; series, before performing a guest role as a post mistress in &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;. The episode of &quot;Marple&quot; was watched by 7.78 million viewers.

The release of Paige&#x27;s first full studio album of new recordings in 12 years was marked in 2006, titled &quot;Essential Musicals&quot;. The album included popular songs from musicals identified by a poll on her radio show, in which 400,000 listeners voted. At this point, Paige had recorded 20 solo albums in total, of which eight were consecutively certified gold and another four multi-platinum, and she had been featured on seven cast albums. Paige also appeared in concert in Scandinavia, Hong Kong, Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore. On 20 and 21 December 2006, she performed in concert in Shanghai, extending her concert tour to two dates to satisfy demand. With a noticeable absence from musical theatre, having not taken a role for many years, she explained in 2006 that &quot;there&#x27;s been nothing that I&#x27;ve wanted to do, and if you&#x27;re going to commit to a year at the theatre, six days a week, and have no life, then it&#x27;s got to be something that you want to do with all your heart&quot;. She also affirmed that she believes for older actors it becomes harder to obtain theatre roles.

In 2007, Paige made a return to the West End stage for the first time in six years, as the Chaperone/Beatrice Stockwell in &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot; at the Novello Theatre. The production ran for a disappointing 96 performances, although it had opened to a standing ovation from the audience and a generally optimistic reaction from critics. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote, &quot;Elaine Paige is a good sport ... enduring jokes about her reputation for being &#x27;difficult&#x27; with a grin that doesn&#x27;t seem all that forced. ... Only the self-importantly serious and the chronically depressed will fail to enjoy this preposterously entertaining evening&quot;. Paul Taylor from &quot;The Independent&quot; was less impressed and wrote &quot;a miscast Elaine Paige manages to be unfunny to an almost ingenious degree as the heroine&#x27;s bibulous minder&quot;. For her performance, Paige was nominated for a What&#x27;s On Stage Award in the category of Best Supporting Actress in a Musical. She next collaborated with the duo Secret Garden in recording the song &quot;The Things You Are to Me&quot; for their 2007 album, &quot;Inside I&#x27;m Singing&quot;.

To raise money for Sport Relief, Paige danced the tango on &quot;Sport Relief does Strictly Come Dancing&quot; with Matt Dawson in March 2008, where they were voted second overall. In 2008, she opened the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod and performed concerts in China, America and Australia featuring songs from her 40-year career. To further celebrate 40 years since her first performance on a West End Stage, in October 2008 Paige released a picture-based autobiography titled &quot;Memories&quot;. The book took around eight months to compile; &quot;Since &quot;Evita&quot; I suppose, I had kept a yearbook. My parents always kept cuttings and things like that for me. I did have quite a lot of reference material to work out,&quot; Paige commented.

An album titled &quot;Elaine Paige and Friends&quot; was produced by Phil Ramone in 2010. The album features duets with Paige and artists such as Johnny Mathis, Barry Manilow and Olivia Newton-John as well as a duet with Sinéad O&#x27;Connor of a new song &quot;It&#x27;s Only Life&quot; penned by Tim Rice and Gary Barlow. Having entered the top 20 of UK Album Charts, it went on to achieve gold status.

Paige played the role of Carlotta Campion in the Kennedy Center production of &quot;Follies&quot; in May and June 2011 at the Eisenhower Theatre in Washington, DC, receiving favourable reviews for her performance of the showstopper, &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here.&quot; The principal cast also comprised Bernadette Peters, Jan Maxwell, Ron Raines and Danny Burstein. She reprised this role in the Broadway transfer of the musical at the Marquis Theatre from August 2011 until the following January, before performing at the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles, California in May and June 2012.

===2014–present: 50th Anniversary, farewell tour===
At the end of 2013 Paige announced a concert tour, &quot;Page by Page by Paige,&quot; which focused on her 50th anniversary in show business and was advertised as a farewell tour. The 40th-anniversary tour in 2008 marked 40 years since her debut on the West End stage, and the 50th-anniversary tour in 2014 marked 50 years since her first stage performance. The tour featured Garðar Thór Cortes performing a number of songs, both solo and duets with Paige, and was sold out at all venues. The tour ran from 9 to 20 October 2014, concluding at the Royal Albert Hall, London. Other stops included Cardiff, Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle (Gateshead), Glasgow, Birmingham and Bournemouth. Due to a throat infection, one concert in Brighton had to be cancelled. Dates in Ireland were postponed before being rescheduled, with Paige giving four sold-out concerts in Dublin (two evenings), Limerick and Cork between 10 and 16 February 2015.

In 2014, Paige presented and performed in a six episode television show for Sky Arts television called &quot;The Elaine Paige Show.&quot; The show featured songs performed by Paige, masterclasses with drama college students and interviews and performances by West End and Broadway performers and writers. The show was recorded in March and April at Riverside Studios, London. She released a new career-spanning album &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot; in May 2014. In June, Paige made her debut at G-A-Y&#x27;s Heaven nightclub in London and in November, she joined the inaugural Australian cruise of the performing arts on the .

In May 2015 Paige was part of VE Day 70: A Party to Remember, a special concert which took place at the Horse Guards Parade, and was broadcast live on BBC1 and BBC Radio 2. Later in 2015 she performed in concert at Scarborough Open Air Theatre, supported by Collabro and Rhydian, and then headlined the Glamis Prom 2015 at Glamis Castle, Scotland, with Susan Boyle as her guest. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra accompanied at both concerts.

In April 2016, it was announced that Paige would perform a number of concerts – on successive weekends rather than intensive schedule of a regular tour – entitled &quot;Stripped Back&quot;. The tour initially ran from October until December 2016 and featured music by Harry Nilsson, Randy Newman, Jimmy Webb, Burt Bacharach, Leonard Cohen, Sting, Elton John and Lennon-McCartney.

Paige appeared in a new BBC adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; adapted by Russell T Davies as part of the Shakespeare 400 celebrations in 2016.

In 2017, she appeared in pantomime at the London Palladium as Queen Rat in &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; alongside Julian Clary, Nigel Havers, Paul Zerdin, Gary Wilmot, Charlie Stemp, Emma Williams, Ashley Banjo and Diversity. She returned for &quot;Pantoland at The Palladium&quot; in 2020, along with most of the 2017 cast as well as Beverley Knight.

In 2018, Paige played the part of Mercy Hackett in the BBC TV comedy &quot;Home from Home&quot;. In 2020, she appeared in the BBC drama series &quot;Life&quot; with Alison Steadman and Peter Davison.

==Legacy==
Having had so many starring roles in famous musicals, many to critical acclaim, Paige is often referred to as the First Lady of British Musical Theatre. In 2008, she celebrated the 40th anniversary of her professional debut on the West End stage. 

Paige&#x27;s singing abilities have won her worldwide praise, as have her acting skills, with Andrew Gans of &quot;Playbill&quot; magazine writing that &quot;Paige&#x27;s gift is to dissect a role and determine what phrasing, gesture or emotion can bring a scene to its fullest dramatic potential&quot;. Mark Shenton also highlighted her voice in 2008 as &quot;one of the most distinctive and impressive voices in the business&quot;. Lloyd-Webber insists that her rendition of &quot;As If We Never Said Goodbye&quot; is one of the best interpretations of a song by him.

Paige has been called &quot;difficult&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; Brian Logan wrote, &quot;Paige is not exactly known for her humility. In newspaper profiles, that dread word &#x27;difficult&#x27; is often applied&quot;. On one occasion, she told a male interviewer that she was going to stop giving interviews to female reporters because, in her own words, &quot;I don&#x27;t trust other women in these situations. They establish a sisterhood with you and then betray it every time&quot;. What has been seen as a cold side to her personality was also noted by Logan, but Paige has said that a common misconception of her is that she is confident and very serious. Another editor found her &quot;refreshingly down-to-earth&quot; and &quot;very friendly&quot;.

Susan Boyle cited Paige as her inspiration in her audition on &quot;Britain’s Got Talent&quot;.

==Views on theatre==
Though Paige has enjoyed a long career in musical theatre, she rarely goes to watch musicals, much preferring to watch films or plays. She considers herself primarily an actress, rather than a singer, stating, &quot;I really prefer to be in character&quot;. Comparing the work of Rodgers and Hammerstein to that of Lloyd Webber, Paige has said that she finds Rodgers and Hammerstein songs more difficult to sing, and described them as challenging. She concluded, &quot;it&#x27;s a quieter kind of singing, more controlled, not belting it out&quot;.

In the light of the physical demands of performing in theatre Paige has said &quot;Musical theatre is the hardest thing any actor will ever do. You become obsessive about sleeping, eating the right food, not speaking and giving yourself vocal rest and keeping exercised&quot;. Regarding the pressure of having to be in a fit condition to perform in theatre each night, she remarked &quot;you wouldn&#x27;t want to read the letters people write when you&#x27;re off and they&#x27;re disappointed – it&#x27;s so awful, the guilt one feels for not being there&quot;. As part of a rigorous routine before musical roles to look after her voice, Paige stops eating dairy products and drinking alcohol and works hard on her fitness. After about three months into the production when her voice is tiring from performing, she withdraws from her normal social life, sometimes only communicating by notepad and fax. She never reads her reviews, finding that it is not helpful to hear too many opinions of her work.

In 2007, Paige named reality television series such as &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot;, which aim to find an unknown actor to play the lead role in a musical, as the greatest threat to theatre today, believing that &quot;actors already striving in the theatre wouldn&#x27;t dream of putting themselves on these shows&quot;. In a later interview, she questioned the seriousness of the actors auditioning for this type of show: &quot;you wouldn&#x27;t put yourself up for one of those shows in case you got bumped off the first week and all your colleagues saw it&quot;. She has also expressed a wish for more new musicals to be put into production, instead of frequent revivals.

==Charity==
Paige has been an Ambassador of The Children&#x27;s Trust, the UK&#x27;s leading charity for children with brain injury and neurodisabiity, for over 35 years, since the charity was created, when she first presented the charity with a minibus. She has hosted and performed at fundraising events for the charity including hosting 5 bi-annual Elaine Paige Clay Pigeon Shoots.

<doc id="413459" wikidata="Q27785" url="?curid=413459" title="Denaʼina language">
<text>Denaʼina , also Tanaina, is the Athabaskan language of the region surrounding Cook Inlet. It is geographically unique in Alaska as the only Alaska Athabaskan language to include territory which borders salt water. Four dialects are usually distinguished:

# Upper Inlet, spoken in Eklutna, Knik, Susitna, Tyonek
# Outer Inlet, spoken in Kenai, Kustatan, Seldovia
# Iliamna, spoken in Pedro Bay, Old Iliamna, Lake Iliamna area
# Inland, spoken in Nondalton, Lime Village

Of the total Denaʼina population of about 900 people, only 75–95 members still speak Denaʼina. James Kari has done extensive work on the language since 1972, including his edition with Alan Boraas of the collected writings of Peter Kalifornsky in 1991. Joan M. Tenenbaum also conducted extensive field research on the language in the 1970s.

==Ethnonym==
The word is composed of the , meaning &#x27;person&#x27; and the human plural suffix . While the apostrophe which joins the two parts of this word ordinarily indicates a glottal stop, most speakers pronounce this with a diphthong, so that the second syllable of the word rhymes with English &#x27;nine&#x27; (as in the older spelling Tanaina).

==Phonology==
Denaʼina is one of seven Alaska Athabaskan languages which does not distinguish phonemic tone.

===Consonants===
The consonants of Denaʼina in practical orthography, with IPA equivalents.


===Vowels===
The 4 vowels of Denaʼina. Close vowels are more open in the environment of a uvular consonant.

Generally, the vowels i, a, and u are considered &#x27;long&#x27; vowels and are fully pronounced in words, however the e is considered a reduced vowel similar to the English schwa.

===Syllable structure===

In the Inland dialect, syllables at the end of a semantic unit are often longer, lower in pitch, and have longer rhymes. The onset of a syllable has consonant clusters of up to three, such as CCCVC, though these are rare and more commonly, a syllable onset is one or two consonants.

== Writing systems ==
Dena&#x27;ina uses a variant of the Latin alphabet, though a Dena&#x27;ina artist, Argent Kvasnikoff, created a custom alphabet for the language.

==Morphology==
Denaʼina is a polysynthetic language where a single word can mean the entirety of an English sentence.

Verbs are the most elaborate part of speech in the Denaʼina language, which vary in verb paradigms which vary by subject, object, or aspect.
The following example is of the verb &quot;to be&quot; in the imperfective aspect and in the Nondalton dialect.

==Grammatical categories==

Denaʼina indicates classification with obligatory verb prefixes, meaning the root verb appears at the end of the word. The verb will always specify a classification and often person, gender, or object prefixes that indicate aspects of the noun or object for transitive verbs, and aspects of the speaker for intransitive verbs. Person can also be indicated by suffixes on the noun; the singular person suffix on a noun is generally , whereas the plural suffix is generally or . Plurals for non-persons that are animate are indicated by the noun suffixes , , and . Inanimate plurals are unable to be indicated by a noun suffix, and instead attach to the verb.

For examples of person indication on the verb, see the chart under the morphology section above concerning the verb root . Denaʼina specifies between 1st person singular/plural, 2nd person singular/plural, 3rd person singular/plural, and areal.

Verbs fall into many categories that are broadly lumped into &quot;active&quot; and &quot;neuter&quot;, where an active verb indicates movement, a state of being incomplete, something being made, or in the production of sound, and a neuter verb indicates a general state of being that is complete. Categories of classification that are affixed to a verb also can refer to certain characteristics of the object of that verb. Depending on the gender affix that follows the classificatory affix, the nature of the object can change, as indicated by the following chart:

However, there are other categories of classification or instrumentation that indicate how an action was done or aspects about the outcome of the action. Many instrumental affixes have become causative over time. Causality is expressed by changing a classifier in the verb to &quot;. Instrumental affixes that indicate the manner or motion of an action include the following: &quot;, which refers to clubbing an object or leaving a depression in the snow; &quot;, which refers to causing an object to leave, disappear, or die; &quot;, which refers to affecting an object with the mouth; &quot;, and &quot;, which all indicate that the object being referred to was used in an instrumental sense; &quot; ()&quot;, which refers to a pointing motion; &quot;, which refers to a wiping motion; and &quot;, which refers to the use of a hand.

==Space relations==

=== Postpositions ===

Denaʼina shows space relations through the addition of morphemes that are either independent or bound, known as postpositions.

* Independent postpositions follow a noun. For example, &quot;miłni det&quot; (without water) is composed of the noun &quot;miłni&quot; (water) and the postposition &quot;det&quot; (without).
* Bound postpositions follow a pronoun or a noun, but are said and written as one word, and are often related to directionals.
** Sheł (&quot;with me&quot;) is composed of the pronoun sh (&quot;me&quot;) and the postposition eł (&quot;with&quot;).
** Object + -ch&#x27; (towards the object, in the direction of the object)
*** = &quot;He is walking towards us&quot;
** Object + -a (object spends time)
*** = &quot;He spent the whole summer day&quot;
*** Be = &quot;him/her&quot; (be + a = ba)

Postpositions can also be incorporated into a verb as a prefix.

=== Demonstratives ===

Space relations can also be marked by demonstratives pronouns, which indicate proximal/distal distinction.

* - that
* - that/these things, non-human and distant
* - this/these things, non-human and close by
* - there in the distance
* - that person, human and distant
* - here, nearby
* - this person, human and close by
* - those persons, human and distant
* - these persons, human and close by

For example:
* = &quot;those mountains&quot;
* = &quot;that person calls&quot;
* = &quot;this woman&quot;

=== Adverbs ===

Adverbs of location and direction can also convey space relations.

* nes - out from center
** nes yanił chet = &quot;he shoved the boat out&quot;
* en - off or away from
** ye&#x27;un = &quot;away from it&quot;
** ye&#x27;un ti&#x27;ilgguk = &quot;he went out the door&quot;

=== Directionals ===

The directional system in Denaʼina is based upon river flows, and are used with directional prefixes, roots, and suffixes.

* Prefixes:
** ey - unmarked
** yu - distant
** du - near
* Roots:
** n&#x27;e or ni - upstream
** du or t&#x27;e - downstream
* Suffixes:
** ∅ - towards
** -ch&#x27; - towards, form
** -t - at, the place of

For example, yunit means &quot;at a place far upstream&quot;, and is composed of the prefix &quot;yu&quot;, root &quot;ni&quot;, and suffix &quot;t&quot;.

==Time and tense==

=== Temporal adverbs ===

Temporal adverbs convey information about when an action or intent of the verb occurred.
* - always
* - never
* - all day
* - still

For example:
* = &quot;I worked all day&quot;
* = &quot;always fog&quot;

=== Mode ===
Mode indicates when the action happens. Normal mode is also referred to as tense, and is given by mode/aspect prefix positions in the verbs. The tense modes are the imperfect (present), perfect (past) and the future represented by 4 types of imperfectives—, , , —and 4 types of perfectives—, , , . There are also 4 modal variations: neuter, inceptive, optative-intentional, and negative.

==== Tense ====

* Imperfective mode - action was started and is continuing at the present time
** imperfective and imperfective - generally means the action in moving toward completion
** imperfective - associated w/ motion verbs
** imperfective - generally means the action is static
* Perfect mode - action was started and completed in the past
** perfective - most common perfect structure in most aspects
** perfective - often used with motion verbs when action has reached terminal state
** perfective - generally means the actions have achieved a stable state
** perfective - used in transitional themes
* Future mode - action has yet to happen. Used with a future stem, a &quot;&quot; in the mode position, and a &quot;()&quot; in the inceptive position

==== Modal variations ====

* Optative-intentional mode - expresses an intent to act
* Inceptive mode - &quot;beginning to&quot; in the imperfect and perfect modes
* Imperfect inceptive
* Perfective inceptive
* Neuter - applicable to neuter verbs, and &quot;to be&quot; neuter

=== Aspect ===
Aspect conveys information about how the action happened, and works in conjunction with tense. The most common aspects are conclusive, momentaneous, neuter, onomatopoetic, and semelfactive. The morpheme attached to the root verb can also change depending on aspect.

== Modality ==

Modality is most commonly and easily seen in evidentials which usually appear at the end of a sentence.

* Evidentials - words that emphasize certainty 
** - then it is
** ł - it is said, it seems, apparently
** For example:
*** = &quot;I am the one&quot;
*** = &quot;The Denaʼina, they say, had some beliefs about the animals&quot;
* Emphatics - words that add emphasis
** - I am
** For example:
*** = &quot;I am Albert, this is who I am&quot;

==Predicates, arguments, and case==

Predicate refers to the main verb and auxiliary verbs, while arguments usually refer to those words outside of the predicate.

Word order in the basic Denaʼina sentence is subject-object-verb (SOV). Because of this, there is a low danger of referential ambiguity. It is rare to have both the subject and the objects as nouns; instead, one or both usually occur as pronouns. Some sentences differ from the SOV structure. In subject-verb (SV), the object is embedded in the verb as a pronoun, or the sentence doesn&#x27;t require an object. In object-verb (OV), the subject is a pronoun contained in the verb, and the object is a noun.

An example sentence structure: object pronoun (argument) + outer subject pronoun (argument) + (other prefixes) + inner subject pronoun (argument) + ... verb stem (predicate). This example shows multiple arguments attaching to a single predicate.

A full clause can be expressed in the verb. In the verb, the verb stem is last, and even when embedded in the verb, the object and subject necessarily come first. In Denaʼina, all verbs require a nominative (subject) and an accusative (object), which indicates a nominative-accusative case. This means the marked morphemes, or those that change to convey more specific meanings, are those that indicate the object. Distinction occurs between the nominative and accusative, and each would have its own core argument.

==Obliques==
Obliques indicate instrumentals, locatives, and other arguments outside of core arguments. Both core and oblique arguments attach to the verb via prefixes which must occur in a certain order. In Denaʼina, obliques are prefixes to the verb which occur between the object prefix and the inner subject pronoun prefix and/or the outer subject pronoun.

==Possession==

===Inherent possession===
Denaʼina has inherently possessed nouns and non-verbs. Inherently possessed words consist of a prefix and a stem which are abound morphemes. For example, &quot;shunkda&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot;, where &quot;sh-&quot; is the possessive pronoun meaning &quot;my&quot;, and &quot;-unkda&quot; is the possessed root meaning &quot;mother&quot;.

The pronouns used with inherently possessed bound morphemes:

* sh- = my
* qu- = their
* n- = your (singular)
* k&#x27;e- = someone&#x27;s
* be- = his/her
* de- = his/her own
* na = our
* deh- = their own
* h- = your (plural)
* nił- = each other&#x27;s

===Non-inherent possession===
Non-inherent possession occurs with proper nouns as the possessor, shown by -a or -&#x27;a attached as a suffix to the possessed noun. Possessive pronouns are attached as a prefix to the possessed noun and the -&#x27;a is added at the end of the word.

==Complement clauses==
Complement clauses are clauses that act as the direct object of the verb, introduced by a complementizer (e.g.: in English, &quot;that&quot; or &quot;which&quot;). Complement clauses exist as subordinate clauses and bare clauses, as with other languages in the Athabaskan language family. Some complement clauses are marked by enclitics, and are always embedded as part of the sentence.

Relative suffixes are attached to nouns or verbs, and are one of the few suffixes on verbs. Common relative suffixes include:

* -en = &quot;the person that&quot;
* -t = &quot;the place that&quot;
* -na = &quot;the people that&quot;
* -h = &quot;at, to a general area&quot;
* -i = &quot;the thing that&quot;
* -hdi = &quot;then, next&quot;

==Endangerment==

The population of Denaʼina is 900. As of 2007, there are 75-90 speakers, and in 1970 there were only 10 speakers of the Kenai dialect.

Linguist Michael E. Krauss provides three levels of endangerment: safe; endangered, where the language is being learned by children but requires community effort to maintain it; and moribund, where the language is not being learned by children. According to this classification, the Denaʼina is a moribund language.

===Revitalization efforts===
There are various efforts to revitalize the language.

* The Denaʼina Archiving, Training and Access grant (DATA) aims to archive and provide access to Denaʼina materials. It also attempts to train community members in technology. 
* Lake Clark National Park maintains a catalog of audio recordings of the language. 
* Some books are being published on Denaʼina language and culture, and there is a yearly Denaʼina festival, followed by a three-week intensive course led by elders. 
* At the Kenai Peninsula College, there is a language class on the Cook Inlet dialect. As of October 2014, there are only 15 students, all young adults, in the class, but this indicates momentum. The class&#x27;s curriculum is formed from the collected grammars published by linguists.

Contributing factors to the endangerment include the policy of early territorial schools to not let native students speak their own language, especially in regards to the Kenai dialect. This policy was often enforced via corporal punishment; the trauma caused elders, all within one generation, to avoid speaking the language.

<doc id="413464" wikidata="Q580893" url="?curid=413464" title="Olive-sided flycatcher">
<text>The olive-sided flycatcher (Contopus cooperi) is a small to medium sized passerine bird in the family Tyrannidae, the Tyrant flycatcher family. It is a migratory species that travels from South to North America to breed during the summer. It is a very agile flyer and mainly consumes flying insects on flight. Since 2016, this species has been assessed as being near-threatened globally (IUCN) and threatened in Canada (SRA) due to its declining populations.

== Description ==

=== Identification ===
Olive-sided flycatchers are migratory songbirds which are relatively small. It is qualified as small to medium-sized birds and are estimated to be smaller than American robins, but bigger than sparrows. The olive-sided flycatcher can be identified by its olive-grey or grey-brownish plumage above and with a white mid-breast section and throat. The olive tones on its back and wings are seen mainly in optimal light and when the feathers are freshly moulted. The sides of the breast area are grey and make the bird look like it is wearing a vest (see &quot;Fig. 2&quot;). It has a relatively long bill and long wings for its size. Sometimes, some of its head feathers can be raised which make it look like it has a small crest. The species does not exhibit sexual dimorphism, which means that male and female look similar. Olive-sided flycatchers perch in upright positions on top of dead branches or trees.
=== Similar species ===
Olive-sided flycatchers can be confused with other birds in the genus &quot;Contopus&quot; like the Greater Pewee, Western Wood-Pewee, Eastern Wood-Pewee, and the Eastern Phoebe. They can be distinguished these species by observing the following differences: the plain grey breasts of the greater pewee (as opposed to the vest-like chest of the olive-sided flycatcher), they are twice the weight of the western and eastern wood pewees, and the eastern phoebe has more white underparts than the olive-sided flycatcher.

== Taxonomy ==
Olive-sided flycatchers (&quot;Contopus cooperi&quot;) are part of the class Aves in the order Passeriformes, meaning they are passerines which are known as perching or song birds. They are part of the family Tyrannidae because they are Tyrant flycatchers found in America and they belong to the genus Contopus which is the Pewee taxon. Pewees are known as being insect eaters who catch their prey generally in flight.

The species has often been considered to be monotypic; the Clements Checklist and AOS Checklist of North American Birds currently do not recognize any subspecies. However, the disjunct populations that breeds in southern California and Baja California is sometimes recognized as a distinct subspecies, &quot;C. cooperi majorinus.&quot; This subspecies is a short-distance migrant and has longer wings and tail feathers than birds from elsewhere. 

== Distribution and habitat ==
The olive-sided flycatcher is distributed throughout North and South America. Its breeding habitat ranges from California to New Mexico, all the way up to central Alaska, then across Canada (except for most of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut) and through a portion of northeastern US. Its non-breeding habitat is mainly in the northern part of South America and a small area in Central America.

Their breeding habitat is mainly in open areas or edges of boreal, coniferous forests or temperate western forests, in areas up to 10,000 feet in elevation (e.g., in the Rockies), and always near water. They can also nest in cities or on farms. In their non-breeding habitat, olive-sided flycatchers use similar habitats as their breeding habitats such as open areas and forest edges, but do not need water proximity as much as in their breeding habitat. They are also associated to habitats with very tall trees. Two forest habitats used by olive-sided flycatchers in the winter are tropical montane and tropical lowland evergreen forests.

== Behaviour ==
A study made in the Northwest Territories determined flight behaviours of olive-sided flycatchers near their nests. Results show that four out of eight males would fly from 0 m to 49 m away from their nest and would sing only when at a distance of more than 100 m. It was also found that pairs whose nests were in more open areas did not travel as far than when nests were deeper in the forest.

=== Vocalizations ===
Vocalizations are made by songbirds through songs which are for breeding purposes or through calls to communicate with other individuals of its species. During the breeding, olive-sided flycatcher males sing a song to attract a mate. Its song sounds like it is saying &quot;Quick, three beers!&quot; with three successive high-pitched sounds. The first sound is shorter and not as high-pitched and loud as the two others. Sometimes, during mating season, males can produce growling sounds or even squeaks when in conflict with other males. Calls are produced by birds to communicate with one another. This species&#x27; most frequent call is 3 quick successive &quot;pip&quot; sounds.

The rate at which males sing varies throughout the breeding season. This variation appears to be correlated indirectly with the breeding status (single, paired, or feeding young) of the individuals.

=== Reproduction ===

Olive-sided flycatchers breed once per year and usually get clutches of 3 to 4 eggs. The incubation period lasts for 15 to 19 days and so does the nestling period. The egg size is approximately 0.8-0.9 inches long by 0.6-0.7 inches wide and is a creamy white colour with brownish spots that form a ring on the larger end of the egg. The nest location is chosen by the female and is usually on a horizontal branch of coniferous trees, but have also been seen on other types of trees. The lowest nest was 5 feet high on a tree and the highest was 197 feet. In Western regions, olive-sided flycatchers tend to have higher nests than in their Eastern distributions. The nest is about 4.6 inches wide on the outside and 2.8 inches wide on the inside and is cup-shaped. The outer part is made with twigs and small branches, while the inside is usually lined with finer material such as grass, lichen, needles, etc. The hatching are born naked and helpless. The male defends a large area around the nesting territory. Both parents feed the young birds.
=== Diet ===
Hawking is the main feeding method used by olive-sided flycatchers. They feed on flying insects (e.g., bees, wasps, moths, beetles, grasshoppers, etc.) and capture them in the air. They will sometimes feed on fruit during migration and non-breeding season.

During parental care, olive-sided flycatchers were found to consume its chicks&#x27; fecal sacs. Indeed, both sexes appear to do so within the first week of hatchings&#x27; lives, then start to remove them from the nest. This behaviour is thought to act as a supplement in the parental nutrition.

=== Migration ===
Of all the flycatcher species that breed in the United States, the olive-sided flycatcher has the longest migration. Some olive-sided flycatchers migrate up to 7,000 miles traveling between central Alaska and Bolivia.
== Status and conservation ==

According to the IUCN Red List in 2016, the olive-sided flycatcher is classified as a &quot;near threatened&quot; species. The criteria for a species to fit in this conservation status is when the taxon does not fit within the Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable categories, but is likely to fit within one of them in the near future. The Canadian Species at Risk Act lists the olive-sided flycatcher as threatened due to its declining population.

The olive-sided flycatcher&#x27;s global population is estimated at 1.9 million individuals but appears to be declining at a rate of 3% of the population per year and has declined by 79% in the past 50 years.

=== Climate change ===
With climate change becoming increasingly important and causing important changes in the ecosystems, a study was made in Nova Scotia to predict climate-resilient habitats which would be suitable for olive-sided flycatchers. The authors built a model which considered mean canopy height as the most important factor to consider for this species because it needs a habitat with tall trees. The results suggest that the relative habitat suitability for olive-sided flycatchers in the area of study (Nova Scotia) increased with canopy height and decreased as the habitat moved further away from conifer-dominated forests and areas with dead material which is known to be crucial for their feeding habits. This species is also expected to prefer valleys, lowlands and flatter areas which have the potential to form wetlands or streams. The results from this study determined that the forests used in Nova Scotia have a high potential for olive-sided flycatcher populations to be resilient to climate change.

=== Threats ===
A research made in Eastern Canada showed that disturbances caused by human activities and road proximity have a negative impact on olive-sided flycatcher populations in Canadian national parks. This study helped quantify the importance of protected areas for the species.

The loss of wintering habitat might be one of the main causes for its population decline. However, they do not seem to be directly impacted by forest loss, although they might be sensitive to it. Declines in flying insect populations due to insecticide use is what is thought to impact most directly the species. In their non-breeding habitat, on the east slope of Andres, the winter populations are highly threatened, but the exact threats have not yet been identified. Burned or freshly-logged forests are great foraging habitats for the olive-sided flycatchers due to the increased presence of flying insects, but they could be negatively affected in these environments by wildfire suppression techniques or salvage logging. Collisions with communication towers seem to be another cause of mortality threatening olive-sided flycatchers.
