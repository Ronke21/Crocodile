<text>In music theory, a minor sixth is a musical interval encompassing six staff positions (see Interval number for more details), and is one of two commonly occurring sixths (the other one being the major sixth). It is qualified as &quot;minor&quot; because it is the smaller of the two: the minor sixth spans eight semitones, the major sixth nine. For example, the interval from A to F is a minor sixth, as the note F lies eight semitones above A, and there are six staff positions from A to F. Diminished and augmented sixths span the same number of staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (seven and ten respectively).

==Equal temperament==
In 12-tone equal temperament (12-ET), the minor sixth is enharmonically equivalent to the augmented fifth. It occurs in first inversion major and dominant seventh chords and second inversion minor chords. It is equal to eight semitones, i.e. a ratio of 28/12:1 or simplified to 22/3:1 (about 1.587), or 800 cents.

==Just temperament==
===Definition===
In just intonation multiple definitions of a minor sixth can exist:
*In 3-limit tuning, i.e. Pythagorean tuning, the minor sixth is the ratio 128:81, or 792.18 cents, i.e. 7.82 cents &quot;flatter&quot; than the 12-ET-minor sixth. This is denoted with a &quot;-&quot; (minus) sign (see figure).

*In 5-limit tuning, a minor sixth most often corresponds to a pitch ratio of 8:5 () or 814 cents; i.e. 13.7 cents &quot;sharper&quot; than the 12-ET-minor sixth. 
*In 11-limit tuning, the 11:7 () undecimal minor sixth is 782.49 cents.

===Consonance===
The minor sixth is one of consonances of common practice music, along with the unison, octave, perfect fifth, major and minor thirds, major sixth and (sometimes) the perfect fourth. In the common practice period, sixths were considered interesting and dynamic consonances along with their inverses the thirds, but in medieval times they were considered dissonances unusable in a stable final sonority. In that period they were tuned to the &quot;flatter&quot; Pythagorean minor sixth of 128:81. In 5-limit just intonation, the minor sixth of 8:5 is classed as a consonance.

Any note will only appear in major scales from any of its minor sixth major scale notes (for example, C is the minor sixth note from E and E will only appear in C, D, E, F, G, A and B major scales).

===Subminor sixth===

In addition, the subminor sixth, is a subminor interval which includes ratios such as 14:9 and 63:40. of 764.9 cents or 786.4 cents respectively.

<doc id="415196" wikidata="Q351732" url="?curid=415196" title="Sonny Chiba">
<text>, known internationally as Sonny Chiba, was a Japanese actor and martial artist. Chiba was one of the first actors to achieve stardom through his skills in martial arts, initially in Japan and later to an international audience.

Born in Fukuoka, Chiba played a variety of sports in high school, including baseball and volleyball. He also practiced gymnastics and participated at the National Sports Festival of Japan in his third year. When he was a university student, he learned martial arts, earning a black belt in Kyokushin Karate in 1965 and later receiving a fourth degree in 1984.

Chiba&#x27;s career began in the 1960s, when he starred in two &quot;tokusatsu&quot; superhero shows. In his first role, he replaced Susumu Wajima as the main character Kōtarō Ran/Seven Color Mask in &quot;Seven Color Mask&quot; (&quot;Nana-iro Kamen&quot;) in the second half of the series. However, his breakthrough role was in the 1974 film &quot;The Street Fighter&quot;. Before retiring, Chiba had also appeared in a number of English language American films, including &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; (2003) and &quot;Fast &amp; Furious 3: Tokyo Drift&quot; (2006).

Chiba died of COVID-19 complications at the hospital in Tokyo on 19 August 2021, at the age of 82.

== Names ==
Born , he used the stage name &quot;Chiba Shinichi&quot; throughout his professional career. When New Line Cinema released the film in the United States in 1974, they retitled it &quot;The Street Fighter&quot; and billed its star as Sonny Chiba. Later, Chiba modified the name to &quot;JJ Sonny Chiba&quot;, wherein the initials stood for &quot;Justice Japan&quot;. After appearing in the taiga drama &quot;Fūrin Kazan&quot; in November 2007, he announced the retirement of the stage name &quot;Shinichi Chiba&quot;; henceforth he was billed &quot;JJ Sonny Chiba&quot; as an actor and as a film director.

== Early life ==

Chiba was born in Fukuoka, the third of five children. His father was a pilot for the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service; his mother, originally from Kumamoto Prefecture, had competed in track and field in her youth. When he was four years old, his father was transferred to Kisarazu, Chiba, and the family moved to Kimitsu, Chiba Prefecture.

After Chiba went to junior high school in Kimitsu, the physical education teacher advised him to do artistic gymnastics. He also was passionate about track and field sports, baseball, and volleyball. He participated in those four sports championships of Chiba Prefecture. In high school, Chiba dedicated himself to artistic gymnastics and won the National Sports Festival of Japan while in his third year. He enjoyed watching movies, including Western movies such as &quot;Shane&quot; and &quot;High Noon&quot;.

Chiba went to the Nippon Sport Science University in 1957. He was a serious candidate for a place in the Japanese Olympic team in his late teens until he was sidelined by a back injury. While he was a university student, he began studying martial arts with the renowned Kyokushin Karate master Masutatsu &quot;Mas&quot; Oyama (whom he later portrayed in a trilogy of films), which led to a first-degree black belt on 15 October 1965, later receiving a fourth-degree on 20 January 1984.

== Career ==
Sometime around 1960, he was discovered in a talent search (called &quot;New Face&quot;) by the Toei film studio, and he began his screen career soon after. The CEO of Toei at the time gave him the stage name &quot;Shinichi Chiba&quot;.

His acting career began on television, starring in two &quot;tokusatsu&quot; superhero shows, first replacing Susumu Wajima as the main character Kōtarō Ran/ Seven Color Mask in &quot;Seven Color Mask&quot; (&quot;Nana-iro kamen&quot;) in the second half of the series and then starring as Gorō Narumi/Messenger of Allah in &quot;Messenger of Allah&quot; (&quot;Allah no Shisha&quot;). He starred in the 1961 science fiction movie &quot;Invasion of the Neptune Men&quot; and the first Kinji Fukasaku film, &quot;Drifting Detective: Tragedy in the Red Valley&quot;, which marked the beginning of a long series of collaborations for the two. Over the next decade, he was cast primarily in crime thrillers. By 1970, Chiba had started his own training school for aspiring martial arts film actors and stunt performers known as , in order to develop the level of martial arts techniques and sequences used in Japanese film and television. Today the organization is known as Japan Action Enterprise (JAE). He starred in &quot;Karate Kiba&quot; (&quot;Bodyguard Kiba&quot;) in 1973, which was his first martial arts movie. Chiba&#x27;s breakthrough international hit was &quot;The Street Fighter&quot; (1974) which was brought to Western audiences (dubbed in English) by New Line Cinema. The film and its sequels established him as the reigning Japanese martial arts actor in international cinema for the next two decades. It was New Line Cinema founder Robert Shaye who gave Chiba the English name &quot;Sonny&quot;, which Chiba would adopt as his own (mostly for non-Japanese projects) from that point on.

Chiba&#x27;s subsequent projects included such pictures as &quot;The Bullet Train&quot; (1975), &quot;Karate Warriors&quot; (1976), &quot;Doberman Cop&quot; (1977), &quot;Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Assassin&quot; (1977). He also occasionally returned to the science fiction genre, in movies such as &quot;Message from Space&quot; (1978). He also began to star on some jidaigeki such as &quot;Shogun&#x27;s Samurai&quot; (1978), &quot;The Fall of Ako Castle&quot; (1978), &quot;G.I. Samurai&quot; (1979), &quot;Shadow Warriors&quot; (1980), and &quot;Samurai Reincarnation&quot; (1981). He was not only actor in but also stunt coordinator for &quot;G.I. Samurai&quot;, &quot;Burning Brave&quot; (1981), and &quot;Shogun&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1989). He was executive producer and director for &quot;Yellow Fangs&quot; (1990) and also directed and starred in &quot;Oyaji&quot; (2007).

Chiba portrayed Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi multiple times, first in the 1978 film &quot;Shogun&#x27;s Samurai&quot; and in its TV series remake &quot;The Yagyu Conspiracy&quot;, which aired from 1978 to 1979.
He then appeared as Jūbei in the TV series &quot;Yagyū Abaretabi&quot;, which aired from 1980 to 1981 and in the 1981 film Samurai Reincarnation (Makai Tensho) and its theatrical musical version &quot;Yagyu Jubei Makai Tensho&quot;. He then reprised his role as Jūbei in the second season of &quot;Yagyū Abaretabi&quot;, this time entitled &quot;Yagyū Jūbei Abaretabi&quot;, which aired from 1982 to 1983. A few years later he returned to play Jūbei in &quot;Iemitsu, Hikoza, and Isshin Tasuke: A National Crisis&quot;, a TV movie that aired in 1989. His final appearance as Jūbei was in 2 direct-to-DVD films entitled &quot;Sarutobi Sasuke and the Army of Darkness 3: Wind Chapter&quot; and &quot;Sarutobi Sasuke and the Army of Darkness 4: Fire Chapter&quot; in 2005. Other notable Japanese television roles for Chiba were the ninja leaders Hattori Hanzō III, Tsuge Shinpachi, Tarao Hanzō, and Hattori Hanzō XV across multiple seasons of the Shadow Warriors TV series and Hattori Hanzō I in the 2003 direct-to-DVD series follow-up &quot;Shin Kage no Gundan&quot; (New Shadow Warriors).

Chiba was even busier in the 1980s, doing dozens of movies as well as making forays into television, and with roles in such high-profile adventures as the popular Hong Kong comic-based movie &quot;The Storm Riders&quot; (1998), starring alongside Ekin Cheng and Aaron Kwok. His fame in Japan remained unabated into the 1990s.

In his fifties, the actor resumed working as a choreographer of martial arts sequences. At the dawn of the 21st century, Chiba was as busy as ever in feature films and also starring in his own series in Japan. Roles in Takashi Miike&#x27;s &quot;Deadly Outlaw: Rekka&quot; and his work with directors Kenta and Kinji Fukasaku in &quot;Battle Royale II&quot; effectively bridged the gap between modern day and yesteryear cinematic cult legends. Chiba&#x27;s enduring onscreen career received a tribute when he appeared in a key role as Hattori Hanzo, the owner of a sushi restaurant and retired samurai sword craftsman, in director Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s bloody revenge epic &quot;Kill Bill: Volume I&quot; in 2003.

Chiba starred in more than 125 films for Toei Studios and has won numerous awards in Japan for his acting.

== Personal life ==

In 1994 Chiba divorced his first wife, actress Yōko Nogiwa. Their daughter Juri Manase is also an actress.

He married Tamami Chiba in 1996, with whom he had a 28-year age difference.
They had two sons, and , who are both actors. Chiba and Tamami Chiba divorced in 2015.

Also in 2015, Weekly Shincho reported that Chiba was romantically involved with a 22-year old female university student. At the time, his divorce with Tamami Chiba was in the process of being finalized.

His younger brother, Jirō Yabuki (also known as Jiro Chiba), was also an actor.

== Death ==
In early August 2021, Chiba contracted COVID-19 (due to the highly contagious Delta variant). Initially, he was treated at home, but was hospitalized a few days later on 8 August when he developed pneumonia. He died at the hospital in Kisarazu, Chiba, on 19 August 2021, at the age of 82. He had not received double or triple vaccination, according to his agency. His body was cremated on 20 August after the private funeral.

==In Western popular culture==
Christian Slater&#x27;s character Clarence Worley in &quot;True Romance&quot; is a fan of Chiba. In a pivotal early scene, he watches a Sonny Chiba triple feature.

The writer of &quot;True Romance&quot;, Quentin Tarantino, worked with Chiba ten years later in &quot;Kill Bill: Volume I&quot;, in which Chiba portrayed &quot;Katana&quot; master maker Hattori Hanzō in a vignette that combined comical interaction with his assistant, played by Kenji Ohba, with sombre references to traditional, Japanese sword making.

A modified version of the opening scroll to the English-language version of 1973 movie &quot;Karate Kiba&quot; (English title: &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;) was used in the script of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 1994 movie &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Tarantino&#x27;s script changed the Ezekiel 25:17 speech, swapping out &quot;I am Chiba the Bodyguard&quot; for &quot;my name is the Lord&quot;.

The character Takayuki Chiba from the &quot;shōnen&quot; manga series &quot;Kengan Ashura&quot; is based on Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada.

== Martial arts ranks ==
Chiba held black belts in the following martial arts:
* Kyokushin Karate: 4th Dan
* Togakure-ryū Ninpō Taijutsu: 4th Dan
* Goju-ryu karate: 2nd Dan
* Shorinji Kempo: 2nd Dan

<doc id="415200" wikidata="Q5123248" url="?curid=415200" title="City Island, Bronx">
<text>City Island is a neighborhood in the northeastern Bronx in New York City, located on an island of the same name approximately long by wide. City Island is located at the extreme western end of Long Island Sound, south of Pelham Bay Park, and east of Eastchester Bay.

At one time the island was incorporated within the boundaries of the town of Pelham in Westchester County, New York, but the island has been part of New York City since the late 19th century. City Island is part of the Pelham Islands, a group of islands that once belonged to Thomas Pell. The body of water between City Island and the even smaller, uninhabited Hart Island to the east is known as City Island Harbor. The small island adjacent to the northeast is High Island. The Stepping Stones Light, marking the main shipping channel into New York, is off the southern tip of City Island, near the Long Island shore.

As of the 2020 Census, the island had a population of 4,417. Its land area is . The island is part of Bronx Community District 10, and its ZIP Code is 10464.

== History ==

Prior to European colonization, the island now known as City Island was inhabited by Native Americans, possibly the Wiechquaeskeck band of the Lenape people who left shell middens indicating that they had gathered, cooked, and consumed oysters and clams on the island. The island was part of a very large property, about 50,000 acres, to which the English physician Thomas Pell established ownership in a treaty signed by five Lenape sachems in 1654.The island—known by different names including Minnewits, Minneford, Minefer&#x27;s, Great Mulberry Island—was purchased in 1761 by Benjamin Palmer of New York, who planned to make it a major seaport in western Long Island Sound. Palmer changed the name to New City Island, later dropping the “New.”

Up to this point the island had been inhabited by only a few homes and farms. It had a population of about 1000 people, who tended farms and livestock. Palmer had the vision of developing the island into a port, which could rival that of New York. He knew that ships heading north and south passed City Island using Long Island Sound as a safe inshore waterway. He envisioned shipyards, and stores that could cater to the ships. He went as far as to have the island mapped out in different plots designated as shipyards, docks, business, farms, homes, schools, and houses of worship, along with streets, paths, and access routes. Benjamin Palmer appealed to the British Crown and received letters patent that covered the ownership of waterfront properties 400 feet out from the high tide mark under water and around the perimeter of the Island. This patent, known as the &quot;Palmer Grant&quot; is unique to City Island; it has been contested in courts since, but has always been upheld.

Palmer also is responsible for changing the name from Minefer&#x27;s Island to City Island in anticipation of things to come. Palmer&#x27;s vision never fully materialized, however, as the timing just before the American Revolution halted all progress, and the war depleted the capital of Palmer and his investors. It would be another sixty years before the island again started to be developed when oystermen, pilots of Hell Gate, a set of nearby narrows, and eventually shipbuilders arrived and introduced these industries.

In 1819, City Island was annexed to the town of Pelham, Westchester County. It narrowly voted to become a part of New York City in 1895, in exchange for a new bridge to the mainland, and was consolidated as part of the Bronx in 1898. The island continued to host harbor defenses through the early 20th century. In the mid-20th century, City Island developed as a shipbuilding community, before becoming a daytrippers&#x27; destination. City Island has generally remained sparsely developed with a suburban feel. A 43-unit condo complex called On the Sound, built in 2015, was the first major residential project on the island since around 2000.

According to local tradition, anyone actually born on the island is known as a &quot;clam digger&quot;. A City Island resident not born on the island is known as a &quot;mussel sucker&quot;.

== Demographics ==

For census purposes, the New York City government classifies City Island as part of a larger neighborhood tabulation area called Pelham Bay-Country Club-City Island. As of the 2020 Census, the island had a population of 4,417.

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Pelham Bay-Country Club-City Island was 26,583, a decrease of 557 (2.1%) from the 27,140 counted in 2000.

== Land use ==

Most businesses are clustered along the central City Island Avenue. There is one small supermarket, a gas station, a bank, a hardware store and a variety of other small shops. The island is most famous for its numerous seafood restaurants and antique stores, which line both sides of the avenue.

At the southernmost section of City Island is Belden Point, named for William Belden, a developer who opened an amusement park and resort in the area in 1887. In the early part of the 20th century, the area was a favored recreation location for business tycoons including Vincent Astor, J.P. Morgan and William Randolph Hearst. Today, Belden Point is home to a number of popular seafood restaurants. A new public greenspace was dedicated in 2016 at its waterfront tip.

In 1960 City Island became the last community in New York City to get dial telephone service. Until then eight operators in a private home on Schofield Street connected all calls. The dial exchange began as Area Code 212-TT5. Now Area Code 718–885.

=== Geology ===
City Island was created by glacial deposits at the end of the last ice age. There is a layer of bedrock and then a thick layer of red clay topped with sand, with topsoil above that. The southern end has deposits of rare blue clay. The area is strewn with glacial erratic boulders. Local bedrock is Manhattan schist with glacial striations.

=== Endemic wildlife ===
The forms of animal life on the island are not much different from that of the surrounding region, and are typical of a suburban environment: raccoons, squirrels, rabbits, skunk, and occasional deer. Coyotes and turkeys have also been sighted.

The real diversity of wildlife on and around City Island is among birds, especially aquatic species. There are many varieties of duck; buffleheads, goldeneyes, mallards, and cormorants. Canada geese are common, as are mute swans, great blue herons, great white egrets, and several types of gull. A small protected wetlands area on west Ditmars Street is home to many of these species as well as the feral pigeon.

Bright green parrots (monk parakeets), originally imported from South America as pets, have adapted to the climate and breed in the wild in New York. They are a common sight on City Island and in nearby Pelham Bay Park. Rafters of wild turkeys also are often seen in the park. Deer are occasionally seen on the island, although more commonly in Pelham Bay Park. Another, nonnative species of the island is the brown or De Kay&#x27;s snake, which has adapted to life among the island&#x27;s growing community.

==Activities==
=== Local points of interest ===
The island is famous for its seafood restaurants; lobster is a popular specialty. Over 30 eating establishments compete for business, ranging from fast food (Johnny&#x27;s Reef), to The Black Whale, famous for its desserts. While a few of the restaurants close during the winter months, most are open year-round.

The City Island Nautical Museum displays maritime artifacts and antiques. It is located at 190 Fordham Street and is open only on Saturday and Sunday afternoons (other times by appointment). Admission is eight dollars, and there is a small gift shop. The museum is located in the PS17 building, a historic school building built in 1897 before the City Island Bridge.

The island has landmarks, such as the Samuel Pell Mansion on City Island Avenue, near St. Mary Star of the Sea Church. It is where &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; was filmed for TV in 1969. There are a number of old Victorian mansions located throughout City Island, mostly on the Sound side, complete with tall pointy spires and gables with gazebos, such as Delmours Point on Tier Street.

The City Island Theater Group, a local community theater established in 1999, produces shows year round.

=== Boating ===

The island has three yacht clubs situated on the Eastchester Bay side of the island. They are, from north to south, the Harlem Yacht Club, the City Island Yacht Club, and the Morris Yacht and Beach Club. The Touring Kayak Club is on the west side of the island. Barron&#x27;s Boatyard, the North Minneford Yacht Club and the South Minneford Yacht Club are on the east side of the island. There are two active sail lofts (UK-Halsey and Doyle). The island also has several commercial marinas.

The island has what are called &quot;special anchorages&quot; where boats of all sizes are freely moored or anchored, and there are many docks with boat slips for mooring boats in a secure and restricted way. There are also many large piers around the island that can receive large ships.

The island is home to the Columbia University Sailing Team, whose fleet of dinghies is docked at City Island Yacht Club. The team comes from Manhattan four times a week to practice off the western shore of City Island. Fordham University&#x27;s Sailing Team sails out of Morris Yacht and Beach Club. Many of the boats which competed and won in the America&#x27;s Cup in years past were built in the Nevins Boat Yard on City Island. The Eastchester Bay Yacht Racing Association is the major organizer for sailboat races in the area. J/24 sailboats are the one active design racing fleet on the island.

A small fleet of head boats takes paying passengers on fishing trips to Long Island Sound. Smaller boats are also available for rent by the day. The sail and power boating industry has been declining in recent years, as boatyards are being sold and being converted into condominiums. Abandoned boats sometimes wash up around City Island and Pelham Bay, in part due to the high cost of maintaining a boat.

Community District 10&#x27;s rate of elementary school student absenteeism is slightly higher than the rest of New York City. In Community District 10, 21% of elementary school students missed twenty or more days per school year, a little more than the citywide average of 20%. Additionally, 75% of high school students in Community District 10 graduate on time, the same as the citywide average of 75%.

===Schools===

The public school on City Island is operated by the New York City Department of Education. PS 175, located on City Island Avenue, serves grades K-8 for the island.

The School of St. Mary Star of the Sea was a Roman Catholic grade school, serving grades PreK-8 on City Island, until it closed in the end of the 2012–2013 school year. The church operated Holy Rosary Early Childhood Academy at St. Mary Star Of The Sea until its closure in 2010.

The former Public School 17 houses the City Island Historical Society and Nautical Museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

===Library===
The New York Public Library (NYPL)&#x27;s City Island branch is located at 320 City Island Avenue. The branch has been operating since 1903, but moved to its current building in 1970; a renovation in 1997 doubled the size of the branch. The City Island branch contains a &quot;ship collection&quot; of over a thousand ship-related media, as well as a collection of materials about City Island&#x27;s history.

== Religion ==
The religious communities on the island are relatively diverse for its size. There are four houses of worship: Saint Mary Star of the Sea Holy Roman Catholic Church, Trinity United Methodist Church, Grace Episcopal Church, and Temple Beth El (founded in 1934), a non-denominational liberal synagogue.

== Transportation ==

Starting in 1760, a small rope ferry ran between the mainland and City Island. In 1873 a bridge was built by a syndicate of City Island businessmen, including G.W. Horton, Ben Hedgeman, and David Carll. It was replaced by steel, three-lane City Island Bridge in 1901. In 2014, the New York City Department of Transportation had proposed replacing it with a cable-stayed bridge hanging from a 160-foot tower but the design faced intense community opposition and the city submitted a redesign which was approved. A temporary bridge was used from December 2015 until October 2017 which allowed for the demolition of the old bridge and the construction of its replacement. The New City Island Causeway Bridge opened to traffic on October 29, 2017.

There is another small, private bridge on the northeastern end of City Island connecting it to High Island, site of the radio transmitter for WFAN (660 AM) and WCBS (880 AM). A security gate prevents public access.

The Pelham Park &amp; City Island Railway connected City Island to Pelham Bay Park from 1887 to 1919. Originally composed of two separate railroads, the narrow-gauge horsecar route was operated by the Pelham Park Railroad Company, which ran service between the Bartow station of the Harlem River &amp; Port Chester Railroad and Brown&#x27;s Hotel on City Island. The route was complete by 1892. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which operated part of the modern-day New York City Subway, absorbed the two companies in 1902 and started designing its own monorail in 1908. The monorail&#x27;s first journey in July 1910 ended with the monorail toppling on its side. Although service resumed in November 1910, the monorail went into receivership in December 1911, and the monorail ceased operation on April 3, 1914. In July 1914, the IRT sold the company to the Third Avenue Railway, which ceased operation of the City Island Railroad on August 9, 1919.

, the only public transportation to City Island consists of two bus routes operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The island is served by MTA Regional Bus Operations&#x27;s Bx29 local route, which operates to the New York City Subway&#x27;s Pelham Bay Park station, and two rush-hour extended round-trips of the BxM8 express route, which runs to Manhattan.

The Bronx Tourism Council ran the City Island Seaside Trolley, which later became a ferry service. This ferry service was retired in 2020. In the 2020s, residents of City Island have advocated for a NYC Ferry stop in the neighborhood, although NYC Ferry had no plans to expand there. Supporters of the NYC Ferry proposal said that additional ferry service would alleviate traffic to and from the neighborhood, though a 2019 feasibility study found that a ferry route to City Island would have few riders.

<text>Ian Bruce Lang, Baron Lang of Monkton, PC DL (born 27 June 1940) is a British Conservative Party politician and Life Peer who served as the Member of Parliament for Galloway, and then Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, from 1979 to 1997.

On 29 September 1997 Lang was raised to the peerage. He was an active member of the House of Lords until his retirement on 30 June 2022, including being the Chairman of the Constitution Committee. He also served as Chair of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments from 2009 to 2014.

==Early life==
Lang was educated at Lathallan School, at Rugby School from 1954 to 1958, and at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, from 1959 to 1962, where he obtained a BA (Hons.) degree in history. He was also a member of the Cambridge Footlights.

==Parliamentary career==
Lang first stood for Parliament for Central Ayrshire in 1970, but was unsuccessful. In the February 1974 general election he was defeated by Labour&#x27;s James White contesting Glasgow Pollok.

Following this he became MP for Galloway from 1979 to 1983 and for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale from 1983 to 1997, and was a minister for a number of years. He served as Assistant Government Whip from 1981 to 1983 and as Government Whip from 1983 to 1986, before becoming Under-Secretary of State for Employment in 1986. He then served as Under-Secretary of State for Scotland from 1986 to 1987, before rising to the position of Minister of State for Scotland, which he held from 1987 to 1990. Lang then joined the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Scotland from 1990 to 1995, before becoming the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and President of the Board of Trade from 1995 until 1997. He was closely involved in John Major&#x27;s re-election campaign as leader of the Conservative Party in July 1995.

Lang lost his seat in the 1997 general election, one of seven Cabinet members to do so (the others being Malcolm Rifkind, Michael Portillo, Michael Forsyth, Roger Freeman, William Waldegrave and Tony Newton).

==House of Lords==

Following the loss of his seat, Lang was raised to the peerage in the 1997 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours as Baron Lang of Monkton, &quot;of Merrick and the Rhinns of Kells in Dumfries and Galloway&quot;. He has remained an active member of the House of Lords, including being Chairman of the Constitution Committee between 2014 and 2017.

Previously Lang served as Chair of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments from 2009 to 2014.

Since 1997, Lang has been a member of the board of directors of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, becoming Chairman in May 2011. Lang has also been a Non-Executive Director of Charlemagne Capital Limited since 2006, and Deputy Chairman of European Telecom PLC since 1997.

On 30 January 2014 Lang stated that if Scotland voted for independence, it would dishonour the sacrifice of those who died fighting for Great Britain in the First World War.

<doc id="415206" wikidata="Q285946" url="?curid=415206" title="Tmpfs">
<text>tmpfs (short for Temporary File System) is a temporary file storage paradigm implemented in many Unix-like operating systems. It is intended to appear as a mounted file system, but data is stored in volatile memory instead of a persistent storage device.

The idea behind tmpfs is similar in concept to a RAM disk, in that both provide a file system stored in volatile memory; however, the implementations are different. While tmpfs is implemented at the &quot;logical file system&quot; layer, a RAM disk is implemented at the &quot;physical file system&quot; layer. In other words, a RAM disk is a virtual block device with a normal file system running on top of it, while tmpfs is a virtual file system without any underlying block device.

== Semantics ==
Everything stored in tmpfs is temporary in the sense that no files will be directly created on non-volatile storage such as a hard drive (although swap space is used as backing store according to the page replacement policy of the operating system). On reboot, everything in tmpfs will be lost.

The memory used by tmpfs grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it contains.

Many Unix distributions enable and use tmpfs by default for the branch of the file system or for shared memory. This can be observed with as in this example:

 Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
 tmpfs 256M 688K 256M 1% /tmp

Some Linux distributions (e.g. Debian) do not have a tmpfs mounted on by default; in this case, files under will be stored in the same file system as .

And on almost all Linux distributions, a tmpfs is mounted on or to store temporary run-time files such as PID files and Unix domain sockets.

== Implementations ==

There are several independent variants of the tmpfs concept. One of the earliest was developed by Sun Microsystems for SunOS, and other operating systems like the BSDs and Linux provided their own.

=== SunOS ===
SunOS 4 includes what is most likely the earliest implementation of tmpfs; it first appeared in SunOS 4.0 in late 1987, together with new orthogonal address space management that allowed any object to be memory mapped.

The Solaris directory was made a tmpfs file system by default starting with Solaris 2.1, released in December 1992. Output for the Solaris command will show &quot;swap&quot; as the background storage for any tmpfs volume:

 # df -k
 Filesystem kbytes used avail capacity Mounted on
 swap 601592 0 601592 0% /tmp/test

=== Linux ===
tmpfs is supported by the Linux kernel beginning in version 2.4 (January 4, 2001). Linux tmpfs (previously known as shm fs) is based on the ramfs code used during bootup and also uses the page cache, but, unlike ramfs, it supports swapping out less-used pages to swap space, as well as filesystem size and inode limits to prevent out-of-memory situations (defaulting to half of physical RAM and half the number of RAM pages, respectively).

=== BSD ===
4.2BSD introduced MFS, a memory-based file system implemented by applying the existing FFS disk filesystem to a virtual memory region.

tmpfs, a memory filesystem implemented using conventional in-memory data structures in order to improve on the performance of MFS, was merged into the official NetBSD source tree on September 10, 2005; it is available in 4.0 and later versions.

FreeBSD has ported NetBSD&#x27;s implementation, where it is available in 7.0 and later versions.

DragonFly BSD has also ported NetBSD&#x27;s implementation, where it is available in 2.5.1 and later versions.

OpenBSD ported NetBSD&#x27;s tmpfs implementation as well, initially started by Pedro Martelletto and improved by many others. It was enabled in builds from December 17, 2013. The first release of OpenBSD with tmpfs included was 5.5. OpenBSD 6.0 disabled tmpfs due to lack of maintenance.

=== Microsoft Windows ===
In Microsoft Windows, creating files using the flag will cause file systems to avoid writing data back to non-volatile storage if sufficient cache memory is available.

== Advantages ==
Due to the higher speeds of RAM compared to disk storage, tmpfs allows cache to be much faster when stored in one, leading to a more efficient overall system, though operating systems with a page cache will see less benefit as recently-used file pages will remain in-memory if free memory is sufficient. Since RAM is cleared upon reboot, tmpfs prevents systems from becoming too cluttered without requiring that the user manually delete temporary files. In addition, storing files in RAM prevents disks from filling up too quickly and extends the life of flash-based storage by reducing the number of writes.

== Disadvantages ==
On systems without swap space, or where swap space is running low, tmpfs may consume large amounts of memory.

If cache files are stored in tmpfs, programs will lose their cached data across reboots.

<text>The Penny Post is any one of several postal systems in which normal letters could be sent for one penny. Five such schemes existed in the United Kingdom while the United States initiated at least three such simple fixed rate postal arrangements.

==United Kingdom==
===London Penny Post===
In England, the postal service, from 1660 General Post Office, had developed into a monopoly, affirmed by Oliver Cromwell in 1654, for the collection and carriage of letters between post towns, however, there was no delivery system until William Dockwra and his partner Robert Murray established the London Penny Post in 1680. They set up a local post that used a uniform rate of one old penny for delivery of letters and packets weighing up to one pound within the cities of Westminster and London as well as in Southwark. Several deliveries took place a day within the city, and items were also delivered to addresses up to ten miles outside London for an extra charge of one penny. In 1683 Dockwra was forced to surrender the Penny Post to the English Crown for circulating what were considered seditious newsletters sharply criticizing the Duke of York, who was in charge of and directly benefited from the General Post Office.

===Local Penny Post===
In 1765, Parliament authorized the creation of Penny Posts in any town or city of the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland. The single postage rate of one penny was charged within the area, calculated by weight. By the beginning of the 19th century there were many of these, identifiable on covers, with markings such as &quot;PP&quot;, &quot;Py Post&quot;, or &quot;Penny Post&quot; along with the name of the town.

The early penny post system in Edinburgh, founded in 1773/4 by Peter Williamson, known as &quot;Indian Peter,&quot; usefully combined it with one of the world&#x27;s first street directories. He circulated mail to 17 shops in the city (effectively post offices) and employed four uniformed postmen. Their hats read &quot;Penny Post&quot; and were numbered 1, 4, 8 and 16 to make the business look bigger.

===Uniform Penny Post===

On 5 December 1839 the Uniform Fourpenny Post was introduced by the General Post Office but lasted only 36 days until 9 January 1840 when the Uniform Penny Post replaced it. 
In 1835 Rowland Hill published a pamphlet entitled &#x27;Post Office Reform&#x27; which led to various reforms and the introduction of the first postage stamp. He convinced Parliament to implement much needed reforms in the current postal system. On 10 January 1840, the Uniform Penny Post was established throughout Great Britain and Ireland, facilitating the safe, speedy and cheap conveyance of letters. Hill had demonstrated that the current system was inefficient and slow and not cost effective. Time was wasted when the postman waited at each house to collect payment. From 6 May 1840, letters could be prepaid with the first postage stamp, known as the Penny Black for up to a half ounce in weight, otherwise they would be charged twopence as unpaid letters or required additional postage. The use of prepaid postage through adhesive stamps revolutionized the postal service. While the Post Office was initially skeptical, the new system proved to be a resounding success, leading to greater efficiency, speed, and profitability. 

===Ocean Penny Post===
Elihu Burritt proposed that a fixed rate of one penny be established for all mail throughout the entire British Empire as a means of facilitating international interaction and international unity. This was known as the Ocean Penny Post.

===Imperial Penny Post===
On Christmas Day, 1898, the Imperial Penny Post extended the rate throughout the British Empire except for Australia and New Zealand, who would not benefit from it until 1905. In 1908 it was extended to America.

The Penny Post rate ended in Great Britain in 1918.

==United States==

In the United States, Spaulding&#x27;s Penny Post operated in Buffalo, New York from 1847 to 1850.

Davis&#x27; Penny Post operated in Baltimore, Maryland for several weeks of February 1856, leaving behind a handful of rare stamps.

The Penny Post is the journal of the Carriers and Locals Society, and was also the original name of &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot;.

<text>The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) is a British right-wing free market think tank, which is registered as a charity. Associated with the New Right, the IEA describes itself as an &quot;educational research institute&quot;, and says that it seeks to &quot;further the dissemination of free-market thinking&quot; by &quot;analysing and expounding the role of markets in solving economic and social problems&quot;.

The IEA subscribes to a neoliberal world view and advocates positions based on this ideology. It published climate change denial material between 1994 and 2007. It has advocated for privatisation of, and abolition of complete government control of, the National Health Service (NHS), in favour of a healthcare system with market mechanisms. It has received more than £70,000 from the tobacco industry, although it does not reveal its funders, and an IEA director was recorded offering a prospective supporter introductions to policy makers, referred to as &quot;cash for access&quot;. The IEA is headquartered in Westminster, London.

Founded by businessman and battery farming pioneer Antony Fisher in 1955, the IEA was one of the first modern think tanks, and promoted Thatcherite right-wing ideology, and free market and monetarist economic policies. The IEA has been criticised for operating in a manner closer to that of a lobbying operation than as a genuine think tank. The IEA publishes a journal (&quot;Economic Affairs&quot;), a student magazine (&quot;EA&quot;), books and discussion papers, and holds regular lectures.

==History==
In 1945 Antony Fisher read an article in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; that was a summary of &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; by Friedrich Hayek. Later that year, Fisher visited Hayek at the London School of Economics. Hayek dissuaded Fisher from embarking on a political and parliamentary career to try to prevent the spread of socialism and central planning. Instead, Hayek suggested the establishment of a body that could engage in research and reach the intellectuals with reasoned argument, saying that a think tank would have far more &quot;decisive influence in the great battle of ideas&quot;. Set up by Fisher and Oliver Smedley, the IEA was thus founded after Hayek had suggested that an intellectual counterweight through think tanks was necessary to combat the prevailing post-war consensus around Keynesianism and the Butskellism of Rab Butler and Hugh Gaitskell. Fisher, Smedley, and others were successful in building the IEA and its affiliates of Atlas Network into a bastion of free-market economics and neoliberalism, which supplanted the post-war Keynesian paradigm.

The IEA&#x27;s first location was a cramped, £3-a-week room with one table and chair at Oliver Smedley&#x27;s General Management Services, which housed various free-trade organisations at 4 Austin Friars, a few dozen yards from the Stock Exchange in the heart of the City of London. In June 1955, &quot;The Free Convertibility of Sterling&quot; by George Winder was published, with Fisher signing the foreword as Director of the IEA. In November 1955 the IEA&#x27;s Original Trust Deed was signed by Fisher, Smedley, and John Harding. Ralph Harris (later Lord Harris) began work as part-time General Director in January 1957. He was joined in 1958 by Arthur Seldon who was initially appointed Editorial Advisor and became the editorial director in 1959. Smedley wrote to Fisher that it was &quot;imperative that we should give no indication in our literature that we are working to educate the public along certain lines which might be interpreted as having a political bias. ... That is why the first draft [of the IEA&#x27;s aims] is written in rather cagey terms&quot;. 

The Social Affairs Unit was established in December 1980 as an offshoot of the Institute of Economic Affairs to carry the IEA&#x27;s economic ideas onto the battleground of sociology. &quot;Within a few years the Social Affairs Unit became independent from the IEA, acquiring its own premises.&quot; In 1986 the IEA created a Health and Welfare Unit to focus on these aspects of social policy. Discussing the IEA&#x27;s increasing influence under the Conservative government in the 1980s in relation to the &quot;advent of Thatcherism&quot; and the privatisation of public services, Dieter Plehwe, a Research Fellow at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center, has written that &quot;[t]he arguably most influential think tank in British history ... benefited from the close alignment of IEA&#x27;s neoliberal agenda with corporate interests and the priorities of the Thatcher government.

During the 1990s the IEA began to focus its research on the effects of regulation, and began a student outreach programme. Free-market publications continued to be the core activity of the IEA. Oliver Letwin said of the organisation in 1994: &quot;without the IEA and its clones, no Thatcher and quite possibly no Reagan; without Reagan, no Star Wars; without Star Wars, no economic collapse of the Soviet Union. Quite a chain of consequences for a chicken farmer!&quot; In 2007 British journalist Andrew Marr called the IEA &quot;undoubtedly the most influential think tank in modern British history&quot;. Damien Cahill, a professor of Political Economy at the University of Sydney, has characterised the IEA as, &quot;Britain&#x27;s oldest and leading neoliberal think tank&quot;. In October 2009 the IEA appointed Mark Littlewood as its Director General, with effect from 1 December 2009. In September 2022 an associated think tank, the Free Market Forum, was founded. In December 2023 Mark Littlewood stood down as the IEA&#x27;s Director General and was replaced by Tom Clougherty under the title of Executive Director.

==Purpose and aims==
In 2018 the IEA&#x27;s then-director Mark Littlewood said &quot;We want to totally reframe the debate about the proper role of the state and civil society in our country ... Our true mission is to change the climate of opinion.&quot; While there is no corporate view, and while the IEA has a tradition of welcoming discussion, debate, and papers from those on the left, the IEA promotes the market and has two prominent themes in its publications: first, a belief in limited government and, second, &quot;the technical (and moral) superiority of markets and competitive pricing in the allocation of scarce resources.&quot;

The IEA is described as a &quot;university without students&quot; because its primary target is not politicians but &quot;the gatekeepers of ideas&quot;, namely the intellectuals, academics, and journalists. The IEA believe that a change in the intellectual climate is a pre-condition for any ideological shift within political parties or government institutions. The IEA has written policy papers arguing against government funding for pressure groups and charities involved in political campaigning. The IEA does not receive government funding. As a registered charity, the IEA must abide by Charity Commission rules, that state that &quot;an organisation will not be charitable if its purposes are political&quot;. In July 2018, the Charity Commission announced that it was to investigate whether the IEA had broken its rules.

The investigation concluded that one of the IEA&#x27;s reports on Brexit was too political. The regulator thus asked the IEA to remove the report from its website in early November 2018 and issued an official warning in February 2019. It required trustees to provide written assurances that the IEA would not engage in campaigning or political activity contravening legal or regulatory requirements. The IEA removed the report on 19 November and said it complied with the commission&#x27;s other guidance by 23 November. IEA trustees were also required to set up a system whereby research reports and launch plans are signed off by trustees. Following the IEA&#x27;s compliance, the Charity Commission withdrew the official warning in June 2019. A compliance case into the IEA remained open, examining concerns about the trustees&#x27; management and oversight of the charity&#x27;s activities.

The IEA supports privatising the National Health Service (NHS) with repeated calls to replace the NHS with an insurance-based health system in the UK; campaigns against controls on junk food; attacks trades unions; and defends zero-hour contracts, unpaid internships and tax havens. IEA staff are frequently invited by the BBC and other news media to appear on broadcasts. The IEA also published, between 1994 and 2007, &quot;at least four books, as well as multiple articles and papers, ... suggesting manmade climate change may be uncertain or exaggerated [and that] climate change is either not significantly driven by human activity or will be positive&quot;, according to an October 2019 &quot;Guardian&quot; article. Specifically, in 2003, the IEA published the book &quot;Climate Alarmism Reconsidered&quot; which concluded that government intervention in the name of sustainability is the major threat to energy sustainability and the provision of affordable, reliable energy to growing economies worldwide. It further advocated that free-market structures and the wealth generated by markets help communities to best adapt to climate change.

===Concerns about political independence; investigation===
&quot;The Observer&quot; reported on 29 July 2018 that the director of the IEA was secretly recorded in May and June. He was recorded telling an undercover reporter that funders could get to know ministers on first-name terms and that his organisation was in &quot;the Brexit influencing game&quot;. While seeking funding, Littlewood said that the IEA allowed donors to affect the &quot;salience&quot; of reports and to shape &quot;substantial content&quot;. The recording was to be given to the Charity Commission on 30 July.

The Charity Commission, considering that the allegations raised by the recordings were &quot;of a serious nature&quot;, on 20 July 2018 opened a regulatory compliance case into the IEA due to concerns about its political independence. Previously, it had become known that the IEA offered potential US donors access to ministers while raising funds for research to promote free-trade deals favoured by proponents of a &quot;hard Brexit&quot;. The commission has powers to examine IEA financial records, legally compel it to provide information, and disqualify trustees. The IEA denies it has breached charity law. It was also revealed that, after the IEA published a report recommending more casinos, the casino industry donated £8,000 to the IEA.

Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, welcoming the investigation into the IEA, said &quot;on the road to Brexit, a small group of establishment figures, funded to the tune of millions, are covertly pursuing a political campaign in favour of extreme free trade, acting in effect as lobbyists for secretive corporate interests ... there are serious questions that high-ranking Conservative ministers must now answer about their dealings with the IEA.&quot; It was also revealed that Jersey Finance, representing financial interests in Jersey, paid for an IEA report saying that tax havens (such as Jersey) benefited the wider economy, and did not diminish tax revenues in other countries. The report recommended that their status be protected. The IEA did not disclose the funding from Jersey Finance. A similar IEA report about neighbouring Guernsey was funded by the financial services industry there. Following this, the IEA said that the funding they received never influenced the conclusions of reports, and that their output was independent and free from conflict of interest. Separately, the register of lobbyists concluded in 2019 that the IEA had not participated in consultant lobbying for E Foundation.

====Freer launch====
In March 2018 the IEA offshoot &quot;Freer&quot; was founded to promote a positive message of liberal, supply-side Conservative renewal. Freer held two meetings at the 2018 Conservative conference (with none in any other political parties&#x27; conferences), and remains entirely within the IEA&#x27;s structural and organisational control. Cabinet ministers and MPs (including Michael Gove and Liz Truss) spoke at the organisation&#x27;s launch. Truss called for a neoliberal &quot;Tory revolution&quot; spearheaded by &quot;Uber-riding, Airbnb-ing, Deliveroo-eating freedom-fighters&quot;, comments which were criticised by the &quot;Morning Star&quot; for failing to take into consideration the quality of employment within the companies mentioned. Conservative blogger Paul Staines said that the launch &quot;piqued the interest of senior ministers including Michael Gove, Dom Raabb and Brexit brain Shanker Singham&quot;. As of early 2019, the organisation had 24 parliamentary supporters, including prominent figures such as Truss, Chris Skidmore, Priti Patel, Ben Bradley, and Kemi Badenoch, all of whom are Conservative MPs. Freer also holds events and publishes pamphlets for Conservative MPs, and has been referred to the Charity Commission by &quot;Private Eye&quot; for political bias.

==Funding==
The IEA is a registered educational and research charity. The organisation states that it is funded by &quot;voluntary donations from individuals, companies and foundations who want to support its work, plus income from book sales and conferences&quot;, and says that it is &quot;independent of any political party or group&quot;. The Charity Commission listed total income of £2.34 million and expenditure of £2.33 million for the financial year ending 31 March 2021.

The IEA policy is to allow donors to choose whether or not to disclose their funding. Some publish their grants to the IEA; others do not. It has been criticised for receiving minor funding (less than 5% of revenue) from major tobacco companies whilst campaigning on tobacco industry issues. British American Tobacco (BAT) confirmed it had donated £40,000 to the IEA in 2013, £20,000 in 2012 and £10,000 in 2011, and Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International also confirmed they provide financial support to the IEA. In 2002, a leaked letter revealed that a prominent IEA member, the right-wing writer Roger Scruton, had authored an IEA pamphlet attacking the World Health Organisation&#x27;s campaign on tobacco, whilst failing to disclose that he was receiving £54,000 a year from Japan Tobacco International. In response, the IEA said it would introduce an author declaration policy. The IEA also says that it &quot;accepts no tied funding&quot;.

An organisation called American Friends of the IEA had received US$215,000 as of 2010 from the U.S.-based Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund, donor-advised funds which support right-wing causes. The think tank Transparify, which is funded by the Open Society Foundations, in 2015 ranked the IEA as one of the top three least transparent think tanks in the UK in relation to funding. The IEA responded by saying &quot;It is a matter for individual donors whether they wish their donation to be public or private – we leave that entirely to their discretion&quot;, and that it has not &quot;earmarked money for commissioned research work from any company&quot;.

Funding to the IEA from the alcohol industry, food industry, and sugar industry has also been documented. IEA Research Fellow Christopher Snowdon disclosed alcohol industry funding in a response to a &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; article in 2014. In October 2018, an investigation by Greenpeace found that the IEA was also receiving funding from the oil giant BP, which was &quot;[using] this access to press ministers on issues ranging from environmental and safety standards to British tax rates.&quot; In May 2019, the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; revealed that British American Tobacco was continuing to fund the IEA. In November 2022, the funding transparency website Who Funds You? rated the institute as E, the lowest transparency rating (rating goes from A to E). This was updated to a D rating in December 2023.

==Reception==
In early 2019, on national radio station LBC, James O&#x27;Brien called the IEA a politically motivated lobbying organisation funded by &quot;dark money&quot; of &quot;questionable provenance, with dubious ideas and validity&quot;, staffed by people who are not proper experts on their topic. The IEA complained to the UK media regulator Ofcom that those remarks were inaccurate and unfair. In August 2021, Ofcom rejected the complaint.

==Publications==

Arthur Seldon proposed a series of Papers for economists to explore the neoliberal approach to the issues of the day. Eventually, these emerged as the Hobart Papers; 154 had been published by August 2006. In addition, 32 Hobart Paperbacks had been released along with 139 Occasional Papers, 61 Readings and 61 Research Monographs. They published &quot;The Denationalization of Money&quot; by Hayek in 1977.

===Research===
According to the IEA, although not an academic body, the institute&#x27;s research activities are aided by an international Academic Advisory Council and a panel of Honorary Fellows. The IEA&#x27;s work is generally more theoretical than political, and has a refereeing process for all its publications. They note that their papers are subjected to the same refereeing process used by academic journals, and that the views expressed in IEA papers are those of the authors and not of the IEA, its trustees, directors, or advisors. The IEA has also published research in areas including business ethics, economic development, education, pensions, regulation, taxation, and transport.

<text>Kid Creole and the Coconuts is an American musical group created by August Darnell with Andy Hernandez and Adriana Kaegi. Its music incorporates a variety of styles and influences, in particular a mix of disco and Latin American, Caribbean, and Calloway styles conceptually inspired by the big band era. The Coconuts are a trio of female backing vocalists/dancers, founded and originally choreographed and costumed by Kaegi.

==Career==
Thomas August Darnell Browder was born in The Bronx, New York City on August 12, 1950. His mother was from South Carolina with Caribbean and Italian parents and his father from Savannah, Georgia. As an adult, Browder began going by his two middle names as August Darnell.

Growing up in the Bronx, Darnell was exposed early on to all kinds of music. Darnell began his musical career in a band named The In-Laws with his brother, Stony Browder, in 1965. The band disbanded so Darnell could pursue a career as an English teacher. Darnell obtained a master&#x27;s degree in English, but in 1974 again formed a band with his brother under the name Dr. Buzzard&#x27;s Original Savannah Band. Their self-titled debut release was a Top 40-charting album which was certified gold and was nominated for a Grammy.

Darnell began producing for other artists, such as Don Armando&#x27;s Second Avenue Rhumba Band and Gichy Dan&#x27;s Beachwood No. 9, before adopting the name Kid Creole (adapted from the Elvis Presley film &quot;King Creole&quot;) in 1980 and co-founder Adriana Kaegi came up with the name The Coconuts. The Kid wore zoot suits and danced onstage in a style reminiscent of films of the 1930s and 1940s, and fronted a multi-racial, multi-cultural band. The co-founders of the band were Darnell and his Savannah Band associate vibraphone player Andy Hernandez, also known as his &quot;trusty sidekick&quot; Coati Mundi. Hernandez served as Darnell&#x27;s on-stage comic foil, as well as his musical director and arranger.

The original Coconuts, a collection of glamorous and often skimpily attired female backing vocalists, were led by Darnell&#x27;s then-wife Adriana &quot;Addy&quot; Kaegi, who also served as the choreographer and costume designer of the Coconuts. Early recordings featured a Coconuts lineup of Kaegi, Cheryl Lee Poirier, Fonda Rae, and Lourdes Cotton; Lori Eastside was also a Coconut on a handful of early singles. By 1982, the Coconuts were a trio of Kaegi, Cheryl Poirier, and Taryn Hagey. This lineup of the Coconuts recorded a spin-off album project in 1983, with Poirier taking the lead vocalist role on EMI.

Throughout the 1980s, the band also included Peter Schott on keyboards (Schott also occasionally co-composed material with Darnell), drummer David Span, bass player Carol Colman, and legendary Jamaican drummer Winston Grennan. With horn players, percussionists, and other adjunct members, the full band lineup often swelled to over a dozen players.

Kid Creole and the Coconuts&#x27; debut album &quot;Off the Coast of Me&quot; was critically well-received but not successful commercially. They made their national TV debut performing &quot;Mister Softee&quot; and &quot;There But For The Grace of God Go I&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in November 1980. The second release, &quot;Fresh Fruit in Foreign Places&quot;, was a concept album matched with a New York Public Theater stage production; it received positive reviews, with Darnell recognized as a clever lyricist and astute composer, arranger and producer. By the second album they were accompanied by the Pond Life horn section Charlie Lagond, Ken Fradley, and Lee Robertson, as well as lead guitarist Mark Mazur. The album charted briefly, and subsequently Coati Mundi&#x27;s early Latin rap &quot;Me No Pop I&quot;, though not originally on the album, became a Top 40 UK hit single. It was the band&#x27;s first hit.

Their breakthrough came with 1982&#x27;s &quot;Tropical Gangsters&quot;, which hit #3 in the UK and spun off three Top 10 hits with &quot;Stool Pigeon&quot;, &quot;Annie, I&#x27;m Not Your Daddy&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m A Wonderful Thing, Baby&quot;. &quot;Dear Addy&quot; also made the Top 40. In the US the album was retitled &quot;Wise Guy&quot; and reached #145, and &quot;I&#x27;m a Wonderful Thing, Baby&quot; flirted with the R&amp;B charts.
Darnell subsequently produced a 1983 spin-off album for the Coconuts with Cheryl Poirier on lead vocals. Coati Mundi also released his solo LP &quot;The Former 12 Year Old Genius&quot; before the fourth Kid Creole and the Coconuts album in 1983; &quot;Doppelganger&quot; was a relative commercial disappointment, despite the single &quot;There&#x27;s Something Wrong in Paradise&quot; reaching the UK Top 40. In 1983, Kid Creole formed a new swing big band, Elbow Bones and the Racketeers, and he gained the hit &quot;Night in New York&quot;.

The group performed the song &quot;My Male Curiosity&quot; (with choreography by Kaegi) for the 1984 movie &quot;Against All Odds&quot;; the song also appeared on the best-selling soundtrack album.

The Coconuts also sang background vocals in the songs &quot;Red Light&quot; and &quot;Surrender&quot; on U2&#x27;s album &quot;War&quot;, which was released on 28 February 1983 on Island Records.

Darnell and Kaegi divorced in 1985, though she remained with the band. Taryn Hagey dropped out of The Coconuts around the same time, and the two remaining Coconuts (Adriana Kaegi and Cheryl Poirier) formed their own spin-off group Boomerang with Perri Lister. This group released a dance-oriented album, somewhat different in sound to their Coconuts recordings, on the Atlantic label in 1986. The producer was David Kershenbaum.

Kid Creole and the Coconuts continued, now with third Coconut Janique Svedberg replacing the departed Hagey. On record, though billed as guests and not as Coconuts, during this era some female co-lead vocals were performed by Haitia Fuller and Cory Daye. In the mid to late 1980s, the group contributed to various film soundtracks and other such projects. They also appeared at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1986 and in this period released the albums &quot;In Praise of Older Women... and Other Crimes&quot; (which included the single &quot;Endicott&quot;) and &quot;I, Too, Have Seen the Woods&quot;, neither of which charted in the US. Still, the group continued world tours, performed sold-out shows at Carnegie Hall in New York City, and was invited by Princess Diana to perform at a private function in the UK.

In 1987, Kid Creole and the Coconuts made their only appearance on the US Hot 100 charts with &quot;Hey Mambo&quot;, a track from Barry Manilow&#x27;s &quot;Swing Street&quot; album. The single, credited to &quot;Barry Manilow with Kid Creole &amp; The Coconuts&quot;, peaked at #90. The band also performed on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

Longtime associate Hernandez left the ensemble before 1990&#x27;s &quot;Private Waters in the Great Divide&quot;, an album described by the NME as &quot;a return to form with inspired lyrics and buckets of the type of sexual innuendo that Creole has made his own.&quot; The band had a UK hit with the single &quot;The Sex of It&quot;, a song written by Prince and recorded at Paisley Park Studios with Sheila E and Levi Seacer, Jr. Except for Darnell&#x27;s vocal, the track is entirely performed by Prince and his associates; it is the group&#x27;s last major hit to date.

After the 1992 Kid Creole and the Coconuts album &quot;You Shoulda Told Me You Were...&quot; failed to achieve significant commercial success, the group splintered. The female backing trio all left and have been replaced with a rotating group of new Coconuts. With a revised and slimmed-down lineup, the band kept releasing albums throughout the &#x27;90s on independent labels, though none of the recordings received much attention or wide distribution. Despite still touring, the band went into a 10-year recording hiatus after their 2001 album &quot;Too Cool to Conga!&quot;, re-emerging in 2011 with &quot;I Wake Up Screaming&quot;.

Kid Creole and The Coconuts have appeared in a number of films, such as &quot;Downtown 81&quot; (1981), an art film starring Jean-Michel Basquiat, &quot;Against All Odds&quot; (1984), and the Lambada-themed &quot;The Forbidden Dance&quot; (1990); they also starred in a UK-produced TV movie in 1984 titled &quot;There&#x27;s Something Wrong in Paradise&quot;, based around the group&#x27;s songs from the &quot;Doppelganger&quot; album and produced for Granada Television. Andy Hernandez has also made appearances in a number of films separately, and Adriana Kaegi produced and directed a documentary film about the band called Kid Creole and My Coconuts. She now runs her media production company in New York and has her own Styleculture.tv channel. They also composed music for the 1999 French animated series &quot;Pirate Family&quot;.

==Present==
Darnell still tours with the current Coconuts: Roos van Rossum and Charlotte de Graaf (both from the Netherlands) and Kristina Hanford from Memphis Tennessee. Darnell&#x27;s now wife, Eva Tudor-Jones, who was Mama Coconut for more than 20 years, now manages all the operations.

Darnell now has his own indie record label called 2C2C Music. He runs it with his business partners Peter Schott and Eva Tudor-Jones. The partners founded the label in 2018 and have since released some new Kid Creole and the Coconuts music. The label also recently released Off the Coast of Me (40th Anniversary Edition) to celebrate the album&#x27;s 40 years since its first release. And in 2021, the label released the album &quot;Nothin&#x27; Left but the Rest.&quot; 

In 2008, for the last time, Kid Creole toured the UK starring in the stage show &quot;Oh! What a Night&quot;, a disco musical produced by Random Concerts.

Kid Creole and the Coconuts&#x27; most recent studio album, entitled &quot;I Wake Up Screaming&quot;, was released on September 12, 2011 on !K7/Strut Records.

At the end of 2010, Kid Creole and the Coconuts toured Germany with The Night of the Proms, also starring Boy George and Sir Cliff Richard. They previously appeared in the Night of the Proms in the Netherlands and Belgium in 2007 with Chic, Macy Gray and Donna Summer.

<doc id="415224" wikidata="Q311373" url="?curid=415224" title="Afzelia">
<text>Afzelia is a genus of plants in family Fabaceae. The thirteen species all are trees, native to tropical Africa or Asia.

The genus name of &quot;Afzelia&quot; is in honour of Adam Afzelius (1750–1837), a Swedish botanist and an apostle of Carl Linnaeus.

==Evolutionary history==
&quot;Afzelia&quot; is closely related to, and the sister taxon of &quot;Intsia&quot;. Both &quot;Afzelia&quot; and &quot;Intsia&quot;, along with &quot;Brodriguesia&quot; form the clade Afzelieae within the legume subfamily Detarioideae.

The earliest definitive record of &quot;Afzelia&quot; in the fossil record is a well-preserved, compression fossil of a leaflet (with cuticle) from the late Oligocene (27.23 Ma) Guang River flora of northwestern Ethiopia (Amhara), named &quot;Afzelia afro-arabica&quot;. Numerous other records, some which may represent &quot;Afzelia&quot; (or potentially, &quot;Intsia&quot;), are known fossil wood occurrences from the Paleogene and Neogene of Africa and Asia and are included in the form genus, &quot;Pahudioxylon&quot;.

==Species==
12 species are accepted.
*&quot;Afzelia africana&quot; – western tropical Africa to Uganda
*&quot;Afzelia bella&quot; – western and west-central tropical Africa
*&quot;Afzelia bipindensis&quot; – Ivory Coast and Nigeria to Uganda and Angola
*&quot;Afzelia cambodensis&quot; – Cambodia
*&quot;Afzelia javanica&quot; – Sumatra and Java
*&quot;Afzelia martabanica&quot; – Myanmar
*&quot;Afzelia pachyloba&quot; – Nigeria to Democratic Republic of the Congo
*&quot;Afzelia parviflora&quot; – West Africa (Liberia to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) and Angola
*&quot;Afzelia peturei&quot; – Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia
*&quot;Afzelia quanzensis&quot; – Somalia to Angola and South Africa
*&quot;Afzelia rhomboidea&quot; – Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the Philippines
*&quot;Afzelia xylocarpa&quot; – Indo-China

==Uses==
&quot;Afzelia&quot; species are used primarily for wood, though some species also have medicinal uses. The timber is most commonly traded under the collective name &quot;doussie&quot;, as well as under name &quot;afzelia.&quot; African species are sometimes traded as &quot;African mahogany&quot; or &quot;pod mahogany&quot;, despite the genus being botanically unrelated to Meliaceae (mahogany.)

The seeds are red and black and are used as beads.

The wood is often used as the surface material for outdoor velodromes.

The highly figured wood of the Asian species, &quot;Afzelia xylocarpa&quot;, is sold as Afzelia xylay. The seeds and bark of this species are used as medicine.

The dense and wavy wood of an &quot;Afzelia africana&quot; is used in ship-building.

<doc id="415225" wikidata="Q15588566" url="?curid=415225" title="Institute for Fiscal Studies">
<text>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) is an independent economic research institute based in London, United Kingdom, which specialises in UK taxation and public policy. It produces both academic and policy-related findings.

The institute&#x27;s stated aim is &quot;to provide top quality economic analysis independent of government, political party or any other vested interest. Our goal is to promote effective economic and social policies by understanding better their impact on individuals, families, businesses and the government&#x27;s finances.&quot;

Its offices are in the Bloomsbury area of Central London close to the British Museum and University College London.

== History ==
The institute was founded in response to the passing of the Finance Act 1965, by four financial professionals: a banker and later Conservative Party politician (Will Hopper), an investment trust manager (Bob Buist), a stockbroker (Nils Taube), and a tax consultant (John Chown). In 1964, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer James Callaghan had made a speech announcing his intentions to make changes to the tax system, including the introduction of a capital gains tax and a corporation tax. The group felt that the proposals were &quot;half-baked&quot;. Nils Taube had commissioned John Chown to prepare a professional analysis of the speech and its effect on share prices. Chown described what he thought the impact of the proposals would be if implemented but also treated the exercise as a &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; and suggested that &quot;the government and its advisers had three or four months for second thoughts and, recognising some of the dire consequences, would modify their original proposals.&quot; The chancellor did not change his mind. This led to further discussion among the group about their views on tax reform and the budget process. In Chown&#x27;s words, the group wanted to ensure that &quot;never again should a government, regardless of its political colour and intentions, introduce far-reaching tax legislation without the benefit of deep and thorough analysis of second- and third-order effects.&quot;

In 1967 a brainstorming weekend took place at The Bell, Aston Clinton. In the same year, the group published &quot;A Charter for the Taxpayer&quot; with proposals for tax changes in &quot;The Times&quot;, and Jeremy Skinner and Halmer Hudson joined the group. Will Hopper has stated that the idea of a research institute did not take shape until some time later at a dinner which was attended by Bob Buist, John Chown, Nils Taube and himself on 30 July 1968 at the Stella Alpina restaurant, 32 North Audley Street, London, at which a decision was made to found the institute. Will Hopper proposed the name &#x27;Institute for Fiscal Studies&#x27;. &#x27;Fiscal&#x27; was selected rather than just &#x27;tax&#x27; &quot;because we wished to include the other side of fisc. You cannot discuss the economic impact of taxation without looking at expenditure and the balance between the two.&quot; The institute was formally incorporated on 21 May 1969.

As well as research, the institute had wider, unspoken objectives. The founders did not just want to start an institute; they wanted to change British fiscal strategy. In particular, the group&#x27;s declared aims were &quot;to alter the climate of opinion within which changes to the British tax system were considered; to alter the procedures by which changes in the tax system were effected; and to help create a more rational tax system&quot;.

In 1970, Dick Taverne, then a Labour MP and a former Financial Secretary to the Treasury in the Wilson government, was approached to be the institute&#x27;s first director. In 1971 a Council of the institute was formed, with President Sir Richard Powell (civil servant) and Vice-Presidents Roy Jenkins (Labour Party) and Selwyn Lloyd (Conservative Party). In the same year an Executive Committee was formed, with Will Hopper as Chairman, Halmer Hudson as Secretary and Buist, Chown, Skinner and Taube as Members. In 1972, the first full-time staff of the institute were appointed. In 1974, the institute moved from Bell Yard to Chandos Place. In 1975, the Meade Committee began its enquiries under the leadership of the later Nobel laureate James Meade. Simon Akam wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2016: &quot;Meade was assisted by two young economists: John Kay, who would go on to become director of the IFS, and Mervyn King, who would later become governor of the Bank of England.&quot; In 1978, the Meade Report was published and the institute moved to Castle Lane. In 1979, the &quot;Fiscal Studies&quot; publication was launched and the &quot;Working Paper&quot; series began. In 1980, the Armstrong Report was published. In 1982, the Report series was launched and the first &quot;Green Budget&quot; was issued. In 1984, &quot;The Reform of Social Security&quot; document was published by the institute. In 1985, the institute moved to Tottenham Court Road. In 1987, the Capital Taxes Group was established. In 1990, the institute moved to Ridgmount Street. In 1991, the ESRC Centre was inaugurated. In 1994, the Tax Law Review Committee was established.

==Research==
Areas of research covered by the institute include public finance and spending, pensions and saving, company taxation, consumer behaviour and poverty and inequality. Although most of the institute&#x27;s research is UK-focused, recent work has also looked at international development policies, for instance at education and nutrition programmes in Colombia. In October 2016, Professor Orazio Attanasio, the IFS&#x27; Research Director and Head of UCL Economics, won the Klaus J. Jacobs Research Prize for his work in the latter field.

The institute is home to – or a partner in – the following research centres (some of which are described further, in following sections):

*Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP)
*Centre for the Evaluation of Development Policies (EDePo)
*Tax Law Review Committee (TLRC)
*English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA)
*Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice (cemmap)
*Centre for Tax Analysis in Developing Countries (TaxDev)
*formerly Programme Evaluation for Policy Analysis (PEPA)

===Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy===
Since 1991 the institute has hosted an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) research centre, the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP). The CPP has had Institute status since 2020. It is directed by Professor Imran Rasul, and co-directors Professor Richard Blundell, Professor James Banks, Professor Eric French, Professor Rachel Griffith and Professor Fabien Postel-Vinay.

The CPP carries out microeconomic analysis of major public policy issues, including productivity growth, poverty reduction, promoting employment and ensuring sound public finances. Its focus is on the modelling of individual, household and firm behaviour. Between 1991 and 2020, CPP was directed by Richard Blundell.

===Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice===
The institute hosts the Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice (Cemmap), a joint venture between the institute and the UCL Department of Economics. Cemmap&#x27;s activities include:

*conducting research and organising conferences, symposia, workshops and training courses;
*developing and applying methods for modelling individual behaviour, the influences on it and the impact of policy interventions; and
*maintaining an extensive network of fellows in the UK and abroad.

Cemmap organises training courses and masterclasses and is home to a working paper series in the field of microeconometrics.

Cemmap was founded in 2000 with a grant from the Leverhulme Trust and since 2007 has been an ESRC research centre.

==Publications==
The institute regularly publishes policy-reports and academic articles. It also produces a peer-reviewed quarterly journal, &quot;Fiscal Studies&quot;, which publishes articles submitted by a range of academics and practitioners in the field. The IFS &quot;Green Budget&quot;, which discusses policy issues which are likely to be relevant for the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x27;s annual budget statement, is published early each year.

Another noteworthy publication is the Mirrlees Review, which was published in September 2011. The review consists of two volumes. The first of these is a series of chapters covering different aspects of the UK tax system, accompanied by commentaries voicing different opinions. The second sets out the conclusions of the review. The review was chaired by Nobel laureate James Mirrlees and included contributions from IFS staff alongside prominent economists from various universities around the world.

==Criticism==
The institute frequently speaks out on politically important issues. In October 2010, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused the IFS of using methods that were &quot;distorted and a complete nonsense&quot;, after it challenged government claims that tax and benefit reforms in the June 2010 Budget were &quot;progressive&quot;.

Concern is sometimes expressed regarding the sources of the institute&#x27;s funding. In October 2010 an Early Day Motion in Parliament pointed out that &quot;95 per cent. of [its] 5.1 million funding comes from so-called research grant contracts, details of which are not itemised in its accounts; [...] that the vast majority of its official funding bodies are Government departments, the wider public sector, the European Commission and publicly-funded organisations, notably including the BBC, H M Treasury, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Government Equalities Office, the Department for International Development, the Department of Health, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Department for Education, the Department of Finance and Personnel for Northern Ireland, HM Revenue and Customs, the Food Standards Agency, the International Monetary Fund, the Low Pay Commission and the Office for National Statistics; [and] that the Institute for Fiscal Studies recently received a substantial part of its core funding from the Economic and Social Research Council, which is ultimately funded by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills...&quot;.

In 2016, &quot;The Guardian&quot; said: &quot;Some left-leaning economists look with particular scepticism on the claim that the IFS has no ideology, arguing that the institute holds an excessive faith in the power of market forces. The tax campaigner Richard Murphy said the IFS was &#x27;embedded in all the normal, standard pro-market assumptions that dominate conventional economic thinking in the UK and elsewhere&#x27;.&quot; Murphy also said in a report about Value Added Tax (VAT) that the &quot;Institute for Fiscal Studies is a body that persistently recommends tax increases that benefit the wealthiest in society at cost to those who make their living from work and the poorest in society.&quot;

In July 2011, &quot;The Spectator&quot; published an article that said that institutes&#x27; funded by research grants (which means, usually, tax money) will always argue for more expensive meddling by the state&quot; and that the Institute for Fiscal Studies was &quot;the most striking example&quot; of this.

A week before the manifesto analysis for the 2019 UK general election was released, economist John Weeks commented that while the institute had no links to political groups, it had an inherent bias in its judgement criteria that &quot;favour[ed] accounting balance over social outcome&quot;, saying that an IFS analysis cannot tell the public &quot;whether a policy is a good idea, only whether the numbers add up.&quot;

==People==
The following have been directors of the IFS:

* Dick Taverne (1970–1979)
* John Kay (1979–1986)
* Bill Robinson (1986–1991)
* Andrew Dilnot (1991–2002)
* Robert Chote (2002–2010)
* Paul Johnson (since 2011)

Former members of staff of the IFS include Evan Davis and Stephanie Flanders (journalists), Steve Webb (Liberal Democrat Pensions Minister) and Rupert Harrison (Chief of Staff to former Chancellor George Osborne).

== Funding ==
The Institute for Fiscal Studies receives funding from various sources, such as the Economic and Social Research Council, international organisations and other non-profit organisations.

It was rated as &#x27;highly transparent&#x27; in its funding in 2018 by Transparify, and has been a given a A grade for funding transparency by Who Funds You?.

<text>The British-American Parliamentary Group is a group consisting of members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. &quot;The objects of the British-American Parliamentary Group are to promote friendly relations and mutual understanding between Members of both Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom and Members of both Houses of Congress of the United States of America; to discuss problems common to the United Kingdom and the United States; to exchange courtesies and to provide opportunities for discussion with Senators, members of the House of Representatives, and other distinguished citizens of the United States; and to arrange for the exchange of visits and information between legislators of both countries.&quot; Its co-presidents are the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Lord Speaker, among the vice presidents are former Speakers of the House of Commons, one former prime minister, the current deputy prime minister, former leaders of the opposition, and former foreign secretaries. The chairman is the prime minister. There are currently over 600 members from both the Labour and Conservative parties.

The group is an autonomous body within parliament, therefore they appoint their own staff to carry out the group&#x27;s proceedings. The British American Parliamentary Group was founded just before the start of World War II in 1937 in hopes of creating closer relations between the members of Congress and Parliament. It was initially funded by the British Government and is now being financed through a combination of a grant from the House of Commons and the members&#x27; subscriptions. In 1967 they formally adopted rules and objectives and have made a few amendments since then. There are currently 14 rules and objectives.

In 2012 the British-American Parliamentary Group celebrated their 35th anniversary of connecting British Members of Parliament with U.S. members of Congress. While the group has been around since the late 1930s, MPs did not start visiting Congress members until 1977. The exchange allows for participants to network with each other, learn about the different political processes of the two countries and discuss different policies. The MPs and Congress members were matched up at the beginning of the week, they were able to shadow the Congress members both in D.C. and in their home congressional districts.

In 2014, 4 MPs (members of parliament) spent a week in D.C. meeting with United States Congressmen, visiting the different government departments such as the Department of Defense, the White House and the Library of Congress. The purpose of the visit and the meetings that ensued were to inform the MPs of how the US political process works, policy development, and the structure of the federal government.

<doc id="415242" wikidata="Q813919" url="?curid=415242" title="Unconditional surrender">
<text>An unconditional surrender is a surrender in which no guarantees, reassurances, or promises (i.e., conditions) are given to the surrendering party. It is often demanded with the threat of complete destruction, extermination or annihilation.

Announcing that only unconditional surrender is acceptable puts psychological pressure on a weaker adversary, but it may also prolong hostilities. A party typically only demands unconditional surrender when it has a significant advantage over their adversaries, when victory is thought to be inevitable.

In modern times, unconditional surrenders most often include guarantees provided by international law. In some cases, surrender is truly accepted unconditionally; while in other cases terms are offered and accepted, but forces are declared to be subject to &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; for symbolic purposes. This type of surrender may also be accepted by the surrendering party under the expectation of guarantees agreed to informally.

==Examples==

===Banu Qurayza during Muhammad&#x27;s era===

After the Battle of the Trench, in which the Muslims tactically overcame their opponents while suffering very few casualties, efforts to defeat the Muslims failed, and Islam became influential in the region. As a consequence, the Muslim army besieged the neighbourhood of the Banu Qurayza tribe, leading to their unconditional surrender.

<doc id="415247" wikidata="Q5287587" url="?curid=415247" title="Doctrine of chances">
<text>In law, the doctrine of chances is a rule of evidence that allows evidence to show that it is unlikely a defendant would be repeatedly, innocently involved in similar, suspicious circumstances.

Normally, under Federal Rule of Evidence 404, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.

Using the doctrine of chances allows a prosecutor to admit evidence of prior &quot;accidents&quot; that can persuade a jury that prior incidents are so similar that it is very improbable that the case at bar is actually accidental.

The doctrine of chances was first developed by English courts in the case &quot;Rex v. Smith&quot;, 11 Cr. App. R. 229, 84 L.J.K.B. 2153 (1915), better known as the &quot;brides in the bath murder&quot;. In this case the defendant was accused of murdering his wife by drowning her in a bath. The defendant claimed that his wife had fainted in the bath. The prosecutor sought to include evidence in the trial that the defendant&#x27;s two previous wives had both died in the same way. The evidence was allowed.

<text>Cordia alliodora is a species of flowering tree in the borage family, Boraginaceae, that is native to the American tropics. It is commonly known as Spanish elm, Ecuador laurel, cypre or salmwood. It can reach 35 m in height.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described in 1799 by Hipólito Ruiz López and José Antonio Pavón Jiménez, as &quot;Cerdana alliodora&quot;. In 1841, it was transferred to the genus &quot;Cordia&quot; by Lorenz Oken. (&quot;Cerdana&quot; is treated as a synonym of &quot;Cordia&quot;.)

Among the synonyms of &quot;Cordia alliodora&quot; is &quot;Solanum mucronatum&quot;. &quot;Solanum&quot; is placed in a different family from &quot;Cordia&quot; (Solanaceae rather than Boraginaceae). &quot;Solanum mucronatum&quot; was described by Otto Eugen Schulz in 1909. In his description, Schulz expressed doubt that &quot;Solanum&quot; was the right genus.

==Uses==
&quot;Cordia alliodora&quot; is one of several &quot;Cordia&quot; trees called &quot;bocote&quot; in Spanish and its wood, which has very little figure, is usually called freijo or jennywood along with that of &quot;Cordia goeldiana&quot;. The wood is used for boat decking, furniture, cabinetry, guitar/bass building by luthiers, and sometimes substitutes for mahogany or teak.

==Environmental aspects==
Outside of its indigenous range, &quot;Cordia alliodora&quot; has been identified as a problematic invasive species.
For example, a timber-focused planting program of the species in Vanuatu during the mid-1970s has over time proved disruptive to native ecosystems and communities. The species has been described as a severe environmental nuisance, as it has overtaken natural forests by multiplying at a faster rate than being harvested, and has become susceptible to outbreaks of a form of root rot known as Phellinus noxius.

<text>The Big Eight Conference was a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)-affiliated Division I-A college athletic association that sponsored football. It was formed in January 1907 as the [[Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (MVIAA) by its charter member schools: the University of Kansas, University of Missouri, University of Nebraska, and Washington University in St. Louis. Additionally, the University of Iowa was an original member of the MVIAA, while maintaining joint membership in the Western Conference (now the Big Ten Conference).

The conference&#x27;s membership at its dissolution consisted of the University of Nebraska, Iowa State University, the University of Colorado at Boulder, the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, the University of Missouri, the University of Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State University. The Big Eight&#x27;s headquarters were located in Kansas City, Missouri.

In February 1994, all eight members of the Big Eight Conference and four of the members of the Southwest Conference announced that the 12 schools had reached an agreement to form the Big 12 Conference. From a conventional standpoint, the Big 12 was a renamed and expanded Big Eight. But from a legal standpoint, the Big Eight ceased operations in 1996, and its members joined with the four SWC schools (Texas, Texas A&amp;M, Baylor, and Texas Tech) to form the Big 12 the following year.

==History==

===Formation===
The conference was founded as the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MVIAA) at a meeting on January 12, 1907, of five charter member institutions: the University of Kansas, the University of Missouri, the University of Nebraska, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of Iowa, which also maintained its concurrent membership in the Western Conference (now the Big Ten Conference). However, Iowa only participated in football and outdoor men&#x27;s track and field for a brief period before leaving the conference in 1911.

===Early membership changes===
In 1908, Drake University and Iowa Agricultural College (now Iowa State University) joined the MVIAA, increasing the conferences membership to seven. Iowa, which was a joint member, departed the conference in 1911 to return to sole competition in the Western Conference, but Kansas State University joined the conference in 1913. Nebraska left in 1918 to play as an independent for two seasons before returning in 1920. In 1919, the University of Oklahoma and Saint Louis University applied for membership, but were not approved due to deficient management of their athletic programs. The conference then added Grinnell College in 1919, with the University of Oklahoma applying again and being approved in 1920. Oklahoma A&amp;M University (now Oklahoma State University) joined in 1925, bringing conference membership to ten, an all-time high.

===Split into Big Six Conference===
At a meeting in Lincoln, Nebraska, on May 19, 1928, the conference split up. Six of the seven state schools (all except Oklahoma A&amp;M) formed a conference that was initially known as the Big Six Conference. Just before the start of fall practice, the six schools announced they would retain the MVIAA name for formal purposes. However, fans and media continued to call it the Big Six. The three private schools – Drake, Grinnell, and Washington University – joined with Oklahoma A&amp;M to form the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC). The old MVIAA&#x27;s administrative staff transferred to the MVC.

The similarity of the two conferences&#x27; official names, as well as the competing claims of the two conferences, led to considerable debate over which conference was the original and which was the spin-off, though the MVIAA went on to become the more prestigious of the two. For the remainder of the Big Eight&#x27;s run, both conferences claimed 1907 as their founding date, as well as the same history through 1927. To this day, it has never been definitively established which conference was the original.

=== Big Seven adds Colorado ===
Conference membership grew with the addition of the University of Colorado on December 1, 1947, from the Mountain States Conference. Later that month, Reaves E. Peters was hired as &quot;Commissioner of Officials and Assistant Secretary&quot; and set up the first conference offices in Kansas City, Missouri. With the addition of Colorado, the conference&#x27;s unofficial name became the Big Seven Conference, coincidentally, the former unofficial name of the MSC.

=== Big Eight adds Oklahoma State ===

The final membership change happened ten years later, when Oklahoma A&amp;M, newly renamed Oklahoma State, joined (or rejoined, depending on the source) the conference on June 1, 1957, and the conference became known as the Big Eight. However, Oklahoma State did not begin conference play until the 1958–59 season for basketball and the 1960 season for football. Peters&#x27; title was changed to &quot;Executive Secretary&quot; of the conference in 1957. He retired in June 1963 and was replaced by Wayne Duke, whose title was later changed to &quot;Commissioner&quot;.

In 1964, the conference legally assumed the name Big Eight Conference. In 1968 the conference began a long association with the Orange Bowl, sending its champion annually to play in the prestigious bowl game in Miami, Florida, all except the 1974 Orange Bowl and the 1975 Orange Bowl. Instead, Big Eight representative Nebraska Cornhuskers played in the 1974 Cotton Bowl Classic and the 1974 Sugar Bowl (Oklahoma, which won the conference championship in 1973 and 1974, was banned from bowl games in those seasons as part of NCAA probation).

===Formation of the Big 12 Conference===
In the early 1990s, most of the colleges in Division I-A (now known as the Football Bowl Subdivision) were members of the College Football Association; this included members of the Big Eight and Southwest Conferences. Following a Supreme Court decision in 1984, the primary function of the CFA was to negotiate television broadcast rights for its member conferences and independent colleges. In February 1994, the Southeastern Conference announced that they, like the Big Ten, Pac-10, and Notre Dame before them, would be leaving the CFA and negotiate independently for a television deal that covered SEC schools only. This led &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; to proclaim that &quot;the College Football Association as a television entity is dead&quot;. More significantly, this change in television contracts ultimately would lead to significant realignment of college conferences, with the biggest change being the dissolution of the Big Eight and Southwest Conferences and the formation of the Big 12.

After the SEC&#x27;s abandonment of the CFA, the Southwest Conference and the Big Eight Conference saw potential financial benefits from an alliance to negotiate television deals, and quickly began negotiations to that end, with ABC and ESPN. On February 25, 1994, it was announced that a new conference would be formed from the members of the Big Eight and four of the Texas member colleges of the Southwest Conference. Though the name would not be made official for several months, newspaper accounts immediately dubbed the new entity the &quot;Big 12&quot;. Charter members of the Big 12 included the members of the Big Eight plus Baylor, Texas, Texas A&amp;M and Texas Tech.

===Dissolution===
Following the formation of the Big 12 Conference in 1994, the Big Eight continued operations until August 30, 1996, when the conference was formally dissolved and its members officially began competition in the Big 12 Conference. 
Although the Big 12 was essentially the Big Eight plus the four Texas schools, the Big 12 regards itself as a separate conference and does not claim the Big Eight&#x27;s history as its own.

===Subsequent conference affiliations===

# Colorado left the Big 12 for the Pac-12 beginning with the 2011–12 season. It rejoined the Big 12 in 2024. 
# Drake withdrew from the Missouri Valley Conference from 1951 to 1956. The MVC stopped sponsoring football in 1985; Drake remains a member for all non-football sports. The football program dropped to Division III in 1987, playing as an independent until a change in NCAA rules forced the program to play in Division I. When the new rule took effect in 1993, Drake joined the newly formed Pioneer League, a football-only league playing at the FCS level that prohibits the awarding of football scholarships.
# Grinnell joined the Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference beginning with the 1939–40 season; their affiliation from 1928 to 1939 is unclear. The MCAC merged with the Midwest Athletic Conference for Women to form the Midwest Conference beginning with the 1994–95 season.
# Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC beginning with the 2012–13 season.
# Nebraska left the Big 12 for the Big Ten beginning with the 2011–12 season.
# Oklahoma left the Big 12 for the SEC beginning with the 2024–25 season.
# Washington University left the MVC in 1946; it joined the College Athletic Conference from 1962 through 1971, and became a charter member of the University Athletic Association, which began play with the 1986–87 season. It was independent in all other years. Washington University is now a football-only affiliate member of the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin.

===Football===
Shared championships are shown in &quot;italics&quot;:

&quot; † Kansas would have won the 1960 title, but after found to be using an ineligible player they were forced to forfeit their victories over Missouri and Colorado, which meant that Missouri was awarded the 1960 Big Eight title.&quot;

&quot; ‡ Oklahoma initially won the 1972 title, but after it was found that they used ineligible players, they were penalized by the NCAA, though they did not force OU to forfeit games. The Big Eight asked them to forfeit three games and awarded the title to Nebraska, but Oklahoma still claims these wins and this title.&quot;

===National team titles by institution===
The national championships listed below are for the final eight members of the conference, as of July 2014. Football, Helms, and equestrian titles are included in the total, but excluded from the column listing NCAA and AIAW titles.

==Racial integration==
The history of the Big Eight Conference straddles the era of racial segregation in the United States, particularly as it relates to African Americans.

Before the formation of the conference, three African-American brothers at the University of Kansas are the first known to have participated in organized sports for a league school: Sherman Haney played baseball for KU beginning in 1888, followed by Grant Haney and then Ed Haney, the last of whom also played football at KU in 1893. At the same time, the University of Nebraska football team had on its roster George Flippin, the son of a slave, beginning in 1891. Nebraska&#x27;s football team featured three more African-American players over the next 12 years. Notable among these NU players was Clinton Ross, who in 1911 apparently became the first African-American to participate in sport in the MVIAA, following the league&#x27;s formation in 1907.

Race relations in the United States, however, deteriorated in the early 20th century, and African-American athletes disappeared almost entirely from the conference in the four decades after Ross&#x27;s final season at NU in 1913. The lone exception during the following decades was Iowa State. In 1923 Jack Trice became the first African-American athlete at Iowa State – and the only one in the conference. Tragically, Trice died two days after playing his second football game with Iowa State, due to injuries suffered during the game (against Minnesota). Jack Trice Stadium at Iowa State is now named in his honor. Trice was followed at Iowa State by Holloway Smith, who played football for ISU in 1926 and 1927. After Smith, the league&#x27;s teams were all-white for more than two decades. (During this time all of the major professional sports leagues in the U.S. were also segregated.)

===Modern era===
The modern era of full integration of league sports began at Kansas State, with Harold Robinson. In 1949, Harold Robinson played football for Kansas State with an athletic scholarship. In doing so, Robinson broke the modern &quot;color barrier&quot; in conference athletics, and also became the first ever African-American athlete on scholarship in the conference. Harold Robinson later received a letter of congratulations from Jackie Robinson, who had reintegrated major league baseball in 1947 while playing with the Brooklyn Dodgers.

In the spring of 1951 the conference&#x27;s baseball color barrier was broken by Kansas State&#x27;s Earl Woods, and in the winter of 1951–1952 Kansas State&#x27;s Gene Wilson and Kansas&#x27;s LaVannes Squires jointly broke the conference color barrier in basketball.

Nebraska was the third league school to (re)integrate its athletic teams, with Charles Bryant joining the football team in 1952. Iowa State would be next, with Harold Potts and Henry Philmon reintegrating the Cyclone football team in 1953. The following season, Franklin Clarke became the first varsity African-American football player at the University of Colorado. In 1955, Homer Floyd became the first African-American to play football for Kansas since Ed Haney in 1893. Sports teams at the remaining three conference schools (Oklahoma, Missouri and Oklahoma State) were subsequently all integrated by the end of the 1950s. Most notably, Prentice Gautt became the first black player for Bud Wilkinson at Oklahoma in 1956.

Every college football team of the Big Eight was fully integrated by the end of the 1950s, and this gave the conference an advantage throughout the 1960s, as many opposing conferences had not yet integrated their sports teams. The Southeastern Conference (SEC), the last major college sports conference to oppose integration, had particular trouble against the Big Eight during its final years fielding all-white teams. The first SEC school to integrate, Kentucky, did so in 1967, and the last school to do so, Mississippi, did so in 1972. During the SEC&#x27;s eight-year national championship drought between 1965 and 1973, the Big Eight teams repeatedly defeated the SEC teams in inter-conference games, largely due to their integrated teams.

The 1971 football season ended with three Big Eight schools—Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Colorado—ranked first, second, and third the final AP poll, the only season in college football history that three teams from the same conference finished in the top three rankings. During the 1971 season, those three Big Eight teams beat three SEC schools—Alabama, Auburn, and LSU—in decisive victories (Colorado defeated LSU, 31–21 in September; Nebraska defeated Alabama, 38–6 in the Orange Bowl; Oklahoma defeated Auburn, 40–22 in the Sugar Bowl). In each of the Big Eight victories throughout this period, and especially in the 1971 season, the performance of the Big Eight schools’ black players was considered a deciding factor in their teams&#x27; victories. These players&#x27; performance contributed to the SEC schools recruitment of black players—the next national championship won by the SEC was by the 1973 Alabama team, which was fully integrated.

==Conference facilities==
This is a listing of the conference facilities as of the final athletic season of the conference, 1995–1996.

 The Colorado Buffaloes baseball program, which played home games at Prentup Field, was discontinued in June 1980.

<text>Gaume () is a region in the extreme southeast of Belgium. At a lower altitude than the Ardennes, it borders the French region of Lorraine to the south (although some consider the bordering parts of Lorraine to be Gaume française), the Land of Arlon (Luxembourgish: Arelerland) to the east, and the Belgian part of the Ardennes to the north.

In cultural terms, Gaume is the Romance-speaking part of what is now called Belgian Lorraine, Arelerland being its Luxembourgish-speaking part.

Gaume was part of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg till 1839, when it was integrated in the newly created Belgian province of Luxembourg.

It is composed of the districts of Chiny, Étalle, Florenville, Habay, Meix-devant-Virton, Musson, Rouvroy, Tintigny and Virton, but some villages in the northern districts are not in Gaume (as Suxy or Hachy).

Historically, the area around Montmédy, Carignan and Charency-Vezin, that was ceded to France by Spain in 1659, is also part of Gaume. Therefore, strictly speaking, the southern border of the region is not the border with France. The French part of the Gaume, named Gaume française by some, is part of a greater cluster of former Luxembourgish territories called French Luxembourg. It consists of the canton of Montmédy, almost all of the canton of Carignan and parts of the cantons of Damvillers and Longuyon. It largely corresponds with the now French part of the county of Chiny.

The unofficial capital of the Gaume region is Virton.

Temperatures in this region are often 1 °C to 3 °C higher than in other parts of the province of Luxembourg because of a distinctive microclimate.

Gaume is a popular destination for tourism in Belgium.

The Lorrain language, a langue d&#x27;oïl that is distinct from the Walloon language, is a minority language in Gaume, where it is known as &quot;gaumais&quot;. Although it is declining, several local authors are trying to revive its usage. Lorrain is recognized as a regional language of Wallonia.

<text>Hans Christian Lumbye (; 2 May 1810 – 20 March 1874) was a Danish composer of waltzes, polkas, mazurkas and galops, among other things.

==Beginnings==
As a child, he studied music in Randers and Odense, and by age 14 he was playing the trumpet in a military band. In 1829, he joined the Horse Guards in Copenhagen, still continuing his music education. In 1839, he heard a Viennese orchestra play music by Johann Strauss I, after which he composed in the style of Strauss, eventually earning the nickname &quot;The Strauss of the North&quot;.

==Career==
From 1843 to 1872, he served as the music director and in-house composer for Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen. Such was his popularity in the Danish capital that many Danes revered him and considered Johann Strauss II as the &quot;Lumbye of the South&quot;.

==Works==
Lumbye is best known for his light compositions, many of which evoke non-musical sources. The &quot;Champagne Galop&quot;, for example, begins with the &quot;pop&quot; of a champagne cork, and the &quot;Copenhagen Steam Railway Galop&quot; faithfully recreates the sounds of a train chugging out of a station and grinding to a halt at the next stop. He honored the Swedish Nightingale with a &quot;Souvenir de Jenny Lind, Vals&quot; from 1845.

<text>The Bruges Group is a think tank based in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1989, it advocates for a restructuring of Britain&#x27;s relationship with the European Union and other European countries. Its members and staff campaign against the notion of an &quot;ever-closer union&quot; in Europe and, above all, against British involvement in a single European state. The group is often associated with the Conservative Party, including MPs such as Iain Duncan Smith, Daniel Hannan, John Redwood, and Norman Lamont. However, it is formally an independent all-party think tank, and some Labour MPs and peers have cited the publications or attended the meetings of the Bruges Group through the years, such as Frank Field, Gisela Stuart, Lord Stoddart of Swindon and Lord Shore of Stepney.

The Bruges Group&#x27;s honorary president was former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The current president is Lord Tebbit and the current chairman is Barry Legg who was chief executive of the Conservative Party and a former Member of Parliament.

The stated mission of the Bruges Group is: &#x27;to promote discussion on the European Union and to advance the education of the public on European affairs. The Bruges Group&#x27;s research also explores alternative international relationships and policies&#x27;.

== Background ==
=== Founding ===
Founded in February 1989, the Bruges Group&#x27;s original aim was to promote the idea of a less centralised European structure than what they felt was emerging in Brussels. It was established by Lord Harris of High Cross and Oxford University student Patrick Robertson in response to Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Bruges speech to the College of Europe in September 1988, during which she remarked that:
Thatcher had cooperated with European Commission president Jacques Delors and supported the Single European Act, but in 1988 became Eurosceptic after realizing that a single market would cause political integration. Research institutes such as the Bruges Group quickly began to focus on Eurosceptic opinions in Britain and opposition to Delors. The Group is considered to be the common ancestor of the many British eurosceptic parties and groups that emerged in the 1990s. Since then, the Group has expanded its research agenda to include alternative international relationships for the United Kingdom and a complete restructuring of Britain&#x27;s relationship with other European countries. Since its founding, it has been at the forefront of policy debates, supported by members of the British and of the European Parliaments.

The group was a rallying point for rebellious backbench Conservative MPs during House of Commons debates over the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.

Lord Ralph Harris, who had been general director of the Institute of Economic Affairs 1957 to 1988, was chairman from 1989 until 1991 when he was replaced by professor Kenneth Minogue.

=== 1993–present ===
In 1993, Dr Martin Holmes (University of Oxford) and Dr Brian Hindley (London School of Economics) became co-chairmen of the Bruges Group. Jonathan Collett became campaign director in 1993 and held the role until 2001. During that time, the Bruges Group became the most influential eurosceptic group, holding regular meetings and regularly publishing working papers. The Rt. Hon. Lord Lamont of Lerwick, Chancellor of the Exchequer 1990–1993, remarked that the Bruges Group maintains &#x27;a vital influence on the European debate and I hope others will support it enthusiastically.&#x27; The Rt. Hon. John Redwood MP also remarked that the Bruges Group &#x27;has set out many important points in the debate about the way Europe is careering towards a superstate and the way in which Britain needs a different and better relationship with our European partners.&#x27;

Its first annual conference was held in 1994 at King&#x27;s College and has been held there ever since. The Bruges Group played a leading role in stopping the United Kingdom from entering the Eurozone. Martin Holmes&#x27; publication of &quot;The Conservative Party and Europe&quot; had a strong influence on William Hague. Since then, the annual conference has been held in London and has greatly impacted intellectual debates over Britain&#x27;s membership in the European Union.

Dr Martin Holmes continued as co-chairman until 2001. Dr Brian Hindley carried on as co-chairman for a few more years and published a number of papers for the Bruges Group.

Another pivotal moment for the Bruges Group came in 2008 at the twentieth anniversary dinner in London. There, Margaret Thatcher and other notable MPs, such as the Sir Peter Tapsell MP, Father of the House of Commons; the Owen Paterson MP, Secretary of State for the Environment; the Theresa Villiers MP, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland; and the John Redwood MP, held talks over Britain&#x27;s relationship with the EU. From that point onwards, the Bruges Group heavily influenced the policies of the Conservative Party.

In 2013, then-leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) Nigel Farage planned to address a Tory party conference in Manchester that was organized by the Bruges Group.

In 2021, the DUP&#x27;s former Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds, Sir Bernard Jenkin MP, and James Webber of Shearman &amp; Sterling, addressed the Bruges Group in a Waterloo Day webinar on &#x27;The Future of the Union&#x27;, on the issues of the Northern Ireland Protocol and how the Johnson government should renegotiate on the status of Northern Ireland.

===Supporters===
The Bruges Group works closely with politicians mainly in the Conservative Party, but has also attracted others from Labour and UK Independence parties. The group has also established an Academic Advisory Council which has included Professors Tim Congdon (University of Oxford), Julius Gould (University of Nottingham), Kenneth Minogue (London School of Economics), Christie Davies (University of Reading), Ben Roberts (London School of Economics), Norman Stone (Bilkent University), and Patrick Minford (Cardiff Business School). Its sponsors, patrons, and supporters include:
== Activities ==
The Bruges Group seeks to keep debate on European issues centre stage by commissioning and publishing independent research and by holding meetings and conferences to discuss relevant issues. These events have covered topics like the European Union, immigration, trade, and the euro, and they seek to inform decision-makers and opinion-formers, especially those in Parliament and the media. The Bruges Group also monitors and assesses the voting of members of parliament.

The Bruges Group contends that the EU seeks to extend its influence over individual states’ right to manage their own affairs. As a result, the Group has extended its remit to monitor the EU&#x27;s policies and regulations relating to the increasing costs of membership, defence, international relations, climate change, national identity, immigration and healthcare.

Internationally the Bruges Group has been particularly active in supporting Euroscepticism in Estonia and discussing issues relating to Turkey and the EU.

=== 2016 Brexit referendum ===

Through events, meetings, and papers, the Bruges Group played a key part in the 2016 Brexit Referendum in which 51.9 percent of validated votes (37.4 per cent of the electorate) were in favour of leaving the European Union. Following the Leave campaign&#x27;s win in the referendum, historian Andrew Roberts credited in part director Robert Oulds and the Bruges Group with keeping the popular insurgency alive over more than four decades. In 2019, Jacob Rees-Mogg, MP for North East Somerset and the chairman of the European Research Group, delivered a speech to the Group stating that a &#x27;no deal&#x27; Brexit should not be &#x27;taken off the table&#x27;.

=== Outreach ===
The Bruges Group regularly holds public events that advocate for looser ties with Brussels and an independent Britain. The group&#x27;s director, Robert Oulds, is sometimes quoted in the press and makes regular appearances on TV and radio discussing European issues. Spokesmen for the Bruges Group have also appeared on BBC TV News, ITN; Sky News; The Daily Politics; BBC World Service; BBC Radio 5 Live and international media outlets. The organization regularly publishes working papers, leaflets, press releases, and interviews with politicians.

Denis MacShane, a former Labour politician and convicted fraudster, remarked that the Bruges Group &#x27;carries a great deal of anti-EU material but set within the bounds of reasonable discourse&#x27;. The Bruges Group is also sometimes asked by the media to comment on the positions and policies of the Conservative Party.

The Bruges Group is also active on various social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. The group regularly posts updates and information about events, articles, and recently published blog posts, as well as relevant Brexit and EU related news.

<text>A local post is a mail service that operates only within a limited geographical area, typically a city or a single transportation route. Historically, some local posts have been operated by governments, while others, known as private local posts have been for-profit companies. Today, many stamp collectors operate hobbyists&#x27; local posts, issuing their own postal stamps known as &quot;locals&quot; or &quot;cinderellas&quot; for other collectors but rarely carrying any mail.

==Official local posts==
Government local posts go back to at least 1680, when the Penny Post was established in London to handle intra-city mail delivery at a uniform rate of one penny.

From 1840 onwards, when postage stamps were first introduced, special stamps were often issued; for instance the cantons of Switzerland issued stamps for use within a canton, and inscribed them &quot;Poste-Local&quot; or &quot;Orts-Post&quot;. The Russian province of Wenden issued stamps for a local post from 1862 to 1901, while Nicaragua issued stamps for Zelaya only, due to its use of a different currency.

In rural Russia Zemstvo Post handled local mail independently of the central government; some of these lasted until the 1917 revolution.

==Private local posts==
Many countries have had private local posts at one time or another. Usually these operated with the acquiescence of the government, and at other time in competition. Types of local posts included intra-city systems, transcontinental delivery (such as the Pony Express), and riverboat routes. Many of these existed for only short periods, and little is known of their operations. Some of their stamps are among the great rarities of philately.

In 1865 the local post distribution company &quot;Liannos et Cie&quot; was established in Constantinople to distribute mail arriving in the city which was not addressed in Arabic as the staff of the Ottoman Postal Service were unable to read the Latin alphabet. The stamps were printed by Perkins Bacon from plates that are now held in the museum of the Royal Philatelic Society London. In 1866 a second service was set up on behalf of the Egyptian post office operating in the city to solve the same problem. Both services were short lived.

In 1895, W. Frese &amp; Co. of San Francisco, acting as an agent of the Oceanic Phosphate Company, issued a series of postage stamps for mail carried between California at the company&#x27;s guano mining operations on Clipperton Island, which ended in 1898.

In 2012, Penny Farthing Post in Bude, Cornwall, England, operated a mail service for Bude, Stratton, and Poughill delivering post on a penny farthing bicycle for 25 pence. Graham Eccles printed his own stamps and set up the service in response to the Royal Mail raising postage stamp prices to 60 pence. Closed June 2012, due to excessive volumes of post.

In 2013, Welly Post was established as a private carrier of local mail by EJ Teare Newsagents in Wellington, Somerset, England. Local delivery was limited to the village of Wellington and miles outside the village. The service was established after customers complained about the high price of postage.

==Private local posts of the United States==
Private local posts typically issue their own stamps, which can become collectors&#x27; items. These stamps are typically cancelled with special cancellations, and their first day of issue can be thus commemorated.

===American Letter Mail Company===
In 1844, Lysander Spooner founded the American Letter Mail Company, competing with the legal monopoly of the United States Post Office (USPO), now the United States Postal Service (USPS), in violation of the Private Express Statutes. It succeeded in delivering mail for lower prices, but the U.S. government challenged Spooner with legal measures, eventually forcing him to cease operations in 1851.

===Hawai&#x27;i Post===
From the late 1990s to 2014, the Honolulu-based messenger service Hawai&#x27;i Post printed stamps for use with its local delivery service for Waikiki.

===Independent Postal System of America===
In 1968, Thomas M. Murray (1927–2003) founded the Independent Postal System of America (IPSA) as a nationwide commercial carrier of Third and Fourth Class Mail, in direct competition with the United States Post Office (USPO), now the United States Postal Service (USPS). But in 1971, when the company entered the First Class delivery business, they endured a number of lawsuits brought against them, which finally led to the company&#x27;s collapse in the mid-1970s. The company issued a number of stamps during the years of its operation, including commemoratives for Lyndon B. Johnson, Martin Luther King Jr. and Charles Lindbergh before the USPS did.

===Rattlesnake Island===
Rattlesnake Island is an island located on Lake Erie near Put-In-Bay, northeast of Port Clinton, Ohio, and had the only USPS-sanctioned local post operating in the United States. For many years, service was provided by way of a Ford Trimotor which shuttled mail between the island and the mainland. From 1966 to 1989, USPS mail was routed by way of Port Clinton, Ohio. It was restarted in 2005 and ran till 2010 by the founder Dr. James Frackelton until passed away 11-30-2012. Outgoing mail from the island entered the USPS mail stream by way of Sandusky, Ohio. The RILP lay dormant until life long Port Clinton resident, Dave Gill relaunched the local post with the first new issue on 11-10-2022 of Commercial Vessels servicing the Lake Erie Islands. The next issue &quot;Battle of Lake Erie&quot; is scheduled for 9-10-2023, the 210 year anniversary of the battle. Griffing Flying Services has the RILP contract and is back in Port Clinton, Ohio at the same location as the 1966-1989 local post mail was serviced by. 

==Hobbyists&#x27; local posts==
Today&#x27;s local posters issue their local post &quot;stamps&quot;, and issue a variety of commemorative &quot;stamps&quot; covering a wide range of events or personal interests, of subjects that are not normally issued by their own countries&#x27; postal services.

In some cases these modern-day local posts have issued stamp subjects before their own country issued the same subject. The Free State Local Post issued an Audie Murphy stamp long before the US Postal Service issued one of the same subject. The Ascension AAF Local Post, located on the island of Ascension in the South Atlantic Ocean, in 1972 commemorated the anniversary of the first aircraft to land at Ascension Island. This same subject was commemorated by the Ascension Island postal system in 1982.

This sort of local post is effectively a &quot;home-brewed&quot; postal system, and the typical hobbyist carries little, if any, mail (though some do carry mail over a short distance for themselves or a few people).

The Local Post Collectors&#x27; Society established in 1972, coordinates communication among local posters. The LPCS issues a regular bulletin &quot;The Poster&quot; to its members around the world, relating stories of local posts, showing new issues and other related items.

<doc id="415263" wikidata="Q10753264" url="?curid=415263" title="Common practice period">
<text>In European art music, the common practice period was the period of about 250 years during which the tonal system was regarded as the only basis for composition. It began when composers&#x27; use of the tonal system had clearly superseded earlier systems, and ended when some composers began using significantly modified versions of the tonal system, and began developing other systems as well. Most features of common practice (the accepted concepts of composition during this time) persisted from the mid-Baroque period through the Classical and Romantic periods, roughly from 1650 to 1900. There was much stylistic evolution during these centuries, with patterns and conventions flourishing and then declining, such as the sonata form. The most prominent unifying feature throughout the period is a harmonic language to which music theorists can today apply Roman numeral chord analysis; however, the &quot;common&quot; in common practice does not directly refer to any type of harmony, rather it refers to the fact that for over two hundred years only one system was used.

==Technical features==

===Harmony===

The harmonic language of this period is known as &quot;common-practice tonality&quot;, or sometimes the &quot;tonal system&quot; (though whether tonality implies common-practice idioms is a question of debate). Common-practice tonality represents a union between harmonic function and counterpoint. In other words, individual melodic lines, when taken together, express harmonic unity and goal-oriented progression. In tonal music, each tone in the diatonic scale functions according to its relationship to the tonic (the fundamental pitch of the scale). While diatonicism forms the basis for the tonal system, the system can withstand considerable chromatic alteration without losing its tonal identity.

Throughout the common-practice period, certain harmonic patterns span styles, composers, regions, and epochs. Johann Sebastian Bach and Richard Strauss, for instance, may both write passages that can be analysed according to the progression I-ii-V-I, despite vast differences in style and context. Such harmonic conventions can be distilled into the familiar chord progressions with which musicians analyse and compose tonal music.

Various popular idioms of the twentieth century differ from the standardized chord progressions of the common-practice period. While these later styles incorporate many elements of the tonal vocabulary (such as major and minor chords), the function of these elements is not identical to classical models of counterpoint and harmonic function. For example, in common-practice harmony, a major triad built on the fifth degree of the scale (V) is unlikely to progress directly to a root position triad built on the fourth degree of the scale (IV), but the reverse of this progression (IV–V) is quite common. By contrast, the V–IV progression is readily acceptable by many other standards; for example, this transition is essential to the &quot;shuffle&quot; blues progression&#x27;s last line (V–IV–I–I), which has become the orthodox ending for blues progressions at the expense of the original last line (V–V–I–I).

===Rhythm===
Coordination of the various parts of a piece of music through an externalized metre is a deeply rooted aspect of common-practice music. Rhythmically, common practice metric structures generally include:

# Clearly enunciated or implied pulse at all levels, with the fastest levels rarely being extreme
# Metres, or pulse groups, in two-pulse or three-pulse groups, most often two
# Metre and pulse groups that, once established, rarely change throughout a section or composition
# Synchronous pulse groups on all levels: all pulses on slower levels coincide with strong pulses on faster levels
# Consistent tempo throughout a composition or section
# Tempo, beat length, and measure length chosen to allow one time signature throughout the piece or section

===Duration===
Durational patterns typically include:

# Small or moderate duration complement and range, with one duration (or pulse) predominating in the duration hierarchy, are heard as the basic unit throughout a composition. Exceptions are most frequently extremely long, such as pedal tones; or, if they are short, they generally occur as the rapidly alternating or transient components of trills, tremolos, or other ornaments.
# Rhythmic units are based on metric or intrametric patterns, though specific contrametric or extrametric patterns are signatures of certain styles or composers. Triplets and other extrametric patterns are usually heard on levels higher than the basic durational unit or pulse.
# Rhythmic gestures of a limited number of rhythmic units, sometimes based on a single or alternating pair.
# Thetic (i.e., stressed), anacrustic (i.e., unstressed), and initial rest rhythmic gestures are used, with anacrustic beginnings and strong endings possibly most frequent and upbeat endings most rare.
# Rhythmic gestures are repeated exactly or in variation after contrasting gestures. There may be one rhythmic gesture almost exclusively throughout an entire composition, but complete avoidance of repetition is rare.
# Composite rhythms confirm the metre, often in metric or even note patterns identical to the pulse on specific metric level.

Patterns of pitch and duration are of primary importance in common practice melody, while tone quality is of secondary importance. Durations recur and are often periodic; pitches are generally diatonic.

<doc id="415264" wikidata="Q2539476" url="?curid=415264" title="Zoids">
<text>is a Japanese science fiction media franchise created by Tomy that feature giant robots (or &quot;mecha&quot;) called Zoids, with designs being based on animals; including dinosaurs, mammals, insects, arachnids and mythological creatures.

The franchise started with a plamo kit line and includes six main anime TV series (&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Wild&quot;, &quot;Wild Zero&quot;), as well as several video games and manga products.

==Model kit lines==
There have been a number of different Zoids model lines over the years, both in Japan and other countries. Between these lines, over 200 different designs have been released, some several times over. Several companies outside of Takara-Tomy have produced Zoids kits. This has led to Zoids being made as die-cast figures, highly detailed posing kits, smaller action figures and even PVC figurines.

===Mechabonica===
The predecessors to Zoids. Released in 1982, &quot;Mechabonica&quot; was technically not a Zoids line, but is counted as such by collectors as it consisted of three models that would later be re-released as the first three Zoids (Garius, Elephantus, and Glidoler). The line was not very successful and was quickly dropped by Tomy.

===Starzeta===
Starzeta was the Spanish version of the Mechabonica line. Since Tomy had no direct marketing power in Spain during the 80s the models were released under licence by a smaller company (Feber) but unfortunately the line performed even worse than its Japanese counterpart. The same 3 models were released but bizarrely they were given new color schemes; grey parts became silver and the dark blue caps became bright blue. The models were not given names but are listed as Starzeta I, II and III.

SZ IV (Garantula), SZ V (Aquadon) and SZ VI (Gorgodos) were supposedly planned as a continuation of the series but their release status is currently unknown.

The models are incredibly rare (even more so than the Japanese Mechabonica) and demand is boosted even further by their unique color schemes.

===Original American release===
TOMY sold the Mechabonica line in the United States and Europe in late 1982, under the name Zoids. The line was far more successful than Mechabonica, which led TOMY to reintroduce the line in Japan under the new name.

Later, a pair of original Zoids, the Power Zoids Tank and Serpent, were created exclusively for the European and North American markets and were never released in Japan. Other Zoids like the Bigasaur (renamed to Giant ZRK) were also released. Radio Shack released the Mammoth Zoid in the US at the same time. While not a part of the release, it is generally counted with them.
The Original American Release is commonly abbreviated as OAR by fans and collectors.

===Original Japanese release===
In 1983, following the success of the OAR, TOMY reintroduced the Zoids line in Japan. The relaunched Japanese line, now entitled Zoids, was a success, running from 1983 until 1990. The Zoids line had its own &quot;Battle Story&quot; that was told serially on the backs of the model boxes and in catalogues.

Initially, the Zoids were divided into two distinct factions, the Helic Republic and the Zenebas Empire. In 1989, the Zenebas Empire was replaced with the Guylos Empire.

The Original Japanese Release is commonly abbreviated as OJR.

===Original European release===
Zoids were also released in Europe, (and to a limited extent in Australia, South Africa and South-East Asia), from 1984 to 1987 by TOMY. The models in this release were a mixture of ones directly ported over from the OJR, as well as recolored Zoids, including the rare &quot;Ghost Zoids&quot; line. Additionally, the Tank and Serpent Power Zoids from the OAR were released. Most of the Zoids in the line were renamed.

The Zoids in the release were divided into two distinct factions, which are the Blue Guardians and the Red Mutants. The line had its own story told in the UK Zoids comic.

The Original European Release is commonly abbreviated as OER.

===Robo Strux===
Robo Strux were released in the US and Canada by TOMY, in 1985–86. All the Zoids in the line were OJR Zoids, however, some versions of the same model retained their original (OJR) color scheme, whereas other versions of the same model received a distinctive Robo Strux color scheme. Thus, the Robo Strux line had two differently colored releases of several models. Based on their color schemes, the Zoids were divided into two factions, the heroic Blue Guardians and the evil Red Mutants. However, there was no accompanying story or media.

Due to the lack of marketing and the relatively high prices of the models, Robostrux was rather short-lived.

Robostrux is commonly abbreviated as RS.

===1:24 scale Zoids===
In 1988, TOMY launched a sub-line of the OJR, featuring larger-scale Zoids. The 1:24 line featured Zoids of similar size to existing ones, but scaled for larger pilots. Each kit came with a 3 inch tall action figure of the pilot. Like the regular Zoids line, the Zoids were divided into Helic and Zenebas factions.

The 1:24 Zoids were not a success, and were discontinued after a year.

===Zevle===
In 1990, TOMY re-released several of the 1:24 scale Zoids in a new line called Zevle. The Zoids were recolored from the OJR versions, and came with detailed, 3 inch tall action figures of the pilot and crew. The pilot figures were unpainted and on sprues, much like a model kit, and had to be assembled. The crew figures also came with accessories of guns and beam sabers. Zevle featured its own &quot;Battle Story&quot; on the boxes, but while it was similar to the Zoids Battle Story, it was unrelated to it.

Like the 1/24th Zoids, Zevle was a commercial failure and was discontinued.

===Technozoids===
Kenner acquired the rights to release Zoids in North America, releasing the Technozoids line in 1995–1996. The Zoids in the line were all recolors of earlier Zoids released in the OJR, although some were directly imported from the Zoids2 line. There were no distinct factions for the Zoids, and no backstory was given.

The Technozoids line was a failure and was discontinued after one year. A number of Zoids were left unreleased at the end of the line.

Technozoids is commonly abbreviated as TZ.

===Zoids 2===
TOMY released another line of Zoids in the UK and Europe (with a re-release in Australia and South-East Asia) in 1994. The Zoids 2 line featured very bright color schemes, with all the Zoids having at least some chromed parts. The Zoids also had unique stickers with odd swirling designs. The Zoids 2 line did not feature distinctive factions for the Zoids, but did have a backstory loosely based on (but not a continuation of) the UK Zoid comic, with the Zoids invading Earth and humanity&#x27;s last hope being to turn the Zoids against each other.

Like Technozoids, Zoids 2 was eventually discontinued.

Zoids 2 is commonly abbreviated as Z2.

===New Japanese release===
In 1999, TOMY relaunched the Zoids line in Japan, with subsequent releases elsewhere in Asia. Initially, the line consisted of recolored re-releases of older Zoids, but TOMY quickly began producing new Zoids designs. The Zoids were divided into Helic and Guylos factions, with the Zenebas Empire returning later. The OJR battle story was continued on the NJR boxes, with the Zoids Anime and Manga drawing on alternate versions of the New Battle Story&#x27;s events.

The line was abruptly discontinued in August 2004. By the end of the line, there were still thirty-three Zoids from the OJR line that had yet to be re-released.

The New Japanese Release is unofficially abbreviated as NJR.

===Customise Parts===
Along with the re-launch of the Zoids line, TOMY also launched a line known as Customise Parts or simply CP. The line consisted of additional weapons and equipment that could be added onto Zoids models. The line was a mixture of new parts and re-issues of parts originally included in various OJR models (as well as the Empire and Republic Customization Kits).

The Customise Parts line was discontinued in 2002.

===Blox===
In 2002, TOMY introduced a new line of non-motorised Zoids called Blox, which featured flexible construction. Blox Zoids can be easily disassembled and combined with each other, as well as with regular Zoids.

===Toys Dream Project===
In 2002, Toys Dream Project began a line of limited Zoids releases. The line consisted of a mixture of new recolors of existing Zoids and re-releases of older versions of some Zoids in their &quot;OJR&quot; colors, as well as kits paired with uniquely colored customize parts.

===Zoids: Build Customize Mobilize===
Following the launch of the &quot;NJR&quot;, Hasbro licensed Zoids for release in North America and South-East Asia in 2001. Like the &quot;NJR&quot;, the line was divided into Republic and Empire factions, with the Anime providing the backstory. Initially, the Hasbro line consisted of just re-releases of Zoids from the &quot;NJR&quot;. However, they later began developing their own Zoid designs, as well as co-developing others with TOMY. Additionally, Hasbro had planned to re-release several &quot;OJR&quot; Zoids that had not been released in the &quot;NJR&quot;.

Although it was initially successful, Hasbro suspended the line in 2004, due to poor sales. The cancellation of the line left a number of new Zoids unreleased, including most of those not yet re-released by TOMY. Much of the leftover stock was later released by Hasbro in Australia and the UK.

In Australia and South-East Asia, these Zoids were released by TOMY. These countries were identical to Hasbro&#x27;s Zoids, but featured TOMY branding on the box. In the UK the Zoids boxes featured slightly different logos to both Australia and the US. The UK release featured several Zoids designs and color schemes that were not available in the US.

===Z-Builders===
Any Blox Zoids that were released by Hasbro were sold as part of the line known as Z-Builders. Most of the Z-Builders were re-releases of the &quot;NJR&quot; Blox line, but the line included several Hasbro-designed Zoids, as well as individual releases of Blox Zoids that did not occur in Japan. The Z-Builders line was suspended alongside the motorized models. Z-Builders was released in Australia and the Pacific featuring TOMY branding instead of Hasbro branding.

===Fuzors===
In late 2004, TOMY launched a new Zoids line to tie into the &quot;&quot; anime that was then showing on Japanese TV. The line was composed entirely of recolors of older Blox and Zoids. Some models were altered slightly, or packaged with additional parts, mainly to allow different Zoids to connect (or &quot;fuse&quot;). The line also featured a number of Zoids that were previously only released in North America.

The line was abruptly halted in early 2005, with several items unreleased.

Fuzors is commonly abbreviated as FZ.

===Genesis===
In early 2005, another new Zoid line was launched, to tie into the &quot;&quot; anime. The line consists of a mixture of old designs, new designs and older designs with new parts. The line is most notable for the much-anticipated reissues of Houndsoldier and Gilvader.

Reactions to the line were mixed; the re-releases of older designs (which included several OJR Zoids not previously re-released) were well received. The new designs, namely the Bio-Zoids which had rubber armor, did not do so well, having been plagued by quality control issues and production errors.

Genesis is commonly abbreviated as GZ. An alternate abbreviation, GB, is used for the Bio-Zoids released as part of this line.

===Neo-Blox===
Released in May 2006, the Neo-Blox are an improvement on the previous &quot;Blox&quot; line, primarily due to the greater range of poseability the &#x27;Blox and peg&#x27; connection system has.

Two sublines have also been released. The first is the &quot;Legends Series&quot;, which features Zoids from previous releases, but redesigned to be the same size as the Neo-Blox Zoids, and modified to use the same connector system. The second are the &quot;Custom Blox&quot;; subline appeared to be on hold, with Tomy instead focusing on the Legend Blox sub-line. With the cancellation of all unreleased Neo-Blox in early 2007, the line was effectively dead.

The Neo-Blox is abbreviated as either NBZ or NB. Alternate abbreviations are used for the Legends Series (LB) and the Custom Blox (CBZ).

===Academy Zoids===
Academy, a company from Korea better known for model airplanes and ships, re-released many of the NJR Zoid models, as well as some Zoids from the Customize Parts, Fuzors and Genesis series. In most cases, these Academy Zoids have nearly identical packaging to their Japanese predecessors save for the Korean language and a sticker bearing the Academy logo. Though the quality of the Academy Zoids were on par with their Japanese counterparts in the early 2000s, the age and repeated use of some molds, such as Command Wolf and Liger Zero, has caused degradation in the line. The line continues to sell Zoids exclusively in Korean markets.

===High-end Master Model===
Starting in late 2006, the High-end Master Model line, commonly abbreviated HMM, is a joint effort between Tomy and Kotobukiya. The line advertises high-quality, highly detailed, pose-able model kits based on designs of existing Zoids.

===Evo Drive Zoids===
Miniature Zoids
Starting in late 2006, the High-end Master Model line, commonly abbreviated HMM, is a joint effort between Tomy and Kotobukiya. The line advertises high-quality, highly detailed, pose-able model kits based on designs of existing Zoids.

===Zoids Graphics===
Released in Summer 2007 onward, the Graphics line are reissues of the OJR model kits released in the 1980s. They feature the model kit in special windowed packaging along with bonus parts or miniature figures and a booklet with early battle story information.

===Zoids 25th: Rebirth Century===
Starting in 2008 as part of the line&#x27;s 25th anniversary, this new Zoids line contains both re-releases of 80s Zoids and entirely new designs. The backstory is set between the end of the original line and the start of the new Japanese release, covering the Zoidians&#x27; efforts to rebuild after the meteor disaster and the conflicts that come with it.

===Zoids Anime 10th Anniversary===
Starting in 2009, as a tribute to both the NJR Zoids Release and the Chaotic Century Anime series, the Anime 10th Anniversary is a limited line of correctly colored model kits based on those piloted by characters in the Anime series. The line abruptly stopped after just two of the kits were released. is what this 10th anniversary is based upon. It was only ended in 1999.

===Revoltech Zoids===
A company called Kaiyodo released four Zoids as Revoltech figures under the Yamaguchi line. Two Zoid types, the Blade Liger and the Geno Breaker, were produced with the Liger coming in three different colors. These Zoids were made to be highly poseable, having more joints than any Revoltech before. These Zoids are smaller than the motorized Zoid models but larger than the Hasbro action figures.

===Yamato Zoids===
Yamato released two Shield Ligers and a set of Beam-Cannons for the Zoids between 2010 and 2012. These Zoids had die-cast metal parts as well as fine details and many points of articulation for movable parts. The action models dwarfed their predecessors in size and weight. The first Shield Liger was colored like the hero Zoid of the Chaotic Century series and included three small character figures. The second was painted black and silver and included the Beam Cannon like the limited NJR model, the Shield Liger DCS-J, it was based on. The Yamato Shield Liger was released in the United States and is the only line to be sold in the U.S. since Z-Builders.

===Modeler&#x27;s Spirit Series===
For the 30th anniversary of Tomy&#x27;s main Zoids line, the franchise was treated to a new line of Zoids kits. Abbreviated MSS, the Modeler&#x27;s Spirit Series were produced by TOMYTEC at a 1:144 scale, much smaller than previous lines. These Zoids are not motorized but do feature posing gimmicks similar to Mobile Suit models, which have used the word &#x27;gimmick&#x27; for movable parts longer. Zoids in the MSS line also include a display base. The first MSS Zoids, released in January 2013, were a Shield Liger and Hammer Rock.

===Zoids Original===
Another event for the 30th anniversary was announced on Takara-Tomy&#x27;s main Zoids web page. Titled Zoids Original, the line features redesigned motorized kits. As with other core Zoids lines, the new series includes a tie-in Battle Story. A model called the Mirage Fox was the first kit to be released in the new line.

==Battle story==
 &quot;Battle story&quot; is a fictitious timeline of events that features on the boxes, manuals and cataloges of some Zoid model kits. Battle Story allows collectors to piece together information about the Zoids universe from the perspective of certain Zoids, and their roles in the various timelines. None of the English-language model kits feature this story.

===Original battle story===
Beginning fairly early after the start of the original Japanese Zoid releases, the battle story first introduced the conflict between two rival nations: the Helic Republic and Zenebas Empire. Their main weapons were Zoids, living war machines built from metal-based lifeforms native to planet Zi. The Zenebas Zoids were mostly red and silver and more armored, the Helic more skeletal and favoring blue and grey.

The line expanded and drew in fans, and was thus given a proper ongoing story, with the creators wanting to appeal to fans of science fiction and animation. The two nations&#x27; conflict turned into an ongoing series of stories included on the boxes and published in various magazines and books. History of Zoids, published in 1985, covered Zi&#x27;s history as a planet wrecked by natural disasters and conflict, King Helic&#x27;s uniting the original tribes and formation of the Republic, the Empire&#x27;s bitter splitting off after his son Helic II took over and the younger Zenebas was betrayed by the era&#x27;s politicians, and much of the earlier battles in the resulting war over territory on the Central Continent.

As more advanced model kits were added to the line, a human element was added to the story: mainly, a ship from Earth (the Globally 3) crashlanding on Zi. Earth technology made its way to both sides, accelerating the arms race and making for many stronger Zoids.

In 1986, the Ultrasaurus was released, and billed in-story as the machine that would defeat the Empire. It nearly succeeded, but Zenebas and his forces fled to the Dark Continent Nyx, soon returning with new-model Zoids like the Death Saurer. The Republic was driven back and forced to hold the Empire off with guerrilla warfare in the mountains, paving the way for the brief 1/24 scale line (notable for featuring the Battle Rover as the winner of a fan design contest). The Republic&#x27;s counterattack came in the form of the Mad Thunder, and as Zenebas again turned to the Dark Continent for help, he was betrayed by Guylos, whose new &quot;Dark Army&quot; Zoids attacked and absorbed the Empire Army.

1989 thus marked a drastic change in the line&#x27;s focus, the first catalogue even calling it &quot;Zoids New Century&quot; (a title unrelated to the anime series Zoids New Century /Zero). The more ambiguous conflict became more &quot;good versus evil&quot;, with Guylos described as having a &quot;merciless, cruel fighting style [...] beyond imagination&quot; in Tomy&#x27;s material, and Shogakukan&#x27;s version of the battle story abandoning telling things from both sides to give only the viewpoint of a Republic soldier portrayed as a hero. There were no windup kits released after the Cannonfort in April 1989, the toys instead focusing on &quot;Gradeups&quot;, curvy techno-organic designs with vacuum metalized parts, build-it-yourself motor boxes, and interchangeable custom parts.

The line ended in the late months of 1990, King Gojulas and Descat marking the final designs. Battle story Zi came down to a final showdown between the nigh-unstoppable King Gojulas and various Dark Army Zoids (including Gilvader), only to have the conflict cut short as a comet struck Zi&#x27;s third moon, raining down meteor destruction and leaving the entire planet in disarray.

===New battle story===
The Zoids revival in 1999 included both an anime and a new battle story. After decades of peace, the current Emperor died, leaving only the young Rudolph as his heir. His regent, Prozen, took the opportunity to resume the conflict between the Guylos Empire and the Republic. Early on, both sides used their past Zoids, the model line focusing entirely on reissues of popular past kits.

As technology advanced, entirely new designs were produced, the first being the Rev Raptor and Geno Saurer. Many of them were also tie ins to the Chaotic Century anime, including special pilot figures of characters who used them while the Zoids did different things in the battle story. The accelerating arms race came to a head with the Death Stinger, which proved an uncontrollable berserker and only served to further the Guylos Empire&#x27;s gradual loss.

Their retreat to the Dark Continent was not as it seemed, and in 2004 (four years after the first anime series finished its run), Prozen was revealed to be Zenebas&#x27; son...and the current ruler of the Republic his daughter under the alias Louise Elena Camford. The entire war until now had been a ruse to weaken both nations, and in a bitter coup ending with his own death Prozen engineered the rise of Neo Zenebas. His son took over the reins, driving the Republic forces back to the Eastern Continent.

The toyline shifted to match, introducing the new posable &quot;Blox&quot; kits (first sold in 2002) as the creation of humans who had fled there to remain neutral in the original conflict. They sold their work to both sides during the Republic&#x27;s bid to regain their homeland. The ensuing battles—and the battle story portion of the toyline—ended with the Republic reclaiming their capital, forcing the Zenebas Empire back to the western half of the Central Continent.

===Three Tigers===
Providing a glimpse into Zi&#x27;s future and released in 2004, the Three Tigers line consisted of all of six kits: three legendary Tiger-type Zoids (one formed via a combination of two separate kits) and the Dekalt Dragon (also a combination). It was very closely followed by the Fuzors line and its direct anime tie-in (also in 2004), and featured a similar setting: Zoids are owned mainly by private citizens, with fightworthy ones restricted to peacekeeping forces and licensed sports battlers.

Two large Zoid manufacturing corporations, ZOITEC and Zi-Arms, became considerable powers on Zi. Discovering the cores of ancient tiger Zoids, they set out to create their own versions. Part of Zi-Arms proved to have an ulterior motive: seizing power and reviving the glory days of the Empire with the Dekalt Dragon, Brastle Tiger, and a Mega Death Saurer. The two ZOITEC Tigers (Whitz and Rayse) team up with a rebelling Brastle to stop the Saurer, however ... and then vanish, the story booklet included with the Brastle Tiger kit describing them as &quot;disappearing back into legend&quot;.

===Rebirth Century===
While the old battle story and the 1999 revival left nearly thirty years post meteor disaster undetailed, Tomy&#x27;s Rebirth Century revival (2008–2010) picks up where the old story left off. After retelling the final battle with King Gojulas, it moves on to a Zi torn by magnetic storms and faction tensions, using it as a reason to rerelease both old kits (Gilvader and King Gojulas included) and new designs.

===Onslaught===
For the 30th anniversary of the OJR line, Takara-Tomy revived the Battle Story on the main Zoids website. Prior to the anniversary, this story was released as a book series titled &quot;Zoids Concept Art&quot; in 2010. Though the overall plot is the same, some differences between the OJR and the Onslaught version occur. Also, the new version of the Battle Story is digitally illustrated with highly stylized Zoids instead of featuring pictures of the actual Zoids models like the older lines did. Episodes of this story can be viewed on the Tomy&#x27;s main Zoids web page.

==Anime==
The six anime series pertaining to Zoids are: &quot;&quot; and its sequel series &quot;Zoids: Guardian Force&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Zoids Wild&quot;. The first four series take place on the fictitious planet Zi. &quot;Zoids Wild&quot; is set on a post-apocalyptic version of Earth. Chaotic Century and Guardian Force aired as one series in the US, but they are considered two separate series by Takara Tomy.

===Chaotic Century (1999)===

&quot;Zoids: Chaotic Century&quot; is the first two Zoids anime series and consists of Chaotic Century and Guardian Force. Its setting is loosely based on that of Battle Story, and follows Van Flyheight as he meets an amnesiac girl called Fiona and an organoid called Zeke. As the series progresses, Van meets various opponents, such as Raven, and friends, like Moonbay and Irvine, and eventually ends up helping Fiona in her quest to regain her memory and to find a mysterious entity called the &quot;Zoid Eve&quot;. Their quest takes them into the thick of an ongoing war between the two factions of the Helic Republic and the Guylos Empire.

In the US the story of Chaotic Century is split into two seasons, with a time skip in the middle. In Japan &quot;Guardian Force&quot; is considered the second series. Three to four years after the initial arc (&quot;Chaotic Century&quot;), the second story (&quot;Guardian Force&quot;) begins. The two warring nations seen in the first arc have made peace, and to ensure it remains, they establish a joint military task force called the Guardian Force. Van becomes a part of this force, and after some time again goes searching for the elusive Zoid Eve. On the way, he meets up with both old and new friends and foes.

Despite being the first series created in Japan, Chaotic Century was the second series to be broadcast in English, following New Century.

As well as the anime series, there was a &quot;Chaotic Century&quot; manga published in Japan. It was later reproduced in English in North America by Viz Communications, and in Singapore in English by Chuang Yi. There are significant differences between the anime and manga, becoming more striking in the later issues.

===New Century (2001)===

&quot;Zoids: New Century&quot; takes place some time after the events of &quot;Guardian Force&quot;, however, aside from a few cameo appearances, there is no direct relation to the past series. In New Century Zoid battles have become a tournament-based fighting competition. The main character is Bit Cloud, a junk dealer, who forms part of the Blitz Team. He becomes a pilot of their Zoid, the Liger Zero, a temperamental Zoid that previously had been unpilotable. Bit and Liger form a partnership and end up joining the Blitz Team in their various league matches. He is aided by his teammates, Leena Toros, Brad Hunter, Jamie Hemeros, as well as their leader, Dr. Steve Toros.

Along the way, Bit&#x27;s unique Zoid gets the attention of the Backdraft Group, an organization who is trying to take over Zoid battles and make them more &quot;interesting&quot; by using illicit battles, often with no rules or regard to pilot safety. The Backdraft attempts to acquire the Liger Zero by any means possible.

New Century Zero has a number of animation cameos with Zoids from Chaotic Century and Guardian Force, which are the cause of much fan speculation but not explained. Moonbay&#x27;s Gustav can be seen in the background in one of the later episodes, the Backdraft shoots judge satellites down with a Death Stinger tail, the Death Saurer appearing as a model and in a background TV show, the three Geno Saurers that attack Berserk Fury, and the Ultrasaurus wreck on which Bit Cloud claims victory carries the Gravity Cannon on its side.

This was the first Zoids series to appear on American television, airing in Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Toonami&quot; block.

===Fuzors (2003)===

&quot;Zoids: Fuzors&quot; follows the adventures of team Mach Storm and RD, a novice Liger Zero pilot. They live in the technologically advanced Blue City, competing in Zoid battles. When a top team is wiped out by a pair of Zoids able to combine, it leads to a series of discoveries relating to special &quot;Fuzor&quot; Zoids and combinations: RD&#x27;s Liger Zero ends up partnered with the Fire Phoenix and later the Jet Falcon.

There&#x27;s something more sinister lurking behind the sports battles and RD&#x27;s rivalry with team Savage Hammer. As the series unfolds RD and his friends Helmut, Sigma, Hop, Sweet and Matt get caught up in a plot to take over the city. Eventually RD discovers the secret behind the mysterious &quot;Alpha Zoid&quot; and with the help of pilots from all over the city, defeats the Seismosaurus holding it under siege.

About half-way through the series, the show was removed from America&#x27;s Cartoon Network, ending on a cliffhanger. This was most likely a result of flagging ratings and toy sales, although its timeslot did not help matters. However, the full series aired in Australia and was later shown in Japan, getting full DVD releases in both countries.

===Genesis (2005)===

&quot;Zoids: Genesis&quot; aired in 2005. At a certain point in time, there was a great quake on Planet Zi. An enormous crack ran through the planet, stretching as far as the seabeds to the high mountains. Volcanoes erupted with fire, and the sky was covered in darkness. Many cities were destroyed as they were swallowed in large areas, sinking underwater. This was known as &quot;God&#x27;s Fury.&quot;

Before this large series of natural disasters, all civilizations were at their peak. All were destroyed by the disasters, and it was several thousand years before the inhabitants of Zi were able to re-establish themselves in any meaningful form. Survivors of the disasters gathered together and formed new civilizations; these groups searched for Zoids that are buried underground for human use.

The story begins in a village whose most precious item, a giant blade, is worshipped as a holy symbol. Ruuji, a teenage boy, discovers an ancient Liger-type Zoid, the Murasame Liger, while on a deep water salvage operation. His village is suddenly attacked by skeletal &quot;Bio-Zoids&quot; intent on securing the powerful Generator located in the village. During the attack, Ruuji awakens Murasame Liger and fends off the Bio-Zoids, however the Generator on which the village depends becomes damaged in subsequent attacks. Seeking to repair it, Ruuji sets off on a journey to find a mechanic capable of fixing a generator.

===Wild (2018)===

&quot;Zoids Wild&quot; is the newest Zoids anime series. It began airing on July 7, 2018 on Mainichi Broadcasting System and Tokyo Broadcasting System. It is notable that characters are depicted riding on top of Zoids rather than within an enclosed cockpit as in previous Zoids media.

==UK Zoids comics==
In the 1980s, a Zoids tie-in strip was published in the Marvel UK title &quot;Secret Wars&quot;. On the back of this, it gained its own weekly title, &quot;Spider-Man and Zoids&quot;. This story has no continuity with any other, it was created to go along with the original UK (and subsequently Australian) release of model kits. The comic is notable for featuring early work by Grant Morrison, including the epic and apocalyptic Black Zoid storyline.

<text>The Man Who Was Thursday: A Nightmare is a 1908 novel by G. K. Chesterton. The book has been described as a metaphysical thriller.

==Plot summary==
Chesterton prefixed the novel with a poem written to Edmund Clerihew Bentley, revisiting the pair&#x27;s early history and the challenges presented to their early faith by the times.

In Victorian-era London, Gabriel Syme is recruited at Scotland Yard to a secret anti-anarchist police corps. Lucian Gregory, an anarchistic poet, lives in the suburb of Saffron Park. Syme meets him at a party and they debate the meaning of poetry. Gregory argues that revolt is the basis of poetry. Syme demurs, insisting the essence of poetry is not revolution but law. He antagonises Gregory by asserting that the most poetical of human creations is the timetable for the London Underground. He suggests Gregory is not really serious about anarchism, which so irritates Gregory that he takes Syme to an underground anarchist meeting place, under oath not to disclose its existence to anyone, revealing his public endorsement of anarchy is a ruse to make him seem harmless, when in fact he is an influential member of the local chapter of the European anarchist council.

The central council consists of seven men, each using the name of a day of the week as a cover; the position of Thursday is about to be elected by Gregory&#x27;s local chapter. Gregory expects to win the election but just before, Syme reveals to Gregory after an oath of secrecy that he is a secret policeman. In order to make Syme think that the anarchists are harmless after all, Gregory speaks very unconvincingly to the local chapter, so that they feel that he is not zealous enough for the job. Syme makes a rousing anarchist speech in which he denounces everything that Gregory has said and wins the vote. He is sent immediately as the chapter&#x27;s delegate to the central council.

In his efforts to thwart the council, Syme eventually discovers that five of the other six members are also undercover detectives; each was employed just as mysteriously and assigned to defeat the Council. They soon find out they were fighting each other and not real anarchists; such was the mastermind plan of their president, Sunday. In a surreal conclusion, Sunday is unmasked as only seeming to be an anarchist; in fact, he is a proponent of state power like the detectives. Sunday is unable to give an answer to the question of why he caused so much trouble and pain for the detectives. Gregory, the only real anarchist, seems to challenge the false council. His accusation is that they, as rulers, have never suffered like Gregory and their other subjects and so their power is illegitimate. Syme refutes the accusation immediately, because of the terrors inflicted by Sunday on the rest of the council.

The dream ends when Sunday is asked if he has ever suffered. His last words, &quot;can ye drink of the cup that I drink of?&quot;, is the question Jesus asks St. James and St. John in the Gospel of Mark, chapter 10, vs 38–39, a rhetorical question intended to demonstrate that the disciples are wrong to covet his glory because they are unable to bear the suffering for the sins of the world for which he is destined.

==Annotations and details==

Martin Gardner edited &quot;The Annotated Thursday&quot;, which provides a great deal of biographical and contextual information in the form of footnotes, along with the text of the book, original reviews from the time of the book&#x27;s first publication and comments made by Chesterton on the book. 

The literary critic Ian Fletcher notes that Chesterton&#x27;s &quot;Saffron Park&quot;, with which the novel begins, is a parody of the garden suburb of Bedford Park in Chiswick, with its red brick buildings, &quot;the outburst of a speculative builder&quot; (Jonathan Carr), &quot;faintly tinged with art&quot; (the suburb was considered aesthetic, and was home to many artists), and its Queen Anne architecture. Fletcher comments that Chesterton met his future wife in the suburb, and that the description was somewhat inaccurate, as Chesterton liked to dramatise.

The costumes the detectives don towards the end of the book represent what was created on their respective day. Sunday, &quot;the sabbath&quot; and &quot;the peace of God,&quot; sits upon a throne in front of them. The name of the girl Syme likes, Rosamond, is derived from &quot;Rosa Mundi,&quot; meaning &quot;Rose of the World&quot; in Latin.

==Influence and critical assessments==
Many have noted the influence of &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot; on surrealism and spy thrillers. Chesterton&#x27;s book allegedly inspired the Irish Republican Michael Collins with the idea &quot;if you didn&#x27;t seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out&quot;. 

The novelist Kingsley Amis describes his reading of the novel as &quot;thrilling&quot;, comparing Chesterton to &quot;first-rate action-writer[s] like Ian Fleming or Dick Francis&quot; for suspense, but also &quot;persuading you that something wonderful is afoot, that the events described have a mysterious and momentous significance you hardly dare guess at&quot;. Amis calls it &quot;the most thrilling book I have ever read&quot;, admiring the twists and turns of the plot:

In his final essay, Christopher Hitchens wrote: &quot;As to the durability or importance of GKC as a fictionist: the late Sir Kingsley Amis once told me that he reread &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot; every year, and on one of his annual visitations wrote a tribute. That novel, with its evocation of eeriness and solitude, and its fascination with anonymity, has been credited by some with a share of influence on Franz Kafka.&quot; 

Critic Adam Gopnik concurs: &quot;&quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot; is one of the hidden hinges of twentieth-century writing, the place where, before our eyes, the nonsense-fantastical tradition of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear pivots and becomes the nightmare-fantastical tradition of Kafka and Borges. It is also, along with Chesterton&#x27;s &quot;The Napoleon of Notting Hill&quot;, the nearest thing that this masterly writer wrote to a masterpiece.&quot;

== Debate on the novel&#x27;s pessimism ==
Like most of Chesterton&#x27;s fiction, the story is full of Christian allegory. Chesterton, a Protestant at this time (he joined the Roman Catholic Church about 15 years later), suffered from a brief bout of depression during his college days. He insisted: &quot;The book ... was not intended to describe the real world as it was, or as I thought it was, even when my thoughts were considerably less settled than they are now. It was intended to describe the world of wild doubt and despair
which the pessimists were generally describing at that date; with just a gleam of hope in some double meaning of the doubt, which even the pessimists felt in some fitful fashion&quot;.

Chesterton later said that he had written this book to affirm that goodness and right were at the heart of every aspect of the world. However, the philosopher John Gray argues the story is more pessimistic than Christian:

==Adaptations==

===Mercury Theatre adaptation===
On 5 September 1938 &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; presented an abridged radio-play adaptation, written by Orson Welles, who was a great admirer of Chesterton. He omitted most of &quot;Chapter 14: The Six Philosophers&quot;, which contains most of the metaphysical speculation. This was almost two months before the infamous &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast.

===APJAC Productions musical adaptation===
It was reported in January 1967 that Jerome Hellman and Arthur P. Jacobs&#x27; APJAC Productions were preparing movie projects including a musical adaptation of Chesterton&#x27;s novel by Leslie Bricusse. The film was not made.

===BBC radio adaptations===

There have been at least three adaptations broadcast by BBC radio over the years.

On Sunday 13 July 1947, the BBC broadcast a live theatrical adaptation by Cecil Chesterton and Ralph Neale, which was produced by Jan Bussell and starred Harold Scott as Thursday, Peter Bull as Sunday, Stringer Davis as Comrade Witherspoon, Arnold Diamond as Colonel du Croix, Richard Goolden as Friday, and Campbell Singer as Wednesday.

A 90-minute adaptation was broadcast in 1975, dramatised by Ronald Barton and with John Samson as Thursday and Trevor Martin as Sunday. This adaptation was preserved in an off-air recording that was later discovered by the Radio Circle and re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2024 as part of a strand called &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot;.

In 1986 the BBC broadcast a four-part series dramatised by Peter Buckman and directed by Glyn Dearman. It featured Michael Hadley as Thursday/Gabriel Syme, Natasha Pyne as Rosamond and Edward de Souza as Wednesday/The Marquis de St. Eustache.

In 2005 the BBC broadcast the novel as read by Geoffrey Palmer, as thirteen half-hour parts. It has been re-broadcast several times since then, including in 2008 (one hundred years after first publication) 2016 and 2020.

===2016 film===
Hungarian filmmaker wrote and directed a film inspired by the novel, starring François Arnaud, Ana Ularu, and Jordi Mollà, which premiered on 21 June 2016 at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Juszt&#x27;s inspiration was his mentor, István Szabó.

==Popular culture==
The 2000 video game &quot;Deus Ex&quot; features several excerpts from the book and lists Gabriel Syme as a current resident of the &quot;Ton Hotel&quot;.

In Kim Newman&#x27;s &quot;Anno Dracula: 1895&quot;, the Council of Days, led by Sunday, exists and is plotting to overthrow Dracula during the tenth anniversary of his rule over Britain. The Council includes Gabriel Syme, Peter the Painter (Friday), and Newman&#x27;s recurring character Kate Reed.

In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Was October&quot;—an unwritten sequel to &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot;—appears in the Library of Dreams. 
&quot;Season of Mists&quot; ends with a quote from the fictional novel. In &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, the character Gilbert physically resembles G. K. Chesterton.

<text>De Morgen (; &quot;The Morning&quot;) is a Flemish newspaper with a circulation of 53,860. The paper is published in Antwerp, Belgium.

==History and profile==
&quot;De Morgen&quot; originates from a merger in 1978 of two socialist newspapers &#x27; (meaning &quot;Onwards&quot; in English) and &#x27; (meaning &quot;People&#x27;s Newspaper&quot; in English). The &quot;Vooruit&quot; was founded in Ghent by Edward Anseele and appeared the first time on 31 August 1884, just before the foundation of the Belgian Labour Party (Dutch: Belgische Werklieden Partij) in 1885.

&quot;De Morgen&quot; was modelled on French daily &quot;Liberation&quot;. The paper is published by De Persgroep which also publishes &quot;Het Laatste Nieuws&quot;.

&quot;De Morgen&quot; presents itself as an independent and progressive newspaper and a more dynamic alternative to its two competitors in the Flemish market, &quot;De Standaard&quot; and &quot;De Tijd&quot;. On the other hand, the paper is described as a leftist and socialistic publication. According to the former editor-in-chief , the Flemish press was &quot;de-pillarized&quot; under the influence of &quot;De Morgen&quot;.

The paper has won several prizes for its revolutionary lay-out. It has applied advanced printing technology to be able to print with greener, water-based ink and higher quality paper.

==Circulation==
The 2002 circulation of &quot;De Morgen&quot; was 68,359 copies. Its market share in the same year was 5.4%. The circulation of &quot;De Morgen&quot; was 57,248 copies in 2008. During the first quarter of 2009, the paper had a circulation of 76,439 copies. Its total circulation was 58,496 copies in 2009. It was 55,973 copies in 2010 and 55,936 copies in 2011.

<text>&lt;section begin=lead /&gt;
This is a list of artists primarily associated with the [[disco]] era of the 1970s and some of their most noteworthy disco hits. Numerous artists, not usually considered disco artists, implemented some of the styles and sounds of disco music, and are also included. This includes artists who have either been very important to the genre or have had a considerable amount of exposure (such as those that have been on a major label). Bands are listed by the first letter in their name (not including the words &quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, or &quot;the&quot;), and individuals are listed by last name.

<text>The Atlantic Hockey Association (AHA) was an NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Ice Hockey conference which operates primarily in the northeastern United States. It participated in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I as an ice hockey-only conference. Unlike several other college athletic conferences, Atlantic Hockey had no women&#x27;s division, though it shared some organizational and administrative roles (and three universities) with the women&#x27;s-only College Hockey America (CHA).

It was formed in 1997 and began play in the 1998–1999 season as the hockey division of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC). Within three years, it was granted an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. However, in 2003, Iona and Fairfield dropped hockey, leaving Canisius as the only full MAAC member that sponsored hockey. This proved somewhat problematic for MAAC Hockey, since conference bylaws only allowed full members to vote. On June 30, 2003, MAAC Hockey broke off from the MAAC and reorganized as Atlantic Hockey.

On June 6, 2023, it was announced that Atlantic Hockey would be merging all operations with CHA, effective in 2024. Details regarding this merger, including whether the new league would carry the Atlantic or College Hockey name, were to be announced at a later date. Shortly after the 2024 season, the new conference was announced as Atlantic Hockey America.

<doc id="415282" wikidata="Q780194" url="?curid=415282" title="List of kings of Athens">
<text>Before the Athenian democracy, the tyrants, and the Archons, the city-state of [[Athens]] was ruled by [[monarch|kings]]. Most of these are probably mythical or only semi-historical. The following lists contain the chronological order of the title King of Athens (also prescribed earlier as kings of Attica), a semi-mythological title.

==Earliest kings==
These three kings were supposed to have ruled before the flood of Deucalion. 

Other sources mentioned two other ancient rulers of Athens:

* Porphyrion - an earlier Athenian king than Actaeus. He was the reputed founder of the sanctuary of Heavenly Aphrodite on Athmoneis, an Athenian deme.

* Colaenus - Hellanicus, the Mitylenian historian, tells that this surname of Artemis is derived from Colænus, King of Athens before Cecrops and a descendant of Hermes. In obedience to an oracle he erected a temple to the goddess, invoking her as Artemis Colænis (the Artemis of Colænus).

==Erechtheid dynasty==
The early Athenian tradition, followed by the 3rd century BC Parian Chronicle, made Cecrops, a mythical half-man half-serpent, the first king of Athens. The dates for the following kings were conjectured centuries later, by historians of the Hellenistic era who tried to backdate events by cross-referencing earlier sources such as the Parian Chronicle. Tradition says that King Menestheus took part in the Trojan War.

The following list follows that of 1st Century BC Castor of Rhodes (&quot;FGrHist&quot; 250), with Castor&#x27;s dates given in modern terms.

==Melanthid dynasty==
Melanthus was the Neleides king of Pylos in Messenia. Being driven out by the Dorian and Heraclidae invasion, he came to Athens where Thymoetes resigned the crown to him. Codrus, the last king, repelled the Dorian invasion of Attica.
After Codrus&#x27;s death, his sons Medon and Acastus either reigned as kings, or became hereditary archons. In 753 BC the hereditary archonship was replaced by a non-hereditary system (see Archons of Athens).

<doc id="415289" wikidata="Q509297" url="?curid=415289" title="College Hockey America">
<text>College Hockey America (CHA) was a college ice hockey conference in the United States. It participated in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I as a hockey-only conference. The conference&#x27;s final membership featured six women&#x27;s teams, with three in Pennsylvania; two in New York, and one in Missouri.

On April 30, 2024, CHA merged with the Atlantic Hockey Association to form Atlantic Hockey America in 2024–25.

== History ==
The CHA was founded as a men&#x27;s-only league in the 1999–2000 season. The conference was formed by seven teams, three of which were Division I independent teams, another three moving up from Division II, after the NCAA stopped sanctioning Division II hockey in 1998, and one new varsity program (Wayne State).

The newly formed women&#x27;s division of the CHA began play in the 2002–03 season with four teams. Findlay, Mercyhurst and Wayne State were former Great Lakes Women&#x27;s Hockey Association members, while Niagara played previously in the ECAC.

The CHA Women&#x27;s Division managed to remain at four teams between 2002 and 2008; although teams continued to come and go. In 2004, Findlay dropped its women&#x27;s hockey program and was replaced by Quinnipiac University for one season. In 2005, the Bobcats removed its women&#x27;s team and moved to another conference (ECAC). They were replaced by the Colonials women&#x27;s ice hockey team of Robert Morris University. In 2008–09, Syracuse University started up its women&#x27;s hockey program and joined the conference; bringing the total number of teams in the CHA Women&#x27;s Division up to five.

The CHA Men&#x27;s Division folded after the 2009–2010 season, leaving the CHA as a women&#x27;s-only conference. The fate of the four remaining CHA men&#x27;s teams was as follows: Niagara and Robert Morris moved to Atlantic Hockey; Bemidji State joined the WCHA; and Alabama-Huntsville continued play as an independent before moving to the WCHA prior to the program being discontinued after the WCHA men&#x27;s conference folded.

The 2011–12 academic year and season brought many changes to the CHA. Wayne State abruptly ended their women&#x27;s hockey program, dropping conference membership to only four teams again for the 2011–12 season. The conference announced that Lindenwood University would officially join the CHA for the 2012–2013 season. Lindenwood, then in the process of transitioning its athletic programs from the NAIA to the NCAA, had already been slated to play ten games against CHA opponents in its first season of NCAA competition as an independent program for the 2011–12 season. On March 19, 2012, Niagara announced it was dropping its women&#x27;s ice hockey program effective immediately; as a result, the Rochester Institute of Technology team was allowed to immediately join the CHA upon its move from D-III to D-I for the 2012–13 season. Penn State, which had announced it would upgrade its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey from club to NCAA Division I status for 2012, was accepted for admission to the CHA for the 2012–13 season. In sum, the CHA continued as a women&#x27;s-only conference for the 2012–13 season and beyond with a total of six teams consisting of Mercyhurst (original member from 2002); Robert Morris (joined 2005); Syracuse (joined 2008) and new members Penn State, Lindenwood and RIT.

Due to financial impacts related to COVID-19, Robert Morris announced in May 2021 that it would drop its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey teams effective immediately. A subsequent fundraising drive with the goal of reinstating hockey was successful enough that RMU announced that December that it would reinstate both teams effective in 2023–24. RMU applied for readmission to CHA (as well as its previous men&#x27;s hockey home of Atlantic Hockey), and was officially reinstated to CHA on March 3, 2022.

On June 6, 2023, it was announced that the CHA would be merging with the Atlantic Hockey Association (AHA), with the two conferences operating under one banner by 2024. Although the two conferences had their own governing boards and bylaws, they had a combined conference staff and a single commissioner from 2010 until their merger. The merged league was unveiled as Atlantic Hockey America on April 30, 2024.

==Final members==

===Membership timeline===
==Conference arenas==

== CHA Tournament (Women&#x27;s) history ==

Prior to 2013, the CHA tournament was hosted at a predetermined site. From 2013–2015, the two first-round series were each played at the home of the higher seed, with the semifinals and final held at the home of the number one seed. In 2016, the two first round series remained as before, but the semifinals and finals were held at the LECOM Harborcenter in downtown Buffalo, New York. Starting in 2017, the two first-round series were replaced by a pair of single games, allowing all five games of the six-team tournament to be played at the LECOM Harborcenter.
==NCAA postseason women&#x27;s hockey history==
Prior to the 2014–15 season, The CHA did not have an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament for its conference tournament champion. At that time, with membership having remained stable at six teams (Mercyhurst, Robert Morris, Syracuse, Lindenwood, RIT, and Penn State) for two consecutive seasons, the autobid was granted.

In the table below, all NCAA appearances prior to 2015 were at-large selections.

==Men&#x27;s Division history==
The CHA was founded in 1999 with only a men&#x27;s division. Three of the seven charter members, Alabama–Huntsville, Bemidji State, and Findlay, had recently moved up from Division II, while Air Force, Army, and Niagara were formerly independent. Wayne State was a charter member, and began sponsoring varsity hockey in 2000.

Niagara went undefeated in conference play in 1999–2000, winning the conference tournament and gaining an at-large invitation to the NCAA tournament. (The conference did not gain an automatic bid until the 2003 tournament.) Army spent only one season in the league before leaving for the MAAC. Findlay dropped its hockey programs following the 2003–2004 season, to be replaced by Robert Morris, which began play in 2004–2005. After Air Force left for Atlantic Hockey in 2006 and Wayne State dropped its program in 2008, the conference was left with only four teams. The CHA sought to add new programs to its men&#x27;s league, hoping to draw interest from some of the top club teams in the country, including Kennesaw State University. However, these efforts came up short, with CHA and school personnel citing Title IX as a major hurdle in the negotiations.

On January 29, 2009, Niagara University announced that it and Robert Morris University were moving to Atlantic Hockey beginning in the 2010–11 season. Bemidji State applied again to the Western Collegiate Hockey Association for inclusion and was accepted, along with the University of Nebraska-Omaha of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. Alabama-Huntsville applied to the CCHA following the announced departure of Nebraska-Omaha and was denied. As a result, Alabama-Huntsville began competing as an independent team beginning with the 2010–11 season. The CHA men&#x27;s division dissolved in 2010.

===Member schools===
There were eight member schools in total during the eleven men&#x27;s seasons. The conference began in the 1999–2000 season with seven teams, and ended in 2009–2010 with four.



===CHA Tournament (Men&#x27;s Division)===

Tournament champions were awarded the Bob Peters Cup.
Note: For the first time in conference history, the 2006 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments were held at the same site: The Michigan State Fairgrounds Coliseum in Detroit, Michigan. The 2008 tournaments were also held jointly, at Dwyer Arena in Lewiston, New York.

====NCAA postseason (Men&#x27;s) hockey history====
At-large invitee. College Hockey America was not awarded an automatic bid until 2003.

===Awards===
At the conclusion of each regular season schedule the coaches of each CHA team voted which players they choose to be on the three All-Conference teams: first team, second team and rookie team. Additionally they voted to award 4 individual trophies to an eligible player at the same time. The CHA also awarded an &#x27;Easton Three-Star Player of the Year&#x27;, given to the player with the highest point total with respect to their being named a star of a game, and a Most Valuable Player in Tournament which was voted on at the conclusion of the conference tournament. All awards, with the exception of the Three-Star Player of the Year, were awarded every year of the conference&#x27;s existence.

<doc id="415293" wikidata="Q966052" url="?curid=415293" title="Cryptorchidism">
<text>Cryptorchidism, also known as undescended testis, is the failure of one or both testes to descend into the scrotum. The word is . It is the most common birth defect of the male genital tract. About 3% of full-term and 30% of premature infant boys are born with at least one undescended testis.
However, about 80% of cryptorchid testes descend by the first year of life (the majority within three months), making the true incidence of cryptorchidism around 1% overall. Cryptorchidism may develop after infancy, sometimes as late as young adulthood, but that is exceptional.

Cryptorchidism is distinct from monorchism, the condition of having only one testicle. Though the condition may occur on one or both sides, it more commonly affects the right testis.

A testis absent from the normal scrotal position may be:
# Anywhere along the &quot;path of descent&quot; from high in the posterior (retroperitoneal) abdomen, just below the kidney, to the inguinal ring
# In the inguinal canal
# Ectopic, having &quot;wandered&quot; from the path of descent, usually outside the inguinal canal and sometimes even under the skin of the thigh, the perineum, the opposite scrotum, or the femoral canal
# Undeveloped (hypoplastic) or severely abnormal (dysgenetic)
# Missing (also see anorchia).

About two-thirds of cases without other abnormalities are unilateral; most of the other third involve both testes. In 90% of cases, an undescended testis can be felt in the inguinal canal. In a small minority of cases, missing testes may be found in the abdomen or appear to be nonexistent (truly &quot;hidden&quot;).

Undescended testes are associated with reduced fertility, increased risk of testicular germ-cell tumors, and psychological problems when fully-grown. Undescended testes are also more susceptible to testicular torsion (and subsequent infarction) and inguinal hernias. Without intervention, an undescended testicle will usually descend during the first year of life, but to reduce these risks, undescended testes can be brought into the scrotum in infancy by a surgical procedure called an orchiopexy.

Although cryptorchidism nearly always refers to congenital absence or maldescent, a testis observed in the scrotum in early infancy can occasionally &quot;reascend&quot; (move back up) into the inguinal canal. A testis that can readily move or be moved between the scrotum and canal is referred to as retractile.

Cryptorchidism, hypospadias, testicular cancer, and poor semen quality make up the syndrome known as testicular dysgenesis syndrome.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Infertility===
Many men who were born with undescended testes have reduced fertility, even after orchiopexy in infancy. The reduction with unilateral cryptorchidism is subtle, with a reported infertility rate of about 10%, compared with about 6% reported by the same study for the general population of adult men.

The fertility reduction after orchiopexy for bilateral cryptorchidism is more marked, about 38%, or six times that of the general population. The basis for the universal recommendation for early surgery is research showing degeneration of spermatogenic tissue and reduced spermatogonia counts after the second year of life in undescended testes. The degree to which this is prevented or improved by early orchiopexy is still uncertain.

===Cancer risk===

One of the strongest arguments for early orchiopexy is reducing the risk of testicular cancer. About one in 500 men born with one or both testes undescended develops testicular cancer, roughly a four- to 40-fold increased risk. The peak incidence occurs in the third and fourth decades of life. The risk is higher for intra-abdominal testes and somewhat lower for inguinal testes, but even the normally descended testis of a man whose other testis was undescended has about a 20% higher cancer risk than those of other men.

The most common type of testicular cancer occurring in undescended testes is seminoma. It is usually treatable if caught early, so urologists often recommend that boys who had orchiopexy as infants be taught testicular self-examination, to recognize testicular masses and seek early medical care for them. Cancer developing in an intra-abdominal testis would be unlikely to be recognized before considerable growth and spread, and one of the advantages of orchiopexy is that a mass developing in a scrotal testis is far easier to recognize than an intra-abdominal mass.

Orchidopexy was originally thought to result in easier detection of testicular cancer, but did not lower the risk of actually developing cancer. However, recent data have shown a paradigm shift. &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; published in 2007 that orchidopexy performed before puberty resulted in a significantly reduced risk of testicular cancer than if done after puberty.

The risk of malignancy in the undescended testis is 4 to 10 ten times higher than that in the general population and is about one in 80 with a unilateral undescended testis and one in 40 to one in 50 for bilateral undescended testes. The peak age for this tumor is 15–45 years old. The most common tumor developing in an undescended testis is a seminoma (65%); in contrast, after orchiopexy, seminomas represent only 30% of testicular tumors.

==Causes==

=== Environmental hypotheses ===
In most full-term infant boys with cryptorchidism but no other genital abnormalities, a cause cannot be found, making this a common, sporadic, unexplained (idiopathic) birth defect. A combination of genetics, maternal health, and other environmental factors may disrupt the hormones and physical changes that influence the development of the testicles.
* Severely premature infants can be born before descent of testes. Low birth weight is also a known factor.
* A contributing role of environmental chemicals called endocrine disruptors that interfere with normal fetal hormone balance has been proposed. The Mayo Clinic lists &quot;parents&#x27; exposure to some pesticides&quot; as a known risk factor.
* Risk factors may include exposure to regular alcohol consumption during pregnancy (five or more drinks per week, associated with a three-fold increase in cryptorchidism when compared to nondrinking mothers. Cigarette smoking is also a known risk factor.
* Family history of undescended testicles or other problems of genital development
* Cryptorchidism occurs at a much higher rate in a large number of congenital malformation syndromes. Among the more common are Down syndrome, Prader–Willi syndrome, and Noonan syndrome.
* &quot;In vitro&quot; fertilization, use of cosmetics by the mother, and pre-eclampsia have also been recognized as risk factors for development of cryptorchidism.
* &quot;Androgen insensitivity syndrome&quot; generally manifests itself in Cryptorchidism. In CAIS, the testis are generally located completely undescended where the ovaries usually are, in PAIS, the testis are generally partially undescended. This also occurs with 5α-Reductase 2 deficiency (DHT insensitivity) however, the testis generally descend during puberty.

In 2008, a study was published that investigated the possible relationship between cryptorchidism and prenatal exposure to a chemical called phthalate (DEHP), which is used in the manufacture of plastics. The researchers found a significant association between higher levels of DEHP metabolites in pregnant mothers and several sex-related changes, including incomplete descent of the testes in their sons. According to the lead author of the study, a national survey found that 25% of U.S. women had phthalate levels similar to the levels that were found to be associated with sexual abnormalities.

A 2010 study examined the prevalence of congenital cryptorchidism among offspring whose mothers had taken mild analgesics, primarily over-the-counter pain medications including ibuprofen (e.g. Advil) and paracetamol (acetaminophen). Combining the results from a survey of pregnant women prior to their due date in correlation with the health of their children and an &quot;ex vivo&quot; rat model, the study found that pregnant women who had been exposed to mild analgesics had a higher prevalence of baby boys born with congenital cryptorchidism.

New insight into the testicular descent mechanism has been hypothesized by the concept of a male programming window derived from animal studies. According to this concept, testicular descent status is &quot;set&quot; during the period from 8 to 14 weeks of gestation in humans. Undescended testis is a result of disruption in androgen levels only during this programming window.

=== Sexually antagonistic epigenetic marker hypothesis ===
When one identical twin is born with cryptorchidism, his identical twin also has the trait only 25% of the time, despite sharing their genes and prenatal hormonal environment. Animal studies have found that androgen antagonists during early fetal development cause elevated rates of hypospadias and cryptorchidism, however, in humans these traits rarely occur together. In addition, levels of circulating testosterone overlap for both male and female fetuses throughout fetal development. Rice et al. have proposed that sexually dimorphic development occurs through epigenetic markers which are laid down during stem cell development, which blunt androgen signalling in XX fetuses, and boost sensitivity in XY fetuses. If these marks are sexually antagonistic, and if a subset of these epigenetic marks carry over generations, they are expected to produce mosaicism of sexual development in opposite-sex offspring, sometimes producing hypospadias or cryptorchidism when passed from a mother to son (feminizing the external genitalia). Rice&#x27;s model requires further testing with currently available technology to support or falsify it.

==Mechanism==

===Normal development===
The testes begin as an immigration of primordial germ cells into testicular cords along the gonadal ridge in the abdomen of the early embryo. The interaction of several male genes organizes this developing gonad into a testis rather than an ovary by the second month of gestation. During the third to fifth months, the cells in the testes differentiate into testosterone-producing Leydig cells, and anti-Müllerian hormone-producing Sertoli cells. The germ cells in this environment become fetal spermatogonia. Male external genitalia develops during the third and fourth months of gestation and the fetus continues to grow, develop, and differentiate.
The testes remain high in the abdomen until the seventh month of gestation when they move from the abdomen through the inguinal canals into the two sides of the scrotum. Movement has been proposed to occur in two phases, under the control of somewhat different factors. The first phase, movement across the abdomen to the entrance of the inguinal canal, appears controlled (or at least greatly influenced) by anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). The second phase, in which the testes move through the inguinal canal into the scrotum, is dependent on androgens (most importantly testosterone). In rodents, androgens induce the genitofemoral nerve to release calcitonin gene-related peptide, which produces rhythmic contractions of the gubernaculum, a ligament which connects the testis to the scrotum, but a similar mechanism has not been demonstrated in humans. Maldevelopment of the gubernaculum or deficiency or insensitivity to either AMH or androgen can, therefore, prevent the testes from descending into the scrotum. Some evidence suggests an additional paracrine hormone, referred to as descendin, may be secreted by the testes.

In many infants with inguinal testes, further descent of the testes into the scrotum occurs in the first six months of life. This is attributed to the postnatal surge of gonadotropins and testosterone that normally occurs between the first and fourth months of life.

Spermatogenesis continues after birth. In the third to fifth months of life, some of the fetal spermatogonia residing along the basement membrane become type A spermatogonia. More gradually, other fetal spermatogonia become type B spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes by the fifth year after birth. Spermatogenesis arrests at this stage until puberty.

Most normal-appearing undescended testes are also normal by microscopic examination, but reduced spermatogonia can be found. The tissue in undescended testes becomes more markedly abnormal (&quot;degenerates&quot;) in microscopic appearance between two and four years after birth. Some evidence indicates early orchiopexy reduces this degeneration.

===Pathophysiology===
At least one contributing mechanism for reduced spermatogenesis in cryptorchid testes is temperature. The temperature of testes in the scrotum is at least a few degrees cooler than in the abdomen. Animal experiments in the middle of the 20th century suggested that raising the temperature could damage fertility. Some circumstantial evidence suggests tight underwear and other practices that raise the testicular temperature for prolonged periods can be associated with lower sperm counts. Nevertheless, research in recent decades suggests that the issue of fertility is more complex than a simple matter of temperature. Subtle or transient hormone deficiencies or other factors that lead to a lack of descent also may impair the development of spermatogenic tissue.

The inhibition of spermatogenesis by ordinary intra-abdominal temperature is so potent that continual suspension of normal testes tightly against the inguinal ring at the top of the scrotum by means of special &quot;suspensory briefs&quot; has been researched as a method of male contraception, and was referred to as &quot;artificial cryptorchidism&quot; by one report.

An additional factor contributing to infertility is the high rate of anomalies of the epididymis in boys with cryptorchidism (over 90% in some studies). Even after orchiopexy, these may also affect sperm maturation and motility at an older age.

==Diagnosis==

The most common diagnostic dilemma in otherwise normal boys is distinguishing a retractile testis from a testis that will not descend spontaneously into the scrotum. Retractile testes are more common than truly undescended testes and do not need to be operated on. In normal males, as the cremaster muscle relaxes or contracts, the testis moves lower or higher (&quot;retracts&quot;) in the scrotum. This cremasteric reflex is much more active in infant boys than older men. A retractile testis high in the scrotum can be difficult to distinguish from a position in the lower inguinal canal. Though various maneuvers are used to do so, such as using a cross-legged position, soaping the examiner&#x27;s fingers, or examining in a warm bath, the benefit of surgery in these cases can be a matter of clinical judgment.

In the minority of cases with bilaterally nonpalpable testes, further testing to locate the testes, assess their function, and exclude additional problems is often useful. Scrotal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging performed and interpreted by a radiologist can often locate the testes while confirming absence of a uterus. At ultrasound, the undescended testis usually appears small, less echogenic than the contralateral normal testis and usually located in the inguinal region. With color Doppler ultrasonography, the vascularity of the undescended testis is poor.

A karyotype can confirm or exclude forms of dysgenetic primary hypogonadism, such as Klinefelter syndrome or mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Hormone levels (especially gonadotropins and AMH) can help confirm that hormonally functional testes are worth attempting to rescue, as can stimulation with a few injections of human chorionic gonadotropin to elicit a rise of the testosterone level. Occasionally, these tests reveal an unsuspected and more complicated intersex condition.

In the even smaller minority of cryptorchid infants who have other obvious birth defects of the genitalia, further testing is crucial and has a high likelihood of detecting an intersex condition or other anatomic anomalies. Ambiguity can indicate either impaired androgen synthesis or reduced sensitivity. The presence of a uterus by pelvic ultrasound suggests either persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (AMH deficiency or insensitivity) or a severely virilized genetic female with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. An unambiguous micropenis, especially accompanied by hypoglycemia or jaundice, suggests congenital hypopituitarism.

==Treatment==
The primary management of cryptorchidism is watchful waiting, due to the high likelihood of self-resolution. Where this fails, orchiopexy is effective if inguinal testes have not descended after 4–6 months. Surgery is often performed by a pediatric urologist or pediatric surgeon, but in many communities still by a general urologist or surgeon.

When the undescended testis is in the inguinal canal, hormonal therapy is sometimes attempted and very occasionally successful. The most commonly used hormone therapy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). A series of hCG injections (10 injections over five weeks is common) is given and the status of the testis/testes is reassessed at the end. Although many trials have been published, the reported success rates range widely, from roughly 5% to 50%, probably reflecting the varying criteria for distinguishing retractile testes from low inguinal testes. Hormone treatment does have the occasional incidental benefits of allowing confirmation of Leydig cell responsiveness (proven by a rise of the testosterone by the end of the injections) or inducing additional growth of a small penis (via the testosterone rise). Some surgeons have reported facilitation of surgery, perhaps by enhancing the size, vascularity, or healing of the tissue. A newer hormonal intervention used in Europe is the use of GnRH analogs such as nafarelin or buserelin; the success rates and putative mechanism of action are similar to hCG, but some surgeons have combined the two treatments and reported higher descent rates. Limited evidence suggests that germ cell count is slightly better after hormone treatment; whether this translates into better sperm counts and fertility rates at maturity has not been established. The cost of either type of hormone treatment is less than that of surgery and the chance of complications at appropriate doses is minimal. Nevertheless, despite the potential advantages of a trial of hormonal therapy, many surgeons do not consider the success rates high enough to be worth the trouble, since the surgery itself is usually simple and uncomplicated.

In cases where the testes are identified preoperatively in the inguinal canal, orchiopexy is often performed as an outpatient and has a very low complication rate. An incision is made over the inguinal canal. The testis with accompanying cord structure and blood supply is exposed, partially separated from the surrounding tissues (&quot;mobilized&quot;), and brought into the scrotum. It is sutured to the scrotal tissue or enclosed in a &quot;subdartos pouch&quot;. The associated passage back into the inguinal canal is closed to prevent reascent. In patients with intra-abdominal maldescended testis, laparoscopy is useful to see for oneself the pelvic structures, position of the testis and decide upon surgery (single or staged procedure).

Surgery becomes more complicated if the blood supply is not ample and elastic enough to be stretched into the scrotum. In these cases, the supply may be divided, some vessels sacrificed with expectation of adequate collateral circulation. In the worst case, the testis must be &quot;autotransplanted&quot; into the scrotum, with all connecting blood vessels cut and reconnected (anastomosed).

When the testis is in the abdomen, the first stage of surgery is exploration to locate it, assess its viability, and determine the safest way to maintain or establish the blood supply. Multistage surgeries, or autotransplantation and anastomosis, are more often necessary in these situations. Just as often, intra-abdominal exploration discovers that the testis is nonexistent (&quot;vanished&quot;), or dysplastic and not salvageable.

The principal major complication of all types of orchiopexy is a loss of the blood supply to the testis, resulting in loss of the testis due to ischemic atrophy or fibrosis.

==Other animals==

Cryptorchidism is seen in all domestic animals, most commonly in stallions, boars, and canines. The prevalence of this condition can vary depending on species and breed. Evidence of this condition is more likely in companion animals and swine than ruminants. The cause of this condition can vary from a combination of genetics, environment, and epigenetics.

===Dogs===

Cryptorchidism is common in male dogs, occurring at a rate up to 10%. This condition is one of the most common congenital defects in purebred dogs (11%), with 14% reported in Siberian Huskies. Although the genetics are not fully understood, it is thought to be a recessive, and probably polygenetic, trait. Some have speculated that it is a sex-limited autosomal recessive trait; however, it is unlikely to be simple recessive. Dog testes usually descend by 10 days of age and it is considered to be cryptorchidism if they do not descend by the age of eight weeks. Cryptorchidism can be either bilateral (causing sterility) or unilateral, and inguinal or abdominal (or both). Because it is an inherited trait, affected dogs should not be bred and should be castrated. The parents should be considered carriers of the defect and a breeder should thoughtfully consider whether to breed the carrier parent or not. Littermates may be normal, carriers, or cryptorchid. Castration of the undescended teste(s) should be considered for cryptorchid dogs due to the high rate of testicular cancer, especially Sertoli cell tumors. The incidence of testicular cancer is 13.6 times higher in dogs with abdominally retained testicles compared with normal dogs. Testicular torsion is also more likely in retained testicles. Surgical correction is by palpation of the retained testicle and subsequent exploration of the inguinal canal or abdomen, but showing altered dogs is against AKC rules, making this correction pointless for breeding stock. Orchiopexy is an option for pet dogs that will not be used for breeding.

Commonly affected breeds include:

* Alaskan Klee Kai
* Boxer
* Chihuahua
* Dachshund (miniature)
* Bulldog
* Maltese
* Miniature Schnauzer
* Pekingese
* Pomeranian
* Poodle (toy and miniature)
* Pug
* Shetland Sheepdog
* Siberian Husky
* Whippet
* Yorkshire Terrier

===Cats===
Cryptorchidism is rarer in cats than it is in dogs. In one study, 1.9% of intact male cats were cryptorchid. Persians are predisposed. Normally, the testicles are in the scrotum by the age of six to eight weeks. Male cats with one cryptorchid testicle may still be fertile; however, male cats with two cryptorchid testicles are most likely to be sterile. Urine spraying is one indication that a cat with no observable testicles may not be neutered; other signs are the presence of enlarged jowls, thickened facial and neck skin, and spines on the penis (which usually regress within six weeks after castration). Most cryptorchid cats present with an inguinal testicle.
Testicular tumors and testicular torsion are rare in cryptorchid cats, but castration is usually performed due to unwanted behavior such as urine spraying.

===Horses===
In horses, cryptorchidism is sufficiently common that affected males (ridglings) are routinely gelded.

Rarely, cryptorchidism is due to the presence of a congenital testicular tumor such as a teratoma, which has a tendency to grow large.

<text>In Greek mythology, Menestheus (; Ancient Greek: Μενεσθεύς) was a legendary king of Athens during the Trojan War. He was set up as king by the twins Castor and Pollux when Theseus travelled to the Underworld after abducting their sister, Helen, and exiled Theseus from the city after his return.

== Family ==
Menestheus was the son of Peteus, son of Orneus, son of Erechtheus, one of the early kings of Athens. His mother was called Polyxene or Mnesimache.

== Mythology ==
Menestheus was one of the suitors of Helen of Troy, and when the Trojan War started he brought &quot;fifty black ships&quot; to Troy. In the &quot;Iliad,&quot; it is noted that no one could arrange chariots and shield-bearing warriors in battle orders better than Menestheus, and that only Nestor could vie with him in that respect. In Herodotus, he is referred to as &#x27;the best man to go to Troy and to draw up and marshal the troops&#x27; by the Athenian sent to request aid from Gelon, the dictator of Syracuse.

Yet, further, he is characterised as not valiant. When Agamemnon was reviewing his troops he found Menestheus in the back rows seemingly avoiding action. Later, when Sarpedon attacked the portion of the Greek wall that he was in charge of, Menestheus shivered and had to call on Telamonian Ajax and Teucer for aid. Menestheus was one of the warriors in the Trojan Horse. After Troy was sacked, he sailed to Mimas, then to Melos where he became king.

When Menestheus died, Athens passed back to the family of Theseus, with Theseus&#x27; youngest son Demophon ascending to the throne.

<doc id="415305" wikidata="Q3287159" url="?curid=415305" title="Manzanita">
<text>Manzanita is a common name for many species of the genus &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot;. They are evergreen shrubs or small trees present in the chaparral biome of western North America, where they occur from Southern British Columbia and Washington to Oregon, California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas in the United States, and throughout Mexico. Manzanitas can live in places with poor soil and little water. They are characterized by smooth orange or red bark and stiff, twisting branches. There are 107 species and subspecies of manzanita, 95 of which are found in the Mediterranean climate and colder mountainous regions of California, ranging from ground-hugging coastal and mountain species to small trees up to 20 feet (6m) tall. Manzanitas bloom from winter to early spring and carry berries in spring and summer. The berries and flowers of most species are edible.

The word &quot;manzanita&quot; is the Spanish diminutive of &quot;manzana&quot; meaning &quot;little apple&quot;. The name manzanita is also sometimes used to refer to species in the related genus &quot;Arbutus&quot;, which is known by that name in the Canadian area of the tree&#x27;s range, but is more usually known as &quot;madroño&quot;, or madrone in the United States.

==Uses==
===Folk medicine===

Native Americans in Northern California make a tisane from manzanita leaves to treat poison oak rash. The leaves contain chemicals with a mildly disinfectant quality and can be used for mild urinary tract infections.

The tree&#x27;s berries can be turned into a cider by mashing, pouring an equal amount of water over the paste, and then straining it. In Native American cultures, this cider is then used to treat stomach ailments and promote appetite. The berries have also been used to treat bronchitis and kidney problems.

The leaves of the manzanita also have many medicinal purposes. Chewing the leaves of the manzanita tree into a poultice can treat open sores and ease headaches after application. Chewing on the leaves, without ingestion, can cure stomach issues such as cramps and aches. Infusions of the leaves can also treat ailments such as diarrhea and severe colds.

===Culinary use===

The berries are edible, and can be harvested en masse and stored. Once stored and dried, the berries can be ground into a coarse meal. The berries can be eaten ripe (when red) or green for a slightly sour taste. They are good eaten alone or used as a thickener or sweetener in other dishes. Native Americans use the fresh berries to make cider and use the leaves as toothbrushes.

===Landscape use===
Manzanitas are useful as ornamental plants in gardens in the western United States and similar climate zones. They are evergreen, highly drought-tolerant, have picturesque bark and attractive flowers and berries, and occur in many sizes and growth patterns.

&quot;Arctostaphylos columbiana&quot;, for example, is hardy enough for highway landscaping in western Oregon and Washington. &quot;A.&quot; &#x27;Emerald Carpet&#x27;, &quot;A. uva-ursi&quot; (the bearberry), and other low-growing manzanitas are valuable evergreen groundcovers for dry slopes. Larger varieties, such as &quot;A.&quot; &#x27;Dr. Hurd&#x27;, can be grown as individual specimens and pruned to emphasize the striking pattern and colors of the branches. They prefer light, well-drained soil, although the low-growing ground covers will tolerate heavier soils.

===Decorative use===
Manzanita branches are popular as decoration due to their unique shape, color, and strength when dried. Florists sometimes use them as centerpieces at wedding receptions and other events, often adding hanging votive candles, beaded gems, and small flowers.
The wood is notoriously hard to cure, mostly due to cracking against the grain, giving it few uses as lumber. The slow growth rate and many branchings further decrease the sizes available. Some furniture and art employ whole round branches, which reduces cracking and preserves the deep red color.

The dead wood decays slowly and can last for many years, on and off the plant. Sunlight smooths and bleaches manzanita to light grey or white, rendering it superficially akin to animal bones. Because of this and the stunted growth of many species, manzanita is often collected in its more unusual shapes, giving it the nickname &quot;mountain driftwood&quot;.

Manzanita wood is also used as perches for parrots and other large pet birds. The branches of the larger species are extremely long-lasting for this purpose.

Some aquarium keepers use sandblasted manzanita as driftwood in planted aquaria because of its attractive forked growth and its chemical neutrality. It holds up well over extended periods of submersion if properly cleaned and cured. The wood is also resistant to the leaching of tannins into the water column, a problem often found with other aquarium driftwoods. When used as driftwood, manzanita must usually be weighted down for several weeks or soaked first to counteract the wood&#x27;s natural buoyancy when dried and cured. The green wood does not float.

Manzanita wood, when dry, is excellent for burning in a campfire, barbecue, fireplace, or stove. It is dense and burns at a high temperature for long periods. However, caution should be exercised because the high temperatures can damage thin-walled barbecues and even crack cast iron stoves or cause chimney fires.

===Other uses===
During World War II, manzanita root burls were used as a suitable native material to make smoking pipes due to its relation and similar fire-resistant properties to then-unavailable imported briar. It was labeled as &quot;mission briar&quot; and harvested for the remainder of the war, stopping soon after when supplies of imported briar once again became available.

==Rarity and endemics==
Some manzanita species are among the rarest plants in the world.

&quot;Arctostaphylos montana ravenii&quot; (Presidio manzanita), an endemic species, is the most endangered and restricted plant in the mainland United States. In 1987 only one specimen remained at a secret location in the Presidio of San Francisco National Historic Landmark District in San Francisco, California. This plant has since been successfully cloned.

&quot;Arctostaphylos franciscana&quot; (Franciscan manzanita), a species native to San Francisco, had not been seen growing wild since 1947 until it was spotted growing in the Presidio of San Francisco in October 2009. Caltrans transplanted this specimen on 23 January 2010 to make way for the Doyle Drive Replacement Project. Transplanting costs were funded in part by Federal Highways Administration, Caltrans, The Presidio of San Francisco, and private donors. &quot;Arctostaphylos hookeri&quot;, subspecies &quot;franciscana&quot;, a scrubby, thin-twigged bush, riddled with the webs of miniature spiders, resides in a corner of the California section of The Strybing Arboretum.

An as yet unclassified and unidentified manzanita found growing on San Francisco&#x27;s Parker Avenue presents a test case for San Francisco&#x27;s landmark tree ordinance.

&quot;Arctostaphylos gabrielensis &quot;is a &quot;critically imperiled&quot; species of manzanita endemic to a tiny area in the San Gabriel Mountains, in Los Angeles County, California.

==Genus evolution==
Genus evolution is relatively recent, but in C. Michael Hogan&#x27;s tracing of the evolutionary history of the genus, he states: &quot;convergent evolution patterns appear to complicate cladistic constructions for certain portions of the genus cladogram. In any case, fossil ancestors of the genus &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot; have been suggested to have occurred in the Middle Miocene, with modern species beginning to take shape in the Late Tertiary.&quot;

== Ecology ==
The manzanita leaf gall aphid and the manzanita butter clump fungus are two known ecological associates of this type of tree. The flowers attract native bee species including &quot;Osmia&quot; and the black-tailed bumblebee. The fungus &quot;Exobasidium arctostaphyli&quot; induces witch&#x27;s broom galls on manzanita.

<text>Hits + is a compilation album by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue, which was released on 7 November 2000 by Deconstruction Records. The album was the last compilation album which was released by the record label at the time, because Minogue had released her then Parlophone album &quot;Light Years&quot; (2000). The album peaked at number sixty-three in Australia on the ARIA albums chart.

==Background==
It was announced that Minogue would release a compilation with her songs from Deconstruction Records. The album was entitled &quot;Hits +&quot;. The photograph used for the original cover art was later scrapped in favour of another shot, from a 1995 session by Michael Williams.

&quot;If You Don&#x27;t Love Me&quot; was originally recorded by British group Prefab Sprout for their 1992 album &quot;A Life of Surprises&quot;.

==Composition==
The compilation is made up of songs from the albums &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; (1994) and &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; (1997). The album includes all seven singles released during the time Minogue was under Deconstruction Records but does not include the Australian only single &quot;Cowboy Style&quot;. The international release of &quot;Hits +&quot; contains only 15 tracks, lacking &quot;This Girl&quot; and just 14 tracks in the U.S. and China, where &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot; was also omitted.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;Hits +&quot; received positive reception from music critics, many praising it for its Deconstruction songs in a major compilation. Mackenzie Wilson from AllMusic gave it a very positive review, awarding the album four-and-a-half out of five stars. She had explained the album saying &quot;Capitalizing on her surging popularity in the States, Arista found themselves promoting Kylie Minogue in early 2002 with the reissue of her &quot;Hits +&quot; album. This particular record highlights the cuts that made Minogue an indie darling in Europe in the mid-&#x27;90s, reflecting back on her 1994 self-titled effort and 1997&#x27;s &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;. American fans might be put off just a bit, for this material is less frilly and far darker than &quot;Fever&quot;″s smash single, &#x27;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&#x27;. But it&#x27;s still stylish. &quot;Hits +&quot; is perfect for any fan, but it&#x27;s also a great retrospective for those eager fans who are beginning to discover the wild musical world of Kylie Minogue.&quot;

===Chart performance===
The album debuted and peaked at number forty-one on the UK Albums Chart.

<text>Fredriksten is a fortress in the city of Halden in Norway. 
==History==

This Fortresses was constructed by Denmark-Norway in the 17th century as a replacement for the border fortress at Bohus, which had been lost when the province of Bohuslän was ceded to Sweden by the terms of the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. The fortress was named after King Fredrik III of Denmark and Norway, and the town of Halden was also originally named after him, having been known as &quot;Fredrikshald&quot; between 1665 and 1928.

=== The Northern War (1655–1661) ===
At the close of the Northern War Charles X, having negotiated the Treaty of Roskilde in bad faith, invested Copenhagen in August 1658. Under his orders, in September the new Swedish governor of Bohuslän invaded Norway with 1,500 men and attempted to invest Halden. The inhabitants put up a vigorous defense and the Swedish forces retreated back to Bohuslän.

Five months later in February 1659 the Swedes again attacked. Since their first attack, the garrison had been strengthened. Under the leadership of Tønne Huitfeldt the Norwegian forces again repulsed the Swedish forces. Concurrently, Huitfeldt began construction of fortifications. Cretzenstein, later to be renamed Fredriksten, was the citadel of the new fortification system.

In early January 1660, the Swedish forces attacked Halden for the third time; it was to serve as the base for their advance on Akershus fortress in Christiania. Huitfeldt responded to their demand that they surrender, that the 2,100 man garrison would defend Halden to the last man. After the attempt to storm the fortifications was unsuccessful, the Swedes prepared a regular siege. Under heavy bombardment the inhabitants requested the commandant to surrender, but putting his faith in his garrison, Huitfeldt held out. On 22 February 1660 the Swedes again were forced to retreat to Bohuslän. There they learned that Charles X had died.

Peace negotiations were reopened. Sweden demanded that Norway vacate all land east of the river Glomma, which was to serve as the new border. With the intercession of Hannibal Sehested, a separate Scandinavian treaty was negotiated, the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660), which improved on the terms of the Treaty of Roskilde, returning Trøndelag to Norwegian control.

=== Fortification Upgrades (1673–1675) ===

The existing star shaped fortress complex was upgraded during the period of peace between 1661–1675. In 1673 Denmark dispatched Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve as statholder to Norway to organize the military forces and strengthen the defenses of the kingdom. After a tour of facilities, he recommended further upgrades to both the fortress and the military forces. In the summer of 1675, 1800 men were kept at work on the fortresses at Akershus, Fredrikstad, and Fredrikshald.

=== Gyldenløve War (1675–1679) ===

At the outbreak of the Gyldenløve War in 1675 a large contingent (4000 men) were concentrated at Fredrikshald under General Russenstein. In 1676 Norwegian troops reoccupied Bohuslän. In July 1677 Gyldenløve captured the fortress at Marstrand and joined General Løvenhjelm, who marched into Bohuslän with the main Norwegian army and defeated an army of 8000 Swedes under General de la Gardie. A Norwegian force also retook Jämtland, but withdrew again as ordered by the King. No major defensive activities were needed at Fredriksten as no Swedish forces crossed the frontier.

=== Fortification Upgrades (1679–1700) ===

Fredriksten was expanded from 1682–1701; 1684-1689 under the leadership of Major-General Ernst von Tettau. It now included three outer fortifications: Gyldenløve, Overberget and Stortårnet.

=== Great Northern War (1700–1721) ===

At the close of the Great Northern War, the Norwegian Army had been weakened in early 1716 by withdrawal of 5000 of the best troops to Denmark. When rumors reached Christiania that Charles XII was preparing to invade, all remaining troops in Østerdal and Gudbrandsdal were ordered to the border at Halden and Fredrikstad. The Norwegians expected the Swedes to invade at Kongsvinger, Basmo and/or Halden. It was at Basmo where Charles XII struck, crossing the border on 8 March 1716. The Norwegian scorched earth policy and guerrilla raid interdiction of supply chains by the residents of Bohuslen deprived Charles of supplies, while the fortresses still held by the Norwegians behind his lines threatened his supply chain and his retreat if seriously weakened in combat. Charles took Christiania (now Oslo), but without heavy siege artillery, was unable to take Akershus.

After a brief occupation, Charles retraced his steps to the Norwegian fortresses in southeastern Norway with the objective of capturing Fredriksten. This would remove the threat at his back, and the fortifications could serve as the base for a renewed offensive later that year. Capturing the harbours at the mouth of the Glomma river would also allow him to land the necessary provisions for a successful siege of Akershus.

Charles&#x27; troops attempted to take Fredriksten by storm on 4 July. His troops took the town after fierce fighting, but the citizens set fire to their own houses, forcing Charles, unable to take the fortress, to retreat and await the arrival of heavy siege guns. Unfortunately for the invading army the entire Swedish transport fleet was captured or destroyed by the Norwegian naval hero Tordenskjold at the Battle of Dynekilen in Bohuslän. Running low on supplies, Charles retreated hastily across the Svinesund and burned the bridges behind him. By 12 July 1716 all Swedish troops had been withdrawn from the area around Fredriksten.

In the Autumn of 1718 Charles once more attacked Norway, intending to first capture Halden to be able to sustain a siege of Akershus. By first taking the border areas, Charles wished to avoid a repeat of the fiasco he had suffered two years before. The 1,400 strong garrison of Fredriksten fought ferociously to hold back the invasion, but suffered a severe setback when, on 8 December the forward fortification Fort Gyldenløve fell. Encouraged by their very hard-fought success the Swedish army intensified their efforts against the main fort. The Swedish trenches had almost reached the main fortification walls when on the evening of 11 December (Swedish calendar: 30 November) 1718, a bullet struck and killed Charles XII while he inspected the work. The death of the king effectively ended the attack on Fredriksten and the invasion was called off, leading to the conclusion of the war. A memorial is located in the park named in his memory where the Swedish king fell, just in front of the fortress.

===1788===
The fortress served as a staging area for a mock attack on Sweden during the Theater War.

===1814===

The fortress was bombarded but not captured. The advancing Swedish forces of Charles John passed it on their advance, leaving a force that tried to force its surrender, but the fortress and its commander kept the ground. It was turned over to Sweden after the Convention of Moss. The old fortress flag from 1814, taken by the Swedish troops and not returned to Norway until 1964, is preserved in the present day museum located inside the inner fortress.

==The fortress today==

After 1905 the fortress lost all military significance, but it still hosted various units. As of today the Norwegian defence logistics and administrative college is situated by the fortress. The fortress also hosts several museums and art exhibitions. During the summer season outdoor concerts are arranged with both classic and contemporary music.

The fortress was selected as the millennium site for Østfold county.

The fortress is where the annual music programme &quot;Allsang på Grensen&quot; was filmed.

The discovery of a suitcase of objects during a clearance of a museum store at the fortress led to the rediscovery of the lifestory of Janken Wiel-Hansen, a Hansen born Norwegian-Swedish and pioneer in fencing and swordsmanship.

<doc id="415319" wikidata="Q15115206" url="?curid=415319" title="Bearberry">
<text>Bearberries are three species of dwarf shrubs in the genus &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot;. Unlike the other species of &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot; (see manzanita), they are adapted to Arctic and subarctic climates, and have a circumpolar distribution in northern North America, Asia and Europe.

==Etymology==
The genus name, &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot;, derives from the Greek &quot;arctos&quot; (&quot;bear&quot;) and &quot;staphylos&quot; (&quot;bunch of grapes&quot;). The species name, &quot;uva-ursi&quot;, is from the Latin &quot;uva&quot;, (&quot;bunch of grapes&quot;) and &quot;ursus&quot; (&quot;bear&quot;), leading to the common name, &quot;bearberry&quot;.

In the culture of First Nations people of Canada, the plant is called &quot;kinnikinnick&quot;, from an Algonquian (possibly a Blackfoot) word for &quot;smoking mixture&quot;.

==Description==
Bearberries grow as low-lying shrubs in soils predominantly composed of sand, gravel, or dunes in the boreal forest. It is less common north of the tree line.

The plant has flexible branches growing up to long covered with red, shredded bark and dark green, oval leaves. Flowers are white or pink, tipped with red, growing in small clusters at the ends of branches, and later maturing into red oval fruits.

==Species== 
The name &quot;bearberry&quot; for the plant derives in part from the edible fruit which is a food for bears. The fruits are gathered as food for humans, and the leaves are used in indigenous herbal medicine.

The alpine bearberry &quot;Arctostaphylos alpina&quot; (L.) Spreng (syn. &quot;Arctous alpinus&quot; (L.) Niedenzu) is a procumbent shrub . Berries are dark purple to black. Its distribution is in northern latitudes from Scotland east across Scandinavia, Russia, Alaska, Canada and Greenland; southern limits extend into Europe in the Pyrenees and the Alps, in Asia to the Altay Mountains, and in North America to British Columbia in the west, and Maine and New Hampshire in the United States in the east.

The red bearberry &quot;Arctostaphylos rubra&quot; (Rehd. &amp; Wilson) Fernald (syn. &quot;Arctous rubra&quot; (Rehder and E.H. Wilson) Nakai; &quot;Arctous alpinus&quot; var. &quot;ruber&quot; Rehd. and Wilson) is a procumbent shrub with deciduous leaves. Berries are red. Its distribution is in the mountains of Sichuan, southwestern China north and east to eastern Siberia, Alaska and northern Canada, east to northern Quebec.

==Uses==
The berries ripen late in summer and can be eaten raw.

The plant contains diverse phytochemicals, including ursolic acid, tannic acid, gallic acid, some essential oils and resin, hydroquinones (mainly arbutin, up to 17%), tannins (up to 15%), phenolic glycosides and flavonoids.

Native American Indians traditionally made use of the plant&#x27;s leaves, which they gathered in summer and dried for use as a tobacco substitute or mixed with tobacco.

===Folk medicine===
The dried leaves can be used in teas, liquid diffusions, tea bags or tablets for traditional medicine. Bearberry appears to be relatively safe, although large doses may cause nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, back pain and tinnitus. Cautions for use apply during pregnancy, breast feeding, or in people with kidney disease.

The efficacy and safety of bearberry treatment in humans remain unproven, as no clinical trials exist to interpret effects on any disease.

==History and folklore==

Bearberry was first documented in &quot;The Physicians of Myddfai&quot;, a 13th-century Welsh herbal. It was also described by Clusius in 1601, and recommended for medicinal use in 1763 by Gerhard and others. It first appeared in the London Pharmacopoeia in 1788.

Native Americans use bearberry leaves with tobacco and other herbs in religious ceremonies, both as a smudge (type of incense) or smoked in a sacred pipe carrying the smoker&#x27;s prayers. Among the ingredients in kinnikinnick were non-poisonous sumac leaves, and the inner bark of certain bushes such as red osier dogwood (silky cornell), chokecherry, and alder, to improve the taste of the bearberry leaf.

<doc id="415320" wikidata="Q1360993" url="?curid=415320" title="Tom Cochrane">
<text>Thomas William Cochrane ( ; born May 14, 1953) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and musician best known as the frontman for the rock band Red Rider and for his work as a solo singer-songwriter. Cochrane has won eight Juno Awards. He is a member of the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, an officer of the Order of Canada, and has an honorary doctorate from Brandon University. In September 2009, he was inducted onto Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

==Life and career==
===Red Rider===
After meeting at the El Mocambo tavern in Toronto, Cochrane joined the Canadian rock band Red Rider in 1978 and served as their lead singer and main songwriter for more than ten years. Red Rider included Ken Greer, Jeff Jones, Peter Boynton and Rob Baker. Bruce Allen managed the band from their debut until 1985. Cochrane recorded six studio albums with Red Rider plus a live album, a best-of album, and a box set. By 1986, the band was billed as &quot;Tom Cochrane &amp; Red Rider&quot;. He would later refer to this period of his career as a stretch of &quot;manageable success&quot; before the release of &quot;Mad Mad World&quot;.

In 2002, Cochrane reunited with his former Red Rider bandmates Greer and Jones and continues to perform with them.

===Solo career===

Already a household name in Canada from his time with Red Rider, Cochrane launched his solo career in 1991 with the release of the song &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot;. The single became a global success and was followed by the release of his album &quot;Mad Mad World&quot;, which would reach the six million mark in worldwide sales. The albums &quot;Ragged Ass Road&quot;, &quot;Songs of a Circling Spirit&quot;, &quot;Xray Sierra&quot; and &quot;No Stranger&quot; followed.

=== Today ===
An avid golfer, pilot, and hockey buff, Cochrane lives in Oakville, Ontario, with his wife Kathleene. He spends summers at his cottage/studio on the shores of Georgian Bay in Northern Ontario and winters part-time at his home outside of Austin, Texas. Cochrane and his wife have two daughters. Cochrane continues to tour and perform in Canada. In 2006, the group Rascal Flatts charted in the top 10 of the Hot 100 with a cover of &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot;, which they recorded for the Pixar film &quot;Cars&quot;. Although the song was not originally released to country radio, several country stations began playing the song, causing it to chart within the top 20 of Hot Country Songs. Chris Ledoux also had a country hit with &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot;.

In October 2016, Cochrane celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of his album &quot;Mad Mad World&quot; with an announcement of the release of a special edition of the album, featuring a demo recording of &quot;Love is a Highway&quot;, the working title of &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot;, as well as a second disc featuring a live performance from a 1992 Chicago stop on the tour supporting the album. In 2017, he toured with Meghan Patrick and Nice Horse, and released a coffee table book about the album.

In 2016, the Manitoba provincial government renamed a section of a highway near his hometown of Lynn Lake after the hit &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot;. A stretch of Highway 391 was renamed Tom Cochrane&#x27;s Life is a Highway.

<text>David Lipsky (born July 20, 1965) is an American author. His works have been &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers, &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Books, &quot;Time&quot;, Amazon, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, and NPR Best Books of the Year, and have been included in &quot;The Best American Magazine Writing&quot; and &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot; collections.

Lipsky received the National Magazine Award in 2009. He was portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg in the 2015 feature film &quot;The End of the Tour&quot;, an adaptation of his memoir &quot;Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself&quot;. He is a contributing editor at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He currently lives in New York City.

==Background and education==
David Lipsky was born in New York City, and is the son of the painter Pat Lipsky. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1983 and matriculated at Bennington College. Lipsky transferred in his sophomore year to Brown University, where he graduated magna cum laude and studied with the writer John Hawkes. He received his M.A. from Johns Hopkins University, where he studied with the novelist John Barth. Lipsky currently teaches creative writing at the M.F.A. program at New York University.

As an undergraduate, Lipsky published his story &quot;Three Thousand Dollars&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. It was selected by Raymond Carver as one of the &quot;Best American Short Stories&quot; of 1986. Carver was surprised by the author&#x27;s youth, noting in his introduction, I confess to not having read David Lipsky before this. Have I been asleep and missed some stories of his, or maybe even a novel or two? I don&#x27;t know. I do know I intend to pay attention from now on.

==Career==

===&quot;Three Thousand Dollars&quot; and &quot;The Art Fair&quot;===

As a graduate student, Lipsky wrote the stories that would become his first book, &quot;Three Thousand Dollars&quot; (1989). The novelist John Gregory Brown explained, &quot;It was kind of apparent that Lipsky might have the brightest future of anyone [here].&quot; The book was well received upon publication, with the trade publication &quot;Booklist&quot; summarizing, &quot;Critics loved Lipsky&#x27;s short story collection&quot;; the author was seen to possess &quot;unlimited depth and range of vision,&quot; and the stories were compared to the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, while noting the book&#x27;s &quot;astonishing insights into the New York art world,&quot; concluded, &quot;Lipsky has given his contemporaries a general autobiography, one that will fit the majority with only minor adjustments.&quot;

His novel &quot;The Art Fair&quot; (1996), a bildungsroman composed of a number of autobiographical elements, tells the story of Richard and Joan Freely—a New York artist and her precocious son. The novel won rave reviews and was named a &quot;Time&quot; Best Book of the Year. The work earned Lipsky comparisons to writers Michael Chabon and Harold Brodkey. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the novel &quot;riveting,&quot; &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described it &quot;a darkly comic love story,&quot; &quot;People&quot; noted, &quot;Lipsky&#x27;s portrayal of the art world is unblinking, his portrayal of the ties between parent and child deeply affecting&quot;; the critic Francine Prose called the book&#x27;s &quot;Darwinian&quot; milieu a &quot;testament to Lipsky&#x27;s skill&quot; and James Atlas wrote &quot;the novel perfectly captures artists and dealers, the tiny gestures of cruelty that confirm or withhold status.&quot; The trade publication &quot;Library Journal&quot; summarized, &quot;The praise has poured as thick as impasto.&quot;

===&quot;Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself&quot; and &quot;Absolutely American&quot;===

Lipsky&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;Absolutely American&quot; (2003) was written after the author spent four years living at West Point. The book&#x27;s genesis was a piece Lipsky wrote for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;—the longest article published in that magazine since Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;. As &quot;Newsweek&quot; noted, composition of the book required &quot;14,000 pages of interview transcripts, 60 notebooks and four pairs of boots&quot;; the magazine called the book &quot;addictive,&quot; and Lev Grossman in &quot;Time&quot; wrote that it was &quot;fascinating, funny, and tremendously well-written. Take a good look: this is the face America turns to most of the world, and until now it&#x27;s one that most of us have never seen.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, David Brooks called the book &quot;wonderfully told,&quot; praising it as both &quot;a superb description of modern military culture, and one of the most gripping accounts of university life I have read.&quot; Within a few weeks of publication, the work had sold out of most American distributors. As Sara Nelson reported in the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, It&#x27;s every author&#x27;s dream: You write a book that everybody loves. It gets fabulous reviews—one of them on the front page of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;. You appear on the Today show and on C-Span and you tape Charlie Rose. There&#x27;s even interest from Hollywood—and you fly out to take some meetings. There&#x27;s only one problem: There are precious few copies of your book to be found in the bookstores—and if someone wants one, they&#x27;re going to have to wait, sometimes as long as three weeks. That&#x27;s exactly the situation author David Lipsky found himself in last week.The work was a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller, Amazon Best Book of the Year, New York Times Notable Book, and a &quot;Time&quot; magazine Best Book of the Year. Lipsky optioned the motion picture and television rights to the story to Disney.

In April 2010, Lipsky published &quot;Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself&quot;, about a five-day road trip with the writer David Foster Wallace. In &quot;Time&quot; Magazine, Lev Grossman wrote, &quot;The transcript of their brilliant conversations reads like a two-man Tom Stoppard play or a four-handed duet scored for typewriter.&quot; &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; called the work, &quot;far-reaching, insightful, very funny, profound, surprising, and awfully human&quot;; at National Public Radio, Michael Schaub described the book as &quot;a startlingly sad yet deeply funny postscript to the career of one of the most interesting American writers of all time.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; noted, &quot;For readers unfamiliar with the sometimes intimidating Wallace oeuvre, Lipsky has provided a conversational entry point into the writer&#x27;s thought process. It&#x27;s odd to think that a book about Wallace could serve both the newbies and the hard-cores, but here it is.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, in a starred review, described the book as &quot;rollicking&quot; and &quot;compellingly real,&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as &quot;lovely,&quot; and Laura Miller in Salon called it &quot;exhilarating.&quot; The book was a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller and an NPR Best Book of the Year.

===&quot;The End of the Tour&quot;===

A feature film adaptation of &quot;Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself&quot;, &quot;The End of the Tour&quot;, was released in July 2015, with Academy Award-nominated actor Jesse Eisenberg portraying Lipsky and Jason Segel portraying Wallace. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic A.O. Scott wrote, &quot;I love it,&quot; adding, &quot;You hang on its every word and revel in its rough, vernacular beauty . . . There will always be films about writers and writing, and this one is just about as good as it gets.&quot;

The film received a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 159 reviews, with an average rating of 8.02/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Brilliantly performed and smartly unconventional, &quot;The End of the Tour&quot; pays fitting tribute to a singular talent while offering profoundly poignant observations on the human condition.&quot; The film also holds a score of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 35 reviews. At Rogerebert.com, critic Brian Tallerico called the film a &quot;joy,&quot; and &quot;stunning . . .a gift of highly intellectual discussion between two brilliant people at turning points in their lives,&quot; while also praising Jason Segel and Jesse Eisenberg.

The &quot;Washington Post&quot;″s Ann Hornaday gave the film four out of four stars and called it, &quot;A five-day conversation you won&#x27;t want to end ... Part love story, part road trip, part elegy to a bygone, pre-9/11 age, &#x27;The End of the Tour&#x27; brims with compassion and sharply honed insight&quot; about &quot;what it means to be human.&quot; In his review for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Richard Lawson called it a &quot;wise, humbly sublime film ... a profound, and profoundly affecting, movie, one that had me blubbering with happy-sad tears. What a pleasure to spend two hours in its company.&quot;

In his review for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Joe Neumaier awarded the film five out of five stars, calling it &quot;one of the best movies of the year . . . Director James Ponsoldt&#x27;s smart, incisive and extraordinary drama is the kind of film that burrows into your head and leaves you illuminated about life and how to live it.&quot; In her review for &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, Sheri Linden wrote &quot;James Ponsoldt&#x27;s magnificent &quot;The End of the Tour&quot; gives us two guys talking, and the effect is breathtaking ... They&#x27;re played with a wrought and wary chemistry, synapses blazing, by Jason Segel and Jesse Eisenberg.&quot;

In his review for &quot;Cut Print Film&quot;, Josh Oakley awarded the film a perfect &quot;10/10&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the best films of the year&quot;, and stating &quot;&quot;The End of the Tour&quot; presents, with ample evidence, Wallace as a figure who could never fill the holes of loneliness with the spackle of acclaim.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Richard Roeper awarded the film four out of four stars, calling it &quot;brilliant. . .this is one of the best movies of the year.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Minnesota Star Tribune&quot; Colin Covert gave the film four out of four stars, writing, &quot;Simply put, it is a masterwork.&quot;

The film featured in numerous &quot;Best of 2015&quot; lists, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Huffington Post&quot; &quot;Wired&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;.

===&quot;The Parrot and the Igloo&quot;===

In 2023 Norton published Lipsky&#x27;s &quot;The Parrot and the Igloo&quot;—a narrative history of climate and the science denial movement. In a starred pre-publication review, &quot;Kirkus&quot; called the work &quot;simultaneously captivating and disturbing . . . An important book that will leave your head shaking.&quot; &quot;Booklist&quot; wrote, &quot;with the amount of research that went into the book, this can be considered the historical record to date.&quot; In a starred review, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called the work &quot;revelatory . . . With dry wit and novelistic flair, National Magazine Award winner Lipsky chronicles how harnessing electricity changed the world. Buoyed by thorough historical research, this is a first-rate entry,&quot; adding &quot;Humor accompanies horrific truths in this vital look at the rise of climate change denial.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; explained, 
&quot;Lipsky offers a history of climate science―and with it, climate denial―starring a large cast of swindlers, zealots, politicians and hucksters to get to the heart of virulent anti-science ideologies in America.&quot;

The book featured in numerous &quot;Best of 2023&quot; lists, including Amazon, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;.

===Journalism===
Lipsky&#x27;s work has appeared in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Details&quot;, &quot;This American Life&quot;, and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;.

<text>In the Sumerian mythological poem &quot;Lugal-e&quot;, Asag or Azag (Sumerian: Akkadian: asakku), is a monstrous demon, so hideous that his presence alone makes fish boil alive in the rivers. Azag is a personification of winter cold and sicknesses.

This demon lives either in the Abyss or in the mountains and is accompanied by an army of rock demon offspring—born of his union with the mountains themselves.

He was vanquished by the heroic Akkadian deity Ninurta, using Sharur, his enchanted talking mace, after seeking the counsel of his father, the god Enlil.

== Asakku ==
The name Asakku is used by researchers as either a synonym of Azag or a &quot;variation&quot; in the form of multiple spirits and monsters that prey on humans and kill them by causing migraines.

<text>A Davenport desk, (sometimes originally known as a Devonport desk) is a small desk originating in England with an inclined lifting desktop attached with hinges to the back of the body. Lifting the desktop accesses a large compartment with storage space for paper and other writing implements, and smaller spaces in the forms of small drawers and pigeonholes. The Davenport has drawers on one of its sides, which are sometimes concealed by a panel. This stack of side drawers holds up the back of the desk and most of its weight.

==Overview==
The front of the desk stands on thick legs or pillars which are often highly carved, somewhat exaggerated, thick cabriole legs, but these are not essential. Davenport desks of the 19th century had a variety of different leg designs.

The desk shape is distinctive; its top part resembles an antique school desk while the bottom is like one of the two drawer-pedestals of a pedestal desk turned sideways. The addition of the two legs in front completes the odd effect.

This desk owes its name to a Captain Davenport who was the first to commission the design, from Gillows of Lancaster, near the end of the 18th century. In a sense then it could also be considered a campaign desk though there are no records indicating if Captain Davenport was in the British Army or the Royal Navy. 

This desk form was popular during the 19th century. There have been numerous reproductions during the 20th century, and amateur cabinetmakers sometimes consider a Davenport to be an interesting project.

The Davenport desk should not be confused with the Davenport sofa, which is usually a modern combination sofa and bed or an antique form of upholstered sofa based on a design conceived at the beginning of the 20th century by a Boston, Massachusetts, company called A. H. Davenport and Company.

<doc id="415325" wikidata="Q1767558" url="?curid=415325" title="Confide in Me (2001 album)">
<text>Confide in Me is a compilation album by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue, which was released in November 2001. Released on 18 November 2002 by BMG, the album collects work from Minogue&#x27;s Deconstruction period, including the albums &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; (1994) and &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; (1997). The album was ineligible to chart on the main U.K. albums chart due to being considered a budget album, but had a chart run on the Budget Albums Chart from 2002 to 2005, peaking at #4 in 2003. It received mixed reviews from music critics; whilst they praised the tracks from Deconstruction period, they felt that the album was too similar to the compilation album &quot;Hits+&quot;.

==Background==
Prior to being signed to Parlophone, Minogue&#x27;s labels had decided to release material from her previous records. &quot;Confide in Me&quot; was released by BMG, along with her other compilation album&#x27;s &quot;Hits+&quot; (2000), &quot;Greatest Hits 87-92&quot; (2002), &quot;Greatest Hits 87–97&quot; (2002) and &quot;Artist Collection&quot; (2004). Ultimately, neither of the compilations achieved high success but &quot;Hits+&quot; charted in the UK, while both Greatest Hits album charted in UK, Ireland and Japan.

The cover artwork uses pictures from the videos to &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;Some Kind of Bliss&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Confide in Me&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. AllMusic highlighted &quot;Some Kind of Bliss&quot;, &quot;Time Will Pass You By&quot; and &quot;Confide in Me&quot; as album highlights. Critics praised the album for its Deconstruction tracks, but felt it received no success because it was too similar to the album &quot;Hits+&quot;. An editor for Cduniverse explained: &quot;Fans of those albums should consider checking out Confide in Me; while it doesn&#x27;t feature the previously unreleased tracks that Hits + does, it does provide a more in-depth look at her two transitional albums.&quot;

The album was certified Silver by British Phonographic Industry (BPI), for shipments of 60,000 copies.

<text>Robert Jay Mathews (January 16, 1953 – December 8, 1984) was an American neo-Nazi terrorist and the leader of The Order, an American white supremacist militant group. He was burned alive during a shootout with approximately 75 federal law enforcement agents who surrounded his house on Whidbey Island, near Freeland, Washington.

== Life and activities ==

=== Early years ===
Robert Mathews was born in Marfa, Texas, on January 16, 1953, the youngest of three sons born to Johnny and Una Mathews. His father, of Scottish descent, was mayor of the town, and the President of the Chamber of Commerce, as well as a businessman and leader for the local Methodist church. His mother was the town&#x27;s Cub Scout den mother.

The family moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Though he was an average student in grade school, history and politics interested him. At age 11, he joined the John Birch Society, a right-wing advocacy group supporting paleoconservatism, anti-communism and limited government. Mathews was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1969.

Mathews formed the Sons of Liberty, an anti-communist militia whose members were mainly Mormon survivalists. At its peak, it had approximately 30 members. After filling out his employer&#x27;s W-4 Form claiming ten dependents, reportedly as an act of tax resistance, he was arrested for tax fraud, tried, and placed on probation for six months.

=== The Order ===
Mathews became a white supremacist and in 1982 he made an effort to recruit white families to the Pacific Northwest, or the White American Bastion.

In 1983, Mathews delivered a speech at a National Alliance convention reporting on his efforts to recruit on behalf of the organization, especially among &quot;the yeoman farmers and independent truckers,&quot; to his White American Bastion group. Mathews was a fan of the far-right extremist 1978 novel &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; written by National Alliance founder William Luther Pierce.

In late September 1983, at a barracks he constructed on his property in Metaline, Mathews and eight other men founded the organization The Order. They included his friend and neighbor, Ken Loff, and others from the Aryan Nations: Dan Bauer, Randy Duey, Denver Parmenter, Bruce Pierce, and David Lane; and the National Alliance: Richie Kemp and Bill Soderquist.

The group&#x27;s first task, according to Mathews&#x27; plan, was to obtain money to support white separatism. Their activities began to parallel events in the novel &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;. They robbed an adult bookstore in Spokane, Washington, which netted them $369.10. They agreed that was too risky, and turned to robbing armored cars and counterfeiting. They printed some counterfeit $50 bills, and 28-year-old Bruce Pierce was arrested after passing off a few of them.

To raise Pierce&#x27;s bail, Mathews, acting alone, robbed a bank just north of Seattle, Washington, stealing around $26,000. Some of The Order&#x27;s members, along with a new recruit, Gary Yarborough, carried out more robberies and burglaries, which netted them over $43,000. A subsequent robbery yielded several hundred thousand dollars. Another recruit, Tom Martinez, was caught and charged for passing more counterfeit currency. Then in July 1984, they deployed approximately a dozen men in a successful effort to rob a Brink&#x27;s truck of $3,600,000.

The group distributed some of the stolen money to the North Carolina–based White Patriot Party and other white nationalist organizations.

=== Final days ===
Prior to his death, Mathews wrote a long letter declaring war on the federal government of the United States and justifying his group&#x27;s actions. In it, he describes threats allegedly made to members of his family by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, including to his young son while he was away from his house, as well as a number of attempts on his life by other government agents. He explained the reasons for his decision to &quot;quit being the hunted and become the hunter,&quot; and closed by writing, &quot;I am not going into hiding[;] rather I will press the FBI and let them know what it is like to become the hunted. Doing so it is only logical to assume that my days on this planet are rapidly drawing to a close. Even so, I have no fear. For the reality of my life is death, and the worst the enemy can do to me is shorten my tour of duty in this world. I will leave knowing that I have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the future of my children.&quot;

Mathews and the other members of The Order were eventually betrayed by Martinez, who became an FBI informant after his arrest for counterfeiting. After he revealed information regarding Mathews&#x27; activities to the FBI, agents moved to capture Mathews and his associates, leading to one of the largest manhunts in FBI history. By the time they could set up the operation, all of Mathews&#x27; accomplices and friends had decided to move to safe houses. The government&#x27;s agents surrounded Mathews in a house near Freeland, Washington on Whidbey Island on December 7, 1984. Mathews refused to come out and negotiations continued until December 8, when Mathews refused to talk anymore. The FBI then fired dozens of smoke grenades and a stun grenade into the house in an attempt to force Mathews out, but were thwarted by his use of a gas mask. Mathews opened fire on several agents who attempted to enter the house, and a long standoff began. When a helicopter appeared at nightfall, Mathews opened fire on it from an upstairs the helicopter&#x27;s crew was and then once again exchanged gunfire with federal agents. An FBI agent then fired three M79 Starburst flares inside the house from the helicopter, setting off a box of hand grenades and a stockpile of ammunition. Mathews continued to fire an assault rifle at agents as the house burned, but then suddenly stopped. After the wreckage had cooled enough to be searched, agents found the burned remains of 31-year-old Mathews&#x27; body, with a pistol still in his hand. An autopsy concluded that Mathews had died from a combination of burns and smoke inhalation. Mathews had fired over 1,000 rounds at law enforcement, but no agents were injured.

Mathews&#x27; remains were cremated and the ashes scattered by his family on his property in Metaline, Washington.

Eventually, dozens were convicted of crimes connected to The Order, on charges that included racketeering, conspiracy, counterfeiting, transporting stolen money, armored car robbery, and violation of civil rights. Sentences of up to 252 years were imposed. Also prosecuted were members of The Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, a far-right paramilitary allied with The Order which had declared war on the federal government as well. Most of their leading members received lengthy prison terms for illegal weapons possession and racketeering.

Later, ten people connected to the case, including Butler, Lane, and Pierce, were tried for sedition, but were acquitted by a jury.

== In popular culture ==
Mathews was portrayed by Peter Gallagher in the 1999 television film &quot;Brotherhood of Murder&quot; and by Nicholas Hoult in the 2024 theatrical film &quot;The Order&quot;.

<text>Arctostaphylos (; from &quot;bear&quot; and &quot;bunch of grapes&quot;) is a genus of plants comprising the manzanitas () and bearberries. There are about 60 species of &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot;, ranging from ground-hugging arctic, coastal, and mountain shrub to small trees up to tall. Most are evergreen (one species deciduous), with small oval leaves long, arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pale pink, and borne in small clusters of 2–20 together; flowering is in the spring. The fruit are small berries, ripening in the summer or autumn. The berries of some species are edible.

&quot;Arctostaphylos&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Coleophora arctostaphyli&quot; (which feeds exclusively on &quot;A. uva-ursi&quot;) and &quot;Coleophora glaucella&quot;.

==Distribution==
Manzanitas, the bulk of &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot; species, are present in the chaparral biome of western North America, where they occur from southern British Columbia in Canada, Washington to California and New Mexico in the United States, and throughout much of northern and central Mexico.

One species, however, &quot;A. uva-ursi&quot; (common bearberry), is adapted to arctic and subarctic climates and has a distribution in northern North America, Asia and Europe.

An unusual association of manzanita occurs on Hood Mountain, in Sonoma County, California, where stands of pygmy forest dominated by Mendocino cypress are found.

==Fossil record==
One fossil fruit of †&quot;Arctostaphylos globula&quot; and several fossil fruits of †&quot;Arctostaphylos menzelii&quot; have been described from middle Miocene strata of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark.

==Cultivation==
Cultivation is generally difficult due to fungal diseases, and often salinity and alkalinity. Overhead watering should be avoided in hot weather. Some cultivars are easier to grow.

<text>The Navy Unit Commendation (NUC) is a United States Navy and United States Coast Guard unit award that was established by order of the Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal on 18 December 1944.

==History==
Navy and U.S. Marine Corps commands may recommend any Navy or Marine Corps unit for the NUC that has distinguished itself by outstanding heroism in action against the enemy, but not sufficient to justify the award of the Presidential Unit Citation. A unit must have performed service of a character comparable to that which would merit the award of a Silver Star Medal for heroism, or a Legion of Merit for non-combat meritorious service to an individual. Normal performance of duty or participation in many combat missions does not, in itself, justify the award. An award will not be made to a unit for actions of one or more of its component parts, unless the unit performed uniformly as a team, in a manner justifying collective recognition.

U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Space Force, and U.S Coast Guard units are also eligible to be awarded the NUC as long as they are directly attached or assigned to U.S. Navy or Marine Corps units during the time period or event for which the award is given. U.S. Army members of units awarded the NUC wear the Navy Unit Commendation ribbon on the right side of the uniform jacket rather than left side along with any other unit award emblems which are authorized for wear. The NUC may be conferred upon the armed forces of friendly foreign nations serving with the U.S. Armed Forces, provided such units meet the standards established for Navy and Marine Corps units.

Additional awards of the Navy Unit Commendation are denoted by inch bronze stars.

<doc id="415339" wikidata="Q571462" url="?curid=415339" title="Nototheniidae">
<text>: &quot;In some scientific literature, the term &quot;cod icefish&quot; is used to identify members of this family. This should not be confused with the term &quot;icefish,&quot; which refers to the &quot;white-blooded&quot; fishes of the family Channichthyidae. See Icefish (disambiguation).&quot;
Nototheniidae, the notothens or cod icefishes, is a family of ray-finned fishes, part of the suborder Notothenioidei which is traditionally placed within the order Perciformes. They are largely found in the Southern Ocean.

==Taxonomy==
Nototheniidae was described as a family in 1861 by the German-born British ichthyologist Albert Günther with the type genus being &quot;Notothenia&quot; which had been described in 1844 by Sir John Richardson with the species &quot;Notothenia coriiceps&quot; which Richardson had also described in 1844 subsequently being designated as the type in 1862 by Theodore Nicholas Gill. The name &quot;Notothenia&quot; means &quot;coming from the south&quot;, a reference to the Antarctic distribution of the genus. They are traditionally placed in the order Perciformes together with their relatives, Actual phylogenetic relationships among species of suborder Notothenioidei have not yet been determined with certainty.

===Genera===
The following subfamilies and genera are classified within the family Nototheniidae:
* Pleuragrammatinae 
** &quot;Aethotaxis&quot; 
** &quot;Dissostichus&quot; 
** &quot;Gvozdarus&quot; 
** &quot;Pleuragramma&quot; 
* Nototheniinae 
** &quot;Gobionotothen&quot; 
** &quot;Lepidonotothen&quot; 
** &quot;Lindbergichthys&quot; 
** &quot;Notothenia&quot; 
** &quot;Nototheniops&quot; 
** &quot;Paranotothenia&quot; 
** &quot;Patagonotothen&quot; 
* Trematominae 
** &quot;Cryothenia&quot; 
** &quot;Pagothenia&quot; 
** &quot;Trematomus&quot; 

These subfamilies are not recognised in the 5th Edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Nototheniidae fishes have fusiform or elongate and oblong bodies. They typically have two dorsal fins, the first having 3 to 11 spines and the second having 25–42 segmented fin rays. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin and has 22 to 40 segmented rays. All but the last dorsal and anal fin rays are branched. The caudal fin is rounded to forked and the pectoral fins are large. The mouth is terminal and may be horizontal or angled with a protrusible upper jaw. There are no teeth on the roof of the mouth. in most species there are no spines on the preoperculum or operculum. Any scales are usually ctenoid although the spinules may be reduced or absent. They have between 1 and 3 lateral lines. They vary in size from. Total length of in &quot;Patagonotothen cornucola&quot; to in the Patagonian toothfish (&quot;Dissostichus eleginoides&quot;).

==Distribution and habitat==
Nototheniidae species are largely found in the Southern Ocean and are particularly abundant off the shores of Antarctica. As the dominant Antarctic fish taxa, they occupy both sea-bottom and water-column ecological niches.

Nototheniidae is a family of teleost fishes found mainly in the Southern Ocean, surrounding the continent of Antarctica. The family comprises about 50 species of fish that are adapted to living in the cold, nutrient-rich waters of the Southern Ocean. The Nototheniidae family includes some of the most ecologically and evolutionarily important fish in the Antarctic ecosystem, making them a crucial subject for scientific study.

Nototheniidae is a family of perciform fish that are primarily found in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, with some species also occurring in the sub-Antarctic regions of the southern hemisphere. They are known for their unique adaptations to the cold, such as the ability to produce antifreeze proteins to prevent their bodily fluids from freezing. The family includes over 100 species, making it the most diverse group of fish in the Southern Ocean. Nototheniidae inhabits a variety of habitats, from shallow coastal waters to deep ocean trenches. Many species are bottom-dwellers and can be found in rocky areas or on the seafloor, while others are pelagic and swim in the water column. Some species migrate seasonally to different habitats for feeding or spawning purposes. Due to their abundance in the Southern Ocean, Nototheniidae is an important part of the food chain for many marine predators, including seals, whales, and birds.

==Biology==
Nototheniidae species have no swim bladder, however, they have other depth-related adaptations, such as increased fatty tissues and reduced mineralization of the bones, resulting in a body density approaching neutral, to fill a variety of niches. The spleen may be used to remove ice crystals from circulating blood. As the chilly Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters of the Southern Ocean average , most species of these regions produce antifreeze glycoproteins to prevent the formation of ice crystals in blood and other body fluids.

The concentration of antifreeze glycoproteins can vary with differing environmental conditions, such as colder environments caused by location. Larger amounts of the proteins have been found in species with habitats in higher latitudes, due to the higher expression of the protein and longer degradation time compared to relatives in more temperate regions, portraying flexible temperature regulation.

Some species exhibit polymorphism, for example, the circum-Antarctic &quot;Trematomus newnesi&quot; exists as two morphs in the Ross Sea, the typical morph and a large-mouthed/broad-headed morph.

==Fisheries==
Nototheniidae species are the major fish resource in the Southern Ocean, many notothens are under increasing pressure from commercial fishing, particularly the Patagonian toothfish and the Antarctic toothfish.

<doc id="415341" wikidata="Q1993197" url="?curid=415341" title="Nintendo e-Reader">
<text>The Nintendo e-Reader, commonly abbreviated as e-Reader, is an add-on manufactured by Nintendo for its Game Boy Advance handheld video game console. It was released in Japan in December 2001, with a North American release following in September 2002. It has an LED scanner that reads &quot;e-Reader cards&quot;, paper cards with specially encoded data printed on them.

Depending on the card and associated game, the e-cards are typically used in a key-like function to unlock secret items, levels, or play mini-games when swiped through the reader. The cards themselves contain data, as opposed to unlocking data already on the device itself.

==Usage and versions==
Two versions were released in Japan: the original e-Reader (without a link cable port), which could read cards to unlock game content, etc.; and later the e-Reader+ (simply &quot;e-Reader&quot; in Australia and North America), which came with a link cable port to connect with GameCube games such as &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; and with other Game Boy Advance systems for games such as &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. The e-Reader was only considered successful in Japan. In 2004, Nintendo&#x27;s head European PR confirmed that the e-Reader would not be releasing in Europe, following a year of confusion surrounding the subject. It was discontinued in North America in early 2004, due to a lack of popularity. In Japan, it sold much better and was produced up to the discontinuation of the Game Boy hardware line.

In order to add items and scan levels in games such as &quot;Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, a player required two Game Boy Advance systems and a link cable. The gray end would go into the e-Reader GBA and the purple end into the GBA that had the game. After entering the needed point on the game, players would swipe the cards in and the data would be transferred to the game cartridge. This function does not work with the Nintendo DS due to the lack of link cable support.

===e-Reader cards===

In the U.S., e-Reader Card packs have been released that contain:
#NES games
#New levels and power-ups for &quot;Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;
#Items and designs for &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;
#New trainers to battle in &quot;Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire&quot;
#Mini-games, including an exclusive version of &quot;Mario Party&quot;.
#Game &amp; Watch Cards; originally there were plans to release more Game and Watch games as a series of E-reader cards. Only Manhole-e was officially released.

There have been numerous other games released with e-Reader support in Japan.

===Dot code===
Data is encoded on the cards using &quot;dot code&quot;, a specialized barcode technology licensed from Olympus Corporation. e-Reader Cards may have one or two sets of dot code on them, either a wide strip on the left side of the card, a wide strip on both the left and right sides of the card, a narrow strip on the bottom of the card or a short strip on the bottom of the card with a long strip on the left side of the card. Smaller games may require scanning only one card (two sets of dot code), while the greater NES games can require as many as five cards (nine to ten sets of dot code) in order to start the application.

The shorter sets of dot code were only used with the Pokémon Trading Card Game. Cards released in regular sets published by both Nintendo and Wizards of the Coast had a dot code on the bottom side of the card. When scanned, the e-Reader displayed a Pokédex data entry for the Pokémon shown on the card. Many of the cards published by Wizards of the Coast included a left side dot code that would allow users to play mini-games, animations, and use secret attacks in the Trading Card Game or play with various songs and graphics.

==Compatibility==

The e-Reader plugs into the cartridge slot of the Game Boy Advance like a regular game would. The end of the e-Reader sticks out from the Game Boy Advance unit to provide a slot to scan the e-Reader Cards. Electronically, the e-Reader is compatible with any console that supports Game Boy Advance games, but it may be mechanically incompatible with some systems (it simply does not fit), and the ability to link consoles may not be available.

Once installed, the link cable connector on the Game Boy Advance is obstructed, but a pass-through connection on the e-Reader allows link-up features to be used. The Game Boy Advance SP is also fully compatible, although the e-Reader does not mount flush with the SP. As the link cable connector on the SP is unobstructed, the pass-through on the e-Reader is not used. An additional cover (AGB-016) can be added to the e-reader in order to avoid damaging the 6 pin connector when linked to a GBA SP.

The Game Boy Player is also fully compatible, and the e-Reader connects as it would to a Game Boy Advance (the e-Reader pass-through connector is used for connecting the link cable). The GameCube hosting this system acts as a Game Boy Advance - in order to link to a GameCube game, a second GameCube (or a Wii) running the game in question, must be used.

The e-Reader can fit into the DS Lite, but not the original DS. The e-Reader can, however, be modified to fit into the original DS. In either case, there is no support for linking features, as neither system has a link cable port.

The e-Reader fits into the Game Boy Micro and has a link cable port, but not a standard connector. A special Game Boy Micro Game Link Cable must be used for linking features. The Game Boy Micro&#x27;s non-standard link cable port can not accept the GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable, meaning it cannot link with GameCube games without modification to the cable.

Because the first version of the Japanese e-Reader did not have a link cable pass-through connector, it can fit into consoles which the later e-Readers are incompatible with. Even though the Game Boy Advance and the DS are region-free, Japanese e-Reader cards work only on Japanese e-Readers and North American e-Reader cards will only work on North American e-Readers. The system will display &#x27;region error&#x27; on both systems if a user attempts to use another region&#x27;s cards on their own device.

==Game list==
===&quot;Classic NES Series&quot;===
Each game in this series comes in a pack of five cards, each of which must be scanned twice, on both sides. There are thirteen games in this series; each is a direct port of the one-player mode of the classic NES game of the same title (minus the added &quot;-e&quot; suffix). &quot;Excitebike&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, and &quot;Ice Climber&quot;, all released as e-Reader cards, were later released in cartridge form as part of the Classic NES Series on Game Boy Advance. Also, all games except &quot;Urban Champion&quot; were included as unlockables in the GameCube game &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, in full two-player mode where applicable, and all games except &quot;Golf&quot; were included in Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console.

All NES titles released include:
===&quot;Animal Crossing-e&quot;===
A series of &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; cards were released for the e-Reader. When used with the post office in the game, the cards could provide items to players, unlock &quot;town tunes&quot;, or unlock new designs to be used around the village. Some were &quot;sibling&quot; cards (series 2–4) with two related characters on the front. In addition to being sold in card packs, some regular series cards were distributed on a promotional basis through GameStop, EB Games, and Energizer batteries.

===&quot;Pokémon Battle-e&quot;===
The &quot;Pokémon Battle-e&quot; Cards, when scanned into &quot;Pokémon Ruby or Sapphire&quot;, allowed the player to load up special trainers to battle or to get special berries. In Japan, the series was sold as six sets, each with a different theme, with 10 cards in each set (8 trainers, 1 berry, and 1 checklist), while in the US, the series was packaged together to have two themes per pack. In addition, 2 promo cards, 1 for each version, were packed in with the games. The cards are loaded into &quot;Ruby&quot; or &quot;Sapphire&quot; through the Mystery Events function once it is unlocked.

There were additional &quot;Battle-e&quot; card sets for &quot;Pokémon FireRed&quot;, &quot;LeafGreen&quot; and &quot;Emerald&quot; in Japan, but due to the e-Reader being discontinued in the US they were never released in other regions. The e-Reader functionality was eventually removed from all non-Japanese versions of the games.

===&quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot;===
In &quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot;, there is a Colosseum at the back of Phenac City. There are two large doors, which in the English version lead to the same arena. In the Japanese version the right door goes to the arena, while the left door leads to a special e-Reader area where players can scan in extra cards to battle additional trainers and capture three more Shadow Pokémon.

===&quot;Pokémon Pinball: Ruby &amp; Sapphire&quot;===

There were five cards that were released that were compatible with the Japanese version. These cards make minor tweaks to the gameplay, but do not add any new features.
===&quot;Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3-e&quot;===

There are 36 cards, divided into two series: 18 for Series 1 and 18 for Series 2. In each package of 18 cards there are five demo cards, five level cards, eight power-up cards, and a promotional card without data strips which only contains an advertisement for the &quot;Pokémon Battle-e&quot; cards. More were released in Japan, but they never saw American release due to the discontinuation of the device.

Two promotional cards came packed in with every US and Australian copy of the game sold. Five additional cards were released for a very short time and were packed in with the game and sold exclusively at Walmart stores in the US. These five cards have become extremely hard to find, as the e-Reader had been discontinued in North America not long after the release of the game. The two e-Reader cards that were initially bundled with &quot;Super Mario Advance 4&quot; have since been discontinued.

The Virtual Console rerelease of the game for Wii U and the Nintendo Switch Online release include all of the e-Reader levels, including those that were never released outside of Japan.

===&quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; and &quot;Mega Man Zero 3&quot; cards===
The Japanese &quot;Mega Man&quot; games for GBA used Card Reader e+ cards to customize their game with the e-Reader +. The cards caused various effects as, such as Base HP, Abilities, Buster Changes, Charge Shot Modifications, B+ Back Abilities. There are even Item Cards which can give out sets of Battle Chips, Sub Chips, BugFrags, Zenny, and even Navi Customizer Programs (only introduced in &quot;Mega Man Battle Network 6&quot; Modification Card Part 1 &amp; &quot;Battle Network 6&quot; Modification Card Part 2). They could also cause negative effects (&#x27;Bugs&#x27;) to happen, causing such effects as causing Mega Man to lose health and move the wrong way, or causing the player to be unable to control it. As for the &quot;Mega Man Zero 3&quot; cards, they change the Resistance Base and add an overhaul of new things to it as well as Weapon Upgrades and Bullet Appearances to make an actual Buster Shot look like a real bullet that an actual gun fires.

The only way to gain the cards&#x27; effects in the English versions is through various cheating devices, such as Code Breaker, Action Replay and GameShark (although in &quot;Battle Network 6&quot; all e-Reader content was removed from the European and American versions, and can no longer be accessed). The &quot;Mega Man Zero Collection&quot;, &quot;Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection&quot;, and &quot;Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection&quot; releases include the e-Reader bonuses for &quot;Mega Man Zero 3&quot; and &quot;Battle Network 4&quot;–&quot;6&quot; as unlockables, marking the first time they have been legitimately accessible outside of Japan.

===&quot;F-Zero: GP Legend&quot;===

Exclusive to the Japanese version, e+ cards could be used to unlock additional machines, race courses, and staff ghosts to race in the game&#x27;s time trial mode.

===Other===
* E3 2002 Promo Pack: A very rare promotional pack given away at the 2002 E3 conference, this pack contained a variant Manhole e-card, two Pokémon trading card game cards and a Kirby card that, when scanned, would tell the player if they have won a prize. The Kirby card is considered to be the rarest e-Reader card produced.
* Mario Party-e: A complete card game with 64 cards using the e-Reader for minigames.
** &quot;Mario Party&quot;-e Promo Card: While not an e-Reader Card (the card contains no dot codes), a promotional &quot;Two Coin Card&quot; was packed with GamePro magazine and can be fully used with the Mario Party-e game.
* Air Hockey-e: A promotional card given away at various retailers when the e-Reader was initially released. This card plays a real game of fast-paced air hockey. An AU-exclusive version of this card was packed in with the e-Reader when sold in Australia.
* Manhole-e: A port of the original Game &amp; Watch game. Included with the e-Reader, the player must close the manholes as pedestrians pass by. A complete Game &amp; Watch card series was planned for release, but never made it to stores.
* FoxBox Kirby Slide Puzzle: A slide puzzle game included in issue 175 of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; and in an issue of &quot;Tips &amp; Tricks Magazine&quot;. It was also given away with FoxBox promotional boxes at Toys R Us.
* EON Ticket: A promotional card given away at E3, at Toys R Us during the EON Ticket Summer Tour in 2003 and in issue 173 of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. This card was used to get &quot;Latias&quot; or &quot;Latios&quot; on &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; or &quot;Pokémon Sapphire&quot; by allowing the player access to the Southern Island location. &quot;Latias&quot; was given in the former and &quot;Latios&quot; was given in the latter. 
* Pokémon Channel: Three US exclusive cards and three Australian variant cards were released with the GameCube game &quot;Pokémon Channel&quot;. The USA version holds a &quot;6-Pattern&quot; card, a Pikachu card and a Kyogre card, whereas the Australian version has a Jirachi card, instead of the Kyogre card.
* Domo-Kun no Fushigi Terebi: Released in packs exclusively throughout Japan, little is known about this series to English-speakers. The cards extended the original title by a great number of mini-games and events not available on the cartridge.
* Mario vs. Donkey Kong: CoroCoro Comic had a competition where 1,000 people won a set of five cards, and a sixth was distributed at the 2004 Next-Generation World Hobby Fair. Despite there being data for twelve levels within the game, only these six cards were released. They are considered to be among the rarest of e-Cards. While connecting the North American version of the game to a Japanese e-Reader+ and fully scanning one of the cards will reveal the e-Reader menu, the cards cannot be used to unlock any levels, but all versions of the GBA game have the data for these 12 levels, unlockable via Action Replay codes.
* Pikmin 2-e: Exclusive to Japan, six packs of e-Reader minigames were released subsequent to the release of &quot;Pikmin 2&quot;. These games challenge players to pluck all the Pikmin in an area in a set amount of steps, to try to get Pikmin from one point to another without injury, etc. The cards contain region-specific encoding blocking their use with North American systems.

<text>Armârôs (Aramaic: תרמני, Greek: , ) was the 11th watcher on a list of 20 leaders of a group of 200 fallen angels called Grigori or &quot;Watchers&quot; in the Book of Enoch. The name means &quot;cursed one&quot; or &quot;accursed one&quot;. The name &#x27;Armaros&#x27; is likely a Greek corruption of what may be originally an Aramaic name, Armoni.
In accordance to that possible original name, he may be identified as Armoniel (curse of god), also mentioned in chapter 7 in the Book of Enoch). Michael Knibb, Professor of Old Testament Studies at King&#x27;s College London, lists the meaning of his name as being &quot;the one from Hermon&quot;.

:&quot;Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it. And they were in all two hundred; who descended in the days of Jared on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it.&quot; - Book of Enoch

<doc id="415343" wikidata="Q1939021" url="?curid=415343" title="Missing Persons (band)">
<text>Missing Persons is an American rock band founded in 1980 in Los Angeles by guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, vocalist Dale Bozzio (née Consalvi), and drummer Terry Bozzio. They later added bassist Patrick O&#x27;Hearn and keyboardist Chuck Wild. Dale&#x27;s quirky voice and heavy makeup made the band a favorite on MTV in the early 1980s.

Dale and Terry Bozzio met while working with Frank Zappa, and they married in 1979. Cuccurullo encountered the pair while contributing to the Zappa album &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; (1979). O&#x27;Hearn was also a former member of Zappa&#x27;s touring band, and Wild had played with a variety of bands before joining.

==Early history==
=== Early years and &quot;Spring Session M&quot; (1980–1983) ===
In 1980 the band was a trio consisting of Bozzio, Bozzio and Cuccurullo. Augmented by session musicians, the group made its first record, a 4-song EP entitled &quot;Missing Persons&quot;, in Zappa&#x27;s brand-new Utility Muffin Research Kitchen studios; the recording was financed by Cuccurullo&#x27;s father. The band toured, promoted the EP, appeared in the film &quot;Lunch Wagon&quot; (1981), and became a must-see band among the Los Angeles live music crowd. &quot;Mental Hopscotch&quot; was a No. 1 record on local radio station KROQ-FM, and the self-promoted EP sold 7,000 copies.

Two years of hard work led up to a signing with Capitol Records in 1982. With label support, the re-released 4-song EP—with the song &quot;Words&quot; replacing the Doors cover &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot;—sold another 250,000 units. By this time, the band had added Wild (a session player on the debut EP) and O&#x27;Hearn (Terry Bozzio&#x27;s former Frank Zappa bandmate) to the line-up, and they recorded a new full-length album &quot;Spring Session M&quot; (1982), the title of which is an anagram of &#x27;Missing Persons&#x27;. The album included both &quot;Words&quot; and &quot;Destination Unknown&quot; from the initial EP, and went gold.

&quot;Spring Session M&quot; spun off four singles: &quot;Destination Unknown&quot;, &quot;Words&quot;, &quot;Walking in L.A.&quot;, and &quot;Windows&quot;, all of which made the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, although none charted higher than #42. The band did experience considerable success in the local markets of Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco. As well, the visual effects used in the music video for &quot;Words&quot; were unusual for the time, making it popular on the fledgling cable TV channel MTV.

Missing Persons appeared at a three-day Southern California concert known as the US Festival, in 1983, along with David Bowie, the Pretenders, U2 and Stevie Nicks.

=== Decline and &quot;Rhyme &amp; Reason&quot; (1984–1986) ===
The group followed up their debut with the experimental album &quot;Rhyme &amp; Reason&quot; (1984), which was neither a commercial nor a critical success. The video for &quot;Surrender Your Heart&quot; was designed by Peter Max and received play on MTV, but the track failed to reach the Hot 100. Only the single &quot;Give&quot; met with any chart response. Chuck Wild left Missing Persons after this album, and was not replaced.

Capitol was not happy about the direction the band was taking, as well as their commercial downturn. Consequently, production reins for the third album were given to Bernard Edwards of proven hitmakers Chic; he had also recently produced &quot;The Power Station&quot;. The result was the more conventional album &quot;Color in Your Life&quot; which was issued in June 1986 and only had a minor hit &quot;I Can&#x27;t Think About Dancin.

During the short-lived promotional tour for &quot;Color in Your Life&quot;, increasing tensions between Terry and Dale Bozzio led to the end of the tour, the couple&#x27;s marriage, and the band.

==Reunions==
===2001–2003===
In late 2000, Cuccurullo and Dale Bozzio again began discussing a Missing Persons reunion. In May 2001, after Cuccurullo&#x27;s split with Duran Duran, the new Missing Persons appeared, consisting of original members Cuccurullo, Dale and Terry Bozzio. Joining them were Ron Poster (jazz pianist and organist for the Boston Bruins home hockey arena) and Cuccurullo&#x27;s bassist, Wes Wehmiller (formerly Duran Duran&#x27;s tour bassist from 1997 to 2001). The short-lived, official reunion consisted of promotional activities and three live performances in July 2001. The studio tracks &quot;Dark and Dangerous Guy&quot; and &quot;Throw Money&quot; that appear on &quot;Lost Tracks&quot; (2002) were recorded at this time, as well as the live performances of &quot;Face to Face&quot; and &quot;Give&quot; on the same album.

Late 2002/early 2003 brought &#x27;Missing Persons featuring Dale Bozzio and Warren Cuccurullo&#x27;. They were joined again by Poster and Wehmiller and new drummer Joe Travers (formerly in Cuccurullo&#x27;s solo band and Duran Duran&#x27;s tour drummer from 1999 to 2001). This version of Missing Persons was featured on &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; (performing &quot;Destination Unknown&quot;) and did three live performances in February 2003, but disbanded shortly after.

===2009 and 2011–present===
In 2009, Dale Bozzio and Warren Cuccurullo again reunited the band; with the line-up this time consisting of Bozzio, Cuccurullo, Travers, keyboardist Scheila Gonzalez, and bassist Doug Lunn.

On May 11, 2011, it was announced on Dale Bozzio&#x27;s website that &quot;Dale and Warren have reformed Missing Persons for an incredible reunion tour in anticipation of the 30th Anniversary of &quot;Spring Session M&quot;, the band&#x27;s groundbreaking, certified-Gold album originally released in 1982.&quot; In the same announcement, Terry Bozzio&#x27;s absence in this reunion was explained by stating that &quot;rock bands are dysfunctional families at best, and sometimes, the show just can&#x27;t go on with all on-board.&quot; In addition to Bozzio and Cuccurullo, this line-up consisted of Prescott Niles of the Knack on bass, Patrick Bolen on guitars, Fred Bensi on keyboards, and Andy Sanesi on drums. Cuccurullo again departed the band following the end of the 2011 shows; but the band has not officially dissolved since then.

On March 4, 2014, a new Missing Persons album was issued, entitled &quot;Missing in Action&quot; and credited to &quot;Missing Persons featuring Dale Bozzio&quot;. Missing Persons now consisted of Dale Bozzio and multi-instrumentalist Billy Sherwood. Sherwood played almost all the instruments on the record, wrote most of the material, and produced; Bozzio sang, and also co-wrote two songs.

In March 2020, another new album appeared credited to Missing Persons featuring Dale Bozzio, entitled &quot;Dreaming&quot;. The group now consisted of Dale Bozzio on vocals, and Adam Hamilton producing and playing almost every instrument. This album consisted mostly of radically re-worked covers of songs by 1960s and 70s artists such as the Mamas &amp; the Papas, the Cars, the The (Matt Johnson), and Joy Division; Bozzio and Hamilton also wrote three originals for the album.

Missing Persons released their first album of completely original material in 37 years, &quot;Hollywood Lie&quot;, on November 10, 2023.

===Reunions===
Since 1986, Warren Cuccurullo, Terry Bozzio, and Patrick O&#x27;Hearn have continued to support each other&#x27;s solo projects. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, Cuccurullo and Bozzio performed on some of O&#x27;Hearn&#x27;s albums. Also, O&#x27;Hearn performed in a jazz fusion group called OUTtrio with Terry Bozzio, and Bozzio is featured on Warren Cuccurullo&#x27;s CD &quot;Playing in Tongues&quot; that was released in March 2009.

==Solo careers==
After the band broke up Cuccurullo had his greatest commercial success as guitarist for Duran Duran. Replacing original guitarist Andy Taylor in August 1986, he performed on the albums &quot;Notorious&quot; (1986) and &quot;Big Thing&quot; (1988), and was the sole guitarist on the global tours that followed. Becoming an official member in June 1989, he appeared on the group&#x27;s next five studio albums, and was a co-writer of the hit singles &quot;Ordinary World&quot; and &quot;Come Undone&quot;. He left Duran Duran in 2001 due to a reunion of the group&#x27;s original members. Cuccurullo also recorded several solo albums before leaving Duran Duran. Later he collaborated with Neil Carlill in the experimental rock band Chicanery.

Dale Bozzio scored success as a solo performer under the name Dale with a top 40 hit on the Billboard Dance Chart, &quot;Simon Simon&quot;, produced by Robert Brookins. Her album &quot;Riot in English&quot; was released in 1988 on Prince&#x27;s Paisley Park label and her album &quot;Make Love Not War&quot; and &quot;Talk Talk&quot; EP were released on related labels in 2010. With Cleopatra Records she released &quot;New Wave Sessions&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Missing in Action&quot; in 2014.

Terry Bozzio worked in 1987 with Mick Jagger and Jeff Beck. He has played with several groups and artists as a session or tour drummer including the Knack. He records albums and instructional videos in multiple styles and is a highly sought-after session/tour drummer as well as performing constantly at European music festivals and worldwide drum clinics. Most recently, Bozzio performed and recorded with California nu metal band Korn, in place of regular band drummer David Silveria, in preparation for their untitled eighth studio album.

Patrick O&#x27;Hearn is a composer and performer of ambient instrumental music on his own albums, and for television and movies.

Chuck Wild became an in-demand session player, playing keyboards on albums for Michael Jackson, Paula Abdul, and the Pointer Sisters. He composes new-age and meditation music under the name Liquid Mind, and also has released a digital only project entitled &quot;Soundtrack of the Inner World&quot; with singer-songwriter Seven Whitfield.

==Reissues==
&quot;Spring Session M&quot; was released on CD in 1995, followed by &quot;Rhyme &amp; Reason&quot; and &quot;Color in Your Life&quot; in 2000. All three reissues included unreleased B-sides and/or live tracks. &quot;Classic Masters&quot; is a compilation of remastered tracks and dance mixes issued by Capitol Records.

Beginning in 1997, Cuccurullo began work on his Missing Persons Archival Trilogy project. The first CD to be released was &quot;Late Nights Early Days&quot; in 1998, a live concert recorded in 1981 with the added 1980 studio track &quot;Action/Reaction&quot;. This was followed up by a compilation of modern remixes of classic MP tracks, &quot;Missing Persons Remixed Hits&quot; (1999) which included the TV Mania remix of &quot;Destination Unknown&quot;. In 2002 &quot;Lost Tracks&quot; was released, a collection of rare Missing Persons studio, live and remixed tracks from five different eras of the band.

In January 2021, the band&#x27;s first three albums &quot;Spring Session M&quot;, &quot;Rhyme &amp; Reason&quot; and &quot;Color in Your Life&quot; were remastered and reissued with bonus tracks on Rubellan Remasters.

<text>William Wynn Westcott (17 December 1848 – 30 July 1925) was a coroner, ceremonial magician, theosophist and Freemason born in Leamington, Warwickshire, England. He was a Supreme Magus (chief) of the S.R.I.A. and went on to co-found the Golden Dawn.

== Biography ==
He was a doctor of medicine.

In 1871 he became active in Freemasonry where he became Master of his home Lodge three years later and also the &quot;Quatuor Coronati&quot; research lodge (Master 1893–94).

In 1879 he moved to Hendon. In 1880 he began studying the Kabbalah and joined Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. In 1882 he met Samuel Liddell Mathers.

=== Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia ===
Westcott became chief of the SRIA with the death of William Robert Woodman.

=== The Golden Dawn ===
Wescott co-founded the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn with Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and William Robert Woodman in 1887, using the motto V.H. Frater Sapere Aude.

Around this time, he was also active in the Theosophical Society, where he founded in 1891 the Adelphi Lodge in London WC.

In 1896, he abandoned public involvement with the Golden Dawn due to pressure regarding his job as a Crown Coroner, with which it was seen as an unseemly association. He continued to head the S.R.I.A. and later was involved with the Golden Dawn breakaway Stella Matutina.

=== Later years ===
He retired as a coroner after 1910, emigrated to the Union of South Africa in 1918, and died in Durban in 1925.

<text>Fredrick Lawrence Grandy (born June 29, 1948) is an American actor who played &quot;Gopher&quot; on the TV series &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and who later became a member of the United States House of Representatives from the state of Iowa. Grandy was most recently the host of &quot;The Grandy Group&quot;, a morning drive time radio talk show on 630 WMAL in Washington, D.C.

==Early life==
Grandy was born in Sioux City, Iowa, the youngest of three sons of William Grandy, who worked in his father&#x27;s insurance business, and his wife, Bonnie. When Grandy was eleven, his father died of a heart attack. His mother died of an aneurysm a year later.

The young Grandy was then raised by Margaret Avery, his mother&#x27;s best friend (a widow who later married his father&#x27;s doctor). He went to public schools until ninth grade, after which he attended high school at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, as his father and brothers had done.

At Exeter, Grandy was the roommate of David Eisenhower, the grandson of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and was later best man at Eisenhower&#x27;s wedding to Julie Nixon, the daughter of then–president-elect Richard Nixon, in December 1968.

Grandy graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English studies from Harvard University in 1970. In 1971, he joined an improvisational group at Harvard called &quot;The Proposition&quot; and then rejoined the show when it moved off-Broadway in 1971. Among his co-stars was future &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; star Jane Curtin.

Although of service age, Grandy had a high lottery number and was not drafted for Vietnam.

==Acting career==
Grandy played purser Burl &quot;Gopher&quot; Smith on the American television series &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. The series aired for nine seasons (1977–1986). He also wrote several vignettes for the show. In 1982, while visiting Turkey to film scenes for the show, Grandy suffered severe burns when a balloon filled with hydrogen exploded.

Before gaining prominence on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, Grandy had guest roles on many shows, including &quot;Love, American Style&quot; (1969); &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; (1970); &quot;Maude&quot; (1973); &quot;Phyllis&quot; (1975); and &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; (1975). Grandy also acted in the 1973 made-for-TV movie &quot;The Girl Most Likely to...&quot;, as Ted Gates.

He starred in the Saturday morning TV series &quot;Monster Squad&quot; (1976) as Walt, a criminology student working as a night watchman at &quot;Fred&#x27;s Wax Museum&quot;. He also appeared in a number of &quot;Match Game&quot; episodes from 1979 to 1981. He usually sat in the male guest-star seat in the top row left. He also did one week&#x27;s worth of episodes on its sequel, the &quot;Match Game/Hollywood Squares Hour&quot;.

In May 2013 Grandy returned to the stage, starring in a production of &quot;Sleuth&quot; at the Surflight Theatre in Beach Haven, New Jersey. In 2014 Grandy had a recurring role on Season 3 of &quot;The Mindy Project&quot; for which his son, Charlie Grandy, is a writer. He portrayed Dr. William Ledreau. He has also had recurring roles in two TV series, &quot;Knight Squad&quot; and &quot;Sprung&quot;. He has also performed around the country in regional theatre productions of &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Rappaport&quot;, and &quot;Give &#x27;em Hell, Harry!&quot;.

Grandy holds a master of fine arts (MFA) degree from the Washington Shakespeare Theatre and George Washington University.

==Political career==
Grandy&#x27;s political interests preceded his acting career. Between 1970 and 1971, he served as a speechwriter for Wiley Mayne, the Republican congressman from his home district, .

With Mayne&#x27;s successor, Democrat Berkley Bedell, deciding not to run in 1986, Grandy, a Republican, campaigned for the open Iowa United States House of Representatives seat, beating Clayton Hodgson by two percentage points (51.0% to 49.0%).

Although Grandy tried to distance himself from his acting career (at the time), he said to &quot;People&quot; magazine that &quot;if there were no Gopher, there would be no Fred Grandy for Congress.&quot;

During his four terms in Congress, he served on a variety of committees, including Ways and Means, Agriculture, Standards of Official Conduct, and Education and the Workforce. While a member of Congress, Grandy won eight &quot;Watchdog of the Treasury&quot; awards.

In 1994, Grandy declined to run for another Congressional term and instead entered the Republican primary race for governor of Iowa against incumbent Terry Branstad, but lost the election by nearly four percentage points.

==Career as a radio commentator and other work==
Grandy served as president and CEO of Goodwill Industries International from 1995 to 2000. He later became a political commentator for National Public Radio and served as a visiting professor teaching a course on nonprofit organizations at the School of Public Affairs at the University of Maryland, College Park.

From 2003 to 2010, Grandy and radio veteran Andy Parks were the hosts of &quot;The Grandy &amp; Andy Morning Show&quot;, a conservative radio talk show on 630 WMAL in Washington, D.C. In May 2010, the program was reconfigured and was afterward called &quot;The Grandy Group.&quot; On March 3, 2011, Grandy resigned from the program allegedly over a dispute about his and his wife&#x27;s statements about Islamic extremism or low listenership.

Grandy was also the host of a show on Retirement Living TV called &quot;Daily Café&quot; (with MSNBC anchor Alex Witt). Since then he has been a Senior Fellow for National Security Affairs at the Washington-based Center for Security Policy, a far-right, anti-Muslim, Washington, D.C.–based think tank, developing and managing projects on domestic terrorism and counterintelligence.

==Personal life==
Grandy has been married twice. He married Jan Gough in 1969, a student at Radcliffe. They had a son, Charlie Grandy, and a daughter before divorcing in 1983. On March 28, 1987, Grandy married novelist Catherine Mann, whom he had met when she interviewed him as one of the first reporters for &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. They have one daughter (born 1989). In 1993, Grandy and his wife sporadically toured Iowa with a stage production of the play &quot;Love Letters&quot; for charity (especially children&#x27;s charities).

<doc id="415349" wikidata="Q5231464" url="?curid=415349" title="USS Whale (SS-239)">
<text>USS &quot;Whale&quot; (SS-239), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for a whale, an extremely large, aquatic mammal that is fishlike in form. The USS &quot;Cachalot&quot; (SS-170) (Cachalot, another name for a Sperm Whale) commissioned on 1 December 1933 preceded the Whale.

Her keel was laid down on 28 June 1941 by the Mare Island Naval Shipyard of Vallejo, California. She was launched on 14 March 1942 (sponsored by Mrs. A. D. Denny, wife of Captain A. D. Denny, the commanding officer of the shipyard), and commissioned on 1 June 1942, with Lieutenant Commander (Lt. Cmdr.) John B. Azer in command.

Dock trials and initial shakedown training commenced on 30 July. The submarine—escorted by destroyer —departed San Francisco, California, on 4 August and arrived at San Diego, California, two days later. Between 30 July and 9 September, she conducted type training in the San Diego and San Francisco areas.

==First war patrol, October – November 1942==
&quot;Whale&quot; got underway from San Francisco on 23 September and arrived at Pearl Harbor four days later. The submarine departed Hawaii on 9 October 1942, headed via Midway Island for &quot;Imperial Waters&quot; (the seas surrounding The Empire of Japan), and conducted training dives and battle surface drills &quot;en route&quot;. She arrived at her assigned patrol area off Kii Suido on 25 October and began to reconnoiter the vicinity which had been designated for a naval minefield. Her original plans had called for the submarine to lay mines offshore. However, after sighting several outbound freighters about from the coast, executive officer Frederick &quot;Fritz&quot; Harlfinger II (who later commanded ) convinced Azer that the mines be planted as close in as possible. Hence &quot;Whale&#x27;s&quot; first war patrol was conducted &quot;within spitting distance&quot; of the Japanese beach. &quot;Whale&quot; was the first American submarine to plant mines in Empire waters. During the war, no one on the American side knew how effective these mines proved to be, but a postwar analysis of Japanese shipping records credited &quot;Whale&#x27;s&quot; minefield with sinking five enemy ships.

The following day, &quot;Whale&quot; arrived at Seto Saki hoping to intercept some inbound freighter traffic. By the light of a full moon, she sighted a large freighter directly ahead and fired a three-torpedo spread at the target. Two torpedoes hit the cargo ship, and she went down by the bow with her screws in the air. &quot;Whale&quot; sighted a second target astern of the freighter, launched three torpedoes, and observed that target listing slightly to port and heading for the beach. &quot;Whale&quot; fired a stern shot at a third freighter and heard a heavy torpedo explosion after 43 seconds.

From 27 to 29 October, &quot;Whale&quot; patrolled the entrance to Bungo Suido. On 30 October, while off Ichie Saki, &quot;Whale&quot; spotted two freighters and a torpedo boat as escort; she launched two torpedoes at each of the ships, but scored only one hit. The torpedoes alerted the escort which bore down on the submarine and attacked her with depth charges. A 17-hour chase ensued in which &quot;Whale&quot; was badly damaged yet managed to shake the torpedo boat three times.

After an unsuccessful search for a disabled sampan, &quot;Whale&quot; made rendezvous with an escort and proceeded to Pearl Harbor where she underwent repairs from 10 November 1942 through 2 January 1943. The next day, &quot;Whale&quot; got underway from the Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor, bound for the Marshall Islands. After conducting training dives and drills en route, she arrived in the Wotje and Kwajalein area on 10 January for two days&#x27; patrol off those atolls.

==Second war patrol, January – February 1943==
On 13 January 1943, &quot;Whale&quot; began cruising the shipping lane from Kwajalein to Truk. She sighted a freighter and pursued her quarry for before finally managing to work into position dead ahead of the target. She then launched four torpedoes. The first hit struck the freighter aft and broke off about of the stern; the second struck just forward of the bridge, and the fourth also exploded on target. Within six minutes, 3,559 ton &quot;Iwashiro Maru&quot; had sunk about 40 nautical miles north of Kwajalein, 09°54&#x27;N, 167°07&#x27;E., and &quot;Whale&quot; resumed her voyage toward Truk, running submerged.

 &quot;Whale&quot; conducted surface patrols on the Truk-Empire shipping lanes until 17 January when she sighted a passenger/freighter bringing in troop reinforcements. Through the periscope, &quot;Whale&quot; observed hundreds of uniformed soldiers crowding the decks. She fired nine torpedoes and scored eight direct hits. All hits were necessary to sink the 9,816 ton &quot;Heiyo Maru&quot; north-east of Truk in position 10°13&#x27;N, 151°25&#x27;E.; the cargo must have been of such a nature as to prevent her from sinking more rapidly.

The next seven days were spent patrolling the Caroline Islands. On 25 January while on a surface patrol along the Truk–Empire line, &quot;Whale&quot; sighted smoke in the bright moonlight and fired a three-torpedo spread from the stern tubes at the target. Only one torpedo scored a hit. The damaged tanker, &quot;Syoyo Maru&quot;, sent up a flare which summoned an escort to her rescue. &quot;Whale&quot; went deep and sustained light damage from several depth charges.

The following evening, &quot;Whale&quot; sighted the smoke of a steamer about on her starboard bow. She closed and launched one torpedo. A dull thud was heard throughout the boat, and no explosion occurred. The next morning (27 January), the submarine fired a three torpedo spread at the steamer but heard no explosions. A fourth torpedo also failed to explode, and the target, transport &quot;Shoan Maru&quot; (5624 GRT) attacked in the central Pacific in position 14°24&#x27;N, 153°30&#x27;E.turned away from the submarine, presenting only her stern to view. &quot;Whale&quot; fired a fifth and sixth torpedo; the latter passed directly below the target&#x27;s stern and must have run under its full length without detonating. The Japanese ship then began dropping depth charges as she drew away. &quot;Whale&quot; fired her last remaining torpedo which hit the target just abaft her stack, causing her to lose power. Although &quot;Whale&quot; was credited with the kill, the Shoan Maru is towed to Saipan and grounded. After this action, &quot;Whale&quot; set her course for Midway, where she arrived 2 February 1943 and commenced preparations for her next patrol.

==Third war patrol, February – April 1943==
Refitting was completed on 16 February. Four days later, Lt. Cmdr. Azer was relieved of command by Lt. Cmdr. Albert C. Burrows. On the last day of the month, after various test dives and underway tests, &quot;Whale&quot; got underway for the Mariana Islands on her third war patrol. She arrived off Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, on 10 March and began patrolling the shipping lanes between the Mariana Islands and Japan.

On the evening of 19 March, &quot;Whale&quot; sighted two large freighters and one torpedo boat or destroyer as escort. Just after daylight the next morning, the submarine finally worked into a favorable attack position; she fired spreads of three torpedoes at each freighter, and hit both. The first target, tentatively identified as &quot;Mogamigawa Maru&quot;, sank rapidly by the stern. The second, a cargo ship resembling &quot;Arizona Maru&quot;, was plagued by several heavy internal explosions following a second torpedo hit. &quot;Whale&quot;, mistaking these secondary explosions for bombs, went deep. Upon discovering her mistake, she started to surface but was greeted by a barrage of depth charges from the escort. &quot;Whale&quot; dove again but again came under attack – this time from the air – when she attempted to return to examine the wreckage. The submarine suffered extensive damage during this attack, which prevented her learning the fate of her targets. This was by far &quot;Whale&quot;&#x27;s closest escape.

&quot;Whale&quot; continued to patrol shipping lanes to Kobe and Tokyo and, while off Tanapag Harbor on the evening of 22 March, she sighted the masts of two ships and the smoke of a third, all leaving the harbor. &quot;Whale&quot; tried to close but lost contact. The next morning, the submarine gained a position ahead of two freighters and fired two spreads of three torpedoes each. Two hits were observed on each target, one under each stack and a second under each stern. The closer freighter, &quot;Kenyo Maru&quot;, blew up with a tremendous explosion and sank in four minutes leaving no survivors. Part of the stern of the farther ship blew into the air, and she appeared to be sinking slowly by the stern as she signaled rapidly with a blinker light.

Fearing the approach of an escort, &quot;Whale&quot; fired a fourth torpedo which ran &quot;hot, straight and normal&quot; for one minute, then circled, heading back in the direction of &quot;Whale&quot;. &quot;We went to and prayed&quot;, the commanding officer later reported. The erratic torpedo changed its mind after reaching &quot;Whale&quot;&#x27;s beam and headed back for the freighter, finally exploding. The target was awash from stern to stack and on fire forward. At morning twilight, the ship was still burning with her bow up and her stern under.

The submarine spent the next two days patrolling the Kobe-Saipan, Empire-Truk shipping routes. On the morning of 25 March, she sighted the smoke of a small freighter and pursued it throughout the remainder of that day and the next, firing seven torpedoes at the target, all misses. Either the target&#x27;s draft had been overestimated or the torpedoes ran too deep, or both. This poor torpedo performance was bitterly disappointing to the submarine&#x27;s crew. &quot;The thought of the fuel expended,&quot; her commanding officer lamented, &quot;on the long, endaround runs, coupled with the loss of the torpedoes themselves, made &#x27;heartbreaking&#x27; but an inadequate euphemism.&quot;

On 28 March, &quot;Whale&quot; was on the surface, intending to cross the Saipan-Truk route, when she spotted the smoke of a small freighter headed for Truk. She fired a three torpedo spread; the target made an unanticipated zig, and all three torpedoes missed. A lack of fuel forced &quot;Whale&quot; to abandon her quarry, and she headed north along the Empire–Truk route.

&quot;Whale&quot; headed homeward on 31 March, and she arrived at Midway on 6 April. She refueled there, had her last torpedo removed, and sailed for Hawaii the following day, conducting daily training of gun crews and test dives for radio reception &quot;en route&quot;. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 11 April and underwent refitting, subsequent tests, and then training. &quot;Whale&quot; got underway westward again on 5 May and arrived at Midway four days later to undergo repairs to her hydraulic system and her air search radar. &quot;Whale&quot; departed Midway to begin her fourth war patrol on 10 May.

==Fourth war patrol, May – June 1943==
&quot;Whale&quot; was ordered to take station east of Wake Island at 05:00 on 16 May, to assist in guiding in the Army Air Corps B-24 Liberator bombers to that island for a bombing attack and to pick up the crews from any plane that was shot down or ditched. She arrived on 15 May and was ordered to remain on the surface until released by the Bombardment Group Commander or attacked by the enemy. &quot;Whale&quot; sat surfaced in broad daylight until 09:45 waiting for the bombing to commence. At that time, observers on the submarine saw a flight of seven Liberators heading for Wake, and the attack began. Radar picked up a contact at and coming in fast. As &quot;Whale&quot; submerged, a bomb exploded astern of the submarine, causing no damage. At 19:22, &quot;Whale&quot; received a message releasing her from duty, and she proceeded to the Saipan area.

From 20 – 24 May, &quot;Whale&quot; patrolled the shipping lanes between Japan, Truk, and Saipan. On the latter day, she conducted a search for a submarine base reportedly on Rota; finding nothing, she surfaced and headed for Guam.

The following day, &quot;Whale&quot; sighted the masts of three ships in the harbor at Apra, Guam, anchored in such a way as to be protected by reef islands. A retriever type sampan appeared to be the only antisubmarine measure. Waiting outside the harbor, &quot;Whale&quot; sighted and then tracked the 3,580 ton auxiliary gunboat &quot;Shoei Maru&quot;. At 00:14 on 26 May, &quot;Whale&quot; fired her first torpedo which hit with a blinding, orange flash midway between the stack and bow of the freighter. The explosion blew away the ship&#x27;s entire bow, and she sank in four minutes with no survivors. The vessel sank about 17 nautical miles north-northwest of Rota Island, Mariana Islands in position 14°17&#x27;N, 144°54&#x27;E.

On 5 June, &quot;Whale&quot; sighted the masts of a seaplane tender, and tracked and closed the target. The submarine launched four torpedoes, scoring three hits. The target&#x27;s screws stopped instantly, and powerful, rumbling explosions came from the target. However, the tender must have managed to limp to port since postwar study of Japanese records did not confirm a kill. An escort was &quot;running wild&quot; toward &quot;Whale&quot;, so she went deep and eluded her pursuer.

The submarine spent the next three days patrolling the Saipan area and, on 8 June, set a course for the Empire–Truk route through the Mariana Islands. The next day, she sighted the masts and kingposts of two large freighters about abeam of each other with an escort ahead of and between them. &quot;Whale&quot; launched three torpedoes at the first freighter, scoring two hits. She then shifted to the second freighter and fired the fourth, fifth, and sixth torpedoes. Tremendous explosions from the first ship were followed by two more explosions. The submarine commander concluded that one or more of the latter spread of torpedoes—aimed at the second freighter—hit the first, already damaged target. &quot;Whale&quot; fired another three-torpedo spread at the second freighter and soon heard two heavy explosions followed by a deep, rumbling detonation with the accompanying water noises which suggested that a ship was breaking up. &quot;Whale&quot; then headed eastward and touched at Midway on 17 June, before continuing on toward Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 June and commenced refitting.

==Fifth war patrol, July – September 1943==
After almost a month there, &quot;Whale&quot; returned to Midway, completed her refitting, and sailed for the Tokyo–Truk shipping lanes to begin her fifth war patrol. Stormy weather, heavy seas, and poor visibility persisted from 4–6 August. A wave washed over and covered the entire bridge structure, and large amounts of water flooded into the conning tower and down to the control room and the pump room. &quot;Whale&quot; headed southwest, to the east of the Bonin Islands. The continual pounding in heavy seas had cracked a number of battery jars, bringing the total of disabled cells to 10 forward and 13 aft.

On 7 August 1943, &quot;Whale&quot; covered the Tokyo-Truk lane east of the Bonins. The following day, &quot;Whale&quot;&#x27;s periscope watch sighted a large aircraft ferry and her escort. When everything was ready to fire a spread of bow shots, the forward gyro regulator failed, and it was necessary to shift to manual operation. After one torpedo hit, 7,148 ton &quot;Naruto Maru&quot; stopped dead in her tracks, listed to starboard and started going down slowly by the stern. &quot;Whale&quot; fired another torpedo which hit amidships and prodded the ship into sinking faster; the vessel sank northwest of the Mariana Islands in position 24°12&#x27;N, 142°52&#x27;E. Whale survived a counter-attack by the escorting Japanese destroyer Asanagi. The submarine escaped aircraft bombs and set course for the Tokyo-Truk route.

From 9–19 August, she patrolled the Tokyo-Truk route, the Bonin area, and the East China Sea where, on 20 August, she was caught in a typhoon. She weathered the three-day storm with her only severe problem being a low main storage battery. On 24 August, &quot;Whale&quot; positioned herself west of Kusakaki Shima and intercepted an enemy convoy headed for Nagasaki. &quot;Whale&quot; fired a salvo of four torpedoes and, other than hearing four explosions, did not manage to ascertain their effect. The ships were last seen going over the horizon, and pursuit was impractical due to the submarine&#x27;s proximity to Nagasaki and the condition of her battery.

&quot;Whale&quot; was en route to Midway when she sighted two large cargo ships and a destroyer escort. She fired a salvo of three torpedoes, followed by a fourth stern shot. All four shots missed, and &quot;Whale&quot; continued toward home, touching at Midway on 2 September and pushing on toward Hawaii the following day. &quot;Whale&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 7 September and commenced a major overhaul which lasted until 7 December.

==Sixth war patrol, December 1943 – February 1944==
&quot;Whale&quot; arrived at Midway on 25 December 1943 and departed for her sixth war patrol. For two weeks, &quot;Whale&quot; patrolled the Tokyo–Truk shipping lanes, Minami Shima, and the Mariana, Ryukyu, and Bonin Island areas. On 14 January 1944, she received a dispatch from submarine stating that a convoy was headed in &quot;Whale&#x27;s&quot; direction. &quot;Seawolf&quot; attacked the convoy the next day and sank a tanker, expending all of her torpedoes. &quot;Seawolf&quot; continued to trail the convoy, and &quot;Whale&quot; made radar contact on 16 January. &quot;Whale&quot; launched three torpedoes and sank the larger of the freighters, transport ship Denmark Maru (5869 GRT) about 400 nautical miles southeast of Okinawa in position 23°09&#x27;N, 135°14&#x27;E. However, she suffered minor damage from an ensuing barrage of depth charges. &quot;Seawolf&quot; verified the sinking and reported that the last freighter headed south alone. Since she lacked torpedoes, &quot;Seawolf&quot; unsuccessfully tried to engage the freighter with gunfire. But she assisted by driving the freighter in &quot;Whale&#x27;s&quot; direction and by passing along the target&#x27;s zig zag plan and speed. &quot;Whale&quot; fired four straight bow shots with one hit observed between the bow and stack. Four other explosions were heard and assumed to be either internal explosions or the torpedoes. The target seemed undamaged except for a slight trim down by the bow, and it was imperative that the ship be sunk expeditiously in order to avoid further depth charges by the escorts. &quot;Whale&quot; fired another stern shot which hit squarely under the stack, and the target, &quot;Tarushima Maru&quot;,(4865 GRT, torpedoed earlier that day by USS Seawolf) in position 22°50&#x27;N, 135°40&#x27;E. started down by the bow while &quot;Whale&quot; filmed her sinking. However, a postwar analysis of Japanese losses does not credit &quot;Whale&quot; with this kill.

&quot;Whale&quot; patrolled the Marianas and the Bonins from 18 to 23 January. On 24 January, she made contact with an enemy submarine and attempted an end-around, but her maneuver was thwarted by a fire in the trim pump which filled the control room with smoke, forcing &quot;Whale&quot; to surface. Two days later &quot;Whale&quot;—low on fuel—headed for Midway, arriving on 3 February for refitting. Lt. Cmdr. James B. Grady relieved Burrows as commanding officer on 9 February. A casualty to the starboard propeller necessitated a trip to Pearl Harbor, and it was not until 13 March that &quot;Whale&quot; returned to Midway, the staging port for her seventh patrol.

==Seventh war patrol, March – May 1944==
The next day, &quot;Whale&quot; got underway for a rendezvous point where she joined submarine on 23 March and patrolled along a likely shipping route east of Tori Shima and the Bonins. On 25 March, &quot;Whale&quot; changed course, passed between Tokara Shima, entered the East China Sea on 29 March, and conducted patrols off the western coast of Kyūshū, including Quelpart Island and Iki Shima. On 8 April, she torpedoed an unescorted freighter, &quot;Honan Maru&quot;(5401 GRT) off the north-western coast of Kyushu in position 33°45&#x27;N, 128°42&#x27;E which exploded and sank within 15 seconds. Nine days later, &quot;Whale&quot; made contact with two small destroyers or torpedo boats but was unable to close. She headed toward Nagasaki and patrolled uneventfully until 23 April when she was detected by a patrol boat east of Asuseki Shima. &quot;Whale&quot; &quot;turned tail at high speed and soon lost contact.&quot; She proceeded toward the Bonin Islands and made rendezvous with destroyer escort on 2 May. The following day, she entered Majuro for refitting and a three-day training period.

==Eighth war patrol, May – July 1944==
Again ready for sea, &quot;Whale&quot; (with destroyer as escort) departed Majuro on 28 May for her eighth war patrol. She released the destroyer the following day and proceeded to the Japanese home islands. On 7 June, she made contact with a convoy traveling in two parallel columns: four freighters in the starboard column and two in the port. They were screened by three escorts. &quot;Whale&quot; chose the largest ship, a transport of about 10,000 tons, as her first target. She fired a three-torpedo spread, then shifted to a second freighter and fired another three-torpedo spread. A hit under the stack of the first target was followed by two timed hits on the second target. The two vessels sank were the Japanese transport Shinroku Maru (2857 GRT) and damaged the Japanese transport Sugiyama Maru (4379 GRT) north-northeast of the Bonin Islands in position 31°06&#x27;N, 142°34&#x27;E. Immediately, depth charges began to drop, &quot;Whale&quot; cleared the area to the southeast and later received a report of a crippled freighter in tow north of her.

From 12 June to 4 July 1944, &quot;Whale&quot; patrolled off the southern coasts of Japan. She sighted several Japanese aircraft and a properly lighted hospital ship. On 5 July, &quot;Whale&quot; surfaced and set course for Midway where she arrived on 11 July. She pushed on toward Hawaii the following day and arrived at Pearl Harbor after a four-day passage. An extensive refitting lasted until 12 August and was followed by training exercises.

==Ninth war patrol, August – October 1944==
&quot;Whale&quot; got underway on 24 August for her ninth patrol. Shortly before, Admiral William &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey had requested a sizable force of submarines to form a reconnaissance line between the western Caroline Islands and the Philippine Islands to act as offensive scouts during Operation &quot;Stalemate&quot;, the invasion of the Palau Islands. This flotilla, nicknamed the &quot;Zoo&quot;, consisted of nine submarines organized into three &quot;wolfpacks&quot; under the overall command of Captain Charles W. (&quot;Weary&quot;) Wilkins in submarine . &quot;Whale&quot; and joined Wilkins&#x27; own pack, which was known as the &quot;Bears.&quot;

&quot;Whale&quot; arrived at Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, on 3 September and the next day got underway in company with the other &quot;Bears&quot; and coastal minesweeper which acted as their escort. She proceeded to a rendezvous with on 8 September about from Samar Island, Philippines. She spent the next eight days making emergency repairs and conducting training dives, patrolling on station, and submerging to avoid detection by unidentified aircraft.

On 17 September, the position of the &quot;Bear Pit&quot; was changed to the southeast of Formosa, and &quot;Whale&quot; arrived on station on 20 September. Four days later, she received orders to disband and proceed as a coordinated attack group of four submarines called the &quot;Bears&quot; to &quot;Convoy College&quot;, the north end of the South China Sea, between Luzon, Formosa, and China. She entered those strategic waters on 25 September and, the following day, she surfaced in Bashi Channel, from Y&#x27;Ami Island of the Batan Islands, and proceeded to her patrol station south of Garan Bi, Formosa. On 27 September, &quot;Whale&quot; evaded a small patrol craft and the next day submerged for a periscope patrol south of Formosa. On 29 September, she made rendezvous with &quot;Seahorse&quot;, received written instructions for conducting the remainder of the patrol; and set her course for a new station southwest of Formosa. The submarine arrived on station on 3 October and submerged some north of Cape Borjeador, Luzon, and patrolled around Calayan and Dalupiri islands in the Babuyan group.

&quot;Wilkins&#x27; Bears&quot; searched the Luzon Strait on 6 October and found a convoy of at least nine ships. Using a high periscope, &quot;Whale&quot; could see two large tankers, a large tender, and two &quot;Hibiki&quot;-class destroyers patrolling ahead of the tanker. &quot;Whale&quot; fired six bow tube shots at the tanker, then submerged quickly to avoid detection. The escorts dropped 34 depth charges, none of which was uncomfortably close. The sinking vessel was the Japanese tanker Akane Maru (10241 GRT) west of the Balintang Channel, North-North-West of Luzon in position 19°40&#x27;N, 118°05&#x27;E.Meanwhile, &quot;Seahorse&quot; verified the sinking of &quot;Whale&quot;&#x27;s target, &quot;Akane Maru&quot;, and herself sank a destroyer that was picking up survivors from the tanker.

The next day, &quot;Whale&quot; received a message extending her patrol for seven days and ordering her to rendezvous with submarines and in the area northwest of Luzon on 9 and 10 October, respectively. &quot;Whale&quot; was harassed by plane contacts throughout the daylight hours of 16 October and she ordered to take a new station at the southwest end of Ryukyu Shoto in anticipation of a Japanese fleet sortie which never occurred. Three days later, &quot;Whale&quot; was ordered to head for Midway for refitting; she arrived there on 29 October.

==Tenth war patrol, November 1944 – January 1945==
&quot;Whale&quot; got underway on 21 November for her tenth war patrol. She reached the Ryukyus on 4 December and operated off those islands through the end of the year. On 22 December, she sighted eight twin engine planes and three trawlers. She launched four torpedoes at the trawlers without scoring a hit and then cleared the area. The following day, while submerged southeast of Nakano Jima, &quot;Whale&quot; sighted four trawlers. She went to gun-action stations and fired at the ships using four-inch (102 mm) and .50-caliber guns. None of the fishing vessels fought back, and all were sunk within 80 minutes.

On 4 and 5 January 1945, &quot;Whale&quot; and sister ship searched unsuccessfully in the waters near Sufu Gan for a life raft containing 11 survivors of a downed B-29 Superfortress. There were heavy seas and visibility was only , and the B-29 did not answer calls on the lifeguard frequency. That lack of communication greatly hampered the rescue operation. On 6 January, &quot;Whale&quot; received orders to proceed via Midway to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 15 January. She soon pushed on to the west coast and entered the Mare Island Navy Yard on 26 January 1945 for an overhaul.

==Eleventh war patrol, June – August 1945==
After she returned to Pearl Harbor via San Francisco, California, it was discovered that the submarine&#x27;s hydraulic plant required an overhaul. This delayed departure on patrol for one month. Meanwhile, Lt. Cmdr. Freeland H. Carde, Jr., relieved Commander (Cmdr.) James B. Grady. On 15 June, fully loaded with provisions and torpedoes, &quot;Whale&quot; commenced her 11th war patrol. En route to the Marianas, &quot;Whale&quot; conducted training drills – emphasizing evasive dives from aircraft – and battle surface drills. She arrived at Saipan on 21 June and, the next day, commenced patrolling across the Japan–Wake Island supply lines until 30 June when she headed for Guam. She arrived there on 6 July and got underway the following day for lifeguard duty. From 8–23 July, &quot;Whale&quot; conducted lifeguard patrols in the areas of Nanpō Islands, Marianas, and Bungo Suido. &quot;Whale&quot; sighted several American B-29 Superfortress and B-24 Liberator bombers overhead. She also encountered a few freighters afloat but could not get in position to attack. On occasion at night, she spotted Japanese planes that were searching the water for lights. During this period, &quot;Whale&quot; rescued 15 downed aviators, saving several under adverse conditions. For example, on 26 July, while going in close for a rescue, &quot;Whale&quot; sighted 43 floating naval mines in 20 minutes, many close aboard. As a result of this lifeguard duty, &quot;Whale&quot; discovered many flaws in the air-sea rescue doctrine and made several noteworthy recommendations to improve future operations.

&quot;Whale&quot; commenced patrol east of Okino Shima on 30 July and ran into heavy seas: &quot;Couldn&#x27;t hold our own with this current, so took soundings each half hour.&quot; On 4 August, she submerged for patrol off Bungo Suido and, four days later, made rendezvous with submarine to take on board a rescued pilot. On 9 August, &quot;Whale&quot; received 16 aviators and one patient who were transferred from submarine , using a rubber boat with lines on bow and stern for propulsion. On 11 August, &quot;Whale&quot; received orders to proceed to Saipan for fuel and to Midway for refitting. She arrived at Saipan on 14 August. The next day, President of the United States Harry S. Truman announced the final Japanese capitulation. &quot;Whale&quot; sailed in company with submarine for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 25 August 1945.

==Post-war operations, August 1945–1960==
&quot;Whale&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 30 August, bound for the Panama Canal, and arrived there on 14 September. After a three-day stay, &quot;Whale&quot; sailed for New York City and arrived at Tompkinsville, Staten Island, on 23 September. In October, she moved north via Newport, Rhode Island, and entered Boston, Massachusetts, harbor on 23 September for the Navy Day celebration. She arrived at New London, Conn., on 30 October 1945 to prepare for inactivation.

&quot;Whale&quot; was decommissioned in January 1947, berthed in New London, Connecticut, and placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was towed to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she arrived on 8 April 1948. &quot;Whale&quot; made several visits to Portsmouth and New London during the summer, and she finally came to rest at New London on 11 September 1948. The submarine was partially activated from 14 November to 14 December 1956 in order to replace submarine . &quot;Whale&quot; departed New London on 12 January 1957 and, on 22 January, arrived at New Orleans, Louisiana, where she was recommissioned upon arrival.

&quot;Whale&quot; was decommissioned for the last time in September 1957 and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1960. While at New Orleans, she was sold for scrap on 29 September 1960.

&quot;Whale&quot; earned 11 battle stars during World War II, sinking 57,716 tons of Japanese shipping.

<doc id="415350" wikidata="Q964949" url="?curid=415350" title="River Dee, Aberdeenshire">
<text>The River Dee () is a river in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It rises in the Cairngorms and flows through southern Aberdeenshire to reach the North Sea at Aberdeen. The area it passes through is known as Deeside, or Royal Deeside in the region between Braemar and Banchory because Queen Victoria came for a visit there in 1848 and greatly enjoyed herself. She and her husband, Prince Albert, built Balmoral Castle there which replaced an older castle.

Deeside is a popular area for tourists, due to the combination of its scenery and historic royal associations. It is part of the Cairngorms National Park, and the Deeside and Lochnagar [[national scenic area (Scotland)|National Scenic Area]]. The Dee is popular with anglers and is one of the most famous salmon fishing rivers in the world.

The New Statistical Account of Scotland attributed the name Dee as having been used as early as the second century AD in the work of the Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy, as &quot;Δηοῦα&quot; (=Deva), meaning &#x27;goddess&#x27;. This indicated the river had divine status in the beliefs of the ancient inhabitants of the area. There are several other rivers with the same name in Great Britain, and they are believed to have similar derivations, as may the Dee&#x27;s near neighbour to the north which is the River Don.

==Geography==
=== Upper reaches ===

The River Dee rises from a spring on the Braeriach plateau in the Cairngorm Mountains at a height of at about 1,220 m, the highest source of any major river in the British Isles. Emerging in a number of pools called the Wells of Dee the young Dee then flows across the plateau to the cliff edge from where the Falls of Dee plunge into An Garbh Choire (&quot;burn of the rough corrie&quot;). The river is then joined by a tributary coming from the Pools of Dee in the Lairig Ghru, and flows south down the Lairig Ghru between Ben Macdui and Cairn Toul, tumbling over falls in the Chest of Dee on its way to White Bridge and the confluence with the Geldie Burn, at which point it turns east.

===Linn of Dee===

At Linn of Dee the river passes east through a 300-metre natural rock gorge, a spot much favoured by Queen Victoria during her stays at Balmoral. The queen opened the bridge which spans the Dee at this point in 1857. Between Linn of Dee and Braemar the Lui Water (formed by the Luibeg and Derry burns) and the Quoich Water join the growing River Dee. The River Clunie enters the Dee at Braemar. Evidence of human activity stretching as far back as BC has been found at a complex of sites stretching along the banks of the Dee.

===Strathdee===
Through Deeside the river passes Braemar, Balmoral Castle, Ballater, Dinnet, Aboyne, and Banchory reaching the sea at Aberdeen. Near Ballater two rivers are tributaries: the River Gairn flowing from the north and the River Muick which flows out of Loch Muick, from the south. The river is within the Cairngorms National Park until it reaches Dinnet. The Water of Tanar flows through Glen Tanar before joining at Aboyne. The Water of Feugh has its confluence with the Dee near the Falls of Feugh at Banchory and Coy Burn enters at Milton of Crathes.

The tidal limit is just above Bridge of Dee which was built about 1720; it carries the main A90 trunk road from Aberdeen to the south. Before reaching the North Sea, the river passes through Aberdeen Harbour, the principal marine centre for the energy industry in Europe, servicing the offshore oil and gas industry. An artificial channel was constructed in 1872 to straighten the river&#x27;s flow into the sea. Footdee (&quot;Fittie&quot;) is an old fishing village at the east end of Aberdeen Harbour.
==Nature and conservation==
The Dee is important for nature conservation and the area has many designated sites. The upper catchment down to Inverey is within the Mar Lodge Estate, which is owned by the National Trust for Scotland and has been classified as a national nature reserve since May 2017.

The Cairngorms National Park which was established in 2003 covers the whole of the catchment of the Dee, including the tributaries, down to as far as Dinnet. As well as being included as part of the Cairngorms National Park, the Deeside area along with the mountains surrounding Lochnagar as far south as the head of Glen Doll is classified as the &quot;Deeside and Lochnagar National Scenic Area&quot;. It is one of 40 areas in Scotland designated as a scenic area. The &quot;Deeside and Lochnagar National Scenic Area&quot; covers 40,000 ha, extending from the Geldie down to Ballater.

The entire length of the Dee is defined as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) due to its importance to salmon, otters and freshwater pearl mussels. Other SACs within the Deeside area include Glen Tanar, the Muir of Dinnet, Ballochbuie, and the Morrone Birkwood. The southern side of Deeside is classified as a Special Protection Area, due to the area&#x27;s importance to golden eagles.

Much of the semi-natural Caledonian pine forest in Scotland is within the Dee catchment. The area contains nationally rare examples of pine woods, birch woods and heather moors with associated wildlife. On the valley floor there are deciduous alder and mixed broadleaved woods as well as meadow grasslands.

The Dee is a popular salmon river and has a succession of varied pools which are intersected by sharp rapids. In 1995 it was estimated that salmon fishing on the river contributed between £5 and £6 million a year to the Grampian Region economy. In 2020 it was estimated that salmon fishing contributed £15 million a year to the local economy and the River Dee reporting 10% of Scottish salmon catches. The River Dee operates a catch and release practise and all salmon which are caught must be released back to the river.

==Transport on Deeside==
The A93 road runs west along the north bank of the river from Aberdeen to Braemar before it turns south, leaving Deeside, to climb to the Glenshee Ski Centre at Cairnwell Pass and then onwards to Perth. Just west of Ballater the A939 Lecht Road leaves the A93 to take a tortuous climb towards the Lecht Ski Centre then on to Tomintoul and eventually Nairn. Beyond Braemar a narrow road continues along the south side of the Dee as far as Linn of Dee, at which point it doubles back to terminate at Linn of Quioch on the north bank of the Dee. There are no paved roads into the Cairngorms beyond Linn of Dee, although two walking routes, the Lairig Ghru and the Lairig an Laoigh, continue via passes in the mountains to reach Speyside.

Until 1966 the Deeside Railway ran from Aberdeen to Ballater, operated by the Great North of Scotland Railway. The line opened from Aberdeen to Banchory in 1853, was extended to Aboyne in 1859, and a further extension to Ballater was opened in 1866. The line was not extended beyond Ballater to Braemar as this would require it to run close to Balmoral, leading to objections from Queen Victoria.

The Royal Family used Ballater Station when visiting Balmoral. After the line closed, the station was converted into a rail museum. It was destroyed by fire in 2015 and has since been restored, now providing a tourist information centre, restaurant, tearoom and public library. A very short section of the line near Milton of Crathes has been restored as a heritage railway, named the Royal Deeside Railway.

==Royal Deeside==
Since the reign of Queen Victoria the British Royal Family have spent their summers at Balmoral Castle. Each year they attend the Braemar Highland Gathering and other local events. Birkhall which was previously owned by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, is now a favourite retreat of King Charles. Due to these royal connections, the area around Braemar and Ballater is sometimes referred to &quot;Royal Deeside&quot;, and this usage has been encouraged by the tourist trade.

<doc id="415357" wikidata="Q1757473" url="?curid=415357" title="Lytham St Annes">
<text>Lytham St Annes () is a seaside town in the Borough of Fylde in Lancashire, England. It is on the Fylde coast, directly south of Blackpool on the Ribble Estuary. The population of the built-up area at the 2021 census was 42,695. The town is made up of the four areas of Lytham, Ansdell, Fairhaven and St Annes-on-the-Sea.

Lytham is the older settlement, and the parish of Lytham used to cover the whole area. St Annes was founded as a new seaside resort in the 1870s on open land at the western end of the parish. From 1878 the two towns were administered separately (with Fairhaven and Ansdell being part of Lytham). They were reunited in 1922 under the compound name &quot;Lytham St Annes&quot;. A civil parish called &quot;Saint Anne&#x27;s on the Sea&quot; was created in 2005 just covering the western part of the built-up area.

Lytham St Annes has four golf courses and links, the most notable being the Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club, which regularly hosts the Open Championship.

Lytham St Annes is a reasonably affluent area with residents&#x27; earnings among the highest in the North of England.

==Towns and districts==
Lytham St Annes consists of four main areas: Lytham, Saint Annes-on-the-Sea, Ansdell and Fairhaven.

=== Lytham ===
The name Lytham comes from the Old English &quot;hlithum,&quot; plural of &quot;hlith&quot; meaning &quot;&#x27;(place at) the slopes&#x27;.&quot;

The Green, a strip of grass running between the shore and the main coastal road, is a notable Lytham landmark—the restored Windmill and Old Lifeboat House Museum are here. The Green overlooks the estuary of the River Ribble and the Welsh mountains. The centre of Lytham contains many notable buildings, such as the former Lytham public library, Lytham railway station, market hall, the Clifton Arms Hotel and Lytham Methodist Church.

Until the middle of the 20th century, the Clifton family was the leading family in Lytham and two of the town&#x27;s main thoroughfares are named in their honour, with the main shopping street being named Clifton Street and one of two roads to Blackpool being Clifton Drive. Their estate on the outskirts of Lytham and Ansdell originally occupied a large area. Lytham Hall, the family seat, remained in the family&#x27;s ownership until 1963, after which time it was passed on to Guardian Royal Exchange Insurance, and then to Lytham Town Trust in 1997. The grounds of the Hall are open during the week and on Sunday and events are organised, such as open-air plays and car shows. Several of the ornate gates to the estate and much of the distinctive pebble-bricked boundary wall survive. The parish church for Lytham is St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church, on Church Road.

Lytham is the location of the Foulnaze cockle fishery. The fishery has only opened the cockle beds on the Lancashire coast three times in twenty years, most recently in August 2013.

Lytham Library closed in September 2016 as part of Lancashire County Council budget cuts.

===St Annes===

St Annes-on-the-Sea (also known as St Annes-on-Sea or St Annes) was a 19th-century planned town. St Anne&#x27;s Church was built as a chapel of ease in 1873, in which year St Annes-on-the-Sea railway station also opened. An official founding ceremony for the town was held on 31 March 1875, when the cornerstone of the St Anne&#x27;s Hotel was laid. The town was developed from 1875 after Thomas Fair, agent to the Clifton Estate, sold leases to the St Anne&#x27;s on the Sea Land and Building Company. Plans for the town were laid out by the Bury firm of architects Maxwell and Tuke who later went on to construct Blackpool Tower. There was an open-air seawater swimming pool from 1916 until the mid-1980s.

St Annes is the original home of Premium Bonds and their prize-selecting computer &quot;ERNIE&quot;, which were on a site between Shepherd Road and Heyhouses Lane. Premium Bonds operated from there for more than 40 years before moving to Blackpool. The shopping area declined towards the end of the 20th century and was redeveloped in an attempt to attract more retailers and shoppers. As part of this project, a restaurant quarter was established, centred around Wood Street. The work included a £2m restoration of Ashton Gardens, a park near the town centre, in 2009.

The beach to the north of St Anne&#x27;s Pier was an internationally renowned sand yachting venue for many years, but this activity has been suspended since 2002 when a visitor to the beach died after being hit by a sand yacht. St Annes Beach hosts a number of kite flying events each year. In 2006 kite enthusiasts raised concerns about the future of these activities following a decision by Fylde Borough Council in 2006 to ban the flying of kites with two or more lines anywhere in the Fylde. Following representations from kite-fliers and completion of a risk assessment, the council rescinded the ban on condition that kite fliers remain at least 50m from the sand dunes.

A memorial statue of a lifeboatman looking out to sea was placed on the promenade at St Anne&#x27;s after the Mexico Disaster of 1886. The original lifeboat station was established in 1881 but closed in 1925 due to silting of the channel (a secondary channel of the Ribble that ran past the pier). A lifeboat continued to operate from Lytham, but the main channel of the river also became silted up, so the lifeboat was moved to a new all-weather RNLI base a few hundred yards south of St Annes pier which opened in 2000. St Annes-on-the-Sea Carnegie Library is just outside the town centre in an Edwardian, Carnegie-funded building.

There is some confusion, even among residents of the town, about whether the correct name is &quot;St Annes&quot; or &quot;St Anne&#x27;s&quot;. The apostrophe has been dropped from the name by many residents and has long been absent in many formal uses, such as the &quot;Lytham St Annes Express&quot; newspaper, St Annes Parish Church, and Lytham St Annes High School, although the spelling St. Anne&#x27;s is still sometimes used. The area takes its name from St Annes Parish Church.

In October 2008, a bronze statue by sculptor Graham Ibbeson of comedian Les Dawson, who lived in the town, was unveiled by Dawson&#x27;s widow and daughter in the ornamental gardens next to St Annes Pier. Entertainer George Formby also lived in the town, and there is a plaque outside the house where he lived from 1953 until his death in 1961.

===Ansdell===
Ansdell is a small district between Lytham and St Annes, on the landward side of the railway line. It has its own railway station (shared with Fairhaven), the Ansdell Institute club and a public library. It is named for Richard Ansdell (1815–1885), an artist who lived in the area and painted numerous oils depicting hunting scenes. Ansdell enjoys the distinction of being the only place in England to be named after an artist.

Ansdell hosts the largest school in Lancashire, Lytham St Annes High School, with around 1,500 students. Ansdell also encompasses the southern end of Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club. Ansdell is also the home of Fylde Rugby Club (FRC), established in May 1920, later to be closed during the war effort, and re-opened in 1946. FRC has reared many eminent players, notably Malcolm Phillips (a former President of the club) and Bill Beaumont.

===Fairhaven===
Fairhaven is the district between Lytham and St Annes on the coastal side of the railway. It has been suggested it is named after Thomas Fair, the land agent for the Clifton estate. It is believed by other researchers that Thomas Riley named his Master Plan for Fairhaven after the Bible passage Acts 27 verse 8 referring to Paul&#x27;s journey to Rome; many of the road names are connected to Paul and his journey.

Its main claim to fame is an artificial lake, known as Fairhaven Lake. In 1923 the new borough of Lytham St Annes was formed and subsequently purchased the lake with money quietly donated by Lord Ashton. In recognition of this, after extensive landscaping designed by T H Mawson, the lake was formally re-opened in 1926 and named Ashton Marine Park. After continuing confusion with Ashton Park in St Annes, in 1974 the name reverted to Fairhaven Lake. It is an important wildfowl habitat.

Its other famous landmark is the Fairhaven United Reformed Church, which is of unusual design, being built in Byzantine style and faced with glazed white tiles, and commonly known as the White Church. Fairhaven contains the former King Edward VII and Queen Mary School, which has now merged with Arnold School of Blackpool to become AKS Lytham.

The sands and tidal mudflats of the area (the mouth of the River Ribble) are an important feeding area for wintering waders. The RSPB operate a visitor centre from Fairhaven Lake to provide information and guided walks. The lake has been flooded by the sea in the distant past but is now protected by a substantial sea defence wall.

Fairhaven occupies an area of former sand dunes previously known as Starr Hills, which extended as far as St Annes town centre along the southern side of the railway. The name Starr Hills is still used for a residential home named after the eponymous residence constructed in the 1860s for Richard Ansdell, which was transformed into a hospital during World War I, before assuming its present use. The Fairhaven Estate was first laid out in 1892. Beginning in 1895, the estate was divided into parcels of land which could be purchased or leased for residential development.

==History==

The area is known to have been populated during the Bronze Age, and scattered hamlets have existed there ever since, including a village called Kilgrimol or Kilgrimhow, which is believed to have been founded in around 900 AD by Vikings expelled from Dublin. The area including the Fylde was known in Anglo-Saxon and medieval times as Amounderness. Lytham is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Lidun. In 1199 Richard Fitzroger gave his Lytham estates (then known as Lethun) to the Benedictine monks of Durham. The monks established a priory (although it was really too small to be called that as it comprised three or four monks only) on the site of the present Lytham Hall. The priory existed until 1539; in 1540 the monastery at Durham was dissolved and the Crown became Lord of the Manor.

The manor of Lytham passed through several owners until in 1606 it was sold to Cuthbert Clifton for £4,300. Clifton enlarged the manor house and made it the family seat. The house was replaced in 1757 with the present Lytham Hall, designed by architect John Carr of York. At this time St Annes did not exist, but Lytham was large enough to be called a town, with its own promenade and a reputation as a resort.

Northwards along the coast from Lytham, within the Clifton estates, were mostly sand dunes. The only habitations were the tiny hamlet of Heyhouses and the rural Trawl Boat Inn (a name resurrected in recent times for a public house in Wood Street in St Annes, opened by Wetherspoons). In 1873 the Cliftons built a Chapel of Ease dedicated to St Anne in this area, to encourage better religious observance, as most inhabitants found the long journey to St Cuthbert&#x27;s in Lytham too onerous. This became the parish church of St. Anne&#x27;s. At the time it was built the church had no tower. On 14 October 1874 the St Anne&#x27;s-on-the-Sea Land and Building Company Ltd was registered, mainly at the instigation of Elijah Hargreaves, a wealthy Lancashire mill owner from Rawtenstall whose intention was to develop the area as a resort. The land of St Annes was leased from the Clifton estate for 999 years, although the lease still gave the Cliftons the right to kill game on the land for this period. Building rapidly commenced with the St Anne&#x27;s Hotel (built in 1875, since demolished), the Hydro Terrace, which later became St Annes Square, and the railway station being among the first buildings. A separate company was formed to finance the construction of the pier, which was opened on 15 June 1885. At that time the main channel of the River Ribble ran by the end of the pier, and boats would bring people in from Lytham and Southport. The Ribble Navigation Act of 1883, which came into force in 1889, was intended to stabilise the often silted River Ribble to allow a steady trade into Preston docks. However, this work moved the main channel much further out and left St Annes Pier on flat sandbanks, where no ships could dock. In June 1910 the Floral Hall was opened at the end of the pier. It was a popular attraction and stars including Gracie Fields, Leslie Henson and Claude Hulbert performed there. Lytham and St Annes were consolidated in 1922. In 1974 a major fire seriously damaged the hall. It was restored to some extent, it ended up being used as a skatepark (skateboards) before another fire in July 1982 destroyed it. About half the pier was then demolished to make the beach safe to use.

The Lytham St Annes Civic Society operates a local blue plaque scheme. These commemorate historic buildings and residents, including Sir John Alcock and George Formby.

The 2012 Olympic torch relay passed through St Annes, Fairhaven and then Lytham before continuing onto nearby Warton and Freckleton.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering all of Lytham St Annes, at district and county level: Fylde Borough Council and Lancashire County Council. Fylde Borough Council has its headquarters at Lytham St Annes Town Hall on South Promenade in St Annes.

St Annes has a third tier of local government, a civil parish formally called Saint Anne&#x27;s on the Sea, which covers the western part of Lytham St Annes the built-up area. The parish council has elected to style itself St Anne&#x27;s on the Sea Town Council. The town council is based at West Lodge in Ashton Gardens on St George&#x27;s Road. The remainder of Lytham St Annes is an unparished area.

=== History of local government ===

Lytham had anciently been a chapelry in the parish of Kirkham, but became a separate parish in the Middle Ages. The ancient parish covered most of the area of the modern Lytham St Annes. Improvement commissioners were established in 1847 to govern the eastern part of the parish, including the settlement of Lytham itself. The ancient parish of Lytham became a civil parish in 1866, but in 1878 St Annes was made a Local board of health district, called &quot;Saint Anne&#x27;s-on-the-Sea&quot;. Both the Lytham commissioners&#x27; district and the St Anne&#x27;s local board of health district were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894, at which point St Annes was created a separate civil parish.

St Anne&#x27;s-on-the-Sea Urban District Council built itself St Anne&#x27;s Public Offices in Clifton Drive in 1902 to serve as its headquarters. In 1922 the two urban districts merged to form a municipal borough and civil parish called Lytham St Annes, and the civil parishes of Lytham and St Annes on the Sea were abolished. 

Since the re-organisation of local government in 1974, the town has been administered by Fylde District Council. In 2005 St Annes on the Sea was made a new civil parish, covering roughly the area of the civil parish which existed from 1894 to 1924.

==Transport==

===Disability access===
Lytham town centre has limited disabled parking. There are other car parks outside the immediate town centre however these may be too far away for those with restricted mobility.

===Railway===
Lytham station, St Annes-on-the-Sea station and Ansdell &amp; Fairhaven station all lie on the single-track Blackpool South to Preston branch of the Blackpool Branch Lines. Prior to the closure of Blackpool Central in 1964 the Coast Road, as it was known, was the mainline into Blackpool, although the Lytham St. Annes stations were bypassed by the direct line from Kirkham to Blackpool North. It has been reported that Central station in Blackpool could handle with ease one million people, in and out, in one day. 

Today the line is truncated at South station and the branch is operated euphemistically as &quot;one engine in steam&quot; but in fact is just a long siding from Kirkham. Trains run between Colne railway station and Blackpool South railway station on this line through Lytham St. Anne&#x27;s.

Previously there were stations in Station Road, Lytham (1846–1874) and at near the Old Links Golf Course, St Annes (1913–1949).

==Local issues==

===Lowther Pavilion Lytham===
In 2008 local residents became aware that Fylde Borough Council was struggling financially, and in particular was becoming unable to subsidise local amenities. The closure of St. Annes swimming pool demonstrated how serious the situation was. It was felt that a group needed to take immediate action if they wished to reduce the subsidy from the council and ensure that Lowther Pavilion, the only purpose-built theatre in the area, remained open. In November 2008 Friends of Lowther Pavilion was formed, with the stated purposes of reducing the subsidy required from the council; securing the future of Lowther Pavilion, raising money for improvements, and ultimately generate profits; involving the local community in the running of the theatre and making it part of the town; and becoming the basis of a networking forum for the participating groups.

===Closure of public facilities===

In 2008 Fylde Borough Council announced that the borough&#x27;s two public swimming pools, in Kirkham and St Annes, would be closed. Public campaigns were started to oppose both closures, and they reopened in 2010 under management by Fylde Coast YMCA, with financial support from the council.

===Property developments===
 the most controversial political issue in Lytham St Annes concerned property development. No more greenfield sites were available and developers were seeking to replace existing buildings or to build on open spaces such as Ashton Gardens in St Annes. Many historic buildings had been demolished and replaced with larger modern constructions of standard design as can be found in many other places. For example, the art deco former headquarters of the Football League was demolished and replaced with a block of flats.

In 2005 a property development company submitted a proposal for a 2,800 apartment development called Lytham Quays to be built on industrial brownfield sites in the east of Lytham. The developer, Kensington Developments, claimed in a 2008 article in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; that &quot;In truth, the majority of people were for it&quot;.

==Wildlife==
The Ribble Estuary and sands of St Annes and Lytham are an Important Bird Area, mainly as a feeding ground for waders during winter and spring. There are flocks of thousands of red knot, dunlin, sanderling, bar-tailed godwit and other waders; over 100,000 birds winter there. Flocks of pink-footed geese are commonly seen in winter as they fly over St Annes between their feeding grounds around Southport and Over Wyre. Many pintail and other ducks feed and rest in the estuary.

There are 80 hectares of sand dune habitat on the coast of Lytham St Annes which is home to a wide variety of rare and interesting plants and wildlife communities. The Lytham St Annes Nature Reserve has around 250 different plant species include internationally rare plants not found outside the UK. Common lizards are found across the dune system and it is an important habitat for various breeding birds including European stonechat, skylark, linnet and reed bunting. The grayling butterfly, which is a coastal specialist, is also found on the dunes.

The Witchwood is a narrow strip of woodland protected by a tree preservation order and partly a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The strip, which runs alongside the railway line, between Blackpool Road to Ballam Road, was originally part of Lytham Hall parkland and was created by Lytham St. Annes Civic Society. A limited company was established to manage the wood and society members cleared the site and introduced a path. On advice from the Forestry Commission, invasive sycamore and elm are being replaced by indigenous English species. The walk was officially opened in 1974 by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and is a haven for wildlife.

====Lytham Festival====
Lytham Green sees an annual five-day musical festival branded as the Lytham Festival and operated by Cuffe &amp; Taylor, part of Live Nation UK. Live performances on the promenade first began under the name &quot;Lytham Proms&quot; in 1999. In 2009, Daniel Cuffe and Peter Taylor took over operation of festivals on the green with a one-night concert by English soprano singer Lesley Garrett. The festival has since seen a variety of leading bands and musicians including The Human League, Madness, Nile Rodgers &amp; Chic, The Human League, Kylie Minogue, Rod Stewart, Diana Ross, Duran Duran and Tears for Fears.

== Media ==

Primary care is the responsibility of NHS North Lancashire Primary Care Trust.

There have been a number of recent reorganisations and building for general practice in the area.

General practice in Lytham is based at a health centre opened in 2009 called the Lytham Primary Care Centre. This building is on the site of the original Lytham Hospital. Two practices are housed in this building: Holland House Surgery and Fernbank Surgery.

Secondary care is mainly provided by the Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, whose nearest hospital is Blackpool Victoria Hospital.

<text>The River Dee (), in south-west Scotland, flows from its source in Loch Dee amongst the Galloway Hills, firstly to Clatteringshaws Loch, then into Loch Ken, where it joins the Water of Ken. From there, the Dee flows southwards to Kirkcudbright, and into Kirkcudbright Bay to reach the Solway Firth. The distance is just over in total. Together with its tributaries, the Dee&#x27;s total catchment area is over .

The river is dammed at Tongland, two miles (3 km) upriver from Kirkcudbright. This was constructed as part of the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme in the 1930s. Also at this site is Tongland Bridge, built in 1806 by Thomas Telford.

The ruins of Threave Castle stand on an island on the lower part of the Dee.

In Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd century work &quot;Geography&quot; it is recorded as &quot;Dēoúa&quot;. This form represents a development of Proto-Indo-European&quot; *deiueh2-&quot; &#x27;a goddess&#x27;, which occurs in many Celtic river-names.

The Battle of the River Dee may have been fought at this river or at River Cree in 1308, during the Scottish Wars of Independence.

The Dee has also been known as the Black Water of Dee because of its dark colour in the stretch above Loch Ken.

Loch Ken and the Dee Marshes were together designated a Ramsar site on August 21, 1992.

== Tarff Water ==

The Tarff Water enters the Dee as a right-bank tributary near Tongland in the tidal stretch of the river. The headwater streams of the Tarff drain the tract of country between the villages of Laurieston and Ringford including Loch Mannoch. The river should not be confused with the similarly named Tarf Water which is a tributary of the River Bladnoch further west in Galloway.

The name Tarff derives from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*tauro-&quot; &#x27;bull, aurochs&#x27;. Bulls occur frequently in Celtic river names, and these names may have had a mythological rather than literal referent. Like other examples of this name in southern Scotland, &#x27;Tarff&#x27; is Gaelic in form but is likely to derive in turn from an earlier Cumbric cognate.

<text>Grace Metalious (September 8, 1924 – February 25, 1964) was an American author known for her novel &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, one of the best selling works in publishing history.

==Early life==
Marie Grace DeRepentigny was born into poverty and a in the mill town of Manchester, New Hampshire. Writing from an early age, at Manchester Central High School, she acted in school plays. After graduation, she married George Metalious in a Catholic church in Manchester in 1943, and became a housewife and mother. The couple lived in near squalor, but she continued to write. With one child, the couple moved to Durham, New Hampshire, where George attended the University of New Hampshire. In Durham, Grace Metalious began writing seriously. When George graduated, he took a position as principal at a school in Gilmanton, New Hampshire.

==&quot;Peyton Place&quot;==
In the fall of 1954, at age 30, Metalious began work on a manuscript about the dark secrets of a small New England town. The novel had the working title &quot;The Tree and the Blossom&quot;. By the spring of 1955, she had finished the first draft. By her husband&#x27;s account, both Metaliouses regarded &quot;The Tree and the Blossom&quot; as an unwieldy title and decided to give the town a name that could be the book&#x27;s title. They first considered &quot;Potter Place&quot; (the name of a real community near Andover, New Hampshire). Realizing their town should have a fictional name, they looked through an atlas and found &quot;Payton&quot; (a town in Texas). They combined this with Place and changed the &quot;a&quot; to an &quot;e&quot;. Thus &quot;Peyton Place&quot; was born, prompting her comment, &quot;Wonderful—that&#x27;s it, George. Peyton Place. Peyton Place, New Hampshire. Peyton Place, New England. Peyton Place, USA. Truly a composite of all small towns where ugliness rears its head, and where the people try to hide all the skeletons in their closets.&quot; Other accounts say her publishers changed the name.

Metalious found an agent, Jacques Chambrun, who submitted the draft manuscript to three major publishers. In the summer of 1955, Leona Nevler, a freelance manuscript reader, read it for Lippincott and liked it, but knew it was too steamy for a major publisher to accept. She showed it to Kathryn G. (&quot;Kitty&quot;) Messner, president and editor-in-chief of the small firm Julian Messner. Messner immediately acquired the novel and asked Nevler to step in as a freelance editor for final polishing before publication.

==Publishing phenomenon==
In the summer of 1956, the Metalious family moved into a new hilltop house, and a publicity campaign was launched for the book, published on September 24, 1956. Dismissed by most critics, it nevertheless remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list for more than a year and became an international phenomenon.

The town of Peyton Place was a combination of several New Hampshire towns: Gilmanton, where Metalious lived (and which resented the notoriety); Laconia, the only nearby town of comparable size to Peyton Place and site of Metalious&#x27;s favorite bar; and the neighboring towns of Alton and Belmont. The village of Gilmanton Ironworks is where in December 1946, a daughter had murdered her sexually abusive father (upon which incident the book is partly based). The sheriff of Belknap County, Homer Crockett, and members of the New Hampshire State Police investigated the murder. Hollywood lost no time in cashing in on the book&#x27;s success—a year after its publication, the heavily sanitized movie &quot;Peyton Place&quot; was a major box-office hit. The movie&#x27;s premiere was held at the Colonial Theatre in Laconia, New Hampshire. A prime-time television series that began airing the fall after Metalious&#x27;s death (on ABC-TV, from 1964 to 1969) was a ratings success as well.

Metalious&#x27;s publisher promoted her in a photo captioned &quot;Pandora in Blue Jeans&quot;. Commenting on her critics, she observed, &quot;If I&#x27;m a lousy writer, then an awful lot of people have lousy taste&quot;. Of her work&#x27;s frankness, she said, &quot;Even Tom Sawyer had a girlfriend, and to talk about adults without talking about their sex drives is like talking about a window without glass.&quot;

==Later works==
Metalious&#x27;s other novels sold well but not as well as her first. &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot; (1959) was followed by &quot;The Tight White Collar&quot; (1961) and &quot;No Adam in Eden&quot; (1963).

==Death==
Suffering from cirrhosis of the liver from years of heavy drinking, Metalious died on February 25, 1964, at age 39. &quot;If I had to do it over again&quot;, she once said, &quot;it would be easier to be poor. Before I was successful, I was as happy as anyone gets.&quot; She is buried in Smith Meeting House Cemetery in Gilmanton.

Hours before her death, Metalious was convinced by her final lover, John Rees, to sign a will leaving him her entire estate, with the understanding that he would take care of her children. Her family was able to invalidate the will, but to little avail, as her estate proved to be insolvent from years of lavish living, generosity to &quot;friends&quot;, and embezzlement by an agent. At the time of her death, she had bank accounts totaling $41,174 and debts of more than $200,000.

==Legacy==
After Metalious&#x27;s death, &quot;Peyton Place&quot; resurfaced as the setting for nine novels by Don Tracy (1905–1976), writing as Roger Fuller, including &quot;Evils of Peyton Place&quot; (1969) and &quot;Temptations of Peyton Place&quot; (1970), but this series had only modest sales.

In 1968, songwriter Tom T. Hall compared his fictional small town of Harper Valley, also a cauldron of scandal bubbling under the surface, to Peyton Place. His song &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot; became a number one hit for Jeannie C. Riley, who also recorded a song called &quot;Satan Place&quot;.

In 2005, novelist Barbara Delinsky used Metalious and &quot;Peyton Place&quot; as a springboard for &quot;Looking for Peyton Place&quot;, her novel about the impact of Metalious&#x27;s book on a small New Hampshire town, Middle River, where residents believe &quot;Peyton Place&quot; is about their community.

In 2006, it was announced that Sandra Bullock was slated to star in and co-produce a biopic of Metalious&#x27;s life, but the film was never made.

In 2007, the Manchester Historic Association and the University of New Hampshire at Manchester honored Metalious with an in-depth examination of her life and most famous book. The celebration, which included lectures, readings of her work, and screenings of the 1957 film, marked the area&#x27;s first public acknowledgment of its native daughter.

<text>The Australia Act 1986 is the short title of each of a pair of separate but related pieces of legislation: one an act of the Parliament of Australia, the other an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. In Australia they are referred to, respectively, as the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot; (Cth) and the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot; (UK). These nearly identical Acts were passed by the two parliaments, because of uncertainty as to whether the Commonwealth Parliament alone had the ultimate authority to do so. They were enacted using legislative powers conferred by enabling acts passed by the parliaments of every Australian state. The acts came into effect simultaneously, on 3 March 1986.

According to the long title of the Australian act, its purpose was &quot;to bring constitutional arrangements affecting the Commonwealth and the States into conformity with the status of the Commonwealth of Australia as a sovereign, independent and federal nation&quot;. The Australia Act (Cth and UK) eliminated the remaining possibilities for the United Kingdom to legislate with effect in Australia, for the UK to be involved in Australian government, and for an appeal from any Australian court to a British court. This act formally severed all legal ties between Australia and the United Kingdom.

At the time, the Commonwealth, state and UK acts were known as the &quot;Australia Acts&quot;. However, in discussions of contemporary law (as opposed to legal history), the state Acts have performed their function, and thus the expression &quot;Australia Act(s)&quot; refers only to the Commonwealth and UK Acts.

==Background==

The Commonwealth of Australia was formed in 1901 by the federation of six British colonies, each of which became a state. The Constitution of Australia provided for a Commonwealth Parliament, with legislative power on a range of specified topics. The constitution was (and still is) contained in a British statute. The United Kingdom Parliament retained ultimate legislative power in relation to Australia.

The UK Parliament&#x27;s power to legislate with effect for the Commonwealth itself was mostly ended with the &quot;Statute of Westminster 1931&quot;, when adopted by Australia in 1942 retroactive to 1939. The Statute provided (s 4) that no future UK Act would apply to a dominion (of which Australia was one) as part of its law unless the Act expressly declared that the Dominion had requested and consented to it. Until then, Australia had legally been a self-governing dominion of the British Empire, but with the adoption of the Statute became a (mostly) sovereign state.

However, s 4 of the Statute only affected UK laws that were to apply as part of Australian Commonwealth law, not UK laws that were to apply as part of the law of any Australian state. Thus, the Parliament of the United Kingdom still had the power to legislate for the states. In practice, however, this power was almost never exercised. For example, in a referendum on secession in Western Australia in April 1933, 68% of voters favoured seceding from Australia and becoming a separate dominion. The state government sent a delegation to Westminster to request that this result be enacted into law, but the British government refused to intervene on the grounds that this was a matter for the Australian government. As a result of this decision in London, no action was taken in Canberra or Perth.

In the 1980s, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all began the process of severing their last constitutional links to the United Kingdom. Canada began by patriating its constitution in the Constitution Act, 1982, which was enacted by the British Parliament in the Canada Act 1982. New Zealand experienced a constitutional crisis in 1984, leading to a review of New Zealand&#x27;s constitution. Australia was experiencing the same desire for constitutional modernisation.

=== Appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ===

At federation in 1901, the supreme court of each colony became the supreme court of that state. In 1903, a High Court of Australia was established, one of whose functions was to hear appeals from the state supreme courts. The draft of the Constitution, that was put to voters in the various colonies and presented to the British government for embodiment in UK legislation, was that there was to be no appeal from the High Court to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in any matter involving the interpretation of the Constitution or of the constitution of a state, unless it involved the interests of some other dominion. However, the British insisted on a compromise. Section 74 of the Constitution as enacted by the Imperial Parliament provided two possibilities of appeal. There could be an appeal if the High Court issued a certificate that it was appropriate for the Privy Council to determine an &quot;inter se&quot; matter, i.e. a matter that concerned the constitutional relations between the Commonwealth and one or more states or between two or more states. Furthermore, there could be an appeal with permission of the Privy Council. The Commonwealth Parliament was empowered to legislate to limit the latter path and it did so in 1968 and 1975; but legislation could only limit, not abolish.

Predictably, the High Court proved reluctant to grant certificates for appeal to the Privy Council. The discretion was exercised only once, in 1912. In 1961, delivering on behalf of the whole Court a brief dismissal of an application for a certificate, Chief Justice Sir Owen Dixon said: &quot;experience showsand that experience was anticipated when s. 74 was enactedthat it is only those who dwell under a Federal Constitution who can become adequately qualified to interpret and apply its provisions&quot;. In 1985, the High Court unanimously observed that the power to grant such a certificate &quot;has long since been spent&quot; and is &quot;obsolete&quot;.

Although the path of appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council had been effectively blocked, the High Court could not block appeals from state supreme courts directly to the Privy Council. Nor did the Constitution limit, or provide for legislation to limit, such appeals. The expense of any appeal to the Privy Council in London had been a deterrent: in any year, there had never been more than a handful. Nonetheless, by the 1980s the possibility of appeal from a state supreme court was seen as outdated. In addition, in 1978 confusion over the relative precedential value of High Court and Privy Council decisions had been introduced when the High Court ruled that it would no longer be bound by Privy Council decisions.

=== Australian and British legislation ===

Disagreement existed as to whether the Commonwealth Parliament alone had sufficient authority to enact the Australia Act under section 51(xxxviii) of the Constitution, or whether an additional Act of the UK Parliament would be required. To put the legal status of the Australia Act beyond doubt, the Australian and British parliaments would each enact the Australia Act in substantially similar forms.

The plan to revamp both federal and state constitutional arrangements required each state parliament to pass its own enabling legislation. The long title of these state acts (such as the &quot;Australia Acts (Request) Act 1985&quot; of New South Wales) was &quot;An Act to enable the constitutional arrangements affecting the Commonwealth and the States to be brought into conformity with the status of the Commonwealth of Australia as a sovereign, independent and federal nation&quot;. The body of each state Act set out the state&#x27;s &quot;request and consent&quot; as to both the Australian and the UK versions of the Australia Act.

The Governor-General of Australia, Sir Ninian Stephen, assented to the Australia Act (Cth) &quot;In the name of Her Majesty&quot; on 4 December 1985. However, Queen Elizabeth II was to visit Australia early in 1986 and, in acknowledgement of Australian sensibilities, it was arranged that she would assent to both versions of the Act and then proclaim them so that they would come into force at the same moment in both countries. She assented to the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot; (UK) on 17 February 1986 and on 24 February proclaimed that it would come into force at 05:00 Greenwich Mean Time (Coordinated Universal Time) on 3 March. Then, visiting Australia, at a ceremony held in Government House, Canberra, on 2 March 1986 the Queen signed a proclamation that the &quot;Australia Act&quot; (Cth) would come into force at 05:00 GMT on 3 March. Thus, according to both UK law and Australian law, the two versions of the Australia Act would commence simultaneouslythe UK version at 05:00 GMT in the UK and, according to the time difference, the Australian version at 16:00 AEDT in Canberra. The ceremony was presided over by the Australian prime minister, Bob Hawke, to whom the Queen presented the signed copy of the proclamation, along with the assent original of the UK Act.

== The Act ==

The &quot;Australia Act&quot; ended all power of the UK Parliament to legislate with effect in Australiathat is, &quot;as part of the law of&quot; the Commonwealth, a state or a territory (s 1). Conversely, no future law of a state would be void for inconsistency with (being &quot;repugnant to&quot;) any UK law applying with &quot;paramount force&quot; in Australia; a state (like the Commonwealth) would have power to repeal or amend such an existing UK law so far as it applied to the state (s 3). State laws would no longer be subject to disallowance and reservation by the monarch (s 8)a power that, anomalously, remains for Commonwealth legislation (Constitution ss 59 and 60).

Similarly, the Australia Act removed the power of the British government to be involved in the governing of an Australian state (ss 7 and 10). Specifically, only the state premier could now advise the monarch on appointment or removal of a state governor.

Governors were vested with the ability to exercise all the powers of the monarch (except the power to appoint the governor), which the monarch was barred from exercising unless they were physically present within the state.

=== Amendment or repeal ===

Section 15 of the Australia Act sets out the procedure that the Act or the &quot;Statute of Westminster 1931&quot; can be amended or repealed as part of the law of the Commonwealth, of a state or of a territory. Mirroring the procedure of Section 51(xxxviii) of the Constitution of Australia that was used to enact the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot; (Cth), any amendment to these two pieces of legislation requires the Commonwealth Parliament to act at the request or concurrence of all the state parliaments. , neither the &quot;Australia Act&quot; nor the &quot;Statute of Westminster&quot; has been amended in this manner.

=== Appeals ===

Section 74 of the Constitution has not been amended, and the Constitution cannot be amended by legislation alone. Nonetheless, s 11 of the Australia Act goes as far as legislatively possible, to make s 74 a dead letter. Thus, for practical purposes, the Australia Act has eliminated the remaining methods of appeal to the Privy Council.

==Legacy==

The principal difference between the Commonwealth and UK versions of the Australia Act lies in the reference, appearing in the long title and preamble to the Commonwealth version but not present in the UK version, to Australia as &quot;a sovereign, independent and federal nation&quot;.

The High Court in &quot;Sue v Hill&quot; in 1999 did not rely upon the long title or the preamble, which conventionally do not have force of law. But it decided that the effect of the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot; (Cth) was that, at least from the date when the Act came into operation, Britain had become a &quot;foreign power&quot; within the meaning of Constitution section 44(i), so that a parliamentary candidate who had British nationality was ineligible to be a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. (Several more cases of British citizenship, as well as citizenship of other countries, in the Commonwealth Parliament came to light in the 2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis.)

That view was taken in &quot;Sue v Hill&quot; by three members of the High Court, supported with misgivings by one other member. One of those who did not find it necessary to express an opinion on this point, Justice Michael Kirby, was in a later case to deliver a dissent in which he argued that section 6 of the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot; (Cth) was invalid. Section 106 of the Constitution guarantees that a state constitution may be altered only in accordance with its own provisions, hence not by the Commonwealth Parliament. However, both versions of the Australia Act contain amendments to the constitutions of Queensland (s 13) and Western Australia (s 14). In Kirby J&#x27;s view in &quot;Marquet&quot; (2003), this was inconsistent with Constitution s 106, so that section 6 of the &quot;Australia Act&quot; (Cth) was not a valid exercise of Commonwealth legislative power. A majority, however, thought that it was sufficient that the Act had been passed in reliance on Constitution s 51(xxxviii), which gives the Commonwealth Parliament power to legislate at the request of the state parliaments.

In &quot;Shaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs&quot; (2003), the High Court held that the act &quot;gave voice to the completion of Australia&#x27;s evolutionary independence ... it was a formal declaration that the Commonwealth of Australia and the Australian states were completely constitutionally independent of the United Kingdom&quot;.

<doc id="415370" wikidata="Q540012" url="?curid=415370" title="Lydney">
<text>Lydney is a town and civil parish in Gloucestershire, England. It is on the west bank of the River Severn in the Forest of Dean District, and is 16 miles (25 km) southwest of Gloucester. The town has been bypassed by the A48 road since 1995. The population was about 8,960 in the 2001 census, reducing to 8,766 at the 2011 census. Increasing to 10,043 at the 2021 Census.

Lydney has a harbour on the Severn, created when the Lydney Canal was built. Adjoining the town, Lydney Park gardens have a Roman temple dedicated to Nodens.

==Etymology==

According to Cook (1906) the toponym &quot;Lydney&quot; derives from the Old English *&quot;Lydan-eġ&quot;, &quot;Lludd&#x27;s Island&quot;, which could connect it with the name Nudd/Nodens. However, more probable etymologies of Lydney are offered in other sources. A. D. Mills suggests &quot;island or river-meadow of the sailor, or of a man named *Lida&quot;, citing the forms &quot;Lideneg&quot; from c. 853 and &quot;Ledenei&quot; from the 1086 Domesday Book. The English Place Name Society&#x27;s Survey is in agreement with this. 

==History==
In the Iron Age a promontory fort was established at Lydney Park and later used for iron ore mining. In the late Roman period, a Roman temple to Nodens was built on the site of the fort.

In 1588 the Vice-Admiral of England Sir William Winter was granted the manor of Lydney in recognition of his services against the Spanish Armada. White Cross Manor, the house he built soon after he bought the manor, was burned down in 1645. In 1723 the Winter family sold their Lydney estate to the Bathurst family

In 1810, docks were constructed to capitalise on the town&#x27;s location, close to the River Severn. The River Lyd flows through the town and into the Severn. In 1935, Charles Bathurst was created Viscount Bledisloe of Lydney upon his retirement as Governor-General of New Zealand. In 1940, the Pine End Works was built on Harbour Road, a Government run shadow factory producing plywood for the aircraft industry. On 31 August 1962, the Beatles played at Lydney Town Hall.

===The Lydney Murder, 1964===
In 1964 the town was the site of the Lydney Murder, a significant case in the history of the use of entomology to assist criminal investigations. On 28 June 1964 a body was found in woods near Bracknell. By studying the maggots found on the body, forensic entomologist Professor Keith Simpson was able to establish a date of death of around 16 June 1964. Missing persons records for that date led the police to believe that the body was that of Peter Thomas, who had gone missing from his home in Lydney. Fingerprints confirmed the identification. William Brittle, a business partner of Thomas, was convicted of the murder. The Lydney Murder was the subject of an episode of the Discovery Channel documentary: &quot;Crime Museum UK with Martin Kemp&quot;.

==Transport==

The Severn Railway Bridge crossed just north of Lydney from Purton to Sharpness on the eastern bank. Built in the 1870s, it was damaged beyond repair by a pair of oil tanker barges in 1960. The barges hit Pier 17 bringing down two bowstring girders. There have been several plans to renew the link.

Lydney railway station, managed by Transport for Wales which serves the town, is located on the Gloucester to Newport Line, with connections from the town centre by the Dean Forest Railway. Lydney Canal was once an important harbour for shipping timber, coal and iron from the Forest of Dean. It is now a harbour for pleasure craft.
The original name of Mumford Body &amp; Engineering Company Limited was changed to Lydney Coachworks Limited in 1947 to continue bus bodybuilding work. Orders came mainly from local companies such as Red &amp; White, United Welsh and Newbury &amp; District plus a surprise order from Leigh Corporation in Lancashire. After only a short time the coachworks closed down in March 1952, the uncompleted orders being transferred to Bristol TCC and Eastern Coach Works.

==Government and politics==

Lydney is covered by a three-tier system of local government. The upper authority is Gloucestershire County Council which is based in Shire Hall, Gloucester. The second tier being Forest of Dean District Council, based in Coleford which is a non-metropolitan district council.

The lowest tier of local government is Lydney Town Council which covers an area of approximately 8 square miles. The council was awarded &quot;Quality Gold&quot; standard in September 2015 in a national award scheme for local councils.

==Secondary education==
The town is served by The Dean Academy, previously Whitecross School (1973-2012), and before that the Lydney Grammar School (1903–1973).

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Gloucestershire, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West and Dean Radio, a community based radio station. The local newspaper is &quot;The Forester&quot;.

==Sport, recreation and arts==

The club had successful runs in the John Player Cup during the 1980s, including a match against Sale F.C. which was televised on the BBC&#x27;s Rugby Special. There is also a leisure centre which contains an indoor swimming pool, a gym and more.

Former Glamorgan captain and England opening batsman Steve James began his career at the club. Lydney was also the club of first English club of England wicket-keeper Geraint Jones.

Lydney Town F.C. is based at the town&#x27;s recreation ground, they run a total of four sides playing Hellenic Football League, Gloucestershire Northern Senior League and two sides in the North Gloucestershire Football League. Bathurst Park in the centre of the town (not to be confused with Lydney Park on the town&#x27;s outskirts) is home to several senior and junior football and cricket teams. There is a hockey club hockey club and a netball club which play their home games at Whitecross School. Lydney Golf Club was a nine-hole course located off Lakeside Avenue but has built a new course on a site located on the opposite side of the Lydney Bypass. There is an outdoor swimming pool, the Bathurst Swimming Pool built in the 1920s, open from May until early September. It is operated by volunteers (excluding the life guards).

Lydney Twonkers Scrabble Club play their home games at the town&#x27;s library. The Twonkers were Western Area Scrabble League champions in 2001 and 2005 and were twice runners-up in the National Scrabble Club Knockout Tournament in 1999 and 2003. Lydney has a town brass band that was founded in 1892. The organisation operates three ensembles, the Town Band, the Training Band, and a Starter Group.

<text>Kurdish music () refers to music performed in the Kurdish languages and Zaza-Gorani languages. The earliest study of Kurdish music was initiated by the renowned Armenian priest and composer Komitas in 1903, when he published his work &quot;Chansons kurdes transcrites par le pere Komitas&quot; which consisted of twelve Kurdish melodies which he had collected. The Armenian Karapetê Xaço also preserved many traditional Kurdish melodies throughout the 20th century by recording and performing them. In 1909, Scholar Isya Joseph published the work &quot;Yezidi works&quot; in which he documented the musical practice of the Yazidis including the role of the musician-like qewal figures and the instruments used by the minority.

Kurdish music appeared in phonographs in the late 1920s, when music companies in Baghdad began recording songs performed by Kurdish artists.

Despite being secondary to vocals, Kurds use many instruments in traditional music. Musical instruments include the tembûr (see kurdish tanbur), bağlama, qernête, daf, duduk, kaval, long flute (şimşal), kemenche, oboe (zirne) and drum (dahol).
== Definition ==

Traditional Kurdish music is culturally distinct from Arabic, Armenian and Turkish music, and mostly composed by people who remained anonymous. Thematically, the music were of melancholic and elegiac character, but has since then incorporated more upbeat and joyous melodies. 

Kurdish folklore consists of three genres: the storytellers (çîrokbêj), bards (dengbêj) and popular singers (stranbêj). 

Moreover, there are religious-themed songs (lawje) seasonal musical topics, for example &quot;payizok&quot; that are songs about the return to the summer pastures performed in autumn. Kurdish improvisations are called teqsîm.

== Prohibition ==
In Iraq, tolerance for Kurdish music ceased with the Saddam regime (1979–2003) which put in place restrictions against Kurdish culture. Between 1982 and 1991 the performance and recording of songs in Kurdish was also banned in Turkey.

<text>Longridge is a market town and civil parish in the borough of Ribble Valley in Lancashire, England. It is situated north-east of the city of Preston, at the western end of Longridge Fell, a long ridge above the River Ribble. The nearest villages are Grimsargh, to the southeast, and Ribchester to the southeast. The parish of Longridge had a population of 7,546 recorded in the 2001 census, increasing to 7,724 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
Longridge initially developed outwards from an area around St. Lawrence&#x27;s Church, at the boundary of the townships of Dilworth and Alston and to the south of the modern-day town centre. Though there was a thoroughfare called &#x27;Market Place&#x27;, there was no development around that area. Most of the development of the town occurred after 1800. After this time, development occurred at a much faster pace, with expansion northwards including a mill to the north of Kestor Lane.

The demand for stone from Longridge&#x27;s quarries led to the opening of the Preston and Longridge Railway in 1840 to carry the stone away, for use in such places as Liverpool Docks. The arrival of the railway led to the opening of several cotton mills and the town grew considerably larger from the mid-19th century. The mills and quarries have now all closed, although stone quarried in the town was used to construct the M55 motorway in the 1970s. One of the quarries was used as Longridge motor-racing circuit between 1973 and 1978. Longridge railway station closed to passengers in 1930, and the railway was dismantled in 1967. The station buildings were then used as offices for the parish council until 2010 when the Longridge Town Council began a project to renovate and reopen the buildings to the public with help from the Lottery Heritage Fund. Longridge railway station is now managed by Longridge Social Enterprise Company and is home to a heritage centre, the Old Station Cafe and has various business facilities available.

==Governance==

There are three tiers of local government covering Longridge, at parish (town), district and county level: Longridge Town Council, Ribble Valley Borough Council (based in Clitheroe) and Lancashire County Council (based in Preston). The town council has its headquarters in the former Longridge railway station buildings on Berry Lane.

Longridge was historically part of the ancient parish of Ribchester, which contained a number of townships. Longridge straddled the two townships of Alston and Dilworth. An ecclesiastical parish of Longridge was created in 1861 covering the whole of the two townships, with the existing chapel of ease of St Lawrence becoming the parish church. The same area was made a local government district called Longridge in 1883, governed by a local board. Such local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894.

Longridge Urban District Council bought a large Victorian house called The Limes on Berry Lane in 1947 to serve as its headquarters. The urban district was abolished in 1974, becoming part of the new Ribble Valley district. A successor parish was created covering the former urban district, with its parish council taking the name Longridge Town Council.

==Community==
The town is home to eleven pubs, several restaurants, a public library, and a number of primary and high schools. It is also home to an Air Training Corps squadron and an Army Cadet Force detachment. Longridge parish is also the location of Alston Hall, a residential adult education college operated by Lancashire Adult Learning. The local football club, Longridge Town F.C., has two senior teams and plays in the NWCFL, at Step 5 of the FA Football Pyramid. Its ground and clubhouse are situated off Inglewhite Road, behind the Alston Arms. As of 2011, Longridge had its own monthly farmers&#x27; market but has now stopped.

The Anglican church of St. Lawrence is located on Lower Lane and the Anglican church of St. Paul is located on Church Street.

==Sport==
Longridge Golf Club is located on Forty Acre Lane on Longridge Fell.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Lancashire, Heart North West, Smooth North West, Capital Manchester and Lancashire, Greatest Hits Radio Lancashire and Central Radio North West, a community-based station. 

The Lancashire Telegraph is the local newspaper that covers the town. 

==People==
John Farnworth, a freestyle footballer; Alan Kelly, footballer who played for the Irish national team along with Preston North End; cricketer Andrew Miller. Actress Christina Chong lived in Longridge and trained at the Sutcliffe School of Dance.

Composer Ernest Tomlinson lived close to Longridge until his death in 2015. His library of light orchestral music was housed in his barn.

<doc id="415380" wikidata="Q631540" url="?curid=415380" title="USS Thomas Jefferson (SSBN-618)">
<text>USS &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; (SSBN-618), an nuclear-powered submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Founding Father Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), the third President of the United States (1801–1809). She later was reclassified as an attack submarine and redesignated SSN-618.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot;″s keel was laid down on 3 February 1961, at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding sponsored by Margaret Craig McNamara, wife of United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara; and commissioned on 4 January 1963, Commander Leon H. Rathbun commanding the Blue Crew and Commander Charles Priest, Jr., commanding the Gold Crew. &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; was initially a fleet ballistic missile submarine and was later converted to an attack submarine.

==Ship history==

===Fleet ballistic missile submarine service, 1963-1981===
After shakedown training by both crews and a repair period, &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 14 in early October 1963. On 28 October 1963, the Blue Crew took the submarine on her first deterrent patrol which ended at Holy Loch, Scotland, in December 1963. &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; continued patrols from Holy Loch for the next four years and also acted as flagship for Submarine Squadron 14. In 1966, she returned to New London, Connecticut, for two training and rehabilitation periods. She began her 15th deterrent patrol on 12 January 1967 and, upon its completion, returned to Newport News, Virginia, for her first overhaul and refuelling. On 17 June 1968, &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; was ready for sea, and refresher training was held for both crews. Her 16th deterrent patrol began on 29 October and terminated at Rota, Spain, on 5 December 1968.

&quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; made four deterrent patrols in each of the following years: 1969, 1970, 1971, and 1972. She also conducted special operations in 1970 and 1971. On 20 October 1972, the Gold Crew was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation for its special operations of the previous year.

&quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; completed two patrols in 1973 before returning to the United States to hold midshipman training from 18 June to 31 August. Her last patrol of the year terminated on 12 December 1973. Her 36th and final, patrol in the Atlantic lasted from 31 January to 22 March 1974. After calling at Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina, the submarine returned to New London 22 May. &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; was then reassigned to the Pacific Fleet with her new homeport at Vallejo, California. She stood out of New London on 7 June en route to the United States West Coast and arrived at Mare Island on 27 June.

On 1 July 1974, &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul, refueling, and conversion to the Polaris A-3 missile system. She remained in the shipyard until 17 November 1975 when she got underway for Bremerton, Washington. The submarine remained in Puget Sound for a month and then moved to San Diego, California.

During the period January to March 1976, &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot;″s Blue Crew conducted post-overhaul shakedown operations and then transited the Panama Canal to conduct a Polaris missile firing at Cape Canaveral, Florida.

While operating out of San Diego in 1976, with the Blue Crew aboard, the ship experienced a complete loss of electrical power and propulsion. The only lighting during this event were the battery powered lanterns located throughout the ship. There was fire and flooding which caused a reactor scram during ORSE(Operational Reactor Safety Exam). If not for the training the crew had, this event may have resulted in tragedy. After successful ascent, the boat proceeded under its own power back to San Diego where an investigation resulted in better training for the ORSE Board Examiners.

The Gold Crew took over the ship on 4 April and conducted additional post-overhaul shakedown operations which included a missile firing at Cape Canaveral, a transit of the Panama Canal, and a missile loadout at Bangor, Washington, before resuming deterrent patrol operations with the Pacific Fleet on 8 August. &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; continued these operations as a unit of Submarine Squadron 15 from 1977 to 1980, at the end of which she completed her 51st deterrent patrol.

===Attack submarine service, 1981-1985===

In fiscal year 1981, in compliance with the SALT I treaty, the missile section of &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; was disabled. Concrete blocks were placed in the missile tubes, and the missile fire-control system was removed. The ship was reclassified as an attack submarine and redesignated SSN-618 on 11 March 1981 and retained primarily for training, antisubmarine warfare exercises, and other secondary duties.

:&quot;History needed for 1981-1985.&quot;

==Decommissioning and disposal==
Decommissioned on 24 January 1985 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 April 1986, ex-&quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; started the Navy&#x27;s Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton on 1 October 1996 and ceased to exist upon completion of the recycling process on 6 March 1998. The sail is preserved in Gosport park adjacent to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia.

<text>Angel Stadium is a ballpark in Anaheim, California, United States. Since its opening in 1966, it has been the home venue of the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). It was also the home of the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL) from 1980 to 1994.

The stadium is often referred to by its unofficial nickname The Big A, coined by &quot;Herald Examiner&quot; Sports Editor, Bud Furillo. It is the fourth-oldest active ballpark in the majors, behind Fenway Park, Wrigley Field, and Dodger Stadium. The stadium hosted the MLB All-Star Game three times in 1967, 1989, and 2010, as well as hosted the World Series in 2002.

Aside from professional baseball and football, Angel Stadium has hosted high school and college football games, the short-lived World Football League, two crusades by evangelist Billy Graham, 20 consecutive annual crusades by evangelist Greg Laurie, Eid el Fitr celebrations, concerts, and 2 to 3 AMA Supercross Championship races a year.

The stadium also houses the studios and offices of the Angels&#x27; owned and operated flagship radio station, KLAA (830 AM).

==Location and &quot;Big A&quot;==
Angel Stadium and its surrounding parking lot are roughly bounded by Katella Avenue to the north, the Orange Freeway to the east, Orangewood Avenue to the south, and State College Boulevard to the west.

The landmark &quot;Big A&quot; sign, which originally served as a scoreboard support in left field, is located near the eastern boundary of the parking lot. The halo located near the top of the tall, 210-ton sign once blinked on and off after dark on game days when the Angels won (both at home and on the road) a practice broadcaster Victor Rojas was known for referring to by saying &quot;Light that baby up!&quot; (blinking) after a victory. The halo would remain on without blinking when they lost. Since at least the 2023 season, the halo remains lit at all times, although it shines brighter when the Angels win.

===ARTIC (Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center)===
ARTIC (Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center) servicing the Metrolink Orange County Line and Amtrak Pacific Surfliner, is located nearby on the other side of the State Route 57 and accessed through the Douglass Road gate at the northeast corner of the parking lot. The station provides convenient access to the stadium, the nearby Honda Center, and Disneyland from various communities along the route.

==History==
===Beginnings===

Angel Stadium has been the home of the Angels since their move from Los Angeles. On August 31, 1964, ground was broken for Anaheim Stadium and in 1966, the then-California Angels moved into their new home after having spent four seasons renting Dodger Stadium (referred to in Angels games as Chavez Ravine Stadium) from the Dodgers. (In their inaugural season of 1961, the Angels played their home games at Los Angeles&#x27; Wrigley Field.)

The stadium was built on a parcel of about of flat land originally used for agricultural purposes by the Allec, Russell, and Knutzen families in the southeast portion of Anaheim. Consistent with many major-league sports stadiums built in the 1960s, it is located in a suburban area, though one that is host to major tourist attractions.
The field dimensions (333 feet) were derived from a scientific study conducted by the Angels. Based on the air density at normal game times (1:30 pm and 8 pm), the Angels tried to formulate dimensions that were fairly balanced between pitcher, hitter, and average weather conditions. The Angels tinkered with those dimensions several times, expanding or contracting parts of the outfield by a few feet, to refine that balance. is the second shortest center-field in the American League, and tied for 4th-shortest in the major leagues with Petco Park behind only Fenway Park at , Oracle Park at and Dodger Stadium at . Despite this, Angels Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan still threw two of his seven no-hitters in the ballpark, alongside 2,416 of his 5,714 career strikeouts.

===The Rams===

In the late 1970s, Los Angeles Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom was looking for a more modern venue than the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and also wanted a stadium small enough to prevent Rams games from being blacked out on local television. The Coliseum seated almost 100,000 people, and the Rams had trouble filling it even in their best years. Rosenbloom eventually brokered a deal by which the Rams would move from Los Angeles to an expanded Anaheim Stadium. To add more seats (eventually about 23,000) for football games, the mezzanine and upper decks were extended completely around the playing field, resulting in a roughly trapezoidal, completely enclosed stadium. An elevated bank of bleachers was built in right and left fields, and temporary seats were placed underneath to be pulled out for football games.

Additionally, the Big A scoreboard support that stood in left field, and was the inspiration for the stadium&#x27;s nickname, was moved to its present site in the parking lot, adjoining the Orange Freeway beyond the right-field stands; its usage changed from scoreboard to electronic marquee advertising upcoming events at the stadium. A black and amber scoreboard/instant replay video board was installed above the newly constructed upper deck seats in left field. Swift technical innovations in scoreboards in the 1980s quickly made the 1979 display obsolete, and the visual quality was washed out during day games as it was in direct sunshine, leading a Sony Jumbotron color board to replace it in 1988, alongside amber matrix displays installed above the right field upper deck and along the infield balcony. A triangular metal spire was added to the top of the Jumbotron to evoke the original emplacement of the &quot;Big A&quot;.

As with the addition of football seats to Candlestick Park a decade before to accommodate the rival San Francisco 49ers, the changes ultimately disadvantaged the Angels and their fans. Originally no seat had been further than from the field when first designed for baseball, but afterwards this was no longer the case. Also, while the expanded capacity allowed the Angels to set attendance records that still stand today, on most occasions even crowds of 40,000 left swaths of unusable and empty seats. It also did not completely solve the television blackout issue which inspired the Rams to move from the Coliseum, as the stadium would not sell out if the Rams weren&#x27;t competitive or if the opposing team did not draw their own fans to Anaheim (be they from out of town or transplants to Southern California) to sell out the game.
The expansion was completed in time for the 1980 NFL season, and the Rams played in Anaheim Stadium from then until their move to St. Louis after the 1994 season. The Rams would later return to Los Angeles in 2016, playing their games at the Memorial Coliseum again for four seasons; the team moved into the new SoFi Stadium in Inglewood in 2020.

The January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake on Martin Luther King Jr. Day caused the left-field Jumbotron to collapse onto the upper deck seats beneath it. As the Rams and Angels were both out of season and it occurred in the pre-dawn hours, nobody was injured. The damaged section was deconstructed and rebuilt with a new scoreboard structure and Jumbotron, eliminating the A-frame spire that evoked the Big A.

===The Disney era===

In 1996, two years after the Rams&#x27; final game in Anaheim, The Walt Disney Company, a minority owner of the team since its inception (the stadium is located less than east of Disneyland and across from the Arrowhead Pond, the home venue of the then Disney-owned Mighty Ducks of Anaheim), gained enough support on the board to effectively take control of the team. Soon afterward, the Angels and the city of Anaheim agreed to a new deal that would keep the Angels in Anaheim until 2031, with an option to leave the facility after the 2016 season. As part of the deal, the stadium underwent an extensive renovation, returning the stadium to its original role as a baseball-only facility. Before the 1997 baseball season, the section behind the outfield wall was demolished. Disney briefly considered moving the Big A scoreboard to its original location, but decided against such a move, citing costs as well as the fact that the Big A had become a Southern California landmark in its parking lot location.

Despite the fact that much of the stadium was still a hard-hat zone, the demolition and construction being only half-completed, the Angels played their 1997 season in Anaheim. Fans were greeted by a restored view of the San Gabriel and Santa Ana Mountains, the Brea Hills, and the 57 freeway beyond the outfield.

Work that did not interfere with game play continued throughout the 1997 season, with major renovations resuming in the winter of 1997. These included the installation of outfield bleacher pavilions, a video display board and an out-of-town scoreboard below the right field seats. All of the multicolored seats were replaced by green seats. The exterior of the stadium was also renovated. The concrete structure and ramps were painted a combination of green and sandstone. Much of the façade of the stadium was torn down to create a more open feeling for visitors.

The most notable feature of the entire renovation, however, was a &quot;California Spectacular&quot; in which geysers erupt and a stream cascades down a mountainside (Pride Rock) covered with real trees, artificial rocks behind the left-center field fence, and new bullpens. Fireworks shoot out of the display at the start of games, after every Angel home run and after every Angel win (previously they had been shot off from a parking garage).

The field dimensions of the renovated stadium became somewhat asymmetrical, with the high fence in right center field (which earlier hid the football-only bleacher section) replaced by a high wall which contains a scoreboard displaying out-of-town scores of other games. A plaza was built around the perimeter of the stadium, and inside are statues depicting longtime Angel owner and chairman Gene Autry and Michelle Carew, daughter of former Angel Rod Carew, who died of leukemia at the age of 18.
The main entrance includes two giant Angels hats complete with New Era tags on the sweatband (including one indicating the hats&#x27; size: 649½). The hats were originally blue and featured the Angels&#x27; &quot;winged&quot; logo designed by Disney for the 1997 season, and were repainted red and decorated with the present-day halo insignia for the 2002 season. Also outside home plate gate is a full-sized brick infield complete with regulation pitcher&#x27;s mound and lighted bases, with bricks at each player position engraved with the names of Angels players who played at that position on Opening Day of each season since the Angels began play in 1961. For a fee, the green infield bricks can be engraved with fans&#x27; names or personalized messages. The Angels opened their &quot;new&quot; stadium on April 1, 1998, with a 4–1 victory over the New York Yankees. The renovated stadium has 5,075 club seats and 78 luxury suites.

In 1998, the stadium was renamed Edison International Field of Anaheim after local utility Edison International reached a deal giving it naming rights over the stadium for 20 years, and during this time, the stadium was referred to as the &quot;Big Ed&quot;. However, after the 2003 season, Edison International exercised its option to exit the sponsorship deal. On December 29, 2003, the Angels announced that from then on the stadium would be known as Angel Stadium (in full, Angel Stadium of Anaheim); Disney sold the Angels around this time as well.

===Video improvements and cancelled sale===
In 2009, Daktronics installed light emitting diode (LED) displays at the stadium. The largest video display measures high by wide. Two smaller displays flank the large display, and a field-level display sits in the centerfield fence.

During the 2017-2018 offseason, the Angels upgraded the existing video boards in left and right field. The new left field video board measures , while the new right field board measures , the fourth largest scoreboard in MLB. In addition to this, the out of town scoreboard was upgraded, new video ribbons stretch from foul pole to foul pole, and a new sound system was added. Because of the new out of town scoreboard, the Angels moved the home run line in right field down from to , though the height of the right field wall remains the same.

The Angels opted out of their lease in October 2018, largely to avoid a contractual provision which would have forced them to remain in the stadium until 2029, though the club then had no new stadium proposals or moving plans. In December 2019, the city of Anaheim agreed to sell the stadium and surrounding land to an Arte Moreno-affiliated management company for $325 million, with the team committed to remain in Anaheim until at least 2050, with options to remain until at least 2065. The deal, made behind closed doors, has led to allegations of corruption and violations of the state&#x27;s Surplus Land Act. An ongoing FBI investigation into the city&#x27;s internal affairs and the stadium sale eventually led to the resignation of Anaheim mayor Harry Sidhu on May 23, 2022, putting the stadium&#x27;s pending sale into question. On May 24, 2022, the Anaheim City Council voted to cancel the sale to Moreno&#x27;s SRB Management, in light of the corruption probe. On February 6, 2025, the Angels extended their lease until 2032.

==Notable events==

===Baseball===

The stadium was host to the 1967 MLB All-Star Game, the first All-Star Game to be played on prime-time television. This was the first time an All-Star Game was held at night since World War II. Angel Stadium again hosted All-Star Games in 1989 and 2010.

It hosted seven American League Division Series (2002, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2014) and six American League Championship Series (1979, 1982, 1986, 2002, 2005, and 2009). Most notably, it hosted the 2002 World Series, which the Angels won over the San Francisco Giants.

Angel Stadium hosted several games during Round 2 of the 2006 World Baseball Classic.

Famous individual baseball milestones attained in the stadium included Mickey Mantle&#x27;s last game-winning home run, Nolan Ryan&#x27;s striking out of nine consecutive Boston Red Sox players (and two of his seven no-hitters), Reggie Jackson&#x27;s 500th career home run, Rod Carew&#x27;s 3,000th career base hit, Don Sutton&#x27;s 300th career win, Vladimir Guerrero&#x27;s 400th career home run, George Brett&#x27;s 3,000th career base hit, and Albert Pujols&#x27; 600th career home run.

Several major motion pictures have been shot at Angel Stadium. The final sequence of &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; (1988) featured an electronically manipulated Reggie Jackson trying to shoot Queen Elizabeth II. Exteriors were shot at the ballpark, but most baseball scenes were shot at Dodger Stadium. The 1988 sci-fi comedy &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot; features a scene shot in Angel Stadium of Kim Basinger speaking to an extraterrestrial counsel. The 1990 comedy &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot; featured a World Series matchup between the Angels and the Chicago Cubs, with the baseball scenes in the movie having been filmed in the stadium. The Disney remake of &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot; (1994) prominently uses the ballpark; however, many of the interior shots were filmed at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum. The stadium served as a stand-in for Candlestick Park in filming of &quot;The Fan&quot; (1996). Scenes from &quot;Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo&quot; and &quot;Air Bud: Seventh Inning Fetch&quot; were also filmed here.

<text>Improvised Music from Japan is a music website and record label.

The website was originally known as &quot;Japanese Free Improvisers&quot;. As its name suggests, it concentrates on Japanese and Japan-based musical improvisers, particularly free improvisers. It was founded in 1996 by Yoshiyuki Suzuki.

==Releases==

In December 2001, a compilation box-set, also called &quot;Improvised Music from Japan&quot;, was released to mark the fifth anniversary of the website. It was a 10 CD collection of previously unissued material from a variety of Japanese musicians (some of them collaborating with Europeans and Americans). The artists featured on the release are:

* Tamaru
* Yumiko Tanaka
* Tsuguto Tsunoda
* Kazuhisa Uchihashi

<doc id="415388" wikidata="Q539571" url="?curid=415388" title="Olestra">
<text>Olestra (also known by its brand name Olean) is a fat substitute food additive that adds no metabolizable calories to products. It has been used in the preparation of otherwise high-fat foods, thereby lowering or eliminating their fat content. 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved olestra for use in the US as a replacement for fats and oils in prepackaged ready-to-eat snacks in 1996, concluding that such use &quot;meets the safety standard for food additives, reasonable certainty of no harm&quot;. In the early 2000s, olestra lost popularity due to supposed side effects and is largely phased out, but products containing the ingredient are available in some countries. As of 2024, no products using olestra are sold in the United States.

== Commercialization ==
Olestra was discovered accidentally by Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) researchers F. Mattson and R. Volpenhein in 1968 while researching fats that could be more easily digested by premature infants. In 1971, P&amp;G met with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to examine what sort of testing would be required to introduce olestra as a food additive.

During the following tests, P&amp;G noticed a decline in blood cholesterol levels as a side effect of olestra replacing natural dietary fats. Following this potentially lucrative possibility, in 1975, P&amp;G filed a new request with the FDA to use olestra as a &quot;drug&quot;, specifically to lower cholesterol levels. The lengthy series of studies that followed failed, however, to demonstrate the 15% reduction required by the FDA to be approved as a treatment. Further work on Olestra languished.

In 1984, the FDA allowed Kellogg to claim publicly that their high-fiber breakfast cereals were effective in reducing the risk of cancer. P&amp;G immediately started another test series that lasted three years. When these tests were completed, P&amp;G filed for approval as a food additive for up to 35% replacement of fats in home cooking and 75% in commercial uses.

One of the main concerns the FDA had about olestra was it might encourage consumers to eat more of the &quot;top of the pyramid&quot; foods because of the perception of its being healthier. This could result in consumers engaging in over-consumption, thinking the addition of olestra would remove negative consequences. In light of this possibility, approving it as an additive would have meant consumers would be consuming a food with a relatively high amount of an additive, whose long-term health effects were not documented. This made the FDA particularly hesitant to approve the product, as well as the side effects, such as diarrhea, and concern for the loss of fat-soluble vitamins. In August 1990, P&amp;G narrowed their focus to &quot;savory snacks&quot;, potato chips, tortilla chips, crackers and similar foods.

By this point, the original patents were approaching their 1995 expiration. P&amp;G lobbied for an extension, which they received in December 1993. This extension lasted until 25 January 1996. With pressure from P&amp;G, the approval was finally granted on 24 January, one day before the patent expired, automatically extending the patent by two years.

At the time of the 1996 ruling, FDA concluded that, &quot;to avoid being misbranded... olestra-containing foods would need to bear a label statement to inform consumers about possible effects of olestra on the gastrointestinal system. The label statement also would clarify that the added vitamins were present to compensate for any nutritional effects of olestra, rather than to provide enhanced nutritional value&quot;. The FDA later removed the label requirement saying that the &quot;current label does not accurately communicate information to consumers&quot;. The FDA also agreed with P&amp;G that the &quot;label statement could be misleading and cause consumers of olestra to attribute serious problems to olestra when this was unlikely to be the case&quot;.

=== Discontinued products ===
Olestra was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as a food additive in 1996 and was initially used in potato chips under the WOW brand by Frito Lay. In 1998, the first year olestra products were marketed nationally after the FDA&#x27;s Food Advisory Committee confirmed a judgment it made two years earlier, sales were over $400 million. By 2000, though, sales slowed to $200 million. P&amp;G abandoned attempts to widen the uses of olestra and sold off its Cincinnati-based factory to Twin Rivers Technologies in February 2002. The WOW chips were rebranded to &quot;Lay&#x27;s Light&quot; in 2004 and were discontinued by 2016.

Pringles Light potato crisps, manufactured by Kellogg&#x27;s (though at one time a P&amp;G product), used Olean-brand olestra before being discontinued in 2015.

== Side effects ==
Starting in 1996, an FDA-mandated health warning label reads &quot;This Product Contains Olestra. Olestra may cause abdominal cramping and loose stools. Olestra inhibits the absorption of some vitamins and other nutrients. Vitamins A, D, E, and K have been added&quot;.

These symptoms, normally occurring only by excessive consumption in a short period of time, are known as steatorrhea and are caused by an excess of fat in stool.

The FDA removed the warning requirement in 2003, as it had &quot;conducted a scientific review of several post-market studies submitted by P&amp;G, as well as adverse event reports submitted by P&amp;G and the Center for Science in the Public Interest. The FDA concluded the label statement was no longer warranted&quot;. The FDA also agreed with P&amp;G that the &quot;label statement could be misleading and cause consumers of olestra to attribute serious problems to olestra when this [was] unlikely to be the case&quot;.

When removing the olestra warning label requirement, the FDA cited a six-week P&amp;G study of more than 3000 people showing the olestra-eating group experienced only a small increase in bowel movement frequency compared to the control group. The FDA concluded that &quot;subjects eating olestra-containing chips were no more likely to report having had loose stools, abdominal cramps, or any other GI symptom compared to subjects eating an equivalent amount of [potato] chips&quot;.

In addition to the effects of the health warnings on public acceptance of the product, olestra might not have lived up to consumer expectations of speedy results. If consumers believed that they could eat more to compensate for the fat calories &quot;saved&quot;, olestra would not be an effective way to improve overall diet. The manufacturers claim that the authentic taste and feel of olestra offsets this tendency, and some studies have shown that people who consume foods with olestra don&#x27;t eat more to offset the loss in calories. P&amp;G conducted publicity campaigns to highlight olestra&#x27;s benefits, including working directly with the health-care community.

Olestra is prohibited from sale in many markets, including the European Union and Canada.

Consumption of olestra may encourage rats to eat too much of foods containing regular fats, due to the learning of an incorrect association between fat intake and calories. Rats that were fed regular potato chips as well as chips cooked with olestra gained more weight when subsequently eating a high-fat diet than rats that received just regular chips.

== Chemistry ==
Triglycerides, the energy-yielding dietary fats, consist of three fatty acids bonded in the form of esters to a glycerol backbone. Olestra uses sucrose as the backbone in place of glycerol, and it can form esters with up to eight fatty acids. Olestra is a mixture of hexa-, hepta-, and octa-esters of sucrose with various long chain fatty acids. The resulting radial arrangement is too large and irregular to move through the intestinal wall and be absorbed into the bloodstream. Olestra has the same taste and mouthfeel as fat, but it passes through the gastrointestinal tract undigested without contributing calories or nutritive value to the diet.

From a mechanical point of view, scientists were able to manipulate the compound in such a way that it could be used in place of cooking oils in the preparation of many types of food.

Since it contains fatty acid functional groups, olestra is able to dissolve lipid-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, and vitamin A, along with carotenoids. Fat-soluble nutrients consumed with olestra products are excreted with the undigested olestra molecules. To counteract this loss of nutrients, products made with olestra are fortified with oil-soluble vitamins.

== Applications ==
P&amp;G is marketing its sucrose ester products under the brand &quot;Sefose&quot; for use as an industrial lubricant and paint additive. Because Sefose is made by chemically combining sugar and vegetable oil, it releases no toxic fumes and could potentially become a safe and environmentally friendly replacement for petrochemicals in these applications. It is currently used as a base for deck stains and a lubricant for small power tools, and there are plans to use it on larger machinery.

There is preliminary evidence that indicates that administration of olestra may accelerate the excretion of hydrophobic toxins, although there have been no randomized controlled clinical trials to establish the effectiveness of this potential treatment. Toxins that have been studied in conjunction with olestra treatment include dioxins, hexachlorobenzene, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

<text>is a Japanese musician.

Yoshida does not play instruments, instead making her music with her own voice. Rather than conventional singing she makes a variety of vocalisations of such a nature that it is often hard to tell that the sounds are being produced by a voice at all. These sounds are sometimes subtly electronically altered. She describes her means of producing sound as the &quot;howling voice&quot;.

Her records include &quot;Spiritual Voice&quot; (1997) and the thirteen track, four-minute EP &quot;.&quot; (2002, released on a business-card sized CD). Her 2003 release, &quot;Tiger Thrush&quot; on the Improvised Music from Japan label, includes 99 untitled tracks.

She has collaborated with a number of other musicians, among them Otomo Yoshihide, Sachiko M (with whom she performs as Cosmos) and Utah Kawasaki (with whom she makes up Astro Twin). &quot;Soba to Bara&quot;, a 2009 release on Erstwhile Records, found Yoshida and Toshimaru Nakamura (no-input mixing board) performing one 47-minute improvisation each and pairing the two recordings, each musician&#x27;s part unheard by the other.

<text>Senlis () is a commune in the northern French department of Oise, Hauts-de-France.

The monarchs of the early French dynasties lived in Senlis, attracted by the proximity of the Chantilly forest. It is known for its Gothic cathedral and other historical monuments. Its inhabitants are called &quot;Senlisiens&quot; and &quot;Senlisiennes&quot;.

== Geography==
Senlis is situated on the river Nonette, between the forests of Chantilly and d&#x27;Ermenonville in the South and d&#x27;Halatte on the North. It is located 40 kilometers to the north of Paris, 44 km from Beauvais and 79 km from Amiens.
The highest point of the town (140m) lies at the heart of the forest Halatte and the lowest point is located on the banks of the Nonette, west of the city. Geologically, the area is occupied by a vast limestone plateau of the Lutetian covered mostly in silt.

== History==
Senlis was known in early Roman imperial times as Augustomagus and later as Civitas Silvanectium (&quot;City of the Silvanectes&quot;). During the 3rd century, a seven-meter high defensive wall, about half of which still exists, was erected around the settlement in response to Frankish incursions. The wall remained in use into the 13th century. The town also featured a Roman amphitheatre, the remains of which are still visible, about 500 m west of the walled town. The amphitheatre seated as many as 10,000 people and was used for public meetings, theatre, gladiatorial combats, and animal hunts. The monarchs of the early French dynasties lived here, attracted by the proximity of the Chantilly Forest and its venison, and built a castle on the foundations of the Roman settlement. In 987, Archbishop Adalbero of Reims called together an assembly, and asked them to choose Hugh Capet as king of France. However, the monarchs of France soon abandoned the city, preferring Compiègne and Fontainebleau. New life was given to the city in the 12th century, and ramparts were built. The popularity of the city later fell, and it slipped into decline. Today it remains an attraction for tourists for its long history and its links to the French monarchy.

The town saw fighting in World War I, with the Germans occupying the town in early September 1914. The mayor, Eugène Odent was executed by the Germans along with six other civilian hostages: a tanner, a carter, a cafe waiter, a chauffeur, a baker&#x27;s helper and a stonecutter. In addition, the Train Station and Courthouse was burned down, along with other buildings. The town was later liberated that same year, by the French Army.

==Royal city==

Senlis fell under the ownership of Hugh Capet in 981. He was elected king by his barons in 987 before being crowned at Noyon. Under the Capetian rule, Senlis became a royal city and remained so until the reign of Charles X (1824-1830). A castle was built during this period whose remains are still visible today. The city reached its apogee in the 12th and 13th centuries as trade in wool and leather increased, while vineyards began to grow. With an increasing population, the city expanded and needed new ramparts: a second chamber was erected under Phillip II that was larger and higher than the ramparts of the Gallo-Romans. A municipal charter was granted to the town in 1173 by King Louis VII. The bishop of Senlis and the Chancellor Guérin became close advisors to the King, strengthening Senlis&#x27; ties to the French royalty. In 1265, the Bailiwick of Senlis was created with a vast territory covering the Beauvais and the French Vexin. In 1319, the town, crippled by debt, passed into the control of royalty. Senlis was devastated by the Hundred Years&#x27; War, but managed to escape destruction despite being besieged by the Armagnacs. Senlis&#x27; economy suffered heavily and would have to wait until the 15th century for another boom, during which many buildings were built or restored. In 1493, King Charles VIII of France, son of Louis XI, signed the Treaty of Senlis with the Duke of Burgundy, Maximilian I of Austria.

==Sights==
* The Senlis Cathedral is a Roman Catholic Gothic church and a French national monument. The Cathedral was the ancient seat of the Bishopric of Senlis, abolished by the Concordat of 1801, when its territory was passed to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Beauvais. The southern portal of the 16th century, the work of Martin Chambiges, marked the evolution of Gothic art. The cathedral was built between 1153 and 1519; its 256-foot-tall (78 m) tall spire dates from the 13th century and is visible across the plain of . Its transepts were rebuilt between 1530 and 1556 after being destroyed by a fire, while the side portals and shallow east chapels date from about the same period.
* The Ancient Royal Castle- priory Saint Maurice. The site has been occupied since the Roman era. In the course of the 4th century, the site was visited by the Carolingian kings. The current castle dates to the 12th century and was built under Louis VII of France.
* Hôtel de Ville Senlis has a plaque attached to honor the loyalty of Henry IV of France.
* The former St. Vincent Abbey was founded in 1065 by Queen Anne of Kiev and entrusted to the canons regular of the Abbey of St Genevieve in Paris, known as &quot;Génovéfains&quot;. The complex was transformed into a boys&#x27; boarding school by the Marist Fathers in the 19th century.
* The Museum of Art and Archeology contains notably rings found in a Gallo-Roman temple in the forest of Halatte.
* The Museum of the Hunts
* The Museum of the Spahis

== Culture==
In 1972, Senlis was made into a pedestrian town for a weekend in September, and this became a regular event, allowing the public to discover the gardens and hotels particuliers hidden behind gateways. The last gathering took place in 2007. The Garden Lounge takes place around April, and there is a Christmas march around the Church of Saint Peter.

The town was briefly captured by the Germans at the beginning of World War I. Several citizens were executed by firing squad in early September, including the mayor, Eugène Odent, who was charged with orchestrating “terrorist” civilian resistance — shuttering buildings for the convenience of snipers, failing to demand orderly submission from his neighbours and generally inconveniencing German troops. In 1931 the main street of Senlis was named after Odent.

In &quot;A Writer at War 14-18&quot; Édouard Coeurdevey describes the German destruction that he witnesses when visiting Senlis on 6 June 1915. On 8 June he wrote &#x27;Senlis bonde d&#x27;Annamites&#x27;.

<text>In the Russian political lexicon, a silovik (; plural: &quot;siloviki&quot;, ) is a person who works for any state organisation that is authorised to use force against citizens or others. Examples are the Russian Armed Forces, the Russian national police, Russian national drug control (GUKON), Russian immigration control (GUVM), the Ministry of Justice, the Federal Security Service (FSB), former KGB personnel, Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian General Staff (GRU), the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and the Federal Protective Service (FSO). This word is also used for a politician who came into politics from these organisations.

&quot;Siloviki&quot; is also used as a collective noun to designate all troops and officers of all law enforcement agencies of post-Soviet countries, not necessarily high-ranking ones.

The term &quot;siloviki&quot; (&#x27;siloviks&#x27;) is literally translated as &quot;people of force&quot; or &quot;strongmen&quot; (from Russian &quot;&quot;, &quot;force&quot; or &quot;strength&quot;). It originated from the phrase &quot;institutions of force&quot; (), which appeared in the early Boris Yeltsin era (early 1990s) to denote the military-style uniformed services, including the military proper, the police (Ministry of Internal Affairs), national security (FSB) organisations, and some other structures.

A similar term is &quot;securocrat&quot; (law enforcement and intelligence officer). Daniel Treisman in turn proposed a term &quot;silovarch&quot; (silovik and oligarch).

==Description==
&quot;Siloviki&quot; often wish to encourage a view that they might be seen in Russia as being generally non-ideological, with a pragmatic law-and-order focus and Russian national interests at heart. They are generally well educated and bring past commercial experience to their government posts. It is assumed that &quot;siloviki&quot; have a natural preference for the reemergence of a strong Russian state.

The &quot;siloviki&quot; do not form a cohesive group. They do not have a single leader and there is no common, articulated &quot;&quot;silovik&quot; agenda&quot;. However, according to John P. Willerton, these security-intelligence officials brought the work ethic and skills—that Putin apparently favoured—to the administration.

A former KGB general said that &quot;a Chekist is a breed... A good KGB heritage—a father or grandfather, say, who worked for the service—is highly valued by today&#x27;s &quot;siloviki&quot;. Marriages between &quot;siloviki&quot; clans are also encouraged.&quot;

==Persons and positions==

Senior &quot;siloviki&quot; under the presidency of Vladimir Putin include Sergei Ivanov, Viktor Ivanov, Sergei Shoigu, Igor Sechin, Nikolai Patrushev, Alexander Bortnikov, and Sergey Naryshkin who have had close working relationships with Putin and held key positions in Putin&#x27;s governments. Willerton points out, however, that it is difficult to assess if their common security-intelligence background translates into common political preferences.

Following the 2011 Russian protests, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, having made promises of political reform, nevertheless appointed several siloviki to prominent positions in the government: Sergei Ivanov to chief of staff of the presidential administration; Dmitry Rogozin to deputy prime minister; and Vyacheslav Volodin to deputy chief of staff.

Putin&#x27;s chief national security adviser, Nikolai Patrushev, who believed that the West has been in an undeclared war with Russia for years, was a leading figure behind Russia&#x27;s updated national security strategy, published in May 2021. It stated that Russia may use &quot;forceful methods&quot; to &quot;thwart or avert unfriendly actions that threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Russian Federation&quot;.

<text>Tattenhall is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Tattenhall and District, south-east of Chester, in the unitary authority area of Cheshire West and Chester and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. In the 2001 census, the population was recorded as 1,986, increasing to 2,079 by the 2011 census.

==History==
The settlement of &quot;Tatenale&quot; was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. 
The name is believed to be derived from the Old English personal name &quot;Tata&quot; and &quot;halh&quot;, meaning &quot;a meadow&quot; or &quot;nook of land&quot;. 
The spelling of the village has altered over the centuries: &quot;Tatenhala&quot; (1280), &quot;Tattenhall&quot; (1289), &quot;Tatnall&quot; (1473), &quot;Tottenhall&quot; (1553) and &quot;Tettenhall&quot; (1649).

The village was a self-sustained settlement in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. 
The building of the Chester Canal (now part of the Shropshire Union Canal) provided an economic boost to the village, improving transportation and allowing local produce to be exported. Tattenhall Road railway station opened in 1840 and linked Tattenhall to Chester and Crewe. 
Tattenhall railway station opened in 1872, linking the village with Whitchurch. The railways led to the establishment of industries including the manufacture of glue, gelatine, fertiliser and bricks.

Tattenhall railway station closed in 1957, as did the Whitchurch and Tattenhall Railway between Chester and Whitchurch. Tattenhall Road railway station closed in 1966. New housing developments saw the village expand through the second half of the twentieth century.

Tattenhall was a township and parish within Broxton Hundred, which became a civil parish in 1866. The population was recorded at 606 in 1801, 982 in 1851, 975 in 1901, 1,049 in 1951 and 1,986 in 2001. The civil parish was abolished on 1 April 2015 to form &quot;Tattenhall and District&quot;.

==Community==
St Alban&#x27;s Church is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. Parts of the building are thought to date from the early sixteenth century. Its benefice is combined with that of All Saints, Handley. St Plegmund&#x27;s Roman Catholic church in the village closed in 2012. Its 1970s building was demolished in 2014.

Tattenhall Park Primary School is a coeducational community primary school, teaching pupils aged 3–11. Older pupils travel to schools in Malpas and Tarporley for state-provided secondary education.

The village centre has a number of shops including a post office and butcher. There are three pubs in Tattenhall: The Sportmans, The Letters Inn and The Bear &amp; Ragged Staff. A number of buildings in the centre of the village are now used as offices. 
Within Tattenhall are several houses designed in 1927 by the architect Clough Williams-Ellis, famous for creating the Italianate village of Portmeirion in north west Wales.

Although agriculture remains an important element of the local economy, tourism has also become more significant. The Ice Cream Farm, owned by Cheshire Farm Ice Cream, is to the north of the village in nearby Newton-by-Tattenhall. Established in 1986, it is the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; ‘Largest Ice Cream Shop’.
The 300 berth Tattenhall Marina on the Shropshire Union Canal opened in 2009.

==Governance==
The unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester Council replaced Chester City Council and Cheshire County Council on 1 April 2009. The Tattenhall electoral ward includes the villages of Beeston, Burwardsley and Handley, stretching east to Tilstone Fearnall and south to Broxton. In the 2001 census, the total population of the ward was recorded at 4,374.

Tattenhall is within the parliamentary constituency of Eddisbury.

There are fifteen parish councillors for Tattenhall and District, with the most recent election taking place on 4 May 2023, although it was uncontested.

==Notable residents==
* Leslie Jones (1891–1962), cricketer
* Tommy Scott, frontman/songwriter of the Liverpool band Space, moved to Tattenhall in 2008
* Herbert Watkins-Pitchford (1868–1951), pioneer veterinarian working in South Africa, born and raised in Tattenhall
