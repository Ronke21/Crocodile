<text>James Iovine ( ; born March 11, 1953) is an American entrepreneur, former record executive, and media proprietor. He is best known as the co-founder of Interscope Records and became chairman and CEO of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M, an umbrella music unit formed by Universal Music Group in 1999.

Iovine has been involved in the production of more than 250 albums.

In 2006, Iovine and close friend, hip hop musician Dr. Dre, co-founded Beats Electronics. Two years later, the brand launched its first official set of headphones. In late 2013, they began development for Beats Music, and released it in 2014, which went on to become the framework for Apple Music. The company was purchased by Apple Inc. for $3 billion in May 2014. At the same time, Iovine vacated his positions as chairman and CEO of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records, ending his twenty-five year relationship with his label.

On August 21, 2018, after initial denial, Iovine parted ways with Apple and effectively retired from the media business. Despite his retirement, he is still credited or named in institutional education centers such as the USC Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy, which inaugurated in 2013, and the Iovine and Young Center, a magnet high school which opened in Los Angeles in August 2022.

==Early life and training==
James Iovine was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, to an Italian working-class family. His mother was a secretary and his father, Vincent Iovine, worked on the docks as a longshoreman. He has an older sister, born in 1946. The family lived in Brooklyn&#x27;s Red Hook neighborhood. His father died in 1985.

Iovine attended a Catholic school in Brooklyn, graduating from the since-closed Bishop Ford Central Catholic High School and went on to attend New York&#x27;s John Jay College of Criminal Justice. At age 19, he dropped out of college. He was introduced to music production after he met a songwriter who helped him find a job as a recording studio cleaner, and he soon began working as an engineer.

==Career==
===Music career===

==== 1970s–1980s: Music production and engineering ====
In the early 1970s, Iovine became a recording engineer, working with John Lennon and Bruce Springsteen, among others. By 1973, Iovine was a part of the staff, working for the now-demolished New York City faction of the Record Plant, where he worked on Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born to Run&quot; and Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;. He came to prominence through his work on Patti Smith&#x27;s album &quot;Easter&quot; (1978), which included her Top 40 hit &quot;Because the Night&quot;. He later collaborated with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on &quot;Damn the Torpedoes&quot; and U2 on &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;. Iovine also produced &quot;Bella Donna&quot; (the first solo album by former Fleetwood Mac member Stevie Nicks), &quot;Making Movies&quot; for Dire Straits, &quot;The Distance&quot; for Bob Seger and &quot;Get Close&quot; for The Pretenders.

Iovine served as sound engineer for the Voyager Golden Records, a pair of phonograph records that were launched aboard the Voyager space probes in 1977. His father&#x27;s death and love for Christmas inspired Iovine to record and oversee &quot;A Very Special Christmas&quot; in 1985. The compilation was not released until 1987 under Interscope&#x27;s future sister label A&amp;M Records. Iovine chose to not profit off the album and instead used the money from album sales to help fund Special Olympics programs. Following the release of the first album, ten more were produced. The initiative has raised over $145 million and helped more than 110 local Special Olympics programs. He was also responsible for supervising the music used in the 1984 romance film &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; and the 1988 comedy film &quot;Scrooged&quot;.

====1989–2014: Interscope Records====
In 1989, Iovine and Ted Field, founder of film production label Interscope Communications, co-founded Interscope Records. A year later, the label secured a distribution deal with Atlantic Records and garnered success with artists including No Doubt, 4 Non Blondes and Gerardo. Atlantic owned a 50% stock in the label. Iovine and Field signed Tupac Shakur to a recording contract as one of the first hip-hop acts under Interscope in 1991. A year later, Interscope became notable for providing distribution, initial funding and financial oversight for the highly successful Death Row Records. Death Row, founded by Suge Knight, operated as a subsidiary of Interscope, beginning with the December 14, 1992 release of label artist and producer Dr. Dre&#x27;s solo debut album, &quot;The Chronic&quot;. With singles consisting of &quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &#x27;G&#x27; Thang&quot; and &quot;Let Me Ride&quot;, both of which featuring labelmate Snoop Dogg, The Chronic managed to sell over five million copies in the United States and become Dre&#x27;s best-selling album in his career. Iovine and Dre would later form a personal friendship following the release of the Chronic through Knight. Over 19 million records sold from Death Row, the label was largely responsible for Interscope&#x27;s multi-platinum success throughout the 1990s. However, Snoop Dogg accumulated more success on Death Row and Interscope with his November 1993 debut, &quot;Doggystyle&quot;. It opened at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with the biggest first-week sales in 1990s hip hop. In November 1995, Interscope released &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; by No Doubt, which sold over 16 million copies worldwide as its single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot; made number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Radio Songs chart.

In September 1995, after internal conflict with Atlantic Records over controversy concerning the label&#x27;s support of gangsta rap, the label and its former parent company at the time, Time Warner made the decision to sell off its share in Interscope to Iovine and Field. In January 1996, Doug Morris, chairman and CEO of the music division of MCA Inc., convinced Iovine and Field to bring Interscope to the company in exchange for acquiring 50% of the label&#x27;s shares for $200 million. As a result, Interscope was placed in the same company portfolio of labels alongside future sister label Geffen Records, MCA Records, Universal Records and DreamWorks Records. By then, MCA was sold off by Matsushita Electric (also a parent company of Panasonic) to Canadian distillery and mass media conglomerate Seagram. With Interscope now under the MCA and Seagram shade, the label managed to gain more success with Tupac Shakur&#x27;s double album, &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;, which opened at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 566,000 copies sold in its first week. The album became another success for the rap division of the label and Death Row Records, where artist Dr. Dre felt uncomfortable due to founder and former CEO Suge Knight&#x27;s consistent spending, violent behavior and gang affiliation. As a result, Dre departed from Death Row and re-signed with Interscope through a new label deal, creating his own imprint called Aftermath Entertainment. The label&#x27;s foundation proved to be challenging, when on November 26, 1996, upon release, the compilation &quot;Dr. Dre Presents: The Aftermath&quot;, was given a lukewarm response as was The Firm&#x27;s &quot;The Album&quot;, despite the latter, released on October 21, 1997, almost a year after &quot;Dr. Dre Presents: The Aftermath&quot;, debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Iovine, as stated on the 2017 HBO documentary, &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;, was pressured by Doug Morris to either give Dre time to control his music and artists or drop him from his label. Iovine responded, &quot;We could that, but then, you would save my salary as well because I&#x27;m going with him.&quot; Interscope had further success with Tupac Shakur&#x27;s posthumous record &quot;The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory&quot; as well as Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot; and Bush&#x27;s &quot;Razorblade Suitcase&quot;.

Iovine offered to sign hip hop entrepreneur Master P and his imprint, No Limit Records, but he rejected the offer. Iovine allegedly threatened him and his management team that if they wouldn&#x27;t consider the Interscope deal, they would never &quot;find another deal in the industry nor in this town&quot;. In December 1996, MCA Music Entertainment was renamed Universal Music Group with Interscope and various other labels now being a part of the newly rebranded UMG.

Following Death Row founder Suge Knight&#x27;s probation violation and prison sentence in 1997, Iovine and Interscope ended their business relationship with Death Row; the final album released under the Death Row/Interscope deal was the soundtrack to the Tupac Shakur action film, &quot;Gridlock&#x27;d&quot;, which managed to reach the Billboard 200&#x27;s number one position.

In March 1998, Iovine invited Dr. Dre to his house to listen to the &quot;Slim Shady EP&quot;, released in 1997 by an underground rapper, who was participating a tournament of rap battles at the time, by the name of Eminem. The tape eventually landed in the hands of Interscope A&amp;Rs Dean Geistlinger and D.J. Mormile, who later turned it in to label co-founder Ted Field, who also sent it to Iovine for review. Upon suggestion from Iovine, he urged Dre to find Eminem and have him join the Interscope family through Dre&#x27;s label, Aftermath. Since then, Eminem has found success with both labels despite controversy involving his lyrical themes. On February 23, 1999, Eminem released his debut studio album, &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;, to critical acclaim. The album made its way to number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, helping to improve both Interscope and Aftermath after years of low sales.

On December 10, 1998, Seagram acquired PolyGram, and it merged with the Universal Music Group. After the PolyGram and MCA merger of Universal Music Group, Interscope became sister labels to new entries A&amp;M Records, Def Jam Recordings, Island Records, Mercury Records and Motown. In 1998, Interscope, Geffen and A&amp;M were put together under the umbrella label as Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records (IGA). Within IGA, Iovine and Field were hired to become the unit&#x27;s co-chairmen and oversee operations of Interscope and Geffen.

In February 2001, Ted Field parted ways with IGA, leading Iovine to take full control of the labels. In June 2002 of the latter year, Iovine was able to manage to negotiate Eminem and Dr. Dre&#x27;s joint venture agreement involving then-upcoming hip hop artist and fellow New Yorker 50 Cent. On February 9, 2003, he released his debut studio album, &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot;, to widespread acclaim.

Iovine was confidential in merging A&amp;M, DGC, MCA and DreamWorks into defection through Interscope Geffen A&amp;M between 1999 and 2003. Due to A&amp;M co-founders Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss (1935–2023) filing suit against Iovine, Interscope and UMG over a breach of agreement involving the label&#x27;s operations, A&amp;M Records had to remain fully operative as a one-off subsidiary of Interscope Records; the two plaintiffs were given a $200 million out of court settlement. At the end of 2003, Iovine made over $45 million in revenue generated from music sales from his label.

For the next four years, Iovine, Interscope and Geffen began to see extended success from other artists including D12, AFI, Nelly Furtado, The Roots, Gwen Stefani (as a solo artist), The Game, Robin Thicke, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, The Pussycat Dolls and plenty others. Iovine discovered Lady Gaga in 2007 who was sent to work with singer-songwriter Akon, who in exchange for his mentorship of Gaga, asked Iovine to sign her to Vincent Herbert&#x27;s Streamline Records and Interscope.

In 2014, Universal Music Group reported that Iovine was departing from Interscope Records, ending his twenty-five year tenure with the label and vacating his fifteen-year dual position as chairman and CEO of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records (now Interscope Capitol Labels Group, as of 2024). It was also confirmed that the Fueled by Ramen co-founder John Janick was hired as Iovine&#x27;s replacement. Janick was hired to become Interscope&#x27;s president and COO in 2012. The final artist Iovine signed to his label was J. Cole. On May 28, 2014, Iovine effectively vacated his CEO and chairman positions, while departing from Interscope. The news of his departure from the label occurred following the sale of his and Dr. Dre&#x27;s headphone company, Beats Electronics, to Apple Inc.

===Business career===

==== Beats Electronics ====
In 2006, Iovine teamed up with Dr. Dre to create Beats Electronics. It was originally a conversation between the two where Iovine exclaimed to Dre, &quot;fuck sneakers, we need to do speakers.&quot; The first set of headphones were produced in 2007 and were officially launched in 2008. From 2009 to 2011, Beats enclosed endorsement deals with Monster Cable and Hewlett-Packard. The company had captured 20 percent market share of the headphones industry by 2012. In January 2013, Iovine announced the expansion of Beats into the online digital music world with Daisy, a new service slated to launch in late 2013. Former Topspin Media executive Ian Rogers and Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor were said to be involved. In January 2014, Beats Music was developed and opened to the public after being announced on December 8, 2013. On May 28, 2014, Apple Inc. announced the acquisition of Beats Electronics. The acquisition gave Dre and Iovine a share of over $3.24 billion, becoming the largest acquisition deal in the history of Apple&#x27;s timeline. Iovine was hired to assume an undisclosed position at Apple where he helped in the creation of Apple Music, which was launched in the summer of 2015 as replacement for Beats Music. On June 26, 2018, Iovine and Dr. Dre were ordered to pay $25 million to former partner and creative designer, Steven Lamar, who sued the two co-founders for $100 million in unpaid royalties for designing the early Beats headphone models. The lawsuit was filed in 2015 after news broke out of Apple&#x27;s acquisition of the headphone brand a year prior. He was the creative consultant for Apple Music until August 2018. Firstly, he denied reports of him ending his partnership with Apple in January. Citing high usage of music technology and little direction to where Apple Music could be headed to, Iovine quietly left the company and effectively retired from the media industry.

==== Other ventures ====
In August 2022, the Iovine and Young Center, a magnet high school opened in Los Angeles. The school aims to improve the declining rate of enrollment in the L.A. Unified district.

In August 2023, it was announced that the Iovine and Young Center was partnering with Atlanta Public Schools to open a new learning center at Frederick Douglass High School in August 2024. The goal of the center is to prepare students for their future academics and careers.

In August 2024, Iovine and Dr. Dre announced they would partner with Inglewood Unified School District to open a new high school to help revive a district that had been forced to close schools due to declining enrollment. Regarding the partnership, Iovine stated, “We wanted to start in the inner city, because Dre and especially me, I owe a lot to the inner city of Los Angeles and we intend to pay it back.”

=== Film and documentary productions ===
In 2002, Iovine and former Shady Records president Paul Rosenberg co-produced &quot;8 Mile&quot;, which opened at number one in the box office and went on to gross more than $240 million worldwide. The film also garnered an Academy Award for Best Original Song for its theme song, &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;, making Eminem the first rapper to win this award. Additionally, Iovine executive produced the 2005 crime drama &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot;, named after the 2003 debut album of its leading star, 50 Cent. He also produced the 2009 documentary &quot;More than a Game&quot;, which centered on the life and career of basketball athlete LeBron James; his label Interscope released a soundtrack for the documentary.

===Television career===
In 2005, Iovine made a guest appearance as himself on &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Over&quot;, an episode for the fourth season of Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

From 2011 to 2013, Iovine was a mentor on Fox&#x27;s &quot;American Idol.&quot; Iovine&#x27;s protégés—Scotty McCreery, Phillip Phillips, Jessica Sanchez, and Candice Glover—released their music through Interscope. Iovine departed from the show in mid-2013; he was replaced by Randy Jackson.

In July 2017, HBO ran a four-part documentary about Jimmy Iovine&#x27;s relationship with Dr. Dre and other musicians titled &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;.

=== Voice roles ===
Iovine and Dr. Dre had provided their voices and motion capture performances in two downloadable content updates for &quot;Grand Theft Auto Online&quot; (2013); the first was 2020&#x27;s &quot;Cayo Perico Heist&quot; and the second was 2021&#x27;s &quot;The Contract&quot;, the latter of which the player helps to unlock unreleased music by Dr. Dre in between missions or after completing them.

==Philanthropy==
In May 2013, Iovine and Dr. Dre donated $70 million to the University of Southern California to create the USC Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation. The first class of the academy began in September 2014 with 31 students. On October 2, 2019, the USC opened the Iovine and Young Hall.

In April 2020, Iovine and Dr. Dre donated to the city of Compton to provide support for medical supplies, free COVID-19 testing, and 145,000 meals for residents of the city. In May 2020, Iovine and Dr. Dre partnered with restaurant chain Everytable to provide 30 days of drive-thru meals to Compton residents.

==Honors and recognitions==
In 2011, Iovine was honored by The Producers &amp; Engineers Wing of the Grammy Awards. &quot;This year we pay tribute to an industry leader, Jimmy Iovine, who has made an indelible impact as a recording engineer, producer, founder of Interscope Records, and now, entrepreneur focused on audio quality,&quot; Neil Portnow, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the governing body of the Grammy Awards, said in presenting the award.

On May 17, 2013, Iovine received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the University of Southern California and gave the 2013 USC commencement address.

In 2022, Iovine was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Ahmet Ertegun Award category.

==Personal life==
New York rock radio DJ Carol Miller and Iovine had a two-year relationship in the late 1970s. Miller says &quot;Jimmy had a wonderful, close-knit Italian Catholic family from Brooklyn and Staten Island who could not have been nicer to me. It was I, the Jewish girl from Queens, who always felt silently out of place.&quot; She says her father was not very nice to Iovine and was against the relationship due to the differences in their religions. According to Miller, the relationship ended in 1980, when Iovine began spending most of his time in California working with singer Stevie Nicks.

While producing her album &quot;Bella Donna&quot;, Iovine entered into a relationship with Nicks. The two eventually broke up in 1982. Nicks wrote the song, &quot;Straight Back&quot;, included in the Fleetwood Mac album, &quot;Mirage&quot;, about him. According to Nicks, Iovine was an inspiration for one of her signature songs, &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;. The song also became the backbone for the guitar sample used on Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s hit single, &quot;Bootylicious&quot; (2001). Nicks has said that Iovine&#x27;s despondence from the death of his good friend John Lennon overwhelmed her, and eventually led to the end of their relationship. However, the strong emotion of the time led to the creation of &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;.

Iovine was married to writer, lawyer, and model Vicki Iovine since 1985 before divorcing in 2006. It was finalized in 2009; the couple have four children.

In 2014, he started dating Liberty Ross, the sister of music composers Atticus and Leopold Ross. They were married in front of their Malibu beach house on Valentine&#x27;s Day, February 14, 2016, with friends and family in attendance.

On November 22, 2023, Iovine was accused of sexual harassment by an unnamed woman. On February 15, 2024, the accuser dropped the sexual abuse case with prejudice. Documents obtained by &quot;Billboard&quot; also revealed that while a summons notice was filed in November 2023, no official lawsuit had been filed against Iovine after the claim was made.

<text>A thermodynamic system is a body of matter and/or radiation separate from its surroundings that can be studied using the laws of thermodynamics.

Thermodynamic systems can be passive and active according to internal processes. According to internal processes, passive systems and active systems are distinguished: passive, in which there is a redistribution of available energy, active, in which one type of energy is converted into another.

Depending on its interaction with the environment, a thermodynamic system may be an isolated system, a closed system, or an open system. An isolated system does not exchange matter or energy with its surroundings. A closed system may exchange heat, experience forces, and exert forces, but does not exchange matter. An open system can interact with its surroundings by exchanging both matter and energy.

The physical condition of a thermodynamic system at a given time is described by its &quot;state&quot;, which can be specified by the values of a set of thermodynamic state variables. A thermodynamic system is in thermodynamic equilibrium when there are no macroscopically apparent flows of matter or energy within it or between it and other systems.

==Overview==
Thermodynamic equilibrium is characterized not only by the absence of any flow of mass or energy, but by “the absence of any &quot;tendency&quot; toward change on a macroscopic scale.”

Equilibrium thermodynamics, as a subject in physics, considers macroscopic bodies of matter and energy in states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. It uses the concept of thermodynamic processes, by which bodies pass from one equilibrium state to another by transfer of matter and energy between them. The term &#x27;thermodynamic system&#x27; is used to refer to bodies of matter and energy in the special context of thermodynamics. The possible equilibria between bodies are determined by the physical properties of the walls that separate the bodies. Equilibrium thermodynamics in general does not measure time. Equilibrium thermodynamics is a relatively simple and well settled subject. One reason for this is the existence of a well defined physical quantity called &#x27;the entropy of a body&#x27;.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics, as a subject in physics, considers bodies of matter and energy that are not in states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, but are usually participating in processes of transfer that are slow enough to allow description in terms of quantities that are closely related to thermodynamic state variables. It is characterized by presence of flows of matter and energy. For this topic, very often the bodies considered have smooth spatial inhomogeneities, so that spatial gradients, for example a temperature gradient, are well enough defined. Thus the description of non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems is a field theory, more complicated than the theory of equilibrium thermodynamics. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a growing subject, not an established edifice. Example theories and modeling approaches include the GENERIC formalism for complex fluids, viscoelasticity, and soft materials. In general, it is not possible to find an exactly defined entropy for non-equilibrium problems. For many non-equilibrium thermodynamical problems, an approximately defined quantity called &#x27;time rate of entropy production&#x27; is very useful. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is mostly beyond the scope of the present article.

Another kind of thermodynamic system is considered in most engineering. It takes part in a flow process. The account is in terms that approximate, well enough in practice in many cases, equilibrium thermodynamical concepts. This is mostly beyond the scope of the present article, and is set out in other articles, for example the article Flow process.

==History==
The classification of thermodynamic systems arose with the development of thermodynamics as a science.

Theoretical studies of thermodynamic processes in the period from the first theory of heat engines (Saadi Carnot, France, 1824) to the theory of dissipative structures (Ilya Prigozhin, Belgium, 1971) mainly concerned the patterns of interaction of thermodynamic systems with the environment.

At the same time, thermodynamic systems were mainly classified as isolated, closed and open, with corresponding properties in various thermodynamic states, for example, in states close to equilibrium, nonequilibrium and strongly nonequilibrium.

In 2010, Boris Dobroborsky (Israel, Russia) proposed a classification of thermodynamic systems according to internal processes consisting in energy redistribution (passive systems) and energy conversion (active systems).

==Passive systems==
If there is a temperature difference inside the thermodynamic system, for example in a rod, one end of which is warmer than the other, then thermal energy transfer processes occur in it, in which the temperature of the colder part rises and the warmer part decreases. As a result, after some time, the temperature in the rod will equalize – the rod will come to a state of thermodynamic equilibrium.

==Active systems==
If the process of converting one type of energy into another takes place inside a thermodynamic system, for example, in chemical reactions, in electric or pneumatic motors, when one solid body rubs against another, then the processes of energy release or absorption will occur, and the thermodynamic system will always tend to a non-equilibrium state with respect to the environment.

==Systems in equilibrium==
In isolated systems it is consistently observed that as time goes on internal rearrangements diminish and stable conditions are approached. Pressures and temperatures tend to equalize, and matter arranges itself into one or a few relatively homogeneous phases. A system in which all processes of change have gone practically to completion is considered in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. The thermodynamic properties of a system in equilibrium are unchanging in time. Equilibrium system states are much easier to describe in a deterministic manner than non-equilibrium states. In some cases, when analyzing a thermodynamic process, one can assume that each intermediate state in the process is at equilibrium. Such a process is called &quot;quasistatic.&quot;

For a process to be reversible, each step in the process must be reversible. For a step in a process to be reversible, the system must be in equilibrium throughout the step. That ideal cannot be accomplished in practice because no step can be taken without perturbing the system from equilibrium, but the ideal can be approached by making changes slowly.

The very existence of thermodynamic equilibrium, defining states of thermodynamic systems, is the essential, characteristic, and most fundamental postulate of thermodynamics, though it is only rarely cited as a numbered law. According to Bailyn, the commonly rehearsed statement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics is a consequence of this fundamental postulate. In reality, practically nothing in nature is in strict thermodynamic equilibrium, but the postulate of thermodynamic equilibrium often provides very useful idealizations or approximations, both theoretically and experimentally; experiments can provide scenarios of practical thermodynamic equilibrium.

In equilibrium thermodynamics the state variables do not include fluxes because in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium all fluxes have zero values by definition. Equilibrium thermodynamic processes may involve fluxes but these must have ceased by the time a thermodynamic process or operation is complete bringing a system to its eventual thermodynamic state. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics allows its state variables to include non-zero fluxes, which describe transfers of mass or energy or entropy between a system and its surroundings.

==Walls==

A system is enclosed by walls that bound it and connect it to its surroundings. Often a wall restricts passage across it by some form of matter or energy, making the connection indirect. Sometimes a wall is no more than an imaginary two-dimensional closed surface through which the connection to the surroundings is direct.

A wall can be fixed (e.g. a constant volume reactor) or moveable (e.g. a piston). For example, in a reciprocating engine, a fixed wall means the piston is locked at its position; then, a constant volume process may occur. In that same engine, a piston may be unlocked and allowed to move in and out. Ideally, a wall may be declared adiabatic, diathermal, impermeable, permeable, or semi-permeable. Actual physical materials that provide walls with such idealized properties are not always readily available.

The system is delimited by walls or boundaries, either actual or notional, across which conserved (such as matter and energy) or unconserved (such as entropy) quantities can pass into and out of the system. The space outside the thermodynamic system is known as the &quot;surroundings&quot;, a &quot;reservoir&quot;, or the &quot;environment&quot;. The properties of the walls determine what transfers can occur. A wall that allows transfer of a quantity is said to be permeable to it, and a thermodynamic system is classified by the permeabilities of its several walls. A transfer between system and surroundings can arise by contact, such as conduction of heat, or by long-range forces such as an electric field in the surroundings.

A system with walls that prevent all transfers is said to be isolated. This is an idealized conception, because in practice some transfer is always possible, for example by gravitational forces. It is an axiom of thermodynamics that an isolated system eventually reaches internal thermodynamic equilibrium, when its state no longer changes with time.

The walls of a closed system allow transfer of energy as heat and as work, but not of matter, between it and its surroundings. The walls of an &quot;open system&quot; allow transfer both of matter and of energy. This scheme of definition of terms is not uniformly used, though it is convenient for some purposes. In particular, some writers use &#x27;closed system&#x27; where &#x27;isolated system&#x27; is here used.

Anything that passes across the boundary and effects a change in the contents of the system must be accounted for in an appropriate balance equation. The volume can be the region surrounding a single atom resonating energy, such as Max Planck defined in 1900; it can be a body of steam or air in a steam engine, such as Sadi Carnot defined in 1824. It could also be just one nuclide (i.e. a system of quarks) as hypothesized in quantum thermodynamics.

==Surroundings==

The system is the part of the universe being studied, while the &quot;surroundings&quot; is the remainder of the universe that lies outside the boundaries of the system. It is also known as the &quot;environment&quot; or the &quot;reservoir&quot;. Depending on the type of system, it may interact with the system by exchanging mass, energy (including heat and work), momentum, electric charge, or other conserved properties. The environment is ignored in the analysis of the system, except in regards to these interactions.

==Closed system==

In a closed system, no mass may be transferred in or out of the system boundaries. The system always contains the same amount of matter, but (sensible) heat and (boundary) work can be exchanged across the boundary of the system. Whether a system can exchange heat, work, or both is dependent on the property of its boundary.

* Adiabatic boundary – not allowing any heat exchange: A thermally isolated system
* Rigid boundary – not allowing exchange of work: A mechanically isolated system

One example is fluid being compressed by a piston in a cylinder. Another example of a closed system is a bomb calorimeter, a type of constant-volume calorimeter used in measuring the heat of combustion of a particular reaction. Electrical energy travels across the boundary to produce a spark between the electrodes and initiates combustion. Heat transfer occurs across the boundary after combustion but no mass transfer takes place either way.

The first law of thermodynamics for energy transfers for closed system may be stated:

:formula_1

where formula_2denotes the internal energy of the system, formula_3 heat added to the system, formula_4 the work done by the system. For infinitesimal changes the first law for closed systems may stated:

:formula_5

If the work is due to a volume expansion by formula_6 at a pressure formula_7 then:

:formula_8

For a quasi-reversible heat transfer, the second law of thermodynamics reads:

:formula_9

where formula_10 denotes the thermodynamic temperature and formula_11 the entropy of the system. With these relations the fundamental thermodynamic relation, used to compute changes in internal energy, is expressed as:

:formula_12

For a simple system, with only one type of particle (atom or molecule), a closed system amounts to a constant number of particles. For systems undergoing a chemical reaction, there may be all sorts of molecules being generated and destroyed by the reaction process. In this case, the fact that the system is closed is expressed by stating that the total number of each elemental atom is conserved, no matter what kind of molecule it may be a part of. Mathematically:

:formula_13

where formula_14 denotes the number of formula_15-type molecules, formula_16 the number of atoms of element formula_17 in molecule formula_15, and formula_19 the total number of atoms of element formula_17 in the system, which remains constant, since the system is closed. There is one such equation for each element in the system.

==Isolated system==

An isolated system is more restrictive than a closed system as it does not interact with its surroundings in any way. Mass and energy remains constant within the system, and no energy or mass transfer takes place across the boundary. As time passes in an isolated system, internal differences in the system tend to even out and pressures and temperatures tend to equalize, as do density differences. A system in which all equalizing processes have gone practically to completion is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium.

Truly isolated physical systems do not exist in reality (except perhaps for the universe as a whole), because, for example, there is always gravity between a system with mass and masses elsewhere. However, real systems may behave nearly as an isolated system for finite (possibly very long) times. The concept of an isolated system can serve as a useful model approximating many real-world situations. It is an acceptable idealization used in constructing mathematical models of certain natural phenomena.

In the attempt to justify the postulate of entropy increase in the second law of thermodynamics, Boltzmann&#x27;s H-theorem used equations, which assumed that a system (for example, a gas) was isolated. That is all the mechanical degrees of freedom could be specified, treating the walls simply as mirror boundary conditions. This inevitably led to Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox. However, if the stochastic behavior of the molecules in actual walls is considered, along with the randomizing effect of the ambient, background thermal radiation, Boltzmann&#x27;s assumption of molecular chaos can be justified.

The second law of thermodynamics for isolated systems states that the entropy of an isolated system not in equilibrium tends to increase over time, approaching maximum value at equilibrium. Overall, in an isolated system, the internal energy is constant and the entropy can never decrease. A &quot;closed&quot; system&#x27;s entropy can decrease e.g. when heat is extracted from the system.

Isolated systems are not equivalent to closed systems. Closed systems cannot exchange matter with the surroundings, but can exchange energy. Isolated systems can exchange neither matter nor energy with their surroundings, and as such are only theoretical and do not exist in reality (except, possibly, the entire universe).

&#x27;Closed system&#x27; is often used in thermodynamics discussions when &#x27;isolated system&#x27; would be correct – i.e. there is an assumption that energy does not enter or leave the system.

==Selective transfer of matter==

For a thermodynamic process, the precise physical properties of the walls and surroundings of the system are important, because they determine the possible processes.

An open system has one or several walls that allow transfer of matter. To account for the internal energy of the open system, this requires energy transfer terms in addition to those for heat and work. It also leads to the idea of the chemical potential.

A wall selectively permeable only to a pure substance can put the system in diffusive contact with a reservoir of that pure substance in the surroundings. Then a process is possible in which that pure substance is transferred between system and surroundings. Also, across that wall a contact equilibrium with respect to that substance is possible. By suitable thermodynamic operations, the pure substance reservoir can be dealt with as a closed system. Its internal energy and its entropy can be determined as functions of its temperature, pressure, and mole number.

A thermodynamic operation can render impermeable to matter all system walls other than the contact equilibrium wall for that substance. This allows the definition of an intensive state variable, with respect to a reference state of the surroundings, for that substance. The intensive variable is called the chemical potential; for component substance it is usually denoted . The corresponding extensive variable can be the number of moles of the component substance in the system.

For a contact equilibrium across a wall permeable to a substance, the chemical potentials of the substance must be same on either side of the wall. This is part of the nature of thermodynamic equilibrium, and may be regarded as related to the zeroth law of thermodynamics.

==Open system==

In an open system, there is an exchange of energy and matter between the system and the surroundings. The presence of reactants in an open beaker is an example of an open system. Here the boundary is an imaginary surface enclosing the beaker and reactants. It is named &quot;closed&quot;, if borders are impenetrable for substance, but allow transit of energy in the form of heat, and &quot;isolated&quot;, if there is no exchange of heat and substances. The open system cannot exist in the equilibrium state. To describe deviation of the thermodynamic system from equilibrium, in addition to constitutive variables that was described above, a set of internal variables formula_21 have been introduced. The equilibrium state is considered to be stable and the main property of the internal variables, as measures of non-equilibrium of the system, is their trending to disappear; the local law of disappearing can be written as relaxation equation for each internal variable

where formula_22 is a relaxation time of a corresponding variable. It is convenient to consider the initial value formula_23 equal to zero.

The specific contribution to the thermodynamics of open non-equilibrium systems was made by Ilya Prigogine, who investigated a system of chemically reacting substances. In this case the internal variables appear to be measures of incompleteness of chemical reactions, that is measures of how much the considered system with chemical reactions is out of equilibrium. The theory can be generalized, to consider any deviations from the equilibrium state, such as structure of the system, gradients of temperature, difference of concentrations of substances and so on, to say nothing of degrees of completeness of all chemical reactions, to be internal variables.

The increments of Gibbs free energy formula_24 and entropy formula_25 at formula_26 and formula_27 are determined as 

The stationary states of the system exist due to exchange of both thermal energy (formula_28) and a stream of particles. The sum of the last terms in the equations presents the total energy coming into the system with the stream of particles of substances formula_29 that can be positive or negative; the quantity formula_30 is chemical potential of substance formula_31.The middle terms in equations (2) and (3) depict energy dissipation (entropy production) due to the relaxation of internal variables formula_32, while formula_33 are thermodynamic forces.

This approach to the open system allows describing the growth and development of living objects in thermodynamic terms.

<doc id="425865" wikidata="Q254488" url="?curid=425865" title="Mary Arthur McElroy">
<text>Mary McElroy (; July 5, 1841 – January 8, 1917) was an American woman known as being the sister of the 21st president of the United States, Chester A. Arthur, for whom she served as a hostess (acting as the first lady) for his administration (1881–1885). She assumed the role because Arthur&#x27;s wife, Ellen, had died nearly two years earlier.

McElroy was born in New York and attended the progressive Emma Willard School. She married insurance salesman John Edward McElroy and worked for some time as a teacher. When her brother Chester A. Arthur became president, she lived in the White House during winter months to host social events and care for her niece. As acting first lady, McElroy ended the tradition of suspending social events during Lent, and she held large weekly receptions. She was a popular hostess, and contemporary Washington social life celebrated her for her lively receptions.

When her tenure as hostess ended, McElroy returned to her family in Albany, New York, and she later worked in Ireland to preserve the Arthur family homestead. She handled her brother&#x27;s affairs during his illness and after his death, taking responsibility for his funeral and his presidential legacy. McElroy died in Albany in 1917. She is one of the most obscure first ladies, and relatively little scholarly research about her life exists.

==Early life==
Mary Arthur was born in Greenwich, New York, the last of nine children born to William and Malvina S. Arthur. Arthur&#x27;s mother, Malvina Stone, was born in Vermont, the daughter of George Washington Stone and Judith Stevens. Malvina&#x27;s family was primarily of English and Welsh descent, and her grandfather, Uriah Stone, fought in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Her father, William Arthur, was born in Dreen, Cullybackey, County Antrim, Ireland; he graduated from college in Belfast and emigrated to Canada in 1819 or 1820. Her mother met her father while William Arthur was teaching at a school in Dunham, Quebec, just over the border from her native Vermont.

McElroy attended the Emma Willard School Seminary in Troy, New York, intending to become a teacher. This school offered an education equivalent to that found in men&#x27;s schools; she was educated in history, geography, science, and French. At one point, McElroy taught at a private school in Edgecombe County, North Carolina. Little else is known about her career before her work in the White House. On June 13, 1861, she married John Edward McElroy (1833–1915), the son of William McElroy and Jane Mullen. John McElroy was a reverend and an insurance salesman who was the president of the Albany Insurance Company. They lived in Albany, New York, and had four children: May (b. 1862), William (1864–1892), Jessie (1867–1934), and Charles (1873–1947). She also assisted in raising the children of her brother Chester A. Arthur when his wife Nell Arthur died in 1880. She was close to Arthur&#x27;s daughter Nellie, encouraging her to pursue music in honor of her mother.

==Acting First Lady of the United States==
Her brother Chester was elected vice president in 1880, and he became president after the death of President James A. Garfield in 1881. In January 1883, President Arthur asked her to serve as White House hostess. As Arthur was a widower, there had been no first lady in the White House for the first year of his presidency. Her close relationship with Arthur&#x27;s daughter reaffirmed his decision to choose her as White House hostess. McElroy accepted the position, though she faced some reluctance, as she was a naturally shy person, and it would require her to leave her family in Albany. McElroy quickly learned the responsibilities of White House hostess, and she described herself when starting as &quot;absolutely unfamiliar with the customs and formalities&quot;.

McElroy began her role as acting first lady on January 24 when she participated in a diplomatic corps dinner. McElroy first hosted a reception of her own on January 27 and would host further receptions on Saturdays thereafter. As the nation was mourning President Garfield, Washington&#x27;s social life was not as active as it would have been. When the winter social season ended in March, a farewell dinner was held in her honor, and she returned to Albany. McElroy returned to the White House on January 1, 1884, to assist in New Year&#x27;s Day celebrations. McElroy then broke with the tradition of suspending social events during Lent, and she held weekly open-house receptions in the spring during which a hostess would be assigned to each room, culminating in an elaborate luncheon in the family quarters. McElroy also established the tradition of serving tea after White House receptions.

Arthur never gave McElroy formal recognition as a first lady out of respect for his late wife. Despite this, she proved to be a popular and competent hostess. Future First Ladies used the social function procedures she and her brother developed for decades. Her responsibilities typically involved hosting more formal events, as Arthur would host informal dinners himself if families were not attending. McElroy was noted for her hospitality while hosting, using a more personal style with guests. Her oldest daughter May and Arthur&#x27;s daughter Nell often assisted with these duties; the presence of children &quot;did away with any stiffness&quot; while she was working. When decorating the White House, she often incorporated gas light and heavy use of plants.

McElroy presided over many events and honored former First Ladies Julia Tyler and Harriet Lane by asking them to help her receive guests at the White House. McElroy also held a private luncheon for former first lady Julia Grant. As McElroy was not the president&#x27;s wife, McElroy had more flexibility regarding social customs and would attend social events in homes other than the White House. McElroy also declined to take up any causes or charity work as many first ladies had done. However, McElroy retained several benefits of her status as White House hostess, including use of the president&#x27;s box at the theater, transport on U.S. Navy ships, and access to the president&#x27;s retreat. While serving as White House hostess, supporters of the temperance movement would contact her to enforce a ban on alcohol in the White House, but McElroy declined to take such action.

Her final reception took place on February 28, 1885, one week before the end of the Arthur administration: 3,000 people attended (including Adolphus Greely), and 48 daughters of officials and the social elite assisted her. During the presidential transition period, McElroy befriended her successor Rose Cleveland, who would also be the sister of an unmarried president. They also had in common their hometown of Albany. On her final day as White House hostess, McElroy held a luncheon for Cleveland.

==Later life and death==

When Arthur left the White House, McElroy stayed with him in Washington for several weeks. Before McElroy left to return for Albany, Senator George H. Pendleton and his wife held a farewell reception in her honor. In 1886, McElroy traveled to Ireland to meet family and helped preserve the family homestead as a historic site. In February 1886, Arthur became critically ill, and McElroy left Albany to be with him. After his death later that year, McElroy arranged his funeral and became the legal guardian of his daughter. McElroy also took responsibility for his legacy, organizing his presidential papers and unveiling his statue in Madison Square. In 1889, First Lady Frances Cleveland invited McElroy to a White House luncheon as a guest of honor. McElroy and her husband were supportive of civil rights for African Americans and hosted Booker T. Washington at their home in Albany in June 1900. McElroy opposed the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, and was a member of the Albany Association Opposed to Women&#x27;s Suffrage. McElroy died on January 8, 1917, at the age of 75 in Albany and was buried in Albany Rural Cemetery.

== Legacy ==
McElroy has not been the focus of significant historical research. This is partly because of her limited time as a White House hostess and partly because of the relatively little scholarly focus on her brother&#x27;s presidency. Historians laud her for her quick adaptation to White House life and her talent as a hostess.

In 1982, the Siena College Research Institute asked historians to assess American first ladies; it included McElroy and several other &quot;acting&quot; first ladies. The first ladies survey, which has been conducted periodically since, ranks first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. In the 1982 survey, out of 42 first ladies and &quot;acting&quot; first ladies, McElroy was the 25th most highly regarded among historians. Acting first ladies such as McElroy have been excluded from subsequent iterations of this survey.

<doc id="425867" wikidata="Q5162550" url="?curid=425867" title="Conrad Keely">
<text>Conrad Keely (born 15 May 1972) is a musician, artist, and writer known primarily as the lead singer for the American rock band ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead.

== Background ==
Born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England of Irish and Thai descent, Keely grew up in the neighbouring town of Bedworth before he and his mother moved to the U.S. state of Hawaii when he was five years old. Keely and family returned to Bedworth when he was eight for three years before returning to the United States. In 1988, while in high school in Oahu, Keely met Jason Reece, with whom he would later form ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead. Keely then moved with his mother to Olympia, Washington in 1989 where he attended The Evergreen State College. Reece joined Keely in Washington a short time later, and the two tried forming bands in Olympia&#x27;s underground music scene. Finding little success, in 1994 Keely and Reece moved to Austin, Texas to form bands. Before signing a contract to Interscope Records with ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Keely primarily worked clerical office jobs in Austin while playing with the band at night.

Keely relocated from Austin to Brooklyn, New York in 2008, and then moved to Phnom Penh, Cambodia in 2012 after being &quot;fed up with American life.&quot; Keely visited the country while travelling with his father after an ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead Australian tour and decided to stay. Keely expressed being tired with America and moving overseas as early as 2003. Since moving to Cambodia, he has traveled around the country, performing as part of a cultural exchange. Although Keely does not speak Cambodian, he says the country is &quot;a noisy place full of weird sounds – temples, monks chanting, loud speakers blaring, egg sellers and vendors. I need that chaos, and I think it helps that it’s in a language I don’t understand.&quot; While Keely predominantly grew up in the United States, he holds and uses an Irish passport and is not an American citizen. Keely moved back to Austin, Texas in 2018 to maintain his Green card status.

== Work ==

=== ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead ===

Keely founded ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead with childhood friend and fellow musician Jason Reece in 1994 when the two moved to Austin, Texas. Originally planning to form two bands, with Keely on vocals and guitar with Reece drumming in one band and switching roles in the other band, the two soon settled on one band where they swap duties depending on the song. After initially a duo performing as You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, the two soon expanded the name and the lineup. ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead quickly became known for their &quot;anarchic&quot; live shows and their sound, described by &quot;AllMusic&quot;&#x27;s Jason Ankeny as &quot;an unlikely but powerful combination of punk fury and prog rock ambition.&quot; By 1998 the group signed with Trance Records and released their eponymous debut album. After a second independent album, this time on Merge Records, the band signed to major-label Interscope Records in 2001. The critically acclaimed &quot;Source Tags &amp; Codes&quot; was released in 2002, and since then the band had released six more studio albums.

=== Solo work and other bands ===
Keely released his debut solo album, &quot;Original Machines&quot;, on January 22, 2016 on Superball Music. Songs for the album were primarily written while traveling in Cambodia, but a few were written while on tour with ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, recording them in the back of the tour bus. On the sound of his first work without the band, while speaking with Steve Bell of Australia&#x27;s &quot;The Music&quot;, Keely said that he was &quot;given more freedom to explore other textures and stuff that I might not usually&quot; while having &quot;the liberty to create something that&#x27;s outside of [Trail of Dead&#x27;s] rock paradigm.&quot; He also plays wurlitzer and fiddle for Austin, Texas country-folk band Brothers and Sisters.

== Musical style and influence ==

=== Musical influence ===
Keely states in interviews that his biggest influences growing up were classic, progressive, and alternative rock; listening to bands like Pink Floyd, Rush, and The Replacements. The style and sound of the Trail of Dead album &quot;Tao of the Dead&quot; came from such influences, like Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;, Yes albums like &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; and &quot;Relayer,&quot; and Rush&#x27;s &quot;Hemispheres&quot;, with Keely telling William Goodman of &quot;Spin&quot; that &quot;I always liked listening to records that were just a continuous piece, like an orchestra or a symphony.&quot; Bandmate Jason Reece claims he got Keely into punk music and Keely makes the same claim for influence on Reece regarding prog, with the two swapping cassettes of music throughout school.

=== Musical style ===
Keely&#x27;s songwriting often shows the influence of progressive rock, as the aforementioned &quot;Tao of the Dead&quot; illustrates. Other songs often have political or social meaning characteristic of punk music; for example, the song &quot;Up to Infinity&quot; from &quot;Lost Songs&quot; about the Syrian Civil War and the first track &quot;Open Doors&quot; is about human trafficking in Cambodia. Many tracks on the album &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; are about social unrest in the United States after the attacks of September 11th and consumer culture, and Caryn Ganz of &quot;Spin&quot; described the writing on &quot;So Divided&quot; as &quot;lyrically bleak.&quot;

2014&#x27;s &quot;IX&quot; showed a change in Keely&#x27;s style to a much more introspective one in writing and sound. While never intentionally seeking to change musical direction, Keely says that he was going through &quot;a lot of personal stuff&quot; while writing the songs for the album and the result was a lyrically personal album. After moving to Cambodia in 2012, Keely fathered a son. He and the mother split up prior to recording &quot;IX&quot;, and Keely admits that the sense of melancholy and loss came into the album, with songs like &quot;The Ghost Within&quot; and &quot;The Dragonfly Queen&quot; reflecting these feelings and events. The title of the album, &quot;IX,&quot; also reflects these feelings, being a reference to the planet Ix from &quot;Dune&quot;, a harsh and cold world that served as a prison.

==Artwork and writing==

Keely is an avid visual artist. He claims he has been drawing his entire life and that he had an agent at the age of seventeen, displaying works at science fiction conventions. He studied art at The Evergreen State College but claims he &quot;didn&#x27;t learn anything,&quot; and that he quit art &quot;symbolically&quot; to focus on music, as he cannot quit something that is part of who he is. Keely considers himself a modern artist, and much of his work is inspired by comic illustration. He&#x27;s stated his admiration for comics, that &quot;they teach you how to draw.&quot; Keely is a fan of the X-Men and even noted that, as a reference to &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, he wanted to include a &quot;New Mutants&quot; character in the collage cover art of &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;. Despite his enjoyment of comics and the lowbrow art movement, he&#x27;s said he finds little emotion or enjoyment in modern art and that he prefers &quot;old art.&quot; Keely wrote an article for &quot;Filter&quot; magazine in 2003 titled, &quot;Modern Art is Shit,&quot; in which he lambasts the modern art movement. Keely noted that he received a considerable amount of criticism for the article.

Keely has commonly incorporated his drawings and paintings into Trail of Dead&#x27;s album art, designing and illustrating most all of their albums. He believes the cover art and album packaging for &quot;Madonna&quot; played a part in ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead being noticed by Jimmy Iovine, co-founder of Interscope Records, which lead to their major label deal. He has also done album art for other musicians and has displayed his art worldwide, including a show also featuring Melissa Auf der Maur.

Keely has been working on a science fiction graphic novel titled &quot;Strange News From Another Planet&quot; for many years. The story is &quot;portions of [Trail of Dead&#x27;s] mythology,&quot; and artwork, characters, and themes from the story have been included in the ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead albums &quot;Tao of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Lost Songs&quot;, and the &quot;Tao of the Dead III&quot; EP.

<doc id="425872" wikidata="Q588035" url="?curid=425872" title="Planet of Exile">
<text>Planet of Exile is a 1966 science fiction novel by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin, part of her Hainish Cycle. It was first published as an Ace Double following the tête-bêche format, bundled with &quot;Mankind Under the Leash&quot; by Thomas M. Disch. In 2017, the rights for a movie were acquired by Los Angeles Media Fund.

==Plot summary==

The story is set on Werel, the third planet of the Gamma Draconis system. The planet has an orbital period of 60 Earth years, and is approaching its correspondingly long winter. The main characters belong to one of two major groups: Wold and his daughter Rolery are members of the Tevarans, a tribe of humanoids indigenous to the planet. Jakob Agat is a young man from a dwindling colony of Earth humans that have been effectively marooned on the planet. The people do not accept the other group as humans, and they refer to it in several conversations during the book. The genetic difference is significant enough to prevent interbreeding.

The relationship between the two groups has long been tense and characterized by limited interaction. However, with the approaching dangers of winter and the group of the Gaal, they need to cooperate to save their people. It is the visit of curious young Rolery to the colony of Earth humans that becomes a sign that things are changing.

==Main characters==
;Alla Pasfal: A member in the Council of the colonist city of Landin. She is a frail elder but wise and sharp-witted.
;The Gaal: Nomadic native tribes who migrate south during the harsh Winter. They share a common language with the Tevarans.
;Jakob Agat Alterra: The de facto leader of the Council in Landin. He is a middle-aged, wise man, who, like all colonists, has bluish-black skin.
;Rolery: The protagonist of the story and a native of the planet. She has a precocious and independent spirit, and remains single, largely as a consequence of being born out of season. Like the natives of Tevar, she is light-skinned with golden eyes. She has the rare ability of mindspeech.
;Seiko Esmit: The last member of a great family line who lives in Landin. She is a middle-aged, delicate and nervous woman.
;Ukwet: One of Wold&#x27;s grandsons who happens to be older than Umaksuman. He ambushes Jakob Agat but is later killed in a duel with Umaksuman.
;Umaksuman: One of Wold&#x27;s spring-born sons who enjoys war and battle.
;Wattock: An Alterran bone-setter who works alongside Rolery to tend to those injured in battle.
;Wold: Rolery&#x27;s father. He is a wise, willful, and misogynistic tribal elder in the city of Tevar.

==Native fauna==
;Hann: Sheep-like animals that are domesticated to provide food and clothing for the Tevarans and the citizens of Landin.
;Snowghoul: Tall, thin, white-furred creatures with long necks that sway from side-to-side. They possess short but powerful clawed forearms and large snapping mouths lined with sharp teeth. They are quick, deadly, and hunt in packs.
;Stormbringer: Taloned, pure white birds with silver eyes and a wingspan larger than a man&#x27;s height. Their appearance in a southward migration signals the coming of Winter.

==Role in the Hainish Cycle==
The peoples of the various worlds in Le Guin&#x27;s space fiction are descendants of ancient settlements from Hain. For example, the Gethenians of &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; are believed to have been genetically engineered, as are several other peoples in the League of All Worlds. No such mention of genetic engineering of the Alterrans’ Hainish-derived predecessors is made in the story.

In &quot;City of Illusions&quot; descendants of the mixed Terrans and Tevarians described in this story return to Earth (Terra) and presumably, though it’s not depicted in the novel, later liberate it from alien conquerors who have the unexpected ability to mind-lie – which they used to telepathically conquer planets in the League of All Worlds, so this story is the backstory to &quot;City of Illusions&quot;. The reunification of the League as the Ekumen is mentioned in &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, but no story so-far published has given any details of the climax of the conflict.

A different planet, also called &quot;Werel&quot; in &quot;Four Ways to Forgiveness&quot;, is a completely different world from the planet of the Alterrans described in this story. The common word for &quot;world&quot; in the languages of both planets is &quot;werel&quot;, hence their common names just mean &quot;The World&quot;.

== Literary significance and criticism ==
One science fiction scholar points out that &quot;Planet of Exile,&quot; along with &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;City of Illusions&quot; exhibits Le Guin&#x27;s struggle as an emerging writer to arrive at a plausible, uniquely memorable and straightforward locale for her stories.

==Publication history==
&quot;Planet of Exile&quot; was initially published with no introduction, but Le Guin wrote an introduction for Harper &amp; Row&#x27;s 1978 hardcover edition. &quot;Planet of Exile&quot; was also reissued in 1978 along with &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;City of Illusions&quot; in a volume called &quot;Three Hainish Novels&quot; and in 1996 with the same novels in a volume called &quot;Worlds of Exile and Illusion.&quot;

<text>Sir Harold George Nicolson (21 November 1886 – 1 May 1968) was a British politician, writer, broadcaster and gardener. His wife was Vita Sackville-West.

==Early life and education==
Nicolson was born in Tehran, Persia, the youngest son of diplomat Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock. He spent his boyhood in various places throughout Europe and the Near East and followed his father&#x27;s frequent postings, including in St. Petersburg, Constantinople, Madrid, Sofia, and Tangier. He was educated at The Grange School in Folkestone, Kent, followed by Wellington College. He attended Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1909 with a third class degree. Nicolson entered the Foreign Office that same year, after passing second in the competitive exams for the Diplomatic Service and Civil Service.

==Diplomatic career==
In 1909, Nicolson joined HM Diplomatic Service. He served as attaché at Madrid from February to September 1911 and as Third Secretary at Constantinople from January 1912 to October 1914. In 1913, Nicolson married the novelist and garden designer Vita Sackville-West. Nicolson and his wife practised what would now be called an open marriage, with both having affairs with others of the same sex.

A diplomatic career was honourable and prestigious in Edwardian Britain, but Sackville-West&#x27;s parents were aristocrats who wanted their daughter to marry a fellow member of an old noble family and so gave only reluctant approval to the marriage.

During the First World War, Nicolson served at the Foreign Office in London during which period he was promoted to Second Secretary. As the Foreign Office&#x27;s most junior employee of this rank, it fell to him on 4 August 1914 to hand Britain&#x27;s revised declaration of war to Prince Max von Lichnowsky, the German ambassador in London. He served in a junior capacity in the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 for which he was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1920 New Year Honours. In his book entitled &quot;Peacemaking 1919&quot;, he expressed critical views including racial stereotyping about Hungarians and Turks during the peace treaty in Paris.

Promoted to First Secretary in 1920, he was appointed private secretary to Sir Eric Drummond, the first Secretary-General of the League of Nations, but was recalled to the Foreign Office in June 1920. The same year, Sackville-West became involved in an intense relationship with Violet Trefusis that nearly wrecked her marriage. As Nicolson wrote in his diary, &quot;Damn! Damn! Damn! Violet. How I &quot;loathe&quot; her&quot;. On one occasion, Nicolson had to follow Vita to France, where she had &quot;eloped&quot; with Trefusis, to try to win her back.

Nicolson himself was no stranger to homosexual affairs; he was openly, but not publicly, bisexual. Among others, he was involved in a long-term relationship with Raymond Mortimer, whom both he and Vita affectionately referred to as &quot;Tray&quot;. Nicolson and Vita discussed their shared homosexual tendencies frankly with each other, and they remained happy together. They were famously devoted to each other and wrote almost every day when they were separated because of Nicolson&#x27;s long diplomatic postings abroad or Vita&#x27;s insatiable wanderlust. Eventually, he gave up diplomacy, partly so that they could live together in England.

In 1925, he was promoted to counsellor and posted to Tehran as chargé d&#x27;affaires. The same year, General Reza Khan deposed the last Qajar Shah, Ahmad Shah Qajar, to take the Peacock Throne for himself. Though it was not entirely appropriate for a foreign diplomat&#x27;s wife, Sackville-West became deeply involved in the coronation of Reza Khan as the new Shah. Nicolson personally disliked Reza Khan and called him &quot;a bullet-headed man with the voice of an asthmatic child&quot;.

Reza Khan disliked British influence in Iran, and after being crowned Shah, he submitted a &quot;categorical note&quot; that demanded the &quot;removal of Indian &quot;savars&quot; [mounted guards] from Persia&quot;. The &quot;Savars&quot; had been used to guard the British Legation in Tehran and various consulates across Persia, and Reza Khan felt having the troops of a foreign power riding through the streets of his capital was an infringement of his sovereignty. As chargé d&#x27;affairs, Nicolson was in charge of the British Legation in the summer of 1926 and upon receiving the Iranian note, he rushed down to the Iranian Foreign Ministry to object. Nicolson writing in the third person stated he had a &quot;Kipling inside him and something of an &#x27;empire builder&#x27;&quot; told the Persian officials that the note was &quot;so categorical to be almost offensive&quot; and wanted it withdrawn. The Persians stated that the note had been written by Reza Khan and could not be withdrawn, but ultimately an annex was added to the note, which softened its threatening tone. However, much to the satisfaction of Reza Khan, the British had to abide by what Nicolson called a &quot;frank and honest&quot; note by withdrawing the &quot;savars&quot;.

In the summer of 1927, Nicolson was recalled to London and demoted to First Secretary for criticising the minister Sir Percy Loraine in a dispatch. However, he was posted to Berlin as chargé d&#x27;affaires in 1928 and promoted as counsellor again, but he resigned from the Diplomatic Service in September 1929.

==Political career==
From 1930 to 1931, Nicolson edited the &quot;Londoner&#x27;s Diary&quot; gossip column for the London evening paper, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, but disliked writing about high-society gossip and quit within a year.

In 1931, he joined Sir Oswald Mosley and his recently formed New Party. He stood unsuccessfully for Parliament for the Combined English Universities in the general election that year and edited the party newspaper, &quot;Action&quot;. After Mosley formed the British Union of Fascists the following year, Nicolson ceased to support him.

Nicolson entered the House of Commons as National Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Leicester West in the 1935 election. In the latter half of the 1930s, he was one of the relatively few MPs to alert the country to the threat of fascism. More a follower of Anthony Eden in that regard than of Winston Churchill, Nicolson was still a friend of Churchill but not an intimate one. Nicolson often supported Churchill&#x27;s efforts in the Commons to stiffen British resolve and support rearmament.

A Francophile, Nicolson was a close friend of Charles Corbin, the Anglophile and anti-appeasement French ambassador to the Court of St. James.

In September 1938 when Neville Chamberlain returned from Munich with his and Hitler&#x27;s signature on their &quot;peace&quot; agreement most of the MPs in the house rose in &quot;tumultuous acclamation&quot;, a few like Nicolson remained seated; the Tory MP Walter Liddall hissed at him &quot;Stand up, you brute&quot;. Other MPs to remain seated were Winston Churchill (who initially rose to catch the Speaker&#x27;s eye to speak), Leo Amery, Vyvyan Adams, Anthony Eden (who walked out &quot;pale with shame and anger&quot;).

In October 1938, Nicolson spoke out against the Munich Agreement in the House of Commons: &quot;I know that those of us who believe in the traditions of our policy, who believe that one great function of this country is to maintain moral standards in Europe, not to make friends with people whose conduct is demonstrably evil, but to set up some sort of standard by which smaller powers can test what is good in international conduct and what is not-I know that those who hold such beliefs are accused of possessing the Foreign Office mind. I thank God that I possess a Foreign Office mind&quot;.

In June 1940, Nicolson met the French writer André Maurois at the time when France was on the verge of defeat, which led Nicolson to write in his diary: &quot;June 12, 1940. I saw André Maurois in the morning. He left Paris yesterday. He said that never before in his life had he experienced such agony as he did when he saw Paris basking under a lovely summer day and realised that he might never see it again. I do feel so deeply for the French. Paris is to them what our countryside is to us. If we were to feel the lanes of Devonshire, the rocks of Cornwall and our own unflaunting England were all concentrated in one spot and likely to be wiped out, we would feel all the pain in the world&quot;.

He became Parliamentary Secretary and official Censor at the Ministry of Information in Churchill&#x27;s 1940 wartime government of national unity, serving under Cabinet member Duff Cooper for approximately a year until he was asked by Churchill to leave his position in order to make way for Ernest Thurtle MP as the Labour Party demanded more of their MPs in the Government; thereafter he was a well-respected backbencher, especially on foreign policy issues, given his early and prominent diplomatic career. From 1941 to 1946 he was also on the Board of Governors of the BBC.

In 1944, during the Battle of Monte Cassino, it was widely (but wrongly) believed that the Germans were using the abbey of Monte Cassino in Italy as an observation post to direct fire down at the Allied forces in the valley below: many demanded for the abbey to be bombed to save the lives of the Allied soldiers that were attempting to advance up the valley to take the heights of Monte Cassino, which was a key point in the Gustav line. In February 1944, Nicolson caused controversy with a column in &quot;The Spectator&quot; by saying that art was irreplaceable, but human life was expendable. He opposed the bombing of Monte Cassino abbey and said that it was a great work of art that itself contained many works of art that could never be replaced even if that meant the death of his own son, Nigel Nicolson, who was serving in the 8th Army as it was fighting the Battle of Monte Cassino, and that it was morally better to take thousands of dead and wounded than to destroy the abbey of Monte Cassino. Much to Nicolson&#x27;s chagrin, the abbey was destroyed by an American bombing raid on 15 February 1944.

When Nicolson, a Francophile, visited France in March 1945 for the first time in five years, upon landing in France he kissed the earth. When a Frenchman asked the prostrate Nicolson &quot;Monsieur a laissé tomber quelque-chose?&quot; (&quot;Sir, have you dropped something?&quot;), Nicolson replied, &quot;Non, j&#x27;ai retrouvé quelque-chose&quot; (&quot;No, I have recovered something&quot;). The exchange is little known in Britain but is well remembered in France.

After losing his seat in the 1945 general election, he joined the Labour Party, much to the dismay of his family, in an unsuccessful attempt to secure a hereditary peerage from Clement Attlee; Nicolson stood in the 1948 Croydon North by-election but lost once again.

In 1960, at the Paris summit, Nicolson wrote about the behaviour of the Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev implying that he was &quot;a little mad&quot; and the &quot;exchange of insults is not the best method of conducting relations between sovereign states&quot;.

==Writer==

Encouraged in his literary ambitions by his wife, who was also a writer, Nicolson published a biography of French poet Paul Verlaine in 1921, which was followed by studies of other literary figures such as Tennyson, Byron, Swinburne, and Sainte-Beuve. In 1933, he wrote an account of the Paris Peace Conference &quot;Peacemaking 1919&quot;.

Nicolson noted that &quot;although I loathe antisemitism I do dislike Jews&quot;. In his diaries, he expressed trepidation over making admission as a civil servant to the Foreign Office less exclusive: &quot;Jews are far more interested in international life than are Englishmen. And if we opened the service it might be flooded with clever Jews.&quot; Tony Kushner argued that he typified the antisemite who &quot;warned publicly against the dangers of antisemitism at any level, yet privately hated the very presence of Jews&quot;. Without evidence, he assumed in his diaries in 1944 that a group of girls relaxing with American GIs were Jewish: &quot;I am all for a little promiscuity. But nymphomania among East End Jewesses and for such large sums of money makes me sick.&quot;
Nicolson is also remembered for his 1932 novel &quot;Public Faces&quot;, which foreshadowed the nuclear bomb. A fictional account of British national policy in 1939, it tells how Britain&#x27;s Secretary of State tries to keep world peace with the Royal Air Force aggressively brandishing rocket aeroplanes and an atomic bomb. In today&#x27;s terms, it was a multi-megaton bomb, and the geology of the Persian Gulf played a central role, but on the other hand, the likes of Hitler were not foreseen.

After Nicolson&#x27;s last attempt to enter Parliament failed, he continued with an extensive social schedule and his programme of writing, which included books, book reviews, and a weekly column for &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

His diary has been described as one of the pre-eminent 20th-century British diaries, and a noteworthy source on British political history from 1930 to the 1950s, particularly in regard to the period before the Second World War and the war itself. Nicolson was in positions high enough to write of the workings of the circles of power and of the day-to-day unfolding of great events. His fellow parliamentarian Robert Bernays characterized Nicolson as being &quot;a national figure of the second degree&quot;.

Nicolson was variously an acquaintance, associate, friend or intimate to such political figures as Ramsay MacDonald, David Lloyd George, Duff Cooper, Charles de Gaulle, Anthony Eden and Winston Churchill, along with a host of literary and artistic figures, including C. E. M. Joad of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Brains Trust&quot;.

==Family==
He and his wife had two sons, Benedict, an art historian, and Nigel, a politician and writer. Nigel later published works by and about his parents, including &quot;Portrait of a Marriage&quot;, their correspondence, and Nicolson&#x27;s diary.

In 1930, Vita Sackville-West acquired Sissinghurst Castle, near Cranbrook in Kent. There the couple created the renowned gardens that are now run by the National Trust.

==Honours==
He was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1953 as a reward for writing the official biography of George V, which had been published the previous year.

There is a blue plaque commemorating him and his wife on their house in Ebury Street, London SW1.

<text>Brucellosis is a zoonosis caused by ingestion of unpasteurized milk from infected animals, or close contact with their secretions. It is also known as undulant fever, Malta fever, and Mediterranean fever.

The bacteria causing this disease, &quot;Brucella&quot;, are small, Gram-negative, nonmotile, nonspore-forming, rod-shaped (coccobacilli) bacteria. They function as facultative intracellular parasites, causing chronic disease, which usually persists for life. Four species infect humans: &quot;B. abortus&quot;, &quot;B. canis&quot;, &quot;B. melitensis&quot;, and &quot;B. suis&quot;. &quot;B. abortus&quot; is less virulent than &quot;B. melitensis&quot; and is primarily a disease of cattle. &quot;B. canis&quot; affects dogs. &quot;B. melitensis&quot; is the most virulent and invasive species; it usually infects goats and occasionally sheep. &quot;B. suis&quot; is of intermediate virulence and chiefly infects pigs. Symptoms include profuse sweating and joint and muscle pain. Brucellosis has been recognized in animals and humans since the early 20th century.
==Signs and symptoms==

The symptoms are like those associated with many other febrile diseases, but with emphasis on muscular pain and night sweats. The duration of the disease can vary from a few weeks to many months or even years.

In the first stage of the disease, bacteremia occurs and leads to the classic triad of undulant fevers, sweating (often with a characteristic foul, moldy smell sometimes likened to wet hay), and migratory arthralgia and myalgia (joint and muscle pain). Blood tests characteristically reveal a low number of white blood cells and red blood cells, show some elevation of liver enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and demonstrate positive Bengal rose and Huddleston reactions. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in 70% of cases and include nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, unintentional weight loss, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, an enlarged liver, liver inflammation, liver abscess, and an enlarged spleen.

This complex is, at least in Portugal, Palestine, Israel, Syria, Iran, and Jordan, known as Malta fever. During episodes of Malta fever, melitococcemia (presence of brucellae in the blood) can usually be demonstrated by means of blood culture in tryptose medium or Albini medium. If untreated, the disease can give origin to focalizations or become chronic. The focalizations of brucellosis occur usually in bones and joints, and osteomyelitis or spondylodiscitis of the lumbar spine accompanied by sacroiliitis is very characteristic of this disease. Orchitis is also common in men.

The consequences of &quot;Brucella&quot; infection are highly variable and may include arthritis, spondylitis, thrombocytopenia, meningitis, uveitis, optic neuritis, endocarditis, and various neurological disorders collectively known as neurobrucellosis.

==Cause==

Brucellosis in humans is usually associated with consumption of unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses made from the milk of infected animals—often goats—infected with &quot;B. melitensis&quot;, and with occupational exposure of laboratory workers, veterinarians, and slaughterhouse workers. These infected animals may be healthy and asymptomatic. Some vaccines used in livestock, most notably &quot;B. abortus&quot; strain 19, also cause disease in humans if accidentally injected. Brucellosis induces inconstant fevers, miscarriage, sweating, weakness, anemia, headaches, depression, and muscular and bodily pain. The other strains, &quot;B. suis&quot; and &quot;B. canis&quot;, cause infection in pigs and dogs, respectively.

Overall findings support that brucellosis poses an occupational risk to goat farmers with specific areas of concern including weak awareness of disease transmission to humans and lack of knowledge on specific safe farm practices such as quarantine practices.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of brucellosis relies on:
# Demonstration of the agent: blood cultures in tryptose broth, bone marrow cultures: The growth of brucellae is extremely slow (they can take up to two months to grow) and the culture poses a risk to laboratory personnel due to high infectivity of brucellae.
# Demonstration of antibodies against the agent either with the classic Huddleson, Wright, and/or Bengal Rose reactions, either with ELISA or the 2-mercaptoethanol assay for IgM antibodies associated with chronic disease
# Histologic evidence of granulomatous hepatitis on hepatic biopsy
# Radiologic alterations in infected vertebrae: the Pedro Pons sign (preferential erosion of the anterosuperior corner of lumbar vertebrae) and marked osteophytosis are suspicious of brucellic spondylitis.
Definite diagnosis of brucellosis requires the isolation of the organism from the blood, body fluids, or tissues, but serological methods may be the only tests available in many settings. Positive blood culture yield ranges between 40 and 70% and is less commonly positive for &quot;B. abortus&quot; than &quot;B. melitensis&quot; or &quot;B. suis&quot;. Identification of specific antibodies against bacterial lipopolysaccharide and other antigens can be detected by the standard agglutination test (SAT), rose Bengal, 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), antihuman globulin (Coombs&#x27;) and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SAT is the most commonly used serology in endemic areas. An agglutination titre greater than 1:160 is considered significant in nonendemic areas and greater than 1:320 in endemic areas.

Due to the similarity of the O polysaccharide of &quot;Brucella&quot; to that of various other Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. &quot;Francisella tularensis&quot;, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Salmonella urbana&quot;, &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot;, &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;, and &quot;Stenotrophomonas maltophilia&quot;), the appearance of cross-reactions of class M immunoglobulins may occur. The inability to diagnose &quot;B. canis&quot; by SAT due to lack of cross-reaction is another drawback. False-negative SAT may be caused by the presence of blocking antibodies (the prozone phenomenon) in the α2-globulin (IgA) and in the α-globulin (IgG) fractions.

Dipstick assays are new and promising, based on the binding of &quot;Brucella&quot; IgM antibodies, and are simple, accurate, and rapid. ELISA typically uses cytoplasmic proteins as antigens. It measures IgM, IgG, and IgA with better sensitivity and specificity than the SAT in most recent comparative studies. The commercial Brucellacapt test, a single-step immunocapture assay for the detection of total anti-&quot;Brucella&quot; antibodies, is an increasingly used adjunctive test when resources permit. PCR is fast and should be specific. Many varieties of PCR have been developed (e.g. nested PCR, realtime PCR, and PCR-ELISA) and found to have superior specificity and sensitivity in detecting both primary infection and relapse after treatment. Unfortunately, these are not standardized for routine use, and some centres have reported persistent PCR positivity after clinically successful treatment, fuelling the controversy about the existence of prolonged chronic brucellosis.

Other laboratory findings include normal peripheral white cell count, and occasional leucopenia with relative lymphocytosis. The serum biochemical profiles are commonly normal.

==Prevention==
Surveillance using serological tests, as well as tests on milk such as the milk ring test, can be used for screening and play an important role in campaigns to eliminate the disease. Also, individual animal testing both for trade and for disease-control purposes is practiced. In endemic areas, vaccination is often used to reduce the incidence of infection. An animal vaccine is available that uses modified live bacteria. The World Organisation for Animal Health &quot;Manual of Diagnostic Test and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals&quot; provides detailed guidance on the production of vaccines. As the disease is closer to being eliminated, a test and eradication program is required to eliminate it.

The main way of preventing brucellosis is by using fastidious hygiene in producing raw milk products, or by pasteurizing all milk that is to be ingested by human beings, either in its unaltered form or as a derivative, such as cheese.

Another important aspect of Brucellosis prevention is public awareness. People in endemic areas demonstrated a high lack of knowledge and understanding of the disease and its causes. To combat this, the One Health concept has been proposed. One Health is a method for combining disciplines such as public health, veterinary services, and microbiology to bring awareness to the disease. However, the implementation of this method faces many challenges including economic, political, and social barriers.

==Treatment==
Antibiotics such as tetracyclines, rifampicin, and the aminoglycosides streptomycin and gentamicin are effective against &quot;Brucella&quot; bacteria. However, the use of more than one antibiotic is needed for several weeks, because the bacteria incubate within cells.

The gold standard treatment for adults is daily intramuscular injections of streptomycin 1 g for 14 days and oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 45 days (concurrently). Gentamicin 5 mg/kg by intramuscular injection once daily for 7 days is an acceptable substitute when streptomycin is not available or contraindicated. Another widely used regimen is doxycycline plus rifampicin twice daily for at least 6 weeks. This regimen has the advantage of oral administration. A triple therapy of doxycycline, with rifampicin and co-trimoxazole, has been used successfully to treat neurobrucellosis. Doxycycline plus streptomycin regimen (for 2 to 3 weeks) is more effective than doxycycline plus rifampicin regimen (for 6 weeks).

Doxycycline is able to cross the blood–brain barrier, but requires the addition of two other drugs to prevent relapse. Ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole therapy is associated with an unacceptably high rate of relapse. In brucellic endocarditis, surgery is required for an optimal outcome. Even with optimal antibrucellic therapy, relapses still occur in 5 to 10% of patients with Malta fever.

==Prognosis==
The mortality of the disease in 1909, as recorded in the British Army and Navy stationed in Malta, was 2%. The most frequent cause of death was endocarditis. Recent advances in antibiotics and surgery have been successful in preventing death due to endocarditis. Prevention of human brucellosis can be achieved by eradication of the disease in animals by vaccination and other veterinary control methods such as testing herds/flocks and slaughtering animals when infection is present. Currently, no effective vaccine is available for humans. Boiling milk before consumption, or before using it to produce other dairy products, is protective against transmission via ingestion. Changing traditional food habits of eating raw meat, liver, or bone marrow is necessary, but difficult to implement. Patients who have had brucellosis should probably be excluded indefinitely from donating blood or organs. Exposure of diagnostic laboratory personnel to &quot;Brucella&quot; organisms remains a problem in both endemic settings and when brucellosis is unknowingly imported by a patient. After appropriate risk assessment, staff with significant exposure should be offered postexposure prophylaxis and followed up serologically for 6 months.

==Epidemiology==

=== Argentina ===
According to a study published in 2002, an estimated 10–13% of farm animals were infected with &quot;Brucella&quot; species. Annual losses from the disease were calculated at around US$60 million. Since 1932, government agencies have undertaken efforts to contain the disease. all cattle of ages 3–8 months must receive the &quot;Brucella abortus&quot; strain 19 vaccine.

===Australia===
Australia is free of cattle brucellosis, although it occurred in the past. Brucellosis of sheep or goats has never been reported. Brucellosis of pigs does occur. Feral pigs are the typical source of human infections.

===Canada===
On 19 September 1985, the Canadian government declared its cattle population brucellosis-free. Brucellosis ring testing of milk and cream, and testing of cattle to be slaughtered ended on 1 April 1999. Monitoring continues through testing at auction markets, through standard disease-reporting procedures, and through testing of cattle being qualified for export to countries other than the United States.

===China===
An outbreak infecting humans took place in Lanzhou in 2019 after the Lanzhou Biopharmaceutical Plant, which was involved in vaccine production, accidentally pumped out the bacteria into the atmosphere in exhaust air due to use of expired disinfectant.

According to Georgios Pappas, an infectious-disease specialist and author of a report published in the journal &quot;Clinical Infectious Diseases&quot;, the result was “possibly the largest laboratory accident in the history of infectious diseases.” According to Pappas, out of nearly 70,000 people tested, more than 10,000 were seropositive, citing figures compiled by the provincial health authorities in Lanzhou’s Gansu province. Pappas also states that Chinese documents show that more than 3,000 people living near the plant applied for compensation, an indication of at least a mild illness.

===Europe===
====Malta====
Until the early 20th century, the disease was endemic in Malta to the point of it being referred to as &quot;Maltese fever&quot;. Since 2005, due to a strict regimen of certification of milk animals and widespread use of pasteurization, the illness has been eradicated from Malta.

====Republic of Ireland====
Ireland was declared free of brucellosis on 1 July 2009. It had troubled the country&#x27;s farmers and veterinarians for several decades. The Irish government submitted an application to the European Commission, which verified that Ireland had been liberated. Brendan Smith, Ireland&#x27;s then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, said the elimination of brucellosis was &quot;a landmark in the history of disease eradication in Ireland&quot;. Ireland&#x27;s Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine intends to reduce its brucellosis eradication programme now that eradication has been confirmed.

====UK====
Mainland Britain has been free of brucellosis since 1979, although there have been episodic re-introductions since. The last outbreak of brucellosis in Great Britain was in cattle in Cornwall in 2004. Northern Ireland was declared officially brucellosis-free in 2015.

===New Zealand===
Brucellosis in New Zealand is limited to sheep (&quot;B. ovis&quot;). The country is free of all other species of &quot;Brucella&quot;.

===United States===
Dairy herds in the U.S. are tested at least once a year to be certified brucellosis-free with the &quot;Brucella&quot; milk ring test. Cows confirmed to be infected are often killed. In the United States, veterinarians are required to vaccinate all young stock, to further reduce the chance of zoonotic transmission. This vaccination is usually referred to as a &quot;calfhood&quot; vaccination. Most cattle receive a tattoo in one of their ears, serving as proof of their vaccination status. This tattoo also includes the last digit of the year they were born.

The first state–federal cooperative efforts towards eradication of brucellosis caused by &quot;B. abortus&quot; in the U.S. began in 1934.

Brucellosis was originally imported to North America with non-native domestic cattle (&quot;Bos taurus&quot;), which transmitted the disease to wild bison (&quot;Bison bison&quot;) and elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis&quot;). No records exist of brucellosis in ungulates native to America until the early 19th century.

==History==

Brucellosis first came to the attention of British medical officers in the 1850s in Malta during the Crimean War, and was referred to as Malta Fever. Jeffery Allen Marston (1831–1911) described his own case of the disease in 1861. The causal relationship between organism and disease was first established in 1887 by David Bruce. Bruce considered the agent spherical and classified it as a coccus.

In 1897, Danish veterinarian Bernhard Bang isolated a bacillus as the agent of heightened spontaneous abortion in cows, and the name &quot;Bang&#x27;s disease&quot; was assigned to this condition. Bang considered the organism rod-shaped and classified it as a bacillus. At the time no one knew that this bacillus had anything to do with the causative agent of Malta fever.

Maltese scientist and archaeologist Themistocles Zammit identified unpasteurized goat milk as the major etiologic factor of undulant fever in June 1905.

In the late 1910s, American bacteriologist Alice C. Evans was studying the Bang bacillus and gradually realized that it was virtually indistinguishable from the Bruce coccus. The short-rod versus oblong-round morphologic borderline explained the leveling of the erstwhile bacillus/coccus distinction (that is, these &quot;two&quot; pathogens were not a coccus versus a bacillus but rather were one coccobacillus). The Bang bacillus was already known to be enzootic in American dairy cattle, which showed itself in the regularity with which herds experienced contagious abortion. Having made the discovery that the bacteria were certainly nearly identical and perhaps totally so, Evans then wondered why Malta fever was not widely diagnosed or reported in the United States. She began to wonder whether many cases of vaguely defined febrile illnesses were in fact caused by the drinking of raw (unpasteurized) milk. During the 1920s, this hypothesis was vindicated. Such illnesses ranged from undiagnosed and untreated gastrointestinal upset to misdiagnosed febrile and painful versions, some even fatal. This advance in bacteriological science sparked extensive changes in the American dairy industry to improve food safety. The changes included making pasteurization standard and greatly tightening the standards of cleanliness in milkhouses on dairy farms. The expense prompted delay and skepticism in the industry, but the new hygiene rules eventually became the norm. Although these measures have sometimes struck people as overdone in the decades since, being unhygienic at milking time or in the milkhouse, or drinking raw milk, are not a safe alternative.

In the decades after Evans&#x27;s work, this genus, which received the name &quot;Brucella&quot; in honor of Bruce, was found to contain several species with varying virulence. The name &quot;brucellosis&quot; gradually replaced the 19th-century names Mediterranean fever and Malta fever.

Neurobrucellosis, a neurological involvement in brucellosis, was first described in 1879. In the late 19th century, its symptoms were described in more detail by M. Louis Hughes, a Surgeon-Captain of the Royal Army Medical Corps stationed in Malta who isolated &quot;brucella&quot; organisms from a patient with meningo-encephalitis. In 1989, neurologists in Saudi Arabia made significant contributions to the medical literature involving neurobrucellosis.

These obsolete names have previously been applied to brucellosis:
===Biological warfare===
&quot;Brucella&quot; species had been weaponized by several advanced countries by the mid-20th century. In 1954, &quot;B. suis&quot; became the first agent weaponized by the United States at its Pine Bluff Arsenal near Pine Bluff, Arkansas. &quot;Brucella&quot; species survive well in aerosols and resist drying. &quot;Brucella&quot; and all other remaining biological weapons in the U.S. arsenal were destroyed in 1971–72 when the American offensive biological warfare program was discontinued by order of President Richard Nixon.

The experimental American bacteriological warfare program focused on three agents of the &quot;Brucella&quot; group:
* Porcine brucellosis (agent US)
* Bovine brucellosis (agent AA)
* Caprine brucellosis (agent AM)

Agent US was in advanced development by the end of World War II. When the United States Air Force (USAF) wanted a biological warfare capability, the Chemical Corps offered Agent US in the M114 bomblet, based on the four-pound bursting bomblet developed for spreading anthrax during World War II. Though the capability was developed, operational testing indicated the weapon was less than desirable, and the USAF designed it as an interim capability until it could eventually be replaced by a more effective biological weapon.

The main drawback of using the M114 with Agent US was that it acted mainly as an incapacitating agent, whereas the USAF administration wanted weapons that were deadly. The stability of M114 in storage was too low to allow for storing it at forward air bases, and the logistical requirements to neutralize a target were far higher than originally planned. Ultimately, this would have required too much logistical support to be practical in the field.

Agents US and AA had a median infective dose of 500 organisms/person, and for Agent AM it was 300 organisms/person. The incubation time was believed to be about 2 weeks, with a duration of infection of several months. The lethality estimate was, based on epidemiological information, 1 to 2
per cent. Agent AM was believed to be a somewhat more virulent disease, with a fatality rate of 3 per cent being expected.

==Other animals==
Species infecting domestic livestock are &quot;B. abortus&quot; (cattle, bison, and elk), &quot;B. canis&quot; (dogs), &quot;B. melitensis&quot; (goats and sheep), &quot;B. ovis&quot; (sheep), and &quot;B. suis&quot; (caribou and pigs). &quot;Brucella&quot; species have also been isolated from several marine mammal species (cetaceans and pinnipeds).

===Cattle===
&quot;B. abortus&quot; is the principal cause of brucellosis in cattle. The bacteria are shed from an infected animal at or around the time of calving or abortion. Once exposed, the likelihood of an animal becoming infected is variable, depending on age, pregnancy status, and other intrinsic factors of the animal, as well as the number of bacteria to which the animal was exposed. The most common clinical signs of cattle infected with &quot;B. abortus&quot; are high incidences of abortions, arthritic joints, and retained placenta.

The two main causes for spontaneous abortion in animals are erythritol, which can promote infections in the fetus and placenta, and the lack of anti-&quot;Brucella&quot; activity in the amniotic fluid. Males can also harbor the bacteria in their reproductive tracts, namely seminal vesicles, ampullae, testicles, and epididymises.

===Dogs===
The causative agent of brucellosis in dogs, &quot;B. canis&quot;, is transmitted to other dogs through breeding and contact with aborted fetuses. Brucellosis can occur in humans who come in contact with infected aborted tissue or semen. The bacteria in dogs normally infect the genitals and lymphatic system, but can also spread to the eyes, kidneys, and intervertebral discs. Brucellosis in the intervertebral disc is one possible cause of discospondylitis. Symptoms of brucellosis in dogs include abortion in female dogs and scrotal inflammation and orchitis in males. Fever is uncommon. Infection of the eye can cause uveitis, and infection of the intervertebral disc can cause pain or weakness. Blood testing of the dogs prior to breeding can prevent the spread of this disease. It is treated with antibiotics, as with humans, but it is difficult to cure.

===Aquatic wildlife===
Brucellosis in cetaceans is caused by the bacterium &quot;B. ceti&quot;. First discovered in the aborted fetus of a bottlenose dolphin, the structure of &quot;B. ceti&quot; is similar to &quot;Brucella&quot; in land animals. &quot;B. ceti&quot; is commonly detected in two suborders of cetaceans, the Mysticeti and Odontoceti. The Mysticeti include four families of baleen whales, filter-feeders, and the Odontoceti include two families of toothed cetaceans ranging from dolphins to sperm whales. &quot;B. ceti&quot; is believed to transfer from animal to animal through sexual intercourse, maternal feeding, aborted fetuses, placental issues, from mother to fetus, or through fish reservoirs. Brucellosis is a reproductive disease, so has an extreme negative impact on the population dynamics of a species. This becomes a greater issue when the already low population numbers of cetaceans are taken into consideration. &quot;B. ceti&quot; has been identified in four of the 14 cetacean families, but the antibodies have been detected in seven of the families. This indicates that &quot;B. ceti&quot; is common amongst cetacean families and populations. Only a small percentage of exposed individuals become ill or die. However, particular species apparently are more likely to become infected by &quot;B. ceti&quot;. The harbor porpoise, striped dolphin, white-sided dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, and common dolphin have the highest frequency of infection amongst odontocetes. In the mysticetes families, the northern minke whale is by far the most infected species. Dolphins and porpoises are more likely to be infected than cetaceans such as whales. With regard to sex and age biases, the infections do not seem influenced by the age or sex of an individual. Although fatal to cetaceans, &quot;B. ceti&quot; has a low infection rate for humans.

=== Terrestrial wildlife ===
The disease in its various strains can infect multiple wildlife species, including elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis&quot;), bison (&quot;Bison bison&quot;), African buffalo (&quot;Syncerus caffer&quot;), European wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), caribou (&quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot;), moose (&quot;Alces alces&quot;), and marine mammals (see section on aquatic wildlife above). While some regions use vaccines to prevent the spread of brucellosis between infected and uninfected wildlife populations, no suitable brucellosis vaccine for terrestrial wildlife has been developed. This gap in medicinal knowledge creates more pressure for management practices that reduce spread of the disease.

Wild bison and elk in the greater Yellowstone area are the last remaining reservoir of &quot;B. abortus&quot; in the US. The recent transmission of brucellosis from elk back to cattle in Idaho and Wyoming illustrates how the area, as the last remaining reservoir in the United States, may adversely affect the livestock industry. Eliminating brucellosis from this area is a challenge, as many viewpoints exist on how to manage diseased wildlife. However, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has recently begun to protect scavengers (particularly coyotes and red fox) on elk feedgrounds, because they act as sustainable, no-cost, biological control agents by removing infected elk fetuses quickly.

The National Elk Refuge in Jackson, Wyoming asserts that the intensity of the winter feeding program affects the spread of brucellosis more than the population size of elk and bison. Since concentrating animals around food plots accelerates spread of the disease, management strategies to reduce herd density and increase dispersion could limit its spread.

=== Effects on hunters ===
Hunters may be at additional risk for exposure to brucellosis due to increased contact with susceptible wildlife, including predators that may have fed on infected prey. Hunting dogs can also be at risk of infection. Exposure can occur through contact with open wounds or by directly inhaling the bacteria while cleaning game. In some cases, consumption of undercooked game can result in exposure to the disease. Hunters can limit exposure while cleaning game through the use of precautionary barriers, including gloves and masks, and by washing tools rigorously after use. By ensuring that game is cooked thoroughly, hunters can protect themselves and others from ingesting the disease. Hunters should refer to local game officials and health departments to determine the risk of brucellosis exposure in their immediate area and to learn more about actions to reduce or avoid exposure.

<doc id="425895" wikidata="Q1546449" url="?curid=425895" title="Hellenic Army">
<text>The Hellenic Army (, sometimes abbreviated as ΕΣ), formed in 1828, is the land force of Greece. The term &quot;Hellenic&quot; is the endogenous synonym for &quot;Greek&quot;. The Hellenic Army is the largest of the three branches of the Hellenic Armed Forces, also constituted by the Hellenic Air Force (HAF) and the Hellenic Navy (HN). The army is commanded by the chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff (HAGS), which in turn is under the command of Hellenic National Defence General Staff (HNDGS).

The motto of the Hellenic Army is () , from Thucydides&#x27;s &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War (2.43.4)&quot;, a remembrance of the ancient warriors that defended Greek lands in old times. The Hellenic Army Emblem is the two-headed eagle with a Greek Cross escutcheon in the centre.

The Hellenic Army is also the main contributor to, and lead nation of, the Balkan Battle Group, a combined-arms rapid-response force under the EU Battlegroup structure.

==Mission==
The main missions of the Hellenic Army are the defence of the state&#x27;s independence and integrity, the safeguarding of national territory, and the decisive contribution to the achievement of the country&#x27;s policy objectives.

During peacetime, the Army has the following main objectives:

*The maintenance of high operational readiness for the prevention and effective confrontation of dangers and threats, as well as the ensuring of rapid response capability.
*The contribution to international security and peace.
*The contribution to activities of social aid and the support of state services for the confrontation of emergency situations.

==History==
===Early history: early 19th century===
The Hellenic Army traces its origin to the regular units established by the Greek provisional government during the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829). The first of these, an infantry regiment and a small artillery battery, were established in April 1822, and were commanded by European Philhellenes (such as Joseph Balestra and others). Lack of funds however forced its disbandment soon after, and it was not until July 1824 that regular units were reformed, under the Greek Colonel Panagiotis Rodios. In May 1825, the first law on conscription was passed, and the command of the entire regular forces entrusted to the French Colonel Charles Fabvier. Under Fabvier, the regular corps expanded, and for the first time came to include cavalry, military music detachments, and, with Lord Byron&#x27;s aid, military hospitals. 

The governorship of Ioannis Kapodistrias (1828–1831) saw a drastic reorganization of the national military: a Secretariat on Army and Naval Affairs and the Hellenic Army Academy were created, the Army engineering corps was founded (28 July 1829), and a concerted effort was made to reform the various irregular forces into regular light infantry battalions. Throughout these early years, French influence pervaded the Greek regular army, in tactics as well as appearance, as most of the instructors were French—at first Philhellenes, and later serving officers of General Maison&#x27;s Expeditionary Corps.

After Kapodistrias&#x27; assassination in 1831 and in the subsequent internal turmoil over the next two years, however, the regular army all but ceased to exist. The first king of the newly independent Greek kingdom, the Bavarian prince Otto, initially relied on a 4,000-strong German contingent. The royal government re-established the regular army and dissolved the irregular forces that had largely fought the War of Independence. Following the ousting of Otto in 1862, the Army continued relying on the Army Organization Statute of 1833. The Greek royal army in 1860 was approximately 200,000 men. The first major reforms were undertaken in 1877, in response to the Balkan Crisis that eventually led to the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. Among other measures, for the first time the Hellenic Army was briefly subdivided into divisions and brigades. Universal conscription was introduced in 1879, and under the premiership of Charilaos Trikoupis, in 1882–1885 major steps were undertaken to improve the training and education of the officer corps: a French military mission was called to Greece, new schools were founded and Greek officers were sent abroad for studies, and efforts were made to make officers on active service refrain from participating in politics and focus on their professional duties. The Army also underwent its first mobilizations, in July 1880 – April 1882 due to the Greek annexation of Thessaly, and again in September 1885 – May 1886, when Bulgaria annexed Eastern Rumelia. The great financial burden of these long periods of mobilization, however, exhausted the public treasury, and stalled the reform process. The result was that the Hellenic Army was wholly unprepared for war on the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War of 1897: plans, fortifications and weapons were non-existent, the mass of the officer corps was unsuited to its tasks, and training was inadequate. As a result, the numerically superior, better organized, equipped and led Ottoman forces pushed the Greek forces south out of Thessaly.

===Decade of wars: 1912–1922===


The dismal performance of the Hellenic Army in the war of 1897 led to a major reform programme under the administration of Georgios Theotokis (1899–1901, 1903–1904 and 1906–1909). A new Army Organization Statute was issued in 1904 (revised in 1910), purchases of new artillery material (including the 75 mm Schneider-Danglis 06/09 gun) and of the Mannlicher–Schönauer rifle were made, and a new, khaki field uniform was introduced in 1908. Reform was accelerated after the Goudi coup of 1909.

The new government under Eleftherios Venizelos brought a French military mission to train the Hellenic Army. Under its supervision, the Greeks had adopted the triangular infantry division as their main formation, but more importantly, the overhaul of the mobilization system allowed the country to field and equip a far greater number of troops than it had in 1897: while foreign observers estimated a mobilized force of approximately 50,000 men, the Army eventually fielded 125,000, with another 140,000 in the National Guard and reserves.

After the victorious Balkan Wars, the country doubled its territory. During the WWI, a disagreement between King Constantine and Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos caused a National Schism, but eventually a united Greece joined in 1917 the Allies.

As a winner of the war, Greece annexed Western and Eastern Thrace and landed units in 1919 at Asia Minor, starting so the Greco-Turkish War (1919-22), which was unsuccessful for Greece, in 1922.

===World War II, Civil War, and Korea===
The country joined WWII with the Allies side in October 1940, when dictator Ioannis Metaxas rejected an Italian ultimatum by Mussolini. In the Greco-Italian War, the Hellenic Army pushed back the Italian and occupied large parts of southern Albania, but after a German invasion (Battle of Greece) fell under the Axis domination.

Leo Niehorster&#x27;s website shows the higher organisation of the Greek Army on 15 August 1940, with the General Staff of the Army directly supervising five corps, three divisions, and the Thessaloniki Fortress.

The exiled Greek government, with units of the Army, were transferred to the Middle East, where they continued the war with the Allies as the Greek Armed Forces in the Middle East. The Sacred Band and the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade were formed in exile, and took part in various operations; including the Tunisian campaign and the Battle of Rimini (1944).

After the war, Greece incorporated the Dodecanese. Soon, the political polarization between communist (or leftist) and anticommunist forces, led to a three-and-a-half-year-long civil war, which ended with communist defeat.

The Greek Expeditionary Force took part in the Korean War with a total of 10,255 Greek personnel, of whom 186 or 187 were killed and 617 were wounded.

The army was briefly renamed &quot;Royal Hellenic Army&quot; from August 20th, to October 25th, 1964, on the initiative of then Minister of National Defence Petros Garoufalias.

***2nd Deputy-of-Staff of the Army&lt;br&gt;Β&#x27; Υπαρχηγός ΓΕΣ

===Combat and support arms===
*Most combat arms are called &quot;Arm&quot; (Όπλον). This term denotes army elements that, more or less, have direct participation in combat.
*Most support branches are called &quot;Corps&quot; (Σώμα), with some exceptions.

==Army units and formations==

After a major reorganization which occurred in the last decade, which included the transformation of most Infantry formations into Mechanized Brigades and a parallel reduction of personnel, the Hellenic Army&#x27;s higher command is the Hellenic Army General Staff.

There are four major military commands which supervise all army units,
* 1st Army, based at Larissa, that includes the IV Army Corps, responsible for the defence of the northern and eastern borders.
* Supreme Military Command of the Interior and Islands, based at Athens with the mission to provide cover for the islands in the Aegean Sea.
* Supreme Military Support Command undertaking various logistics and organizational tasks.
* NATO Deployable Corps, based at Thessaloniki, Macedonia

Although divisions still exist, having the role of forward commands, the Army is mainly organized in brigades, that follow the typical NATO standards consisting of five battalions, three manoeuvre, one artillery, one support and some other company sized formations. According to the latest developments, up to 2015, all active divisions will dissolve, but all brigades will acquire one more manoeuvre battalion, largely eliminating the distinction between mechanized and armoured formations, thus creating a new type brigade, which will be named &quot;Strike Brigade&quot;.

==Personnel==

There are three classes of personnel in the Hellenic Army, namely professional, volunteer and conscript. There are currently 90,000 personnel on active duty, of which 30,000 are conscripted. The Hellenic Republic has mandatory military service (conscription) as of March 2021 of 12 months for all males between the ages of 18 and 45. Citizens discharged from active service are normally placed in the Reserve and are subject to periodic recall of 1–10 days at irregular intervals. Greek males between the age of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may also be required to serve part-time in the National Guard. During a mobilization the amount of conscripts may exceed 180,000.

Conscript enlisted men and non-commissioned officers wear special rank insignia to differentiate them from volunteers.

Professional officers graduate from the Evelpidon Military Academy in Athens (&quot;Στρατιωτική Σχολή Ευελπίδων&quot;, ), the Corps Officers Military Academy in Thessaloniki (&quot;Στρατιωτική Σχολή Αξιωματικών Σωμάτων,&quot; ) and the Non-Commissioned Officers Academy (&quot;Σχολή Μονίμων Υπαξιωματικών&quot;) in Trikala. Unlike what the title of the latter suggests, ΣΜΥ graduates do comprise a large part of the officer corps and are able to advance to the rank of lieutenant colonel, starting at the rank of corporal, while their ΣΣΕ and ΣΣΑΣ counterparts graduate as second lieutenants and could, theoretically, attain flag officer ranks.

Thus, in the chain of command, graduates of the two military academies in Athens and Thessaloniki are considered higher in seniority compared to professional officers of the same rank who graduated from Trikala. The latter officers are followed in seniority by volunteer and finally conscript staff.

During war, the Hellenic army battalions are commanded by either a ranking officer major general or if in a combat mission by another state which in agreement with the Greek state will be commanded by a ranking General of their own.

===Ranks===

====Commissioned officer ranks====
The rank insignia of commissioned officers.
====Other ranks====
The rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.
==Equipment==

The heavy equipment and weaponry of the Hellenic Army is mostly of foreign manufacture, from German, French, Italian, American, British and Russian suppliers. A notable exception is the indigenous Leonidas armoured personnel carrier which was built by the Hellenic Vehicles Manufacturer Industry ELVO, such as the ELVO Kentaurus fighting vehicle.

Equipment runs the gamut from state-of-the art to obsolete Cold War inventories; the latter are gradually being retired.

==Uniforms and ranks==
The structure of Hellenic Army ranks has its roots in British military traditions and follows NATO standard rank scale. The rank of &quot;Stratarchis&quot; (Στρατάρχης, equivalent to Field Marshal or General of the Army) though, has been historically used, but is no longer extant. It was first awarded to King Constantine I for his leadership in the Balkan Wars. The rank was subsequently assumed by his successors upon accession, until the abolition of the monarchy. The only regular officer to have been awarded the rank was General Alexander Papagos on 28 October 1949, after he had won the Greek Civil War.

<text>The Hellenic Navy (HN; , abbreviated ΠΝ) is the naval force of Greece, part of the Hellenic Armed Forces. The modern Greek navy historically hails from the naval forces of various Aegean Islands, which fought in the Greek War of Independence. During the periods of monarchy (1833–1924 and 1936–1973) it was known as the Royal Hellenic Navy (, , abbreviated ΒΝ).

The Hellenic Navy is a Green-water navy. The total displacement of the fleet is approximately 150,000 tons. The HN also operates a number of naval aviation units.

The motto of the Hellenic Navy is &quot;Μέγα τὸ τῆς θαλάσσης κράτος&quot; from Thucydides&#x27; account of Pericles&#x27; oration on the eve of the Peloponnesian War. This has been translated as &quot;The rule of the sea is a great matter&quot;. The Hellenic Navy&#x27;s emblem consists of an anchor in front of a crossed Christian cross and trident, with the cross symbolizing Greek Orthodoxy, and the trident symbolizing Poseidon, the god of the sea in Greek mythology. Pericles&#x27; words are written across the top of the emblem.

==History==
The history of the Hellenic Navy begins with the birth of modern Greece, and due to the maritime nature of the country, it has always featured prominently in modern Greece&#x27;s military history.

===The Navy during the Revolution (1821–1830)===
At the beginning of the Greek War of Independence, the naval forces of the Greeks consisted primarily of the merchant fleet of the Saronic islanders from Hydra, Spetsai and Poros and also the islanders of Psara and Samos. The fleet was of crucial importance to the success of the revolution. Its goal was to prevent as much as possible the Ottoman Navy from resupplying the isolated Ottoman garrisons and land reinforcements from the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Asian provinces.

Although Greek crews were experienced seamen, the light Greek ships, mostly armed merchantmen, were unable to stand up to the large Ottoman ships of the line in direct combat. So the Greeks conducted the equivalent of modern-day naval special operations, resorting to the use of fireships ( or ), with great success. It was in the use of such ships that courageous seamen like Konstantinos Kanaris won international renown. Under the leadership of capable admirals, most prominently Andreas Miaoulis from Hydra, the Greek fleet achieved early victories, guaranteeing the survival of the revolution in the mainland.

However, as Greeks became embroiled in civil wars, the Sultan called upon his strongest subject, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, for aid. Plagued by internal strife and financial difficulties in keeping the fleet in constant readiness, the Greeks failed to prevent the capture and destruction of Kasos and Psara in 1824, or the landing of the Egyptian army at Modon. Despite victories at Samos and Gerontas, the Revolution was threatened with collapse until the intervention of the Great Powers in the Battle of Navarino in 1827. There the Egypto-Ottoman fleet was decisively defeated by the combined fleets of the Britain, France and the Russian Empire, effectively securing the independence of Greece.

When Ioannis Capodistrias became governor of newly liberated Greece in 1828, the Greek fleet consisted of few remaining ships, which had participated in the war for independence. The first minister of &quot;Naval affairs&quot; was Konstantinos Kanaris, and the most powerful ship of the fleet at that time, the frigate &quot;Hellas&quot;, had been constructed in the United States in 1825. The Hellenic Navy established its headquarters at the island of Poros and the building of a new series of ships began at the naval base, while old ships were gradually being retired. Furthermore, continuous efforts towards the education of officers were initiated. Young people were initially trained at the military school of Scholi Evelpidon and afterwards they were transferred to the navy, as there was no such thing as a Naval Academy.

In 1831, Greece descended into anarchy with numerous areas, including Mani and Hydra, in revolt. It was during this revolt that the flagship &quot;Hellas&quot;, docked at Poros, was set on fire by Admiral Andreas Miaoulis. Capodistrias was assassinated a few months after.

===The Royal Hellenic Navy of King Otto (1830–1860)===
When the new King Otto arrived in the Greek capital, Nafplion, in 1832 aboard the British warship HMS &quot;Madagascar&quot;, the Greek fleet consisted of one corvette, three brigs, six schooners, two gunboats, two steamboats and a few more small vessels. The first naval school was founded in 1846 on the corvette &quot;Loudovikos&quot; and Leonidas Palaskas was assigned as its director. However, the inefficient training of the officers, coupled with conflict between those who pursued modernization and those who were stalwarts of the traditions of the veterans of the struggle for independence, resulted in a restricted and inefficient navy, which was limited to policing the sea and the pursuit of pirates.

During the 1850s, the more progressive elements of the navy won out and the fleet was augmented with more ships. In 1855, the first iron propeller-driven ships were ordered from England. These were the steamships &#x27;, &quot;Pliksavra&quot;, &#x27;, and &quot;Sfendoni&quot;.

===Growth of the Navy under King George (1860–1910)===

On October 29, 1863, following an enthronement ceremony in his native Copenhagen and a tour of several of the European capitals, Prince Wilhelm of Denmark arrived aboard the Greek flagship &quot;Hellas&quot;, to take up the throne as King George I of Greece. During the 1866 Cretan revolt, the Royal Hellenic Navy ships were in no condition to support it. Such failure led to the government awakening to the problem of naval insufficiency and the adoption of a policy stating that: &quot;The navy, as it represents a necessary weapon for Greece, should only be created for war and aim to victory.&quot; Because of this, the fleet was supplied with new and bigger ships, reflecting a number of innovations including the use of iron in shipbuilding industry and the invention of the torpedo; with these advances, the effectiveness and the appearance of the Hellenic Navy changed.

Meanwhile, after 1878, because of the Russo-Turkish War and the need to expand the Greek navy, a new and larger naval base was established in the area of Faneromeni of Salamis and a few years later it was transferred to the area of Arapis where it remains today. At the same time the Naval Academy was founded and Ilias Kanellopoulos was made Director. A French naval mission, headed by Admiral , introduced a new, advanced naval organization and the methodological training of enlisted personnel through the establishment of a training school in the old building of the naval base in Poros. During the government of Charilaos Trikoupis in 1889, the fleet was further increased with the acquisition of new battleships: &quot;Hydra&quot;, &quot;Spetsai&quot;, and &quot;Psara&quot; from France. Thus, when Greece went to war in the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, the Hellenic Navy established its dominance in the Aegean Sea. However, it was unable to change the outcome of the war on land, which was a national humiliation.

In 1907, the Hellenic Navy General Staff () was founded, with then-Captain Pavlos Kountouriotis as its first head. After the war, in 1897, the Ottoman Empire embarked on a program of naval expansion for its fleet and as a response to that, in 1909, the cruiser &quot;Georgios Averof&quot; was bought from Italy. In 1910, a British naval mission arrived, headed by Admiral Lionel Grant Tufnell, in order to recommend improvements in the organization and training of the navy. The mission led to the adoption of the British style of management, organization and training, especially in the area of strategy.

===Balkan Wars (1912–1913)===

Shortly before the Balkan Wars, the Navy was composed of a fleet of destroyers and battleships. Its mission was primarily offensive, aiming to capture the Ottoman-held islands of the Eastern Aegean and establish naval supremacy. To that end, its commander-in-chief, Rear Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, established a forward base at the Moudros bay at Lemnos, directly opposite the Dardanelles straits. After defeating the two Turkish sallies from the Straits at Elli (December 1912) and Lemnos (January 1913), the Aegean Sea was secured for Greece.

The Balkan Wars were followed by a rapid escalation in 1914 between Greece and the Ottoman Empire over the status of the islands of the eastern Aegean. Both governments embarked on a naval armaments race, with Greece purchasing the battleships and and the light cruiser as well as ordering two dreadnoughts, and and a number of destroyers. However, with the outbreak of the First World War, construction of the dreadnoughts stopped.

===World War I and aftermath (1914–1935)===

Initially during the war, Greece followed a course of neutrality, with the Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos favouring the Entente and pro-German King Constantine I advocating neutrality. This dispute eventually led to a deep political conflict, known as the &quot;National Schism&quot;. In November 1916, in order to apply pressure on the royal government in Athens, the French confiscated the Greek ships. They continued to operate with French crews, primarily in convoy escort and patrol duties in the Aegean, until Greece entered the war on the side of the Allies in June 1917, at which point they were returned to Greece. Subsequently, the Navy took part in the Allied operations in the Aegean, in the Allied expedition in support of Denikin&#x27;s White Armies in Ukraine, and in limited operations during the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922 in Asia Minor.

After Greece&#x27;s defeat, the 1920s and early 1930s were a politically turbulent period, with the economy in a bad state, so the Navy received no new units, apart from the modernization of four destroyers and the acquisition of six French submarines in 1927 and four Italian destroyers in 1929.

===World War II (1939–1945)===


In 1938, Greece ordered four modern &quot;Greyhound&quot;-class destroyers in British shipyards, making a serious step towards modernization. The outbreak of war in Europe, however, allowed only two to be delivered. Greece entered World War II with a navy consisting of two battleships, one armoured cruiser, one protected cruiser, fourteen destroyers, and six submarines.

During the Greco-Italian War, the Navy took over convoy escort missions in the Ionian Sea and even embarked on three raids against the Italian supply convoys in the Strait of Otranto, although without success. The most important role was given to the submarines, which although obsolete, sank some Italian cargo ships in the Adriatic, losing one submarine in the process. The Greek submarine force (six boats) was however too small to be able to seriously hinder the supply lines between Italy and Albania (between 28 October 1940 and 30 April 1941, Italian ships made 3,305 voyages across the Otranto straits, carrying 487,089 military personnel, including 22 field divisions, and 584,392 tons of supplies while losing overall only seven merchant ships and one escort ship).

When Nazi Germany attacked Greece, the RHN suffered heavily at the hands of the Luftwaffe, with 25 ships, including the old battleship, now artillery training ship, &quot;Kilkis&quot; and the hulk of her sister &quot;Lemnos&quot;, lost within a few days in April 1941. It was then decided to shift the remaining fleet (one cruiser – the famous – three destroyers and five submarines) to join up with the British Mediterranean Fleet at Alexandria.

As the war progressed, the number of Hellenic Royal Navy vessels increased after the concession of several destroyers and submarines by the British Royal Navy. The most notable aspects of the Hellenic Royal Navy&#x27;s participation in World War II include the operations of the destroyer which, until sunk in Leros on September 23, 1943, was the most successful Allied destroyer in the Mediterranean Sea; the participation of two destroyers in Operation Overlord; and the story of the destroyer &quot;Adrias&quot;, which while operating close to the coast of Kalymnos in October 1943 hit a mine, resulting in the loss of the vessel&#x27;s prow, while blowing the two-gun forward turret over the bridge. After some minor repairs at Gümüşlük Bay in Turkey &quot;Adrias&quot; managed to return to Alexandria in a trip, even though all the forepart of the ship, up to the bridge, was missing.

===Post-war era (1945–1980)===
After World War II, the Royal Hellenic Navy was significantly strengthened by the concession of British and Italian ships. The organisation also changed in line with modern naval doctrines of that era after the entrance into NATO in 1952. At the beginning of the 1950s, US military aid formed the core of the country&#x27;s armed forces. The Royal Hellenic Navy received the first &quot;Bostwick&quot;-class destroyers which took on the name &quot;Beasts&quot; (Θηρία), while withdrawing the British ones.

The next significant change was during the early 1970s, when Greece was the first Mediterranean naval force to order missile-equipped fast attack craft (Combattante II) and the Type 209 submarines, whereas US military aid continued in the form of FRAM II type destroyers. In 1979, the Hellenic Navy placed an order in the Netherlands for two modern Standard-class frigates (the ). These were the first acquisitions of new main surface vessels, rather than the use of second-hand ships, in almost four decades.

===Modern era (1980–2024)===
The arrivals of &quot;Hydra&quot; class (MEKO 200 HN) and more Standard-class frigates, along with the orders for more missile corvettes, &quot;Poseidon&quot;-class (Type 209) submarines, and naval helicopters allowed for the retirement any obsolete vessels. Greece also received four s from the US Navy in 1991–1992. All four were decommissioned after only ten years in service, since their electronics and armament eventually became obsolete, and they required large crews. Greece ordered Type 214 submarines that feature an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system, Sikorsky S-70B-6/10 Aegean Hawk helicopters, and Project 1232.2 &quot;Zubr&quot;-class hovercraft from Russia &amp; Ukraine. Later actions included the modernization of Standard-class frigates with new electronics &amp; radar systems, and the modernization of &quot;Glaukos&quot; and &quot;Poseidon&quot;-class submarines with new sonars, electronics &amp; air-independent propulsion engines (programs Neptune I/II).

==Fleet overview==
The Hellenic Navy maintains a large number of surface vessels and submarines in its inventory. However, the vast majority of warships in active service are in the process of either being replaced by more modern and advanced designs, being refurbished, or being retired. The Navy is awaiting delivery of a three FDI Belharra frigates from France with an option for one more after the Greek Prime Minister announced the purchase from Greece of four new multirole heavy frigates in September 2020, that will replace older &quot;Elli&quot; class vessels. Deliberations with other parties, including the United States and Germany, lasted for months after France was eventually awarded the contract. He also announced the immediate upgrade of all four &quot;Hydra (Meko-200HN)&quot; class frigates, already in service. Greece has also signed on to a program between Italy and France in making a new multirole heavy corvette, with Spain joining as well. The program, dubbed the European Patrol Corvette, has also been inserted in the EU&#x27;s so-called Permanent Structured Cooperation. Naviris expected the EU fund to issue a Request for Proposal for projects in 2020, with proposals to then be submitted by industry in 2021, and for decisions on fund allocation to be made the same year. Also, plans for the Hellenic Navy to acquire the Sa&#x27;ar 72 Israeli corvette of the new &quot;Themistocles&quot; class came to fruition after an agreement signed in June 2020, with exclusive production in Greece.

=== Frigates and heavy corvettes ===
Frigates are the main heavy ships of the Navy, with 70% of the &quot;Hydra&quot; class frigates having an advanced anti-aircraft missile launching system. However, there is no dedicated Anti-aircraft Warfare (AAW) platform in the fleet since the &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; class destroyers were decommissioned in the late 90s. The oldest ship in the frigate fleet is just over 40 years old (HS &quot;Kountouriotis&quot;, commissioned in 1978) while the youngest ship is just over 20 years old (HS &quot;Salamis&quot;, commissioned in 1998). None of the ships was equipped with a remote weapon station (RWS) for the purpose of asymmetric warfare and coastal defence and the electronic countermeasures systems (ECM) were absent or obsolete. Raytheon has now installed new electro-optical systems on the ships that were previously not equipped with such sensors. It is certain that &quot;Hydras&quot; will undergo a modernization program but its scale is not yet known. Plan for the &quot;Hydras&quot; is to extend their operational lifespan well into the 2030s. However, the &quot;Elli&quot; class frigates need to be replaced by new designs.

The acquisition of two, with an option for two more, Naval Group FDI &quot;Belharra&quot; frigates with high-end AAW and deep missile strike (DMS utilising Scalp EG Naval) capabilities from France was put on hold in July 2020, despite an intense interest initially expressed by the Navy. Main reasons for this policy change by the Greek Government, were reported to be the increased cost of almost €3 billion for only two units, the exclusion by the French of co-production and the delayed delivery of the first unit, placing it in 2025 at the earliest. Meanwhile, the United States had proposed the acquisition of four Multi-Mission Surface Combatants (&quot;Freedom&quot; class MMSCs), also known as Littoral combat ships, that are already in full production for Saudi Arabia, also tested and in use by the US Navy. The Germans came to the table with the Meko-A200 design, a new and advanced version of the Meko-200HN, that could additionally offer homogeneity to the fleet, especially after the upgrade of the ships already in service.

On November 6, 2020, the Navy submitted its initial preference for the acquisition of 4 MMSC Littoral Combat Ships developed by Lockheed Martin. These multi-mission frigates were part of a wider package discussed with the US, that also included upgrade of the four &quot;Hydra&quot; frigates, intermediate solution ships, and participation of Hellenic Shipyards in the development of the new American FFG(X) type frigate. The FFG(X) type frigate, now named &quot;Constellation&quot; class, is a multi-mission guided-missile ship, under development for the United States Navy by Fincantieri Marinette Marine. However all other proposals, also including those from the Netherlands, the UK, Spain and Italy, remained on the table pending closest evaluation of the packages offered by all participating companies. The final decision by the Greek Government on the type and country of origin of the new Hellenic ships, was scheduled for 2021.

Final decision was made in September 28 of 2021 and after many months of deliberations. During his visit to the French capital and his meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced the procurement of 3+1 French FDI-HN Frigates and 3+1 Gowind-HN class Corvettes in a €5 billion deal spreading to 2026, with the later class still being configured to meet the Hellenic Navy&#x27;s needs.

It is almost certain that two types will replace the &quot;Ellis&quot;, in order to maintain a ceiling of at least ten frigates/corvettes. A floating scenario was the purchase of heavy corvettes to replace a number of old &quot;Ellis&quot;. This scenario has become increasingly more possible, after Greece joined Italy and France in the &quot;European Patrol Corvette&quot; (EPC/PESCO) consortium in early 2020 for the construction of a new advanced 3,000 ton corvette, with Spain joining the program as well. New ships, for all involved Navies, are not likely to enter service before 2027 or 2030 at the earliest.

=== Submarines ===
Greece maintains a mixed fleet of modern and older submarine units. In December 2019, the Hellenic Ministry of Defence resolved a lingering issue, regarding the new Type-214 (&quot;Papanikolis&quot; class) torpedoes. An order for new multipurpose heavyweight SeaHake Mod4 torpedoes, from Atlas Elektronik, was placed. The contract also included the upgrade of older torpedoes and the purchase of new torpedo batteries. The six older and non-modernized Type-209 units (&quot;Poseidon&quot; and &quot;Glavkos&quot; classes) will be gradually retired, without any replacement announced yet. The optimistic scenario is replacement with four additional Type-214s, reaching a ceiling of eight units of this type. By 2030, the recently upgraded Type-209/1500 AIP (HS &quot;Okeanos&quot;, former Type-209/1200) will have exceeded 50 years since entering service; therefore it is questionable whether it will still be part of the Greek fleet by that time.

=== Other surface combatants ===
There were two new &quot;Roussen&quot; class Fast Attack Missile Craft (FAMC) under construction, bringing the number of vessels of this type up to seven; The 6th ship was commissioned operational in July 2020, with the seventh and final ship expected Autumn 2020. This was after a more than ten-year delay due to financial and structural problems faced by Elefsis Shipyard that was contracted to build the ships. There are no changes in the initial design, despite 20 years since the first vessel in the class entered service. The majority of the FAC were built in the late ‘70s. Four of them have been modernised extensively and the new ships have integrated all updates. All older vessels of other types, with the exemption of three &quot;Votsis&quot; class boats which are about to be retired soon with the introduction of the new &quot;Roussens&quot;, have replaced their old MM38 and Penguin missile systems with Harpoon launchers. In addition, the boats that had no electro-optical tracking (Mirador) sensors, received new endogenous Miltech TDR-10A and TDR-300 systems.

The fleet also consists of ten gunboats. With the exception of the four &quot;Machitis&quot; class (Osprey HSY-56A), the rest of the gunboats need modernization and, some of them, replacement. The two &quot;Asheville&quot; class boats are at least 50 years old. The remaining four boats (Osprey-55 and HSY-56) have already received new electro-optical systems. On June 16, 2020, ONEX Neorion Shipyards SA in the Greek island of Syros and Israel Shipyards LTD signed a cooperation agreement for the construction of the &quot;Themistocles&quot; class corvette during Greek PM&#x27;s visit to Israel. This is a multipurpose warship based on the Israeli Sa&#x27;ar 72-class corvette design, at 72 meters length and displacement of around 800 tons. It will be able of speeds above 30 knots with an extended endurance. It can operate a medium size marine helicopter, but also supports unique possibilities of deploying Special Forces units. The agreement was for the construction in Greece of seven vessels, with an option for six more. These will replace an equal number of older gunboats.

In February 2020, at a special event held at the Hellenic Institute of Naval Technology (HINT), the technical director of the Unit of Submersibles and Hellenic Navy Works of Hellenic Shipyards Co., presented project &quot;Aginor&quot;. The project was the development and construction, in collaboration with the Navy, of an advanced Asymmetric Warfare Vessel (AWV) that uses the latest technologies and composite materials. The first vessels have already been added to the Navy’s fleet. They are capable of a number of missions including insertion and extraction of Special Operations Forces, interdiction and coastal patrol, as well as search and rescue (SAR) operations.

In April 2020 the Navy received the first four Mark V Special Operations Craft, ordered via the United States &quot;Excess Defense Articles&quot; programme. The craft are utilised by the Underwater Demolition Command.

=== Aircraft ===
In 2019, the U.S. State Department cleared a $600 million foreign military sale (FMS) of seven MH-60R Seahawk multi-mission helicopters to Greece. In July 2020, Greece signed a contract for the purchase of four new units, via this program. In November of the same year, the remaining three aircraft were also included in the order. A decision was made in 2014 for the re-activation of existing Lockheed P-3B Orions and their submission to a program of overhaul, upgrade and service life extension. The contract with Lockheed Martin included the return of one aircraft to airworthy condition with the existing mission equipment as an &quot;interim solution&quot; and the complete modernization and upgrade of four other aircraft in Hellenic Aerospace (HAI). The option included the complete modernization and upgrade of that aircraft as well. The &quot;interim solution&quot; aircraft has already been delivered, while all the remaining aircraft are expected to be delivered by 2023.

The Hellenic Navy will soon begin the use of a new UAV called Archytas. This will be a VTOL aircraft used for surveillance and it will be able to take-off and land on warships. It may also be lightly armed. However, this will not be flying until 2024.

===Ships===
The Hellenic Navy&#x27;s fleet of warships and auxiliary boats is harboured in the two major HN naval bases at Salamis Island near Piraeus and at Souda Bay on the island of Crete. Internationally, the Navy used the prefix HS &quot;(Hellenic Ship)&quot; for its vessels.

==== Frigates ====
The Hellenic Navy relies mainly on frigates as its primary surface heavy boats. The fleet consists of thirteen frigates. The types operated are the (Type: Meko-200HN) and the (Type: ). The &quot;Elli&quot;-class frigates HS &quot;Elli&quot; and HS &quot;Limnos&quot; were sold to Greece during construction, the rest were bought directly from the Royal Netherlands Navy. The &quot;Hydra&quot;-class vessels were constructed in Greece by Hellenic Shipyards Co., except from HS &quot;Hydra&quot; that was constructed by the German company Blohm and Voss based in Hamburg.

Modernization of six frigates was completed in 2010. The intention for the &quot;Hydra&quot;-class vessels was, as of February 2015, to be modernised with a €400 million upgrade that would extend their operational life to 2035. These plans became a priority for the Navy in 2020, amidst rising tensions with Turkey over delimitation of maritime zones in the Eastern Mediterranean. Greece also negotiated the acquisition of four new frigates from the United States to replace older &quot;Ellis&quot;″ and proposed to the US a wider package of upgrades and future co-production opportunities involving the frigate, currently being developed for the US Navy. The final decision on the type and origin of the new frigates was scheduled to be made in 2021, after examining closely all available proposals from a list of other countries, apart from the US. France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom also participated in the selection process. Finally, in September 2021 the decision for the future of the HN frigate fleet was announced, including gradual replacement of the &quot;Elli&quot; class with the French-built &quot;Belharra Hellenique (Frégate de défense et d&#x27;intervention - FDI)&quot;-class warships, officially constituting the Navy’s new &quot;Kimon&quot; class, and modernisation of the &quot;Hydra&quot; class in a €5 billion deal that initially extends up to 2026.

Since 2022, three frigates of the &quot;Kimon&quot; class have been under construction in France by Naval Group. These are HS &quot;Kimon&quot; (F-601), HS &quot;Nearchos&quot; (F-602) and HS &quot;Formion&quot; (F-603). Delivery of HS &quot;Kimon&quot; (F-601) is scheduled for early 2025 and the rest are to follow over the succeeding months. Greece has a contracted option for a fourth ship to be included in the initial production line, if it so chooses.

The frigate HS &quot;Psara&quot; carries three reliquaries permanently on its onboard historical exhibition. Two contain the taxidermic hearts of Greek War of Independence heroes Admiral Konstantinos Kanaris and Admiral Andreas Miaoulis and one reliquary contains the remains of heroine Rear Admiral (posthumous) Laskarina Bouboulina. The frigate&#x27;s exhibition can be visited when the ship opens to the public during National Holidays and celebrations.

In January 2024, Defence Minister Nikolaos Dendias announced a proposal to manufacture seven &quot;Constellation&quot;-class frigates in Greece. 

====Gunboats====
The Hellenic Navy operates ten gunboats of the &quot;Osprey&quot; and es. Both Osprey HSY-55 and Osprey HSY-56A classes are designed by the Hellenic Navy following a modular concept so that weapons and sensors can be changed as required. They were built by Hellenic Shipyards (HSY) in Greece. These vessels are similar in appearance to s. The first pair was ordered on 20 February 1990. HS &quot;Pyrpolitis&quot; was launched on 16 September 1992 and HS &quot;Polemistis&quot; on 21 June 1993. Each ship can carry 25 fully equipped troops. Alternative guns and Harpoon missiles can be fitted as required. &quot;Pyrpolitis&quot; was renamed &quot;Kasos&quot; on 11 November 2005, after the island of Kasos in the Dodecanese. The ship is based in the area of Kasos, and the name recognises the island and the Kasos Massacre during the Greek War of Independence. The two &quot;Asheville&quot;-class gunboats are former US Navy vessels, bought and transferred to Greece in 1989.

====Attack Missile boats====
The fleet consists of nineteen missile boats also known as fast attack missile craft. Two new ships (P78 and P79) entered service in 2019. The main purpose of these vessels is offensive anti-ship warfare. The Hellenic Navy operates four types of missile boats. These are the &quot;Roussen&quot; (Super-Vita), &quot;Laskos&quot; (La Combattante III), &quot;Kavaloudis&quot; (La Combattante IIIb) and &quot;Votsis&quot; (La Combattante IIa) classes. The La Combattante III and La Combattante IIIb classes were upgraded in 2006. For the La Combattante III craft, Thales delivered a TACTICOS combat management system, including four multi-functional operator consoles, one surveillance radar, a fire-control tracking system, one electro-optical tracking and fire control system, an integrated low-probability-of-interception radar, two target designation sights and a tactical data link. The weapon suite of the La Combattante IIIs remained unchanged. Thales was also responsible for the integration of existing guns, surface-to-surface missiles and torpedoes. The La Combattante IIa ships are scheduled to be decommissioned upon completion of the two newly ordered &quot;Roussen&quot; gunboats.

====Submarines====
The Hellenic Navy Submarine Command operates eleven submarines of four types. The newest and most advanced type operated is the Type 214 &quot;Papanikolis&quot; class, which is widely considered to be among the most advanced conventional (non-nuclear) propulsion submarines in service with naval forces at the moment. The Type 214 is a diesel-electric submarine developed by the German Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft GmbH (HDW). It features diesel propulsion with an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system using Siemens polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) hydrogen fuel cells. A contract to build four boats for the Hellenic Navy was signed between February 2000 and June 2002. The first boat was built at HDW in Kiel, Germany, and the rest at Hellenic Shipyards Co. in Skaramangas, Greece. The Hellenic Navy named them the &quot;Papanikolis&quot; class. Other types operated are the 209/1100 &quot;Glavkos&quot; class, the 209/1200 &quot;Poseidon&quot; class and one boat of the 209/1500 AIP &quot;Okeanos&quot; class. The &quot;Glavkos&quot; submarines were upgraded with the &quot;Neptune I&quot; modernisation program and the &quot;Poseidon&quot; and &quot;Okeanos&quot; vessels with the &quot;Neptune II&quot; program. The &quot;Okeanos&quot; upgrade included AIP capabilities very similar to Type 214 so extensive to justify HS &quot;Okeanos&quot; as a new, separate class when compared to the rest of Type 209/1200 vessels. New dimensions are similar to Type 214 boats.

====Special operations craft====
The Navy operates the endogenous AAWV Aginor &quot;(Αγήνωρ)&quot; which is an advanced asymmetric warfare vessel (AAWV) that uses latest technologies and composite materials making it suitable for a number of missions including insertion and extraction of Special Operations Forces, interdiction and coastal patrol, as well as search and rescue (SAR) operations.

The Navy also operates the Mark V Special Operations Craft, which is an American design originally developed for the US Navy Seals. The craft are utilised by the Hellenic Navy Underwater Demolition Command and are specifically customised to the needs of the Hellenic Navy and the Aegean theater of operations.

====Landing boats====
The Hellenic Navy currently operates nine tank landing ships (LST), five of the Greek-built and four heavy military hovercraft of the Ukrainian/Russian-built . The &quot;Jason&quot; landing craft are capable of transporting 287 troops plus 22 battle tanks or any other combination of other armoured vehicles. The &quot;Zubr&quot; craft have a military lift of total 130 tonnes of cargo with three battle tanks, eight armoured vehicles, ten personnel carriers and 140 troops or combinations of those and a speed of 40 knots when fully loaded. The &quot;Zubr&quot; class (Project 1232.2 / NATO codename: &quot;Pomornik&quot;) is an air-cushioned landing craft (LCAC). This class of military hovercraft is, as of 2012, the world&#x27;s largest, with a standard full load displacement of 555 tons. The hovercraft is designed to sealift amphibious assault units (such as marines and tanks) from equipped or non-equipped vessels to non-equipped shores, as well as transport and plant naval mines. The purchase of HS &quot;Cephalonia&quot; for the Hellenic Navy was the first time a Soviet design had been built for and purchased by a NATO member.

====Replenishment and other vessels====
The Hellenic Navy operates fifteen replenishment and support ships including petroleum tankers, water tankers and auxiliary vessels. It also operates two Greek-built transport ships of the &quot;Pandora&quot; class, six coastline patrol boats, three minehunters, three torpedo retrievers, seventeen tugboats (both open sea and harbour), four oceanographic &amp; scientific research vessels and two lighthouse tenders. The Navy also preserves three memorial ships including the &quot;Pisa&quot;-class armoured cruiser HS &quot;Georgios Averof&quot; which is the only armoured cruiser worldwide still in existence and, although it is permanently a harboured museum ship, is ceremoniously considered in active-service carrying the Rear Admiral&#x27;s Rank Flag. The Hellenic Navy also has the trireme Olympias in commission, making the Hellenic Navy the navy with the oldest type of commissioned vessel in the world..

===Aircraft===
The Hellenic Navy operates naval aviation units under the Navy Aviation Command, that resulted from the amalgamation of the &quot;Navy Helicopter Command&quot; and the &quot;353rd Naval Cooperation Squadron&quot;, which was run jointly with the Hellenic Air Force.

It currently operates:
*Lockheed Martin P-3B Orions as maritime patrol and naval cooperation platforms. Four upgraded aircraft have gradually started to re-enter the fleet, after a $142 million contract for their upgrade was awarded in February 2016 to Lockheed Martin. (6 delivered, 1 operational/upgraded, 4 more currently upgraded, 1 will be used for parts)
*Sikorsky MH-60R Seahawk: Newer anti-submarine warfare variant of the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopter with capability for vertical resupply missions and search &amp; rescue operations. Entered service in March 2024. 3 delivered another 4 on order.
*Sikorsky S-70B Seahawks, which is the export variant of the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk. Furthermore, the Greek variant is the S-70/B-6 Aegean Hawk, which is a blend of the SH-60B and F-models. (11 S-70B6 AegeanHawk)
*Aérospatiale Alouette IIIs, mainly used for missions such as aerial observation, photography, transport and training. (4 delivered, 2 in use)
*Agusta Bell AB-212 ASWs, which is the military variant of the Bell 212, dedicated to anti-submarine warfare. (11 ASW and 2 EW delivered, 6 ASW and 2 EW in use)
*Alpha Unmanned Systems A900 UAV Helicopters. (5 on order, to be delivered by April 2022) 

===Anti- aircraft aystems===

In July 2024, the Hellenic Navy demonstrated a new Counter-UAV system called Centaur. This is made by Hellenic Aerospace Industry and only costs €2,000,000. The system is mounted on the flagship HS &quot;Psara&quot; and it has knocked down Houthi drones over the Red Sea.

<doc id="425922" wikidata="Q3084210" url="?curid=425922" title="California State Legislature">
<text>The California State Legislature is the bicameral state legislature of the U.S. state of California, consisting of the California State Assembly (lower house with 80 members) and the California State Senate (upper house with 40 members). Both houses of the Legislature convene at the California State Capitol in Sacramento.

The California State Legislature is one of ten full-time state legislatures in the United States. The houses are distinguished by the colors of the carpet and trim of each house: the Senate uses red and the Assembly uses green, inspired by the United Kingdom&#x27;s House of Lords and House of Commons respectively.

The Democratic Party currently holds veto-proof supermajorities in both houses of the California State Legislature. The Assembly consists of 60 Democrats and 19 Republicans, while the Senate is composed of 30 Democrats and 9 Republicans. Except for a brief period from 1995 to 1996, the Assembly has been in Democratic hands since the 1970 election. The Senate has been under Democratic control since 1970, except for a brief period from 1973 to 1975.

==History==
===1849 Constitution===
Article IV of the 1849 California Constitution prescribed that the legislative power of the state is invested in an Assembly and a Senate which was to be designated as the Legislature of the State of California. Sessions were required to be annual and began on the first Monday of the January after the previous election unless if the Governor called an extraordinary session by proclamation. The terms of Assembly members lasted for one year while the terms of Senators lasted for two years. The 1849 Constitution did not prescribe the size of either house, but it did require that the Senate was to be composed of no less than one third but no more than one half of the number of members in the Assembly, with half of the Senators being up for election each year while requiring the legislature to fix the number of Senators and Assemblymembers, with there to be no less than 24 and no more than 36 members in the Assembly until the population of the state reached 100,000 residents, upon which the number of members in the Assembly was to be no less than 36 and no more than 80. Legislative districts were to be apportioned among the &quot;several counties and districts&quot; according to the white population of said areas. Section 25 imposed a single-subject rule on legislative bills, Section 26 prohibited the legislature from granting a divorce, Section 31 prohibited the legislature from establishing a corporation with a special act (similar to a private bill), Section 34 prohibited the legislature from granting a charter &quot;for banking purposes&quot; while Section 35 required the legislature to enact a statute which prohibited any person or corporation from &quot;..exercising the privileges of banking or creating paper to circulate as money&quot;, and Section 38 required all votes in the legislature to be conducted via voice vote.

===1879 Constitution===
In its original form, Article IV of the 1879 California Constitution structured the legislature in a similar way to the 1849 Constitution. However, the 1879 Constitution explicitly stated that the Senate has 40 members and that the Assembly has 80 members. The constitution also explicitly provides that Senators terms are four years and the terms of members of the Assembly are two years.

==Legislative session schedule==
New legislators convene each new two-year session, to organize, in the Assembly and Senate chambers, respectively, at noon on the first Monday in December following the election.

After the organizational meeting, both houses are in recess until the first Monday in January, except when the first Monday is January 1 or January 1 is a Sunday, in which case they meet the following Wednesday. Aside from the recess, the legislature is in session year-round.

==State House==
Since California was given official statehood by the U.S. on September 9, 1850, as part of the Compromise of 1850, the state capital was variously San Jose (1850–1851), Vallejo (1852–1853) and Benicia (1853–1854), until Sacramento was finally selected in 1854.

The first Californian State House was originally a hotel in San Jose owned by businessman Pierre &quot;Don Pedro&quot; Sainsevain and his associates.

The State Legislature currently meets in the California State Capitol in Sacramento.

== Terms and term limits ==
Members of the Assembly are elected from 80 districts and serve two-year terms. All 80 Assembly seats are subject to election every two years. Members of the Senate are elected from 40 districts and serve four-year terms. Every two years, one half of the Senate (20 seats) is subject to election, with odd-numbered districts up for election during presidential elections, and even-numbered districts up for election during midterm elections.

Term limits were initially established in 1990 following the passage of Proposition 140. In June 2012, voters approved Proposition 28, which limits legislators to a maximum of 12 years, without regard to whether they serve those years in the State Assembly or the State Senate. Legislators first elected on or before June 5, 2012, are restricted by the previous term limits, approved in 1990, which limited legislators to three terms in the State Assembly and two terms in the State Senate.

== Record keeping ==
The proceedings of the California State Legislature are briefly summarized in regularly published journals, which show votes and who proposed or what. Reports produced by California executive agencies, as well as the Legislature, were published in the Appendices to the Journals from 1849 to 1970. Since the 1990s, the legislature has provided a live video feed for its sessions, and has been broadcast state-wide on the California Channel and local public-access television cable TV. Due to the expense and the obvious political , California did not keep records of actual speeches made by members of the Assembly and Senate until the video feed began. As a result, reconstructing legislative intent outside of an act&#x27;s preamble is extremely difficult in California for legislation passed before the 1990s.

Since 1993, the Legislature has hosted a web or FTP site in one form or another. The current website contains the text of all statutes, all bills, the text of all versions of the bills, all the committee analyses of bills, all the votes on bills in committee or on the floor, and veto messages from the governor. Before then, committees occasionally published reports for significant bills, but most bills were not important enough to justify the expense of printing and distributing a report to archives and law libraries across the state. For bills lacking such a formal committee report, the &quot;only&quot; way to discover legislative intent is to access the state archives in Sacramento and manually review the files of relevant legislators, legislative committees, and the Governor&#x27;s Office from the relevant time period, in the hope of finding a statement of intent and evidence that the statement actually reflected the views of several of the legislators who voted for the bill (as opposed to just one).

== Legislative committees ==
The most sought-after legislative committee appointments are to governance and finance, business and professions, and health. These are sometimes called &quot;juice&quot; committees, because membership in these committees often aids the campaign fundraising efforts of the committee members because powerful lobbying groups want to donate to members of these committees.

=== Pocket veto ===
The legislature can &quot;pocket veto&quot; laws by avoiding consideration and thus avoiding a vote. The Appropriations &quot;Suspense File&quot;, which was created in the mid-1980s, is a popular way to avoid a vote.

When a committee refuses to vote a bill out of committee, a discharge petition can typically be passed by the broader membership. In California, as of 2019 this was governed by Senate Rule 28 which requires 21 members and Assembly Rule 96(a) which requires 41 members; the procedure was notably used in 1998.

In 2019, a rule change in the Assembly allowed committee chairs to avoid considering bills, which effectively kills the proposal. A proposed amendment to the constitution (ACA-23) was proposed for the 2017–2018 session to require a vote.

Across the country, pocket veto powers are not uncommon in legislatures; in Colorado, the power was notably repealed in a citizen initiative constitutional amendment in 1988 driven by various reform groups.

== Overview of legislative procedure ==
A bill is a proposal to change, repeal, or add to existing state law. An Assembly Bill (AB) is one introduced in the Assembly; a Senate Bill (SB), in the Senate.

Bills are designated by number, in the order of introduction in each house. For example, AB 16 refers to the 16th bill introduced in the Assembly. The numbering starts afresh each session. There may be one or more &quot;extraordinary&quot; sessions. The bill numbering starts again for each of these. For example, the third bill introduced in the Assembly for the second extraordinary session is ABX2 3. The name of the author, the legislator who introduced the bill, becomes part of the title of the bill.

The legislative procedure, is divided into distinct stages:

* . The procedure begins when a Senator or Assembly Member decides to author a bill. A legislator sends the idea for the bill to the California Office of the Legislative Counsel, which drafts it into bill form and returns the draft to the legislator for introduction.
* Introduction or First Reading. A legislator introduces a bill for the first time by reading or having read: the bill number, name of the author, and descriptive title on the floor of the house. The bill then goes to the Office of State Publishing. The legislator can not act on a bill, except the Budget Bill, until 30 days after its introduction.
* Committee hearing. After introduction, a bill goes to the rules committee of the house, which assigns it to the policy committee appropriate to the subject matter, for its first hearing. During the committee hearing, the author presents the bill to the committee, which may hear testimony in support of or opposition to the bill. The committee then votes on whether to pass the bill out of committee, or that it be passed as amended. Bills may be amended several times. It takes a majority vote of the committee membership to pass a bill and send it to the next committee or to the floor.
* The Fiscal committee reviews the bill if it contains an appropriation or has financial implications for the state.
* A second reading on the floor of the house happens when a bill is recommended for passage. Ordinarily there is little or no debate. If a bill is amended at this stage, it may be referred back for another committee hearing.
* Floor vote. A roll call vote is taken. An ordinary bill needs a majority vote to pass . An urgency bill or a bill with tax increases requires a two-thirds vote. The California Constitution used to require a two-thirds vote of both houses on the yearly budget and on any bill that would increase taxes, but since the passage of California Proposition 25 (2010), the two-thirds vote is required only for tax increases. Before this change, the two-thirds vote requirement was faulted for much of what had been termed &quot;legislative gridlock&quot;, enabling a minority party to block approval of a budget before the previous one expired.
* Second house. If it receives a favorable vote in the first house, a bill repeats the same steps in the other house. If the second house passes the bill without changing it, it is sent to the governor&#x27;s desk.
* Resolution of Differences (concurrence or conference). If a measure is amended in the second house and passed, it is returned to the house of origin for consideration of amendments. The house of origin may concur with the amendments and send the bill to the governor or reject the amendments and submit it to a two-house conference committee. If either house rejects the conference report, a second (and even a third) conference committee can be formed. If both houses adopt the conference report, the bill is sent to the governor.
* Governor&#x27;s action. Within 30 days after receiving a bill, the governor may sign it into law, allow it to become law without his/her signature, or veto it. 
* Overrides. A vetoed bill is returned to the house of origin, where a vote may be taken to override the governor&#x27;s veto; a two-thirds vote of both houses is required to override a veto. (There has been no override in the California Legislature since 1979.)
* California Law and effective date. Each bill that is passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor is assigned a chapter number by the Secretary of State. These chaptered bills are statutes, and ordinarily become part of the California Codes. Ordinarily a law passed during a regular session takes effect January 1 of the following year. A few statutes go into effect as soon as the governor signs them; these include acts calling for elections and urgency measures necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety.

== Compensation ==
From December 4, 2023, members of the California State Legislature receive an annual salary of $128,215. The Assembly Speaker, Senate President pro tempore, and minority floor leaders receive salaries of $147,446. Majority floor leaders and second ranking minority leaders receive salaries of $137,832. As of 2023, California legislators are paid the second highest salary of any state. Senators receive per diem of $211 and Assembly members receive per diem of $214.

== Reform proposals ==

=== Expansion proposals ===

The Neighborhood Legislature Reform Act

In July 23, 2015, then former Republican presidential primary candidate John Cox submitted a ballot measure named &quot;The Neighborhood Legislature Reform Act&quot; which proposed that the Legislature&#x27;s districts be subdivided into &quot;neighborhood districts&quot; of approximately 5000 people within each Assembly district and 10000 people within each Senate district. The representatives of these &quot;neighborhood districts&quot; within each district would then elect 40 Senate members and 80 Assembly members by majority vote. It has been argued that while this proposal would make it easier for citizens to get the attention of any individual community representative, it would also in turn make it harder for these representatives to get the attention of their state legislators. The measure failed to acquire enough signatures to qualify as a proposition for the 2016 November elections ballot.

<text>Peter Caddy (20 March 1917 – 18 February 1994) was a British caterer, hotelier, and with his wife Eileen Caddy and their friend Dorothy Maclean, co-founder of the Findhorn Foundation community.

==Life and work==
Educated at Harrow, Caddy was apprenticed as a director with J. Lyons and Company, and was a member of the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship. On the outbreak of the Second World War he was commissioned as an officer with the Catering Branch of the Royal Air Force, where he served from 1940 until 1955. From 1957 until 1961 he was manager of the Cluny Hill Hotel near Forres, Scotland, now the training college of the Findhorn Foundation.

During a period of unemployment from 1962 onwards, Caddy began experimenting with organic gardening to supplement his family&#x27;s food supply. The garden near Findhorn, Scotland, flourished to such a remarkable extent that it eventually attracted national attention. Peter Caddy attributed its success to his spiritual practices, and a community began to form around his family and their friend Dorothy Maclean. Much more information about the establishment and growth of the Findhorn Community is contained in Peter Caddy&#x27;s autobiography.

In 1979 Caddy left the Findhorn Ecovillage community he had helped to found. He died in a car crash in Germany in 1994.

<text>Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face (originally titled Donald Duck in Nutziland or A Nightmare in Nutziland) is an American animated anti-Nazi propaganda short film produced by Walt Disney Productions, created in 1942 and released on January 1, 1943 by RKO Radio Pictures. The cartoon, which features Donald Duck in a nightmare setting working at a factory in Nazi Germany, was made in an effort to sell war bonds and is an example of American propaganda during World War II. The film was directed by Jack Kinney and written by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer. Spike Jones released a version of Oliver Wallace&#x27;s theme for the short before the film was released.

&quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot; won the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film at the 15th Academy Awards. It is the only Donald Duck film to receive the honor, although eight other films have also been nominated. In 1994, it was voted Number 22 of &quot;the 50 Greatest Cartoons&quot; of all time by members of the animation field. However, because of the propagandistic nature of the short and the depiction of Donald Duck as a Nazi (albeit a deeply reluctant one), Disney kept the film out of general circulation after its original release. Its first home release came in 2004 with the release of the third wave of the Walt Disney Treasures DVD sets.

==Plot==
An oom-pah bandcomposed of Axis powers leaders Joseph Goebbels on the trombone, Heinrich Himmler on the snare drum, Hideki Tojo on the sousaphone, Hermann Göring on the piccolo and Benito Mussolini on the bass drummarches while singing the virtues of the Nazi doctrine. They are in a caricature of a German town, where the trees, windmill blades, fences, telephone poles and clouds are all shaped like swastikas, while the houses resemble Adolf Hitler&#x27;s face.

Donald Duck, apparently a German citizen in this world, is awoken by his pickelhaube-wearing alarm clock at 4 a.m. He smashes the clock with his fist. His cuckoo clock chimes with a Hitler-esque bird, only for Donald to throw a shoe at it. The rooster outside does the Nazi salute and crows &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;. Passing by Donald&#x27;s house, the band members poke him out of bed with a bayonet. Donald faces and salutes the portraits of Hitler, Hirohito, and Mussolini, then tries to go back to bed, only for someone to splash him with water while yelling angrily in German.

Donald goes to make breakfast. Because of wartime rationing, it consists of bread that&#x27;s so stale and hard it resembles wood (and must be cut with a saw), coffee brewed from a single hoarded coffee bean, and a bacon-and-egg-flavored breath spray. The band shoves a copy of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; in front of him for a moment of reading, then marches into his house and escorts him to a factory, with Donald now carrying the bass drum and Göring kicking him.
Upon arriving at the factory (at bayonet-point), Donald starts his &quot;48 hours a day&quot; shift of screwing caps onto artillery shells on an assembly line. Mixed in with the shells are portraits of Der Fuehrer, so Donald must perform the Nazi salute for each portrait, all while screwing the caps on with his other hand, much to his disgust. Each new batch of shells is of a different size, ranging from individual bullets to massive shells larger than Donald. The pace of the assembly line intensifies (as in the Charlie Chaplin comedy &quot;Modern Times&quot;), and Donald finds it increasingly hard to complete all the tasks. The band&#x27;s song intermittently resumes, but is now more cynical, saying that Der Fuehrer &quot;lies and rants and raves&quot;, the citizens &quot;work like slaves&quot; and that they&#x27;d like to see Hitler blown up. A different German-accented voice shouts propaganda messages about the superiority of the Aryan race and the glory of working for Der Fuehrer. When Donald momentarily grumbles in frustration, the guards overhear him and point their bayonets at him, forcing him to fearfully recant his complaints.

Donald has &quot;paid vacation&quot; which consists of forced exercise (contorting his arms into swastika shapes and quickly Nazi-saluting) in front of a painting of the Alps. This only lasts for a few seconds before the voice declares that Donald, &quot;by special decree of Der Fuehrer&quot;, must work overtime. The work resumes at an even faster pace while the voice constantly screams orders. Donald has a nervous breakdown with hallucinations of artillery shells, including snake- and bird-shaped shells, army boot shells crushing Donald, and marching band shells that hiss the music. (Some of the animation in this sequence is recycled from the &quot;Pink Elephants on Parade&quot; sequence from &quot;Dumbo&quot;).

When the hallucinations are cleared, Donald wakes up in another bed (wearing stars-and-stripes patterned pajamas), only to see the shadow of a figure holding its right hand up. Believing it to be a Nazi salute, he begins to do so himself until he sees that it&#x27;s the shadow of a miniature Statue of Liberty on his windowsill. Donald realizes that the whole thing was a dream and he lives in the United States. He embraces the statue, saying, &quot;Am I glad to be a citizen of the United States of America!&quot;

The short ends with a caricature of Hitler&#x27;s angry face and a tomato is thrown at it, with the splatter forming the words &quot;The End&quot;.

==Voice cast==
* Clarence Nash as Donald Duck
* Cliff Edwards as Nazi lead singer
* Charles Judels as Off-stage Nazi

==Song==
Before the film&#x27;s release, the popular band Spike Jones and His City Slickers, noted for their parodies of popular songs of the time, released a version of Oliver Wallace&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot; (also known informally as &quot;The Nazi Song&quot;), itself a parody of the Horst-Wessel-Lied, in September 1942 on RCA Victor Bluebird Records #11586. Unlike the version in the cartoon, some Spike Jones versions contain the sound effect of an instrument he called the &quot;birdaphone&quot;, a rubber razzer (also known as the Bronx Cheer) with each &quot;Heil!&quot; to show contempt for Hitler (instead, the cartoon version features the sound of a tuba). The so-called &quot;Bronx Cheer&quot; was a well-known expression of disgust in that time period and was not deemed obscene or offensive. The sheet music cover bears the image of Donald Duck throwing a tomato in Hitler&#x27;s face. In the Jones version, the chorus line, &quot;Ja, we is the supermen—&quot; is answered by a soloist&#x27;s &quot;Super-duper super men!&quot; effeminately delivered suggesting the prevalence of epicenes among Nazis; in the Disney version, these lines are delivered flatly but with effeminate gestures by Hermann Göring. The recording was very popular, peaking at No. 3 on the U.S. chart.

===Other versions===
* Johnny Bond recorded the song in July 1942 on the OKeh label.
* Arthur Fields recorded the song in July 1942 on the Hit Records label.
* Tommy Trinder recorded the song in the United Kingdom soon after the cartoon&#x27;s release.
* Harry Turtledove adapted the song in one of his &quot;Colonization&quot; novels, in tune with the novel&#x27;s theme of an alternate history alien invasion during World War II.

==Political themes==
Although the film portrays events in Nazi Germany, its release came while the United States also was on total war footing. Coffee, meat and food oils were being rationed, civilians were heavily employed in military production, and propaganda in support of the war effort (such as the film itself) was pervasive. The film&#x27;s criticism therefore emphasizes violence and terror under the Nazi government, as compared with the dull grind that all the warring nations faced.

==Censorship==
In 2010, &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot; was ruled by a local court in Kamchatka, Russia to be included in the national list of extremist materials, which was first created in 2002. This was due to a local who received a suspended sentence of six months for uploading it to the internet and &quot;inciting hatred and enmity&quot;. In July 2016, another Russian court reversed the ruling of the local court, removing the short film from the list. The court highlighted that the film&#x27;s portrayal of Nazism through caricature form cannot be deemed &quot;extremist&quot; in nature.

==In popular culture==
* In August 1943, the cover of the comic book &quot;Four Favorites&quot; #11 depicted The Unknown Soldier, Captain Courageous, Lightning, Magno, and Magno&#x27;s sidekick Davey all singing &quot;Right in Der Fuehrer&#x27;s face!&quot; while an anthropomorphic war bond simultaneously knocks out Hirohito, Hitler, and Mussolini in one punch.

==Home media==
The short was released on May 18, 2004 on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Walt Disney on the Front Lines&quot;.

<doc id="425932" wikidata="Q453536" url="?curid=425932" title="Ivan Mažuranić">
<text>Ivan Mažuranić (; 11 August 1814 – 4 August 1890) was a Croatian poet, linguist, lawyer and politician who is considered to be one of the most important figures in Croatia&#x27;s political and cultural life in the mid-19th century. Mažuranić served as Ban of Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia between 1873 and 1880, and since he was the first ban not to hail from old nobility, he was known as &quot;Ban pučanin&quot; (Ban commoner).

His realistic assessment of strengths and weaknesses of Croatia&#x27;s position between Austrian bureaucracy and Hungarian expansionist nationalism proved invaluable to his home country during the wider political turmoil in mid and late 19th century Europe. Mažuranić is best remembered for his contributions to the development of the Croatian law system, economics, linguistics, and poetry.

==Life and education==
Ivan Mažuranić was born on 11 August 1814 as the third of four sons into a well-to-do yeoman family of Ivan Mažuranić Petrov in Novi Vinodolski in northern coastal Croatia. His brother Josip was in charge of taking care of the family estate, Anton was a famous jurist and philologist, while Matija (a blacksmith by profession) was a travel writer who wrote &quot;A Look at Bosnia&quot; (1842) in which he described the private and public life of Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mažuranić became a man of many abilities; he spoke 9 languages (Croatian, Latin, Italian, German, Hungarian, French, English, Czech, and Polish) and was well versed in astronomy and mathematics. He attended elementary school in Novi Vinodolski and high school in Rijeka, after which he studied law at the University of Zagreb (1835–1837) and philosophy at the University of West Hungary. After graduation he worked as a gymnasium teacher in Zagreb, and afterwards as a lawyer in Karlovac. He married Aleksandra Demeter, the sister of the renowned Croatian poet Dimitrija Demeter.

==Politics==
Mažuranić was the first Croatian ban not to hail from old nobility, as he was born a commoner. He held the office from 20 September 1873 until 21 February 1880. He was a member of the People&#x27;s Party.

He accomplished the Croatian transition from a semi-feudal legal and economic system to a modern civil society similar to those emerging in other countries in central Europe.

Mažuranić has modernized Croatia&#x27;s educational system by forming a public school network and reducing the importance of denominational schools. The latter was one of the issues that led to his later resignation as ban in 1880 and a process criticized by the Catholic Church at the time, as well as by ethnic Serb politicians in the Parliament of Croatia-Slavonia. Others consider this to have been a necessary step in modernization and secularization of Croatian society.

Almost immediately after his election as Ban, Mažuranić started with the implementation of comprehensive reforms. During the period of his rule, the Sabor passed 60 laws covering the whole area of Croatian autonomous jurisdiction. The ideological foundation of his reforms were liberal, emphasizing the importance of the Constitution, individual rights, education, science and laissez faire. The main goal of his reforms was to form foundations of the organization of autonomous Croatian government and establishment of a modern and efficient political-administrative system.

==Poetry and linguistics==

In his native land, Mažuranić is above all the beloved poet of &quot;Smrt Smail-age Čengića&quot; (&quot;The Death of Smail-aga Čengić&quot;). This epic poem is full of memorable verses that have become embedded in the national memory of his people, who cherished it as the treasure of a &quot;Homeric&quot; wisdom praising such epic virtues as fortitude, fidelity, and justice.

The tale is based on an assault in Montenegro, when a petty local Muslim tyrant was killed, as an act of vendetta, in an ambush set by Montenegrins. Mažuranić&#x27;s poetry transformed a rather prosaic act of tribal revenge into a hymn celebrating the struggle for freedom—acted out under the hostile forces of fatality.
Following in the steps of Croatian poets like Kačić and Ivan Gundulić (his chief national influence, whose main epic &quot;Osman&quot; Mažuranić completed), Mažuranić closed the era of Romanticism and of classic epic poetry in Croatian literature.

Mažuranić&#x27;s linguistic work is remarkable for its influence. He co-authored the &quot;German-Illyrian/Croatian Dictionary&quot; with Josip Užarević in 1842. Mažuranić had coined words that have become commonplace in standard Croatian such as words for bank accountancy, rhinoceros, sculptor, ice-cream, market economy, high treason or metropolis.

==Legacy==
Ivan Mažuranić Square in Zagreb is named in his honor, and there are numerous streets named after him throughout Croatia.
His portrait was depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 100 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. During the Croatian accession to the European Union, Nova TV launched a campaign &#x27;I believe in Croatia&#x27; referring to the introduction of Mažuranić&#x27;s famous speech that he gave on 13 December 1886 before the Sabor; &quot;I believe in Croatia, in its past, in its present and its future.&quot;

<doc id="425937" wikidata="Q1016692" url="?curid=425937" title="Hinton, Alberta">
<text>Hinton is a town in west-central Alberta, Canada.

It is located in Yellowhead County, northeast of Jasper and about west of Alberta&#x27;s capital city, Edmonton, at the intersection of Yellowhead and Bighorn Highway, in the Athabasca River valley.

==Geography==
Hinton lies in the Alberta Plateau Benchlands physiographic subdivision of the Interior Plains. Soils around town are influenced by deposits of carbonate-rich, wind-blown sand and silt which usually have surface textures of loam, sandy loam or silt loam. They are moderately alkaline, in contrast to the varying, mostly moderate acidity which prevails beyond the zone of calcareous aeolian material.

===Climate===
The closest weather station is located at Entrance, about southwest of Hinton


== History ==

The Town of Hinton was named for William P. Hinton, Vice President and General Manager of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. The community was named in 1911 and remained a hamlet for the next 45 years.

Settlement in the area was scattered along a line some in length. A site along Hardisty Creek is where a First Nations group from the Jasper area had left members stricken with smallpox while the rest of the group travelled to Lac Ste. Anne to find medical aid for the smallpox epidemic which was ravaging the indigenous population. The area was thus dubbed Cache Picote (Smallpox Camp) in 1870.

In 1888, Jack Gregg established a trading post at Prairie Creek to serve travellers along the Jasper trail. The creek is now known as Muskuta Creek after an incorrect interpretation of the Cree name by white settlers. The construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway saw the establishment of a construction camp at the mouth of Prairie Creek (at the Athabasca River) in 1908. A trestle was built over the creek and is still in use by the Canadian National Railway (CNR) today.

In 1911 the Grand Trunk Pacific built a station house at mile 978 west of Winnipeg. The station was named Hinton, and the community was born.

The Canadian Northern Railway also established a station called Bliss in 1914. The Canadian Northern Railway ran north of the Grand Trunk Pacific line and the Bliss station was about east of Hinton in the Athabasca River valley. In 1916 when the Grand Trunk Pacific rail line was temporarily closed, Dalehurst became the postal station for Hinton. Entrance (formerly Dyke), another important centre to Hinton, served as its communications centre. The original community known as Entrance was so named due to its location at the entrance to Jasper Forest Park and was on the Canadian Northern rail line north of the Athabasca River. The original site of Entrance is now known as Old Entrance.

The Canadian National Railway became the owner of both the Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk Pacific, and various portions of both lines were used by the new railway. The company, however, abandoned the use of the rail line through Bliss in 1926 and once again the rail line through Hinton was opened.

The population of Hinton experienced a boom during the 1930s when American entrepreneur Frank Seabolt and two partners opened the Hinton coal mine in 1931. Shortly thereafter, a recession caused the population to dwindle to fewer than 100 people, but the town began to rebound in 1955 with the construction of a pulp mill. The mill brought rapid growth to Hinton and a new village was developed and was named Drinnan in 1956. The two communities amalgamated on April 1, 1957, to form the present Town of Hinton.

===Hinton train collision===

On February 8, 1986, a Canadian National Railway freight train collided with a Via Rail passenger train called the &quot;Super Continental&quot;, killing twenty-three people. The Hinton train collision was the deadliest rail disaster in Canada since the Dugald rail accident of 1947, which had thirty-one fatalities, and was not surpassed until the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster in 2013, which resulted in forty-seven fatalities. It was surmised that the accident was a result of the crew of the freight train becoming incapacitated, and the resulting investigations revealed serious flaws in Canadian National Railway&#x27;s employee practises.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Hinton had a population of 9,817 living in 4,006 of its 4,405 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 9,882. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In the Canada 2016 Census conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Hinton recorded a population of 9,882 living in 3,930 of its 4,343 total private dwellings, a increase from its 2011 population of 9,640. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

The population of the Town of Hinton according to its 2009 municipal census is 9,825. The census originally counted 9,812 people within the town limits but an additional 13 were added when a long-standing annexation application was approved shortly after the census was conducted.

It is the site of the Foothills Ojibway Society (non-status First Nation).

== Attractions ==
Hinton is one of two staging areas for expeditions in the Willmore Wilderness Park, the other being Grande Cache.

<text>Animal cognition encompasses the mental capacities of non-human animals, including insect cognition. The study of animal conditioning and learning used in this field was developed from comparative psychology. It has also been strongly influenced by research in ethology, behavioral ecology, and evolutionary psychology; the alternative name cognitive ethology is sometimes used. Many behaviors associated with the term &quot;animal intelligence&quot; are also subsumed within animal cognition.

Researchers have examined animal cognition in mammals (especially primates, cetaceans, elephants, bears, dogs, cats, pigs, horses, cattle, raccoons and rodents), birds (including parrots, fowl, corvids and pigeons), reptiles (lizards, snakes, and turtles), fish and invertebrates (including cephalopods, spiders and insects).

== Historical background ==
=== Earliest inferences ===

The mind and behavior of non-human animals has captivated the human imagination for centuries. Many writers, such as Descartes, have speculated about the presence or absence of the animal mind. These speculations led to many observations of animal behavior before modern science and testing were available. This ultimately resulted in the creation of multiple hypotheses about animal intelligence.

One of Aesop&#x27;s Fables was &quot;The Crow and the Pitcher&quot;, in which a crow drops pebbles into a vessel of water until he is able to drink. This was a relatively accurate reflection of the capability of corvids to understand water displacement. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder was the earliest to attest that said story reflects the behavior of real-life corvids.

Aristotle, in his biology, hypothesized a causal chain where an animal&#x27;s sense organs transmitted information to an organ capable of making decisions, and then to a motor organ. Despite Aristotle&#x27;s cardiocentrism (mistaken belief that cognition occurred in the heart), this approached some modern understandings of information processing.

Early inferences were not necessarily precise or accurate. Nonetheless, interest in animal mental abilities, and comparisons to humans, increased with early myrmecology, the study of ant behavior, as well as the classification of humans as primates beginning with Linnaeus.

===Morgan&#x27;s Canon===

Coined by 19th-century British psychologist C. Lloyd Morgan, Morgan&#x27;s Canon remains a fundamental precept of comparative (animal) psychology. In its developed form, it states that:
In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development.

In other words, Morgan believed that anthropomorphic approaches to animal behavior were fallacious, and that people should only consider behaviour as, for example, rational, purposive or affectionate, if there is no other explanation in terms of the behaviours of more primitive life-forms to which we do not attribute those faculties.

=== From anecdote to laboratory ===
Speculation about animal intelligence gradually yielded to scientific study after Darwin placed humans and animals on a continuum, although Darwin&#x27;s largely anecdotal approach to the cognition topic would not pass scientific muster later on. This method would be expanded by his protégé George J. Romanes, who played a key role in the defense of Darwinism and its refinement over the years. Still, Romanes is most famous for two major flaws in his work: his focus on anecdotal observations and entrenched anthropomorphism. Unsatisfied with the previous approach, E. L. Thorndike brought animal behavior into the laboratory for objective scrutiny. Thorndike&#x27;s careful observations of the escape of cats, dogs, and chicks from puzzle boxes led him to conclude that what appears to the naive human observer to be intelligent behavior may be strictly attributable to simple associations. According to Thorndike, using Morgan&#x27;s Canon, the inference of animal reason, insight, or consciousness is unnecessary and misleading. At about the same time, I. P. Pavlov began his seminal studies of conditioned reflexes in dogs. Pavlov quickly abandoned attempts to infer canine mental processes; such attempts, he said, led only to disagreement and confusion. He was, however, willing to propose unseen physiological processes that might explain his observations.

=== The behavioristic half-century ===

The work of Thorndike, Pavlov and a little later of the outspoken behaviorist John B. Watson set the direction of much research on animal behavior for more than half a century. During this time there was considerable progress in understanding simple associations; notably, around 1930 the differences between Thorndike&#x27;s instrumental (or operant) conditioning and Pavlov&#x27;s classical (or Pavlovian) conditioning were clarified, first by Miller and Kanorski, and then by B. F. Skinner. Many experiments on conditioning followed; they generated some complex theories, but they made little or no reference to intervening mental processes. Probably the most explicit dismissal of the idea that mental processes control behavior was the radical behaviorism of Skinner. This view seeks to explain behavior, including &quot;private events&quot; like mental images, solely by reference to the environmental contingencies impinging on the human or animal.

Despite the predominantly behaviorist orientation of research before 1960, the rejection of mental processes in animals was not universal during those years. Influential exceptions included, for example, Wolfgang Köhler and his insightful chimpanzees and Edward Tolman whose proposed cognitive map was a significant contribution to subsequent cognitive research in both humans and animals.

=== The cognitive revolution ===

Beginning around 1960, a &quot;cognitive revolution&quot; in research on humans gradually spurred a similar transformation of research with animals. Inference to processes not directly observable became acceptable and then commonplace. An important proponent of this shift in thinking was Donald O. Hebb, who argued that &quot;mind&quot; is simply a name for processes in the head that control complex behavior, and that it is both necessary and possible to infer those processes from behavior. Animals came to be seen as &quot;goal seeking agents that acquire, store, retrieve, and internally process information at many levels of cognitive complexity&quot;.

== Methods ==
The acceleration of research on animal cognition in the last 50 years or so has led to a rapid expansion in the variety of species studied and methods employed. The remarkable behavior of large-brained animals such as primates and cetacea have claimed special attention, but all sorts of animals large and small (birds, fish, ants, bees, and others) have been brought into the laboratory or observed in carefully controlled field studies. In the laboratory, animals push levers, pull strings, dig for food, swim in water mazes, or respond to images on computer screens to get information for discrimination, attention, memory, and categorization experiments. Careful field studies explore memory for food caches, navigation by stars, communication, tool use, identification of conspecifics, and many other matters. Studies often focus on the behavior of animals in their natural environments and discuss the putative function of the behavior for the propagation and survival of the species. These developments reflect an increased cross-fertilization from related fields such as ethology and behavioral ecology. Contributions from behavioral neuroscience are beginning to clarify the physiological substrate of some inferred mental process.

Some researchers have made effective use of a Piagetian methodology, taking tasks which human children are known to master at different stages of development and investigating which of them can be performed by particular species. Others have been inspired by concerns for animal welfare and the management of domestic species; for example, Temple Grandin has harnessed her unique expertise in animal welfare and the ethical treatment of farm livestock to highlight underlying similarities between humans and other animals. From a methodological point of view, one of the main risks in this sort of work is anthropomorphism, the tendency to interpret an animal&#x27;s behavior in terms of human feelings, thoughts, and motivations.

== Research questions ==

Human and non-human animal cognition have much in common, and this is reflected in the research summarized below; most of the headings found here might also appear in an article on human cognition. Of course, research in the two also differs in important respects. Notably, much research with humans either studies or involves language, and much research with animals is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings. Following are summaries of some of the major areas of research in animal cognition.

=== Perception ===
Animals process information from eyes, ears, and other sensory organs to perceive the environment. Perceptual processes have been studied in many species, with results that are often similar to those in humans. Equally interesting are those perceptual processes that differ from, or go beyond those found in humans, such as echolocation in bats and dolphins, motion detection by skin receptors in fish, and extraordinary visual acuity, motion sensitivity and ability to see ultraviolet light in some birds.

=== Attention ===
Much of what is happening in the world at any moment is irrelevant to current behavior. Attention refers to mental processes that select relevant information, inhibit irrelevant information, and switch among these as the situation demands. Often the selective process is tuned before relevant information appears; such expectation makes for rapid selection of key stimuli when they become available. A large body of research has explored the way attention and expectation affect the behavior of non-human animals, and much of this work suggests that attention operates in birds, mammals and reptiles in much the same way that it does in humans.

==== Selective Learning ====
Animals trained to discriminate between two stimuli, say black versus white, can be said to attend to the &quot;brightness dimension&quot;, but this says little about whether this dimension is selected in preference to others. More enlightenment comes from experiments that allow the animal to choose from several alternatives. For example, several studies have shown that performance is better on, for example, a color discrimination (e.g. blue vs green) after the animal has learned another color discrimination (e.g. red vs orange) than it is after training on a different dimension such as an X shape versus an O shape. The reverse effect happens after training on forms. Thus, the earlier learning appears to affect which dimension, color or form, the animal will attend to.

Other experiments have shown that after animals have learned to respond to one aspect of the environment responsiveness to other aspects is suppressed. In &quot;blocking&quot;, for example, an animal is conditioned to respond to one stimulus (&quot;A&quot;) by pairing that stimulus with reward or punishment. After the animal responds consistently to A, a second stimulus (&quot;B&quot;) accompanies A on additional training trials. Later tests with the B stimulus alone elicit little response, suggesting that learning about B has been blocked by prior learning about A. This result supports the hypothesis that stimuli are neglected if they fail to provide new information. Thus, in the experiment just cited, the animal failed to attend to B because B added no information to that supplied by A. If true, this interpretation is an important insight into attentional processing, but this conclusion remains uncertain because blocking and several related phenomena can be explained by models of conditioning that do not invoke attention.

==== Divided attention ====
Attention is a limited resource and is not a none-or-all response: the more attention devoted to one aspect of the environment, the less is available for others. A number of experiments have studied this in animals. In one experiment, a tone and a light are presented simultaneously to pigeons. The pigeons gain a reward only by choosing the correct combination of the two stimuli (e.g. a high frequency tone together with a yellow light). The birds perform well at this task, presumably by dividing attention between the two stimuli. When only one of the stimuli varies and the other is presented at its rewarded value, discrimination improves on the variable stimulus but discrimination on the alternative stimulus worsens. These outcomes are consistent with the notion that attention is a limited resource that can be more or less focused among incoming stimuli.

==== Visual search and attentional priming ====
As noted above, the function of attention is to select information that is of special use to the animal. Visual search typically calls for this sort of selection, and search tasks have been used extensively in both humans and animals to determine the characteristics of attentional selection and the factors that control it.

Experimental research on visual search in animals was initially prompted by field observations published by Luc Tinbergen (1960). Tinbergen observed that birds are selective when foraging for insects. For example, he found that birds tended to catch the same type of insect repeatedly even though several types were available. Tinbergen suggested that this prey selection was caused by an attentional bias that improved detection of one type of insect while suppressing detection of others. This &quot;attentional priming&quot; is commonly said to result from a pretrial activation of a mental representation of the attended object, which Tinbergen called a &quot;searching image&quot;.

Tinbergen&#x27;s field observations on priming have been supported by a number of experiments. For example, Pietrewicz and Kamil (1977, 1979) presented blue jays with pictures of tree trunks upon which rested either a moth of species A, a moth of species B, or no moth at all. The birds were rewarded for pecks at a picture showing a moth. Crucially, the probability with which a particular species of moth was detected was higher after repeated trials with that species (e.g. A, A, A...) than it was after a mixture of trials (e.g. A, B, B, A, B, A, A...). These results suggest again that sequential encounters with an object can establish an attentional predisposition to see the object.

Another way to produce attentional priming in search is to provide an advance signal that is associated with the target. For example, if a person hears a song sparrow he or she may be predisposed to detect a song sparrow in a shrub, or among other birds. A number of experiments have reproduced this effect in animal subjects.

Still other experiments have explored nature of stimulus factors that affect the speed and accuracy of visual search. For example, the time taken to find a single target increases as the number of items in the visual field increases. This rise in reaction time is steep if the distracters are similar to the target, less steep if they are dissimilar, and may not occur if the distracters are very different from the target in form or color.

=== Concepts and categories ===
Fundamental but difficult to define, the concept of &quot;concept&quot; was discussed for hundreds of years by philosophers before it became a focus of psychological study. Concepts enable humans and animals to organize the world into functional groups; the groups may be composed of perceptually similar objects or events, diverse things that have a common function, relationships such as same versus different, or relations among relations such as analogies. Extensive discussions on these matters together with many references may be found in Shettleworth (2010) Wasserman and Zentall (2006) and in Zentall &quot;et al.&quot; (2008). The latter is freely available online.

==== Methods ====
Most work on animal concepts has been done with visual stimuli, which can easily be constructed and presented in great variety, but auditory and other stimuli have been used as well. Pigeons have been widely used, for they have excellent vision and are readily conditioned to respond to visual targets; other birds and a number of other animals have been studied as well.
In a typical experiment, a bird or other animal confronts a computer monitor on which a large number of pictures appear one by one, and the subject gets a reward for pecking or touching a picture of a category item and no reward for non-category items. Alternatively, a subject may be offered a choice between two or more pictures. Many experiments end with the presentation of items never seen before; successful sorting of these items shows that the animal has not simply learned many specific stimulus-response associations. A related method, sometimes used to study relational concepts, is matching-to-sample. In this task an animal sees one stimulus and then chooses between two or more alternatives, one of which is the same as the first; the animal is then rewarded for choosing the matching stimulus.

==== Perceptual categories ====
Perceptual categorization is said to occur when a person or animal responds in a similar way to a range of stimuli that share common features. For example, a squirrel climbs a tree when it sees Rex, Shep, or Trixie, which suggests that it categorizes all three as something to avoid. This sorting of instances into groups is crucial to survival. Among other things, an animal must categorize if it is to apply learning about one object (e.g. Rex bit me) to new instances of that category (dogs may bite).

==== Natural categories ====
Many animals readily classify objects by perceived differences in form or color. For example, bees or pigeons quickly learn to choose any red object and reject any green object if red leads to reward and green does not. Seemingly much more difficult is an animal&#x27;s ability to categorize natural objects that vary a great deal in color and form even while belonging to the same group. In a classic study, Richard J. Herrnstein trained pigeons to respond to the presence or absence of human beings in photographs. The birds readily learned to peck photos that contained partial or full views of humans and to avoid pecking photos with no human, despite great differences in the form, size, and color of both the humans displayed and in the non-human pictures. In follow-up studies, pigeons categorized other natural objects (e.g. trees) and after training they were able without reward to sort photos they had not seen before . Similar work has been done with natural auditory categories, for example, bird songs. Honeybees (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) are able to form concepts of &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;.

==== Functional or associative categories ====
Perceptually unrelated stimuli may come to be responded to as members of a class if they have a common use or lead to common consequences. An oft-cited study by Vaughan (1988) provides an example. Vaughan divided a large set of unrelated pictures into two arbitrary sets, A and B. Pigeons got food for pecking at pictures in set A but not for pecks at pictures in set B. After they had learned this task fairly well, the outcome was reversed: items in set B led to food and items in set A did not. Then the outcome was reversed again, and then again, and so on. Vaughan found that after 20 or more reversals, associating a reward with a few pictures in one set caused the birds to respond to the other pictures in that set without further reward as if they were thinking &quot;if these pictures in set A bring food, the others in set A must also bring food.&quot; That is, the birds now categorized the pictures in each set as functionally equivalent. Several other procedures have yielded similar results.

==== Relational or abstract categories ====
When tested in a simple stimulus matching-to-sample task (described above) many animals readily learn specific item combinations, such as &quot;touch red if the sample is red, touch green if the sample is green.&quot; But this does not demonstrate that they distinguish between &quot;same&quot; and &quot;different&quot; as general concepts. Better evidence is provided if, after training, an animal successfully makes a choice that matches a novel sample that it has never seen before. Monkeys and chimpanzees do learn to do this, as do pigeons if they are given a great deal of practice with many different stimuli. However, because the sample is presented first, successful matching might mean that the animal is simply choosing the most recently seen &quot;familiar&quot; item rather than the conceptually &quot;same&quot; item. A number of studies have attempted to distinguish these possibilities, with mixed results.

==== Rule learning ====
The use of rules has sometimes been considered an ability restricted to humans, but a number of experiments have shown evidence of simple rule learning in primates and also in other animals. Much of the evidence has come from studies of sequence learning in which the &quot;rule&quot; consists of the order in which a series of events occurs. Rule use is shown if the animal learns to discriminate different orders of events and transfers this discrimination to new events arranged in the same order. For example, Murphy &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) trained rats to discriminate between visual sequences. For one group ABA and BAB were rewarded, where A=&quot;bright light&quot; and B=&quot;dim light&quot;. Other stimulus triplets were not rewarded. The rats learned the visual sequence, although both bright and dim lights were equally associated with reward. More importantly, in a second experiment with auditory stimuli, rats responded correctly to sequences of novel stimuli that were arranged in the same order as those previously learned. Similar sequence learning has been demonstrated in birds and other animals as well.

=== Memory ===
The categories that have been developed to analyze human memory (short term memory, long term memory, working memory) have been applied to the study of animal memory, and some of the phenomena characteristic of human short term memory (e.g. the serial position effect) have been detected in animals, particularly monkeys. However most progress has been made in the analysis of spatial memory; some of this work has sought to clarify the physiological basis of spatial memory and the role of the hippocampus; other work has explored the spatial memory of scatter-hoarder animals such as Clark&#x27;s nutcracker, certain jays, tits and certain squirrels, whose ecological niches require them to remember the locations of thousands of caches, often following radical changes in the environment.

Memory has been widely investigated in foraging honeybees, &quot;Apis mellifera&quot;, which use both transient short-term working memory that is non-feeder specific and a feeder specific
long-term reference memory. Memory induced in a free-flying honeybee by a single learning trial lasts for days and, by three learning trials, for a lifetime. &quot;Bombus terrestris audax&quot; workers vary in their effort investment towards memorising flower locations, with smaller workers less &quot;able&quot; to be selective and thus less &quot;interested&quot; in which flowers are richer sugar sources. Meanwhile, bigger &quot;B. t. audax&quot; workers have more carrying capacity and thus more reason to memorise that information, and so they do. Slugs, &quot;Limax flavus&quot;, have a short-term memory of approximately 1 min and long-term memory of 1 month.

====Methods====
As in humans, research with animals distinguishes between &quot;working&quot; or &quot;short-term&quot; memory from &quot;reference&quot; or long-term memory. Tests of working memory evaluate memory for events that happened in the recent past, usually within the last few seconds or minutes. Tests of reference memory evaluate memory for regularities such as &quot;pressing a lever brings food&quot; or &quot;children give me peanuts&quot;.

=====Habituation=====

This is one of the simplest tests for memory spanning a short time interval. The test compares an animal&#x27;s response to a stimulus or event on one occasion to its response on a previous occasion. If the second response differs consistently from the first, the animal must have remembered something about the first, unless some other factor such as motivation, sensory sensitivity, or the test stimulus has changed.

=====Delayed response=====
Delayed response tasks are often used to study short-term memory in animals. Introduced by Hunter (1913), a typical delayed response task presents an animal with a stimulus such as colored light, and after a short time interval the animal chooses among alternatives that match the stimulus, or are related to the stimulus in some other way. In Hunter&#x27;s studies, for example, a light appeared briefly in one of three goal boxes and then later the animal chose among the boxes, finding food behind the one that had been lighted. Most research has been done with some variation of the &quot;delayed matching-to-sample&quot; task. For example, in the initial study with this task, a pigeon was presented with a flickering or steady light. Then, a few seconds later, two pecking keys were illuminated, one with a steady light and one with a flickering light. The bird got food if it pecked the key that matched the original stimulus.

A commonly-used variation of the matching-to-sample task requires the animal to use the initial stimulus to control a later choice between different stimuli. For example, if the initial stimulus is a black circle, the animal learns to choose &quot;red&quot; after the delay; if it is a black square, the correct choice is &quot;green&quot;. Ingenious variations of this method have been used to explore many aspects of memory, including forgetting due to interference and memory for multiple items.

=====Radial arm maze=====

The radial arm maze is used to test memory for spatial location and to determine the mental processes by which location is determined. In a radial maze test, an animal is placed on a small platform from which paths lead in various directions to goal boxes; the animal finds food in one or more goal boxes. Having found food in a box, the animal must return to the central platform. The maze may be used to test both reference and working memory. Suppose, for example, that over a number of sessions the same 4 arms of an 8-arm maze always lead to food. If in a later test session the animal goes to a box that has never been baited, this indicates a failure of reference memory. On the other hand, if the animal goes to a box that it has already emptied during the same test session, this indicates a failure of working memory. Various confounding factors, such as odor cues, are carefully controlled in such experiments.

=====Water maze=====

The water maze is used to test an animal&#x27;s memory for spatial location and to discover how an animal is able to determine locations. Typically the maze is a circular tank filled with water that has been made milky so that it is opaque. Located somewhere in the maze is a small platform placed just below the surface of the water. When placed in the tank, the animal swims around until it finds and climbs up on the platform. With practice, the animal finds the platform more and more quickly. Reference memory is assessed by removing the platform and observing the relative amount of time the animal spends swimming in the area where the platform had been located. Visual and other cues in and around the tank may be varied to assess the animal&#x27;s reliance on landmarks and the geometric relations among them.

=====Novel object recognition test=====
The novel object recognition (NOR) test is an animal behavior test that is primarily used to assess memory alterations in rodents. It is a simple behavioral test that is based on a rodents innate exploratory behavior. The test is divided into three phases: habituation, training/adaptation and test phase. During the habituation phase the animal is placed in an empty test arena. This is followed by the adaptation phase, where the animal is placed in the arena with two identical objects. In the third phase, the test phase, the animal is placed in the arena with one of the familiar objects from the previous phase and with one novel object. Based on the rodents innate curiosity, the animals that remember the familiar object will spend more time on investigating the novel object.

=== Spatial cognition ===
Whether an animal ranges over a territory measured in square kilometers or square meters, its survival typically depends on its ability to do such things as find a food source and then return to its nest. Sometimes such a task can be performed rather simply, for example by following a chemical trail. Typically, however, the animal must somehow acquire and use information about locations, directions, and distances. The following paragraphs outline some of the ways that animals do this. 
*Beacons Animals often learn what their nest or other goal looks like, and if it is within sight they may simply move toward it; it is said to serve as a &quot;beacon&quot;.
*Landmarks When an animal is unable to see its goal, it may learn the appearance of nearby objects and use these landmarks as guides. Researchers working with birds and bees have demonstrated this by moving prominent objects in the vicinity of nest sites, causing returning foragers to hunt for their nest in a new location.
*Dead reckoning, also known as &quot;path integration&quot;, is the process of computing one&#x27;s position by starting from a known location and keeping track of the distances and directions subsequently traveled. Classic experiments have shown that the desert ant keeps track of its position in this way as it wanders for many meters searching for food. Though it travels in a randomly twisted path, it heads straight home when it finds food. However, if the ant is picked up and released some meters to the east, for example, it heads for a location displaced by the same amount to the east of its home nest.
*Cognitive maps Some animals appear to construct a cognitive map of their surroundings, meaning that they acquire and use information that enables them to compute how far and in what direction to go to get from one location to another. Such a map-like representation is thought to be used, for example, when an animal goes directly from one food source to another even though its previous experience has involved only travel between each source and home. Research in this area has also explored such topics as the use of geometric properties of the environment by rats and pigeons, and the ability of rats to represent a spatial pattern in either radial arm mazes or water mazes. Spatial cognition is used in visual search when an animal or human searches their environment for specific objects to focus on among other objects in the environment.
*Detour behaviour Some animals appear to have an advanced understanding of their spatial environment and will not take the most direct route if this confers an advantage to them. Some jumping spiders take an indirect route to prey rather than the most direct route, thereby indicating flexibility in behaviour and route planning, and possibly insight learning.

====Long-distance navigation; homing====
Many animals travel hundreds or thousands of miles in seasonal migrations or returns to breeding grounds. They may be guided by the Sun, the stars, the polarization of light, magnetic cues, olfactory cues, winds, or a combination of these. 

It has been hypothesized that animals such as apes and wolves are good at spatial cognition because this skill is necessary for survival. Some researchers argue that this ability may have diminished somewhat in dogs because humans have provided necessities such as food and shelter during some 15,000 years of domestication.

=== Timing ===
==== Time of day: circadian rhythms ====

The behavior of most animals is synchronized with the earth&#x27;s daily light-dark cycle. Thus, many animals are active during the day, others are active at night, still others near dawn and dusk. Though one might think that these &quot;circadian rhythms&quot; are controlled simply by the presence or absence of light, nearly every animal that has been studied has been shown to have a &quot;biological clock&quot; that yields cycles of activity even when the animal is in constant illumination or darkness. Circadian rhythms are so automatic and fundamental to living things – they occur even in plants – that they are usually discussed separately from cognitive processes, and the reader is referred to the main article (Circadian rhythms) for further information.

==== Interval timing ====
Survival often depends on an animal&#x27;s ability to time intervals. For example, rufous hummingbirds feed on the nectar of flowers, and they often return to the same flower, but only after the flower has had enough time to replenish its supply of nectar. In one experiment hummingbirds fed on artificial flowers that quickly emptied of nectar but were refilled at some fixed time (e.g. twenty minutes) later. The birds learned to come back to the flowers at about the right time, learning the refill rates of up to eight separate flowers and remembering how long ago they had visited each one.

The details of interval timing have been studied in a number of species. One of the most common methods is the &quot;peak procedure&quot;. In a typical experiment, a rat in an operant chamber presses a lever for food. A light comes on, a lever-press brings a food pellet at a fixed later time, say 10 seconds, and then the light goes off. Timing is measured during occasional test trials on which no food is presented and the light stays on. On these test trials, the rat presses the lever more and more until about 10 sec and then, when no food comes, gradually stops pressing. The time at which the rat presses most on these test trials is taken to be its estimate of the payoff time.

Experiments using the peak procedure and other methods have shown that animals can time short intervals quite exactly, can time more than one event at once, and can integrate time with spatial and other cues. Such tests have also been used for quantitative tests of theories of animal timing, such as Gibbon&#x27;s Scalar Expectancy Theory (&quot;SET&quot;), Killeen&#x27;s Behavioral Theory of Timing, and Machado&#x27;s Learning to Time model. No one theory has yet gained unanimous agreement.

=== Tool and weapon use ===

Although tool use was long assumed to be a uniquely human trait, there is now much evidence that many animals use tools, including mammals, birds, fish, cephalopods and insects. Discussions of tool use often involve a debate about what constitutes a &quot;tool&quot;, and they often consider the relation of tool use to the animal&#x27;s intelligence and brain size.

====Mammals====

Tool use has been reported many times in both wild and captive primates, particularly the great apes. The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting (mammals, invertebrates, fish), collecting honey, processing food (nuts, fruits, vegetables and seeds), collecting water, weapons and shelter. Research in 2007 shows that chimpanzees in the Fongoli savannah sharpen sticks to use as spears when hunting, considered the first evidence of systematic use of weapons in a species other than humans. Other mammals that spontaneously use tools in the wild or in captivity include elephants, bears, cetaceans, sea otters and mongooses.

====Birds====

Several species of birds have been observed to use tools in the wild, including warblers, parrots, Egyptian vultures, brown-headed nuthatches, gulls and owls. Some species, such as the woodpecker finch of the Galapagos Islands, use particular tools as an essential part of their foraging behavior. However, these behaviors are often quite inflexible and cannot be applied effectively in new situations. A great many species of birds build nests with a wide range of complexities, but although nest-building behaviour fulfills the criteria of some definitions of &quot;tool-use&quot;, this is not the case with other definitions.

Several species of corvids have been trained to use tools in controlled experiments. One species examined extensively under laboratory conditions is the New Caledonian crow. One individual called &quot;Betty&quot; spontaneously made a wire tool to solve a novel problem. She was being tested to see whether she would select a wire hook rather than a straight wire to pull a little bucket of meat out of a well. Betty tried poking the straight wire at the meat. After a series of failures with this direct approach, she withdrew the wire and began directing it at the bottom of the well, which was secured to its base with duct tape. The wire soon became stuck, whereupon Betty pulled it sideways, bending it and unsticking it. She then inserted the hook into the well and extracted the meat. In all but one of 10 subsequent trials with only straight wire provided, she also made and used a hook in the same manner, but not before trying the straight wire first.

Another bird that is highly studied for its intelligence is the African Gray Parrot. American animal behaviorist and psychologist Irene Pepperberg vindicated that African Grays possess cognitive abilities. Pepperberg used a bird named &quot;Alex&quot; in her trials and was able to prove that parrots could associate sound and meaning, demolishing long-held theories that birds were only capable of mimicking human voices. Studies by other researchers have determined that African Grays can use deductive reasoning to correctly choose between pairs of boxes containing food and boxes that are empty. Until Pepperberg began this research in the 1970s, few scientists had studied intelligence in parrots, and few do today. Most inquiries have instead focused on monkeys, chimpanzees, gorillas, and dolphins, all of which are much more difficult to raise, feed, and handle. By the late 1980s, Alex had learned the names of more than 50 different objects, five shapes, and seven colors. He&#x27;d also learned what &quot;same&quot; and &quot;different&quot; mean—a step crucial in human intellectual development

====Fish====

Several species of wrasses have been observed using rocks as anvils to crack bivalve (scallops, urchins and clams) shells. This behavior was first filmed in an orange-dotted tuskfish (&quot;Choerodon anchorago&quot;) in 2009 by Giacomo Bernardi. The fish fans sand to unearth the bivalve, takes it into its mouth, swims several meters to a rock, which it then uses as an anvil by smashing the mollusc apart with sideward thrashes of the head. This behaviour has also been recorded in a blackspot tuskfish (&quot;Choerodon schoenleinii&quot;) on Australia&#x27;s Great Barrier Reef, yellowhead wrasse (&quot;Halichoeres garnoti&quot;) in Florida and a six-bar wrasse (&quot;Thalassoma hardwicke&quot;) in an aquarium setting. These species are at opposite ends of the phylogenetic tree in this family, so this behaviour may be a deep-seated trait in all wrasses.

====Invertebrates====
Cephalopods are capable of complex tasks, thus earning them the reputation of being among the smartest of invertebrates. For example, octopuses can open jars to get the contents inside and have remarkable ability to learn new skills from the moment they are born. Some cephalopods are known to use coconut shells for protection or camouflage. Cephalopod cognitive evolution is hypothesized to have been shaped primarily by predatory and foraging pressures, but a challenging mating context may also have played a role.

Ants of the species &quot;Conomyrma bicolor&quot; pick up stones and other small objects with their mandibles and drop them down the vertical entrances of rival colonies, allowing workers to forage for food without competition.

=== Reasoning and problem solving ===

It is clear that animals of quite a range of species are capable of solving problems that appear to require abstract reasoning; Wolfgang Köhler&#x27;s (1917) work with chimpanzees is a famous early example. He observed that chimpanzees did not use trial and error to solve problems such as retrieving bananas hung out of reach. Instead, they behaved in a manner that was &quot;unwaveringly purposeful&quot;, spontaneously placing boxes so that they could climb to reach the fruit. Modern research has identified similar behavior in animals usually thought of as much less intelligent, if appropriate pre-training is given. Causal reasoning has also been observed in rooks and New Caledonian crows.

It has been shown that Barbados bullfinches (&quot;Loxigilla barbadensis&quot;) from urbanized areas are better at innovative problem-solving tasks than bullfinches from rural environments, but that they did not differ in colour discrimination learning.

===Cognitive bias===
A cognitive bias refers to a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, whereby inferences about other individuals or situations may be drawn in an illogical fashion.

Cognitive bias is sometimes illustrated by using answers to the question &quot;Is the glass half empty or half full?&quot;. Choosing &quot;half empty&quot; is supposed to indicate pessimism whereas choosing &quot;half full&quot; indicates optimism. To test this in animals, an individual is trained to anticipate that stimulus A, e.g. a 100 Hz tone, precedes a positive event, e.g. highly desired food is delivered when a lever is pressed by the animal. The same individual is trained to anticipate that stimulus B, e.g. a 900 Hz tone, precedes a negative event, e.g. bland food is delivered when the animal presses a lever. The animal is then tested by being given an intermediate stimulus C, e.g. a 500 Hz tone, and observing whether the animal presses the lever associated with the positive or negative reward. This has been suggested to indicate whether the animal is in a positive or negative mood.

In a study that used this approach, rats that were playfully tickled responded differently than rats that were simply handled. The rats that had been tickled were more optimistic than the handled rats. The authors suggested that they had demonstrated &quot;...for the first time a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model&quot;.

There is some evidence for cognitive bias in a number of species, including rats, dogs, rhesus macaques, sheep, chicks, starlings and honeybees.

=== Language ===
The modeling of human language in animals is known as animal language research. In addition to the ape-language experiments mentioned above, there have also been more or less successful attempts to teach language or language-like behavior to some non-primate species, including parrots and great spotted woodpeckers. Arguing from his own results with the animal Nim Chimpsky and his analysis of others results, Herbert Terrace criticized the idea that chimps can produce new sentences. Shortly thereafter Louis Herman published research on artificial language comprehension in the bottlenose dolphin. Though this sort of research has been controversial, especially among cognitive linguists, many researchers agree that many animals can understand the meaning of individual words, and that some may understand simple sentences and syntactic variations. Elephants can remember tone, melody, and recognise more than 20 words. Nevertheless, there is little evidence that any animal can produce new strings of symbols that correspond to new sentences.

=== Insight ===

Wolfgang Köhler is usually credited with introducing the concept of insight into experimental psychology. Working with chimpanzees, Köhler came to dispute Edward Thorndike&#x27;s theory that animals must solve problems gradually, by trial and error. He said that Thorndike&#x27;s animals could only use trial and error because the situation precluded other forms of problem solving. He provided chimps with a relatively unstructured situation, and he observed sudden &quot;ah-ha!&quot; insightful changes of behavior, as, for example, when a chimp suddenly moved a box into position so that it could retrieve a banana. More recently, Asian elephants (&quot;Elephas maximus&quot;) were shown to exhibit similar insightful problem solving. A male was observed moving a box to a position where it could be stood upon to reach food that had been deliberately hung out of reach.

=== Numeracy ===

A variety of studies indicates that animals are able to use and communicate quantitative information, and that some can count in a rudimentary way. Some examples of this research follow.

In one study, rhesus monkeys viewed visual displays containing, for example, 1, 2, 3, or 4 items of different sorts. They were trained to respond to them in several ways involving numerical ordering, for example touching &quot;1&quot; first, &quot;2&quot; second and so on. When tested with displays containing items they had never seen before, they continued to respond to them in order. The authors conclude that monkeys can represent the numerosities 1 to 9 at least on an ordinal scale.

Ants are able to use quantitative values and transmit this information. For instance, ants of several species are able to estimate quite precisely numbers of encounters with members of other colonies on their feeding territories. 
Moreover, ants of some species can count up to 20 and add and subtract numbers within 5. 
This has been demonstrated using carefully crafted experiments based on measuring the time it takes for a scouting ant to pass the information to its team about the branch of an experimental maze on which food can be found.

Numeracy has been described in the yellow mealworm beetle (&quot;Tenebrio molitor&quot;) and the honeybee.

Western lowland gorillas given the choice between two food trays demonstrated the ability to choose the tray with more food items at a rate higher than chance after training. In a similar task, chimpanzees chose the option with the larger amount of food. Salamanders given a choice between two displays with differing amounts of fruit flies, used as a food reward, reliably choose the display with more flies, as shown in a particular experiment.

Other experiments have been conducted that show animals&#x27; abilities to differentiate between non-food quantities. American black bears demonstrated quantity differentiation abilities in a task with a computer screen. The bears were trained to touch a computer monitor with a paw or nose to choose a quantity of dots in one of two boxes on the screen. Each bear was trained with reinforcement to pick a larger or smaller amount. During training, the bears were rewarded with food for a correct response. All bears performed better than what random error predicted on the trials with static, non-moving dots, indicating that they could differentiate between the two quantities. The bears choosing correctly in congruent (number of dots coincided with area of the dots) and incongruent (number of dots did not coincide with area of the dots) trials suggests that they were indeed choosing between quantities that appeared on the screen, not just a larger or smaller retinal image, which would indicate they are only judging size.

Bottlenose dolphins have shown the ability to choose an array with fewer dots compared to one with more dots. Experimenters set up two boards showing various numbers of dots in a poolside setup. The dolphins were initially trained to choose the board with the fewer number of dots. This was done by rewarding the dolphin when it chose the board with the fewer number of dots. In the experimental trials, two boards were set up, and the dolphin would emerge from the water and point to one board. The dolphins chose the arrays with fewer dots at a rate much larger than chance, indicating they can differentiate between quantities.
A particular grey parrot, after training, has shown the ability to differentiate between the numbers zero through six using vocalizations. After number and vocalization training, this was done by asking the parrot how many objects there were in a display. The parrot was able to identify the correct amount at a rate higher than chance.
Angelfish, when put in an unfamiliar environment will group together with conspecifics, an action named shoaling. Given the choice between two groups of differing size, the angelfish will choose the larger of the two groups. This can be seen with a discrimination ratio of 2:1 or greater, such that, as long as one group has at least twice the fish as another group, it will join the larger one.

Monitor lizards have been shown to be capable of numeracy, and some species can distinguish among numbers up to six.

===Sapience===

As the cognitive ability and intelligence in non-human animals cannot be measured with verbal scales, it has been measured using a variety of methods that involve such things as habit reversal, social learning, and responses to novelty. Principal component analysis and factor analytic studies have shown that a single factor of intelligence is responsible for 47% of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in primates and between 55% and 60% of the variance in mice. These values are similar to the accepted variance in IQ explained by a similar single factor known as the general factor of intelligence in humans (40-50%). However, results from a recent meta-analysis suggest that the average correlation between performance scores on various cognitive tasks is only 0.18. Results from this study suggest that current evidence for general intelligence is weak in non-human animals.

The general factor of intelligence, or &quot;g&quot; factor, is a psychometric construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual&#x27;s scores on various measures of cognitive abilities. It has been suggested that &quot;g&quot; is related to evolutionary life histories and the evolution of intelligence as well as to social learning and cultural intelligence. Non-human models of &quot;g&quot; have been used in genetic and neurological research on intelligence to help understand the mechanisms behind variation in &quot;g&quot;.

===Theory of mind===

Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states, e.g. intents, desires, pretending, knowledge, to oneself and others and to understand that others have desires, intentions, and perspectives that are different from one&#x27;s own.

Some research with ravens provides an example of evidence for theory of mind in a non-human species. Ravens are members of the family Corvidae, which is widely regarded as having high cognitive abilities. These birds have been observed to hide their food when dominant ravens are visible and audible at the same time. Based on this observation, ravens were tested for their understanding of &quot;seeing&quot; as a mental state. In a first step, the birds protected their cache when dominants were visible but not when they could only be heard from an adjacent room. In the next step, they had access to a small peephole which allowed them to see into the adjacent room. With the peephole open, the ravens guarded their caches against discovery when they could hear dominants in the adjacent room, even when the dominant&#x27;s sounds were playbacks of recordings.

=== Consciousness ===

The sense in which animals can be said to have self-consciousness or a self-concept has been hotly debated. The best known research technique in this area is the mirror test devised by Gordon G. Gallup, in which an animal&#x27;s skin is marked in some way while it is asleep or sedated, and it is then allowed to see its reflection in a mirror; if the animal spontaneously directs grooming behavior towards the mark, that is taken as an indication that it is aware of itself. Self-awareness, by this criterion, has been reported for chimpanzees and also for other great apes, the European magpie, some cetaceans and an Asian elephant, but not for monkeys. The mirror test has been criticized by researchers because it is entirely focused on vision, the primary sense in humans, while other species rely more heavily on other senses such as the sense of smell in dogs. 

It has been suggested that metacognition in some animals provides some evidence for cognitive self-awareness. The great apes, dolphins, and rhesus monkeys have demonstrated the ability to monitor their own mental states and use an &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; response to avoid answering difficult questions. Unlike the mirror test, which reveals awareness of the condition of one&#x27;s own body, this uncertainty monitoring is thought to reveal awareness of one&#x27;s internal mental state. A 2007 study has provided some evidence for metacognition in rats, although this interpretation has been questioned. These species might also be aware of the strength of their memories.

Some researchers propose that animal calls and other vocal behaviors provide evidence of consciousness. This idea arose from research on children&#x27;s crib talk by Weir (1962) and in investigations of early speech in children by Greenfield and others (1976). Some such research has been done with a macaw (see Arielle).

In July, 2012 during the &quot;Consciousness in Human and Nonhuman Animals&quot; conference in Cambridge a group of scientists announced and signed a declaration with the following conclusions:
== Biological constraints ==
Instinctive drift can influence the interpretation of cognitive research. Instinctive drift is the tendency of an animal to revert to instinctive behaviors that can interfere with learned responses. The concept originated with Keller and Marian Breland when they taught a raccoon to put coins into a box. The raccoon drifted to its instinctive behavior of rubbing the coins with its paws, as it would do when foraging for food.

Animal ability to process and respond to stimuli is correlated with brain size. Small-brain animals tend to show simple behaviors that are less dependent on learning than those of large-brained animals. Vertebrates, particularly mammals, have larger brains and complex behavior that changes with experience. A formula called the encephalization quotient (EQ) expresses a relationship between brain and body size; it was developed by H.J. Jerison in the late 1960s. When the encephalization quotient is plotted as a curve, an animal with an EQ above the curve is expected to show more cognitive ability than the average animal of its size, whereas an animal with an EQ below the curve is expected to have less. Various formulas been suggested, but the equation Ew(brain) = 0.12w(body)2/3 has been found to fit data from a sample of mammals. The formula is suggestive at best, and should only be applied to non-mammals with extreme caution. For some of the other vertebrate classes, the power of 3/4 rather than 2/3 is sometimes used, and for many groups of invertebrates, the formula may not give meaningful results.

== Experimental evidence against animal cognition ==
Several experiments cannot be readily reconciled with the belief that some animal species are intelligent, insightful, or possess a theory of mind.

Jean-Henri Fabre (1823–1915), setting the stage for all subsequent experiments of this kind, argued that insects &quot;obey their compelling instinct, without realizing what they do&quot;. For instance, to understand that she can grab her paralyzed prey by a leg instead of an antenna is utterly beyond the powers of a sand wasp. &quot;Her actions are like a series of echoes each awakening the next in a settled order, which allows none to sound until the previous one has sounded.&quot; Fabre&#x27;s numerous experiments led him, in turn, to the view that scientists often try to &quot;exalt animals&quot; instead of objectively studying them.

C. Lloyd Morgan&#x27;s (1852–1936) observations suggested to him that prima facie intelligent behavior in animals is often the result of either instincts or trial and error. For instance, most visitors watching Morgan&#x27;s dog smoothly lifting a latch with the back of its head (and thereby opening a garden gate and escaping) were convinced that the dog&#x27;s actions involved thinking. Morgan, however, carefully observed the dog&#x27;s prior, random, purposeless actions and argued that they involved &quot;continued trial and failure, until a happy effect is reached&quot;, rather than &quot;methodical planning&quot;.

E. L. Thorndike (1874–1949) placed hungry cats and dogs in enclosures &quot;from which they could escape by some simple act, such as pulling at a loop of cord&quot;. Their behavior suggested to him that they did not &quot;possess the power of rationality&quot;. Most books about animal behavior, Thorndike wrote, &quot;do not give us a psychology, but rather a eulogy of animals&quot;.

Although Wolfgang Köhler&#x27;s experiments are often cited as providing support for the animal cognition hypothesis, his book is replete with counterexamples. For instance, he placed chimpanzees in a situation where they could only get bananas by removing a box. The chimpanzee, Köhler observed, &quot;has special difficulty in solving such problems; he often draws into a situation the strangest and most distant tools, and adopts the most peculiar methods, rather than remove a simple obstacle which could be displaced with perfect ease&quot;.

Daniel J. Povinelli and Timothy Eddy of the University of Louisiana showed that young chimpanzees, when given a choice between two food providers, were just as likely to beg food from a person who could see the begging gesture as from a person who could not, thereby raising the possibility that young chimpanzees do not understand that people see.

Moty Nissani of Wayne State University trained Burmese logging elephants to lift a lid in order to retrieve food from a bucket. The lid was then placed on the ground alongside the bucket (where it no longer obstructed access to the food) while the treat was simultaneously placed inside the bucket. All elephants continued to toss the lid before retrieving the reward, thus suggesting that elephants do not grasp simple causal relationships.

== Cognitive faculty by species ==
A traditionally common image is the &quot;scala naturae&quot;, the ladder of nature on which animals of different species occupy successively higher rungs, with humans typically at the top. However, there is some disagreement with the use of such a hierarchy, with some critics saying it may be necessary to understand specific cognitive capacities as adaptations to differing ecological niches. Some biologists argue that humans are not, in fact, the smartest animal, and that no animal can be characterized as the smartest, given that some animals have superior cognitive skills in certain areas. This contrasts with evolutionary psychologists such as John Tooby, who assess, based on the large list of related unique characteristics that humans do possess, that humans evolved to fill a unique &quot;cognitive niche&quot; and can fairly be characterized as the smartest animal.

Whether fairly or not, the performance of animals is often compared to that of humans on cognitive tasks. Our closest biological relatives, the great apes, tend to perform most like humans. Among the birds, corvids and parrots have typically been found to perform well on human-like tasks. Some octopodes have also been shown to exhibit a number of higher-level skills such as tool use, but the amount of research on cephalopod intelligence is still limited. Baboons have been shown to be capable of recognizing words.

The average bird or mammal, both usually endotherms, have average brain-to-body ratios ten times larger than a typical ectotherm vertebrate. This has contributed to a common perception amongst researchers that mammals and birds share similar &quot;advanced&quot; cognitive characteristics as humans, while other vertebrates such as teleost fishes are more &quot;primitive&quot;, which has led to them being understudied. Despite this, increasing evidence indicates that fish possess not just capabilities that cannot be explained through Pavlovian and operant conditioning alone, such as reversal learning, novel obstacle avoidance, and passing simultaneous two-choice tasks, but also even more complex capabilities such as navigational cognitive mapping, inhibitory motor control, and empathy enabled by oxytocin to sense fear in other fish. Similarly in reptiles, a 2019 review of evidence indicates they can experience numerous emotions, such as pleasure and anxiety.

<doc id="425943" wikidata="Q1437653" url="?curid=425943" title="Faà di Bruno's formula">
<text>Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula is an identity in mathematics generalizing the chain rule to higher derivatives. It is named after , although he was not the first to state or prove the formula. In 1800, more than 50 years before Faà di Bruno, the French mathematician Louis François Antoine Arbogast had stated the formula in a calculus textbook, which is considered to be the first published reference on the subject.

Perhaps the most well-known form of Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula says that

formula_1

where the sum is over all formula_2-tuples of nonnegative integers formula_3 satisfying the constraint

formula_4

Sometimes, to give it a memorable pattern, it is written in a way in which the coefficients that have the combinatorial interpretation discussed below are less explicit:

:formula_5

Combining the terms with the same value of formula_6
and noticing that formula_7 has to be zero for formula_8 leads to a somewhat simpler formula expressed in terms of partial (or incomplete) exponential Bell polynomials 
formula_9, formula_10:

:formula_11

== Combinatorial form ==

The formula has a &quot;combinatorial&quot; form:

:formula_12

where

* formula_13 runs through the set formula_14 of all partitions of the set formula_15,
*&quot;formula_16&quot; means the variable formula_17 runs through the list of all of the &quot;blocks&quot; of the partition formula_13, and
*formula_19 denotes the cardinality of the set formula_20 (so that formula_21 is the number of blocks in the partition formula_13 and formula_23 is the size of the block formula_17).

==Example==
The following is a concrete explanation of the combinatorial form for the formula_25 case.

:formula_26

The pattern is:

:formula_27

The factor formula_28 corresponds to the partition 2 + 1 + 1 of the integer 4, in the obvious way. The factor formula_29 that goes with it corresponds to the fact that there are &quot;three&quot; summands in that partition. The coefficient 6 that goes with those factors corresponds to the fact that there are exactly six partitions of a set of four members that break it into one part of size 2 and two parts of size 1.

Similarly, the factor formula_30 in the third line corresponds to the partition 2 + 2 of the integer 4, (4, because we are finding the fourth derivative), while formula_31 corresponds to the fact that there are &quot;two&quot; summands (2 + 2) in that partition. The coefficient 3 corresponds to the fact that there are formula_32 ways of partitioning 4 objects into groups of 2. The same concept applies to the others.

A memorizable scheme is as follows:

: formula_33

==Variations==

===Multivariate version===

Let formula_34. Then the following identity holds regardless of whether the formula_2 variables are all distinct, or all identical, or partitioned into several distinguishable classes of indistinguishable variables (if it seems opaque, see the very concrete example below):

:formula_36

where (as above)

* formula_13 runs through the set formula_14 of all partitions of the set formula_15,
*&quot;formula_16&quot; means the variable formula_17 runs through the list of all of the &quot;blocks&quot; of the partition formula_13, and
*formula_19 denotes the cardinality of the set formula_20 (so that formula_21 is the number of blocks in the partition formula_13 and 
formula_23 is the size of the block formula_17).

More general versions hold for cases where the all functions are vector- and even Banach-space-valued. In this case one needs to consider the Fréchet derivative or Gateaux derivative.

; Example

The five terms in the following expression correspond in the obvious way to the five partitions of the set formula_49, and in each case the order of the derivative of formula_50 is the number of parts in the partition:

:formula_51

If the three variables are indistinguishable from each other, then three of the five terms above are also indistinguishable from each other, and then we have the classic one-variable formula.

===Formal power series version===
Suppose formula_52 and formula_53 are formal power series and formula_54.

Then the composition formula_55 is again a formal power series,
:formula_56
where formula_57 and the other coefficient formula_58 for formula_59 
can be expressed as a sum over compositions of formula_2 or as an equivalent sum over integer partitions of formula_2:
:formula_62
where 
:formula_63
is the set of compositions of formula_2 with formula_65 denoting the number of parts,

or
:formula_66
where
:formula_67
is the set of partitions of formula_2 into formula_65 parts, in frequency-of-parts form.

The first form is obtained by picking out the coefficient of formula_70
in formula_71 &quot;by inspection&quot;, and the second form
is then obtained by collecting like terms, or alternatively, by applying the multinomial theorem.

The special case formula_72, formula_73 gives the exponential formula.
The special case formula_74, formula_75
gives an expression for the reciprocal of the formal power series 
formula_76 in the case formula_77.

Stanley
gives a version for exponential power series.
In the formal power series

:formula_78

we have the formula_2th derivative at 0:

:formula_80

This should not be construed as the value of a function, since these series are purely formal; there is no such thing as convergence or divergence in this context.

If

:formula_81

and

:formula_82

and

:formula_83

then the coefficient formula_58 (which would be the formula_2th derivative of formula_86 evaluated at 0 if we were dealing with convergent series rather than formal power series) is given by

:formula_87

where formula_13 runs through the set of all partitions of the set formula_15 and formula_90
are the blocks of the partition formula_13, and formula_92
is the number of members of the formula_93th block, for formula_94.

This version of the formula is particularly well suited to the purposes of combinatorics.

We can also write with respect to the notation above

:formula_95

where formula_96 are Bell polynomials.

===A special case===

If formula_97, then all of the derivatives of formula_50 are the same and are a factor common to every term: 

:formula_99

where formula_100 is the &quot;n&quot;th complete exponential Bell polynomial.

In case formula_101 is a cumulant-generating function, then formula_102
is a moment-generating function, and the polynomial in various derivatives of formula_103 is the polynomial that expresses the moments as functions of the cumulants.

<doc id="425946" wikidata="Q800866" url="?curid=425946" title="Hachinohe Station">
<text>is a railway station operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) in Hachinohe, Aomori, Japan.

==Lines==
Hachinohe Station is served by the high-speed Tōhoku Shinkansen line between and , and forms the starting point of the Hachinohe Line to . Local services are operated by the third sector Aoimori Railway on the section of the former JR Tōhoku Main Line between and . It is one of six principal stations served by the Aoimori Railway Line and is the easternmost high-speed Shinkansen railway station in Japan.

==Station layout==
Hachinohe is an elevated station with one side platform and two island platforms serving five tracks for regular services, and two island platforms serving four tracks for Tōhoku Shinkansen services. The station has a &quot;Midori no Madoguchi&quot; staffed ticket office.

===Platforms===



==History==

The station began operation as on the Nippon Railway on September 1, 1891. Initially, the construction of a railroad close to the coast was opposed by the Imperial Japanese Army for defensive purposes, so the station was constructed at a considerable distance inland from the town center. The Hachinohe Line began operations on January 4, 1894, from Hachinohe Station. The Nippon Railway was nationalized on November 1, 1906, and Shiriuchi Station became a station on the Japanese Government Railways (JGR), which became the Japanese National Railways (JNR) after World War II. From 1929 to 1969, the now-defunct Nambu Railway also had its terminus at Shiriuchi Station. On April 1, 1971, Shiriuchi Station was renamed Hachinohe Station. The station previously named Hachinohe Station was renamed Hon-Hachinohe Station. Freight operations were transferred to the Hachinohe Freight Terminal later that year and were discontinued completely from 1986. With the privatization of JNR on April 1, 1987, the station came under the operational control of JR East.

A new station building was opened on July 1, 2002, and Tōhoku Shinkansen services began operation from December 12, 2002, with operations of the Tōhoku Main Line from Hachinohe to the border of Iwate Prefecture transferred to the new Aoimori Railway. Following the opening of the Tōhoku Shinkansen extension to Shin-Aomori on December 4, 2010, all Tōhoku Main Line local services through the station were transferred to the Aoimori Railway.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2015, the JR East portion of the station was used by an average of 4,491 passengers daily (boarding passengers only).

<text>Eliot Coleman (born 1938) is an American farmer, author, agricultural researcher and educator, and proponent of organic farming. He wrote &quot;The New Organic Grower&quot;. He served for two years as Executive Director of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), and was an advisor to the U.S. Department of Agriculture during its 1979–80 study, &quot;Report and Recommendations on Organic Farming&quot;, a document that formed the basis for today&#x27;s legislated National Organic Program (2002) in the U.S.

On his Four Season Farm in Harborside, Brooksville, Maine, on Cape Rosier, he produces year-round vegetable crops, even under harsh winter conditions (for which he uses unheated and minimally heated greenhouses and polytunnels). He even manages to grow artichokes, claiming that &quot;I grow them just to make the Californians nervous.&quot;

Coleman is married to gardening author Barbara Damrosch. For several years, from 1993, they co-hosted the TV series, &quot;Gardening Naturally&quot;, on The Learning Channel. Coleman and his wife continue to grow and locally market fresh produce.

==Career ==
Coleman graduated from Williams College in 1961. In 1968, he and his first wife, Sue Coleman, moved to a farm in Maine, situated on land purchased from Helen and Scott Nearing, as part of the back-to-the-land movement. Their first child, Melissa Coleman, was born there the next year. Coleman taught himself how to farm organically in the harsh Maine climate, and developed many of the cold-weather growing techniques for which he is known. As did the Nearings, the Colemans developed their farm into a learning center for people interested in natural and sustainable agricultural practices.

In 1974, Coleman began periodically visiting farms in Europe to study techniques that might be adapted to the Northeastern United States. He has since made many such investigative tours. The market gardening farms of the Netherlands, France, and Germany have provided much inspiration.

The first edition of Coleman&#x27;s &quot;The New Organic Grower&quot; was published in 1989. In 1995, the winter harvest aspect of his farming entered a new, more comprehensive phase, just as the second edition of the book was coming together. In the decades since, the winter harvest has inspired the creation of &quot;The Winter Harvest Handbook&quot; and has become one of his favorite areas of applied research.

==Organic farming principles==
In his writing, Coleman promotes small-scale organic farming practices and sustainable agriculture. One of his central principles is &quot;small is better,&quot; advocating business growth through improved production and marketing, rather than physical expansion. He also favors direct relationships with customers; the relationships can take many flexible forms, but he considers them more important societally than organic certification itself.

His principles also include favoring the biologic over the technologic, and the preventive over the corrective, when seeking solutions to agricultural challenges. He readily advocates technology wherever appropriate (including inventing new hand tools and agricultural machinery), but he tries to get the resiliency of life itself to prevent problems, in preference to using technology to fix them after they have developed. He thus favors soil health (via crop rotation and soil amendments) and locally optimized timing of sowing and harvest as keys to plant health that render most other pest control and plant disease control efforts unnecessary. He advocates accepting external forces (such as biologic and thermal realities) and using them to one&#x27;s own advantage instead of fighting them with chemicals (as against soil deficiencies, plant diseases, insect pests, and weeds) or with fuel consumption (as against cold weather). It is this principle, as well as the gradual dilution of the connotations of the word &quot;organic&quot;, that leads him to prefer the word &quot;biologic&quot; rather than &quot;organic&quot; as the best description of his methods.

Like many organic farmers, Coleman advocates the prevention-not-treatment approach to weed control. He therefore favors fast, light, frequent cultivation with purpose-built hoe types, skimming weed seedlings off the soil surface with an action that is more like shaving than chopping (hoes &quot;like razors rather than axes&quot;). To that end, he developed the collinear hoe (or collineal hoe).

Coleman is a leader in developing and sharing the concept that in season extension a distinction can be made between extending the &quot;growing&quot; season and extending the &quot;harvest&quot; season.

Coleman has often turned to published agricultural research in seeking ways to continually improve his farming methods. He has pointed out that agricultural science has often shown a bias toward basic research but that applied research is more valuable to organic farmers. For example, although it is nice to investigate advanced chemistry, running trials on which compost recipe is most favored by a particular cultivar of &quot;Brassica&quot;, and a thousand other practical topics, represents important and valuable applied science. He has pointed out that such useful practical research was often done in the United States before 1940 but not as much since then. He has observed that Dutch organic farmers today do a lot of practical innovation and trials and share the information with each other, although much of this useful research never gets formally published. He relied on much self-education, including much library time, to bootstrap his knowledge, and he encourages his readers to do so as well.

The development of the big business phase of the organic food era has led Coleman, as well as others, to emphasize the ways in which small, local growers can have competitive advantages to keep their businesses strong. At one time just being organic was enough, but now something more is needed to compete. He thus points out that food should be local and next-day or same-day fresh, and that it is best for customers to have personal relationships with growers. On these points, large corporations with long-distance distribution cannot easily wipe out small business competition.

Beyond merely the question of who is able to compete on price, Coleman also explores the very difference between shallow organics and deep organics, which reaches all the way into discussion of economic systems and lifestyles. He questions the very ideas of people buying much stuff (including quick fixes to palliate problems, even despite their being organic), buying ultra-processed foods at all (even with the organic label), and using long supply chains full of intermediaries; he feels that such ideas are not a smart path to human health (which requires soil health) and are of questionable economic sustainability in that they promote the view of nature as a collection of problems to be solved with purchased palliatives (driving sales) instead of a positive force to be amplified to advantage and with which to align one&#x27;s efforts. He advocates &quot;real food&quot; (biologic/organic, unprocessed, local, fresh, produced by small businesses).

== Personal life ==
During these years (early to mid-1970s), Coleman experienced hyperthyroidism. He was reluctant to follow medical advice, as he felt convinced that dietary choices should be able to help. Eventually, he took radioiodine therapy.

<doc id="425956" wikidata="Q1471214" url="?curid=425956" title="Lord Emsworth">
<text>Clarence Threepwood, 9th Earl Emsworth, commonly known as Lord Emsworth, is a recurring fictional character in the Blandings Castle series of stories by British comic writer P. G. Wodehouse. He is the amiable and somewhat absent-minded head of the large Threepwood family. Longing for nothing more than to talk to his prize pig, Empress of Blandings, or potter peacefully in the idyllic gardens of Blandings Castle, he must frequently face the unpleasant reality of his domineering sisters and familial duties.

Lord Emsworth&#x27;s first appearance is in the novel &quot;Something Fresh&quot; (1915). The last completed work by Wodehouse in which Emsworth appears is &quot;A Pelican at Blandings&quot; (1969). He is also in Wodehouse&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;Sunset at Blandings&quot;.

==Origins==

Wodehouse frequently named his characters after places with which he was familiar, and Lord Emsworth takes his name from the Hampshire town of Emsworth, where Wodehouse spent some time in the 1900s; he first went there in 1903, at the invitation of his friend Herbert Westbrook, and later took a lease on a house there called &quot;Threepwood Cottage&quot;, which name he used as Lord Emsworth&#x27;s family name. Westbrook worked at a school in the town, and Wodehouse also mentions it in his 1909 novel &quot;Mike&quot;, as the place where Mike was at school prior to Wrykyn. Some of the many characters who are named after places in the vicinity of Emsworth include Lord Emsworth&#x27;s heir, Viscount Bosham, Lady Anne Warblington, Lord Stockheath, the Duchess of Havant (in &quot;A Gentleman of Leisure&quot;), and Lord Arthur Hayling (in &quot;The Prince and Betty&quot;).

The name &quot;Lord Emsworth&quot; first appears in Wodehouse&#x27;s works as a passing mention in a short called &quot;The Matrimonial Sweepstakes&quot;, a version of &quot;The Good Angel&quot; printed in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in the US in February 1910. &quot;The Good Angel&quot; as it appears in the 1914 collection &quot;The Man Upstairs&quot; contains no such mention, although there is a &quot;Lord Stockleigh&quot; involved.

==Life and character==

Lord Emsworth is consistently presented just shy of sixty years old; since Wodehouse wrote about him for over half a century, in novels more or less set in the present, this means that his dates vary depending on what one is reading. As a child, he once took a dead pet rabbit to bed with him; at the age of fifteen, he smoked his first cigar, and he has rarely been called on to think quickly since hearing his father&#x27;s footsteps approaching the stable-loft where he sat that day. Never the brightest of minds, at Eton College, they called him &quot;Fathead&quot;; and, by the time readers meet him, his slowness of thought has become a byword; he is prone to distraction and misunderstanding but is generally amiable. His simple outlook makes him an excellent sleeper; and, for twenty years, he has rarely got less than his eight hours, usually managing ten (he is particularly fond of sleeping at the start of train journeys). In &quot;Something Fresh&quot;, he keeps a revolver by his bed, with which to fire wildly at burglars or Rupert Baxter.

Lord Emsworth has ten sisters (one deceased), two brothers (one deceased), two sons, at least one daughter, and many in-laws. He is a widower; his wife died some years before he is introduced: &quot;he was a man who since the death of his wife some twenty years ago had made something of a life&#x27;s work of avoiding women.&quot; (&quot;Pigs Have Wings&quot;, 1952).

He is a long, thin, bald old man with a tendency towards scruffiness, generally found in a worn old tweed jacket and trousers that bag at the knees. He wears pince-nez on a string around his neck, which he nevertheless often loses. He resents being forced to dress up smartly, especially when he is also called on to address crowds and most of all loathes having to visit London when the sun is shining. In &quot;Lord Emsworth Acts for the Best&quot;, he grows a rather ragged beard, little realising the peril this puts his castle in, and he soon realises it is better to remove it.

In his later years, the main troubles of his life stem from his many sisters, particularly the formidable Connie, who despair at his eccentric appearance and distracted ways, and his younger son Freddie, whom he longs to see safely married off and out of trouble; his joy at seeing him finally paired off with Aggie Donaldson knows no bounds. The frequent visits (in later works) of his disreputable brother Gally add further to life&#x27;s complications and his sister Connie&#x27;s frustrations.

In &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot;, a short story in Wodehouse&#x27;s Jeeves series, it&#x27;s revealed that Lord Emsworth in his youth went about with young men who behaved &quot;in a manner that would not have been tolerated in the fo&#x27;castle of a whaler&quot; according to Lady Florence Craye.

===List of relatives===
Clarence Threepwood, Lord Emsworth, has a large family. One possible sister, Lady Florence Moresby, appears only in the unfinished novel &quot;Sunset at Blandings&quot;. According to the book &quot;Wodehouse at Blandings Castle&quot; by Tony Ring and Geoffrey Jaggard, Lord Emsworth has a daughter named Lady Lilian Baldicott in &quot;The Cabaret Girl&quot;, though no such character is mentioned in the Blandings stories. Since these two characters are not confirmed to exist in completed Blandings stories, they are listed with asterisks below. Additionally, Lord Bosham (pronounced &quot;Bozzam&quot;) is variously described as having two sons or three sons.

Note that some marriages occur during the Blandings series of stories, and the spouses of Lord Emsworth&#x27;s nieces and nephews are not included in this list. Also note that Lord Emsworth and his siblings are children of the previous Earl of Emsworth and thus have titles in accordance with forms of address for earls and their children in the UK. Some characters, such as Lady Alcester, acquired a title through marriage.

The family and relatives of Lord Emsworth (described by their connection to Lord Emsworth) include:

==Activities==

He shuns his administrative duties and generally has a secretary to handle such things; amongst the occupants of this post have been the likes of Hugo Carmody, Monty Bodkin and Psmith, although by far the best known, and least appreciated by his Lordship, is Rupert Baxter, the bespectacled efficiency expert, who made Emsworth&#x27;s life a misery with his ruthless organisation of his master&#x27;s precious time.

Emsworth&#x27;s favourite pastimes are his pig and his garden, and he spends many a happy hour pottering about it, arguing with his gardeners, especially Angus McAllister, whose desire to gravel the famous Yew Alley is particularly upsetting to his Lordship, and with his pig-keepers, who include Wellbeloved, Pirbright, and the Amazonian Monica Simmons.

He won first prize for roses at the Shrewsbury Flower Show in the same year Psmith&#x27;s father won the tulip prize, and he is invariably amongst the competitors in Shropshire&#x27;s Agriculture Show. He has some success in the field of large pumpkins, taking first prize in the competition with his &quot;Blandings Hope&quot; (cruelly nicknamed &quot;Percy&quot; by his son Freddie). He later enters his prize sow, the Empress of Blandings, who wins the coveted Fat Pigs contest several years in a row. The Empress&#x27;s primary competitor is the Pride of Matchingham, who belongs to Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe, Emsworth&#x27;s neighbour and rival. Once the pig fever has taken him, he is mostly to be found draped bonelessly over the pig pen, looking like an old sock.

In less salubrious weather, he likes to mess around in his museum or sit comfortably in the library, reading some informative tome of agricultural lore; his favourite being Whiffle on &quot;The Care of the Pig&quot;. A well-preserved fellow, he has a swim in the lake every morning he can and has a fondness for amateur medicine, never happier than when trying out some new unction.

<doc id="425971" wikidata="Q668527" url="?curid=425971" title="Pademelon">
<text>Pademelons are small marsupials in the genus Thylogale, found in Australia and Aru, Kai plus New Guinea islands. They are some of the smallest members of the macropod family, which includes the similar-looking but larger kangaroos and wallabies. Pademelons are distinguished by their small size and their short, thick, and sparsely-haired tails. Like other marsupials, they carry their young in a pouch.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pademelon&quot; comes from the word &quot;badimaliyan&quot; in Dharug, an Australian Aboriginal language spoken near what is now Port Jackson, New South Wales. The scientific name &quot;Thylogale&quot; uses the Greek words for &quot;pouch&quot; and &quot;weasel.&quot;

==Description==
Along with the rock-wallabies and the hare-wallabies, the pademelons are among the smallest members of the macropod family. Mature male pademelons are larger than females, with an average weight of about 7 kg and height of 60 cm. Mature females weigh around 3.8 kg.

==Species==
There are seven recognised species within genus &quot;Thylogale&quot;:

==Distribution and habitat==
The red-legged pademelon can be found in the coastal regions of Queensland and New South Wales, and in south-central New Guinea. In some areas, its range has been drastically reduced.

The red-bellied or Tasmanian pademelon is abundant in Tasmania, although it was once found throughout the southeastern parts of mainland Australia.

The dusky pademelon lives in New Guinea and surrounding islands. It was previously called the Aru Islands wallaby. Before that, it was called the &quot;philander&quot; (&quot;friend of man&quot;), which is the name it bears in the second volume of Cornelis de Bruijn&#x27;s &quot;Travels&quot;, originally published in 1711. The Latin name of this species is called after De Bruijn.

The natural habitat of the pademelon is in thick scrubland or dense forested undergrowth. It also makes tunnels through long grasses and bushes in swampy country.

==Threats==
Pademelon meat used to be considered valuable and was eaten by settlers and indigenous Australians.

Aside from being killed for their meat and soft fur, their numbers have been reduced by the introduction of non-native predators such as cats in Australia, dogs, and red foxes. The rapid increase in Australia&#x27;s rabbit population has also caused problems as rabbits graze on the same grasses, making less available for the pademelons. Clearing of land for urbanisation has pushed the larger wallabies and kangaroos onto land that previously was occupied by pademelons with little competition.

Tasmanian pademelons were an important part of the diet of the now-extinct thylacine, and they are still preyed on by quolls, Tasmanian devils, and wedge-tailed eagles. Despite these predators, Tasmania and its outlying smaller islands have large numbers of pademelons and every year many are culled to keep their numbers sustainable.

<doc id="425978" wikidata="Q767429" url="?curid=425978" title="Commodore Datasette">
<text>The Commodore 1530 (C2N) Datasette, later also Datassette (a portmanteau of &quot;data&quot; and &quot;cassette&quot;), is Commodore&#x27;s dedicated magnetic-tape data storage device. Using compact cassettes as the storage medium, it provides inexpensive storage to Commodore&#x27;s 8-bit computers, including the PET, VIC-20, and Commodore 64. A physically similar model, Commodore 1531, was made for the Commodore 16 and Plus/4 series computers.

== Features ==
The Datasette is probably the most sophisticated tape-storage method of any microcomputer. Typical compact cassette interfaces of the late 1970s use a small controller in the computer to convert digital data to and from analog audio tones. The interface connects to the cassette deck using normal audio cables like RCA jacks or 3.5mm phone jacks. Such a system is compatible with the Apple II and TRS-80 Color Computer, as well as many S-100 bus systems, and allows them to be used with any cassette player with suitable connections, but using analog tones—similar to how dial-up modems work—often results in read errors instead of successful loading of data.

In the Datasette, instead of writing two tones to tape to indicate bits, patterns of square waves are used, including a parity bit. Programs are written twice to tape for error correction; if an error is detected when reading the first recording, the computer corrects it with data from the second. The Datasette has built-in analog-to-digital converters and audio filters to convert the computer&#x27;s digital data into analog audio and vice versa. Connection to the computer is done via a proprietary edge connector (Commodore 1530) or mini-DIN connector (1531). The absence of recordable audio signals on this interface makes the Datasette and clones the only cassette recorders usable with Commodore computers, until aftermarket converters made the use of ordinary recorders possible.

Because of its digital format the Datasette is both more reliable than other data cassette systems and very slow, transferring data at around per second. After the Datasette&#x27;s launch, however, special &quot;turbo tape&quot; software appeared, providing much faster loading and saving. Such software was integrated into most commercial prerecorded applications (mostly games), as well as being available separately for loading and saving the users&#x27; homemade programs and data. These programs were only widely used in Europe, as the US market had long since moved onto disks.

Datasettes can typically store about per side. The use of &quot;turbo tape&quot; and other fast loaders increased this number to roughly .

The Datasette has only one connection cable, with a –spacing PCB edge connector at the computer end. All input/output signals to the Datasette are all digital, and so all digital-to-analog conversion, and vice versa, is handled within the unit. Power is also included in this cable. The pinout is ground, , motor, read, write, key-sense. The sense signal monitors the play, rewind, and fast-forward buttons but cannot differentiate between them. A mechanical interlock prevents any two of them from being pressed at the same time. The motor power is derived from the computer&#x27;s unregulated supply via a transistor circuit.

== Encoding ==


To record physical data, the zero-crossing from positive to negative voltage of the analog signal is measured. The resulting time between these positive to negative crossings is then compared to a threshold to determine whether the time since the last crossing is short (0) or long (1). Note the lower amplitude for the shorter periods.

A circuit in the tape unit transforms the analog signal into a logical 1 or 0, which is then transmitted to the computer via the tape connector. Inside the computer, the first Complex Interface Adapter (6526) in the C64 senses when the signal goes from one to zero. This event is called trigger and causes an interrupt request. This event can be handled by a handler code, or simply discovered by testing bit 4 of location $DC0D. The points that trigger this event are indicated by the black circles in the figure.

Inside the tape device the read head signal is fed into an operational amplifier (1) whose output signal is DC-filtered. Op-amp (2) amplifies and feeds an RC filter. Op-amp (3) amplifies the signal again followed by another DC filter. Op-amp (4) amplifies the signal into clipping the sine-formed signal. The positive and negative rails for all op-amps are wired to +5V DC and GND. The clipped signal therefore fits into the TTL electrical level window of the Schmitt trigger step that in turn feeds the digital cassette port.

On the PAL version of the C64, the time granularity is (for NTSC ). Since each bit uses this means = or a data rate.

Once the bits can be decoded, they are fed into a shift register and are continuously compared to a special bit sequence. This bit sequence can also be seen as a byte. A bit-sequence match means that the stream is byte-synchronized. The first byte to compare with is called the &quot;lead-in byte&quot;. If matched, it&#x27;s compared to the &quot;sync byte&quot; as well.

An example: Turbo Tape 64 has a &quot;lead-in byte&quot; $02 (binary 00000010), &quot;sync byte&quot; $09 (binary 00001001) and a following sync sequence of $08, $07, $06, $05, $04, $03, $02, $01.

== Models ==

=== PET, VIC-20, C64/128 ===

There are at least four main models of the 1530/C2N Datassette:

* The original modified Sanyo M1540A cassette drive, built into the earliest models of PET in 1977. This was a standard shoebox tape recorder with a corner of the case removed and modified electronics; a Commodore PCB was installed internally in place of the Sanyo electronics. To disguise the Sanyo brand, Commodore simply fitted a Commodore badge over the original logo.
* The second built-in Datassette in the PET 2001: another standard consumer model (sold in some markets as CCE CCT1020) modified with a Commodore PCB. Black cassette lid, five white keys, no tape counter, no SAVE LED
* Black body original-shape model, black cassette lid, five black keys, no tape counter, no SAVE LED
* White body original-shape model, black cassette lid, five black keys, with tape counter, no SAVE LED
* White body new-shape model, silver cassette lid, six black keys, with white tape counter SAVE LED on left side
* White body new-shape model, silver cassette lid, six black keys, with tape counter and a red SAVE LED on the right
* As above but with black pattern and silvery Commodore logo, six black keys, tape counter and a red SAVE LED on right side

The first two external models were made as PET peripherals, and styled after the PET 2001 built-in tape drive. The latter two were styled and marketed for the VIC-20 and C64. All 1530s are compatible with all those computers, as well as the C128.

In addition to this, some models came with a small hole above the keys, to allow access to the adjustment screw of the tape head azimuth position. A small screwdriver can thus easily be used to affect the adjustment without disassembling the Datassette&#x27;s chassis.

Confusingly, the Datassette at various times was sold both as the &quot;C2N DATASETTE UNIT Model 1530&quot; and as the &quot;1530 DATASSETTE UNIT Model C2N&quot;. Note the difference in spelling (one &quot;S&quot; versus two) used on the original product packaging.

Like Datasette models, the recording format is compatible across computers; the VIC, for example, can read PET cassettes.

=== C16/116 and Plus/4 ===

Similar in physical appearance to the 1530/C2N models is the Commodore 1531, made for the Commodore 16 and Plus/4 series computers. This has a Mini-DIN connector in place of the PCB edge connector. This can be used with a C64/128 via an adaptor, which was supplied by Commodore with some units.

*Black/charcoal body new shape model, silver cassette lid, six light gray keys, with tape counter and a red SAVE LED

== Popularity ==
The Datasette was more popular outside than inside the United States. U.S. Gold, which imported American computer games to Britain, often had to wait until they were converted from disk because most British Commodore 64 owners used tape, while the US magazine &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; reported that by 1983 &quot;90 percent of new Commodore 64 owners bought a disk drive with their computer&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported in 1986 that British cassette-based software had failed in the United States because &quot;97% of the Commodore systems in the USA have disk drives&quot;; by contrast, MicroProse reported in 1987 that 80% of its 100,000 sales of &quot;Gunship&quot; in the UK were on cassette. In the United States disk drives quickly became standard, despite the 1541 costing roughly five times as much as a Datasette. In most parts of Europe, the Datasette was the medium of choice for several years after its launch, although floppy disk drives were generally available. The inexpensive and widely available audio cassettes made the Datasette a good choice for the budget-aware home computer mass market.

<doc id="425980" wikidata="Q1367287" url="?curid=425980" title="Ivane Javakhishvili">
<text>Ivane Alexandres dze Javakhishvili ( 23 April 1876 – 18 November 1940) was a Georgian historian and linguist whose works heavily influenced the modern scholarship of the history and culture of Georgia. He was one of the founding fathers of the Tbilisi State University (1918) and its rector from 1919 to 1926.

==Biography==

Ivane Javakhishvili was born in Tbilisi, Georgia (then part of Imperial Russia) to the aristocratic family of Prince Alexander Javakhishvili, who served as an educator at the Tbilisi Gymnasium. Having graduated from the Faculty of Oriental Studies of the St. Petersburg University in 1899, he became a &quot;privat-docent&quot; of the Chair of Armenian and Georgian Philology at his alma mater. From 1901 to 1902, he was a visiting scholar at the University of Berlin. In 1902, he accompanied his mentor, Academician Nikolai Marr, to Mount Sinai where they studied medieval Georgian manuscripts (such as the Georgian manuscripts of Saint Paul&#x27;s letters). After the first volumes of Javakhishvili&#x27;s monumental, but yet unfinished, &quot;kartveli eris istoria&quot; (A History of the Georgian Nation) appeared between 1908 and 1914, the young scholar quickly established himself as a preeminent authority on Georgian and Caucasian history, Georgian law, paleography, diplomacy, music, drama and other subjects, producing landmark studies in these fields. 

Early in 1918, he was instrumental in founding Georgia&#x27;s first regular university in Tbilisi, thus realizing a long-time dream cherished by generations of Georgian intellectuals but consistently frustrated by the Imperial Russian authorities. The Tbilisi University (present-day I. Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University, TSU, of his namesake), of which Javakhishvili became a professor and the head of the Department of the History of Georgia, rapidly assumed a dominant position in Georgia&#x27;s educational life. 

After a major role in founding Tbilisi State University Javakhishvili offered the role of its head to Petre Melikishvili. After Petre Melikishvili resigned in 1919, Javakhishvili became the second Rector of the University. He served until June 1926, when, in the aftermath of anti-Soviet August Uprising of 1924, tolerance of non-Marxist intellectuals began to contract. In 1936, the repression against Javakhishvili escalated, as TSU Rector K. Oragvelidze delivered a thesis at the Faculty of History that criticized his scientific work. Under the threat of Soviet oppression, the majority of Javakhishvili&#x27;s associates and students failed to show their support.

Although he was permitted to publish and teach, this eclipse probably saved his life, since his successor at the university, was among the victims of the Great Purge of 1936–7. He was forced to step down at TSU in 1938, but was soon appointed director of the Department of History at the State Museum of Georgia, which he headed until his death in Tbilisi in 1940. He was interred at the yard of the TSU.

==Legacy and works==

Javakhishvili authored more than 170 works dealing with various aspects of Georgia&#x27;s political, cultural, social and economic history. Since the publication of its first edition in 1908, his main work, &quot;A History of the Georgian Nation&quot; (fully published between 1908 and 1949), has remained one of the most comprehensive and eloquent treatments of pre-modern Georgian history. Several of Javakhishvili&#x27;s most influential articles and books including &quot;A History of the Georgian Nation&quot; have been reprinted in his twelve-volume collected works from 1977 and 1998.

<doc id="425983" wikidata="Q6541422" url="?curid=425983" title="Libertarian perspectives on foreign intervention">
<text>Libertarian perspectives on foreign intervention started as a reaction to the Cold War mentality of military interventionism promoted by American conservatives, including William F. Buckley Jr., who supplanted Old Right non-interventionism. 

The Vietnam War split the uneasy alliance between growing numbers of self-identified libertarians and the Cold War conservatives. Libertarians opposed to the war joined the draft resistance and peace movements and created organizations such as Students for a Democratic Society. The split was aggravated at the 1969 Young Americans for Freedom convention where the burning of a draft card sparked physical confrontations among convention attendees, a walkout by many libertarians, and the creation of antiwar libertarian organizations. 

Left-libertarians generally oppose foreign military intervention on anti-imperialist grounds, while right-libertarians also generally oppose foreign military intervention and generally oppose all government foreign aid as well. In the United States, the Libertarian Party opposes strategic alliances between the United States and foreign nations.

== Overview ==
Anti-war and non-interventionist American libertarians were highly influenced by economist Murray Rothbard and author Karl Hess. Rothbard criticized imperialism and the rise of the American empire which needed war to sustain itself and to expand its global control. Rothbard said: &quot;Our entry into World War II was the crucial act in foisting a permanent militarization upon the economy and society, in bringing to the country a permanent garrison state, an overweening military–industrial complex, a permanent system of conscription&quot;. This tradition is continued in the anti-war analysis of the Cato Institute&#x27;s David Boaz and former Representative Ron Paul.

Some libertarians have criticized conservatives and those libertarian conservatives who supported the United States&#x27; 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupations. However, others like Randy Barnett and John Hospers supported the Iraq War. In 2010, the Libertarian Party criticized conservatives for supporting a &quot;trillion-dollar foreign war&quot;.

Some libertarians also criticize from a libertarian perspective the actions of foreign governments like Saudi Arabia and Israel. In &quot;War Guilt in the Middle East&quot;, Rothbard details Israel&#x27;s &quot;aggression against Middle East Arabs&quot;, confiscatory policies and its &quot;refusal to let these refugees return and reclaim the property taken from them&quot;. Rothbard also criticized the &quot;organized Anti-Anti-Semitism&quot; that critics of the state of Israel have to suffer. In &quot;Property Rights and the &#x27;Right of Return&#x27;&quot;, professor Richard Ebeling writes: &quot;If a settlement is reached between the Israelis and the Palestinians, justice would suggest that all legitimate property should be returned to its rightful owners and that residence by those owners on their property should be once again permitted&quot;. In &quot;The Alienation of a Homeland: How Palestine Became Israel&quot;, attorney Stephen P. Halbrook writes: &quot;Palestinian Arabs have the rights to return to their homes and estates taken over by Israelis, to receive just compensation for loss of life and property, and to exercise national self-determination&quot;.

Even though the writers behind Ayn Rand Institute and Ayn Rand Lexicon define themselves as Objectivists and are more often opposed to libertarians, large minorities of right-libertarians, mainly in the United states, use aspects of Ayn Rand&#x27;s Objectivism to justify their foreign policy beliefs on the right of defense. A very common view on dictatorship among these is the view that a dictatorial society is an outlaw that can claim no rights and that any free society has a right to forcibly change any dictatorial society into another free one, but should absolutely not assume this to be any kind of self-sacrificial duty. When it comes to broader American foreign policy, these libertarians believe that the crux of American foreign policy should be free trade, including abolition of protectionism as a corporatist element. Many libertarians will argue from perspectives most associated with Ayn Rand Institute to justify siding with Israel over the Arab League, regarding the war that the Arab League launched against Israel in 1948. Some libertarians will use Objectivist arguments to criticize the tendency of many of their own to focus on trivial crimes by free societies instead of severe crimes by tyrannical societies.

Pew Research Center found overwhelmingly in 2011, with new and updated data in 2014, that libertarians in the United States are about as close to evenly split as normal Americans on foreign policy. In 2014, they found through polling that 54% of libertarians oppose American involvement overseas and that 43% are in favor of it. The finding unique to the 2014 polling is that libertarian opinion on whether American involvement overseas does more harm than good is almost evenly split as 47% say no while 46% say yes. Regarding foreign policy views since 2011, libertarians side more with multilateralism over unilateralism, more with realism over idealism, more with opposing the end of Gaddafi over supporting it, more with supporting quick end to the Afghan War over opposing quick end, more with friendliness to China over hostility, are evenly split over trade deals, side more with opposing the United Nations over supporting them and more with seeing Islam as Earth&#x27;s most tyrannical organized religion over seeing some other religion as such. It has also been found in both years&#x27; reports that nearly all libertarians oppose privacy compromises like the Patriot Act. Distinguishing military policy from foreign policy, one will find that libertarian views on foreign policy are almost evenly divided between those who are more often diplomatic and those who are more often militant. A nearly half minority (48%) believe that the best way for American military to ensure peace on earth is to stay the strongest military of Earth, and an identically sized minority also think that the best way to defeat a terroristic ideology is to overwhelmingly and militarily crush that ideology on its soil.

<doc id="425985" wikidata="Q7713404" url="?curid=425985" title="The Ambiguously Gay Duo">
<text>The Ambiguously Gay Duo is an American animated comedy sketch that debuted on &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot; before moving to its permanent home on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. It is created and produced by Robert Smigel and J. J. Sedelmaier as part of the &quot;Saturday TV Funhouse&quot; series of sketches. It follows the adventures of Ace and Gary, voiced by Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell, respectively, two superheroes whose sexual orientation is a matter of dispute, and a cavalcade of characters preoccupied with the question.

==Plot==
&quot;The Ambiguously Gay Duo&quot; is a parody of the stereotypical comic book superhero duo done in the style of Saturday-morning cartoons like &quot;Super Friends&quot;. The characters are clad in matching pastel turquoise tights, dark blue domino masks, and bright yellow coordinated gauntlets, boots, and trunks.

The typical episode usually begins with the duo&#x27;s arch-nemesis Bighead, a criminal mastermind with an abnormally large cranium. Bighead is usually briefing his henchmen on a plot for some grandiose plan for world domination, interrupted by a debate as to whether Ace and Gary (The Ambiguously Gay Duo) are gay. Once the crime is in process, the police commissioner calls on the superheroes to save the day, often engaging in similar debates with the chief of police.
Ace and Gary set out to foil the evil plan, but not before calling attention to themselves with outrageous antics and innuendo, and behaving in ways perceived by other characters to be stereotypically homosexual, as in this conversation from the first episode:
Ace [patting Gary on the buttocks]: Good job, friend-of-friends!&lt;br&gt;
Villains/Bystanders [gasps, and ghastly stares]&lt;br&gt;
Ace: What&#x27;s everybody looking at?&lt;br&gt;
Villains/Bystanders in unison: NOTHING!&lt;br&gt;
Similar gags appear in almost every episode. Episodes not following this general formula have featured Ace and Gary answering fan mail or offering child safety tips. One such episode entails Ace and Gary giving children a ride home in their Duocar and offering home decorating tips, all while blithely making various suggestive gestures and comments.

==Background==

===Conception===

Smigel was an executive producer for &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot; in 1996. They wanted to do cartoons on the show, to differentiate themselves from &quot;SNL&quot;. Writer Dino Stamatopoulos pitched Smigel a parody of &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot;, where it was implied that the dog was giving oral sex to the human. Smigel thought the premise would be &quot;unacceptable&quot; to air on ABC. After the conversation Smigel came up with the idea of using superheroes instead. &quot;Anyway, for some reason, the AGD idea just came to me at the end of that conversation. What if we did two superheroes and everyone suspects they&#x27;re gay? It was always more about the people obsessed with their sexuality than the heroes themselves.&quot; Smigel recalled.

The shorts were intended to satirize suggestions that early Batman comics implied a homosexual relationship between the eponymous title character and his field partner and protégé Robin, a charge most infamously leveled by Fredric Wertham in his 1954 book, &quot;Seduction of the Innocent,&quot; the research methodology for which was later discredited.

In June 2020, Robert Smigel told &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; that the engine of the show was an &quot;obsession with sexuality&quot; and that he thought that it was funny because the homophobes and everyone are obsessed with finding out whether the superheroes are gay or not, calling it &quot;sport and titillation.&quot; He added that the point of the cartoon was that it doesn&#x27;t matter whether the superheroes have sex or not and said that since there has been &quot;an incredible amount of progress&quot; since the series premiered, he would not write the cartoon today.

==Characters==
===The Ambiguously Gay Duo===
* Ace (voiced by Stephen Colbert) – Ace is the leader of the duo. He is mentor to Gary, whom he refers to as &quot;friend of friends.&quot; He has a wide array of superhuman powers, including most (if not all) of Gary&#x27;s powers.
* Gary (voiced by Steve Carell) – Gary is Ace&#x27;s &quot;sidekick&quot; and protégé, and the younger of the duo. Gary is less experienced, and has fewer superhuman powers than Ace. His powers include superhuman strength, breath, stamina, flexibility, flight (though Ace and Gary use the phallic-shaped Duocar more often than they fly), and &quot;laser vision.&quot;

===Supporting characters===
* Announcer (voiced by Bill Chott) – The Announcer is a disembodied voice who announces the title of each episode.
* The Police Commissioner (voiced by Steve Carell) – The Police Commissioner is the duo&#x27;s primary contact, and when trouble arises, he makes the call to their hangout. His calls tend to interrupt a workout of some kind, with one or the other of the duo shirtless.
* The Chief of Police (voiced by Bill Chott) – The Chief of Police is seen with the commissioner, apparently waiting to find evidence in support of his belief that Ace and Gary are gay.
* Kijoro – Kijoro is the duo&#x27;s mentor whose spirit resides in the &quot;Fortress of Privacy&quot; and offers advice from time to time when Ace and Gary seek counsel.
* Piño – The butler of Ace and Gary.

===Villains===
* Bighead (voiced by Robert Smigel) – Bighead is a mad scientist with a very large, bald head, and is usually the brains behind most of the evil schemes. Second only to his primary vocation of mad scientist is his obsession with outing the superheroes as gay, which tends to annoy his co-conspirators because they do not care about the duo&#x27;s sexuality and only want to defeat them in order to rule the world. He is constantly criticized for the amount of energy he invests in this pursuit.
** Bighead Henchmen (voiced by Robert Smigel) - The unnamed henchmen of Bighead who wear blue outfits.
* Dr. Brainio (voiced by Stephen Colbert) – Dr. Brainio is another mad scientist with a brain suspended above his head and attached by a trio of cables and tubing that go into his head. He occasionally partners with Bighead, but is quite a bit more undecided about Ace and Gary.
* Orbitrox – Orbitrox is a small, green, free-floating droid who sides with Bighead on the question of Ace&#x27;s and Gary&#x27;s sexual orientation. His sounds are translated by subtitles. Orbitrox has proffered evidence of them having visited gay bars, but he emphatically denies visiting them himself while snapping in subtitled form &quot;Back off, dickweed, it&#x27;s research!&quot;
* Beetles of Zolaro (voiced by Robert Smigel) – A race of alien beetles from the planet Zolaro.
* Queen Serena (voiced by Ana Gasteyer) – An intergalactic queen from the planetoid Garassas that is an ally of Bighead.
* Flame Eye (voiced by Bill Hader) – An ally of Bighead and Dr. Brainio with a fiery right eye that can shoot fire from it.
* Lizardo (voiced by Robert Smigel) – A lizard man ally of Bighead and Dr. Brainio.
* Half-Scary (voiced by Robert Smigel) – A Two-Face-like ally of Bighead and Dr. Brainio.
* Flatside (voiced by Bill Hader impersonating Edward G. Robinson) – An ally of Bighead and Dr. Brainio whose head is flat on one side.

==Episodes==
The first episode debuted on &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot;, and was re-aired on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in September 1996. Subsequent episodes debuted on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

===Other appearances===
On January 12, 2002: (Josh Hartnett/Pink), The Ambiguously Gay Duo makes a surprise appearance in &quot;The X-Presidents&quot; episode &quot;The Hunt for Osama.&quot; The Ambiguously Gay Duo show up in their Duocar where they help the X-Presidents capture Osama bin Laden. The skit was written by Smigel, McKay, and Louis C.K.. On April 29, 2006: The Ambiguously Gay Duo co-hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live: The Best of TV Funhouse&quot;. The hosting duties included the opening monologue performed by Ace and Gary, plus new animated/live-action material during the pre-commercial and post-commercial bumpers. It was revealed during these bumper segments that they seem to have an undying obsession with former cast member Jimmy Fallon. The show ended with the duo taking cast members Jason Sudeikis and Andy Samberg to their secret headquarters — both naked — in the Duocar, with announcer Don Pardo begging to be taken with them and a spurned Jimmy Fallon looking on from his apartment window with tears in his eyes. Colbert was not present during the taping of this episode, as he was hosting the 2006 White House Correspondents&#x27; Association Dinner that same night.

In May 2011, a live-action skit based on the series appeared in a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episode, with Jon Hamm playing Ace and Jimmy Fallon playing Gary. Daniel Villarreal criticized the skit as biphobic and questioned whether two non-gay actors portraying the parts was progressive or problematic.

In 2015, Bif Bang Pow Toys produced and released a new 8&quot; retro action-figure line of Ace and Gary titled the Ambiguously Gay Duo 8&quot; retro action figure series. They were both individually packaged on a card but sold together in a set at the Entertainment Earth Catalog and website and at other toy and comic book stores as well. That same year, Bif Bang Pow Toys produced the Ambiguously Gay Duo Tin Tote (Lunchbox) action figure set of three 5&quot; action-figures of Ace, Gary, and Bighead.

==Film adaptation==
The original idea for a live-action movie first came up in 2000 when someone pitched the idea to Smigel, he initially balked. &quot;But then I thought, &#x27;What about a live-action one with Alec Baldwin and Jimmy Fallon?&#x27;&quot; Smigel recalled. Lorne Michaels loved the idea, but ownership disputes between Universal, who still held rights from the &quot;Dana Carvey Show&quot; days, and Paramount, who produced SNL films, kept the project from being made. The idea was shelved until years later, when Carell told his &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; co-star, Jim Carrey about it. In 2005, Universal commissioned a script and Smigel brought Colbert over to write it, once finished they pitched it to Carrey, but it never made it into production. Some of the jokes were included in the 2011 live-action episode. Smigel recalled that one of Colbert&#x27;s ideas for the script was an opening sequence that featured a naked muscular male chest, with the credits appearing on it formed by water and soap.

==Reception==
Matt Goldberg of Collider said that the series was a &quot;one-note joke&quot; but that it worked well as a &quot;great parody of superhero cartoon shows.&quot;

Adam Polaski of The Good Men Project praised the animation and the live-action sketch in 2011 as a satire that spoofs &quot;the inherently homoerotic nature of superheroes... [and the] stereotype that gay men are obsessed with sex.&quot;

Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk, while calling the cartoons &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;formulaic&quot;, praised the voice work from Colbert and Carell, along with how the series served as a &quot;visual parody of old cartoons&quot;, especially the homoerotic theories about Batman and Robin.

&quot;TVLine&quot; writers said in 2018 that if the crime fighters had reappeared that year, viewers might have found out whether the two protagonists had changed, whether they&#x27;d be &quot;out and proud, rebranded as the Unambiguously Gay Duo&quot;, and whether they&#x27;d fight to mend &quot;the social divisions in our country.&quot;

<text>The Korean War Veterans Memorial is located in Washington, D.C.&#x27;s West Potomac Park, southeast of the Lincoln Memorial and just south of the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall. It memorializes those who served in the Korean War (1950–1953). The national memorial was dedicated in 1995. It includes 19 statues representing U.S. military personnel in action. In 2022, the memorial was expanded to include a granite memorial wall, engraved with the names of U.S. military personnel (and South Koreans embedded in U.S. military units) who died in the war.

==History==
The Korean War Veterans Memorial was confirmed by the U.S. Congress (Public Law 99-572) on April 20, 1986, with design and construction managed by the Korean War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board and the American Battle Monuments Commission.

The initial design competition was won in 1986 by a team of four architects and landscape architects from The Pennsylvania State University, but this team withdrew as it became clear that changes would be needed to satisfy the advisory board and reviewing agencies such as the Commission of Fine Arts. A federal court case was filed and lost by the winning design team over the design changes. The eventual design was by Cooper-Lecky Architects who oversaw collaboration between several designers.

President George H. W. Bush conducted the groundbreaking for the Memorial on June 14, 1992, Flag Day, and thus construction was started. The companies and organizations involved in the construction are listed on the memorial as: the Faith Construction Company, the Emma Kollie Company, the Cold Spring Granite Company, the Tallix Art Foundry and the Baltimore District of the US Army Corps of Engineers. The memorial was dedicated on July 27, 1995, the 42nd anniversary of the armistice that ended the war, by President Bill Clinton and Kim Young Sam, the South Korean president, to the men and women who served during the conflict. Management of the national memorial was turned over to the National Park Service (NPS), under its National Mall and Memorial Parks group. As with all National Park Service historic areas, the memorial was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on the day of its dedication.

==Design and construction==
=== The Mural Wall ===
The main memorial is in the form of a triangle intersecting a circle. Walls: long, thick; more than 100 tons of highly polished &quot;Academy Black&quot; granite from California: more than 2,500 photographic, archival images representing the land, sea, and air troops who supported those who fought in the war are sandblasted onto the wall. The Mural was created by Louis Nelson, with photographic images sandblasted into it depicting soldiers, equipment and people involved in the war.
When reflected on the wall, there appear to be 38 soldiers, 38 months, and it is also representing the 38th parallel that separated the North and South Korea.

=== &quot;The Column&quot; ===

Within the walled triangle are 19 stainless steel statues designed by Frank Gaylord and collectively called &quot;The Column&quot;. Each statue is larger than life-size, between and tall; each weighs nearly . The figures represent a platoon on patrol, drawn from branches of the armed forces; fourteen of the figures are from the U.S. Army, three are from the Marine Corps, one is a Navy Corpsman, and one is an Air Force Forward Air Observer. They are dressed in full combat gear, dispersed among strips of granite and juniper bushes which represent the rugged terrain of Korea.

=== United Nations Wall ===
To the north of the statues and path is the United Nations Wall, a low wall listing the 22 member states of the United Nations (including the U.S. and South Korea) that, as part of the United Nations Command, contributed troops or provided medical support.

=== Pool of Remembrance ===
The circle contains the Pool of Remembrance, a shallow pool in diameter lined with black granite and surrounded by a grove of linden trees with benches. The trees are shaped to create a barrel effect, which allows sunlight to reflect on the pool. Inscriptions list the numbers killed, wounded, missing in action, and held as prisoners of war, and a nearby plaque is inscribed: &quot;Our nation honors her sons and daughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met.&quot; Additionally, right next to the numbers of American soldiers are those of the United Nations troops in the same categories. In the south side of the memorial, there are three bushes of the Rose of Sharon hibiscus plant, South Korea&#x27;s national flower.

A further granite wall bears the simple message, inlaid in silver: &quot;Freedom Is Not Free.&quot;

=== Wall of Remembrance ===
Around 2010, the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation (KWVMF) began to lobby Congress to add to the existing memorial a wall listing the names of U.S. servicemembers who died in the Korean War. The NPS opposed the proposal; the director of the NPS capital region testified before a House committee that &quot;As the Vietnam Veterans Memorial experience showed, there is not always agreement on those names to be included and those names that are not, and this has led to public contention and controversy, ... Choosing some names and omitting others causes a place of solace to become a source of hurt.&quot; In 2016 Congress passed the Korean War Veterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance Act; the act requires the NPS to work with the KWVMF to add a &quot;list of names of members of the Armed Forces of the United States who died in the Korean War, as determined by the Secretary of Defense.&quot;

In 2021, portions of the memorial were closed for construction of the Wall of Remembrance and simultaneous rehabilitation work on the rest of the memorial. In summer 2022, the Wall of Remembrance, a series of long black granite slabs, was unveiled at a re-dedication ceremony. The ceremony took place on July 27, 2022, the 69th anniversary of the Armistice.

The wall lists the names of 36,634 Americans, along with 7,174 South Koreans who died under U.S. command while serving in the Korean Augmentation To the United States Army (KATUSA). The Wall cost $22 million to design and construct, funded mostly by the South Korean government, Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs. Names of those killed are listed in order of branch and rank. Due to errors in the list submitted by the Defense Department in 2021, the Wall of Remembrance contains many mistakes: it is estimated to include 1,015 spelling errors (for example, the name of posthumous Medal of Honor recipient John Kelvin Koelsch is misspelled) and also lists 245 servicemembers who died in circumstances unrelated to the Korean War. The Wall also omits about 500 names that should be listed. For example, one bomber crash killed nine crew members aboard, but only three names are included on the wall. In another case, a Navy pilot and an Air Force pilot were killed off Japan after their aircraft collided with each other; only one of the two pilots is listed on the wall.

On 11 January 2023, South Korean Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs announced their intent to perform list verifications and corrections in the near future.

== Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation&#x27;s Maintenance Fund ==
On October 12, 2015, Samsung Electronics donated $1 million to the Korean War Memorial Foundation. The memorial used the donation for maintenance. According to William Weber, the chairman of the memorial foundation, &quot;Most of the grouting need to be treated twice a year. And there isn&#x27;t enough for all of that upkeep.&quot; In addition, on October 16, Samsung helped clean the memorial ground as part of the company&#x27;s national day of service.

==Troop statistics==
Engraved on granite blocks near the water pool at the east end of the monument are the casualty statistics for the soldiers who fought in the war.

==United States postage stamp court case==
On February 25, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled on appeal that the memorial-sculptor Frank Gaylord was entitled to compensation for a 37-cent postage stamp—which used an image of the sculpture—because he had not signed away his intellectual property rights to the sculpture when it was erected. The appeals court rejected arguments that the photo was transformative.

In 2002, amateur photographer and retired Marine John Alli was paid $1,500 for the use of one of his photographs of the memorial on a snowy day for the stamp, which sold more than $17 million worth of stamps. In 2006, sculptor Frank Gaylord enlisted Fish &amp; Richardson to make a claim that the Postal Service had violated his intellectual property rights to the sculpture and therefore he should have been compensated. The Postal Service argued that Gaylord was not the sole sculptor (saying he had received advice from federal sources, who recommended that the uniforms appear more in the wind) and also that the sculpture was actually architecture. Gaylord won all of his arguments in the lower court except for one—the court ruled the photo was fair use and thus he was not entitled to compensation. Gaylord challenged the fair-use ruling and won the case on appeal.

Gaylord had sought compensation of 10 percent of the sales. Gaylord&#x27;s original commission was $775,000. On April 22, 2011, the US Court of Federal Claims awarded Gaylord $5,000. On appeal, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the order and remanded the case back to the US Court of Federal Claims. On September 20, 2013, the US Court of Federal Claims awarded Gaylord $684,844.94 in damages, including interest.

<text>Lynn Lake is a town in the northwest region of Manitoba, Canada, approximately from Winnipeg. The town is the fourth-largest town in Manitoba in terms of land area. It is centred on the original urban community of Lynn Lake. The town was named after Lynn Smith, chief engineer of Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd. There are many outfitters in the Lynn Lake area, offering services for most wilderness experiences, including sport fishing and bear and moose hunting.

==History==
Lynn Lake was founded in 1950, when a deposit of nickel ore was discovered. The nickel mine was developed, and soon after, gold was also discovered. Most of Lynn Lake&#x27;s 208 houses and commercial buildings were moved from the town of Sherridon, 120 miles south, over cat train trails. The buildings were moved by digging out the foundations and loading them onto tricycle winter-freighting sleighs pulled by Linn tractors and caterpillar crawlers. The buildings were loaded onto the last sleigh on each cat train, which were usually 4–5 sleighs long.

After a rich vein of copper ore had been nearly depleted in Sherridon, the company sent out prospectors to find another strike. Around 1945, the expeditions were successful when one of the world&#x27;s largest nickel strikes was found near the soon-to-be-established Lynn Lake. Most of the people of Sherridon moved to Lynn Lake when housing was completed.

Gold mining was once the major industry of the town. The mine was shut down in the late 20th century.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Lynn Lake had a population of 579 living in 186 of its 293 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 494. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Statistics Canada amended the 2011 census results to a population of 674 living in 246 of its 386 total dwellings, a −5.6% change from 2006. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.

On October 31, 2016, he announced a return to Lynn Lake for a live performance, scheduled for August 20, 2017. The announcement was made from the Manitoba Legislature as part of a ceremony that announced the renaming of Manitoba Provincial Road 391 from Thompson, MB, to Lynn Lake as the &quot;Life Is A Highway&quot;, in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Cochrane&#x27;s best-selling album &quot;Mad Mad World&quot;.

The station operated 4 hours per day from 6pm to 10pm, 7 days a week. CBTA&#x27;s antenna, transmitter and video equipment were located at the Lynn Lake post office. In early 1969 the province-wide microwave system replaced the video tape recordings. CBTA became part of the CBC network, rebroadcasting programming from CBW TV in Winnipeg. The transmitter was later moved to the MTS site. CBTA was managed and operated by Ken Crowston from September 1966 until shortly after the station connected to live CBC network. Lynn Lake has enjoyed live television since then.

<doc id="425996" wikidata="Q484898" url="?curid=425996" title="Hyeokgeose of Silla">
<text>Hyeokgeose (69 BC – 4 AD, r. 57 BC–4 AD), also known by his personal full name as Bak (Park, Pak) Hyeokgeose (), was the founding monarch of Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was the progenitor of all Bak (Park) clans in Korea.

== Name ==
His title &quot;Geoseo-khan&quot; () or &quot;Geoseul-han&quot; (), means &quot;Emperor&quot; or &quot;king&quot; in the language of the Jinhan confederacy, the group of chiefdoms in the southeast of the Korean Peninsula.

&quot;Hyeokgeose&quot; was not a personal name, but the &quot;hanja&quot; for his honorific name, pronounced &quot;Bulgeunae&quot; () in archaic Korean, meaning &quot;bright world.&quot; &quot;hyeok&quot;, a Chinese character that means &quot;bright, radiant, glowing&quot; (from doubling the character for &quot;jeok&quot; &quot;red&quot;), is used to transcribe the Korean adjective stem &quot;bylg-&quot; &gt; &quot;bulg-&quot; &quot;red&quot; (&lt; ancient Korean word for &quot;red; brightly colored; bright,&quot; related to Korean &quot;byl&quot; &gt; &quot;bul&quot; &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;bawlg-&quot; &gt; &quot;balg-&quot; &quot;bright, light&quot;). &quot;geo&quot;, a Chinese character that means &quot;live, dwell, reside, sit,&quot; is used to transcribe the Korean prenominal adjective inflection &quot;-n&quot; ~ &quot;-eun&quot; &quot;~ that is (bright/red), ~ which is (bright/red).&quot; &quot;se&quot;, a Chinese character that means &quot;a generation; spanning many generations, one generation after another, longstanding, hereditary; a world, all the people living in the world; an epoch, an era, a period, an age; a lifetime; a dynasty, a reign, a regime&quot; is used to transcribe an ancient word related to the obsolescent Korean word &quot;nuy&quot; ~ &quot;nuri&quot; &quot;world&quot; (which, according to the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, has been used in this context in the sense of &quot;governance, rule&quot;).

== Founding legend ==
The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; and &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; describe the founding of Silla by Hyeokgeose.

Refugees of Gojoseon lived in the valleys of present-day Gyeongsang Province, South Korea, in six villages called Yangsan (), Goheo (), Jinji (), Daesu (), Gari (), and Goya ().

In 69 BC, the heads of the six chiefdoms gathered to discuss forming a kingdom and selecting a king. In the forest, at a well called Najeong at Yangsan, a strange light shone from the sky (some accounts describe the simultaneous rising of the sun and moon, as well as a volcanic eruption), and a white horse descended. Chief Sobeolgong of Goheo discovered a large egg there. A boy came out of the egg, and when bathed, his body radiated light and birds and beasts danced. The egg was gourd-shaped, which has been posited as the origin of the Bak (Park, Pak) name, as it aligns with the Korean word for gourd (, &quot;bak&quot;).

Sobeolgong raised him, and the six chieftains revered him. The chieftains made him king when he became 13 years old. The state was named Seorabeol.

Upon becoming king, he married Lady Aryeong, who is said to have been born from the ribs of a dragon.

== Historical context ==

This legend reflects developments in the city-state stage, the six chieftains representing a loose group of Gojoseon refugees. The story implies the ascendency of the Bak clan over the native peoples, and may indicate horse and sun worship.

The founding date is widely questioned today, as the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; was written from the viewpoint of Silla, claiming Silla&#x27;s superiority and antiquity over Goguryeo and Baekje. Silla in this traditional thinking is thought to have been founded first, followed by Goguryeo, and then Baekje. Archaeological evidence, however, paints a different picture, and it is suspected that Goguryeo is the oldest of the three kingdoms, with Silla developing either concurrently with Baekje or after it.

== Reign ==

According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Hyeokgeose and his queen traveled the realm in 41 BC, helping the people improve their harvests. The people praised them as the Two Saints or Two Holy Ones ().

In 37 BC Hyeokgeose built Geumseong () in the capital city (present-day Gyeongju), and in 32 BC he built a royal palace inside.

In 20 BC, the king of the Mahan confederacy demanded a tribute. Silla sent Hogong, who was a minister of Silla. The king was angry that Silla sent Hogong and not a tribute. Hogong criticized the king&#x27;s impoliteness with fortitude. The king was angry at him and tried to kill him, but nearby subordinates stopped the king, and he was permitted to return to Silla.

In 19 BC, Hyeokgeose also sent an emissary upon the death of the Mahan king. In 5 BC, East Okjeo (a small state to the north, later conquered by Goguryeo) sent an emissary, and Hyeokgeose presented him with 20 horses.

According to Samguk yusa, in the 61st year(4 CE), one day he went up to the sky, and eight days later, his body was scattered on the ground. And the queen also follows the king and dies. The people of the country tried to bury them, but a large snake appeared and disturbed them. Accordingly, the head and limbs were buried separately to create &quot;five tombs&quot; (), and the name of the tomb was called Sareung. It is called &quot;Sareung&quot; () because snake () protect the tomb.

== Death and succession ==
Hyeokgeose ruled for around 60 years, and set the foundation for a kingdom that would unify much of the Korean Peninsula in 668.

Hyeokgeose maintained control over his kingdom and was one of the few Park rulers to hold complete power over Silla. He died at age 73, and was buried in Sareung, north of Dameomsa (south of Namcheon). Hyeokgeose was succeeded by his eldest son Namhae. According to the Samguk yusa, Namhae had violently usurped Hyeokgeose&#x27; throne and killed him. Modern historians also believe that Hyeokgeose&#x27;s successor Namhae may have actually been a Baekje priest who had been expelled from Baekje and had settled in Silla before becoming king.

== Legacy ==

Though not much is known about Hyeokgeose, his many legacies and reminders survive to this day. One of them being his numerous descendants, the Park clans of Korea, who are numbered as the third largest group of people with a common last name. All the Park clans in Korea trace their ancestry back to the first king of Silla, Bak Hyeokgeose. Another legacy was the kingdom that he established. The fact that he founded the Silla kingdom remained under high respects and great consideration by Gyeongju Gim (Kim) () clan and Wolseong Seok () clan throughout Silla&#x27;s history.

<text>was a Japanese convicted war criminal and general in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. Yamashita led Japanese forces during the invasion of Malaya and Battle of Singapore. His conquest of Malaya and Singapore in 70 days earned him the sobriquet &quot;The Tiger of Malaya&quot; and led to the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill calling the ignominious fall of Singapore to Japan the &quot;worst disaster&quot; and &quot;largest capitulation&quot; in British military history. He was assigned to defend the Philippines from the advancing Allies later in the war. Although he was unable to prevent the superior Allied forces from advancing, despite dwindling supplies and Allied guerrilla action, he was able to hold on to part of Luzon until after the formal Surrender of Japan in August 1945.

Under Yamashita&#x27;s command, at least 350,000 to 450,000 were killed. Yamashita was in overall command during Sook Ching, the Rape of Manila, and other atrocities. 

After the war, Yamashita was tried for war crimes committed by troops under his command during the Japanese defense of the occupied Philippines in 1944. Yamashita denied ordering those war crimes and denied having knowledge that they even occurred. Conflicting evidence was presented during the trial concerning whether Yamashita had implicitly affirmed commission of these crimes in his orders and whether he knew of the crimes being committed. The court eventually found Yamashita guilty and he was executed in February, 1946. The ruling against Yamashita – holding the commander responsible for subordinates&#x27; war crimes as long as the commander did not attempt to discover and stop them from occurring – came to be known as the Yamashita standard.

== Biography ==
Yamashita was the second son of a local doctor in Osugi, a village in what is now part of Ōtoyo, Kōchi Prefecture, Shikoku. He attended military preparatory schools in his youth.

=== Early military career ===
In November 1905, Yamashita graduated from the 18th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. He was ranked 16th out of 920 cadets. In December 1908 he was promoted to lieutenant and fought against the German Empire in World War I in Shandong, China in 1914. In May 1916 he was promoted to captain. He attended the 28th class of the Army War College, graduating sixth in his class in 1916. The same year, he married Hisako Nagayama, daughter of retired Gen. Nagayama. Yamashita became an expert on Germany, serving as assistant military attaché at Bern and Berlin from 1919 to 1922.

In February 1922, he was promoted to major. He twice served in the Military Affairs Bureau of the War Ministry responsible for the Ugaki Army Reduction Program, aimed at reforming the Japanese army by streamlining its organisation despite facing fierce opposition from factions within the Army.

In 1922, upon his return to Japan, Major Yamashita served in the Imperial Headquarters and the Staff College, receiving promotion to lieutenant-colonel in August 1925. While posted to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, Yamashita unsuccessfully promoted a military reduction plan. Despite his ability, Yamashita fell into disfavor as a result of his involvement with political factions within the Japanese military.

As a leading member of the &quot;Imperial Way&quot; group, he became a rival to Hideki Tojo and other members of the &quot;Control Faction&quot;. In 1927 Yamashita was posted to Vienna, Austria, as a military attaché until 1930. He was then promoted to the rank of colonel. In 1930 Col. Yamashita was given command of the elite 3rd Imperial Infantry Regiment (Imperial Guards Division). He was promoted to major-general in August 1934.

After the February 26 Incident of 1936, he fell into disfavor with Emperor Hirohito due to his appeal for leniency toward rebel officers involved in the attempted coup. He realized that he had lost the trust of the Emperor and decided to resign from the Army—a decision that his superiors dissuaded him from carrying out. He was eventually relegated to a post in Korea, being given command of a brigade. Akashi Yoji argued in his article &quot;General Yamashita Tomoyuki: Commander of the Twenty-Fifth Army&quot; that his time in Korea gave him the chance to reflect on his conduct during the 1936 coup and at the same time study Zen Buddhism, something which caused him to mellow in character yet instilled a high level of discipline.

Yamashita was promoted to lieutenant-general in November 1937. He insisted that Japan should end the conflict with China and keep peaceful relations with the United States and Great Britain, but he was ignored and subsequently assigned to an unimportant post in the Kwantung Army.

From 1938 to 1940, he was assigned to command the IJA 4th Division which saw some action in northern China against insurgents fighting the occupying Japanese armies. In December 1940 Yamashita was sent on a six-month clandestine military mission to Germany (meeting Adolf Hitler in Berlin on 16 June 1941) and Italy, meeting Benito Mussolini.

Throughout his time in the military, Yamashita had consistently urged the implementation of his proposals, which included &quot;streamlining the air arm, to mechanize the Army, to integrate control of the armed forces in a defense ministry coordinated by a chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, to create a paratroop corps and to employ effective propaganda&quot;.

Such strategies caused much friction between himself and Gen. Hideki Tojo, the war minister, who was not keen on implementing these proposals.

=== World War II ===

==== Malaya and Singapore ====

On 6 November 1941 Lt. Gen. Yamashita was put in command of the Twenty-Fifth Army. It was his belief that victory in Malaya would be successful only if his troops could make an amphibious landing—something that was dependent on whether he would have enough air and naval support to provide a good landing site.

On 8 December he launched an invasion of Malaya from bases in French Indochina. Yamashita remarked that only a &quot;driving charge&quot; would ensure victory in Malaya. This is because the Japanese force was about one-third as large as the opposing British forces in Malaya and Singapore. The plan was to conquer Malaya and Singapore as quickly as possible in order to overcome any numerical disadvantage and minimize any potential losses from a long, drawn-out battle.

The Malayan campaign concluded with the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942, in which Yamashita&#x27;s 30,000 front-line soldiers captured 80,000 British, Indian and Australian troops, the largest surrender of British-led personnel in history. This victory earned him the sobriquet &quot;Tiger of Malaya&quot;.

The campaign and the subsequent Japanese occupation of Singapore included war crimes committed against captive Allied personnel and civilians, such as the Alexandra Hospital and Sook Ching massacres. Yamashita&#x27;s culpability for these events remains a matter of controversy as some argued that he had failed to prevent them. The order to execute 50,000 Chinese came, according to postwar testimony, from senior officers within Yamashita&#x27;s Operations staff. Yamashita&#x27;s troops had fought in China, where it was customary to conduct massacres to subdue the population. Major Ōnishi Satoru, one of the accused in the postwar trial, affirmed that he acted under a specific order issued from General Headquarters, that read, &#x27;Due to the fact that the army is advancing fast and in order to preserve peace behind us it is essential to massacre as many Chinese as possible who appear in any way to have anti-Japanese feelings.&#x27;

Yamashita later apologized to the few survivors of the 650 bayoneted or shot at Alexandra Hospital, and allegedly some soldiers caught looting in the aftermath of the slaughter were executed. Akashi Yoji claims that this would have been in line with Yamashita&#x27;s personality and belief. According to him, the first orders given by Yamashita to the soldiers was &quot;no looting; no rape; no arson&quot;, and that any soldier committing such acts would be severely punished and his superior held accountable.

Nevertheless, Yamashita&#x27;s warnings to his troops were generally not heeded, and wanton acts of violence were reported. In his article, Akashi argued that the main issue was that despite being an excellent tactician and leader, his personal ideals constantly placed him at odds with the General Staff and War Ministry. His humane treatment of prisoners of war as well as British leaders was something the other officers had difficulty coming to terms with.

Despite the finger of blame for the Sook Ching Massacre being pointed at Yamashita, it is now argued that he had no direct part in it, and his subordinates were the ones behind the incident. A study by Ian Ward concluded that Yamashita should not be held responsible for the Sook Ching Massacre, but Ward did hold him responsible &quot;for failing to guard against Tsuji&#x27;s manipulation of Command affairs&quot;.

==== Manchukuo ====
On 17 July 1942, Yamashita was reassigned from Singapore to far-away Manchukuo again, having been given a post in commanding the First Area Army, and was effectively sidelined for a major part of the Pacific War. It is thought that Tojo, by then the Prime Minister, was responsible for his banishment, taking advantage of Yamashita&#x27;s gaffe during a speech made to Singaporean civilian leaders in early 1942, when he referred to the local populace as &quot;citizens of the Empire of Japan&quot; (this was considered embarrassing for the Japanese government, who officially did not consider the residents of occupied territories to have the rights or privileges of Japanese citizenship). He was promoted to full general in February 1943. Some have suggested that he may have been sent there to prepare for an attack upon the Soviet Union in the event that Stalingrad fell to Germany.

==== Philippines ====

On 26 September 1944, when the war situation was critical for Japan, Yamashita was rescued from his enforced exile in China by the new Japanese government after the downfall of Hideki Tōjō and his cabinet, and he assumed the command of the Fourteenth Area Army to defend the occupied Philippines on 10 October. U.S. forces landed on Leyte ten days later. On 6 January 1945, the Sixth U.S. Army, totaling 200,000 men, landed at Lingayen Gulf in Luzon.

Yamashita commanded approximately 262,000 troops in three defensive groups; the largest, the &quot;Shobu&quot; Group, under his personal command numbered 152,000 troops, defended northern Luzon. The smallest group, totaling 30,000 troops, known as the &quot;Kembu&quot; Group, under the command of Rikichi Tsukada, defended Bataan and the western shores. The last group, the &quot;Shimbu&quot; Group, totaling 80,000 men under the command of Shizuo Yokoyama, defended Manila and southern Luzon. Yamashita tried to rebuild his army but was forced to retreat from Manila to the Sierra Madre mountains of northern Luzon, as well as the Cordillera Central mountains. Yamashita ordered all troops, except those given the task of ensuring security, out of the city.

Yamashita did not declare Manila an open city as General Douglas MacArthur had done in December 1941 before its capture. When a military commander or political leader formally declares an open city, this means that the defending military will not defend the city in battle and the victorious forces can enter unopposed. Open city declarations are declared in order to save civilian lives and to guarantee no destruction of buildings. Because Yamashita, who also served as the governor-general and military governor of the Philippines, did not declare Manila an open city while he evacuated most of his soldiers northward, Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi re-occupied Manila with 16,000 sailors, with the intent of destroying all port facilities and naval storehouses. Once there, Iwabuchi took command of the 3,750 Army security troops, and against Yamashita&#x27;s specific order, turned the city into a battlefield. The battle and the Japanese atrocities resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000 Filipino civilians, in what is known as the Manila massacre, during the fierce street fighting for the capital which raged between 4 February and 3 March.

Yamashita continued to employ delay tactics to maintain his army in Kiangan (part of the Ifugao Province), until 2 September 1945, the day of the formal surrender of Japan to General Douglas MacArthur. At the time of his surrender, to Major General Robert S. Beightler, Yamashita&#x27;s forces had been reduced to under 50,000 by the lack of supplies and tough campaigning by elements of the combined American and Filipino soldiers including the recognized guerrillas.

== Trial ==

From 29 October to 7 December 1945, an American military tribunal in Manila tried General Yamashita for war crimes relating to the Manila massacre and many atrocities in the Philippines against civilians and prisoners of war, and sentenced him to death. Yamashita was held responsible for numerous war crimes that the prosecution claimed was a systematic campaign to torture and kill Filipino civilians and Allied POWs as shown in the Palawan Massacre of 139 U.S. POWs, wanton executions of guerrillas, soldiers, and civilians without due process like the execution of Philippine Army general Vicente Lim, and the massacre of 25,000 civilians in Batangas Province. These crimes that were committed outside of the Manila massacre were done by the Japanese Army, not the Navy. It was argued that Yamashita was in full command of the Japanese Army&#x27;s secret military police, the Kempeitai, which committed numerous war crimes on POWs and civilian internees and he simply nodded his head without protest when asked by his Kempeitai subordinates to execute people without due process or trials because there were too many prisoners to do proper trials. This controversial case has become a precedent regarding the command responsibility for war crimes and is known as the Yamashita Standard.

The principal accusation against Yamashita was that he had failed in his duty as commander of Japanese forces in the Philippines to prevent them from committing atrocities. The defense acknowledged that atrocities had been committed but contended that the breakdown of communications and the Japanese chain of command in the chaotic battle of the second Philippines campaign was such that Yamashita could not have controlled his troops even if he had known of their actions, which was not certain in any case; furthermore, many of the atrocities had been committed by Japanese naval forces outside his command. The prosecution countered by presenting testimony (some of it hearsay) from multiple individuals indicating that the orders had come from Yamashita. One such hearsay statement alleged that Yamashita had told General Artemio Ricarte to &quot;wipe out the whole Philippines... since everyone in the Islands were either guerrillas or active supporters of the guerrillas.&quot; Another piece of testimony alleging that Yamashita had made similar statements to Ricarte through translation by the latter&#x27;s grandson, was refuted by the grandson who denied ever having translated such a statement. However, some firsthand evidence was presented that Yamashita ordered or agreed with proposed orders that trials be foregone for suspected guerrillas and punishments handled directly by military tribunal officers following cursory investigations.

American lawyer Harry E. Clarke Sr., a colonel in the United States Army at the time, served as the chief counsel for the defense. In his opening statement, Clarke asserted:


For his part Yamashita denied he had knowledge of the crimes committed by his men, and claimed that he would have harshly punished them if he had had that knowledge. Further, he argued that with an army as large as his, there was no way for him to control all actions by all his subordinates. As such he felt what he was really being charged with was losing the war:

The court found Yamashita guilty as charged and sentenced him to death. Clarke appealed the sentence to General MacArthur, who upheld it. He then appealed to the Supreme Court of the Philippines and the Supreme Court of the United States, both of which declined to review the verdict. President Truman denied Yamashita&#x27;s petition to grant clemency and let the decision stand.

In dissent from the Supreme Court of the United States&#x27;s majority, Justice W.B. Rutledge wrote:

The legitimacy of the hasty trial was questioned at the time, including by Justice Frank Murphy, who protested various procedural issues, the inclusion of hearsay evidence, and the general lack of professional conduct by the prosecuting officers. Evidence that Yamashita did not have ultimate command responsibility over all military units in the Philippines was not admitted in court.

Former war crimes prosecutor Allan A. Ryan has argued that by order of General MacArthur and five other generals, and the Supreme Court of the United States, Yamashita was executed for what his soldiers did without his approval or even prior knowledge. The two dissenting Supreme Court Justices called the entire trial a miscarriage of justice, an exercise in vengeance, and a denial of human rights.

=== Execution ===
Following the Supreme Court decision, an appeal for clemency was made to U.S. President Harry S. Truman, who declined to intervene and left the matter entirely in the hands of the military authorities. In due course, General MacArthur confirmed the sentence of the commission.

On 23 February 1946, Yamashita was hanged at Los Baños, Laguna Prison Camp, south of Manila. After climbing the thirteen steps leading to the gallows, he was asked if he had a final statement. The &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; alleges that his reply, through a translator, was thus:

Yamashita was hanged. He was later buried first at the Japanese cemetery near the Los Baños Prison Camp. His remains were moved to Tama Cemetery, Fuchū, Tokyo.

On 23 December 1948, Akira Mutō, Yamashita&#x27;s chief of staff in the Philippines, was executed after being found guilty of war crimes by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.

=== Enduring legal legacy ===
The U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1946 Yamashita decision set a precedent, called command responsibility or the Yamashita standard, in that a commander can be held accountable before the law for the crimes committed by his troops even if he did not order them, didn&#x27;t stand by to allow them, or possibly even know about them or have the means to stop them. This doctrine of command accountability has been added to the Geneva Conventions and was applied to dozens of trials in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. It has been adopted by the International Criminal Court established in 2002.

=== Last will ===
On 22 February 1946--hours before his execution--in his last will, Yamashita expressed deep remorse for deaths of his soldiers. He urged the Japanese people to focus on rebuilding the nation and envision a hopeful future. Yamashita emphasized by sharing his vision for rebuilding Japan encouraging the importance of cultivating a strong sense of duty and moral judgment, promoting scientific education and highlighted the vital role of women as educators in nurturing the next generation in rebuilding Japan.

<text>The relationship between [[Buddhism]] and [[sexual orientation]] varies by tradition and teacher. According to some scholars, early Buddhism appears to have placed no special stigma on homosexual relations, since the subject was not mentioned.

It is likely that Chinese Buddhism was influenced by Confucian norms prohibiting homosexual marriage. Marriage is largely considered to be a secular issue within Buddhism. 

==Buddhist texts==

===Early texts===

Within the earliest monastic texts such as the Vinaya ( 4th century BCE), male monks are explicitly forbidden from having sexual relations with any of the four genders: male, female, &quot;ubhatovyañjanaka&quot; and &quot;paṇḍaka&quot;; various meanings of these words are given below. Later, the Buddha allowed the ordination of women, forbade ordination to these other types of people, with exceptions to a few particular types of paṇḍaka. The Buddha&#x27;s proscriptions against certain types of people joining the monastic sangha (ordained community) are often understood to reflect his concern with upholding the public image of the sangha as virtuous; in some cases, this is explicitly stated. Social acceptability was vital for the sangha, as it could not survive without material support from lay society.

====Ubhatovyañjanakas====

The word &quot;ubhatovyañjanaka&quot; is usually thought to describe people who have both male and female sexual characteristics: hermaphrodites (intersex). In the Vinaya, it is said that &quot;ubhatovyañjanaka&quot; should not be ordained, on account of the possibility that they would entice a fellow monk or nun into having sex. It has been seen by some that the category of &quot;ubhatovyañjanaka&quot; is of later addition to the early buddhist texts, since it does not appear in the early suttas, the &quot;Pāṭimokkhas&quot;, nor in the early parts of the Vinaya.

====Paṇḍakas====
The &quot;paṇḍaka&quot; is a complex category that is variously defined in different Buddhist texts. In the earliest texts, the word seems to refer to a socially stigmatized class of trans-feminine and/or cross-dressing people, some of whom may have been sex workers. Paisarn Likhitpreechakul argue that these people are grouped together with groups who are excluded from ordination as well; those with physical disabilities such as deafness or dwarfism, or those who have committed crimes. &quot;The Story of the Prohibition of the Ordination of Pandaka&quot; from the Vinaya claims that the ban is a response to the example of a paṇḍaka monk with a desire to have sex. Being refused by other monks, he had sex with animal handlers, who then told the wider community and brought disgrace upon the sangha. Since the word &quot;paṇḍaka&quot; does not appear in either of the early Suttas nor in the early parts of the Vinaya, it has been seen by some as a possible indication that &quot;pandaka&#x27;s&quot; inclusion in the Vinaya did not happen in the Buddha&#x27;s lifetime but was added later.

In the Lotus Sutra, it said Bodhisattva should not go near Paṇḍaka, as like what monk rules said in Vinaya. The Theravadin text Milinda Panha, claims that Paṇḍakas let out secrets through their imperfection.

===LGBTQ+ people in later traditions===
Some modern commentators interpret the word &quot;ubhatovyanjañaka&quot; as including those who are not physically intersex, but display behavioral and psychological characteristics of both sexes, such as a woman who is attracted to other women. 5th-century Buddhist writer Buddhaghosa describes &quot;ubhatobyanjanaka&quot; as people with the body of one sex but the &quot;power&quot;, or gender of the other. Leonard Zwilling argues that in this account Buddhaghosa does not in fact describe &quot;hermaphroditism&quot; but rather bisexuality or homosexuality. Janet Gyatso pointed out that Zwilling destroys his own argument that pandakas are homosexuals when he writes, &quot;The Vinaya, in fact, goes so far as to distinguish sexual activity between normative males from sexual relations between a socially normative male and a pandaka.&quot;

In other texts, the term &quot;paṇḍaka&quot; can include those born sexually indeterminate or with no sex, eunuchs, those whose impotence changes every half month, males who gain sexual potency by absorbing other men&#x27;s semen, or spying on other people having sex. It sometimes includes males or females with any sexual dysfunction, such as impotence or irregular menstrual cycles. The common element seems to be those whose sexuality is either limited physiologically, or those who are sexually impotent. Together these impotence types are almost always portrayed negatively as a pariah class, especially in the earliest texts. In modern contexts, paṇḍaka is sometimes alleged to include lesbians, gay men, and transgender and intersex people, although in ancient times, a man who sexually penetrated another man or a paṇḍaka was not himself considered a paṇḍaka.

Some texts of the Abhidharma state that a paṇḍaka cannot achieve enlightenment in their own lifetime, but must wait for reincarnation as a man or woman. Ananda — Buddha&#x27;s cousin and disciple — was said to be a paṇḍaka in one of his many previous lives, as was the Buddhist nun Isidāsī (from the Therigatha). In both cases, birth as a paṇḍaka was a result of poor karma, and the idea that being a paṇḍaka stems from bad behaviour in a previous life is common in Buddhist literature. Asanga and Vasubandhu discussed if a pandaka was able to be enlightened or not.

In the Samantapasadika, a work of the 5th century CE Theravadin commentator and scholar Buddhaghosa, paṇḍaka are described as being filled with defiling passions (&quot;ussanakilesa&quot;), unquenchable lusts (&quot;avapasantaparilaha&quot;) and are dominated by their libido (&quot;parilahavegabhibhuta&quot;). Nevertheless, Buddhaghosa did not forbid all Paṇḍakas from becoming ordained as monks; indeed, the &quot;āsittapaṇḍaka&quot; was allowed to join. Notably, the &quot;āsittapaṇḍaka&quot; was a male that gained &quot;satisfaction from performing oral sex on another man&quot;. Hence, there does not appear to be a consistent exclusion of homosexual Paṇḍakas by Buddhaghosa. The 4th century Mahayana Buddhist writers Vasubandhu and Asanga contend that the paṇḍaka has no discipline for spiritual practice, due to their defiling passions of both male and female sexes. They lack the moral fortitude to counter these passions because they lack modesty and shame. Incapable of showing restraint, such a being is abandoned by their parents and lacking such ties are unable to hold strong views. Asanga, like Vasubandhu, refuses the pandaka recognition as a layman on the grounds that such persons are unfit to associate with or serve the Sangha. Asanga, however, considers them capable to practice the path of a layman individually if they so desire, but without receiving recognition as a layman or being introduced in the sangha. A position similar to Asanga view was also featured in the Lotus Sutra, where sangha members were advised to avoid the paṇḍaka.

Buddha&#x27;s proscriptions against certain types of people joining the monastic sangha (ordained community) are often understood to reflect his concern with upholding the public image of the sangha as virtuous. Peter Jackson, the scholar of sexual politics and Buddhism in Thailand, speculates that the Buddha was initially reluctant to allow women to join the sangha for this reason. Jackson explains:

Buddhism, the middle path, has always been concerned with the maintenance of social order and since the Buddha&#x27;s time the sangha has never claimed to provide a universal vehicle for the spiritual liberation of all individuals in society, explicitly excluding those who are considered to reflect badly on the monkhood in terms of prevailing social norms and attitudes.

Social acceptability was vital for the sangha, as it could not survive without material support from lay society.

Several Theravada Buddhist texts state that the members of the paṇḍaka are excluded from a variety of Buddhist practices (in addition to ordination):

* acting as preceptors in ordination ceremonies
* making donations to begging monks
* meditating and
* ability to understand the Dharma.

Classical Mahayana scholars like Shantideva and Aśvaghoṣa considered non-vaginal sex (including sex between men) to be sexual misconduct. Shantideva based his views on quotes from the Saddharma-smrtyupasthana Sutra. According to Mizuno Kōgen&#x27;s study, Saddharma-smrtyupasthana Sutra is related to Ghoṣa&#x27;s Abhidharmāmṛtarasaśāstra, and is compiled by Sarvastivada sect (possibly from someone related to Ghoṣa after the 2nd century). In the Great Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom (Sanskrit: Mahā-prajñāpāramitā-śāstra), the Madhyamaka scholar Nagarjuna mentioned the non-vagina sex restriction as based on coerced action toward one&#x27;s own spouse.

In contrast, later texts, particularly Tibetan Buddhist writings, occasionally value paṇḍaka positively for their &quot;middleness&quot; and balance. The paṇḍaka in these Tibetan works is translated with the term &quot;ma ning&quot; — &quot;genderless&quot; or &quot;without genitals&quot;. The 13th-century Tibetan monk Gyalwa Yang Gönpa, who was one of the significant figures in the early Drukpa Kagyu sect, writes about &quot;ma ning&quot; as a balanced state between maleness and femaleness. Yang Gönpa describes &quot;ma ning&quot; as &quot;the abiding breath between male exhalation and female inhalation&quot; and &quot;the balanced yogic channel, as opposed to the too tight male channel, and the too loose female one&quot;.

Most Mahayana teachings assert that all beings who correctly practice the dharma may reach enlightenment, since all possess innate Buddha nature. Enlightenment being achievable even in a single life.

==Tibetan Buddhism==
There are different views among Tibetan Buddhist teachers on acceptable expressions of sexuality.

Historically, Gampopa (12th century), one of the main early masters of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, followed the Indian Buddhist tradition, starting with the 3rd-century Hinayana texts of Vasubandhu, and stated that oral and anal sex, whether with a man or a woman, are violations of the third precept regarding inappropriate sexual behavior. Longchenpa, the 13th-century founder of the Nyingma school, citing the 3rd-century Mahayana texts of the Indian master Asanga, elaborated that inappropriate sexual behavior also include using hands to stimulate inappropriate parts of the body for sexual activity. In the same way, Gelug predecessor Je Tsongkhapa also adheres to such rules in his studies.

Various contemporary teachers of Tibetan Buddhist lineages, including the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa, have offered understanding towards LGBTQ people while noting that same-sex relationships do not necessarily constitute misconduct for lay people. The Dalai Lama has maintained the views of Je Tsongkhapa.

The 14th Dalai Lama has &quot;voiced his support for the full recognition of human rights for all people, regardless of sexual orientation,&quot; while noting that from a Buddhist point of view, lesbian and gay sex is &quot;generally considered sexual misconduct.&quot; In the most recent interview with the Dalai Lama on this topic (March 10, 2014), the Dalai Lama said gay marriage is OK provided it&#x27;s not in contradiction with the values of one&#x27;s chosen religion.

The Dalai Lama has also stated that any sex other than penis-vagina intercourse with one&#x27;s own monogamous partner, including oral sex, anal sex, and masturbation is improper from the Buddhist perspective. In his 1996 book &quot;Beyond Dogma&quot;, he states, &quot;A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else... homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in itself. What is improper is the use of organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact.&quot;

The Dalai Lama cited the Indian Buddhist texts of Vasubandhu, Asanga, and Ashvaghosha as his sources concerning what constitutes inappropriate sexual behavior. In 1997 he stated: &quot;Sexual organs were created for reproduction between the male element and the female element — and everything that deviates from that is not acceptable from a Buddhist point of view.&quot; The Dalai Lama has repeatedly said to LGBT groups that he can&#x27;t rewrite the texts. He thinks that this is the type of issue that would need to be discussed by a council of Buddhist elders from all Buddhist traditions.

==Theravada Buddhism==
Peter Jackson, an Australian scholar of sexual politics and Buddhism in Thailand, writes that &quot;Buddhism is a complex tradition and there is no single canonical or scripturally sanctioned position on homosexuality.&quot; Thailand is one of several countries with a large population of Theravada Buddhist.

In traditional Thai Buddhist accounts of sexuality, &quot;[sexual] actions and desires have an involuntary cause [and] do not themselves accrue any future karmic consequences. They are the outworking of past karma, not sources for the accumulation of future karma. According to Bunmi, homosexual activity and the desire to engage in homosexual activity fall into this category and are not sinful and do not accrue karmic consequences.&quot; Jackson writes that this understanding of homosexuality &quot;prevailed in Thailand until recent decades.&quot;

In the 1980s in Thailand, during the AIDS epidemic, there was &quot;a shift in Buddhist attitudes from relative tolerance of homosexuality to condemnation.&quot; These views were &quot;unprecedented in recent Thai history.&quot; During this time there were two ways Buddhists viewed homosexuality: in the sympathetic view, it was said that homosexuality arose from the karma of previous lifetimes; in the intolerant view, it was seen as arising from immoral conduct in one&#x27;s present life.

In 1989, the supreme governing body of the Thai sangha affirmed that &quot;gays&quot; (here translated from Thai &quot;kathoey&quot;) are prohibited from being ordained. Their declaration has apparently gone unheeded in some quarters, as Phra Pisarn Thammapatee (AKA Phra Payom Kalayano), one of the most eminent monks in the country, demanded in 2003 that 1,000 gay monks be ousted from the sangha, and that better screening processes are put in place to keep out any gay postulants.

Recently, Phra Payom Kalayano, an eminent monk and abbot, affirmed the rights of gay monks to join the Sangha: &quot;In the past, katoey had no hope of being ordained because the rules were stricter and society was less open minded. But they have just as much right as anyone else to join the monkhood.&quot; This view has been affirmed by other Thai Theravada monks. But it&#x27;s not known if that statement given by Phra Payom was supported only by some monks of his sangha or by official structures of his Theravada school. There is no information if any other Thai branches of Theravada has changed their attitude towards LGBT ordination because other Theravada branches does not seem to have changed their attitude on this issue.

==Japanese Buddhism==

Several writers have noted the strong historical tradition of open bisexuality and homosexuality among male Buddhist institutions in Japan. When the Tendai priest Genshin harshly criticised homosexuality as immoral, others mistook his criticism as having been because the acolyte wasn&#x27;t one&#x27;s own. &quot;Chigo Monogatari&quot; (稚児物語), &quot;acolyte stories&quot; of love between monks and their &quot;chigo&quot; were popular, and such relationships appear to have been commonplace, alongside sex with women.

Western Christian travellers to Japan from the 16th century have noted (with distaste) the prevalence and acceptance of forms of homosexuality among Japanese Buddhists—Jesuit priest Francis Cabral wrote in 1596 that &quot;abominations of the flesh&quot; and &quot;vicious habits&quot; were &quot;regarded in Japan as quite honourable; men of standing entrust their sons to the bonzes to be instructed in such things, and at the same time to serve their lust&quot;.

A 17th-century Japanese Buddhist scholar, Kitamura Kigin (北村季吟,), wrote that Buddha explained the pursuit of homosexuality over heterosexuality among priests:
It has been the nature of men&#x27;s hearts to take pleasure in a beautiful woman since the age of male and female gods, but to become intoxicated by the blossom of a handsome youth... would seem to be both wrong and unusual. Nevertheless, the Buddha preached that [Mount] Imose was a place to be avoided and the priests of the law entered this Way as an outlet for their feelings, since their hearts were, after all, made of neither stone nor wood. Like water that plunges from the peak of Tsukubane to form the deep pools of the Minano River, this love has surpassed in depth the love between women and men in these latter days. It plagues the heart not only of courtier and aristocrat but also of brave warriors. Even the mountain dwellers who cut brush for fuel have learned to take pleasure in the shade of young saplings.&quot; — Wild Azaleas (1676)
A later Japanese legend attributed the introduction of monastic homosexuality to Japan to Shingon founder Kukai, although scholars now dismiss the veracity of this assertion, pointing out his strict adherence to the Vinaya. Nonetheless, the legend served to &quot;affirm same-sex relation between men and boys in 17th century Japan.&quot;

==Chinese Buddhism==
About Buddhism and homosexuality in China, scholar A. L. De Silva writes, &quot;Generally the attitude has been one of tolerance. Matteo Ricci, the Jesuit missionary who lived in China for 27 years from 1583, expressed horror at the open and tolerant attitude that the Chinese took to homosexuality and naturally enough saw this as proof of the degeneracy of Chinese society.&quot;

Venerable Hsing Yun, one of the premier figures in contemporary Taiwanese Buddhism, has stated that Buddhism should never teach intolerance toward homosexuality, and that people should expand their minds.

Hsing Yun is a best-selling author throughout the Sinosphere, as well as an advocate of Humanistic Buddhism, an approach to reform Chinese Buddhism to match the needs of contemporary laypeople. As such, his views may not be wholly reflective of the older Buddhist views in China. However, at an earlier point (1998), he is quoted as remarking that &quot;according to Buddhism, any emotional involvement, whether homosexual or heterosexual, is a form of attachment ... and, therefore, is a source of suffering,&quot; and when the topic of homosexuality, in particular, came up &quot;the master spoke more strongly, calling homosexuality a perverted view (&quot;xiejian&quot;).&quot;

An example of an older view in opposition to homosexuality is given by the traditional master, Hsuan Hua, an important figure for Buddhism in both China and the United States. Master Hsuan Hua stated that homosexuality &quot;plants the seeds that lead to rebirth in the lower realms of existence&quot;. In his commentary on the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters, he described homosexuality as behavior caused by confusion, as the product of sexual desires.

Some Mahayana Buddhist leaders were active in the movement for same-sex marriage rights in Taiwan which legalized same-sex marriages in 2019.

==Buddhism in the West==

In contrast to Buddhism in Asia, modern Buddhism in the Western world (European Union, United States of America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) is typically associated with a concern for social equality—partly as a result of its largely middle-class intellectual membership base, and its philosophical roots in freethought and secular humanism. When applying Buddhist philosophy to the question of homosexuality, western Buddhists often emphasize the importance the Buddha placed on tolerance, compassion, and seeking answers within one&#x27;s self. They stress these overarching values rather than examining specific passages or texts. As a result, western Buddhism is often relatively gay-friendly, especially since the 1990s. As an interpretation of what is sexual misconduct is an individual decision and not subject to judgment by any central authority, a view of accepting all peoples, but rejecting certain types of sexual acts is more predominant. LGBT people such as Issan Dorsey, Caitriona Reed, Pat Enkyo O&#x27;Hara and Soeng Hyang have been ordained as Buddhist monastics and clergy.

A more anachronistic assessment comes from the western scholar Alexander Berzin, 

The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, holder of the Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lineages, in a 2008 talk delivered to LGBTQ Dharma practitioners at the Shambhala Meditation Center of New York, stressed that for vajrayana lay practitioners, homosexual relationships are no better or worse than heterosexual relationships and that only unhealthy relationships, in general, are to be avoided. Both the Nalandabodhi sangha, which was founded by The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, and the Shambhala sanghas founded by Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche have stated that they are welcoming of all sexual orientations. The Shambhala Meditation Center of New York hosts a weekly practice group, Queer Dharma, specifically catering to the needs of the LGBTQ Buddhist community. According to the Danish Karma Kagyu Lama Ole Nydahl, Buddha saw homosexuality as circumstances making life more difficult, but also explained the reason for homosexuality could be aversion against the opposite sex in a former life. Nydahl says however that sexual orientation is not really important in order to practice Buddhism. Well known Zen Buddhist, Thích Nhất Hạnh (Plum Village Tradition), notes the spirit of Buddhism is inclusiveness and states &quot;when you look at the ocean, you see different kinds of waves, many sizes and shapes, but all the waves have water as their foundation and substance. If you are born gay or lesbian, your ground of being in the same as mine. We are different, but we share the same ground of being.&quot;

The U.S. branch of Soka Gakkai International, a Japan-based new religious movement (Japanese new religion) influenced by Nichiren Buddhism, announced in 1995 that they would start holding wedding ceremonies for same-sex couples, and in 2001 established a conference for LGBTQ members and their supporters. A Buddhist temple in Salt Lake City connected with Jodo Shinshu, another Japanese school of Buddhism, also holds religious rites for same-sex couples.

Another Buddhist organization founded in the West, Juniper Foundation, wrote an article &quot;A Buddhist Vote for Same Sex Marriage&quot; demonstrating how Buddhist thinking embraces same-sex marriage:
The heart of Buddhist thought is its insight philosophy, which uses critical inquiry to challenge dogma and to reveal how seemingly fixed ideas are more arbitrary than we might think. Applying this philosophy, we see that social customs are not fixed laws but evolving conventions that serve a purpose in a particular culture and time. Marriage is one of these conventions. It is not a rigid law but a social custom that evolves.

In western traditions, there is widescale support for LGBT rights including the European Buddhist Union, the Buddhist Churches of America, many Shin Buddhist groups, and Zen leaders such as Thich Nhat Hanh, founder of the Plum Village Tradition. In a PEW research poll, 88% of American Buddhists stated that homosexuality should be accepted. This was a higher level of support than any other religious group studied. On 2012, the Australian branch of Buddhism voiced its support for same-sex marriage in a hearing of the Australian Parliament that sought to gather views on whether to legalize same-sex marriage.

<text>The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM) is a two-year, public residential high school with two physical campuses located in Durham, North Carolina, and Morganton, North Carolina, that focuses on the intensive study of science, mathematics and technology. It accepts rising juniors from across North Carolina and enrolls them through senior year. Although NCSSM is a public school, enrollment is extremely selective, and applicants undergo a competitive review process for admission. NCSSM is a founding member of the National Consortium of Secondary STEM Schools (NCSSS) and a constituent institution of the University of North Carolina system.

==History==
Since its inception in 1980, NCSSM has been fully funded by the state, allowing students to attend without paying any tuition, room, board, or other student fees. This funding is supplemented by the NCSSM Foundation&#x27;s private funding, which supports NCSSM&#x27;s academic, residential, and outreach programs as well as providing funds for some capital improvements. The Foundation has raised over $25 million in private support from corporations, foundations, alumni, parents and friends of NCSSM. A tuition fee was considered for the 2002–03 school year in the midst of a state budgetary crisis, but it was never implemented. In 2003, the NC Legislature approved a bill granting tuition costs for any university in the University of North Carolina System to all graduates of NCSSM, starting with the class of 2004, as an incentive to encourage NCSSM&#x27;s talented students to stay in North Carolina. That bill was amended in 2005 to allow students to use additional tuition monies awarded to cover &quot;costs of attendance.&quot; However, the tuition waiver was phased out in the Appropriations Act of 2009 in the North Carolina Senate in order to balance the budget. The bill states that &quot;No new recipients shall be funded after June 30, 2009.&quot;
The tuition grant was renewed retroactive for 2021 graduates in November 2021 in the Current Appropriations Act of 2021.

NCSSM served as a model for 18 similar schools, many of which are now members of the National Consortium of Secondary STEM Schools (NCSSS).

NCSSM has opened a second campus in Morganton, North Carolina opening for the 2022–23 school year. This campus houses approximately 300 students.

==Academics==
NCSSM students are not given a class rank and are encouraged to strive for their best rather than competing against other students. Although students previously were not given grade point averages (GPAs), the school has since changed their ways to provide GPAs on transcripts and simplify the college application process.

The school has done well in the national rankings for many years, including being listed as the 4th best public high school in the United States and the second best in North Carolina by Newsweek and being listed among The Washington Post&#x27;s 2014 &quot;top-performing schools with elite students.&quot;. In 2022, Niche deemed NCSSM the best public high school in the United States. Teachers at NCSSM have also won awards, with music instructor Phillip Riggs winning the Grammy Music Educator Award in 2016.

===Demographics===
During the 2013–2014 school year, NCSSM housed approximately 680 students. There were 346 seniors enrolled in the class of 2013. Currently, there are more females than males due to the larger number of female dormitory spaces. Approximately 56% of students are Caucasian, 26.6% are Asian American, 8.1% are African American, 5.5% are Hispanic, and 0.3% are Native American. The student population of NCSSM is designed to be a demographic reflection of the population of North Carolina as a whole; additionally, a certain number of slots are reserved for each congressional district.

==Academic achievement==
In 2018 the average SAT score was 1439 of 1600, the second highest in North Carolina. In 2019 it was also second highest in North Carolina, with 1437 of 1600.

==External programs==
NCSSM also offers a variety of external programs focused on educating teachers and students outside of the school across North Carolina. The school offers workshops for strengthening K–12 math and science education, focusing on &quot;teaching the teacher.&quot; These workshops focus particularly in science and mathematics education.

==Extracurricular activities==
NCSSM has a large variety of clubs and varsity sports, ranging from arts, academic, and ethnic culture clubs to intramural and varsity athletic programs. Students at NCSSM regularly excel in club competitions, academic events, and sports.

===Awards and recognition===
The school is known to place upwards of ten students a year in the Siemens Competition in Math, Science, and Technology. In 2006, Nicholas Tang and Sagar Indurkhya became national finalists in that year&#x27;s Siemens Competition. NCSSM also regularly produces semifinalists in the Intel Science Talent Search and Intel Science and Engineering Fair.

In 2008, the NCSSM team won first place in the WorldQuest geography competition at the national level.

In 2010, NCSSM won first place at the 2010 National DOE Science Bowl Competition, and the students on the team met Michelle Obama.

In 2015, the NCSSM Robotics Team, FIRST Robotics Team 900, The Zebracorns, came in 3rd place at the FIRST World Championship in Saint Louis.

In 2019, Navami Jain was selected as a finalist in the Regeneron Science Talent Search competition

In 2023 and 2024, 10 students were selected as Regeneron STS top 300 Finalists.

===Athletics===
The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics offers 21 varsity sports to its students, including baseball, volleyball, basketball, and wrestling.

In 2011, for the first time in this school&#x27;s history, all of the NCSSM varsity sports in the fall season won regional championships. Men&#x27;s cross-country and men&#x27;s soccer were state champions, while women&#x27;s tennis and women&#x27;s volleyball were state runners-up and a member of the women&#x27;s diving team placed second at the 1A/2A state meet. The NCSSM men&#x27;s cross-country team has won three straight state championships.

In the 2018–2019 season, NCSSM teams received nine Mid-State 2A conference titles. The school&#x27;s athletes were awarded 98 All-Conference titles in the 2018–2019 season, at least one in every sport offered by the school.

==Morganton Campus==

In 2006, the North Carolina General Assembly (NCGA) began planning to expand the Durham Campus to allow for greater enrollment and new curriculum opportunities. In 2013, the plan was expanded to look at other locations, and a study concluded that Morganton would be the new campus. The new campus made use of property at the North Carolina School for the Deaf (NCSD), where the student population had been declining and no longer needed the property or its buildings. The land and 4 buildings were transferred in September 2017. Renovation of the buildings and construction of two new buildings began on June 21, 2019.

The campus opened for the first class of residential students on August 10, 2022. It graduated its first class in May 2024.

<text>The World War II Memorial is a national memorial in the United States dedicated to Americans who served in the armed forces and as civilians during World War II. It is located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.

The memorial consists of 56 granite pillars, decorated with bronze laurel wreaths, representing U.S. states and territories, and a pair of small triumphal arches for the Atlantic and Pacific theaters, surrounding an oval plaza and fountain. On its short axis is a memorial wall of gold stars representing the fallen, and opposite, a sloped and stepped entrance plaza leading up to the oval from 17th Street. Its initial design was submitted by Austrian-American architect Friedrich St. Florian.

Opened on April 29, 2004, it replaced the Rainbow Pool at the eastern end of the Reflecting Pool, between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument. Dedicated by President George W. Bush on May 29, 2004, the memorial is administered by the National Park Service under its National Mall and Memorial Parks group. More than 4.6 million people visited the memorial in 2018.

==Overview==
The memorial consists of 56 granite pillars, each tall, arranged in a semicircle around a plaza with two triumphal arches on opposite sides. Two-thirds of the site is landscaping and water. Each pillar is inscribed with the name of one of the 48 U.S. states of 1945, as well as the District of Columbia, the Alaska Territory and Territory of Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The northern arch is inscribed with &quot;Atlantic&quot;; the southern one, &quot;Pacific.&quot; The plaza is long and wide, is sunk below grade, and contains a pool that is .

The memorial includes two inconspicuously located &quot;Kilroy was here&quot; engravings. Their inclusion in the memorial acknowledges the significance of the symbol to American soldiers during World War II and how it represented their presence and protection wherever it was inscribed.

On approaching the semicircle from the east, a visitor walks along one of two walls (right side wall and left side wall) picturing scenes of the war experience in bas relief. As one approaches on the left (toward the Pacific arch), the scenes begin with soon-to-be servicemen getting physical exams, taking the oath, and being issued military gear. The reliefs progress through several iconic scenes, including combat and burying the dead, ending in a homecoming scene. On the right-side wall (toward the Atlantic arch) there is a similar progression, but with scenes generally more typical of the European theatre. Some scenes take place in England, depicting the preparations for air and sea assaults. The last scene is of a handshake between the American and Russian armies when the western and eastern fronts met in Germany.

== Wall of stars ==

The Freedom Wall is on the west side of the plaza, with a view of the Reflecting Pool and Lincoln Memorial behind it. The wall has 4,048 gold stars, each representing 100 Americans who died in the war. In front of the wall lies the message &quot;Here we mark the price of freedom&quot;.

==History==
In 1987, World War II veteran Roger Durbin approached Representative Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Ohio, to ask if a World War II memorial could be constructed. Kaptur introduced the World War II Memorial Act to the House of Representatives as HR 3742 on December 10. The resolution authorized the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) to establish a World War II memorial in &quot;Washington, D.C., or its environs&quot;, but the bill was not voted on before the end of the session. In 1989 and 1991, Rep. Kaptur introduced similar legislation, but these bills suffered the same fate as the first and did not become law.

Kaptur reintroduced legislation in the House a fourth time as HR 682 on January 27, 1993, one day after Senator Strom Thurmond (a Republican from South Carolina) introduced companion Senate legislation. On March 17, 1993, the Senate approved the act, and the House approved an amended version of the bill on May 4. On May 12, the Senate also approved the amended bill, and the World War II Memorial Act was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on May 25 of that year, becoming .

===Fundraising===
On September 30, 1994, President Bill Clinton appointed a 12-member Memorial Advisory Board (MAB) to advise the ABMC in picking the site, designing the memorial, and raising money to build it. A direct mail fundraising effort brought in millions of dollars from individual Americans. Additional large donations were made by veterans&#x27; groups, including the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge. The majority of the corporate fundraising effort was led by co-chairmen Senator Bob Dole, a decorated World War II veteran and 1996 Republican nominee for president, and Frederick W. Smith, the president and chief executive officer of FedEx Corporation and a former U.S. Marine Corps officer. The U.S. federal government provided about $16 million; a total of $197 million was raised. Following his death in December 2021, Dole himself would have a memorial service held at the World War II Memorial.

===Picking the site===
On January 20, 1995, Colonel Kevin C. Kelley, project manager for the ABMC, organized the first meeting of the ABMC and the MAB, at which the project was discussed and initial plans made. The meeting was chaired by Commissioner F. Haydn Williams, chairman of ABMC&#x27;s World War II Memorial Site and Design Committee, who would go on to guide the project through the site selection and approval process and the selection and approval of the Memorial&#x27;s design. Representatives from the United States Commission of Fine Arts, the National Capital Planning Commission, the National Capital Memorial Commission, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the National Park Service attended the meeting. The selection of an appropriate site was taken on as the first action.

Over the next months, several sites were considered. Soon, 3 quickly gained favor:
* U.S. Capitol Reflection Pool area – between 3rd Street and the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial
* Constitution Gardens – east end, between Constitution Avenue and the Rainbow Pool
* Freedom Plaza – on Pennsylvania Avenue between 14th and 15th Streets

Other sites considered but quickly rejected were:
* Tidal Basin – northeast side, east of the Tidal Basin parking lot and west of the 14th Street Bridge access road
* West Potomac Park – between Ohio Drive and the north shore of the Potomac River, northwest of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial
* Grounds of the Washington Monument – at Constitution Avenue between 14th and 15th Streets, west of the National Museum of American History
* Henderson Hall, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery – dropped from consideration because of its unavailability

The selection of the Rainbow Pool site was announced on October 5, 1995. The design would incorporate the Rainbow Pool fountain, located across 17th Street from the Washington Monument and near the Constitution Gardens site.

The location, between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, is the most prominent spot for a monument on the National Mall since the Lincoln Memorial opened in 1922. It is the first addition in more than 70 years to the grand corridor of open space that stretches from the Capitol west to the Potomac River.

===Designing the memorial===
A nationwide design competition drew 400 submissions from architects from around the country. Friedrich St. Florian&#x27;s initial design was selected in 1997. St. Florian&#x27;s design evokes a classical monument. Under each of the two memorial arches, the Pacific and Atlantic baldachinos, four eagles carry an oak laurel wreath. Each of the 56 pillars bear wreaths of oak symbolizing military and industrial strength, and of wheat, symbolizing agricultural production.

Over the next four years, St. Florian&#x27;s design was altered during the review and approval process required of proposed memorials in Washington, D.C. Ambassador Haydn Williams guided the design development for ABMC.

==Construction==
Ground was broken in November 2000. The construction was managed by General Services Administration.

New England Stone Industries of Rhode Island was hired by the general contractor to fabricate the stone; it worked closely with St. Florian and the ABMC throughout the process. The triumphal arches were sub-contracted to and crafted by Rock of Ages Corporation. Sculptor Raymond Kaskey created the bronze eagles and two wreaths that were installed under the arches, as well as 24 bronze bas-relief panels that depict wartime scenes of combat and the home front. The bronzes were cast over the course of two and a half years at Laran Bronze in Chester, Pennsylvania. The stainless-steel armature that holds up the eagles and wreaths was designed at Laran, in part by sculptor James Peniston, and fabricated by Apex Piping of Newport, Delaware. The twin bronze wreaths decorating the 56 granite pillars around the perimeter of the memorial – as well as the 4,048 gold-plated silver stars representing American military deaths in the war – were cast at Valley Bronze in Joseph, Oregon. &quot;I&#x27;d see buckets full of the stars going through the foundry, and think that each stood for 100 men. The magnitude was overwhelming,&quot; Dave Jackman, former president of Valley Bronze, recalled in 2004.

The John Stevens Shop designed the lettering for the memorial and most of the inscriptions were hand-carved &quot;in situ&quot;.

The memorial opened to the public on April 29, 2004, and was dedicated in a May 29 ceremony attended by thousands of people. The memorial became a unit of the national park system on November 1, when authority over it was transferred to the National Park Service.
==Controversy==

===Criticism of the location===
Critics such as the National Coalition to Save Our Mall opposed the location of the memorial. A major criticism of the location was that it would interrupt what had been an unbroken view between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. The memorial was also criticized for taking up open space that had been historically used for major demonstrations and protests.

Critics were particularly bothered by the expedited approval process, which is considerably lengthy most of the time. The United States Congress, worried that World War II veterans were dying before an appropriate memorial could be built, passed legislation exempting the World War II Memorial from further site and design review. Congress also dismissed pending legal challenges to the memorial.

===Criticism of the design and style===
There were also aesthetic objections to the design. A critic from the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; described the monument as &quot;vainglorious, demanding of attention and full of trite imagery.&quot;
&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; argued that &quot;this pompous style was also favored by Hitler and Mussolini&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described it as &quot;overbearing&quot;, &quot;bombastic&quot;, and a &quot;hodgepodge of cliche and Soviet-style pomposity&quot; with &quot;the emotional impact of a slab of granite&quot;.

The monument was dismissed by one prominent architecture critic as &quot;knee-jerk historicism&quot;.

The design unveiled by President Bill Clinton included 50 columns honoring the 48 states of the Union during World War II and two of the eight non-state jurisdictions at the time of the war: the territories of Alaska and Hawaii that subsequently were admitted into the Union. On June 2, 1997, the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly approved a Concurrent Resolution requesting the addition of a column honoring the territory of Puerto Rico&#x27;s participation in the war effort. Its author, Sen. Kenneth McClintock, began a lobbying campaign. Eventually, the number of columns was raised to 56, honoring the 48 states, the District of Columbia, and the seven U.S. territories at the time: Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Philippines, and the United States Virgin Islands.

===FDR&#x27;s D-Day prayer===
On May 23, 2013, Senator Rob Portman introduced the World War II Memorial Prayer Act of 2013 (), which would direct the Secretary of the Interior to install at the World War II memorial a suitable plaque or an inscription with the words that President Franklin D. Roosevelt prayed with the United States on June 6, 1944, the morning of D-Day. The bill was opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Jewish Committee, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Hindu American Foundation, and the Interfaith Alliance. Together the organizations argued that the bill &quot;endorses the false notion that all veterans will be honored by a war memorial that includes a prayer proponents characterize as reflecting our country&#x27;s &#x27;Christian heritage and values.&#x27;&quot; The organizations argued that &quot;the memorial, as it currently stands, appropriately honors those who served and encompasses the entirety of the war&quot; and was carefully created, so no additional elements, such as FDR&#x27;s prayer, need to be added. But, they said, &quot;the effect of this bill, however, is to co-opt religion for political purposes, which harms the beliefs of everyone.&quot; The bill was signed into law on June 30, 2014, and the Commission of Fine Arts preferred a design at the Circle of Remembrance to the northwest of the memorial. With funding secured, it was initially intended to be dedicated on June 6, 2022, but was instead opened a year later on June 6, 2023 on the 79th anniversary of the Normandy landings.

<doc id="426016" wikidata="Q1155915" url="?curid=426016" title="Spoon (band)">
<text>Spoon is an American rock band from Austin, Texas, consisting of members Britt Daniel (vocals, guitar), Jim Eno (drums), Alex Fischel (keyboards, guitar), Gerardo Larios (guitar, keyboards) and Ben Trokan (bass, keyboards). The band was formed in Austin in October 1993 by Daniel and Eno. Critics have described the band&#x27;s musical style as rock and roll, post-punk, and art rock.

Spoon released their debut studio album, &quot;Telephono&quot;, in 1996 through Matador Records. Their next full-length album, &quot;A Series of Sneaks&quot;, was released in 1998 through Elektra Records. The band subsequently signed with Merge Records, where Spoon achieved greater commercial and critical prominence with the albums &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot; (2001), &quot;Kill the Moonlight&quot; (2002), &quot;Gimme Fiction&quot; (2005), &quot;Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga&quot; (2007), and &quot;Transference&quot; (2010). They signed with Loma Vista Recordings and ANTI- for the release of &quot;They Want My Soul&quot; (2014). The band later returned to Matador to release their ninth album &quot;Hot Thoughts&quot; (2017), and tenth album &quot;Lucifer on the Sofa&quot; (2022).

==History==

===1993–1997: Early years===
The band was formed in late 1993 by lead singer and guitarist Britt Daniel and drummer Jim Eno, after the two met as members of the Alien Beats. The name Spoon was chosen to honor the 1970s German krautrock band Can, whose hit song &quot;Spoon&quot; was the theme song to the 1985 movie &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; (&quot;Das Messer&quot;) in the United States.

Spoon&#x27;s first recording was the vinyl release of the EP &quot;Nefarious&quot; in May 1994. In 1995, the band signed with Matador Records, and Spoon released its first full-length LP &quot;Telephono&quot; in 1996. The album was met with mixed reviews, with critics comparing their sound to Pavement, Pixies and Wire. But comparisons aside, &quot;Telephono&quot; showed signs of a band slipping free of its influences, mixing post-punk with a blend of pop.

Less than a year later, Spoon released its second EP, &quot;Soft Effects&quot;, which served as a transition to their more distinctive, honed sound. Unlike its predecessors, &quot;Soft Effects&quot; was less noisy and brash, showcasing a more sophisticated, minimalist approach.

In late 1996, Spoon was playing a gig at the Argo in Denton, Texas with Ed Cooper and local band Maxine&#x27;s Radiator, which featured Josh Zarbo on bass. Zarbo was invited to audition for Daniel and Eno in 1997, and subsequently became the band&#x27;s full-time bassist until his permanent departure in 2007.

===1998–1999: Major label debut===
After the release of &quot;Soft Effects&quot;, Spoon signed to Elektra Records and released &quot;A Series of Sneaks&quot; in May 1998. The album did not sell as well as the label had hoped; merely four months after the release of &quot;Sneaks&quot;, Spoon&#x27;s Elektra A&amp;R contact Ron Laffitte quit his job and that week the band was dropped from the label. Angry with Laffitte, who had promised to stick with the band, Spoon recorded a vindictive yet humorously-titled two-song concept single entitled &quot;The Agony of Laffitte&quot;, which was released by Saddle Creek Records. They lamented their experience with the music business executive and questioned his motivations with the songs &quot;The Agony of Laffitte&quot; and &quot;Laffitte Don&#x27;t Fail Me Now&quot;.

===2000–2006: Signing with Merge Records===
Spoon signed with Merge Records and released the &quot;Love Ways&quot; EP in 2000. The decision was made to do this without bassist Josh Zarbo, who had briefly left the band. In 2001, Spoon released its third LP entitled &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot;. The new record was a success, selling more copies than both of their previous LP releases combined. The band&#x27;s next release in 2002, &quot;Kill the Moonlight&quot; had similar success. That album&#x27;s single &quot;The Way We Get By&quot; was popularized by its placement in the movie &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; (released later, in 2006), in an episode of the teen drama &quot;The O.C.&quot;, and on the first episode of the American version of the series &quot;Shameless&quot;. Their next album, &quot;Gimme Fiction&quot;, was released in May 2005, and debuted at number 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling more than 160,000 copies.

Daniel collaborated with Brian Reitzell to compose and arrange the soundtrack for the 2006 film &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;. The soundtrack consists chiefly of music performed by Spoon, and according to the liner notes of the official soundtrack, Reitzell collaborated with Britt Daniel to compose the score, while also adapting several tracks from &quot;Kill the Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Gimme Fiction&quot; into instrumental versions of the songs.

===2007–2012: &quot;Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga&quot; and &quot;Transference&quot;===
On July 10, 2007, &quot;Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga&quot; was released and debuted at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Since the release of &quot;Kill the Moonlight&quot; in 2002, Spoon has performed on the late night talk shows &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, as well as the PBS show &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;. They were also musical guests on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on October 6, 2007, where they performed &quot;The Underdog&quot; and &quot;You Got Yr. Cherry Bomb&quot;.

In 2009, the review aggregator Metacritic ranked Spoon as its &quot;Top overall artist of the decade&quot;, based on the band&#x27;s consistently high review scores between 2000 and 2009, among other factors. On January 18, 2010, the band released its seventh studio album, &quot;Transference&quot;. It debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 53,000 copies in its first week. Their song &quot;The Mystery Zone&quot; was also chosen as the Starbucks iTunes Pick of the Week on January 26, 2010. Later that year, Spoon recorded the title track on the album &quot;See My Friends&quot; in collaboration with Ray Davies.

On April 12, 2010, Spoon made a guest appearance on Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour in Eugene, Oregon, where they performed the song &quot;I Summon You&quot; from their album &quot;Gimme Fiction&quot;.

===2013–2016: &quot;They Want My Soul&quot;===
Spoon released their eighth LP, &quot;They Want My Soul&quot;, on August 5, 2014. It was their first record released by Loma Vista Recordings, after five records on Merge. It was recorded with Joe Chiccarelli and Dave Fridmann. That year they took part in the Hamilton, Ontario Supercrawl. Reviewing for Pitchfork, Ryan Dombal gave the album a rating of 8.6/10, writing: &quot;&quot;They Want My Soul&quot; is the quintet&#x27;s most booming LP, eons ahead of their Pixies-worshipping beginnings and a far cry from the relatively small-scale charm of their early-2000s touchstones &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot; and &quot;Kill the Moonlight&quot;, as well as their self-consciously lo-fi 2010 record, &quot;Transference&quot;.&quot; The album was also ranked as 13th of 50 in Pitchfork&#x27;s Best New Music of 2014.

On October 30, 2014, Spoon appeared as the featured musical guests during &quot;The Daily Show&quot;″s Democalypse 2014: South By South Mess.

===2017–2019: &quot;Hot Thoughts&quot; and &quot;Everything Hits at Once&quot;===
On March 17, 2017, Spoon released their ninth studio album &quot;Hot Thoughts&quot; on Matador Records, their first on the label since their 1996 debut (Matador had handled the European release of Gimme Fiction in 2005.)

In April 2019, the band made the news via Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who was filmed playing the band&#x27;s song &quot;The Way We Get By&quot; on piano before an event by his spokesperson, Lis Smith. The band responded by sharing the video on their Facebook and Twitter pages, remarking: &quot;So this guy can just do anyone&#x27;s job, huh.&quot;

In June 2019, the band announced the release of their greatest hits album, &quot;Everything Hits at Once: The Best of Spoon&quot;. The album compiles the band&#x27;s most well-known songs, as well as a new single entitled &quot;No Bullets Spent&quot;. The album was released on July 26 via Matador. On July 9, Rob Pope announced he would be leaving the band. On August 29, 2020, for Record Store Day, the band released &quot;All the Weird Kids Up Front (Más Rolas Chidas)&quot;, a fan-selected companion piece to their best of, with a tracklist submitted and voted on by fans.

===2021–present: &quot;Lucifer on the Sofa&quot;===
Spoon began recording their tenth studio album in late 2018 at drummer Jim Eno&#x27;s studio with producers Mark Rankin and Justin Raisen. It was nearly finished as of early 2020, but was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the new release date tentatively set for early 2021. On March 12, 2021, Spoon released covers of two Tom Petty songs, &quot;Breakdown&quot; and &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot;. On October 28, 2021, the band announced their tenth studio album, &quot;Lucifer on the Sofa&quot; with lead single &quot;The Hardest Cut&quot; being released on the same day. The second single from &quot;Lucifer on the Sofa&quot;, &quot;Wild&quot;, was released as a 7-inch single on December 10, 2021. The song was backed with a remix by Dennis Bovell on the B-side. The album was released on February 11, 2022, via Matador.

On September 21, 2022, Spoon announced &quot;Lucifer on the Moon&quot;, a track-by-track reworking of &quot;Lucifer on the Sofa&quot;, with all remixes by Adrian Sherwood. The album was released on November 4, 2022.

In November 2022, the album was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, which marked the band&#x27;s first Grammys nomination.

In May 2023, Spoon announced the &quot;Memory Dust&quot; EP.

<doc id="426023" wikidata="Q485131" url="?curid=426023" title="Queen Seondeok of Silla">
<text>Queen Seondeok ( ; ? – ; day of the lunar month of the year of Inpyeong []) reigned as Queen Regnant of Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, from 632 to 647. She was Silla&#x27;s twenty-seventh ruler, and its first reigning queen. She was the second female sovereign in recorded East Asian history and encouraged a renaissance in thought, literature, and the arts in Silla.
In the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Queen Seondeok was described as &quot;generous, benevolent, wise, and smart&quot;. According to the Legend of Jigwi, she was also beautiful. She developed Buddhist culture, selected great talent, and established diplomacy with the Tang dynasty, laying the foundation for the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Queen Seondeok is known as a wise and kind monarch, making her one of the most prominent monarchs in Korean history.

== Titles ==
In texts, Queen Seondeok is indicated not only as &quot;Seondeok yeowang&quot; (), but also as &quot;Seondeok wang&quot; (), &quot;Seondeok yeodaewang&quot; () and &quot;Seongjohwanggo&quot; ().
* &quot;Yeowang&quot; () – &quot;Yeowang&quot; (&quot;female king&quot;) is the title of queen regnant in Korean. Because there is no feminine equivalent to king and emperor in East Asian languages, different titles are used for female monarchs and female consorts.
* &quot;Wang&quot; () – Unlike European languages, in East Asia, the titles of female monarchs can also be abbreviated as &quot;king&quot; or &quot;emperor&quot;, much like their male counterparts. However, to avoid confusion with male monarchs, they are usually referred to as &quot;female king&quot; or &quot;female emperor&quot;.
* &quot;Yeodaewang&quot; () – It is a combination of &quot;yeowang&quot; (&quot;female king&quot;) and &quot;daewang&quot; (). In the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, she is also called &quot;Seondeok yeodaewang&quot; (), meaning Great Queen (Regnant) Seondeok.
* &quot;Seongjohwanggo&quot; () – The title given to Queen Seondeok when she ascended the throne was &quot;Seongjohwanggo&quot;, also spelled &quot;Sŏngjohwanggo&quot;. It means Empress descended from divine ancestors. This is one of the cases in which Silla used the title of emperor/empress as well as the title of king/queen. (See Emperor at home, king abroad for more information.)

==Succession to the throne==
Born Princess Deokman (), Seondeok was the daughter of King Jinpyeong and Queen Maya of Silla. She had two siblings, Princess Cheonmyeong and Princess Seonhwa (although Seonhwa&#x27;s existence is controversial due to the discovery of evidence in 2009 that points to King Uija&#x27;s mother as being Queen Sataek and not Seonhwa as indicated by historical records). It is uncertain whether she or Cheonmyeong was the first born. According to the disputed text &quot;Hwarang Segi&quot;, Cheonmyeong was older than Seondeok. According to the historical text &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Seondeok was the eldest daughter.

According to the disputed text &quot;Hwarang Segi&quot;, because King Jinpyeong had no son whom he could pass the crown to, he began to consider his son-in-law, Kim Yongsu (husband of Princess Cheonmyeong) as his successor - after recognizing his achievements for the country. When Princess Deokman heard of it, she made a plea to her father, asking him to give her a chance to compete for the throne, insisting that she too had the right to compete for the throne as much as Kim Yongsu had. Seeing her determination, the King gave her the chance to prove herself worthy of the throne. Although it was not unusual for women to wield power in Silla (Queen Sado also served as a regent for King Jinpyeong), the thought of having a female ruler sitting on the throne was still unacceptable for most of them. Therefore, Princess Deokman had to prove herself in order to gain the trust and support of her people. Eventually, she succeeded, and was named as King Jinpyeong&#x27;s successor. But this story is not mentioned in the historical texts &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; and &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;. According to the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, the reason Seondeok became a female monarch was just because there was no male &quot;Seonggol&quot; of Bone-rank system.

The decision was not accepted by everyone, and as a result; some officials planned an uprising in order to stop her from being crowned. On May of 631, Ichan Chilsuk () and Achan Seokpum () planned a rebellion. But, their plan was discovered and suppressed early on. As punishment, Chilsuk was beheaded in the market place along with his entire family. Seokpum was able to escape and ran to the Baekje border. However, he missed his wife and decided to return after exchanging clothes with a woodcutter. Upon his return, he was arrested by soldiers waiting for him at his home, and was later executed.

==Reign==

In January 632, Queen Seondeok became the first queen regnant of Silla. As a ruler, Queen Seondeok&#x27;s primary concern was the livelihood of her people. Right after she was crowned, she appeased her people by telling them what her policies would be. She sent royal inspectors throughout the kingdom to improve the care of widows, widowers, orphans, the poor, and the elderly. During that same year, she sent a diplomat to pay tribute to the Emperor of the Tang dynasty of China, and inform him about Silla&#x27;s new ruler. However, Emperor Taizong of Tang refused to acknowledge Seondeok as a ruler because she was a woman.

In the second year of Queen Seondeok&#x27;s reign, Cheomseongdae, an astronomical observatory, was built to help the farmers. She also announced a whole year of tax exemption for the peasants and reduced the tax for the middle class, and through this act of kindness, the queen won the people&#x27;s support and her position was strengthened against the opposition of the male aristocracy. In June of the same year, Queen Seondeok sent a diplomat to pay nominal tribute to the Tang Emperor again; however, Emperor Taizong still refused to acknowledge her as a ruler but Seondeok was unfazed as Korean rulers of Korean dynasties have always seen themselves as equal to the rulers of Chinese dynasties.

According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, in March, 636, the queen became ill and no amount of prayers and medicine worked. In March, 638, a large stone on the south side of the mountain moved on its own, and seven months later, Goguryeo attacked the mountain valley. The next year, the sea water on the eastern part of the Silla kingdom turned red, which caused all of the fish living in it to die. These events made the people anxious, and some of them considered them as bad omens portending the Silla kingdom&#x27;s downfall.

In 642, Uija of Baekje personally led a campaign against Silla, and conquered 40 fortresses in the western part of Silla. General Yunchung conquered the strategically important Daeya Fortress with 10,000 men and executed the daughter and son-in-law of Kim Chunchu. In 643, Baekje and Goguryeo conquered Danghang Fortress, blocking an important sea route to the Tang dynasty. Because of this, Queen Seondeok sent a diplomat to the Emperor of Tang and asked for assistance. The Emperor gave her three proposals. First, he would attack the Liaodong Peninsula and carry out a naval campaign on the west to occupy the Baekje. Second, the emperor would provide thousands of Tang uniforms and army flags in order to help Silla soldiers disguise themselves as Chinese troops. Third, he would send a male royal of Tang descent to serve as a new king of Silla, as, according to him, Silla faced constant threat because their enemies did not fear them due to their having a female ruler. The diplomat returned to Silla, unable to tell the Queen of the proposals that the Tang Emperor had offered.

At that point of crisis, Queen Seondeok sent for the well known Buddhist monk, Jajang, who had been studying under the great Buddhist masters of the Tang dynasty for seven years. Monk Jajang returned to Silla in 643. He advised the queen and her counselors to build the great nine-story pagoda for the dual purpose of blocking foreign invasions and calming her people. After careful consideration, the queen decided to accept Jajang&#x27;s proposal, seeing it as necessary to overcome the crisis that they were facing at that time. However, during her meeting with her royal subjects, she learned that they were strongly against it due to concern for the state of the royal treasury, knowing that the construction of the pagoda would bring a heavy tax burden on her people. But the queen still decided to continue with the plan with the firm belief that a work of religious devotion would bring her people together and show her people that Silla was still far from ruin. She told her royal subjects to &quot;tear down her palace and use its bricks and timbers, if they think they lack the funds&quot;. After two years, the pagoda was finally completed; it was called Hwangnyongsa (meaning &quot;Imperial Dragon Temple&quot;) and was considered the tallest temple in East Asia at that time. During that same year, Queen Seondeok appointed a nobleman named Bidam to the highest position in the court (Sangdaedeung).

During the reign of Queen Seondeok, the first foundation for unifying the three Kingdoms under Silla was laid. A series of attacks and raids by the combined forces of Baekje and Goguryeo had brought the kingdom to a point of crisis. The queen decided to form an alliance with the Tang dynasty. She was ridiculed at first; however, after seeing the growing strength of Goguryeo, the Emperor of Tang, finally accepted her offer.

===Bidam&#x27;s rebellion ===

On February 8, 647 (January 8, lunar calendar), Queen Seondeok faced her greatest challenge when several of her highest officials started a rebellion against her. They were led by Bidam, who asserted that: &quot;The female king failed to rule the country, therefore women should stop ruling&quot;. Bidam had strong political influence in the court, and thus created the biggest rebellion in Silla&#x27;s history. Since most of the army had been sent to different parts of the Silla kingdom to defend it from potential foreign invasions, the rebellion was a great threat.

According to a famous anecdote about Bidam&#x27;s rebellion, on the night of Bidam&#x27;s rebellion, Queen Seondeok&#x27;s health had deteriorated sharply due to illness, and a star fell near the Queen&#x27;s residence. Bidam, who saw the star, claimed it was a sign of the queen&#x27;s impending downfall, to encourage his superstitious followers. The queen, who heard of the event, became fearful and anxious, but Kim Yushin calmed her by telling her not to worry, for he had a plan to suppress the rebellion. He then flew a huge kite with a burning scarecrow attached to it, to make it appear that the star was back in its place. Bidam&#x27;s followers saw this, and became greatly discouraged.

The rebellion was eventually suppressed by Kim Yu-sin and Kim Alcheon. According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Bidam and his thirty followers were executed on February 17, 647 (lunar calendar). The rebellion therefore lasted for fewer than 10 days, and failed in its goal to overthrow the government of Queen Seondeok.

=== Death ===
Queen Seondeok died on February 20, 647 (January 8, 647 in the lunar calendar) shortly before Bidam&#x27;s rebellion was completely suppressed. There is no known record identifying the exact cause of her death, but Queen Seondeok was known to have had an unspecified illness shortly prior to her death, and this illness is most commonly theorized as the cause of her death. Some historians state it is also possible she died partly out of shock that Bidam had instigated a rebellion against her. Queen Seondeok was buried in a tomb on Nangsan, one of the sacred mountains in Gyeongju. After Queen Seondeok&#x27;s death, her cousin was then named as the next female ruler of Silla, and became Queen Jindeok.

===Buddhism and astrology===
Like her father, Queen Seondeok was drawn to Buddhism. Silla built many temples, pagodas, and Buddha statues during her reign. One of the famous temples that was built during her time was the temple of Hwangnyongsa. According to ancient architectural records, the pagoda was 68 or 80 meters in height, making it one of the tallest structures in East Asia at the time. The pagoda represented the earnest wish of Queen Seondeok and the Silla people, to protect the country and bring the three kingdoms of Korea under one ruler. It was an offering to the Buddha, in hope that these wishes would be fulfilled. The queen often visited the Hwangnyongsa temple to pray for the wisdom and strength to save Silla from danger.

Bunhwangsa, Oseam, Sangwonsa, , Tongdosa, Woljeongsa, Baekdamsa, and Magoksa were built during her reign. She also built the &quot;Star-Gazing Tower,&quot; or Cheomseongdae, considered the first dedicated observatory in the Far East, which helped farmers at that time. The tower still stands in the old Silla capital of Gyeongju, South Korea and is the oldest surviving observatory in East Asia.

==Husbands==
According to Hwarang Segi, Queen Seondeok had three husbands.

1. Kim Yongchun, a child of King Jinji and Princess Cheonmyeong&#x27;s brother-in-law. He served as an official during King Jinpyeong&#x27;s reign and served as a Sangdaedeung for Queen Seondeok. Supposedly King Jinpyeong ordered Kim Yong Chun to become Princess Deokman&#x27;s consort, in hope that a son would be born, so that the kingdom would not be entrusted to a woman. When they failed to conceive a child, Kim Yong Chun asked the king to allow him to retire as Princess Deokman&#x27;s consort. The king agreed to his request, but asked him to assist Princess Deokman once she took over the throne. He went on to marry Princess Cheonmyeong in order to fulfill his brother&#x27;s dying wish.

2. : served as an official during King Jinpyeong&#x27;s reign and as a Sangdaedeung for Queen Seondeok.

3. : was said to be one of King Jinpyeong&#x27;s brothers.

According to the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, she married .

According to tradition, she was married to the clan founder Jo Gye-ryong.

However, it is widely believed that she did not let herself be wed in order to avoid political conflicts, hence the next female rulers after her (Queen Jindeok and Queen Jinseong) were not married either.

==Legends==
===Peony flowers and painting===

This story is recorded in the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;.

Emperor Taizong of China once sent the queen a painting of three peony flowers in red, purple and white, along with its actual seeds. When the queen had the seeds planted in her garden, she made a remark that &quot;even though the flower was pretty, it probably does not have much fragrance&quot;. Her words were then proven to be correct when the flowers bloomed, wilted and died, without giving off any scent. People were surprised that she had known of it, and asked her about it. She explained it thus: &quot;The painting showed no butterfly or bees beside the flowers. When he sent me this gift, Emperor Taizong was mocking me for not having a husband.&quot;

The peony flower does not have any scent, which is why butterflies were not interested on it — implying the reason why she did not have a husband was probably because no man was interested on her (not being married was seen as something negative for one&#x27;s character and status during those days). It is said that the temple Bunhwangsa (Fragrance of the Royal Temple) was built as a response to the mockery.

Another version of that story tells that when Queen Seondeok was seven years old, her father King Jinpyeong received a box of peony seeds and a peony painting sent by Emperor Taizong of Tang. When she saw the painting, she commented that even though the flowers are pretty, it must not have much fragrance because no butterflies or bees were around them. Peonies, therefore, are equated with her wisdom and insight.

===The Legend of Jigwi===
The Legend of Jigwi is recorded in .

A man named , who lived near the border of Goguryeo, went to Seorabeol and saw the queen who was passing by while on a visit to the capital city. He fell in love with her despite their difference in age and social status. He stopped eating and sleeping and did nothing but call out the queen&#x27;s name all day, eventually losing his mind.

One day, Queen Seondeok went to visit a Buddhist temple to pray. As she was passing by, Jigwi appeared while calling out the queen&#x27;s name as usual. The queen&#x27;s guard thrust him aside, causing a commotion. When the queen asked one of her attendants about the commotion, she was told of his story and took pity on him, and allowed him to follow her retinue to the temple. While the queen was praying inside the temple, Jigwi had to wait outside while sitting underneath a pagoda, where he fell asleep. When the queen finally emerged, she noticed Jigwi who was sleeping behind the pagoda. She asked her attendants not to disturb the sleeping man, but placed her bracelet on Jigwi&#x27;s chest as a keepsake. When Jigwi woke up and saw the bracelet that she had left for him, he was so overwhelmed with joy and love for the queen, that his whole body turned into a fire. The fierce flames of his love burned down the pagoda and Jigwi himself. Some versions of the legend tell that Jigwi burned down himself and the temple to express his burning passion for the queen.

In another version of the story, Jigwi was beaten by the palace guards for calling out the queen&#x27;s name every day until he could no longer move. His soul became a fire spirit and burned down the pagoda and people&#x27;s houses. The people who were scared of Jigwi&#x27;s wrath asked the Queen for help, so she made a talisman for them to put in front of their houses to block away Jigwi&#x27;s fire spirit.

In a modern version of the story. Jigwi fell in love with Queen Seondeok, whom he met every night through her dream. In her dream, he appears as a handsome Hwarang, who gave her predictions and solutions for the crises she faced as a ruler. Through Jigwi&#x27;s assistance, Queen Seondeok overcame many problems. They met each other in a bridge in her dream, but suddenly Jigwi stopped appearing in her dreams. The queen started to wonder what happened to the man in her dreams and started to miss him and so she went to the bridge where they used to meet in her dreams. But Jigwi was nowhere to be found, and instead, the one she saw was a sleeping beggar. The queen did not recognize him as the same man who appeared in her dream but still, she decided to leave her bracelet on the chest of the sleeping man. When Jigwi woke up, he was overwhelmed with love and longing for the queen, that his heart turned into a fire that spread through his whole body. The fire flew to heaven and then rain started to fall, which ended the drought in Silla.

===Croaking Frogs and Jade Gate===
This story is recorded in the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;.

Near the banks of the Seongjin river in the capital city, there was a temple called Yeongmyosa. In the temple grounds was a pond named Okmun (&quot;Jade Gate&quot;). On a certain day in winter, five years into her reign, frogs gathered together at the pond and began to croak loudly for several days. When this strange phenomenon was reported to the queen, she immediately ordered two of her generals to lead 2,000 of her best soldiers to the western suburb of the city, and to look for a valley named Yeogeungok (&quot;Cradle of Life&quot;). She added that an enemy force would be found there lying in wait, which they would be sure to take by surprise. The two generals led their armies to the valley the queen had mentioned, near Mt. Bu, and destroyed not only the detachment of 500 Baekje soldiers they found there, but also a force of 1,200 reinforcements which came later to aid them.

When asked how she had foreseen the Baekje invasion simply because of the croaking of frogs. The queen explained, &quot;A group of angry frogs signifies an army. Jade Gate is an expression for a woman&#x27;s chastity. &quot;Woman&quot; is one of the meanings of Yin, which also has the meaning of white, and the white color stands for the West. So I knew that an army was lying in the West. As we say, a man is supposed in some sense to die during the act of creating new life. Since the Baekje army was hiding in the valley known as the Cradle of Life, I knew that it would be easy to defeat them.&quot; This shows that the queen was well-versed in the philosophy of Yin and Yang, and interpreted all the icons correctly. It is also remarkable to see the queen&#x27;s reference to the symbolic &quot;death&quot; of the male during the act of love. The fact that the queen openly dealt with the topic in front of her male courtiers also showed her boldness.

=== Burial near the Doricheon ===

This story is recorded in the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;.

Some days before she died, Seondeok gathered her officials and gave the order &quot;When I die, bury me near the Doricheon (, &quot;Heaven of Grieved Merits&quot;)&quot; which in Buddhism refers to a certain level of Heaven. When asked where the Doricheon was, she replied that it was on the southern side of Mt. Namsan. Decades after her death, the thirtieth king Munmu of Silla constructed Sacheonwang-sa (, &quot;Temple of the Four Heavenly Kings&quot;) in her tomb. Then the nobles realized that one of the Buddha&#x27;s sayings, &quot;Dori-cheon is above the Sacheonwang-cheon&quot;, was accomplished by the queen. However, rather than prediction, some historians think of it as her last wish: having suffered so much jealousy and prejudice for being a woman during her reign, this may have been her way to show her desire to be reincarnated as a man in Doricheon in her next life.

==1990 Democratic revolution&#x27;s foundation==
With the changes taking place internationally in the communist world, in particular in the Soviet Union, which had sheltered and led Mongolia; young people in Mongolia wanted to make a change in the society and the way the government was running its business. In addition, Mongolia suffered economic hardships from as early as the 1980s. The young people began to meet secretly and discuss it. For example, during his studies in the USSR, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj learned about Glasnost, the concepts such as freedom of speech and economic liberties. After returning to Mongolia, he met other like-minded people and tried to present those ideas to a wider audience, despite attempts of repression from the Politburo-authority of the government, and threats by his employer to lose his job.

In October 1989, New Generation, an underground resistance movement was formed.

On 28 November 1989, at the end of a speech at the Young Artists&#x27; Second National Congress, Elbegdorj said that Mongolia needed democracy and appealed for youth to collaborate to create democracy in Mongolia. He told the audience &quot;We consider that Perestroika is a timely and brave step. Youth&#x27;s contribution to this revolutionary matter is not by supportive talks but by certain work. Our contribution is our objectives to be fulfilled. Our objectives are: ... following democracy and transparency and contributing to glasnost, ... and supporting fair progressive power ... These are the objectives of an initiatives&#x27; group-an organization that shall work. After the congress I hope we will gather and discuss with you about it in this (newly forming group). The organization shall be based on public, voluntary and democratic principles.&quot;

The chairman of the congress stopped Elbegdorj&#x27;s speech and warned him not to say such things. It was 1989 and Mongolia had been a communist country for 68 years. At that time, it was alleged that every other person was an unofficial communist party spy who would report people who expressed opinions other than socialism and communism. During the break of the congress, two young individuals met Elbegdorj and the three agreed to found a democratic movement and to secretly spread the news to other young people. Later the three met and united with ten other individuals and they are known as the Thirteen Leaders of Mongolia&#x27;s Democratic Revolution. On his return from the congress, his boss at the newspaper &quot;Ulaan Od&quot; warned Elbegdorj that he would be fired if he participated further in any activities out of work or engaged in any conduct inconsistent with communist and socialist ideology. Despite the warning, Elbegdorj and his friends met secretly with other young people in the circle auditorium of the National University of Mongolia and discussed democracy, free market economic policy, and other prohibited subjects of the time, and began to draft a plan to organize a democratic movement. They met many times and brought new friends and new supporters to join them secretly. One night they placed ads of their open demonstration in streets.

On 9 December, people from New Generation met students, journalists and others to set up an open organization calling for drastic reform. The group called itself Mongolian Democratic Union.

==Democratic revolution==
On the morning of 10 December 1989, the first open pro-democracy demonstration met in front of the Youth Cultural Center in Ulaanbaatar. There, Elbegdorj announced the creation of the Mongolian Democratic Union (MDU). At the demonstration, the MDU founders publicly petitioned the government for a real implementation of Perestroika, allowing a multi-party system, and the total implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in all party and government affairs.

In subsequent months the activists led by 13 democracy leaders including Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, Sanjaasürengiin Zorig, Erdeniin Bat-Üül, Bat-Erdeniin Batbayar and others continued to organize demonstrations, rallies, protests and hunger strikes, as well as teachers&#x27; and workers&#x27; strikes. The activists had growing support from Mongolians, both in the capital and the countryside and the union&#x27;s activities led to other calls for democracy all over the country.

On 2 January 1990, Mongolian Democratic Union began distributing leaflets calling for a democratic revolution. When the government did not comply with this and later, more aggressive demands, demonstrations occurred. On January 14, 1990, some 1000 protesters met on square in front of Lenin Museum which has been renamed as Freedom Square since then in Ulaanbaatar. A demonstration on Sükhbaatar Square on 21 January (in weather of -30 C) followed. Protestors carried banners alluding to Chinggis Khaan (also referred to Genghis Khan), rehabilitating a figure which Soviet schooling neglected to praise. They celebrated Daramyn Tömör-Ochir, a politician who was purged from the MPRP in 1962 as part of the MPRP&#x27;s efforts to suppress the commemoration of the 800th anniversary of Genghis Khan&#x27;s birth. And the rebels carried a modified Flag of Mongolia which lacked a star symbolizing socialism; this flag would become the new flag after the revolution.

After numerous demonstrations of many thousands of people in the capital city as well as provincial centers, on 4 March 1990, the MDU and three other reform organizations held a joint outdoor mass meeting, inviting the government to attend. The government sent no representative to what became a demonstration of over 100,000 people demanding democratic change. Ten members of the organizations began a hunger strike on 7 March, the next day, Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party(MPRP) (present Mongolian People&#x27;s Party)&#x27;s Politburo – the authority of the government eventually gave way to the pressure and entered negotiations with the leaders of the democratic movement Mongolian Democratic Union. Jambyn Batmönkh, chairman of Politburo of MPRP&#x27;s Central Committee decided to dissolve the Politburo and to resign on 9 March 1990. This paved the way for the first multi-party elections in Mongolia.

Behind the scenes, however, the MPRP had seriously considered cracking down on the protesters, writing a decree that was left to be signed by the party leader Jambyn Batmönkh. Batmönkh opposed it, maintaining a strict policy of never using force (). People those were present there later recalled that Batmönkh said &quot;I will never sign this. We few Mongols have not yet come to the point that we will make each other&#x27;s noses bleed,&quot; smacked the table, and left the room.&quot;

Elbegdorj announced the news of the Politburo resignation to the hunger strikers and to people who&#x27;d gathered on Sükhbaatar Square at 10PM on that day after the negotiations between leaders of MPRP and Mongolian Democratic Union. Then the hunger strike stopped.

In April, the conflict worsened, with the government restricting the freedom of assembly and the democracy leaders submitting an ultimatum demanding equal participation of all political groups. The Communist party refused to accede to the demands. However, in May, under pressure and after negotiations with members of the opposition movement, the People&#x27;s Great Hural approved the Law on Political Parties.

==Multi-party system==
Following the collapse of the Communist regime, Mongolia&#x27;s first free, multi-party elections for a bicameral parliament were held on July 29, 1990. Parties ran for 430 seats in the Great Hural, with opposition parties not able to nominate enough candidates. The Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party MPRP won 357 seats, an 83% majority. It also received a majority in the Small Hural (which was later abolished), winning 31 out of 53. The State Great Hural (upper house) first met on 3 September and elected a president (MPRP), vice president (Social Democrat), prime minister (MPRP), and 50 members to the Baga Hural (lower house). The vice president was also chairman of the Baga Hural. In November 1991, the People&#x27;s Great Hural (Parliament) began discussion on a new constitution, which entered into force on 12 February 1992. In addition to establishing Mongolia as an independent, sovereign republic and guaranteeing a number of rights and freedoms, the new constitution restructured the legislative branch of government, creating a unicameral legislature, the State Great Hural (SGH).

Nonetheless, the new MPRP government under Dashiin Byambasüren shared power with the democrats, and implemented constitutional and economic reforms, with a new constitution being adopted in 1992. In early and mid-1990s, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had until 1990 provided significant economic aid to Mongolia&#x27;s state budget, the country experienced harsh economic problems as early as the 1980s. Foreign trade broke down, economic and technical aid from the former socialist countries ended, and domestic economy was struggling with privatization. Inflation rose, stores&#x27; shelves were depleted, ration cards for food were issued for a period of time. A thriving black market arose in Ulaanbaatar by 1988 to accommodate the needs of the populace.

==New governance in democracy==
The constitution was amended in 1992. In the same year, the MPRP won another round of parliamentary elections. The new constitution also provided that the president would be elected by popular vote rather than by the legislature as before. Incumbent Punsalmaagin Ochirbat became Mongolia&#x27;s first universally elected president winning the 1993 Mongolian presidential election with two thirds of the vote. Originally an MPRP member, Ochirbat ran as the candidate of the democratic opposition, after the MPRP had nominated an orthodox communist as their candidate. The MPRP was defeated for the first time in its history.

In 1996 Mongolian parliamentary elections, the Democratic Union won the legislative elections for the first time co-led by Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj as the chairman of Democratic Party. The MPRP lost the majority for the first time. 
MPRP candidate Natsagiin Bagabandi became elected as president in 1997, and re-elected in 2001.

In parliamentary elections of 2000, 2004, and 2008, the MPRP won the legislative elections and was the ruling party between these periods. 2004 election results forced the MPRP to join a coalition government with the Motherland Democratic Coalition, a coalition of the Democratic Party (Mongolia), the Civic Will Party, and the Motherland Party. The MPRP left the coalition in January 2006, however, proceeded to create a government on its own. Another government reshuffle took place at the end of 2007, when the MPRP decided to replace its prime minister Miyeegombyn Enkhbold with Sanjaagiin Bayar. MPRP formed a coalition government with the Democratic Party in 2008 also, although the MPRP won the majority being blamed for vote rigging and followed riots.

In 2009 Mongolian Presidential election, Democratic Party candidate Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj defeated MPRP candidate incumbent President Nambaryn Enkhbayar. In January 2012, Democratic Party made a decision to leave the coalition government before upcoming parliamentary elections in June. Following Democratic Party&#x27;s victory in 2009 Presidential election, in 2012 Parliamentary elections Democratic Party won. In 2012 local elections of the capital city, provinces, districts Mongolian People&#x27;s Party (former MPRP) was defeated for the first time in the country&#x27;s history. In 2013 Mongolian Presidential election, Democratic Party candidate incumbent President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj won. Thus the Democratic Party stemming from Mongolian Democratic Union-the pro-democracy activists has been on the power of Mongolia&#x27;s presidency, parliament and government since 2012.

MPP won a landslide victory both 2016 and 2020 election. However, before the 2020 election, the ruling party had redrawn the electoral map in a way beneficial to MPP: After Prime Minister Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh of MPP, in office since 2016, had resigned after protests over the treatment of a coronavirus patient, Luvsannamsrai Oyun-Erdeneo of MPP became new prime minister on 27 January 2021. He represented a younger generation of leaders that had studied abroad., Khaltmaa Battulga, the candidate of opposition Democratic party, was President of Mongolia since 2017 until 2021, after winning the presidential election. In June 2021, former Prime Minister Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh, candidate of the ruling Mongolian People&#x27;s Party (MPP), became the country&#x27;s sixth democratically elected president with a landslide election victory.

<doc id="426031" wikidata="Q5469425" url="?curid=426031" title="Forever My Lady">
<text>Forever My Lady is the debut studio album by American R&amp;B quartet Jodeci, released May 28, 1991, by Uptown Records and MCA Records.

==Background==
The album&#x27;s production and composition was largely attributed to DeVante Swing, who worked alongside Grammy-nominated producer Al B. Sure! to craft the album&#x27;s sound. The recording sessions took place at various recording studios during 1990 to 1991, and were relentlessly worked upon in order to shift the consensus with R&amp;B music. The duo worked to add more of a hip-hop sound to the album, incorporating synthesizer-heavy rhythm tracks to complement the alternating themes discussed throughout the album, ranging from passionate and elegant songs about love, to energetic and swaggering songs centered around sex and partying. The group&#x27;s emotionally transparent lyrics are delivered in both rapped and sung verses, help to explore the feelings of love and seduction.

==Release and reception==
The album received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, who complimented the group&#x27;s innovative nature when approaching the album, as well as its thematic choices and the production from Swing. Following an anticipated release, it debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B Albums chart in its first week, and peaked at eighteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Three of the album&#x27;s singles charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including the top-15 hit &quot;Come and Talk to Me&quot;. &quot;Forever My Lady&quot; was certified multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and, as of August 1995, has sold over three million copies in the US and over eight million copies worldwide.

Arion Berger of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the effort a good review, calling the work &quot;sophisticated beyond the band members&#x27; years&quot; and noting that &quot;if they can keep up the momentum of this commercially successful debut (which has already gone Top 40 on the Billboard pop album chart), Jodeci will be a force to be reckoned with.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Dennis Hunt was less impressed, writing that &quot;the singing is so-so but the production is outstanding.&quot;

All tracks are somewhat produced by DeVante Swing, except where noted.

<doc id="426037" wikidata="Q3141714" url="?curid=426037" title="Venus Hum">
<text>Venus Hum is an electronic pop music group from Nashville, Tennessee, consisting of vocalist Annette Strean and multi-instrumentalists Kip Kubin and Tony Miracle. Miracle has a rare heart condition which results in perpetually hearing his own heartbeat in his ears. This condition is known as &quot;venous hum&quot;, from which the group&#x27;s name is derived.

Their first full-length album, titled &quot;Venus Hum&quot;, was released in 2001. &quot;Big Beautiful Sky&quot; was released two years later. Also in 2003, Venus Hum toured with and opened for Blue Man Group, with Strean providing vocals on &quot;I Feel Love&quot;.

After their collaboration with J. J. Abrams (&quot;Alias&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;&quot;), and their subsequent creation of the EP &quot;Songs for Superheroes&quot;, it was uncertain whether Venus Hum would release any new material. Strean had developed painful vocal fold nodules and needed a speech pathologist to relearn her singing ability. Kip diversified, furthering his interest in filmmaking, becoming a director of music videos, electronic press kits and special features. Tony traveled, living in Los Angeles and Cincinnati and releasing an experimental solo album under the moniker &quot;Satellite City&quot;.

After a two-year hiatus, the group reorganized and released a new album, &quot;The Colors in the Wheel&quot; on July 25, 2006, under the Mono-Fi Records label, which they described as &quot;unconventional, three-dimensional and completely five-sensual&quot; featuring an edgier sound than their previous work.

In the second half of 2008, Venus Hum returned to the studio to work on material for a new album, culminating in the October 6th, 2009 release of &quot;Mechanics &amp; Mathematics&quot;. &quot;Best Remodeled&quot;, a remix album, was released on November 18, 2016. From July through December 2020, the band released a series of singles which were later included on the album &quot;Kindness Rages On&quot;, released on August 23, 2021.

==Blue Man Group==
Annette Strean provided vocals for Blue Man Group&#x27;s cover of &quot;I Feel Love&quot; on their 2003 album &quot;The Complex&quot;. Venus Hum opened for Blue Man Group on The Complex Rock Tour, and performed with them as well. The band was featured as &quot;rock concert movement number sixty-three.&quot; &quot;I Feel Love&quot; was released as a single in 2004.

<doc id="426045" wikidata="Q7134185" url="?curid=426045" title="Paradise, Newfoundland and Labrador">
<text>Paradise is a town on the Avalon Peninsula in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Paradise is the third largest settlement in the province and is part of the St. John&#x27;s metropolitan area, the 20th largest metropolitan area in Canada. The town borders the City of St. John&#x27;s, the City of Mount Pearl, the Town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip&#x27;s, and the town of Conception Bay South.

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Paradise had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. Based on the 2016 Census, the median income for the Town of Paradise was $107,542 before taxes and a median income of $89,037 after taxes.

==Geography==
Precambrian bedrock underlies the town, with a belt of volcanic rock along the coast and clastic sedimentary rock inland. The soil is for the most part a stony loam podzol mapped as Cochrane series. Peat is common in poorly drained areas.

==History==
While parts of Paradise have been inhabited since the late nineteenth century, mainly as farmland, its growth only took off in the 1830s and 1870s as a &quot;bedroom community&quot; of nearby St. John&#x27;s. It grew at a slow pace until the early 1990s, when the Town of Paradise was amalgamated with the Town of St. Thomas. Other developed areas which had previously been administered by the Southern Metropolitan Board--an agency of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador--were also amalgamated with Paradise. These areas are Three Island Pond, Topsail Pond, Elizabeth Park, and Evergreen Village.

=== Octagon Castle ===
Operating from 1896 to 1915, the Octagon Castle was a four-storey, eight-sided hotel resort, named by its creator, &quot;Professor&quot; Charles Henry Danielle. Destroyed by fire in 1915, its name survives in the nearby Octagon Pond. In 2022, a blue sculptural artwork inspired by Octagon Castle was installed at the centre of a Paradise roundabout.

==Sports==
Paradise is the starting point for the annual Tely 10 Mile Road Race, one of the oldest races in Canada. The race begins near Octagon Pond in Paradise before heading towards Mount Pearl. The town of Paradise hosted the Toronto Maple Leafs at its Paradise Double Ice Complex in September 2019 when the NHL club opened their 2019-2020 training camp in the town. In December 2019, the town of Paradise hosted the 2019 Para Hockey Cup at its Paradise Double Ice Complex, which saw teams from Canada, The United States of America, Russia, and the Czech Republic participating in the event.

==Town crest==

The town crest of Paradise was created by a former town council member and one time mayor, &quot;Black&quot; Arch Janes in 1986. He also provided an explanation of what each element of the crest represented.

* The animal in the top of the crest is a caribou. The caribou is currently the provincial animal of Newfoundland.
* There are two bulldogs holding up the crest. These are the representation of Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy. Newfoundland was a protectorate of Great Britain before becoming a province of Canada in 1949.
* The cross located on the center of the crest is a representation of the Christian religion on which the laws of Newfoundland are founded.
* The gear and electric bolt located in the top two portions of the crest represent industry in the community.
* The lower left corner of the crest bears a tree. This symbol is a representation of the town&#x27;s name. Paradise in Greek means a park.
* The lower right corner of the crest is a sled filled with wood. This symbol represents Paradise&#x27;s past industry, which was primarily in the wood industry.

==War memorial==
The War memorial located at the town hall was also designed by Arch Janes before his death in 1987.

==Government==
The Paradise town council is made up of a mayor, deputy mayor, and five councillors. The current mayor of the town is Dan Bobbett, a former Paradise town councillor.

Paradise is part of three provincial electoral districts; Conception Bay East – Bell Island, represented by Fred Hutton, and Topsail-Paradise, which is represented by Paul Dinn. Sarah Stoodley, the MHA for Mount Scio, also represents the Elizabeth Park subdivision in Paradise, near the Mount Pearl border. Dianne Whalen was the mayor of Paradise for 18 years before entering provincial politics in 2003.

The town is represented in Parliament by two MPs: Joanne Thompson, who represents the district of St. John&#x27;s East, and Ken McDonald, who represents the district of Avalon.

===2009 mayoral election controversy===
On September 29, 2009, Newfoundland and Labrador held municipal elections in its municipalities. Paradise had two people running for mayor – incumbent Ralph Wiseman and 19-year-old Kurtis Coombs.

On September 30, it was announced that Coombs had won the election, making him the youngest mayor in Canada. He had beat Wiseman by three votes, having 1,821 votes compared to Wiseman&#x27;s 1,818. However, a recount revealed that the two were tied. Under Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s Municipal Elections Act, a draw is used to determine the winner if a recount results in a tie. Wiseman was announced the mayor when a piece of paper with his name was drawn out of a recycle bin that contained both his name and Coombs&#x27;. Coombs planned on requesting a judicial recount and recommended that another election be held.

On October 6, a judge ordered that the results be recounted again, which took place on October 13. The following day it was announced that the recount resulted in another tie. Joyce Moss, the town&#x27;s chief returning officer, stated that the result from the random draw will stand, resulting in Wiseman remaining as the town&#x27;s mayor.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Medical centres and hospitals ===
Eastern Health&#x27;s Tuckamore Youth Treatment Centre is a residential treatment centre located in Paradise.

<doc id="426046" wikidata="Q744098" url="?curid=426046" title="Lawton Chiles">
<text>Lawton Mainor Chiles Jr. (April 3, 1930 – December 12, 1998) was an American politician and military officer. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a United States senator from Florida from 1971 to 1989 and as the 41st governor of Florida from 1991 until his death in 1998.

A Korean War veteran, Chiles later returned to Florida for law school and eventually opened his own private practice in 1955. Three years later, Chiles entered politics with a successful bid for the Florida House of Representatives in 1958.

By 1966, Chiles left the Florida House to run for the Florida Senate. Despite 12 years in the Florida Legislature, Chiles was relatively unknown when he decided to bid for United States Senate in 1970. He embarked on a 1,003-mile walk from Pensacola to Key West for his campaign, earning him the nickname &quot;Walkin&#x27; Lawton&quot;. It was successful and Chiles defeated his opponent William C. Cramer by a 53.9%–46.1% margin. Chiles was re-elected with relative ease in 1976 and 1982. He retired from the United States Senate in 1989.

Not long after his retirement, supporters convinced him to run for governor of Florida in 1990 against the unpopular incumbent Republican Bob Martinez, and Chiles defeated Martinez with 56.5% of the vote. During his first term as Governor, Chiles reformed health care and oversaw recovery efforts from Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Chiles faced a tough re-election bid in 1994 against Jeb Bush, a businessman and son of former President George H. W. Bush. Chiles prevailed over Bush with 50.75% of the vote, with a margin of fewer than 64,000 votes. During his second term, Chiles worked on education reform. On December 12, 1998, he suffered a heart arrhythmia and died at the Florida Governor&#x27;s Mansion, leaving Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay to serve the remaining 24 days of Chiles&#x27; unexpired term. Jeb Bush succeeded MacKay. As of 2025, Chiles is the last Democrat elected Governor of Florida.

==Early life and education==
Chiles was born in Polk County, Florida near Lakeland, the son of Margaret Kate (née Patterson) and Lawton Mainor Chiles. He attended public school at Lakeland High School, then the University of Florida at Gainesville. At the University of Florida, he was active in student politics. Chiles was a member of Phi Delta Phi International Legal Honor Society Cockrell Inn and was inducted into both the university Hall of Fame (the most prestigious honor a student can receive at UF) and Florida Blue Key.

He was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. He graduated in 1952. Following his college years, Chiles entered the Korean War, commissioned as an artillery officer in the United States Army. After the war, Chiles returned to the University of Florida for law school, from which he graduated in 1955; he passed the state bar exam that year and went into private practice in Lakeland. He married Rhea Grafton.

==Early career==
In 1958, Chiles, a Democrat, was elected to the Florida House of Representatives. It was essentially still a one-party state, as most African Americans were disfranchised by a constitution and laws passed since the turn of the century. Chiles served in the House until 1966, when he was elected to a seat in the Florida Senate, which he held until 1970. While in the state senate, Chiles served on the 1968 Florida Law Revision Commission. During his time in the state legislature, Chiles continued to work as a lawyer and developer in Lakeland. He was one of the initial investors in the Red Lobster restaurant chain. He was a member of the Florida Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.

==The 1,003-mile walk==

In 1970, Chiles decided to run for a seat in the United States Senate. At the time, despite his 12 years in the state legislature, he was largely unknown outside his Lakeland-based district. To generate some media coverage and meet people across the state, Chiles embarked upon a 1,003-mile, 91-day walk across Florida from Pensacola to Key West. The walk earned him the recognition he sought, as well as the nickname that would follow him throughout his political career– &quot;Walkin&#x27; Lawton&quot;. In his journal Chiles wrote that sometimes he walked alone, while other times he met ordinary Floridians along the way. In later years, Chiles would recall the walk allowed him to see Florida&#x27;s natural beauty, as well as the state&#x27;s problems, with fresh eyes. Some Florida reporters said that Chiles enjoyed campaigning much more than governing.

==Chiles v. Cramer==
In the general election campaign, Chiles faced U.S. representative William C. Cramer of St. Petersburg, the first Republican to have served in Congress from Florida since Reconstruction. Cramer, a graduate of Harvard Law School, questioned Chiles&#x27;s votes as a state senator on several matters regarding insurance. One law increased automobile liability rates by 50 percent over two years, and another raised premiums for school bus insurance, at a time that Chiles&#x27;s insurance agency in Lakeland held the policy on the Polk County School Board, but such &quot;conflict-of-interest&quot; accusations seemed to have little political effect.

The self-made Cramer depicted Chiles as coming from a &quot;silver spoon&quot; background with a then net worth of $300,000, but the media ignored questions about the candidates&#x27; personal wealth. Instead, reporters focused on the walk, often termed a &quot;public relations stroke of genius.&quot; Prior to the walk, Chiles was identified by only 5 percent of voters; afterwards, he had widespread positive recognition.

The &quot;Tallahassee Democrat&quot; forecast correctly that Chiles&#x27;s &quot;weary feet and comfortable hiking boots&quot; would carry the 40-year-old &quot;slow-country country lawyer&quot; with &quot;boyish amiability&quot;, and &quot;back-country common sense and methodical urbane political savvy&quot; to victory. Chiles&#x27;s &quot;Huck Finn&quot; image was contrasted one night in Miami when he held a fried chicken picnic while the Republicans showcased a black-tie $1,000-a-plate dinner.

Cramer could not match Chiles&#x27;s public appeal. An observer described Cramer&#x27;s &quot;charisma&quot; as &quot;a speech in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;.&quot; A Cramer aide said it was difficult &quot;selling experience. It&#x27;s not a sexy thing.&quot; A Chiles advertisement urged that voters &quot;Vote for yourself. Chiles walked our streets and highways to hear what you have to say. That&#x27;s why a vote for Chiles is like a vote for yourself.&quot; With &quot;shoe leather and a shoestring budget&quot;, Chiles presented himself as a &quot;problem solver who doesn&#x27;t automatically vote &#x27;No&#x27; on every issue.&quot;

Cramer said that he should have demanded more debates and rebuffed the walking tactic: &quot;I never could get that turned around. He was walking, and I was running. But the press was enamored with the walk ... Every time he was asked a question about where he stood, he would quote somebody that he met on the campaign trail to state what he was to do when he got to the Senate consistent with what that constituent had said. The basic approach gave him more credibility to his walk, which had nothing to do with his qualifications for the Senate but gave him free publicity and appealed to the &#x27;little man.&#x27;&quot;

With ecology a national concern by 1970, Chiles announced his opposition to the Cross Florida Barge Canal, which had originally been supported by every member of the Florida congressional delegation. The project, one-third completed, was cancelled early in 1971 and is now a protected green belt corridor. Chiles endorsed federal funding to remove waste from the bass-teeming Lake Apopka in central Florida. By contrast, Cramer received little credit from environmentalists although he had drafted the Water Pollution Control Act of 1956 and had sponsored legislation to protect alligators, stop beach erosion, dredge harbors, and remove oil spills. Instead, Cramer&#x27;s critics accused him of having weakened anti-pollution laws. Cramer questioned Chiles&#x27;s opposition to a proposed severance tax on phosphate mining, which particularly impacted Tampa Bay. Cramer declared that &quot;Liberal Lawton has protected the phosphate industry -- the state&#x27;s single largest polluter.&quot;

By 1974, a survey showed Floridians favored limits on development, and 60 percent urged more government funding for conservation.

Only three newspapers—in Orlando, Fort Myers, and Pasco County—supported Cramer in the race against Chiles. In the face of media opposition, Cramer failed to pin the &quot;liberal&quot; label on Chiles, who called himself by the rare hybrid term &quot;progressive conservative.&quot; Explaining Cramer&#x27;s inability to make &quot;liberalism&quot; an issue in 1970, &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that Chiles and the gubernatorial candidate, Reubin Askew of Pensacola, &quot;convey amiable good ol&#x27; boy qualities with moderate-to-liberal aspirations that do not strike fear into the hearts of conservatives.&quot;

Chiles relied heavily on his support from the retiring senator and former governor Spessard Holland. He noted that Cramer had expected to face former governor Farris Bryant, who like LeRoy Collins, Gurney&#x27;s foe in 1968, had ties to the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Bryant lost the senatorial primary to Chiles. &quot;I&#x27;m not anything Cramer thought he would be running against. So he&#x27;s reduced to telling lies about me,&quot; Chiles quipped. Chiles said that Cramer can bring Nixon, Agnew, Reagan, and anybody else he wants. ... I&#x27;ll take Holland on my side against all of them.&quot;

Cramer said a Republican-majority Senate would lead to the removal of controversial Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who had long opposed the Vietnam War. Chiles, however, retorted that if Republicans controlled the Senate other southern Democrats would also forfeit committee chairmanships earned through their seniority.

==U.S. senator==
Chiles was twice re-elected to the U.S. Senate -- 1976 and 1982, both heavily Democratic years. Chiles, never flashy, was considered a moderate lawmaker who rarely made waves. He served as the chairman of the Special Committee on Aging of the 96th Congress (1979–1981), and in the 100th Congress (1987–1989) served as chairman of the influential Senate Budget Committee. While heading the Budget Committee, he played a key role in the 1987 revision of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act.

In 1985, Chiles underwent quadruple-bypass heart surgery. After his recovery, he became increasingly frustrated with the slow pace of work in the Senate, complaining that it was too difficult to get anything done. Accordingly, he announced in December 1987 that he would not seek re-election the next year. Chiles was succeeded by Republican Connie Mack.

==Governor of Florida==

After the surgery, Chiles developed clinical depression, and was treated with Prozac. He retired from the Senate in 1989 and intended to retire from politics entirely. However, several supporters convinced him to enter the 1990 Florida governor&#x27;s race against Republican incumbent Bob Martinez. During the Democratic Party primary, his opponent Bill Nelson attempted to make an issue of Chiles&#x27; age and health, a strategy that backfired badly in a state with a large population of retirees.

Chiles ran a campaign to &quot;reinvent&quot; the state&#x27;s government, and defeated Martinez to take office in 1991. During his first term as governor, Chiles managed to accomplish very little. Although he developed ambitious health-care and tax reform packages, neither passed in the hostile state legislature. The early years of his term were troubled by a national economic recession that severely damaged Florida&#x27;s tourism-based economy, and by Hurricane Andrew, which struck near Homestead in August 1992.

Chiles ran for re-election in the 1994 election against Republican Jeb Bush. During the campaign season, Bush ran a television advertisement which featured the mother of a teenage girl who had been abducted and murdered many years before. The mother stated that &quot;Her killer is still on death row, and we&#x27;re still waiting for justice. We won&#x27;t get it from Lawton Chiles because he&#x27;s too liberal on crime. . . Lawton Chiles has let us down. . . I know Jeb Bush. He&#x27;ll make criminals serve their sentences and enforce the death penalty. Lawton Chiles won&#x27;t,&quot; referring to Chiles not signing the convicted killer&#x27;s death warrant. Chiles responded that he did not sign a death warrant because the case was still on appeal. The Democratic governor further claimed a record of support for the death penalty, having presided over 18 executions during his two terms (among them Judy Buenoano, the first Floridian woman executed since 1848). Moreover, after the botched electrocution of Pedro Medina in 1997, and despite significant public criticism, Chiles refused to endorse the use of lethal injection as a lawful form of execution. The new method was introduced under Bush&#x27;s administration in 1999 after the execution of Allen Lee Davis.

The 1994 election was memorable for its series of debates between Bush and Chiles. During the last debate on November 1, Chiles said to Bush, &quot;My momma told me, sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me. But let me tell you something about the old liberal. The old he-coon walks just before the light of day.&quot; Bush and many others did not understand the reference, but the quote gained significant media attention. After the debate, Chiles remained oblique, saying &quot;It&#x27;s sort of like saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t mess with the Lone Ranger.&#x27;&quot; The next day, Lt. Governor Buddy MacKay explained that the he-coon was the oldest and wiliest raccoon in the pack, according to Florida cracker folklore. Raccoons were hunted by the light of the moon, and the he-coon would wait all night while the young raccoons ran from the dogs, tiring them out. Then, just before the light of day, the he-coon would leave his lair and walk in the open, safe from the dogs. Chiles was implying that he was the he-coon, and just as the he-coon walked before dawn, he would score a comeback victory against Bush. The quip was a direct appeal to older, rural, ancestral Floridians, whose loyalty to Democratic candidates had waned over the past several decades. Seven days later, as Republicans swept the 1994 Florida elections in almost every respect, Chiles bucked the trend, winning reelection in an upset by about 64,000 votes, 1.52% of the total vote. He is the last Democrat to win a gubernatorial election in Florida. Chiles&#x27; &quot;he-coon&quot; quote has become a well-known moment in Florida politics, often recalled and referenced in headlines and Florida political debate.

Chiles&#x27; second term as governor was notable as the first time in state history that a Democratic governor had a legislature controlled by the Republican Party. Despite this, he had some successes, including a successful lawsuit he and state attorney general Bob Butterworth filed against the tobacco industry, which resulted in an $11.3 billion settlement for the state. He also won approval for a $2.7 billion statewide school construction program.

In 1995, Chiles sought treatment for a neurological problem that was later diagnosed as a mild stroke after he awoke with nausea, slurred speech and loss of coordination; and it would be determined dehydration might have caused the episode. He recovered fully, which was credited to prompt treatment.

==Death==
Ineligible to run a third time, Chiles supported the lieutenant governor, his personal friend Buddy MacKay, in the 1998 Florida governor&#x27;s race against Jeb Bush. Bush, however, scored an easy victory over MacKay. On December 12 that year, just three weeks before his long-awaited retirement was to begin, Chiles suffered from an abnormal heart rhythm while exercising on a cycling machine in the Governor&#x27;s Mansion gymnasium. He died suddenly shortly afterwards, at the age of 68.
Funeral services were held at Faith Presbyterian Church in Tallahassee on December 16, 1998, following a funeral procession that traced part of his walk from the 1970 Senate campaign from the panhandle town of Century to Tallahassee. Chiles was initially buried in a church cemetery in Tallahassee; however, within a year his wife had the body moved to a tract east of Tallahassee, a place they named Jubilee. He was succeeded in office by MacKay, who served until Bush&#x27;s term began on January 5, 1999.

==Legacy==

===Legislative and executive programs===
Chiles was known as a health care and children&#x27;s advocate throughout his career. He emphasized health coverage for the uninsured and led a campaign to create the National Commission for Prevention of Infant Mortality in the late 1980s. In 1994, he fought for the creation of regional health care alliances throughout the state, which allow small businesses to pool their health care dollars and broaden coverage while saving money. He also created the Florida Department of Elder Affairs.

In 1992, Chiles created the Florida Healthy Start program to provide a comprehensive prenatal and infant care program available to all pregnant women and infants across the state; since the program&#x27;s inception the state&#x27;s infant mortality rate has dropped 18%. In 1996, Chiles appointed a Governor&#x27;s Commission on Education to examine the state&#x27;s school system. One of the significant recommendations that came from that commission eventually led to the highly controversial 2002 state constitutional amendment restricting Florida&#x27;s school class sizes.

In 1997, anti-abortion advocacy group &quot;Choose Life&quot; collected 10,000 signatures and filed the $30,000 fee required under Florida law at the time to submit an application for a new specialty plate. State Senator Tom Lee sponsored a bill in support of the tag&#x27;s creation. The bill passed both houses of the Florida State Legislature in early 1998, but was vetoed by Chiles, who stated that license plates are not the &quot;proper forum for debate&quot; on political issues.

===Judicial appointments===
Perhaps his greatest legacy was his impact on the Florida Supreme Court, where his appointments continued to have a major impact on state and national events long after Chiles&#x27; death. Chiles appointed Justice Major B. Harding in 1991, Justice Charles T. Wells in 1994, Justice Harry Lee Anstead in 1994, Justice Barbara J. Pariente in 1997, and Justice R. Fred Lewis in 1998. Chiles and incoming governor Jeb Bush jointly appointed Justice Peggy A. Quince in 1998 just a few days before Chiles&#x27; death. Quince was jointly appointed because her term as Justice would begin the exact moment that Bush&#x27;s first term as governor began, so there was a legal question which governor had the authority to appoint her. Bush and Chiles agreed to make a joint appointment to avoid a lawsuit over the question.

Thus, at one point, Chiles had appointed five of the seven Justices and had jointly appointed the sixth. Chiles&#x27; appointments formed the Supreme Court majorities that decided the following major cases:
* In 2006, the Court struck down a law passed by the Florida State Legislature that had created the United States&#x27; first statewide education voucher program. The majority in this case consisted of Wells, Anstead, Pariente, Lewis, and Quince. Bush appointees Raoul G. Cantero and Kenneth B. Bell dissented.
* In 2004, the court struck down another piece of legislation from the Florida legislature designed to reverse a lower court decision in the Terri Schiavo case. This decision was unanimous and included Bush appointees Cantero and Bell. By this time, Harding had retired.
* In the 2000 presidential election controversy, the Florida Supreme Court ordered a statewide recount in the disputed election pitting George W. Bush against Al Gore. The United States Supreme Court later reversed that ruling. The Florida Supreme Court majority in this case consisted of Anstead, Pariente, Lewis, and Quince. Dissenting Justices were Wells, Harding, and Leander J. Shaw Jr., an appointee of Governor Bob Graham. Shaw retired in early 2003 and was replaced by Bell.

==Relatives==
Chiles&#x27; niece was former U.S. senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina, a Democrat elected in 2008. Hagan was the daughter of Chiles&#x27; sister Jeannette. Chiles&#x27; son, &quot;Bud&quot; Chiles, ran for the position of Governor of Florida without party affiliation in a grassroots campaign. Like his father, Bud embarked on a walking tour of the state, listening and visiting with local communities in Florida. On September 2, 2010, Chiles dropped out of the race citing &quot;continuing down this road could have unintended consequences, dividing those who hold common goals...&quot; Chiles threw his support behind Alex Sink.

<text>Gyeongju (, ), historically known as Seorabeol (, ), is a coastal city in the far southeastern corner of North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It is the second largest city by area in the province after Andong, covering with a population of 264,091 people . Gyeongju is southeast of Seoul, and east of Daegu. The city borders Cheongdo and Yeongcheon to the west, Ulsan to the south and Pohang to the north, while to the east lies the coast of the Sea of Japan. Numerous low mountains—outliers of the Taebaek range—are scattered around the city.

Gyeongju was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla (57 BC – 935 AD), which ruled about two-thirds of the Korean peninsula at its height between the 7th and 9th centuries, for close to one thousand years. Later Silla was a prosperous and wealthy country, and Gyeongju was the fourth largest city in the world. A vast number of archaeological sites and cultural properties from this period remain in the city. Gyeongju is often referred to as &quot;the museum without walls&quot;. Among such historical treasures, Seokguram grotto, Bulguksa temple, Gyeongju Historic Areas and Yangdong Folk Village are designated as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. The many major historical sites have helped Gyeongju become one of the most popular tourist destinations in South Korea.

The city of Gyeongju was united with the nearby rural Gyeongju County in 1995 and is now an urban–rural complex. It is similar to 53 other small and medium-sized cities with a population under 300,000 people in South Korea. As well as its rich historical heritage, Gyeongju today is affected by the economic, demographic, and social trends that have shaped modern South Korean culture. Tourism remains the major economic driver, but manufacturing activities have developed due to its proximity to major industrial centers such as Ulsan and Pohang. Gyeongju is connected to the nationwide rail and highway networks, which facilitate industrial and tourist traffic.

== History ==
The early history of Gyeongju is closely tied to that of the Silla kingdom, of which it was the capital. Gyeongju first enters non-Korean records as Saro-guk, during the Samhan period. Korean records, probably based on the dynastic chronicles of Silla, record that Saro-guk was established in 57 BCE, when six small villages in the Gyeongju area united under Bak Hyeokgeose. As the kingdom expanded, it changed its name to Silla. During the Silla period, the city was called &quot;Seorabeol&quot; (this toponym would eventually evolve into a Korean word for &quot;capital city&quot; as in Seoul), &quot;Gyerim&quot; (lit. Rooster&#x27;s forest), or &quot;Geumseong&quot; (lit. City of Gold or Metal &quot;i.e.&quot; Impenetrable Fortress).

After the unification of the peninsula up to Taedong River in 668 AD, Gyeongju became the center of Korean political and cultural life. The city was home to the Silla court and the great majority of the kingdom&#x27;s elite. Its prosperity became legendary, and was reported as far away as Persia according to the 9th century book &quot;The Book of Roads and Kingdoms&quot;. The historical text &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; give the city&#x27;s population in its peak period as 178,936 households, suggesting that the total population was almost one million. Many of Gyeongju&#x27;s most famous sites date from this Unified Silla period, which ended in the beginning of 10th century by Goryeo (918–1392).

In 940, the founder of Goryeo, King Taejo, changed the city&#x27;s name to &quot;Gyeongju&quot;, which literally means &quot;Congratulatory district&quot;. In 987, as Goryeo introduced a system in which three additional capitals were established in politically important provinces outside Gaegyeong (nowadays Kaesong), and Gyeongju was designated as &quot;Donggyeong&quot; (&quot;East Capital&quot;). However, that title was removed in 1012, the third year of King Hyeongjong&#x27;s reign, due to political rivalries at that time, though Gyeongju was later made the seat of Yeongnam Province. It had jurisdiction over a wide area, including much of central eastern Yeongnam, although this area was greatly reduced in the 13th century. Under the subsequent Joseon (1392–1910) dynasties, Gyeongju was no longer of national importance, but remained a regional center of influence. In 1601, the city ceased to be the provincial capital.

Over these centuries, the city suffered numerous assaults. In the 13th century, Mongol forces destroyed a nine-story wooden pagoda at Hwangnyongsa. During the Japanese invasions of Korea, the Gyeongju area became a heated battlefield, and Japanese forces burned the wooden structures at Bulguksa. Not all damage was due to invasions, however. In the early Joseon period, a great deal of damage was done to Buddhist sculptures on Namsan by Neo-Confucian radicals, who hacked arms and heads off statuary.

In the 20th century, the city remained relatively small, no longer ranking among the major cities of Korea. During the early 20th century, many archaeological excavations were conducted, particularly inside the tombs which had remained largely intact over the centuries. A museum, the forerunner of the present-day Gyeongju National Museum, was inaugurated in 1915 to exhibit the excavated artifacts.

Gyeongju emerged as a railroad junction in the later years of the Japanese occupation, as the Donghae Nambu Line and Jungang line were established in preparation for the Second Sino-Japanese War and to exploit the rich resources of the eastern part of the Korean peninsula. Following liberation in 1945, Korea was plunged into turmoil, and Gyeongju was no exception. Returnees from abroad were numerous; a village for them was constructed in present-day Dongcheon-dong. In a period marked by widespread conflict and unrest, the Gyeongju area became particularly notorious for the level of guerrilla activity in the mountains.

Despite the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, most of Gyeongju was spared from the fighting, and remained under South Korean control throughout the conflict. However, for a brief time in late 1950 portions of the city stood on the front lines, as North Korean forces pushed the Pusan Perimeter southward from Pohang.

In the 1970s, Korea saw substantial industrial development, much of it centered in the Yeongnam region of which Gyeongju is a part. The POSCO steel mill in neighboring Pohang commenced operations in 1973, and the chemical manufacturing complex in Ulsan emerged in the same year. These developments helped to support the emergence of Gyeongju&#x27;s manufacturing sector.

== Geography and climate ==
Gyeongju lies in the southeastern corner of North Gyeongsang Province, and is bounded by the metropolitan city of Ulsan on the south. Within the province, its neighbors include Pohang on the north, Cheongdo County on the southwest, and Yeongcheon on the northwest. Gyeongju is located about north of Busan. To the east, it has no neighbor but the sea.

Most of Gyeongju lies in the Gyeongsang Basin, but a few areas of the city belong to the Pohang Basin, such as Eoil-ri and Beomgok-ri in Yangbuk-myeon, and part of Cheonbuk-myeon. The Gyeongsang Basin areas consist of Bulguksa intrusive rock penetrating layers of sedimentary rocks, mainly granite and porphyry. By contrast, the Pohang Basin areas are made up of stratum that formed in the Tertiary period of the Cenozoic era, which consist of igneous rock, aqueous rock, porphyry, sandstone, and tuff.

Low mountains are widespread throughout Gyeongju. The highest of these are the Taebaek Mountains, which run along the city&#x27;s western border. Gyeongju&#x27;s highest point, Munboksan (), is above sea level. This peak lies in Sannae-myeon, on the border with Cheongdo. East of the Taebaek range, other western peaks such as Danseok Mountain lie within the Jusa subrange. The city&#x27;s eastern peaks, including Tohamsan, belong to the Haean Mountains and Dongdae Mountains.
Gyeongju&#x27;s drainage patterns are shaped by these lines of mountains. The Dongdae Mountains divide a narrow foothills area on their east, and various internal river systems to the west. Most of the city&#x27;s interior is drained by the small Hyeongsan River, which flows north from Ulsan and meets the sea at Pohang Harbor. The Hyeongsan&#x27;s chief tributaries include the Bukcheon and Namcheon, which join it in Gyeongju Basin.
The southwestern corner of Gyeongju, on the far side of the Taebaek range, drains into the Geumho River, which then flows into the Nakdong. A small area of the south, just west of the Dongdae range, drains into the Taehwa River, which flows into the Bay of Ulsan.

The Gyeongju coastline runs for between Pohang in the north and Ulsan in the south. There are no islands or large bays, only the small indentations made by the small streams flowing off the Dongdae ridgeline. Because of this, the city has no significant ports, though there are 12 small harbors. One such harbor in Gyeongju&#x27;s southeast corner is home to the Ulsan base of the National Maritime Police. This base is responsible for security over a wide area of South Korea&#x27;s east-central coast.

===Climate===
Gyeongju has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;). Due to its coastal location, Gyeongju has a slightly milder climate than the more inland regions of Korea. In general, however, the city&#x27;s climate is typical of South Korea. It has hot summers and cool winters, with a monsoon season between late June and early August. As on the rest of Korea&#x27;s east coast, autumn typhoons are not uncommon. The average annual rainfall is , and the average annual high temperatures range from .

Gyeongju&#x27;s historic city center lies on the banks of the Hyeongsan in Gyeongju Basin. This lowlying area has been subject to repeated flooding throughout recorded history, often as a result of typhoons. On average, chronicles report a major flood every 27.9 years, beginning in the 1st century. Modern flood control mechanisms brought about a dramatic reduction in flooding in the later 20th century. The last major flood occurred in 1991, when the Deokdong Lake reservoir overflowed due to Typhoon Gladys.

== Government ==
The executive branch of the government is headed by a mayor and vice-mayor. As in other South Korean cities and counties, the mayor is elected directly, while the vice-mayor is appointed. As of 2019, the mayor is Joo Nak-young, who was elected on June 13, 2018, in the local elections. He is Gyeongju&#x27;s fifth mayor to be directly elected, the sixth to preside over the city in its present form, and the 31st mayor since 1955. Like most heads of government in the Yeongnam region, he is a member of the conservative Liberty Korea Party.

The legislative branch consists of the Gyeongju City Council, with 21 members as of 2009. The present City Council was formed from the merger of the old Gyeongju City Council with the Wolseong County Council in 1991. Most subdivisions of Gyeongju elect a single member to represent them in the council, but Angang-eup is represented by two members because of its large population, and two of the representatives serve combined districts composed of two &quot;dong&quot;. Like the mayor, the council members were last elected in 2006, except for a small number elected in more recent by-elections.

The central administration is composed of a City Council committee, five departments, two subsidiary organs, a chamber (the auditor), and six business offices. The five departments are the departments of Planning and Culture, Autonomous Administration, Industry and Environment, Construction and Public Works, and the National Enterprise Committee; these oversee a total of 29 subdivisions. The two subsidiary organs are the Health Care Center and Agro-technology Center; these belong directly to the central administration and have a total of 4 subdivisions. In addition, there are 23 local administrative subdivisions. Each of these subdivisions has a local office with a small administrative staff. As of December 2008, the city government employed 1,462 people.

==Subdivisions==

The city is divided into 23 administrative districts: 4 &quot;eup&quot;, 8 &quot;myeon&quot;, and 11 &quot;dong&quot;. These are the standard subdivisions of cities and counties in South Korea. The &quot;dong&quot; or neighborhood units occupy the area of the city center, which was formerly occupied by Gyeongju-eup. &quot;Eup&quot; are typically substantial villages, whereas &quot;myeon&quot; are more rural.

The city&#x27;s boundaries and designation changed several times in the 20th century. From 1895 to 1955, the area was known as Gyeongju-gun (&quot;Gyeongju County&quot;). In the first decades of the century, the city center was known as Gyeongju-myeon, signifying a relatively rural rea. In 1931, the downtown area was designated Gyeongju-eup, in recognition of its increasingly urban nature. In 1955, Gyeongju-eup became Gyeongju-si (&quot;Gyeongju City&quot;), the same name as today, but with a much smaller area. The remainder of Gyeongju-gun became &quot;Wolseong County.&quot; The county and city were reunited in 1995, creating Gyeongju City as it is today.

==Demographics==
When the Silla kingdom reached the peak of its development, Gyeongju was estimated to have a million residents, four times the city&#x27;s population in 2008. In recent years, Gyeongju has followed the same trends that have affected the rest of South Korea. Like the country as a whole, Gyeongju has seen its population age and the size of families shrink. For instance, the mean household size is 2.8 people. Because this has fallen in recent years, there are more households in the city as of 2008 (105,009) than there were in 2003, even though the population has fallen.

Like most of South Korea&#x27;s smaller cities, Gyeongju has seen a steady drop in population in recent years. From 2002 to 2008, the city lost 16,557 people. This is primarily due to the migration of workers seeking employment in the major South Korean cities. In 2007, about 1,975 more people moved away from the city each year than moved in. During the same period, births exceeded deaths by roughly 450 per year, a significant number but not enough to offset the losses due to migration.

Gyeongju has a small but growing population of non-Koreans. In 2007, there were 4,671 foreigners living in Gyeongju. This number corresponds to 1.73% of the total population, more than double the figure from 2003. The growth was largely in immigrants from other Asian countries, many of whom are employed in the automotive parts industry. Countries of origin whose numbers have risen include the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The number of residents from Japan, the United States, and Canada fell significantly in the 2003–2007 period.

===Dialect===
The city has a distinctive dialect which it shares with northern portions of Ulsan. This dialect is similar to the general Gyeongsang dialect, but retains distinctive features of its own. Some linguists have treated the distinctive characteristics of the Gyeongju dialect as vestiges of the Silla language. For instance, the contrast between the local dialect form &quot;&quot; (&quot;sonaegi&quot;) and the standard &quot;&quot; (&quot;sonagi,&quot; meaning &quot;rainshower&quot;) has been seen as reflecting the ancient phonemic character of the Silla language.

==Culture and people==

===Cultural properties===
Gyeongju is the main destination in South Korea for visitors interested in the cultural heritage of Silla and the architecture of Joseon. The city has 31 National Treasures, and Gyeongju National Museum houses 16,333 artifacts. There are four broad categories of relics and historical sites: tumuli and their artifacts; Buddhist sites and objects; fortresses and palace sites; and ancient architecture. Prehistoric remains including Mumun pottery have been excavated in central Gyeongju, in the Moa-ri and Oya-ri villages of the Cheonbuk-myeon district, and in the Jukdong-ri village of the Oedong district. Dolmens are found in several places, especially in Gangdong-myeon and Moa-ri. Bronze Age relics found in Angye-ri village of Gangdong-myeon, Jukdong-ri and Ipsil-ri villages of Oedong-eup and graveyards in the Joyang-dong district represent the Samhan confederacy period of around the 1st century BC to the 3rd century AD.

There are 35 royal tombs and 155 tumuli in central Gyeongju, and 421 tumuli in the outskirts of the city. Silla burial mounds built after the period of the Three Kingdoms are found in central Gyeongju, including tumuli in the districts of Noseo-dong, Nodong-dong, Hwangnam-dong, Hwango-dong and Inwang-dong. Western Gyeongju has the tomb of King Muyeol in Seoak-dong, nearby tumuli in Chunghyo-dong and the tomb of Kim Yu-sin. The tombs of Queen Seondeok, King Sinmun, King Hyogong and King Sinmu are at the base of Namsan mountain while the tombs of King Heongang, King Jeonggang, King Gyeongmyeong and King Gyeongae are on the slopes of the mountain. In addition to the tombs, tumuli have been found surrounding Namsan mountain and in the western part of Geumgang mountain. Artifacts excavated from the tombs of Geumgwanchong (gold crown tomb), Seobongchong (western phoenix tomb), Cheonmachong (heavenly horse tomb) and northern and southern parts of Tomb No. 98 are good examples of Silla culture.

=== Notable people ===


Gyeongju has produced notable individuals throughout its history. As the capital of Silla, Gyeongju was a center of culture in its heyday. Notable Gyeongju residents in the Silla period included most of the kingdom&#x27;s leading figures, not only rulers but scholars such as Seol Chong and Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;i-wŏn, and generals like Kim Yu-sin, the leader of the Hwarang warriors. The city continued to contribute to traditional Korean thought in subsequent dynasties. Relatives of Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;i-wŏn such as Ch&#x27;oe Ŏn-wi and Ch&#x27;oe Hang played an important role in establishing the structures of early Goryeo. In the Joseon period, Gyeongju joined the rest of Gyeongsang in becoming a hotbed of the conservative &quot;Sarim&quot; faction. Notable Gyeongju members of this faction included the 15th century intellectual Yi Eonjeok. He has been enshrined in the Oksan Seowon since 1572. In modern times, the city produced writers such as Kim Dongni and Pak Mok-wol, both of whom did a great deal to popularize the region&#x27;s culture, as well as Choe Jun, a wealthy businessman who established the Yeungnam University Foundation.

Some Korean family clans trace their origins to Gyeongju, often to the ruling elites of Silla. For example, the Gyeongju Kim clan claims descent from the rulers of later Silla. The and trace their ancestry to Silla&#x27;s earlier ruling families. These three royal clans played a strong role in preserving the historical precincts of Gyeongju into modern times. The Gyeongju Choi and also trace their ancestry to the Silla elites. Prominent members of the Gyeongju Lee clan include Goryeo period scholar Yi Che-hyŏn, and Joseon period scholars Yi Hwang and Yi Hang-bok. A contemporary notable figure from the Gyeongju Lee clan is Lee Byung-chul, the founder of Samsung Group. However, not all Gyeongju clans date to the Silla period; for instance, the Gyeongju Bing clan was founded in the early Joseon period.

===Religion===
The city remains an important centre of Korean Buddhism. East of the downtown area lies Bulguksa, one of South Korea&#x27;s largest Buddhist temples; nearby is Seokguram, a famed Buddhist shrine. Traditional prayer locations are found on mountains throughout Gyeongju. Such mountains include Namsan near the city center, Danseok-san and Obong-san in the west, and the low peak of Hyeong-san on the Gyeongju-Pohang border. Namsan in particular is often referred to as &quot;the sacred mountain&quot; due to the Buddhist shrines and statues which cover its slopes. In addition, Gyeongju is the birthplace of Cheondoism, an indigenous religion to Korea based on Korean shamanism, Taoism and Korean Buddhism, with elements drawn from Christianity. The religion evolved from Donghak (lit. East learning) disciplines established by Choe Je-u. His birthplace of Yongdamjeong, located in Hyeongok-myeon, is regarded as a sacred place to followers of Cheondogyo.

=== Cuisine ===


The cuisine of Gyeongju is generally similar to other areas of Gyeongsang Province: spicy and salty. However, it has distinctive tastes according to region and several local specialties known nationwide. The most famous of these is &quot;Gyeongju bread&quot; or &quot;Hwangnam bread&quot;, a red-bean pastry first baked in 1939 and now sold throughout the country. &quot;Chalboribbang&quot;, made with locally produced glutinous barley, is also a pastry with a filling of red bean paste. Local specialties with a somewhat longer pedigree include &quot;beopju&quot;, a traditional Korean liquor produced by the Gyeongju Choe in Gyo-dong. The brewing skill and distill master were designated as Important Intangible Cultural Properties by South Korea government.
Other local specialities include &quot;ssambap&quot;, &quot;haejangguk&quot;, and &quot;muk&quot;. &quot;Ssambap&quot; refers to a rice dish served with vegetable leaves, various &quot;banchan&quot; (small side dishes) and condiments such as &quot;gochujang&quot; (chili pepper paste) or &quot;ssamjang&quot; (a mixture of soybean paste and &quot;gochujang&quot;) to wrap them together. Most &quot;ssambap&quot; restaurants in Gyeongju are gathered in the area of Daenuengwon or Grand Tumuli Park. &quot;Haejangguk&quot; is a kind of soup eaten as a hangover cure, and means &quot;soup to chase a hangover&quot;. A street dedicated to &quot;haejangguk&quot; is located near Gyeongju National Museum, where 20 &quot;haejangguk&quot; restaurants are gathered to serve the Gyeongju-style &quot;haejangguk&quot;. The soup is made by boiling soybean sprout, sliced &quot;memilmuk&quot; (buckwheat starch jelly), sour kimchi (pickled vegetables) and gulfweed in a clear broth of dried anchovy and Alaska pollack.

The east district of Gyeongju, Gampo-eup town, is adjacent to the sea, so fresh seafood and &quot;jeotgal&quot; (fermented salted seafood) are abundant. There are over 240 seafood restaurants in Gampo Harbor offering various dishes made with seafood caught in the sea, such as &quot;hoe&quot; (raw fish dishes), &quot;jeonboktang&quot; (an abalone soup), grilled seafood and others.

==Sports==

As of 2007, Gyeongju had two stadiums, two gymnasiums, two tennis courts, one swimming pool and others as public sport facilities as well as various registered private sports venues. Many of public sport facilities are located in Hwangseong Park with an area of including a luxuriant pine trees forest. The site was originally the location of the artificial forest of Doksan which was established for &quot;feng shui&quot; purposes during the Silla period. It was also used as a training ground for hwarang warriors and hunting spot for Silla kings, and was reported to be King Jinpyeong&#x27;s favorite location. In 1975, Hwangseong Park was designated a &quot;city neighborhood park&quot; and it currently consists of the multi-purpose Gyeongju Public Stadium, Football Park (with seven football fields and one futsal field), and one gymnasium, as well as Horimjang field for &quot;gukgung&quot; or Korean traditional archery and a ssireum wrestling ring. In addition, it contains a gateball field, an inline skating rink, jogging courses, and cycling roads. The Gyeongju Public Stadium was completed in 1982 and can accommodate 20,000 people at capacity.

Angang Field Hockey Stadium, located in the district of Angang-eup, is home to Gyeongju City Hockey, which is one of four professional women&#x27;s field hockey teams in South Korea. The team was formed in 1994, and is governed by the Sport and Youth Division of Gyeongju City. Although not an initial successful team, Gyeongju City Hockey won the first trophies both at National Division Hockey Championships and National Sports Festival in 2000. In 2002, Gyeongju City Hockey took a first prize and three second prizes, and in 2008, the team won the first prize at the 51st National Division Hockey Championships.

The city plays host to two annual marathon events. The Gyeongju International Marathon, held in October, garners elite level competition while the larger Gyeongju Cherry Blossom Marathon caters more for amateur fun runners. The Cherry Blossom Marathon has been held each year in Gyeongju since 1992, usually in April, to improve relations with Japan (a country with a long history of marathon running). The race, mainly sponsored by Gyeongju and the district, attracted 13,600 participants in 2009 including about 1,600 foreigners.

==Economy==
The economy of Gyeongju is diverse. Although tourism is important to the economy, most residents work in other fields. Over 27,000 are employed in manufacturing compared to roughly 13,500 in the hospitality industry.
The number involved in tourism has remained constant over recent years, while the manufacturing sector added about 6,000 jobs from 1999 to 2003. The manufacturing sector is closely tied to nearby cities, utilizing Gyeongju&#x27;s transit links with Ulsan, Pohang, and Daegu. As in Ulsan and Daegu the automotive parts industry plays an important role. Of the 1,221 businesses incorporated in Gyeongju almost a third are involved in auto-parts manufacture.

Fishing takes place in coastal towns, especially in Gampo-eup in the city&#x27;s northeast, with 436 registered fishing craft in the city. Fishing industry in Gyeongju is generally in a declined status due to relatively inconvenient transport conditions and lacks of subordinate facilities. Much of the catch from these boats goes direct from the harbor to Gyeongju&#x27;s many seafood restaurants. Mainly, sauries, anchovies, rays are harvested and a small number of abalone and wakame farming takes place. Local specialties include &quot;myeolchijeot&quot; (fermented anchovy), abalone, wakame, and squid.
Agriculture is still important, particularly in the outlying regions of Gyeongju. According to the 2006 statistical yearbook of Gyeongju, rice fields occupy an area of , which is 70% of the total cultivated acreage of . The remaining consists of fields under other crops and farmsteads. Crop production is centered in the fertile river basins near the Hyeongsan River. The main crops are rice, barley, beans and corn. Vegetables such as radish and napa cabbage and fruits are also important crops. Apples are mainly produced in the districts of Geoncheon-eup, Gangdong-myeon and Cheonbuk-myeon and Korean pear are cultivated in Geoncheon-eup and Angang-eup. The city plays a leading role in the domestic production of beef and mushrooms. Button mushrooms harvested in Geoncheon-eup are canned and exported. The cultivated acreage and the number of households engaging in agriculture is however declining.

A small amount of quarrying activity takes place in the city, with 46 active mines and quarries in Gyeongju. Most are engaged in the extraction of kaolin, fluorspar and Agalmatolite and Kaolin is exported.
As the capital of Silla, commerce and trading in Gyeongju developed early on. &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; has records on the establishment of &quot;Gyeongdosi&quot; (capital area market) in March, 490 during King Soji&#x27;s reign, and &quot;Dongsi&quot; (East Market) in 509, during King Jijeung&#x27;s reign. In the 1830s, Gyeongju had five five-day markets which remained very active until the late 1920s. Due to its size &quot;Gyeongju Bunaejang&quot; (Gyeongju village market) was referred to as one of the two leading markets in the Yeongnam area, along with &quot;Daegu Bunaejang&quot;. Transportation developed in the late period of the Japanese occupation, as the Jungang Line and the Daegu Line and the connecting route between Pohang and the northwestern part of Japan were set up, leading to increasing population and developing commerce. After the 1960s, traditional periodic markets gradually transformed into regular markets as the city was flourishing. In periodic markets, agricultural and marine products, industrial products, living necessaries, wild edible greens, herbs, and cattle are mainly traded. As of 2006, Gyeongju had eight regular markets, nine periodic markets and the Gyeongju department store. Traditional periodic markets declined and have become token affairs these days.

==Tourism==
Gyeongju is a major tourist destination for South Koreans as well as foreign visitors. It boasts the 1000 years of Silla heritage with vast number of ancient ruins and archaeological sites found throughout the city, which help to attract 6 million visiting tourists including 750,000 foreigners per year. The city government has parlayed its historic status into a basis for other tourism-related developments such as conferences, festivals, and resorts.

Many Silla sites are located in Gyeongju National Park such as the Royal Tomb Complex, the Cheomseongdae observatory that is one of the oldest surviving astronomical observatories in
East Asia, the Anapji royal pond garden, and the Gyerim forest. Gyeongju National Museum hosts many important artifacts and national treasures that have been excavated from sites within the city and surrounding areas.
Much of Gyeongju&#x27;s heritage are related to the Silla kingdom&#x27;s patronage of Buddhism. The grotto of Seokguram and the temple of Bulguksa were the first Korean sites to be included on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1995. In addition, the ruins of the old Hwangnyongsa temple, said to have been Korean&#x27;s largest, are preserved on the slopes of Tohamsan. Various Silla-era stone carvings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are found on mountainsides throughout the city, particularly on Namsan.

A significant portion of Gyeongju&#x27;s tourist traffic is due to the city&#x27;s promotion of itself as a site for various festivals, conferences, and competitions. Every year since 1962, the Silla cultural festival has been held in October to celebrate and honour the dynasty&#x27;s history and culture. It is one of the major festivals of Korea. It features athletic events, folk games, music, dance, literary contests and Buddhist religious ceremonies. Other festivals include the Cherry Blossom Marathon in April, the Korean Traditional Liquor and Cake festival in March, and memorial ceremonies for the founders of the Silla Dynasty and General Kim Yu-sin.

There were 15 hotels including Hilton Hotel, Gyeongju Chosun Hotel, and 276 lodging facilities, and 2,817 restaurants in Gyeongju in 2006.

Gyeongju&#x27;s emerging tourist attraction is the shopping street Hwangnidan-gil. The address of Hwangnidan-gil is 1080, Poseok-ro, Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province. There are about 400 stores, including restaurants, cafes, bookstores, and gift shops. Hwangnidan-gil became popular through social networking sites, and neighboring Gyeongju&#x27;s historical site is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The advantage of the Hwangnidan-gil is the result of voluntary efforts by merchants without help from local governments.

==Media==

Gyeongju has two main local newspapers; the &quot;Gyeongju Sinmun&quot; and the &quot;Seorabeol Sinmun&quot;. Both are weekly newspapers providing news via online as well and their headquarters are located in the neighborhood of Dongcheon-dong. The Gyeongju Sinmun was founded in 1989 and provides various news and critics on anything concerning Gyeongju. Its online newspaper, Digital Gyeongju Sinmun opened in December, 2000 to provide live local news out of the limit as a weekly newspaper and to establish mutual information exchanges from Gyeongju locals. In 2001, Gyeongju Sinmun started to present Gyeongju Citizen Awards to people who try to develop the local industry and economy, culture and education, and welfare service. Since 2003, the Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant headquarter co-hosts the awards with Gyeongju Sinmun.

The &quot;Seorabeol Sinmun&quot; was established in 1993, however, from November 15, 2000, to November 10, 2005, its publication was stopped for financial difficulties after the 1997 Asian economic crisis had left a strong impact on the nationwide economy. Since 2006, Seorabeol Sinmun presents Serabeol Awards to people having devouring to develop Gyeongju.

Several major feature films have been filmed in the city, including &quot;Kick the Moon&quot;, &quot;On the Occasion of Remembering the Turning Gate&quot;, &quot;Taegukgi&quot;, &quot;Chwihwaseon&quot; and others. In 2009, the filming of the &quot;Queen Seondeok&quot;, a popular MBC TV series took place in a studio at Silla Millennium Park located in Bomun Lake Resort.

== Education ==
Gyeongju is strongly associated with the education tradition of Hwarangdo (&quot;Way of the Flower of Young Men&quot;) which was established and flourished during the Silla period. It is a military and philosophical code that offered the basis of training to Hwarang, a military cadet of youths from the aristocratic class. The training equally emphasized practicing academic and martial arts based on Buddhism and patriotism. A number of Silla&#x27;s greatest generals and military leaders such as Kim Yu-sin were Hwarang who played a central role in Silla unification of the Korean peninsula. As Silla was integrated into the next ruling dynasty, Goryeo, the system declined and was officially disbanded in the Joseon period. However, the spirit and discipline were revived in the second half of the 20th century as a form of Korean martial arts with the same name.
Formal education has a longer history in Gyeongju than anywhere else in South Korea. The &quot;Gukhak&quot;, or national academy, was established here in 682, at the beginning of the Unified Silla period. Its curriculum focused on the Confucian classics for local officials. After the fall of Silla in the 10th century, the Gukhak closed. However, due to Gyeongju&#x27;s role as a provincial center under the Goryeo and early Joseon dynasties, the city was home to state-sponsored provincial schools (&quot;hyanggyo&quot;) under both dynasties such as Gyeongju Hyanggyo. During the later Joseon dynasty there were several seowon, or private Confucian academies, were set up in the city such as Oksan Seowon and Seoak Seowon.

The education system of Gyeongju is the same as elsewhere in the country. Schooling begins with preschools; there are 65 in the city. This is followed by six years in elementary schools; Gyeongju has 46. Subsequently, students pass through three years of middle school. There are 19 middle schools in Gyeongju. High school education, which lasts for three years, is not compulsory, but most students attend and graduate from high school. Gyeongju is home to 21 high schools, of which 11 provide specialized technical training. At each of these levels, there is a mix of public and private institutions. All are overseen by the Gyeongju bureau of North Gyeongsang&#x27;s Provincial Office of Education. Gyeongju is home to a school for the mentally disabled, which provides education to students from preschool to adult age.

Gyeongju is home to four institutions of tertiary education. Sorabol College is a technical college in the district of Chunghyo-dong that offers majors specializing in tourism, leisure, health care and cosmetic treatments.

Each of Gyeongju&#x27;s three universities reflects the city&#x27;s unique role. Dongguk and Uiduk universities are Buddhist institutions, reflecting that religion&#x27;s link to the city. Gyeongju University, formerly Korea Tourism University, is strongly focused on tourism, reflecting its importance in the region.

==Infrastructure==

===Healthcare===

According to the 2008 yearbook of Gyeongju, the total number of medical institutions was 224 with 3,345 beds, including two general hospitals, thirteen hospitals, 109 clinics, five nursing homes, forty two dental hospitals, two Korean traditional medicine hospitals and 50 Korean traditional medicine clinics. There are also twenty eight medical institutions related to Gyeongju Health Center affiliated to the Gyeongju City government.

The two general hospitals are associated with two major universities in Gyeongju and nearby Daegu. One is the Dongguk University Gyeongju Hospital, located in the district of Seokjang-dong, which is affiliated with Dongguk University Medical School and Center. The Gyeongju Hospital was opened in a seven-story building in 1991 to provide Gyeongju locals with a quality medical service and train medical specialists in the region. After various renovations the hospital currently has 24 departments including a radiation oncology center and 438 beds. It is also assigned as a teaching and learning hospital and in partnership with Dongguk University Oriental Hospital. The other general hospital is a branch of Keimyung University, Dongsan Medical Hospital in Daegu. It is the successor of Gyeongju Christianity Hospital founded in 1962, and was reborn as the current general hospital in 1991. The Gyeongju Dongsan Hospital is located in the district of Seobu-dong and has 12 departments in a three-story building.

===Utilities===

Water supply and sewage disposal are municipal services which are respectively handled by the Water Supply Office and Water Quality and Environment Office. Water comes from the Hyeongsan River, the multi-purpose Deokdong Dam and several streams. The city is divided into seven water districts, with eight filtration plants and seven sewage treatment plants. One of the sewage treatment plants, Angang Sewage Disposal Plant began operating in April 2005 by the co-investment of the governments of North Gyeongsang and Gyeongju with a fund of 44,300,000,000 won to install facilities to prevent the pollution of the Hyeongsan River, which is a main water source for Gyeongju and Pohang residents. The plant is located on a spacious site with in Homyeong-ri, Gangdong-myeon in Gyeongju where nature friendly facilities provide recreational venues for the locals. Through of sewer pipes and 14 pumping stations, the plant has a capacity of 18,000 tonnes of domestic sewage per day that comes from Angang-eup, and Gangdong-myeon. The facilities have high-powered disposal equipment developed by related industrial companies to maintain the discharged water at the first or second degree in quality, so that it is used as river maintenance flow and agricultural water in case a drought occurs.

The city had managed its own recycling service, but privatized it since July 1, 2009.

Other utilities are provided by private entities or South Korean government-owned companies. Seorabeol City Gas, an affiliate of GS Group, provides gas to the Gyeongju residents, while, electrical power is supplied by the public enterprises, Korea Hydro &amp; Nuclear Power via the Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant. The plant is known for the only nuclear power plant operating PHWRs (Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor) in South Korea and supplies about 5% of South Korea&#x27;s electricity. The owner, Korea Hydro &amp; Nuclear Power began to build the Wolseong 1 in the districts of Yangnam-myeon, Yangbuk-myeon and Gampo-eup in 1976. Since 1983, the power plant has been providing commercial service and operating with the PHWRs that has a capacity of 678,000 kW. As the construction of each Wolseong 2, 3 and 4 with a capacity of 70,000 kW were completed respectively in 1997, 1998 and 1999, Wolseong Nuclear Power plant site has been successfully operating the four PHWRs plants. New project, Sinwolseong No. 1 and No. 2 are currently under construction which is estimated to be completed until 2011–12. The Wolseong Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Center, which treats and stores low and intermediate level radioactive waste from the local power plants, is overseen and inspected by the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS).

=== Transportation ===
The city lies at the junction of two minor lines operated by the Korean National Railroad. The Jungang Line runs from Seoul to Gyeongju and carries trains from the Daegu Line, which originates in Dongdaegu. In Gyeongju, the Jungang line connects to the Donghae Line which runs between Busan and Yeongdeok. The Gyeongbu Expressway, which runs from Seoul to Busan, passes through Gyeongju, and Provincial Highway 68, aided by the South Korean government, connects Seocheon in South Chungcheong Province to Gyeongju. Additionally national highways such as Route 4, 7, 14, 20, 28, 31, and 35 crisscross the city. Since the city is a popular tourist destination, nonstop bus services are available from most major cities in South Korea.

High-speed rail does not serve central Gyeongju, but the KTX Gyeongbu Line stops at the nearby Gyeongju station, in Geoncheon-eup, west of Gyeongju&#x27;s city center.
