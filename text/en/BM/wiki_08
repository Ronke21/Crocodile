<text>SilkAir Singapore Private Limited, operating as SilkAir, was a Singaporean regional airline with its head office in Changi, Singapore. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines and in 2017, operated scheduled passenger services from Singapore to 54 cities in Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, East Asia, and Northern Australia. As the regional wing of Singapore Airlines, it served the short to medium-haul destinations in the Singapore Airlines Group network.

By the end of 2021, SilkAir ceased operations, with all flights transferred to its parent company Singapore Airlines or its low-cost affiliate Scoot.

==History==
The airline had its roots as a regional air-charter company as Tradewinds Charters formed in 1975, serving leisure destinations using planes predominantly leased from parent airline Singapore Airlines. Scheduled services were introduced as Tradewinds Airlines on 21 February 1989, when it leased McDonnell Douglas MD-87 aeroplanes for services to 5 destinations: Pattaya, Phuket, Hat Yai, and Kuantan from Singapore&#x27;s Changi Airport, and Tioman from Singapore&#x27;s Seletar Airport. As the carrier matured, regional business destinations such as Jakarta, Phnom Penh, and Yangon were added to its network, thereby broadening the airline&#x27;s appeal beyond the holiday-maker to include the business traveller.

A major marketing overhaul was officially started in 1991 and officially culminating on 1 April 1992 by giving the airline its present name and logo as a new corporate identity officially launching new name and new logo as SilkAir on 1 April 1992. The re-branded airline utilised up to six of the new Boeing 737-300s introduced just a year earlier. The mid-1990s saw two Airbus A310-200 aircraft in use and the expansion of services to India as well as mainland China. It was the first Asian carrier to offer handheld portable video-on-demand (VOD) in-flight entertainment in the form of the &quot;DigEplayer&quot; 5500, available on flights to selected countries.

Four months later, SilkAir officially very first began operations to Indonesia in August same year and has steadily strengthened its network over the years. SilkAir currently serves eleven Indonesian destinations, namely Balikpapan, Bandung, Lombok, Manado, Makassar, Medan, Palembang, Pekanbaru, Semarang, Solo and Surabaya.

On 10 April 2015, SilkAir launched a new collection of uniforms, the fourth uniform change in over 26 years. There are two variations of the uniform - aqua-blue for junior crew and a plum-red version for senior crew. Both variations are accompanied by a dark blue skirt. For the year ending 31 March 2015, the airline flew over 3.5 million passengers and made an operating profit of S$40.8 million. SilkAir announced the appointment of Foo Chai Woo as Chief Executive as of 18 May 2016, succeeding Mr Leslie Thng.

On 29 October 2017, SilkAir took over Scoot&#x27;s services to Yangon. With the transfer, the airline boosted its Yangon operations to 15 non-stop services a week. On 30 October 2017, SilkAir launched its inaugural flight to Hiroshima, marking the first Japanese destination that SilkAir has added to its network. On 22 November 2018, SilkAir announced plans to transfer 17 routes to Scoot including Luang Prabang, Chiang Mai, Kota Kinabalu, Yogyakarta and Wuhan over the months of April 2019 to July 2020, ahead of its merger with Singapore Airlines in the late 2020 or early 2021.

By the end of 2021, SilkAir had ceased operations and gradually finished integration into its parent company, Singapore Airlines.

Throughout its existence, SilkAir operated the following aircraft:

===Fleet development===
SilkAir began operations with one leased McDonnell Douglas MD-87 aircraft in 1989, before investing in its own fleet of six Boeing 737-300s, the first of which began operations in 1990. It operated two Airbus A310-200s for a brief period from 1993 to 1995 before they were transferred to Singapore Airlines, and two Fokker 70s from 1995 to 2000. It began replacing its Boeing fleet with Airbus aircraft when the first Airbus A320-200 arrived on 18 September 1998, and retired all Boeing aircraft a year later. Soon after its first A320 was delivered, SilkAir took delivery of its first A319-100 aircraft on 3 September 1999. The A319 was utilised on certain routes within Southeast Asia, and to some cities in India, while the larger A320 was used on most of the airline&#x27;s major routes. On 20 December 2006, SilkAir signed an agreement to purchase 11 Airbus A320-200 aircraft with nine more on option. These aircraft were delivered between 2009–2012.

On 3 August 2012, SilkAir had signed a letter of intent with Boeing for a purchase of 68 aircraft. The agreement includes a firm order for 23 Boeing 737-800s and 31 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, and purchase rights for another 14 aircraft. On 14 November 2012, the commitment was then converted to a firm order. The 737 aircraft will be used to replace the older A320 fleet and for the expansion of the airline. On 4 February 2014, SilkAir received its first Boeing 737-800 aircraft. On 4 October 2017, SilkAir received its first Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft.

On 21 June 2018, Singapore Airlines announced that it plans to transfer a number of Boeing 737-800 to Scoot between late-2018 to early-2019 to better optimise the overall group&#x27;s network. Following the events of the Boeing 737 MAX, plans to transfer the Boeing 737-800 were suspended in April 2019.

==Services==

=== Cabins ===

There were two classes of cabins available on all SilkAir flights — Business class and Economy class. In 2020, there were new lie-flat seats in Business class, and the installation of seat-back in-flight entertainment systems in both Business and Economy classes.

Business class cabins consisted of leather seats with a seat pitch of between 39 and 40 inches and seat width between 20-22 inches. On Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, the seat pitch was increased significantly to 49 inches in Business Class with additional seat recline.

Economy class cabins had a seat pitch of 31 inches and seat width between 17-18 inches. On Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft there were seat-back tablet and phone holders, and personal in-seat USB charging ports.

=== In-flight entertainment ===

SilkAir offered a selection of newspapers and magazine titles on board and screened a series of short features on its 11-inch overhead dropdown screens. The &quot;Silkwinds&quot; inflight magazine was complimentary for all passengers. In-seat audio and power supply were available exclusively on its Boeing aircraft.

2014 saw the launch of SilkAir Studio as a complimentary wireless streaming service for its passengers. It was first available on its Boeing 737-800 aircraft before being progressively rolled out to its Airbus fleet. This system complemented the existing overhead systems.

SilkAir Studio was introduced in 2014 where passengers were able to stream blockbuster hits, short features, and music, to their personal laptops and handheld devices via Wi-Fi. This system complemented the existing overhead systems. Passengers in Business Class on flights more than two hours were offered a tablet. In May 2017, the service was enhanced and upgraded to offer more than 150 international blockbuster movies and TV sitcom shows available on SilkAir Studio. For Apple users, the SilkAir Studio app had to be downloaded prior to flight in order to enjoy the in-flight entertainment.

=== Dining ===
SilkAir offered Oriental and Western menus. Light snacks were also available on selected flights of less than one and a half hours. SilkAir launched their &quot;All-Time Favourites&quot; dishes in July 2016 where they served a selection of Asian, Western and local cuisine such as Nasi Lemak, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Beef Tenderloin, etc. that Business Class passengers could pre-book meals before their flight.

===Frequent-flyer programs===
SilkAir shared the KrisFlyer frequent flyer program with its parent company, Singapore Airlines. However, unlike Singapore Airlines, SilkAir is not a member of Star Alliance, so frequent flyer miles on SilkAir flights may only be credited on the KrisFlyer programme, but not on other Star Alliance frequent flyer programs.

==Tradewinds Tours and Travel==
Tradewinds Tours and Travel Private Limited was a wholly owned subsidiary of SilkAir, providing package tours to destinations flown by the airline, as well as chartered flights within the Asia region. The company was incorporated in 1975, and became a fully licensed tour operator in 1984.

SilkAir, the regional wing of Singapore Airlines, was once known as Tradewinds Charters at its founding in 1976, before earning its present name in 1991. The chartered operations hence continued to be handled by Tradewinds Tours and Travel.

==Accidents and incidents ==

=== SilkAir Flight 185 ===
On 19 December 1997, SilkAir Flight 185 registered as 9V-TRF, operated on a Boeing 737-300 and piloted by Captain Tsu Way Ming, plunged into the Musi River in Sumatra during a routine flight from Jakarta to Singapore, killing all 104 people on board. The crash was investigated by various groups, with different results. The Indonesian NTSC, who were lead investigators, stated that they were unable to determine the cause, while the U.S. NTSB concluded that the crash resulted from an intentional act by a pilot, most likely the captain. A civil lawsuit case against Parker Hannifin, the manufacturer of the PCU-dual servo unit essential in the 737&#x27;s rudder control—and also suspected in causing the crashes of United Airlines Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427 under similar flight-event parameters, had provided the NTSB the initial test results of the recovered PCU-dual servo unit from Flight 185 in 1997, but was later further independently investigated for litigation on behalf some families of Flight 185 passengers in a civil lawsuit against Parker Hannifin. The jury under the Superior Court in Los Angeles in 2004, which was not allowed to hear or consider the NTSB conclusions, decided that the crash was caused by a prominent issue inherent in other 737 crashes: a defective servo valve inside the Power Control Unit (PCU) which controls the aircraft&#x27;s rudder, causing a rudder hard-over and a subsequent uncontrollable crash. The manufacturer of the aircraft&#x27;s rudder controls and the families later reached an out of court settlement. It is the only fatal hull loss for SilkAir in its history.

<doc id="411929" wikidata="Q1545459" url="?curid=411929" title="The Easybeats">
<text>The Easybeats were an Australian rock band which formed in Sydney in late 1964. They are best known for their 1966 hit single &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot;, which is regarded as the first Australian rock song to achieve international success; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as &quot;the first international victory for Oz rock&quot;. One of the most popular and successful bands in the country, they were one of the few Australian bands of their time to foreground their original material; their first album &quot;Easy&quot; (1965) was one of the earliest Australian rock albums featuring all original songs.

The five founding members, all migrants from Europe, met at the Villawood Migrant Hostel in Sydney in 1964. They rose to national prominence in 1965 with the song &quot;She&#x27;s So Fine&quot;, which reached number three in Australia. Their concerts and public appearances were marked by an intense fanaticism frequently compared to Beatlemania; this phenomenon was subsequently dubbed &quot;Easyfever&quot;. They relocated to the UK in 1966, where they recorded &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot;. Following its success, the band struggled to maintain international recognition. Compounded by financial and contractual issues, drug use and the increasing independence of guitarists and songwriters Harry Vanda and George Young, they returned to Australia in 1969 amid declining popularity back home and subsequently disbanded.

Lead singer Stevie Wright started a solo career and had a number one Australian hit with &quot;Evie&quot; in 1974; he died in 2015 after lengthy battles with drugs and alcohol and years of poor health. Guitarists Vanda and Young continued as a songwriting and producing duo and produced several albums by AC/DC; Young died in 2017. During their six-year run, they scored 15 top 40 hits in Australia, including &quot;She&#x27;s So Fine&quot; and &quot;Women (Make You Feel Alright)&quot;, with number-one hits including &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot; and &quot;Sorry&quot;. They reunited for a tour in 1986. In 2005, they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame.

==History==
===19641965: formation, Albert Productions and early success===
All five founder members were from families which had migrated to Australia from Europe: lead singer Stevie Wright and drummer Gordon &quot;Snowy&quot; Fleet were English-born; rhythm guitarist George Young was Scottish-born; lead guitarist Harry Vanda and bassist Dick Diamonde were Dutch-born. The band formed at the Villawood Migrant Hostel. The families of the band members spent their first years in Australia housed at the hostel in the early and mid-sixties.

The Easybeats&#x27; first gigs were in late 1964 at a music venue called Beatle Village, located in the basement of the Courthouse Hotel in Taylor Square in Darlinghurst, Sydney. The band were inspired by the &quot;British Invasion&quot; spearheaded by the Beatles. The Easybeats quickly rose to become one of the most popular groups in the city. Real estate agent turned pop music entrepreneur Mike Vaughan became their manager. Through his efforts, they were signed to a contract with Albert Productions, one of Australia&#x27;s first independent record production companies. The company was established by Ted Albert, whose family owned J. Albert &amp; Sons, a prominent music publishing company. Albert signed the band to a recording contract with EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label. The group recorded a number of songs at the 2UW Theatre, owned by the parent company of Albert Productions, J. Albert and Son. They chose the bluesy &quot;For My Woman&quot; as their first single. It was picked up by Sydney radio and became a minor hit, reaching No. 33 on the charts.

===19651966: rise to success and Easyfever===
====&quot;She&#x27;s So Fine&quot;, &quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s 2 Easy&quot;====
Although &quot;For My Woman&quot; gained them some attention, the band felt they needed a more up-tempo song to break through commercially. Their next single, &quot;She&#x27;s So Fine&quot;, gave them that commercial success, reaching No. 3 on the Australian charts and launching them to national stardom. Their concerts and public appearances were regularly marked by intense fan hysteria similar to &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, soon dubbed &quot;Easyfever&quot; by the Australian press.

The band&#x27;s follow-up single, the high-energy &quot;Wedding Ring&quot;, released on 26 August 1965, was also a hit, reaching No. 7. On 23 September 1965, the group released its first album, &quot;Easy&quot;. It was one of the earliest albums of all original material written by an Australian rock group. All the songs were written by group members, with vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young co-writing eight of the fourteen songs on the album.

For the next single, &quot;Sad and Lonely and Blue&quot;, the band returned to the blues based feel of &quot;For My Woman&quot;. However, like &quot;For My Woman&quot;, it failed to make the top 10, only reaching No. 21. Both &quot;Wedding Ring&quot; and &quot;Sad and Lonely and Blue&quot; were included on the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;It&#x27;s 2 Easy&quot;, released 24 March 1966. The lead singles from that album, &quot;Women (Make You Feel Alright)&quot; and &quot;Come and See Her&quot;, put the group back in the top 10, reaching No. 4 and No. 3 respectively on the Australian charts. This time, Stevie Wright and George Young wrote all fourteen songs on the album. The Wright-Young songwriting team also wrote songs for other artists at this time, including &quot;Step Back&quot;, which became a No. 1 hit for Johnny Young (no relation) in 1966.

====United Artists Records and &quot;Volume 3&quot;====
In early 1966, while the group was still touring Australia, manager Mike Vaughan flew to New York City to attempt to secure an American recording contract for the band. Despite an initial lack of interest, Vaughan was able to convince United Artists Records to sign the band. Just before relocating to London in 1966, they recorded a farewell TV special for the Seven Network, titled &quot;The Easybeats&quot; (more commonly known as &quot;The Coca-Cola Special&quot;), one of the few surviving appearances from the band&#x27;s career during this period. The group left for the UK on 10 July 1966.

In August 1966, Albert Productions released an EP of material recorded before the group left Australia. Titled &quot;Easyfever&quot;, it reach No. 1 on the Australian singles charts. Albert Productions then released an entire album of material titled &quot;Volume 3&quot; on 3 November 1966. This too was a commercial success and its lead single, &quot;Sorry&quot;, topped the Australian charts. Again, Stevie Wright and George Young wrote all thirteen songs on the album.

===19661967: international success===
====Shel Talmy, Vanda &amp; Young and &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot;====
After arriving in London the band recorded a number of songs with Ted Albert at EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios, but these were deemed unsuitable by United Artists Records and Albert was removed as producer. The band was then teamed with freelance producer Shel Talmy, who had achieved great success with his production for the Who and the Kinks. United Artists also felt that the band&#x27;s song writing was too &quot;unsophisticated&quot; for the competitive UK market. The label had already released the Wright/Young composition &quot;Come And See Her&quot; as a single in the UK on 15 July and it had not sold well. Dutch-born Vanda, now having a stronger grasp of English, replaced Wright as Young&#x27;s song writing partner at this point.

After auditioning several titles for Talmy, &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot; caught the producer&#x27;s ear as the next single. The band recorded the song with Talmy at IBC Studios, London in September. &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot; was released in the UK on 14 October 1966. It reached #6 on the UK Charts making it the group&#x27;s first big international hit. The song charted in multiple countries: No. 1 in Australia, No. 13 in Canada, No. 16 in the US, and the Top 10 in Germany, the Netherlands and France, and sold over one million copies worldwide. It was awarded a gold disc.

===19671969: decline in popularity and break-up===
====Following up &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot;, &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go&quot; and the scrapped album====
On 17 March 1967, United Artists released the follow-up single to &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot;; &quot;Who&#x27;ll Be The One&quot;. The single was a commercial failure and did not make the UK charts (although it was No. 14 in Australia). The band was against releasing the single to begin with, as they felt it was not a strong enough track to follow &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot;. Later that month, they toured Europe in support of The Rolling Stones.

During this period, the band was filmed by Australian director Peter Clifton for a proposed documentary for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Filmed under the title &quot;Between Heaven and Hell&quot; (which was later changed to &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go&quot;), the documentary was lost for nearly 42 years. It was restored, reedited and shown at film festivals in 2012.

In May, their first album for United Artists was released: &quot;Good Friday&quot; (re-titled &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot; in the US). That same month, they returned to Australia for a nationwide tour. After the tour, drummer Snowy Fleet decided to quit the band. Fleet was unhappy at the amount of time he had to spend away from his wife and young children. Returning to the UK without a drummer, the group began several recordings with a session drummer, Freddie Smith – a Glaswegian who had played with George Young&#x27;s older brother Alex (stage name George Alexander) in Bobby Patrick &amp; The Big Six.

During this period, the band recorded their next single, &quot;Heaven And Hell&quot;, which marked a turning point for the group, with its sophisticated songwriting and arrangements. Vanda and Young were influenced by the current psychedelic pop, popular in the UK and US. The single was produced by Glyn Johns, who had worked as an engineer on the Shel Talmy sessions. The band also began work on a new album with Johns, most of which was recorded and prepared for issue but was never released because of the band&#x27;s complicated financial and contractual problems.

&quot;Heaven And Hell&quot; was released in June and, like the previous single, it also failed to make a mark on the UK charts. This was due, in part, to the song being banned by the BBC. The single also ran into problems in the US, where a censored version titled &quot;Heaven&quot;, replaced the lyric &quot;Discovering someone else in your bed&quot; with &quot;discovering that her love has gone dead&quot;. In Australia the single did much better; reaching #8.

After extensive auditions in London a replacement drummer was found in Tony Cahill (born 20 December 1941) who had formerly played with Brisbane band The Purple Hearts. With Cahill, the band toured the US in August, supporting Gene Pitney. During their US visit, they recorded their next single, &quot;Falling Off the Edge of the World&quot;, in New York. The single received moderate airplay in the US, but did not chart.

====&quot;Vigil&quot;====

The band returned to London and continued to work in the studio. Their next single, &quot;The Music Goes &#x27;Round My Head&quot;, again written by Vanda and Young, is considered to have been influenced by the emerging UK Rocksteady/Ska scene. In late 1967, Vanda and Young began writing for other artists. Two of their songs, &quot;Bring a Little Lovin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Come In, You&#x27;ll Get Pneumonia&quot;, were covered by Los Bravos (and later by Ricky Martin as &quot;Dime Que Me Quieres&quot;) and Paul Revere and The Raiders respectively. Still trying to get back into the UK charts, the band moved to a more pop-friendly sound and released the soft rock, ballad &quot;Hello, How Are You&quot; on 8 March 1968. The plan worked and the song reached #20 in the UK charts. However, in retrospect, the band have cited the change in sound as a mistake, stating that it alienated the band&#x27;s longterm fans.

In May, the band finally released their second album for United Artists; &quot;Vigil&quot; (re-titled &quot;Falling Off The Edge of the World&quot; in the US). The album was a mixture of recent singles, new recordings and out-takes from the scrapped 1967 album. Two of the songs recorded for the abandoned LP, &quot;Land of Make Believe&quot; and &quot;Good Times&quot;, were released as singles. The baroque pop ballad &quot;Land of Make Believe&quot; was released in the UK on 5 July and in Australia on 18 July. Although failing to chart in the UK, it reached No. 18 on the Australian charts. The B-side to the Australian single was the next UK single; &quot;Good Times&quot;. Released on 13 September, &quot;Good Times&quot; again failed to chart in the UK. An often-told story about the song is that when the track was broadcast on BBC radio, it was reputedly heard by Paul McCartney on his car radio; McCartney apparently rang the station immediately to request a repeat playing. The song featured Steve Marriott of the Small Faces on backing vocals and Nicky Hopkins on piano. In November, Albert Productions released the UK B-side to &quot;Good Times&quot;, the instrumental track &quot;Lay Me Down and Die&quot;, as a single in Australia. The single was slammed by critics and reached #59 on the Australian chart; their lowest-charting single to date.

Through late 1968, the formerly tight-knit band began to drift apart. Drugs were a factor, but the growing independence of the Vanda and Young team as a creative unit was also a major catalyst. By this time the duo were working substantially on their own and between them they could now play almost any instrument needed for recordings and had become skilled in engineering and producing their own recordings. They wrote prolifically, but many of their songs from this period remained unreleased for many years. They were also reluctant to do more than a few gigs per month, and so the band only came together for occasional performances or for &#x27;demo&#x27; sessions at Central Sound Studios in Denmark Street.

====New contract with Polydor and &quot;St. Louis&quot;====
In 1969, the band parted ways with United Artists and their production company Albert Productions to sign with Polydor Records. In April, the group went into London&#x27;s Olympic Studios to record their first single for Polydor. They teamed up with producer Ray Singer, a former member of UK band Nirvana, who had made a name for himself as a producer with Peter Sarstedt&#x27;s &quot;Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)&quot;. &quot;St. Louis&quot; was released on 27 June 1969, but failed to chart in the UK. However it reached No. 21 on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; charts in Australia. In July 1969, it was announced that the working relationship between manager Mike Vaughan and the group had come to an end.

To continue their work as songwriters for hire, Vanda and Young took over a flat on Moscow Road in Bayswater in London which had previously been used as a jingle studio for pirate radio stations. With modifications, it became a 4-track home studio and Vanda and Young began producing demos, working mostly on their own. As with their Central Sound records, they played most of the instruments on their recordings with the other Easybeats members occasionally contributing. Nine of these demo recordings (with single &quot;St. Louis&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Find Love&quot;) were released by Polydor as an album under The Easybeats&#x27; name as &quot;Friends&quot;. This album was released after their break-up.

====Final Australian tour and break-up====
In September 1969, the band undertook a short European tour and then reluctantly accepted the offer of a five-week Australian tour. The tour was reported as being a last-ditch attempt to bail the group out of its mounting pool of debts.

A number of factors made the Australian tour less than successful. Rather than playing larger venues as they did on the 1967 tour, the band was booked to play mainly smaller clubs and dance halls. Also, the band had reverted to &#x27;no frills&#x27; hard rock whereas the Australian pop scene was preoccupied with progressive rock, soul, and bubblegum pop.

The situation was further complicated by Albert Productions&#x27; unwelcome release (against the band&#x27;s wishes) of several lo-fi demo recordings on &quot;The Best of The Easybeats Volume 2&quot;. The recordings were songwriter demos sent to Albert Productions in 1967 and 1968 for other artists to record. &quot;Peculiar Hole in the Sky&quot; from that album was released as a single, it was originally recorded by Australian band the Valentines.

In October 1969 the band made a valedictory TV appearance in the ATN-7 Easybeats Special (which was broadcast after the tour on 2 November). After their performance at Caesar&#x27;s Place Disco, Sydney, on 25 October, a wedding was held for Diamonde and actress Charlene Collins. The following day, the Easybeats travelled to Orange, New South Wales. There they made a television appearance at the CBN-8 television studios and performed a show at the Amoco Centre in Orange city centre. However, the show was interrupted by hostile audience members and was cancelled after only 20 minutes. This was The Easybeats&#x27; final performance. After the tour, the band went their separate ways.

===1969present: post break-up===
====1970s: Vanda &amp; Young and Wright&#x27;s solo commercial success====
=====Vanda and Young=====
Vanda and Young returned to the UK and remained there for three years, working to pay off debts incurred during The Easybeats&#x27; years. During the period 1970-74 they recorded under a number of names: Paintbox, Tramp, Eddie Avana, Moondance, Haffy&#x27;s Whisky Sour, Vanda &amp; Young, Band of Hope and the Marcus Hook Roll Band. They returned to Australia in 1973 and reunited with Ted Albert and became the house producers for his new Albert Productions record label, writing for and/or producing many chart-topping acts including Stevie Wright, Rose Tattoo, Cheetah, the Angels and William Shakespeare.

They wrote and produced several major hits for John Paul Young including &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot; and &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Hero&quot;, which was also a hit for The Bay City Rollers, and produced the first six albums for AC/DC (which featured George&#x27;s younger brothers Angus Young and Malcolm Young).

In the period 1976-92 Vanda and Young also recorded several singles under the pseudonym Flash and the Pan which charted in Australia and the UK, including &quot;Hey St. Peter&quot; and &quot;Down Among the Dead Men&quot;. They had even more success in Europe with hits such as &quot;Waiting for a Train&quot;, &quot;Midnight Man&quot;, &quot;Early Morning Wake Up Call&quot;, and &quot;Ayla&quot;, from the number 1 albums &quot;Early Morning Wake Up Call&quot;, &quot;Headlines&quot;, and &quot;Nights in France&quot;. Singer-model-actress Grace Jones also recorded a successful cover version of their song &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot;.

=====Stevie Wright=====
Stevie Wright went on to become a cast member of the original Australian stage production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1972–73) and then launched a successful but short-lived solo career with the hit single &quot;Evie&quot; and the album &quot;Hard Road&quot; in 1974, which reunited him with Vanda and Young, who produced the records and wrote many of the songs, including &quot;Evie&quot;, an ambitious three-part suite split over two sides of a single.

In later years Wright suffered debilitating drug and alcohol problems which were further exacerbated by his self-admission to the notorious Chelmsford Private Hospital in Sydney. Its director, Dr Harry Bailey, administered a highly controversial treatment known as &quot;deep sleep therapy&quot; which allegedly cured drug addiction with a combination of drug-induced coma and electroshock. Many patients, including Wright, suffered brain damage and lifelong after-effects, while others died as a result of the treatments.

=====Snowy Fleet, Tony Cahill and Dick Diamonde=====
Original drummer Gordon &quot;Snowy&quot; Fleet became a successful builder in Perth, Western Australia, and now runs a rehearsal studio based in Jandakot, Western Australia. His replacement, Tony Cahill, remained in the UK for a time, briefly joining the final studio lineup of Python Lee Jackson as a bassist, before moving to the United States to tour with King Harvest.

Dick Diamonde moved to the New South Wales North Coast and retired from performing, after some years of singing and playing in local pubs.

====1980s: Solo careers and the Easybeats reunion tour====
In 1980, Flash and the Pan released their second album &quot;Lights in the Night&quot;. Their next album, &quot;Headlines&quot; was released in August 1982. This featured the singles &quot;Waiting for a Train&quot; which reached #7 on the UK Charts and &quot;Where Were You&quot;. The music video for &quot;Where Were You&quot; featured Stevie Wright as a futuristic rock star miming to George Young&#x27;s vocals. Wright also provided vocals for the album. That same year there was talk of an Easybeats&#x27; reunion. Wright told Juke Magazine in 1983 &quot;we had our lawyers working out the deal&quot; because there was a venue interested in having them &quot;but at the last minute they tried to change the venue and we just said &#x27;forget it&#x27;.&quot;

In 1983, there was a talk of a solo album with work done again with Vanda and Young. Wright said the album would best be described as &quot;classy rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; and the songs were about &quot;a wide spectrum of all the experiences I&#x27;ve been through&quot;. He said the love songs he had were optimistic. This interview gives a good idea as to how Wright worked in the studio with Vanda and Young: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s a three way thing. They&#x27;ll sit down and say &#x27;we&#x27;ve got this sort of song&#x27; and we&#x27;ll discuss how we&#x27;ll approach it. Obviously after this long we do have a very strong bond. I&#x27;ve written a couple of songs but since they&#x27;re far better at it than I am, I&#x27;ll let them handle that.&quot; According to the Juke Magazine article it was &quot;due for release later that year&quot;, however this never happened.

In January 1984, Wright was charged with attempted housebreaking days after attending Westmount drug rehabilitation centre in Katoomba, west of Sydney. He was arrested for heroin use later that month. He had been using heroin since about 1973, and, according to Wright, he remained an addict for 20 years. Also that year, Flash and the Pan&#x27;s next album, &quot;Early Morning Wake Up Call&quot;, was released.

In November 1986, the original line-up reunited for an Australian tour. The tour was warmly received by critics and fans. Wright reformed the Stevie Wright Band and relaunched his live career, gigging around Australia in hotels and clubs between 1986 and 1988. In 1987, Flash and the Pan released their fifth album, &quot;Nights in France&quot;.

Vanda and Young returned to producing AC/DC on their 1988 album &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot;.

====1990s and beyond: semi-retirement====
In 1992 Flash and the Pan released their final album &quot;Burning Up The Night&quot;. Wright&#x27;s substance abuse problems spiralled out of control in the 1980s and 1990s and he came close to death on several occasions, but was pulled back from the brink by his partner, Faye. In 1999 journalist Jack Marx published a much-anticipated book about Wright, entitled &quot;Sorry - The Wretched Tale of Little Stevie Wright&quot;. It was critically applauded by some reviewers - Australian music historian Clinton Walker calling it &quot;gonzo journalism at its best&quot;, while &quot;The Bulletin&quot; later referred to &quot;Sorry&quot; as &quot;one of the most harrowing rock books ever written&quot;.
Nevertheless, &quot;Sorry&quot; earned the disdain of its subject, Wright&#x27;s many fans and other critics. Internet reviewer Ken Grady (Luna Cafe, 1999) described Marx as &quot;a self serving hypocrite&quot; and concluded his review by observing: &quot;The only thing that Marx has achieved is to depict himself as a very unlikeable, morally bankrupt leech.&quot;

The 2000s saw a band calling itself &quot;The Easybeats&quot; tour and make TV appearances around Europe. No members were in any line-up of the Australian band or played on any of the records, despite the lead singer using a similar name. In addition, another English cover band has taken the Easybeats name, while also having no members who were in the Australian band or played on any of the original recordings. In 2000, George Young produced AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; album. It was the first time he had worked with the group without Harry Vanda co-producing.

Due to his health, Wright only performed a small number of shows in the 2000s, although in 2002 he was well enough to perform as part of the all-star &quot;Long Way to the Top&quot; national concert tour. His autobiography, &quot;Hard Road&quot;, was published in 2004. In 2007, Stevie Wright performed at the Gathering Festival in Yandina, Sunshine Coast. On 31 January 2009, Wright closed the Legends of Rock festival in Byron Bay, Australia. On 14 July 2005, the Easybeats were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Wright, Vanda and Snowy Fleet attended the ceremony.

Cahill died in Sydney on 13 August 2014, as the result of a brain tumour.

After falling ill on 26 December 2015, Wright was admitted to hospital on the South Coast of New South Wales, Australia. He did not recover and died on the evening the next day.

George Young died on 22 October 2017.

Dick Diamonde died on 18 September 2024, at the age of 76. 

Snowy Fleet died on 18 February 2025, at the age of 85.

<text>Thirty-one or Trente et un is a gambling card game played by two to seven people, where players attempt to assemble a hand which totals 31. Such a goal has formed the whole or part of various games like Commerce, Cribbage, Trentuno, and Wit and Reason since the 15th century. 
31 is popular in America and Britain.

Although the game is also known as Scat it has no connection whatsoever with Germany&#x27;s national card game of Skat. It should also not be confused with other games called 31 including Schwimmen (also known as Schnauz or Hosen &#x27;runter) and the Greek banking game of 31.

== Name ==
The object is to obtain a hand with a value total as close as possible to 31, from which the name of the game is taken.

The game is also known as Blitz, Scat, Cadillac in south Louisiana and Mississippi, Cad in Pennsylvania, Whammy! in central Indiana, Juble in Oklahoma and Kansas, as also as Kitty, High Hat, Ride the Bus and Geronimo. The game is also known as Nickle Knock in Hawaii.

== History ==
Thirty-One is first mentioned in a French translation of a 1440 sermon by the Italian, Saint Bernadine, so may be of Italian origin. It is mentioned by Rabelais, Cardano and numerous other 16th century sources, but David Parlett notes that the name referred to two different card games – one like Pontoon and one like Commerce.

The game spread rapidly across Europe to become popular in France, England and Ireland and is a precursor to Vingt-Un. In the 1670s, Francis Willughby recorded Thirty-One being played in England.

==Gameplay==

Thirty-one uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards (in the Dutch version - &quot;Eenendertigen&quot; - only 32 cards - 7 and higher - are used). Aces are high, counting 11, court cards count 10, and all other cards count face value. Each player gets a hand of three cards, and three pennies as their &quot;lives&quot;. The rest of the deck sits in the middle of the table as stock for the game, and the top card of the stock is turned over to begin the discard.

After the hands in the first round are dealt, play proceeds with each player, starting with the player to the immediate left of the dealer and going clockwise around the table, taking the top card of either the stock or the discard and subsequently discarding a card. All players are trying to collect a hand value of 31 (or the nearest to it) in the same suit. Play continues clockwise around the table until any player knocks or obtains a &quot;blitz&quot;.

When it is a player&#x27;s turn, and that player believes their hand is high enough to beat at least one other opponent, that player may knock on the table in lieu of drawing and discarding. Once a player knocks, all other players, going clockwise from the player who knocked, have one more turn to draw from the stock and discard, or have the option of keeping all three cards in their hands, known as &quot;standing&quot;. The round ends when the player to the right of the player who knocked has had a final turn. If no one knocks by the time a player exhausts the stock, the round ends in a draw. Because knocking relies on the confidence that the player will not have the lowest score, a skilled player may memorise which suits the other players are discarding. If a player discards a different suit than that which they discarded their previous turn, it can be inferred that the player is &quot;changing suits&quot;. Changing suits puts a player at a distinct disadvantage because the resulting lowered score raises the risk that another player may knock.

At the end of the round, all players show their hands and total each one up, only counting cards of the same suit. For instance, if the three cards in a hand are all different suits, the highest value card would stand as that player&#x27;s score. The player whose hand scored the lowest loses the deal, and loses one life. In the event of a tie between two players for lowest score, both players are declared losers and each loses one life. If there is a tie involving the knocker for the lowest score, the knocker is safe. If the knocker does not have a higher value than at least one other player, the knocker loses two lives. 

If, at any time in the round prior to someone knocking, a player acquires a hand value of exactly 31 in the same suit, known as a &quot;blitz&quot;, their hand is immediately shown. This ends the round and all other players lose a life.

There is one case where it is possible to pick up one&#x27;s own discard. This happens when there are only two players left in the game and one player knocks. The card that the other player discarded just before the knock is still on top of the pile, so it is now available to take back if desired. For example, if the player had just broken up a suit for tactical reasons, they can now restore it.

===Scoring===

When a player loses a life, they pay one of their pennies into the centre of the table. A player with no pennies left is said to be &quot;on the county&quot;, and is out of the game if they lose any further lives. The game continues until only one player remains.

==Common variations==

===Banking===
The play is the same as the regular version of Thirty-one described above, but with the following changes. Before each round, each player has to ante one token or coin onto the centre of the table. While dealing, after each player has received one card, the dealer puts one card face down on the table to form a pile of three cards known as the &quot;widow&quot;. A player may use a turn to exchange one or more cards in their hand with an equivalent number of cards in the widow, leaving the cards they put in the widow face up.

At the end of the round, the player with the highest-valued hand takes all the tokens or coins on the table. If any player acquires a blitz in their hand, they immediately show it, the round ends, all other players place one token or coin on the table, and the player who blitzed takes all of the tokens or coins on the table.

===Dollar bill===

In this US version, players keep track of their lives by folding down the corners of a five-dollar note. The five-dollar note is also their stake in the game. (This can be substituted with other denominations or currency.)

A player who has folded all four corners of their bill, continues to play on a &quot;free ride&quot;, also sometimes called &quot;on the bike&quot;. On losing again, the player drops out of the game. The last player in the game wins all the five dollar bills.

===Three-of-a-kind===

One optional rule is that if a player has three cards of the same value from different suits, the hand is worth 30.5 points.

===West Lansing Cut Throat===
The play is the same as the regular version of Thirty-one described above, but with the following changes:

*Three tokens are purchased for the agreed upon amount of money prior to play beginning, and the last player with any tokens wins the pot. 
*There is no &quot;free ride&quot;. A player who knocks but does not beat at least one other player, pays two tokens. In this scenario the knocker tying for the lowest score will lose two tokens. All others with the same total as the knocker will not lose a token.
*Three cards of the same rank count as a score of 30½, however all hands ranking as 30½ are equal and considered a tie, E.g. 2,2,2 and A,A,A.

Side wagers between individual players are quite common and often encouraged. Typically the first players knocked out will often choose an active player and place a &quot;side bet&quot; on which player will win or go further in the game.

===Switch===
The goal of the game is the same as in normal Thirty-One. The difference for this version called Switch is that instead of picking from the pile or the discard up-card, players exchange cards from two hands on the table. At the beginning of the game, the dealer is dealt two hands, and one extra hand is dealt and placed in the middle of the table face-down. The dealer looks at both hands and chooses the hand they want to play with and places the other hand face-up next to the face-down hand. Then it is the turn of the player next to the dealer.

During a turn, a player has four options:
* Pick up a certain card in one of the hands on the table and exchange it for one of the cards held in their hand (if they pick up a face-down card, their discard will be face-up).
* Swap one of the hands entirely with their own hand.
* Renew one of the hands on the table. (If they renew a hand on the table, they have the choice to place it face-up or face-down. If they choose face-up, their turn is over; if they choose face-down their turn continues.)
* &quot;Nock&quot;. Nocking applies the same as it does in the normal game.

At the end of the game, the winner is decided in the same way as in the normal game of Thirty-One, although if a player has a hand of three cards of the same suit and is greater than 21, they may choose to restart the game making their hand the new face-up hand for the new game and re-dealing all hands for the other players and the face-down hand.

===No-elimination variant ===

This is a version which uses a running total instead of money or tokens. After each round of the game, each player earns points for a running total as follows:

* Lowest score in the round: 1 point (or 0 if that player Knocked)
* Middle score(s) in the round: 2 points (or 1 if that player Knocked)
* Highest score in the round: 3 points (or 4 if that player Knocked)
* Blitz (31) – 6 points

All ties get highest score possible. For instance, a tally of 30, 27, 27, 27 means 30 is high, and all 27s are middle (no low score for that hand).

===Stop the Bus===

Stop the Bus is a game common in England that uses the hand rankings from three card brag, instead of scoring closest to 31. The hand rankings are: three of a kind (a &quot;prial&quot;) as the best hand, followed by a running flush, then a run, then a flush, then a pair followed by a high card. If a hand is otherwise similar then the card is ranked by high card or high pair, then by middle card or kicker, then low card. Suits are irrelevant.

Instead of drawing from a stock, the game starts with three face-up cards on the tables. On their turn, players may swap one or three cards from their hand for the table cards.

<doc id="411941" wikidata="Q1915791" url="?curid=411941" title="Alex Kidd in Shinobi World">
<text>Alex Kidd in Shinobi World is a side-scrolling action game from Sega for the Master System in 1990. Developed in Japan, it was released for the overseas market (North America, Europe and Brazil). The game stars Alex Kidd in a parody version of Sega&#x27;s ninja-themed action game &quot;Shinobi&quot;, where Alex Kidd fights against caricatures of many of the enemies from &quot;Shinobi&quot;. It was re-released for the Wii Virtual Console on December 11, 2009 in Europe, and on February 1, 2010 in North America.

==Gameplay==
Despite being part of the &quot;Alex Kidd&quot; series, the game mechanics of &quot;Shinobi World&quot; are different from &quot;Alex Kidd in Miracle World&quot; and are much closer to the Master System version of &quot;Shinobi&quot;. Alex Kidd&#x27;s basic attack is a sword slice, which can be used not only to destroy enemies but also to open treasure chests. Inside such chests, the player can obtain items such as more health, throwing darts, a powered-up sword, extra lives, and a magic ball that will temporarily turn Alex Kidd into an invincible tornado. The throwing darts and powered-up sword will both replace the Alex&#x27;s default sword until the player completes the stage, defeats a boss or loses a life. Other actions that Alex Kidd can perform include a wall-to-wall jump and the ability to turn into a flying fireball after spinning around a street post, a rope or a horizontal bar.

Alex starts off each round with three hit points but can fill out his health gauge to a maximum of six hit points. When the player has full health, all the treasure chests carrying hearts will carry extra lives in their place. When the player defeats a boss with full health, they will gain a &quot;Perfect Bonus&quot; after completing the round. There is also a &quot;Secret Bonus&quot; if the player completes an entire round without getting hit or losing life at any point.

The game is composed of four different rounds roughly based on the missions from the original &quot;Shinobi&quot;, which are divided into three stages. The third stage in each round is a boss battle.

==Story==
An evil being known as Hanzo the Dark Ninja escapes after 10,000 years of confinement and kidnaps Alex Kidd&#x27;s new girlfriend, while the pair are on a leisurely trip to the planet Shinobi. Powerless to stop the villain, Alex collapses into a sobbing heap, but is found by the ghost of the ancient warrior who originally vanquished the Dark Ninja, who explains that Hanzo intends to sacrifice Alex&#x27;s girlfriend as part of a ritual to conquer the world. The spirit of the ancient warrior fuses itself with Alex&#x27;s body; lending Alex his strength, skills, and courage; and with their combined power, they set out to save Alex&#x27;s girlfriend and vanquish the Dark Ninja once and for all.

== Development ==
In 2007, images and articles began to surface on the internet, that like &quot;Alex Kidd: High-Tech World&quot;, Alex Kidd was not originally intended to be the star of the game. Rather, the game was initially devised to be a &quot;cute&quot; parody of &quot;Shinobi&quot;, in a similar vein as &quot;Kid Dracula&quot; is to &quot;Castlevania&quot;, &quot;Parodius&quot; is to &quot;Gradius&quot; and &quot;Star Parodier&quot; is to &quot;Star Soldier&quot;.

The boss of Round 1, called Kabuto in the released version of the game, also had a different design in the prototype. He was originally named &quot;Mari-Oh&quot; and was designed as a pastiche of Mario, the mascot of rival game developer Nintendo. The character behaved like a combination of Mario and the &quot;Shinobi&quot; villain Ken-Oh, hence the name. Mari-Oh shares two qualities with his Nintendo namesake: he attacks the player by shooting bouncing fireballs and after sustaining enough damage, he shrinks to a smaller size. Although Mari-Oh was renamed Kabuto in the finished, with a redesign that downplayed his likeness to Mario, his attack pattern remained unchanged from the prototype.

==Reception==
&quot;Alex Kidd in Shinobi World&quot; was critically acclaimed upon release. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine gave the game a score of 92% in its September 1990 issue. The reviewer Robert Swan stated that the &quot;game is brill! A combination of &quot;Alex Kidd in Miracle World&quot; and &quot;Shinobi&quot;&quot; that &quot;works really well.&quot; He praised the playability that &quot;becomes progressively more difficult as you go along,&quot; and concluded that it is a &quot;great game&quot; overall. In 1991, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; described the game as &quot;probably the best in the Alex series so far&quot; and &quot;a hilarious mixture of Alex Kidd and Shinobi.&quot; &quot;Sega Pro&quot; magazine gave the game a score of 88% in its inaugural November 1991 issue, describing it as a &quot;huge game&quot; with &quot;so much to do that addiction is guaranteed.&quot;

Retrospectively, Allgame gave a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, praising the game for being a successful combination of both &quot;Shinobi&quot; and the &quot;Alex Kidd&quot; games, including the game characters and game music from &quot;Shinobi&quot; while retaining the platforming style from &quot;Alex Kidd&quot;, although giving criticism to the gameplay especially boss attack patterns and jumps being obvious and too easy for older experienced players.

<text>Human biology is an interdisciplinary area of academic study that examines humans through the influences and interplay of many diverse fields such as genetics, evolution, physiology, anatomy, epidemiology, anthropology, ecology, nutrition, population genetics, and sociocultural influences. It is closely related to the biomedical sciences, biological anthropology and other biological fields tying in various aspects of human functionality. It wasn&#x27;t until the 20th century when biogerontologist, Raymond Pearl, founder of the journal &quot;Human Biology&quot;, phrased the term &quot;human biology&quot; in a way to describe a separate subsection apart from biology.

It is also a portmanteau term that describes all biological aspects of the human body, typically using the human body as a type organism for Mammalia, and in that context it is the basis for many undergraduate University degrees and modules.

Most aspects of human biology are identical or very similar to general mammalian biology. In particular, and as examples, humans : 
* maintain their body temperature
* have an internal skeleton
* have a circulatory system
* have a nervous system to provide sensory information and operate and coordinate muscular activity.
* have a reproductive system in which they bear live young and produce milk.
* have an endocrine system and produce and eliminate hormones and other bio-chemical signalling agents
* have a respiratory system where air is inhaled into lungs and oxygen is used to produce energy.
* have an immune system to protect against disease
* Excrete waste as urine and feces.

==History==
The study of integrated human biology started in the 1920s, sparked by Charles Darwin&#x27;s theories which were re-conceptualized by many scientists. Human attributes, such as child growth and genetics, were put into question and thus human biology was created.

==Typical human attributes==
The key aspects of human biology are those ways in which humans are substantially different from other mammals.

Humans have a very large brain in a head that is very large for the size of the animal. This large brain has enabled a range of unique attributes including the development of complex languages and the ability to make and use a complex range of tools.

The upright stance and bipedal locomotion is not unique to humans but humans are the only species to rely almost exclusively on this mode of locomotion. This has resulted in significant changes in the structure of the skeleton including the articulation of the pelvis and the femur and in the articulation of the head.

In comparison with most other mammals, humans are very long lived with an average age at death in the developed world of nearly 80 years old. Humans also have the longest childhood of any mammal with sexual maturity taking 12 to 16 years on average to be completed.

Humans lack fur. Although there is a residual covering of fine hair, which may be more developed in some people, and localised hair covering on the head, axillary and pubic regions, in terms of protection from cold, humans are almost naked. The reason for this development is still much debated.

The human eye can see objects in colour but is not well adapted to low light conditions. The sense of smell and of taste are present but are relatively inferior to a wide range of other mammals. Human hearing is efficient but lacks the acuity of some other mammals. Similarly human sense of touch is well developed especially in the hands where dextrous tasks are performed but the sensitivity is still significantly less than in other animals, particularly those equipped with sensory bristles such as cats.

==Scientific investigation==
Human biology tries to understand and promotes research on humans as living beings as a scientific discipline. It makes use of various scientific methods, such as experiments and observations, to detail the biochemical and biophysical foundations of human life describe and formulate the underlying processes using models. As a basic science, it provides the knowledge base for medicine. A number of sub-disciplines include anatomy, cytology, histology and morphology.

==Medicine==
The capabilities of the human brain and the human dexterity in making and using tools, has enabled humans to understand their own biology through scientific experiment, including dissection, autopsy, prophylactic medicine which has, in turn, enable humans to extend their life-span by understanding and mitigating the effects of diseases.

Understanding human biology has enabled and fostered a wider understanding of mammalian biology and by extension, the biology of all living organisms.

==Nutrition==

Human nutrition is typical of mammalian omnivorous nutrition requiring a balanced input of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. However, the human diet has a few very specific requirements. These include two specific amino acids, alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid without which life is not sustainable in the medium to long term. All other fatty acids can be synthesized from dietary fats. Similarly, human life requires a range of vitamins to be present in food and if these are missing or are supplied at unacceptably low levels, metabolic disorders result which can end in death. The human metabolism is similar to most other mammals except for the need to have an intake of Vitamin C to prevent scurvy and other deficiency diseases. Unusually amongst mammals, a human can synthesize Vitamin D3 using natural UV light from the sun on the skin. This capability may be widespread in the mammalian world but few other mammals share the almost naked skin of humans. The darker the human&#x27;s skin, the less it can manufacture Vitamin D3.

==Other organisms==
Human biology also encompasses all those organisms that live on or in the human body. Such organisms range from parasitic insects such as fleas and ticks, parasitic helminths such as liver flukes through to bacterial and viral pathogens. Many of the organisms associated with human biology are the specialised biome in the large intestine and the biotic flora of the skin and pharyngeal and nasal region. Many of these biotic assemblages help protect humans from harm and assist in digestion, and are now known to have complex effects on mood, and well-being.

==Social behaviour==
Humans in all civilizations are social animals and use their language skills and tool making skills to communicate.

These communication skills enable civilizations to grow and allow for the production of art, literature and music, and for the development of technology. All of these are wholly dependent on the human biological specialisms.

The deployment of these skills has allowed the human race to dominate the terrestrial biome to the detriment of most of the other species.

<text>Trinity is a novel by American author Leon Uris, published in 1976 by Doubleday. It spent 21 weeks atop &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Sellers list in 1976 and 14 weeks in 1977.

The book tells the story of the intertwining lives of the following families: the Larkins and O&#x27;Neills, Catholic hill farmers from the fictional town of Ballyutogue in County Donegal; the Macleods, Protestant shipyard workers from Belfast; and the Hubbles.

The book describes a number of historical events, from the Great Famine of the 1840s to the Easter Rising in 1916.

==Plot==
Conor&#x27;s best friend Seamus O&#x27;Neill begins school in town under a Protestant named Andrew Ingram. Conor, needed at home, helps his father in the fields, until he becomes an apprentice at a blacksmith shop. As the years pass, the boys become friends with Mr. Ingram, who teaches them of the power of books and the history of their Irish forefathers. Seamus goes to college in Belfast, and Conor heads to Derry. In Bogside Conor witnesses the extent of the disaster that has befallen the Irish people. Bogside is in tatters and a state of despair that has stricken its inhabitants since before the Great Famine that had taken place between 1845 and 1852. Held down by the Protestant reign in Derry&#x27;s labor unions, the Catholics are dying slowly without hope.

In Derry, Conor discovers other like-minded Irish tired of the oppression of the Catholics by the Protestants. This small group, with the support of the few Irish politicians, becomes the Republican Brotherhood, the roots of Sinn Féin, and the whisper of freedom throughout Ireland.

<doc id="411957" wikidata="Q3695425" url="?curid=411957" title="Random Fibonacci sequence">
<text>In mathematics, the random Fibonacci sequence is a stochastic analogue of the Fibonacci sequence defined by the recurrence relation formula_1, where the signs + or − are chosen at random with equal probability formula_2, independently for different formula_3. By a theorem of Harry Kesten and Hillel Furstenberg, random recurrent sequences of this kind grow at a certain exponential rate, but it is difficult to compute the rate explicitly. In 1999, Divakar Viswanath showed that the growth rate of the random Fibonacci sequence is equal to 1.1319882487943... , a mathematical constant that was later named Viswanath&#x27;s constant.

==Description==
A random Fibonacci sequence is an integer random sequence given by the numbers formula_4 for natural numbers formula_3, where formula_6 and the subsequent terms are chosen randomly according to the random recurrence relation
formula_7
An instance of the random Fibonacci sequence starts with 1,1 and the value of the each subsequent term is determined by a fair coin toss: given two consecutive elements of the sequence, the next element is either their sum or their difference with probability 1/2, independently of all the choices made previously. If in the random Fibonacci sequence the plus sign is chosen at each step, the corresponding instance is the Fibonacci sequence (&quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;),
formula_8
If the signs alternate in minus-plus-plus-minus-plus-plus-... pattern, the result is the sequence
formula_9

However, such patterns occur with vanishing probability in a random experiment. In a typical run, the terms will not follow a predictable pattern:
formula_10

Similarly to the deterministic case, the random Fibonacci sequence may be profitably described via matrices:
formula_11

where the signs are chosen independently for different &quot;n&quot; with equal probabilities for + or −. Thus
formula_12
where (&quot;M&quot;&quot;k&quot;) is a sequence of independent identically distributed random matrices taking values &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; with probability 1/2:
formula_13

==Growth rate==
Johannes Kepler discovered that as &quot;n&quot; increases, the ratio of the successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence (&quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;) approaches the golden ratio formula_14 which is approximately 1.61803. In 1765, Leonhard Euler published an explicit formula, known today as the Binet formula,
formula_15

It demonstrates that the Fibonacci numbers grow at an exponential rate equal to the golden ratio &quot;φ&quot;.

In 1960, Hillel Furstenberg and Harry Kesten showed that for a general class of random matrix products, the norm grows as &quot;λ&quot;&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of factors. Their results apply to a broad class of random sequence generating processes that includes the random Fibonacci sequence. As a consequence, the &quot;n&quot;th root of |&quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;| converges to a constant value &quot;almost surely&quot;, or with probability one:
formula_16

An explicit expression for this constant was found by Divakar Viswanath in 1999. It uses Furstenberg&#x27;s formula for the Lyapunov exponent of a random matrix product and integration over a certain fractal measure on the Stern–Brocot tree. Moreover, Viswanath computed the numerical value above using floating point arithmetic validated by an analysis of the rounding error.

==Generalization==
Mark Embree and Nick Trefethen showed in 1999 that the sequence
formula_17

decays almost surely if &quot;β&quot; is less than a critical value , known as the Embree–Trefethen constant, and otherwise grows almost surely. They also showed that the asymptotic ratio &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;β&quot;) between consecutive terms converges almost surely for every value of &quot;β&quot;. The graph of &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;β&quot;) appears to have a fractal structure, with a global minimum near approximately equal to .

<doc id="411960" wikidata="Q740900" url="?curid=411960" title="Spermatic cord">
<text>The spermatic cord is the cord-like structure in males formed by the vas deferens (&quot;ductus deferens&quot;) and surrounding tissue that runs from the deep inguinal ring down to each testicle. Its serosal covering, the tunica vaginalis, is an extension of the peritoneum that passes through the transversalis fascia. Each testicle develops in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar region and migrates into the scrotum. During its descent it carries along with it the vas deferens, its vessels, nerves etc. There is one on each side.

==Structure==
The spermatic cord is ensheathed in three layers of tissue:
* &quot;external spermatic fascia&quot;, an extension of the innominate fascia that overlies the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle.
* &quot;cremasteric muscle and fascia&quot;, formed from a continuation of the internal oblique muscle and its fascia.
* &quot;internal spermatic fascia&quot;, continuous with the transversalis fascia.

The normal diameter of the spermatic cord is about 16 mm (range 11 to 22 mm). It is located behind the tunica vaginalis.

===Contents===

==== Blood vessels ====
* Testicular artery
*Artery to the ductus deferens
*Cremasteric artery

==== Nerves ====
* Nerve to cremaster (genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve).
*Testicular nerves (sympathetic nerves). 
The ilioinguinal nerve is not actually located inside the spermatic cord, but runs outside it in the inguinal canal.

==== Other contents ====
* Vas deferens
* Pampiniform plexus
* Lymphatic vessels
The tunica vaginalis is located in front of the spermatic cord, outside it.

==Clinical significance==
The spermatic cord is sensitive to torsion, in which the testicle rotates within its sac and blocks its own blood supply. Testicular torsion may result in irreversible damage to the testicle within hours. A collection of serous fluid in the spermatic cord is named &#x27;funiculocele&#x27;.

The contents of the abdominal cavity may protrude into the inguinal canal, producing an indirect inguinal hernia

Varicose veins of the spermatic cord are referred to as varicocele. Though often asymptomatic, about one in four people with varicocele have negatively affected fertility.

<doc id="411964" wikidata="Q3097841" url="?curid=411964" title="Computer accessibility">
<text>Computer accessibility refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability type or severity of impairment. The term &quot;accessibility&quot; is most often used in reference to specialized hardware or software, or a combination of both, designed to enable the use of a computer by a person with a disability or impairment.

== Accessibility Features ==
Accessibility features are meant to make the use of technology less challenging for those with disabilities. Common accessibility features include text-to-speech, closed-captioning, and keyboard shortcuts. More specific technologies that need additional hardware are referred to as assistive technology.

There are many disabilities or impairments that can be a barrier to effective computer use. Some of these impairments, which can be acquired from disease, trauma, or congenital disorders, include:
*Cognitive impairments (head injury, autism, developmental disabilities) and learning disabilities, (such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, or ADHD).
*Visual impairment, such as low-vision, complete or partial blindness, and color blindness.
*Hearing-related disabilities (deafness), including deafness, being hard of hearing, and hyperacusis.
*Motor or dexterity impairment such as paralysis, cerebral palsy, dyspraxia, carpal tunnel syndrome, and repetitive strain injury.

A topic closely linked to computer accessibility is web accessibility. Similar to computer accessibility, web accessibility is the practice of making the use of the World Wide Web easier to use for individuals with disabilities.
Accessibility is often abbreviated as the numeronym a11y, where the number 11 refers to the number of letters omitted. This parallels the abbreviations of &quot;internationalization&quot; and &quot;localization&quot; as &quot;i18n&quot; and &quot;l10n&quot;, respectively. Moreover, &quot;a11y&quot; is also listed on the USPTO Supplemental Register under Accessibility Now, Inc.

== Special Needs Assessments ==
People wishing to overcome an impairment in order to use a computer comfortably may require a &quot;special needs assessment&quot; by an assistive technology consultant (such as an occupational therapist, a rehabilitation engineering technologist, or an educational technologist) to help them identify and configure appropriate assistive technologies to meet individual needs. Even those who are unable to leave their own home or who live far from assessment providers may be assessed (and assisted) remotely using remote desktop software and a web cam. For example, the assessor logs on to the client&#x27;s computer via a broadband Internet connection, observes the user&#x27;s computer skills, and then remotely makes accessibility adjustments to the client&#x27;s computer where necessary.

== Accessibility options for specific impairments ==

=== Cognitive impairments and illiteracy ===
The biggest challenge in computer accessibility is to make resources accessible to people with cognitive disabilities—particularly those with poor communication and reading skills. For example, people with learning disabilities may rely on proprietary symbols and identify particular products via the product&#x27;s symbols or icons. Unfortunately, copyright laws can limit icon or symbol release to web-based programs and websites by owners who are unwilling to release them to the public.

In these situations, an alternative approach for users who want to access public computer-based terminals in libraries, ATMs, and information kiosks is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal - such as a smart card - that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etc. to their particular needs. 

This concept is encompassed by the CEN standard &quot;Identification card systems – Human-machine interface&quot;. This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by SNAPI and has been successfully incorporated into the Local Authority Smartcards Standards e-Organisation (LASSeO) specifications.

=== Visual impairment ===
Since computer interfaces often require visual input and provide visual feedback, another significant challenge in computer accessibility involves making software usable by people with visual impairments.

For people with mild to medium vision impairment, things like large fonts, high DPI displays, high-contrast themes and icons combined with auditory feedback and screen magnifying software are very useful. In the case of severe vision impairment such as blindness, screen reader software that provides feedback via text to speech or a refreshable braille display is a necessary accommodation for interaction with a computer.

About 8% of men and about 0.4% of women have some form of color-blindness. The main color combinations that might be confused by people with visual deficiency include red/green and blue/yellow. However, in a well-designed user interface, color isn&#x27;t the primary way to distinguish between different pieces of information.

=== Motor and dexterity impairments ===
Some people may not be able to use a conventional input device, such as the mouse or the keyboard. Therefore, it is important for software functions to be accessible using both devices. Ideally, the software will use a generic input API that permits the use even of highly specialized devices unheard of at the time of software&#x27;s initial development. Keyboard shortcuts and mouse gestures are ways to achieve this access, as are more specialized solutions, including on-screen software keyboards and alternate input devices (switches, joysticks and trackballs). Users may enable a bounce key feature, allowing the keyboard to ignore repeated presses of the same key. Speech recognition technology is also a compelling and suitable alternative to conventional keyboard and mouse input as it simply requires a commonly available audio headset.

UI design can also improve accessibility for users with motor impairments. For example, barrier pointing design allows commonly-used functions to require less accuracy to select.

The astrophysicist Stephen Hawking is an example of someone with severe motor and physical limitations who used assistive technology to support activities of daily living. He used a switch, combined with special software, that allowed him to control his wheelchair-mounted computer using his limited and small movement ability. This personalized system allowed him to remain mobile, do research, and produce his written work. Prof. Hawking also used augmentative and alternative communication technology to speak and an environmental control device to access equipment independently.

A small amount of modern research indicates that utilizing a standard computer mouse device improves fine-motor skills.

=== Hearing impairment ===
While sound user interfaces have a secondary role in common desktop computing, these interfaces are usually limited to using sound effects as feedback. Some software producers take into account people who cannot hear due to hearing impairments, silence requirements, or lack of sound-producing software. The system sounds like beeps can be substituted or supplemented with visual notifications and captioned text (akin to closed captioning). Closed captions are a very popular means of relaying information for the Deaf and hearing-impaired communities. Modern computer animation also allows for translation of content into sign language by means of sign language avatars, such as SiMAX.

== Types of software accessibility ==

=== Accessibility application programming interfaces ===
Software APIs (application programming interfaces) exist to allow assistive technology products such as screen readers and screen magnifiers to work with mainstream software. The current or past APIs include:
* Java Accessibility and the Java Access Bridge for Java software (being standardized as ISO/IEC TR 13066-6);
* Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI) on UNIX and Linux (being standardized as ISO/IEC PDTR 13066-4);
* Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) on Microsoft Windows;
* IAccessible2 on Microsoft Windows, a competitor of Microsoft UI Automation also replacing MSAA by Free Standards Group (standardized as ISO/IEC 13066-3:2012);
* Mac OS X Accessibility;
* Microsoft UI Automation on Microsoft Windows, replacing MSAA.

Some of these APIs are being standardized in the ISO/IEC 13066 series of standards.

=== Accessibility features in mainstream software ===
Accessibility software can also make input devices easier to access at the user level. These include:
* Keyboard shortcuts and MouseKeys allow the user to substitute keyboarding for mouse actions. Macro recorders can greatly extend the range and sophistication of keyboard shortcuts.
* Sticky keys allows characters or commands to be typed without having to hold down a modifier key (Shift, Ctrl, or Alt) while pressing a second key. Similarly, ClickLock is a Microsoft Windows feature that remembers a mouse button is down so that items can be highlighted or dragged without holding the mouse button down while scrolling.
* Customization of mouse or mouse alternatives&#x27; responsiveness to movement, double-clicking, and so forth.
* ToggleKeys is a feature of Microsoft Windows 95 onwards. A high sound is heard when the caps lock, scroll lock, or number lock key is switched on. A low sound is heard when any of those keys is switched off.
* Customization of pointer appearance, such as size, color, and shape.
* Predictive text
* Spell checkers and grammar checkers

=== Support for learning disabilities ===
Other approaches may be particularly relevant to users with a learning disability. These include: 
* Cause and effect software
* Switch-accessible software (navigable with a switch)
* Hand–eye coordination skills software
* Diagnostic assessment software
* Mind mapping software
* Study skills software
* Symbol-based software
* Text-to-speech
* Touch typing software

== Open Accessibility Framework ==

The Open Accessibility Framework (OAF) provides an outline of the steps that must be in place in order for any computing platform to be considered accessible. These steps are analogous to those necessary to make a physical or built environment accessible. The OAF divides the required steps into two categories: creation and use.

The &quot;creation&quot; steps describe the precursors and building blocks required for technology developers to create accessible applications and products. They are as follows:
# Define what &quot;accessible&quot; means for the identified use of the platform. It must be clear what is meant by &quot;accessible&quot; as this will differ according to the modality and capabilities of each platform. Accessibility features may include tabbing navigation, theming, and an accessibility API.
# Provide accessible stock user interface elements. Pre-built &quot;stock&quot; user interface elements, used by application developers and authoring tools, must be implemented to make use of the accessibility features of a platform.
# Provide authoring tools that support accessibility. Application developers and content authors should be encouraged to implement tools that will improve the accessibility features of a platform. Using these tools can support accessible stock user interface elements, prompt for information required to properly implement an accessibility API, and identify accessibility evaluation and repair tools.

The &quot;use&quot; steps describe what is necessary for the computing environment in which these accessible applications will run. They are as follows:
# Provide platform supports. Computing platforms must properly implement the accessibility features that are specified in their accessibility definition. For example, the accessibility API definitions must be implemented correctly in the program code.
# Provide accessible application software. Accessible applications must be available for the platform and they must support the accessibility features of the platform. This may be achieved by simply engaging the accessible stock elements and authoring tools that support accessibility.
# Provide assistive technologies. Assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice input, adapted keyboards) must actually be available for the platform so that the users can effectively interface with the technology.

The following examples show that the OAF can be applied to different types of platforms: desktop operating systems, web applications and the mobile platform. A more complete list can be found in the Open Source Accessibility Repository by the Open Accessibility Everywhere Group (OAEG).

# Accessibility APIs include the Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface and UI Automation on the desktop, WAI-ARIA in web applications, and the Blackberry Accessibility API on the Blackberry operating system. 
# Other APIs are keyboard access and theming in widget libraries like Java Swing for desktop applications, the jQuery UI and Fluid Infusion for Web applications, and the Lightweight User Interface Toolkit (LWUIT) for mobile applications.
# Support for accessible development can be effective by using Glade (for the GTK+ toolkit), the DIAS plugin for NetBeans IDE, Xcode IDE for iOS applications. Accessibility inspection tools like Accerciser (for AT-SPI) and support for accessible authoring with the AccessODF plugin for LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice also fit into this step.
# Support for UI Automation on Microsoft Windows, support for ATK and AT-SPI in Linux GNOME, WAI-ARIA support in Firefox, and the MIDP LWUIT mobile runtime (or the MIDP LCDUI mobile runtime) that is available on mobile phones with Java are examples of APIs.
# The DAISY player AMIS on the Microsoft Windows desktop and the AEGIS Contact Manager for phones with Java ME are designed for accessibility.
# The GNOME Shell Magnifier and Orca on the GNOME desktop, GNOME&#x27;s ATK (Accessibility Toolkit), the web-based screen reader WebAnywhere, and the alternative text-entry system Dasher for Linux, iOS and Android are examples of assistive technologies.

The goal of the listed tools is to embed accessibility into various mainstream technologies.

== Positive effects of computer accessibility ==

=== Effects in school ===
Computer accessibility plays a large role in the classroom. Accessible technology can enable personalized learning for all students.

==== Impacts in the classroom ====
When accessible technology allows personalized learning, there are positive impacts on students. Personalized learning switches the focus from what is being taught to what is being learned. This allows the students to need to become an integral part of the learning process. Accessibility in the classroom allows millions of students of all backgrounds to have equal educational opportunities and keep up with their non-disabled peers.

When PCs are personalized for students in the classroom, students are more comfortable in the classroom, special needs students are better assisted and teachers can save time and effort.

While PCs can provide a large amount of support in the classroom, iPads and apps can play a large role as well. Apps are constantly being developed to aid teachers, parents, and children. Educators have noted that the ease and portability of tablets make them a preferred choice that offers usage in a variety of environments. The advantages include interactivity, Internet access and text messaging. Educators have noticed improvements in motor skills, reading skills, and interaction with others in students.

==== Impacts outside the classroom ====
Parents and teachers can notice the long-term effects that accessibility has on students with disabilities. This can include enhanced social skills, better relationships with family and friends, increased understanding of the world around them, and an exhibition of self-reliance and confidence. Changes can be seen in not only children but adults as well. Social media can help parents to learn, share knowledge, and receive moral support.

=== Effects in the workplace ===
Computer accessibility plays a large role in the workplace. In the past few years, adults have had their disabilities accommodated by the ability to work from home and by the availability of reliable software. This allows workers to work in a comfortable area while still being able to support themselves. This is allowing thousands of people with disabilities to create and earn jobs for themselves. The inexpensiveness and reliability of computers has facilitated the process.

== Standards and regulations regarding computer accessibility ==

=== Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ===
Section 508 requires US Federal agencies make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to all disabled employees and members of the public. The US Access Board develops and maintains the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) accessibility standards. The Access Board issued a final rule that went into effect on January 18, 2018, updating accessibility requirements under Section 508. This final rule requires that all electronic content generated by US Federal agencies must conform to Level A and Level AA success criteria in WCAG 2.0, with four exceptions for non-Web documents: 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks, 2.4.5 Multiple Ways, 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation, and 3.2.4 Consistent Identification.

=== International Standards ===

; ISO 9241-171:2008

ISO 9241-171:2008 is a standard that provides ergonomics guidance and specifications for the design of accessible software for public use.

Compiled from independent standards experts, this document is the most comprehensive and technical standard for designing accessible features for software, covering all disabilities and all aspects of software. It provides examples of two priority levels (&#x27;Required&#x27; and &#x27;Recommended&#x27;) and offers a handy checklist designed to help with recording software testing results.

Because of its complexity and technical nature, and with upwards of 150 individual statements, ISO 9241-172 is difficult to interpret and apply. Luckily, not every statement is relevant to every situation, so it may be advisable to identify a subset of statements that are tailored to the particular software environment, making the use of this document much more achievable.

<text>The rock cod (Lotella rhacina) is a temperate fish found off the coasts of southeastern Australia, Tasmania, the Great Australian Bight and northwards up the southwestern Australia coasts. They are also found around the coasts of New Zealand and California. They belong to the family Moridae and are not related to the true cods (genus &quot;Gadus&quot;). They are also known as beardie in Australia.

Rock cod are yellow-grey to red-brown with white fin margins. They have chin barbels. They may grow up to 50 cm in length. They are found in caves in bays and coastal reefs. They are frequently found inshore and inhabit shallow waters in the continental shelf with typical depth of 10 to 90 m.

Many other fish species are sometimes called &#x27;rock cod&#x27;, but most are unrelated to the cod family, and are better known as groupers.

<text>The penile artery (also known as the common penile artery) is the artery that serves blood to the penis.

It is a terminal branch of the internal pudendal artery, along with the scrotal artery.

It subdivides into three arteries, the bulbourethral artery, the dorsal artery of the penis and the cavernosal artery.

The penile artery is susceptible to trauma. Impact to the groin causing damage to the artery may cause erectile dysfunction in young men. In select patients surgery may correct erectile dysfunction.

<doc id="411983" wikidata="Q7589470" url="?curid=411983" title="St. Lawrence, Toronto">
<text>St. Lawrence is a neighbourhood located in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The area, a former industrial area, is bounded by Yonge, Front, and Parliament Streets, and the Canadian National railway embankment. The Esplanade off Yonge St., lined with restaurants, cafés and hotels runs through the middle of the area. In previous times, the area was sometimes referred to as &#x27;St. Lawrence Ward&#x27; or more often today as &#x27;St. Lawrence Market&#x27;, synonymous with the large retail vendor market which is the neighbourhood&#x27;s focal point. The area is the site of a large city-sponsored housing project of the 1970s, which revitalized an old brownfields area. The boundaries of the St Lawrence Neighbourhood Association and the St Lawrence Market BIA are somewhat larger than those noted above. Both groups have boundaries that extend from Yonge to Parliament Streets and Queen Street East to the rail corridor.

==History==
The town of York was founded in 1793, on a site of ten blocks north of Front Street between George and Berkeley streets, in present day Old Town, Toronto. Much of the area of today&#x27;s St. Lawrence neighbourhood was then located in Toronto Harbour, the shoreline being just south of Front Street. The area was infilled to provide more land for port and industrial uses adjacent. St. Lawrence was the first industrial area of York.

The first parliament buildings in Upper Canada in 1793 were constructed on the southwest corner of Parliament and Front Street. The buildings have long since gone from the site, but a discovery was made in 2000 when a quick dig of the property revealed the old parliament building footings, in addition to some pottery from that time. The City of Toronto and the Government of Ontario now own most of the property. There is a marker for the First Parliament Buildings at Parliament Square Park, West of Parliament Street, East of Berkeley, and South of Front. The marker is actually south of the original site. The Ontario Heritage Trust set up the Parliament Interpretive Centre at Front and Berkeley to provide historical information about this parliament that was destroyed by American troops during the War of 1812. The Centre was open from 2012 to 2015, in remembrance of the 200th anniversary of the war.

A Saturday farmers&#x27; market began operation at Front and Jarvis in 1803. The current South Market building, south of Front, is open Tuesday through Saturday, selling foods and other goods. The North Market building hosted a farmers&#x27; market on Saturdays and a flea market on Sundays until its demolition in 2016, at which time they both moved to a temporary building south of The Esplanade. A new, larger North Market Building is being built on the original site, with planned completion in 2021.

In 1834, Toronto&#x27;s first city hall was built on the southwest corner of King St. East &amp; Jarvis St. at the old &#x27;Market&#x27; building from 1834 (the year of Toronto&#x27;s incorporation from the former town of York) to 1844. This building was damaged during the great fire of 1849 and replaced with the grandiose St. Lawrence Hall and a market building (today&#x27;s North Market).

A larger city hall, also housing a police station and jail cells, opened in 1845 with a long facade running along the south side of Front Street. City Hall was moved out of the area in 1899 to what is now Old City Hall before moving once again to its current location. The 1845 city hall was integrated into the St. Lawrence Market South building in 1899. In 1972, the remains of the city hall were converted into the &quot;Market Gallery&quot;. The old council chamber is all that remains of the original city hall and is located on the gallery&#x27;s second floor.

By 1840, the waterfront was completely taken over by government and merchant wharves. The Esplanade, a -wide road, was proposed, just south of Front Street, with new water lots made from cribbing and filling of the shore to the south. The waterfront was extended to a survey line from the point of the Gooderham windmill west to a point due east of the old Fort Rouillé. Ostensibly for carriages and carts, the roadway eventually became primarily the route for rail lines in the central core. In exchange for of the Esplanade, the railways underwrote the infilling of the harbour. The Esplanade and infill project was completed by 1865.

Commercial activity along Toronto&#x27;s bustling harbour provided employment and was the primary place of entry to the quickly growing, burgeoning city. The convergence of the railway lines and the wharves must have worked because in 1873 historian Henry Scadding so eloquently wrote in his book Old Toronto of The Esplanade &quot;...It has done for Toronto what the Thames Embankment has done for London...&quot;

In the 1920s, the railway lines were relocated to a new, raised viaduct to the south of the Esplanade. This left the current section between Yonge and Berkeley Street.

By the 1960s, the industrial uses of the area had declined, leaving numerous empty sites and decrepit buildings. In the 1970s it was decided by Toronto Mayor David Crombie to turn the area into a new residential neighbourhood, but one that would not make the same mistakes of the &quot;urban renewal&quot; housing projects of earlier decades. The neighbourhood was to be integrated into the city with no clear boundaries. It would contain a mix of commercial and residential as with both subsidized and market-oriented housing, mostly rowhouse or low-rise apartments.

The neighbourhood was planned by Alan Littlewood and Frank Lewinberg, with the influence of American-Canadian urban planner Jane Jacobs playing a crucial role. Design guidelines prepared by Eberhard Zeidler were deemed too modern by planners and politicians and were not implemented, replaced instead by the urban design work of George Baird. Many of the developments were not completed until well into the 1990s. Since that time, the St. Lawrence neighbourhood has been critically acclaimed as a major success in urban planning. In many ways, it has become the model for the design and planning of new urban communities across North America.

==Character==

Some of the most interesting architecture in the city can be found in St. Lawrence, one notable landmark is the Flatiron building, known for its distinct narrow, wedge shape where Wellington St. merges with Front. Built in 1892, it was the first of this type of building constructed in North America. If viewed from the east, the wedge can be seen in the foreground with the financial skyscrapers and the CN tower rising in the background.

While many of the old industrial buildings along Front Street east of Jarvis have been demolished since the 1950s, several old industrial buildings remain, including old meat-packing plants from the 1800s. Several have been converted into lofts or commercial space.

Front Street is lined on both sides with restaurants. At the intersection of Front and Yonge are two performing arts houses, the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts, Toronto&#x27;s &quot;centennial&quot; project and Meridian Hall.

<doc id="411984" wikidata="Q1147068" url="?curid=411984" title="First of October Anti-Fascist Resistance Groups">
<text>The First of October Anti-Fascist Resistance Groups () was a Spanish clandestine Marxist–Leninist group aiming for the formation of a Spanish Republican state.

The group was anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, and strongly opposed Spain&#x27;s membership in NATO.

GRAPO&#x27;s last attack was in 2006. After having been fairly active in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a dwindling number of its militants along with police actions allowed Spanish officials to claim a number of times to have disbanded the GRAPO after the remaining militants were captured. According to the Spanish police, GRAPO was disbanded after six of its militants were arrested in June 2007 but formally, the group has not announced its dissolution.

GRAPO is included in the European Union&#x27;s list of terrorist organisations.

==History==

GRAPO has its origins in the Organisation of Marxist–Leninists of Spain (OMLE), which dissolved itself in its first congress in 1975. At the beginning of 1976, two months after General Francisco Franco&#x27;s death, during the Spanish transition to democracy from dictatorship, the Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted) (PCE-r) began a struggle against the political reforms. The PCE(r) restructured itself into different commissions; one of these was a &quot;front against fascism&quot;, founded by Juan Carlos Delgado de Codex, which became the GRAPO.

This newly born movement was named after the killing of four Spanish policemen on 1 October 1975, the first violent action of the PCE(r). The &quot;Antifascist Resistance Groups October First&quot; (GRAPO) took this date as a starting point as a terrorist organization. Only five months later, after five workers were killed by the Spanish police during demonstrations in Vitoria-Gasteiz, the PCE(r) told its sympathizers to take up arms and create the nucleus of a future Spanish &quot;Red Army&quot; which would be directed by a central command. A number of explosive devices were detonated in different locations in Spain on 18 July 1976, and GRAPO claimed responsibility for the coordinated explosions in the press, becoming well-known overnight.

After the high-profile kidnapping of wealthy politician Antonio María de Oriol y Urquijo in 1976 and General Villaescusa in 1977 as well as the killing of more Spanish policemen, GRAPO became established as an urban guerrilla group, in a similar manner as Revolutionary Antifascist Patriotic Front (FRAP) had been in Francoist Spain.

GRAPO increased its activity from 1979 onwards, including the bombing of a café in Madrid on 26 May 1979, which killed nine people. However, the group&#x27;s level of support waned during the 1980s. The transitional democratic regime was not destabilized as the group had promised.
In 1984, the Spanish authorities issued an anti-terrorist law inspired by the Italian model which facilitated police operations against GRAPO, and many arrests followed. GRAPO reacted by simplifying its structure while &quot;waiting for better times&quot;. It continued its clandestine activities at a lower level by means of mobile militants, which easily formed and easily split up, becoming difficult to detect.

Police work caused serious blows to GRAPO&#x27;s structure. Currently the group is inactive yet not formally self-dissolved.

== Summary of GRAPO&#x27;s activity ==
Since its inception in 1975 until its last-known activity in 2006, it killed 84 people, including police, military personnel, judges, and civilians via bombings and shootings. A number of its militants were killed during bank robberies committed to raise funds for the organization. The group has also committed a number of kidnappings, initially for political reasons and later on for ransom. Its last attack was in 2006, when GRAPO shot dead Ana Isabel Herrero, the owner of a temporary work agency in Zaragoza.

In 2000, GRAPO&#x27;s leader Manuel Pérez &#x27;Arenas&#x27; was sentenced in a French court for criminal conspiracy with terrorist intent. Spain issued a request for his immediate extradition. To date GRAPO has not named a successor.

==Notable members==
Spanish Paralympian Sebastián Rodríguez was a member of GRAPO .

==Supporters==
In October 2011, Spanish hip hop artist Pablo Hasel was arrested for condoning terrorism after he saluted one of GRAPO&#x27;s imprisoned members in a music video. He was soon released from jail, but the charges were not dropped. Ten years later on 16 February 2021, Hasel was arrested and imprisoned again on similar charges by the social democrat PSOE-UP government, leading to anti-fascist groups staging mass demonstrations across the country demanding the release of Hasel and other jailed PCE(r) and GRAPO members.

In February 2014, a Twitter user was convicted of glorifying terrorism for tweets praising GRAPO.

<doc id="411986" wikidata="Q256664" url="?curid=411986" title="Doctors' plot">
<text>The &quot;doctors&#x27; plot&quot; () was a Soviet state-sponsored antisemitic campaign based on a conspiracy theory that alleged a cabal of prominent medical specialists, predominantly of Jewish ethnicity, intended to murder leading government and communist party officials. It was also known as the case of saboteur doctors or killer doctors. In 1951–1953, a group of mostly Jewish doctors from Moscow were accused of a conspiracy to assassinate Soviet leaders. This was later accompanied by publications of antisemitic character in the media which talked about the threats of Zionism and condemned people with Jewish surnames. Following this, many doctors, both Jews and non-Jews, were dismissed from their jobs, arrested, and tortured to produce admissions. A few weeks after Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, the new Soviet leadership said there was a lack of evidence regarding the doctors&#x27; plot and the case was dropped. Soon after, the case was declared to have been a fabrication.

==Beginnings==
A number of theories attempt to explain the origins of the doctors&#x27; plot case. Historians typically relate it to the earlier case of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s destruction of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee and the campaign against the so-called Jewish rootless cosmopolitans in the second half of the 1940s, as well as to the power struggle within the Soviet leadership during that time. The campaign against the doctors was presumably set in motion by Stalin as a pretext to launch a massive purge of the Communist Party, and, according to Edvard Radzinsky, even to consolidate the country for a future World War III.

In 1948, an allegation was made by a Soviet veteran medical worker, Lydia Timashuk, who stated that &quot;intentional distortions in medical conclusions [were] made by major medical experts who served as consultants in the hospital&quot;. Timashuk &quot;exposed their criminal designs&quot; and as such the security bodies of the Soviet Union were made aware of the existence of the alleged conspiracy against Stalin. Stalin had strong doubts about Timashuk&#x27;s allegations. Stalin&#x27;s daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva, stated that her father was &quot;very saddened by the turn of events&quot; and that the housekeeper heard him saying that he did not believe the doctors were &quot;dishonest&quot; and that the only evidence against them were the reports of Timashuk.

In 1951, Ministry for State Security (MGB) investigator Mikhail Ryumin reported to his superior, Viktor Abakumov, Minister of the MGB, that Professor Yakov Etinger, who was arrested as a &quot;bourgeois nationalist&quot; with connections to the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, had committed malpractice in treating Andrei Zhdanov (died 1948) and Alexander Shcherbakov (died 1945), allegedly with the intention of killing them. However, Abakumov refused to believe the story. Etinger died in prison (2 March 1951) due to interrogations and harsh conditions. Ryumin was then dismissed from his position in the MGB for misappropriating money and was held responsible for the death of Etinger. With the assistance of Georgy Malenkov, Ryumin wrote a letter to Stalin, accusing Abakumov of killing Etinger in order to hide a conspiracy to kill off the Soviet leadership. On 4 July 1951, the Politburo set up a commission (headed by Malenkov and including Lavrentiy Beria) to investigate the issue. Based on the commission&#x27;s report, the Politburo soon passed a resolution on the &quot;bad situation in the MGB&quot; and Abakumov was fired.

Beria and Malenkov both tried to use the situation to expand their power through gaining control of the MGB.

==Arrests==

Abakumov was arrested and tortured soon after being dismissed as head of the MGB. He was charged with being a sympathizer and protector of the criminal Jewish underground. This arrest was followed by the arrests of many agents who worked for him in the central apparatus of the MGB, including most Jews.

The killer doctors case was revived in 1952 when the letter from cardiologist was dug up from the archives. In 1948, Timashuk wrote a letter to the head of Stalin&#x27;s security, General Nikolai Vlasik, explaining that Zhdanov suffered a heart attack, but the Kremlin doctors who treated him missed it and prescribed the wrong treatment for him. Zhdanov soon died and the doctors covered up their mistake. The letter, however, was originally ignored. In 1953, Timashuk was awarded the Order of Lenin (later revoked) &quot;for the assistance in unmasking killer doctors&quot;, and for a long time Timashuk had an unjust stigma of the instigator of this persecution of doctors after Khrushchev in his &quot;Secret Speech&quot; mentioned her in this respect.

The Kremlin doctors involved in the cover up were to be arrested, but they were all Russian. To portray the conspiracy as Zionist, Ryumin and Semyon Ignatyev, who had succeeded Abakumov as head of the MGB, had the Jewish doctors Etinger supposedly specified also added to the arrest list; many of them, like Miron Vovsi, had been consulted by the Kremlin&#x27;s medical department. The arrests started in September 1952. Vlasik was fired as head of Stalin&#x27;s security and eventually also arrested for ignoring the Timashuk letter.

Initially, 37 were arrested. Under torture, prisoners seized in the investigation of the alleged plot were compelled to produce evidence against themselves and their associates.

Stalin harangued Ignatyev and accused the MGB of incompetence. He demanded that the interrogations of doctors already under arrest be accelerated. Stalin complained that there was no clear picture of the Zionist conspiracy and no solid evidence that specifically the Jewish doctors were guilty.

Newly opened KGB archives provide evidence that Stalin forwarded the collected interrogation materials to Malenkov, Khrushchev and other &quot;potential victims of the doctors&#x27; plot&quot;.

==Media campaign==
Stalin ordered the news agency TASS and &quot;Pravda&quot;, the official newspaper of the CPSU, to issue reports about the uncovering of a doctors&#x27; plot to assassinate top Soviet leaders, including Stalin himself. The possible goal of the campaign was to set the stage for show trials. Other sources say that the initiative came from Beria and Malenkov, who continued to use the plot for their own interests. Beria pushed the Politburo to decide to publicize the plot on 9 January 1953. For him, it was especially important that the doctors&#x27; plot got more attention than the Mingrelian Affair, which personally affected him.

On 13 January 1953, nine eminent doctors in Moscow were accused of taking part in a vast plot to poison members of the top Soviet political and military leadership. &quot;Pravda&quot; reported the accusations under the headline &quot;Vicious Spies and Killers under the Mask of Academic Physicians&quot;:

Today the TASS news agency reported the arrest of a group of saboteur-doctors. This terrorist group, uncovered some time ago by organs of state security, had as their goal shortening the lives of leaders of the Soviet Union by means of medical sabotage.

Investigation established that participants in the terrorist group, exploiting their position as doctors and abusing the trust of their patients, deliberately and viciously undermined their patients&#x27; health by making incorrect diagnoses, and then killed them with bad and incorrect treatments. Covering themselves with the noble and merciful calling of physicians, men of science, these fiends and killers dishonored the holy banner of science. Having taken the path of monstrous crimes, they defiled the honor of scientists.

Among the victims of this band of inhuman beasts were Comrades A. A. Zhdanov and A. S. Shcherbakov. The criminals confessed that, taking advantage of the illness of Comrade Zhdanov, they intentionally concealed a myocardial infarction, prescribed inadvisable treatments for this serious illness and thus killed Comrade Zhdanov. Killer doctors, by incorrect use of very powerful medicines and prescription of harmful regimens, shortened the life of Comrade Shcherbakov, leading to his death.

The majority of the participants of the terrorist group… were bought by American intelligence. They were recruited by a branch-office of American intelligence – the international Jewish bourgeois-nationalist organization called &quot;Joint.&quot; The filthy face of this Zionist spy organization, covering up their vicious actions under the mask of charity, is now completely revealed…

Unmasking the gang of poisoner-doctors struck a blow against the international Jewish Zionist organization... Now all can see what sort of philanthropists and &quot;friends of peace&quot; hid beneath the sign-board of &quot;Joint.&quot;

Other participants in the terrorist group (Vinogradov, M. Kogan, Egorov) were discovered, as has been presently determined, to have been long-time agents of English intelligence, serving it for many years, carrying out its most criminal and sordid tasks. The bigwigs of the USA and their English junior partners know that to achieve domination over other nations by peaceful means is impossible. Feverishly preparing for a new world war, they energetically send spies inside the USSR and the people&#x27;s democratic countries: they attempt to accomplish what the Hitlerites could not do — to create in the USSR their own subversive &quot;fifth column.&quot;...

The Soviet people should not for a minute forget about the need to heighten their vigilance in all ways possible, to be alert for all schemes of war-mongers and their agents, to constantly strengthen the Armed Forces and the intelligence organs of our government.

Other individuals mentioned included:

* Solomon Mikhoels (actor-director of the Moscow State Jewish Theater and the head of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, assassinated in January 1948), who was called a &quot;well-known Jewish bourgeois nationalist&quot;
* Miron Vovsi (therapist, Stalin&#x27;s personal physician and a cousin of Mikhoels)
* (therapist), also a personal doctor to Stalin
* Mikhail Kogan (therapist)
* Boris Kogan (therapist)
* P. Yegorov (therapist)
* A. Feldman (otolaryngologist)
* Yakov Etinger (therapist)
* (neuropathologist)
* G. Mayorov (therapist)

Six of the nine mentioned doctors were Jewish.

The list of alleged victims included high-ranked officials Andrei Zhdanov, Aleksandr Shcherbakov, Army Marshals Aleksandr Vasilevsky, Leonid Govorov and Ivan Konev, General Sergei Shtemenko, Admiral Gordey Levchenko and others.

Stalin intended to publish in &quot;Pravda&quot; a letter signed by many prominent Soviet Jews in which the Jews involved in the plot would be denounced, and differences between them and other Soviet Jews (those loyal to the USSR and to socialism) would be made clear. Two versions of the letter were created, but it was never published. Either Stalin eventually decided not to publish it or it was still being worked on at the time of his death.

==Stalin&#x27;s death and the consequences==
After Stalin&#x27;s death on 5 March 1953, the new leadership quickly dismissed all charges related to the plot; the doctors were exonerated in a 31 March decree by the newly appointed Minister of Internal Affairs, Lavrentiy Beria, and on 6 April, this was communicated to the public in &quot;Pravda&quot;. Chief MGB investigator and Deputy Minister of State Security Mikhail Ryumin was accused of fabricating the plot, arrested and later executed. A Komsomol official, Nikolai Mesyatsev, was assigned by Malenkov to review the doctors&#x27; plot case and quickly found that it was fabricated.

There is a tale in the Hasidic Chabad movement that Stalin became sick as a consequence of some metaphysical intervention of the seventh Chabad leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, during the recitation of a public discourse at a Purim gathering in 1953, which supposedly caused Stalin&#x27;s death and averted massive deportations of Soviet Jews to Siberia that were to take place as a result of the antisemitic campaign surrounding the doctor&#x27;s plot affair.

==Khrushchev&#x27;s statements==
In his 1956 &quot;Secret Speech&quot;, First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev stated that the doctors&#x27; plot was &quot;fabricated... set up by Stalin,&quot; but that Stalin did not &quot;have the time in which to bring it to an end,&quot; which saved the doctors&#x27; lives. Khrushchev also told the session that Stalin called the judge in the case and, regarding the methods to be used, stated &quot;beat, beat, and beat again.&quot; Stalin supposedly told his Minister of State Security, &quot;If you do not obtain confessions from the doctors we will shorten you by a head.&quot;

Khrushchev also claimed that Stalin hinted to him to incite antisemitism in Ukraine, saying, &quot;The good workers at the factory should be given clubs so they can beat the hell out of those Jews.&quot; 

According to Khrushchev, Stalin told Politburo members, &quot;You are blind like young kittens. What will happen without me? The country will perish because you do not know how to recognize enemies.&quot;

Khrushchev asserted that Stalin intended to use the doctors&#x27; trial to launch a massive purge of the Communist Party.

==Alleged planned deportation of Jews==
Soviet historian has advanced a view, based on various memoirs and secondary evidence, that the doctors&#x27; plot case was intended to trigger the mass repression and deportation of the Jews to the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, similar to the deportations of many other ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union, but the plan was not accomplished because of the sudden death of Stalin.

According to Louis Rapoport, the alleged deportation was planned to start with the public execution of the imprisoned doctors, and then the &quot;following incidents would follow&quot;: &quot;attacks on Jews orchestrated by the secret police, the publication of the statement by the prominent Jews, and a flood of other letters demanding that action be taken. A three-stage program of genocide would be followed. First, almost all Soviet Jews ... would be shipped to camps east of the Urals ... Second, the authorities would set Jewish leaders at all levels against one another ... Also the MGB [Secret Police] would start killing the elites in the camps, just as they had killed the Yiddish writers ... the previous year. The ... final stage would be to &#x27;get rid of the rest.&#x27;&quot;

Four large camps were built in southern and western Siberia shortly before Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, and there were rumors that they were for Jews. A special &quot;Deportation Commission&quot; to plan the deportation of Jews to these camps was allegedly created. Nikolay Poliakov, the presumed secretary of the &quot;Commission&quot;, stated years later that, according to Stalin&#x27;s initial plan, the deportation was to begin in the middle of February 1953, but the monumental tasks of compiling lists of Jews had not yet been completed. &quot;Pure blooded&quot; Jews were to be deported first, followed by &quot;half-breeds&quot; (&quot;polukrovki&quot;). Before his death in March 1953, Stalin allegedly had planned the execution of doctors&#x27; plot defendants already on trial in Red Square in March 1953, and then he would cast himself as the savior of Soviet Jews by sending them to camps away from the purportedly enraged Russian populace. There are further statements that describe some aspects of such a planned deportation.

Historian Yakov Etinger described how former CPSU Politburo member Nikolai Bulganin said that Stalin asked him in the end of February 1953 to prepare railroad cars for the mass deportation of Jews to the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. According to a book by another Soviet Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev, Stalin started preparations for the deportation of Jews in February 1953 and ordered preparation of a letter from a group of notable Soviet Jews with a request to the Soviet government to carry out the mass deportation of Jews in order to save them from &quot;the just wrath of Soviet people.&quot; The letter had to be published in the newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; and was found later. According to historian Samson Madiyevsky, the deportation was definitely considered, and the only thing in question is the time-frame.

However, Russian historian Zhores Medvedev argued against these allegations, saying that no documents were found in support of the deportation plan. In addition, while historian Joshua Rubenstein argues it would not have been so unusual for an idea like this to not show up in documentation, he argues that the evidence is still weak and many of it has better, more plausible explanations. For example, he argues that many Russian leaders at the time may have propped up stories like this to increase their reputations by claiming they convinced Stalin to relent.

<doc id="411990" wikidata="Q2376918" url="?curid=411990" title="Abelian and Tauberian theorems">
<text>In mathematics, Abelian and Tauberian theorems are theorems giving conditions for two methods of summing divergent series to give the same result, named after Niels Henrik Abel and Alfred Tauber. The original examples are Abel&#x27;s theorem showing that if a series converges to some limit then its Abel sum is the same limit, and Tauber&#x27;s theorem showing that if the Abel sum of a series exists and the coefficients are sufficiently small (o(1/&quot;n&quot;)) then the series converges to the Abel sum. More general Abelian and Tauberian theorems give similar results for more general summation methods.

There is not yet a clear distinction between Abelian and Tauberian theorems, and no generally accepted definition of what these terms mean. Often, a theorem is called &quot;Abelian&quot; if it shows that some summation method gives the usual sum for convergent series, and is called &quot;Tauberian&quot; if it gives conditions for a series summable by some method that allows it to be summable in the usual sense.

In the theory of integral transforms, Abelian theorems give the asymptotic behaviour of the transform based on properties of the original function. Conversely, Tauberian theorems give the asymptotic behaviour of the original function based on properties of the transform but usually require some restrictions on the original function.

==Abelian theorems==

For any summation method &quot;L&quot;, its Abelian theorem is the result that if &quot;c&quot; = (&quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is a convergent sequence, with limit &quot;C&quot;, then &quot;L&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) = &quot;C&quot;. 

An example is given by the Cesàro method, in which &quot;L&quot; is defined as the limit of the arithmetic means of the first &quot;N&quot; terms of &quot;c&quot;, as &quot;N&quot; tends to infinity. One can prove that if &quot;c&quot; does converge to &quot;C&quot;, then so does the sequence (&quot;d&quot;&quot;N&quot;) where

: formula_1

To see that, subtract &quot;C&quot; everywhere to reduce to the case &quot;C&quot; = 0. Then divide the sequence into an initial segment, and a tail of small terms: given any ε &gt; 0 we can take &quot;N&quot; large enough to make the initial segment of terms up to &quot;c&quot;&quot;N&quot; average to at most &quot;ε&quot;/2, while each term in the tail is bounded by ε/2 so that the average is also necessarily bounded.

The name derives from Abel&#x27;s theorem on power series. In that case &quot;L&quot; is the &quot;radial limit&quot; (thought of within the complex unit disk), where we let &quot;r&quot; tend to the limit 1 from below along the real axis in the power series with term

: &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;z&quot;&quot;n&quot;

and set &quot;z&quot; = &quot;r&quot; ·&quot;e&quot;&quot;iθ&quot;. That theorem has its main interest in the case that the power series has radius of convergence exactly 1: if the radius of convergence is greater than one, the convergence of the power series is uniform for &quot;r&quot; in [0,1] so that the sum is automatically continuous and it follows directly that the limit as &quot;r&quot; tends up to 1 is simply the sum of the &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;. When the radius is 1 the power series will have some singularity on |&quot;z&quot;| = 1; the assertion is that, nonetheless, if the sum of the &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; exists, it is equal to the limit over &quot;r&quot;. This therefore fits exactly into the abstract picture.

==Tauberian theorems==

Partial converses to Abelian theorems are called Tauberian theorems. The original result of stated that if we assume also

:&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; = o(1/&quot;n&quot;)

(see Little o notation) and the radial limit exists, then the series obtained by setting &quot;z&quot; = 1 is actually convergent. This was strengthened by John Edensor Littlewood: we need only assume O(1/&quot;n&quot;). A sweeping generalization is the Hardy–Littlewood Tauberian theorem.

In the abstract setting, therefore, an &quot;Abelian&quot; theorem states that the domain of &quot;L&quot; contains the convergent sequences, and its values there are equal to those of the &quot;Lim&quot; functional. A &quot;Tauberian&quot; theorem states, under some growth condition, that the domain of &quot;L&quot; is exactly the convergent sequences and no more.

If one thinks of &quot;L&quot; as some generalised type of &quot;weighted average&quot;, taken to the limit, a Tauberian theorem allows one to discard the weighting, under the correct hypotheses. There are many applications of this kind of result in number theory, in particular in handling Dirichlet series.

The development of the field of Tauberian theorems received a fresh turn with Norbert Wiener&#x27;s very general results, namely Wiener&#x27;s Tauberian theorem and its large collection of corollaries. The central theorem can now be proved by Banach algebra methods, and contains much, though not all, of the previous theory.

<text>Giardiasis is a parasitic disease caused by &quot;Giardia duodenalis&quot; (also known as &quot;G. lamblia&quot; and &quot;G. intestinalis&quot;). Infected individuals who experience symptoms (about 10% have no symptoms) may have diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Less common symptoms include vomiting and blood in the stool. Symptoms usually begin one to three weeks after exposure and, without treatment, may last two to six weeks or longer.

Giardiasis usually spreads when &quot;Giardia duodenalis&quot; cysts within faeces contaminate food or water that is later consumed orally. The disease can also spread between people and through other animals. Cysts may survive for nearly three months in cold water. Giardiasis is diagnosed via stool tests.

Prevention may be improved through proper hygiene practices. Asymptomatic cases often do not need treatment. When symptoms are present, treatment is typically provided with either tinidazole or metronidazole. Infection may cause a person to become lactose intolerant, so it is recommended to temporarily avoid lactose following an infection. Resistance to treatment may occur in some patients.

Giardiasis occurs worldwide. It is one of the most common parasitic human diseases. Infection rates are as high as 7% in the developed world and 30% in the developing world. In 2013, there were approximately 280 million people worldwide with symptomatic cases of giardiasis. The World Health Organization classifies giardiasis as a neglected disease. It is popularly known as beaver fever in North America.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms vary from none to severe diarrhoea with poor absorption of nutrients. The cause of this wide range in severity of symptoms is not fully known but the intestinal flora of the infected host may play a role. Diarrhoea is less likely to occur in people from developing countries.

Symptoms typically develop 9–15 days after exposure, but may occur as early as one day. The most common and prominent symptom is chronic diarrhoea, which can occur for weeks or months if untreated. Diarrhoea is often greasy and foul-smelling, with a tendency to float. This characteristic diarrhoea is often accompanied by several other symptoms, including gas, abdominal cramps, and nausea or vomiting. Some people also experience symptoms outside of the gastrointestinal tract, such as itchy skin, hives, and swelling of the eyes and joints, although these are less common. Fever occurs in only about 15% of infected people, despite the nickname &quot;beaver fever&quot;.

Prolonged disease is often characterised by diarrhoea and malabsorption of nutrients in the intestine. This malabsorption causes fatty stools, substantial weight loss, and fatigue. Additionally, those with giardiasis often have difficulty absorbing lactose, vitamin A, folate, and vitamin B12. In children, prolonged giardiasis can cause failure to thrive and may impair mental development. Symptomatic infections are well recognised as causing lactose intolerance, which, though usually temporary, may become permanent.

==Cause==

Giardiasis is caused by the protozoan &quot;Giardia duodenalis&quot;. The infection occurs in many animals, including beavers, other rodents, cows, and sheep. Animals are believed to play a role in keeping infections present in an environment.

&quot;G. duodenalis&quot; has been sub-classified into eight genetic assemblages (designated A–H). Genotyping of &quot;G. duodenalis&quot; isolated from various hosts has shown that assemblages A and B infect the largest range of host species, and appear to be the main and possibly only &quot;G. duodenalis&quot; assemblages that infect humans.

===Risk factors===
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people at greatest risk of infection are:
* People in childcare settings
* People who are in close contact with someone who has the disease
* Travellers within areas that have poor sanitation
* People who have contact with faeces, such as during sexual activity
* Backpackers or campers who drink untreated water from springs, lakes, or rivers
* Swimmers who swallow water from swimming pools, hot tubs, interactive fountains, or untreated recreational water from springs, lakes, or rivers
* People who get their household water from a shallow well
* People with weakened immune systems
* People who have contact with infected animals or animal environments contaminated with faeces

Factors that increase infection risk for people from developed countries include changing nappies/diapers, consuming raw food, owning a dog, and travelling in the developing world. However, 75% of infections in the United Kingdom are acquired in the UK, not through travel elsewhere. In the United States, giardiasis occurs more often in summer, which is believed to be due to a greater amount of time spent on outdoor activities and travelling in the wilderness.

===Transmission===
Giardiasis is transmitted via the faecal-oral route with the ingestion of cysts. Primary routes are personal contact and contaminated water and food. The cysts can stay infectious for up to three months in cold water.

Many people with &quot;Giardia&quot; infections have no or few symptoms. They may, however, still spread the disease.

==Pathophysiology==

The life cycle of &quot;Giardia&quot; consists of a cyst form and a trophozoite form. The cyst form is infectious and once it has found a host, transforms into the trophozoite form. This trophozoite attaches to the intestinal wall and replicates within the gut. As trophozoites continue along the gastrointestinal tract, they convert back to their cyst form which is then excreted with faeces. Ingestion of only a few of these cysts is needed to generate infection in another host.

Infection with &quot;Giardia&quot; results in decreased expression of brush border enzymes, morphological changes to the microvillus, increased intestinal permeability, and programmed cell death of small intestinal epithelial cells. Both trophozoites and cysts are contained within the gastrointestinal tract and do not invade beyond it.

The attachment of trophozoites causes villous flattening and inhibition of enzymes that break down disaccharide sugars in the intestines. Ultimately, the community of microorganisms that lives in the intestine may overgrow and may be the cause of further symptoms, though this idea has not been fully investigated. The alteration of the villi leads to an inability of nutrient and water absorption from the intestine, resulting in diarrhoea, one of the predominant symptoms. In the case of asymptomatic giardiasis, there can be malabsorption with or without histological changes to the small intestine. The degree to which malabsorption occurs in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases is highly varied.

The species &quot;Giardia intestinalis&quot; uses enzymes that break down proteins to attack the villi of the brush border and appears to increase crypt cell proliferation and crypt length of crypt cells existing on the sides of the villi. On an immunological level, activated host T lymphocytes attack endothelial cells that have been injured to remove the cell. This occurs after the disruption of proteins that connect brush border endothelial cells to one another. The result is increased intestinal permeability.

There appears to be a further increase in programmed enterocyte cell death by &quot;Giardia intestinalis&quot;, which further damages the intestinal barrier and increases permeability. There is significant upregulation of the programmed cell death cascade by the parasite, and substantial downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and upregulation of the proapoptotic protein Bax. These connections suggest a role of caspase-dependent apoptosis in the pathogenesis of giardiasis.

&quot;Giardia&quot; protects its growth by reducing the formation of the gas nitric oxide by consuming all local arginine, which is the amino acid necessary to make nitric oxide. Arginine starvation is known to be a cause of programmed cell death, and local removal is a strong apoptotic agent.

== Host defence ==
Host defence against &quot;Giardia&quot; consists of natural barriers, production of nitric oxide, and activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems.

=== Natural barriers ===
Natural barriers defend against the parasite entering the host&#x27;s body. Natural barriers consist of mucus layers, bile salt, proteases, and lipases. Additionally, peristalsis and the renewal of enterocytes provide further protection against parasites.

=== Nitric oxide production ===
Nitric oxide does not kill the parasite, but it inhibits the growth of trophozoites as well as excystation and encystation.

=== Innate immune system ===

==== Lectin pathway of complement ====
The lectin pathway of complement is activated by mannose-binding lectin (MBL) which binds to N-acetylglucosamine. N-acetylglucosamine is a ligand for MBL and is present on the surface of &quot;Giardia&quot;.

==== The classical pathway of complement ====
The classical pathway of complement is activated by antibodies specific against &quot;Giardia&quot;.

=== Adaptive immune system ===

==== Antibodies ====
Antibodies inhibit parasite replication and also induce parasite death via the classical pathway of complement.

Infection with &quot;Giardia&quot; typically results in a strong antibody response against the parasite. While IgG is made in significant amounts, IgA is believed to be more important in parasite control. IgA is the most abundant isotype in intestinal secretions, and it is also the dominant isotype in a mother&#x27;s milk. Antibodies in a mother&#x27;s milk protect children against giardiasis (passive immunisation).

==== T-cells ====
The major aspect of adaptive immune responses is the T-cell response. &quot;Giardia&quot; is an extracellular pathogen. Therefore CD4+ helper T-cells are primarily responsible for this protective effect.

One role of helper T-cells is to promote antibody production and isotype switching. Other roles include cytokine production (Il-4, IL-9) to help recruit other effector cells of the immune response.

==Diagnosis==

* According to the CDC, the detection of antigens on the surface of organisms in stool specimens is the current test of choice for diagnosis of giardiasis and provides increased sensitivity over more common microscopy techniques.
* A trichrome stain of preserved stool is another method used to detect &quot;Giardia&quot;.
* Microscopic examination of the stool can be performed for diagnosis. This method is not preferred, however, due to inconsistent shedding of trophozoites and cysts in infected hosts. Multiple samples over some time, typically one week, must be examined.
* The Entero-Test uses a gelatin capsule with an attached thread. One end is attached to the inner aspect of the host&#x27;s cheek, and the capsule is swallowed. Later, the thread is withdrawn and shaken in saline to release trophozoites which can be detected with a microscope. The sensitivity of this test is low, however, and is not routinely used for diagnosis.
* Immunologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing may be used for diagnosis. These tests are capable of a 90% detection rate or more.

Although hydrogen breath tests indicate poorer rates of carbohydrate absorption in those asymptomatically infected, such tests are not diagnostic of infection. Serological tests are not helpful in diagnosis.

==Prevention==
The CDC recommends hand-washing and avoiding potentially contaminated food and untreated water.

Boiling water contaminated with &quot;Giardia&quot; effectively kills infectious cysts. Chemical disinfectants or filters may be used. Iodine-based disinfectants are preferred over chlorination as the latter is ineffective at destroying cysts.

Although the evidence linking the drinking of water in the North American wilderness and giardiasis has been questioned, a number of studies raise concern. Most if not all CDC verified backcountry giardiasis outbreaks have been attributed to water. Surveillance data (for 2013 and 2014) reports six outbreaks (96 cases) of waterborne giardiasis contracted from rivers, streams or springs and less than 1% of reported giardiasis cases are associated with outbreaks.

Person-to-person transmission accounts for the majority of &quot;Giardia&quot; infections and is usually associated with poor hygiene and sanitation. &quot;Giardia&quot; is often found on the surface of the ground, in the soil, in undercooked foods, and in water, and on hands that have not been properly cleaned after handling infected faeces. Water-borne transmission is associated with the ingestion of contaminated water. In the U.S., outbreaks typically occur in small water systems using inadequately treated surface water. Venereal transmission happens through faecal-oral contamination. Additionally, nappy/diaper changing and inadequate handwashing are risk factors for transmission from infected children. Lastly, food-borne epidemics of &quot;Giardia&quot; have developed through the contamination of food by infected food-handlers.

=== Vaccine ===
There are no vaccines for humans yet, however, there are several vaccine candidates in development. They are targeting: recombinant proteins, DNA vaccines, variant-specific surface proteins (VSP), cyst wall proteins (CWP), giadins, and enzymes. Researchers at CONICET have produced an oral vaccine after engineering customised proteins mimicking those expressed on the surface of Giardia trophozoites. The vaccine has proven effective in mice.

At present, one commercially available vaccine exists – GiardiaVax, made from &quot;G. lamblia&quot; whole trophozoite lysate. It is a vaccine for veterinary use only in dogs and cats. GiardiaVax should promote the production of specific antibodies.

==Treatment==
Treatment is not always necessary as the infection usually resolves on its own. However, if the illness is acute or symptoms persist and medications are needed to treat it, a nitroimidazole medication is used such as metronidazole, tinidazole, secnidazole or ornidazole.

The World Health Organisation and Infectious Disease Society of America recommend metronidazole as first-line therapy. The US CDC lists metronidazole, tinidazole, and nitazoxanide as effective first-line therapies; of these three, only nitazoxanide and tinidazole are approved for the treatment of giardiasis by the US FDA. A meta-analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration in 2012 found that compared to the standard of metronidazole, albendazole had equivalent efficacy while having fewer side effects, such as gastrointestinal or neurologic issues. Other meta-analyses have reached similar conclusions. Both medications need a five to ten-day-long course; albendazole is taken once a day, while metronidazole needs to be taken three times a day. The evidence for comparing metronidazole to other alternatives such as mebendazole, tinidazole, or nitazoxanide was felt to be of very low quality. While tinidazole has side effects and efficacy similar to those of metronidazole, it is administered with a single dose.

Resistance has been seen clinically to both nitroimidazoles and albendazole, but not nitazoxanide, though nitazoxanide resistance has been induced in research laboratories. The exact mechanism of resistance to all of these medications is not well understood. In the case of nitroimidazole-resistant strains of &quot;Giardia&quot;, other drugs are available which have shown efficacy in treatment including quinacrine, nitazoxanide, bacitracin zinc, furazolidone and paromomycin. Mepacrine may also be used for refractory cases.

Probiotics, when given in combination with the standard treatment, have been shown to assist with clearance of &quot;Giardia&quot;.

During pregnancy, paromomycin is the preferred treatment drug because of its poor intestinal absorption, resulting in less exposure to the foetus. Alternatively, metronidazole can be used after the first trimester as there has been wide experience in its use for trichomonas in pregnancy.

==Prognosis==
In people with a properly functioning immune system, infection may resolve without medication. A small portion, however, develop a chronic infection. People with an impaired immune system are at higher risk of chronic infection. Medication is an effective cure for nearly all people although there is growing drug-resistance.

Children with chronic giardiasis are at risk for failure to thrive as well as more long-lasting sequelae such as growth stunting. Up to half of infected people develop a temporary lactose intolerance leading to symptoms that may mimic a chronic infection. Some people experience post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome after the infection has cleared. Giardiasis has also been implicated in the development of food allergies. This is thought to be due to its effect on intestinal permeability.

==Epidemiology==

In some developing countries &quot;Giardia&quot; is present in 30% of the population. In the United States it is estimated that it is present in 3–7% of the population. Giardiasis is associated with impaired growth and development in children, particularly influencing a country&#x27;s economic growth by affecting Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) rates.

The number of reported cases in the United States in 2018 was 15,584. All states that classify giardiasis as a notifiable disease had cases of giardiasis. The states of Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Vermont did not notify the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding cases in 2018. There are seasonal trends associated with giardiasis. July, August, and September are the months with the highest incidence of giardiasis in the United States.

In the ECDC&#x27;s (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) annual epidemiological report containing 2014 data, 17,278 confirmed giardiasis cases were reported by 23 of the 31 countries that are members of the EU/EEA. Germany reported the highest number at 4,011 cases. Following Germany, the UK reported 3,628 confirmed giardiasis cases. Together, this accounts for 44% of total reported cases.

==Research==
Some intestinal parasitic infections may play a role in irritable bowel syndrome and other long-term sequelae such as chronic fatigue. The mechanism of transformation from cyst to trophozoites has not been characterised but may help develop drug targets for treatment-resistant &quot;Giardia&quot;. The interaction between &quot;Giardia&quot; and host immunity, internal flora, and other pathogens is not well understood.In vitro cell cultures have been widely used to study host-parasite interactions, and human enteroids are now being used as non-transformed intestinal epithelial cell infection models for G. intestinalis and other pathogens.

The main congress about giardiasis is the &quot;International Giardia and Cryptosporidium Conference&quot; (IGCC). A summary of results presented at the most recent edition (2019, in Rouen, France) is available.

==Other animals==
In both cats and dogs, giardiasis usually responds to metronidazole and fenbendazole. Metronidazole in pregnant cats can cause developmental malformations. Many cats dislike the taste of fenbendazole. Giardiasis has been shown to decrease weight in livestock.

<text>Neuss (; written &quot;Neuß&quot; until 1968; ; ) is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is on the west bank of the Rhine opposite Düsseldorf. Neuss is the largest city within the Rhein-Kreis Neuss district. It is primarily known for its historic Roman sites, as well as the annual Neusser Bürger-Schützenfest. Neuss and Trier share the title of &quot;Germany&#x27;s oldest city&quot;, and in 1984 Neuss celebrated the 2000th anniversary of its founding in 16 BCE.

== History ==

=== Roman period ===

Neuss was founded by the Romans in 16 BC as a military fortification (&quot;castrum&quot;) with the current city to the north of the castrum, at the confluence of the rivers Rhine and Erft, with the name of Novaesium. 
Legio XVI Gallica (&quot;Gallic 16th Legion&quot;) of the Roman army was stationed here in 43–70 AD. It was disbanded after surrendering during the Batavian rebellion (AD 70).

Later a civil settlement was founded in the area of today&#x27;s centre of the town during the 1st century AD. Novaesium, together with Trier (&quot;Augusta Treverorum&quot;), is one of the three oldest Roman settlements in Germany.

=== Middle Ages ===
Neuss grew during the Middle Ages because of its prime location on several routes, by the crossing of the great Rhine valley, and with its harbour and ferry. During the 10th century, the remains of the martyr and tribune Saint Quirinus, not to be confused with the Roman god Quirinus, had been relocated to Neuss. This resulted in pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Quirinus even from countries beyond the borders of the Holy Roman Empire. Neuss was first documented as a town in 1138.

One of the main events in the town&#x27;s history is the siege of the town in 1474–75 by Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, that lasted for nearly a year. The citizens of Neuss withstood the siege and were therefore rewarded by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III. The town was granted the right to mint its own coins and to carry the imperial coat of arms, the imperial eagle and the crown, in the town&#x27;s own coat of arms. Neuss became a member of the Hanseatic League, although it was never accepted by the other members of the League.

=== Early modernity ===
In 1586, more than two-thirds of the city was destroyed by fire, and several wars during the reign of King Louis XIV of France resulted in worsening finances for Neuss. Its importance as a place for trading declined rapidly, and from the mid-17th century onwards, Neuss became a place only important for its agriculture.

Until the late 18th century, Neuss belonged to the Electorate of Cologne. From 1794 to 1814, Neuss was part of France during the reign of Napoleon. In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, Neuss became part of the Kingdom of Prussia, and was reorganized as a district with the municipalities of Neuss, Dormagen, Nettesheim, Nievenheim, Rommerskirchen and Zons. The town had a population of 6,333 at that time. It was part of the Prussian Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg (1815–22) and its successor, the Rhine Province (1822–1946).

=== 19th century – present ===
Neuss regained its economic power in the 19th century, with expansion of the harbour in 1835, and increasing industrial activity. The city&#x27;s boundaries were expanded in 1881. Neuss became part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946.

In 1968 the spelling of the name was changed from &quot;Neuß&quot; to &quot;Neuss&quot;. In 1975 the town of Neuss and the district of Grevenbroich were joined to form the district of Rhein-Kreis Neuss with a population of 440,000 and its seat of government in Neuss. Neuss is also home to Toshiba&#x27;s European headquarters.

=== Jewish history ===

A Jewish community has been documented in the city since the High Middle Ages. The earliest documentation of Jews in the city is from 1096, when Jews from Cologne fleeing from Crusaders were sheltered in the city by the Archbishop of Cologne . Nevertheless, about 200 of them (men, women, and children) were slaughtered by Crusaders. This all was in the context of what is known as the Rhineland massacres.

There is however no indication that Neuss already had an organized Jewish community in 1096; It is however certain that there was one in the Staufer period from the late 12th century onwards, in the context of a general influx of merchants into the city at the time.

According to Ephraim of Bonn, on 11 January 1197, multiple members of the Jewish community were put to death as revenge for the killing of a Christian girl by a mentally ill Jew. The killer and several of his close relatives were gruesomely executed. They seem to have been allowed a Jewish funeral: their bodies were brought – presumably by boat – to Xanten, where they were buried alongside victims of the Rhineland massacres of 1096.

The community in the High Middle Ages at first resided in the area where merchants lived, between the and the market. The passage to the haven&#x27;s loading place was known as the &quot;Judensteg&quot;. By the year 1300 however the &quot;Judensteg&quot; was now inhabited by Christians, the Jews having moved to the area around the &quot;Glockhammer&quot;, where their synagogue and school were also located. The area was not exactly a ghetto, as it was not sealed, and Christians also lived there.

From the 14th century onwards the Jews faced increasing economic competition, firstly due the loss of their advantageous former location near the docks, and later because of the loss of their monopoly in money lending, with the arrival of bankers from Lombardy and Cahors.

The city was hit by the Black Death in 1348–49, and the community suffered from gruesome persecutions during that time, as was the case elsewhere in Europe. In the wake of the plague, the community was numerically decimated and economically weakened. A wave of religious extremism and intolerance swept the area at the time, and the Jews were increasingly pressured and became objects of political infighting: In the year 1424, Jews were for a time expelled from the city; this was meant as a middle finger to the &quot;Landesherr&quot;, who had placed the Jews under his protection.

The Jews later came back, but were ultimately expelled again in 1464. The Archbishop of Cologne Ruprecht von der Pfalz visited the city on 5 May and met with mayors, aldermen, and the council in an attempt to halt the expulsion, but to no avail. Jews were from now on banned from residing in the city, and from staying overnight within city walls. In 1694, Jews were given permission to hold a cattle market in front of the &quot;Obertor&quot;. Facing overdue lump sum payments, in 1704 the city instored a special tax on Jews entering the city known as the &quot;Judenleibzoll&quot;.

In 1794 during the War of the First Coalition, Neuss fell under French control, and all discriminatory anti-Jewish laws were subsequently abrogated. It was only in 1808 however, in a context of nascent industrialization and population growth, that for the first time in centuries a Jewish family moved to the city: That of the butcher Josef Großmann, who had come from Hülchrath. The community slowly rose in number: in 1830, there were around 100 Jews out of a population of approximately 8000. The community kept on growing in size throughout the century. 

Jews who moved to Neuss came from surrounding rural areas in the Rhineland, and as a result were more conservative and shaped by rural life than their counterparts in other German cities. Popular innovations in the time of the &quot;Haskalah&quot; such as religious services in German did not take root here: they continued in Hebrew. As a general rule of thumb, Neuss Jews were more religious than in other German cities.

Relations between Jews and Christians were generally good at the time: they lived one next to another, and one could find Christians performing forbidden tasks such as lighting/extinguishing fires in Jewish homes on Shabbat.

A fracture in this peace took place in 1834 however: In the &quot;Niederrhein&quot; area blood libel rumors spread around, leading to a wave of anti-Jewish violence: Synagogues were set on fire in Gindorf and ; in , Wevelinghoven and elsewhere fierce fighting took place between vigilantes and hussars. Neuss was not left unaffected either, with crowds strolling down the streets chanting anti-Jewish songs, with the epicenter being the poor areas of Neuss around the &quot;Viehmarkt&quot;. This situation lasted for days, until a contingent of soldiers was moved into the city to quell the unrest.

On 29 March 1867, the was unveiled, designed by the Prussian architect Friedrich Weise and built in the popular Orientalist style. The city held celebrations for 3 days upon its inauguration. Despite serving only about 1% of the population, the Synagogue was a proud hallmark of the Neuss skyline. The synagogue community&#x27;s size peaked at 316 members in 1890.

After the acquittal of the Jewish butcher Adolf Buschoff in the 1892 , antisemitic violence took place in nearby Neuss: Jewish-owned property was set on fire, and Jewish families were sent threatening messages. About a quarter of the community left the city.
In 1933, there were no more than 227 citizens of Jewish faith in Neuss. From that year onwards they suffered increasing persecution by the Nazis. Few went into exile on time. Then began the so-called &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot; and the deportations. On 22 July 1942, the last inhabitant of the &#x27; at Küpperstaße 2 was put on a train from Aachen to Theresienstadt. On 23 November 1942, Neuss was cynically declared &quot;Judenrein&quot;. (= clean of Jews)

However, there was still a handful of Jews who survived through hiding, or who were not targeted due to being married to &quot;Aryans&quot;.

The exact number of Jewish victims of the Nazi regime is not known with certainty. However, one can find the names of 204 murdered Jews who had some sort of link to Neuss on a monument by Ulrich Rückriem. A significant amount of &quot;Stolpersteine&quot; can be found around the city.

Since the 1990s the community has enjoyed a revival thanks to an influx of Jews from the ex-USSR. In 2021, it was estimated that around 550 Jews lived in Neuss.

<text>Isa bin Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa (; 3 June 1933 – 6 March 1999) was a Bahraini royal who served as the first Emir of Bahrain from 1961 until his death in 1999 (after having previously ruled as Hakim of Bahrain until 16 August 1971).

Born in Jasra, Bahrain, he became emir upon the death of his father, Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa.

==Early life and reign==

Isa was born in Jasra to Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa and Mouza bint Hamad Al Khalifa (1933-2009), the daughter of Hamad ibn Abdullah Al Khalifa, and succeeded his father as emir upon his death in November 1961. He was installed on 16 December.

Isa visited Ayetollah Mohsin Al Hakim in Najaf in 1968 to indicate his keenness to reinforce relationships with the Shia.

During his reign, Bahrain gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1971. While the government initially considered joining the United Arab Emirates, Isa had his country withdraw (along with Qatar) over his dissatisfaction with the proposed constitution . He then attempted to introduce a moderate form of parliamentary democracy, and men (though not women) were given the vote in parliamentary elections in 1973. In August 1975, however, he dissolved Parliament because it refused to pass the government-sponsored State Security Law of 1974. The parliamentary system was never restored in his lifetime and forced the emir to contend with occasional protests from the leftist and Islamist camps, which reached their peak in 1994 (see: &quot;History of Bahrain&quot;). 

During his reign there was an arrangement between him and his brother, Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman, whereby the Emir was assigned a diplomatic and ceremonial role, while Khalifa controlled the government and economy as Prime Minister.

Isa was one of the founders of the Dar Al Maal Al Islami Trust which was initiated by Saudi royal Mohammed bin Faisal Al Saud, King Faisal&#x27;s son, in 1981.

==Marriage and children==

Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa had one wife, his cousin Sheikha Hessa bint Salman Al Khalifa (1933–2009), daughter of Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa. They married on 8 May 1949. They had five sons and four daughters:

* Hamad bin Isa (1950–), current king
* Rashed bin Isa (–17 December 2011)
* Mohamed bin Isa, Commander of the National Guard (1997–2008)
* Abdullah bin Isa, Vice President of the Higher Committee for the Horseback riding club
* Ali bin Isa, Minister of the Royal Court Affairs (1955–)
* Munira bint Isa
* Maryam bint Isa
* Shaikha bint Isa
* Noura bint Isa

==Legacy and death==

During his 38 years as Emir, the economic transformation of Bahrain into a modern nation and a key financial centre in the Persian Gulf area took place. Nevertheless, critics note that he also dissolved Parliament, taking on absolute power.

Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa died of a heart attack on 6 March 1999 at the Government House in Manama, shortly after a meeting with the United States defense secretary William Cohen. He was 67. The last function he attended was the funeral of King Hussein, which took place less than a month before his death.

US President Bill Clinton expressed &quot;deep sadness&quot;, as did Graham at the news of the emir&#x27;s death calling him &quot;a good friend of peace&quot;. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan also expressed &quot;great sadness&quot;, and described the emir as &quot;a force for stability&quot; in the region. He was buried at the Al-Rifa&#x27;a cemetery. 

He was succeeded by his eldest son, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.

<text>Arnold Henry Kegel (February 21, 1894 – March 1, 1972) was an American gynecologist who invented the Kegel perineometer (an instrument for measuring the strength of voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles) and Kegel exercises (squeezing of the muscles of the pelvic floor) as non-surgical treatment of urinary incontinence from perineal muscle weakness and/or laxity. Pelvic floor exercises are considered first-line treatment for urinary stress incontinence and any type of female incontinence and female genital prolapse, with evidence supporting its use from systematic reviews of randomized trials in the Cochrane Library amongst others. Kegel first published his ideas in 1948. He was Assistant Professor of Gynecology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.

<text>William Oliver Lipinski (born December 22, 1937) is an American politician and lobbyist who was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 2005, representing a district in Chicago.

==Life and career==
===Pre-congressional career===
He was born in Chicago, and was educated at Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa. Lipinski served in the United States Army Reserve from 1961 to 1967. He was given a patronage job as public administrator with the Chicago Park District of the city of Chicago.

In 1975, Mayor Richard J. Daley named him as the Democratic committeeman for Chicago&#x27;s 23rd Ward, in the southwestern portion of the city. In the same year, Lipinski was elected to the Chicago City Council as the alderman for the 23rd Ward. Lipinski remained an alderman until he became a congressman in 1983.

===Congressional career===
In 1982, he challenged incumbent Democrat John G. Fary in the primary for , which included most of southwestern Chicago. He won largely by running up the totals in his city council district, and was handily elected in November.

Lipinski became the mentor of future City Clerk of Chicago, James Laski, who by 1988 had become chief-of-staff of the joint Democrat Service Office for the city&#x27;s southwest side, and acted as a personal aide to Lipinski.

Lipinski played an important role in getting federal funding for the CTA Orange Line.

Lipinski was reelected four times from the 5th Congressional District with almost no difficulty. After the 1990 census, however, his district was merged with the 3rd district, represented by a longtime friend, Marty Russo. Lipinski defeated Russo in the 1992 Democratic primary, mainly by running up his margins in the Chicago portion of the district—which is virtually coextensive with the 23rd Ward. This all but assured him of a sixth term. He was reelected five more times from this district, facing serious opposition only once, in 1994.

While in the House, Lipinski served on the Transportation Committee; his district included Midway Airport and also had more railroad crossings than any other district.

Lipinski was conservative by national Democratic standards. He strongly opposed abortion, and described himself as a staunch conservative on foreign policy. He was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition.

Lipinski endorsed Bill Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000.

During the 2004 election cycle, Lipinski easily won the primary election, which practically assured him of a 12th term in Congress. On August 13, 2004, however, Lipinski withdrew his name from the November 2 general election ballot, announcing that he would retire at the end of his 11th term, which expired on January 3, 2005. As the 23rd Ward committeeman, he was able to persuade state Democratic party leaders to name his son, Dan Lipinski, a University of Tennessee professor, to replace him on the ballot. The younger Lipinski won all of his reelection bids up until 2020, when he lost his primary election in 2020 to Marie Newman.

===Lobbying career===
In 2007, after leaving the House of Representatives, Lipinski opened a one-man lobbying firm. In its first eight years, the firm was paid $4 million by clients with business before the House Transportation Committee: the Chicago Transit Authority, Metra, BNSF Railway, and the Association of American Railroads. Lipinski was an influential member of the Transportation Committee, and his son served on the committee. This was described as concerning by Public Citizen; the younger Lipinski said that his father has not lobbied him and has pledged not to do so.

<doc id="412015" wikidata="Q15304525" url="?curid=412015" title="Seraglio">
<text>A seraglio, serail, seray or saray (from , via Turkish, Italian and French) is a castle, palace or government building which was considered to have particular administrative importance in various parts of the former Ottoman Empire.

&quot;The Seraglio&quot; may refer specifically to the Topkapı Palace, the residence of the former Ottoman sultans in Istanbul (known as Constantinople in English at the time of Ottoman rule).
The term can also refer to other traditional Turkish palaces (every imperial prince had his own) and other grand houses built around courtyards.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;seraglio&quot;, from Italian, has been used in English since 1581. 
The Italian Treccani dictionary gives two derivations:
# one via or (with the variants &quot;seraya&quot; or &quot;saraya&quot;), which comes from or, per derivation, the enclosed court for the wives and concubines of the harem of a house or palace (see );
# the other — in the sense of enclosure — from Late/, derived from Classical Latin , , which comes from , .

The term may also be spelt &quot;serail&quot;, via French influence, based on the Italian term.

=== Harem ===


Since the Topkapı Palace&#x27;s harem (commonly known as &quot;The Seraglio harem&quot;) grew in prominence and fame, the term saray/serail/seraglio began also being commonly used as a synonym of &quot;harem&quot;, the sequestered living quarters used by wives and concubines in an Ottoman household.

== In Ottoman culture ==


Besides the Topkapı Palace (&quot;The Seraglio&quot;), the most famous seray is the Grand Serail of Beirut () in Lebanon, which is the headquarters of the prime minister. It is situated atop a hill in downtown Beirut a few blocks away from the Lebanese Parliament. The hill was the site of an Ottoman army base from the 1840s, which was built up, fortified, and expanded in the 1850s. At first it was known as &quot;al quishla&quot;, from the Turkish word &quot;kışla&quot;, meaning barracks.

Other examples include:
* the Grand Serail of Aleppo, in Syria; a French construction inspired to the Ottoman tradition.
* the Red Serail of Tripoli, in Libya. Located in central Tripoli, it also houses a museum.
* the new presidential palace of Turkey, completed in 2014, popularly called &quot;Ak Saray&quot; (&quot;White Palace&quot;).

Seventeen saraya were established in Palestine during Ottoman rule; most were established by regional officials and their families such as the Ridwan dynasty and Zahir al-Umar and his family.

== In Italy ==
In modern Italian the word is spelled . It may refer to a wall or structure, either for defence — such as the Serraglio of Villafranca di Verona, a defensive wall built by the Scaligeri — or for containment, for example of caged wild animals. The ghettoes established in many Italian cities following the promulgation by Pope Paul IV in 1555 of the papal bull &quot;Cum nimis absurdum&quot; were initially called , .

Seraglio is also the name of the artificial island on which Mantua is located.

== In literature and the arts ==
In the context of the fashion, the seraglio became the subject of works of art, the most famous perhaps being Mozart&#x27;s 1782 Singspiel, (&quot;The Abduction from the Seraglio&quot;), based on Christoph Friedrich Bretzner&#x27;s 1781 (&quot;Belmonte and Konstanze, or The Abduction from the Seraglio&quot;). In Montesquieu&#x27;s 1721 &quot;Persian Letters&quot;, one of the main characters, a Persian from the city of Isfahan, is described as an occupant of a seraglio.

== Homophones ==
&quot;Saraya&quot; is also used as a military unit title in the Arab world. In this case the Arabic is , a different word from &quot;saraya&quot; () as in a building. The etymology is also different from the building: is from Arabic and communicates the idea of a &quot;private group&quot;. However the plural is (&quot;saraya&quot;), indistinguishable from the term &quot;saraya&quot; which is a variant (in the singular) of saray (the building).

The normal translation for is &quot;company&quot; (military unit), but in the case of the Lebanese Resistance Saraya the term is often arbitrarily translated as &quot;brigades&quot;.

Another example is the Syrian Defense Saraya.

<doc id="412017" wikidata="Q718127" url="?curid=412017" title="Luis Gutiérrez">
<text>Luis Vicente Gutiérrez (born December 10, 1953) is an American politician. He served as the U.S. representative for from 1993 to 2019. From 1986 until his election to Congress, he served as a member of the Chicago City Council representing the 26th ward. He is a member of the Democratic Party and was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus during his tenure in the House. In the 113th Congress, with his 20 years of service, Gutiérrez became, along with Bobby Rush, the longest serving member of the Illinois House delegation, and so was occasionally referred to as the unofficial &quot;dean&quot; of the delegation.

Of Puerto Rican descent, he is a current supporter of Puerto Rican independence, and the Vieques movement. Gutiérrez is also an outspoken advocate of workers&#x27; rights, LGBT rights, gender equality, and other liberal and progressive causes. In 2010, Frank Sharry of America&#x27;s Voice, an immigration reform advocacy group, said of Gutiérrez: &quot;He&#x27;s as close as the Latino community has to a Martin Luther King figure.&quot; His supporters have given him the nickname &quot;El Gallito&quot; – the little fighting rooster – in reference to his fiery oratory and political prowess.

His district, the 4th congressional district, was featured by &quot;The Economist&quot; as one of the most strangely drawn and gerrymandered congressional districts in the country and has been nicknamed &quot;earmuffs&quot; due to its shape. It was created to pack two majority Hispanic parts of Chicago into one district, thereby creating a majority Hispanic district.

In November 2017, Gutiérrez announced that he would retire from Congress at the end of his current term, and not seek re-election in 2018. As of 2021, Gutiérrez lives in Puerto Rico.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Gutiérrez was born and raised in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, then an immigrant and working-class community. His mother was an assembly-line worker, and his father was a cab driver. After his freshman year at St. Michael&#x27;s High School, his parents moved the family to their hometown of San Sebastián, Puerto Rico. Gutiérrez, who had never before visited the island, reluctantly followed his parents; there, he learned to speak Spanish. Gutiérrez said of his experience moving from Chicago to Puerto Rico: &quot;In Lincoln Park, I had been called a spic, then, all of a sudden, I land on the island and everyone calls me &quot;gringo&quot; and &quot;Americanito&quot;. I learned to speak Spanish well.&quot;

In 1974, Gutiérrez returned to Chicago and enrolled at Northeastern Illinois University. He got involved in student activism and social justice issues, writing for the student publication &quot;Que Ondee Sola&quot; and serving as the president of the Union for Puerto Rican Students. In 1976, while a senior at Northeastern Illinois, he began driving a cab in order to raise enough funds to visit his long-time girlfriend, Soraida, in Puerto Rico. In 1977, after graduating from Northeastern Illinois University with a degree in English, he returned to Puerto Rico and married Soraida. The couple returned to Chicago in 1978, and, unable to find other work, Gutiérrez took up taxi driving full-time. Gutiérrez eventually found work as a Chicago Public School teacher and later a child abuse caseworker with the Illinois Department of Children &amp; Family Services.

==Early political career==

===Campaign for 32nd ward Democratic committeeman===
In 1983, Gutiérrez left his job with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to run against incumbent Dan Rostenkowski for 32nd ward Democratic committeeman in the March 1984 primary election. To fund his campaign, Gutiérrez returned to driving a cab seven days a week, 14 hours a day. Gutiérrez&#x27;s work as a taxi driver grew his campaign fund to $6,000, against which Rostenkowski had hundreds of thousands of dollars. Reporting on Gutiérrez&#x27;s early political career, Jorge Casuso and Ben Joravsky of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;Gutiérrez thought he could win. Washington&#x27;s 1983 victory – the first local race Gutiérrez had voted in – had left him wildly optimistic. Before that, he didn&#x27;t think blacks, Hispanics and poor people could win a legitimate voice in local government.&quot;

Relying on his family and friends as campaign staff, Gutiérrez opened up his campaign office on North California Ave in Chicago&#x27;s Humboldt Park neighborhood. Gutiérrez collected over three-fourths of the 2,200 signatures he needed to qualify for the ballot on his own. Rostenkowski, then a twelve-term Congressman and Chair of the powerful House Ways &amp; Means Committee soundly defeated Gutiérrez, with 76% of the vote.

===Adviser to Harold Washington===
Following Gutiérrez&#x27;s loss to Dan Rostenkowski, he helped found the Cook County Coalition for New Politics in spring of 1984. The coalition was meant to be a grass-roots, independent, and multiracial counterweight to the Cook County Democratic Party.

Gutiérrez&#x27;s political activism and role as a rising leader in Chicago&#x27;s burgeoning Latino community caught the attention of Chicago&#x27;s first African-American Mayor – Harold Washington – who appointed him in August 1984 to the position of deputy superintendent in the Department of Streets and Sanitation.

Gutiérrez served as a deputy superintendent in the Washington administration and as an administrative assistant to the Mayor – serving on the Mayor&#x27;s committee on infrastructure.

In October 1984, a Molotov cocktail came crashing through the front living room window of Gutiérrez&#x27;s home. For a period of three months following the firebombing, his family lived in hotel rooms. The offenders were never identified, but Gutiérrez attributed the attack to &quot;culprits from the right ... opposed to reform and Mayor Washington&quot;.

In July 1985, in an effort to support Washington&#x27;s political reform movement, Gutiérrez founded the West Town-26th Ward Independent Political Organization (IPO). Like the Cook County Coalition for New Politics, the organization aimed to bring together residents of all races in support of progressive reform in Chicago. The Mayor attended the organization&#x27;s kick-off event, at which 100 names were added to the mailing list and $5,000 was raised.

===1986 Aldermanic election===

In December 1985, as a result of a November 1985 ward remap, district court judge Charles Norgle ordered a special election for March 18, 1986, in seven wards, including the 26th. The incumbent alderman of the 26th ward, Michael Nardulli, an Italian-American, chose not to seek re-election in the newly drawn majority Latino district. Gutiérrez declared his candidacy for alderman of the 26th ward and soon received the endorsement of Mayor Harold Washington. At the time of the election, opponents to Washington&#x27;s administration, led by Ed Vrdolyak of the 10th ward, controlled the City Council. This divide within city government was dubbed by the Chicago media as Council Wars. The 1986 special elections gave Washington the opportunity to take control of the city council. Because the six other special elections were all but decided, control of the council came down to the race in the 26th ward. Manuel Torres, then a member of the Democratic machine and Cook County Commissioner, also entered the race for 26th ward Alderman. Torres was endorsed by Vrdolyak, former mayor Jane Byrne, future mayor and then State&#x27;s Attorney Richard M. Daley, and machine Alderman Ed Burke and Dick Mell.

Gutiérrez&#x27;s campaign volunteers were primarily women, &quot;ex-hippies and ... community activists-black, white and Hispanic&quot;. With the campaign theme: &quot;Church, Family, Community&quot;, support from Mayor Harold Washington – who donated $12,000 to Gutiérrez – and the now 250 members of the West Town-26th Ward Independent Political Organization as volunteers, Gutiérrez bested Torres by 22 votes, a margin not large enough to avoid a run-off against Torres.

On the eve of the Gutiérrez-Torres run-off, Spanish language television aired the candidates&#x27; final debate. Gutiérrez, who spoke Spanish during the debate, outperformed Torres, who chose to speak entirely in English. Gutiérrez&#x27;s use of Spanish and his grass-roots organizing are credited for his 53%–47% victory over Torres. Gutiérrez is reported to have said during the election: &quot;My supporters could give a damn about the Democratic Party. They&#x27;re ready to work on whatever it is that moves socioeconomic justice ahead.&quot;

===Chicago City Council===
Upon entering the Chicago City Council, Gutiérrez, representing the 26th Ward, became Mayor Harold Washington&#x27;s unofficial floor leader, and leader of the Latinos in the council. Gutiérrez said of his role as unofficial Washington spokesman: &quot;There are only six or seven of us of the twenty-five [pro-Washington alderman] that say anything. You could say there&#x27;s only six or seven that have big mouths and want to talk all the time. But I figured it out-there&#x27;s only six or seven of us that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn&#x27;t have anything on, that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn&#x27;t done a favor for, that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn&#x27;t taken care of some problem, that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn&#x27;t have some dirt on. So, when you want to get up and take Eddie on, you got to be clean.&quot;

As a member of the city council, Gutiérrez was a key backer of the 1986 gay rights ordinance – which sought to ban discrimination based upon gender &amp; sexual orientation. He was also a proponent of local economic development and construction of affordable housing. He was referred to as a &quot;workhorse in the city council&quot; by political author Marable Manning.

In the 1987 municipal elections, Gutiérrez faced five opponents and was re-elected to the City Council with 66% of the vote. Following Washington&#x27;s death and the battle over who would succeed the deceased Mayor, Gutiérrez voted for African-American Alderman Timothy C. Evans over machine-backed Alderman Eugene Sawyer. In the 1989 Mayoral election, Gutiérrez endorsed State&#x27;s Attorney Richard M. Daley for Mayor, stating: &quot;I will have a great influence in determining the thrust and tone of the Daley administration`s progressive and liberal agendas.&quot;

Under Daley&#x27;s administration, Gutiérrez served as Chair of the Committee on Housing, Land Acquisition, Disposition, and Leases and Council President pro tempore, presiding over meetings in the Mayor&#x27;s absence.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;Election (1992)
In 1990, a court order created a new &quot;earmuff-shaped&quot; majority Latino congressional district, with two main sections in Chicago connected by a thin corridor in the suburbs. Four candidates announced their intention to run in the 1992 Democratic primary: Gutiérrez, Alderman Dick Mell of the 33rd ward, then Cook County Board of Appeals Commissioner Joseph Berrios, and Juan Soliz, former Alderman of 25th ward. Mell, the only white candidate, entered the race out of his &quot;personal dislike for Gutiérrez&quot;. Gutiérrez received the endorsement of Mayor Richard M. Daley, and all but one of his opponents, Juan Soliz, dropped out of the race.

Despite the district&#x27;s majority Mexican-American population and Soliz&#x27;s highly negative campaign, Gutiérrez won the Democratic primary 60%-40%. At his election night victory party, Gutiérrez stated: &quot;If a Puerto Rican kid from Humboldt Park can go to the Congress of the United States, it shows the American dream is possible.&quot; Billy Ocasio was later tapped to replace Gutierrez in the Chicago City Council in January 1993. In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee Hildegarde Rodriguez-Schieman 78%-22%. However, the 4th is a heavily Democratic district, and Gutiérrez had effectively clinched a seat in Congress with his primary win.

;Re-elections (1994-2010)

In 1994, Gutierrez defeated Soliz in the primary by an even larger margin 64%-36%, and won re-election to a second term in the general election with 75% of the vote. It would prove to be the lowest winning percentage in a general election in his career. From 1996 to 2008, Gutiérrez won re-election seven times, each time with more than 80% of the vote. In 2010, he won re-election to his tenth term with 77% of the vote.

Gutierrez pulled his petition for re-election in the 2018 race on November 27, 2017, effectively ending his congressional career. The next day Gutierrez held a press conference, he endorsed Cook County Commissioner Jesús &quot;Chuy&quot; García for the position. He did not rule out running for a future office.

===Tenure===

====Party leadership and caucus membership====

In 2009, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi appointed Gutiérrez Chair of the Democratic Caucus Immigration Task Force. He continued to serve as the Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Immigration Task Force until he left Congress. In these roles, he served as the Congress&#x27;s &quot;leading strategist and spokesperson on immigration issues&quot;.

====Constituent services====

Within his district, he ran workshops which helped more than 50,000 people begin the process of becoming US citizens, as well as programs to support education and English language learning among immigrants. Gutiérrez&#x27;s district office was the first congressional office to seek and receive community organization designation as a result of the depth and breadth of constituent services it provides.

====Consumer rights====

In February 2009, Gutiérrez introduced H.R. 1214, the &quot;Payday Loan Reform Act of 2009&quot;, co-sponsored by other members of the House of Representatives, including members of the House leadership. H.R. 1214 would cap the annual percentage rate (APR) for payday loans at 391 percent in the 23 states where it is now allowed to exceed 391 percent.

Gutiérrez also introduced an amendment to the Dodd-Frank bill that created the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau changing the formula by which banks were assessed to support the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.&#x27;s bailout fund. The change made assessments based on total assets instead of total deposits, adding $1.4 billion in increased FDIC payments in its first year in force while reducing the cost to smaller community banks.

====Immigration reform and immigrant rights====
Gutiérrez has been called the &quot;Moses of the Latinos&quot; due to his many years advocating for immigrant rights.

In his continued efforts to reform immigration, Gutiérrez has participated in two acts of non-violent civil disobedience outside of the White House. The first took place on May 1, 2010, where, following a speech delivered to hundreds at Lafayette Park, Gutiérrez marched with protesters to the White House and refused to leave until Presidential action was taken on immigration reform or he was arrested. Many of the protesters who joined Gutiérrez had signs that called for a Presidential moratorium on deportation and criticized recent anti-immigrant legislation passed in Arizona – SB 1070. Gutiérrez also joined the protesters in criticizing Arizona Governor Jan Brewer&#x27;s decision to sign the measure allowing racial profiling in the state-level enforcement of immigration laws.

On July 26, 2011, in response to a record-breaking one-million deportations under President Obama, and the President&#x27;s continued refusal to stop deportations of DREAM Act eligible youth, Gutiérrez and eleven labor, faith, and civil rights leaders were arrested outside the White House. A crowd of 2,500 came to support Gutiérrez and the eleven other leaders. A day before the arrest, President Obama sent a letter to Gutiérrez in which he stated that he would continue his administration&#x27;s deportation policy.

In 2009, and again in 2011, Gutiérrez went on a nationwide tour in support of comprehensive immigration reform and a moratorium on the deportation of families. The tours received widespread media attention and helped revive the nationwide discussion on immigration reform. Gutiérrez was the main speaker at the historic March 21, 2010, March for America rally at the capitol mall attended by over 200,000 people.

Gutiérrez was the first elected official to sponsor a version of the DREAM Act – legislation to allow undocumented youth brought to the United States as minors a pathway to citizenship – in 2001. In 2009 Gutiérrez introduced CIR-ASAP – Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America&#x27;s Security and Prosperity Act – a bill to create a pathway to citizenship for non-criminal undocumented immigrants and improve border security. The bill received over 100 co-sponsors and was endorsed by members of the business community and organized labor unions, including the AFL–CIO, United Food and Commercial Workers, and the Service Employees International Union. He described the bill before a Washington DC rally:

Following CIR-ASAP&#x27;s defeat in the Congress, Gutiérrez has been a main backer of the DREAM Act in the House.

Gutiérrez called former Maryland Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley a &quot;champion&quot; of immigration in 2014 when the two were working to oppose the White House&#x27;s deportation policy.

====Veterans&#x27; access to health care====

While Gutiérrez was a member of the Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee, the House passed legislation introduced by Gutiérrez that made treatment and counseling available to veterans who have been victims of sexual trauma. Gutiérrez also successfully expanded healthcare coverage to those exposed to Agent Orange and high levels of radiation during military service.

Gutiérrez&#x27;s assistance was pivotal in securing $92 million in additional healthcare and prosthetic funding for veterans.

====Puerto Rico====

Gutiérrez has been an advocate for human and civil rights of the Puerto Rican people. In the late 1990s and the 2000s, he was a leader in the Vieques movement, which sought to stop the United States military from using the inhabited island as a bomb testing ground. In May 2000, Gutiérrez was one of nearly two hundred people arrested (including fellow congresswoman Nydia Velázquez) for refusing to leave the natural habitat the US military wished to continue using as a bombing range. Gutierrez was ultimately successful: in May 2003, the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility on Vieques Island was closed; and in May 2004, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s last remaining base on Puerto Rico, the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station - which employed 1,000 local contractors and contributed $300 million to the local economy - was closed.

In 2011, Gutiérrez came out against human rights abuses occurring on the island – specifically police brutality perpetrated against University of Puerto Rico students critical of the island&#x27;s government and a law passed by the Fortuño government that sought to limit student&#x27;s freedom of speech. Gutiérrez also spoke out against a proposed pipeline which would degrade the island&#x27;s lush tropical habitat and potentially put residents living near the proposed pipeline in danger.

====Workers&#x27; rights====
Gutiérrez is a close ally of organized labor and has voted repeatedly to protect and expand workers&#x27; rights. In 2008, Gutiérrez was one of the principal elected officials that assisted workers of the Chicago-based Republic Windows and Doors during their successful sit-in. The workers had lost their jobs without advance notice, allegedly due to a refusal of credit from Bank of America after the bailout of the financial system. He met with workers and helped them broker a deal with Bank of America. Gutiérrez views his advocacy for workers&#x27; rights and immigrant rights as invariably related. He is frequently invited to speak and present before labor unions.

====North American Free Trade Agreement====
In 1994 Gutiérrez was a vocal opponent of NAFTA and ultimately voted against the measure because of the legislation&#x27;s failure to provide for worker retraining, protect against American job loss, and protect Mexican workers&#x27; collective bargaining rights. He criticized the role of Rahm Emanuel in particular for the deficiencies.

====Public transportation====
When the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) declared its plan to close down the Douglas Branch of the then Blue Line – which serves primarily working-class Latino communities – Gutiérrez successfully secured $320 million in federal funding to reconstruct Blue Line stops and pressed the CTA to re-instate full service. The Douglas Branch is now known as the Pink Line.

====Use of civil disobedience====
With a background as a community activist and organizer, Gutiérrez often uses non-violent civil disobedience when pushing political causes and legislation. He was arrested in May 2000 in protest of the US military using the inhabited Puerto Rican island of Vieques as a bombing range, and again in May 2010 in protest of presidential inaction on immigration reform. In 2010 and 2011, he was arrested protesting presidential inaction on immigration reform and a record-breaking one-million deportations under President Obama.

====Criticism====
Gutiérrez&#x27;s progressive political stances are often challenged by political commentators. Since 2008, Gutiérrez has been the subject of several critical stories in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times, detailing his relationship with former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, and the real estate dealings of Gutierrez and his family.

===Committee assignments===
Upon arriving to the United States House of Representatives, Gutiérrez attempted to organize the 63 incoming Democratic freshmen to support a reform agenda. He sent each one a copy of the book &quot;Adventures in Porkland: How Washington Wastes Your Money and Why They Won&#x27;t Stop&quot;. As a result of his attempts to organize the freshmen class, Gutiérrez was passed up by the House leadership for his first choice of the Ways and Means Committee, and his second choice of the Education Committee; instead, he was assigned to the Banking Committee and Veterans&#x27; Affairs. In response to being bypassed for his top committee choices as result of his reform advocacy, Gutiérrez charged that then-House Speaker Tom Foley was &quot;not a reformer in any sense&quot;.

Congressman Gutiérrez sat on the following House Committees:
*Judiciary Committee
**Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Border Security,
**Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations;

Gutiérrez was a member of the Judiciary Committee during the 110th and 111th Congress, serving on the Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law Subcommittee. During that same period of time, he was the Chair of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Financial Services Committee.

Gutiérrez was a member of the House Baltic Caucus, the Congressional Arts Caucus and the United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus.

==Mayoral candidacy speculation==
Gutiérrez&#x27; name has often been mentioned as a potential candidate for Mayor of Chicago. In 2006, he explored running for mayor of Chicago against incumbent Richard M. Daley, but announced in November that he would remain in Congress.

After Daley declared his retirement in 2011, Gutiérrez&#x27; name was once again floated as a potential mayoral candidate. In an effort to draft the Congressman into the race, students formed chapters of &quot;Students for Luis Gutiérrez&quot; at six colleges and two Chicago public high schools; but in October, Gutiérrez removed his name from consideration, stating, &quot;I have an obligation not to give up on the fight I&#x27;ve already begun. I have unfinished business to complete&quot;, in reference to his work on immigration reform in the United States Congress.

After mayor Rahm Emanuel dropped out of the 2019 mayoral election in early September 2018, Gutiérrez stated that he was considering either running himself, or having Jesús &quot;Chuy&quot; García (the 2015 mayoral runner-up who was, at the time, running as the Democratic nominee to succeed Gutiérrez in congress) run for mayor. Ultimately, on September 12 (a week after declaring interest), he opted against running, and publicly called for Garcia to run. By the start of October, Garcia had declared that he would not be running either.

==Personal life==
Gutiérrez has been married to Soraida Arocho Gutiérrez since 1977. Together, they have two daughters – Omaira and Jessica. Jessica&#x27;s middle name – Washington – comes from the late Mayor Harold Washington, a close friend and mentor of Gutiérrez. Soraida battled and survived cancer in the 2000s.

Roberto Maldonado, 26th ward alderman and former Cook County Commissioner, is Gutiérrez&#x27; former brother-in-law.

Gutiérrez is an avid golfer.

<doc id="412019" wikidata="Q3236730" url="?curid=412019" title="Leslieville">
<text>Leslieville is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, situated east of the Don River. It is bounded by the Canadian National railway line and Gerrard Street to the north, McGee Street to the west, Eastern Avenue to south, and Coxwell Avenue to the east. 

==History==
This east-end neighbourhood forms part of the broader neighbourhood of South Riverdale. Leslieville began as a small village in the 1850s, which grew up around the Toronto Nurseries owned by George Leslie (1804-1893) and sons, after whom the community is named. Most of Leslieville&#x27;s residents were gardeners or were employed at one of the brick-making factories in the area.
Leslie&#x27;s home at Queen and Leslie no longer exists but the general store remains on Queen east of Jones Avenue.

Alexander Muir, the composer of &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot;, was the first principal of the Leslieville Public School, one of the first buildings in the village. Muir was inspired when a brilliant maple leaf fell on his jacket from a Leslieville tree. That tree fell on July 19, 2013, and only its trunk exists today in front of Maple Cottage within Maple Leaf Forever Park. Its offspring still grows in the park behind the cottage.

For decades, South Riverdale was home to light industry, particularly along Eastern Ave. south of Queen St. Metal processing and tanning were notable industries which, along with other industrial activity, left Leslieville and South Riverdale with a legacy of contaminated land. In 2000, the A.R. Clarke Tannery(c.1876 and now C.C. Leather Inc) went up in flames, burning for days and unleashing toxic ash on the surrounding neighbourhood. Almost all these industrial areas have now been abandoned and are being redeveloped.

Leslieville once mainly housed those who worked in the factories, and their departure has greatly changed the area. The reduction in air pollution and fumes have made it much more appealing to members of the middle and creative class. Several industrial buildings in the immediate area, including north along Carlaw, have been revamped into condominiums. Large film studios have opened in some of the former industrial areas, including Cinevillage and Showline Studios. Just to the south, in the Port Lands area, the massive new Pinewood Toronto Studios have been built.

A fortified site along Eastern Avenue was the main Toronto base of the Hells Angels until it was raided by police and confiscated in 2007. Just to the southeast of the neighbourhood is the massive Ashbridges Bay Wastewater Treatment Plant, Canada&#x27;s largest.

==Political representation==
Leslieville is in the federal political riding of Toronto-Danforth, represented by Liberal MP Julie Dabrusin. Municipally, Leslieville is in Toronto Ward 14, represented by City Councillor Paula Fletcher. The seat in the Ontario provincial parliament is currently held by New Democrat Peter Tabuns, elected in the March 30, 2006 by-election and then re-elected in the 2007 general election.

Federally, the riding was represented by New Democrats from 1965 until 1988; past MPs include Bob Rae (1978-1982), who resigned to become leader of the provincial NDP, and was later Premier of Ontario in the NDP majority government of 1990-1995. In the 1988 federal election, the seat was won by Liberal Dennis Mills. Mills held the riding until Jack Layton of the New Democratic Party regained the seat in the 2004 Canadian federal election.

The provincial seat was previously held by Marilyn Churley, then deputy leader of the New Democratic Party of Ontario, until she resigned prior to an unsuccessful bid for the adjacent federal seat of Beaches-East York in the January 2006 federal election. Provincially, the riding has elected a New Democrat in every election and by-election since 1963.

<text>The western kingbird (Tyrannus verticalis) is a large tyrant flycatcher found throughout western environments of North America, as far south as Mexico.
==Description==
Adults are a combination of both gray and yellow plumage, along with crimson feathers that are hidden until courtship or against intruders. Characteristic of kingbird species, the western kingbird is very territorial. Although the western is often misidentified as Cassin&#x27;s kingbird, Couch&#x27;s kingbird, or the tropical kingbird due to the yellow coloration, it can be distinguished from these other species through its black, squared tail with white edges.

== Anatomy and morphology ==
== Distribution and habitat ==

The breeding habitat is open areas in western North America. The increased presence of trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated the range expansion of the western kingbird, as well as range expansions of many other species of birds.

== Behavior ==
The name &quot;kingbird&quot; is derived from their &quot;take-charge&quot; behavior. These birds aggressively defend their territory, even against much larger birds such as hawks. They will attack humans, livestock, and pets when they think their young are in danger. Kingbirds make a sturdy cup nest in a tree or shrub, sometimes on top of a pole or other man-made structure. Three to five white, creamy, or pinkish eggs with heavy blotches of brown, black, or lavender are laid and incubated for 12 to 14 days. Due to the small size of the nest, and the chicks&#x27; rapid rate of growth, most of them are pushed out of the nest, due to overcrowding, before they are fully feathered and able to fly. 

They wait on an open perch and fly out to catch insects such as bees, robber flies, winged ants, grasshoppers, and spiders. They are also known to eat berries, buckthorn/sumac, and poison ivy seeds.

These birds migrate in flocks to Florida and the Pacific coast of southern Mexico and Central America.

== Sound ==
The song is a squeaky chatter, sometimes compared to a squeaky toy. The call is a sharp loud &quot;whit&quot;. It occasionally sings before sunrise.

<doc id="412023" wikidata="Q298443" url="?curid=412023" title="Rahm Emanuel">
<text>Rahm Israel Emanuel (; born November 29, 1959) is an American politician and diplomat who most recently served as United States ambassador to Japan from 2022 to 2025. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented Illinois in the United States House of Representatives for three terms from 2003 to 2009. He was the White House Chief of Staff from 2009 to 2010 under President Barack Obama and served as mayor of Chicago from 2011 to 2019.

Born in Chicago, Emanuel is a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College and Northwestern University. Early in his career, Emanuel served as director of the finance committee for Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1992 presidential campaign. In 1993, he joined the Clinton administration, where he served as assistant to the president for political affairs and as Senior Advisor to the President for policy and strategy. Emanuel worked at the investment bank Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. from 1998 for two-and-a-half years, and served on the board of directors of Freddie Mac. In 2002, he ran for the seat in the U.S. House of Representatives vacated by Rod Blagojevich, who resigned to become governor of Illinois. Emanuel won the first of three terms representing Illinois&#x27;s 5th congressional district, a seat he held from 2003 to 2009. As chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, he oversaw Democratic wins in the 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, allowing the party to gain control of the chamber for the first time since 1994.

After the 2008 U.S. presidential election, President Barack Obama appointed Emanuel to serve as White House chief of staff. In October 2010, Emanuel resigned as chief of staff to run in the 2011 Chicago mayoral election. Emanuel won with 55% of the vote over five other candidates in the non-partisan mayoral election. In the 2015 Chicago mayoral election, he failed to obtain an absolute majority in the first round but defeated Cook County board commissioner Jesús &quot;Chuy&quot; García in the subsequent run-off election. In late 2015, Emanuel&#x27;s approval rating plunged to &quot;the low 20s&quot;, in response to a series of scandals.

In October 2017, Emanuel announced he planned to run for a third term, but reversed his decision on September 4, 2018. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; assessed Emanuel&#x27;s performance as mayor as &quot;mixed&quot;, and at one point half of Chicagoans favored Emanuel&#x27;s resignation. He left office in May 2019 and was succeeded by Lori Lightfoot. In August 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Emanuel to be the United States Ambassador to Japan; he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in December of that year. Emanuel departed his job in Japan upon the conclusion of the Biden administration in January 2025.

==Early life and family==

Emanuel&#x27;s father, Benjamin M. Emanuel, was born in Jerusalem, where he was a member of the Irgun paramilitary organization. He moved to the United States to work as a pediatrician at Michael Reese Hospital.

The surname &quot;Emanuel&quot; (Hebrew: ), which means &quot;God is with us&quot;, was adopted by their family in memory of Rahm&#x27;s uncle (his father&#x27;s brother) Emanuel Auerbach, who was killed in 1933 by Arabs in Jerusalem.

Emanuel&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a Moldovan Jew who emigrated from Bessarabia. His mother, Marsha (née Smulevitz), is the daughter of a West Side Chicago labor union organizer who worked in the civil rights movement. She briefly owned a local rock and roll club, and later became an adherent of Benjamin Spock&#x27;s writings.

Emanuel&#x27;s parents met during the 1950s in Chicago. Emanuel was born on November 29, 1959, in Chicago, Illinois. His first name, &quot;Rahm&quot; () means &quot;high&quot; or &quot;lofty&quot; in Hebrew. He attended Bernard Zell Anshe Emet Day School in Lakeview for elementary school. He has been described by his older brother Ezekiel, an oncologist and bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, as &quot;quiet and observant&quot; as a child. Ari, his younger brother, is the CEO of Endeavor, an entertainment agency with headquarters in Beverly Hills, California. Rahm Emanuel also has a younger adopted sister, Shoshana.

==Education and ballet dance==
While he lived in Chicago, Emanuel attended the Bernard Zell Anshe Emet Day School. After his family moved to Wilmette, north of the city, Emanuel attended public schools: Romona School, Locust Junior High School, and New Trier High School. He and his brothers attended summer camp in Israel, including the summer following the June 1967 Six-Day War. Ezekiel has written that their father &quot;did not believe in falsely building his sons&#x27; self-esteem by purposefully letting us win, or tolerating sloppy play&quot;. About Rahm, he also wrote:

Rahm was encouraged by his mother to take ballet lessons, and is a graduate of the Evanston School of Ballet, as well as a student of The Joel Hall Dance Center, where his children later took lessons. He won a scholarship to the Joffrey Ballet, but turned it down to attend Sarah Lawrence College, a liberal arts school with a strong dance program. This background, as well as the Ambassador’s short stature, led some critics to nickname him &quot;tiny dancer&quot;. While an undergraduate, Emanuel was elected to the Sarah Lawrence Student Senate. He graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts, and went on to receive a Master of Arts in Speech and Communication from Northwestern University in 1985.

Emanuel took part in a two-week civilian volunteer holiday, known as the Sar-El, where, as a civilian volunteer, he assisted the Israel Defense Forces during the 1991 Gulf War, helping to repair truck brakes in one of Israel&#x27;s northern bases.

While a high school student working part-time at an Arby&#x27;s restaurant, Emanuel severely cut his right middle finger on a meat slicer, which was later infected from swimming in Lake Michigan. His finger was partially amputated due to the severity of the infection.

==Political staffer career==
Emanuel began his political career with the public interest and consumer rights organization Illinois Public Action. He went on to serve in a number of capacities in local and national politics, initially specializing in fund-raising for Illinois campaigns, and then nationally.

Emanuel worked for Democrat Paul Simon&#x27;s 1984 election to the U.S. Senate. He also worked as the national campaign director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 1988, and was senior advisor and chief fund-raiser for Richard M. Daley&#x27;s successful initial campaign for mayor of Chicago, in 1989. He subsequently worked for Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan, conducting opposition research for his 1990 gubernatorial campaign.

At the start of then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidential primary campaign, Emanuel was appointed to direct the campaign&#x27;s finance committee. Emanuel insisted that Clinton schedule time for fund-raising and delay campaigning in New Hampshire. Clinton embarked on an aggressive national fund-raising campaign that allowed the campaign to keep buying television time as attacks on Clinton&#x27;s character threatened to swamp the campaign during the New Hampshire primary. Clinton&#x27;s primary rival, Paul Tsongas (the New Hampshire Democratic primary winner), later withdrew, citing a lack of campaign funds. Richard Mintz, a Washington public relations consultant who worked with Emanuel on the campaign, spoke about the soundness of the idea: &quot;It was that [extra] million dollars that really allowed the campaign to withstand the storm we had to ride out in New Hampshire [over Clinton&#x27;s relationship with Gennifer Flowers and the controversy over his draft status during the Vietnam War].&quot; Emanuel&#x27;s knowledge of the top donors in the country, and his rapport with &quot;heavily Jewish&quot; donors helped Clinton amass a then-unheard-of sum of $72 million. While working on the Clinton campaign, Emanuel was paid a retainer by the investment bank Goldman Sachs.

== Clinton administration ==

Following the campaign, Emanuel served as a senior advisor to Clinton at the White House from 1993 to 1998. In the White House, Emanuel was initially Assistant to the President for Political Affairs and then Senior Advisor to the President for Policy and Strategy. He was a leading strategist in White House efforts to institute NAFTA, among other Clinton initiatives.

Emanuel is known for his &quot;take-no-prisoners style&quot; that has earned him the nickname &quot;Rahmbo&quot;. Emanuel sent a dead fish in a box to a pollster who was late delivering polling results. On the night after the 1992 election, angry at Democrats and Republicans who &quot;betrayed&quot; them in the 1992 election, Emanuel stood up at a celebratory dinner with colleagues from the campaign and began plunging a steak knife into the table and began rattling off names while shouting &quot;Dead! Dead! Dead!&quot;. Before Tony Blair gave a pro-Clinton speech during the impeachment crisis, Emanuel reportedly screamed at Blair &quot;Don&#x27;t fuck this up!&quot; while Clinton was present. Blair and Clinton both burst into laughter. However, by 2007 friends of Emanuel were saying that he has &quot;mellowed out&quot;. Stories of his personal style have entered the popular culture, inspiring articles and websites that chronicle these and other quotes and incidents. The character Josh Lyman in &quot;The West Wing&quot; was said to be based on Emanuel, though executive producer Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell denied this.

==Career in finance==
After serving as an advisor to Bill Clinton, in 1998 Emanuel resigned from his position in the administration and joined the investment banking firm Wasserstein Perella, where he worked for years. Although he did not have an MBA degree or prior banking experience, he became a managing director at the firm&#x27;s Chicago office in 1999, and according to congressional disclosures, made $16.2 million in his years as a banker. At Wasserstein Perella, he worked on eight deals, including the acquisition by Commonwealth Edison of Peco Energy and the purchase by GTCR Golder Rauner of the SecurityLink home security unit from SBC Communications.

===Freddie Mac===
In 2000, Emanuel was named to the Board of Directors of Freddie Mac by President Clinton. He earned at least $320,000 during his time there, including later stock sales. During Emanuel&#x27;s time on the board, Freddie Mac was plagued with scandals involving campaign contributions and accounting irregularities. The Bush administration rejected a request under the Freedom of Information Act to review Freddie Mac board minutes and correspondence during Emanuel&#x27;s time as a director. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight later accused the board of having &quot;failed in its duty to follow up on matters brought to its attention&quot;. Emanuel resigned from the board in 2001 before his first bid for Congress.

During this time he served on the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority.

==Congressional career==
===Elections===
In 2002, Emanuel pursued the U.S. House seat in the 5th district of Illinois, previously held by Rod Blagojevich, who successfully ran for governor of Illinois. His strongest opponent in the crowded primary of eight was former Illinois state representative Nancy Kaszak. During the primary, Edward Moskal, president of the Polish American Congress, a political action committee endorsing Kaszak, called Emanuel a &quot;millionaire carpetbagger&quot;. Emanuel won the primary and defeated Republican candidate Mark Augusti in the general election. Emanuel&#x27;s inaugural election to the House with 67% was the closest he ever had for this seat, as he subsequently won more than 70% in all of his re-election bids.

===Tenure===

Emanuel was elected after the October 2002 joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War, and so did not vote on it. However, in the lead up to the resolution, Emanuel spoke out in support of the war.

In January 2003, Emanuel was named to the House Financial Services Committee and sat on the subcommittee that oversaw Freddie Mac. A few months later, Freddie Mac Chief Executive Officer Leland Brendsel was forced out and the committee and subcommittee commenced more than a year of hearings into Freddie Mac. Emanuel skipped every hearing allegedly for reasons of avoiding any appearance of favoritism, impropriety, or conflict of interest.

Emanuel aligned himself with the Democratic Leadership Council.

===Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman===
Emanuel assumed the position of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman (DCCC) after the death of the previous chair, Bob Matsui. Emanuel led the Democratic Party&#x27;s effort to capture the majority in the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections. The documentary &quot;HouseQuake&quot;, featuring Emanuel, chronicles those elections. Emanuel had disagreements over Democratic election strategy with Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean. Dean favored a &quot;fifty-state strategy&quot;, building support for the Democratic Party over the long term, while Emanuel advocated a more tactical approach focusing attention on key districts.
The Democratic Party gained 30 seats in the House in the 2006 elections, and Emanuel received considerable praise for his stewardship of the DCCC, even from Illinois Republican Rep. Ray LaHood, who said, &quot;He legitimately can be called the golden boy of the Democratic Party today. He recruited the right candidates, found the money, and funded them, and provided issues for them. Rahm did what no one else could do in seven cycles.&quot;

However, Emanuel also faced some criticism for his failure to support some progressive candidates, as Howard Dean advocated. Emanuel had &quot;aggressively recruited right-leaning candidates, frequently military veterans, including former Republicans&quot;. Many of the Representatives that Rahm had recruited, such as Heath Shuler, ended up &quot;[voting] against important Obama administration priorities, like economic stimulus, banking reform, and health care&quot;. Progressive activist Howie Klein has suggested that Emanuel&#x27;s congressional campaign strategy was short-sighted, as it &quot;contributed to the massive G.O.P. majorities we have now, the biggest since the nineteen-twenties&quot; when the Democrats lost control of the House in the 2010 mid-term elections.

After Emanuel&#x27;s election as chairman of the Democratic Caucus (see below), Chris Van Hollen became committee chair for the 110th Congress.

===Democratic Caucus chairman===
After his role in helping the Democrats win the 2006 elections, Emanuel was believed to be a leading candidate for the position of Majority Whip. Nancy Pelosi, who became the next Speaker of the House of Representatives, persuaded him not to challenge Jim Clyburn, but instead to succeed Clyburn in the role of Democratic Caucus Chairman. In return, Pelosi agreed to assign the caucus chair more responsibilities, including &quot;aspects of strategy and messaging, incumbent retention, policy development, and rapid-response communications&quot;. Caucus vice-chair John Larson remained in his role instead of running for the chairman position.

After Vice President Dick Cheney asserted that he did not fall within the bounds of orders set for the executive branch, Emanuel called for cutting off the $4.8 million the Executive Branch provides for the Vice President&#x27;s office.

===Positions on political issues===

;Social issues
Emanuel is generally liberal on social issues. He has maintained a 100-percent pro-choice voting record, supports LGBT rights including same-sex marriage, and is a strong supporter of gun control, rated &quot;F&quot; by the NRA in December 2003. He has also strongly supported the banning of numerous rifles based upon &quot;sporting purposes&quot; criteria.

During his original 2002 campaign, Emanuel spoke in support of the goal of &quot;to help make health care affordable and available for all Americans&quot;.

In his 2006 book, co-authored with Bruce Reed, &quot;The Plan: Big Ideas for America&quot;, Emanuel advocated a three-month compulsory universal service program for Americans between the ages of 18 and 25. A similar, expanded version of the initiative was later proposed by Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.

;Iraq war
During his original 2002 campaign, Emanuel &quot;indicated his support of President Bush&#x27;s position on Iraq, but said he believed the President needed to better articulate his position to the American people&quot;.

In the 2006 congressional primaries, Emanuel, then head of the Democratic congressional campaign committee, helped organize a run by Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran with no political experience, against grassroots candidate Christine Cegelis in Illinois&#x27; 6th district. Expedited withdrawal from Iraq was a central point of Cegelis&#x27; campaign and Duckworth opposed a withdrawal timetable.

;Middle East
In June 2007, Emanuel condemned an outbreak of Palestinian violence in the Gaza Strip and criticized Arab countries for not applying the same kind of pressure on the Palestinians as they have on Israel. At a 2003 pro-Israel rally in Chicago, Emanuel told the marchers that Israel was &quot;ready for peace&quot; but would not get there until Palestinians &quot;turn away from the path of terror&quot;.

==White House Chief of Staff==
Emanuel declared in April 2006 that he would support Hillary Clinton should she pursue the presidency in 2008. Emanuel remained close to Clinton since leaving the White House, talking strategy with her at least once a month as chairman of the DCCC. However, Emanuel&#x27;s loyalties came into conflict when his home-state Senator, Barack Obama, expressed interest in the race. Asked in January 2007, about his stance on the Democratic presidential nomination, he said: &quot;I&#x27;m hiding under the desk. I&#x27;m very far under the desk, and I&#x27;m bringing my paper and my phone.&quot; Emanuel remained neutral in the race until June 4, 2008, the day after the final primary contests, when he endorsed Obama.


On November 6, 2008, Emanuel accepted the position of White House Chief of Staff for US President Barack Obama. He resigned his congressional seat effective January 2, 2009. A special primary to fill his vacated congressional seat was held on March 3, 2009, and the special general election on April 7. John Fritchey, a candidate for that seat, said at a forum that Emanuel had told him he may be interested in running for the seat again in the future.

Some Republican leaders criticized Emanuel&#x27;s appointment because they believed it went against Obama&#x27;s campaign promises of less divisive politics, given Emanuel&#x27;s reputation as a partisan Democrat. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham disagreed, saying: &quot;This is a wise choice by President-elect Obama. He&#x27;s tough, but fair, honest, direct, and candid.&quot; Ira Forman, executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council, said that the choice indicated that Obama would not listen to the &quot;wrong people&quot; regarding the U.S.–Israel relationship. Some commentators opined that Emanuel would be good for the Israeli–Palestinian peace process because if Israeli leaders made excuses for not dismantling settlements, Emanuel would be tough and pressure the Israelis to comply. Some Palestinians expressed dismay at Emanuel&#x27;s appointment.

Weeks after accepting the appointment, Emanuel participated on a panel of corporate chief executive officers sponsored by the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, and said, &quot;You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.&quot; Emanuel explained later, &quot;... what I said was, never allow a good crisis to go to waste when it&#x27;s an opportunity to do things that you had never considered, or that you didn&#x27;t think were possible.&quot;

In a 2009 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Emanuel was characterized as being &quot;perhaps the most influential chief of staff of a generation&quot;.

He has a reputation for his no-holds-barred negotiation style that involves &quot;his share of shouting and cursing&quot;. Ezekiel Emanuel has written, &quot;The impatient, pushy Emanuel style is so well known that during a recent job interview I was asked, point-blank, whether I had the level-headed temperament the position required. ... . [A]s obvious as our flaws are to others, it&#x27;s difficult to recognize them in ourselves.&quot; At a January 2010 closed-door meeting in the White House with liberal activists, Emanuel called them &quot;fucking retarded&quot; for planning to run TV ads attacking conservative Democrats who didn&#x27;t support Obama&#x27;s health-care overhaul. After the remarks were quoted in a front-page story of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, and after he was criticized by Sarah Palin, Emanuel apologized to organizations for mentally disabled people for using the word &quot;retarded&quot;.

According to Jonathan Alter&#x27;s book, &quot;The Promise&quot;, Emanuel opposed Barack Obama&#x27;s plan for a broad health care reform, but Obama overrode him. Emanuel advocated a smaller plan because it could get bi-partisan support. Emanuel wanted to expand coverage for children, and increase the number of single mothers eligible for Medicaid. For that reason, it was dubbed &quot;the Titanic plan&quot;, a reference to the priority given to saving women and children during the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. Reportedly, House Speaker Pelosi had to convince Obama on the health care initiative after Emanuel dramatically scaled it back. Emanuel has since apologized for his role, saying, &quot;Thank God for the country, he didn&#x27;t listen to me&quot;, after the Supreme Court upheld &quot;ObamaCare&quot; in 2012.

As chief of staff, Emanuel would make his staff laugh. During a staff meeting, when Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra gave uniformly upbeat reports, Emanuel is said to have looked at him and said: &quot;Whatever you&#x27;re taking, I want some.&quot; Emanuel had a hand in war strategy, political maneuvering, communications and economic policy. Bob Woodward wrote in &quot;Obama&#x27;s Wars&quot; that Emanuel made a habit of telephoning CIA Director Leon Panetta and asking about the lethal drone strikes aimed at Al Qaeda, asking, &quot;Who did we get today?&quot;.

In 2010, Emanuel was reported to have conflicts with other senior members of the president&#x27;s team and ideological clashes over policy. He was also the focal point of criticism from left-leaning Democrats for the administration&#x27;s perceived move to the center. By September 2010, with the Democrats anticipating heavy losses in mid-term elections, this was said to precipitate Emanuel&#x27;s departure as chief of staff.

==Mayor of Chicago==
===Elections===
====2011====
On September 30, 2010, it was announced that Emanuel would leave his post as White House Chief of Staff to run for Mayor of Chicago. He was replaced by Pete Rouse on October 2, 2010.

Emanuel entered the race with high-name recognition, having not only a sizable local profile, but also a sizable national profile.

Emanuel&#x27;s eligibility for office was challenged on the basis of his lack of residency in Chicago for one year prior to the election. This was the period when Emanuel was in Washington serving as the White House chief of staff. The Board of Elections and the Cook County Circuit Court affirmed his eligibility. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, holding on January 24, 2011, that residency for purposes of a candidate is different from residency for purposes of being a voter. A further appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of Appeals and affirming Emanuel&#x27;s eligibility.

In the race, Emanuel had a financial advantage over the other candidates. He was by far the best-financed candidate, with more than three times the campaign funds as the second-best financed candidate (Gery Chico), and more than twenty-times the third-best financed candidate (Carol Moseley Braun). Emanuel&#x27;s had his financial advantage from the very start of his candidacy, as he began his campaign with approximately $1.2 million from his congressional campaign fund. By December 31, 2010, he had raised more than $10.5 million in additional funds. On January 1, 2011, the Illinois Campaign Disclosure Act took effect, limiting individual personal contributions to candidates to $5,000. Nevertheless, he continued to raise substantial funds, ultimately having procured a total $15 million over the course of his campaign (including those funds transferred from his congressional campaign committee). Emanuel was able to raise so much because he had experience fundraising, had built a Washington connections and a national profile, and his brother Ari had Hollywood connections. He had 75 contributors give more than $50,000, twenty-five of which were from out of state. Among these high-dollar contributors were Steven Spielberg, Donald Trump, and Steve Jobs. Despite having a national fundraising operation, three-quarters of his donations came locally. More than $800,000 of his contributions were from financial exchange and trading executives, with his largest single donation being a $200,000 donation from executives of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Emanuel proposed lowering the city&#x27;s sales tax and raising the service tax. Emanuel supported negotiating with the Chicago Teachers Union for longer school days and school years. Emanuel opposed instituting an elected school board. This received criticism from other candidates.

Other candidates assailed his tenure at Freddie Mac.

As the frontrunner, Emanuel had gotten more press coverage than other mayoral candidates. This was furthered by the fact that the challenge to his residency became a dominant headline.

Emanuel entered the race with solid backing from North and Northwest Side Democratic Ward Committeemen.

Emanuel&#x27;s advertisements showed portrayed him as having strong roots in the city, and, in telling his biography, emphasized his upbringing on the North Shore. Contrarily, Emanuel&#x27;s opponents attempted to characterize him as a carpetbagger, hailing not from the city itself but rather from the North Shore and Washington, D.C. Emanuel&#x27;s advertisements also sought to emphasize his tenures in working in the White House and his tenure as a congressman. Emanuel would highlight his relations with presidents Clinton and Obama. He also sought to highlight the fact that he had forged connections in Washington during his time in congress, and also had strong business ties.

Emanuel had overwhelming support from Jewish and LGBT voters. Emanuel held a lead with independent progressives, including strong support from the lakefront liberals voting bloc of wealthy white progressives from the city&#x27;s northern lakefront. As the only white candidate in the race, Emanuel was seen as likely to receive unified support from a majority of the white electorate. Since the Hispanic vote was largely split between two Hispanic candidates (Gery Chico and Miguel del Valle), once Emanuel was able to secure the support of the majority of the black vote, he had secured himself victory.

In attracting African American voters to his candidacy, Emanuel was helped by his associations with Presidents Clinton and Obama, both of whom were extremely popular among the African American community. After Moseley Braun&#x27;s support began to crater following a character attack on fellow candidate Patricia Van Pelt Watkins which backfired, Emanuel was the beneficiary as the, largely African American, voters that abandoned their support of Moseley Braun&#x27;s candidacy primarily migrated to support his candidacy. Once this happened, Emanuel had all but secured himself a first-place finish, and the remaining candidates were left to jockey for second-place in hopes of there being a runoff.

Emanuel carried the endorsements of both the city&#x27;s major daily newspapers, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;.

Emanuel&#x27;s mayoral campaign was the inspiration for a satirical Twitter account called MayorEmanuel, which received more than 43,000 followers, more popular than Emanuel&#x27;s actual Twitter account. Emanuel announced on February 28 that if the author would reveal himself, he would donate $5,000 to the charity of the author&#x27;s choice. When Chicago journalist Dan Sinker revealed himself, Emanuel donated the money to Young Chicago Authors, a community organization which helps young people with writing and publishing skills.
Emanuel was elected on February 22, 2011, with 55% of the vote, and was sworn in as the 55th Mayor of Chicago on May 16, 2011, at the Pritzker Pavilion. At his inauguration were outgoing Mayor Richard M. Daley, Vice President Joe Biden, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, former Mayor Jane Byrne, and William M. Daley, brother of the outgoing mayor and who would later serve as White House Chief of Staff. Emanuel was Chicago&#x27;s first Jewish mayor.

====2015====

In August 2014, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; poll reported Emanuel had a 35% approval rating as mayor of Chicago.

In 2015, Emanuel won 56 percent of the vote in the run-off election against Jesús &quot;Chuy&quot; García held on April 7, 2015. He had been hurt by sharp neighborhood criticism of his decision to shut down 50 public schools in black and Latino neighborhoods, and his installation of red light cameras, together with anger at the high level of gun violence on the streets. On the other hand, he was supported by the business community and most elements of the Democratic party.

====2016====
In February 2016, Chicago Tribune polls reported that Emanuel approval ratings had dropped to 27%, for his role as the Mayor of Chicago.

The Chicago Tribune stated that this all-time record low job approval confirms a &quot;public crisis in confidence&quot; for Emanuel who had been subjected to weeks of public protests, allegations of him covering up the Laquan McDonald police shooting video, as well as federal civil rights investigation of his police department. For several months, Emanuel claimed that making the video public would jeopardize a federal investigation into the shooting and had refused to allow the video to be shown to the public, even though the Justice Department had not raised any issues with the public release of the footage. It wasn&#x27;t until a judge forced its release that it was later seen that the contents in the video contradicted the police&#x27;s narrative of what had occurred. Public backlash resulted from Emanuel&#x27;s handling of the video, with a &quot;steady barrage&quot; of &quot;Resign Rahm&quot; protests since November&quot;.

According to Chicago Tribunal polls, the majority didn&#x27;t believe Emanuel to be honest nor trustworthy, and 83 percent of polled Chicagoans didn&#x27;t believe Emanuel&#x27;s statements on the video, and 68 percent felt that he was not justified in withholding the video from the public. In response to the public backlash, Emanuel forced the resignation of Chicago&#x27;s police chief, Garry McCarthy, as well as generating a plan that promised to reform the city&#x27;s police department.

====2019====

Emanuel announced in October 2017 that he was running for reelection in 2019, despite low approval ratings and some potentially serious challengers. In September 2018, Emanuel decided to not run for reelection. Close friend David Axelrod told &quot;USA Today&quot; that Emanuel had grown uncertain about his devotion to a third term. Emanuel had been leading in the polls prior to his decision to withdraw. However according to Politico citing data from Public Policy Polling, Rahm Emanuel had a lead over most of his potential challengers but it was &quot;not enough to win the contest outright&quot; and that in a head-to-head matchup with Paul Vallas, Vallas actually had a polling lead over Emanuel with 39 percent to 33. In an interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Emanuel stated that he had been conferring with his wife and children for months before announcing the decision and that he felt it was time to &quot;write the next chapter.&quot;

===Tenure===
Emanuel assembled a transition team from varied backgrounds. On November 16, the city council voted unanimously to adopt the mayor&#x27;s first budget, which decreased the budget by $34 million and increased spending by $46.2 million, supported by increasing fees and fines. Despite most Aldermen opposing cuts to library workers and the closure of mental health clinics, they ultimately supported it, calling it &quot;honest&quot;. At a news conference in November 2012, Emanuel listed his top three priorities for the state legislature as security and pension reform, adding a casino to Chicago, and equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. At a press conference with then Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, who previously vetoed legislation to put a casino in Chicago, the two were &quot;very close&quot; to reaching a deal.

In April 2018, Emanuel received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from NUI Galway, a university in Chicago&#x27;s sister city of Galway, Ireland, with the conferrers citing achievements in education reform while Mayor.

====Aldermanic appointments====
As mayor, Emanuel appointed several individuals to fill vacancies on the Chicago City Council. This included appointing Natashia Holmes as 7th Ward alderman in 2013, Deb Mell as 33rd Ward alderman in 2013, Sophia King as 4th ward alderman in 2016, and Silvana Tabares as 23rd Ward alderman in 2018.

Following the resignation of Willie Cochran in March 2019, Emanuel had the opportunity to make a final aldermanic appointment, appointing an interim alderman to hold the seat until his successor (to be elected in an April 2 runoff) would assume office on May 20. However, Emanuel did not make such an appointment, leaving the seat vacant until March 20.

====Police and community relations====
In August 2012, a federal lawsuit was filed by eleven Chicago police officers alleging they were removed from the mayoral security detail and replaced with officers who worked on Emanuel&#x27;s mayoral campaign, in violation of the 1983 Shakman Decree, which bars city officials from making political considerations in the hiring process.

Rahm Emanuel faced a great deal of criticism for his handling of the October 20, 2014, police murder of Laquan McDonald. The dash-cam video of the shooting was initially withheld, and only was released after a judge ordered it on November 24, 2015. After the video release, Emanuel was condemned for covering up the incident and allowing Chicago police to use excessive force against minorities. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist John Kass wrote that the Emanuel administration withheld from the public the police dashboard camera video of the shooting in order to secure the reelection. Emanuel responded to criticism of the shooting and how it was handled by firing police Superintendent Garry McCarthy. In early December, the federal Justice Department announced an investigation into the Chicago Police Department, a move which Emanuel initially called &quot;misguided&quot;. Illinois state legislator La Shawn Ford also introduced a bill to recall the mayor (an effort most pundits claim was more symbolic than practical).

Protests erupted soon after the release of the video, and on Black Friday protesters shut down part of the city&#x27;s Magnificent Mile. Public calls for resignation grew steadily over this period, including a well-circulated op-ed published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. By early December, Emanuel&#x27;s approval rating had sunk to 18%, with 67% of Chicagoans disapproving of his job performance, and slightly more than half of those polled calling for his resignation. During the week of December 10, protestors blocked streets and continued to call for Emanuel to resign. Additional protests against Emanuel and Chicago&#x27;s Police Department were held on the city&#x27;s busy Michigan Avenue shopping area on December 24, 2015.

On December 26, 2015, a police officer killed two people in another shooting, including a woman whom the officer had shot by mistake. On December 28, Emanuel announced that he was cutting short his vacation in Cuba to deal with the crisis. Emanuel announced several changes to the Chicago police department on December 30, including doubling the number of Tasers issued to officers. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, the Emanuel administration released e-mails revealing they had sought to coordinate with independent agencies such as the Independent Police Review Authority regarding public relations after the shooting. The same day &quot;The New Yorker&quot; added to the wave of negative media attention surrounding the mayor by publishing &quot;The Sudden But Well-Deserved Fall of Rahm Emanuel&quot;, an article critically reevaluating Emanuel&#x27;s legacy as a political operative since the early 1990s.

====Public education====
In 2012, during the contract negotiations between the city and the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), compromise could not be reached over issues like health insurance increases, teacher evaluations, and seniority pay increases. On August 8, 2012, the CTU voted 90% to authorize a strike. On September 10, the CTU began a strike after CTU President Lewis declared that negotiations with the city were not succeeding. On September 14, the CTU reached a tentative agreement with the city which included preferences for teachers who have been laid off due to a school closing to be hired in another school and student test scores having less of a role in teacher evaluations than the city had originally planned. This tentative agreement did not hold, and the strike continued, after which Emanuel announced his intention to seek a legal injunction, forcing teachers back to work. On September 17, Emanuel&#x27;s efforts to end the strike stalled as the walkout went into the second week. Delegates from the CTU voted to end the strike on September 18, 2012, and students began their return to the schools the following day.

On September 17, 2013, Emanuel&#x27;s appointed Chicago Board of Education announced the closing of 50 Chicago public schools, 49 elementary schools and a high school — the largest school closure in Chicago history.

The trends in dropout and graduation rates have shown considerable improvement in the last five years, but researchers point out the alternative school performance does not follow the general trend.

====Public health====
On August 16, 2011, Emanuel unveiled &quot;Healthy Chicago&quot;, the city&#x27;s first public health blueprint with Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Bechara Choucair. Emanuel initiated the consolidation of City Council committees from 19 to 16 in a cost control effort. On October 30, 2012, Emanuel voiced his support for the demolition of the abandoned Prentice Women&#x27;s Hospital Building, in order for Northwestern University, which owns the property, to build a new facility. Preservationists supported historical landmark status. Days later, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks voted that the building met landmark status criteria then reversed their decision later in the same meeting. On November 15, a judge granted a temporary stay of the decision in order for a lawsuit filed by preservation coalitions against the landmark commission to be heard.

==== Lack of transparency ====
During Emanuel&#x27;s time as mayor of Chicago, two of Emanuel&#x27;s appointees, Barbara Byrd-Bennett and Amer Ahmad, were convicted of corruption charges. A third appointee, Forrest Claypool, resigned after the inspector general accused him of a cover up. Emanuel received backlash for defending him against the accusations.

Emanuel rejected requests under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act from &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; for various communication and information logs for himself and his staff as &quot;unduly burdensome&quot;. After a second request by the &quot;Tribune&quot;, they were informed that 90 percent of the emails had been deleted by Emanuel and his top aides. As a result, Emanuel came under fire for going against his campaign promise to create &quot;the most open, accountable, and transparent government that the City of Chicago has ever seen&quot;.

Emanuel and his office were found guilty of breaking state law by withholding government emails by transferring them onto his personal phone.

In March 2017 Chicago Tribune reported Emanuel released 2,696 emails he had previously withheld. In the emails there were found to be 26 possible violations of lobbying laws. On at least 26 occasions lobbyists, corporate executives, donors, and friends of Emanuel got access to Emanuel or other city officials without registering as a lobbyist or reporting their contact to the ethics board.

====Tax-exempt status of Lollapalooza====
Lollapalooza, a local summer music festival in Grant Park, was exempt from taxation. Emanuel&#x27;s brother Ari is the co-CEO of William Morris Endeavor, which co-owns the event. In 2011 Rahm Emanuel asked the City Council to appoint an independent third party negotiator, to avoid having the negotiation seen as biased. Although the deal was reached before Emanuel took office, tax breaks must be negotiated every year. It was later revealed that the festival received its tax exemption for 2011 in the final days of the Daley administration. In 2012, Lollapalooza paid taxes for the first time in seven years and extended its contract to host in Grant Park through 2021.

====Hyperloop====
Rahm Emanuel announced preliminary plans to award Elon Musk a contract to build a Hyperloop between downtown Chicago and the city&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport, although it would receive no public subsidies under this plan. However, some criticized the fact that Elon Musk has in the past donated more than $55,000 to Rahm Emanuel&#x27;s various election campaigns, suggesting a potential conflict of interest between the two.

====Immigration====
Chicago became a &quot;de jure&quot; sanctuary city in 2012 when Rahm Emanuel and the City Council passed the Welcoming City Ordinance.

===Approval ratings===


===End of tenure===
Emanuel planned to arrange for a smooth transition between his mayoral administration and that of his elected successor Lori Lightfoot. Reports were that he intended to model the transition between their administrations upon the U.S. presidential transition between the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. Emanuel had been part of that transition as Obama&#x27;s Chief of Staff designate.

== Post-mayoral career ==


Hours after Emanuel left office, the magazine &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, where he had written a dozen essays in prior months, made him a contributing editor; however, this honorary title was withdrawn after black staff members objected. In May 2019, he was named founding executive chair of the National BAM Advisory Council of the Becoming A Man youth program. In June 2019, Emanuel joined Centerview Partners as a senior counselor. Since July 2019, Emanuel has also served as a political analyst for ABC News.

=== Potential Cabinet position in Biden administration ===
Progressive politicians nationally, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Matt Martin, opposed his potential inclusion in Joe Biden&#x27;s Cabinet, citing his handling of the murder of Laquan McDonald. Initially, Emanuel was considered for Transportation secretary in the Biden administration.

===United States Ambassador to Japan===
It was reported in February 2021 that Emanuel was being considered by the Biden administration as an ambassador to either China or Japan. In April 2021 it was reported that Biden had chosen him as ambassador to Japan; Emanuel was formally nominated to serve as ambassador in August 2021. Hearings were held on Emanuel&#x27;s nomination in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on October 20, 2021. The committee favorably reported Emanuel&#x27;s nomination to the Senate floor on November 3, 2021. On December 18, 2021, United States Senate confirmed Emanuel&#x27;s nomination in a 48–21 vote; senators Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley and Elizabeth Warren were the only Democrats to vote against his confirmation. He presented his credentials to Japanese Emperor Naruhito on March 25, 2022.

Emanuel gained popularity with the Japanese public, in part by using the local rail transport system to get around Tokyo and across the country, frequently posting photographs of himself using the rail systems on Twitter. However, he drew criticism from some Japanese politicians with his public statements on gay and transgender rights, released while Japanese lawmakers debated an anti-discrimination bill. Masamune Wada, a Liberal Democratic member of the House of Councillors responded, saying Emanuel should keep out of domestic politics or risk expulsion.

In 2024, he became the first U.S. ambassador to visit Yonaguni. On August 7, 2024, it was announced that he would skip attending a memorial ceremony to the atomic bombing of Nagasaki because Israel was not invited to the ceremony.

=== Anti-Semitic vandalism ===
Emanuel&#x27;s Michigan residence was vandalized with the word &quot;Nazis&quot; spray-painted on its fence in late 2023. According to the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot;, Emanuel was not present at the residence during the incident. In the aftermath, Emanuel stated, &quot;Our family is very proud of how our friends, neighbors, and the community have rallied to our support and in a singular voice in condemning hatred and bigotry.&quot;

Emanuel also praised local law enforcement for their swift response to the vandalism. This event occurred in the aftermath of the Gaza war.

==Personal life==

Emanuel and his wife, Amy Merritt Rule, have a son and two daughters. As of 2011, their family lived in the Ravenswood neighborhood on Chicago&#x27;s north side. Rule converted to Judaism shortly before their wedding. Emanuel is a close friend of fellow Chicagoan David Axelrod, chief strategist for Obama&#x27;s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaign, and Axelrod signed the ketuba, the Jewish marriage contract, at Emanuel&#x27;s wedding. The Emanuels are members of the Chicago synagogue Anshe Sholom B&#x27;nai Israel. Rabbi Asher Lopatin of the congregation described Emanuel&#x27;s family as &quot;a very involved Jewish family&quot;, adding that &quot;Amy was one of the teachers for a class for children during the High Holidays two years ago&quot;. Emanuel has said of his Judaism: &quot;I am proud of my heritage and treasure the values it has taught me.&quot; Emanuel&#x27;s children attended the private University of Chicago Laboratory Schools in the Hyde Park neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago.

Each year during the winter holidays, Emanuel takes a family trip on which his children can be exposed to other cultures and parts of the world. Emanuel is a lifelong JoJo fan and attended her concert in Chicago in November of 2016. Prior family trips have been to Vietnam, India, Kenya, Zambia, and South America. His 2015 holiday trip was scheduled for the island of Cuba.

Emanuel trains for and participates in triathlons. In 2011, he scored 9th out of 80 competitors in his age group. A passionate cyclist, he rides a custom-built, state-of-the-art Parlee road bike.

<text>American poetry refers to the poetry of the United States. It arose first as efforts by American colonists to add their voices to English poetry in the 17th century, well before the constitutional unification of the Thirteen Colonies (although a strong oral tradition often likened to poetry already existed among Native American societies). Most of the early colonists&#x27; work was similar to contemporary English models of poetic form, diction, and theme. However, in the 19th century, an American idiom began to emerge. By the later part of that century, poets like Walt Whitman were winning an enthusiastic audience abroad and had joined the English-language &quot;avant-garde&quot;.

Much of the American poetry published between 1910 and 1945 remains lost in the pages of small circulation political periodicals, particularly the ones on the far left, destroyed by librarians during the 1950s McCarthy era. Modernist poets like Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot (who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948) are often cited as creative and influential English-language poets of the first half of the 20th century. African American and women poets were published and read widely in the same period but were often somewhat prejudicially marginalized. By the 1960s, the Beat Movement and Black Mountain poets had developed new models for poetry and their contemporaries influenced the British Poetry Revival. Towards the end of the millennium, consideration of American poetry had diversified, as scholars placed an increased emphasis on poetry by women, African Americans, Hispanics, Chicanos, Native Americans, and other ethnic groups. Louise Glück and Bob Dylan have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature

==Poetry in the colonies==

As England&#x27;s contact with the Americas increased after the 1490s, English explorers sometimes included verse with their descriptions of the New World up through 1650, the year of Anne Bradstreet&#x27;s &quot;The Tenth Muse&quot;, which was written in America (most likely in Ipswich, Massachusetts or North Andover, Massachusetts) and printed and distributed in London by her brother-in-law, Rev. John Woodbridge. There are 14 such writers whom might be termed American poets (they had been to America and to different degrees, written poems or verses about the place). Early examples include a 1616 &quot;testimonial poem&quot; on the &quot;sterling and warlike&quot; character of Captain John Smith (in Barbour, ed. &quot;Works&quot;) and Rev. William Morrell&#x27;s 1625 &quot;Nova Anglia&quot; or &quot;New England&quot;, which is a rhymed catalog of everything from American weather to his glimpses of Native American women. Then in May 1627, Thomas Morton of Merrymount – a Devon-born West Country outdoorsman, attorney at law, man of letters and colonial adventurer – raised a maypole to celebrate and foster success at his fur-trading settlement and nailed a &quot;Poem&quot; and &quot;Song&quot; (one a densely literary manifesto on how European and Native people came together there and must keep doing so for a successful America; the other a light &quot;drinking song&quot; also full of deeper American implications). These were published in book form along with other examples of Morton&#x27;s American poetry in &quot;New English Canaan&quot; (1637); and based on the criteria of &quot;First,&quot; &quot;American&quot; and &quot;Poetry,&quot; they make Morton (and not Anne Bradstreet) America&#x27;s first poet in English.
One of the first recorded poets of the Thirteen Colonies was Anne Bradstreet (1612 – 1672), who remains one of the early known women poets who wrote in English. The poems she published during her lifetime address religious and political themes. She also wrote tender evocations of home, family life and of her love for her husband, many of which remained unpublished until the 20th century.

Edward Taylor (1645–1729) wrote poems expounding Puritan virtues in a highly wrought metaphysical style that can be seen as typical of the early colonial period.

This narrow focus on the Puritan ethic was, understandably, the dominant note of most of the poetry written in the colonies during the 17th and early 18th centuries. The earliest &quot;secular&quot; poetry published in New England was by Samuel Danforth in his &quot;almanacks&quot; for 1647–1649, published at Cambridge; these included &quot;puzzle poems&quot; as well as poems on caterpillars, pigeons, earthquakes, and hurricanes. Of course, being a Puritan minister as well as a poet, Danforth never ventured far from a spiritual message.

A distinctly American lyric voice of the colonial period was Phillis Wheatley, a slave whose book &quot;Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral,&quot; was published in 1773. She was one of the best-known poets of her day, at least in the colonies, and her poems were typical of New England culture at the time, meditating on religious and classical ideas.

The 18th century saw an increasing emphasis on America as fit subject matter for its poets. This trend is most evident in the works of Philip Freneau (1752–1832), who is notable for the unusually sympathetic attitude to Native Americans shown in his writings, which had been interpreted as being reflective of his skepticism toward American culture. This late colonial-era poetry follows the means and methods of Pope and Gray in the era of Blake and Burns.. Rebecca Hammond Lard (1772–1855), has been described as &quot;the first poet in Indiana&quot;.

On the whole, the development of poetry in the American colonies mirrors the development of the colonies themselves. The early poetry is dominated by the need to preserve the integrity of the Puritan ideals that created the settlement in the first place. As the colonists grew in confidence, the poetry they wrote increasingly reflected their drive towards independence. This shift in subject matter was not reflected in the mode of writing which tended to be conservative, to say the least. This can be seen as a product of the physical remove at which American poets operated from the center of English-language poetic developments in London.

==Postcolonial poetry==
The first significant poet of the independent United States was William Cullen Bryant (1794–1878), whose great contribution was to write rhapsodic poems on the grandeur of prairies and forests. However, the first internationally acclaimed poet was Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807–1882) who nearly surpassed Alfred, Lord Tennyson in international popularity, and, alongside William Cullen Bryant, John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., formed the Fireside Poets (known as the Schoolroom or Household Poets). The Fireside Poets were a group of 19th-century American poets from New England. The name &quot;Fireside Poets&quot; is derived from that popularity: their general adherence to poetic convention (standard forms, regular meter, and rhymed stanzas) made their body of work particularly suitable for being memorized and recited in school and at home, where it was a source of entertainment for families gathered around the fire. The poets&#x27; primary subjects were the domestic life, mythology, and politics of the United States, in which several of the poets were directly involved.

Other notable poets to emerge in the early and middle 19th century include Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882), Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849), Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), Sidney Lanier (1842–1881), and James Whitcomb Riley (1849–1916). As might be expected, the works of all these writers are united by a common search for a distinctive American voice to distinguish them from their British counterparts. To this end, they explored the landscape and traditions of their native country as materials for their poetry.

The most significant example of this tendency may be &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; by Longfellow. This poem uses Native American tales collected by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, who was superintendent of Indian affairs for Michigan from 1836 to 1841. Longfellow imitated the meter of the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, possibly to avoid British models. The resulting poem, while a popular success, did not provide a model for future U.S. poets.

As time went on, the influence of the transcendentalism of the poet/philosophers Emerson and Thoreau increasingly influenced American poetry. Transcendentalism was the distinctly American strain of English Romanticism that began with William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Emerson, arguably one of the founders of transcendentalism, had visited England as a young man to meet these two English poets, as well as Thomas Carlyle. While Romanticism transitioned into Victorianism in post-reform England, it became energetic in America from the 1830s through to the Civil War.

Edgar Allan Poe was a unique poet during this time, brooding over themes of the macabre and dark, connecting his poetry and aesthetic vision to his philosophical, psychological, moral, and cosmological theories. In the 20th century, American poet William Carlos Williams said of Poe that &quot;in him American literature is anchored, in him alone, on solid ground.&quot;

==Whitman and Dickinson==

The final emergence of a truly indigenous English-language poetry in the United States was the work of two poets, Walt Whitman (1819–1892) and Emily Dickinson (1830–1886). On the surface, these two poets could not have been less alike. Whitman&#x27;s long lines, derived from the metric of the King James Version of the Bible, and his democratic inclusiveness stand in stark contrast with Dickinson&#x27;s concentrated phrases and short lines and stanzas, derived from Protestant hymnals.

What links them is their common connection to Emerson (a passage from whom Whitman printed on the second edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;), and the daring originality of their visions. These two poets can be said to represent the birth of two major American poetic idioms—the free metric and direct emotional expression of Whitman, and the gnomic obscurity and irony of Dickinson—both of which would profoundly stamp the American poetry of the 20th century.

The development of these idioms, as well as conservative reactions against them, can be traced through the works of poets such as Edwin Arlington Robinson (1869–1935), Stephen Crane (1871–1900), Robert Frost (1874–1963), Carl Sandburg (1878–1967), and Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892-1950). Frost, in particular, is a commanding figure, who aligned strict poetic meter, particularly blank verse and terser lyrical forms, with a &quot;vurry Amur&#x27;k&#x27;n&quot; (as Pound put it) idiom. He successfully revitalized a rural tradition with many English antecedents from his beloved Golden Treasury and produced an oeuvre of major importance, rivaling or even excelling in achievement that of the key modernists and making him, within the full sweep of traditional modern English-language verse, a peer of Hardy and Yeats. But from Whitman and Dickinson the outlines of a distinctively new organic poetic tradition, less indebted to English formalism than Frost&#x27;s work, were clear to see, and they would come to full fruition in the 1910s and 1920s. As Colin Falck noted, &quot;To the Whitmanian heritage of cadenced free verse she [Millay] brings the greater reflective tightness of Robinson Jeffers.&quot;

==Modernism and after==

This new idiom, combined with a study of 19th-century French poetry, formed the basis of American input into 20th-century English-language poetic modernism. 

Ezra Pound (1885–1972), H.D. (1886–1961), and Richard Aldington (1892–1962), conceived of Imagism in 1913, which Pound defined as poetry written with an economy of words. T.S. Eliot (1888–1965) was among the leading figures at the time. Pound rejected traditional poetic form and meter and of Victorian diction. He believed both steered American poetry toward greater density, difficulty, and opacity, with an emphasis on techniques such as fragmentation, ellipsis, allusion, juxtaposition, ironic and shifting personae, and mythic parallelism. Pound opened American poetry to diverse influences, including the traditional poetries of China and Japan. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922) is a major example of the transition into literary modernity.

Numerous other poets made important contributions at this revolutionary juncture, including Gertrude Stein (1874–1946), Amy Lowell (1874-1925), Wallace Stevens (1879–1955), William Carlos Williams (1883–1963), Hilda Doolittle (H.D.) (1886–1961), Marianne Moore (1887–1972), E.E. Cummings (1894–1962), and Hart Crane (1899–1932). The cerebral and skeptical Romantic Stevens helped revive the philosophical lyric, and Williams was to become exemplary for many later poets because he, more than any of his peers, contrived to marry spoken American English with free verse rhythms. Cummings remains notable for his experiments with typography and evocation of a spontaneous, childlike vision of reality.

Whereas these poets were unambiguously aligned with high modernism, other poets active in the United States in the first third of the 20th century were not. Among the more important of the latter were those who were associated with what came to be known as the New Criticism. These included John Crowe Ransom (1888–1974), Allen Tate (1899–1979), and Robert Penn Warren (1905–1989). Other poets of the era, such as Archibald MacLeish (1892–1982), experimented with modernist techniques but were drawn toward traditional modes of writing. Still others, such as Robinson Jeffers (1887–1962), adopted Modernist freedom while remaining aloof from Modernist factions and programs.

In addition, other early 20th-century poets maintained or were forced to maintain a peripheral relationship to high modernism, likely due to the racially charged themes of their work. They include Countee Cullen (1903–1946), Alice Dunbar Nelson (1875–1935), Gwendolyn Bennett (1902–1981), Langston Hughes (1902–1967), Claude McKay (1889–1948), Jean Toomer (1894–1967), and other African American poets of the Harlem Renaissance.

The modernist torch was carried in the 1930s mainly by the group of poets known as the Objectivists. These included Louis Zukofsky (1904–1978), Charles Reznikoff (1894–1976), George Oppen (1908–1984), Carl Rakosi (1903–2004) and, later, Lorine Niedecker (1903–1970). Kenneth Rexroth, who was published in the &quot;Objectivist Anthology&quot;, was, along with Madeline Gleason (1909–1973), a forerunner of the San Francisco Renaissance. Many of the Objectivists came from urban communities of new immigrants, and this new vein of experience and language enriched the growing American idiom.

==World War II and after==
Archibald Macleish called John Gillespie Magee Jr. &quot;the first poet of the war&quot;.

World War II saw the emergence of a new generation of poets, many of whom were influenced by Wallace Stevens and Richard Eberhart (1904–2005).
Karl Shapiro (1913–2000), Randall Jarrell (1914–1965) and James Dickey (1923–1997) all wrote poetry that sprang from experience of active service. Together with Elizabeth Bishop (1911–1979), Theodor Seuss Geisel (Dr. Seuss) (1904-1991), Theodore Roethke (1908–1963) and Delmore Schwartz (1913–1966), they formed a generation of poets that in contrast to the preceding generation often wrote in traditional verse forms.

After the war, a number of new poets and poetic movements emerged. John Berryman (1914–1972) and Robert Lowell (1917–1977) were the leading lights in what was to become known as the Confessional movement, which was to have a strong influence on later poets like Sylvia Plath (1932–1963) and Anne Sexton (1928–1974). Though both Berryman and Lowell were closely acquainted with Modernism, they were mainly interested in exploring their own experiences as subject matter and a style that Lowell referred to as &quot;cooked&quot; – that is, consciously and carefully crafted.
In contrast, the Beat poets, who included such figures as Jack Kerouac (1922–1969), Allen Ginsberg (1926–1997), Gregory Corso (1930–2001), Joanne Kyger (1934-2017), Gary Snyder (born 1930), Diane Di Prima (1934-2020), Amiri Baraka (1934-2014) and Lawrence Ferlinghetti (1919-2020), were distinctly raw. Reflecting, sometimes in an extreme form, the open, relaxed and searching society of the 1950s and 1960s, the Beats pushed the boundaries of the American idiom in the direction of demotic speech perhaps further than any other group.

Around the same time, the Black Mountain poets, under the leadership of Charles Olson (1910–1970), were working at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. These poets were exploring the possibilities of open form but in a much more programmatic way than the Beats. The main poets involved were Robert Creeley (1926–2005), Robert Duncan (1919–1988), Denise Levertov (1923–1997), Ed Dorn (1929–1999), Paul Blackburn (1926–1971), Hilda Morley (1916–1998), John Wieners (1934–2002), and Larry Eigner (1927–1996). They based their approach to poetry on Olson&#x27;s 1950 essay &quot;Projective Verse&quot;, in which he called for a form based on the line, a line based on human breath and a mode of writing based on perceptions juxtaposed so that one perception leads directly to another. This in turn influenced the works of Michael McClure (1932-2020), Kenneth Irby (1936–2015), and Ronald Johnson (1935–1998), poets from the Midwestern United States who moved to San Francisco, and in so doing extended the influence of the Black Mountain school geographically westward; their participation in the poetic circles of San Francisco can be seen as partly forming the basis for what would later be known as &quot;Language poetry.&quot;

Other poets often associated with the Black Mountain are Cid Corman (1924–2004) and Theodore Enslin (1925-2011), but they are perhaps correctly viewed as direct descendants of the Objectivists. One-time Black Mountain College resident, composer John Cage (1912–1992), along with Jackson Mac Low (1922–2004), wrote poetry based on chance or aleatory techniques. Inspired by Zen, Dada and scientific theories of indeterminacy, they were to prove to be important influences on the 1970s U.S. &quot;avant-garde.&quot;

The Beats and some of the Black Mountain poets often are considered to have been responsible for the San Francisco Renaissance. However, as previously noted, San Francisco had become a hub of experimental activity from the 1930s thanks to Kenneth Rexroth and Gleason. Other poets involved in this scene included Charles Bukowski (1920–1994) and Jack Spicer (1925–1965). These poets sought to combine a contemporary spoken idiom with inventive formal experiment.

Jerome Rothenberg (1931-2024) is well known for his work in ethnopoetics, but he was the coiner of the term &quot;deep image&quot;, which he used to describe the work of poets like Robert Kelly (born 1935), Diane Wakoski (born 1937) and Clayton Eshleman (1935-2021). Deep Image poetry was inspired by the symbolist theory of correspondences, in particular the work of Spanish poet Federico García Lorca. The term later was popularized by Robert Bly. The Deep Image movement was the most international, accompanied by a flood of new translations from Latin American and European poets such as Pablo Neruda, César Vallejo and Tomas Tranströmer. Some of the poets who became associated with Deep Image are Galway Kinnell, James Wright, Mark Strand and W.S. Merwin. Both Merwin and California poet Gary Snyder became known for their interest in environmental and ecological concerns.

The Small Press poets (sometimes called the mimeograph movement) are another influential and eclectic group of poets who surfaced in the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1950s and are still active today. Fiercely independent editors, who were also poets, edited and published low-budget periodicals and chapbooks of emerging poets who might otherwise have gone unnoticed. This work ranged from formal to experimental. Gene Fowler, A.D. Winans, Hugh Fox, street poet and activist Jack Hirschman, Paul Foreman, Jim Cohn, John Bennett, and F.A. Nettelbeck are among the many poets who are still actively continuing the Small Press Poets tradition. Many have turned to the new medium of the Web for its distribution capabilities.

Los Angeles poets: Leland Hickman (1934–1991), Holly Prado (1938-2019), Harry Northup (born 1940), Wanda Coleman (1946-2013),
Michael C. Ford (born 1939), Kate Braverman (1949-2019), Eloise Klein Healy (born 1943), Bill Mohr, Laurel Ann Bogen, met at Beyond Baroque
Literary Arts Center, in Venice, California. They are lyric poets, heavily autobiographical; some are practitioners of the experimental long poem. Their predecessors in Los Angeles were Ann Stanford (1916–1987), Thomas McGrath (1916–1990), Jack Hirschman (1933-2021). Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center, created by George Drury Smith in 1968, is the central literary arts center in the Los Angeles area.

Just as the West Coast had the San Francisco Renaissance and the Small Press Movement, the East Coast produced the New York School. This group aimed to write poetry that spoke directly of everyday experience in everyday language and produced a poetry of urbane wit and elegance that contrasts with the work of their Beat contemporaries (though in other ways, including their mutual respect for American slang and disdain for academic or &quot;cooked&quot; poetry, they were similar). Leading members of the group include John Ashbery (1927-2017), Frank O&#x27;Hara (1926–1966), Kenneth Koch (1925–2002), James Schuyler (1923–1991), Barbara Guest (1920–2006), Ted Berrigan (1934–1983), Anne Waldman (born 1945) and Bernadette Mayer (born 1945). Of this group, John Ashbery, in particular, has emerged as a defining force in recent poetics, and he is regarded by many as the most important American poet since World War II.

==American poetry today==
The last 40 years of poetry in the United States have brought new groups, schools, and trends into vogue. The 1970s saw a revival of interest in surrealism, with the more prominent poets working in this field being Andrei Codrescu (born in 1946), Russell Edson (1935-2014) and Maxine Chernoff (born in 1952). Performance poetry emerged from the Beat and hippie happenings, the talk-poems of David Antin (1932-2016), and ritual events performed by Rothenberg, to become a serious poetic stance which embraces multiculturalism and a range of poets from a multiplicity of cultures. This mirrored a general growth of interest in poetry by African Americans including Robert Hayden (1913-1980), Gwendolyn Brooks (1917–2000), Maya Angelou (1928–2014), Ishmael Reed (born in 1938), Nikki Giovanni (born in 1943), and Detrick Hughes (born in 1966).

Another group of poets, the Language school (or &quot;L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E&quot;, after the magazine that bears that name), have continued and extended the Modernist and Objectivist traditions of the 1930s. Some poets associated with the group are Lyn Hejinian, Ron Silliman, Tom Mandel, Bob Perelman and Leslie Scalapino. Their poems—fragmentary, purposefully ungrammatical, sometimes mixing texts from different sources and idioms—can be by turns abstract, lyrical, and highly comic.

The Language school includes a high proportion of women, which mirrors another general trend—the rediscovery and promotion of poetry written both by earlier and contemporary women poets. A number of the more prominent African American poets to emerge are women, and other prominent women writers include Adrienne Rich (1929–2012), Jean Valentine (1934–2020), and Amy Gerstler (born in 1956).

Although poetry in traditional classical forms had mostly fallen out of fashion by the 1960s, the practice was kept alive by poets of great formal virtuosity like James Merrill (1926–1995), author of the epic poem &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot;, Richard Wilbur, and British-born San Francisco poet Thom Gunn. The 1980s and 1990s saw a re-emergent interest in traditional form, sometimes dubbed New Formalism or Neoformalism. These include poets such as Molly Peacock, Brad Leithauser, Dana Gioia, Donna J. Stone, Timothy Steele, Alicia Ostriker, and Marilyn Hacker. Some of the more outspoken New Formalists have declared that the return to rhyme and more fixed meters to be the new avant-garde. Their critics sometimes associate this traditionalism with the conservative politics of the Reagan era, noting the recent appointment of Gioia as chair of the National Endowment for the Arts.

Haiku has attracted a community of American poets dedicated to its development as a poetic genre in English. The extremely terse Japanese haiku first influenced the work of Ezra Pound and the Imagists, and post-war poets such as Kerouac and Richard Wright wrote substantial bodies of original haiku in English. Other poets such as Ginsberg, Snyder, Wilbur, Merwin, and many others have at least dabbled with haiku, often simply as a syllabic form. Starting in 1963, with the founding of the journal &quot;American Haiku&quot;, poets such as Cor van den Heuvel, Nick Virgilio, Raymond Roseliep, John Wills, Anita Virgil, Gary Hotham, Marlene Mountain, Wally Swist, Peggy Willis Lyles, George Swede, Michael Dylan Welch, Jim Kacian, and others have created significant oeuvres of haiku poetry, evincing continuities with both Transcendentalism and Imagism and often maintaining an anti-anthropocentric environmental focus on nature during an unparalleled age of habitat destruction and human alienation.
The last two decades have seen a revival of the Beat poetry spoken word tradition, in the form of the poetry slam. Chicago construction worker Marc Smith turned urban poetry performance into audience-judged competitions in 1984. Poetry slams emphasize a style of writing that is topical, provocative and easily understood. Poetry slam opened the door for a generation of writers and spoken word performers, including Alix Olson, Apollo Poetry, Taylor Mali, and Saul Williams, and inspired hundreds of open mics across the U.S.
Poetry has become a significant presence on the Web, with a number of new online journals, &#x27;zines, blogs and other websites. An example of the fluid nature of web-based poetry communities is, &quot;thisisbyus, now defunct, yet this community of writers continues and expands on Facebook and has allowed both novice and professional poets to explore writing styles.
During the contemporary time frame, there were major independent voices who defied links to well-known American poetic movements and forms such as poet and literary critic Robert Peters, greatly influenced by the Victorian English poet Robert Browning’s poetic monologues, became reputable for executing his monologic personae like his Mad King Ludwig II of Bavaria into popular one-man performances. Another example is Louise Glück who cites Emily Dickinson and William Blake as her influences. Critics and scholars have discussed whether or not she is a confessional poet. Sylvia Plath may be another of her influences.

The Library of Congress produces a guide to American poetry inspired by the 9/11 attacks, including anthologies and books dedicated to the subject.

Robert Pinsky has a special place in American poetry as he was the poet laureate of the United States for three terms. No other poet has been so honored. His &quot;Favorite Poem Project&quot; is unique, inviting all citizens to share their all-time favorite poetic composition and why they love it. He is a professor at Boston University and the poetry editor at &quot;Slate&quot;. &quot;Poems to Read&quot; is a demonstration of his poetic vision, joining the word and the common man.

With increased consciousness of society&#x27;s impact on natural ecosystems, it is inexorable that such themes would become integrated into poetry. The foundations of poems about nature are found in the work of Henry David Thoreau and Walt Whitman. The modern ecopoetics movement was pioneered by Jack Collom, who taught a dedicated course on ecopoetics at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado for 17 years. Contemporary poetry on environmental sustainability is found among the works of J.S. Shipman, for example, in, &quot;Calling on You.&quot;

On October 13, 2016, the Nobel committee announced that it would be awarding Bob Dylan the literature prize &quot;for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported: &quot;Mr. Dylan, 75, is the first musician to win the award, and his selection on Thursday is perhaps the most radical choice in a history stretching back to 1901.&quot; Horace Engdahl, a member of the Nobel Committee, described Dylan&#x27;s place in literary history:
The growth in the popularity of graduate creative writing programs has given poets the opportunity to make a living as teachers. This increased professionalization of poetry, combined with the reluctance of most major book and magazine presses to publish poetry, has meant that, for the foreseeable future at least, poetry may have found its new home in the academy and in small independent journals. 
A prominent example was Nobel Laureate Louise Glück who taught at Yale University.

<doc id="412034" wikidata="Q3132849" url="?curid=412034" title="Henry Hyde">
<text>Henry John Hyde (April 18, 1924 – November 29, 2007) was an American politician who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1975 to 2007, representing the 6th District of Illinois, an area of Chicago&#x27;s northwestern suburbs. He was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee from 1995 to 2001, and the House International Relations Committee from 2001 to 2007. Hyde is most famous for being a vocal opponent of abortion; to this end, he was the primary sponsor of the Hyde Amendment, which largely bars the payment of abortions with federal funds.

==Early life and education==
Hyde was born in Chicago, the son of Monica (Kelly) and Henry Clay Hyde. His father was English and his mother was Irish Catholic. His family supported the Democratic Party. Hyde graduated from St. George High School in 1942. He attended Duke University, where he joined the Sigma Chi fraternity, graduated from Georgetown University and obtained his J.D. degree from Loyola University Chicago School of Law. Hyde played basketball for the Georgetown Hoyas where he helped take the team to the 1943 championship game. He served in the Navy during World War II. He remained in the Naval Reserve from 1946 to 1968, as an officer in charge of the U.S. Naval Intelligence Reserve Unit in Chicago. He retired at the rank of Commander. In 1955, Hyde joined the Knights of Columbus, and was a member of Father McDonald Council 1911 in Elmhurst, Illinois.

He was married to Jeanne Simpson Hyde from 1947 until her death in 1992; he had four children and four grandchildren.

==Political career==
Hyde&#x27;s political views began drifting rightward after his collegiate years. By 1952, he had become a Republican and supported Dwight Eisenhower for president. He made his first run for Congress in 1962, losing to Democratic incumbent Roman Pucinski in the 11th District.

Hyde was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1967 and served as Majority Leader from 1971 to 1972. He served in the Illinois House until 1974, when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November, 1974 as one of the few bright spots in what was a disastrous year for Republicans in the wake of the Watergate scandal. He faced a bruising contest against former Cook County state&#x27;s attorney Edward Hanrahan, but was elected by 8,000 votes.

===Political positions and legislation===
Hyde was one of the most vocal and persistent opponents of abortion in American politics and was the chief sponsor of the eponymous Hyde Amendment to the House Appropriations bill that prohibited the use of federal funds to pay for elective abortions through Medicaid. In 1981, however, he and U.S. Senator Jake Garn of Utah, another abortion opponent, broke with the National Pro-Life Political Action Committee, when its executive director, Peter Gemma, issued a &quot;hit list&quot; to target members of both houses of Congress who supported abortion rights. Hyde said such lists are counterproductive because they create irrevocable discord among legislators, any of whom can be subject to a &quot;single issue&quot; attack of this kind. Gemma said he was surprised by the withdrawal of Garn and Hyde from the PAC committee but continued with plans to spend $650,000 for the 1982 elections on behalf of anti-abortion candidates. In 1993 the 1976 Hyde Amendment law was amended to allow payments for abortions in case of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.

An original sponsor of the Brady Bill requiring background checks for gun buyers, Hyde broke with his party in 1994 when he supported a ban on the sale of semi-automatic firearms. An original sponsor of family leave legislation, Hyde said the law promoted &quot;capitalism with a human face.&quot; Hyde played a key role in the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act in 1981.

He was also involved in debates over U.S.-Soviet relations, Central America policy, the War Powers Act, NATO expansion and the investigation of the Iran-Contra affair, and sponsored the United Nations Reform Act of 2005, a bill that ties payment of U.S. dues for United Nations operations to reform of the institution&#x27;s management.

===House committees===
Hyde was a member of the House Judiciary Committee for his entire tenure in the House. He was its chairman from 1995 until 2001, during which time he served as the lead manager during the President Clinton impeachment trial.

From 1985 until 1991, Hyde was the ranking Republican on the House Select Committee on Intelligence. Hyde and the committee&#x27;s senior Democrat, U.S. Rep. Tom Lantos (D-CA), authored America&#x27;s worldwide response to the HIV/AIDS crisis in 2003 and landmark foreign assistance legislation creating the Millennium Challenge Corporation and expanding U.S. funding for successful microenterprise initiatives.

===Savings and Loan scandal===

In 1981, after leaving the House Banking Committee, Hyde went on the board of directors of Clyde Federal Savings and Loan, whose chairman was one of Hyde&#x27;s political contributors. According to Salon.com, from 1982 until he left the board in 1984, Hyde used his position on the board of directors to promote the savings and loan&#x27;s investment in risky financial options. In 1990, the federal government put Clyde in receivership, and paid $67 million to cover insured deposits. In 1993, the Resolution Trust Corporation sued Hyde and other directors for $17.2 million. Four years later, before pretrial investigation and depositions, the government settled with the defendants for $850,000 and made an arrangement exempting Hyde from paying anything. According to Salon.com, Hyde was the only member of the congress sued for &quot;gross negligence&quot; in an S&amp;L failure.

===Iran–Contra investigation===
As a member of the congressional panel investigating the Iran-Contra affair, Hyde vigorously defended the Ronald Reagan administration, and a number of the participants who had been accused of various crimes, particularly Oliver North. Quoting Thomas Jefferson, Hyde argued that although various individuals had lied in testimony before Congress, their actions were excusable because they were in support of the goal of fighting communism.

===Clinton impeachment===

Hyde argued that the House had a constitutional and civic duty to impeach Bill Clinton for perjury. In the Resolution on Impeachment of the President, Hyde wrote:

Clinton was impeached by the House on two charges: perjury and obstruction of justice. Hyde served as chief House manager (prosecutor) at the President&#x27;s trial in the Senate; he became known for his remarks in his closing argument:

Despite Hyde&#x27;s efforts, President Clinton was acquitted of both perjury and obstruction of justice. With a two-thirds majority required for conviction, only 45 senators voted for conviction on the perjury charge and only 50 on the obstruction of justice charge.

Despite being on opposites sides during the impeachment, Hyde was good friends with representative Barney Frank who praised his efforts to keep the impeachment &quot;personality free&quot;.

===Extramarital affair===
While Hyde was spearheading the impeachment of President Bill Clinton amid the revelations of the Clinton–Lewinsky affair, it was revealed that Hyde himself had conducted an extramarital sexual affair with a former beauty stylist named Cherie Snodgrass, who was also married. Hyde admitted to the affair and attributed the relationship as a &quot;youthful indiscretion&quot;. He was 41 years old and married when the affair occurred. Hyde said the affair ended when Snodgrass&#x27; husband confronted Mrs. Hyde. At the time, Snodgrass was 29, also married and had three children.

The Snodgrasses divorced in 1967. The Hydes reconciled and remained married until Mrs. Hyde&#x27;s death in 1992.

===9/11 and the Iraq War===
As Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Hyde was involved in some of the highest level debates concerning the response to the September 11 attacks in 2001. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Hyde cautioned against attacking Iraq in the absence of clear evidence of Iraqi complicity, telling CNN&#x27;s Robert Novak that it &quot;would be a big mistake.&quot; One year later, however, he voted in support of the October 10, 2002 House resolution that authorized the president to go to war with Iraq. In response to Rep. Ron Paul&#x27;s resolution requesting a formal declaration of war, Hyde stated: &quot;There are things in the Constitution that have been overtaken by events, by time. Declaration of war is one of them. ... Inappropriate, anachronistic, it isn&#x27;t done anymore.&quot;

In 2006, Hyde made the following observation in regard to the Bush Administration&#x27;s proclaimed objective of promoting democracy in the Middle East:

==Retirement==
Hyde was reelected 15 times with no substantive opposition. This was mainly because, over time, his district was pushed further into DuPage County, a longstanding bastion of suburban Republicanism. However, by the turn of the century, the demographics of his district shifted, leading his 2004 Democratic challenger Christine Cegelis to garner over 44% of the vote—Hyde&#x27;s closest race since his initial run for the seat. On April 18, 2005 (his 81st birthday), Hyde announced on his website that he would retire at the expiration of his term (in January 2007). A few days earlier, it had been reported that Illinois Republicans were expecting this announcement, and it was further reported that Illinois State Senator Peter Roskam had emerged as a leading contender for the Republican Party&#x27;s nomination. In August 2005, Hyde endorsed Roskam as his successor.

===Order of St. Gregory===
Hyde was named a Papal Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope Benedict XVI in 2006, in recognition of his longtime support for political issues important to the Roman Catholic Church.

===Presidential Medal of Freedom===
Hyde received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor, on November 5, 2007, awarded by President Bush. Hyde was hospitalized, recovering from open-heart surgery, and could not attend the ceremony in person.

==Death==
Hyde died November 29, 2007, nearly eleven months after leaving office, at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago following complications from open heart surgery at Provena Mercy Medical Center in Aurora, Illinois several months earlier. His funeral Mass was presided by Cardinal Francis George of Chicago, and was attended by several dignitaries, including then Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and future Speaker of the House John Boehner, at St. John Neumann Catholic Church in Saint Charles, Illinois.

<text>The Democratic Action Party (abbrev: DAP; ) is a centre-left social democratic political party in Malaysia. As one of four component parties of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, it formed the federal government after defeating Barisan Nasional (BN) in the 2018 Malaysian general election, ending the party&#x27;s 53 year-long stay in the opposition. However, before the coalition finished its first term, defections from partnering parties caused it to lose power after 22 months, culminating in the 2020 Malaysian political crisis. At the 2022 Malaysian general election, the PH coalition which the DAP was part of was returned to power again, albeit without a majority, leading it to form a unity government with political rivals. It is one of the four component parties of the Pakatan Harapan ruling coalition in Malaysia.

The DAP was founded in 1965 by Malaya–based members of the Singaporean People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP), Chen Man Hin and Devan Nair, shortly after Singapore&#x27;s expulsion from Malaysia. Singapore&#x27;s expulsion was in part due to intense ideological differences between the federal government, led by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which favoured the idea of &quot;Ketuanan Melayu&quot; and Malay racial nationalism for the country. In contrast, the PAP favoured a more egalitarian and civic nationalist Malaysian Malaysia, which the DAP would continue to espouse. Following the expulsion, the PAP was elected as the ruling government of a newly sovereign Singapore, and would continue to operate on a platform of civic nationalism.

The DAP draws much of its support from secular and liberal voters with a stable electorate from voters of cities, coastal regions, the middle class (comprising professionals), and the working class. The party&#x27;s strongholds are primarily in the urban and semi-urban areas of Penang, Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Johor, Malacca and the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. In the 2018 Malaysian general election, the party contested in 47 federal and 104 state constituencies under the banner of its ally the People&#x27;s Justice Party, winning 42 and 102 seats respectively, except in Sarawak, where the party&#x27;s state branch chose to contest under its own banner.

== History ==


=== Formation ===
The party is the direct successor of the Malaysian branch of the Singapore–based People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP), which was then known as the People&#x27;s Action Party of Malaya. Singapore&#x27;s expulsion from Malaysia led to its deregistration in 1965 by the Registrar of Societies (RoS). The deregistered party&#x27;s leadership consisted of Devan Nair (secretary-general), Chen Man Hin (chairman), D. P. Xavier (assistant secretary-general), Goh Hock Guan (vice-chairman), Seeveratnam Sinnathamby (treasurer), who was the younger brother of Singapore minister S. Rajaratnam, with Zain Azahari bin Zainal Abidin, Chin Chan Sung, Michael Khong Chye Huat, Tan Chong Bee and Too Chee Cheong as committee members.

The Democratic Action Party was officially formed on 11 October 1965 by the remnants of the People&#x27;s Action Party of Malaya. However, the registration of the party was delayed to 18 March 1966 while the ruling Alliance Party laid out new conditions for the registration of political parties in the Societies Act 1966. While awaiting the party&#x27;s registration, party chairman Chen Man Hin won the state constituency of Rahang, Negeri Sembilan as an independent in December 1965.

In August 1966, the official party organ, &quot;The Rocket&quot;, was first published.

The party adopted the Setapak Declaration at the first DAP National Congress held on 29 July 1967, declaring itself &quot;irrevocably committed to the ideal of a free, democratic and socialist Malaysia, based on the principles of racial and religious equality, social and economic justice, and founded on the institution of parliamentary democracy&quot;, and later joined the Socialist International, participating in the organisation&#x27;s International Council in Zurich, Switzerland.

=== Early electoral success ===
In 1967, the party was involved in discussions to form a united front of opposition parties against the Alliance coalition ahead of the 1969 general election without success.

In March 1968, the party negotiated an agreement with the People&#x27;s Progressive Party(PPP) to avoid contesting against each other in the state of Perak for the upcoming general election. The DAP sought to achieve a similar agreement with the United Democratic Party (UDP), whose stronghold was Penang, but failed to come to an understanding with its leader Lim Chong Eu, who sarcastically thanked DAP secretary-general Goh Hock Guan for &quot;his very smug condescension.&quot; The same month, the DAP was approached by the newly formed Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia, then led by Syed Hussein Alatas, which suggested the DAP merge into the new party. 

Devan Nair, who was amongst those who founded the DAP, returned to Singapore in 1969 after being withdrawn as a candidate for the 1969 general election, later becoming its president in 1981. Lee Kuan Yew, then Prime Minister of Singapore under the PAP, explained in 1981 that &quot;the Cabinet decided that Singapore-Malaysia relations would always be bedevilled if Devan Nair remained a DAP leader. I persuaded him to come back&quot;.

The DAP contested a general election for the first time in 1969 together with both the People&#x27;s Progressive Party and Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia in an electoral pact. In line with their commitment to equality, the DAP originally campaigned against Bumiputera privileges, such as those afforded to them by Article 153 of the Constitution. They also continued Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s campaign for a &quot;Malaysian Malaysia&quot;, the idea of which was originally conveyed by Lee in Parliament: &quot;Malaysia – to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, sitting in this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian&quot;.

The DAP went on to win 13 Parliamentary seats and 31 State Assembly seats, with 11.9% of all valid votes that were cast in the election; the Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan) which campaigned on a similar platform also made major gains. The 1969 election marked the biggest gains ever made by an opposition party in Malaysia before 2008, and came close to seeing the ruling Alliance toppled from power. However, the racial riots sparked by provocative political rallies in the immediate aftermath of the election led to what is now known as the 13 May Incident, resulting in the suspension of parliament and the formation of the National Operations Council, which governed the country until 1971 in place of the elected government. 

When parliament reconvened, it passed pieces of legislation such as the Sedition Act that criminalized the discussion of repealing certain portions of the Constitution. Most of these concerned Bumiputra privileges, such as Article 153. The DAP and the People&#x27;s Progressive Party were the only parties that voted against the Act, which passed by a vote of 125 to 17. After the 1969 election, the DAP would never come close to repeating its past successes for the next 38 years. Although the DAP remained a major opposition party, the ruling coalition had clung solidly to its two-thirds parliamentary majority. The DAP, however, continued campaigning on its platform of abolishing the Bumiputra privileges, securing equal rights for all Malaysians, and establishing a democratic socialist state in Malaysia. 

=== 1970–2007 ===
The party boycotted the National Consultative Council, a body formed in the aftermath of the 1969 racial riots to &quot;establish positive and practical guidelines for inter-racial co-operation and social integration&quot;, in protest of the government&#x27;s continued detention of its secretary-general, Lim Kit Siang, under the Internal Security Act.

In 1978, the party experienced a split when founding member and Penang state chairman Yeap Ghim Guan left and formed the Socialist Democratic Party after attempts by the national leadership to take over the party&#x27;s state leadership. Yeap was joined by the entire state committee and member of parliament for Petaling Oh Keng Seng. They were later joined by party stalwart Fan Yew Teng, who had served as acting secretary-general while Lim was detained under the Internal Security Act and was the member of parliament for Menglembu. Those who had left the party all labelled Lim&#x27;s leadership as &quot;dictatorial&quot;.

The party suffered more defections in the lead-up to the 1978 Malaysian general election, when one of its most prominent Malay members, Daing Ibrahim Othman, left the party in protest of the leadership&#x27;s decision to move him to another constituency, which was followed by a number of resignations in Negeri Sembilan for similar reasons.

In 1995, the party ran what has become widely known as the &quot;Robocop&quot; campaign to wrest Penang from the Barisan Nasional. Despite the hype, the campaign was a failure as the party only won one state and three parliamentary seats. The strategy backfired when Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, BN leaders and the media criticised Lim Kit Siang as a &quot;robot&quot; and &quot;soulless&quot; person.

Following the ousting of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in September 1998, DAP co-founded the Barisan Alternatif coalition along with Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party and the newly formed People&#x27;s Justice Party. However, the coalition did not work out very well for the DAP, with two of its top leaders, Lim Kit Siang and Karpal Singh losing their Parliamentary seats in the 1999 election; the DAP managed to win only 5% (10 out of 193) of the seats in Parliament. PAS became the leading opposition party in Parliament. It left the coalition in 2001 due to a disagreement with PAS over the issue of an Islamic state.

In the 2004 general election, the DAP managed to capture 12 seats in Parliament, while PAS and Keadilan suffered major setbacks, with PAS losing 20 of the 27 seats it had held after the 1999 elections, and Keadilan lost all seats except one returned after a recount. The eventual outcome saw Lim Kit Siang, who had been elected in his constituency of Ipoh Timur with a majority of 10,000 votes, formally elected as the leader of the opposition in Parliament, a post he had lost to the president of PAS in 1999.

In the 2006 Sarawak state election, the Democratic Action Party won 6 of the 12 seats it contested and narrowly lost three other seats with small majorities. Up til then it was the party&#x27;s best showing ever in the history of Sarawak&#x27;s state elections since 1979.

=== 2008–2015 ===
Pakatan Rakyat was formed in 2008 by DAP, PKR and PAS. In the 2008 general election, the DAP won 13% (28 out of 222) of the seats in the Dewan Rakyat, with PAS and PKR making substantial gains as well with 23 seats and 31 seats respectively. In total, the taking of 82 seats (37%) by the opposition to Barisan Nasional&#x27;s 140 seats (63%), makes it the best performance in Malaysian history by the opposition, and denied Barisan Nasional the two-thirds majority required to make constitutional changes in the Dewan Rakyat. DAP advisor Lim Kit Siang expressed surprise at the election results but declared it to be the true power of the voice of the Malaysian people for the leaders of the country to hear them. In addition, DAP, having secured all its contested seats in the state of Penang, formed the Penang state government with its alliance partners PKR and PAS, the Chief Minister being DAP&#x27;s Lim Guan Eng, son of Lim Kit Siang.

In the 2011 Sarawak state election, DAP furthered its gains from the previous election, winning 12 out of the 70 state assembly seats, with PR winning a total of 15 state seats and 41% of the popular vote. The PR&#x27;s success was further enhanced in the 2013 general election when DAP went on to win 17% (38 out of 222) of the seats in the Dewan Rakyat and the PR coalition won the popular vote, giving the BN government its worst election showing since independence. In 2015, the PR alliance broke up after a PAS Muktamar (General Assembly) motion unanimously approved the breaking of ties with DAP due to disagreements over PAS&#x27;s decision to propose a private member&#x27;s bill to implement &quot;hudud&quot; (Islamic penal code). Following PAS&#x27;s decision to cut ties with DAP, DAP announced that PR had &quot;ceased to exist&quot;.

At the DAP election in December 2012, Vincent Wu, who was initially declared to have secured the sixth spot with 1,202 votes, dropped to 26th place because he had actually secured only 669. Zairil Khir Johari was elected to the central executive committee (CEC) with 803 votes to secure the 20th spot. The glitch, reportedly because of a vote tabulation error due to the copy-and-paste method in Microsoft Excel, had raised suspicion. The DAP admitted to the counting error after discovering the mistake. The DAP election fiasco had caused unease among party members and led to protests to the Registrar of Societies (RoS). Two dissatisfied life members of the DAP then lodged reports with the RoS on the party elections following the revelations. Following the report the RoS had informed DAP of the dispute by its members and in turn as provided for under Section 3A of the Societies Act 1966 did recognise the office-bearers of the committee formed in the party elections on 15 December 2012, the point of contention.

DAP chairperson Karpal Singh said DAP will contest under the PAS logo for the Peninsula and PKR logo in Sabah and Sarawak in the 13th general election, following the Registrar of Societies&#x27; (RoS) failure to respond on the withdrawal letter of RoS informing that it does not recognise the party&#x27;s top leadership line-up. DAP had appealed to the RoS to withdraw its letter to suspend the party&#x27;s existing central executive committee (CEC) but the department was silent on the matter.

On 19 April 2013, DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng informed all its 51 parliament and 103 state candidates to use the rocket symbol first during nomination tomorrow, and show the Election Commission the letter of authorisation signed by secretary-general Lim Guan Eng. If the rocket symbol is rejected, then use the letter of authorisation signed by PAS secretary-general Mustafa Ali for Peninsula Malaysia and PKR letter of authorisation for Sabah and Sarawak. This came after the DAP decided to use PAS and PKR symbols for the coming general election on 5 May. He said the DAP headquarters in Kuala Lumpur received a letter by hand from the RoS at 10 p.m. on 19 April, stating that it had no objections to the DAP using the logo, and that the Election Commission (EC) had informed all returning officers to accept nominations from the DAP.

On 29 September 2013, DAP held a special congress to vote for a new Central Executive Committee.

=== 2015–2019===
On 22 September 2015, the Pakatan Harapan coalition was formed by DAP, PKR and the National Trust Party to succeed Pakatan Rakyat. In the 2016 Sarawak state election, the party lost its gains from the previous election, retaining only 7 of the 12 seats it had won in 2011, while Pakatan Harapan as whole won 10 state seats and 30.16% of the popular vote.

On 12 February 2017, Kota Melaka MP, Sim Tong Him, along with three other DAP state assemblymen from Melaka, Goh (Duyong), Lim Jack Wong (Bachang), and Chin Choong Seong (Kesidang), announced their resignation from the party, citing a lack of trust in the party&#x27;s leadership.

The party participated in the 2018 general election as a part of Pakatan Harapan, now a four-member coalition with the addition of Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (BERSATU). During the election, the coalition won 113 seats and was able to form the federal government after securing an alliance with the Sabah Heritage Party. The DAP won 42 seats of the 47 seats it contested, making it the second-largest party from Pakatan Harapan in the parliament&#x27;s lower house behind PKR, which had won 47 seats. The party was given six ministerial portfolios and secured seven deputy minister positions in the Seventh Mahathir cabinet, with then-secretary-general of the party Lim Guan Eng being appointed Minister of Finance, becoming the first person of Malaysian Chinese descent to hold the position in 44 years since Tan Siew Sin from the Malaysian Chinese Association, who served in that capacity from 1959 until 1974. Other ministerial appointments included Loke Siew Fook as Minister of Transport, who eventually replaced Lim Kit Siang as DAP parliamentary leader on 11 July 2018, Kulasegaran Murugeson as Minister of Human Resources, Yeo Bee Yin as Minister of Energy, Teresa Kok as Minister of Primary Industries, and Gobind Singh Deo as Minister of Communications and Multimedia.

===2020–2022 Malaysian political crisis===

On 24 February 2020, the DAP became the largest party in the Dewan Rakyat for the first time after 11 of the People&#x27;s Justice Party&#x27;s 50 MPs resigned during the political crisis. UMNO had also lost 16 of its 54 MPs over several months, mostly through defections to Bersatu. Though the political crisis resulted in the collapse of the Pakatan Harapan government, it retained its 42 MPs. However, over the course of the crisis, a number of state assemblymen defected to opposing coalitions. On 9 March 2020, Paul Yong and A Sivasubramaniam left the party to join the new Perikatan Nasional state government in Perak. The next day on 10 March, DAP expelled Norhizam Hassan Baktee, assemblyman for Pengkalan Batu, over his support for the new Perikatan Nasional government in Melaka. The party also expelled Sabah assemblyman Ronnie Loh for his support of Perikatan&#x27;s attempt to replace Sabah state government led by Shafie Apdal and his Warisan Plus coalition.

Separately, the party&#x27;s Sarawak vice-chairman and Padungan assemblyman Wong King Wei resigned on 27 July 2020, claiming the party had deviated from its objectives and citing his disillusionment with party leadership. He continued to hold his seat as an independent until his term ended in 2021.

==Ethnic diversity==
DAP was founded by Chen Man Hin and Devan Nair, who were ethnic Chinese and Indian respectively. The majority of DAP&#x27;s party membership is of ethnic Chinese and Indian heritage, with most elected positions within the party being held by Chinese members. While the party has fielded Malay candidates in every general election since 1969, only five had ever been elected by 2008. Of the five, two had been elected in 1969 as state legislative assemblymen, while the party&#x27;s first Malay member of parliament was only elected in 1990. The DAP also only gained its first native Sabahan (Kadazandusun) legislator in 2013, Edwin Jack Bosi, who sat in Sabah State Legislative Assembly. The lack of Malay members within the party has led to DAP being viewed as a &quot;racist&quot; or &quot;anti-Malay&quot; party by political opponents in that it is exclusively concerned with the issues of the Chinese or Indian communities.

=== Allegations of racism and chauvinism ===
Despite constant rebuttals by party leaders, DAP has been depicted by their political opponents, especially from UMNO, as a party that favours the Malaysian Chinese minority above others. This allegation of racial chauvinism culminated in a two-piece television program broadcast on government-controlled TV channel &quot;Radio Televisyen Malaysia&quot; (RTM) entitled &quot;Bahaya Cauvinisme&quot;, which translates to &quot;Dangers of Chauvinism&quot;. The program forced then party leader Lim Kit Siang to issue a formal media statement to counter the allegations.

On 15 November 2011, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, the Malaysian Minister for Domestic Trade, Co-operatives and Consumerism, accused DAP&#x27;s publicity chief, Tony Pua of racism for making repeated attacks against the Kedai Rakyat 1Malaysia, a government initiative to supply cheap retail products to Malaysian consumers. Tony Pua was criticised for singling out Kedai Rakyat 1Malaysia, whose suppliers to the store generally come from the Malaysian Bumiputra community, and for not investigating the quality of products supplied by Malaysian-Chinese suppliers or making similar accusations against independent Malaysian-Chinese stores.

Allegations of racism have forced DAP party leader Lim Guan Eng to issue a formal denial in the Penang High Court.

== Party symbols ==
=== Party logo ===
The symbol or logo of the DAP (see above) is the rocket, which it has used since the 1969 general election. Its components are symbolised as follows:

* The red rocket symbolises the Party&#x27;s aspiration for a modern, dynamic and progressive society
* The four rocket boosters represent the support and drive given to the Party objectives by the three major ethnicities (Malay, Chinese, Indian) and others
* The blue circle stands for the unity of the multi-racial people of Malaysia
* The white background stands for purity and incorruptibility

=== Ubah mascot ===

In 2008, DAP initially introduced &quot;Rocket Kid&quot;, a rocket as the party&#x27;s official mascot during the 12th Malaysian general election. This was then changed to Ubah bird, a hornbill which was designed by Ooi Leng Hang and was launched during the Sarawak state election in 2011 and also used as part of their political campaigning during the 13th Malaysian general election in 2013. DAP had adopted this bird as a symbol for change both for its unique characteristics, hardiness and representation of the unity of both East Malaysia and West Malaysia into a Malaysian nation. Its merchandise such as plush toys, buttons and car stickers were very well received by the public. The idea of the mascot came from Sarawak DAP Secretary and future state party chairman, Chong Chieng Jen, who felt a mascot would boost the spirit of the people. The name &quot;Ubah&quot;, which means &quot;change&quot; in Malay, is in line with the party&#x27;s aspirations in changing the ruling party of the Malaysian federal government. In addition to its original Sarawak Iban costume, &quot;Ubah&quot; now comes in a Malay costume for Hari Raya, Indian costume for Deepavali, Chinese costume for Chinese New Year, Santa Claus costume for Christmas, and a Superman costume that depicts the power of the people. On 13 July 2013, a gigantic float known as the &quot;Ubah Inflatable Bird (Water Ubah)&quot; was officially launched at IJM Promenade, Jelutong, Penang by DAP Secretary General Lim Guan Eng.

=== Songs ===
DAP&#x27;s official party anthem is &quot;Berjuang Untuk Rakyat Malaysia (Fighting for the Malaysian People)&quot;.

Other than the official party anthem, DAP has also unveiled several theme songs and music videos mostly with an Ubah theme such as &quot;Ubah&quot; with over 1,000,000 views, 明天 with over 500,000 views and &quot;Ubah Rocket Style&quot; with over 300,000 views, which is a parody of the viral YouTube hit &quot;Gangnam Style&quot;.

== Leadership structure ==
=== Central Executive Committee ===

The Central Executive Committee (CEC) serves as the party&#x27;s executive body and its 30 members are elected by party delegates during a national congress held every three years. The CEC, in turn, elects the party&#x27;s national leadership from among its own members, including the Secretary-General, in whom executive power is vested. The current Secretary-General is Minister of Transport Anthony Loke. The latest leadership structure can be found below.

<text>The Stour is a river flowing through the counties of Worcestershire, the West Midlands and Staffordshire in the West Midlands region of England. The Stour is a major tributary of the River Severn, and is about in length. It has played a considerable part in the economic history of the region.

==Etymology and usage==
The river-name &quot;Stour&quot;, common in England, does not occur at all in Wales; Crawford noted two tributaries of the Po River near Turin, spelled &quot;Sture&quot;. In Germany the &quot;Stoer&quot; (Stör) flows into the River Elbe. The name &quot;Stour&quot; is pronounced differently in different cases. The Kentish Stour rhymes with &quot;tour&quot;; the Oxfordshire Stour is sometimes rhymes with the &quot;mower&quot;, sometimes with &quot;hour&quot;. The Worcestershire and Suffolk Stour always rhyme with &quot;hour&quot;.

The origin of the name(s) remains in dispute. The Middle English word &quot;&quot; has two distinct meanings and derivations, still current enough to appear in most substantial dictionaries. As an adjective, with Germanic roots, it signifies &quot;large, powerful&quot;. As a noun, from medieval French roots, it signifies &quot;tumult, commotion; confusion&quot; or an &quot;armed battle or conflict&quot;. The primary definition in the &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary&quot; is &quot;blowing or deposit of dust&quot;, a northern English and Scottish usage of uncertain derivation. Recently it has been suggested by Richard Coates that an Old European river-name was taken for an Old English adjective and that &quot;stour&quot; came to represent one pole of a structural opposition, with &quot;blyth&quot; at the opposite pole, allowing Anglo-Saxons to classify rivers on a continuum of fierceness.

However, Margaret Gelling, a specialist in Midland toponyms, emphasises the importance of situating place-names in the landscape. It is hard to see the river in dramatic terms. Undoubtedly it has a history of flooding and can rise quickly after rain, but it is unlikely that anyone familiar with the Severn, into which it flows, could see the Stour as embodying raw power or turbulence. The Victorian etymologist Isaac Taylor, now long discredited on many counts, proposed a very simple solution: that &quot;Stour&quot; derives from &quot;dŵr&quot;, the Welsh word for water.
(Celtic origins are quite likely in the West Midlands and Worcestershire.) It is possible that the various Stours do not share a common origin or significant characteristics, requiring each to be considered on their terms. Certainly there is currently no universally-accepted explanation.

==Course==

The river rises in the north of Worcestershire in the Clent Hills, near St Kenelm&#x27;s Church in Romsley. It collects water from many small tributary streams from the Clent Hills as it descends, following a generally north-easterly course, before veering north into the West Midlands at Halesowen.

The river continues to gather strength from Clent streams as it flows through Halesowen, before turning westwards through the southern part of the Black Country, staying within the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. It flows through Cradley and Lye and then between Stourbridge, to which it gives its name, and Amblecote, historically an important centre of the glass industry. Here it passes half-concealed through industrial estates that have replaced traditional heavy industry, shadowed for a few kilometres by the Stourbridge Canal. It leaves the conurbation via the suburb of Wollaston, descending fairly rapidly from the West Midlands plateau to Prestwood.

The Stour enters Staffordshire at Prestwood and veers southwards, henceforward shadowed by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, which crosses over it on a sandstone aqueduct just before its confluence with the Smestow Brook, an important tributary that drains the area north to Wolverhampton. The Stour flows south to Stourton and then loops along the eastern edge of the large village of Kinver, whence it flows back into Worcestershire.

Passing through the villages of Caunsall, Cookley and Wolverley, it is joined by the Horse Brook, which drains an area extending northward into Shropshire, and the Honey Brook. Further south, the Wannerton Brook brings in water from the Blakedown area, on the western fringe of the Clent Hills. The Stour then bisects Kidderminster from north to south. Here it is hidden from sight for a short distance as it passes beneath the canal, to emerge on its eastern side. At the southern edge of Kidderminster the Stour is joined by the Barnett Brook, a major tributary which begins in the Clent Hills, and which, together with the Hoo Brook, creates a large complex of pools to the east. Passing through the formerly navigable section around Wilden, it joins the River Severn at Stourport, in a small, old industrial area to the east of the canal port.

==Geology==
The Stour rises on the north-eastern edge of the Clent Hills, an outcrop of New red sandstone that traps it on the West Midland plateau. Its course is mainly over similar sandstone, together with some gravels, as it finds its way off the plateau by a fairly circuitous route, to the Severn valley. In this it is similar to the Tame and its own tributary, the Smestow: all are forced to wander far along generally shallow gradients as they find their way from the plateau, which is essentially a shallow dish in shape - a low tableland with raised edges. It carries mainly sandy sediments, as can be seen after rainfall.

==Wildlife==
The Stour was once a trout stream, but became severely polluted with chemicals that were released into it by industries along its banks, particularly acid from the holloware industry of Lye. In the final decades of the 20th century, this pollution ceased, and the river was cleaned up. Nowadays, wildlife is making a comeback in the Stour with kingfishers and grey heron present, as well as recent reports of salmon and trout beginning to recolonise as far as Stourbridge.

For a short section west of Stourbridge, the Stour marks the boundary, between the historic counties of Staffordshire and Worcestershire. It also historically formed part of the boundary of an exclave of Shropshire, which contained Halesowen, until the town was transferred to Worcestershire in the 19th century, along with nearby Oldbury.

===Industry===
Mills were a crucial part of the medieval economy and the Stour was well able to power them. At Cradley, at the confluence of the upper Stour and the Lutley Gutter (also known as the Pudding Brook), in what was to become the Black Country, the earliest mentions of mills date back to the 12th century. Two corn mills are mentioned in Kinver in the Domesday Book.

From the Middle Ages, the lower Stour was important in this early industrial development, as its fulling mills thickened cloth made in Worcester, Kidderminster, and Kinver. From the 17th century there was a proliferation of iron forges fined pig iron and slitting mills, which cut bars of iron into rods for the production of nails in the Black Country. Blade mills (on tributaries), sharpened the blades of scythes and other tools from the 15th century. Richard Foley established one of the earliest slitting mills at the Hyde, Kinver in 1627.

Many of the mills on the Stour were formerly concerned with the iron industry. Whittington, near Kinver, had a forge and then a slitting mill, and finally a nail mill. Mills were converted from one use to another, as demand fluctuated: fulling mills of the 16th century, often became forges or slitting mills in the 17th. The 17th century iron industry along the Stour and its tributaries is connected with the name of Dud Dudley (an illegitimate son of Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley) who carried out early experiments, using coal products to substitute for charcoal in iron production and wrote a book, &quot;Metallum Martis&quot;. The Dudley family had works at Cradley. The Foley family were much more important in the later 17th century and the Knight family in the 18th. Iron production continued well into the 19th century (occasionally, even later), but the valley was overshadowed by the coke-based industry on the Black Country plateau.

===Navigation===

In the 1660s and 1670s, Andrew Yarranton attempted to make the river Stour itself navigable along much of its course. But these efforts were finally abandoned around 1680, when funds were exhausted. It is doubtful whether it would have been a profitable enterprise, had it succeeded. At Wilden a short section of the Stour, of about a mile, was successfully made navigable but because of all the bends it is recorded that it was not easy to navigate. There was a lock at Pratt&#x27;s Wharf (misnamed Platt&#x27;s Wharf by the Ordnance Survey) connecting the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal with the river. This enabled canal barges to use the River Stour to deliver timber to a steam saw-mill in Wilden. Later it was used to transport coal and iron to the Wilden Works. The wharf was built by Isaac Pratt from Henwick, Worcester in 1835. He is described as a businessman and a merchant. There were two houses at Pratt&#x27;s Wharf, one occupied by a lock keeper and the other by a clerk. The link was closed 1950.

The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, planned by James Brindley, was built between 1770 and 1772. It shadows the Smestow, and then the Stour from Prestwood southward, cutting across its many bends and meanders. From Stourton Junction (near Prestwood), the Stourbridge Canal led to Stourbridge, thus shadowing the upper Stour, while branches led towards collieries near Brierley Hill and linked to the Dudley Canal. These were all built in the late 18th century, effectively creating a canal network parallel to the river network.

===Later industry===
Kidderminster, long a centre of cloth manufacture, increasingly specialised in carpet-making from about 1785. The Stour took on a fresh importance as this industry grew, driving the fulling and weaving processes, as well as carrying away the effluent - particularly when dyed cloth was washed in the river. The flow of the Stour became so crucial to the manufacturers of the town that they persistently fought attempts to extract water for industrial and domestic use from the Smestow - potentially of great value to Wolverhampton and the Black Country.

The magnificent Stambermill Viaduct carries what was the former Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway line over the Stour between Stourbridge and Lye. It now is only used by goods trains.

==Tributaries==
The main tributaries of the Stour are, travelling upstream from its confluence with the River Severn:

* The Barnett Brook or Belne Brook, which enters from the left, bringing water from a number of tributary streams. The Barnett Brook originates on the Clent Hills (on the opposite side of the watershed to the Stour&#x27;s own feeder streams). To the north-west of Belbroughton, two major feeder streams converge at Bell End (one of which is known as Fenn Brook). The stream known locally as Belne Brook then flow into Belbroughton where another feeder stream from the foot of the Clent Hills joins it. It leaves Belbroughton and flows through Drayton, and then to Stone where a tributary from Harvington Hall joins it. From there it flows into Kidderminster where at the Spennels Valley Nature Reserve it is joined by the Hoo Brook, (a stream that supply a complex of lakes and pools towards Stone, to the south-east of Kidderminster).
*Known as Wannerton Brook, at its confluence with the Stour one mile below Wolverley, at Broadwaters to the north of Kidderminster. Its three largest feeder streams converge and feed a series of pools in Blakedown where the stream is known as the Blakedown Brook. Two of the three feeder streams start on the Clent Hills (on the opposite side of the watershed to the Stour&#x27;s own feeder streams) the first originates in St Kenelm&#x27;s Pass above High Clent and passes down through West Hagley on to Stakenbridge and Churchill. The second originates above another hamlet in Clent called Walton Pool and flows down to Holy Cross and then on to Broom where it is known as Gallows Brook. The third, and the shortest rises in Yieldingtree, but it supplies several old mill ponds before converging with the main stream just south of Blakedown.
* The Honey Brook, which enters from the right, opposite Wolverley Court, close to the Kidderminster suburb of Franche.
* The Horse Brook or Horsebrook, which also joins from the right, bringing water from the Shatterford and Kingsford areas, and from parts of South Staffordshire and Shropshire.
* The Mill Brook, which enters from the right at the Hyde, opposite Dunsley near Kinver, and drains an area within South Staffordshire to the north of Kinver.
* The River Smestow, also known as the Smestow Brook, the Stour&#x27;s largest tributary, which enters from the right. The Smestow drains an area well to the north, originating in the northern suburbs of Wolverhampton, and looping around the city to flow past Wombourne and join the Stour at Prestwood.
* The Lutley Gutter, also known locally as the Pudding Brook, which enters from the left at Cradley and, together with the Stour itself, has played a major role in the industrial history of the town.

==Settlements==
The main settlement on the Stour are, travelling upstream from its confluence with the River Severn:

===In Worcestershire===
* Stourport-on-Severn, traditionally a canal port and resort town, where the Stour joins the Severn.
* Kidderminster, an industrial and commercial centre.
* Wolverley, which is in the same parish as the neighbouring villages of Cookley and Caunsall.

===In Staffordshire===
* Kinver, once an important industrial village, but now mainly a residential and tourist centre.
* Stourton and Prestwood

===In Dudley Metropolitan Borough in the West Midlands===
* Stourbridge, with its suburbs of Wollaston (before 1974, part of Worcestershire) and Amblecote (historically part of Staffordshire), traditionally a centre of the glass industry.
* Lye, formerly a centre of heavy industry, now best known for its strip of Indian restaurants specialising in balti meals. Before 1974, part of Worcestershire.
* Cradley, once famous for its forges specialising in chain making. Before 1974, part of Worcestershire.
* Halesowen, also once a centre for forges, specialising in nail making, but now largely a residential and commercial area. Traditionally an exclave of Shropshire, from 1844 until 1974 it was part of Worcestershire.

===In Worcestershire===
* Romsley, where the Stour originates in a spring outside the main village but within the parish. Before 1844, part of Shropshire, together with Halesowen. 1974–1998: part of the County of Hereford and Worcester

<doc id="412053" wikidata="Q434105" url="?curid=412053" title="Steve Cram">
<text>Stephen Cram, (born 14 October 1960) is a British retired track and field athlete. Along with fellow Britons Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett, he was one of the world&#x27;s dominant middle distance runners during the 1980s. Nicknamed &quot;The Jarrow Arrow&quot;, after his home town, Cram set world records in the 1,500 m, 2,000 m, and the mile during a 19-day period in the summer of 1985. He was the first man to run 1,500 m under 3 minutes and 30 seconds. He won the 1,500 m gold medal at the 1983 World Championships and the 1,500 m silver medal at the 1984 Olympic Games.

In 2000, Cram co-founded international children’s charity COCO (Comrades of Children Overseas) with British Army Major Jim Panton after running the Bosnia Comrades ultramarathon in 1998. Cram remains chairman of COCO, an organisation which currently provides education to children living in poor, remote parts of East Africa.

In 2008, Cram was appointed Chancellor of the University of Sunderland, replacing Lord Puttnam, and in 2009 was elected as President of Jarrow &amp; Hebburn Athletics Club.

Cram now works as a television presenter and athletics commentator, motivational speaker and athletics coach. In 2021, he was elected as the new president of the British Orienteering Federation.

== Athletics career ==
In 1980, Cram won his place in the British Olympic team after finishing in 2nd place to Steve Ovett in the mile at Crystal Palace. The race had been marked as a run-off between Cram and Scottish miler Graham Williamson for the final place (a selection decision which was severely criticised by Ovett in his 1984 autobiography). Cram, aged 19, reached the final of the 1,500 m at the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games, in which Ovett and Sebastian Coe famously vied for the gold medal. Cram finished in eighth place.

Capitalising on his Olympic experience, Cram made his major breakthrough in 1982, a year in which Coe and Ovett were largely absent with injuries. Cram took 1,500 m gold at the Commonwealth Games and also the 1982 European Championships in Athens, where he raced to gold after breaking from the field with 600 metres to go following Williamson&#x27;s fall.

Injury had disrupted Cram in the early part of the 1983 season, but he recovered in time for the 1983 World Championships in Helsinki and just prior to the games beat Coe (who was suffering from an undiagnosed virus at the time) in an 800 m at Gateshead. In a slow final, he strategically beat a large field following Saïd Aouita&#x27;s break with 500 metres to go. Ovett became trapped in the pack, ultimately finishing fourth, while Cram outkicked Steve Scott and Aouita in the last 200 metres. In a remark made in Cram&#x27;s presence shortly afterwards which spoke to the depth of British milers, Ovett noted that Britain was the home of the Olympic champion, World champion and World Record holder in the 1,500 m - titles held by Coe, Cram and Ovett respectively.

At Crystal Palace later that summer, Cram won an epic mile race, in which he led Ovett by little more than a metre with 300 metres to go and maintained that lead right to the finishing line. In a 2006 interview, Cram described the race: &quot;It was a cat-and-mouse affair - we both started off running at the back of the field. I beat him by little more than the thickness of a vest.&quot;

In 1984, Cram&#x27;s season was severely hampered by injury, although he recovered sufficiently to win silver in the 1,500 m at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, behind defending champion Coe.

He came back stronger in 1985, a year in which he was only beaten three times; by Coe at 800 m, McKean at 800 m and Ovett in a road Mile. In the 800 m, not his best event, he beat the reigning 800 m Olympic Champion, Joaquim Cruz, in 1:42.88, the fastest time he was ever to run, off even splits of 51.2 &amp; 51.7. He broke three world records (1,500 m, Mile, 2,000 m) within a 19-day span, and recorded a British All Comers Record over the 1,000 m, running 2:12.88 in windy conditions at Gateshead (the second fastest 1,000 m in history at the time behind Coe&#x27;s 2:12.18, and now 3rd to Noah Ngeny&#x27;s 2:11.98). He was the first man to run under 3:30.00 for the 1,500 m, just beating Saïd Aouita in Nice (running 3:29.67 to Aouita&#x27;s 3:29.71). His mile time of 3:46.32, recorded at the Bislett Stadium in Oslo, stood for eight years and, stood as the European record until 2023 when Jakob Ingebrigtsen ran 3:43.73. This run was notable for the fact that this was an actual competitive race against Sebastian Coe with the first three laps being below schedule, although pretty even in pace distribution (57.2, 57.3, 58.7), followed by an exceptional last lap (440yds) of 53.2.

While the likes of Coe and Ovett had a devastating sprint finish over the last 100 metres, Cram tended to wind up the speed gradually over the last 300 metres of races, making him very difficult to catch. However, during the 1985 season he said (and indeed demonstrated) that he could win from any position and happily ran near the back of world class fields before unleashing his kick, often with a lap or so to go. This tactic, his elegant, high stepping action and his effortless acceleration made him one of the most exciting middle distance runners to watch.

Cram&#x27;s good form continued into the 1986 season. At the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, he won the 800 m, finishing 15 metres clear of Tom McKean and Peter Elliott in 1:43:22 - still the Commonwealth Games record. He followed this up with gold in the 1,500 m and was persuaded to run both events at the 1986 European Championships in Stuttgart. He arrived at the European Championships &quot;just over the edge&quot; as he suggested in David Miller&#x27;s biography of Coe, &quot;Born to Run&quot;. Nevertheless, he won the bronze in the 800 m having been blocked down the back straight by Tom McKean who made his run at the same time as Cram and, though leading into the straight, lacked the zest he showed in the Commonwealth games and was unable to hold off the challenges of McKean and a superlative Coe. Although disappointed by his 800 m defeat Cram bounced back to beat Coe to the gold medal in the 1,500 m. It turned out to be not only Cram&#x27;s last major medal, but the end of the golden era for British middle distance running.

In 1987, he was no longer the outstanding 1,500 m athlete that he had been in previous years. Having previously been able to win races from any position and at any pace, he was now lacking confidence in his finishing speed, an area in which he had fallen behind some of his main rivals. He was beaten by José Luis González in the European Cup, and although he followed that with an impressive win in the 1,000 m in Stockholm, and won the Dream Mile for the third year running, he finished eighth after leading into the final bend of the 1987 World Championships final in Rome. He had said before the race that his only hope of victory was a fast race, in which he could run the finish out of his opponents, in particular Abdi Bile, the eventual winner. Unhappily for Cram, the pace was slow, and he faded badly in the last 100 metres.

His 1988 season saw him return to better form and he beat Bile in the Oslo Dream Mile in 1988 - his fourth consecutive victory in that race. Having run impressively in the Olympic trials over 800 m and winning in 1:44.16, (opening up an eight-metre gap over Tom McKean in a sprint down the home straight) he was touted as one of the favourites to win the gold medal over 1,500 m at the Seoul Olympics in 1988 until a calf injury just before the games in a 1000 m race hampered his progress. The injury affected his performance at the games and he was eliminated in the heats of the 800 m. He recovered sufficiently to reach the final of the 1,500 m, but could finish only fourth in a close race surprisingly won by Peter Rono.

Injury dogged him throughout his remaining years and although he continued to compete for some time, he never again looked likely to win a major championship. In the 1990 European Athletics Championships, he still finished fifth in the 1,500 m, but in the 1991 World Athletics Championships, he was eliminated in the 1,500 m semi-finals.

He retired from athletics in 1994, and remains the UK record holder over the 2,000 m, with his UK mile record of 3:46.32 having been broken by Josh Kerr in 2024, in a time of 3:45.34.

Cram was the coach of middle-distance runners Laura Weightman, Thomas Lancashire and Ross Murray. In April 2014 Cram joined British Athletics as an adviser and mentor in the run-up to the 2016 Summer Olympics.

==Television career==
Cram now works as a television presenter and athletics commentator predominantly for BBC Sport and as a motivational speaker. He participated in Prince Edward&#x27;s 1987 charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot;. Cram starred alongside UK Olympic Gold medalists Sally Gunnell and Adam Eason in BBC&#x27;s 2006 primetime TV series &quot;Run for Glory&quot;, helping the runners and participants overcome psychological barriers to running the London Marathon. He was the BBC&#x27;s lead commentator for the Athletic events at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Cram has also presented as part of four Winter Olympics -
Vancouver 2010, Sochi 2014, Pyeongchang 2018 and Beijing 2022 - having replaced Dougie Donnelly as the main Curling commentator in 2010.

==Personal life==
Cram&#x27;s mother Marie was born in Germany and he considered representing Germany because of the dominance of Coe and Ovett. Cram was married to Karen for many years, but they divorced in 2006 and since then he has lived with former athlete Allison Curbishley in Northumberland. He has two children, Josie and Marcus, who have had some success in under-age races. Cram had one sibling, a younger brother Kevin, who died in a fall aged 39 while out for a run in Cardiff in 2001.

In August 2014, Cram was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

He is a supporter of Sunderland A.F.C.

==Awards==
Cram was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1983. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1986 and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to sport.

<doc id="412054" wikidata="Q188502" url="?curid=412054" title="Sebastian Coe">
<text>Sebastian Newbold Coe, Baron Coe, (born 29 September 1956), often referred to as Seb Coe, is a British sports administrator, former politician and retired track and field athlete. As a middle-distance runner, Coe won four Olympic medals, including 1500 metres gold medals at the Olympic Games in 1980 and 1984. He set nine outdoor and three indoor world records in middle-distance track events – including, in 1979, setting three world records in the space of 41 days – and the world record he set in the 800 metres in 1981 remained unbroken until 1997. Coe&#x27;s rivalries with fellow Britons Steve Ovett and Steve Cram dominated middle-distance racing for much of the 1980s.

Following Coe&#x27;s retirement from athletics, he was a Conservative member of parliament from 1992 to 1997 for Falmouth and Camborne in Cornwall, and became a Life Peer on 16 May 2000.

Coe headed the successful London 2012 Olympic bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics and became chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. In 2007, he was elected a vice-president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), and re-elected for another four-year term in 2011. In August 2015, he was elected president of the IAAF.

In 2012, Coe was appointed Pro-Chancellor of Loughborough University where he had been an undergraduate. Subsequently, in 2017, he was appointed as Chancellor. He is also a member of Loughborough University&#x27;s governing body. He was one of 24 athletes inducted as inaugural members of the IAAF Hall of Fame. In November 2012, he was appointed chairman of the British Olympic Association. Coe was presented with the Lifetime Achievement award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in December 2012.

At the 2024 Millrose Games, Coe was awarded The Armory&#x27;s Presidents Award.

==Early life and education==
Coe was born on 29 September 1956 at Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital, Hammersmith, London. His father was athletics coach Peter Coe and his mother, Tina Angela Lal, was of half Indian descent, born to a Punjabi father, Sardari Lal Malhotra, and an English/Irish mother, Vera (née Swan).

When he was less than a year old, Coe and his family moved to Warwickshire, where he later attended Bridgetown Primary School and Hugh Clopton Secondary School in Stratford-upon-Avon. The family then moved to Sheffield where he attended Tapton School, a secondary modern school, at Crosspool which became a comprehensive school while he was there and Abbeydale Grange School. He joined Hallamshire Harriers at the age of 12, and soon became a middle-distance specialist, having been inspired by David Jackson, a geography teacher at Tapton School who had been a cross-country runner. Coe was coached by his own father and represented Loughborough University and later Haringey AC, now Enfield and Haringey Athletic Club when not competing for his country.

Coe studied Economics and Social History at Loughborough University and won his first major race in 1977—an 800 metres event at the European indoor championships in San Sebastián, Spain. At Loughborough University he met an athletics coach, George Gandy, who developed &quot;revolutionary&quot; conditioning exercises to improve Coe&#x27;s running.

His mother, Tina Angela Lal, died in London, in 2005, aged 75. His father, Peter Coe, died on 9 August 2008, aged 88, while Coe was visiting Beijing.

==Athletics career==
 Coe first caught the public&#x27;s attention on 14 March 1977 when he competed in the 800m at the European Indoor Championships in San Sebastián, front-running the entire race and winning in 1:46.54, just short of the world indoor record. He ran in the Emsley Carr mile on 29 August 1977, outsprinting Filbert Bayi of Tanzania in the home straight and winning in 3:57.7. Eleven days later, on 9 September 1977, he ran the 800m at the Coca-Cola Games at Crystal Palace in a time of 1:44.95, beating Andy Carter&#x27;s 1:45.12 to claim his first UK national outdoor record.

Coe&#x27;s 1978 season continued to show his progression in the middle distances, though he raced only sparingly, as in early June he had suffered a serious ankle injury whilst out on a training run. On 18 August 1978, he ran the 800m at the Ivo Van Damme Memorial meeting in Brussels, where he far outclassed the field and stormed home in a time of 1:44.25, another UK national record.

He first ran against his great rival Steve Ovett in a schools cross country race in 1972. Neither won, nor did either win in their first major encounter, on 31 August 1978, in the 800m at the European Championships in Prague. Ovett took second, breaking Coe&#x27;s UK record with a time of 1:44.09, and Coe finished third; the race was won by the East German Olaf Beyer. According to Pat Butcher, Coe&#x27;s father and coach Peter Coe had encouraged him to run as fast as he could from the start. The early pace was indeed exceptionally fast: Coe ran 200m in 24.3, 400m in 49.32, and 600m in 1:16.2; he then slowed and finished third in 1:44.76. A few weeks later, Coe reclaimed the UK record at Crystal Palace, setting an all-comers&#x27; mark of 1:43.97 which ranked him second in the world that year. On 1 October 1978, Coe displayed to the world for the first time his phenomenal natural endurance by winning the Loughrea 4-Mile road race in Ireland in 17:54, defeating the likes of Eamonn Coghlan (who would win the 5000m at the 1983 World Championships) and Mike McLeod (who would be the 1984 Olympic 10,000m silver medalist), and breaking Brendan Foster&#x27;s course record of 18:05. All this off a season which had been focussed on 800m, with only one race at 1500m or the mile. This was a warning to the world&#x27;s top milers of what was to happen the following summer.

The next year, 1979, Coe set three world records in 41 days. He set the first two in Oslo, Norway, at 800m (1:42.33) and the mile (3:48.95), then broke the world 1500m record with his 3:32.03 in Zurich, Switzerland, becoming the first person to hold these three records at the same time. He easily won the 800m at the European Cup in Turin in August, covering the last 200m in 24.1, and anchored the British 4 × 400m relay team with the quartet&#x27;s fastest split, 45.5. He was voted Athlete of the Year by &quot;Athletics Weekly&quot; and &quot;Track and Field News&quot; and was ranked number one in the world at 800m and 1500m; no other athlete since has ranked number one at these distances in the same year.

In 1980, Coe broke Rick Wohlhuter&#x27;s world record for 1000m with a time of 2:13.40. He held all four middle-distance world records—the 800m, 1000m, 1500m, and mile—simultaneously (another unique feat) for one hour until Ovett broke his mile record. In the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, Ovett and Coe each won the other&#x27;s speciality: Ovett the 800m and Coe the 1500m. Coe took second in the 800m after running what he described as &quot;the worst tactical race of my life&quot;, while Ovett took third in the 1500. It was Ovett&#x27;s first defeat at one mile or 1500m in three years and 45 races. Coe covered the last 400m in 52.2 and the last 100m in 12.1 seconds, the fastest-ever finish in a championship final at this distance.

Coe began 1981 with an indoor world record of 1:46.0 for 800m at Cosford in February. On 10 June, he set a world 800m record in Florence; his 1:41.73 remained unbeaten until August 1997. As of 2024, his time still stands as the UK record and puts him in a tie with Nijel Amos for the eighth fastest man ever at the distance (Only bettered by David Rudisha, Wilson Kipketer, Djamel Sedjati, Emmanuel Wanyonyi, Marco Arop, Gabriel Tual, and Bryce Hoppel). A month afterwards he set another world record with 2:12.18 for 1000m, which was to last 19 years and to this day (2024) has only been bettered once. At this time, Coe was more than 1.7 seconds (about 14m) faster than anyone in history at both distances. Between these two record-breaking runs he won the Europa Cup 800m semifinal, running the last 100m in 11.3 (the fastest final 100m ever recorded in a major international race), and achieved a personal best of 3:31.95 at 1500m, despite dreadful pacemaking (he went through 400m in 52.4 and 800m in 1:49.1, the fastest start ever in an international 1500m race at the time) by US 800m runner James Robinson, who passed 400m in 51.5. In August, Coe won the gold medal over 800m at the European Cup final with a blistering last 200m in 24.6 and last 100m in 11.9. He then bettered the standard for the mile twice, first with 3:48.53 in Zürich and then with 3:47.33 in Brussels, on either side of Ovett&#x27;s world record in Koblenz (3:48.40). His 3:47.33 remained on the all-time top-10 list until 31 May 2014.

Coe ended the season with gold over 800m at the World Cup in Rome in September with 1:46.16 (and a 12.0 last 100m), and remained undefeated at both 1500m/mile and 800m for the entire season, as he had in 1979. &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; and &quot;Athletics Weekly&quot; magazines voted Coe Athlete of the Year, an honour he had also won in 1979. Although he had a short season in 1982 because of injuries in June and July, Coe still managed to rank number one in the world in the 800m and to participate in a world-record 4 x 800m relay. Coe, Peter Elliott, Garry Cook and Steve Cram ran a time of 7:03.89, which would remain the world record for 24 years. Coe&#x27;s leg was the fastest of the day, a solo 1:44.01. Heavily favoured for the 800m at the 1982 European Championships in Athletics in Athens, he unexpectedly finished second; the next day British team doctors revealed that he had been suffering from glandular fever. Coe decided to withdraw from the 1500 metres in those championships.

Coe began 1983 with world indoor records at 800m in Cosford, England (1:44.91, breaking his own 1:46.0 from 1981) and 1000m (2:18.58) in Oslo, but he spent much of that year battling health problems, including a prolonged bout with toxoplasmosis. He missed the inaugural IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The disease was severe, and he spent several months in and out of hospital. He returned to competition in 1984 and was selected at 800m and 1500m for the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, despite having been narrowly beaten by Peter Elliott in the AAA Championships. In the 800m he took silver behind Joaquim Cruz of Brazil, but in the 1500m final—his seventh race in nine days—he took the gold in an Olympic record of 3:32.53. He ran the last 800m of the race in 1:49.8, the last lap in 53.2, and the last 100m in 12.7. He remains the only man to win successive Olympic 1500m titles.

Coe had planned to have a somewhat quiet season in 1985, partly because of the intensity of the previous year&#x27;s efforts to get himself ready in time for the Olympics, as well as a planned move up to 5000m, which never materialised. He suffered a recurrence of a back problem which had plagued him on and off since 1980; this caused him to miss several weeks of midseason training. He nevertheless managed to run some fast times towards the end of the season, but he lost his mile world record to Cram, who beat him in Oslo. In 1986, Coe won the 800m gold medal at the European Championships in Stuttgart, beating Tom McKean and Cram with a stunning last 200m of 24.8 and 100m of 12.4. It was his only 800m title at an international championship. He took the silver in the 1500m behind Cram, the mile world record holder proving too strong in the homestretch. He then ran his personal best over 1500m with a 3:29.77 performance in Rieti, Italy, becoming the fourth man in history to break 3:30 at the distance. For the fourth year in his career (1979, 1981, 1982 &amp; 1986), he was ranked No. 1 in the world at 800m, and he was in the top two for 1500m for the fifth time.

Coe sustained a foot injury in 1987 after winning an 800m and running a 4 × 400m leg for his club, Haringey, and was out for the entire season. The following year he was not selected for the British 1988 Olympic Games team after he failed to advance from the heats of the 1500m at the Trials in Birmingham. He had shown good early season form, but he picked up a chest infection after a spell of altitude training. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; ran a campaign and the president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, unsuccessfully tried to have the rules changed in Coe&#x27;s favour. It was said that India was willing to include him on its national team on account of his mother&#x27;s Indian heritage.

Coe had a final good season in 1989, when, in his 33rd year (at age 32), he won the AAA 1500m title, was ranked British number one for both 800m and 1500m, ran the world&#x27;s second-fastest 800m of the year (1:43.38), and took the silver medal at the World Cup over 1500m. He retired from competitive athletics in early 1990, after having to bow out of the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand with yet another chest infection. He ended his career having run sub-1:44 for 800m in eight different years.

==Trinity College&#x27;s Great Court Run==
A scene in the 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; recreates a race in which competitors attempt to run round the perimeter of the Great Court at Trinity College, Cambridge in the time it takes the clock to double-strike the hour at midday or midnight. Many have tried to run the around the court in the 43.6 seconds that it takes to strike 12 o&#x27;clock. Known as the Great Court Run, students traditionally attempt to complete the circuit on the evening of the matriculation dinner. The only persons recognised to have actually completed the run in time are David Cecil in 1927 and Sam Dobin in 2007. It was thought that Coe had succeeded when he beat Steve Cram in a charity race in October 1988 in a time of 42.53 seconds. A video of the race, however, apparently shows that Coe was 12 metres short of the finish line when the last chime sounded, so Trinity College never officially accepted his time.

==Political career==
Coe was elected as Member of Parliament for Falmouth and Camborne in 1992, for the Conservative Party, but lost his seat in the 1997 general election. He returned to politics for a short time as Leader of the Opposition William Hague&#x27;s chief of staff, having accepted the offer of a Life Peerage on 16 May 2000.

==Sports administration career==

===London 2012 Olympic Games===
When London announced its bid to hold the 2012 Olympics, Coe became an ambassador for the effort and a member of the board of the bid company. With the May 2004 resignation of chairman Barbara Cassani, Coe became the chairman for the latter phase of the bid. As Coe was a well-known personality in Olympic sport, it was felt he was better suited to the diplomatic finesse needed to secure the IOC&#x27;s backing. Coe&#x27;s presentation at the critical IOC meeting in July 2005 was viewed by commentators as being particularly effective, against tough competition from Paris and Madrid, and the London bid won the IOC&#x27;s blessing on 6 July.

Coe attended the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver to see how the city coped with the challenges of hosting. Lord Coe noted the Games had &quot;gradually recovered from its tumultuous start&quot; and queried that he &quot;never thought the British would find rivals in their preoccupation with the weather which is almost elevated to an Olympic event&quot; as he credited VANOC for meeting unforeseen challenges such as the unseasonably warm weather of Cypress Mountain. Coe added &quot;Rarely have I seen a host city so passionate and so ready to embrace the Games&quot;.

Coe was instrumental in asking Queen Elizabeth II to star in &quot;Happy and Glorious&quot;, a short film featuring James Bond, which formed part of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. The director of the ceremony, Danny Boyle first pitched the idea to Coe, who loved it so much that he took it to Edward Young, Deputy Private Secretary to the Queen. A friend of Coe&#x27;s from their days of advising William Hague, Young &quot;listened sagely, laughed, and promised to ask the Boss&quot;. Coe was subsequently informed that she would love to take part.

===FIFA===
Coe was appointed the first chairman of FIFA&#x27;s independent watchdog, the FIFA Ethics Committee. The commission will judge all cases alleging conflicts of interest and breaches of FIFA rules. FIFA president Sepp Blatter made the announcement in Zurich on 15 September 2006 and said: &quot;It is perhaps a surprise but it has been very well received. We have found an outstanding personality in the world of sport, a great personality in the Olympic movement.&quot; His appointment makes him one of the most senior Englishmen to work for FIFA.

He stood down from this post to join the English committee that failed to bring the 2018 World Cup to England, with Russia chosen to host instead.

===International Association of Athletics Federations===
In 2007 Coe was appointed as vice President of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and was reappointed in 2011. When Lamine Diack president of the IAAF announced that he was standing down in 2013 seemed likely to announce Coe as his successor as there had never been an election for the President position. Coe, in November 2014 announced that he would stand for election for this position in 2015. In December 2014, Coe unveiled his manifesto, &#x27;Growing Athletics in a New Age.&#x27; On 19 August 2015, in Beijing, he was elected president of IAAF against Sergey Bubka, by 115 votes to 92 votes. On 17 August 2023, in Budapest, he was re-elected unopposed for a third and final term of office as President. 

In 2015 Lord Coe&#x27;s presidency of IAAF created turmoil when major sponsor Adidas terminated a multimillion sponsorship deal four years early.

===British Olympic Association===
Following the London Olympics, Coe was appointed as Chairman of the British Olympic Association, replacing Lord Moynihan.
===Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games===
Coe has been appointed a member of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games Coordination Commission representing the Association of National Olympic Committees.

===International Olympic Committee===
On 17 July 2020, Coe was elected a member of the International Olympic Committee. In September 2024, he was announced as one of seven candidates in the running to succeed Thomas Bach as IOC president.

===Other sports===
As of 2007, Coe was Patron of the British Dragon Boat Racing Association.

==Russian doping scandal==
The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee in 2015 accused Coe of misleading the committee. He was also accused of blocking the release of a report from the University of Tübingen that mentioned the extent of doping.

==Personal life==
After graduating in 1980, and a few months after his exploits on the track in the 1980–81 seasons, Coe got a job as a research assistant at the Loughborough University of Technology in the department of Physical Education and Sports Science. At this time he shared a semi-detached home with his close friend Steve Mitchell.

In 1990, when resident in Surrey, Coe married Nicky McIrvine, a former Badminton three-day-event champion, with whom he has two sons and two daughters. The marriage ended in divorce in 2002 after twelve years.

In 2003, Coe began a relationship with Carole Annett; the couple wed in 2011. She is the daughter of former England cricket captain M. J. K. Smith.

Coe is a worldwide ambassador for Nike and owns a string of health clubs with a membership of more than 20,000. He is a member of the East India Club, a private gentlemen&#x27;s club in St James&#x27;s Square. He has supported London athletic events such as the London 10K of Nike and the British 10K charity race. On 12 February 2010, Coe was the 19th runner on the 106th day of the Vancouver Olympic Torch Relay. Coe&#x27;s leg was along the Stanley Park Seawall.

In October 2012, Coe was appointed chairman of Chime Communications sports marketing subsidiary, CSM Sport and Entertainment. The company also entered into an &#x27;option agreement&#x27; to buy Coe&#x27;s 93% interest in CLG, the firm which acts as a vehicle for his earnings from speeches and appearances.

Coe is a supporter of Chelsea Football Club. He is also a fan of cricket and jazz, in particular Billie Holiday and Lester Young.

Coe was featured in an episode of the BBC TV series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, which showed that he is descended from John Astley, the portrait painter, Jamaican sugar farmers and slave owners, George Clarke, Lieutenant Governor of New York Colony, and Edward Hyde of Norbury.

Coe retired from the House of Lords on 31 January 2022.

He is a columnist for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

Coe is colour blind.

==Honours==
Coe was made an Honorary Doctor of Technology (Hon DTech) by his alma mater, Loughborough University in 1985. In November 2009, he was awarded an honorary degree as Doctor of Science (Hon DSc) from the University of East London. In 2009, he also was awarded an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He also received an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Sunderland in 2011.

He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1982 New Year Honours and Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1990 New Year Honours. On 16 May 2000, he was created a Life Peer as Baron Coe, &quot;of Ranmore in the County of Surrey&quot;. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 2006 New Year Honours for services to sport. In the 2013 New Year Honours, Coe was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) for services to the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. He represented the Order at the 2023 Coronation.

He was presented with the first Prince of Asturias Award (Sports category) in 1987. After his work in delivering London 2012 Coe was presented with an Olympic Order. Coe received another lifetime achievement award at the Laureus World Sport Awards.

Coe has also received three separate awards at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony: The main individual award in 1979, a &quot;Special Gold Award&quot; in 2005 and the &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; in 2012.

A building at the Nike world headquarters in Beaverton Oregon was named after Sebastian Coe in 2017. Coe is a longtime Nike athlete and was recognised by Nike as a great middle-distance runner. The &#x27;Nike Sebastian Coe building&#x27; was designed to emphasise connectivity.

Coe was included in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;&#x27; &quot;100 Makers of the 21st Century&quot; list. In 2018 he was recognised as a Tourism Australia&#x27;s Friend of Australia, in conjunction with the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. In addition in 2018 Coe was awarded an OLY post nominal title from World Olympians Association.

At the 2024 Millrose Games, Coe was the recipient of The Armory&#x27;s Presidents Award.

<doc id="412057" wikidata="Q549114" url="?curid=412057" title="Steve Backley">
<text>Stephen James Backley, OBE (born 12 February 1969) is an English retired track and field athlete who competed in the javelin throw. He formerly held the world record, and his throw from 1992 is the British record. During his career, he was a firm fixture in the British national athletics team. He won four gold medals at the European Championships, three Commonwealth Games gold medals, two silvers and a bronze at the Olympic Games, and two silvers at the World Championships. Currently, he is an occasional commentator for athletics competitions, especially the field events.

==Career==
===Early life===
Backley was educated at Hurst Primary School, Bexley, and later at Bexley and Erith Technical High School for Boys (now Beths Grammar School) in his teens. He was a member of the South East London-based Cambridge Harriers Athletics club, and competed for Bexley in the London Youth Games. He enrolled at Loughborough University in October 1988 to study for a BSc Honours degree in physical education, sports science and recreation management. Although he completed his first year there and remained a student until 2002, the time he dedicated to the javelin prevented him from completing his studies. However, on 16 December 2002 Loughborough University honoured him with the degree of Doctor of Technology honoris causa.

Backley&#x27;s first significant title, was won in 1987 when he threw 75.14 metres to pick up the European junior title, ahead of Vladimir Sasimovich (73.24) of Russia and East German Raymond Hecht (72.78). In 1988, Backley won the silver medal at the 1988 World Junior Championships. He also broke the world junior record that year.

===1990–1993: World records===
In July 1990, Backley set a world record of 89.58m in Stockholm, Sweden. The record was then bettered by the Czech thrower Jan Železný a few weeks later, but Backley then regained the record with a throw 90.98m at Crystal Palace, London, to end the year as the world record holder. Finland&#x27;s Seppo Räty then bettered the record in 1991. The records set by Železný and Räty, as well as Backley&#x27;s 90.98m throw, had all been made using new &#x27;Nemeth&#x27; javelins, however in August 1991 the IAAF declared this type of javelin illegal and all records set using them were retrospectively deleted. As a consequence, the world record reverted to the 89.58m mark that Backley had set in 1990. Backley then set another world record of 91.46m in January 1992 in New Zealand, a record which stood until 1993, when it was bettered by Železný.

===2000 Olympics and 2001 World championships===
Backley started the year recovering from knee surgery throwing 82.19m against the U.S. in Glasgow, Scotland. The injury forced him to withdraw from the European Cup Super League meeting in Gateshead, England in early July. Due to injury his second competition came in August, taking second (85.84m) to Finlands Aki Parviainen in the Norwich Union Grand Prix and improved to 86.70m in winning the AAA Championship.

At Sydney, Australia for the 2000 Summer Olympics he beat the qualifying mark with his very first throw (83.74m), although the favourite, Jan Železný, threw an enormous qualifying throw of 89.39m. In the final, Backley set a new Olympic record with his second throw of 89.95m, but in the third round two-time champion Železný threw a distance of 90.17m. Subsequent rounds did not see improvements from either competitor and again Železný won the gold medal ahead of Backley. Sergey Makarov took bronze.

With the 2001 World Championships in Athletics to look forward to, he threw over ninety metres for the first time since 1992 at the British Grand Prix at Crystal Palace on 22 July. He had trailed behind Latvian Ēriks Rags (86.47) and American Breaux Greer (85.91) who had both produced personal bests before he pulled out a huge 90.81 with his final throw.

This should have given him an enormous for boost for the worlds in Edmonton, but on 10 August Backley had not taken his A-game to the show. He could only manage 81.50 in the qualifying rounds and when both pools had finished this left him way down in thirteenth place. One consolation was that his teammate Mick Hill had qualified well, but even this good news was short lived as Mick unfortunately picked up an injury and only managed to record one distance in the final, finishing last.

Jan Železný took gold with a championship record of 92.80 ahead of Aki Parviainen (91.31) and Konstadinós Gatsioúdis of Greece (89.95). American, Breaux Greer once again increased his personal best to 87.00 in finishing one place outside the medals.

Such was his disgust at his performance he had been contemplating retirement but re-appeared in Gateshead, for the Norwich Union Classic and gained a little revenge by beating world silver medallist Aki Parviainen with a throw of 86.74. Of his six throws this day five of them would have qualified for final nine days earlier.

Backley then travelled to Brisbane in September to take part in the Goodwill Games but despite leading after two rounds, the up and down season continued and he could not improve to leave Jan Železný on top once again ahead of Ēriks Rags and Breaux Greer.

===2002 Commonwealth and European champion===
It was going to be a busy with two major back-to-back competitions, the Commonwealth Games on 25 July – 4 August and the European Championships on 6–11 August .

On 31 July was the first test and with no major competition he knew that he had reclaimed his Commonwealth title after his very first throw of 86.81 in the City of Manchester Stadium. Runner up Scott Russell of Canada was nearly eight metres back with (78.98) and England&#x27;s bronze medallist Nick Nieland managed only 78.63. This gave Backley a hat-trick of Commonwealth titles.

The European Championships in Munich would be much stiffer task with all of the World&#x27;s leading exponents on show. Producing an opening throw of 86.29 and then surpassing that marginally in the third with 86.37 it was obvious that he was in form but he still trailed behind Russian leader Sergey Makarov who had sent out a massive 88.05 first round throw.

World record holder Jan Železný again found the European title beyond him and did not manage to record a distance so was eliminated after the third round. This seemed to inspire Backley and the reigning champion went half a metre past the leader in the fifth with 88.54. Makarov couldn&#x27;t respond to this and ended up with silver with Germany&#x27;s Boris Henry taking bronze with 85.33. This fantastic achievement made Backley the first British athlete to win four consecutive European Championship golds.

===Closing career===
Backley began the year having problems with a knee injury, but with an early season win in Sweden under his belt, and another victory on 13 July at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Gateshead, throwing 85.69 to defeat Boris Henry (83.52) and Alexandr Ivanov (81.69), he put injury firmly behind him.

A couple of weeks later at the North Down International at Bangor Northern Ireland his opening throw of 81.42m was once again good enough to see off the competition.

It was therefore disappointing when after managing to qualify for the final, only in seventh position, at the IAAF championship Stade de France, Paris, on the final weekend of August, his third and best throw of only 80.13m could not take him through to the last eight in the Sunday final. Sergey Makarov took the title with 85.44 ahead of Andrus Värnik 85.17 and Boris Henry 84.74 with these all being recorded in the first round.

In Backley&#x27;s final year of competition in 2004, where he was hoping to add to his Olympic medal haul, he struggled to find form and at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, in a wide-open field, he only made the final as the last non-automatic qualifier. In the final his third round throw of 84.13 metres pulled him up to fourth place but he could not improve on this and finished in that position unable to gain a medal at his fourth consecutive games.

==Personal best==
Backley&#x27;s personal best was 91.46 metres achieved on 25 January 1992 at North Shore City, New Zealand. That throw still stands as the British record in men&#x27;s javelin.

==Life outside athletics==
Backley was awarded the MBE in the 1995 New Year&#x27;s Honours list, and then an OBE in 2003. He was inducted into the London Youth Games Hall of Fame in 2009. Backley was on a special Olympic medal winners&#x27; version of &quot;Jungle Run&quot;, in which he, Mark Foster, and Iwan Thomas collected the most monkey statues.

Backley competed in the 2008 edition of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; with partner Susie Lipanova. He survived three consecutive skate-offs against Samantha Mumba, Aggie MacKenzie and Tim Vincent. However, Backley ended up in the skate-off for the fourth time in a row, where he lost out to Zaraah Abrahams and her partner Fred Palascak after the judges chose to save her. Backley finished 7th. In 2012 he joined the BBC athletics commentary team for the London Olympic Games, and has commentated at various events for them since. He is the main commentator for field events.

In August 2014, Backley was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s independence referendum.

<doc id="412059" wikidata="Q155928" url="?curid=412059" title="Avery Brundage">
<text>Avery Brundage (; September 28, 1887 – May 8, 1975) was the fifth president of the International Olympic Committee, serving from 1952 to 1972, the only American and only non-European to attain that position. Brundage is remembered as a zealous advocate of amateurism and for his involvement with the 1936 and 1972 Summer Olympics, both held in Germany.

Brundage was born in Detroit in 1887 to a working-class family. When he was five years old, his father moved his family to Chicago and subsequently abandoned his wife and children. Raised mostly by relatives, Brundage attended the University of Illinois to study engineering and became a track star. He competed in the 1912 Summer Olympics, where he participated in the pentathlon and decathlon, but did not win any medals; both events were won by teammate Jim Thorpe. He won national championships in track three times between 1914 and 1918 and founded his own construction business. He earned his wealth from this company and from investments, and never accepted pay for his involvement in sports.

Following his retirement from athletics, Brundage became a sports administrator and rose rapidly through the ranks in United States sports groups. As leader of America&#x27;s Olympic organizations, he fought zealously against a boycott of the 1936 Summer Olympics, which had been awarded to Germany before the rise of the Nazi regime and its escalating persecution of Jews. Brundage successfully prevented a US boycott of the Games, and he was elected to the IOC that year. He quickly became a major figure in the Olympic movement and was elected IOC president in 1952.

As President of the American Olympic Committee, Brundage fought strongly for amateurism and against the commercialization of the Olympic Games, even as these stands increasingly came to be seen as incongruous with the realities of modern sports. The advent of the state-sponsored athlete of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The 1972 Summer Olympics at Munich, West Germany, were his final Games as president of the IOC. The event was marred by tragedy and controversy when eleven Israeli team members were murdered by Palestinian terrorists. At the memorial service, Brundage decried the politicization of sports and refused to cancel the remainder of the Olympics, declaring &quot;the Games must go on.&quot; Although those in attendance applauded Brundage&#x27;s statement, his decision to continue the Games has since been harshly criticized, and his actions in 1936 and 1972 seen as evidence of antisemitism. In retirement, Brundage married his second wife, a German princess. He died in 1975 at age 87.

==Early life and athletic career==
Avery Brundage was born in Detroit, Michigan, on September 28, 1887, the son of Charles and Minnie (Lloyd) Brundage. Charles Brundage was a stonecutter. The Brundages moved to Chicago when Avery was five, and Charles soon thereafter abandoned his family. Avery and his younger brother, Chester, were raised mostly by aunts and uncles. At age 13 in 1901, Brundage finished first in an essay competition, winning a trip to President William McKinley&#x27;s second inauguration. Avery attended Sherwood Public School and then R. T. Crane Manual Training School, both in Chicago. Crane Tech was a journey of by public transportation, which he undertook only after completing a newspaper delivery route. Even though the school had no athletic facilities, Brundage made his own equipment (including a shot and a hammer to throw) in the school&#x27;s workshop and by his final year was written of in the newspapers as a schoolboy track star. According to sportswriter William Oscar Johnson in a 1980 article in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Brundage was &quot;the kind of man whom Horatio Alger had canonized—the American urchin, tattered and deprived, who rose to thrive in the company of kings and millionaires&quot;.

After he graduated from Crane Tech in 1905, Brundage enrolled at the University of Illinois, where he undertook an arduous schedule of civil engineering courses. He received an honors degree in 1909. He wrote for various campus publications and continued his involvement in sports. Brundage played basketball and ran track for Illinois, and also participated in several intramural sports. In his senior year, he was a major contributor to Illinois&#x27; Western Conference championship track team, which defeated the University of Chicago (coached by Amos Alonzo Stagg).

After graduation, Brundage began work as a construction superintendent for the leading architectural firm of Holabird &amp; Roche. In the three years he worked for the firm, he supervised the construction of $7.5 million in buildings—3 percent of the total built in Chicago in that time frame. He disliked the corruption of the Chicago building trades. Brundage&#x27;s biographer, Allen Guttmann, points out that the young engineer was in a position to benefit from influence if he had wanted to, as his uncle, Edward J. Brundage, was by then-Republican leader of Chicago&#x27;s North Side and would become Attorney General of Illinois.

Brundage had been successful in several track and field events while at Illinois. In 1910, as a member of the Chicago Athletic Association (CAA), he finished third in the national all-around championships (an American predecessor of the decathlon), sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and continued training, aiming at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm. At Stockholm, Brundage finished sixth in the pentathlon and 16th in the decathlon. Far behind on points, after eight events he dropped out of the decathlon, which he always regretted. He later moved up one spot in the standings in each event when his fellow American, Jim Thorpe, who had won both events, was disqualified after it was shown that he had played semi-professional baseball: this meant Thorpe was considered a professional athlete, not an amateur as was required for Olympic participation. Throughout his tenure as president, Brundage refused to ask the IOC to restore Thorpe&#x27;s medals despite advocacy by Thorpe supporters. The committee eventually did so in 1982, after the deaths of both men. Brundage&#x27;s refusal led to charges that he held a grudge for being beaten in Stockholm.

Upon his return to Chicago, Brundage accepted a position as construction superintendent for John Griffith and Sons Contractors. Among the structures he worked on for Griffith were the Cook County Hospital, the Morrison Hotel, the Monroe Building, and the National Biscuit Company warehouse. In 1915, he struck out on his own in construction, founding the Avery Brundage Company, of which his uncle Edward was a director. Brundage continued his athletic career as well. He was US all-around champion in 1914, 1916, and 1918. Once he had ceased to be a track star, he took up handball. As a young man, he was ranked in the top ten in the country and even in 1934, at the age of 46, he won one game out of two against Angelo Trulio, who had recently been the US national champion.

==Sports administrator==
===Rise to leadership===
As Brundage approached the end of his track career, he began to involve himself in sports administration, at first through the CAA, then through the Central Association of the Amateur Athletic Union (of which the CAA was a member) and then, beginning in 1919, in the AAU. That group was involved in an ongoing battle for dominance over US amateur sports with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Athletes were often used as pawns in the battle, with one organization threatening to suspend those who participated in events sponsored by the other. Another venue for conflict was in the United States&#x27; National Olympic Committee (NOC), which was then called the American Olympic Committee (AOC), and which was AAU-dominated. In 1920, there was public outcry when the AOC chartered a disused troopship to carry home America&#x27;s representatives in the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp; much of the team instead booked passage by ocean liner. In response, the AAU founded an American Olympic Association as a separate group, although it was still initially dominated by AAU representatives—it then selected the AOC. In 1928, on the resignation of then-AOA president General Douglas MacArthur, Brundage was elected president of the AOA; he was also elected president of the AOC, a post he held for over 20 years.

In 1925 Brundage became vice-president of the AAU, and chairman of its Handball Committee. After a year as first vice-president, he became president in 1928 and kept the post (except for a one-year break in 1933) through 1935. In that capacity, he was able to secure peace between the NCAA and AAU, with the former gaining the right to certify college students as amateurs, and greater representation on the AOA&#x27;s executive board.

Brundage quickly displayed what writer Roger Butterfield termed &quot;a dictatorial temperament&quot; in a 1948 article for &quot;Life&quot; magazine. In 1929, American track star Charlie Paddock stated that Brundage and other sports officials were making money for the AOC by using him as a gate attraction, while treating him badly; Brundage shot back accusing Paddock of &quot;untruths&quot; and &quot;sensationalism of the rankest sort&quot;. The runner turned professional, escaping Brundage&#x27;s jurisdiction. In 1932, soon after winning three medals at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, track star Mildred &quot;Babe&quot; Didrikson appeared in an automobile advertisement, and the Brundage-led AAU quickly suspended her amateur status. Didrikson objected that she had not been paid and that regardless, the rules for maintaining amateur status were overcomplex. In the first of several well-publicized run-ins he had with female athletes, Brundage replied that he had not had any problem with the rules when an Olympic athlete himself, and stated, &quot;You know, the ancient Greeks kept women out of their athletic games. They wouldn&#x27;t even let them on the sidelines. I&#x27;m not so sure but they were right.&quot; According to Butterfield, Brundage was suspicious of female athletes, suspecting that some were actually men in disguise.

=== 1936 Olympics ===
====Fighting a boycott====
In 1931, the IOC awarded the 1936 Olympics to Germany, with the winter games in Bavaria and the summer games in the capital city, Berlin. After Germany was selected, several IOC members indicated that they were showing support for its democratic government, which was under attack from extremists in the hard economic times of the Great Depression. The Berlin Games were thrown in doubt, however, by the German July 1932 elections, in which the Nazi Party, led by Adolf Hitler, unexpectedly won the most seats in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, the national legislature. The Nazis had expressed little interest in international sport, instead preferring the idea of &quot;German games,&quot; in which German athletes would compete without what they deemed subhuman &quot;Untermenschen&quot; such as people of Jewish, Gypsy or African descent, thereby promoting their ideas of Aryan racial superiority and Germans as a &quot;master race.&quot; When the Nazis attained power in January 1933, the Olympics were thought likely to be moved elsewhere.

Although the Nazis were suspicious of the chairman of the local Olympic organizing committee, Theodor Lewald, because he had a Jewish grandmother, they quickly saw the propaganda potential in hosting the Olympic Games. Lewald had intended to stage the Games on a shoestring budget; instead, the &quot;Reich&quot; threw its resources behind the effort. As the Nazi hatred of the Jews manifested itself in persecution, there were calls to move the Olympics from Germany, or alternatively, to boycott the Games. As head of the US Olympic movement, Brundage received many letters and telegrams urging action. American Olympic champion Lillian Copeland accused Brundage of &quot;deliberately concealing the truth&quot; about Hitler and Nazi Germany, was one of 24 former U.S. Olympic champions who petitioned the IOC in 1933 to move the Games from Germany, to no avail, and herself ultimately boycotted the Games.

IOC President Comte Henri de Baillet-Latour wrote to Brundage in 1933, &quot;I am not personally fond of jews and of the jewish influence, but I will not have them molested in no way whatsoever.&quot; According to historical writer Christopher Hilton in his account of the 1936 Games, &quot;Baillet-Latour, and the great and good around him, had no idea what was coming, and if the [IOC&#x27;s] German delegates kept offering assurances, what else could they do but accept them?&quot; Baillet-Latour opposed boycotting the Games, as did Brundage (who had learned in 1933 that he was being considered for IOC membership).

In her 1982 journal article on his role in the US participation in the 1936 Summer Games, Carolyn Marvin explained Brundage&#x27;s political outlook:

Nazi pledges of non-discrimination in sports proved inconsistent with their actions, such as the expulsion of Jews from sports clubs, and in September 1934, Brundage sailed for Germany to see for himself. He met with government officials and others, although he was not allowed to meet with Jewish sports leaders alone. When he returned, he reported, &quot;I was given positive assurance in writing ... that there will be no discrimination against Jews. You can&#x27;t ask more than that and I think the guarantee will be fulfilled.&quot; Brundage&#x27;s trip only increased the controversy over the question of US participation, with New York Congressman Emanuel Celler stating that Brundage &quot;had prejudged the situation before he sailed from America.&quot; The AOC heard a report from Brundage on conditions in Germany and announced its decision. On September 26, 1934, the Committee voted to send the United States team to Berlin.

Brundage took the position that as the Germans had reported non-discrimination to the IOC, and the IOC had accepted that report, US Olympic authorities were bound by that determination. Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent that Nazi actions would prohibit any Jew from securing a place on the German team. On this issue, Brundage stated that only 12 Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, and it would hardly be surprising if none did in 1936.

Those who had advocated a boycott were foiled by the AOC, and they turned to the Amateur Athletic Union, hoping that the organization, though also led by Brundage, would refuse to certify American athletes for the 1936 Olympics. Although no vote took place on a boycott at the AAU&#x27;s December 1934 meeting, Brundage did not seek re-election, and delegates elected Judge Jeremiah T. Mahoney as the new president, to take office in 1935. Although pro-boycott activities briefly fell into a lull, renewed Nazi brutality against the Jews in June 1935 sparked a resurgence, and converted Mahoney to the pro-boycott cause. In October, Baillet-Latour wrote to the three American IOC members—William May Garland, Charles Sherrill, and Ernest Lee Jahncke—asking them to do all they could to ensure a US team was sent to Germany. Garland and Sherrill agreed; Jahncke, however, refused, stating that he would be supporting the boycott. Brundage, at Baillet-Latour&#x27;s request, took the lead in the anti-boycott campaign. Matters came to a head at the AAU convention in December 1935. Brundage&#x27;s forces won the key votes, and the AAU approved sending a team to Berlin, specifying that this did not mean it supported the Nazis. Brundage was not magnanimous in victory, demanding the resignation of opponents. Although not all quit, Mahoney did.

Brundage believed that the boycott controversy could be used effectively for fundraising, writing, &quot;the fact that the Jews are against us will arouse interest among thousands of people who have never subscribed before, if they are properly approached.&quot; In March 1936, he wrote to advertising mogul Albert Lasker, a Jew, complaining that &quot;a large number of misguided Jews still persist in attempting to hamper the activities of the American Olympic Committee. The result, of course, is increased support from the one hundred and twenty million non-Jews in the United States, for this is a patriotic enterprise.&quot; In a letter which David Large, in his book on the 1936 Games, terms &quot;heavy-handed,&quot; Brundage suggested that by helping to finance American participation in the Olympic Games, Jews could decrease anti-Semitism in the US. However, &quot;Lasker, to his credit, refused to be blackmailed,&quot; writing to Brundage that &quot;You gratuitously insult not only Jews but the millions of patriotic Christians in America, for whom you venture to speak without warrant, and whom you so tragically misrepresent in your letter.&quot;

====Berlin====
Brundage led the contingent of American athletes and officials who embarked for Hamburg on the &quot;S.S. Manhattan&quot; at New York Harbor on July 15, 1936. Immediately upon arrival in Germany, Brundage became headline news when he and the AOC dismissed American swimmer Eleanor Holm, who was a gold medalist in 1932 and expected to repeat, for allegedly getting drunk at late-night parties and missing her curfew. There were various rumors and accounts of the married swimmer&#x27;s pursuits while on board the ship; the gossip included statements that she was at an &quot;all-night party&quot; with playwright Charles MacArthur, who was traveling without his wife, actress Helen Hayes. Brundage discussed the matter with fellow AOC members, then met with Holm. Although the AOC attempted to send her home, Holm pleaded in vain for reinstatement; &quot;to the AOC&#x27;s horror,&quot; she remained in Berlin as a journalist, watching from the stands as the gold medal went to Dutch swimmer Nida Senff. Decades later, Holm told Olympic sprinter Dave Sime that Brundage had held a grudge against her, having propositioned her, and she turned him down. According to Guttmann, &quot;Brundage has appeared, ever since [1936], in the guise of a killjoy.&quot; Butterfield noted that through the efforts of sportswriters who supported Holm, &quot;Brundage became celebrated as a tyrant, snob, hypocrite, dictator and stuffed shirt, as well as just about the meanest man in the whole world of sports.&quot;

On July 30, 1936, six days after the American arrival in Germany, the IOC met in Berlin and unanimously expelled Jahncke. Two places for the United States were vacant, as Sherrill had died in June, but the minutes specifically note that Brundage was elected to the IOC in Jahncke&#x27;s place.

One of the sensations of the Games was black American track star Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals. According to some American press stories, Hitler left the stadium rather than shake hands with him. This was not the case; IOC president Baillet-Latour had told Hitler not to shake hands with the winners unless he was prepared to shake hands with all gold medalists, which he was not. This, however, was not publicized. According to Butterfield, in later years, retellings of what Brundage termed &quot;a fairy tale&quot; roused the American to &quot;acute fury.&quot; Hitler was, however, asked by his youth leader, Baldur von Schirach, to meet Owens, and he refused, saying, &quot;Do you really think that I&#x27;d allow myself to be photographed shaking hands with a Negro?&quot;

The question of the US 4 × 100 meters relay squad was another controversy that may have involved Brundage. The scheduled team included sprinters Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman, who were both Jewish. After Owens won his third gold medal, both men were removed from the relay squad in favor of Owens and fellow black athlete Ralph Metcalfe. The US track coach, Lawson Robertson, told Stoller and Glickman that the Germans had upgraded their squad and it was important to have the fastest team possible. In the event, the US team turned in back-to-back world record times in the heats and final to take the gold medal; the Italians were a distant second, edging out the Germans for the silver medal. Stoller and Glickman, who were the only Jews on the US track team and the only American athletes who went to Berlin and did not compete, did not believe the stated reason for their replacement. Stoller recorded in his diary that he and Glickman had been left out of the relay because the two other participants, Foy Draper and Frank Wykoff, had been coached by one of Robertson&#x27;s assistants at the University of Southern California. Glickman conceded college favoritism as a possible reason, but thought anti-Semitism more likely, and his position—that he and Stoller had been replaced so as not to embarrass Hitler by having him see Jews, as well as blacks, win gold medals for the US track team—hardened in the following years. He believed Brundage was behind the replacement. Brundage denied any involvement in the decision, which remains controversial. Glickman went on to a lengthy career as a sports broadcaster, and was given the inaugural Douglas MacArthur Award (for lifetime achievement in the field of sports) in 1998, after Stoller&#x27;s death, by the United States Olympic Committee (successor to the AOC). USOC chairman William Hybl stated that while he had seen no written proof that Brundage was responsible, &quot;I was a prosecutor. I&#x27;m used to looking at evidence. The evidence was there&quot;—though, as Large notes, &quot;exactly &quot;what&quot; evidence, he didn&#x27;t say.&quot; In the report that he submitted after the Games, Brundage called the controversy &quot;absurd&quot;; he noted that Glickman and Stoller had finished fifth and sixth at the Olympic trials at New York&#x27;s Randall&#x27;s Island Stadium and that the US victory had validated the decision.

===Road to the IOC presidency===
Brundage&#x27;s first IOC session as an incumbent member was at Warsaw in June 1937. The vice president of the IOC, Baron Godefroy de Blonay of Switzerland, had died, and Sweden&#x27;s J. Sigfrid Edström was elected to replace him. Brundage was selected to fill Edström&#x27;s place on the executive board. Edström had been a Brundage ally in the boycott fight, writing to the American that while he did not desire the persecution of the Jews, as an &quot;intelligent and unscrupulous&quot; people, &quot;they had to be kept within certain limits&quot;. Brundage wrote to a German correspondent regretting that Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s film about the Berlin Olympics, &quot;Olympia&quot;, could not be commercially shown in the United States, as &quot;unfortunately the theaters and moving picture companies are almost all owned by Jews&quot;.

The Berlin Games had increased Brundage&#x27;s admiration for Germany, and he spoke out at a speech before the pro-Nazi German-American Bund at Madison Square Garden in October 1936, stating that &quot;five years ago they [Germans] were discouraged and demoralized—today they are united—sixty million people believing in themselves and in their country ... We can learn much from Germany.&quot; In 1938, his construction company received the contract to build a new German embassy in Washington (this was not fulfilled as World War II intervened). Brundage joined the Keep America Out of War Committee and became a member of America First (he resigned from both the day after Pearl Harbor). Brundage was the subject of an FBI investigation in 1942, following allegations of pro-Nazi sympathies.

Although the 1940 Olympic Games were canceled due to World War II, Brundage sought to organize Western Hemisphere games that might be able to proceed despite the troubled international climate. Brundage was one of the leaders in the founding of the Pan-American Games, participating in the initial discussions in August 1940 in Buenos Aires. On his return, he arranged for the American Olympic Association to be renamed the United States of America Sports Federation (USASF), which would organize the United States Olympic Committee (as the AOC would now be called) and another committee to see to American participation in the Pan-American Games. Brundage became an early member of the international Pan-American Games Commission, although the inaugural event in Buenos Aires was postponed because of the war and was eventually held in 1951, with Brundage present. Despite his role in founding them, Brundage viewed the Pan-American Games as imitative, with no true link with antiquity.

War postponed any future Olympics, and fractured the IOC geographically and politically. With Baillet-Latour in German-occupied Belgium, Brundage and IOC vice president Edström did their best to keep channels of communication open between IOC members; according to Guttmann, &quot;He and Edström perceived themselves as keepers of the sacred flame, guardians of an ideal in whose name they were ready once again to act as soon as the madness ended.&quot; Baillet-Latour died in 1942; Edström took on the duties of president, although he continued to style himself vice-president. Edström and Brundage did not await the end of war to rebuild the Olympic movement; Brundage even sent parcels to Europe in aid of IOC members and others in places where food was scarce. With Edström turning 74 in 1944, the Swede expressed concern as to who would lead the IOC if he should die, and suggested that Brundage become second vice-president, a newly created position. A mail ballot of IOC members who could be reached confirmed the choice the following year. When Edström was made president by the first postwar IOC session at Lausanne in September 1946, Brundage was elected first vice-president.
As vice president, Brundage served on a commission appointed at the IOC&#x27;s London session in 1948 to recommend whether the 1906 Intercalated Games, held in Athens, should be considered a full Olympic Games. All three members of what came to be known as the Brundage Commission were from the Western Hemisphere and met in New Orleans in January 1949. The commission found that there was nothing to be gained by recognizing the 1906 games as Olympic, and it might set an embarrassing precedent. The full IOC endorsed the report when it met later that year in Rome.

Edström intended to retire following the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, when a successor would be elected. Brundage&#x27;s rival for the presidency was Great Britain&#x27;s Lord Burghley, an Olympic gold medalist in track in 1928 and president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). The balloting took place at the IOC session in the Finnish capital before the Games. Although Brundage was the executive board&#x27;s candidate, he was disliked by some IOC members; others felt that the president should be a European. Private notes kept during the balloting reveal it to have been very close, but on the 25th and final ballot, Brundage received 30 votes to 17 for Burghley and was elected.

==IOC president (1952–1972)==
===Amateurism===
Throughout his career as a sports official, according to Guttmann, Brundage &quot;was unquestionably an idealist.&quot; He often concluded speeches by quoting from John Galsworthy:

This ideal was best realized, Brundage believed, in amateur sports. The athlete, he stated, should compete &quot;for the love of the game itself without thought of reward or payment of any kind,&quot; with professionals being part of the entertainment business. Amateurism, to Brundage, expressed the concept of the Renaissance man, with abilities in many fields, yet a specialist in none.

As the definition of &quot;amateur&quot; varied by sport, many of the battles Brundage engaged in concerned the question of what money or valuables an athlete could accept while retaining their amateur status, with some sports more liberal than others. In 1948, tennis allowed expense payments of up to $600 per tournament, while boxing permitted valuable prizes as awards. Enforcement of these rules often fell to National Olympic Committees, and Brundage found them less than enthusiastic about rules which hampered their own athletes in the pursuit of medals.

Both before and after becoming IOC president, Brundage was involved in a number of controversies involving threats to, or sometimes actual disqualification of, athletes for breach of amateur rules. In 1932, he was part of a special committee of the IAAF which disqualified Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi from the Los Angeles Games for allegedly accepting monetary compensation. At the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, rival US ice hockey teams, sponsored by different accrediting organizations (one from the AAU and the other from AHAUS), came to the Games. The dispute proved difficult, and the IOC initially voted to cancel the tournament and eliminate ice hockey as an Olympic sport, but relented as organizers had sold thousands of tickets. A compromise was then reached: the AAU team, backed by Brundage and the AOC, would march in the opening ceremony, while the AHAUS team, not favored by Brundage but supported by the LIHG (the forerunner to today&#x27;s IIHF), featuring former semi-professional players, were allowed to compete but could not earn an Olympic medal. However, since at the time the Olympic hockey tournament also doubled as that year&#x27;s Ice Hockey World Championships, their results would be recorded for that competition, in which they finished fourth. In 1972, Brundage banned Austrian skier Karl Schranz from the Sapporo Winter Olympics for commercial activities, calling him &quot;a walking billboard.&quot;

Eastern bloc countries were known for skirting the edge of the rules by having state-sponsored &quot;full-time amateurs.&quot; Their Olympic athletes were given everything they needed to live and train, but were not technically paid to do it, and all the money came from the government. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis. This put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage.
Near the end of the 1960s, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive against the Soviet team&#x27;s full-time athletes and the other constantly improving European teams. They pushed for the ability to use professional players, but met opposition from the IIHF and IOC; Brundage was opposed to the idea of amateurs and professionals competing together. At the IIHF Congress in 1969, the organization decided to allow Canada to use nine non-NHL professional hockey players at the 1970 World Championships in Montreal and Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The decision was reversed in January 1970 after Brundage said that ice hockey&#x27;s status as an Olympic sport would be in jeopardy if the change was made. In response, Canada withdrew from international ice hockey competition and officials stated that they would not return until &quot;open competition&quot; was instituted. Günther Sabetzki became president of the IIHF in 1975, after Brundage had left the post of IOC president, and helped to resolve the dispute with the CAHA. In 1976, the IIHF agreed to allow &quot;open competition&quot; between all players in the World Championships. However, NHL players were still not allowed to play in the Olympics because of the IOC&#x27;s amateur-only policy.

As IOC president, Brundage&#x27;s views on amateurism came increasingly to be seen as outdated in the modern world, as the rules were tested by athletes who saw everyone making money but themselves. In 1962, against Brundage&#x27;s opposition, the IOC amended the rules to allow sports federations to offer athletes &quot;broken time&quot; payments, compensating them for time missed from work, but only if they had dependents in need. In 1972, Brundage called for the elimination of the Winter Olympics after 1976, finding them hopelessly polluted by rampant commercialism, especially in alpine skiing. In his final speech to the IOC in Munich in 1972, Brundage maintained his position on amateurism: &quot;There are only two kinds of competitors. Those free and independent individuals who are interested in sports for sport&#x27;s sake, and those in sports for financial reasons. Olympic glory is for amateurs.&quot;

===National participation controversies===
====Germany====
No German team was allowed at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London or the Winter Games in St. Moritz. Brundage was anxious to reintegrate Germany into the Olympic movement once the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, through Brundage&#x27;s lifetime) was formed in 1949. Soon after the state&#x27;s formation, its National Olympic Committee approached the IOC, seeking recognition, but there was still much animus towards Germany. Just prior to the IOC session in Vienna in 1951 (Brundage was still vice president), the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) also formed an NOC and requested recognition. This created controversy, as the Federal Republic and its NOC claimed to represent both West and East Germany, but did not control the latter. Despite lengthy discussions, no resolution was reached in 1951, and the matter was put over until February 1952, when a negotiating session was scheduled for Copenhagen. Although the East Germans came to Copenhagen, they refused to attend the session, which was eventually cancelled by Edström after the IOC officials and West Germans waited for hours in vain. The German team which competed in Helsinki that summer was entirely West German (with Saarland, then a French protectorate, competing as an independent Saar team).

In 1954, the East Germans resumed their attempts at recognition. The following year, after Brundage received assurances that the East German NOC was not government-run, the IOC voted to recognize it, but required that both East and West Germany (as well as the Saar) compete as part of a single German team in 1956. East Germany sent only 37 athletes to the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, and they lived and trained separately from their West German counterparts. For the Summer Olympics at Rome in 1960, under continuing IOC insistence that the two states send a single team, East Germany contributed 141 of the 321 athletes; competitors from both states lived in the same area of the Olympic Village. At the Opening Ceremony at Rome, Italian President Giovanni Gronchi marveled, much to Brundage&#x27;s delight, that the IOC had obtained the German reunification which politicians had been unable to secure; Brundage responded, &quot;But in sport, we do such things.&quot; Brundage saw the German participation as symbolic of the potential for the Olympic Games to overcome divisions to unite.

Despite the construction of the Berlin Wall beginning in 1961, which increased tensions between East and West, Brundage was successful in securing a joint German team for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Nevertheless, the East Germans, supported by IOC members from Warsaw Pact nations, aspired to have their own team. They made a major breakthrough when the IAAF (led by the Marquess of Exeter, the former Lord Burghley) recognized a separate East German team beginning with the 1966 European Athletics Championships. The East Germans did their best to get Brundage&#x27;s support, and, at the IOC session at Mexico City in 1968, they were granted full membership, with their own team under their own flag, which they displayed on West German soil four years later at the Opening Ceremony at Munich. Brundage, while finally supporting full membership for East Germany, considered the matter a defeat for Olympic ideals.

==== Soviet Union ====
Although Tsarist Russia had sent athletes to the Olympic Games, after the Soviet Union was formed, it declined to participate, considering the Olympics bourgeois. As early as 1923, the IOC attempted to lure the Soviets back into the fold; Brundage visited the USSR in 1934. He was impressed by the progress which had been made there since a visit he had made in 1912 after competing in Stockholm. Despite his anti-communism, Brundage wanted the Soviets to join the Olympic movement. According to Guttmann, &quot;When Brundage had to choose between his hostility to communism and his commitment to the ideal of Olympic universality, he chose the latter. He wanted the Russians [sic] in the Olympics, communists or not.&quot;

During World War II, Brundage wrote to other IOC members that he had no objection to Soviet involvement in international sports, with representation on the IOC, if the USSR joined the international sports federations (ISFs). The IOC required that an NOC be independent of the government of the territory which it represents; there were concerns a Soviet NOC would not be. This was a problem not unique to communist states; a number of Latin American countries were starting to bring the local NOCs into the political structure, with an official naming the NOC chair—who might even be the country&#x27;s political leader. This mixture of sports and politics worried Brundage.

Beginning in 1946, the Soviets began to join international federations; in 1951 their NOC was recognized by the IOC, and they began Olympic competition the following year. As few Soviet sports officials were internationally known, the IOC had little alternative than to accept the nominees of the USSR&#x27;s government if they wished to have Soviet IOC members. The Soviet members were believers in sport, and completely loyal to their nation and to communist ideals. They quickly became the leaders of the IOC members from behind the Iron Curtain, who voted in accord with the Soviet members. Brundage visited the USSR at Soviet invitation (though at his own expense) in 1954. He deemed the nation&#x27;s physical education program as &quot;creating the greatest army of athletes the world has ever seen,&quot; warning (as he would often through the 1950s) that Americans were by comparison soft and unfit. Brundage found his view, often expressed in the press, that physical education and competitive sports made for better citizens, especially in the event of war, more enthusiastically embraced in the Soviet Union than in the United States. According to David Maraniss in his account of the 1960 Rome Games, Brundage&#x27;s admiration for the Soviet Union&#x27;s sports programs &quot;in some ways mirrored his response two decades earlier to his encounters with Nazi Germany&quot;.

On his return, he related in an article for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; that he had confronted Soviet officials with information from defectors stating that the USSR was running year-round training camps and giving athletes material inducements for success. He also repeated the Soviet response, which questioned the defectors&#x27; integrity: &quot;These men are deserters, traitors. Would you attach any truth to their statements had they been Americans and had turned against your country?&quot; Since Brundage did not comment on the response, there was a storm of controversy in the press, which accused Brundage of being a Soviet dupe.

Despite the evident conflicts between amateurism and the Soviet system in which athletes received salaries and property at state expense, allowing them to train full-time, Brundage took no action against the USSR or Warsaw Pact nations with similar systems; when challenged on this point, he argued that Western nations did similar things, citing athletic scholarships as an example. The Soviet system remained in place.

==== China and Taiwan ====
The Republic of China, which then governed the mainland, had joined the Olympic movement in 1924, when the China National Amateur Athletic Federation was recognized by the IOC as the nation&#x27;s NOC. China participated in the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, as well as in Berlin four years later and the first post-war Olympics at London in 1948. When the communists were successful in the Chinese Civil War and established the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, most NOC members fled the mainland for the island of Taiwan. This left China with two rival NOCs, one on the mainland and one on Taiwan, each claiming to represent the whole of China.

Matters came to a head in 1952, when the mainland NOC (the All-China Athletic Federation), considering itself a continuation of the pre-1949 committee, wrote to the IOC stating that it desired to participate in the Helsinki Olympics to be held that year. As the Taiwanese also proposed to send a team, this conflicted with IOC rules stating that only one committee could represent a country, and both Chinese groups were unwilling to negotiate with the other, or to send a joint team. After considerable deliberation, the IOC decided that if either committee was recognized by the ISF for a sport, the committee could send athletes to participate in events in that discipline. In protest, Taiwan withdrew from the Games; the PRC sent a team to Helsinki, though it arrived ten days after the start of the Games. Brundage, president-elect when the decision was made to allow PRC athletes to compete, argued against the decision to allow mainland participation before its NOC was recognized, but he was overruled by his colleagues.

In 1954, the Brundage-headed IOC, in a narrow vote, recognized both committees, thus allowing both states to participate at Melbourne. Only the PRC&#x27;s committee initially accepted, but when the Taiwanese NOC changed its mind and decided to send a team to the Games, the mainlanders withdrew in protest. Brundage took the position that despite similar concerns about state sponsorship as with the USSR, once the PRC&#x27;s committee was recognized and reported to the IOC that all eligibility rules were observed, the international committee had to accept that unless it had evidence to the contrary. He was frustrated by the continuing controversy, considering the squabble a distraction from the goal of advancing the Olympic movement.

When continuing efforts to exclude the Taiwanese failed, in 1958 the mainlanders withdrew from the IOC. The following year, the IOC ruled the Taiwanese could not compete under the name Republic of China Olympic Committee, but would have to compete under some other name which did not imply they governed sports in China. Brundage and Exeter both advocated for the ruling, which they compared to having an Italian NOC represent only Sicily. The press interpreted the ruling to mean that Nationalist China had been expelled from the Olympic movement, and for the next year, the anti-communist Brundage found himself under attack in the press as a communist sympathizer. Although United States State Department officials attempted to persuade them to stand on principle, Taiwanese officials decided to participate in the Rome Games, hoping to secure China&#x27;s first medal, and believing their NOC&#x27;s continued presence helped keep mainland China out of the Games. Taiwanese athletes competed under the designation Formosa (an alternate name for Taiwan), and caused a sensation by briefly displaying a sign reading &quot;Under Protest&quot; at the Opening Ceremony; when Yang Chuan-Kwang took the silver medal in the decathlon, he was not allowed to display the Nationalist Chinese flag at the medals ceremony.

Brundage, through his tenure, slowly came around to the position advocated by Iron Curtain IOC members, that the important thing was to recognize the mainland, with Taiwan of less importance. Although the mainland Chinese were invited by the Munich Olympic organizers to send an observer delegation to Munich (they declined due to the Taiwanese presence), it was not until 1975, after Brundage&#x27;s departure as president, that the PRC applied to rejoin the Olympic movement. The PRC again participated at the 1980 Winter Games at Lake Placid and then the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles; the island NOC competed as the Republic of China in 1968 and 1972; when refused permission to compete under that name in 1976, after Brundage&#x27;s death, it boycotted the 1976 and 1980 games, returning in 1984 as Chinese Taipei.

====South Africa and Rhodesia====
In the late 1950s, protest against South Africa&#x27;s apartheid regime reached the stage of seeking to exclude the nation from international sport. In 1956, government rules requiring separate events for whites and non-whites in South Africa were issued; non-whites received poorer facilities. Brundage initially opposed taking any action. The run-up to the 1960 Rome Olympics had seen tumult in South Africa, including the Sharpeville massacre and a crackdown on the African National Congress. Activists attempted to persuade Brundage that South Africa should be excluded from the Games. Brundage initially took the word of South African sport leaders that all citizens were able to compete for a place on the Olympic team, and that non-white South Africans simply were not good enough.

The drive towards a boycott was fueled by the large number of African nations which became independent in the late 1950s and early 1960s. To prevent the new nations from overwhelming the ISFs, Brundage proposed that the federations adopt weighted voting systems to allow earlier members to wield disproportionate influence, which some did. By 1962, with the suspension of South Africa from FIFA (the association football governing body), Brundage had come around to the position that South Africa&#x27;s racist policies were inconsistent with the ideals of the Olympic movement. At the 1963 IOC session in Baden-Baden (moved there from Nairobi when Kenyan officials refused to issue visas to South African representatives), the IOC voted to suspend South Africa from the Olympics unless its NOC and government adopted non-discrimination policies regarding Olympic selection. This did not come to pass, and South Africa did not participate in 1964. In 1968, Brundage and the IOC invited a South African team (supposedly to be multiracial) to the Mexico City Games, but under a threatened boycott and with evidence of minimal South African compliance, withdrew it.

In 1971, the IOC, at its Amsterdam session, voted to strip the South African NOC of recognition. Although Brundage had hoped to keep South Africa within the Olympic movement, he believed that those who sought its expulsion had made the stronger case. South Africa did not return to the Olympics until the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, after the end of its apartheid government.

A parallel problem was that of Rhodesia, the British colony which had unilaterally declared its independence from the United Kingdom in 1965. Rhodesia had a white minority government. In May 1968, the United Nations Security Council condemned its government and asked nations not to honor its passports, and the Mexican government, set to host the Olympics later that year, complied with the ban. The IOC initially believed that sports facilities in the breakaway colony were not segregated, despite its government&#x27;s policies. The proposed 16-member Olympic team included two black athletes. Because of this, Brundage supported Rhodesian participation at Mexico City, but he was overruled by the IOC; according to the head of the Rhodesian Olympic Committee, Douglas Downing, &quot;His voice cries in a wilderness of spite.&quot; For Munich in 1972, the IOC decided to allow the Rhodesians to compete as British subjects, which by international law they were. African nations again threatened to boycott if the Rhodesians were allowed to participate, and, at its Munich session in 1972 just before the Games, the IOC narrowly voted to exclude the Rhodesians. Brundage was livid at the decision, believing that the IOC had yielded to blackmail. In 1974, after Brundage left office, the IOC found evidence of segregated facilities in Rhodesia, and it subsequently withdrew recognition from its NOC. Rhodesia returned to the Olympics in 1980 as recognized independent Zimbabwe.

===Olympic administration; challenges to leadership===
Unpaid as IOC president, even for his expenses, Brundage sometimes spent $50,000 per year to finance his role. In 1960, the IOC had almost no funds. Brundage and the IOC had considered the potential of television revenue as early as the Melbourne Games of 1956, but had been slow to address the issue, with the result that television rights for the 1960 Games were in the hands of the Rome organizing committee; the IOC received only 5% of the $60,000 rights fee. Accounts submitted by the Rome organizers showed they lost money on the Olympics; the IOC would have received a portion of the profits, and had no money to offer the sports federations who wanted a percentage of the proceeds. In future years, the sale of television rights became a major source of revenue for the IOC, rising to $10 million by the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, and $1.2 billion, long after Brundage&#x27;s death, at Athens in 2004. Brundage was concerned about the increasing revenue, warning IOC members in 1967, &quot;The moment we handle money, even if we only distribute it, there will be trouble ...&quot;

NOC representatives had met with Brundage and the IOC executive board from time to time, but many NOC representatives felt that Brundage was taking no action in response to concerns expressed by the NOC attendees. In the early 1960s, many NOCs, led by Italian IOC member Giulio Onesti, sought to bypass Brundage and the IOC by forming a Permanent General Assembly of National Olympic Committees (PGA-NOC), which Brundage strongly opposed and the IOC refused to recognize. The PGA-NOC from 1965 demanded a share of television revenue; it also desired that the ISFs, not the IOC, set policy on amateurism.

Brundage had been initially elected in 1952 for an eight-year term; he was re-elected unanimously in 1960 for an additional four years. Despite talk that he would be opposed by Exeter, Brundage&#x27;s 1952 rival nominated him for the new term. Brundage was re-elected in 1964 by an announced unanimous vote, though Guttmann records that Brundage actually only narrowly turned back a challenge by Exeter. As Brundage&#x27;s term as president neared its end in 1968, some IOC members, who saw him as hidebound, or just too old at 81 to effectively lead the organization, sought his ouster. Nevertheless, he was easily re-elected at the IOC session in Mexico City that year, though he pledged not to seek another four-year term, but to retire in 1972. Ireland&#x27;s Lord Killanin was elected first vice-president. Killanin, seen (correctly) as Brundage&#x27;s likely successor, was more sympathetic to the concerns of the NOCs, and attended PGA-NOC meetings. Brundage did not recognize the PGA-NOC, but did establish joint IOC-NOC committees to address NOC concerns. Although the PGA-NOC did not gain Olympic recognition, it remained a significant outside organization through Brundage&#x27;s presidency, and according to Guttmann, &quot;Brundage won a less than total victory and Onesti suffered a far from complete defeat. The I.O.C. had become far more attractive to the national Olympic committees and to their interests, and that is what Onesti called for in the first place.&quot;

With Brundage in Chicago or at his California home, day to day IOC operations were overseen at &quot;Mon Repos&quot;, the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, by Otto Meyer, the IOC&#x27;s chancellor. Brundage came to consider Meyer too impetuous, and dismissed him in 1964, abolishing the office. Eventually, Brundage promoted Monique Berlioux to be IOC director in the last years of his tenure, and apparently found her services satisfactory. Mon Repos, the former home of the founder of the Modern Olympics, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, proved too cramped for the IOC, which had to share space with de Coubertin&#x27;s widow, who lived to be 101. In 1968, the IOC moved to new quarters at Lausanne&#x27;s Château de Vidy.

===Political demonstration at Mexico City===

The year 1968 had seen turmoil in the United States, including hundreds of riots, both before and after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and continuing after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Prior to the Olympics in Mexico City in October 1968, some African Americans, led by activist Harry Edwards, had urged a boycott of the Games, but found little enthusiasm among athletes, reluctant to waste years of effort. The atmosphere was made more tense by unrest in Mexico City before the Games, which left dozens dead.

There were racial tensions between black US athletes and their white counterparts; in one incident, African Americans blocked whites from the track. One black runner, Tommie Smith, told writers on October 15, &quot;I don&#x27;t want Brundage presenting me any medals&quot;. The following day, Smith won the 200 meters, and fellow African-American John Carlos took the bronze medal. The two men, after receiving their medals from IAAF president Lord Exeter, and as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; played, raised black-gloved fists, heads down, in salute of black power. Brundage deemed it to be a domestic political statement unfit for the apolitical, international forum the Olympic Games were intended to be. In response to their actions, he ordered Smith and Carlos suspended from the US team and banned from the Olympic Village. When the US Olympic Committee refused, Brundage threatened to ban the entire US track team. This threat led to the expulsion of the two athletes from the Games. Other demonstrations by African-Americans also took place: the three African Americans who took the medals in the 400 meters race, led by gold medalist Lee Evans, wore black berets on the podium but took them off before the anthem while African-American boxer George Foreman, triumphant in the heavyweight division, waved a small American flag around the boxing ring and bowed to the crowd with fellow American boxers. Brundage&#x27;s comment about the Smith-Carlos incident was &quot;Warped mentalities and cracked personalities seem to be everywhere and impossible to eliminate.&quot; The USOC&#x27;s official report omits the iconic photograph of Smith and Carlos with their fists raised; the local organizing committee&#x27;s official film showed footage of the ceremony. Brundage, who termed the incident &quot;the nasty demonstration against the American flag by negroes&quot;, objected in vain to its inclusion.

===Munich 1972===

At the same IOC session in August 1972 in Munich at which the Rhodesians were excluded, the IOC elected Killanin as Brundage&#x27;s successor, to take office after the Games. Brundage cast a blank ballot in the vote which selected the Irishman, considering him an intellectual lightweight without the force of character needed to hold the Olympic movement together.

Brundage hoped that the Munich Games would take the sting out of his defeat over the Rhodesian issue. Munich was one of his favorite cities (in 1975, the Brundageplatz there would be named after him), and the (&#x27;cheerful Games&#x27;) were designed to efface memories of 1936 and Berlin in the eyes of the world. They initially seemed to be doing so, as athletic feats, like those of gymnast Olga Korbut and swimmer Mark Spitz captivated viewers. In the early morning of September 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists from the organization Black September entered the Olympic Village and took 11 Israelis hostage, demanding freedom for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli custody. Brundage, once informed, rushed to the Olympic Village, where he conferred with German and Bavarian state officials through the day, playing what Guttmann describes as a modest role in the discussions. German officials moved the hostages and their captors to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, where German police and troops tried a rescue late that evening. The attempt was bungled; the nine remaining hostages (two had been murdered earlier) and three of their captors were killed.

Even before the ill-fated rescue attempt, IOC officials began conferring. Killanin and other officials were in Kiel for the yacht racing; they hurried back to Munich. Just before 4 pm, Brundage called off the remainder of the day&#x27;s events, and announced a memorial service honoring those who had already died for the following morning. Many Olympic leaders were critical of Brundage for his participation in the discussions with the government, feeling that this should have been left for the authorities and the local organizing committee, but all supported the memorial service, which was held the following day in the Olympic Stadium. There, before the audience in the stadium and the millions watching on television, Brundage offered what Guttmann called &quot;the credo of his life&quot;:

The crowd in the stadium responded to Brundage&#x27;s statement with loud applause; according to &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot;, &quot;Brundage&#x27;s statement that &#x27;the games must go on&#x27; took much of the heavy gloom away which has permeated Munich since early Tuesday [September 5, the day of the attack].&quot;

Killanin, after his own retirement as IOC president, stated that &quot;I believe Brundage was right to continue and that his stubborn determination saved the Olympic Movement one more time&quot; but that Brundage&#x27;s mention of the Rhodesian question was, while not inappropriate, at least better left for another time. According to future IOC vice president Dick Pound, the insertion of the Rhodesian issue into the speech &quot;was universally condemned, and Brundage left office under a cloud of criticism that effectively undermined a lifetime of well-intentioned work in the Olympic movement&quot;. Brundage said after the Games, &quot;I was severely criticized for that ... but the fact is that I did it on purpose. I had to. There was a principle involved and altho [sic] it was a terrible thing that some lives were lost, principles are just as important as human lives.&quot; Brundage subsequently issued a statement that he did not mean to imply the decision to exclude the Rhodesians, which he stated was &quot;purely a matter of sport&quot;, was comparable to the murder of the Israelis. According to Alfred Senn in his history of the Olympics, the decision to continue the games &quot;sat poorly with many observers&quot;; sportswriter Red Smith of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was among the critics:

==Retirement and death==
Brundage retired as IOC president after the 1972 Summer Games. There were differing accounts of Brundage&#x27;s state of mind during his retirement. IOC director Berlioux stated that Brundage would come to the Château de Vidy and take telephone calls or look at correspondence while he waited for Lord Killanin to turn to him for help. According to Berlioux, Brundage sometimes called her from Geneva and asked her to go there. The two would spend hours wandering the streets, saying little. Brundage&#x27;s longtime , Frederick Ruegsegger (1920-2000), described a different, tranquil, Brundage, whom he compared to an abdicated Japanese emperor.

His wife of nearly half a century, Elizabeth, died in 1971. Brundage had once jested that his ambition was to wed a German princess. In June 1973, this came to pass when he married Princess Mariann Charlotte Katharina Stefanie von Reuss (1936–2003), daughter of Heinrich XXXVII, Prince of Reuss-Köstritz. Von Reuss had worked as an interpreter during the Munich Games; she stated that she had met Brundage in 1955, when she was 19. When Brundage was asked by reporters about the 48-year difference in their ages, Brundage responded that he was young for his age and she mature for hers, and instead of 85 years to 37, it should be thought of as more like 55 to 46. Ruegsegger refused to be best man and stated after Brundage&#x27;s death that the couple had dissipated much of Brundage&#x27;s fortune through free spending, though Guttmann notes that some of those purchases were of real estate, which could be deemed investments.
In January 1974, Brundage underwent surgery for cataracts and glaucoma. The necessary arrangements had initially been made by Brundage&#x27;s protégé, Spanish IOC member Juan Antonio Samaranch, who would become IOC president in 1980. At the last moment, Brundage cancelled the plans, choosing to have the surgery in Munich, near the home he had purchased in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, site of the 1936 Winter Olympics. After a month and a half, Brundage was discharged from the hospital, though whether the surgery had improved his vision was disputed, with Mariann Brundage stating that it did and Ruegsegger stating the contrary. Now frail, at age 87 he went with his wife on a final tour of the Far East. Despite the efforts of Olympic officials on his behalf, he was not given an invitation to mainland China, source of much of the art he loved. In April 1975, Brundage entered the hospital at Garmisch-Partenkirchen with flu and a severe cough. He died there on May 8, 1975, of heart failure, and was buried at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago.

In his will, Brundage provided for his wife and for Ruegsegger, as well as making several charitable bequests. He left his papers and memorabilia to the University of Illinois; he had already given it $350,000 to fund scholarships for students interested in competing in sports who do not receive an athletic scholarship.

==Personal life and business career==
===Relationships===
In 1927, at the age of 40, Brundage married Elizabeth Dunlap, who was the daughter of a Chicago banker. She was a trained soprano, which was a talent that she exhibited to people who visited the Brundage home. She had a strong interest in classical music. This interest might not have been fully shared by her husband, who said that a performance of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Walküre&quot; &quot;started at 7 o&#x27;clock, at 10:00 pm I looked at my watch and it registered exactly 8 o&#x27;clock&quot;. Elizabeth died at age 81 in 1971.

In 1973, Brundage married Princess Mariann Charlotte Katharina Stefanie von Reuss. He had no children with either of his two wives. However, during his first marriage Brundage fathered two sons out of wedlock with his Finnish mistress, Lilian Dresden. His affair with Dresden was one of many. The children were born in 1951 and 1952, at precisely the time that Brundage was being considered for the presidency of the IOC. Though he privately acknowledged paternity, Brundage took great pains to conceal the existence of these children; he was concerned that the truth about his extra-marital relationships might damage his chances of election. He requested that his name be kept off the birth certificates. Brundage visited his two sons periodically in the 1950s, visits that tailed off to telephone calls in the 1960s and nothing in his final years. He did establish a trust fund for the boys&#x27; education and start in life, but after his death, unnamed in his will, they sued and won a small settlement of $62,500 each out of his $19 million estate.

===Construction executive===
After its founding in 1915, a large source of the Avery Brundage Company&#x27;s business was wartime government contracts. Brundage, who applied for a commission in the Army Ordnance Corps but was rejected, in the postwar period became a member of the Construction Division Association, composed of men who had built facilities for the military, and later became its president from 1926 to 1928.

In the 1920s, Brundage and his company became very active in constructing high-rise apartment buildings in Chicago. He used rapid construction methods, allowing clients to begin realizing income from their investments quickly—the Sheridan-Brompton Apartments (1924) overlooking Lincoln Park, were built in five months, allowing the start of $40,000 in monthly rental income, offsetting a monthly mortgage payment of $15,000. Often, the Brundage Company was involved in the ownership of the apartments: 3800 Sheridan Road (1927), a 17-story building costing $3,180,000, was owned by a company which had as its president and treasurer Chester Brundage, Avery&#x27;s younger brother. It was constructed in eight months, through the Chicago winter, using an onsite concrete mixing plant. This temporary structure also provided office space for the construction. Another source of income for Brundage and his company was hotel construction, for which he was often paid in part with stock in the new facility. One president of an engineering firm specializing in large structures called Brundage&#x27;s methods on the Shoreham Hotel &quot;progressive, snappy, [and] up-to-date&quot; and &quot;straightforward and honest&quot;.

In 1923, Brundage constructed a massive assembly plant on Torrence Avenue on Chicago&#x27;s South Side for the Ford Motor Company. At $4 million in cost and bringing under one roof, it was the largest industrial plant built by Brundage. Constructed in ten months, the new facility helped meet the national demand for Model T cars in the 1920s, and in 1950, produced 154,244 vehicles. A plant for Hubbard &amp; Co. was erected in 125 days despite an unusually harsh Chicago winter. Despite later statements from Brundage that he avoided public works due to corruption, he built the 23rd Street viaduct as part of the South Shore Development project; Brundage&#x27;s viaduct extended Chicago&#x27;s shoreline into Lake Michigan at a cost of two million dollars. By 1925, the Avery Brundage Company was acclaimed for speed, innovation and quality, and had a payroll of $50,000 a week.

Although the start of the Depression in 1929 was a major setback for Brundage, he rebuilt his wealth by investments in real estate, also accepting interests in buildings he had constructed in lieu of payments the owners were unable to make. He later stated that &quot;you didn&#x27;t have to be a wizard&quot; in order to &quot;buy stocks and bonds in depressed corporations for a few cents on the dollar—and then wait. I was just a little lucky.&quot; According to historian and archivist Maynard Brichford, Brundage &quot;emerged from the difficult depression years with a substantial annual income, a good reputation, and excellent investments&quot;. His foresight resulted in a fortune which by 1960 was estimated at $25,000,000.

A major Brundage investment was Chicago&#x27;s La Salle Hotel, which had been built in 1908. Located in the heart of The Loop and the city&#x27;s financial district, Brundage first leased it in 1940, later purchasing it. When the hotel was seriously damaged by fire in 1946, Brundage spent about $2.5 million remodeling and modernizing it. As Brundage made a home there during his time as IOC president, the hotel became famous in international sports as his residence. He sold the hotel in 1970, but later reclaimed it when the purchaser failed to make required payments.

===Art collector and benefactor===
Brundage&#x27;s interest in Asian art stemmed from a visit he made to an exhibition of Chinese art at the Royal Academy in London in early 1936, after the Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Brundage stated of the experience, &quot;We [his first wife Elizabeth and himself] spent a week at the exhibition and I came away so enamored with Chinese art that I&#x27;ve been broke ever since.&quot; He did not begin active collecting until after the Brundages&#x27; two-week visit to Japan in April 1939, where they visited Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, and . They followed up Japan with visits to Shanghai and Hong Kong, but due to the war between Japan and China, were unable to explore further on Avery Brundage&#x27;s only visit to mainland China—this disappointment bothered him his whole life.

On his return to the United States after the June 1939 IOC session in London, Brundage systematically set about becoming a major collector of Asian art. The unsettled conditions caused wealthy Chinese to sell family heirlooms, and prices were depressed, making it an opportune moment to collect. He bought many books on Asian art, stating in an interview that a &quot;major library is an indispensable tool&quot;. After the US entered World War II, stock owned by Japanese dealers in the United States was impounded; Brundage was able to purchase the best items. Dealers found him willing to spend money, but knowledgeable and a hard bargainer. Brundage rarely was fooled by forgeries, and was undeterred by the few he did buy, noting that in Asian art, fake pieces were often a thousand years old. In his 1948 article on Brundage for &quot;Life&quot;, Butterfield noted that &quot;his collection is regarded as one of the largest and most important in private hands in this country&quot;.

Brundage engaged the French scholar , then teaching at the University of California, as full-time curator of his collection and advisor on acquisitions. The two men made a deal—no piece would be purchased unless both men agreed. They built a collection of jade which ranged from the neolithic period to the modern era; and hundreds of Chinese, Japanese and Korean bronzes, mostly Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The painter whom Brundage admired the most was , 12th-century Chinese emperor of the Song dynasty; the collector never was able to obtain any of his work. Brundage several times bought pieces smuggled out of their lands of origin to restore them there. When Brundage sold a piece, it was most likely because he no longer favored it artistically, rather than to realize a profit. In 1954, a financial statement prepared for Brundage listed the value of his collection as more than $1 million. In 1960, Robert Shaplen, in his article on Brundage for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, noted that Brundage, during his travels as IOC president, always found time to visit art dealers, and stated that the collection was valued at $15 million.

By the late 1950s, Brundage was increasingly concerned about what to do with his collection. His homes in Chicago and California were so overwhelmed with art that priceless artifacts were kept in shoeboxes under beds. In 1959, Brundage agreed to give part of his collection to the city of San Francisco. The following year city voters passed a bond issue of $2,725,000 to house the donation. The result was the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, which opened in 1966 in Golden Gate Park, initially sharing space with the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum before moving to its own facility near the Civic Center in 2003. Brundage made another major donation in 1969 (despite a fire which destroyed many pieces at his California home, &quot;La Piñeta&quot; near Santa Barbara in 1964), and left the remainder of his collection to the museum in his will. Today, the museum has 7,700 pieces from Brundage among the 17,000-plus objects which make up its collection.

Brundage connected the world of art and that of amateur sports in his own mind. In a speech to the IOC session in Tokyo in 1958, he discussed , used at one time by Japanese men to anchor items, typically wallets, hung from kimono belts. Brundage owned several thousand , and held two in his hands as he spoke. He told the members that a was at one time carefully carved by the man who wore it, building &quot;something of himself into the design&quot;, and although a class of professional makers arose later, whose work might have been more technically adept, it was &quot;ordinarily cold, stiff, and without imagination. ... Missing was the element of the amateur carver, which causes these netsuke to be esteemed so much higher by the collector than the commercial product carved for money.&quot; Brundage later commented about his speech, &quot;Here was the difference between amateurism and professionalism spelled out in a .&quot;

==Legacy==
In May 2012, &quot;The Independent&quot; dubbed him &quot;The ancient IOC emperor, anti-Semite and Nazi sympathiser bent on insulating the Games from the meddlesome tentacles of the real world.&quot; The &quot;Orange County Register&quot; stated that Brundage&#x27;s &quot;racism and anti-Semitism are well documented&quot;, and the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; averred that Brundage &quot;admired Hitler and infamously replaced two Jewish sprinters on the 4-by-100 relay team because it could have further embarrassed Hitler if they won&quot;. David Miller described him as &quot;despotic&quot; in &quot;The Official History of the Olympic Games and the IOC&quot; (2012).

In 2021, San Francisco’s Asian Art Museum removed a bust of Brundage that had sat prominently in its foyer for five decades, which had been dedicated to him for his donating his sizable collection. Museum director Jay Xu wrote that Brundage &quot;espoused racist and anti-Semitic views&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The Nation&quot;, Dave Zirin and Jules Boykoff criticized him for his controversial policies and statements, concluding, &quot;Brundage’s &#x27;contributions&#x27; to Olympic history need to be understood. But he has long forfeited a place of honor and respect&quot;.

Brundage, the only American and only non-European to serve as IOC president, left a mixed legacy. Guttmann notes that in the 1960s, Brundage may have been better-known as an art collector than for his sports activities, and &quot;there are those who maintain that he will be remembered not for his career in sports but for his jades and bronzes.&quot; Andrew Leigh, a Member of the Australian House of Representatives, criticizes Brundage for expelling the two athletes in Mexico City, calling him &quot;a man who&#x27;d had no difficulty with the Nazi salute being used in the 1936 Olympics&quot;. Dick Pound believes Brundage to have been one of the IOC&#x27;s great presidents, along with de Coubertin and Samaranch, but concedes that by the end of his term, Brundage was out of touch with the world of sports. While Pound credits Brundage with holding the Olympic movement together in a period when it was beset by many challenges, he notes that this might not be fully appreciated by those who remember Brundage for the final years of his term, and for Munich.

Alfred Senn suggests that Brundage remained too long as IOC president:

<doc id="412062" wikidata="Q1164657" url="?curid=412062" title="Danny Davis (Illinois politician)">
<text>Daniel K. Davis (born September 6, 1941) is an American politician who is the U.S. representative from , elected in 1996. The district serves much of western Chicago, as well as the Loop. It also includes several of Chicago&#x27;s inner western suburbs, such as Bellwood, Oak Park, and River Forest. Davis is a Democrat, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and a former member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).

== Early life, education, and career ==
Davis was born in Parkdale, Arkansas, and educated at Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College (now the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; B.A. in history, 1961), Chicago State University (M.S. in guidance, 1968), and the Union Institute &amp; University in Cincinnati, Ohio (Ph.D. in public administration, 1977).

Davis worked as a government clerk, a high school teacher, executive director of the Greater Lawndale Conservation Commission, director of training at the Martin L. King Neighborhood Health Center, and executive director of the Westside Health Center before entering politics. He represented Chicago&#x27;s 29th Ward on the Chicago City Council from 1979 to 1990.

Davis challenged U.S. Representative Cardiss Collins in Democratic primaries in 1984 and 1986, but lost both races. In 1990, he unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Edward J. Rosewell for the Democratic nomination for Cook County Treasurer. Also in 1990, Davis was elected to the Cook County Board of Commissioners, serving from 1990 to 1996 before entering the House. Davis had also waged an unsuccessful campaign against Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley in the 1991 Democratic mayoral primary.

=== Cook County Board of Commissioners ===
Davis was elected to the Cook County Board of Commissioners from Chicago at-large in 1990. When the board transitioned to district elections in 1994, he was elected to its 1st district.

Entering Congress in 1997, Davis left the Cook County Board of Commissioners. He desired to see Illinois State Senator Earlean Collins appointed his successor on the board, but party leaders instead chose Darlena Williams-Burnett, executive assistant of Jesse White and the wife of alderman Walter Burnett Jr. Collins challenged and unseated Williams-Burnett in the Democratic primary for the seat in 1998.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===

On December 6, 1995, Davis announced his candidacy for the 7th congressional district, adding his name to the already announced Democratic candidates, including Alderman Percy Z. Giles, Cook County Board of Commissioners member Bobbie L. Steele, Alderman Ed Smith, and Alderman Dorothy Tillman. Five other Democratic candidates entered the race later: S. Mendenhall, Joan Sullivan, G. Winbush, Anthony Travis, and Joan Powell, making it the largest field of candidates for U.S. Congress in Illinois in 1996. Davis lived a block outside the district, but was familiar in it.

Davis ran on a progressive Democratic platform popular in the district. He was pro-choice and supported gay rights, the ERA, single-payer health care, and some federal support for child nutrition and care.

In early January 1996, the FBI revealed its Operation Silver Shovel, which included an investigation into Alderman Giles. What Operation Silver Shovel may have done to undermine Giles&#x27;s chances for election are unclear as he was already lagging with a mere 3% among likely Democratic primary voters in a mid-December poll compared to Davis&#x27;s 33%, Smith&#x27;s 8%, Tillman&#x27;s 7%, and Steele&#x27;s 6%. But Giles did have Mayor Richard M. Daley&#x27;s support and that of other well-known area figures—some of whom continued their support during the controversy.

On March 10, 1996, during a radio debate hosted by WMAQ-AM, Tillman and Smith called for Davis to reject the endorsement of former alderman candidate Wallace &quot;Gator&quot; Bradley, spokesman for convicted Gangster Disciples leader Larry Hoover. &quot;Why do you keep badgering me with this question?&quot; Davis replied. &quot;You got a problem with something? You&#x27;re not going to catch me going around saying I hate Gator Bradley. ... I&#x27;m not in the business of disavowing individuals. The good Lord said he hated sin, but not sinners. I&#x27;m not hating Gator Bradley. I disagree with those who commit crime and those who&#x27;d use drugs, but you won&#x27;t catch me going around saying that I hate Gator Bradley.&quot; Davis never rejected Bradley&#x27;s endorsement during the campaign, and after winning the primary claimed that Bradley&#x27;s endorsement played no role in the outcome, though Bradley asserted the contrary.

During the campaign, Tillman highlighted comments Davis made in an August 1970 issue of &quot;Ebony&quot;: &quot;[T]he white female often gives the black man certain kinds of recognition that the black woman often does not give him.&quot; The Davis campaign countered that Davis was speaking as a psychologist in his role as a training director at a health center.

Although Davis was fully promoted as a Democratic candidate, he also ran as a New Party candidate. Supporting this was New Party&#x27;s celebration of him as the &quot;first New Party member elected to the U.S. Congress.&quot; Although the State of Illinois did not permit fusion voting, New Party advocated it as a means to promote itself and its agenda and to project New Party ideology into the Democratic Party. Candidates were called &quot;N[ew]P[arty] Democrats&quot; and required to sign a contract mandating a &quot;visible and active relationship&quot; with New Party. During this time, New Party was experiencing substantial growth. Davis was also endorsed by the Chicago Democratic Socialists of America (CDSA), of which he had been a member since before his congressional run. ACORN, AFL–CIO, Sierra Club, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters also endorsed Davis.

In the March 20 Democratic primary, Davis received more votes than the two closest candidates, Tillman and Smith, combined. The first five announced candidates all received more than twice as many votes as the five late-entering candidates, with none of the latter receiving more than 2,700.

In the November 5 general election, Davis defeated Republican Randy Borow and third-party candidates Chauncey L. Stroud (Independent), Toietta Dixon (Libertarian), and Charles A. Winter (Natural Law) with over 82% of the vote.
=== Tenure ===
Davis expressed interest in replacing John Stroger on the ballot in the 2006 race for President of the Cook County Board. Stroger&#x27;s son Todd Stroger was ultimately selected.

In late 2008, Davis expressed interest in being President Barack Obama&#x27;s replacement in the U.S. Senate before Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich&#x27;s scandal erupted. In a December 31, 2008, &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Davis said that he turned down an offer from Blagojevich&#x27;s representatives to appoint him to the Senate. Instead, Blagojevich appointed Roland Burris.

Davis ran for mayor of Chicago a second time in 2011, but withdrew before the election and endorsed Carol Moseley Braun.

In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Davis endorsed Kamala Harris. He later endorsed Joe Biden ahead of the Iowa caucus.

==== Sun Myung Moon ====
In 2004, Davis was met with national controversy when he crowned Reverend Sun Myung Moon in a religious ceremony at the Dirksen Senate Office Building honoring Moon. Moon declared himself the Messiah at the crowning ceremony, in which Davis appeared on the invitation as a sponsoring co-chair. Davis wore white gloves and carried the crown on a pillow to crown Moon and his wife &quot;the King and Queen of Peace.&quot; Davis told &quot;Christian Challenge&quot; that Moon&#x27;s declaring himself the Messiah &quot;was similar to a baseball team owner telling team members that &#x27;we are the greatest team on earth&#x27;&quot; before a game. Davis said the peace awards were to &quot;recognize people for promoting peace. Of course the highest recognition goes to the highest promoter and the highest promoter is Reverend Moon, so they come up with something higher than the certificates and plaques that other folks get.&quot; Other lawmakers who attended included Senator Mark Dayton, Representatives Roscoe Bartlett and Elijah Cummings, and former Representative Walter Fauntroy. Key organizers of the event included George Augustus Stallings, Jr., a controversial former Catholic priest who had been married by Moon, and Michael Jenkins, the president of the Unification Church of the United States at that time.

==== Trip paid for by Tamil Tigers ====
As the 15th most prolific traveler in Congress, Davis stirred up controversy by accepting a trip to Sri Lanka in 2005 on behalf of the Tamil minority there, paid for by the Tamil Tigers, a group that the U.S. government has designated as a terrorist organization for its use of suicide bombers and child soldiers. Davis said that he was unaware that the Tigers were the source of the trip&#x27;s funding.

==== Relationship with Louis Farrakhan ====
Davis has said that Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam who has attracted considerable controversy for his anti-Semitic and homophobic remarks, is an &quot;outstanding human being&quot; and that &quot;I personally know him, I&#x27;ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him.&quot; In March 2018, Davis said: &quot;The world is so much bigger than Farrakhan and the Jewish question and his position on that and so forth. For those heavy into it, that&#x27;s their thing, but it ain&#x27;t my thing.&quot; Davis condemned Farrakhan&#x27;s views later that month, saying, &quot;So let me be clear: I reject, condemn and oppose Minister Farrakhan&#x27;s views and remarks regarding the Jewish people and the Jewish religion.&quot; He attended Farrakhan&#x27;s Million Man March and was the only member of Congress to address the 20th anniversary of it.

== Personal life ==
 Davis is married to Vera G. Davis. They have two children. Davis is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He is notable for his support of the National Federation of the Blind. He spoke at their 2004 and 2005 conventions.

On November 18, 2016, Davis&#x27;s 15-year-old grandson Javon Wilson was murdered while trying to break up a fight during a home invasion in Chicago&#x27;s Englewood neighborhood.

<text>are curved, comma-shaped beads that appeared in prehistoric Japan from the Final Jōmon period through the Kofun period, approximately 1000 BCE to the 6th century CE. The beads, also described as &quot;jewels&quot;, were made of primitive stone and earthen materials in the early period, but by the end of the Kofun period were made almost exclusively of jade. originally served as decorative jewelry, but by the end of the Kofun period functioned as ceremonial and religious objects.

==Jōmon period==
 first appeared in Japan in the Final Jōmon period (1000–300 BCE), and in this period were made from relatively simple, naturally occurring materials, including clay, talc, slate, quartz, gneiss, jadeite, nephrite, and serpentinite. from the Jōmon period were irregularly shaped, lacked continuity in form from region to region, and have been called &quot;Stone Age &quot; for this reason. are thought to be an imitation of the teeth of large animals, pierced with a hole, which are found in earlier Jōmon remains. These resemble , but more recent scholarship indicates that these early Jōmon may have simply had a decorative function, and have no relationship to . in the Jōmon period appear to have moved from the purely decorative to having a status and ceremonial function by the end of the period. A &quot;middle Jōmon exchange network&quot; may have existed, whereby were produced in regions where materials for their manufacture were readily plentiful. Jade and talc examples produced in bead-making villages located in present-day Itoigawa, Niigata have been found at a large number of sites along the northern coast, in the central mountains, and in Kantō region.

===Archaeological sites (Jōmon)===
Examples of from the Jōmon period have been discovered in large numbers at the Kamegaoka site in Tsugaru, Aomori Prefecture. The Kamegaoka remains are among the largest known Jōmon settlement in Japan, and the , among other decorative objects found, may be an indicator of the high social status of the settlement.

Other sites associated with the Kamegaoka settlement have yielded , including the Ōboriya shell mound, in the northwest corner of Ōfunato Bay, which yielded a huge number of beads, as well as the Korekawa site, near Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture. Remains from the Korekawa site can be seen at the Korekawa Archaeological Museum in Hachinohe. Stone and clay and -like beads have also been discovered at the Amataki site, Ninohe, Iwate Prefecture, Osagata site, Ibaraki Prefecture, and the Kou site, Fujiidera, Osaka Prefecture. Numerous at the Ōishi site, Bungo-ōno, Ōita Prefecture, Kyushu show signs of being used for ceremonial, rather than decorative, purposes.

The Sannai-Maruyama Site, excavated 1992 in Aomori, Aomori Prefecture, yielded three large jade beads measuring .

==Yayoi period==
 in the Yayoi period (300 BCE – 300 CE) are notably different from Jōmon-period . The jewels moved from a primitive, non-standard form towards more polished and uniform form in this period. The technology to cut large gemstones and polish jewels notably advanced in the Yayoi period. Refined materials such as jadeite, serpentinite, and glass replaced the less sophisticated materials of the Jōmon period. Yayoi period are noted for their reverse C-shaped form, which by the end of the period had become an almost squared shape. From the Yayoi period onwards, uniformly feature a bored hole that allowed the jewels to be held on a string.

The Yayoi period is marked by specific geographic centers specializing in and the widespread trade of . The period is marked by the formation of power centers that came to be individual states. The development of weapons increased in this period to protect increasingly developed rice fields and fishing rights. Trade greatly increased in this period, as did the specialization of production of certain items, including . producing areas exchanged their product with other products, specifically rice, leading to the widespread distribution of across Japan. were commonly used to create necklaces and bracelets worn on the wrists or ankles. The necklace was typically constructed of jadeite separated by cylindrical bored-holed pieces of jasper. Small beads of dark-blue glass are also not uncommon on the necklace. The bracelet typically also used shells from the coastal areas of Shikoku and the Inland Sea, wood, and bronze. In this period the use of the mirror, sword, and jewels as status symbols for village, and later regional leaders of all kinds, emerged in the Yayoi period, and point to the origin of the mirror, sword, and as the Imperial Regalia of Japan.

The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the earliest historical document with a reference to Japan, describes the Wa people, an ancient country of Yamatai, and its queen, Himiko. The &quot;Record&quot; indicates that when Himiko died, her relative Iyo, a girl of 13, was made queen and sent a delegation of twenty officials under Yazuku, an imperial general, to offer tribute to the Northern Wei court. &quot;The delegation visited the capital and offered to the court five thousand white gems and two pieces of carved jade, as well as twenty pieces of brocade with variegated designs.&quot; The carved jade in the &quot;Record&quot; likely describes a tribute of two jade .

===Archaeological sites (Yayoi)===
The large-scale Yayoi period remains at the Yoshinogari site, Yoshinogari and Kanzaki in Saga Prefecture revealed examples of lead glass typical of the Yayoi period. In 2003, the excavation of a large Yayoi period settlement in Tawaramoto, Nara also revealed two large jade , one , the second in length. The larger Tawaramoto is the 10th-largest example found to date in Japan. Both jade from the site are of unusually high-quality brilliant green jade.

One known center of Yayoi production was in the area of the Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine in Osaka. literally means &quot;jewel making&quot;, and a guild, the Tamatsukuri-be, was active from the Yayoi period. An existing jewel at the shrine is said to have great spiritual power. appear on all sorts of implements of the present-day temple, including amulets, roof tiles, and lanterns. The inari female fox at the gate of a subshrine of Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine wears a necklace of . The shrine has an exhibit on the history and production of .

==Kofun period==

 became very common in the Kofun period (250–536 CE), and by the end of the period almost all tumuli contained . In the early Kofun period, were made from jadeite as in earlier periods, but by the middle of the period were made from jasper, and by the end of the period, almost exclusively of agate and jade. capped by silver or gold also appear towards the end of the period. Large made of talc, imitations of smaller ones made of more precious materials, were used as grave goods. are found in tumuli across Japan from the period. Their use went from merely decorative to sacred and ceremonial grave goods. are with inscriptions that look like flowers of the clove tree and have a hole suitable to attach to a string. These first appear in the Kofun period. Also in the Kofun period, appear on necklaces, with several set between bored cylinders. Archeological remains show evidence of similar ankle bracelets, but they are less common. Clay funerary objects of the Kofun period commonly depict people wearing the necklaces and ankle bracelets.

===Archaeological sites (Kofun)===
Examples of stone from the Kofun period are especially numerous. An excavation of the Kamegaoka , Kishiwada, Osaka, revealed a local who had been buried with a jade, jasper, and alabaster necklace, as well as placed near the feet. A bronze mirror imported from China accompanying the burial was dated to 239 CE. The is a Designated Historical Spot of the city of Kishiwada. Ceremonial offerings from a burial from the Kisami-Araida area of Shimoda, Shizuoka also revealed clay reproductions of used as effigies. The excavation of the Ubusuna in Kyōtango, Kyoto yielded two fully intact necklaces of jade and agate, with segments between in length.

The large Muro Miyayama of Katsuragi, Nara, on the Yamato Plain, in length, was plundered long before its excavation, but revealed 600 talc ceremonial among other funerary objects, which also included 10 bronze Han Chinese mirrors. The Hiraide remains of Shiojiri, Nagano, one of the three largest prehistoric sites in Japan, and far from any regional power center, includes typical Kofun period remains, but also objects associated with modern Shinto ceremonial practice. Nevertheless, in Hiraide reveal both plain and elaborate among other funerary objects.

The Sakurai in Sakurai, Nara, excavated in 1949, represents a from the final phase of the Kofun period, and is possibly from a ruler associated with the imperial family. The is high and shows evidence of being surrounded by a moat. Among the very large number of funerary objects were high-quality weapons, including swords, 10 mirrors, and a necklace of jadeite , agate cylinders, and glass beads used to make a -style necklace.

== Origin of magatama forms ==
Archaeologists and historians are unable yet to explain what the origins of forms are, or whether these forms can be traced back to one convergent source. A number of explanations have been suggested, including:

* They may be fashioned after animal fangs/teeth
* They may be modeled after the shape of fetuses
* They may be symbolic of the shape of the soul
* They may be modeled after the shape of the moon
* That there is meaning and connotation attached to the shape of the itself (i.e. meaning comes from the form itself, and not that has been patterned after anything else)

==In Japanese mythology==
The and , completed in the 8th century, have numerous references to . They appear in the first chapter of the , which largely describes the mythology of Japan. Susanoo, god of the sea and storms, received five hundred from Tamanoya no mikoto, or Ame-no-Futodama-no-mikoto, the jewel-making deity. Susanoo went to heaven and presented them to his sister, the sun goddess Amaterasu, who bit off successive parts of the , and blew them away to create other deities. Tamanoya no mikoto remains the god of , glasses, and cameras. In the legend Amaterasu later shuts herself in a cave. Ama-no-Koyane-no-mikoto hung , among other objects, on a five hundred-branch tree, to successfully lure Amaterasu from the cave. In the year 58, in the reign of the Emperor Suinin, the records that a dog killed and disemboweled a (badger), and a was discovered in its stomach. This was presented to Suinin, who enshrined it at Isonokami Shrine, where it is said to presently reside. A similar practice is described again in the during the reign of the Emperor Chūai. Chūai made an inspection trip to the Tsukushi, or Kyūshū, and was presented with an enormous tree hung with as well as other sacred objects.

=== Yasakani no Magatama===
A noted is the , one of the three Imperial Regalia of Japan. Swords, mirrors, and jewels were common objects of status for regional rulers in Japan as early as the Yayoi period, and were further widespread in the Kofun period, as shown by their ubiquitous presence in kofun tumuli. The is stored at the , the central shrine of the Three Palace Sanctuaries at the Tokyo Imperial Palace, and is used in the enthronement ceremony of the Emperor of Japan.

Daniel Clarence Holtom stated in 1928 in &quot;Japanese enthronement ceremonies; with an account of the imperial regalia&quot; that the is the only one of the three regalia that is used in its original form for ceremonies, preferring the use of replicas for the sword and mirror due to its delicate fragility. Replicas of the sword and mirror were made as early as the 9th century, and the originals were entrusted to other shrines.

==Usage in Ryūkyūan religion==
D. C. Holtom stated that priestesses (Okinawan: ) of the Ryukyu Kingdom wore necklaces early in the 20th century for ceremonial purposes, but provides no other details.

== In popular culture ==
In &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, the Amber Relics, Dusk Relics, and Secret Stones are all based on the magatama.

In the &quot;Ace Attorney&quot; series, a magatama is frequently cited as the source of an ability that lets its wearer determine people&#x27;s true intentions.

In &quot;Unconnected Marketeers&quot;, the 18th installment of &quot;Touhou Project&quot;, the character Misumaru Tamatsukuri is able to craft magatama. Aunn Komano, introduced in the 16th installment, &quot;Hidden Star in Four Seasons&quot;, has her ears designed in the shape of magatama.

In &quot;Blue Eye Samurai&quot;, the main character Mizu wore a blue magatama on her katana.

In &quot;&quot;, the Kwagatama charms named after the magatama serve as a symbol of a bond between the kwami and their holder.

In &quot;Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne&quot;, magatamas appear in the form of parasitic, insect-like creatures that grant their human hosts special, demonic powers.

In &quot;&quot;, magatamas are made of jade and are used for upgrading Akito&#x27;s abilities. They can be obtained through side missions (37), and street stalls (three).

In &quot;Ōkami&quot; and its sequel &quot;Ōkamiden&quot;, one of the weapon options (rosaries) are based on Amaterasu&#x27;s magatama.

In &quot;The Irregular at Magic High School&quot;, magatama are a class of magical Relics with the ability to store magic sequences.

In &quot;Blue Seed&quot;, magatama are used as vessels to contain mitama which bestow power to those implanted with them. The series&#x27; plot is based on the Izumo cycle from Japanese mythology.

In &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, Sailor Uranus&#x27; Space Sword, Sailor Neptune&#x27;s Deep Aqua Mirror, and Sailor Pluto&#x27;s Garnet Orb are based on each item.

In the Japanese card game “Yu-Gi-Oh!”, “Hu-Li the Jewel Mikanko” is based on the “Yasakani no Magatama” - one of the “Three Imperial Regalia of Japan”.

In the anime and manga Toilet-Bound Hanako Kun the protagonist, Nene Yashiro, wears Magatama in her hair.

<text>Stephen Michael James Ovett, (; born 9 October 1955) is a retired British track athlete. A middle-distance runner, he was the gold medalist in the 800 metres at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow. Ovett set five world records for 1500 metres and the mile run, and a world best at two miles. He won 45 consecutive 1500 and mile races from 1977 to 1980.

==Early life==
Born in Brighton, Sussex, and educated at Varndean Grammar School, Ovett was a talented teenage athlete. As a youngster, he showed great promise as a footballer, but gave it up for athletics, because he preferred individual rather than team sports. As a youngster he won the under-15 (Junior boys) English Schools&#x27; Athletics Championships title at 400 metres in 1970 and the under-17 (Intermediate boys) 800 metres title in 1972.

==Athletics career==

===Early promise===
Ovett&#x27;s first major athletics title came in 1973, when he won the 800 metres at the 1973 European Athletics Junior Championships. The following year, still only aged 18, he won the silver medal at 800 metres in the 1974 European Athletics Championships, setting a new European Junior 800m record of 1:45.77 in the process. Ovett won AAA titles in the 800m from 1974 to 1976; he would later add to these AAA titles by winning the 1500m in 1979 and the mile in 1980.

Ovett gained some Olympic experience in 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, when he ran in the final of the 800m and was placed fifth, behind winner Alberto Juantorena of Cuba. Ovett finished fifth because he ran the first lap too inconsistently. He failed to reach the 1500 m final, having been obstructed in the semi-final when Canadian athlete Dave Hill fell and Ovett had to hurdle over him. As this happened 170m from the finish, Ovett had little time to recover, and was out-sprinted to the line by fellow countryman, Dave Moorcroft, with Ovett finishing only sixth.

===Breakthrough to world prominence===
In 1977, Ovett began to regularly defeat the 1500 metres Olympic champion John Walker. In the early season Debenhams Mile, Ovett defeated Walker and set a British record of 3:54.7. Then in the European Cup 1500m, Ovett produced a last lap of 52.4 seconds to win a fiercely competitive race just ahead of his friend and rival Thomas Wessinghage. At the inaugural IAAF World Cup in Athletics, he commenced a &quot;kick&quot; with 200m to go, running the final turn in 11.8 s and the last 200m in 25.1 s. He left John Walker and the rest of the field far behind. He won gold ahead of Wessinghage. As Ovett raced away from the field, Ron Pickering, commenting for the race on BBC Television, said &quot;and there&#x27;s one man&#x27;s blazing speed that has torn this field asunder&quot;. Ovett&#x27;s time of 3:34.45 was a British record.

The British public by now showed a keen interest in Ovett, and it was at the European Championships in 1978, that he raced against Sebastian Coe for the first time in their senior careers, beginning a rivalry that was widely covered. He led Coe in the 800m and appeared to be on his way to gold, before being caught by the East German Olaf Beyer, whose time of 1:44:09 turned out to be his fastest ever 800m run. Coe finished 3rd. At the time the British press reported that Coe and Ovett had clashed after the race but Coe later revealed: &quot;When Steve came over, he put his hand on my shoulder and said something. The media thought we were having a row, but what Steve actually said was, &#x27;Who the fuck was that?&#x27;&quot; Ovett recovered to win the gold medal in the 1500m, in which Coe did not participate. In that race, Ovett waved to the crowd on the home straight and clearly slowed down in the last metres yet still won by over a second from Ireland&#x27;s Eamonn Coghlan.

In 1978, Ovett set extremely fast times at disparate distances. He ran an 800m in 1:44.09 (the world record at the time was Alberto Juantorena&#x27;s 1:43.44) and set a 2-mile world&#x27;s best with 8:13.51, handing &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; Athlete of the Year Henry Rono one of his few losses in his record-breaking season.

During his career, Ovett was noted for the unusual range of his races; shortly before the 1980 Olympics, he ran four events of four different lengths in 10 days: a mile in Oslo, 800 metres in Gothenburg, 600m at Crystal Palace and 3,000m in Welwyn Garden City. In 1977, when an airline strike forced him to miss a scheduled event, he signed up at the last minute for the Dartford half-marathon and won it with ease, wearing borrowed shoes, in a time of 1:05:38, running a course more than twice as long as anything he had attempted in public before, against the British marathon champion.

Ovett arrived at the 1980 Moscow Olympics as favourite to take the 1500 m title, being unbeaten over the 1500 m and the mile for three years. Earlier that month, he had established a new mile world record of 3:48.8 and two weeks later equalled Sebastian Coe&#x27;s world record of 3:32.1 in the 1500 m. The Moscow Olympics marked only the second time that Ovett and Coe had met each other in international competition (the first being the 800 m in the 1978 European Championships), and there was huge media speculation over which would emerge as the greater.

Ovett&#x27;s participation in the 800 m would serve as a test for the 1500 m. In the 800 m final, Ovett was only in sixth place at the halfway mark, but pushed his way through the crowd to second place. Seventy metres from the line, Ovett took the lead and held off a challenge from Coe to win by four metres. In the 1500 m, contested six days later, Ovett ran close behind Coe&#x27;s shoulder for most of the race, but on the final bend Coe made a strong &#x27;kick&#x27; and Ovett dropped two metres behind, unable to close the gap in the home straight. Coe won gold, East Germany&#x27;s Jürgen Straub, who had accelerated after 800 metres, held off Ovett for the silver medal, and Ovett had to settle for bronze.

Though in 1980 Ovett had tied Coe&#x27;s 1500 m world record of 3:32.1, new timing rules came into effect in 1981, which would recognise records over 400 m to the hundredth of a second. This would have the effect of giving Coe sole possession of the record, as Coe ran 3:32.03 to Ovett&#x27;s 3:32.09. However, Ovett avoided this unusual removal of a record via rule change by setting a new record later in 1980 of 3:31.36.

During 1981, both Ovett and Coe were at their peak. They did not meet in a race that year but exchanged world records in the mile three times during a 9-day period. Ovett suffered an upset in a 1500m race in Oslo that year. With Ovett and Coe so dominant and Coe not involved in the race, Ovett was the strong favourite. During the race Tom Byers, who had been asked to act as a pacemaker set off quickly and the pack, being given the split times for the leader and believing that they were going faster than they actually were, declined to follow his pace. As a result, by the start of the last lap Byers had a lead of almost ten seconds and so decided to finish the race. Ovett ran the last lap almost nine seconds quicker than Byers but finished second by 0.53s, later commenting &quot;We all ran like a load of hacks.&quot;

Ovett&#x27;s 1982 season was wrecked by injury. When out training on the streets of Brighton in late 1981, he tripped and impaled his thigh on some low railings at St John the Baptist Church on Church Road. He had recovered by the spring of 1982, but further injuries hampered his progress.

===Later career===
He returned to action in 1983, although once again his season had been hampered by injuries, which resulted in his not being selected for the 800 m at the World Championships in Helsinki. He was selected for the 1500 m, but ran a poor tactical race in the final and finished 4th, behind winner Steve Cram. He was yet to reach his peak for 1983, which followed with a 1500 m world record of 3:30.77 in Rieti. A few days later, he finished a close 2nd to Steve Cram in an epic mile race in Crystal Palace.

In 1984, after a successful season of winter training in Australia, Ovett&#x27;s progress was slightly hampered by minor injuries and a bout of bronchitis. He attempted to defend his 800 m title in the 1984 Olympic Games, but after arriving in Los Angeles he began to suffer from respiratory problems. He was unlucky to be drawn against eventual winner Joaquim Cruz in each of his two heats and also the semi-final, in which he only narrowly qualified for the final, lunging for the finish in 4th place and appearing to collapse over the line. He had run 1:44:81, his second fastest time ever at the distance. He recovered in time to make the final, but was clearly below his best and finished eighth, after which he collapsed and spent two nights in hospital. Against the advice of his friends and doctors, he returned a few days later to compete in the 1500 m. Running in fourth place at the beginning of the last lap of the final, Ovett dropped out. He later collapsed with chest pains and was taken away on a stretcher.

His career then wound down, although in August 1986 he won the 5000 m at the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. However, the following month, in the European Championships, he failed to finish in hot conditions, allowing Jack Buckner (GB) - whom Ovett had beaten with consummate ease in Edinburgh - to win the gold. In the 1987 World Athletics Championships, he finished a lacklustre tenth in the 5000-metres final. He then failed to make the 1988 Olympic team and finally announced his retirement in 1991, a year after Sebastian Coe.

==Post-retirement==
He has been a track and field television commentator for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation since 1992. He now lives in Australia and was a part of the BBC&#x27;s on-location commentary team for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.

In 1987 a bronze statue of Steve Ovett was erected in Preston Park, Brighton. However, it was stolen in 2007, and later replaced in 2012 with a copy of the original. (The replacement is in Madeira Drive.)

==Personal life==
During the Moscow Games, the British press homed in on a signal Ovett had made to a television camera in Moscow, after his 800m win. It later transpired that the signal represented the letters ILY (I love you) and were intended for his girlfriend, Rachel Waller (whom he later married, but from whom he is now divorced).

His brother, Nick Ovett, represented Great Britain at luge in the Winter Olympics of 1988 and 1992.

Ovett&#x27;s son Freddy also showed promise as a middle distance runner, winning the U-13 Pan-Pacific 800m title, before switching to road cycling after sustaining a knee injury whilst at the University of Oregon. He joined the development squad of the French team in 2015.

<text>Alessandro &quot;Sandro&quot; Pertini (; 25 September 1896 – 24 February 1990) was an Italian socialist politician and statesman who served as President of Italy from 1978 to 1985.

==Early life==
Born in Stella (province of Savona) as the son of a wealthy landowner, Alberto, he studied at a Salesian college in Varazze, and completed his schooling at the Chiabrera lyceum (high school) in Savona.

His philosophy teacher was Adelchi Baratono, a reformist socialist who contributed to his approach to socialism and probably introduced him to the inner circles of the Ligurian labour movements. Pertini obtained a law degree from the University of Genoa.

Aged 19 when Italy entered World War I on the side of the Triple Entente, Pertini opposed the war, but nonetheless enlisted in the army where he served as a lieutenant and was decorated for bravery. After the armistice in 1918, he joined the Unitary Socialist Party, PSU, then he settled in Florence where he also graduated in political science with a thesis entitled &quot;La Cooperazione&quot; (&quot;Cooperation&quot;; 1924). While in the city, Pertini also came into contact with people such as Gaetano Salvemini, the brothers Carlo and Nello Rosselli, and Ernesto Rossi. Pertini was physically beaten by Fascist squads on several occasions, but never lost faith in his ideals.

==Opposition to Fascism and Resistance to Nazism==

After the assassination of PSU leader Giacomo Matteotti by Fascists in 1924, Pertini became even more committed to the struggle against the totalitarian regime. In 1926, he was sentenced to internment but managed to go into hiding. Later, together with Carlo Rosselli and Ferruccio Parri, he organized and accompanied the escape to France of Filippo Turati, who was the most prominent figure of the PSU. Pertini remained in the country until 1926 working as a mason. According to the Italian historian of Freemasonry Aldo Alessandro Mola, during that period Pertini had relationships with exponents of the Grand Orient of Italy who were in exile in France. This hypothesis seems unsupported by known documents from archives. On his return to Italy, he was arrested in Pisa, tried, and sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment.

In 1935 he was interned on Santo Stefano Island, Ventotene (LT), Pontine Islands, an island in the Tyrrhenian Sea, where he remained through Italy&#x27;s entry into World War II and until 1943. Although he had begun suffering from severe illness, Pertini never demanded pardon. He was released a month after Benito Mussolini&#x27;s arrest and joined the Italian resistance movement against the Nazi German occupiers and Mussolini&#x27;s new regime – the Italian Social Republic. Arrested by the Germans, he was sentenced to death but freed by a partisan raid. Pertini then travelled north to organize partisan war as an executive member of PSI (alongside Rodolfo Morandi and Lelio Basso). He had a primary role in the Milan uprising of 25 April 1945, which led to the execution of Mussolini.

==Prominence==
After the war ended in Italy on 25 April 1945 and the monarchy was abolished through the 1946 Italian constitutional referendum, Pertini was elected to the Constituent Assembly (&quot;La Costituente&quot;), the body that prepared the new republican Italian Constitution. In the postwar era, he was a prominent member of the directive board of the Italian Socialist Party (the PSI, which the PSU had rejoined).

In spite of his intransigent attitude toward the Italian Communist Party, Pertini was suspicious of many policies enforced by the PSI. He criticized all forms of colonialism, as well as corruption in the Italian state and within the Socialist Party, where he kept an independent political position.

He was elected president of the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1968.

==President (1978–1985)==

In 1978, the 81-year-old Pertini was elected President of the Italian Republic, the highest office in the nation. Despite his advanced age, he displayed considerable energy and vigour, playing a major role in helping restore the public&#x27;s faith in the government and institutions of Italy, as well as maintaining an active schedule of travelling and meeting foreign dignitaries. During the Brigate Rosse terrorism period of the &quot;Anni di piombo&quot;, Pertini openly denounced the violence. He also opposed organized crime in Italy, South African apartheid, Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and other dictatorial regimes, as well as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

In 1981, Pertini presided over the formation of the government by Giovanni Spadolini, the first non Christian Democratic Italian government since the time of De Gasperi.

In 1985, he stepped down from the presidency, becoming automatically senator for life. The only official role he accepted in his retirement was President of the &quot;Filippo Turati&quot; Foundation for Historical Studies of Florence inaugurated in 1985 and dedicated to recording and preserving the history of the socialist movement in Italy. In December 1988 Pertini was the first person to be awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal in Gold by the United Nations Association of Germany (Deutsche Gesellschaft für die Vereinten Nationen, DGVN) in Berlin, &quot;for outstanding services to peace and international understanding, especially for his political ethics and practical humanity&quot;. Pertini died in February 1990 at the age of 93 and was mourned across the nation.

==1982 World Cup Final==
Pertini attended the 1982 World Cup Final in Madrid for a match between Italy and West Germany just two days after the fourth anniversary of his inauguration. After Italy scored their third goal, he wagged his finger to either the German delegation or King Juan Carlos I, and said &quot;they [the German team] will not catch us any more&quot;. Memorable images from the event are Pertini standing on his chair at Santiago Bernabeu stadium, exulting in the Italian victory, and the card game on the return flight, between the president and three team members (trainer Bearzot and players Causio and Zoff), the world cup trophy next to them on the table.

Paolo Rossi, Italy&#x27;s and the tournament&#x27;s top scorer, later said: &quot;I remember that when he welcomed us at the Presidential Palace after our win, he rose and said: &#x27;This is my best day as President.&#x27;&quot;

==Relationship with Pope John Paul II==

Sandro Pertini had a close friendship with Pope John Paul II, with whom he met often both for official and private occasions, and had frequent phone conversations. In &quot;Accanto a Giovanni Paolo II&quot;, he is known to have referred to his mother looking over him in heaven, moved that her atheist son was friends with the Pope.

On 13 May 1981, he went to the Gemelli Hospital as soon as he heard that the Pope had been shot, and stayed until late in the night when he was told that the Pope was not in danger anymore. He recalled the event later that year in the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve Presidential Address to the Italian People.

==Honours and awards==
In 1986, he received the Freedom medal. On 11 October 1979, President of Yugoslavia Tito awarded Pertini the Order of the Yugoslav Great Star.

==In popular culture==
In the 1975 film &quot;Last Days of Mussolini&quot; by Carlo Lizzani, there is a character inspired by Pertini, performed by Sergio Graziani. In early 1980s, Andrea Pazienza created the comic book series &quot;Il Partigiano Pert&quot; (&quot;The Partisan Pert&quot;), a comedy strip portraying Pertini during World War II with the same cartoonist as his helper.

Pertini has been mentioned in some verses of several Italian songs, as in &quot;Sotto la pioggia&quot; (&quot;under the rain&quot;, 1982) by Antonello Venditti, &quot;Babbo Rock&quot; (&quot;Daddy Rock&quot;, 1982) by the Skiantos, &quot;L&#x27;Italiano&quot; (&quot;The Italian&quot;, 1983) by Toto Cutugno, &quot;Caro Presidente&quot; (&quot;Dear President&quot;, 1984) by Daniele Shook, &quot;Pertini Dance&quot; (1984) by the S.C.O.R.T.A., &quot;Pertini Is A Genius, Mirinzini Is Not Famous&quot; (2007) by the Ex-Otago.

<text>Norman DeValois Dicks (born December 16, 1940) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the U.S. representative for , between 1977 and 2013. He is a member of the Democratic Party. His district was located in the northwestern corner of the state, and includes most of Tacoma. He retired at the end of the 112th Congress. He currently serves as Senior Policy Advisor at the law and public policy firm Van Ness Feldman LLP. He is the longest-serving member ever of the United States House of Representatives from the state of Washington.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Norm Dicks was born and raised in Bremerton, Washington. His family attended Our Saviour&#x27;s Lutheran Church in Bremerton, and he was confirmed there as a teenager. He attended the University of Washington, where he was a linebacker on the Huskies football team and was a member of Sigma Nu fraternity. He earned a B.A. and a J.D. degree there.

After college, he became legislative and administrative assistant to long-serving U.S. Senator Warren G. Magnuson of Washington.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1976, incumbent Democrat U.S. Representative Floyd Hicks decided to retire to run for a Washington State Supreme Court seat. Dicks qualified for the general election via the blanket primary and won the general election with 74% of the vote against Republican nominee Rob Reynolds. He won re-election 17 more times and only got less than 58% of the vote in a November general election once (1980). That year, he defeated Republican nominee Jim Beaver 54% to 46%, the lowest winning percentage and margin of victory in his career. His second lowest general election winning percentage is 58%, in 1994 and 2010 (both years when Republicans took back the majority).

===Tenure===
Elected to the House in 1976, he won a coveted seat on the House Appropriations Committee in his first term. He became a &quot;powerful . . . senior Democrat&quot; on that committee. He also served for 8 years on the House Intelligence Committee. As a member of Congress, he was known as a close friend of Al Gore.

On March 28, 1981, Norm Dicks attended the christening of the USS Bremerton (SSN 698) along with U.S. Senator Henry M. Jackson.

On October 10, 2002, Norm Dicks was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq but later changed his position and supports an end to the war. With Boeing a major employer in Washington, Dicks has also supported the acquisition of military aircraft on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.

On October 22, 2004, Dicks cut the ribbon during the dedication ceremony for the Norm Dicks Government Center in Bremerton, Washington. On June 9, 2007, he presented the 132nd commencement speech at the University of Washington. Recently, Congressman Dicks was given the 2008 Ansel Adams Conservation Award by The Wilderness Society, and in 2010, Congressman Dicks was the first recipient of Washington non-profit Long Live the King&#x27;s annual Lifetime Achievement Award in Salmon Conservation.

In June 2007, Dicks expressed support for a House of Representatives bill that would increase funding for environmental protection, national parks and conservation by approximately $1.2 billion. In support of the bill, he said &quot;The Bush administration has cut the Interior Department budget over the last six to seven years by 16 percent...&quot;It has cut EPA by 29 percent. It has cut the Forest Service by 35 percent. It has devastated these agencies...We are trying to turn the corner, to bring these agencies back&quot;.
In 2008 the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation awarded Congressman Dicks its Naval Heritage Award for his support of the U S Navy and military during his terms in Congress on the Appropriations Committee.

On May 8, 2008, Norm Dicks voted yes on H.R. 4279: Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2007, sometimes called the PRO-IP Act. The PRO-IP Act increases both civil and criminal penalties for trademark and copyright infringement. It has created a new executive branch office, the Office of the United States Intellectual Property Enforcement Representative (USIPER). In addition to fines, preliminary punishments involve the seizing of unlicensed copies and the devices on which the copies are stored.

On June 20, 2008, Representative Dicks voted yes on the controversial FISA Amendments Act of 2008. The bill would provide for AT&amp;T, Verizon Communications and other U.S. telecommunications companies against 40 lawsuits alleging that they violated customers&#x27; privacy rights by helping the government&#x27;s NSA electronic surveillance program conduct a warrantless spying program after the September 11th attacks.

The bill also sought to:

*Require FISA court permission to wiretap Americans who are overseas.
*Prohibit targeting a foreigner to secretly eavesdrop on an American&#x27;s calls or e-mails without court approval.
*Allow the FISA court 30 days to review existing but expiring surveillance orders before renewing them.
*Allow eavesdropping in emergencies without court approval, provided the government files required papers within a week.
*Prohibit the government from invoking war powers or other authorities to supersede surveillance rules in the future.
===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Appropriations (Ranking Member)
**As ranking member of the full committee, Rep. Dicks may sit as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees.
**Subcommittee on Defense (Ranking Member)

===Caucus memberships===
*International Conservation Caucus (Co-Chair)
*Sportsmen&#x27;s Caucus
*Congressional Arts Caucus

==Retirement and ongoing civic engagement==
When deciding to retire from Congress in 2012, Dicks said his biggest regret was voting for the Iraq War. &quot;I&#x27;m still glad Saddam Hussein is not there, but I feel we were misled, not intentionally misled, but we were not given accurate information, and if we had known Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction, I don&#x27;t think Congress would even have been asked to vote on that.&quot;
In 2013, the former congressman joined the board of the Seattle non-profit Long Live the Kings as an Ambassador to a new U.S./Canada partnership, the Salish Sea Marine Survival project, stating that: &quot;Efforts like the joint US/Canada Salish Sea Marine Survival Project promise to fundamentally change our knowledge about salmon and steelhead in saltwater; filling a crucial information-gap that has inhibited the progress of recovery.&quot; In 2014, Dicks was elected to the board of directors of the National Bureau of Asian Research.

<doc id="412074" wikidata="Q695221" url="?curid=412074" title="Mount Abu">
<text>Mount Abu () is a hill station in the Aravalli Range in the Sirohi district of the state of Rajasthan in western India. Here, the mountain forms a rocky plateau 22 km long by 9 km wide. It is referred to as &#x27;an oasis in the desert&#x27; as its heights are home to rivers, lakes, waterfalls and evergreen forests. It is also home to numerous Hindu and Jain temples.

==History==
The ancient name of Mount Abu is Arbuda. In the Puranas, the region has been referred to as &quot;Arbudaranya&quot; (&quot;forest of &quot;Arbuda&quot;&quot;) and &#x27;Abu&#x27; is a diminutive of this ancient name. It is believed that sage Vashistha retired to the southern spur at Mount Abu following his differences with sage Vishvamitra. There is another history story according to which a serpent named &quot;Arbuda&quot; saved the life of Nandi (Lord Shiva&#x27;s bull). The incident happened on the mountain that is currently known as Mount Abu and so the mountain is named &quot;Arbudaranya&quot; after that incident which gradually became Abu.

According to a legend, the sage Vashistha performed a yajna at the peak of Mount Abu, to seek from the gods a provision for the defense of righteousness on earth. In answer to his prayer, a youth arose from the Agnikunda (fire-altar) — the first Agnivansha. Achalgarh Fort is one of more attractive place which was built by Parmar kings. The Dilwara Jain Temple is a pilgrimage centre for the Jain religion among the lush green hills of Aravali. The Dilwara Jain Temple is located at a distance of 2.5 km from Mount Abu. Vastupala designed the temple. Vimal Shah built it between the 11th century and the 13th century. The complex is sculpted on white marble in every corner of the temple.

The conquest of Mount Abu in 1311 CE by Rao Lumba of the Deora-Chauhan dynasty. He shifted the capital city to Chandravati in the plains. After the destruction of Chandravati in 1405, Rao Shasmal made Sirohi his headquarters. Later it was leased by the British government from the Maharaja of Sirohi for use as the headquarters.

The Arbuda Mountains region is said to be original abode of the famous gurus like Atri and Vashishtha. The association of the Gurus with the mountain is noticed in many inscriptions and epigraphs including &quot;Tilakamanjari&quot; of Dhanpala. According to one theory, this Gurdhara or land of the gurus got corrupted with time and became Gurjara.

A municipality was established at Abu in 1864; it had six members nominated by the Agent to the Governor General (AGG).

==Tourism==

Mount Abu town, the only hill station in Rajasthan, is at an elevation of . It has been a popular retreat from the heat of Rajasthan and neighboring Gujarat for centuries.

The mountain is home to several Hindu temples, including the Adhar Devi Temple (also known as Arbuda Devi Temple), carved out of the solid rock; the Shri Raghunathji Temple; and a shrine and temple to Dattatreya built atop the Guru Shikhar peak; and the Achaleshwar Mahadev Temple (1412).

The Achalgarh Fort, built in the 14th century by Kumbha of Mewar, is nearby and at its center is the popular visitor attraction of the Nakki Lake. The Toad Rock is on a hill near the lake. Close to the fort is the Achaleshwar Mahadev Temple, a popular Shiva temple. Also, Achal Fort Jain Temple, Shantinath Jain Temple (1513) is equally famous.

The Durga Ambika Mata Temple lies in a cleft of rock in Jagat, just outside Mount Abu town.

The mountain is also the home to a number of Jain temples including Dilwara Temples, a complex of temples carved out of white marble. The Dilwara Temples or Delvada Temples are located about 2½ kilometers from the Mount Abu town. These Jain temples were built by Vimal Shah and designed by Vastupala, Jain ministers of Dholka, between the 11th and 16th centuries and are famous for their use of white marble and intricate marble carvings. They are a pilgrimage place of the Jains, and a popular general tourist attraction. The temples have an opulent entranceway, the simplicity in architecture reflecting Jain values like honesty and frugality. Minutely-carved ornamental detail covers the ceilings, doorways, pillars, and panels.
The temple complex is in the midst of a range of forested hills. There are five temples in all, each with its own unique identity. All five temples are enclosed within a single high walled compound. The group is named after the small village of Dilwara or Delvara in which they are located. The five temples are:
*Vimal Vasahi, dedicated to the first Jain Tirthankara, Shri Rishabhadev.
*Luna Vasahi, dedicated to the 22nd Jain Tirthankara, Shri Neminatha.
*Pittalhar, dedicated to the first Jain Tirthankar, Shri Rishabhadev.
*Parshvanath, dedicated to the 23rd Jain Tirthankara, Shri Parshvanatha.
*Mahavir Swami, dedicated to the last Jain Tirthankara, Shri Mahaviraswami.

Among all the five legendary marble temples of Dilwara, the most famous of those are the Vimal Vasahi and the Luna Vasahi temples.

In Mount Abu, the faith community of Brahma Kumaris has its spiritual headquarters, which are represented by its own account in 110 countries. Every year about 2.5 million visitors are supposed to visit the sprawling campus of that spiritual movement. The Brahma Kumaris ashram has a museum that displays the knowledge that Lord Shiva gave to the Prajapita Brahma. The 50-acre land also provides ample space for meditation and spiritual learning as well as to connect yourself to the stunning, undisturbed natural surroundings.

The Mount Abu Wildlife Sanctuary was established in 1960 and covers 290 km2 of the mountain. The sanctuary encircles the town, and sloth bears from the sanctuary have habitually been seen inside the city throughout the year foraging on hotel waste in open rubbish bins.

==In literature==
&quot;Arbuda Mountains&quot; is a mountain range described in the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. It is identified to be Mount Abu. This mountain is mentioned in the travels of Arjuna during his twelve-year pilgrimage.

Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poem &quot;Hindoo Temples on the Mountain-Lake of Aboo&quot;, published in &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book&quot;, 1839, is a reflection on this mountain fastness.
==Climate==
The average annual precipitation of Mount Abu is 1554 mm.

===Monsoon===
Due to its altitude, Mount Abu gets more rain compared to most of Rajasthan, with over 500 mm of rain falling in July and August. While it still has hot summers, the summers aren&#x27;t quite as hot as well due to the altitude, and the monsoon actually sees relatively comfortable temperatures (24-30 C). 

===Winter===

<text>Edward Alleyn (; 1 September 156621 November 1626) was an English actor who was a major figure of the Elizabethan theatre and founder of the College of God&#x27;s Gift in Dulwich.

==Early life==
Alleyn was born on 1 September 1566 in Bishopsgate, London; or so it was recorded in the &quot;Biographia Britannica&quot; as a product of Alleyn&#x27;s own writing. Alleyn does record his birth date in a diary several times but does not distinctly identify his birthplace as Bishopsgate. In the St. Botolph parish registers it is recorded that he was baptized on the day after his birth. He was born a younger son of Edward Alleyn with three brothers named John, William, and Edward. His father was an innkeeper and porter to Queen Elizabeth I and his mother, Margaret Townley, was the daughter of John Townley. His mother&#x27;s link to the Lancashire Townley family is somewhat of a mystery. Alleyn said she was the daughter of John Townley of Townley but the claim does not easily fit with the available information on the Townley family tree. Regardless of this, the road that passes Alleyn&#x27;s School was named after her in 1884. He was baptized at St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate. He was known to contemporaries as &quot;Ned&quot;; his surname is alternatively spelled Allen or Alleyne.

==Acting career==

Edward Alleyn was four years old when his father died. His mother remarried an actor named Brown. Alleyn, growing up in the home of an actor was believed to have been raised in the theatre culture.
It is not known at what date he began to act, but in 1583 his name was on the list of the Earl of Worcester&#x27;s players. He was rated by common consent as the foremost actor of his time; his only close rival was Richard Burbage.

He played the title roles in three of Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s major plays: &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;, &quot;Tamburlaine&quot;, and Barabas in &quot;The Jew of Malta&quot;. He created the parts, which were probably written especially for him. Edward Alleyn was known for his physical size and handling of commanding parts. The evidence for his stage career is otherwise fragmentary. Other parts thought to be associated with Alleyn are Orlando in Robert Greene&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, and perhaps Hieronymo in &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; by Thomas Kyd. Other works, some now lost, are thought to have had Alleyn in leading roles, including plays by George Peele such as &quot;The Battle of Alcazar&quot;. In a private letter, he mocked himself as a &#x27;fustian king&#x27;.

To illustrate Alleyn&#x27;s dedication, in 1593 Alleyn and the rest of his fellow players were touring the provinces of England, including more rural areas and were apparently not earning enough money worth the travelling. At that time, the bubonic plague was wreaking havoc in London, but Alleyn and the other players were willing to risk their health for the success of the troupe and perhaps, their personal financial stability by staying in London. This tour consisted of players from Lord Strange&#x27;s Men and the Admiral&#x27;s Men with which he was associated. The tour extended to Bristol, Shrewsbury, Chester, and York.

Alleyn retired at the height of his fame around 1598, and it is said that Queen Elizabeth requested his return to the stage, which he did in 1604, the year after her death. Ben Jonson bestowed praise on Alleyn&#x27;s acting. Thomas Nashe expressed in &quot;Pierce Penniless&quot; (1593) his admiration for him, in a quartet of English actors including also John Bentley, William Knell and the clown Richard Tarlton;&lt;/ref&gt; while Thomas Heywood calls him &quot;inimitable&quot;, &quot;the best of actors,&quot; &quot;Proteus for shapes and Roscius for a tongue.&quot; Thomas Fuller in his &quot;Worthies&quot; later wrote of Alleyn&#x27;s reputation of &quot;so acting to the life that he made any part to become him&quot;.

Although Alleyn had obtained a good amount of his fortune due to his marriage, he also made much of it from his acting career and owned a large estate in Sussex.

==Business==

Alleyn went into business with his father-in-law Philip Henslowe and became wealthy. He was part-owner in Henslowe&#x27;s ventures, and in the end sole proprietor of several profitable playhouses, bear-pits and other rental properties. Among them were the Rose Theatre at Bankside, the Paris Garden and the Fortune Theatre on Finsbury Fields. The Fortune was built for Alleyn and Henslowe in 1600, the year after the rival Globe Theatre was completed south of the river, by the same contractor Peter Street, but was square rather than round; it was occupied by the Admiral&#x27;s Men, of which Alleyn was the head.

He filled, in conjunction with Henslowe, the post of &quot;master of the king&#x27;s games of bears, bulls and dogs.&quot; On some occasions he directed the sport in person, and John Stow in his &quot;Chronicles&quot; gives an account of how Alleyn baited a lion before James I at the Tower of London.

==College founder==

Alleyn&#x27;s connection with Dulwich began in 1605, when he bought the manor of Dulwich from Sir Francis Calton. The landed property, of which the entire estate had not passed into Alleyn&#x27;s hands earlier than 1614, stretched from Sydenham Hill on whose summit now stands the Crystal Palace television transmission tower, to the crest of the parallel ridge, three miles nearer London, known in its several portions as Herne Hill, Denmark Hill and Champion Hill. Alleyn acquired this large property for little more than £35,000. He began the task of building and endowing the College of God&#x27;s Gift at Dulwich.

There is a legend associated with the founding of Dulwich which attributes Alleyn&#x27;s gift to an encounter with an apparition. English antiquarian John Aubrey was the first to record the legend, saying:

Mr. Alleyn, being a tragedian, and one of the original actors in many of the celebrated Shakespeare plays, in one of which he played a demon, with six others, surprised by an apparition of the devil, which so worked on his fancy that he made a vow, which he performed at this place (Dulwich College).

All was completed in 1617 except for the charter or deed of incorporation for setting his lands in mortmain. Delays occurred in the Star Chamber, where Lord Chancellor Bacon brought pressure to bear on Alleyn, with the aim of securing a portion of the proposed endowment for the maintenance of lectureships at Oxford and Cambridge. Bacon&#x27;s approach was in line with his skepticism about the impact of charitable foundations, compared to a scheme put forward by Sir Henry Savile and Sir Edwin Sandys that lacked funds. Alleyn finally carried his point and the College of God&#x27;s Gift at Dulwich was founded, and endowed under letters patent of James I, dated 21 June 1619. The construction of the school began in 1613.

It is said that Dulwich was built as a gesture of thanksgiving to God for Alleyn&#x27;s acting ability and success in business dealings. At the time of its founding, Alleyn was not a member of his own foundation, but guided and controlled its affairs under powers reserved for himself in the letters patent. His diary shows that he mixed much and intimately in the life of the college. He engaged the boys in occasional theatrical performances: at a festive gathering on 6 January 1622 &quot;the boyes play&#x27;d a playe.&quot;

In 1610 Alleyn was a member of the corporation of wardens of St Saviour&#x27;s, Southwark in which parish he founded almshouses in the &#x27;Soap Yard&#x27; next to an older foundation of Thomas Cure; he also contributed to the parish grammar school and both institutions still receive distributions from his Dulwich foundation.

In 1882 the College of God&#x27;s Gift was legally divided into three schools: Dulwich College, James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School and Alleyn&#x27;s School. Dulwich College has expanded internationally to China, Singapore, and South Korea.

==Marriages==
Alleyn inherited property in Bishopsgate from his father. He married Joan Woodward, stepdaughter of Philip Henslowe on 22 October 1592. She died on 28 June 1623. Woodward was buried in the Christ&#x27;s Chapel of God&#x27;s Gift. On 3 December that same year he married Constance, daughter of John Donne, the poet and dean of St Paul&#x27;s, though she was 37 years his junior, and he was older than her father. He had no children. Constance remarried in 1630, to Samuel Harvey.

==Death and memorial==

Alleyn died in November 1626 and was buried in the chapel of the college which he had founded, known as the Christ&#x27;s Chapel of God&#x27;s Gift. On 3 November, Alleyn wrote out his last will and testament. His gravestone fixes the day of his death as the 21st. He was buried on 25 November, in the church floor but his memorial stone was moved from the interior to exterior in 1925 to prevent further wear. His body still lies beneath the church floor.

There is a memorial window to him in the cathedral, which in his time was the parish church for both the borough and the Clink Liberty in which most of his business activities were based. A portrait of the actor is on display at Dulwich Picture Gallery.

Alleyn is unusual among figures in 16th-century drama because a large selection of his private papers have survived. They were published in 1843 as &quot;The Alleyn Papers&quot;, edited by scholar-forger John Payne Collier. He also developed professional relationships with religious and political figures such as Sir Francis Bacon and Sir Julius Caesar.

Alleyn had a private book collection of some significance which he bequeathed to Dulwich College.

<text>Philip Miller Crane (November 3, 1930 – November 8, 2014) was an American politician. He was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1969 to 2005, representing the 8th District of Illinois in the northwestern suburbs of Chicago. At the time of his defeat in the 2004 election, Crane was the longest-serving Republican member of the House.

==Early life==
Crane was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Cora Ellen (née Miller) and George Washington Crane III, a physician and college professor.

He was educated at Hillsdale College, the University of Vienna, and Indiana University Bloomington, where he received a PhD in history in 1961. Crane served in the United States Army. He also attended DePauw University and the University of Michigan.

Crane was a faculty member at Indiana University Bloomington and at Bradley University in Peoria, a staff member for the Republican National Committee and a director of research for the 1964 Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. His brother Dan Crane served alongside him as the Congressman from another Illinois district for three terms. Another brother, David Crane, ran for Congress from Indiana a few times simultaneously with Phil and Dan. The brothers were dubbed &quot;the Kennedys of the Right&quot;. However, David never won a seat in Congress, and Dan ended up being defeated for re-election in 1984 due, in part, to his having sexual relations with a 17-year-old girl. Phil began to battle alcoholism, which he publicly acknowledged after winning reelection in 2000.

==Political career==

Crane was first elected to the United States Congress in what was then the 13th District in a 1969 special election, succeeding Donald Rumsfeld, who was appointed to a position in the Nixon administration. Crane was a dark horse candidate in a field of seven aspirants for the Republican nomination, and was by far the most conservative candidate in the field. Despite the opposition of the Chicago North Shore GOP monied establishment, he prevailed, though by only 2,100 votes. He then won the special election with 58 percent of the vote.

He soon established himself as one of the House&#x27;s most conservative members, leading a small but growing cluster of right-wing congressmen who had cut their teeth in the fledgling conservative intellectual movement of the early 1960s and drew their inspiration from Goldwater&#x27;s presidential campaign. He was handily elected to a full term in 1970, and was reelected 16 times. His district number changed as Illinois lost congressional seats—from the 13th (1969–1973) to the 12th (1973–1993) to the 8th (1993–2005). His district was long considered the most Republican district in the Chicago area, if not in all of Illinois. He almost always won with 70 percent or more of the vote until the 1990s, when he had to fend off more moderate Republicans in the primary and better-funded Democrats in the general election.
Soon after being elected to his first full term in 1970, he was tapped by several conservative activists, including Paul Weyrich, to form a group of conservative congressmen to keep watch on the Republican leadership, which at the time was seen as too moderate. This new group was known as the Republican Study Committee, and Crane served as its first chairman. He remained a member of the group for the remainder of his time in Congress.

In 1970, Crane visited the South Vietnamese prison at Côn Sơn Island, and stated that the &quot;tiger cages&quot; were &quot;cleaner than the average Vietnamese home.&quot;

In 1974, Crane helped initiate the only public and filmed audit of the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox in Kentucky. This experience was shared by 12 congressmen and 100 journalists, and hosted by Mary Brooks, then director of the United States Mint.

In 1976, he was appointed Chairman of the Illinois Citizens for Reagan, in which capacity he made numerous speaking engagements throughout the midwest on behalf of the conservative California governor&#x27;s unsuccessful GOP primary bid for the Presidential nomination.

From 1977 to 1979, Crane was the chairman of the American Conservative Union (ACU), a Washington, D.C.–based conservative citizens&#x27; lobby and political action group. During his tenure the group waged a nationwide campaign against President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s proposed cession of the Panama Canal and against the proposed SALT II arms limitation treaty with the USSR. As a result of these efforts, the organization&#x27;s budget, staff and presence in Washington greatly increased.

===1980 presidential campaign===

In 1978, shortly before the midterm election, Crane announced that he would be a candidate for the Republican nomination for president in 1980. This surprised many observers, as Crane had supported Ronald Reagan for president two years earlier. At the time of his announcement, Crane expressed doubts that Reagan would run again (after two failed attempts for the nomination in 1968 and 1976), and intimated that, should Reagan run, he would likely drop out. However, Crane did stay in the race after Reagan&#x27;s entry. Ultimately, however, Crane was one of the early candidates to drop out of the race during the Republican primaries.

===Political eclipse===

After the 1980 campaign, Crane&#x27;s influence rapidly declined. Newt Gingrich, who had been elected to Congress soon after Crane announced his candidacy for president, soon surpassed him as the leading conservative firebrand in the House. By the time the Republicans took control of the House in 1994, Crane was widely seen as a &quot;foot soldier&quot; for Republican causes.

Crane did have some influence as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, which handles tax issues. As chairman of its trade subcommittee, he was effective in his efforts to promote his staunch free trade views. When the full committee&#x27;s chairman, Bill Archer of Texas, retired after the 2000 elections, Crane made a bid for the highly coveted post of Ways and Means chairman. He was the committee&#x27;s most senior member, having been on the panel since 1975. However, he was passed over in favor of Bill Thomas of California for the Chairman&#x27;s job. Some believe that Crane was not chosen because prior to the vote he had admitted to being an alcoholic and sought a leave from the House to get treatment. Others believe that Thomas&#x27;s ability to raise money for congressional candidates helped him win the chairmanship. Crane did earn the vice-chairmanship of the powerful committee.

Crane is also noted for the role he played in ending the chewing gum ban in Singapore, as part of negotiations during the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.

===Political defeat===
In 2002, Crane&#x27;s Democratic opponent, business consultant Melissa Bean, accused Crane of being out of touch with his constituents. Indeed, even some Republican voters claimed they had not seen him in decades. He was one of the few congressmen whose Washington office lacked a public email address. Despite being dramatically outspent (she received almost no funding from the national party), Bean surprised both parties by garnering 43 percent of the vote. It was only the second time that Crane had been held below 60 percent of the vote.

Bean sought a rematch in the 2004 election. Crane&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm, perceptions that he was on the verge of retirement, combined with Bean&#x27;s stance as a moderate Democrat by Chicago-area Democratic standards, placed what had long been a very safe Republican seat in jeopardy. Bean raised almost as much money as Crane, mainly from small donors. In contrast, Crane received most of his donations from political action committees. Despite Republican efforts to help Crane, Bean defeated him by roughly four percentage points even as George W. Bush carried the district in the 2004 election by 12 percentage points. Coinciding with the growing Democratic trend in the Chicago suburbs, the 8th has been in Democratic hands for all but one term since.

&quot;The Almanac of American Politics&quot; described Crane as &quot;an unusually bitter loser, refusing to speak to Bean or to arrange for the usually routine post-election transfer of district cases and other office files.&quot;

==Death==
Crane died of lung cancer at the home of his daughter, Rebekah, in Jefferson, Maryland, on November 8, 2014, five days after his 84th birthday.

==In popular culture==
Crane is portrayed by actor James Marsden in the 2020 television miniseries &quot;Mrs. America&quot;, which aired on the Hulu Network.

<doc id="412083" wikidata="Q440885" url="?curid=412083" title="Jan Schakowsky">
<text>Janice Schakowsky ( ; née Danoff; born May 26, 1944) is an American politician who has served as the U.S. representative from since 1999, and previous served as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives (1991–1998). She is a member of the Democratic Party.

Her district is anchored in Chicago&#x27;s North Side, including much of the area bordering Lake Michigan. It also includes many of Chicago&#x27;s northern suburbs, including Arlington Heights, Des Plaines, Evanston, Glenview, Kenilworth, Mount Prospect, Niles, Park Ridge, Rosemont, Skokie, Wilmette, and Winnetka, as of the decennial redistricting following the 2010 United States census.

== Early life, education, and career ==
Schakowsky was born Janice Danoff in 1944 in Chicago, the daughter of Tillie (&quot;née&quot; Cosnow) and Irwin Danoff. Her parents were Jewish immigrants, her father a Lithuanian Jew and her mother from Russia.

Schakowsky graduated with a Bachelor of Science in elementary education from the University of Illinois, where she was a member of Delta Phi Epsilon sorority.

Schakowsky was Program Director of Illinois Public Action, Illinois&#x27;s largest public interest group, from 1976 to 1985. She thereafter served as executive director of the Illinois State Council of Senior Citizens as executive from 1985 to 1990. In 1986, Schakowsky ran for the Cook County Board of Commissioners from suburban Cook County. She won the primary to be one of the Democratic nominees, but did not win in the general election.

== Illinois House of Representatives (1991–1998) ==
In 1991, Schakowsky was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, representing the fourth district. In 1992, she was redistricted to the 18th district. She served in the legislature up until the end of 1998.

== U.S. House of Representatives (1999–present) ==
=== 1998 campaign ===
For years, Schakowsky eyed a run in Illinois&#x27;s 9th congressional district, intending to run whenever incumbent Democrat Sidney R. Yates opted to retire. Yates had represented the 9th district since 1949 (except for one term due unsuccessful run for the Senate in 1962), Schakowsky had explored runs in 1992, 1994, and 1996 under the belief each time that Yates might retire.

After his 1996 re-election, Yates announced that he would not seek further re-election in 1998. Schakowsky faced then-Illinois state senator Howard W. Carroll and future Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker in the primary (who ultimately finished second and third, respectively).

The 9th district represented the northern lakefront of Chicago, as well as the suburbs of Evanston and Skokie. It had a large Jewish electorate, with the district long being regarded as the &quot;Jewish seat&quot; in Illinois&#x27; congressional delegation. Yates was Jewish, and all three Democratic contenders to succeed him were as well. Originally also running was a (non-Jewish) fourth candidate: Charles A. &quot;Pat&quot; Boyle. The district was considered among the most liberal congressional districts in the United States. Journalist James Ylisela Jr. observed that Pritzker, Schakowsky, and Carroll largely all ran on platforms aligned with the Democratic Party agenda&quot; that Yates had championed. However, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; separately noted that Schakowsky ran on a more liberal platform than either Pritzker or Caroll, who ran on somewhat more moderate platforms and potentially wound up competing for many of the same voters. Schakowsky centered her message on championing equal rights for women, minorities, and gays. She also focused on protections for trade union workers and on national healthcare reform to address issues of affordability. She also noted the under-representation of women in Congress.

At the time, the election was one of the most-expensive congressional primaries in U.S. history, and Prizker spent nearly $1 million of his own money to fund his run (including $500,000 on television ads in the Chicago market).

Schakowsky won by a strong margin won the Democratic primary, which all but assured her of election in the heavily Democratic 9th district. She won 45.14% to Carroll&#x27;s 34.40% and Pritzker&#x27;s 20.48%. She won the November general election with 75% of the vote, and has since been reelected thirteen times.

=== Women&#x27;s issues ===

As co-chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women&#x27;s Issues, Schakowsky has been known for her support of women&#x27;s issues.

=== Opposition to the Iraq War ===
Schakowsky was outspoken in her opposition to the Iraq War. She was one of the earliest and most emphatic supporters of U.S. Senator Barack Obama before he won the 2004 Illinois Democratic primary election, and actively supported his bid for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. On February 7, 2007, she introduced the Iraq and Afghanistan Contractor Sunshine Act (H.R. 897) in the House of Representatives, seeking information from leading federal agencies on their contracts for work in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill was not enacted.

=== Climate change ===
In hearings held by the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee in July 2006, Schakowsky expressed concern that a report from the National Academy of Sciences showing discrepancies among scientists studying global warming might be &quot;used in a way to discredit the whole notion that our country and the rest of the industrialized and developing world ought to do anything about global warming&quot;.

=== Angling for elevation ===
Schakowsky indicated interest in replacing Barack Obama in the U.S. Senate. Before his arrest, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich had reportedly been considering her among at least six other candidates to fill the vacancy. Schakowsky was one of the first figures in Illinois to voice interest in running in a special election to replace Obama.

=== Support for public option ===
In April 2009, she stated her support for a public option in health insurance, arguing that it would put health insurance companies out of business and lead to single-payer health care, which she supports.

=== Critique and apology for comments about Joel Pollak ===
In March 2015, the Orthodox Union criticized Schakowsky after she said that Jewish politician Joel Pollak was a &quot;Jewish, Orthodox, Tea Party Republican&quot; at a J Street event. She later apologized for her comments.

=== Support for LGBT rights ===
In 2015, Schakowsky was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame as a Friend of the Community. In February 2021, she voted for the Equality Act on behalf of her transgender grandson Isaac.

=== Boycott of Netanyahu&#x27;s speech to Congress ===
In March 2015, Schakowsky did not attend Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s speech to Congress because, she wrote in the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, it could scuttle delicate negotiations with Iran: &quot;The prime minister wants the negotiations to end, and his purpose in speaking to the Congress is to convince us that the president is about to agree to a deal that threatens Israel&#x27;s existence. He believes the president is naïve in thinking that he and the P5+1 can achieve any agreement that will stop Iran from rushing toward a bomb ... What is the alternative to an agreement? Yes, the United States will increase sanctions. But does anyone doubt that Iran will build a nuclear weapon regardless of sanctions? Then the choices will be ugly: accepting a nuclear-weaponized Iran or accepting military action (i.e., war with Iran). For me it&#x27;s obvious that we must give the negotiations a chance. And, in the meantime, Iran has essentially halted its weapons program under the Joint Plan of Action while the talks are ongoing.&quot;

=== Product safety issues ===

Schakowsky has long taken substantial interest in product safety issues and persistently engaged in robust oversight of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. She has often been critical of Republicans on the commission.

=== Support of Assyrian issues ===
Schakowsky has been a proponent of numerous initiatives pertaining to ethnic Assyrians. According to Assyrian American activist Atour Sargon, Schakowsky was an early supporter of her ideas and encouraged her to pursue a political career as early as 2017. She claimed that Schakowsky assisted her during her successful 2019 Trustee campaign in Lincolnwood, Illinois.

During the 2017 confirmation hearings of then-Secretary of State appointee Rex Tillerson, Schakowsky criticized his support of policies that she alleged were detrimental to the future of Assyrian existence in Iraq.

Schakowsky spoke at the 2018 and 2020 Democratic Candidates&#x27; Forums organized by &quot;Vote Assyrian&quot;. At the 2020 forum, she called Assyrians &quot;one of the fastest-growing communities in terms of political involvement&quot;.

On August 7, 2020, Schakowsky released a statement recognizing the anniversary of the 1933 Simele massacre. She is also a proponent of House Resolution 537, which would have the federal government officially recognize the Assyrian genocide if passed.

Throughout her congressional tenure, Schakowsky has supported and co-sponsored bills that would extend U.S. support for Assyrian self-governance in Iraq, particularly in the Nineveh Plains region.

=== Nagorno-Karabakh conflict ===
On October 1, 2020, Schakowsky co-signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that condemned Azerbaijan’s offensive operations against the Armenian-populated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, denounced Turkey’s role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and called for an immediate ceasefire.

=== Syrian conflict ===
In 2023, Schakowsky was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21 which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.

=== Gaza war ===
After the drone strikes on aid workers from World Central Kitchen in April 2024, Mark Pocan, James P. McGovern, Jan Schakowsky, Nancy Pelosi and 36 more members of Congress from the Democratic party urged U.S. President Joe Biden in an open letter to reconsider planned arms shippments to the Israeli military.

=== Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 ===
Schakowsky was among the 46 Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

=== Voting age ===
In January 2023, Schakowsky was one of 13 cosponsors of an amendment to the Constitution of the United States extending the right to vote to citizens 16 years of age or older.

=== 2004 presidential election ===
&quot;The Nation&quot; endorsed Schakowsky as the best possible choice for vice president in the 2004 United States presidential election, writing that she was &quot;the truest heir to Paul Wellstone in the current Congress&quot;. She was not selected as John Kerry&#x27;s running mate.

After the election, Schakowsky was one of 31 House Democrats who voted to not count Ohio&#x27;s twenty electoral votes. President George W. Bush won Ohio by 118,457 votes. The purpose of the objection was not to prevent Bush&#x27;s certification as president-elect, but rather was to register protest and raise public awareness of alleged irregularities in Ohio. Schakowsky hailed the protest as an opportunity to raise attention to the need for congress to pass electoral reforms.

=== Criticism of the Tea Party movement ===
In April 2009, Schakowsky pointedly criticized the tax day Tea Party protests: &quot;It&#x27;s despicable that right-wing Republicans would attempt to cheapen a significant, honorable moment of American history with a shameful political stunt.&quot;

=== Committee assignments ===
For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Energy, Climate, and Grid Security

In December 2016, she was elected the Congressional Progressive Caucus&#x27; vice chair and liaison to the Democratic Party Seniors taskforce. In December 2020, she was named as an executive board member at-large of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

=== Criticism of the term &quot;manufacturing&quot; ===
In a 2025 Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing on manufacturing, Schakowsky expressed a concern that the presence of the word &quot;man&quot; in the term manufacturing might harm engagement of women in the manufacturing sector, saying that the term &quot;sounds like a guy&quot;. Her comments went viral on social media and were widely ridiculed.

== Personal life ==
Schakowsky lives in Evanston, Illinois, with her husband Robert Creamer. She has two children and a stepchild.

In 2005, Creamer pleaded guilty to failure to collect withholding tax and to bank fraud for writing checks with insufficient funds. All the money was repaid. Schakowsky was not accused of wrongdoing. While she served on the organization&#x27;s board during the time the crimes occurred, and signed the IRS filings along with Creamer, the U.S. district judge noted that no one suffered &quot;out of pocket losses&quot;, and Creamer acted not out of greed but in an effort to keep his community action group going without cutting programs, though he paid his own $100,000 salary with fraudulently obtained funds. Creamer served five months in prison. Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Ferguson said the government did not believe Creamer &quot;acknowledged the seriousness of his conduct&quot;. &quot;At the end of the day&quot;, Ferguson said, &quot;Robert Creamer is guilty of multiple crimes and is going to jail for it&quot;.

On July 20, 2022, Schakowsky was arrested in front of the Supreme Court building after she and 33 others, including 15 members of Congress, allegedly refused to comply with orders to stop blocking traffic. She uploaded a clip of it to Twitter, adding: &quot;Today, I am making good trouble.&quot;

<doc id="412085" wikidata="Q120669918" url="?curid=412085" title="Lists of twin towns and sister cities">
<text>This is a list of &quot;twin towns&quot; or &quot;sister cities&quot; — that is, pairs of towns or cities in different countries which have town twinning arrangements.

Note that the list is likely to always remain incomplete, since no canonical list of such arrangements exists.
Any twinning arrangement should be listed at two locations in the list: once for each of the towns involved in the arrangement.

Due to the extreme size of this list and for ease of navigation, the list is divided into separate lists by continent, which are then organized by country. Lists for some countries have in turn been moved to separate lists, which are linked individually below.
