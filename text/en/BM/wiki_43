<text>Agnes Smyth Baden-Powell (16 December 1858 – 2 June 1945) was the younger sister of Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, and was most noted for her work in establishing the Girl Guide movement as a female counterpart to her older brother&#x27;s Scouting Movement.

==Early life==
Agnes was the thirteenth of fourteen children of her father, the Reverend Professor Baden Powell, who had been widowed twice previously. He was the Savilian Professor of Geometry at the University of Oxford from 1827 to 1860. She was her mother&#x27;s third daughter, but the elder two had died before Agnes was born, so she was her mother&#x27;s only surviving daughter.

Her mother, Henrietta Grace nee Smyth, was a gifted musician and artist; she was the elder daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth and his wife Annarella.

Apart from Robert already mentioned above, among Agnes&#x27;s brothers were Warington Baden-Powell, Sir George Baden-Powell, Frank Baden-Powell, and Baden Baden-Powell.

When Agnes was only two years of age, her father died, leaving his widow with ten children to care for, the youngest only a few months old. To honour him after his death, Agnes&#x27;s mother Henrietta added his first name, Baden, to their Powell surname and that branch of the family has since been known as Baden-Powell.

The death of Agnes&#x27;s father Baden left the family under the firm control of Henrietta, who was determined to instill in her children a desire to succeed. Agnes&#x27; brother, Robert, has been quoted as saying, &quot;The whole secret of my getting on lay with my mother.&quot;

==Agnes as an adult==
Agnes went on to become an accomplished musician, playing the organ, piano and violin. Her varied interests included natural history and astronomy, and she kept bees, birds and butterflies in her home.

With her younger brother Baden B-P, Agnes made aeronautical balloons, working the silk for the envelope, and they made many flights together. Later she helped him with building and flying their own gliders and aeroplanes. Agnes was an honorary companion of the Royal Aeronautical Society from 1938.

In April 1901, Agnes became engaged to Sir William Bisset Berry, the Speaker of the South African Parliament, but they did not marry.

She was for some years president of the Westminster Division of the Red Cross, and worked for the League of Mercy and for Queen Mary&#x27;s Needlework Guild.

==Guide movement==
Following the creation of the Boy Scout Association, Robert Baden-Powell organised a gathering of Scouts at the Crystal Palace in London in 1909. Amongst the many thousands of Boy Scouts gathered, there were several hundred girls present, registered as Scouts, and also a small group of girls, dressed in Scout uniforms, who had arrived late and gate-crashed the event without tickets - but they got the publicity.

Popular opinion at this time was against mixed activities for girls, and growing pressure persuaded Robert Baden-Powell to consider setting up a separate organisation for the Girl Scouts, and having been turned down by first aid societies, he approached his sister, Agnes, who reluctantly agreed to take on the organising of the new sister group, Girl Guides. Agnes Baden-Powell&#x27;s character was useful in counteracting negative opinions of the new Girl Guides. A friend wrote of her:

Anyone who had come into touch with her gentle influence, her interest in all womanly arts, and her love of birds, insects, and flowers, would scoff at the idea of her being the president of a sort of Amazon Cadet Corps.
In late 1909, Robert Baden-Powell published &quot;Pamphlet A: Baden-Powell Girl Guides, a Suggestion for Character Training for Girls: Organisation&quot; and &quot;Pamphlet B: Baden-Powell Girl Guides, a Suggestion for Character Training for Girls: Subjects of Training&quot;. These were precursors to the handbook, but raised furious opposition in the Press.

In 1910 the Girl Guide Association was created, with Agnes as president. By April 1910 there were 6,000 young girls registered as Girl Guides. In 1912, Agnes brought about the formation of the 1st Lone Company and was the de facto president of The Girl Guide Association.

During this time, Agnes wrote the Guides&#x27; first handbook. This was &quot;The Handbook for the Girl Guides or How Girls Can Help to Build Up the Empire&quot;, and published in 1912, it was a reworking of the &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; book written by Robert several years earlier but with chapters added by Agnes on a number of subjects. The Girl Guide movement was given official recognition in 1915. In early 1916 Agnes&#x27;s young sister-in-law Olave Baden-Powell was appointed Sussex County Commissioner, and in September 1916 the new County Commissioners voted Olave into the new post of Chief Guide, putting her in charge of Guiding. Agnes was offered the honorary post of President which she reluctantly accepted.

In 1917, following pressure, Agnes resigned from the presidency in favour of Princess Mary, who was also a keen supporter of the Girl Guides, and Agnes became vice-president.

Agnes continued as vice-president of the Girl Guides Association until her death in 1945.

==Death==
Agnes died on 2 June 1945 in North East Surrey, having outlived all her siblings. She was buried in the family grave in Kensal Green Cemetery in London, though her name is not listed on the monument - she is still (2024) the registered owner of the grave.

<text>During World War II, the German military planned or undertook an operation named Donnerschlag (&quot;Thunderclap&quot; in German).

The December 1942 German Army plan called for a breakout from the besieged city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) by the German Sixth Army and there meet up with the relief Operation Wintergewitter. &quot;Donnerschlag&quot; was to be the code word for the commencement of &quot;Operation Wintergewitter&quot;. The operation was downgraded and converted into a defensive stance after Hermann Göring&#x27;s boast that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; would resupply the surrounded troops at Stalingrad. This effort eventually failed totally, and the Sixth Army, encircled by the Red Army as a result of Operation Uranus, surrendered in early February 1943.

<doc id="417234" wikidata="Q1194528" url="?curid=417234" title="Brick Lane">
<text>Brick Lane () is a famous street in the East End of London, in the borough of Tower Hamlets. It runs from Swanfield Street in Bethnal Green in the north, crosses the Bethnal Green Road before reaching the busiest, most commercially active part which runs through Spitalfields, or along its eastern edge. Brick Lane&#x27;s southern end is connected to Whitechapel High Street by a short extension called Osborn Street.

Today, it is the heart of the country&#x27;s Bangladeshi community with the vicinity known to some as Banglatown. It is famous for its many curry restaurants. The area surrounding Brick Lane and Spitalfields was branded as Banglatown in 1997, and the electoral ward of Spitalfields was changed to Banglatown &amp; Spitalfields in 2002.

==History==
===15th to 18th centuries===
The street was formerly known as Whitechapel Lane, and wound through fields. It derives its current name from brick and tile manufacture started in the 15th century, which used the local brick earth deposits. The street featured in the 16th-century Woodcut map of London as a partially developed crossroad leading north from the city&#x27;s most easterly edge, and by the 17th century was being developed northwards from the Barres (now Whitechapel High Street) as a result of expanding population.

Brewing came to Brick Lane before 1680, with water drawn from deep wells. One brewer was Joseph Truman, first recorded in 1683. His family, particularly Benjamin Truman, went on to establish the sizeable Black Eagle Brewery on Brick Lane. The Brick Lane Market first developed in the 17th century for fruit and vegetables sold outside the City.

Successive waves of immigrants settled in the area. In the 17th century, French Huguenots expanded into the area for housing; the master weavers were based in Spitalfields. Starting with the Huguenots, the area became a centre for weaving, tailoring and the developing clothing industry. It continued to attract immigrants, who provided semi-skilled and unskilled labour.

===19th-century markets and their modern use===

In the 19th century, Irish people and Ashkenazi Jews immigrated to the area. Jewish immigration continued into the early 20th century.

The Sunday market, like those on Petticoat Lane and nearby Columbia Road, dates from a dispensation given by the government to the Jewish community in the 19th century. At the time, owing to the Christian observance of Sunday rest, no Sunday markets were open. Located at the junction of Cheshire Street and Sclater Street, the market sells bric-a-brac as well as fruit, vegetables and many other items. 

In 2015 it was identified by police as the focal point of a trade in stolen bicycles and bicycle parts, many taken from people employed in the City of London who had used &quot;cycle to work&quot; schemes. Alongside seven arrests, the police also warned purchasers that buying bicycles or parts in deals &quot;too good to be true&quot; could make them guilty of handling stolen goods. Near the junction with Hanbury Street are two indoor markets; Upmarket and Backyard Market. The Brick Lane Farmers&#x27; Market opened in 2010, intended to be held every Sunday in nearby Bacon Street; it has now closed.

In the later 20th century, Bengali Muslims (specifically the Sylhetis) comprised the major group of immigrants and gradually dominated the demography in the area. Many Bengali immigrants to Brick Lane were from the north-eastern region of Sylhet, of which became part of Bangladesh. These settlers helped shape Bangladeshi migration to Britain; many families from Beanibazar, Jagannathpur and Bishwanath tend to live in the Brick Lane area though they spread around the London city.

===Religious groups===
In 1742, La Neuve Eglise, a Huguenot chapel, was built on the corner of Brick Lane and Fournier Street. By 1809, it was used by Wesleyan missionaries as The Jews&#x27; Chapel, where they promoted Christianity to the expanding Jewish population. It was adapted as a Methodist chapel in 1819 for Protestant residents. (John Wesley had preached his first &quot;covenant sermon&quot; at the nearby Black Eagle Street Chapel).

Reflecting the changing demographics of the area, in 1898, the building was consecrated as the &quot;Machzike HaDath&quot;, or Spitalfields Great Synagogue. After decades of change in the area, with Jews moving out and Bangladeshis moving in, in 1976 it was adapted again as the London Jamme Masjid (Great London Mosque) to serve the expanding Bangladeshi community. The building is Grade II* listed.

===Bengali settlement===
In the 20th century the Brick Lane area was important in the second wave of development of Anglo-Indian cuisine, as families from countries such as Bangladesh (mainly the Greater Sylhet region) migrated to London to look for work. Some curry houses of Brick Lane do not sell alcoholic beverages, for most are owned by Muslims. According to &quot;EasyJet Traveller magazine&quot;, the top three curry houses on Brick Lane in 2021 are Aladin, Sheba and City Spice.

Bengalis in the United Kingdom settled in big cities with industrial employment. In London, many settled in the East End. For centuries the East End has been the first port of call for many immigrants working in the docks and shipping from Chittagong port in Bengal (the British Empire in India was founded and based in Bengal). Their regular stopover paved the way for food outlets to be opened; these catered at first for an all-male workforce, for family migration and settlement took place some decades later. Humble beginnings such as this gave rise to Brick Lane as the famous curry capital of the UK (alongside Birmingham&#x27;s Balti Triangle).

Designed by Meena Thakor, the ornamental Brick Lane Arch was erected in 1997 near Osborn Street to mark the entrance to Brick Lane and to &#x27;Banglatown&#x27;. Like Brick Lane&#x27;s lamp posts, the arch displays the red and green colours of the Bangladesh flag. Having contributed so significantly to the area, the Bengali community campaigned to get the arch installed to celebrate Bengali culture in Brick Lane.

===Regeneration===

More recently the area has also broadened to being a vibrant art and fashion student area, with considerable exhibition space. Each year most of the fine art and fashion courses exhibit their work near Brick Lane.

Since the late 1990s, Brick Lane has been the site of several of the city&#x27;s best known night clubs, notably 93 Feet East and The Vibe Bar, both built on the site of The Old Truman Brewery, once the industrial centre of the area, and now an office and entertainment complex. In 1999, it was the scene of a bombing that injured 13 people.

Brick Lane has a regular display of graffiti, which features artists such as Banksy, Stik, ROA, D*Face, Ben Eine and Omar Hassan. The street has been used in many music videos, including &quot;Glory Days&quot; by Just Jack, &quot;All These Things That I&#x27;ve Done&quot; by The Killers, and &quot;Überlin&quot; by R.E.M. In 2023, some Chinese students painted the political slogan of the Chinese Communist Party, &quot;Core Socialist Values&quot;, in Chinese, sparking significant controversy.

==Land ownership and naming==

Large swathes of Brick Lane and its surrounding areas were once owned by the Osborne (later Osborn after 1720) family, Baronets, of Chicksands in the County of Bedford. The family&#x27;s holdings survived until at least the 1970s. The family&#x27;s history continues to be reflected by the naming of streets in the area around Brick Lane, including:
* Chicksand Street reflects the village of Chicksands in Bedfordshire, location of the family seat Chicksands Priory; 
* The west end of what is now Chicksand Street was once Osborn Place (see 1787 map);
* Modern Osborn Street is a renaming of what was once the southernmost stretch of Brick Lane (see Rocque map of 1746 for this naming, altered by the time of the 1787 map);
* Heneage Street reflects the marriage of George Osborn, 4th Baronet, to Lady Heneage Finch (his 2nd wife) in April 1772;
* The modern Hopetown Street was originally Finch Street, reflecting the same marriage (see 1853 map, right);
* The modern Old Montague Street was originally just Montague Street, preserving the maternal family name of George Osborn, 4th Baronet, whose mother, Mary Montague, was the daughter of George Montague, 2nd Earl of Halifax. The continuation of Chicksand Street to the east (now demolished) was once Halifax Street, referencing the same marriage;
* Modern Hanbury Street is made up of four streets shown on the 1853 map: Browns Lane, Montague Street (triggering the addition of &#x27;Old&#x27; to the earlier street of the same name), Well Street and Church Street.

==Buildings of interest==
Nearby buildings of interest include Christ Church, Spitalfields, the Jamme Masjid or Great London Mosque on the corner of Fournier Street (the building represents a history of successive communities of immigrants in East End), and The Rag Factory on Heneage Street (once home to Turner Prize nominees Tracey Emin and Gary Hume, now a thriving arts space).

==Transport==

The nearest London Underground stations are Aldgate East and Liverpool Street. A campaign was launched in 2006 to change the name of Aldgate East station to &quot;Brick Lane&quot;, but received no official support.

The nearest London Overground station is Shoreditch High Street station. This line runs on part of the former East London Line which has now been converted to London Overground. At the junction with Pedley Street existed the former Shoreditch Underground station terminus, which closed in 2006 due to the construction of the East London Line extension, and replaced by the aforementioned Shoreditch High Street. Remnants of the station can be seen from overground trains entering and leaving Liverpool Street station.

== In popular culture ==

The street is the location for Monica Ali&#x27;s book &quot;Brick Lane&quot;, published in 2003, and the film of the same name of 2007 starring Tannishtha Chatterjee. The novel provoked a controversy with some of the local South Asian community because of a perceived negative portrayal of them. Parts of the Bengali community were particularly opposed to plans by Ruby Films to film parts of the movie based on the novel in the Brick Lane area and formed the &quot;Campaign Against Monica Ali&#x27;s Film Brick Lane&quot;. Consequently, the producers of the film used different locations for certain scenes, such as that depicting Brick Lane Market. Despite this, the director of the film, Sarah Gavron, attests on the DVD commentary of the film that genuine footage of Brick Lane does appear in the finished movie. Activists told &quot;The Guardian&quot; they intended to burn copies of Ali&#x27;s book during a rally to be held on 30 July 2006, but the demonstration passed without incident.

Other notable books on the area are &quot;Salaam Brick Lane&quot; by Tarquin Hall, &quot;On Brick Lane&quot; (2007) by Rachel Lichtenstein and &quot;An Acre of Barren Ground&quot; by Jeremy Gavron. A large collection of photographs of the characters and salespeople who worked on the markets in Brick Lane were taken by Fran May between 1976 and 1978, whilst she was a student of photography at the Royal College of Art.

The street was used for several filming locations for the third season of the BBC television series &quot;Luther&quot; (2013).

<text>King&#x27;s Road or Kings Road (or sometimes the King&#x27;s Road, especially when it was the king&#x27;s private road until 1830, or as a colloquialism by middle/upper class London residents) is a major street stretching through Chelsea and Fulham, both in west London, England. It is associated with 1960s style and with fashion figures such as Mary Quant and Vivienne Westwood. Sir Oswald Mosley&#x27;s Blackshirt movement had a barracks on the street in the 1930s.

==Location==
King&#x27;s Road runs for just under through Chelsea, in the Royal Borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea, from Sloane Square in the east (on the border with Belgravia and Knightsbridge) and through the Chelsea Design Quarter (Moore Park Estate) on the border of Chelsea and Fulham. Shortly after crossing Stanley Bridge the road passes a slight kink at the junction with Waterford Road, where it then becomes New King&#x27;s Road, continuing to Fulham High Street and Putney Bridge; its western end is in the London Borough of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham.

==History==
King&#x27;s Road derives its name from its function as a private road used by King Charles II to travel to Kew. It remained a private royal road until 1830, but people with connections were able to use it. Some houses date from the early 18th century. No. 213 has a blue plaque to film director Sir Carol Reed, who lived there from 1948 until his death in 1976. Thomas Arne lived at no. 215 and is believed to have composed &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; there. Ellen Terry lived in the same house from 1904 to 1920, and also Peter Ustinov; Terry&#x27;s residence is also commemorated by a blue plaque. The photographer Christina Broom was born in 1862 at no. 8.

In 1871, the Chelsea Hospital for Women was founded on King&#x27;s Road, later moving to Fulham Road. The corner of King&#x27;s Road and Manresa Road was occupied from 1895 to 1985 by Chelsea College of Science and Technology before it was subsumed into King&#x27;s College London and immediately sold into private hands.

The world&#x27;s first artificial ice rink, the Glaciarium, opened just off King&#x27;s Road in 1876, and later that year it relocated to a building on the street.

During the 1960s the street became a symbol of mod culture, evoking &quot;an endless frieze of mini-skirted, booted, fair-haired angular angels&quot;, one magazine later wrote. Mary Quant opened her boutique BAZAAR at 138a King&#x27;s Road in 1955. King&#x27;s Road was home in that decade to the Chelsea Drugstore (originally a chemist with a stylised chrome-and-neon soda fountain upstairs, later a public house), and in the 1970s to Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s boutique Let It Rock, which was renamed SEX in 1974, and then Seditionaries in 1977. During the hippie and punk eras it was a centre for counterculture, but has since been gentrified. It serves as Chelsea&#x27;s high street and has a reputation for being one of London&#x27;s most fashionable shopping streets. Other celebrated boutiques included Granny Takes a Trip.

484 King&#x27;s Road was the headquarters of Swan Song Records, owned by Led Zeppelin. The company was closed and the building vacated in 1983. King&#x27;s Road was the site of the first UK branch of Starbucks, which opened in 1999.

In 1984, Keith Wainwright, a pioneer responsible for starting one of the first men&#x27;s hairdressers catering for the longer men&#x27;s styles of the time, with such clients including Roy Wood, Cat Stevens and The Walker Brothers, opened the salon &quot;Smile&quot;, at 434 King&#x27;s Road.

535 King&#x27;s Road was the headquarters of Cube Records, an independent record label of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The label folded in the mid-1970s, becoming part of Elektra Records. The building has since been demolished but the new building on the same site still houses a record company.

==In popular culture==

The road has been represented in popular culture on various occasions: &quot;King&#x27;s Road&quot; is the title of a song by Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers from the 1981 album &quot;Hard Promises&quot; and is name-checked in the song &quot;Dick a Dum Dum (King&#x27;s Road)&quot; which was a hit for Des O&#x27;Connor in 1969. In Ian Fleming&#x27;s novels, James Bond lives in an unspecified fashionable square just off King&#x27;s Road.

In the 1960s radio series &quot;Round the Horne&quot;, in the &#x27;Jules and Sandy&#x27; section, their establishment (named &#x27;Bona...&#x27;), is often located in the King&#x27;s Road (for example, Bona Books in series 4).

Pet Shop Boys met in an electronics shop on King&#x27;s Road in August 1981.

==Planning and transport==
;Planning
The eastern part of King&#x27;s Road is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London. King&#x27;s Road is part of A3217.

;Bus
Buses 11, 19, 22, 49, 211, 319, 328, and C3 all go down King&#x27;s Road, yet most of these turn off the street at one point or another. The 11 and the 22 are the only routes which run the entirety of King&#x27;s Road, with the 22 being the only route that runs all the way from Sloane Square to the end of New King&#x27;s Road in Fulham.

;Rail and tube
The western end of King&#x27;s Road is close to Imperial Wharf railway station on the London Overground network, with connections to Willesden Junction and Clapham Junction. Southern also run direct rail services to and from this station. At the eastern end of the street is Sloane Square, and Fulham Broadway lies at the western end, on the boundary between Chelsea and Fulham. King&#x27;s Road, and the area of Chelsea as a whole, is known for having poor links to the London Underground. Due to this, the route of Crossrail 2 is proposed to have an underground station in this area, called King&#x27;s Road Chelsea.

;River
Chelsea Harbour Pier is also within easy reach of the western end of King&#x27;s Road, with river bus services provided by London River Services and Thames Executive Charters to Putney and Blackfriars. Further east, the same services are also provided at Cadogan Pier, only a few blocks south of King&#x27;s Road near the Albert Bridge.

<text>is a major railway station in Nakamura-ku, Nagoya, Japan. It is Japan&#x27;s, and one of the world&#x27;s largest train stations by floor area (410,000 m2), and houses the headquarters of the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central). Much of this space is located in the JR Central Towers atop the station, as well as in underground concourses. The current station complex was completed on December 20, 1999. The station and the area around it is officially called in the Japanese addressing system.

The station is adjacent to Meitetsu Nagoya Station, the terminal of Meitetsu, and Kintetsu Nagoya Station, the terminal of the Kintetsu Nagoya Line.

The twin-towered station rises over 50 storeys, and is the tallest railway-station building in the world.

<doc id="417240" wikidata="Q1141063" url="?curid=417240" title="Calypso bulbosa">
<text>Calypso is a genus of orchids containing one species, Calypso bulbosa, known as the calypso orchid, fairy slipper or Venus&#x27;s slipper. It is a perennial member of the orchid family found in undisturbed northern and montane forests. It has a small pink, purple, pinkish-purple, or red flower accented with a white lip, darker purple spottings, and yellow beard. The genus &quot;Calypso&quot; takes its name from the Greek signifying concealment, as they tend to favor sheltered areas on conifer forest floors. The specific epithet, &quot;bulbosa&quot;, refers to the bulb-like corms.

==Description==

&quot;Calypso bulbosa&quot; is a deciduous, perennial, herbaceous tuberous geophyte with a round, egg-shaped tuber as a perennial organ. It is encased in dead leaf sheaths and has elongated roots. &quot;Calypso&quot; orchids are typically 8 to 20 cm in height. At the bottom there is only a single leaf, which is stalked up to about 7 cm long. The leaves are whole eliptical lanceolate to egg-shaped blade is up to 6 cm long and up to 5 cm wide.

Plant blooms with a purple-pink hermaphroditic, zygomorphic and threefold flower. The protruding petals and sepals are pink to purple in color, about 10 to 12 millimeters long and about 2 to 4 millimeters wide. The lip (labellum) is white to pink with pink or yellow spots. It has a wide, shoe-shaped cavity in the back and is about 15 to 25 millimeters long. A spur is absent. They do not bloom until May and June usually after snow melt. Each bulb lives no more than five years.
==Taxonomy and systematics==
The chromosome count is 2n = 28. Since the orchid seed does not provide any nutrient tissue, germination only takes place when infected by a mycorrhizal root fungus.

===Taxonomy===
The generic name &quot;Calypso&quot; , which is still valid today, was described in 1806 by the English gardener Richard Anthony Salisbury (1761-1829) in the work &quot;Paradisus Londinensis&quot;, published with the then-director of the Royal Botanic Gardens in London, William Jackson Hooker (1785-1865). Carl von Linné originally assigned &quot;Calypso bulbosa&quot; to the genus &quot;Cypripedium&quot; in 1753, but &quot;Calypso&quot; and &quot;Cypripedium&quot; now belong to two different subfamilies.

The following generic names have been published as synonyms: 
* &quot;Cytherea&quot; (1812)
* &quot;Orchidium&quot; (1814)
* &quot;Calypsodium&quot; (1829)
* &quot;Norna&quot; (1833)

The valid botanical species name of the Calypso orchid is: &quot;Calypso bulbosa&quot; .

The basionym &quot;Cypripedium bulbosum&quot; was described by Linné in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;.

The species names listed here are used as synonyms: 
;Varieties
Four natural varieties and one nothovariety (variety of hybrid origin but established in the wild) are recognized:
==Distribution and ecology==
This species&#x27; range is circumpolar, and includes California, the Rocky Mountain states and most of the most northerly states of the United States; most of Canada; Scandinavia much of European and Asiatic Russia; China, Mongolia, Korea and Japan—see external links for map. It is found in subarctic swamps and marshes as well as shady places subarctic coniferous forests.

Although the calypso orchid&#x27;s distribution is wide, it is very susceptible to disturbance, and is therefore classified as threatened or endangered in several U. S. states and in Sweden and Finland. It does not transplant well owing to its mycorrhizal dependence on specific soil fungi. The corms have been used as a food source by North American native peoples. The Nlaka&#x27;pamux of British Columbia used it as a treatment for mild epilepsy.

At least near Banff, Alberta, the calypso orchid is pollinated by bumble bees (&quot;Bombus (Pyrobombus)&quot; and &quot;B. Psithyrus&quot;). It relies on &quot;pollination by deception&quot;, as it attracts insects to anther-like yellow hairs at the entrance to the pouch and forked nectary-like structures at the end of the pouch but produces no nectar that would nourish them. Insects quickly learn not to revisit it. Avoiding such recognition may account for some of the small variation in the flower&#x27;s appearance.

<doc id="417243" wikidata="Q917608" url="?curid=417243" title="Freakazoid!">
<text>Freakazoid! is an American superhero comedy animated television series created by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini and developed by Tom Ruegger for the Kids&#x27; WB programming block of The WB. The series chronicles the adventures of the title character, Freakazoid, a crazy teenage superhero who fights crime in Washington, D.C. It also features mini-episodes about the adventures of other superheroes. The series was produced by Warner Bros. Television Animation and Amblin Entertainment, being the third animated series produced through the collaboration of Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. Animation after &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; and &quot;Animaniacs&quot;.

Bruce Timm, best known as a producer of the DC Animated Universe, originally intended for the series to be a straightforward superhero action-adventure cartoon with comic overtones, but executive producer Steven Spielberg requested it to be a flat-out comedy. The show is similar to fellow Ruegger-led programs such as &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, having a unique style of humor that includes slapstick, fourth wall breaking, parody, surreal humour, and pop culture references.

The series debuted on Kids&#x27; WB on September 9, 1995, alongside &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries&quot;, and &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;. The series lasted for two seasons across 24 episodes, with the final episode being broadcast on June 1, 1997. Although the series originally struggled in ratings, reruns on Cartoon Network and a fan following elevated it to become a cult hit. Warner Bros. considered renewing the series for a third season, but deemed it to be too expensive. The show also ranked #53 on &quot;IGN&quot;″s Top 100 Animated Series list.

==Background==
The show&#x27;s title character is the superhero alter ego of geeky 16/17-year-old Dexter Douglas, a student of Harry Connick Jr. High School. His name alludes to the alliterative names that superheroes commonly have. Dexter gains his abilities from a computer bug activated by the &quot;secret key sequence&quot; &quot;@[=g3,8d]\&amp;fbb=-q]/hk%fg&quot;, followed by the &quot;Delete&quot; keysomething which was discovered when the sequence was accidentally typed by Dexter&#x27;s cat, Mr. Chubbikins, and was then activated when Dexter hits the delete button on his computer to erase it. Freakazoid has enhanced strength, endurance, speed, and agility, as well as access to all of the Internet&#x27;s knowledge. He cannot fly, but often runs around with his arms extended and making whooshing sounds with his mouth, pretending he is. His base is the Freakalair, a parody of the Batcave built by his mute butler Ingmar, which contains a &quot;Hall of Nifty Things to Know&quot; and a mad scientist lab. His greatest weakness, as he explains to the head of Apex Microchips, Armando Guitierrez, is graphite bars charged with negative ions. He also expresses a great aversion to &quot;poo gas&quot;.

Freakazoid also has several other abilities; he once developed telekinesis powered by anger, and once crossed the globe to yell at a Tibetan monk. He also has the ability to assume the form of electricity and cover long distances instantaneously, although he often simply sticks his arms forward and runs while pretending to fly.

Dexter can change into and out of Freakazoid at will with the respective phrases &quot;Freak out!&quot; and &quot;Freak in!&quot;. Freakazoid spends his inactive time in an area of Dexter&#x27;s brain called the Freakazone, where he reflects and watches &quot;Rat Patrol&quot; reruns.

While the show is set around Washington, D.C., the locale often varies with its humor, taking Freakazoid to locations around the world.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
* Freakazoid (voiced by Paul Rugg) – The protagonist of the series. He is the alter ego of geeky 16-year-old computer ace Dexter Douglas (voiced by David Kaufman), a student of Harry Connick Jr. High School who became Freakazoid after the Pinnacle Chip inside his computer was activated. To transform and detransform, Dexter says &quot;Freak out!&quot; and &quot;Freak in!&quot; respectively. Dexter and Freakazoid are sometimes considered to be separate identities, and other times are considered the same person.

===The Douglas family===
* Debbie Douglas (voiced by Tress MacNeille) – Dexter&#x27;s mother, who is unaware he is Freakazoid and is generally blithe and clueless.
* Douglas Douglas (voiced by John P. McCann) – Dexter&#x27;s father, who is incompetent but still attempts to keep his family in line.
* Duncan Douglas (voiced by Googy Gress) – Dexter&#x27;s older brother. He is a stereotypical jock who often bullies Dexter, but is frequently tormented by Freakazoid.
* Mr. Chubbikins (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker) – The Douglas&#x27; cat, who caused Dexter&#x27;s transformation into Freakazoid after accidentally typing in the key sequence that activated the Pinnacle Chip&#x27;s flaw.

He has the ability to get people to stop what they are doing by pointing at something and saying &quot;Cut it out&quot;. He can also find Freakazoid no matter where he is, and often interrupts him to ask him to visit various entertainments, which Freakazoid always agrees to. During this visit, Cosgrove reveals important information about the plot of the episode, resulting in Freakazoid leaving to foil the villain&#x27;s scheme. Additionally, Freakazoid entrusted Cosgrove with his secret identity, and is upset when he accidentally reveals it to Steff and Professor Jones.
* Roddy MacStew (voiced by Craig Ferguson) – Freakazoid&#x27;s mentor and expositionist. He is an ill-tempered Scotsman who once worked for Guitierrez and was the first to discover the Pinnacle Chip&#x27;s flaw.

* Steff (voiced by Tracy Rowe) – Freakazoid&#x27;s kind yet cynical and sarcastic girlfriend, whose real name is Stephanie. She discovers Freakazoid&#x27;s secret identity after Cosgrove accidentally reveals it in &quot;Mission: Freakazoid&quot; and becomes Dexter&#x27;s girlfriend as well.
* Hans (voiced by Larry Cedar) – A mysterious European agent who takes Freakazoid to Professor Heiney&#x27;s lab.
* Professor Heiney (voiced by Ed Gilbert) – A scientist with a lab in the mountains, where he researches and kills monsters.
* Ingmar – Freakazoid&#x27;s mute butler, who built and maintains the Freakalair. He quits in &quot;Mission: Freakazoid&quot; to become a rodeo clown and is replaced by Professor Jones.
* Professor Jones (voiced by Jonathan Harris) – A snooty and cowardly man who is a parody of Dr. Zachary Smith from &quot;Lost in Space,&quot; who Harris also portrayed. He is Ingmar&#x27;s replacement and is old friends with him. He does not get along well with Cosgrove and gets little respect from others.
* Joe Leahy (voiced by himself) – The show&#x27;s vocal narrator and announcer.
* Freakazette – A female counterpart to Freakazoid, who only appears in the segment &quot;Freakazoid and Friends&quot;.
* Foamy the Freakadog (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker) – A vicious, rabid dog who Freakazoid frees from a dogcatcher&#x27;s van and briefly adopts as his sidekick.
* Handman (voiced by Paul Rugg) – Freakazoid&#x27;s brief &quot;right hand man&quot;, who is a painted face on his right hand. He falls in love with and marries Handgirl, a painted face on Freakazoid&#x27;s left hand.
* Expendable Lad (voiced by Paul Dini) – Freakazoid&#x27;s sidekick in &quot;And Fanboy Is His Name&quot;. He is hospitalized after Milk Man bruises his clavicle and released from Freakazoid&#x27;s service.

===Enemies===
&quot;Freakazoid!&quot; features several campy villains in his rogues gallery.

* The Lobe (voiced by David Warner) – Freakazoid&#x27;s archenemy, an evil genius with a giant brain for a head. Despite his high intellect, he has very low self-esteem, once even having a scheme foiled after Freakazoid insults his plan, despite being impressed by it after he leaves.
* Cobra Queen (voiced by Tress MacNeille) – Real name Audrey Manatee, she is a former shoplifter who was transformed into a humanoid reptile after stealing an experimental expired cosmetic. In later episodes, she and Cave Guy are shown to be dating.
* Cave Guy (voiced by Jeff Bennett impersonating Jim Backus) – Real name Royce Mumphry, he is a thuggish blue-skinned caveman with upper-class diction and taste who speaks in a stereotypical WASP tone. He is also in a relationship with Cobra Queen.

He is additionally an aspiring musician and owns a high-tech truck nicknamed &quot;Bessie Mae&quot;.
** Turk (voiced by Matt Landers) – Longhorn&#x27;s henchman.
* Armando Guitierrez (voiced by Ricardo Montalbán) – The head of Apex Microchips, who designed the faulty Pinnacle Chip responsible for Freakazoid&#x27;s creation. He gains powers similar to Freakazoid using the Chip, but is defeated and lost in the Internet. After escaping, Guitierrez becomes a fugitive and begins wearing a hooded robe to cover the right side of his face, which has become cybernetic.

* Invisibo (voiced by Corey Burton impersonating Vincent Price) – Originally known as Ahmon Kor-Unch, he is an ancient Egyptian pharaoh who wields a staff that enables him to become invisible. He was previously sealed inside a sarcophagus, but is freed in the modern day after Dexter and Duncan accidentally break the seal while fighting.
* Booger Beast (voiced by Frank Welker) – A slimy monster who attacks Steff in the cold opening of episode 9.
* The Nerdator (voiced by Aron Kincaid) – A man who plans to kidnap all of the nerds in the world and absorb their knowledge to become a &quot;Super-Nerd&quot;. However, Freakazoid convinces him of the downsides of being a nerd, after which he discontinues his plot and instead begins kidnapping &quot;good-looking, but vapid airheads&quot;. His design is a parody of the Predator.
* Arms Akimbo (voiced by John Schuck impersonating Edward G. Robinson) – A spoiled model turned extortionist who, after years of posing, was left with his arms frozen in a pose with his hands on his hips. He sells &quot;oops insurance&quot;, a form of protection racketeering which mainly consists of him breaking valuable things.
* The Milk Man – A milk-themed villain whom Freakazoid and Expendable Lad fight in &quot;And Fanboy Is His Name&quot;. He injures Expendable Lad&#x27;s clavicle, resulting in him retiring.
* Deadpan (voiced by Bebe Neuwirth) – A plain-looking, shapeshifting supervillainess with a monotonous voice.
* Mary Beth (voiced by Tress MacNeille) – An ancient, fire-breathing monster who disguises herself as a human and operates as an esteemed cosmetics executive. She maintains her youth by absorbing the life force of superheroes and plans to do so to Freakazoid, but he prevents her from doing so, causing her to age into dust.
* Janos Ivnovels (voiced by Jim Cummings) – The dictator of Vuka Nova and its Minister of State Security. He captures Freakazoid&#x27;s family on false charges of espionage before he frees them and leaves Ivnovels to be tortured by the Mime from &quot;Animaniacs&quot;.
** Colonel Anton Mohans (voiced by Larry Cedar) – A vicious thug and Ivnovels&#x27; servant.
* Vorn the Unspeakable (voiced by Richard Moll) – A Cthulhu-like demon and ally of Waylon Jeepers.
* Dr. Mystico (voiced by Tim Curry) – A mad scientist with aspirations of world domination. He was kicked out of university for his mad science and set up a laboratory on a remote island to continue his experiments. Furthermore, he is assisted by his cat Sparkles and orangutan-human hybrids named Orangu-Men (vocal effects provided by Jim Cummings).
* Kid Carrion (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – A zombie cowboy who was among the characters created during the original development of the show.
* Major Danger – A villain who was part of Bruce Timm&#x27;s original development of the show. He makes a cameo in &quot;The Lobe&quot;, among the crowd watching the Lobe attempt to lobotomize Freakazoid.
* Bombshell – A villain who was part of Bruce Timm&#x27;s original development of this show. She makes a cameo in &quot;The Lobe&quot;, among the crowd watching the Lobe attempt to lobotomize Freakazoid.
* Eye-of-Newt – A one-eyed creature resembling Newt Gingrich.

===Other characters===
* Mo-Ron/Bo-Ron (voiced by Stan Freberg) – An obese and dimwitted alien from the planet Barone&#x27;s, a reference to the restaurant of the same name. His name was changed to Bo-Ron to appease network censors&#x27; concerns that use of the word moron could be offensive.
* Fanboy (voiced by Stephen Furst) – An obese, socially awkward fanboy and would-be sidekick to Freakazoid.
* Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton (voiced by Frank Welker and Tress MacNeille respectively) make several cameos in the show, partly because of its setting of Washington, D.C.
* Barbra Streisand (voiced by Tress MacNeille) also makes several appearances, most notably in the episode &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Date&quot;, which features a parody of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;.
* Hero Boy (voiced by John P. McCann) – The title character of Freakazoid&#x27;s favorite TV show, which is a parody of &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. He has no powers except for flight and his fighting techniques always fail.

* Paul Harvey (voiced by Paul Rugg) – A caricature of the real-life radio personality.
* Lonnie Tallbutt (voiced by Mitch Schauer in human form, vocal effects provided by Jim Cummings in werewolf form) – A werewolf who Freakazoid cures by sending him into the Internet. His name is a reference to actor Lon Chaney Jr. and Lawrence Talbot, his character in &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;.

* The Brain (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) – A megalomaniacal genius lab mouse.

==Mini-segments==
&quot;Freakazoid!&quot; also features several mini-segments, primarily in the first season. Each of these have their own theme songs and title cards, and only occasionally appear in the main show. These segments include:

* Lord Bravery – Nigel Skunkthorpe (voiced by Jeff Bennett impersonating John Cleese) is a superhero from the United Kingdom who resembles a Roman soldier. He does not do much in the way of superheroics, as he is snooty, cynical and unwilling to do unpleasant tasks. Likewise, he gets little respect and recognition from the public and his family.
* The Huntsman – Marty Feeb (voiced by Jeff Bennett impersonating Charlton Heston) is a Robin Hood-like hero who lives in the woods and gained his powers from corn that an elf gave him for saving his life. However, he rarely finds crime to fight as his police contact Lt. Artie King (voiced by Dorian Harewood) at the Division 13 Detectives office claims that the city is in a slow crime period. While leaving to go do something else, Huntsman would rant about the city being in a slow crime period and then kicks something in the hallway.
* The Lawn Gnomes – Baffeardin (voiced by Clive Revill), Huska (voiced by Carl Ballantine), Honna (voiced by Rose Marie), and Quist (voiced by Larry Gelman) are a group of trickster gnomes who come to life at night in a parody of &quot;Gargoyles&quot;. They were previously cursed into garden gnome form by the wizard Rathgar (voiced by Maurice LaMarche), who informed them that the curse would only be lifted if they reformed and do good for the people.
* Toby Danger – A parody of &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; that was originally written as a standalone short for &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, but slotted into &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; to fill time. It features the adventures of Toby Danger (voiced by Scott Menville), his scientist father Vernon Danger (voiced by Don Messick), his adoptive sister Sandra Danger (voiced by Mary Scheer), and Vernon&#x27;s bodyguard Dash O&#x27;Pepper (voiced by Granville Van Dusen).
* Fatman and Boy Blubber – The misadventures of two overweight superheroes (voiced by Marc Drotman and Paul Rugg, respectively), in a parody of &quot;Batman&quot;. Their only segment involves them coming to the aid of Louis (voiced by Scott McAfee), an overweight boy who loves sweet buns and is being tormented by bullies.

==Production==
===Voicing===
The voice actors of the show &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; included various actors from other television series and films. Tress MacNeille, Maurice LaMarche, Jeff Bennett, and Frank Welker, who all provided voices in the series &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, were on &quot;Freakazoid!&quot;. Actors Ed Asner, Ricardo Montalbán, Larry Cedar, Jonathan Harris, and Stephen Furst also provided voices for the series. Also, writers John P. McCann and Paul Rugg (who played Freakazoid) added voices themselves.

Casting for the show had been difficult for the &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; staff, as no lead character had been found even after extensive auditions. Eventually, when writer Paul Rugg was brought to demonstrate the voice in a recording session, he ended up filling the role, as he said: &quot;I went in there and did it. Then they played it for Steven Spielberg and he said &#x27;Yep! Fine, sure, great,&#x27; and then I panicked ... and I had to do it.&quot; Rugg played the role of Freakazoid through the entire series run.

===Animation===
The animation was outsourced to Animal-ya, Studio Junio, and Tama Production in Japan, Seoul Movie, Dong Yang Animation, and Koko Enterprises Ltd. in South Korea.

===Music===
The music for &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; was written by Richard Stone, Steve Bernstein, Julie Bernstein, Gordon Goodwin, and Tim Kelly. Stone won a Daytime Emmy with lyricist (and senior producer) Tom Ruegger for the main title song in 1996. Julie Bernstein was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Original Song in 1998 for the song &quot;Invisibo&quot; from the episode &quot;Freak-a-Panel&quot;.

==Controversy with Mike Allred&#x27;s &quot;Madman&quot;==
The show and its lead character was criticized for plagiarizing the superhero comic book &quot;Madman&quot; by Mike Allred, asserting that the title characters share several personality traits, they both have blue skin and wear similar costumes featuring a chest emblem including an exclamation mark. During the short run of the show, Allred remained relatively silent on the subject, but in 2003, he responded to a question about the show on the message board of his official website:

==Humor==
The humor in &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; relied heavily on slapstick, parody and pop culture references. Due to the series being metafiction, much of the series was self-aware humor (i.e. breaking the fourth wall); for instance, after the first appearance of the Freakmobile, the show goes immediately into an impromptu commercial for a toy version, and later in the episode, Freakazoid addresses an audience, congratulating the staff on how hard they have worked to make the show toyetic. A running gag involves a repeated credit for &quot;Weena Mercator as the Hopping Woman&quot;, though no such character appears in any episode. The show also incorporated humor aimed at the WB Network, such as questioning the meaning of the initials &quot;WB&quot;.

&quot;Freakazoid!&quot; made frequent use of stock footage, including a peaceful scene of a field of flowers (&quot;Relax-O-Vision&quot;), numerous people screaming and traditionally dressed Bavarians dancing and slapping each other (&quot;Candle Jack&quot;), and a man being shot in the belly with a cannonball and a man wrestling a bear (&quot;The Chip&quot;).

Cameo appearances were also a major element of the show&#x27;s humor. At various times, &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; hosted appearances by characters from other Warner Bros. shows such as &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and even an insinuation appearance of Batman from Bruce Timm&#x27;s . Portrayals of many celebrities (including producer Steven Spielberg) and guest appearances by such figures as Jack Valenti, Leonard Maltin and Mark Hamill as themselves were also commonplace. Norm Abram had an entire episode, &quot;Normadeus&quot;, built around him. One original character, a bizarre-looking man named Emmitt Nervend, plays no role whatsoever other than enabling a &quot;Where&#x27;s Waldo&quot;-esque hunt for his cameos (complete with the number of his appearances announced in the closing credits).

One of the show&#x27;s longest cameo appearances was in the episode &quot;The Freakazoid&quot;, where Freakazoid, Wakko from &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, and the Brain from &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; argue over which of their shows is Steven Spielberg&#x27;s favorite, with Freakazoid arguing that his show was the favorite (&quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; was not represented in the discussion as it was on Nickelodeon at the time, while the others were on Kids&#x27; WB). However, when the trio confronts Steven over the issue, he admits to having no idea who they are.

==History==

===Creation===

&quot;Freakazoid!&quot; was created by animators Bruce Timm, who had previously produced &quot;&quot;, and his writing partner Paul Dini, who was also a story editor for &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;. Timm was called upon by Steven Spielberg, who Timm said &quot;liked&quot; Timm&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; series, to help create a new superhero show. After a meeting with Spielberg, Timm said that Spielberg had &quot;really liked&quot; the idea for the series, after which Timm and Dini created the character Freakazoid, an edgy superhero with a manic personality. Timm came up with the name for the character naturally, as he recalled, &quot;The name &#x27;Freakazoid&#x27; just kind of jumped out of me, I don&#x27;t even know where from. I said &#x27;Oh, yeah, &#x27;Freakazoid&#x27;, that might be an interesting name.&#x27;&quot; Dini and Timm have also discussed their desire to create a TV show about the Creeper, another comic character.

Timm originally created &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; to be a serious &quot;adventure show&quot; with some comedic undertones. However, his initial idea for the series did not come to be, as he stated:

After Timm left the series, Tom Ruegger, who developed the other Spielberg series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; and &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, was brought in to re-develop the series Timm had created &quot;from the ground up&quot;. Ruegger&#x27;s version of the series used some of Timm&#x27;s designs and concepts, but Timm said that the series was &quot;radically altered&quot; to become the comedy series that was more to Spielberg&#x27;s liking.

Ruegger then began writing stories for the series, and came up with a pile of very short segments. Spielberg liked what Ruegger had written, but wanted longer stories for the series as well. Ruegger then asked writers John McCann and Paul Rugg to come onto the series to write longer, more elaborate stories for the series and, according to Rugg, &quot;(...) figure out what this [&quot;Freakazoid!&quot;] was going to be, and the answer was like, &#x27;We didn&#x27;t know&#x27;, and still don&#x27;t&quot;.

===Premiere, cancellation, and syndication===

&quot;Freakazoid!&quot; premiered on Kids&#x27; WB&#x27;s Saturday lineup on September 9, 1995. During its run, &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; came across problems of appealing to its target demographic, young children. Tom Ruegger said that &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; had done poorly in ratings because the audience that the series gathered was older than the target audience. Also, &quot;Freakazoid&quot; ran into timeslot problems. Writer John McCann said that the time slot of the series changed frequently: &quot;They put it at eight o&#x27; clock in the morning, 3:30 in the afternoon, they shifted it all around; we couldn&#x27;t even find it, and we wrote the thing&quot;. The series ran on Kids&#x27; WB until February 14, 1997, when it was canceled due to poor ratings, airing only one complete season and part of a second season. Rugg said the series&#x27; demise was the result of a combination of people not understanding the series, time slot changes, appealing to the wrong demographics, and that &quot;(...) there aren&#x27;t a lot of Nielsen boxes in federal prisons. Had there been, I&#x27;m telling you, we&#x27;d still be on the air today&quot;. However, the show was later picked up by Cartoon Network and was rebroadcast from April 5, 1997, until March 29, 2003. The series had a total number of 24 episodes. In 2006, &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; was one of the shows scheduled to be broadcast on the AOL broadband channel, In2TV. The show is currently available to stream for free on Tubi. In Italy, &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; along with &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;, was shown on RAI and later Mediaset. In Japan, &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; along with &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; was shown on TV Asahi. As of 2016, the show also currently airs on Tooncast. Starting on June 25, 2024, the show aired on MeTV Toons.

===Reception===
The series won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Animated Program.

Bruce Timm said that the series still has a cult following of fans who ask him questions about the series whenever they meet him.

According to Timm, the character&#x27;s co-creator, he actually has a preference for the second season:
==Merchandise==

===Print===
Freakazoid never had his own comic book, but he did make a special guest crossover in issue #35 of the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; comic book published by DC Comics.

===Home video===
Warner Home Video has released the entire series on DVD in Region 1.

==Legacy==
The sixth season episode of &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;, &quot;Huggbees&quot;, aired on November 14, 2020, and features Freakazoid helping the Teen Titans defeat the Lobe and Brain when they join forces. It was mentioned by Freakazoid that Steven Spielberg would have to approve the crossover which led to Robin sending a message to Steven who approves of the crossover. According to Rugg, the production team for the show had sent him a script involving Freakazoid in December 2019 which he approved. The episode has Rugg, David Warner, Ed Asner, and Joe Leahy reprising their respective roles.

<doc id="417244" wikidata="Q333339" url="?curid=417244" title="John Pakington, 1st Baron Hampton">
<text>John Somerset Pakington, 1st Baron Hampton, (20 February 1799 – 9 April 1880), known as Sir John Pakington, Bt, from 1846 to 1874, was a British Conservative politician.

==Background and education==
He was born John Somerset Russell, the son of William Russell and Elizabeth Pakington, of the Pakington family of a Worcestershire family, sister and heiress of Sir John Pakington, the 8th and last Baronet Pakington of Ailesbury. His birthplace was Slaughter&#x27;s Court, Powick, Worcestershire.

His father William Russell (1750–1812) was a barrister and magistrate, the son of a surgeon of Worcester of the same name, and first cousin of William Oldnall Russell, and had first been married to Mary Cocks, with whom he had a daughter Mary. He was left an orphan when his mother died in 1813: his half-sister Mary had married in 1806 the Rev. Henry Barry Domvile, and Domvile from 1811 had the living near Powick of Leigh with Bransford. John was educated at Eton College and matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford in 1818.

The second son, John became the heir when his elder brother William Herbert Russell died in 1819, and he left Oxford without a degree. In 1827 he fought a duel, over a matter concerning the Worcestershire Hunt. It took place at Kempsey, when he and John Parker, Master of the Hunt, fired at each other without injury.

John Somerset Russell assumed in 1831 by Royal Licence the surname of Pakington in lieu of his patronymic, having inherited in 1830 the estates of his maternal uncle Sir John Pakington, which he held jointly with the baronet&#x27;s younger sister Ann Pakington. The estate included Westwood House, Worcestershire and Pakington moved there with his first wife Mary, in 1832.

==Political career==
Pakington had a family connection to Sir Compton Domvile, 1st Baronet, a Tory Member of Parliament in the 1820s and early 1830s, and the brother of Henry Barry Domvile who had married his half-sister Mary. He turned down the chance to stand as a reform candidate at the 1831 general election, instead speaking for the Tory Henry Beauchamp Lygon standing for Worcestershire. He was elected at the fourth attempt as the Tory Member of Parliament for Droitwich in 1837, a seat he held until 1874.

Pakington is considered a liberal conservative. He was first given office by Sir Robert Peel in 1841 and created in 1846 Baronet Pakington of the second creation, of Westwood in the County of Worcester.

===1850s and 1860s===
Pakington served under Lord Derby one-year administration, as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in 1852. He announced the end of penal transportation to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, shortly to be known as Tasmania. He gave the green light to responsible government in New South Wales, which came about in 1855. Pressed by Charles Adderley, he granted New Zealand a constitution qualified by London&#x27;s control of policy on indigenous peoples.

In opposition Pakington developed an interest in education reform. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1852, and became a member of its Committee of Council on Education, which oversaw spending of public money on primary education. He introduced in 1855 an unsuccessful Education Bill which foreshadowed the Elementary Education Act 1870. As with Lord John Russell&#x27;s previous effort, it foundered on the issue of Anglican schools that supposed nonconformist financial support.

With the Tories back in power, Pakington again held office under Lord Derby, as First Lord of the Admiralty from 1858 to 1859 and from 1866 to 1867. As First Lord he commissioned the first ironclad warship, HMS &quot;Warrior&quot;, launched in 1860. Following design work by John Scott Russell working with Baldwin Wake Walker, the time was ripe, given the French appointment of the naval architect Henri Dupuy de Lôme.

Under Derby and his successor Benjamin Disraeli Pakington was Secretary of State for War from 1867 to 1868. He was appointed a GCB in 1859. He chaired the Pakington Inquiry on education in 1865.

A butt of Derby&#x27;s robust sense of humour, Pakington at a dinner in 1858 found himself being toasted by Derby who proposed &quot;Sir John Pakington and the Wooden Spoons of Old England&quot;, the parliamentary wooden spoon being given to the Member who voted the fewest times in a session. Another anecdote had him late for a Cabinet meeting and excusing himself as having been &quot;at Spithead&quot;, where naval reviews were held. Derby replied with a sarcastic pun on swell, meaning dandy as well as a form of wave.

===1870s===

In 1871 Pakington addressed the Social Science Congress, speaking on the &quot;New Social Alliance&quot;, with which Disraeli was toying. The term referred to discussions being held between Conservative Party leaders and workers&#x27; representatives. They aroused hostility from Tory backbenchers; and George Charles Brodrick called it a &quot;semi-communistic programme&quot;. Pakington had joined the ephemeral movement of John Scott Russell, signing with Stafford Northcote, Gathorne Hardy and some of the House of Lords a memorandum on social reform measures to be taken, the &quot;seven points&quot;. In October, in an article &quot;The New Social Movement&quot;, the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; commented:

The pompous announcement of an alliance between the aristocracy and the artisans bears traces of Mr. Disraeli&#x27;s earlier manner; but a serious belief in the practicability in the present day of a limited and regulated socialism is only worthy of Sir John Pakington or of Lord John Manners. When &quot;Coningsby&quot; and &quot;Sybil&quot; were published, there had been no insurrection of a Paris Commune, nor had Mr. Mill and the Land and Labour League attacked directly or indirectly the right of property in land.

Pakington, by now unpopular with Tory leaders, lost his seat in the Commons in the 1874 general election, defeated on a large swing from 1868 by John Corbett, a local Liberal. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Hampton, of Hampton Lovett and of Westwood in the County of Worcester.

==Other public appointments==
Hampton served for many years as chairman of the Worcestershire Quarter Sessions. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1858.

<text>Queensland Symphony Orchestra (QSO) is an Australian symphony orchestra in the state of Queensland. The orchestra is based in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s building in South Bank. The Orchestra is funded by private corporations, the state government and the Australian federal government through the Australia Council.

==History==
Queensland Symphony Orchestra played its first concert on 26 March 1947, consisting of 45 musicians, conducted by Percy Code. John Farnsworth Hall was recruited from the Sydney Symphony Orchestra as the Orchestra&#x27;s first Chief Conductor. The Orchestra played concerts in various Queensland cities and towns, such as Innisfail and Townsville, travelling up to 3500 miles a year in the process.

During the first part of its history, the QSO&#x27;s longest-serving Chief Conductor was Rudolf Pekárek (1954–1967). In 1988, Vladimir Kamirski was appointed Chief Guest Conductor. Muhai Tang was Chief Conductor from 1991 to 2001.

In 2001, QSO was merged with Queensland Philharmonic Orchestra, to form The Queensland Orchestra (TQO). Michael Christie was the first Chief Conductor of the Orchestra under its new name, from 2001 to 2004. In July 2007, Johannes Fritzsch was named the next Chief Conductor of TQO, beginning in January 2008, with an initial contract through 2010. On 14 October 2009, the orchestra announced its intention to revert to its former name of the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, effective in 2010. In February 2010, the orchestra announced a three-year extension of Fritzsch&#x27;s contract as Chief Conductor, through 2013. Fritzsch stood down as QSO chief conductor at the end of 2014, and subsequently took the title of Conductor Laureate of Queensland Symphony Orchestra.

In May 2015, Alondra de la Parra made her first guest-conducting appearance with the Orchestra. In October 2015, the orchestra announced the appointment of de la Parra as its first-ever music director and first-ever female conductor in its principal conducting post, effective in 2017. De la Parra completed her tenure as music director at the end of the 2019 season. In February 2021, the QSO announced the return of Fritzsch to the orchestra as its new principal conductor and artistic adviser, with a contract until 2023.

In 2021, Umberto Clerici made three guest-conducting appearances with the QSO. In May 2022, the QSO announced the appointment of Clerici as its next chief conductor, effective 1 January 2023, with an initial contract of three years. In parallel, Fritzsch took the title of principal guest conductor in 2023, and is scheduled to resume his post as conductor laureate in 2024.

The QSO&#x27;s discography includes Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;1812 Overture&quot;, and several works of Benjamin Frankel, including his eight symphonies, violin concerto, viola concerto, and several film score suites.

Michael Sterzinger is set to become the QSO&#x27;s new CEO in November 2024.

<text>The Spectrum Center is an indoor arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. Located in Uptown, it is owned by the city of Charlotte and operated by its main tenant, the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The arena seats 19,077 for NBA games, but can be expanded to 20,200 for college basketball games.

==History==
The arena opened in October 2005 as Charlotte Bobcats Arena. The name was changed to Time Warner Cable Arena when the naming rights were purchased in 2008. When Charter Communications purchased Time Warner Cable in 2016, the name was again changed to reflect the Spectrum trade name.

The arena was originally intended to host the original Hornets franchise in the early 2000s. The Hornets&#x27; arena, Charlotte Coliseum, was considered outdated despite being only 13 years old, primarily owing to the arena only containing eight luxury suites, whereas the Palace of Auburn Hills, which opened the same year as the Coliseum, had 180.

In 2001, a non-binding public referendum for an arts package, which included money to build the new uptown arena, was placed on the ballot for voters; it was placed in order to demonstrate what was believed to be widespread public support for new arena construction. Polls showed the referendum on its way to passage until then-mayor Pat McCrory vetoed a living wage ordinance just days before the referendum. As a result, Helping Empower Local People, a grass-roots organization supporting a living wage, launched a campaign to oppose the arena, arguing that it was immoral for the city to build a new arena when city workers didn&#x27;t earn enough to make a living. The referendum failed with 43% for building the arena and 57% opposed.

City leaders then devised a way to build a new arena that did not require voter support, but let it be known that they wouldn&#x27;t consider building it unless then-Hornets&#x27; owner George Shinn sold the team. While even the NBA acknowledged that Shinn had alienated fans, NBA officials felt such a statement would anger other team owners. As it turned out, the NBA approved the Hornets&#x27; application to move to New Orleans. However, the league promised that the city would get a new team—which became the Bobcats—as part of the deal. The total cost of the arena to Charlotte and Mecklenburg County was not known, but estimated at $260 million. The construction was approved by the city council, which did not opt to present another referendum to the public.

The arena opened as the Charlotte Bobcats Arena on October 21, 2005, costing $265 million. Architects hoped the building would bring the city together, as its location and large outdoor plaza, among other features, would suggest. The building&#x27;s concourses and open design, plus artwork throughout also suggests the concept of community and socializing. One major feature of the arena was its original center-hung scoreboard, which was not only the largest scoreboard in any NBA arena when it debuted, but also featured a one-of-a-kind light-up 360 degree 3D mural of the Charlotte skyline. In early 2006, the arena became the subject of controversy when the Bobcats charged a $15,000 fee to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools for graduation ceremonies held at the building. The fee was eventually waived following media attention from a local newspaper. Many high schools in the area moved graduations to Bojangles&#x27; Coliseum.

As part of the deal, TWC shuttered its poorly-performing regional sports network C-SET (which was established to serve as the Bobcats&#x27; rightsholder) and allowed the team to negotiate a new deal with Fox Sports South to ensure wider distribution of its games. Following Charter Communications&#x27; purchase of TWC, the arena was renamed as the Spectrum Center, in accordance with Charter&#x27;s trade name for its cable services.

=== Renovations ===
In September 2014, the Charlotte city council agreed to give the Hornets $34 million for arena renovations in preparation for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. (However, the game was moved to New Orleans because of a controversial HB2 bill, but the Spectrum Center did host the 2019 NBA All-Star Game to make up for it.)

On January 24, 2015, the Hornets announced and unveiled images of a new scoreboard to be installed in summer 2016, costing $7 million. The board&#x27;s screens measure out at 25&#x27; high by 42&#x27; wide and 18&#x27; high by 31&#x27; wide, approximately, making it almost twice the size of the original board and among the NBA&#x27;s largest. The screens are able to handle 1080p resolution, something unique to the NBA. Two smaller &quot;underbelly&quot; screens would also be included. In addition, the scoreboard would be able to change colors and have a visible &#x27;hive&#x27; motif built-in throughout its design. It was also announced that four retractable auxiliary scoreboards will be installed in the corners of the upper level and finally, 360° ribbon boards are scheduled to be installed as well. Construction was completed by the start of the 2016–17 NBA season. Also announced were plans for the renovation of the visitors locker room, suites, and other rooms. This marked the first major renovations to the Spectrum Center in its history.

The city proposed a $245 million renovation plan for both the arena and the area around it in early 2022. It included various internal upgrades to the arena such as new HVAC units, and the possibility of an outdoor space for entertainment similar to others found at NBA arenas. The biggest addition would be a separate new practice facility located across the street from the arena. In addition, the cost would also cover upgrades to the existing transit station where the new facility would be. City leaders approved the renovations, now priced at $275 million, in June 2022. Construction is expected to start in summer 2022 with a rough completion date in 2027.

==Major events==

===College basketball===
As North Carolina is a hotbed for college basketball thanks to constant success among its major universities, it was expected that the arena would host many NCAA basketball games, and that expectation was correct. Notable NCAA basketball games the Spectrum Center has hosted to date include:

*NCAA tournament: 2008, 2011, 2015, 2018, 2024
**The arena hosted the first ever 16–1 upset in the NCAA Tournament since the 64-team field was adopted. The UMBC Retrievers upset the Virginia Cavaliers 74–54 on March 16, 2018.
*ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament: 2008, 2019
*Southern Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament: 2010
*Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournaments: 2006–2020.
*The Charlotte 49ers basketball teams play a number of high-profile games at the arena.

===Mixed martial arts===
On January 27, 2018, the arena hosted its first UFC event for &quot;UFC on Fox: Jacaré vs. Brunson 2&quot;. The promotion returned to the arena on May 13, 2023, for &quot;UFC on ABC: Rozenstruik vs. Almeida&quot;.

===Other events===
In 2012, the Spectrum Center hosted the Democratic National Convention. In 2016, the arena hosted the Kellogg&#x27;s Tour of Gymnastics Champions. It was scheduled to host the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, but was removed as host on July 21, 2016, due to the league&#x27;s opposition against North Carolina&#x27;s Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act signed by then-Governor Pat McCrory. The league said consideration for Charlotte to host in 2019 would remain if the North Carolina State Legislature and current Governor Roy Cooper made changes to the act that were satisfactory to the league. On May 24, 2017, Charlotte and the arena were officially announced as hosts of the 2019 NBA All-Star Game. The arena was originally scheduled to host the 2020 Republican National Convention, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic the event was scaled back with Day 1 events taking place at the Charlotte Convention Center and the remainder of the convention being held virtually.

==Tenants==
The Spectrum Center has had two other permanent tenants besides the Hornets.

The Charlotte Checkers of the ECHL vacated historic Bojangles&#x27; Coliseum to play in the new arena in fall 2005. When the ECHL Checkers gave way to an American Hockey League team with the same name, they remained at the arena. Although primarily built for basketball, the arena can accommodate an NHL-sized ice hockey rink. The seating capacity for hockey was 14,100 in an asymmetrical seating arrangement, with much of the upper level curtained off. This resulted in many seats with poor sightlines; over 4,000 seats in the hockey configuration had obstructed views. Primarily because of those factors, on December 16, 2014, it was announced the Checkers would move back to Bojangles&#x27; Coliseum starting with the 2015–16 AHL season. Overall, both incarnations of the Checkers played 10 seasons at the arena.

The WNBA&#x27;s Charlotte Sting moved with the then-Bobcats to the arena in 2005, becoming the building&#x27;s third permanent tenant. However, they only played one season at their new home in 2006 before folding in early 2007. This was due to low attendance and a lack of on-court success.

==Entertainment==
The arena is used for more than just sporting events. Musical acts, family productions and other events including concerts, circuses, and professional wrestling all perform there.


===In film and television===
*&quot;One Tree Hill&quot; location shoot for the season six finale, &quot;Remember Me as a Time of Day&quot;. Aired on May 18, 2009.
*&quot;American Idol&quot; Season 12 auditions, June 19, 2012.
*The series finale of &quot;Veep&quot; is primarily set in this venue.

<doc id="417261" wikidata="Q1711558" url="?curid=417261" title="University of Plymouth">
<text>The University of Plymouth is a public research university based predominantly in Plymouth, England, where the main campus is located, but the university has campuses and affiliated colleges across South West England. With students, it is the largest in the United Kingdom by total number of students (including the Open University).

==History==

=== 1862 – 2000 ===
The university was originally founded as the Plymouth School of Navigation in 1862, before becoming a university college in 1920 and a polytechnic institute in 1970, with its constituent bodies being Plymouth Polytechnic, Rolle College in Exmouth, the Exeter College of Art and Design (which were, before April 1989, run by Devon County Council) and Seale-Hayne College (which before April 1989 was an independent charity).

It was renamed Polytechnic South West in 1989, a move that was unpopular with students as the name lacked identity. It was the only polytechnic to be renamed and remained as &quot;PSW&quot; until gaining university status in 1992 along with the other polytechnics. The new university absorbed the Plymouth School of Maritime Studies.

=== 2000 – 2020 ===
In 2006, part of the remains of the World War II Portland Square air-raid shelter were rediscovered on the Plymouth campus. On the night of 22 April 1941, during the Blitz, a bomb fell on the site killing over 70 civilians, including a mother and her six children. The bomb blast was so strong that human remains were found in the tops of trees. Only three people escaped alive, all children.

The university&#x27;s first vice-chancellor was John Bull. He was succeeded by Roland Levinsky until his death on 1 January 2007. He was temporarily replaced by Mark Cleary (who then became vice-chancellor of the University of Bradford until 2013), and then by Steve Newstead. 

The university was selected by the Royal Statistical Society in October 2008 to be the home of its Centre for Statistical Education. It also runs courses in maritime business, marine engineering, marine biology, and Earth, ocean and environmental sciences.

In 2010, students from the university occupied a room in the main campus to protest against rising tuition fees and cuts to courses.

Wendy Purcell became vice-chancellor on 1 December 2007. She was placed on leave on 2 July 2014 by the university&#x27;s governors while an internal review was conducted. Part of the dispute was over the commissioning of ceremonial chairs at a cost of £95,000 without the board&#x27;s approval. A linked case saw the chair of the board of governors, which had suspended Purcell, William Taylor investigated of sexual harassment of female staff. In August 2014, the university was instructed by the Higher Education Funding Council for England to undertake an external review of its governance. Purcell was later appointed to a newly created role of president with compensation of £125,000 for loss of office and maintaining her salary of £250,000.

Judith Petts was appointed the University of Plymouth&#x27;s vice-chancellor and chief executive in February 2016. She joined Plymouth from the University of Southampton, where she had been pro-vice-chancellor research and enterprise and previously the inaugural dean of the Faculty of Social and Human Sciences (2010–2013).

=== 2020 – present ===

In 2021 work began to completely renovate the interior and exterior of the Babbage Building. The renovations will add an extra 10,000m² worth of space to the building, and create rooftop gardens which will be open to students. Renovation works also began on the Intercity Place tower down by the Plymouth railway station. In 2024 the university began the demolition of the nearby Brunel Building, announcing that it would become a new park space and the building&#x27;s facilities would be moved into Babbage .

In 2024, the University announced that Richard Davies would replace Judith Petts as Vice-Chancellor following her retirement.

== Campus ==

When university status was gained in 1992, the university was based in on multiple sites. Under Vice-Chancellor Levinsky the university began a policy of centralising its campus activities in Plymouth.

The Exmouth campus Rolle College housed the Faculty of Education and relocated to the new Rolle Building in August 2008. The decision was unpopular with students and the town of Exmouth itself. There were several protest marches and a campaign to keep the campus open.

Completed developments include Portland Square, a library extension, refurbished and new laboratory and teaching facilities in many of the campus buildings, halls of residence near the Business School and a new £16 million Peninsula Medical School headquarters at Derriford Hospital, in the north of the city.
The campus has over 20 buildings including the Roland Levinsky Building, the university&#x27;s flagship arts, cultural and teaching facility which completed in 2007. It is located at the south of the university campus opposite the Drake Circus Shopping Centre.

InterCity Place is an 11-storey tower building adjacent to Plymouth railway station. The building is currently owned by Network Rail, but is being given to the university on a 150-year lease.

=== Student accommodation ===
University-managed or approved accommodation in the first year of study is guaranteed for all applicants who choose Plymouth as their first choice institution. There are six university-managed halls: Francis Drake, Gilwell, Mary Newman, Pilgrim, Radnor and Robbins. Special accommodation arrangements can be made for students with disabilities or medical conditions.

Francis Drake Hall of Residence, named after English sailor Francis Drake, is owned by University Partnerships Programme (UPP) Limited. It has 314 en-suite rooms arranged in flats with between three and ten rooms, and 15 self-contained studio rooms, all spread across three blocks. The building&#x27;s blocks are named after areas in the city - Armada, Barbican, and Citadel. As of 2023, the building has a rating of 3.6 stars on StudentCrowd.

Following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, the owner and operator of the building, UPP Ltd. tested the cladding and found that it was safe to remain. However, the cladding was visually ageing and they decided to replace the cladding on the building as a precaution and to improve the building&#x27;s appearance. In a report filed by UPP, they stated that they found defects in the cladding and replaced it. A pre-application document was submitted to Plymouth City Council&#x27;s planning department on 18 June 2021, which was then followed by the submission a full planning application on 20 August 2021, which was approved. Work began at the start of the 2021/2022 academic year, with the main contractor being Kier Group. Scaffolding was erected and students remained living in halls that year, which led to complaints from students who were living in the hall during this time.

At 3pm on 24 April 2021, a fire broke out on the 6th floor of the building. One person was injured, suffering from smoke inhalation, and a 21-year-old woman was later arrested under for arson after an investigation to determine the cause of the fire was completed.

==Organisation and administration==
===Faculties and Schools===
There are three faculties which each contain a number of schools:

==== Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Business ====
This faculty contains the School of Art, Design and Architecture, Plymouth Business School, and the School of Society and Culture, including the Plymouth Institute of Education.

The faculty offers degrees in Anthropology, Architecture, Built environment, Business and Management, Criminology, Education, English, Game design, History, Illustration, Art history, 3D Design, Fine Art, Law, Marketing, Music, Photography, Professional Policing, Media arts, Sociology, and Theatre &amp; Performance.

==== Faculty of Health ====
The Faculty of Health contains the Peninsula Dental School, Peninsula Medical School, School of Biomedical Sciences, School of Psychology, School of Health Professions, and School of Nursing and Midwifery. The Faculty runs degrees in Adult Nursing, Biomedical Sciences, Child Health Nursing, Dentistry, Medicine, Mental Health Nursing, Midwifery, Dietetics, Optometry, Social Work, Occupational Therapy, Podiatry, Physiotherapy and Paramedicine.

Medicine and Dentistry were first established as part of the Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry in 2000, which operated as a partnership between Plymouth University and the University of Exeter. In January 2012 the two founding members of the Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry (PCMD), the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, outlined their plans to expand independently and grow the success of the now nationally recognised professional health education provider. These changes came into effect from the start of the 2013 academic year.

==== Faculty of Science and Engineering ====
This faculty contains the School of Biological and Marine Sciences, the School of Engineering, Computing and Mathematics, and the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences.

Subjects taught in the Schools include Biological Sciences, Marine Biology, Marine Sciences, Chemistry, Geology, Geography, Environmental Science, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security, Games Development, Mathematics, Data Science, Mechanical Engineering, Civil and coastal Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Robotics.

===Coat of arms===

The arms, crest, badge and supporters forming the university&#x27;s coat of arms were granted on 10 April 2008, in Grant 173/189, by the College of Arms.

The books represent the university&#x27;s focus on learning and scholarship. The scattering of small stars, represent navigation, which has played a key role in the history of the city and the university. The scallop shells in gold, represents pilgrimage, a sign of the importance of the departure of the Pilgrim Fathers from a site near the Mayflower Steps in the Plymouth Barbican aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620. A Pelican and a Golden Hind support the shield and reflect both the original and later, better known, name of Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s ship. The crest contains the Latin motto, &quot;Indagate Fingite Invenite&quot; which translates as &quot;Explore Dream Discover&quot; and is a quote from Mark Twain, reflecting the university&#x27;s ambitions for its students and Plymouth&#x27;s history of great seafarers.

The letters patent granting arms to the University of Plymouth were presented by Eric Dancer, Lord Lieutenant of Devon, in a ceremony on 27 November 2008, in the presence of Henry Paston-Bedingfeld, York Herald of the College of Arms, the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress of Plymouth, Judge William Taylor, the Recorder of Plymouth, and Baroness Judith Wilcox.

<doc id="417262" wikidata="Q163730" url="?curid=417262" title="Christmas truce">
<text>The Christmas truce (; ; ) was a series of widespread unofficial ceasefires along the Western Front of the First World War around Christmas 1914.

The truce occurred five months after hostilities had begun. Lulls occurred in the fighting as armies ran out of men and munitions and commanders reconsidered their strategies following the stalemate of the Race to the Sea and the indecisive result of the First Battle of Ypres. In the week leading up to 25 December, French, German, and British soldiers crossed trenches to exchange seasonal greetings and talk. In some areas, men from both sides ventured into no man&#x27;s land on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to mingle and exchange food and souvenirs. There were joint burial ceremonies and prisoner swaps, while several meetings ended in carolling. Hostilities continued in some sectors, while in others the sides settled on little more than arrangements to recover bodies.

The following year, a few units arranged ceasefires, but the truces were not nearly as widespread as in 1914; this was, in part, due to strongly worded orders from commanders, prohibiting truces. Subsequently, soldiers themselves became less amenable to truce by 1916; the war had become increasingly bitter after the human losses suffered during the battles of 1915.

The truces were not unique to the Christmas period and reflected a mood of &quot;live and let live&quot;, where infantry close together would stop fighting and fraternise, engaging in conversation. In some sectors, there were occasional ceasefires to allow soldiers to go between the lines and recover wounded or dead comrades; in others, there was a tacit agreement not to shoot while men rested, exercised or worked in view of the enemy. The Christmas truces were particularly significant due to the number of men involved and the level of their participation—even in quiet sectors, dozens of men openly congregating in daylight was remarkable—and are often seen as a symbolic moment of peace and humanity amidst one of the most violent conflicts in human history.

== Background ==
During the first eight weeks of World War I, French and British troops stopped the German attack through Belgium into France outside Paris at the First Battle of the Marne in early September 1914. The Germans fell back to the Aisne valley, where they dug in. In the First Battle of the Aisne, the Franco–British attacks were repulsed and both sides began digging trenches to economise on manpower and use the surplus to outflank, to the north, their opponents. In the Race to the Sea, the two sides made reciprocal outflanking manoeuvres and after several weeks, during which the British forces were withdrawn from the Aisne and sent north to Flanders, both sides ran out of room. By November, armies had built continuous lines of trenches running from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier.

Before Christmas 1914, there were several peace initiatives. The Open Christmas Letter was a public message for peace addressed &quot;To the Women of Germany and Austria&quot;, signed by a group of 101 British women&#x27;s suffragettes at the end of 1914. Pope Benedict XV, on 7 December 1914, had begged for an official truce between the warring governments. He asked &quot;that the guns may fall silent at least upon the night the angels sang&quot;, which was refused by both sides.

== Fraternisation ==
Fraternisation—peaceful and sometimes friendly interactions between opposing forces—was a regular feature in quiet sectors of the Western Front. In some areas, both sides would refrain from aggressive behaviour, while in other cases it extended to regular conversation or even visits from one trench to another. On the Eastern Front, Fritz Kreisler reported incidents of spontaneous truces and fraternisation between the Austro-Hungarians and Russians in the first few weeks of the war.

Truces between British and German units can be dated to early November 1914, around the time that the war of manoeuvre ended. Rations were brought up to the front line after dusk and soldiers on both sides noted a period of peace while they collected their food. By 1 December, a British soldier could record a friendly visit from a German sergeant one morning &quot;to see how we were getting on&quot;. Relations between French and German units were generally more tense but the same phenomenon began to emerge. In early December, a German surgeon recorded a regular half-hourly truce each evening to recover dead soldiers for burial, during which French and German soldiers exchanged newspapers. This behaviour was often challenged by officers; lieutenant Charles de Gaulle wrote on 7 December of the &quot;lamentable&quot; desire of French infantrymen to leave the enemy in peace, while the commander of 10th Army, Victor d&#x27;Urbal, wrote of the &quot;unfortunate consequences&quot; when men &quot;become familiar with their neighbours opposite&quot;. Other truces could be forced on both sides by bad weather, especially when trench lines flooded and these often lasted after the weather had cleared.

The proximity of trench lines made it easy for soldiers to shout greetings to each other. This may have been the most common method of arranging informal truces in 1914. Men would frequently exchange news or greetings, helped by a common language; many German soldiers had lived in England, particularly London, and were familiar with the language and the society. Several British soldiers recorded instances of Germans asking about news from the football leagues, while other conversations could be as banal as discussions of the weather or as plaintive as messages for a sweetheart. One unusual phenomenon that grew in intensity was music; in peaceful sectors, it was not uncommon for units to sing in the evenings, sometimes deliberately with an eye towards entertaining or gently taunting their opposite numbers. This shaded gently into more festive activity; in early December, Sir Edward Hulse of the Scots Guards wrote that he was planning to organise a concert party for Christmas Day, which would &quot;give the enemy every conceivable form of song in harmony&quot; in response to frequent choruses of .

== Christmas 1914 ==

Roughly 100,000 British and German troops were involved in the informal cessations of hostility along the Western Front. The Germans placed candles on their trenches and on Christmas trees, then continued the celebration by singing Christmas carols. The British responded by singing carols of their own.

The two sides continued by shouting Christmas greetings to each other. Soon thereafter, there were excursions across No Man&#x27;s Land, where small gifts were exchanged, such as food, tobacco, alcohol, and souvenirs such as buttons and hats. The artillery in the region fell silent. The truce also allowed a breathing spell during which recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Joint services were held. In many sectors the truce lasted through Christmas night, continuing until New Year&#x27;s Day in others.

On Christmas Day, Brigadier-General Walter Congreve, commander of the 18th Infantry Brigade, stationed near Neuve Chapelle, wrote a letter recalling that the Germans declared a truce for the day. One of his men bravely lifted his head above the parapet and others from both sides walked onto no man&#x27;s land. Officers and men shook hands and exchanged cigarettes and cigars; one of his captains &quot;smoked a cigar with the best shot in the German army&quot;, the latter no more than 18 years old. Congreve admitted he was reluctant to witness the truce for fear of German snipers.

Bruce Bairnsfather, who fought throughout the war, wrote:

Henry Williamson, a nineteen-year-old private in the London Rifle Brigade, wrote to his mother on Boxing Day:

Captain Sir Edward Hulse reported how the first interpreter he met from the German lines was from Suffolk and had left his girlfriend and a 3.5 hp motorcycle. Hulse described a sing-song which &quot;ended up with &#x27;Auld lang syne&#x27; which we all, English, Scots, Irish, Prussians, Württenbergers, etc, joined in. It was absolutely astounding, and if I had seen it on a cinematograph film I should have sworn that it was faked!&quot;

Captain Robert Miles, King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry, who was attached to the Royal Irish Rifles, recalled in an edited letter that was published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the &quot;Wellington Journal &amp; Shrewsbury News&quot; in January 1915, following his death in action on 30 December 1914:
Of the Germans he wrote: &quot;They are distinctly bored with the war... In fact, one of them wanted to know what on earth we were doing here fighting them.&quot; The truce in that sector continued into Boxing Day; he commented about the Germans, &quot;The beggars simply disregard all our warnings to get down from off their parapet, so things are at a deadlock. We can&#x27;t shoot them in cold blood... I cannot see how we can get them to return to business.&quot;

On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day (24 and 25 December) 1914, Alfred Anderson&#x27;s unit of the 1st/5th Battalion of the Black Watch was billeted in a farmhouse away from the front line. In a later interview (2003), Anderson, the last known surviving Scottish veteran of the war, vividly recalled Christmas Day and said:

A German Lieutenant, Johannes Niemann, wrote &quot;grabbed my binoculars and looking cautiously over the parapet saw the incredible sight of our soldiers exchanging cigarettes, schnapps and chocolate with the enemy&quot;.

General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, commander of the II Corps, issued orders forbidding friendly communication with the opposing German troops. Adolf Hitler, a corporal in the 16th Bavarian Reserve Infantry, was also an opponent of the truce.
In the Comines sector of the front there was an early fraternisation between German and French soldiers in December 1914, during a short truce, and there are at least two other testimonials from French soldiers of similar behaviour in sectors where German and French companies opposed each other. Gervais Morillon wrote to his parents, &quot;The Boches waved a white flag and shouted &#x27;Kamarades, Kamarades, rendez-vous&#x27;. When we didn&#x27;t move they came towards us unarmed, led by an officer. Although we are not clean they are disgustingly filthy. I am telling you this but don&#x27;t speak of it to anyone. We must not mention it even to other soldiers&quot;. Gustave Berthier wrote &quot;On Christmas Day the Boches made a sign showing they wished to speak to us. They said they didn&#x27;t want to shoot. ... They were tired of making war, they were married like me, they didn&#x27;t have any differences with the French but with the English&quot;.

On the Yser Front, where German and Belgian troops faced each other in December 1914, a truce was arranged at the request of Belgian soldiers who wished to send letters back to their families over the German-occupied parts of Belgium.

=== Football matches ===
Many accounts of the truce involve one or more football matches played in no man&#x27;s land. This was mentioned in some of the earliest reports, with a letter written by a doctor attached to the Rifle Brigade, published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 1 January 1915, reporting &quot;a football match... played between them and us in front of the trench&quot;. Similar stories have been told over the years, often naming units or the score. Some accounts of the game bring in elements of fiction by Robert Graves, a British poet and writer (and an officer on the front at the time) who reconstructed the encounter in a story published in 1962; in Graves&#x27;s version, the score was 3–2 to the Germans.

The truth of the accounts has been disputed by some historians. In 1984, Malcolm Brown and Shirley Seaton concluded that there were probably attempts to play organised matches that failed owing to the state of the ground, but that the contemporary reports were either hearsay or refer to kick-abouts with made-up footballs such as a bully-beef tin. Chris Baker, former chairman of the Western Front Association and author of &quot;The Truce: The Day the War Stopped&quot;, was also sceptical but says that although there is little evidence the most likely place that an organised match could have taken place was near the village of Messines: &quot;There are two references to a game being played on the British side, but nothing from the Germans. If somebody one day found a letter from a German soldier who was in that area, then we would have something credible&quot;. Lieutenant Kurt Zehmisch of the 134th Saxon Infantry Regiment said that the English &quot;brought a soccer ball from their trenches, and pretty soon a lively game ensued. How marvellously wonderful, yet how strange it was&quot;. In 2011 Mike Dash concluded that &quot;there is plenty of evidence that football was played that Christmas Day—mostly by men of the same nationality but in at least three or four places between troops from the opposing armies&quot;.

Many units were reported in contemporary accounts to have taken part in games: Dash listed the 133rd Royal Saxon Regiment pitched against &quot;Scottish troops&quot;; the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders against unidentified Germans (with the Scots reported to have won 4–1); the Royal Field Artillery against &quot;Prussians and Hanovers&quot; near Ypres and the Lancashire Fusiliers near Le Touquet, with the detail of a bully beef ration tin as the ball. One recent writer has identified 29 reports of football though does not give substantive details. Colonel J. E. B. Seely recorded in his diary for Christmas Day that he had been &quot;Invited to football match between Saxons and English on New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, but this does not appear to have taken place.

=== Eastern Front ===
On the Eastern Front, the first move originated from Austro-Hungarian commanders, at some uncertain level of the military hierarchy. The Russians responded positively and soldiers eventually met in no man&#x27;s land.

== Public awareness ==
The truces were not reported for a week, eventually being publicised to the masses when an unofficial press embargo was broken by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, published in the neutral United States, on 31 December. The British papers quickly followed, printing numerous first-hand accounts from soldiers in the field, taken from letters home to their families and editorials on &quot;one of the greatest surprises of a surprising war&quot;. By 8 January 1915, pictures had made their way to the press, and the &quot;Mirror&quot; and &quot;Sketch&quot; printed front-page photographs of British and German troops mingling and singing between the lines. The tone of the reporting was strongly positive, with the &quot;Times&quot; endorsing the &quot;lack of malice&quot; felt by both sides and the &quot;Mirror&quot; regretting that the &quot;absurdity and the tragedy&quot; would begin again. Author Denis Winter argues that then &quot;the censor had intervened&quot; to prevent information about the spontaneous ceasefire from reaching the public and that the real dimension of the truce &quot;only really came out when Captain Chudleigh in the &quot;Telegraph&quot; wrote after the war.&quot;

Coverage in Germany was less extensive than that of the British press, while in France, press censorship ensured that the only word that spread of the truce came from soldiers at the front or first-hand accounts told by wounded men in hospitals. The press was eventually forced to respond to the growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising with the enemy constituted treason. In early January, an official statement on the truce was published, claiming it was restricted to the British sector of the front and amounted to little more than an exchange of songs, which quickly degenerated into shooting.

The press of neutral Italy published a few articles on the events of the truce, usually reporting the articles of the foreign press. On 30 December 1914 printed a report about fraternisation between the opposing trenches. The Florentine newspaper published a first-hand account about a football match played in no man&#x27;s land. In Italy, the lack of interest in the truce was probably due to the occurrence of other events, such as the Italian occupation of Vlorë, the debut of the Garibaldi Legion on the front of the Argonne and the earthquake in Avezzano.

== Later truces ==
After 1914, sporadic attempts were made at seasonal truces; on the Western Front, for example, a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on Easter Sunday 1915 but were warned off by the British opposite them. At Easter 1915 on the Eastern Front there were truces between Orthodox troops of opposing sides; the Bulgarian writer Yordan Yovkov, serving as an officer near the Greek border at the Mesta river, witnessed one. It inspired his short story &quot;Holy Night&quot;, translated into English in 2013 by Krastu Banaev. In November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion.

In December 1915, there were orders by the Allied commanders to forestall any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the opposing line, whilst communicating with the enemy was discouraged by artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day; a small number of brief truces occurred despite the prohibition. On the German side, a general order from 29 December 1914 already forbade fraternisation with the enemy, warning German troops that &quot;every approach to the enemy...will be punished as treason&quot;.

Richard Schirrmann from Altena (North Rhine Westphalia, Germany), the founder of the &quot;Jugendherberge&quot; and a soldier in a German regiment holding a position on the Bernhardstein, one of the Vosges Mountains, wrote an account of events in December 1915: &quot;When the Christmas bells sounded in the villages of the Vosges behind the lines... something fantastically unmilitary occurred. German and French troops spontaneously made peace and ceased hostilities; they visited each other through disused trench tunnels, and exchanged wine, cognac and cigarettes for Pumpernickel (Westphalian black bread), biscuits and ham. This suited them so well that they remained good friends even after Christmas was over&quot;. He was separated from the French troops by a narrow No Man&#x27;s Land and described the landscape &quot;Strewn with shattered trees, the ground ploughed up by shellfire, a wilderness of earth, tree-roots and tattered uniforms&quot;. Military discipline was soon restored but Schirrmann pondered over the incident and whether &quot;thoughtful young people of all countries could be provided with suitable meeting places where they could get to know each other&quot;. He founded the German Youth Hostel Association in 1919.

An account by Llewelyn Wyn Griffith, recorded that after a night of exchanging carols, dawn on Christmas Day saw a &quot;rush of men from both sides... [and] a feverish exchange of souvenirs&quot; before the men were quickly called back by their officers, with offers to hold a ceasefire for the day and to play a football match. It came to nothing, as the brigade commander threatened repercussions for lack of discipline and insisted on a resumption of firing in the afternoon. Another member of Griffith&#x27;s battalion, Bertie Felstead, later recalled that one man had produced a football, resulting in &quot;a free-for-all; there could have been 50 on each side&quot;, before they were ordered back. Another unnamed participant reported in a letter home: &quot;The Germans seem to be very nice chaps, and said they were awfully sick of the war.&quot; In the evening, according to Robert Keating &quot;The Germans were sending up star lights and singing – they stopped, so we cheered them &amp; we began singing Land of Hope and Glory – Men of Harlech et cetera – we stopped and they cheered us. So we went on till the early hours of the morning&quot;.

In an adjacent sector, a short truce to bury the dead between the lines led to repercussions; a company commander, Sir Iain Colquhoun of the Scots Guards, was court-martialled for defying standing orders to the contrary. While he was found guilty and reprimanded, the punishment was annulled by General Douglas Haig, and Colquhoun remained in his position; the official leniency may perhaps have been because his wife&#x27;s uncle was H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister.

In December 1916 and 1917, German overtures to the British for truces were recorded without any success. In some French sectors, singing and an exchange of thrown gifts was occasionally recorded, though these may simply have reflected a seasonal extension of the live-and-let-live approach common in the trenches.

On 24 May 1915, Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) and troops of the Ottoman Empire at Gallipoli agreed to a 9-hour truce to retrieve and bury their dead, during which opposing troops &quot;exchang(ed) smiles and cigarettes&quot;.

== Legacy and historical significance ==
Although the popular tendency has been to see the December 1914 Christmas Truces as unique and of romantic rather than political significance, they have also been interpreted as part of the widespread spirit of non-cooperation with the war. In his book on trench warfare, Tony Ashworth described the &#x27;live and let live system&#x27;. Complicated local truces and agreements not to fire at each other were negotiated by men along the front throughout the war. These often began with agreement not to attack each other at tea, meal or washing times. In some places tacit agreements became so common that sections of the front would see few casualties for extended periods of time. This system, Ashworth argues, &#x27;gave soldiers some control over the conditions of their existence&#x27;. The December 1914 Christmas Truces can therefore be seen as not unique but as the most dramatic example of the spirit of non-cooperation with the war that included refusals to fight, unofficial truces, mutinies, strikes and peace protests.

* In the 1933 play &quot;Petermann schließt Frieden oder Das Gleichnis vom deutschen Opfer&quot; (&quot;Petermann Makes Peace: or, The Parable of German Sacrifice&quot;), written by Nazi writer and World War I veteran , a German soldier, accompanied by Christmas carols sung by his comrades, erects an illuminated Christmas tree between the trenches but is shot dead. Later, when his comrades find his body, they notice in horror that snipers have shot down every Christmas light from the tree.
* The video for the 1983 song &quot;Pipes of Peace&quot; by Paul McCartney depicts a fictional version of the Christmas truce.
* John McCutcheon&#x27;s 1984 song &quot;Christmas in the Trenches&quot; tells the story of the 1914 truce through the eyes of a fictional soldier. Performing the song he met German veterans of the truce.
* &quot;Goodbyeee&quot;, the final episode of the BBC television series &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; notes the Christmas truce, with the main character, Edmund Blackadder, recalling having played in a football match. He is still annoyed at having had a goal disallowed for offside.
* The song &quot;All Together Now&quot; by Liverpool band The Farm, took its inspiration from the Christmas Day Truce of 1914. The song was rerecorded by The Peace Collective for release in December 2014 to mark the centenary of the event.
* The 1997 song ‘Belleau Wood’ by Garth Brooks depicts soldiers leaving their trenches to sing carols together and braving the risk of being shot by their enemies to do so.
* The truce is dramatised in the 2005 French film &quot;Joyeux Noël&quot; (&quot;Merry Christmas&quot;), depicted through the eyes of French, British and German soldiers. The film, written and directed by Christian Carion, was screened out of competition at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, but was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.
* The opera &quot;Silent Night&quot; by composer Kevin Puts and librettist Mark Campbell had its world premiere at the Ordway Theater, Saint Paul, Minnesota, on 12 November 2011. The libretto is based on the screenplay for the 2005 film &quot;Joyeux Noël&quot;. In 2012 Kevin Puts was named the &quot;Pulitzer Prize&quot; Winner in Music for this opera.
* Ahead of the centenary of the truce, English composer Chris Eaton and singer Abby Scott produced the song, &quot;1914 – The Carol of Christmas&quot;, to benefit British armed forces charities. At 5 December 2014, it had reached top of the iTunes Christmas chart.
* Sainsbury&#x27;s produced a short film for the 2014 Christmas season as an advertisement re-enacting the events of the Christmas truce, primarily following a young English soldier in the trenches.
* In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 2017 Christmas Special &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;, the First and Twelfth Doctors become accidentally involved in the fate of a British captain seemingly destined to die in No Man&#x27;s Land in a standoff with a German soldier. The Twelfth Doctor sent him a few hours forward in time so that the start of the Christmas truce would prevent him from being killed.
* On 29 October 2021 the Swedish heavy-metal band Sabaton released their single ‘Christmas Truce’ about the events of those fateful December days in 1914, followed 40 days later by an animated story video set to the song in cooperation with the animated history YouTube channel Yarnhub.

=== Monuments ===

A Christmas truce memorial was unveiled in Frelinghien, France, on 11 November 2008. At the spot where their regimental ancestors came out from their trenches to play football on Christmas Day 1914, men from the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welch Fusiliers played a football match with the German Battalion 371. The Germans won 2–1. On 12 December 2014, a memorial was unveiled at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, England by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and the England national football team manager Roy Hodgson. The &quot;Football Remembers&quot; memorial was designed by a ten-year-old schoolboy, Spencer Turner, after a UK-wide competition.

=== Annual re-enactments ===
The Midway Village in Rockford, Illinois, United States, has hosted re-enactments of the Christmas Truce.

=== Last survivor ===
The last known living participant of the Christmas Truce was Alfred Anderson. He served as part of the 1/5th Angus and Dundee Battalion of the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment). He died on 21 November 2005, aged 109, nearly 91 years after the famous truce.

<text>Votkinsk (; ), also known as Votka (; ), is an industrial town in the Udmurt Republic, Russia. The population in 2021 is 97,471.

==History==
It was established in 1759, initially as a center for metallurgical enterprises, and the economic focus on metal related industry remains. Town status was officially granted to it in 1935.

The city of Votkinsk was one of the residence centers of the Udmurt Jews, who spoke &quot;Udmurtish&quot; &quot;Yiddish&quot;.
It is famous as the birthplace of composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Votkinsk serves as the administrative center of Votkinsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of republic significance of Votkinsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of republic significance of Votkinsk is incorporated as Votkinsk Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
The Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology operates a machine plant in the town, the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant, which produces some of Russia&#x27;s long-range ballistic missiles. Under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union, the RSD-10 Pioneer missile production facility at Votkinsk was selected for long-term on-site monitoring by U.S. inspectors. The corresponding site for the Soviet Union in the United States was the Hercules missile production facility in Salt Lake City, Utah.

The town gives its name to the nearby Votkinsk Reservoir, filled in the 1960s following the construction of a dam for the Votkinsk Hydroelectric Station.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Votkinsk has a warm summer continental climate. (Koppen Dfb)

==Sports==
The bandy team Znamya-Udmurtiya has played in the highest division, and nowadays play in the second highest, Russian Bandy Supreme League.

==Notable people==
* Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840–1893), Russian composer
* Rudolf Povarnitsyn (born 1962), Ukrainian high jumper
* Ksenia Garanina (born 1997), Armenian footballer
* Liudmyla Kuchma (born 1940), wife of second Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and a former First Lady of Ukraine.

<doc id="417264" wikidata="Q1065130" url="?curid=417264" title="Strangeways, Here We Come">
<text>Strangeways, Here We Come is the fourth and final studio album by the English rock band the Smiths. It was released on 28 September 1987 by Rough Trade Records, several months after the group disbanded. All of the songs were composed by Johnny Marr, with lyrics written and sung by Morrissey. 

The album reached number two on the UK Albums Chart, staying in the chart for 17 weeks. The album also became an international success, peaking at number 16 in the European Albums Chart; from sales covering the 18 major European countries, staying in that chart for nine weeks. It rose to number 55 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 1 October 1987 and also by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 19 September 1990.

==Recording==
The Smiths recorded what was to be their final studio album at the Wool Hall studios in Beckington, Somerset, England (established and then-owned by the band Tears for Fears). Between the album&#x27;s recording in March and its release in September 1987, Johnny Marr left the group, ending the band. &quot;Strangeways&quot; is the only Smiths album to feature Morrissey playing a musical instrument: piano, on the song &quot;Death of a Disco Dancer&quot;.

Marr felt the band was ready to enter a new musical phase, and was determined to avoid a formula and move away from their previous &quot;jingle jangle&quot; sound. He started to look for different influences, finding an interest in the Beatles&#x27; self-titled 1968 album. Marr further stated that he intended &quot;Strangeways&quot; as an homage to early records by the Walker Brothers. The band&#x27;s instrumentation branched out as well, including synthesised saxophone, string arrangements on keyboards, and drum machine additions.

Recording in the Wool Hall made the sessions more relaxed, as the wine cellar was fully stocked and producer Stephen Street came slowly to understand the idea that the writing partners Morrissey and Marr were trying to put forth. Street (who engineered previous Smiths efforts) later said that there would always be late-night drinking following the recording sessions. &quot;That was always after Morrissey had gone to bed ... it wasn&#x27;t really his bag. We&#x27;d carry on finishing overdubs and then the records would come out. We&#x27;d be partying all hours&quot;. Ed Power wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot; that &quot;Everyone else was more than willing to join [Marr] in this new love affair. Parties at Wool House became a nightly event. With Morrissey tucked up in bed with his favourite Sylvia Plath anthology, the musicians would cover their favourite Spinal Tap songs into the wee hours&quot;.

Morrissey and Marr have stated that the album is the band&#x27;s best, with Morrissey adding, &quot;We say it quite often. At the same time. In our sleep. But in different beds&quot;. Drummer Mike Joyce also named the album as the band&#x27;s best.

Two final songs were recorded in May 1987 to provide B-sides for the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot;. These were the Smiths&#x27; last recordings together. Three more singles were taken from &quot;Strangeways, Here We Come&quot;; their B-sides were drawn from archival recordings.

==Artwork and title==
The sleeve for &quot;Strangeways, Here We Come&quot;, which was designed by Morrissey, features a murky shot of actor Richard Davalos, best known for appearing in the 1955 film &quot;East of Eden&quot;. In the photo, Davalos is looking at his costar in that film, James Dean, who is cropped from the image. Dean was a hero of Morrissey&#x27;s, about whom the singer wrote a book called &quot;James Dean Is Not Dead&quot;. Five years later, when designing the sleeves for the U.S. release of WEA&#x27;s &quot;Best... I&quot; compilation, Morrissey again chose Davalos as a cover star, and Davalos is looking at Dean, who is once again cropped.

As revealed in Jo Slee&#x27;s collection of Smiths and Morrissey sleeve artwork, &quot;Peepholism&quot;, Davalos was not the original choice for cover star. Morrissey wanted to use a still of Harvey Keitel in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;I Call First&quot; (also known as &quot;Who&#x27;s That Knocking at My Door&quot;), but Keitel declined to allow him to use the image. In 1991, Keitel relented, and the image was used on T-shirts and stage backdrops for Morrissey&#x27;s 1991 Kill Uncle Tour.

The album takes its title from Manchester&#x27;s notorious Strangeways Prison (now called HM Prison Manchester), whilst the line &quot;Borstal, here we come&quot; is taken from the novel &quot;Billy Liar&quot;. &quot;Strangeways, of course, is that hideous Victorian monstrosity of a prison operating 88 to a cell,&quot; Morrissey has said.

Marr has said &quot;I&#x27;ve learned to love the title ... it was a bit overstating things somewhat. A little bit obvious. But it&#x27;s OK. I was always intrigued by the word Strangeways. I remember as a kid, when I first heard that the prison was really called that, I wondered had it not occurred to anybody to change the name? It&#x27;s still befuddling, really&quot;. Morrissey has also stated, &quot;Really it&#x27;s me throwing both arms to the skies and yelling &#x27;Whatever next?

==Critical reception==

The album ranked number 3 among &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; for 1987 in the annual &quot;NME&quot; critics&#x27; poll, and &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot; ranked number 11 among songs. In 2000 it was voted number 601 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said the record &quot;stands as one of their best and most varied&quot;. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 69 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;, writing that &quot;Whether or not &quot;Strangeways, Here We Come&quot; ended the Smiths&#x27; brief career with their best album has been the subject of considerable debate for nearly a quarter century, but it definitively stands as the band&#x27;s most lush, richest work.&quot;

Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it was &quot;a subtly shaded and skilled album, one boasting a fuller production than before ... while it doesn&#x27;t match &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; or &quot;The Smiths&quot;, it is far from embarrassing and offers a summation of the group&#x27;s considerable strengths.&quot;

<doc id="417265" wikidata="Q632138" url="?curid=417265" title="Charlotte Coliseum">
<text>Charlotte Coliseum was a multi-purpose sports and entertainment arena located in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was operated by the Charlotte Coliseum Authority, which also oversees the operation of Bojangles Coliseum, which was called Charlotte Coliseum prior to 1988, the Charlotte Convention Center, and Ovens Auditorium. It was the home of the NBA&#x27;s Charlotte Hornets from 1988 to 2002, and the Charlotte Bobcats, the second incarnation of the Charlotte Hornets, from 2004 to 2005.

The Coliseum hosted 371 consecutive NBA sell-outs from December 1988 to November 1997, which includes seven playoff games. It hosted its final NBA basketball game on October 26, 2005, a preseason game between the Charlotte Bobcats and the Indiana Pacers.

The city of Charlotte sold the property and the building, along with a Maya Lin commission outside it, was demolished via implosion on June 3, 2007. 

This was the second building to use the name &quot;Charlotte Coliseum&quot;; Bojangles Coliseum, located on Independence Boulevard, originally opened as the Coliseum in 1955 and is still in use. 

==History==

Construction on the Charlotte Coliseum began in 1986 and was opened on August 11, 1988, with a dedication by the Reverend Billy Graham. The architects, Odell Associates, claimed to have built a state-of-the-art venue, complete with a large eight-sided video scoreboard, but the arena contained far fewer luxury suites than other arenas built in that era. George Shinn had used the under-construction arena as his hole card to get the NBA to place a team in the city. With almost 24,000 seats, it was not only the largest venue in the league, but the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. Some thought the Coliseum was too big, but Shinn believed the area&#x27;s longstanding support for college basketball made the Coliseum a more-than-viable home for an NBA team.

The day after the dedication, the United States Olympic basketball team was scheduled to play an exhibition game at the Coliseum. While preparing for the event, the 40,000-pound, $3.2 million scoreboard was being repositioned when it struck the ceiling and crashed to the floor, destroying both it and the court it landed on—an alternate floor was brought from the old Coliseum in time for the game that night.

The Hornets would go on to lead the NBA in attendance in eight of its first nine seasons playing in &quot;The Hive&quot;. At one point, they sold out 371 consecutive games, or nearly nine consecutive seasons. However, poorly received decisions made by Shinn, as well as anger over personal scandals involving him, caused fan support to dwindle, and by then the Coliseum was seen by many as outdated and no longer suitable to be the home of a major professional sports team. When the Hornets relocated to New Orleans, in 2002, the Hornets&#x27; attendance had dropped to last in the 29-team league.

The Coliseum had fewer amenities than other NBA arenas built in its time. &quot;As nice as the building was, it was ... the last
of the propeller airplanes before the jets came,&quot; said Max Muhleman of Charlotte-based Private Sports Consulting. While the Palace of Auburn Hills, which opened the same year, contained 180 luxury suites, the Coliseum had just eight.

In 2005 the Charlotte Coliseum was replaced with Charlotte Bobcats Arena (now Spectrum Center) located in the First Ward of Uptown Charlotte. One of the Coliseum&#x27;s last functions before being shuttered was ironically to serve as a shelter for people fleeing New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005.

==Tenants==
Although the Hornets were the best-known tenants of the Coliseum, many other teams called The Hive home.

The Charlotte Sting of the WNBA began play in the Coliseum upon their inception in 1997, but had moved to Spectrum Center in 2006. During most Sting games, the upper level and a portion of the lower level were curtained off, reducing capacity to around 10,000. However, during the Sting&#x27;s unexpected run to the WNBA Finals in 2001, they attracted the largest crowd in WNBA history to one playoff game.

The Charlotte 49ers played in the Coliseum during their final days in the Sun Belt Conference from 1988 through 1993. The Coliseum also played host to the 1989 Sun Belt men&#x27;s basketball tournament, setting a record for attendance. They moved back to their old home, Bojangles Coliseum (then known as Independence Arena) for the 1993–94 season, partly due to a desire for a more intimate atmosphere. The 49ers rarely came close to filling the arena, and they were frequently swallowed up in the environment. Additionally, the Coliseum was located on the opposite side of the county from UNC Charlotte&#x27;s campus, and was thus inconvenient to most of its student body.

Two now-defunct Arena Football League teams played in the Coliseum—the Charlotte Rage (1992–96) and the Carolina Cobras (2003–04).

When the NBA returned to Charlotte in 2004 with the expansion Bobcats, they played their first season (2004–05) in the Coliseum as what became the Spectrum Center was being built.

Although the Coliseum and all but one of its parking lots had been demolished as of September 2013, the street leading to the grounds named Hive Drive (after the Coliseum&#x27;s nickname of &quot;The Hive&quot;, which has since been applied to the second Hornets&#x27; home arena) and a sign at the beginning guiding drivers to the Coliseum and surrounding amenities remained for some time afterward. Additionally, for some years after the arena&#x27;s demolition, signs on Billy Graham Parkway continued to direct drivers to the &quot;Coliseum Area.&quot;

==Notable events==
The arena was also used for large-scale college basketball events in order to compete with the Piedmont Triad and Research Triangle areas of the state which are the heart of the state&#x27;s college basketball culture. The Coliseum hosted the 1994 Men&#x27;s Final Four and the 1996 Women&#x27;s Final Four (both jointly hosted by Davidson College and UNC Charlotte), in addition to NCAA tournament regionals, sub-regionals, eight ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournaments and the 1989 Sun Belt Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

It also hosted the 1991 NBA All-Star Game. It was also the site of WWE&#x27;s Unforgiven 1999 and Judgment Day 2003.

In addition to the many sporting events hosted at the Coliseum, it hosted large concerts. The first concert was not long after the grand opening and featured Frank Sinatra. Another blue-eyed crooner, Rick &quot;The Big Bopper&quot; Sammons, was the final performer to entertain in the Coliseum.
===In film===
The Coliseum was home to filming of the movie &quot;Eddie&quot; in 1996, and was the Tech Dome, home of the fictitious Tech University in the 1998 film &quot;He Got Game&quot;. It was the venue for the 2000 stand-up comedy film &quot;The Original Kings of Comedy&quot;; it was also featured in 2002&#x27;s &quot;Juwanna Mann&quot;.

==Current use==
City Park, a mixed-use development, was constructed on the former site. City Park includes town homes, apartments, hotels, and restaurants. A plaque honoring the former arena is placed near the front of the development.

<doc id="417266" wikidata="Q4906580" url="?curid=417266" title="Big Tobacco">
<text>Big Tobacco is a name used to refer to the largest companies in the tobacco industry.

==Overview==
According to the World Medical Journal, the five largest tobacco companies are: 

* Japan Tobacco International, based in Japan, Switzerland, and the United States
* Philip Morris International, based in the United States and Switzerland
* British American Tobacco, based in England
* Imperial Brands, based in England
* China Tobacco, based in China

These companies have substantial power economically, with revenues matching some small countries. These companies are well known for lobbying governments, advocating for looser restrictions and lower taxes.

These companies have garnered significant controversy for the product they produce and the tactics with which they sell and market them. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States. Despite a general decrease in cigarette use in the United States, there has been no change in the use of smokeless tobacco, which can also cause cancer.

Some of the tactics utilized by these companies have been noted to be similar to that of other industries such as the oil, sugar, and cell phone industries.

These companies are controversial due to the negative health effects of the products they produce, and attempts to misinform on this topic. In the United States, the big five tobacco companies have worked together to conceal scientific evidence on the negative effects of tobacco. There is also a history of manipulating and destroying evidence.

The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was designed by the World Health Assembly as an international legal approach to reducing the effect of tobacco on public health. However, its implementation has also been interfered with by these tobacco companies. Tobacco companies have also been known to foster relations with governments and communities to maintain loose regulations on tobacco products.

<doc id="417267" wikidata="Q27075915" url="?curid=417267" title="Magnolia warbler">
<text>The magnolia warbler (Setophaga magnolia) is a member of the wood warbler family Parulidae.

==Etymology==

The genus name &quot;Setophaga&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;ses&quot;, &quot;moth&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, &quot;eating&quot;, and the specific &quot;magnolia&quot; refers to the type locality. American ornithologist Alexander Wilson found this species in magnolias near Fort Adams, Mississippi.

==Description==

This species is a moderately small New World warbler. It measures in length and spans across the wings. Body mass in adult birds can range from , though weights have reportedly ranged up to prior to migration. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . The magnolia warbler can be distinguished by its coloration. The breeding males often have white, gray, and black backs with yellow on the sides; yellow and black-striped stomachs; white, gray, and black foreheads and beaks; distinct black tails with white stripes on the underside; and defined white patches on their wings, called wing bars. Breeding females usually have the same type of coloration as the males, except that their colors are much duller. Immature warblers also resemble the same dull coloration of the females. The yellow and black-striped stomachs help one to distinguish the males from other similar birds, like the prairie warbler and Kirtland&#x27;s warbler (which, however, have a breeding range to the south and east of the magnolia warbler&#x27;s).

==Distribution and habitat==
The magnolia warbler is found in the northern parts of some Midwestern states and the very northeastern parts of the US, with states such as Minnesota and Wisconsin comprising its southernmost boundaries. However, it is mostly found across the northern parts of Canada, such as in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. During the winter, the warbler migrates through the eastern half of the United States to southern Mexico and Central America. The warbler breeds in dense forests, where it will most likely be found among the branches of young, densely packed, coniferous trees. The magnolia warbler migrates to the warmer south in the winter, wintering in southeastern Mexico, Panama, and parts of the Caribbean. In migration it passes through the eastern part of the United States as far west as Oklahoma and Kansas. During migration season, the magnolia warbler can be found in various types of woodlands.

==Life cycle==
The magnolia warbler undergoes multiple molts during its lifetime. The first molts begin while the young offspring are still living in the nest, while the rest take place on or near their breeding grounds. The warblers molt, breed, care for their offspring, and then migrate. Chicks hatch after a two-week incubation period, and can fledge from the nest after close to another two weeks when their feathers are more developed. After about a month, the chicks can leave the nest to begin living (and later breeding) on their own since they are solitary birds. Magnolia warblers typically live up to seven years.

== Hybridization ==
Rare hybrids between the magnolia warbler and the congeneric American redstart (&quot;Setophaga ruticilla&quot;) have been documented on two occasions, in Ohio, USA, and Quebec, Canada. In both cases, the hybrid&#x27;s mother was a magnolia warbler and the father was a redstart. 

==Behavior==

===Diet and feeding===
This warbler usually eats any type of arthropod, but their main delicacies are caterpillars. The warbler also feeds on different types of beetles, butterflies, spiders, and fruit during their breeding season, while they increase their intake of both fruit and nectar during the winter. These birds also tend to eat parts of the branches of mid-height coniferous trees, such as spruce firs, in their usual breeding habitat.

===Songs===

Researchers have observed two different types of songs in male magnolia warblers. Their songs have been referred to as the First Category song and the Second Category song. These songs have two distinct purposes – one used to attract mates, and the other to defend territory. Females, while they do sing, have not been observed to have separate songs for different situations. Both males and females have call notes that they use for various alerts: the females have short call notes to signal when a human observer is watching them, and the males have short call notes to signal when any sort of threatening predators are close to their offspring.

===Reproduction===

Male magnolia warblers go to their breeding grounds about two weeks before the females arrive. After the females come to the breeding grounds, both the males and females cooperate to build the nest for a week. Because of the difficulty of locating their nests among the forest&#x27;s dense undergrowth, it is hard to know whether the warblers re-use their original nests each breeding season, or whether they abandon them for new ones. The nests are built in their tree of choice – different types of fir trees, such as &quot;Abies balsamea&quot; (balsam fir) and &quot;Picea glauca&quot; (spruce fir). The nest is made up of grass, twigs, and horsehair fungus, and they are relatively small, shallow, circular-shaped nests, barely exceeding 10 cm on all sides. The nests are usually found close to the ground, commonly in the lowest three meters of the firs.

Female magnolia warblers usually lay three to five eggs during each breeding season. The female will not incubate her eggs until all of them are laid. The female sits on the eggs for about two weeks before the eggs hatch. The female is also the one that warms the newborn chicks by brooding, or sitting, on the nest; she is also the one who feeds the newborn chicks most frequently, though the males also engage in feeding the offspring at times. Because the males are technically as equally responsible for feeding the newborns as the females are, this means that the males are monogamous because they expend a large amount of energy looking for food for their young. In order to keep the nest clean, females eat the fecal sacs of their newborns; as the chicks grow older, both parents simply remove the sacs from the nest. The baby warblers are ready to fly out of the nest by the time they are ten days old.

==Conservation==

The magnolia warbler is assessed on the IUCN Red List as least concern for conservation because it is fairly widespread and common within its habitat and not at risk of extinction. Research has shown that a good percentage of warblers die from flying into television towers in their migratory path. Also, parts of their habitat have been degraded as coniferous forests are cleared which causes the number of warblers living in a habitat to decrease, but they certainly are not greatly affected by the deforestation. While the deforestation does decrease the warbler population in the specific area that it occurs in, the species is not significantly impacted overall due to the general abundance of the species throughout the region.

==In art==

John James Audubon illustrated the magnolia warbler in &quot;The Birds of America&quot;, Second Edition (published, London 1827–38) as Plate 123 under the title, &quot;Black &amp; Yellow Warbler – &quot;Sylvia maculosa&quot;&quot; where a pair of birds (male and female) are shown searching flowering raspberry for insects. The image was engraved and colored by Robert Havell&#x27;s London workshops. The original watercolor by Audubon was purchased by the New York History Society.

<text>Angkor Thom ( ; meaning &quot;Great City&quot;), alternatively Nokor Thom ( ), located in present-day Cambodia, was the last and most enduring capital city of the Khmer Empire. It was established in the late twelfth century by King Jayavarman VII. It covers an area of 9 km², within which are located several monuments from earlier eras as well as those established by Jayavarman and his successors. At the centre of the city is Jayavarman&#x27;s state temple, the Bayon, with the other major sites clustered around the Victory Square immediately to the north. The site is one of the major tourist attractions of Southeast Asia.

==Etymology==
Angkor Thom () is the transform name from another alternative name of Nokor Thom (), which is believed to be the correct one, due to neglect of calling it in incorrect pronunciation. The word &quot;Nokor&quot; (, ) is literally derived from Sanskrit word of &quot;Nagara&quot; (Devanāgarī: नगर), which means &quot;City&quot;, combining with Khmer word &quot;Thom&quot; (, ), which means &quot;Big&quot; or &quot;Great&quot; so as to form &quot;Nokor Thom&quot; then being altered to current name of &quot;Angkor Thom&quot;.

== History ==
Angkor Thom was established as the capital of Jayavarman VII&#x27;s empire and was the centre of his massive building program. One inscription found in the city refers to Jayavarman as the groom and the city as his bride.

Angkor Thom seems not to be the first Khmer capital on the site, however. Yasodharapura, dating from three centuries earlier, was centred slightly further northwest, and Angkor Thom overlapped parts of it. The most notable earlier temples within the city are the former state temple of Baphuon, and Phimeanakas, which was incorporated into the Royal Palace. The Khmers did not draw any clear distinctions between Angkor Thom and Yashodharapura; even in the 14th century, an inscription used the earlier name. The name of Angkor Thom—great city—was in use from the 16th century.

The last temple known to have been constructed in Angkor Thom was Mangalartha, which was dedicated in 1295. Thereafter the existing structures continued to be modified from time to time, but any new creations were in perishable materials and have not survived.

The Ayutthaya Kingdom, led by King Borommarachathirat II, sacked Angkor Thom, forcing the Khmers under Ponhea Yat to relocate their capital southeast to Phnom Penh.

Angkor Thom was abandoned sometime prior to 1609, when an early western visitor wrote of an uninhabited city, &quot;as fantastic as the Atlantis of Plato&quot;. It is believed to have sustained a population of 80,000–150,000 people.

&quot;The Poem of Angkor Wat&quot; composed in Khmer verse in 1622 describes the beauty of Angkor Thom.

==Style==
Angkor Thom is in the Bayon style. This manifests itself in the large scale of the construction, in the widespread use of laterite, in the face-towers at each of the entrances to the city and in the naga-carrying giant figures which accompany each of the towers.

==The site==
The city lies on the west bank of the Siem Reap River, a tributary of Tonle Sap, about a quarter of a mile from the river. The south gate of Angkor Thom is 7.2 km north of Siem Reap, and 1.7 km north of the entrance to Angkor Wat. The walls, 8 m high and flanked by a moat, are each 3 km long, enclosing an area of 9 km². The walls are of laterite buttressed by earth, with a parapet on the top. There are gates at each of the cardinal points, from which roads lead to the Bayon at the centre of the city. As the Bayon itself has no wall or moat of its own, those of the city are interpreted by archaeologists as representing the mountains and oceans surrounding the Bayon&#x27;s Mount Meru. Another gate—the Victory Gate—is 500 m north of the east gate; the Victory Way runs parallel to the east road to the Victory Square and the Royal Palace north of the Bayon. It is around 30 minutes from central Siem Reap.

The faces on the 23 m towers at the city gates, which are later additions to the main structure, take after those of the Bayon and pose the same problems of interpretation. They may represent the king himself, the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, guardians of the empire&#x27;s cardinal points, or some combination of these. A causeway spans the moat in front of each tower: these have a row of devas on the left and asuras on the right, each row holding a naga in the attitude of a tug-of-war. This appears to be a reference to the myth, popular in Angkor, of the Churning of the Sea of Milk. The temple-mountain of the Bayon, or perhaps the gate itself, would then be the pivot around which the churning takes place. The nagas may also represent the transition from the world of men to the world of the gods (the Bayon), or be guardian figures. The gateways themselves are 3.5 by 7 m, and would originally have been closed with wooden doors. The south gate is now by far the most often visited, as it is the main entrance to the city for tourists.
At each corner of the city is a Prasat Chrung—corner shrine—built of sandstone and dedicated to Avalokiteshvara. These are cruciform with a central tower and oriented towards the east.

Within the city was a system of canals, through which water flowed from the northeast to the southwest. The bulk of the land enclosed by the walls would have been occupied by the 
secular buildings of the city, of which nothing remains. This area is now covered by forest.

Most of the great Angkor ruins have vast displays of bas-relief depicting the various gods, goddesses, and other-worldly beings from the mythological stories and epic poems of Hinduism. Mingled with these images are actual known animals, like elephants, snakes, fish, and monkeys, in addition to dragon-like creatures that look like the stylized, elongated serpents (with feet and claws) found in Chinese art.

But among the ruins of Ta Prohm, near a huge stone entrance, one can see that the &quot;roundels on pilasters on the south side of the west entrance are unusual in design.&quot;

What one sees are roundels depicting various common animals—pigs, monkeys, water buffaloes, roosters, and snakes. There are no mythological figures among the roundels, so one can reasonably conclude that these figures depict the animals that were commonly seen by the ancient Khmer people in the twelfth century.

<text>A campaign desk is an antique desk of normal size which was used by officers and their staffs in rear areas during a military campaign.

The campaign desk was usually the private property of the officer, as was his uniform and other military implements. It was in general handcrafted by a master cabinet maker according to the officer&#x27;s wishes or following traditions for such desks. The desk forms varied greatly, but nearly all had as a common trait several features which made it easy to transport them from one campaign posting to another. 

For instance, a campaign desk version of a traditional pedestal desk form would have strong but removable fittings making it easy to break up the desk in three pieces: two pedestals and one desktop surface. Each piece would have brass or iron handles mounted on it to facilitate handling.

Campaign desk variations of the antique writing table seem to have been rather frequent. This form was usually in one piece, with strong handles and two pairs of folding legs. 

A smaller version of such a transportable writing table could be considered to be more a field desk than a campaign desk, since it could be moved frequently from one battlefield&#x27;s rear area to another as the war went on.

Any campaign desk is in a sense also a portable desk.

<doc id="417277" wikidata="Q168917" url="?curid=417277" title="Flag of the Comoros">
<text>The national flag of the Union of the Comoros was designed in 2001 and officially adopted on 23 December of that year. It continues to display the crescent and four stars, which is a motif that has been in use in various forms since 1975 during the independence movement. In its constitution, the government of the Comoros refers to the insignia as (&#x27;national emblem&#x27;), though it is understood to actually represent a flag.

==Colours==
The colours are defined in the constitution as simply yellow, white, red, blue, and green. Nowhere does the government document any specific colour shades.
For lack of any official standard, the colours used at the 2012 Olympics are shown in the table below.
==Design==
The design consists of a white crescent with four white five-pointed stars inside of a green triangle. The flag has four stripes, representing the four main islands of the nation: yellow for Mohéli, white for Mayotte (a French department claimed by the Comoros), red for Anjouan and blue for Grande Comore. The four stars on the flag also symbolize the four islands. The star and crescent, as well as the colour green on the flag, symbolise their main religion, Islam.

The stars&#x27; points are usually orientated upwards, as reflected in the model supplied when the flag was adopted, though legal documents concerning the flag do not specify the flag&#x27;s orientation and there is a variant in which the stars point outwards and not up.

==History==
The first official flag of Comoros was designed and adopted for local use in 1963 by Suzanne Gauthier, before Comoros gained its independence. It had a white crescent at upper hoist facing the fly, four stars in a diagonal, and used a 5:7 proportion with a green background. This design continued to be used after independence in 1975.

The flag changed in 1975 under Ali Soilih. The crescent was moved and the stars were rearranged into a diamond. Two thirds of the flag became red and symbolized the regime&#x27;s socialist ideology. This flag shares the design to that of the Soviet-era and post-1995 Belarusian flags.

When Ahmed Abdallah returned to the presidency in 1978, the flag changed again. It returned to being completely green, with the crescent moving to the centre of the flag and the stars forming a line between its horns. Information about the proportions of this variant suggest either a 1:2, 2:3, or 3:5 ratio.

With the adoption of a new constitution in 1992, the flag changed again, with the crescent and stars rotated to face upward rather than down and to the right.

The adoption of yet another constitution changed the flag again in 1996, rotating the flag to face the fly and adding a white inscription to the lower hoist and another to the upper fly. The inscriptions are written in Arabic calligraphy with the former reading &quot;Muhammed&quot; and the latter reading &quot;Allah&quot;. The proportions of this flag were reported to be 7:5 (1.4:1). This flag was changed by referendum in 2001 to the modern one.

From 1996 until 2001, variants of the Comorian national flag supplied mainly by Annin Flagmakers contained the names &quot;Muhammad&quot; and &quot;Allah&quot; written out in longform. A similar flag using this design was flown outside the United Nations headquarters in 2000, which caught the attention of the Comorian ambassador, resulting in him rejecting the flag flown on display.

<text>Interstate 680 (I-680) is a north–south auxiliary Interstate Highway in Northern California. It curves around the eastern cities of the San Francisco Bay Area from San Jose to I-80 at Fairfield, bypassing cities along the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay such as Oakland and Richmond while serving others more inland such as Pleasanton and Concord.

Built in the 1920s as SR 21 and designated in 1955, I-680 begins at a junction with I-280 and US Route 101 (US 101/Bayshore Freeway) and heads northeast and north-northwest through the northeast part of San Jose. After passing State Route 237 (SR 237) in Milpitas and SR 262 in Fremont, I-680 abruptly turns northeast (where a connection to a SR 238 freeway was planned) and enters the hills and valleys of the California Coast Ranges. The highway crosses over Mission Pass, also known as the Sunol Grade, and descends into the Sunol Valley, where it meets SR 84 near Sunol. From Sunol, I-680 again heads north-northwesterly through valleys, including the San Ramon Valley, along the Calaveras Fault. Junctions along this portion include I-580 in Dublin and SR 24 in Walnut Creek. Beyond the latter interchange, a three-way directional junction with the SR 24 freeway west to Oakland, I-680 heads north into Pleasant Hill, where SR 242 splits and I-680 again heads northwesterly. After the junction with SR 4 in Martinez, the highway crosses the Carquinez Strait on the Benicia–Martinez Bridge, immediately meeting the east end of I-780 on the Benicia end. The remainder of I-680, from Benicia to I-80 at Fairfield, lies between a hilly area to the west representing the southwestern tip of the Vaca Mountains, and a marshy area (along the Suisun Bay and Cordelia Slough) to the east.

==Route description==

The route begins at US 101 at the Joe Colla Interchange, where it acts as a continuation of I-280 eastward. From here, it begins its journey northward through San Jose, where it meets the Capitol Expressway, signed as County Route G21 (CR G21), about northeast of I-680&#x27;s southern terminus. The next exit northbound is SR 130, which is also known as Alum Rock Avenue, unsigned at the intersection. As it continues through Santa Clara County, it meets numerous local roads before interchanging with the Montague Expressway (CR G4). Here, it exits San Jose and enters the city of Milpitas, where it meets SR 237, often referred to as Calaveras Boulevard. After one more intersection, I-680 exits Santa Clara County and enters Alameda County.

In Alameda County, the freeway begins in the city of Fremont, where it intersects SR 262, which was unsigned until 2000. Continuing through the city, it meets Mission Boulevard at SR 238 before exiting the city. Prior to 2002, two ghost ramps existed here, remains of an abandoned freeway project replacing Mission Boulevard. Amid Alameda County, it abruptly turns northeastward and enters a hilly area, where it crosses over Mission Pass, and descends into the Sunol Valley, where it runs concurrently with SR 84 for a short while. Afterward, it enters Pleasanton and intersects with I-580, currently California&#x27;s longest auxiliary Interstate providing access to Oakland and the Central Valley. It enters Dublin for a short segment before exiting the county and entering Contra Costa County.

Upon entering Contra Costa County, the route meets numerous local roads through the cities of San Ramon, Danville, and Alamo before entering Walnut Creek, where it meets SR 24. I-680 then enters Pleasant Hill for a short time and Concord, where it meets SR 242. Upon exiting Concord, it meets SR 4. It then enters Martinez, where it follows the Benicia–Martinez Bridge over the Carquinez Strait, on which the route crosses the county line and enters Benicia in Solano County. On the Benicia–Martinez Bridge, I-680 northbound is tolled, while I-680 southbound is free. In Benicia, I-680 interchanges with I-780. It then exits the city and, after passing through rural areas, routing parallel to the San Joaquin Delta, it enters Fairfield, where it meets I-80, which is the route&#x27;s northern terminus.

In the wake of the September 11 attacks, a US flag was painted on a large piece of concrete on a hill along the Sunol Grade. It stayed there for nine years before the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) painted it over, as the mural had been painted on without authorization. 

Of the above names, only the name &quot;Sinclair Freeway&quot; for its designated portion usually appears on maps, and the other portions on maps are always unnamed, referred to as simply &quot;I-680&quot;.

I-680 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). I-680 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System from the Santa Clara–Alameda county line to SR 24 in Walnut Creek but is only a scenic route from Mission Boulevard to the Contra Costa county line and from the Alameda county line to SR 24; this means that those portions are substantial sections of highway passing through a &quot;memorable landscape&quot; with no &quot;visual intrusions&quot;, where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.

== Tolls ==
===Express lanes===
There are two sections of High-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes along I-680. The southbound HOT lane along I-680 between SR 84 in Alameda County and through the Sunol Grade to SR 237 in Santa Clara County opened on September 20, 2010. The northbound HOT lane along roughly the same stretch, specifically between SR 84 and Auto Mall Parkway in Fremont, opened in October 2020 but initially as high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes; tolling was halted on this segment of I-680 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resumed in fall 2022.

HOT lanes then opened in October 2017 in both directions on the portion from slightly south of Alcosta Boulevard near the Alameda–Contra Costa line to a point between Livorna Road and Rudgear Road near the Alamo–Walnut Creek city limits. On August 20, 2021, the southbound HOT lanes were extended north to Marina Vista Boulevard in Martinez.

, the HOT lanes&#x27; hours of operation is weekdays between 5:00 am and 8:00 pm; they are otherwise free and open to all vehicles at other times. Solo drivers are tolled using a congestion pricing system based on the real-time levels of traffic. Carpools, motorcycles, and clean air vehicles with two or more people are not charged. For clean-air vehicles with a solo driver, 50 percent of the posted toll is charged. All tolls are collected using an open road tolling system, and therefore there are no toll booths to receive cash. Each vehicle using the HOT lanes is required to carry a FasTrak &quot;Flex&quot; transponder with its switch set to indicate the number of the vehicle&#x27;s occupants (1, 2, or 3+). Those with clean air vehicles need to apply for a special FasTrak &quot;CAV&quot; tag. Solo drivers may also use the FasTrak standard tag without the switch. Drivers without any FasTrak tag will be assessed a toll violation regardless of whether they qualified for free.

, there are environmental studies to also extend the northbound toll lanes from Livorna Road to Marina Vista Avenue, as well as closing the nine-mile express lane gap between Sunol and San Ramon. Neither have begun construction, nor are there any near plans to do so.

===Benicia–Martinez Bridge===

Tolls are collected only for northbound traffic on the Benicia–Martinez Bridge headed to Benicia. All-electronic tolling is also used on the bridge, and they can be paid by either a FasTrak transponder or license plate tolling. The high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane leading to the bridge requires a car with three or more people.

==History==

===Historic routing===

By the 1920s, a road ran south from Martinez through Walnut Creek, Dublin, Danville, and Sunol to Mission San Jose, where it met Legislative Route 5 (Mission Boulevard, signed over the years as US 48, US 101E, SR 9, and now SR 238). It was not yet paved south of Dublin, where it crossed Mission Pass between the Sunol Valley and the San Francisco Bay basin. The majority of this roadway was added to the state highway system in 1933 as portions of several routes: Route 108 from Mission San Jose to Sunol, Route 107 from Sunol to Walnut Creek, and Route 75 from Walnut Creek to Pleasant Hill.

At Martinez, the Martinez–Benicia Ferry took automobiles across the Carquinez Strait to Benicia, where Route 7, one of the original state highways from the 1910 bond issue, led north and northeast past Fairfield toward Sacramento and Oregon. The portion north from Benicia to Fairfield became part of Route 74 in 1935, when Route 7 was realigned to the more direct American Canyon route that is now I-80. None of the aforementioned roads were given state sign route numbers in 1934, when that system was laid out, but, by 1937, they had been numbered SR 21. This route began at the intersection of Warm Springs Boulevard and Brown Road in Warm Springs, where Route 5 and Route 69 (SR 17) split, followed Route 5 along Mission Boulevard to Mission San Jose (this part later became a concurrency with SR 9), and then continued to US 40 (Route 7) at Cordelia. The routing was very close to the present I-680, following such roads as Pleasanton Sunol Road, San Ramon Valley Boulevard, Danville Boulevard, Main Street in Walnut Creek, Contra Costa Boulevard, and Pacheco Boulevard.

The portion of SR 21 between Pleasant Hill and Martinez was finally added to the state highway system in 1949, as a branch of Route 75. The ferry approach in Benicia became a spur of Route 74 in 1947, and, in 1953, it was transferred to Route 75. The same law, effective immediately as an urgency measure, authorized the Department of Public Works to acquire the ferry system, then operated by the city of Martinez, which was planning to shut it down. Ownership was transferred just after midnight on October 6, 1953.

===History as an Interstate===
The Bureau of Public Roads approved urban routes of the Interstate Highway System on September 15, 1955, including a loop around the San Francisco Bay, soon numbered I-280 and I-680. The east half (I-680) began at the interchange of US 101 north of Downtown San Jose and followed the Nimitz Freeway (SR 17/Route 69, now I-880) to the split at Warm Springs (the present location of SR 262), SR 21 to Benicia, and Route 74 (no sign route number) to I-80 in Vallejo. The first piece of I-680 freeway built, other than the preexisting Nimitz Freeway, was in the late 1950s, along the SR 24 overlap between North Main Street in Walnut Creek and Monument Boulevard in Pleasant Hill. A southerly extension, bypassing downtown Walnut Creek to South Main Street, opened on March 22, 1960, connecting with the SR 24 freeway to Oakland. In the next decade, the freeway was completed from Vallejo south to SR 238 at Mission San Jose, and the roadway north from Benicia to Fairfield, which became the only remaining piece of SR 21, was also upgraded to freeway standards.

In the 1964 state highway renumbering, the legislative designation was changed to Route 680. SR 17 was officially moved to former Route 5 between San Jose and Warm Springs, which had not had a signed designation since the Nimitz Freeway (then I-680) was constructed, but this was instead marked as part of SR 238 (which replaced SR 9 north of Mission San Jose), and SR 17 remained signed along the Nimitz Freeway. This was very short-lived, as the Bureau of Public Roads approved a shift in the south end of I-680 in October 1964. The legislature changed the routes in 1965, swapping Route 17 and Route 680 south of Warm Springs and creating a new SR 262 on the short roadway at Warm Springs where they had overlapped to switch sides. However, until I-680 was completed in the early-to-mid 1970s, it remained signed along the Nimitz Freeway, and the old road between San Jose and Warm Springs continued to be marked as SR 238. One more change was made to the routing of I-680: in July 1973, the remainder of SR 21, from Benicia to Fairfield, was added to the Interstate Highway System. This became the new alignment of I-680, and the old route to Vallejo became I-780. The corresponding changes were made by the state legislature in 1976.

<text>Scottish Opera is the national opera company of Scotland, and one of the five national performing arts companies of Scotland. Founded in 1962 and based in Glasgow, it is the largest performing arts organisation in Scotland.

==History==
Scottish Opera was founded by conductor Alexander Gibson in 1962. In 1975 it purchased the Theatre Royal in Glasgow from Scottish Television re-opening it as the first national opera house for Scotland in October 1975 with &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;. In March 2005, the management of the Theatre Royal was transferred to the Ambassador Theatre Group, but remains the home of Scottish Opera and of Scottish Ballet.

Scottish Opera dealt with various financial troubles, related to lack of funding and accusations of fiscal profligacy, during the first part of the 2000s. Its cycle of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; was critically acclaimed, but also was highly draining of the company&#x27;s financial resources. In 2004, a financial restructuring plan had called for the elimination of 88 jobs, including all 34 members of the chorus, and the suspension of the entire 2005–06 season. In protest, Sir Richard Armstrong announced his resignation in December 2004, effective at the end of the 2004–05 season.

Alex Reedijk became general director of the company in 2006. In August 2007, effective the same month, the company announced the appointment of Francesco Corti as its next music director.

Recent commissions include the Five:15 Operas Made in Scotland, part of a five-year research and development project to find the next generation of opera-makers, composers and librettists.

==Awards==
The company has won awards, including the Barclays TMA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Opera for &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; (both in 1994) and for &quot;Die Walküre&quot; and &quot;Siegfried&quot; (both in 2002), as well as the South Bank Show Award for &quot;Best Opera&quot; for the &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; (2004) and a Herald Angel Award for &quot;The Two Widows&quot; at the Edinburgh International Festival in 2008.

==Foreign tours==
Scottish Opera has also staged many successful productions abroad, including &quot;Albert Herring&quot; in Florence, &quot;Egisto (opera)&quot; in Venice, tours in Germany, Austria, Portugal, France, Switzerland, Yugoslavia and Iceland and recent years including &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; and &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; in Lisbon; &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Vienna International Festival and the European premiere of MacMillan&#x27;s &quot;Ines de Castro&quot; in Porto, Portugal.

<doc id="417283" wikidata="Q102977" url="?curid=417283" title="Flag of Mauritania">
<text>The national flag of Mauritania () is a green field containing a gold star and crescent, with two red stripes at the top and bottom of the field. The original national flag was introduced under the instructions of President Moktar Ould Daddah and the constitution of 22 March 1959 and was officially adopted on 1 April 1959.

On 5 August 2017, a referendum was held by president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz to change the national flag, abolish the senate, and other constitutional amendments. The referendum was successful, and the new flag, including two red horizontal stripes, which represent &quot;the efforts and sacrifices that the people of Mauritania will keep consenting, to the price of their blood, to defend their territory&quot;, was adopted in time for its first raising on 28 November 2017, the 57th anniversary of Mauritania&#x27;s independence from France.

It is one of the two flags of a currently Arabic-speaking country (the other being Egypt) that uses a shade of yellow. Also, like Egypt, the yellow colour is used in the central emblem (the crescent for Mauritania&#x27;s flag and the Eagle of Saladin for Egypt&#x27;s flag).

==Design==
Green, gold and red are considered Pan-African. Green is also used to symbolise Islam, and the gold is for the sands of the Sahara desert. The red stripes, which were added to the flag in 2017, represent &quot;the efforts and sacrifices that the people of Mauritania will keep consenting, to the price of their blood, to defend their territory&quot;. The crescent and star are symbols of Islam, which is Mauritania&#x27;s official and state religion. There was no official specification or construction sheet for the exact relative measurements of the star and crescent, except the flag&#x27;s measurements of 2:3, until May 2020.

==Specifications==

According to Kennach (government portal of Mauritania), the flag&#x27;s elements are specified as:
* Proportion = 2 : 3 and all following ratios are to width of the flag
* Width of red stripes = 20%
* Width of green area = 60%
* Width of the area of star and crescent = 40%
* Distance between lower red stripe and lower portion of the crescent = 10%
* Diameter of outer circle of the crescent = 75% (50% of length of the flag)
* Maximum width of the crescent = 10.2%
* Distance between maximum width of the crescent and base of the star = 10.7%
* Horns of the crescent are the left and right portions of outer circle
* Distance between upper red stripe and perpendicular vertex of the star = 10%
* Height of the star = 19.1% (i.e. diameter of the star becomes 21.1164%)

==Use==
The design acts as the national flag of Mauritania and is also used in circular form as an aircraft roundel.

===Variants===
Although the constitutional amendments only mentioned the addition of red bands, officials have been using different flag&#x27;s models between the change in 2017 and the official construction sheet released in 2020.
==Legal basis==
The current constitution of 12 July 1991 specifies that:
Unlike the seal, the exact flag is specified, not merely the right for a law to specify it at some later date. However, the flag has its official basis in the earlier constitution of 22 March 1959; no changes were made when the country declared its independence in 1960.

==2017 redesign==
In 2017, a red band at the top and bottom were added to symbolise &quot;the efforts and sacrifices that the people of Mauritania will keep consenting, to the price of their blood, to defend their territory&quot;, in a referendum on 5 August 2017, scheduled by president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz which contained among other constitutional amendments a modification of the national flag and anthem. First scheduled as part of a single vote, these changes proved controversial enough for them to be made into a separate vote on the same day as the vote on institutions.

<text>The national flag of Malaysia, also known as the Stripes of Glory (), is composed of a field of 14 alternating red and white stripes along the fly and a blue canton bearing a crescent and a 14-point star known as the &quot;Bintang Persekutuan&quot; (Federal Star). The 14 stripes, of equal width, represent the equal status in the federation of the 13 member states and the federal territories, while the 14 points of the star represent the unity among these entities. The crescent represents Islam, the country&#x27;s state religion; the blue canton symbolises the unity of the Malaysian people; the yellow of the star and crescent is the royal colour of the Malay rulers, the red stripes represent bravery and the white stripes represent purity. It is in the stars and stripes family of flags.

==Construction sheet==

==History==

===Selection===
In 1949, a year after the Federation of Malaya was created, the Federal Legislative Council called for a contest to design a new national flag. The competition attracted 373 entries, three of which were put forward to the public in a poll held by &quot;The Malay Mail&quot;.

The first flag had a ring of 11 white stars on a blue background, with two red Malay &quot;kris&quot; (daggers) in the middle. The second was the same as the first but with two concentric rings of 5 and 6 stars. The third had 11 blue and white stripes, and a red field in the top-left corner with a white crescent and five-pointed star on it. This last design was chosen as the winner.

In December 1949, the Federal Legislative Council decided to make changes to the winning design. At the suggestion of statesman Onn Jaafar, the red and blue colours were swapped, the crescent and star were changed from white to yellow, and the star was given eleven points. The final version of the Malayan flag was approved by king George VI on 19 May 1950 and was first raised in front of the Sultan of Selangor&#x27;s residence on 26 May 1950. On 31 August 1957, it was raised upon independence at Merdeka Square in place of the British Union Flag.

===Symbolism===
As the flag was finalised for official use, the significance of the design were given as follows:
* Red, white and blue – represents Malaysia as a country belonging in the Commonwealth.
* Crescent and star – represents Islam as the official religion for the Federation, as yellow symbolises sovereignty of the Malay Rulers and their roles as leader of the faith in the constituent states. The eleven-pointed star itself symbolises the &quot;unity and co-operation&quot; of said member states.

===The designer===

The Malayan flag was designed by Mohamed Hamzah, a 29-year-old architect working for the Public Works Department (JKR) in Johor Bahru, in the state of Johor. He entered the national flag design competition with four designs that he had completed in three days. The flag that became one of the three finalists was said to be inspired by the flag of Johor, but with five white stripes added to the blue field.

Mohamed Hamzah died just short of his 75th birthday on 19 February 1993 in Jalan Stulang Baru, Kampung Melayu Majidee, Johor.

===Modifications===

Following the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, the design of the Malayan flag was modified to reflect and honour the new states in the federation.

Three additional stripes were added to the existing flag to make it 14 and the star was given 14 points to reflect the federation of the 11 states in the Malay peninsula plus Sabah, Sarawak, and Singapore; the design remained the same even after Singapore&#x27;s expulsion from the federation two years later. When Kuala Lumpur was designated a Federal Territory on 1 February 1974, the additional stripe and the point in the star were appropriated to represent this new addition to the federation. Eventually, with the addition of two other federal territories, Labuan in 1984 and Putrajaya in 2001, the fourteenth stripe and point in the star came to be associated with the federal territories in general.

In 1997, when Malaysians were invited to name the flag, then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad picked the name &quot;Jalur Gemilang&quot; to project the country&#x27;s onward drive toward continuous growth and success.

==Mark of respect==
During the National Day celebrations, everyone is encouraged to fly the &quot;Jalur Gemilang&quot; at their homes, office buildings, shops and corporate premises.
* If the flag is fixed at home, it is to be raised pointing toward the road.
* If the flag is put in a group of flags with state and private company flags, the Malaysian flag must be raised in between two flags and its pole placed higher than the rest.

===Inappropriate use===
The Malaysian flag is subject to the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act 1963; any act that insults the flag such as waving the flag upside down can be punished with a maximum fine of RM20,000 or a maximum imprisonment of three years or both.

==Historical flags==


==Flag anthem==
The flag anthem is written as dedication and pride of the Malaysian national flag. It is performed on Hari Merdeka, the nation&#x27;s independence day on 31 August every year. The original anthem &quot;Benderaku&quot; was written by Malaysian songwriter Tony Fonseka. After the flag was given the name Jalur Gemilang, the flag anthem was updated in 1997 to reflect this change. This was then followed by an introduction of a new flag anthem, with arrangements by Malaysian songwriter Pak Ngah and lyrics by Malaysian songwriter Siso Kopratasa.
==Other ensigns and flags==
Government vessels use the Jalur Gemilang as the state ensign. The following is a table of the other ensigns used in Malaysia with the national flag inside.

==Federal Star (Bintang Persekutuan)==
The Federal Star is similar in concept of Australia&#x27;s Commonwealth Star in that it symbolises the unity of states in the Malaysian federation and its Federal government, featuring 14 points to represent the federation&#x27;s 13 states and the federal territories. It is also used on the Royal Malaysian Air Force roundel, the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) and the former United Malayan Banking Corporation (UMBC) logo.

The Patani Malayu National Revolutionary Front, a Southern Thai Malay separatist group involved in the South Thailand insurgency, originally adopted an independence flag that incorporated a crescent and 15-point variation of the Federal Star on its flag to represent the southernmost Thai provinces&#x27; closer tie to Malay and Muslim-majority Malaysia over that of Thailand.

<text>The [[National Library of India|National Library at Kolkata]] [[romanisation]] is a widely used transliteration scheme in dictionaries and grammars of Indic languages. This transliteration scheme is also known as &quot;(American) Library of Congress&quot; and is nearly identical to one of the possible ISO 15919 variants. The scheme is an extension of the IAST scheme that is used for transliteration of Sanskrit.

== Scheme table ==
The table below mostly uses Devanagari but it also includes letters from Bengali () and Tamil () to illustrate the transliteration of non-Devanagari characters. 


== Computer input by selection from a screen==

Many systems provide a way to select Unicode characters visually. ISO/IEC 14755 refers to this as a &quot;screen-selection entry method&quot;.

Microsoft Windows has provided a Unicode version of the Character Map program (find it by hitting then type codice_1 then hit ) since version NT 4.0 – appearing in the consumer edition since XP. This is limited to characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). Characters are searchable by Unicode character name, and the table can be limited to a particular code block. More advanced third-party tools of the same type are also available (a notable freeware example is BabelMap).

macOS provides a &quot;character palette&quot; with much the same functionality, along with searching by related characters, glyph tables in a font, etc. It can be enabled in the input menu in the menu bar under System Preferences → International → Input Menu (or System Preferences → Language and Text → Input Sources) or can be viewed under Edit → Emoji &amp; Symbols in many programs.

Equivalent tools – such as gucharmap (GNOME) or kcharselect (KDE) – exist on most Linux desktop environments.

== Font support ==
Only certain fonts support all Latin Unicode characters for the transliteration of Indic scripts according to the ISO 15919 standard. For example, Tahoma supports almost all the characters needed. Arial and Times New Roman font packages that come with Microsoft Office 2007 and later also support most Latin Extended Additional characters like ḍ, ḥ, ḷ, ḻ, ṁ, ṅ, ṇ, ṛ, ṣ and ṭ. The open-source fonts Libertinus Serif and Libertinus Sans (forked from the Linux Libertine project) also have full support.

<text>The yellow warbler (Setophaga petechia) is a New World warbler species. Yellow warblers are the most widespread species in the diverse genus &quot;Setophaga&quot;, breeding in almost the whole of North America, the Caribbean, as well as northern South America.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Setophaga&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;ses&quot;, &quot;moth&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, &quot;eating&quot;, and the specific &quot;petechia&quot; is from Italian &quot;petecchia&quot;, a small red spot on the skin.

==Description and taxonomy==
Other than in male breeding plumage and body size, all warbler subspecies are very similar. Winter, female and immature birds all have similarly greenish-yellow uppersides and are a duller yellow below. Young males soon acquire breast and, where appropriate, head coloration. Females are somewhat duller, most notably on the head. In all, the remiges and rectrices are blackish olive with yellow edges, sometimes appearing as an indistinct wing-band on the former. The eyes and the short thin beak are dark, while the feet are lighter or darker olive-buff.

The 35 subspecies of &quot;S. petechia&quot; can be divided into three main groups according to the males&#x27; head color in the breeding season. Each of these groups is sometimes considered a separate species, or the &quot;aestiva&quot; group (yellow warbler) is considered a species different from &quot;S. petechia&quot; (mangrove warbler, including golden warbler); the latter option is the one currently accepted by the International Ornithological Congress &quot;World Bird List&quot;.

Depending on subspecies, the yellow warbler may be between long, with a wingspan from . They weigh , varying between subspecies and whether on migration or not, globally averaging about but only in most breeding adults of the United States populations. Among standard measurements throughout the subspecies, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . The summer males of this species are generally the yellowest warblers wherever they occur. They are brilliant yellow below and greenish-golden above. There are usually a few wide, somewhat washed-out rusty-red streaks on the breast and flanks. These markings are the reason for the scientific name &quot;petechia&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;liver spotted&quot;. The subspecies in this group mostly vary in brightness and size according to Bergmann&#x27;s and Gloger&#x27;s Rule.

The golden warbler (&quot;petechia&quot; group; 17 subspecies) is generally resident in the mangrove swamps of the West Indies. Local seasonal migrations may occur. On the Cayman Islands for example, &quot;S. p. eoa&quot; was found to be &quot;decidedly scarce&quot; on Grand Cayman and apparently absent from Cayman Brac in November 1979, while it had been a &quot;very common&quot; breeder in the group some ten years before, and not frequently seen in the winters of 1972/1973; apparently, the birds disperse elsewhere outside the breeding season. The Cuban golden warbler (&quot;S. p. gundlachi&quot;) barely reached the Florida Keys where it was first noted in 1941, and by the mid-20th century a breeding population was resident. Though individual birds may stray farther north, their distribution is restricted by the absence of mangrove habitat.

They are generally smallish, usually weighing about or less and sometimes as little as . The summer males differ from those of the yellow warbler in that they have a rufous crown, hood or mask. The races in this group vary in the extent and hue of the head patch.

The mangrove warbler (&quot;erithachorides&quot; group; 12 subspecies) tends to be larger than other yellow warbler subspecies groups, averaging in length and in weight. It is resident in the mangrove swamps of coastal Middle America and northern South America; &quot;S. p. aureola&quot; is found on the oceanic Galápagos Islands. The summer males differ from those of the yellow warbler in having a rufous hood or crown. The races in this group vary in the extent and hue of the hood, overlapping extensively with the golden warbler group in this character.

The American yellow warbler (&quot;aestiva&quot; group; 6 subspecies) breeds in the whole of temperate North America as far south as central Mexico in open, often wet, woods or shrub. It is migratory, wintering in Central and South America. They are very rare vagrants to western Europe and Scandinavia

===Vocalizations===
The song is a musical strophe that can be rendered &quot;sweet sweet sweet, I&#x27;m so sweet&quot;, although it varies considerably between populations. The call is a soft or harder &quot;chip&quot; or &quot;ship&quot;. This is particularly frequently given by females after a male has finished his song. In territorial defense, they give hissing calls, while &quot;seet&quot; seems to be a kind of specialized cowbird alert (see below). Other calls are given in communication between pair-members, neighbors, or by young begging for food. These birds also communicate with postures and perhaps with touch.

==Ecology==
American yellow warblers breed in most of North America from the tundra southwards, except for the far Southwest and the Gulf of Mexico coast. American yellow warblers winter to the south of their breeding range, from southern California to the Amazon region, Bolivia and Peru. The mangrove and golden warblers occur to the south of it, to the northern reaches of the Andes.

American Yellow Warblers arrive in their breeding range in late spring – generally about April/May – and move to winter quarters again starting as early as July, as soon as the young are fledged. Most, however, stay a bit longer; by the end of August, the bulk of the northern populations has moved south, though some may linger almost until fall. At least in northern Ohio, yellow warblers do not linger, leaving as they did 100 years ago.

The breeding habitat of American yellow warblers is typically riparian or otherwise moist land with ample growth of small trees, in particular willows (&quot;Salix&quot;). The other groups, as well as wintering birds, chiefly inhabit mangrove swamps and similar dense woody growth. Less preferred habitat are shrubland, farmlands and forest edges. In particular American yellow warblers will come to suburban or less densely settled areas, orchards and parks, and may well breed there. Outside the breeding season, these warblers are usually encountered in small groups, but while breeding they are fiercely territorial and will try to chase away any conspecific intruder that comes along.

Roughly 60% of their diet is caterpillars. They also consume wasps, mayflies, moths, mosquitoes, beetles, damselflies, treehoppers, other insects, insect larvae, and spiders. They acquire prey by gleaning in shrubs and on tree branches, and by hawking prey that tries to fly away. Other invertebrates and some berries and similar small juicy fruits are also eaten, the latter especially by American yellow warblers in their winter quarters. The yellow warbler is one of several insectivorous bird species that reduce the number of coffee berry borer beetles in Costa Rica coffee plantations by 50%. Caterpillars are the staple food for nestlings, with some – e.g. those of geometer moths (Geometridae) – preferred over others.

The predators of yellow and mangrove warblers are those typical of such smallish tree-nesting passerines, such as snakes, foxes, birds of prey, and many others. The odds of an adult American yellow warbler surviving from one year to the next are on average 50%; in the southern populations, by contrast, about two-thirds of the adults survive each year. Conversely, less than one American yellow warbler nest in three on average suffers from predation in one way or another, while two out of three mangrove and golden warbler nests are affected.

Snakes, including the blue racer (&quot;Coluber constrictor foxii&quot;) and common garter snake (&quot;Thamnophis sirtalis&quot;), are significant nest predators, taking nestlings and fledglings as well as sick or distracted adults. Likewise, corvids such as the American crow (&quot;Corvus brachyrhynchos&quot;) and blue jay (&quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot;), and large climbing rodents, notably the American red squirrel (&quot;Tamiasciurus hudsonicus&quot;) also attack nests in this manner. Carnivores (in particular members of the Musteloidea) including the striped skunk (&quot;Mephitis mephitis&quot;), long-tailed weasel (&quot;Neogale frenata&quot;), common raccoon (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), and domestic or feral cats, are similarly opportunistic predators. All these pose little threat to the nimble, non-nesting adults, which are taken by certain smallish and agile birds such as the American kestrel (&quot;Falco sparverius&quot;) and Cooper&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Accipiter cooperii&quot;), and the sharp-shinned hawk (&quot;A. striatus&quot;). Other avian predators of adults have included peregrine falcons (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;) and merlins (&quot;F. columbarius&quot;). Owls such as great horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;) and eastern screech owls (&quot;Megascops asio&quot;) have been known to assault yellow warblers of all ages at night.

These New World warblers seem to mob predators only rarely. An exception are cowbirds, which are significant brood parasites. The yellow warbler is a regular host of the brown-headed cowbird (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;), with about 40% of all nests suffering attempted or successful parasitism. By contrast, the tropical populations are less frequent hosts to the shiny cowbird (&quot;M. bonariensis&quot;), with only 10% of nests affected. This may be due to the slightly larger size of shiny cowbirds, which are less likely to survive being fed by the much smaller warbler, compared to brown-headed cowbirds. The yellow warbler is one of the few passerine proven to be able to recognize the presence of cowbird eggs in its nest. Upon recognizing one the warbler will often smother it with a new layer of nesting material. It will usually not try to save any of its own eggs that have already been laid, but produce a replacement clutch. Sometimes, the parents desert a parasitized nest altogether and build a new one. Unlike some cuckoos, cowbird nestlings will not actively kill the nestlings of the host bird; mixed broods of &quot;Setophaga&quot; and &quot;Molothrus&quot; may fledge successfully. However, success of fledging in yellow warbler nests is usually decreased by the parasitism of cowbirds due to the pressures of raising a much larger bird.

Other than predation, causes of mortality are not well known. The maximum recorded ages of wild yellow warblers are around 10 years. A wintering American yellow warbler examined near Turbo, Colombia was not infected with blood parasites, unlike other species in the study. It is unclear whether this significant, but wintering birds in that region generally lacked such parasites.

==Breeding==

As usual for members of the &quot;Parulidae&quot;, yellow warblers nest in trees, building a small but very sturdy cup nest. Females and males rear the young about equally, but emphasize different tasks: females are more involved with building and maintaining the nest, and incubating and brooding the offspring. Males are more involved in guarding the nest site and procuring food, bringing it to the nest and passing it to the waiting mother, which does most of the actual feeding. As the young approach fledging, the male&#x27;s workload becomes proportionally higher. 

The American yellow and mangrove (including golden) warblers differ in some other reproductive parameters. While the former is somewhat more of an r-strategist, the actual differences are complex and adapted to different environmental conditions. The yellow warbler starts breeding in May/June, while the mangrove warbler breeds all year round. American yellow warblers have been known to raise a brood of young in as little as 45 days, with 75 the norm. Tropical populations, by contrast, need more than 100 days per breeding. Males court the females with songs, singing 3,200 or more per day. They are, like most songbirds, generally serially monogamous; some 10% of mangrove warbler and about half as many American yellow warbler males are bigamous. Very few if any American yellow warblers breed more than once per year, with just 5% of female mangrove warblers doing so. If a breeding attempt fails, either parent will usually try to raise a second brood.

The clutch of the American yellow warbler is 3–6 (typically 4–5, rarely 1–2) eggs. Incubation usually takes 11 days, sometimes up to 14. The nestlings weigh on average, are brooded for an average 8–9 days after hatching, and leave the nest the following day or the one thereafter. The mangrove warbler has only 3 eggs per clutch on average and incubates some 2 days longer. Its average post-hatching brooding time is 11 days. Almost half of the parents (moreso in the mangrove warbler than the American yellow warbler) attend the fledglings for two weeks or more after these leave the nest. Sometimes the adults separate early, each accompanied by one to three of the young.

Some 3–4 weeks after hatching, the young are fully independent of their parents. They become sexually mature at one year of age, and attempt to breed right away. Some 55% of all American yellow warbler nestings are successful in raising at least one young. In contrast, only 25% of mangrove warbler nests successfully fledge any offspring, with accidents and predation frequently causing total loss of the clutch.

==Status and conservation==
Yellow warblers, in particular the young, devour many pest insects during the breeding season. The plumage and song of the breeding males have been described as &quot;lovely&quot; and &quot;musical&quot;, encouraging ecotourism. No significant negative effects of American yellow and mangrove warblers on humans have been recorded.

Being generally common and occurring over a wide range, the yellow warbler is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN. Some local decline in numbers has been found in areas, mainly due to habitat destruction and pollution. The chief causes are land clearance, the agricultural overuse of and herbicide and pesticide, and sometimes overgrazing. However, stocks will usually rebound quickly if riparian habitat is allowed to recover, particularly among the prolific American yellow warbler.

The North American populations are legally protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The Barbados golden warbler (&quot;D. p. petechia&quot;) has been listed as &quot;endangered foreign wildlife&quot; by the United States&#x27; Endangered Species Act (ESA) since 1970; other than for specially permitted scientific, educational or conservation purposes, importing it into the USA is illegal. The Californian yellow warbler (&quot;D. p./a. brewsteri&quot;) and Sonoran yellow warbler (&quot;D.p./a. sonorana&quot;) are listed as &quot;species of concern&quot; by the ESA.

<text>The national flag of Tunisia is a rectangular panel of red color with an aspect ratio of 2:3. In the center of the cloth in a white disk is placed a red crescent, surrounding a red five-pointed star on three sides. The Tunisian Bey Hussein II decided to create a flag for Tunisia, close in appearance to the modern one, after the Battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827; in 1831 he was officially approved. In that form, the flag existed during the French protectorate, and on 1 June 1959, it was proclaimed the state flag of the Republic of Tunisia (in accordance with the Tunisian Constitution). On 30 June 1999, the proportions and design of the flag were clarified by a special law. The general appearance of the flag remained virtually unchanged.

The crescent and the star depicted on the flag of Tunisia are traditional symbols of Islam and are also considered symbols of good luck.

== History ==

=== Previous flags ===

Until the mid-18th century, the design and significance of maritime flags flying on ships in Tunis are unknown. However, various sources have been able to distinguish certain similarities among the flags: they were designed with a crescent-oriented shape in the presence of the colors blue, green, red, and white. Thereafter, and until the early 19th century, the flag was composed of horizontal blue, red and green stripes, which are the colors of the ruling Husainid dynasty. This kind of flag with multiple bands and irregular contours floated on top of ships all along the coast of North Africa; similar flags with different colors and arrangements were also used in Africa.

According to Ottfried Neubecker, the Bey of Tunis also had his own flag. This flag was most likely a simple personal banner of the ruler, as it floated above the Bardo Palace, the Citadel of Tunis, on navy ships, and also in the center of the coat of arms in Tunisia. It was used at a number of public ceremonies until the abolition of the monarchy and proclamation of Republic on 25 July 1957.

Believed to have been introduced by Hussein II, although some sources, such as Abdel-Wahab, claim that it was in use three centuries earlier, the flag was rectangular in shape and divided into nine stripes, the middle one green and double the size of all other bands, while the others alternated between yellow and red. Featured in the center of the green stripe was the Zulfiqar, the legendary Islamic sword of Ali, with the blade in white and the hilt multicolored. The red and yellow stripes each contained five equidistant symbols, whose order was alternated between each stripe. These symbols were divided into two categories: one red six-sided star voided with a disk of a different color in the center—either a red star and green disk or a white star and blue disk—, and a large disk voided in its lower right by a small disk of different color, with the combination being either a small red disk within a larger blue disk or a small yellow disk within a larger green disk. The first yellow stripe contains three red stars and two blue disks. The second stripe, red in color, contains three green disksand two white stars. The third stripe (second yellow one) is identical to the first, with the exception that the star in its center is white, while the fourth stripe (second white one) is identical to the second stripe.

=== Origin of the current flag ===
Several Muslim countries along the south coast of the Mediterranean Sea used a plain red naval flag. After the destruction of the Tunisian naval division at the Battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827, the sovereign Husainid Dynasty leader Hussein II decided to create a flag to use for the fleet of Tunisia, to distinguish it from other fleets. There are some discrepancies over the date of the flag&#x27;s adoption, as the government states that it was adopted in 1831, while other sources like Siobhan Ryan&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Pocket Flags of the World&quot; claim that it was adopted in 1835.

=== French protectorate ===
During the era of the French protectorate in Tunisia, The Tunisian flag has not changed. However, according to an article in the &quot;Flag Bulletin&quot; publishing in Fall 2000, for a short period of time during the French protectorate, the flag of France was placed in the canton (upper left) of the Tunisian flag. In the same vein, vexillologist Whitney Smith stated that the addition of the French flag was &quot;modification of the unofficial Tunisian national flag, used for a few years&quot;. He added:

Confusion arose when an issue of the French daily newspaper &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot;, published on 24 July 1904 on the occasion of the bey of Tunis&#x27;s visit to France, reproduced an illustration showing the flag used while he was visiting the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Ivan Sache of &quot;Flags of the World&quot; claimed that this flag design, which had not been seen earlier, may have been inaccurate, suggesting that the journalist might not have been at the affair or he had reproduced a drawing of the wrong flag.

=== Proposed flags ===
The union project between Tunisia and Libya in 1973–1974 almost led to the unification of Tunisia and the Libyan Arab Republic. After a meeting between Habib Bourguiba and Muammar Gaddafi, Tunisian Foreign Minister Mohamed Masmoudi read a joint statement:

But, faced with the opposition that arose both within the regime and abroad, Bourguiba was forced to backtrack and abandon the project on the pretext of the unconstitutionality of the referendum. The flag itself would have taken the colors of the flag of Libya, floating between 1972 and 1977, but the falcon present in the center of this same flag would have been replaced by the star and the Tunisian red crescent, such as the treaty of l union describes it:
== Description ==

The Tunisian flag was defined in Article 4 of the 1 June 1959 constitution under these terms: &quot;The flag of the Republic of Tunisia is red, it has, under the conditions defined by law, in the middle, a white disk containing a five-pointed star surrounded by a red crescent.&quot;

The Organic Law No. 99-56 of 30 June 1999, adopted on 3 July by the Chamber of Deputies, formalized the Tunisian flag for the first time in law, clarifying Article 4 of the constitution. The flag is in the form of a red rectangle with a width equal to two-thirds of its length. In the middle of the flag is a white disk whose diameter is equal to one-third of the length of the rectangle and whose center is located at the intersection of the diagonals of the rectangle. A red five-pointed star is located to the right of the disk, whose center is at a distance equal to one-thirtieth of the length of the flag from the center of the disk.

The location of the star&#x27;s five points is determined by an imaginary disk centered on the star&#x27;s center, its diameter equal to roughly 15% the length of the flag. The points of the star are equidistant from each other, and one of the points is located on the horizontal median of the flag to the left of the center of the imaginary disk. The star is surrounded on its left by a red crescent made by the intersection of two arcs, an outer arc whose diameter is equal to one-fourth of the length of the flag, and an internal arc with a diameter equal to one-fifth of the flag&#x27;s length. In addition, at the top of the flag used by the President of the Republic, the words &quot;for the nation&quot; () are written in gold. The three outer edges of the flag are lined with golden yellow fringe and a red ribbon, with golden fringe on the right vertical side and a white disk with a star and crescent near the fringe, is attached to the flag pole above the flag.

Article 4 of the 1959 constitution specifies the presence of a technical dossier containing a model of the flag, a guide to drawing it, which includes the proper measurements, and technical specifications of its colors.
===Colours scheme===
== Symbolism ==

For the Tunisian embassy in France, the color red represents the blood of Tunisian martyrs killed during the Crusades before the advent of the Ottomans in 1574. Another interpretation is that the &quot;red Beylical flag spread light throughout the Muslim world&quot;. The white symbolizes peace, the disk symbolizes the radiance of the nation as the sun, while the crescent and five-pointed star represent unity of all Muslims and the Five Pillars of Islam, respectively.

According to Ludvík Mucha, author of &quot;Webster&#x27;s Concise Encyclopedia of Flags &amp; Coats of Arms&quot;, the white disk located in the center of the flag represents the sun. The red crescent and the five-pointed star, two ancient symbols of Islam, have appeared on many flags of Islamic countries. The crescent is, from the viewpoint of an Arabic observer, supposed to bring good luck. The color red represents the blood of martyrs.

Whitney Smith states that the crescent was first emblazoned on standards and buildings in the Punic state of Carthage, located in present-day Tunisia. Nevertheless, they were widely adopted by Muslim countries, and have become known as symbols of Islam, when in fact, they may be cultural symbols. Likewise, the sun is often represented with the crescent on ancient Punic artifacts and is associated with the ancient Punic religion, especially with the Sign of Tanit.

== Protocol ==

The Tunisian flag is visible on all public and military buildings. The flag also betokens Tunisian ambassadors at regional and international meetings as well as at buildings housing Tunisian representatives around the world. It is deployed during commemorations and national honors in a strictly ceremonial manner. On the listed Flag Days below, the Tunisian flag is flown in public buildings, compulsory by law:
Article 129 of the Penal Code of Tunisia punishes the insult either &quot;publicly, by words, writings, gestures or any other manner&quot; of the Tunisian flag and also foreign flags with one year imprisonment.

== Variants ==
The colors of the flag are included in other Tunisian symbols, such as the coat of arms, which contains a crescent and star enclosed in a disk with red border. In addition, equipment belonging to the Tunisian army are visually recognized by the presence of a cockade.

Most political parties of Tunisia reflect the colors of the flag or the flag itself.
Many postal stamps reflect the motifs of the flag, which radiate &quot;with brightness&quot; on them.

== Tunisian flag disambiguation from Tunisian red crescent ==
The International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement offers three main symbols (a cross, a crescent or a crystal shape) to national committees. Though neither emblem has any religious association, most majority Muslim population countries chose a red crescent facing to the right, to avoid perceived religious connotations of the red cross. However, in Tunisia, such a symbol could be difficult to distinguish from the roundel on Tunisian military equipment. Therefore, to clearly distinguish on a battlefield the neutrality of ambulances and other equipment and personnel belonging to the red crescent from the military ones, the Tunisian Red Crescent Society is the only one in the world to have adopted as logo a crescent facing to the left.

In &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #122 (July 1973), Harry&#x27;s father, Norman, is killed off, and a subplot leading to Harry inheriting his father&#x27;s identity as the Green Goblin is introduced. This subplot culminates in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #136 (September 1974). Writer Gerry Conway said that the idea of Harry Osborn becoming the Green Goblin stemmed in part from a desire to deal with the consequences of the psychedelic drugs Harry began using in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #96 (May 1971). Conway said that he had had experience with such drugs himself, and that &quot;with psychedelic drugs, hallucinogens, if they&#x27;ve been misused, there is a potential for additional hallucinogenic experiences that are completely beyond your control or volition. I could imagine Harry getting hit by something like that, in the fragile emotional state following the death of his father, and losing touch with reality, as a result. Besides, I never had any intention of getting rid of the Green Goblin as a concept forever, so it all came together&quot;.

Harry dies in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #200 (May 1993). Artist Sal Buscema said that drawing the final two pages of this issue was a deeply emotional experience for him due to how long he had drawn the character, and felt it was appropriate that writer J. M. DeMatteis chose not to add any dialogue to those pages.

Several years later, the Spider-Man writers made plans to reveal that the mysterious villain Gaunt was Harry Osborn, who was still alive and had orchestrated the entire &quot;Clone Saga&quot;, but an editorial edict prevented this from coming to fruition. However, Harry was eventually revived in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #545 (December 2007). He received an entry in the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update &#x27;89&quot; #5.

==Fictional character biography==
Harry is the only son of Norman Osborn and Emily Lyman. The circumstances of Harry&#x27;s birth weakens Emily, and she dies after a long illness. Heartbroken, Norman becomes a cold and unloving father; Norman either contemptuously dismisses Harry or lashes out at him in fury. As a result, Harry spends much of his life trying desperately to earn his father&#x27;s approval. Unbeknownst to him, however, Norman had traded his son&#x27;s soul to the demon Mephisto in exchange for wealth and power, and Harry would be cursed for the rest of his life while Norman forgot the deal.

Upon graduating from high school, Harry enrolls in Empire State University. Among the wealthiest students in the school, Harry soon becomes one of the most popular as well, despite his aloof manner. He has a clique of rich, popular students around him; one of these is the lovely Gwen Stacy. Gwen is intrigued by a new student: bookish, studious and painfully-shy Peter Parker. Harry takes a dislike to Parker; he resents the attention Gwen pays to Peter, and he assumes that Peter&#x27;s standoffishness is snobbery. After confronting Parker, Harry realizes that Peter is merely shy and is also worried about his ailing aunt May Parker. Despite this rocky start, Harry and Peter became best friends, eventually sharing an apartment.

Harry does not realize that his best friend is the superhero Spider-Man, nor that his father became the supervillain Green Goblin in an accident while attempting to create a super-serum. Moreover, before he became friends with Harry, Spider-Man was unmasked and captured by Green Goblin. During the subsequent battle, an electric shock removed all memory of being Green Goblin from Norman&#x27;s mind. Spider-Man then hid all evidence of Norman&#x27;s double identity, to keep Harry from being hurt by the revelation.

However, Norman&#x27;s Green Goblin persona resurfaces from time to time. These are difficult times for Harry, as his father&#x27;s periodic episodes are unexplainable. He had experimented with drugs in his teens; but he escalates his usage, as well as trying ever-harder substances. This affects his mental stability and his relationships with his friends. Spider-Man uses this to his advantage during one battle with Green Goblin; he is able to stop the fight by showing Norman his son&#x27;s emaciated condition, brought on by an accidental drug overdose. The sight shocks Norman so much that it brings him back to sanity.

===Green Goblin===

Harry is dumped by Mary Jane Watson due to being fed up with his self-destructive lifestyle. Disconsolate, Harry turns to drugs and overdoses on amphetamines. He recovers at home instead of at a hospital, as Norman wanted to keep the matter quiet, and a doctor diagnoses him with schizophrenia. This tragedy, compounded by imminent bankruptcy, drives Norman over the edge. The elder Osborn kidnaps Gwen as bait for Spider-Man, and then throws her off the George Washington Bridge (or Brooklyn Bridge). In a vicious battle with Spider-Man, the Green Goblin accidentally impales himself on his own goblin glider. Harry Osborn secretly witnesses this. Wanting to protect his father&#x27;s identity, he strips Norman Osborn&#x27;s body of the Green Goblin costume. Blaming Spider-Man for his father&#x27;s &quot;murder&quot;, Harry, angry and mentally unbalanced, swears vengeance. Having inherited his father&#x27;s company, Harry manages to get the business back in shape. One day, to his shock, he finds a Spider-Man costume in Peter Parker&#x27;s apartment and realizes that his best friend is the man he blames for his father&#x27;s death. Using his father&#x27;s old equipment, Harry confronts Peter as the second Green Goblin.

Not wanting to hurt Harry, Peter avoids fighting his old friend. After Spider-Man is able to thwart Harry&#x27;s initial attempt on his life, Harry is knocked unconscious and taken into police custody. There, he raves that he is the true Green Goblin and Peter Parker is Spider-Man, but is dismissed as a lunatic. He is put in the care of criminal psychologist Dr. Bart Hamilton to extract the Green Goblin secrets from Harry through hypnosis, and buries the knowledge deep within Harry&#x27;s mind. Hamilton then raids one of Harry&#x27;s hideouts and becomes the third Green Goblin. Meanwhile, Harry is released and considered cured. He sustains a concussion that makes him forget his knowledge of Spider-Man&#x27;s identity and he and Peter rekindle their friendship.

For a while, Harry&#x27;s life seems back on track; his company begins turning profits once more, and he develops a romance with Liz Allan after they meet at the wedding of Betty Brant and Ned Leeds. Not long after the two are married, and eventually they have their son Normie Osborn named in memory of the boy&#x27;s grandfather. Harry also gives his blessing to the marriage of Peter and Mary Jane Watson. However, Harry starts regaining his memories when he is blackmailed by the original Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley) with a package which contains evidence that his father was the original Green Goblin. When Hobgoblin learns he had raided all of Norman&#x27;s hideouts, he leaves Harry alone, knowing he had nothing more to offer him. Later, Harry is forced to act as Green Goblin a few times, once to defeat the second Hobgoblin (Jason Macendale). This Hobgoblin is seeking the Goblin Formula that gave the Green Goblin superhuman strength; Harry is able to defeat him by doubling back during an aerial chase and emptying his entire supply of pumpkin bombs onto Hobgoblin. Harry even wonders if he could use the Green Goblin persona for a career as a superhero, but Peter convinces him that Green Goblin had too much baggage for such a role. Harry buries the Green Goblin menace within his mind once more and focuses on his business and family.

===Death===
This tranquility is shattered when the aftereffects of the &quot;Inferno&quot; crisis sunder the barrier between Harry&#x27;s conscious and subconscious minds. Once again, he remembers being Green Goblin—and his hatred of Spider-Man. Harry has now convinced himself that Peter Parker resents the Osborns&#x27; &quot;stable family life&quot; due to never having been wanted by his own parents or guardians, when in fact it was the complete opposite. He uses Peter&#x27;s trust in him to capture him, and subjects him to hallucinogenic gases to psychologically torment him. He finds himself unsatisfied with this revenge, however, and decides to kill Spider-Man. However, given the opportunity he proves unwilling to kill his best friend.

Harry investigates his father&#x27;s old hideouts and notes, and finally uncovers and ingests the formula for the original Green Goblin&#x27;s superhuman strength. He then kidnaps his wife, son, and brother-in-law Mark Raxton, terrorizing them in an old family mansion. Raxton manages to signal their location to Spider-Man who defeats the Green Goblin and turns him in to the police. Spider-Man pushes for Harry to get psychiatric treatment from Dr. Ashley Kafka, but he is ultimately transferred to the Vault. However, the state is unable to put together a sufficient case against Harry, and after just a few weeks in prison, he is released.

Harry discovers that his father developed an advanced version of the Goblin Formula, but was unable to test it before his final battle with Spider-Man. After testing it, he ingests the new formula. When he spies Spider-Man investigating his townhouse, Harry loses his temper and attacks him as the Green Goblin. He injects Peter with a drug that leaves him immobile and, in a fit of depression, activates timed explosives that he had planted throughout the townhouse, planning to kill both himself and Peter. However, when he realizes that Mary Jane and his son Normie are also in the townhouse, he is shocked back to his normal self. Harry rescues Mary Jane, Normie, and Peter before he collapses. He belatedly realizes that he did not test the new formula diligently enough, and that it is, in fact, lethal before he dies holding Peter&#x27;s hand.

===Post-mortem===
Sometime before his death, Harry created a computer system with copies of his and Norman Osborn&#x27;s minds programmed into it; after Harry&#x27;s death, the computer system activates and abducts Normie Osborn with the intent of subjecting him to the Green Goblin Serum (the same one that had caused Harry&#x27;s death) to make into the newest Green Goblin. This computer facsimile of Harry and its robotic drones (which resemble female versions of Green Goblin) were all destroyed by Spider-Man and the Molten Man who manage to save Normie from it. However, Harry had one last trick up his sleeve. Sometime before his final confrontation with Spider-Man, Harry had employed the Chameleon to construct Life Model Decoys of Peter&#x27;s parents to play with his emotions. The plot ends with both constructs revealed as fakes when both &quot;die&quot;, shattering Peter&#x27;s mind. After nearly killing the Chameleon, Peter found a tape Harry had left before he died revealing his role in the plot and mocking Peter, demonstrating that Harry was as manipulative and cruel as his father when gripped by insanity. Peter goes temporarily insane from the shock, even briefly rejecting his identity until the return of his clone Ben Reilly snaps him back to reality.

Some time later Spider-Man encountered another digital version of Harry&#x27;s mind, this one a hologram created by a group of rebel Scriers. This group had reconstructed Harry from all available information about him in the hope of using him to manipulate Normie, who they wished to use as a weapon against his grandfather. This Harry, possessing all the memories of the original, refuses to entertain the idea of his son becoming a killer, and assists Spider-Man in defeating the leader of the group. He then explains to Normie that Spider-Man is not an enemy and thanks Peter for all his help over the years. As the hologram disappears the badly injured Scrier grabs Normie with the intent of killing him, but someone — implied to be Harry — grabs the Scrier from out of the darkness and breaks his neck.

===&#x27;Return from the grave&#x27;===
After Mephisto&#x27;s manipulations of the timeline, details of Harry&#x27;s death are seemingly retconned as being faked by Mysterio and his father who spirits his son away to Europe where he is held prisoner in several &quot;rehab&quot; clinics and believes that his son had relapsed into drug addiction, and this, in turn, led to his brief return to wearing the Green Goblin costume. Prior to Mephisto&#x27;s alterations, Harry&#x27;s body was exhumed and tested, indicating he was dead. However, this is explained to have been a &quot;genetic duplicate&quot; provided by Mysterio to fool anyone who investigated later, indicating he was alive all along and Peter simply did not know.

At some point, Harry is released from rehab and reunites with his friends. However, because Peter recruited Dr. Strange, Mister Fantastic, and Iron Man to help him wipe out all evidence and memory of Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity (save from Mary Jane), Harry recalls his actions as the second Green Goblin but no longer remembers that Peter Parker is the web-slinger. His marriage to Liz Allan disintegrates and the two divorce. Harry engages in a string of relationships, several of which result in Harry marrying and divorcing in rapid fashion. He is in a relationship with Lily Hollister. Harry tries to help Lily&#x27;s father in the latter&#x27;s bid for Mayor of New York by funding her father&#x27;s campaign with his dwindling finances.

Harry is also one of the leading suspects for the secret identity of a new Goblin. In the &quot;New Ways to Die&quot; story arc, Menace battles Norman Osborn and is infuriated when Norman states that all he cares about is killing Spider-Man. Norman dons the Green Goblin costume and mentions that Harry has been in the Green Goblin&#x27;s lair. Norman calls Harry, who realizes from Norman&#x27;s distorted voice that Norman is wearing the Green Goblin suit. This horrifies and disgusts Harry, who vows to stop his father. Harry angrily confronts his father, who wants Harry to follow his legacy and become a greater man. The confused Harry is saved by Spider-Man. Spider-Man, who wants to beat Norman senseless, stops when he sees an area for human testing. Harry is claimed to be the one responsible for the atrocious acts, although he attempts to plead innocence. Harry later states that he wants to talk to Peter, who moments earlier was kissed by Lily, and is seen leaving with a mysterious canister labelled &quot;Prometheus X-90&quot;.

Prometheus X-90, it is revealed later, was developed as a successful cure for Mark Raxton&#x27;s condition as Molten Man. The only human test subject was Charlie Weiderman, the short-lived second Molten Man, and the only person on whom the serum could be tested. After the cure is administered, Liz finally forgives Harry and gives him back the wedding ring, which she originally claimed she lost.

Renting out all of Liberty Island, Harry takes Lily there and, at the top of the Statue of Liberty, he gets down on one knee and proposes to her. Lily rejects his proposal because she is not sure where their relationship will lead, which surprises Harry. He later goes to her place to check up on her, and as he enters the room he is surprised to discover Lily wearing the Menace costume.

She found a hidden door in his closet and one of his old journals. She begins giving him a hard time about whining so much about his father. Harry thinks her behavior is because she is sick. She continues to tell him she uncovered one of Norman&#x27;s secret rooms described in the journal. This explains why she kissed Peter after the Thunderbolts attacked; he almost found the secret trigger to open the room. When she first entered the room, she found the Green Goblin&#x27;s equipment and some experiments. Knocking over some chemicals, she absorbed them and is now able to transform at will. She explains that she discovered Menace&#x27;s attacks against her father gives him more public support. She also tells him that she accepts his marriage proposal. After their talk, Harry enters one of his father&#x27;s weapons caches, takes a glider (filled with bombs and winged bombs), a pair of Goblin gloves, a sword, and a dart gun containing an unknown chemical. In the midst of a battle between Menace and Spider-Man, Harry confronts and shoots her with that chemical, which is a type of antidote that reverts her back to her human form. He saves Spider-Man from the crowd and leaves. Lily is incarcerated but later escapes, leaving Harry her ring and a note.

===&quot;Dark Reign&quot;===
Harry is approached by Norman with the offer of a job within the Dark Avengers. Harry initially declines, but accepts his father&#x27;s offer after learning that Lily Hollister is pregnant. Norman welcomes Harry into Avengers Tower, wanting to make his son into the American Son. Harry is shown to have an ulterior motive, however, based on his compulsion to protect Lily and his child. Disabling the camera in his room, Harry sneaks off. He finds a cure for Lily&#x27;s condition that will be safe for both Lily and the baby, but Lily pushes him away. Lily reveals that it is a ruse to coerce Harry into taking on the American Son armor, whom Norman had plotted would die in a tragedy to increase sympathy for Norman and the Dark Avengers. Lily also reveals that the baby is not Harry&#x27;s but, in fact, Norman&#x27;s. In retaliation for this, Harry dons his American Son armor, and fights Norman in his Iron Patriot armor. During the battle, Norman declares that Harry is no longer his son, and that Norman has bred a better child to replace the &#x27;failure&#x27; of Harry. After further taunts from Norman, Harry lashes out and defeats his father, declaring &quot;I was never your son!&quot;. When Harry has the option of killing Norman, Spider-Man tells him to decapitate Norman, since his father&#x27;s healing factor may repair a blow to the head. Spider-Man also cautions Harry that killing Norman will cause Harry to &quot;become the son Norman always wanted&quot;. Seeing what he may become with his actions, Harry instead backs down, and turns away from his father forever.

Harry is next seen in a psychiatrist&#x27;s office, claiming to be getting over the effects of a medical treatment he received. The doctor offers to prescribe him oxycodone but it is not revealed if Harry takes the prescription.

Afterwards, Harry is cut off financially and is forced out of his penthouse apartment. He moves into Peter&#x27;s old room at May Parker&#x27;s. He also begins secretly dating Amy Reilly (Peter&#x27;s cousin). After May returns and is corrupted by Mister Negative, she kicks Harry out of the house, forcing him to move in with Mary Jane Watson.

===Heroic Age===
After Norman&#x27;s fall, the American Son armor is stolen and the police begin questioning Harry, as only someone of the Osborn bloodline can use the American Son armor. Harry is then shot in the chest by Gabriel Stacy, claiming that Norman gave Harry a better life. However, Harry is saved by American Son and taken to a hospital. After Harry recovers from his wounds, he is escorted home by police. Fearing the damage that could be done with the American Son armor and perplexed by his encounter with Gabriel, Harry decides to figure things out on his own. After enlisting the help of a talented reporter named Norah from Frontline, Harry decides to visit Norman, as only he would know about Gabriel. Harry and Norah eventually visit the Raft where they find Norman in his cell, consumed by madness. Harry demands to know about Gabriel, but Norman is unresponsive. Frustrated, Harry and Norah begin to leave, but before they exit Norman briefly returns to his senses and tells Harry that Gabriel is indeed Norman&#x27;s son.

Trying to make sense of everything, Harry visits May Parker&#x27;s work where he plans to volunteer. On his way, he realizes that he is being followed by the FBI. It is then revealed through FBI security footage that Gabriel is the one who stole the American Son armor and has been using the armor all along. Meanwhile, Gabriel confronts the American Son armor and is revealed to have developed a split personality similar to Norman&#x27;s after his exposure to the Goblin Formula. This split personality explains to Gabriel that it represents all that is good in his soul and will use the American Son armor to undo each of Gabriel&#x27;s crimes. After an intense psychological battle, Gabriel appears to gain the upper hand and proceeds with his plan.

Still attempting to understand Gabriel&#x27;s plans, Harry determines that, in order for Gabriel to truly hurt him, he will attempt to abduct an innocent person and lay a trap. Harry then rushes to find Norah. Meanwhile, the police arrive at Gabriel&#x27;s hideout, but are unable to rescue Norah because of the American Son&#x27;s interference. Harry manages to sneak in through one of his father&#x27;s secret tunnels and confronts his half-brother. As the police prepare to make another attempt to save Norah, Harry frees her and gets the young reporter to safety. With Norah out of harm&#x27;s way Gabriel and Harry engage in an epic battle. During the fight, Harry attempts to convince Gabriel that Norman is evil and that attempting to follow in his footsteps is madness. Gabriel refuses to listen and continues his attempts to kill Harry. Saddened by his brother&#x27;s choice, Harry hacks the American Son armor and knocks Gabriel unconscious. The battle causes the warehouse to go up in flames, trapping Gabriel and Harry inside, but Spider-Man arrives and saves them. Afterward, Norah visits Harry in his coffee shop, and notices a bottle of oxycodone in Harry&#x27;s things. Troubled by what she finds, Norah concludes that Harry has a drug problem and resolves to help him through it.

After many near-encounters, Carlie Cooper and Peter Parker meet at the coffee shop. Harry and MJ are there and the four are talking when Lily bursts through the wall, followed by an attacking team of supervillains. MJ asks Harry to help Lily Hollister who has gone into labor, but they are held captive by Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man manages to save them and rescue Lily&#x27;s newborn baby from the supervillains. Harry and MJ take Lily to get medical care, but Carlie was too angry with Lily to accompany them. When Spider-Man secures the baby from Doctor Octopus he runs an analysis on a sample of the baby&#x27;s DNA and finds it matches Harry&#x27;s, and thus he is the child&#x27;s true father. Spider-Man encourages Harry to raise his son on his own and start a new life. Soon thereafter, Harry prepares to leave New York with the baby named Stanley. At his going-away party, Harry encounters former NYPD officer Vin Gonzales reveals he has a Green Goblin tattoo. After Gonzales relays a message from Norman, Harry shocks the man with a taser and beats him.

Months later, Harry is shown in Seattle, Washington living with his son. He is shown to have completely changed his appearance, having shaved his head and grown a beard.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; branding, Harry Osborn and his young son Stanley finally came out of hiding, following his father&#x27;s, the Goblin King, defeat. Going back to his usual look, Harry started using his mother&#x27;s maiden name of Lyman and has started working at Parker Industries where he is in charge of Parker Industries&#x27; New York office when revealed to the Human Torch by Spider-Man. His sons Normie and Stanley like Regent, until the time when all superhumans are disappearing without a traces caused by a superhuman known as the Regent, while Harry is meeting with Mary Jane and Betty Brant, Harry stumbles upon seeing a same logo as the Regent&#x27;s on Augustus Roman&#x27;s Empire Unlimited company, and soon realizes, along with Mary Jane, that when he saw a logo beneath Augustus&#x27; ripped shirt during the time of Zodiac&#x27;s attacks on the opening of Horizon University that Augustus is, in fact, Regent, thus sending Betty to meet Augustus to prove if he is Regent or not. As Harry realizes that, Augustus kidnaps Betty. Harry must do it himself to save Betty and the other captured superhumans, knowing that he may be captured soon enough, but manage to contact Spider-Man with Parker Industries&#x27; webware created by Clayton/Clash before Regent captures him immediately. With a portion of Clayton&#x27;s Clash soundwave tech on Parker Industries&#x27; webware, Harry manages to break free and contact Spider-Man again before the Empire Unlimited&#x27;s guards capture him, until Spider-Man arrives and soon releases the other superhumans and Betty, surrounding Regent for good.

Later in the storyline &quot;Go Down Swinging&quot;, Harry returns, using the Osborn name after his father again terrorizes the city as the Red Goblin using the Carnage symbiote before being imprisoned once more, even after Emily Osborn turns up alive. He is determined to redeem his family&#x27;s name from his father&#x27;s villainous legacy and to be a responsible parent to his sons.

===Kindred===

It is revealed over the course of Nick Spencer&#x27;s run as writer on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; that, upon dying, Harry&#x27;s soul was transported to Hell, where he encountered the demon Mephisto, who labels him as the Goblin Prince. The demon asks Harry why he never told Peter on his deathbed any of the schemes he had set in motion to torture him after his passing, with Harry confessing that there was no time, and that he was ashamed. Harry&#x27;s soul is kept in hell tortured by demons while a clone version maintains a life on Earth revealed post-&quot;One More Day&quot;.

Many years later, a demon, going by the name of Kindred, rose through the ranks and ultimately hand picked Mysterio to assist him in carrying out a plan of retaliation against Peter Parker, whom Kindred held accountable for an unpardonable sin. When Kindred meets with Norman Osborn in Ravencroft, Norman&#x27;s Cletus Kasady persona states to Kindred that he has a message for him from Norman, who states that he is &quot;so proud of him&quot;.

In a final battle with the Kindreds, Norman reveals the A.I. Harry had been influenced by Mephisto the entire time and apologizes to Harry for selling his soul. Harry then tells Peter he &quot;made up&quot; the twins and fights with his friend against them. During the battle Harry tells Norman to get to safety; Norman is shocked at this to which Harry replies &quot;Guess the apple fell kinda far from the tree.&quot; When Harry steps between Norman and a blow from Gabriel&#x27;s Kindred body, he is fatally wounded. Collapsing into Peter&#x27;s arms, Harry tells Peter this was always how it was &quot;meant to be&quot; and dies. Doctor Strange decides to gamble with Mephisto for the fate of Harry Osborn&#x27;s soul and succeeds. His victory exorcises Mephisto from the twins, allowing them to degenerate and pass on for a final time, and Harry&#x27;s soul is freed from Mephisto&#x27;s grasp. Peter and MJ grieve the loss of their friend.

==Powers and abilities==
For most of his life, Harry Osborn had no superhuman abilities.

===As Green Goblin===
After exposing himself to his father&#x27;s formula, he takes the reins of the second Green Goblin, causing him to become much stronger, cunning and agile. The glider he carries has swords, along with usual Goblin technology.

===As American Son===
Harry&#x27;s clone also had temporary access to the American Son armor.

===Harry A.I/Kindred===

When the Harry Osborn A.I. created the Kindred twins, the assistance of Mephisto bestowed the twins with the demonically-enhanced capabilities of immortality, super-strength, and control over the centipedes like the ones that can protrude out of them. In addition, they can perform magic and revive the dead.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Clone Saga&quot;===
In the simplified re-telling of the Clone Saga, Harry is revealed as the mastermind behind Peter and Ben Reilly&#x27;s troubles throughout the story. Having secretly survived his final battle with Spider-Man, and still unhinged due to the side-effects of the Goblin formula, Harry carries out a vengeful campaign against the Spider-Men with the aid of Kaine. His plans also include the cloning of his deceased father, who apparently was killed by his Goblin Glider in this reality. Harry soon heads out to attack Ben Reilly in the guise of the Green Goblin. His plans are thwarted when Kaine switches sides. The Norman clone, who is not insane due to not being exposed to the Goblin Formula, tries to convince Harry to stop before sacrificing himself by jumping in front of the moving Goblin Glider (akin to Ben Reilly&#x27;s death in the main universe). The series concludes with an irate Harry swearing vengeance.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot;===
&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot; features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Peter has Norman arrested to prevent the Green Goblin from hurting anyone, leaving Harry in charge of Oscorp. In 1977, Harry is engaged to Mary Jane, but shows signs of a drug addiction brought upon by the stress of his position and his father&#x27;s imprisonment. Norman convinces Harry to attack Miles Warren as the Black Goblin to retrieve his clone, but Harry discovers that Miles also cloned Peter and Gwen Stacy in the process. Harry realizes Norman cloned Peter because Norman still considered Peter the more worthy heir and attacks him. After Peter convinces Harry of his father&#x27;s manipulations, Harry blows up the facility, killing all the clones except Peter&#x27;s. However, Miles reveals that the &quot;Gwen&quot; Peter was with was actually her clone while the real Gwen died in the explosion, leaving Harry wracked with guilt. By one year later, he has broken up with Mary Jane and left her with a significant amount of money before disappearing. In 1995, Otto Octavius breaks into Oscorp and threatens Harry into letting him use equipment to study Peter and his clone, Ben, to find a way to clone himself. Chaos erupts after he discovers that Peter is supposedly the clone while Ben is the original. When Otto attempts to kill them both, Harry sacrifices himself to save Peter. As he dies in Peter&#x27;s arms, he apologizes for being weak with Otto and his father, though Peter reassures him that he was not. It is later revealed that Otto was allowed to enter Oscorp by an elderly Norman, who has a heart attack and dies after learning of Harry&#x27;s death.

===&quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;===

In this version, Harry Osborn is a social outcast at high school who is constantly bullied due to a rumor that he tried to burn his old prep school down; Flash Thompson notably bullies him and nicknames him the &quot;Green Goblin&quot;. Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker befriend him out of pity, and Harry asks Gwen out to the prom, angering Peter. He witnesses Peter transform into the Lizard, fight Spider-Woman and die. At Peter&#x27;s funeral, he feels guilty that he did not do anything to prevent Peter&#x27;s death, and disappears from school for two years. He returns one night tells Gwen that he joined the army and S.H.I.E.L.D. after Peter&#x27;s death and plans to avenge him by taking down Spider-Woman. During his fight with Spider-Woman, he takes the Lizard serum to overpower the heroine, but runs away after discovering Spider-Woman is Gwen. He then goes on the run from S.H.I.E.L.D. and is pursued by ninjas belonging to the Hand, Wolverine, and Shadowcat before fully transforming into the Lizard. Figuring out that there is a connection with their powers and a mysterious substance given to her by Matt Murdock, Gwen manages to get the Lizard serum out of Harry&#x27;s blood and combines it with the substance, which forms the Venom symbiote.

===&quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;===
During the &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; storyline, there are different versions of Harry Osborn seen:

* The Earth-44145 version of Harry Osborn arrives at Oscorp and makes his way through the building. The narration is in the form of a letter to Harry from Peter Parker on what is happening at Oscorp. As a six-armed Norman Osborn is informed of Harry moving through Oscorp and having been secretly armed, he is told that Harry is on the 15th floor near Mr. Warren&#x27;s lab. Becoming Spider-Man and arriving where a warped Cosmic Cube is located, Norman confronts Harry who dons the Kobold armor. It was revealed during the fight that Norman killed Peter Parker as a badly-injured Harry fires a laser beam at the warped Cosmic Cube.
* During the return of the Inheritors, Spider-Gwen&#x27;s device to travel through the multiverse got destroyed by Verna and then Gwen got stranded in an alternate universe. In this universe Peter Parker and this universe&#x27;s Gwen Stacy got a job at Oscorp and Peter wanted to create a cure for cancer, after his Uncle Ben died from it. Peter was experimenting with spider venom to create the cure but one of the spiders bit Harry Osborn making Harry this universe&#x27;s Spider-Man. Harry alongside Gwen Stacy as this universe&#x27;s Green Goblin started to fight crime together, until during a fight with the Sandman, both Harry and Gwen&#x27;s father got killed.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Harry Osborn from Earth-1610 is the rich son of Norman Osborn and Martha Osborn as well as the best friend and tutoring subject of Peter Parker at Midtown High, who is one of Peter&#x27;s few friends in high school and also briefly dates Mary Jane &quot;MJ&quot; Watson. After Norman eventually subjects himself to the OZ Formula, the Green Goblin kills Martha and attempts to kill Harry, because of which he initially goes missing but eventually shows up outside Midtown High following Spider-Man&#x27;s battle with Green Goblin there which nearly destroyed the school and tells MJ, Flash Thompson and Kenny Kong that the monster is his dad. Harry is placed into a relative&#x27;s custody, but he eventually returned to his father and is brainwashed by Dr. Miles Warren to forget the previous events. During another battle with Spider-Man, the Sinister Six and the Ultimates in front of the White House, Harry stops his father and he is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. He is later used as Nick Fury&#x27;s bargaining piece to negotiate with Norman. Harry begins to blame everyone around him for the situation, and his second personality Shaw (introduced by his father after many years of hypnotic therapy) begins to take control. Harry eventually turns into the Hobgoblin creature, gaining super strength, pyrokinesis and orange Goblin-like super skin. Harry tries to stop himself during a battle with Spider-Man, but Shaw takes over and is wounded by S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers. He is once again used by S.H.I.E.L.D. to attract his father, but the two end up doing battle, which leaves Harry dead. Peter later makes a speech that honors his friend. It was eventually revealed that the OZ formula gives Norman and Spider-Man immortality, making it possible that Harry is still alive somewhere.

===Ultimate Universe===
When Maker traveled to Earth-6160, he remade it into his own image. In this reality, Harry is the heir of Oscorp, one of the largest companies of the North American Union, a regional power bloc which includes the former United States territories. After his parents are killed in a false flag attack on Stark Tower orchestrated by the Maker&#x27;s Council, he is appointed as the new CEO.

Flashbacks show that on the day of the attack, he was talking to Norman on the phone just before his death, barely avoiding his own. Weeks after that, Harry and Gwen Stacy, his wife, are told that the inheritance of the Osborn estate is now owned by them, while it might take awhile before he can consolidate control over the company. Harry then is called for a meeting with Wilson Fisk, the newly appointed Shadow Governor of New York, who asks him to help take care of Stark/Stane&#x27;s due the power vacuum caused by the fall of the Starks. Two weeks later, Harry, Gwen Stacy, and their employee Otto Octavius raid a hidden repository of Howard Stark, containing his armors, archives and suit designs. He creates the Green Goblin armor alongside Otto using Stark technology. Three months later, Green Goblin confronted Shocker. Green Goblin learned from Shocker that he found his suit in the apartment of a man who died of a heart attack in his chair watching a message from Iron Lad, learning about his rebellion against the Council and his attempts at inciting superhumans to act.

As Green Goblin, Harry has been covertly attacking the Kingpin and fighting against his control over New York. At one point, he witnessed Shocker get away from Spider-Man. After Spider-Man saves Green Goblin from Bullseye, the Goblin deactivates their suits armor, causing both of them to know each other&#x27;s true identities as they meet for the first time. On April, Peter Parker and Mary Jane meet Harry and Gwen Stacy at a restaurant. When they are alone, Harry finds out that Peter hasn&#x27;t told Mary Jane that he&#x27;s Spider-Man as that would endanger her if anybody found out. He does advice him that &quot;with great power comes great responsibility&quot; and to use his gift.

Green Goblin and Spider-Man later stake out the Fisk Building, Where they confront Wilson Fisk. Fisk then goes on the attack where it&#x27;s shown his body was augmented enough to make the fight difficult and causing Green Goblin and Spider-Man to do a tactical retreat.

On July, Harry Osborn introduces Peter Parker to Otto Octavius who informs them about their suits&#x27;s properties. Octavius considers them as being built with different types of engineering, listing the Green Goblin armor as an advanced piece of hardware while the internal capabilities of Peter&#x27;s suit are harder to pinpoint. Its revealed that besides both suits being part of the same network, both have an A.I. system that can help them with pratically anything. They train while overseen by Octavius, as Harry starts using his suit&#x27;s A.I, basing it off his father&#x27;s personality. The training is interrupted by Octavius as he detects a third carrier wave on the network. It turns out to be Iron Lad who arrives by the use of the Immortus Engine, stating that he did mention that he&#x27;d be back in six months as he asks if they are heroes yet.

Green Goblin and Spider-Man learn from Iron Lad that the picotech was revolutionary and that Maker had a secret file where anyone that was deemed &quot;mission&quot; critical had to go. Upon deactivating part of Green Goblin&#x27;s armor, Iron Lad recognizes Harry Osborn as the one who stole his birthright as Harry states that he earned it from Wilson Fisk. With Maker planning to return in a year when The City opens, Green Goblin and Spider-Man are advised to prepare themselves for when that day comes. Before departing, Iron Lad states that Harry wasn&#x27;t on Maker&#x27;s list and advises him to keep the suit and the company he has. Harry tells Otto that they have to find a way to update the security in their suits.

<doc id="417324" wikidata="Q3636509" url="?curid=417324" title="Battle of Lone Pine">
<text>The Battle of Lone Pine (also known as the Battle of Kanlı Sırt) was fought between Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) and Ottoman Empire forces during the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War, between 6 and 10 August 1915. The battle was part of a diversionary attack to draw Ottoman attention away from the main assaults being conducted by British, Indian and New Zealand troops around Sari Bair, Chunuk Bair and Hill 971, which became known as the August Offensive.

At Lone Pine, the assaulting force, initially consisting of the Australian 1st Brigade, managed to capture the main trench line from the two Ottoman battalions that were defending the position in the first few hours of the fighting on 6 August. Over the next three days, the fighting continued as the Ottomans brought up reinforcements and launched numerous counterattacks in an attempt to recapture the ground they had lost. As the counterattacks intensified the ANZACs brought up two fresh battalions to reinforce their newly gained line. Finally, on 9 August the Ottomans called off any further attempts and by 10 August offensive action ceased, leaving the Allies in control of the position. Nevertheless, despite the Australian victory, the wider August Offensive of which the attack had been a part failed and a situation of stalemate developed around Lone Pine which lasted until the end of the campaign in December 1915 when Allied troops were evacuated from the peninsula.
== Prelude ==

=== Terrain ===
The Lone Pine battlefield was named for a solitary Turkish pine that stood there at the start of the fighting; The tree was also known by the Anzac soldiers as the &quot;Lonesome Pine&quot;. The battlefield was situated near the centre of the eastern line of the Australian and New Zealand trenches around Anzac Cove on a rise known as &quot;400 Plateau&quot; that joined &quot;Bolton&#x27;s Ridge&quot; to the south with the ridge along the east side of &quot;Monash Valley&quot; to the north. Being towards the southern end of the area around Anzac Cove, the terrain in the Lone Pine region was comparatively gentle and the opposing trenches were separated some distance with a flat no-man&#x27;s land intervening. Due to its location relative to the beachhead and the shape of the intervening ground, Lone Pine&#x27;s importance lay in the fact that its position provided a commanding view of the Australian and New Zealand rear areas. From the 400 Plateau it was possible to observe as far south as Gaba Tepe and its possession would have afforded the Ottomans the ability to place the approaches to the Second Ridge under fire, preventing the flow of reinforcements and supplies from the beachhead to the forward trenches.

The main part of the Australian position at Lone Pine was centred on a feature known as &quot;The Pimple&quot;, where a salient had developed at the point where the Australians&#x27; position was closest to the Ottoman line. To the east of the salient, opposite The Pimple, the Ottoman line extended from the head of a gully—known as &quot;Owen&#x27;s Gulley&quot; by the Australians—south for towards the neck of Bolton&#x27;s Ridge and continued south along a spur called &quot;Sniper&#x27;s Ridge&quot;. Because of the salient around The Pimple, the Ottomans had focused on developing the trenches along the flanks of the position more than the centre, and had placed the firing positions in the centre in depth in order to gain the advantage of being able to pour enfilade fire upon any attacking force. At the rear of the Ottoman line, near Owen&#x27;s Gully, was a depression called &quot;The Cup&quot; that was not visible from the Australians&#x27; position on The Pimple. Despite overflights of the area by British reconnaissance aircraft in June, the Australians were unaware of The Cup&#x27;s existence, and at the time of the attack they believed this area to be flat and to consist of further trench lines. In reality it was actually a reserve area where the Ottomans had established a regimental headquarters and sited a series of bivouacs in terraces and at the time of the attack there were large numbers of reinforcements camped there.

=== Military situation ===
Prior to the battle, isolated fighting around Lone Pine had begun early in the Gallipoli campaign. At around 7:00 a.m. on the first day of the Australian and New Zealand landings at Anzac Cove, 25 April 1915, elements of the Australian force had pushed through to Lone Pine in an effort to destroy an Ottoman artillery battery that had been firing down upon the landing beach. Before the Australians could engage the battery, the Ottomans had withdrawn to a ridge to the south-west, which the Australians later dubbed &quot;Third Ridge&quot; (or &quot;Gun Ridge&quot;). Pressing further inland, troops from the 6th Battalion had attempted to reach the ridge, crossing a wide valley (later known as &quot;Legge Valley&quot;), but they were pushed back when an Ottoman regiment, the 27th, had launched a counterattack from the south-east towards Lone Pine at 10:00 a.m., with the objective of retaking the 400 Plateau. Rolling up the 6th Battalion, the Ottomans pushed the Australians back to Pine Ridge, a finger of land that jutted south from Lone Pine towards Gaba Tebe. Taking heavy casualties, the Australians withdrew north to Lone Pine, where they were able to establish a defensive position. As reinforcements were brought up from New Zealand units, in the afternoon a second Ottoman regiment, the 77th, arrived and heavy hand-to-hand fighting ensued before the counterattack was blunted. Further fighting around Lone Pine continued throughout the early stages of the campaign, but eventually a stalemate developed in which neither side was able to advance and static trench warfare began.

In early July 1915, while making plans for an offensive to break the deadlock that had developed around the Gallipoli Peninsula following the initial landings in April, the commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, Lieutenant General William Birdwood, had determined that an attack at Lone Pine could be used to divert Ottoman attention away from a main attack that would be launched by a combined force of British, Indian and New Zealand troops further north around Sari Bair, Chunuk Bair and Hill 971. The Australian 1st Infantry Brigade was chosen to undertake the attack on Lone Pine, and consisted of about 3,000 men, under the command of a British officer, Colonel Nevill Smyth. Along with the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades, the 1st Infantry Brigade was part of the Australian 1st Division. The division&#x27;s commander was Brigadier General Harold Walker, a British officer who had replaced Major General William Bridges as temporary commander after Bridges had been killed by a sniper in May. Walker did not like the idea of launching an attack at Lone Pine, let alone a mere diversion, but when General Sir Ian Hamilton, the commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, insisted the attack proceed, through thorough planning, Walker endeavoured to give his troops the best chance of success possible on such an unfavourable battleground.

The Ottoman forces opposing the Australians at Lone Pine consisted of two battalions from the 47th Regiment, under the command of Tevfik Bey. These battalions amounted to a total of about 1,000 men, of which 500 were positioned in the trenches along the front, while another 500 were positioned further back in depth. Sitting further back in divisional reserve, to the north-east on &quot;Mortar Ridge&quot;, was a battalion from the 57th Regiment, which had been relieved from its position on the front line north of Lone Pine by an Arab battalion of the 72nd Regiment. The positions north and south of the Ottoman line at Lone Pine were held by the 125th Regiment at Johnston&#x27;s Jolly in the north and the 48th Regiment in the south along Pine Ridge.

=== Preparation ===
The width of the front of the attack was and the distance between the two trench lines was about . To reduce the distance to be crossed, the Australians projected a number of tunnels towards the Ottoman trenches from The Pimple. Immediately after the attack, one of these tunnels was to be opened along its length to make a communications trench through which reinforcements could advance without having to cross the exposed ground. Some of the attackers would have to make the advance over open ground from the Australian trench line. To provide some measure of protection for these men, three mines were set by engineers to make craters in which they could seek shelter. The preliminary bombardment was stretched over three days—initially confined to a limited &quot;slow shoot&quot;, building up to a final intense bombardment an hour before the assault—and was successful in cutting much of the barbed wire that the Ottomans had placed in front of their position. The preparation stage of the attack began at 2:00 p.m. on 6 August, when the Australians detonated the three mines they had dug in front of the Ottoman lines, in an attempt to create cover for the advancing troops. Two and a half hours later the final heavy preliminary bombardment commenced, with Australian, British and New Zealand artillery batteries firing on the Ottoman trench line, while naval gunfire support from the British cruiser HMS &quot;Bacchante&quot; provided counter-battery fire on Ottoman artillery positioned along Third Ridge. Retreating into tunnels which had been cut as part of mining operations, the majority of the forward Ottoman troops were able to find shelter from the bombardment that lasted for an hour.

While the artillery prepared the ground for the attack, behind the Australian lines the assault formations moved up towards The Pimple. Smyth sited his brigade headquarters at a position called &quot;Brown&#x27;s Dip&quot;, which was about south of the firing line. Due to the small front along which the attack was to be launched, the initial assault was to be undertaken in three waves by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Battalions while the 1st Battalion was to remain back at Brown&#x27;s Dip in reserve, ready to be brought up to consolidate any gains or respond in the event of a counterattack. Once the 1st Battalion had taken up its position, the assault battalions moved through them towards the forward line at The Pimple. Once the attack was launched, half the force would go via tunnels that had been dug out into no man&#x27;s land, while the other half would simply go &quot;over the top&quot;. By 5:00 p.m. all the troops had taken up their positions and as the barrage came to a conclusion, the tunnels were opened and final preparations were made.

Each soldier in the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 rounds of ammunition for his rifle, along with rations for one day, and miscellaneous equipment including a gas mask. The third wave had received the same amount of ammunition, but was also issued entrenching equipment that would be used to construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon whose job would be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack. A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.

=== Initial assault ===

At 5:30 p.m. the Australian 1st Infantry Brigade attacked as the first wave of 1,800 men threw themselves forward. To their north, the troops of the 2nd Infantry Brigade laid down suppressing fire on the supporting Ottoman troops at Johnston&#x27;s Jolly, while the 3rd Infantry and 2nd Light Horse Brigades held the line opposite Sniper&#x27;s Ridge. Half the force went via the prepared tunnels and half crossed the exposed ground between the trench lines. Dubbed the &quot;Daisy Patch&quot;, it amounted to a distance of about and it was raked with Ottoman artillery and small arms fire. From his headquarters overlooking the fighting, the senior Ottoman commander Esad Pasa, began to co-ordinate the response, passing orders for reinforcements to be brought up and calling down artillery. Casualties among the first wave of attackers were &quot;relatively light&quot; as the defenders in the front line of Ottoman trenches were still sheltering from the preliminary bombardment and had not had time to return to their fire steps after it had been lifted.

When the Australians reached the Ottoman trenches they found them roofed with pine logs with no easy entrance, which had not been identified by aerial reconnaissance during the planning stages. As the Ottoman defenders recovered from the artillery barrage, they began firing at the Australians through specially cut holes at point blank range. As the second and third waves of the attack came up, some of the Australians fired, grenaded and bayoneted from above, while some found their way inside through gaps or by lifting the logs, which were in places as thick as by . Others ran on past to the open communications and support trenches behind, where they were able to gain access to the trenches; about 70 Ottoman troops were captured as they attempted to escape and ran into the Australians entering the trenches. Small groups of Australians managed to push through to The Cup where they were stopped by Ottoman troops who were hastily assembled to defend their regimental headquarters. In the ensuing fighting there, almost all of the Australians were killed, while a handful were taken prisoner.

In the Ottoman trenches, the darkness and cramped conditions led to considerable confusion amongst the attackers. Due to concerns of shooting their comrades, the Australians were unable to fire their rifles initially, and the fighting devolved into a melee as the soldiers attacked each other with bayonets and grenades. The first Australians to enter the position were picked off by the defenders, but as the Australians established themselves in strength, they were able to break into the position before the defenders that had been sheltering in the tunnels behind the front line were able to fully respond. Over the space of half an hour the Australians took control of the position and, after ejecting the remaining Ottomans from the main trench, they established a number of defensive positions along the line. These amounted to positions in the communication trenches on the flanks of the captured ground and about seven or eight posts in the centre that were &quot;isolated&quot; but connected by hastily dug saps.

For the Australians, the attack had been successful, as they had gained possession of the main Ottoman line, and after being halted at The Cup they began preparing to defend their gains. Hastily erecting sandbag barriers along the parapet, they settled down to wait for the first counterattack. As they did so, the brigade reserve—the 1st Battalion—was brought up. Due to crowding in the tunnels that had been used for the attack, the reinforcements were sent via the open ground that had been in front of the old Ottoman positions; despite being behind the recently captured position, the ground was still subjected to heavy Ottoman artillery and machine-gun fire, which was being poured down from positions in overwatch on the flanks. Nevertheless, in company lots, the 1st Battalion moved up and began filling in the gaps between the assault battalions, while engineers from the 2nd Field Company began the task of extending the tunnels from The Pimple towards the new Australian line.

=== Ottoman counterattacks ===
Shortly after dark, around 7:00 p.m., the first Ottoman counterattack came after a group from the 1st Battalion, 57th Regiment, under Major Zeki Bey, arrived to reinforce the battalions of the 47th. Attacking with hand grenades, the fighting took place in the complicated maze of the former Ottoman trench system. The close quarters meant that some of the grenades would travel back and forth up to three times before exploding. The Australians held the old Ottoman fire trench and had footholds deeper in Ottoman lines. They blocked the Ottoman communications trenches as best they could, often with the bodies of the dead, to thwart raids. Other bodies were moved to unused communication trenches and saps, and where possible the wounded were evacuated, however, the fighting was so intense, the conditions so cramped and the men so exhausted that in many cases they were left to lie at the bottom of the trench.

Throughout the night of 6/7 August, the Ottomans brought up reinforcements from the 5th Division&#x27;s 13th Regiment under Ali Riza Bey, which marched from Kojadere, south-east of the position known to the Australians as &quot;Scrubby Knoll&quot;. The 9th Division, under German Colonel Hans Kannengiesser, also received orders to begin moving towards Lone Pine from its position between Helles and Anzac from Esad Pasa. Although the 9th Division was later diverted, after 8:00 p.m. the 15th Regiment, from the 5th Division, under the command of Ibrahim Sukru, was committed to the fighting, moving south from its position around the Kurt Dere, near Chunuk Blair.

For the next three days the Ottomans continued to launch incessant and ultimately unsuccessful counterattacks in an effort to recapture the ground they had lost. In total three regiments were dispatched. The Australians also brought up reinforcements, moving up men from two battalions from the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades—the 7th and 12th Battalions—to hold the 1st Brigade&#x27;s gains. Throughout 7 August, the fighting devolved into a series of hand grenade duels. To keep up the supply, Australians put about 50 soldiers to work at Anzac Cove manufacturing makeshift grenades out of empty jam tins: over 1,000 were sent up to the 1st Infantry Brigade late on 7 August. The fighting continued throughout the night of 7/8 August as the 47th Regiment, launched a determined counterattack; suffering heavy casualties, including the regimental commander, Tewfik Bey, the attack was unsuccessful in retaking the main front-line trenches, but succeeded in regaining some of the ground in the north and also pushed the Australians back a little way from The Cup.

As Ali Riza Bey, the commander of the 13th Regiment, took charge of the Ottoman effort around Lone Pine, the grenading continued into the next day as the Ottomans began to prepare for a large-scale counterattack. Throughout the morning the remaining Australian positions overlooking The Cup were abandoned before the fighting stopped briefly as both the Australians and Ottomans evacuated their wounded and removed the dead from the front-line. By this time the 1st and 2nd Battalions, which had been defending the heavily counterattacked southern flank, had suffered so many casualties that they were withdrawn from the line, with the 7th Battalion moving into their positions late in the afternoon. The 3rd, 4th and 12th Battalions remained holding the north and centre of the Australian line.

Further attacks were mounted by the Ottomans all along the Australian line after 3:00 p.m., but after dark they focused their efforts on the 7th Battalion&#x27;s position in the south; there the Ottomans succeeded in taking part of the Australian line late in the night, and fierce hand-to-hand fighting followed until early in the morning of 9 August as the Australians retook these positions. More grenade attacks were launched by Ottoman troops later that morning and as the Australian trenches were brought under fire from the Ottoman positions around Johnston&#x27;s Jolly, an attack was launched at the junctions between the Australian battalions. Achieving a break-in in the centre, they reached the 1st Infantry Brigade&#x27;s headquarters—which had advanced forward from Brown&#x27;s Dip following the initial gains—where the brigade commander, Smyth, joined the defence that eventually drove them back. Around midday the Ottomans put in another attack, but this too was repulsed. The positions on the southern Australian flank continued to be subjected to grenading, so the 5th Battalion was brought up to relieve the 7th. The 2nd Battalion, having received a brief respite, also came forward, replacing the 4th Battalion with the support of a dismounted squadron from the 7th Light Horse Regiment. As the fresh units settled in, the Australians prepared for renewed fighting along the line. In the end, the expected attack never came and finally, late in the afternoon of 9 August, the Ottoman commanders called off further attempts to dislodge the Australians. The next day, the fighting &quot;subsided&quot; as both the Ottomans and the Australians worked to consolidate their positions.

Private Victor Laidlaw of the Australian 2nd Field Ambulance wrote on 16 August:
== Aftermath ==
The fighting was &quot;some of the fiercest&quot; the Australians experienced during the campaign to that point. The ground captured during the battle amounted to a total of about across a front. Amidst scenes of considerable devastation, the Australian divisional commander, Walker, believed the result &quot;disastrous&quot;. The higher commanders believed it to have been a tactical success, however, with Hamilton describing it as a &quot;desperate fine feat&quot;. Though a tactical victory for the Australians in terms of the fact that they remained in possession of the ground captured, and had managed to draw off some Ottoman reinforcements, nevertheless the wider repercussions of the attack at Lone Pine weighed heavily on the outcome at Chunuk Bair. Sent north to reinforce Lone Pine, due to the effectiveness of the Australian attack, Kannengiesser&#x27;s 9th Division was directed instead to proceed on to Chunuk Bair where, at the time, there was only one Ottoman artillery battery and a covering force of 20 infantrymen. His force arrived in time to seriously delay the New Zealand attack, and ultimately the wider offensive of which the battle was a part failed. Afterwards, a stalemate situation developed on the Gallipoli peninsula although there were brief periods of localised fighting. In September, the troops of the Australian 1st Division who had taken the position at Lone Pine were relieved by the 23rd and 24th Battalions.

Dominated by the heights of Baby 700, the position was regularly shelled and was subsequently described by one Australian soldier, Trooper Ion Idriess, as &quot;the most dangerous spot&quot; in the Australian lodgement and it ultimately proved a &quot;liability&quot; for the troops tasked with holding it. Opposed by troops from the Ottoman 47th Regiment, for the remaining three months of the campaign, the two Australian battalions would alternate their positions in the front line as the Ottoman and Australians engaged in mining and countermining operations against each other&#x27;s positions. The stalemate continued as both the Australians and Ottomans lacked the strength to mount a determined attack and this situation ultimately lasted until the Allied evacuation in December 1915.

In most sources, Ottoman losses are estimated at between 5,000–6,000, although Kenan Celik from Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University, has placed their losses as high as 7,164, broken down as 1,520 killed, 4,700 wounded, 760 listed as missing and 134 captured by the Australians. These included the commanding officers of both the 47th and 15th Regiments. Of the Australian force that had launched the attack, almost half became casualties. Australian losses during the battle amounted to 2,277 men killed or wounded, out of the total 4,600 men committed to the fighting over the course of the battle. These represent some of the highest casualties of the campaign. The toll was particularly heavy amongst the Australian officers; both the commanding officers of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were killed leading their troops. After the battle, the dead were so thick on the ground that one Australian, Captain Harold Jacobs of the 1st Battalion, remarked &quot;[t]he trench is so full of our dead that the only respect that we could show them was not to tread on their faces, the floor of the trench was just one carpet of them, this in addition to the ones we piled into Turkish dugouts.&quot; Later, over 1,000 dead were removed from Australian position to be hastily buried.

Seven Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions during the fighting at Lone Pine, including four men from the 7th Battalion, which had been rushed forward to help relieve the 1st Brigade at the height of the Ottoman counterattacks. One of the recipients was Corporal William Dunstan, who after the war became the general manager of &quot;The Herald&quot; newspaper in Melbourne. Another VC recipient was Captain Alfred Shout who had already earned the Military Cross and been Mentioned in Despatches earlier in the Gallipoli campaign. He was mortally wounded at Lone Pine and was later buried at sea. The other VC recipients were Privates Leonard Keysor and John Hamilton, Corporal Alexander Burton and Lieutenants Frederick Tubb and William Symons.

After the war, an Australian military historical mission was sent to Gallipoli, led by Charles Bean. On Bean&#x27;s advice the Australian government sought permission from the newly formed Turkish Republic to establish an official war cemetery in the area. In 1923 the Treaty of Lausanne was ratified, and through its provisions the Lone Pine cemetery was established in the area, dubbed the Daisy Patch by the Australians. There are a total of 1,167 graves in the cemetery and as of 2012, the identities of 471 bodies interred in the cemetery remain unknown. Also standing within the cemetery&#x27;s grounds is the Lone Pine memorial. It is the main Australian and New Zealand memorial at Gallipoli and commemorates all the Australian and some of the New Zealanders who died during the campaign, including those who have no known grave and those buried at sea.

As a result of the battle&#x27;s significance to the Australians, Lone Pine is the site of the annual Australian Anzac Day dawn service at Gallipoli. After the service Australian visitors congregate at the memorial to remember all their countrymen who fought and died at Gallipoli. At the New Zealand National World War I Museum, there is an exhibit for the Battle of Lone Pine, and there is also one in the Australian War Memorial. Memorial &quot;Lone Pine&quot; trees have also been planted in Australia, New Zealand and Gallipoli to commemorate the battle and the Gallipoli campaign in general, seeded from specimens taken from Gallipoli. There are also many places in Australia named after the battle.

<doc id="417335" wikidata="Q27075917" url="?curid=417335" title="Bay-breasted warbler">
<text>The bay-breasted warbler (Setophaga castanea) is a small species of songbird in the New World warbler family, Parulidae. It is one of thirty-four species in the diverse genus &quot;Setophaga.&quot; Like all songbirds, or passerines, the species is classified in the order Passeriformes.

==Distribution==
Bay-breasted warblers breed in the boreal spruce-fir forests of eastern and central Canada, as well as the extreme northern United States. The species winters in the wet lowland forests of northeastern South America, the Caribbean, and southern Central America, and may be seen during spring and fall migration across the eastern half of the United States in a variety of vegetative communities. Many individuals cross the Gulf of Mexico on their long-distance migration, although some travel north and south along the Mexican shore.

==Diet and behavior==
In the breeding season, bay-breasted warblers feed primarily on insects and spiders, especially the spruce budworm (&quot;Choristoneura fumiferana&quot;). These are gleaned from vegetation, never caught on the wing. To avoid competition with similar species, bay-breasted warblers concentrate their foraging on the breeding grounds to the interior middle portions of coniferous trees. On wintering grounds in the tropics, fruit forms a majority of the diet. Wintering bay-breasted warblers often form mixed-species flocks with other neotropical migrants and resident species. These flocks seek food in the forest canopy, and the bay-breasted warbler is often an aggressive member of the unit, bullying smaller species from potential food sources.

==Breeding==
Nests are typically constructed in the lower portion of a spruce or fir tree. The nest is cup-shaped and primarily composed of plant material, with spider silk often utilized as well. Average clutch size is 4–7 whitish eggs with dark spots. The young are altricial at birth, with limited down.

==Description==
Adult males in breeding plumage are primarily grayish above, with two white wing bars, dark streaks on the back, and a creamy neck patch. The face is black, and the crown, throat, and sides are a dark chestnut color. Breeding females are similar in overall pattern to the males, but are paler and duller. In the nonbreeding season, both sexes gain olive-green feathers on the back, nape, and head. The rufous on the flanks is limited and may even fade away entirely in nonbreeding females. The two white wing bars are present in all plumages.
===Measurements===


==Similar species==
In breeding plumage, the bay-breasted warbler may be confused with the chestnut-sided warbler (&quot;Setophaga pensylvanica&quot;), which has similar chestnut coloration on the sides. Chestnut-sided warblers may be easily differentiated by the extent of the chestnut, which does not reach the throat or crown. Chestnut-sided warblers also have a bright yellow crown, dark mask, and white cheek and throat in breeding plumage. In fall, nonbreeding bay-breasted Warblers may look very similar to the blackpoll warbler (&quot;Setophaga striata&quot;). However, blackpoll warblers never have a hint of chestnut coloration on the flanks, and also have yellowish feet, unlike the black feet of the bay-breasted warbler.

==Conservation==
Although currently classified by the IUCN as least concern, bay-breasted warblers, like many songbirds, are facing population declines across their range. A loss of insect prey and global climate change are contributing factors to decline. The global population is estimated to be fewer than 10 million individuals. 

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Setophaga&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;ses&quot;, &quot;moth&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, &quot;eating&quot;, and the specific &quot;castanea&quot; is Latin for chestnut-coloured.

<text>The Victoria Ground was the home ground of Stoke City from 1878 until 1997, when the club relocated to the Britannia Stadium after 119 years. At the time of its demolition it was the oldest operational ground in the Football League.

==History==

The Victoria Ground had been Stoke City&#x27;s home since March 1878 and the first match was the inaugural Staffordshire Cup final against Talke Rangers on 28 March 1878, Stoke won 1–0 before 2,500 spectators. The ground took its name from the nearby Victoria Hotel and was originally an oval shape, built to accommodate a running track and used by the local athletic club. There was an open grass bank at each end, and a small but compact wooden stand on the east side (Boothen Road) capable of housing 1,000 people. Opposite this stand was another bank which could hold 4,000. The ground remained this way for 30 years during which time Stoke had become members of the Football League. The first league match at the Victoria Ground was on 8 September 1888 and ended in a 2–0 defeat against West Bromwich Albion. Stoke suffered financial difficulties and dropped out of the league in 1908 and attendances varied during their time out. Stoke got back into the league in 1919 and the ground had now been improved considerably. There were two good sized grandstands and an extra wooden one which was situated opposite the main stand and could hold 1,000 supporters.

The players changing rooms were set in the corner of the ground which also included a stove so players could keep warm. Above the changing &#x27;hut&#x27; was the directors box, a rather primitive building but could hold around 12 people. During the early 1920s a new, mainly wooden main stand was erected alongside the &#x27;hut&#x27; and this could hold 2,000 fans. By 1930 Stoke had added &#x27;City&#x27; to their name and the Boothen End was terraced and later covered, and consequently the ground lost its oval shape. 1935, when the likes of Stanley Matthews was beginning to draw in the crowds, the Butler Street Stand was built, giving seating to 5,000 people. In front of the seats was a small paddock, room for another 2,000 and it took the ground capacity to around the 45,000 mark. A record crowd of 51,380 packed into the Victoria Ground on 29 March 1937 to watch a First Division match against Arsenal. During World War II the Butler Street Stand was used as an army storage camp.

Floodlights were installed at the ground in 1956 and local rivals Port Vale marked the &#x27;official&#x27; switching on ceremony by playing Stoke in a friendly on 10 October 1956. In 1960 another new main stand was built and the dressing rooms were revamped. In the summer of 1963 concrete was laid on the paddock terracing and it was the Stoke players who helped lay it as part of a team bonding scheme. More improvements continued in the 1960s and the ground remained in a good condition until January 1976.

Over the weekend of the 3/4 January 1976, with Stoke playing Tottenham Hotspur away in the FA Cup, winds of hurricane force battered the Stoke-on-Trent area and especially the Victoria Ground for around eight hours. The strong winds blew a section of the roof off the Butler Street Stand leaving only the west corner intact. Top priority was to put the roof back in order that the replay against Tottenham could take place on 7 January. However, on the day of the match as workmen were replacing timber supports and erecting scaffolding, some of the supports collapsed and a number of workers were injured, The match itself was cancelled on safety grounds. Stoke had to play one home league match against Middlesbrough at Vale Park on 17 January and the Victoria Ground was reopened by 24 January in time for Stoke to play Tottenham in the cup.

The final improvements to the ground were made during the 1980s with the Stanley Matthews suite being opened as well as a new club shop and offices.

With the Taylor Report of January 1990 requiring all clubs in the top two division of English football have an all-seater stadium by August 1994, the club drew up plans to meet the requirements at the Victoria Ground, in spite of relegation to the Third Division in 1990, as the club was intent on re-establishing itself in the top two divisions – which was achieved three years later.

However, after a few years, Stoke chairman Peter Coates instead decided to move the club to a new location and so in 1997 Stoke left the Victoria Ground after 119 years for the new 28,000-seater Britannia Stadium at Trentham Lakes. The final league match at the Victoria was on 4 May 1997 against the first opponents West Bromwich Albion, Stoke won 2–1 with Graham Kavanagh scoring the final Stoke goal.

The Victoria Ground was demolished in June 1997 and the site stood empty for over 20-years until a housing development was built in 2019 named Victoria Park with the streets named after former Stoke players and managers.

<text>The Comprehensive Disabled Afghans Programme (CDAP) was a United Nations agency which was run by UNOPS CDAP worked to help disabled Afghans by establishing community rehabilitation centers, providing mobility devices, and special education for disabled children. From 1991 to 2004 they helped rehabilitate over 100,000 Afghan people injured by landmines. The program manager was Peter Colerdge.

In September 2004, following an external evaluation in 2003, the UNDP took over responsibility for the program, and redeveloped it as the National Program for Action on Disability (NPAD).

The Mine Action Program for Afghanistan estimated that 400,000 people were killed or injured by landmines in Afghanistan between 1990 and 2000. The CDAP reported that over half of the victims were men of working age, between the ages of 18 and 40.

Despite a reputation for being unfair to women, the Taliban administrators encouraged women to participate in the CDAP and even allowed them to work alongside men.

<doc id="417359" wikidata="Q454424" url="?curid=417359" title="Francis Egerton, 8th Earl of Bridgewater">
<text>Francis Henry Egerton, 8th Earl of Bridgewater, (11 November 1756 – 11 February 1829), known as Francis Egerton until 1823, was a noted British eccentric from the Egerton family and supporter of natural theology.

Bridgewater was a Church of England clergyman who held the rectories of Myddle (1781) and Whitchurch (1797) in Shropshire, but the duties were performed by a proxy. He succeeded his brother John in the earldom in 1823, and spent the latter part of his life in Paris. He was a fair scholar, and a zealous naturalist and antiquarian. When he died in February 1829 the earldom became extinct.

==Early life==
Born in London in 1756, Bridgewater was the younger son of John Egerton, Bishop of Durham and Anne Sophia Grey. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford where he gained his Bachelor of Arts in 1776, and became a fellow of All Souls in 1780, and Fellow of the Royal Society in 1781. He inherited his title and a large fortune in 1823 from his brother, the 7th Earl.

==Career==
Bridgewater was eccentric. According to the Parisian police, Bridgewater kept dogs and cats in his house which he dressed as ladies and gentlemen and would take them with him in his carriage. He kept partridges and pigeons with clipped wings in his garden, allowing him to shoot them despite failing eyesight. He never married, and upon his death, his title became extinct. He was buried at Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire.

In the early 17th century, Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley, had purchased Ashridge House, one of the largest country houses in England, from Queen Elizabeth I, who had inherited it from her father who had appropriated it after the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. Ashridge House served the Egerton family as a residence until the 19th century. The Egertons later had a family chapel (the Bridgewater Chapel) with burial vault in Little Gaddesden Church, where many monuments commemorate the Dukes and Earls of Bridgewater and their families.

==Arts and science==
Bridgewater was invested as a Fellow of the Royal Society (F.R.S.) on 8 November 1781 and as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (F.S.A.) on 31 March 1791.

In 1812, he wrote &quot;Description du Plan Incliné Souterrain&quot; about the underground canals of the Worsley Navigable Levels, coal mines in Worsley, Greater Manchester, part of the Bridgewater estate.

A Freemason who had been Initiated in France, from 10 August 1786 until 1800 Bridgewater was Provincial Grand Master for Shropshire and North Wales, adding Staffordshire, Flint, Denbighshire and Montgomeryshire to his responsibilities in 1791. For all that this was an extensive area, the duties associated with the position at that time were light, and in many cases (up to 1795) left in the hands of his Deputy/Provincial Grand Secretary Charles Shirreff. The Secretary of Whitchurch Lodge no. 1, John Collier, was one of the curates who deputised for Bridgewater at the church in the town.

==Bridgewater estate==
At his death in Paris in 1829, Bridgewater&#x27;s titles became extinct. He left the majority of his estates, including Ashridge, to John Hume Cust, Viscount Alford, heir to Earl Brownlow. Alford&#x27;s grandmother was Lady Amelia Egerton, great-granddaughter of John Egerton, 3rd Earl of Bridgewater. The estates drew income of £70,000 annually (). However, Bridgewater left the estates with a peculiar stipulation: Alford could only keep them provided he be raised to the peerage as Duke or Marquess of Bridgewater, and that if he failed to do so, the estates would go to his younger brother the Hon. Charles Henry Cust, with the same requirement.

&quot;Provided also, and I declare my will to be, that it shall happen that the said John Hume, Lord Viscount Alford shall not acquire the title and dignity of the Duke Marquis Bridgewater, to him or the heirs male of his body, with the immediate limitation over of such title and dignity to the said Charles Henry Cust and the heirs male of his body, or to the heirs male of his body if he shall be dead leaving issue male, and also, that the said Charles Henry Cust shall not acquire the title and dignity of Duke or of Bridgewater, to him and the heirs male of his body, then such case the use and estate hereinbefore directed be limited to the heirs male of the body of the said Charles Henry Cust shall cease and be absolutely void.&quot;

Alford assumed the name and arms of Egerton, but died in January 1851, aged only 38. His eldest son, John Brownlow Cust, just shy of 9 years old, adopted the Egerton surname as his father&#x27;s heir. Charles Cust then adopted the surname Egerton and in February 1851 sued his nephew for the Bridgewater estates, as his brother had failed to meet the conditions of Bridgewater&#x27;s will.

The court initially ruled in Charles Cust&#x27;s favor. Lord Justice Lord Cranworth ruled in 1852 that as Alford had died without the title and dignity of Marquess or Duke of Bridgewater, therefore his heirs were not entitled to the estates. Alford&#x27;s son, who succeeded his grandfather as 2nd Earl Brownlow in 1853, appealed the ruling to the House of Lords. The majority of the judges agreed with Cranworth&#x27;s opinion that the estate should go in accordance with Bridgewater&#x27;s wishes as outlined in his will. However, surprisingly, Lord Lyndhurst, Brougham, Truro, and St Leonards argued that the codicil was in fact illegal. They successfully argued that such a demand could lead to heirs acquiring peerages purely for financial gain, and thus the court allowing Bridgewater&#x27;s request to stand went against the public good.

The duties of a peer were of grave and important character——he had duties the Legislature, as well those of judicial character to accomplish. Moreover, a peer had the right to demand audience of the Sovereign to offer his advice upon the subject of public affairs. These were high and important functions both as to power and as to duty. In those, as well political matters, a peer was bound to act free from any improper motive——least of all, ought there to be any motive of a pecuniary character to influence his movements in the discharge of the duties attached to his position and station. This was the position, these were the obligations and duties of peer. It followed, then, that any disposition of property which in any way tended to interfere with the discharge of those duties was at variance with the public good. 

Brownlow&#x27;s appeal was successful and Lord Cranworth&#x27;s earlier ruling was reversed.

===Bequests===
Bridgewater bequeathed to the British Museum the valuable Egerton Manuscripts, consisting of 67 volumes and 96 charters dealing with the literature of France and Italy. Additionally, he left two bequests totalling £12,000 () to establish the Egerton Fund from which the Museum could purchase additional manuscripts. More than 3,800 manuscripts have been purchased using the Egerton fund.

He also left £8,000 () at the disposal of the president of the Royal Society, to be paid to the author or authors who might be selected to write and publish 1,000 copies of a treatise &quot;On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation&quot;. The resulting eight Bridgewater Treatises first appeared between 1833 and 1836, and afterwards in Bohn&#x27;s Scientific Library.

Incorporated in 1854 by an Act of Parliament and opened in 1857, the school claims to offer &quot;classical&quot; or &quot;grammar&quot; school education thought of as liberal, humane, pre-vocational pedagogy.

As of 2006, Sydney Grammar School had an enrolment of approximately 1,841 students from kindergarten to Year 12, over three campuses. The two preparatory schools (K to 6), are located at Edgecliff in Sydney&#x27;s Eastern Suburbs, and St Ives, on the Upper North Shore. The College Street campus caters for students from Forms I to VI (Years 7–12), and is located in Darlinghurst.

The school is affiliated with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference, and is a founding member of the Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales (AAGPS).

As of 2019, it was ranked the 3rd most expensive school in Australia with an average annual school fee of $36,615 per student.

== History ==
===Foundation===

The Sydney Public Free Grammar School was opened in 1825 by Laurence Hynes Halloran, born County Meath, Ireland (1765–1831). Previously, Halloran had operated a private school in Exeter, England, however fled in 1796 due to debts, after being accused of immorality. It subsequently emerged that his degrees (in divinity) were self-awarded. He eventually returned to Britain but was arrested for forgery and transported to the penal colony of New South Wales, arriving there in 1819. He was immediately granted a ticket-of-leave.

In 1854, Sydney Grammar School (SGS) was incorporated by an Act of Parliament and acquired the land and building in College Street which had been temporarily occupied by the newly founded University of Sydney in 1852. It was opened on 3 August 1857, specifically as a feeder school for the university.

The preamble of the Sydney Grammar School Act 1854 states:

It is deemed expedient for the better advancement of religion and morality and the promotion of useful knowledge to establish in Sydney a public school for conferring on all classes and denominations of Her Majesty’s subjects resident in the Colony of New South Wales without any distinction whatsoever the advantages of a regular and liberal course of education.
The act provides that the trustees of the school shall consist of twelve persons, of whom six shall be persons holding the following offices respectively:
*The Honourable the Attorney-General of New South Wales
*The Honourable the President of the New South Wales Legislative Council
*The Honourable the Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly
*The Chancellor of the University of Sydney
*The Principal Professor of Classics of the University of Sydney
*The Senior Professor of Mathematics of the University of Sydney

The act also provides that the Governor of New South Wales shall be the official visitor of the school.

=== Site history ===
Sydney Grammar School is the oldest school still in use in the City of Sydney, and is historically the site on which the University of Sydney began. The school buildings also contain examples of early building materials and techniques in pre-Federation Australia.

The site was founded as The Sydney College in 1830, and the following year began operations in a new building in Hyde Park designed by Edward Hallen. It consisted of a single large room (now known as &quot;Big School&quot;) with basement rooms beneath. Sydney College continued despite financial difficulties until 1853, when it was taken over by the fledgling University of Sydney until such time as the present Grose Farm site was ready for occupation. The site was then sold in 1856 to the trustees of the newly incorporated Sydney Grammar School, which had been established and endowed with a building fund by Act of Parliament. Edmund Blacket was commissioned to design extensions to the south and north of the Hallen building (now the North and South Blacket rooms), which were completed in 1856 and 1857 respectively. The &quot;Big School&quot; building became central to the Colonial Architect, James Barnet&#x27;s vision for the cultural focus of Sydney Town.

The War Memorial wing, named for its position behind Big School&#x27;s monument to the Great War, was built at the northern end of Big School in 1953 by the Scott brothers, at the cost of its double staircase. In 1876, the main building was extended to the east by Mansfield Brothers, and this extension was itself extended to the north and south in 1899 by John W Manson. The Science classrooms on Stanley Street were built in 1889–90. Other early buildings on the site, now demolished, included the Sergeant&#x27;s Lodge, an ablutions block (known as the &quot;White House&quot;) on Stanley Street, and a former postal sorting office on Yurong Street (now the Palladium building).

=== Today ===

Sydney Grammar is a private school. Each year up to 26 full scholarships are offered to students who show academic promise and who perform well in the scholarship examination. It is also regarded for its strong academic results: for example, in national government testing (&#x27;NAPLAN&#x27; testing), it is one of the best performing private school nationwide, and a high performer in the New South Wales Higher School Certificate with over 50% of graduates receiving a 95 ATAR (&#x27;Australian Tertiary Admissions Ranking&#x27;) or higher between 2009 to 2023.

Sydney Grammar is located near the Sydney central business district. The campus is compact and consists of multi-storey buildings (of up to eight floors) in a concrete landscape setting. Sydney Grammar is situated on the eastern side of Sydney&#x27;s Hyde Park, next to the Australian Museum, and extends from College Street to Yurong Street. The designs of the school&#x27;s buildings illustrate many different architectural eras: &quot;Big School&quot; (dating from the early 19th century colonial era), the Blacket buildings (annexed onto either side of &quot;Big School&quot; and completed in the 1850s), the original Science building (1891), the Science laboratory block (1960s), the Palladium building (an example of 1970s Modernist architecture), the Stanley Street building and Alastair Mackerras Theatre (1980s), and the A. B. &#x27;Banjo&#x27; Paterson Library (1990s).

Weigall, the school&#x27;s sportsground (named after former Headmaster Albert Bythesea Weigall), is located at Rushcutters Bay next to the Edgecliff Preparatory School and includes tennis courts, cricket nets and three fields for cricket, rugby and football. It is routinely used for Saturday sports matches, physical education and as a recreational area for Grammar&#x27;s Edgecliff Preparatory School next door. There is also a large gymnasium at College Street and full rowing facilities at the school&#x27;s boatshed at Gladesville.

In May 2005, Headmaster John Vallance announced that the school would lead a consortium to purchase 30 Alma Street Paddington, known as White City, from Tennis New South Wales, thus extending the Weigall grounds substantially. In 2006, development applications to subdivide the White City tennis courts (numbered DA 20/2006 and DA 302/2006) were lodged with Woollahra Council to develop the site to accommodate more tennis and basketball courts; these were subsequently passed.

On 14 June 2008 the new field now known as Weigall 4 was opened with a range of guests including Frank Lowy, president of Football Federation Australia.

In 2009, the school began the construction of a new, underground multi-purpose hall featuring a seating capacity of over 1,500 seats, now called the John Vallance Hall (formerly The New Hall from its opening until 2017). Completed in August 2011, it was primarily designed to accommodate the entirety of the current students and teaching staff under one roof while being acoustically sound for orchestral performances.
The hall was officially opened by the headmaster on 18 August 2011 with a celebratory concert featuring performances from a large number of Grammar boys past and present. The John Vallance Hall is now used by the two preparatory schools as well.

== Headmasters ==
The current headmaster of Sydney Grammar School is Richard Malpass, who replaced John Vallance when he resigned on 7 April 2017.

==Co-curriculum==
=== Music ===

SGS has won the AMEB Music Shield 23 times in the past 25 years. Two-thirds of pupils in the school play a musical instrument or are involved with music in some way. SGS has scores of musical groups in mostly classical, chamber and jazz styles. The School Orchestra engages in both national and international tours. Grammar&#x27;s choir program involves hundreds of students, old boys, and parents, participating in its many annual concerts. The school&#x27;s senior a cappella group is known as The Grammarphones and is composed of the best tenors, basses and baritones in the senior years. The school&#x27;s senior big band, the Sydney Grammar School Big Band, is a regular feature at the Manly Jazz Festival.

SGS embarked on a five-year program entitled &quot;Bach: 2010&quot;, in which all the known choral cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in a series of concerts between 2005 and 2010. Sydney Grammar is one of the few institutions in the world that has engaged in such an exercise and was aided by the Mander organ in the Big School. A performance has been held every year since by head of practical music studies, Robert Wagner, on the Bach&#x27;s birthday.

Under the current Head Master, an organic rock-&amp;-roll movement has emerged and is currently thriving. The end of 2004 saw the consummation of years of practice in the first &quot;Grammarpalooza&quot; rock concert, which included the musical style of Old Boy band, &quot;Dappled Cities Fly&quot;.

=== Sport ===
Sydney Grammar School is a member of the Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of NSW (GPS), Australia&#x27;s oldest school sporting association. GPS sporting events include rugby union, football, cricket, tennis, volleyball, cross country, basketball, rowing, swimming, athletics, rifle shooting, and debating. The school also competes in fencing and chess competitions.

Grammar participates in the annual Tri-Grammar competitions, a series of cricket competitions between the Firsts teams of Sydney Grammar School, Melbourne Grammar School and Brisbane Grammar School. Sydney and Melbourne Grammar School also compete for &quot;The Bat&quot; in the same competition. The Sydney–Melbourne match dates back to 1876, and in 1976, to mark the centenary of this rivalry, a &quot;Bat&quot; was struck, with the winner of the annual match taking possession. The bat was donated by John Crawford, the father of the captain of the 1976 premiership winning side Andrew Crawford.

The school launched its rowing program in 1878, and has maintained it since. Competition in rowing culminates in the Riverview Gold Cup for Junior Crews and the Head of the River for Senior Crews. Grammar&#x27;s boatshed is on the Parramatta River at Gladesville.

On 2 April 2011, Sydney Grammar School first eight won the Major Rennie Trophy at the AAGPS Head of the River. This marked the first victory for the school since 1978. In its history, Grammar has won the race sixteen times, the most after the Shore School. Many rowers have gone on to row in Varsity Crews at a university level. In the 2014–2015 Harvard University rowing roster, Sydney Grammar had the most rowers out of any high school globally and two Sydney Grammar rowers were in Harvard&#x27;s top crew (First Varsity Eight).

=== Academic extension ===
The school operates academic extension programmes in both sciences and humanities, which includes olympiad programmes and hosting visiting scholars who spend time teaching and giving a public lecture. Notable scholars have included metaethicist Simon Blackburn, science and medical historian Sir Geoffrey Lloyd, zoologist Andrew Parker, astronomer and 1999 Young Australian of the Year Bryan Gaensler, historian Sir Christopher Clark, professor of English Dame Marina Warner, professor of Greek Richard Hunter, and composer Robin Holloway.

As part of an academic extension activity, a group of year 11 students attempted to prepare the medication pyrimethamine (sold as Daraprim) in 2016. Pyrimethamine is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system, for both adults and children. It is used to treat toxoplasmosis, cystoisosporiasis, and malaria (in combination with sulfadoxine). It received significant attention when its manufacturer in the United States was acquired by Turing Pharmaceuticals, and its CEO Martin Shkreli decided to increase the price from US$13.50 to US$750 a dose. Hence, a group of year 11 students from Grammar, supported by Matthew H. Todd from the University of Sydney and the Open Source Malaria consortium, have prepared pyrimethamine. The students started with 17 g of (4-chlorophenyl)acetonitrile (which is available from Sigma-Aldrich for $36.50 per 100 g) and prepared 3.7 g of pyrimethamine, which is about US$110,000 at Turing&#x27;s prices.

Their work has attracted attention from around the world, being reported in &quot;The Independent&quot;, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, and &quot;BBC News&quot; in the United Kingdom, the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in the United States, among others. By replacing expensive chemicals with alternatives available in a high school laboratory, they demonstrated that the synthesis can be carried out fairly simply and safely, and at a cost of approximately $2 per dose (US$1.48). Business magazine &quot;Forbes&quot; described the work as figuratively &quot;punch[ing] Martin Shkreli in the face&quot; and as raising questions about pharmaceutical companies which do not do substantial amounts of research. Unfortunately, as a consequence of the closed distribution model which Turing employs in the United States, any competing company seeking to market a generic alternative to Daraprim (including using the approach the boys developed with their teacher) would need to compare their product with a sample of Daraprim provided directly by Turing; if Turing refuses to provide that sample, the competitor would need to undertake a complete new clinical trial, which creates a prohibitive barrier to entering the market. The boys are quoted making comments highly critical of Shkreli&#x27;s and Turing&#x27;s behaviour, and have been applauded on social media with comments that their work highlights Shkreli&#x27;s greed, though he has minimised their achievement.

Shkreli subsequently posted a video about the achievement, declaring his &quot;delight&quot; about students entering the STEM field, describing them as &quot;proof that the 21st century economy will solve problems of human suffering through science and technology&quot;, and stating that &quot;[w]e should congratulate these students for their interest in chemistry and all be excited about what is to come in the STEM-focused 21st century.&quot; The students presented their work at the Royal Australian Chemical Institute&#x27;s NSW Organic Chemistry symposium alongside students at fourth-year undergraduate and postgraduate levels, as well as postdoctoral researchers.

=== Clubs and Societies ===
The school has numerous clubs and societies for students. Notable examples include:
*Australian Air Force Cadets (Established in 1942)
*Australian Army Cadets (Founded in 1871 by School Headmaster Albert Bythesea Weigall, the Corps is one of the oldest military units in the nation, even predating the Australian Army.)
*Creative Writing Club, run by notable author John Hughes
*Chess Club
*Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme
*Debating

A number of boys also assist in editing the school&#x27;s yearly almanac, &quot;The Sydneian&quot;, over 400 editions of which have been produced since 1875.

== Notable alumni ==
Alumnus of Sydney Grammar School are commonly referred to as Old Boys or Old Sydneians, and may elect to join the schools alumni association, the Old Sydneians&#x27; Union (OSU).

Grammar is notable for having educated many Rhodes Scholars, High Court judges (Australia&#x27;s highest court) and the equal highest number of Australian Prime Ministers, out of any school in Australia. Its alumni also include influential figures in business, international sport, science and medicine, and the performing arts, like David Gonski (leading Australian philanthropist, chairman of the Future Fund, chancellor of the New South Wales) and Rowan Gillies (former international president of Médecins Sans Frontières).

Notable alumni also include Sir Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister of Australia (1901–1903), Sir William McMahon, 20th Prime Minister of Australia (1971–1972), Malcolm Turnbull, 29th Prime Minister of Australia (2015–2018), Bruce Gyngell, first person to appear on Australian television, Andrew &quot;Boy&quot; Charlton, an Olympic gold medallist swimmer, and also Banjo Paterson – bush poet and balladist, and author of &quot;The Man From Snowy River&quot; and &quot;Waltzing Matilda,&quot; and who now has the school library named after him.

<doc id="417369" wikidata="Q6228055" url="?curid=417369" title="John Cyril Smith">
<text>Sir John Cyril Smith (15 January 1922 – 14 February 2003), born Barnard Castle, County Durham, was an English legal academic. Smith was an authority on English criminal law and the philosophy of criminal liability. Together with Brian Hogan he was the author of &quot;Smith &amp; Hogan&#x27;s Criminal Law&quot;, a leading undergraduate text on English criminal law. The textbook is now in its sixteenth edition (2021) and has been used as persuasive authority on crimes prosecuted in the law courts of England and Wales and elsewhere in the common law world. In 1998, Lord Bingham praised Smith; &quot;whom most would gladly hail as the outstanding criminal lawyer of our time.&quot; Smith and Hogan&#x27;s Criminal Law is now edited by Professor David Ormerod QC and Karl Laird.

== Early life and education ==
Smith was educated at St Mary&#x27;s Grammar School in Darlington. Brian Hogan, with whom he authored &quot;Smith and Hogan&#x27;s Criminal Law&quot;, attended the same school. Smith won a scholarship to attend the University of Oxford to read history, but chose not to take it up, instead leaving school to join his father&#x27;s engineering business. Smith then enrolled in the British Army, serving in the Royal Artillery during World War II, rising to the rank of Captain. It was whilst in the army that Smith developed an interest in the law; subsequently, he helped administer courts martial. After leaving the Army in 1947, Smith read law at Downing College, Cambridge, graduating with a First. In 1950 Smith was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and called to the Bar. In 1977 he became an Honorary Bencher of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

== Academic career ==
Smith joined the Department of Law at the University of Nottingham in 1950 as an Assistant Lecturer in Law. Smith was appointed as the Head of the Department of Law in 1956, and was promoted to Professor of Law in 1957. Smith remained Head of the department for almost thirty years, briefly serving as the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the university from 1973 to 1977. Smith also spent a year at Harvard University after being awarded a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship. Smith&#x27;s time at Harvard influenced him to write &quot;&#x27;A Casebook on Contract&quot;&#x27; in 1955, alongside J.A.C. Thomas. The book is now in its fourteenth edition (2021). Andrew Ashworth says Smith was &#x27;instrumental&#x27; in creating a &#x27;formidable reputation&#x27; for the University of Nottingham in teaching law.

In 1954, Smith became a founding member of the editorial board of the Criminal Law Review, to which he would contribute frequently throughout his career. Smith&#x27;s long association with the Criminal Law Review was notable for his frequent case commentaries, wherein Smith was unafraid to strongly criticise judgments. This led to a public rebuke from Lord Justice Lawton, though Smith did not back down. Smith was notable in the area of the criminal law on theft, writing a monograph titled &quot;The Law of Theft&quot; in 1968, now in its ninth edition (2007).

During the 1960s Smith was a co-opted member of the Criminal Law Revision Committee, being appointed member in the late 1970s. The resulting recommendations played an important part in the development of the Theft Acts of 1968 &amp; 1978. Smith, in several Criminal Law Review case commentaries, was notably critical of the interpretations of the Theft Acts, particularly &quot;DPP v Gomez&quot; and &quot;R v Hinks.&quot; Smith was an advocate for a criminal code of England and Wales (an English Criminal Code) working on a draft criminal code in the early 1980s, which was adopted by the Law Commission in 1989. The code has not yet been adopted, which, during his lifetime, was to the great disappointment of Professor Smith.

Smith noted that the &#x27;only subject he had taught every year throughout his career was evidence.&#x27; Smith wrote the book &quot;Criminal Evidence&quot; published by Sweet &amp; Maxwell (1 June 1995).

Smith was elected as a fellow of the British Academy in 1973. He was made QC in 1973 and knighted in 1993 for &#x27;services to legal education.&#x27;

== Personal life and death ==
Smith was married to Shirley Walters, they had two sons and one daughter.

Smith died in Nottingham on the 14 February 2003.

<text>The Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales (AAGPS) is a sporting association of boys&#x27; schools in New South Wales, Australia that contest sporting events among themselves. The AAGPS was formed on 30 March 1892, and today has nine members – eight Sydney schools and one northern NSW country school. The descriptor &#x27;Public School&#x27; references the historical usage of the term and the model of the British public school; all except Sydney Boys High School are in modern parlance private schools.

AAGPS representative sports sides are selected typically for matches against representative sides of the Combined Associated Schools (CAS), Independent Schools Association (ISA) and Combined High Schools (CHS).

Of the 130 Rhodes Scholars from 1904 to 2006 and from New South Wales, 85 attended a GPS School and of the 12 Australian Prime Ministers that attended school in Sydney from 1902 to 2023, 6 attended a GPS school specifically Sydney Grammar School, Sydney Boys High, Shore School or St Ignatius College (Riverview).

==History==
The Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales (AAGPS) was formed at a meeting held at Gunsler&#x27;s Café, near Circular Quay, on 30 March 1892. The schools represented at this first meeting were The King&#x27;s School, Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, St Joseph&#x27;s College, All Saints&#x27; College, Bathurst and the North Shore Grammar School (Shore). On 12 April, representatives from Sydney Grammar School, Newington College and Cooerwull Academy joined those who had attended the first meeting.

A third meeting was held on 28 April 1892, where membership of the AAGPS was clarified, and St Patrick&#x27;s College, Goulburn, St Stanislaus College, Bathurst, and The Scots College joined those Schools who attended the first two meetings.

Sydney High School applied for membership in March 1894, but were not accepted for admission until 14 February 1906. The final entrant was The Armidale School, who was admitted to the Association on 7 May 1897.

New E7 series 12-car sets, also based at Nagano Depot, were introduced on &quot;Asama&quot; services from the start of the revised timetable on 15 March 2014. These trains include &quot;Gran Class&quot; seating arranged 2+1 abreast. E7 series trainsets were initially used on seven return services daily, with a further four return workings added from 19 April 2014. JR West W7 series 12-car sets, based at Hakusan Depot, were introduced from the start of the revised timetable on 14 March 2015.

===Former rolling stock===
* E2 series 8-car J sets (from 1 October 1997 until 2002)
* E2 series 8-car N sets (from 1 October 1997 until 31 March 2017)
* 200 series 12-car F80 set (February 1998 only)

==History==

===Semi-express &quot;Asama&quot;===
The name &quot;Asama&quot; was first introduced on 1 March 1961 for services operating between Nagano and Niigata. This service operated until 30 November 1962, after which the train was renamed . From 1 December 1962, the name was used for the semi-express services operating between Ueno in Tokyo and Nagano on the Shinetsu Line. This service continued until 30 September 1963, after which the train was renamed .

===Limited express &quot;Asama&quot;===

After a gap of three years, the name &quot;Asama&quot; was re-introduced from 1 October 1966 on the Limited express services operating between Ueno and Nagano or Naoetsu. By the late 1990s, there were 29 workings daily in each direction, formed of 9- or 11-car 189 series EMU formations. During the busy summer periods, a second Green car was sometimes added to increase formations to 12 cars.

The typical 11-car 189 series formation in 1995 was as shown below, with car 1 at the Ueno end.

===Shinkansen &quot;Asama&quot;===
From 1 October 1997, the name &quot;Asama&quot; was used for the services on the newly opened Nagano Shinkansen (absorbed into the Hokuriku Shinkansen from 2015), operating between and .

During the 1998 Winter Olympics in February 1998, additional services were provided using one specially modified 200 series train (set F80), limited to a maximum speed of 210 km/h. Four E4 series double-decker &quot;Max&quot; trains (sets P51/52 and P81/82) were also specially built for seasonal use on the Nagano Shinkansen as &quot;Max Asama&quot; services, but only two (sets P81 and P82) are capable of travelling as far as Nagano because the line west of Karuizawa runs on a 60 Hz power supply, unlike the rest of the line that runs on a 50 Hz power supply.

From the start of the revised timetable on 10 December 2005, &quot;Asama&quot; services were made entirely no-smoking.

The services operated using E2 series eight-car sets (until 31 March 2017) were formed as follows. Car 7 was a &quot;Green&quot; (first class) car. All cars were no-smoking.

From the start of the revised timetable on 15 March 2014, new E7 series 12-car trainsets were introduced on &quot;Asama&quot; services. Initially used on seven return services daily, this number was increased to eleven return services daily from 19 April 2014.

Following the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen extension beyond Nagano to Kanazawa in 2015, the &quot;Asama&quot; name continued to be used for those services operating between Tokyo and Nagano, with some services still operated by 8-car E2 series trains.

The last services operated using eight-car E2 series trainsets ran on 31 March 2017, from which date all &quot;Asama&quot; services were formed of E7 and W7 series trainsets.

<doc id="417377" wikidata="Q6979118" url="?curid=417377" title="National Conservative Convention">
<text>The National Conservative Convention (NCC), is the most senior body of the Conservative Party&#x27;s voluntary wing. The National Convention effectively serves as the Party&#x27;s internal Parliament, and is made up of its 800 highest-ranking Party Officers.

The composition and functions of the NCC have evolved since its establishment in 1867. It has previously had a major role in policy-making and the planning of Party Conferences. Today, its primary purposes are to take charge of internal Party affairs and representing the views of Party members. Most crucially, it elects five members each year to sit on the Conservative Party Board.

==History and structure==
The NCC was first established as the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations. Its purpose was to oversee the running of the Party across the country, and plan Party Conferences. These functions remain largely the same today, and every year the President of the NCC continues to officially open the Party Conference.

Over time, the NUCUA&#x27;s membership became more clearly defined, and has broadly been the same since the Party&#x27;s set of extensive internal reforms following their defeat in the 1945 General Election. In 1998, new Party leader William Hague carried out another extensive reform which led to the NUCUA&#x27;s renaming as the National Conservative Convention. In recent years, the Convention&#x27;s influence over the running of the Party and its campaigning methods has increased heavily. Any changes to the Constitution of the Conservative Party must be approved by a majority vote of the NCC, and it plays a pivotal role in the inception and implementation of Party reforms, such as the Conservative Party Review.

The NCC includes a mix of appointed and directly and indirectly elected Party Officers. When members of the public join the Party, they are attached to the Conservative Association of the constituency they reside in. Party members elect their local Association Chairmen who sit on the Convention, and other local officials. Each Chairman and one Deputy Chairman sit on an Area Council, typically covering one or two Counties and several local authorities and constituencies. These Councils annually elect the Party&#x27;s senior volunteers; Area and Regional Officers. All senior volunteers (approximately 150 Area and 30 Regional Officers) sit on the Convention. In addition to this, the Conservative Women&#x27;s Organisation and Conservative Future (including their predecessor organisations) each send 40 delegates to the NCC, though Conservative Future has not sent delegates since its dissolution.

The NCC meets three times a year; at Conservative Party Conference, the Conservative Spring Forum, and for its own election meeting, usually held in the summer. The Convention Executive (elected annually by its members) consists of its Chairman, who serves for three years, three Vice-Presidents, who each serve for three years, and the President, who serves for one year. Generally speaking, after finishing their term, an outgoing Vice-President is elected as the President and Chairs that year&#x27;s Party Conference. Officers typically run for election for the NCC&#x27;s Executive only after several decades of experience in the Party. The Party Leader and Chairman attend Convention meetings and address its members. There are also regular meetings of Senior Volunteers (Area and Regional Officers) in between full Convention meetings.

<text>Seven ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot;, after the reference to the Navy as the &#x27;bulwark&#x27; (defence) of the country:
* HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; was to have been a 74-gun third rate. She was ordered in 1778 but was cancelled in 1783.
* was a 74-gun third rate launched in 1807. She was previously planned to be called HMS &quot;Scipio&quot;, but was renamed in 1806 before being launched. She took part in the blockade of Rochefort in 1813 and fought in the War of 1812. She was broken up in 1826.
* HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; was to have been an 81-gun screw propelled second rate. She was laid down in 1859, but work was suspended in 1861, and she was eventually cancelled and broken up in 1873.
* HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; was previously the planned 110-gun first rate . She was kept in reserve and was renamed &quot;Bulwark&quot; in 1885 when she became a training ship. She was renamed HMS &quot;Impregnable&quot; in 1886, and then HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; again in 1919. She was sold for breaking up in 1921.
* was a launched in 1899 and blown up by accident in 1914.
* was a light fleet carrier launched in 1948, and commissioned as a fleet carrier in 1954. She was converted to a commando carrier in 1959, recommissioned in that role in January 1960. She was broken up in 1984.

<doc id="417381" wikidata="Q1141142" url="?curid=417381" title="Cross (boxing)">
<text>In boxing, a straight or cross (also commonly called a rear hand punch) are punches usually thrown with the dominant hand 
and are power punches like the uppercut and hook. Compubox, a computerized punch scoring system, counts the straight and cross as power punches.

The Straight/Cross remains one of the most common methods of knockout across combat sports including boxing, kickboxing, and MMA.

==Technique==
From the guard position, the rear hand is thrown from the chin, travelling towards the target in a straight line. The rear shoulder comes forward and finishes touching the outside of the chin. For cover, the lead hand can be retracted and tucked against the face to protect the inside of the chin. For additional power, the torso and hips rotate counterclockwise (for right-hand dominant, and clockwise for left-hand dominant) as the straight/cross is thrown. Weight is also transferred from the rear foot to the lead foot, resulting in the rear heel turning outwards to transfer weight. Body rotation and the sudden weight transfer is what gives the straight/cross its power. 

If it is thrown the instant an opponent leads with the same side hand, the blow crosses over the leading arm, hence its name. If the rear hand instead travels inside the opponent&#x27;s guard, it is a straight. 

It is commonly used to set up a hook. The straight/cross can also follow a jab, creating the classic &quot;one-two combo&quot;. 
A variation of this is a corkscrew punch where it travels in same angle as hook but keep arm fully extended and flick your wrist to first 2 knuckles.

<text>CompuBox is a computerized punches scoring system run by two operators. CompuBox is used in boxing matches around the world.

==Background==
The system is based on a computer program, originally named FightStat, developed by Jon Gibbs in 1984–85 when Gibbs worked with Logan Hobson and Robert Canobbio at Sports Information Data Base (SIDB), of Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey.

Gibbs was the developer of TenniSTAT, the first computer-generated statistics program for tennis, which was used by the US Open, Wimbledon, the Australian Open, and other major tournaments.

At Hobson &amp; Canobbio&#x27;s request, Gibbs wrote the code for FightStat (also called PunchStat in some venues) and was used at Madison Square Garden&#x27;s Felt Forum and in Reno for the 1985 HBO Boxing telecast of the Livingstone Bramble-Ray Mancini rematch for the WBA&#x27;s world Lightweight title. 

After SIDB went bankrupt in 1985, Hobson and Canobbio renamed the program CompuBox and founded CompuBox Inc. Hobson later left the company in 2002.

CompuBox&#x27;s purpose is to settle controversies surrounding fights by counting each punch thrown by each of the fighters, and also each punch landed, to provide fight viewers with a final &quot;punchstat&quot; count and a perception of who should ideally be given the judges&#x27; decision, in the cases where a fight lasts the full distance.

The system calls for two operators. Each operator watches one of the two fighters and has access to four keys, corresponding to jab connect, jab miss, power punch connect, and power punch miss. The operators key in the different punches as they happen, collecting punch counts and hit percentages along the way.

CompuBox is used by HBO, NBC and ESPN. Former world champion Genaro Hernandez was one of the men in charge of operating the system.

<doc id="417385" wikidata="Q3854319" url="?curid=417385" title="Melvin B. Tolson">
<text>Melvin Beaunorus Tolson (February 6, 1898 – August 29, 1966) was an American poet, educator, columnist, and politician. As a poet, he was influenced both by Modernism and the language and experiences of African Americans, and he was deeply influenced by his study of the Harlem Renaissance.

As a debate coach at the historically black Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, Tolson led a team that pioneered interracial college debates against white colleges in the segregated South. This work was depicted in the 2007 biopic &quot;The Great Debaters&quot;, produced by Oprah Winfrey, starring and directed by Denzel Washington as Tolson.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Moberly, Missouri, Tolson was one of four children of Reverend Alonzo Tolson, a Methodist minister, and Lera (Hurt) Tolson, a seamstress. Alonzo Tolson was of mixed race, the son of an enslaved woman and her white master. He served at various churches in the Missouri and Iowa area until settling longer in Kansas City. Reverend Tolson studied throughout his life to add to the limited education he had first received, even taking Latin, Greek and Hebrew by correspondence courses. Both parents emphasized education for their children.

Melvin Tolson graduated from Lincoln High School in Kansas City in 1919. He enrolled at Fisk University, but the following year transferred to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania for financial reasons. He graduated with honors in 1923. He became a Man of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity.

== Marriage and family ==
In 1922, Tolson married Ruth Southall of Charlottesville, Virginia, whom he had met as a student at Lincoln University. Their first child was Melvin Beaunorus Tolson Jr., who, as an adult, became a professor at the University of Oklahoma. He was followed by Arthur Lincoln, who as an adult became a professor at Southern University; Wiley Wilson; and Ruth Marie Tolson. All children were born by 1928.

== Career ==
After graduation, Tolson and his wife moved to Marshall, Texas, where he taught speech and English at Wiley College (1924–1947). The small, historically black Methodist Episcopal college had a high reputation among blacks in the South and Tolson became one of its stars.

In 1930–31, Tolson took a leave of absence from teaching to study for a Master&#x27;s degree at Columbia University. His thesis project, &quot;The Harlem Group of Negro Writers&quot;, was based on his extensive interviews with members of the Harlem Renaissance. His poetry was strongly influenced by his time in New York. He completed his work and was awarded the master&#x27;s degree in 1940.

In addition to teaching English, Tolson used his high energies in several directions at Wiley. He built an award-winning debate team, the Wiley Forensic Society, which became a pioneer in interracial collegiate debates. Beginning in 1930, the team debated against law students from the University of Michigan in Chicago; then, in 1931, the team participated in the first known interracial collegiate debate in the South, against Oklahoma City University. During their tour in 1935, they competed against the University of Southern California, which they defeated. There, Tolson also co-founded the black intercollegiate Southern Association of Dramatic and Speech Arts, and directed the theater club. In addition, he coached the junior varsity football team.

Tolson mentored students such as James Farmer and Heman Sweatt, who later became civil rights activists. He encouraged his students not only to be well-rounded people but also to stand up for their rights. This was a controversial position in the segregated U.S. South of the early and mid-20th century.

In 1947, Tolson began teaching at Langston University, a historically black college in Langston, Oklahoma, where he worked for the next 17 years. He was a dramatist and director of the Dust Bowl Theater at the university. One of his students at Langston was Nathan Hare, the black studies pioneer who became the founding publisher of the journal &quot;The Black Scholar&quot;.

In 1947, Liberia appointed Tolson its Poet Laureate. In 1953, he completed a major epic poem in honor of the nation&#x27;s centennial, the &quot;Libretto for the Republic of Liberia&quot;.

Tolson entered local politics and served three terms as mayor of Langston, Oklahoma, from 1954 to 1960.

In 1947, Tolson was accused of having been active in organizing farm laborers and tenant farmers during the late 1930s (though the nature of his activities is unclear) and of having radical leftist associations.

Tolson was a man of impressive intellect who created poetry that was &quot;funny, witty, humoristic, slapstick, rude, cruel, bitter, and hilarious,&quot; as reviewer Karl Shapiro described the &quot;Harlem Gallery&quot;. The poet Langston Hughes described him as &quot;no highbrow. Students revere him and love him. Kids from the cotton fields like him. Cow punchers understand him ... He&#x27;s a great talker.&quot;

In 1965, Tolson was appointed to a two-year term at Tuskegee Institute, where he was Avalon Poet. He died after cancer surgery in Dallas, Texas, on August 29, 1966. He was buried in Guthrie, Oklahoma.

== Literary works ==
From 1930 on, Tolson began writing poetry. He also wrote two plays by 1937, although he did not continue to work in this genre.

From October 1937 to June 1944, Tolson wrote a column for &quot;The Washington Tribune&quot; that he called &quot;Cabbage and Caviar&quot;; a selection of the columns, in a volume also titled &quot;Caviar and Cabbage&quot;, edited and with an introduction by Robert M. Farnsworth, was published by the University of Missouri Press in 1982.

In 1941, Tolson published his poem &quot;Dark Symphony&quot; in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. Some critics believe it is his greatest work, in which he compared and contrasted African-American and European-American history.

In 1944, Tolson published his first poetry collection, &quot;Rendezvous with America&quot;, which includes &quot;Dark Symphony&quot;. He was especially interested in historic events that had fallen into obscurity.

Tolson&#x27;s &quot;Libretto for the Republic of Liberia&quot; (1953), another major work, is in the form of an epic poem in an eight-part, &quot;rhapsodic&quot; sequence. It is considered a major modernist work.

Tolson&#x27;s final work to appear in his lifetime, the long poem &quot;Harlem Gallery&quot;, was published in 1965. The poem consists of several sections, each beginning with a letter of the Greek alphabet. The poem concentrates on African-American life. It was a striking change from his first works, and was composed in a jazz style, with quick changes and intellectually dense, rich allusions.

In 1979, a collection of Tolson&#x27;s poetry was published posthumously, entitled &quot;A Gallery of Harlem Portraits&quot;. These were poems written during his year in New York, and they represented a mixture of various styles, including short narratives in free verse. This collection was influenced by the loose form of Edgar Lee Masters&#x27; &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;. An urban, racially diverse and culturally rich community is presented in &quot;A Gallery of Harlem Portraits&quot;.

With increasing interest in Tolson and his literary period, in 1999 the University of Virginia published a collection of his poetry entitled &quot;Harlem Gallery and Other Poems of Melvin B. Tolson&quot;, edited by Raymond Nelson.

Tolson&#x27;s papers are housed at the Library of Congress.

* 1924 Constitution of the Soviet Union – adopted 31 January 1924 (&quot;Lenin Constitution&quot;)
* 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union – adopted 5 December 1936 (&quot;Stalin Constitution&quot;)
* 1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union – adopted 7 October 1977 (&quot;Brezhnev Constitution&quot;)

The Constitutions of the Soviet Union were modeled after the 1918 Russian Constitution established by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), the immediate predecessor and a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. These constitutions shared and upheld most basic provisions including the Soviet Union as a socialist state, the leadership of the working class, the forms of social property, and called for a system of soviets (councils) to exercise governmental authority. Soviet constitutions declared certain political rights, such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion, and inline with the state Marxist-Leninist ideology also identified a series of economic and social rights, as well as a set of duties of all citizens. Soviet constitutions established the bodies of the Government of the Soviet Union, outlined democratic rights, and stated the legislature was to be elected at periodical elections. Soviet constitutions became progressively longer and detailed, featuring more articles and provisions which generously expanded the rights and freedoms of the Soviet people including the right to housing and right to work. The 1936 Constitution received amendments in 1944 to allow the Soviet Union&#x27;s constituent republics to be recognized as sovereign states in international law, resulting in the Ukrainian SSR and Byelorussian SSR joining the United Nations General Assembly as founding members in 1945.

The 1924 Constitution and 1936 Constitution were enacted by the Congress of Soviets, the supreme governing body of the Soviet Union since its founding in 1922. The Congress of Soviets dissolved itself upon enactment of the 1936 Constitution, replacing itself as supreme governing body with the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union which later enacted the 1977 Constitution.

The Constitution of the Soviet Union was effectively repealed upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991.

<text>August Wilhelm Antonius Graf Neidhardt von Gneisenau (27 October 176023 August 1831) was a Prussian field marshal. He was a prominent figure in the reform of the Prussian military and the War of Liberation.

==Early life==
Gneisenau was born at Schildau in the Electorate of Saxony. He was the son of a Saxon lieutenant of artillery, August William Neidhardt, and his wife Maria Eva Neidhardt, née Müller. He grew up in great poverty at Schildau, and subsequently at Würzburg and Erfurt. In 1777 he entered the University of Erfurt, but two years later joined an Austrian regiment quartered there. In 1782, taking the additional name of &quot;Gneisenau&quot; from some lost estates of his family in Austria, he entered as an officer the service of the Margrave of Bayreuth-Ansbach. With one of that prince&#x27;s mercenary regiments in British pay, he saw active service and gained valuable experience in the American Revolutionary War. Returning in 1786, he applied for Prussian service, and King Frederick the Great gave him a commission as first lieutenant in the infantry.

Made &quot;Stabskapitän&quot; (&quot;Staff Captain&quot;) in 1790, Gneisenau served in Poland from 1793 to 1794. Ten years of subsequent quiet garrison life in Jauer enabled him to undertake wide-ranging studies of military and political history. In 1796 he married Caroline von Kottwitz.

==Napoleonic Wars==
In 1806 Gneisenau served as one of Prince Hohenlohe&#x27;s staff-officers, fought at Saalfeld (10 October 1806) and Jena (14 October 1806), and a little later commanded a provisional infantry brigade which fought under L&#x27;Estocq in the Lithuanian campaign. Early in 1807, the Prussian Army sent Major von Gneisenau as commandant to Kolberg, which, though small and ill-protected, with the additional assistance of Schill and Nettelbeck succeeded in holding out against Napoleonic forces until the Peace of Tilsit of July 1807. The commandant received the highly prized &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; and promotion to lieutenant-colonel.

A wider sphere of work now opened to Gneisenau. As chief of engineers, and a member of the reorganizing committee, he played a great part, along with Scharnhorst, in the work of reconstructing the Prussian army. Though primarily devoted to the problem of military reorganization, he exercised considerable influence on the general policy of the Ministry (established in December 1808) as well. A colonel in 1809, he soon drew upon himself, by his energy, the suspicion of the dominant French, and soon after the fall of Stein (January 1809), Gneisenau retired. But after visiting Austria, Imperial Russia, Sweden and England on secret missions, he returned to Berlin and resumed his place as a leader of the patriotic party.

Open military work and secret machinations tested his energy and patriotism equally, and after the outbreak of the Wars of Liberation in 1812, Major-General Gneisenau became Blücher&#x27;s quartermaster-general. Thus began the connection between these two soldiers which has furnished military history with one of the best examples of harmonious co-operation between a commander and his chief of staff. With Blücher, Gneisenau served in the capture of Paris in 1814; his military character perfectly complemented Blücher&#x27;s, and under this happy guidance the troops of Prussia, at times defeated but never discouraged, fought their way into the heart of France. The plan for the march on Paris, which led directly to the abdication of Napoleon in April 1814, was specifically the work of the chief of staff. In 1814, as a reward for his distinguished service, Gneisenau — along with Yorck, Kleist, and Bülow — was elevated to the rank of count, while at the same time Blücher became Prince of Wahlstatt.

In 1815, once more chief of Blücher&#x27;s staff, Gneisenau played a very conspicuous part in the Waterloo campaign of June/July 1815. Senior generals such as Yorck and Kleist had been set aside in order that the chief of staff should take command in case of need, and when on the field of Ligny (16 June 1815) the old field marshal was disabled, Gneisenau assumed command of the Prussian army. He rallied the army and directed it towards Wavre, from where part of it marched to join Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, where the flanking attack by the Prussians helped to decide the battle.

On the field of Waterloo, Gneisenau carried out a pursuit that resulted in the capture of Napoleon&#x27;s carriage. In the days following the battle, Gneisenau saw that the Prussian forces reached Paris before Wellington. In reward Gneisenau gained further promotion and the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle.

==Later life==
In 1816 Gneisenau was appointed to command the VIII Prussian Corps, but soon retired from the service, both because of ill health and for political reasons.

For two years Gneisenau lived in retirement at his estate, Erdmannsdorf in Silesia, but in 1818 he became governor of Berlin, as successor to Kalckreuth, and member of the Staatsrath (Council of State). In 1825 he was promoted to general field marshal. In 1831, soon after the outbreak of the Polish insurrection of 1830, he was appointed to the command of the Army of Observation on the Polish frontier, with Clausewitz as his chief of staff. At Posen he was struck down by cholera and died on 24 August 1831, soon followed by his chief of staff, who fell a victim to the same disease in November.

==Honours==
He received the following orders and decorations:
==Legacy==
A statue by Christian Daniel Rauch was erected in Berlin in 1855, and in memory of the siege of 1807, the Kolberg grenadier regiment received his name in 1889. One of his sons led a brigade of the VIII Army Corps in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870.

A painting of him by Marie von Brühl is in the collection of Deutsches Historisches Museum.

One of the four operations of the German Spring Offensive of 1918 was named after him.

Several German navy ships, including the World War I armored cruiser SMS &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, the World War II battleship &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, and a post-war training frigate were named after him.

Additionally, several German cities have streets named &quot;Gneisenaustraße&quot; (Gneisenau Street), including Berlin (which has an U-bahn stop in his name), Leipzig, Hamburg, Hanover and Heidelberg.

<text>The 1924 Constitution of the Soviet Union was the constitution of the Soviet Union adopted on 31 January 1924. According to British historian Archie Brown the constitution was never an accurate guide to political reality in the USSR. For example, the fact that the Communist Party played the leading role in making and enforcing policy was not explicitly mentioned in it until 1977.

==History of the Constitution==

The 1924 Constitution was the first constitution of the Soviet Union and ratified by the Second Congress of Soviets. The 1924 Constitution legitimized the December 1922 Treaty on the Creation of the USSR between the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Byelorussian Soviet Republic, and the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic founding the Soviet Union. In essence, the 1924 Constitution was an expansion and generalization of the 1922 Treaty, with most of the major parts already specified by the treaty, and also allowed for a potential expansion of the Soviet Union. Whereas the original Treaty had only 26 articles, the 1924 Constitution now had 72 divided into eleven chapters. The 1924 Constitution replaced the Russian Constitution of 1918 which served as a precursor and influenced the main principles of the Union-wide constitution.

The 1924 Constitution established the Congress of Soviets to be the supreme body of Soviet state authority, with the Central Executive Committee having this authority during the interims and serving as the country&#x27;s collective presidency. The Central Executive Committee also elected the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, which served as the executive branch of the government. The Central Executive Committee, effectively the legislature, was divided into the Soviet of the Union representing the constituent republics, and the Soviet of Nationalities representing directly the interests of nationality groups. The Presidium supervised the government administration between sessions of the Central Executive Committee.

The 1924 Constitution survived six editions until it was replaced by the 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union on 5 December 1936.

<text>The 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union, also known as the Stalin Constitution, was the constitution of the Soviet Union adopted on 5 December 1936.
The 1936 Constitution was the second constitution of the Soviet Union and replaced the 1924 Constitution, with 5 December being celebrated annually as Soviet Constitution Day from its adoption by the Congress of Soviets. This date was considered the &quot;second foundational moment&quot; of the USSR, after the October Revolution in 1917. The 1936 Constitution redesigned the government of the Soviet Union, expanded all manner of rights and freedoms, and spelled out a number of democratic procedures. The Congress of Soviets replaced itself with the Supreme Soviet, which amended the 1936 Constitution in 1944. 

The 1936 Constitution was the longest surviving constitution of the Soviet Union, and many Eastern Bloc countries later adopted constitutions that were closely modeled on it. It was replaced by the 1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union (&quot;Brezhnev Constitution&quot;) on 7 October 1977.

== Basic provisions ==

The 1936 Constitution repealed restrictions on voting, abolishing the &quot;lishentsy&quot; category of people, and added universal direct suffrage and the right to work to rights guaranteed by the previous constitution. In addition, the 1936 Constitution recognized collective social and economic rights including the rights to work, rest and leisure, health protection, care in old age and sickness, housing, education and cultural benefits. The 1936 Constitution also provided for the direct election of all government bodies and their reorganization into a single, uniform system.

Article 122 states that &quot;women in the U.S.S.R. are accorded equal rights with men in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social and political life.&quot; Specific measures on women included state protection of the interests of mother and child, prematernity and maternity leave with full pay, and the provision of maternity homes, nurseries, and kindergartens.

Article 123 establishes equality of rights for all citizens &quot;irrespective of their nationality or race, in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social, and political life.&quot; Advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness, or hatred or contempt, or restrictions of rights and privileges on account of nationality, were to be punished by law.

== Freedom of religion and speech==
Article 124 of the constitution guaranteed freedom of religion, including separation of (1) church and state, and (2) school from church. The reasoning of the Article 124 is framed in terms of ensuring &quot;to citizens freedom of conscience ... Freedom of religious worship and freedom of anti-religious propaganda is recognized for all citizens.&quot; Stalin included Article 124 in the face of stiff opposition, and it eventually led to rapprochement with the Russian Orthodox Church before and during World War 2. The new constitution re-enfranchised certain religious people who had been specifically disenfranchised under the previous constitution. The article resulted in members of the Russian Orthodox Church petitioning to reopen closed churches, gain access to jobs that had been closed to them as religious figures, and the attempt to run religious candidates in the 1937 elections. 

Article 125 of the constitution guaranteed freedom of speech of the press and freedom of assembly.

== Leading role of Communist Party ==
The 1936 constitution specifically mentioned the role of the ruling All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) for the first time.
Article 126 stated that the Party was the &quot;vanguard of the working people in their struggle to strengthen and develop the socialist system and representing the leading core of all organizations of the working people, both public and state&quot;. This provision was used to justify banning all other parties from functioning in the Soviet Union and legalizing the one-party state.

== Nomenclature changes ==
The 1936 Constitution replaced the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union with the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Unlike its unicameral predecessor, the Supreme Soviet contained two chambers: the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities. The constitution empowered the Supreme Soviet to elect commissars, which performed most of the Supreme Soviet&#x27;s work. The Central Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets was replaced by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet which, much like its predecessor, exercised the full powers of the Supreme Soviet between sessions and had the right to interpret laws. The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet became the titular head of state of the Soviet Union. The Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, known after 1946 as the Council of Ministers, continued to act as the executive arm of the government.

The 1936 Constitution changed the names of all Union Republics, the constituent states of the Soviet Union, transposing the second word &quot;socialist&quot; and third word &quot;soviet&quot; (or equivalent e.g. &quot;radianska&quot; in Ukrainian). Republics were named after the primary nationality and followed by &quot;Soviet Socialist Republic&quot; (SSR), except for the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). 

The Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, one of the four republics to sign the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, was dissolved and its constituent republics, the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic and Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic, were elevated to union republics individually.

== Drafting ==
The 1936 Constitution was written by a special commission of 31 members which General Secretary Joseph Stalin chaired. Those who participated included (among others) Andrey Vyshinsky, Andrei Zhdanov, Maxim Litvinov, Kliment Voroshilov, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Nikolai Bukharin, and Karl Radek, though the latter two had less active input.

== Soviet reactions ==
The 1936 Constitution enumerated economic rights not included in constitutions in the Western democracies. The constitution was presented as a personal triumph for Stalin, who on this occasion was described by &quot;Pravda&quot; as &quot;genius of the new world, the wisest man of the epoch, the great leader of communism&quot;. 

According to J. Arch Getty, &quot;Many who lauded Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union as the most democratic country on earth lived to regret their words. After all, the Soviet Constitution of 1936 was adopted on the eve of the Great Terror of the late 1930s; the &quot;thoroughly democratic&quot; elections to the first Supreme Soviet permitted only uncontested candidates and took place at the height of the savage violence in 1937. The civil rights, personal freedoms, and democratic forms promised in the Stalin constitution were trampled almost immediately and remained dead letters until long after Stalin&#x27;s death.&quot;

== 1944 amendments ==
The 1944 amendments to the 1936 Constitution established separate branches of the Red Army for each Soviet Republic, and also established Republic-level commissariats for foreign affairs and defense, allowing them to be recognized as sovereign states in international law. This allowed for two Soviet Republics, Ukraine and Byelorussia, to join the United Nations General Assembly as founding members in 1945.

== Criticism ==
Some historical figures have seen the constitution as a propaganda document. Leonard Schapiro, for example, wrote in 1971: &quot;The decision to alter the electoral system from indirect to direct election, from a limited to a universal franchise, and from open to secret voting, was a measure of the confidence of the party in its ability to ensure the return of candidates of its own choice without the restrictions formerly considered necessary&quot;; and that &quot;a careful scrutiny of the draft of the new constitution showed that it left the party&#x27;s supreme position unimpaired, and was therefore worthless as a guarantee of individual rights&quot;. Isaac Deutscher called it &quot;a veil of liberal phrases and premises over the guillotine in the background&quot;. Hannah Arendt observed that it was hailed as the ending of the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;revolutionary period&quot;, but was immediately followed by the country&#x27;s most intense purges in its history, the Great Purge in which many of the constitution&#x27;s organizers and draftees — such as Yakov Yakovlev, Aleksei Stetskii, Boris Markovich Tal&#x27;, Vlas Chubar, Karl Radek, Nikolai Bukharin, and Ivan Akulov — were imprisoned or executed as counterrevolutionaries shortly after their work was complete.

<doc id="417402" wikidata="Q903847" url="?curid=417402" title="Willow flycatcher">
<text>The willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii) is a small insect-eating, neotropical migrant bird of the tyrant flycatcher family native to North America.

== Taxonomy ==
There are four subspecies recognized, all of which breed in North America (including three subspecies that breed in California). At one time, this bird and the alder flycatcher (&quot;Empidonax alnorum&quot;) were considered to be a single species, Traill&#x27;s flycatcher. Their song is the only reliable method to tell them apart in the field. The binomial commemorates the Scottish zoologist Thomas Stewart Traill.

=== Subspecies ===
The subspecies are best distinguished from each other by their songs. In addition, the four subspecies have significant genetic differences based on mitochondrial DNA analysis. Their winter ranges have been elucidated using mitochondrial DNA genetic studies of 172 birds sampled in winter combined with plumage coloration and morphological differences.

The four subspecies of the willow flycatcher are:

==== &quot;E. t. brewsteri&quot; – Little willow flycatcher ====
The little willow flycatcher (&quot;E.t. brewsteri&quot;) is the Pacific Slope subspecies of the willow flycatcher. Described by Oberholser in 1918, it breeds in California from Tulare County north along the western side of the Sierra Nevada, and in Oregon and Washington west of the Cascade range.

==== &quot;E. t. adastus&quot; ====
The Great Basin/Northern Rockies subspecies of the willow flycatcher (&quot;E. t. adastus&quot;) breeds in California east of the Sierra/Cascade axis, from the Oregon border into Modoc County and possibly into northern Inyo County. Populations at high elevation just east of the Sierra Nevada crest but south of Modoc County are assumed to be &quot;E. t. brewsteri&quot;. There has been very little study of &quot;E. t. adastus&quot; in California. It was described by Oberholser in 1932.

==== &quot;E. t. extimus&quot; – Southwestern willow flycatcher ====
The southwestern willow flycatcher (&quot;E. t. extimus&quot;) is a federally endangered subspecies found in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah. It was listed in 1995, when it was known to breed at only about 75 sites in riparian areas throughout the American southwest. The breeding population was estimated at between 300 and 500 pairs. Breeding occurs from near sea level on the Santa Margarita River to at the South Fork Kern River and at upper San Luis Rey River in California and to over in Arizona, southwestern Colorado, and north-central New Mexico. This subspecies was described by A.R. Phillips in 1948.

The largest remaining population in California is on the South Fork Kern River, Kern County. In southern California, this subspecies breeds on the San Luis Rey River, at Camp Pendleton, the Santa Margarita River and Pilgrim, De Luz, French, and Las Flores creeks; as well as on the Santa Ynez River. In 1996, breeding was confirmed along the Arizona side of the lower Colorado River at Lake Mead Delta and at Topock Marsh. Examination of museum specimens of 578 migrating and wintering &quot;E. t. extimus&quot; indicate that Guatemala to Costa Rica constitutes the main winter range. 

This species is experiencing population declines throughout the Southwest due to habitat loss/alteration and invasive grass species. One of these is saltcedar (&quot;Tamarix ramosissima),&quot; found throughout the Southwest, where it has replaced essential vegetation by outcompeting native species in riparian areas where the southwestern willow flycatcher is found. In two sites, one in Arizona and the other in New Mexico, native trees were able to replace patches of saltcedar and populations of willow flycatchers increased. In these sites 90% of the willow flycatcher&#x27;s nests were found in native vegetation, only 10% were in mixed vegetation (native species and saltcedar) and few were in areas dominated by saltcedar. However, because willow flycatchers can and do breed in some locations within saltcedar habitat, it occasionally serves as vital habitat in the recovery of this species.

The San Pedro River Preserve was purchased by the Nature Conservancy to preserve habitat for this subspecies. NatureServe considers the subspecies &quot;Imperiled.&quot; North American beavers (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) are thought to play a critical role in widening riparian width, openings in dense vegetation, and retention of surface water through the willow flycatcher breeding season.

==== &quot;E. t. traillii&quot; ====
The eastern nominate subspecies of the willow flycatcher (&quot;E. t. traillii&quot;) was described by Audubon in 1828. It breeds from the eastern coast of the United States to the western Rocky Mountains.

==Description==
Adults have brown-olive upperparts, darker on the wings and tail, with whitish underparts; they have an indistinct white eye ring, white wing bars and a small bill. The breast is washed with olive-gray. The upper part of the bill is gray; the lower part is orangish. 

== Distribution and habitat ==
Their breeding habitat is deciduous thickets, especially willows and often near water, across the United States and southern Canada. They make a cup nest in a vertical fork in a shrub or tree.

These neotropical birds migrate to Mexico and Central America, and in small numbers as far south as Ecuador in South America, often selecting winter habitat near water. Willow flycatchers travel approximately each way between wintering and breeding areas.

This bird&#x27;s song is a sneezed &quot;fitz-bew&quot;. The call is a dry &quot;whit&quot;.

== Food resources ==
Willow flycatchers are generalist insectivores, and the insects which comprise their diet vary substantially across different habitats. For example, flies of the order &quot;Diptera&quot; made up the majority of adult willow flycatcher diets in Ontario, Canada, but only composed 10.6% of the diet of California flycatchers, who instead favor &quot;Lepidopterans,&quot; mayflies, and snakeflies. They are &quot;sit-and-wait&quot; predators, remaining on a perch near the top of a shrub and flying out to catch insects on the wing, but are also reported to glean insects off of leaves and stems.

<text>The 1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union, officially the Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, was adopted on 7 October 1977.
The 1977 Constitution, also known as the &quot;Brezhnev Constitution&quot; or the &quot;Constitution of Developed Socialism&quot;, was the third and final constitution of the Soviet Union, adopted unanimously at the 7th (Special) Session of the Ninth Convocation of the Supreme Soviet and signed by Chairman of the Presidium Leonid Brezhnev. The 1977 Constitution replaced the 1936 Constitution and the Soviet public holiday of USSR Constitution Day was shifted from 5 December to 7 October.

The 1977 Constitution&#x27;s preamble stated that &quot;the aims of the dictatorship of the proletariat having been fulfilled, the Soviet state has become the state of the whole people&quot; and no longer represented the workers and peasants alone. The 1977 Constitution extended the scope of the constitutional regulation of society compared to the 1924 and 1936 constitutions. The first chapter defined the leading role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and established the organizational principles for the state and the government. &quot;Article 1&quot; defines the USSR as a socialist state, as did all previous constitutions:
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a socialist state of the whole people, expressing the will and interests of the workers, peasants, and intelligentsia, the working people of all the nations and nationalities of the country.

The 1977 Constitution was long and detailed, including twenty-eight more articles than the 1936 Soviet Constitution and explicitly defined the division of responsibilities between the Central Government in Moscow and the governments of the republics. Later chapters established principles for economic management and cultural relations. The 1977 Constitution included Article 72, which granted the official right of constituent republics to secede from the Soviet Union promised in previous constitutions. However, Articles 74 and 75 stated that when a Soviet constituency introduced laws in contradiction to Supreme Soviet, the laws of the Supreme Soviet would supersede any legal difference, but the Union law which regulated the secession was not provided until the last days of the Soviet Union. 
Article 74. The laws of the USSR shall have the same force in all Union Republics. In the event of a discrepancy between a Union Republic law and an All-Union law, the law of the USSR shall prevail.
Article 75. The territory of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a single entity and comprises the territories of the Union Republics. The sovereignty of the USSR extends throughout its territory.

The 1977 Constitution was repealed upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991 and the post-Soviet states adopted new constitutions. Article 72 would play an important role in the dissolution despite the lacuna in the Soviet law, which was eventually filled under the pressure from the Republics in 1990.

==Amendment process==

Adoption of the Constitution was a legislative act of the Supreme Soviet. Amendments to the Constitution were likewise adopted by legislative act of that body. Amendments required the approval of a two-thirds majority of the deputies of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies and could be initiated by the congress itself; the Supreme Soviet, acting through its commissions and committees; the Presidium or chairman of the Supreme Soviet; the Constitutional Oversight Committee; the Council of Ministers; republic soviets; the Committee of People&#x27;s Control; the Supreme Court; the Procuracy; and the chief state arbiter. In addition, the governing bodies of official organizations and even the Academy of Sciences could initiate amendments and other legislation.

The principal source of uncensored information and comment in the USSR noted in August 1977 that the proposed Constitution &quot;has given rise to a number of letters containing serious comments and well-argued proposals. Although these letters were sent to the Constitution Commission, not one of them was even mentioned in the Soviet newspapers or official media,&quot; it is quite possible that, like the letters department of all major Soviet periodicals, some note was privately taken of these views.

Soviet constitutions were frequently amended and had been changed more often than the constitutions of most Western countries. Nevertheless, the 1977 Constitution attempted to avoid frequent amendment by establishing regulations for government bodies (especially the lists of ministries, state commissions, and other bodies in the 1936 constitution) in separate, but equally authoritative, enabling legislation, such as the Law on the Council of Ministers of 5 July 1978. Other enabling legislation has included a law on citizenship, a law on elections to the Supreme Soviet, a law on the status of Supreme Soviet deputies, regulations for the Supreme Soviet, a resolution on commissions, regulations on local government, and laws on the Supreme Court and the Procuracy. The enabling legislation provided the specific and changing operating rules for these government bodies.

==Amendments to the 1977 Constitution==
In October 1988, draft amendments and additions to the 1977 Constitution were published in the Soviet media for public discussion. Following the public review process, the Supreme Soviet adopted the amendments and additions in December 1988. The amendments and additions substantially and fundamentally changed the electoral and political systems. Although Soviet officials touted the changes as a return to &quot;Leninist&quot; forms and functions, citing that the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies had antecedents in the Congress of Soviets, they were unprecedented in many respects. The position of chairman of the Supreme Soviet was formally designated and given specific powers, particularly leadership over the legislative agenda, the ability to issue orders (rasporiazheniia), and formal power to conduct negotiations and sign treaties with foreign governments and international organizations. Later still, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet&#x27;s non-legislative powers would be transferred to the newly created office of President. The Constitutional Oversight Committee, composed of people who were not in the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies, was established and given formal power to review the constitutionality of laws and normative acts of the central and republican governments and to suggest their suspension and repeal. The electoral process was constitutionally opened up to multiple candidacies, although not multi-party candidacies. A legislative body—the Supreme Soviet—was to convene for regular spring and fall sessions, each lasting three to four months. Unlike the old Supreme Soviet, however, the new Supreme Soviet was indirectly elected by the population, being elected from among the members of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies.

==Constitutional rights==
The Soviet Constitution included a series of civil and political rights. Among these were the rights to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly and the right to religious belief and worship. In addition, the Constitution provided for freedom of artistic work, protection of the family, inviolability of the person and home, and the right to privacy. In line with the Marxist-Leninist ideology of the government, the Constitution also granted social and economic rights not provided by constitutions in some capitalist countries. Among these were the rights to work, rest and leisure, health protection, care in old age and sickness, housing, education, and cultural benefits.

Unlike Western constitutions, the Soviet Constitution outlined limitations on political rights, whereas in capitalist countries these limitations are usually left up to the legislative and/or judicial institutions. Article 6 effectively eliminated partisan opposition and division within government by granting to the CPSU the power to lead and guide society. Article 39 enabled the government to prohibit any activities it considered detrimental by stating that &quot;Enjoyment of the rights and freedoms of citizens must not be to the detriment of the interests of society or the state.&quot; Article 59 obliged citizens to obey the laws and comply with the standards of socialist society as determined by the Party. The government did not treat as inalienable those political and socioeconomic rights the Constitution granted to the people. Citizens enjoyed rights only when the exercise of those rights did not interfere with the interests of the state, and the CPSU alone had the power and authority to determine policies for the government and society. For example, the right to freedom of expression stipulated in Article 52 could be suspended if the exercise of that freedom failed to be in accord with Party policies. Until the era of &quot;glasnost&quot;, freedom of expression did not entail the right to criticize the government. The constitution did provide a &quot;freedom of conscience, that is, the right to profess or not to profess any religion, and to conduct religious worship or atheistic propaganda.&quot; It prohibited incitement of hatred or hostility on religious grounds.

The Constitution also failed to provide political and judicial mechanisms for the protection of rights. Thus, the Constitution lacked explicit guarantees protecting the rights of the people. In fact, the Supreme Soviet never introduced amendments specifically designed to protect human rights. Neither did the people have a higher authority within the government to which to appeal when their rights were violated. Unlike in a democratic system, there was no constitutional court with the power to ensure that constitutional rights were observed by legislation or were respected by the rest of the government. The Soviet Union also signed the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (Helsinki Accords), which mandated that internationally recognized human rights be respected in the signatory countries, yet it was not until the late 1980s that realigning constitutional and domestic law with international commitments on human rights was publicly debated.

==Role of the citizen==
Article 59 of the Constitution stated that citizens&#x27; exercise of their rights was inseparable from performance of their duties. Articles 60 through 69 defined these duties. Citizens were required to work and to observe labor discipline. The legal code declared evasion of work to be a crime of &quot;parasitism&quot; and provided punishment for it. The Constitution also obliged citizens to protect socialist property and oppose corruption. All citizens performed military service as a duty to safeguard and &quot;enhance the power and prestige of the Soviet state.&quot; Violation of this duty was considered &quot;a betrayal of the Motherland and the gravest of crimes&quot;. Finally, the Constitution required parents to train their children for socially useful work and to raise them to be worthy members of the socialist society.

The Constitution and other legislation protected and enforced Soviet citizenship. Legislation on citizenship granted equal rights of citizenship to naturalized citizens as well as to the native born. Laws also specified that citizens could not freely renounce their citizenship. Citizens were required to apply for permission to do so from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, which could reject the application if the applicant had not completed military service, had judicial duties, or was responsible for family dependants. In addition, the Presidium could refuse the application to protect national security, or revoke citizenship for defamation of the Soviet Union or for acts damaging to national prestige or security.

<doc id="417404" wikidata="Q81526" url="?curid=417404" title="Flag of Andorra">
<text>The national flag of Andorra () features a vertical tricolour of blue, yellow, and red with the coat of arms of Andorra in the center. Although the three vertical bars may at first appear to be of equal width, the centre yellow bar is slightly wider than the other two so that the ratio of bar widths is 8:9:8 with an overall flag ratio of 7:10.

A civilian variant of the flag is said to have been created in 1866, although the design was standardized in 1993 after Andorra joined the United Nations.

==Origins and symbolism==
The design is related to the flags of Catalonia, Foix and France, the lands historically linked with the small country. The coat of arms of Andorra in the center of the flag contains historical symbolism to the Catholic bishop of Urgell, the Count of Foix, the Principality of Catalonia, and the Viscounty of Béarn. The inclusion of the coat of arms makes it one of 28 national flags to contain overtly Christian symbolism and it is the only national flag to portray cattle, except for the flag of Moldova, which is visually similar and features the head of a bull. A flag of three bars is similar to that of the French tricolor, while the pattern of a wider middle stripe can be noted on the Spanish flag. The motto in the coat of arms (written in Goudy Old Style) in the middle stripe means &quot;Virtue United is Stronger&quot;. The blue and red of the Andorran flag are also found on the French flag, with red and yellow also being the colors of the Catalonian flag (as the old royal symbol of the Crown of Aragon) and the arms of the old County of Foix (currently part of France).

==Description==
===Colors===

The official colors of the Andorran flag are set out in the &quot;Graphic regulations for reproducing the shield and flag&quot; from the Oficina de Marques del Principat d&#x27;Andorra and approved by the government of Andorra on May 5, 1999. The colors of the flag are:

== History ==

===Pre-1806===
During the Middle Ages, The Arabs of Muslim Spain, which occupied the territory in 714, did held white and black banners. after the establishment of The County of Urgell, claiming to be the last independent survivor of The Marca Hispanica, established by Charlemagne, Urgell held a checkered banner of black and gold by 988. Urgell made a condominium in the territory with The County of Foix in 1278 (being occupied by The Crown of Aragon in 1396 and 1512 and later The Principality of Catalonia in 1413), later to The Kingdom of Navarre in 1479 and finally with The Kingdom of France in 1620. the flags of those countries flew in Andorra during the times of the condominium. after the condominium was abolished during The French Revolution, Urgell became part of France (using the French Tricolor in Andorra), until 1806, when Andorra gained autonomy and its Co-Principate reestablished in 1809 (only gaining independence in 1814, after The Napoleonic Wars).

===First flag===
The historical flag of Andorra, which was used from 1806 to 1866, featured two equally sized red and yellow vertical (sometimes horizontal) bands. It is claimed that this flag was granted by Napoleon in 1806 but use of the flag may go back to much earlier. Red and yellow are the traditional colors of the lands adjacent to the Pyrenees, such as Foix, Roussillon, Toulouse and Crown of Aragon.

===Second flag===

A variant of the modern flag without the coat of arms is said to have been designed by Napoleon III, adding a blue stripe representing France (because colours of the old flag started to resemble too much only the new flag of Spain). The adoption of the new flag coincided with the New Reform led by Guillem d&#x27;Areny-Plandolit, who may be the real creator of the flag. The package of reforms, which included a new flag, was first adopted by the Episcopal Co-Prince, Bishop Josep Caixal i Estradé on April 22, 1866 and three years later by Napoleon III. The flag from this period remains the official civil flag today, but due to its similarity to other national flags it is rarely used.

===Third flag===
The circumstances surrounding the introduction of the horizontal version of the flag are unknown. It is also unknown whether this was the only version at that time. In his 1898 book &quot;Through the High Pyrenees&quot; by Harold Spender he wrote:

:&quot;We were not fortunate enough to see the Andorran Council General in session, any more than we witnessed the fetes and dances which were seen by M. Vuillier on the occasion of the Feast of St. Etienne. During the session the Andorran flag—with three horizontal lines of blue, yellow, and red, and a crown in the centre— hangs out of the window. A description of the meeting of the Council has been given by M. Vidal...&quot;

Horizontal flags were used until the end of the 1930s, in the meantime, the Spanish flag was changed to a similar one. The flag with crown is sometimes associated with the activities of Boris I, but there is no evidence for this.

===Later flags===
Around 1939, the vertical arrangement was returned and a coat of arms was added. The yellow lane was probably widened later. Until the introduction of an official, standardized design in the Constitution of April 28, 1993, the flag variants differed from each other. An additional impulse to unify the flag were the plans to join the United Nations, which took place on 28 July 1993.

<doc id="417407" wikidata="Q124329" url="?curid=417407" title="Flag of Angola">
<text>The national flag of Angola is a horizontal bicolour of red and black, charged in the center with a yellow emblem consisting of a machete crossed by a half-cogwheel and crowned with a five-pointed star. It was adopted on 11 November 1975, when Angola became independent from Portugal following the thirteen-year Angolan War of Independence. The original meanings of the flag&#x27;s colours and symbols accordingly referenced the war and colonial period, but they have since been reinterpreted to represent the Angolan people and society more broadly.

The flag&#x27;s design is outlined in the Constitution of Angola, and regulations regarding its use are outlined in section 2.1 of the Angolan government&#x27;s manual of graphic and protocol standards for national symbols. Henrique de Carvalho Santos is credited with designing the national flag, which is based on the flag of the MPLA (People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola), the country&#x27;s ruling party since independence.

== Design and symbolism ==
Annex I of the Angolan constitution outlines the design of the flag and gives its colours and symbols significance. The flag is a horizontal bicolour consisting of a red upper band and a black lower band. Black represents Africa, while red represents the blood shed by Angolans during the colonial period, the war of independence and in defence of the country. The flag is charged in the center with a machete crossed by a half-cogwheel and crowned with a five-pointed star. The machete represents peasants and agriculture, the half-cogwheel represents workers and industry, and the star represents international solidarity and progress. The charge is yellow, which symbolises the wealth of Angola. In the original constitution of 1975, &quot;defence of the country&quot; was &quot;revolution&quot;, and &quot;international solidarity&quot; was &quot;internationalism&quot;. American vexillologist Whitney Smith notes that the Angolan flag&#x27;s charge is similar to the star, hammer and sickle of the Soviet flag.

=== Construction ===
Parameters in which the flag should be constructed are specified in section 2.1 of the Angolan government&#x27;s manual of graphic and protocol standards for national symbols. The position and size of the emblem and bands should match the construction sheet shown in the manual; any other arrangement is considered a distortion, alteration or misrepresentation. The manual outlines standard dimensions for physical flags, but any dimensions are acceptable as long as the width-to-length ratio is 2:3. The manual also specifies the particular shades of the flag&#x27;s colours: Angola red, Angola yellow and process black.


== Protocol ==
The Angolan flag is protected under Angolan law; improper use or handling of the flag is considered a criminal offence. Section 2.1 of the Angolan government&#x27;s manual on protocol standards for national symbols outlines regulations regarding the display and handling of the flag.

Any institution or individual may fly the flag as long as they properly observe the procedures and protocols outlined in the manual. Public institutions should fly the flag outside their respective headquarters. In general, the flag should be raised on Sundays, public holidays and days when official ceremonies or observances are held. The Angolan president, National Assembly and courts may order the flag to be raised on any other day. Government institutions should raise the flag outside of their headquarters daily. The flag must remain hoisted from 9 a.m. until sunset and, when flown at night, be illuminated by projectors if possible. During periods of national mourning, the national flag and any other flags flown alongside it should also be lowered to half-mast. The flag must be raised to the end of the flagpole before it is lowered to half-mast; the same procedure is followed when lowering the flag from half-mast. On flagpoles with lintels, the flag should be hoisted at the top of the flagpole or on the right side if the top has not been prepared for use.

The national flag should be displayed more prominently than other flags of the state and foreign flags. The national flag should not be smaller than flags displayed alongside it. When there are two flagpoles, the national flag occupies the left flagpole from the perspective of the observer. When there are three flagpoles, the national flag occupies the middle one. When there are more than three flagpoles inside a building, the national flag occupies the center one for odd numbers and the first left-of-center one for even numbers. When there are more than three flagpoles outdoors, the national flag occupies the first flagpole on the left, follow by all other flags to the right. If there are multiple flagpoles of differing heights, the national flag should be flown on the tallest one. The tallest flagpole must also be positioned in accordance with the other regulations related to the display of the national flag. The Angolan government may make exceptions to these requirements if the national flag is flown by an international organisation or at an international meeting on Angolan soil. In general, flagpoles should be &quot;placed in an honourable place on the ground, on building facades, or at the top of a building.

In digital representations, the flag&#x27;s legibility and contrast should be maximised when displaying it on a solid colour background or in the foreground of a photograph. To this end, the manual recommends a border around the flag with a width equal to twice the diameter of the star on the flag.

== Presidential standard ==
The standard of the president of Angola is a red field charged in the center with the same emblem on the national flag, albeit with two yellow olive branches below it. As with the national flag, the colours are Angola red and Angola yellow. The width-to-length ratio is 2:3.

The presidential standard indicates the presence of the Angolan president. It is always present in the presidential palace, which serves as the president&#x27;s official residence. It is also displayed on the official presidential vehicle at a reduced size. The presidential standard must always be displayed next to the national flag.

== History ==

=== Adoption ===
Angola flew the flag of Portugal during the Portuguese colonial period. The Angolan War of Independence (1961–1974) was ended by the success of the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, which saw the installation of a military council in favour of decolonisation. was appointed to oversee Angola&#x27;s transition to independence. At noon on 10 November 1975, the Portuguese flag was lowered in the capital Luanda, and Cardoso departed for Portugal with the remaining Portuguese colonial officials and soldiers. Before leaving, Cardoso transferred sovereignty over Angola to the Angolan people, instead of a particular movement. The MPLA (People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola), one of several groups that fought in the war, proclaimed the independence of the People&#x27;s Republic of Angola the following midnight, on 11 November. During the proclamation ceremony, a new national flag based on the MPLA&#x27;s flag was raised. According to senior MPLA member Hermínio Escórcio, fellow cadre Henrique de Carvalho Santos (Henrique Onambwé) was responsible for the design, and the first physical flag was created by two other cadres named Joaquina and Cici.

Parts of the country, however, remained under the control of other independence movements, notably UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), which was opposed to the MPLA and proclaimed the rival Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Angola the same day. The Portuguese flag was likewise lowered in UNITA&#x27;s capital of Huambo, but the UNITA flag was raised in its place rather than the flag chosen by the MPLA. UNITA continued flying its own flag in territory it controlled throughout the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002).

=== 2003 flag change proposal ===
The Angolan Civil War ended in 2002 with a ceasefire and the disarmament of UNITA troops. The war&#x27;s end brought about the prospect of adopting new national symbols, which was debated by deputies of the newly established constitutional commission of the National Assembly. A public competition was held, and a proposal submitted under the pseudonym Catica was selected as the winning design. Catica was to be awarded with a medal and US$20,000 in Angolan kwanza. However, the proposed flag was not adopted amid public disagreements about the change. The state-run Angola Press News Agency reported concerns about losing the existing flag&#x27;s independence-related symbolism and its similarities to other national flags. In contrast, the agency also reported support from opposition deputies of UNITA and the PLD, who considered the design politically neutral.

The proposed flag consisted of a horizontal red strip bordered above and below by a thin white strip and a broad blue strip. It was charged in the center with a yellow sun consisting of three concentric circles and fifteen rays. The sun&#x27;s design was based on ancient rock paintings located in the Tchitundu-Hulu historical site of Namibe Province. The flag&#x27;s width-to-length ratio was 2:3. Ana Maria de Oliveira, the MPLA deputy who was responsible for coordinating the subcommission for the national symbols, explained the flag&#x27;s significance: &quot;The blue strips represent freedom, justice and solidarity, whereas the white ones stand for peace, unity and harmony. The red strip represents sacrifice, tenacity and heroism, whereas the sun represents the historical and cultural identity and riches of Angola.&quot;

== &quot;Bandeira-Monumento&quot; ==
The Fortress of São Miguel, which houses Angola&#x27;s Museum of the Armed Forces, is the location of a flag named the (). It measures and is the largest physical flag of Angola. On certain dates, it is hoisted on a -tall flagpole weighing 20 tonnes, which rests on a reinforced concrete base in diameter. It was hoisted for the first time on 4 April 2013, in a ceremony presided by then president José Eduardo dos Santos. The flag and its flagpole can withstand winds of up to .

<text>Kufstein (; Central Bavarian: &quot;Kufstoa&quot;) is a town in the Austrian state of Tyrol, the administrative seat of Kufstein District. With a population of about 20,000 it is the second largest Tyrolean town after the state capital Innsbruck. The greatest landmark is Kufstein Fortress, first mentioned in the 13th century. The town was the place of origin of the Austrian noble family Kuefstein.

==Geography==

It is located in the Tyrolean Unterland region on the river Inn, at the confluence with its Weißache and Kaiserbach tributaries, near the border with Bavaria, Germany. The municipal area stretches along the Lower Inn Valley between the Brandenberg Alps in the northwest and the Kaiser Mountains in the southeast. The remote Kaisertal until recently was the last settled valley in Austria without transport connections, prior to the completion of a tunnel road from Kufstein to neighbouring Ebbs in 2008. North of the town, the Inn river leaves the Northern Limestone Alps and enters the Bavarian Alpine Foreland. The town area comprises several small lakes, such as Pfrillsee, Längsee, and Hechtsee; Egelsee and Maistaller Lacke are protected nature reserves.

The municipal arrangement comprises the cadastral communities of Kufstein, Morsbach and Thierberg; the town itself is divided into five quarters (Zentrum, Sparchen, Weissach, Endach, and Zell). 

==Economy==
Glass manufacturer Riedel, haulage contractor LKW Walter, gunmaker Voere, and textile mat manufacturer Kleen-Tex are based in Kufstein.

Kufstein is also home to the University of Applied Sciences Kufstein which specializes in providing business education and is a center for international exchange.

==Transport==

Kufstein has two exits along the A12 motorway (autobahn) from Innsbruck to Rosenheim.

Kufstein railway station, opened in 1876, forms part of the Lower Inn Valley railway section of the Brenner-axis from Munich to Verona.

The Festungsbahn is a funicular that links the city center with the Kufstein Fortress

==History==
Archaeological findings in the Tischofer Cave in Kaisertal denote a settlement of the area more than 30,000 years ago, the oldest traces of human habitation in Tyrol. Incorporated into the Roman Empire in 15 BC, the Inn river formed the border between the Roman provinces of &quot;Raetia&quot; and &quot;Noricum&quot;.

A church at &quot;Caofstein&quot; was first mentioned in a 788 deed issued by Bishop Arno of Salzburg. At that time, the Lower Inn Valley was part of the Bavarian realm under the Agilolfing duke Tassilo III, who was deposed by Charlemagne and replaced by Prefect Gerold. The Fortress is first documented in 1205 as a possession of the Bishop of Regensburg and the Duke of Bavaria.

In the early 14th century, the Wittelsbach emperor Louis IV, also Bavarian duke, vested the Kufstein citizens with rights of jurisdiction. Kufstein passed to the County of Tyrol in 1342, when it was a wedding gift to Countess Margaret from her husband, Emperor Louis&#x27;s son Louis the Brandenburger. However, it fell back to Bavaria upon Margaret&#x27;s death in 1369. Duke Stephen III of Bavaria granted Kufstein city status in 1393, due to its prominence as a trading and docking point on the Inn River. From 1415 onwards, his son and successor Duke Louis VII had the Fortress largely rebuilt and expanded.The possession of the strategically important Kufstein border fortress remained disputed. In 1504, the Habsburg emperor Maximilian I took the opportunity of the War of the Succession of Landshut within the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty: his Austrian forces laid siege to the town, and at the Imperial Diet in Cologne the next year, the emperor resolved upon the cession of the Kufstein territories to the Habsburg lands of Tyrol. Maximilian had the prominent &quot;Kaiserturm&quot; tower of the fortress erected, which was finished in 1522.
During the War of the Spanish Succession, the castle was again besieged by Bavarian troops under Elector Maximilian II Emanuel in 1703, nevertheless the Austrian domains were confirmed by the Treaty of Ilbersheim the next year. After the War of the Third Coalition, Kufstein once again was awarded to the newly established Kingdom of Bavaria in the 1805 Peace of Pressburg and the Tyrolean Rebellion of 1809 was crushed by the Bavarian Army. Finally in 1813/14 it passed to the Austrian Empire.

In the 19th century, Kufstein Fortress was turned into a bastille for political prisoners, such as the Hungarian outlaw Sándor Rózsa, who spent several years here before he was finally pardoned in 1868. The town&#x27;s economic development was decisively promoted by the opening of the Lower Inn Valley Railway line in 1858.

In the late days of World War II the historic town centre suffered from Allied bombing. After the war, Kufstein was occupied by French and US forces; it was the site of a French sector United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Displaced Persons camp.

== Sights ==



Due to its long history, the city of Kufstein has various sights to offer:

*The Fortress (&quot;Festung&quot;) is built on a rock the height of which amounts to . Sometimes erroneously called &quot;Schloss Garoldseck&quot;, the fortress was mentioned as &quot;Castrum Caofstein&quot; in a document for the first time in 1205. It was enlarged several times. The most important tower, the round and impressive &quot;Kaiserturm&quot;, was built from 1518 to 1522. Several times in its history, the fortress was used as a prison. Today it is famous for its large organ (&quot;Heldenorgel&quot;).
*The old city center (&quot;Altstadt&quot;) with several picturesque lanes the most famous of which is &quot;Römerhofgasse&quot;.
*The sightworthy City Hall (&quot;Rathaus&quot;) is on a square called &quot;Stadtplatz&quot;.
*Saint Vitus Church is the oldest church of Kufstein. It was built from 1390 to 1420 in a typical Gothic style. Later, it was converted into a baroque church from 1660 to 1661.
*A part of the medieval city wall is well preserved and worth a visit. The sightworthy &quot;Wasserbastei&quot; is in the Northern part of the old city center on the river Inn. In the Southern part of the wall, a former gate called &quot;Auracher Löchl&quot; can be seen.

<text>The national flag of Anguilla, a British overseas territory, consists of a Blue Ensign with the British flag in the canton, charged with the coat of arms of Anguilla in the fly. The coat of arms consists of three dolphins in a circular formation, which were featured on the earlier Anguilla flag, and which stand for friendship, wisdom and strength. The white in the background stands for peace, and the light blue represents the sea, as well as faith, youth, and hope.

The flag is Anguilla&#x27;s third flag other than as part of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla. The island&#x27;s first flag was a red flag featuring the name of the island in yellow and two mermaids inside a blue oval. Variants to this flag were also widely used, with some substituting red for purple and some not bearing the name of Anguilla. This flag was widely disliked and was replaced during Anguilla&#x27;s brief period of independence by the Dolphin Flag, which is still widely seen around the island. This flag was a banner of the arms found on the current Blue Ensign, and was white with a broad blue band across the base of the flag, above which were three stylised golden dolphins.

The Blue Ensign for Anguilla was adopted in 1990. It is used on land; it is also used at sea by vessels operated by the Government of Anguilla. Anguilla&#x27;s civil ensign - that is the ensign worn on civilian vessels registered in Anguilla - is the undifferenced Red Ensign, commonly used as a civil ensign throughout the British Empire. Anguilla has not yet adopted a distinctive version of the Red Ensign. Ashore, the dolphin flag is commonly used as an all-purpose civil flag, either in place of or in addition to the Blue Ensign. The Union Jack defaced with the Anguilla coat of arms is used by the Governor, which is the traditional design for Governors of the British overseas territories. 
A modification of the flag was reported on January 25, 1999, in the British Navy flag book as Change No. 5 1999: The dimensions of the badge have been slightly altered and the coat of arms lost its golden border.

<text>Maida Vale ( ) is an affluent residential district in West London, England, north of Paddington, southwest of St John&#x27;s Wood and south of Kilburn, on Edgware Road. It is part of the City of Westminster and is northwest of Charing Cross. It has many late Victorian and Edwardian blocks of mansion flats. The area is home to the BBC Maida Vale Studios.

==Toponym==
The name of the area is derived from a pub and an Italian battle during the Napoleonic Wars. The original pub called &quot;The Hero of Maida&quot; stood on Edgware Road near the Regent&#x27;s Canal until it closed in 1992. In the early 19th century, its hanging board displayed the likeness of the Georgian era General Sir John Stuart, under which was the legend &quot;Sir John Stuart, the hero of Maida&quot;. General Sir John Stuart was made Count of Maida (a town in Calabria) by King Ferdinand IV of Naples and III of Sicily after the British victory at the Battle of Maida in 1806. As the expansion of London gathered pace, the name stuck as the farmland around the pub was used for urban development in the 1820s.

==Geography==

The area is bounded by Maida Avenue and the Regent&#x27;s Canal to the south, Maida Vale Road to the north-east, Kilburn Park Road to the north-west, and Shirland Road and Blomfield Road to the south-west: an area of around . It makes up most of the W9 postal district.

The southern part of Maida Vale, at the junction of Paddington Basin with Regent&#x27;s Canal with many houseboats, is known as Little Venice. Paddington Recreation Ground is also located in Maida Vale.

The area to the west of Maida Vale, is known as &quot;Maida Hill&quot;. It is a recognised postal district bounded by the Avenues on the west, the Regent&#x27;s Canal to the south, Maida Vale to the east and Kilburn Lane to the north. Parts of Maida Vale were also included in this. The use of the name &quot;Maida Hill&quot; declined, but increased again since the mid-2000s as the 414 bus route (from 2005 to 2021) gave its destination as Maida Hill, and a new Maida Hill market was introduced on the square at the junction of Elgin Avenue and Harrow Road. Maida Hill is also known as &quot;West Kilburn&quot;, with the two names being used interchangeably.

Just to the east of Maida Vale is St John&#x27;s Wood, with Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground.

==History==
The area was previously owned by the Church, initially as part of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, then later by the Bishop of London after the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

In 1742, a lease for future development was signed by Sir John Frederick. His daughter later married Robert Thistlethwaite, a Hampshire landowner, whose Hampshire holdings including Widley and Wymering are commemorated in Maida Vale street names.

In 1816, an Act of Parliament allowed the trustees of Sir John Frederick&#x27;s estate and the Bishop of London to begin developing the area. This began in the 1820s with development along Edgware Road. The area was first named on maps as Maida Vale in 1827. John Gutch, surveyor to the Bishop of London, produced a plan for the area in 1827, which roughly corresponds to current road alignments.

By 1868, a stretch of Edgware Road near the area had been officially named Maida Vale. In 1960, the ownership of the area&#x27;s freehold passed from the Bishop of London to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, whose function was to administer the church&#x27;s assets.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Maida Vale was a significant Sephardic Jewish district, to the extent that an 1878 magazine report reported that it was commonly called &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;. The 1896 Spanish &amp; Portuguese Synagogue, a Grade II listed building and headquarters of the British Sephardi community, is on Lauderdale Road. The actor Alec Guinness was born on this road. The first Prime Minister of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, lived within sight of this synagogue on Warrington Crescent. The pioneer of modern computing, Alan Turing, was born at what is now the Colonnade Hotel in Warrington Crescent.

Maida Vale tube station was opened on 6 June 1915 on the Bakerloo line. Warwick Avenue tube station on the same line had been opened a few months earlier.

==BBC Studios==

Maida Vale is home to some of BBC network radio&#x27;s recording and broadcast studios. The building on Delaware Road is one of the BBC&#x27;s earliest premises, pre-dating Broadcasting House, and was the centre of the BBC radio news service during World War II. The building houses seven music and radio drama studios. Most famously it was home to John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 &quot;Peel Sessions&quot; and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.

In 2018 the BBC announced plans to close the Maida Vale studios and relocate its functions to East London.

==Little Venice==
Little Venice is a comparatively recent name for parts of Maida Vale and Paddington in the City of Westminster. It consists of the area surrounding the Little Venice basin and its canals. It is known for its Regency style white stucco buildings and its canals and moored boats. The name Little Venice is applied to Maida Avenue, Warwick Crescent and Blomfield Road, and the streets in the south of Maida Vale overlooking Browning&#x27;s Pool, including the section of Randolph Avenue south of Warrington Crescent.

According to one story, the poet Robert Browning, who lived in the area from 1862 to 1887, coined the name. However, this was disputed by Lord Kinross in 1966 and by London Canals. Both assert that Lord Byron (1788–1824) humorously coined the name, which now applies more loosely to a longer reach of the canal system. Browning&#x27;s Pool is named after the poet. It forms the junction of Regent&#x27;s Canal and the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal.

South Maida Vale, a prime residential area, also has a reputation for shops and restaurants and for the Canal Cafe Theatre, the Puppet Theatre Barge, the &quot;Waterside Café&quot; and the &quot;Warwick Castle&quot; pub. A waterbus service operates from Little Venice eastwards round Regent&#x27;s Park, calling at London Zoo and on towards Camden Town. The Inland Waterways Association has hosted since 1983 a Canalway Cavalcade in Little Venice.

==Other areas==

Maida Vale is noted for wide tree-lined avenues, large communal gardens and red-brick mansion blocks from the late Victorian and Edwardian eras. The first mansion blocks were completed in 1897, with the arrival of the identically designed Lauderdale Mansions South, Lauderdale Mansions West and Lauderdale Mansions East in Lauderdale Road. Others followed in neighbouring streets: Elgin Mansions (Elgin Avenue) and Leith Mansions (Grantully Road) in 1900, Ashworth Mansions (Elgin Avenue and Grantully Road) and Castellain Mansions (Castellain Road) in 1902, Elgin Court (Elgin Avenue) and Carlton Mansions (Randolph Avenue) in 1902, Delaware Mansions (Delaware Road) and Biddulph Mansions (Elgin Avenue and Biddulph Road) in 1907 and Randolph Court in 1910.

Among the buildings of architectural interest is the Carlton Tavern, a pub on Carlton Vale. Built in 1920–1921 for Charrington Brewery, it is thought to be the work of the architect Frank J. Potter and is noted for its 1920s interiors and faience tiled exterior. The building was being considered by Historic England for Grade II listing when it was unexpectedly demolished in March 2015 by the property developer CLTX Ltd to make way for a block of flats. The pub was subsequently rebuilt and re-opened following a community campaign and planning appeals.

==Demography==
Maida Vale has a namesake electoral ward and in the 2022 local election returned three Labour councillors for Westminster City Council. The 2011 census counted a population of 10,210 in the ward. Ethnicity-wise, 62.4% of the population were White (38% British, 3% Irish, 22% Other), 11.7% were Asian, and 7.1% were Black. Maida Vale also had a large Arab community, who formed 9.2% of the population, and by far the most spoken foreign language was Arabic. Of the 4,480 households, the number of homes owned or privately rented were about even, with socially rented a bit less but still significant. Properties are predominantly in the flats/maisonettes/apartments category (over 90 percent of the households). The median age was 33. Being in the inner city, the majority of residents do not own a car or van.

==Religion==
Local places of worship include St Saviour&#x27;s Church, Warwick Avenue, a building constructed in 1972–1976 in a &quot;modern&quot; style. The latter building was referred to by some local residents as &quot;the God Box&quot;. 

Lauderdale Road Synagogue, a Sephardic Jewish place of worship, is in Maida Vale.

<text>The national flag of Antigua and Barbuda was adopted on 27 February 1967 to mark the achievement of self-government. A competition to design the flag was held in which more than 600 local people entered. The winning design was put forth by nationally well-known artist and sculptor Sir Reginald Samuel.

== Design and symbolism ==
The design is a red field with an inverted isosceles triangle based on the top edge of the field pointed toward the bottom edge of the field bearing the horizontal tricolour of black, light blue (half width) and white with the rising sun centred on top of the black band. The rising sun symbolises the dawning of a new era.

The colours have different meanings: the black is for the African ancestry of the people; the blue for hope; and the red for energy or life of the people. The successive colouring of black, yellow, blue, and white (from the sun down) also stands for the soil, sun, sea, and sand. The blue also represents the Caribbean Sea, and the V-shape is the symbol of victory. The seven points on the flag represent each of the six parishes and the island of Barbuda.

The state ensign, which is used only by the national coast guard, consists of a white field, a red cross, and the state flag in the canton.

===Construction Sheet===
== History ==
===Pre-1967===
From the beginning of European settlement on the islands in the 1630s, the flags of England (pre 1707), Great Britain (1707–1800), United Kingdom (1801–1871), British Leeward Islands (1871–1958) and West Indies Federation (1958–1962) were used over the islands. The first flag representing the territory of the present-day nation was created in the late 1950s, at which time Antigua and Barbuda were reorganized into a province of the West Indies Federation. This flag consists of a Blue Ensign defaced with the coat of arms. The coat of arms depicted the landscape of the island with an aloe-plant on the shore and a sugar mill on a hill. It is not known exactly when the coat of arms was developed, however, since 1909 this design has been used to represent Atigua on the larger coat of arms of the British Leeward Islands. The Blue Ensign defaced with the local coat of arms is the common design on colonial flags throughout the British Empire, adopted by all the other provinces of the West Indies Federation. The original flag design included a white circle behind the coat of arms, but this element disappeared over time.

===History of the current flag===
The flag based on the Blue Ensign was replaced by the current design on 27 February 1967. This was 11 days after the Royal assent to the West Indies Act 1967, which changed the status of the islands from British colonies to states in free association with the United Kingdom. The flag adopted at that time was the design of Sir Reginald Samuel, which had won a public competition. Apparently it was one of the last projects admitted to the competition. After gaining full independence on 1 November 1981, the flag was retained.

<text>Farringdon Road is a road in Clerkenwell, London.

== Route ==
Farringdon Road is part of the A201 route connecting King&#x27;s Cross to Elephant and Castle. It goes southeast from King&#x27;s Cross, crossing Rosebery Avenue, then turns south, crossing Clerkenwell Road before going past Farringdon station. It finishes on the border between the City of London, the London Borough of Camden and the London Borough of Islington, at a junction with Charterhouse Street. Its line continues into the city as Farringdon Street.

== History ==
The road&#x27;s construction, taking almost 20 years between the 1840s and the 1860s, is considered one of the greatest urban engineering achievements of the 19th century. It was one of the first engineered multi-lane roads, and buried the River Fleet in a system of tunnels, solving one of London&#x27;s most significant sanitary problems. Its construction also included the building of the world&#x27;s first stretch of underground railway, the Metropolitan Railway that later became part of the London Underground running beneath Farringdon Road from into the City at station.

The construction of Farringdon Road necessitated the removal of the Fleet Market that had been built in 1736 above the course of the River Fleet, which is now London&#x27;s largest subterranean river. North of the market was Hockley-in-the-Hole (around Ray Street Bridge), an area notorious for bear-baiting and similar activities.

Farringdon Road was also home to the notorious Fleet Prison. It was on this side of the prison that a grille was built into the Farringdon Street prison wall, so that prisoners might beg alms from passers-by. Charles Dickens describes this in his book The Pickwick Papers:

&quot;Most of our readers will remember, that, until within a very few years past, there was a kind of iron cage in the wall of the Fleet Prison, within which was posted some man of hungry looks, who, from time to time, rattled a money-box, and exclaimed in a mournful voice, &#x27;Pray, remember the poor debtors; pray remember the poor debtors&#x27;. The receipts of this box, when there were any, were divided among the poor prisoners; and the men on the poor side relieved each other in this degrading office. Although this custom has been abolished, and the cage is now boarded up, the miserable and destitute condition of these unhappy persons remains the same. We no longer suffer them to appeal at the prison gates to the charity and compassion of the passersby; but we still leave unblotted the leaves of our statute book, for the reverence and admiration of succeeding ages, the just and wholesome law which declares that the sturdy felon shall be fed and clothed, and that the penniless debtor shall be left to die of starvation and nakedness. This is no fiction.&quot;

Farringdon Road was the best known site in London for book barrows. In the 19th and 20th centuries books were sold by itinerant street traders from two-wheeled flat-bed barrows on which were books were laid out for sale. Although book barrows could be found elsewhere in London the 30 or 40 barrows on Farringdon Road tended to offer the better quality volumes. As a result, bibliophiles would visit in search of rare books at a modest price.

==Properties==
Amongst the notable buildings on Farringdon Road are the former headquarters of &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper at Nos. 119–141, the so-called Zeppelin Building at No. 61 built in 1917 after a Zeppelin raid during World War I, and the western side of Smithfield Market.

A notorious building on Farringdon Road was the Farringdon Road Buildings, a five-tenement block of dwellings built for the working classes during the Victorian era. Lacking bathrooms and with poor sanitary conditions this building, one of the last slum dwellings to exist in central London, was still occupied until the early 1970s. Common features were poor lighting, overcrowding, with rat- and cockroach-infested living conditions, and people trapped by their own poverty. The residents were re-housed by Islington Borough Council and the buildings, close to Exmouth Market and the Royal Mail Mount Pleasant Sorting Office, were pulled down in the mid-1970s to be replaced by a multi-storey car park. A contemporary description of the buildings is given in George Gissing&#x27;s novel &quot;The Nether World&quot;.

The dwellings in Faringdon Road had an annex at the bottom of Safron Hill have been restored and now belong to the De Beers Diamond Group. The original set of dwellings were occupied predominantly by Italians and formed part of &quot;Little Italy&quot;

<text>Peter Frederick Carter-Ruck (26 February 1914 – 19 December 2003) was an English solicitor, specialising in libel cases. The firm he founded, Carter-Ruck, is still practising.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Carter-Ruck was educated at St Edward&#x27;s School, Oxford. He spent three months in Germany during the 1930s, observing the rising popularity of Adolf Hitler and attending a rally in Freiburg. Upon his return, he trained and qualified as a solicitor.

His daughter Julie Scott-Bayfield also became a libel lawyer.

===Career===
He was Senior Partner, Oswald Hickson, Collier &amp; Co (1945–1981) until he founded and was Senior Partner of his own eponymous firm, Peter Carter-Ruck and Partners (1981–1998). He was Chairman, Law Society Law Reform Committee (1980–1983) and a Fellow of the Society for Advanced Legal Studies (1998–2003).

Carter-Ruck&#x27;s first major case was defending the &quot;Bolton Evening News&quot; successfully against a libel action brought by the Labour MP Bessie Braddock, who, the paper had claimed, had danced a jig in Parliament.

In December 1995, Carter-Ruck acted for the royal nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke in the matter of an allegation by Diana, Princess of Wales, that Legge-Bourke had aborted a pregnancy in which Prince Charles was the father.

===Criticism===
In 1980, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; editor Derek Jameson was advised by Carter-Ruck that if he sued the BBC over their portrayal of him in a &quot;Week Ending&quot; sketch, he would win at least £25,000 in damages. The barrister in the case, David Eady QC, however advised Carter-Ruck to accept the BBC&#x27;s offer to settle for £10 plus costs. Carter-Ruck did not disclose this advice to his client. The jury found the broadcast defamatory, but also fair comment and Jameson had to pay costs, receiving a bill for £41,342.50 from Carter-Ruck. Jameson learned by chance of the QC&#x27;s advice and Carter-Ruck&#x27;s former partner David Hooper claimed that &quot;Carter-Ruck told him a string of lies&quot;. Carter-Ruck later claimed that he did not want to undermine Jameson&#x27;s morale in court.

==Personal life==
* A yachtsman, he owned a succession of boats which he christened &quot;Fair Judgment&quot;. He was a member of the Law Society Yacht Club, the Royal Ocean Racing Club, the Royal Yacht Squadron, and the Garrick.

* Carter-Ruck was the founder-governor of Shiplake College at Henley.

<doc id="417422" wikidata="Q130774" url="?curid=417422" title="Flag of Argentina">
<text>The national flag of the Argentine Republic, often referred to as the Argentine flag (), is a triband, composed of three equally wide horizontal bands coloured light blue and white. There are multiple interpretations on the reasons for those colors. The flag was created by Manuel Belgrano, in line with the creation of the Cockade of Argentina, and was first raised at the city of Rosario on February 27, 1812, during the Argentine War of Independence. The National Flag Memorial was later built on the site. The First Triumvirate did not approve the use of the flag, but the Asamblea del Año XIII allowed the use of the flag as a war flag. It was the Congress of Tucumán which finally designated it as the national flag, in 1816. A yellow Sun of May was added to the center in 1818.

The full flag featuring the sun is called the Official Ceremonial Flag (). The flag without the sun is considered the Ornamental Flag (). While both versions are equally considered the national flag, the ornamental version must always be hoisted below the Official Ceremony Flag. In vexillological terms, the Official Ceremonial Flag is the civil, state, and war flag and ensign, while the Ornamental Flag is an alternative civil flag and ensign. 
There is controversy of the true colour of the first flag between historians and the descendants of Manuel Belgrano between blue and pale blue.

It is one of the five flags that use the ratio 5:8, the others being Guatemala, Palau, Poland, and Sweden.

==History==
===19th century===
The flag of Argentina was created by Manuel Belgrano during the Argentine War of Independence. While in Rosario he noticed that both the royalist and patriotic forces were using the same colors, Spain&#x27;s yellow and red. After realizing this, Belgrano created the Cockade of Argentina, which was approved by the First Triumvirate on February 18, 1812. Encouraged by this success, he created a flag of the same colors nine days later. It used the colors that were used by the &quot;Criollos&quot; during the May Revolution in 1810. However, recent research and studies would indicate that the colors were chosen from the Spanish Order of Charles III symbolizing the allegiance to the rightful, and then captive King Ferdinand VII of Spain. Most portraits about the creation or first uses of the flag show the modern design of it, but the flag of Macha, a very early design kept at the House of Freedom in Sucre, Bolivia was instead a vertical triband with two white bands and a light blue one in the middle.

The flag was first flown for soldiers to swear allegiance to it on 27 February 1812, by personnel of the &quot;Batería Libertad&quot; (Liberty Battery), by the Paraná River. On that day, Belgrano said the following words:

Belgrano dispatched a letter addressed to the First Triumvirate, informing them of the newly created flag. However, unlike with the cockade, the Triumvirate did not accept the use of the flag: policy at the time was to state that the government was ruling on behalf of King Ferdinand VII of Spain who was captive of Napoleon, whereas the creation of a flag was a clear independentist act. Thus, the triumvirate sent a warning to Belgrano not to fight under the flag, but by the time the reply had arrived, Belgrano had moved to the north, following the previous orders that requested him to strengthen the patriotic position in the Upper Peru after the defeat of Juan José Castelli at the Battle of Huaqui. Meanwhile, the flag was hoisted for the first time in Buenos Aires atop the Church of Saint Nicholas of Bari on August 23, 1812; where nowadays the Obelisk of Buenos Aires is located. Still not knowing about the Triumvirate&#x27;s refusal, Belgrano raised the flag at San Salvador de Jujuy and had it blessed by the local church on the second anniversary of the May Revolution. Belgrano accepted the orders from the Triumvirate by time they arrived to Salta and ceased using the flag. As soldiers had already made oaths to the new flag, Belgrano said that he was saving it for the circumstance of a great victory. 

The First Triumvirate was later replaced by the Second Triumvirate, with a more liberal ideology, who called the Asamblea del Año XIII. Despite being one of its original goals, it did not declare independence, and so did not approve the use of a national flag either; nevertheless, the flag made by Belgrano was authorized to be used as a war flag. The first oath to the newly approved flag was on February 13, 1813, next to the Salado River, which became known as the &quot;Río Juramento&quot; (&quot;Oath River&quot;). The first battle fought with the approved flag was the Battle of Salta, a decisive patriotic victory that achieved the complete defeat of royalist Pío Tristán.

The flag would be finally declared the National Flag by the Congress of Tucumán on July 20, 1816, shortly after the declaration of independence. The proposal was made by the deputy Juan José Paso and the text written by the deputy of Charcas, José Serrano. On February 25, 1818, the Congress (now working at Buenos Aires) included the Sun of May in the war flag, after the proposal of deputy Chorroarín. The sun was copied after the one that the first Argentine coin featured in 1813. It was subsequently decided to keep it as part of the regular flag afterwards, and thus the sun no longer represents war.
José de San Martín was aware of the new flag, but did not employ it during the crossing of the Andes in 1817. Being a joint operation of both Argentine and Chilean forces, he thought that a new flag would be a better idea than using either the Argentine or the Chilean flag. This led to the creation of the Flag of the Andes, used in the crossing. This flag is currently used as a provincial flag by Mendoza province.

===20th century===
On June 8, 1938, president Roberto Ortiz sanctioned national law no. 12,361 declaring June 20 &quot;Flag Day&quot;, a national holiday. The date was decided as the anniversary of Belgrano&#x27;s death in 1820. In 1957 the National Flag Memorial (a 10,000 m monumental complex) was inaugurated in Rosario to commemorate the creation of the flag, and the official Flag Day ceremonies have customarily been conducted in its vicinity since then.

In 1978 it was specified, among other measurements, that the Official Ceremony Flag should be 1.4 meters wide and 0.9 meters high, and that the sun must be embroidered.

According to the Decree 10,302/1944 the article 2 stated that the Official Flag of the Nation is the flag with sun, approved by the &quot;Congress of Tucumán&quot;, reunited in Buenos Aires on 25 February 1818. The article 3 stated that the flag with the sun in its center is to be used only by the Federal and Provincial Governments; while individuals and institutions use a flag without the sun.

In 1985 the Law 23,208 repealed the article 3 of the Decree 10,302/1944, saying that the Federal and Provincial Governments, as well as individuals have the right to use the Official Flag of the Nation.
===21st century===
In November 2010, the exact design specifications for the flag were standardized and promulgated via presidential decree, specifying the exact colors, proportions, and aspect ratio.

==Historical flags==
==Design==

Popular belief attributes the colors to those of the sky, clouds and the sun; some anthems to the flag like &quot;Aurora&quot; or &quot;Salute to the flag&quot; state so as well. However, historians usually disregard this idea, and attribute them to loyalty towards the House of Bourbon. 

After the May Revolution, the first times of the Argentine War of Independence, the Triumvirate claimed to be acting on behalf of the Spanish King Ferdinand VII, who was prisoner of Napoleon Bonaparte during the Peninsular War. Whether such loyalty was real or a trick to conceal independentism is a topic of dispute. The creation of a new flag with those colors would have been then a way to denote autonomy, while keeping the relations with the captive king alive.

===Shape and size===
From 1978, the flag&#x27;s official proportions are 9:14, and its official size is 0.9 by 1.4 meters. It features three stripes alternating sky blue, white and sky blue. Each stripe is 30 centimeters high. In the center stripe there is an emblem known as the Sun of May (), a golden sun. Historian Diego Abad de Santillán claimed that the Sun of May was a representation of the Inca sun god Inti.

Flags with proportions of 1:2 and 2:3 are also in use.

===Colors===
The colors are officially defined using the CIE 1976 standard:
The following are given for computer, textile, print and plastic use:
The Spanish word (sky blue) is used to describe the colour of the blue stripes.
===Sun of May===

The sun is called the Sun of May because it is a replica of an engraving on the first Argentine coin, approved in 1813, whose value was eight &quot;escudos&quot; (one Spanish dollar). It has 16 straight and 16 waved sunbeams.

In 1978 the sun color was specified to be golden yellow (), to have an inner diameter of 10 cm, and an outer diameter of 25 cm (the diameter of the sun equals the height of the white stripe. The sun&#x27;s face is of its height). It features 32 rays, alternately wavy and straight, and from 1978 it must be embroidered in the &quot;Official Flag Ceremony&quot;.

==Influence of the Argentine flag==


The French privateer Louis-Michel Aury used the Argentine flag as a sports model for the blue-white-blue flag of the first independent state in Central America, which was created 1818 in Isla de Providencia, an island off the east coast of Nicaragua on the Caribbean Sea. This state existed until approximately 1821, before the Gran Colombia took over control of these islands. Somewhat later (1823) this flag was again used as the model for the flag of the United Provinces of Central America, a confederation of the current Central American states of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which existed from 1823 to 1838. After the dissolution of the Union, the five countries became independent, but even today all of these states except Costa Rica use flags of blue-white-blue stripes (the Costa Rican flag has a compound red stripe on the white one, added to incorporate all the colors of the French flag). The Argentine flag also inspired the flag of Uruguay.

===Current flags of Central and South American countries===

==Anthems to the flag==

===Aurora (Sunrise)===

Lyrics by Luigi Illica and Héctor Cipriano Quesada, music by Héctor Panizza, it is sung during flag raising ceremonies.

===Saludo a la bandera (Salutation to the Flag)===

===Mi Bandera (My Flag)===

== Pledge to the Flag ==
As Flag Day is celebrated on June 20, the following pledge is recited to students nationwide on this day by their respective school principals or grade level advisers. In large towns where students are gathered en masse, the pledge is taken by the local town or city executive, preceded by words of advice and honor to the memory of its creator, Manuel Belgrano, using the following or similar formulas:

=== Traditional Pledge ===
Versions of this include references to Belgrano and to all who fought for the country during the Argentine War of Independence and other wars that followed.

=== Modern Pledge ===
The &quot;Glorious Reveille&quot; may be sounded by a military or a marching band at this point, and confetti may be showered upon the students.

In the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic and civil uniformed services the pledge is similar but with a different formula and response of &quot;¡Si, juro!&quot; (&quot;Yes, I pledge!&quot;)

=== Military/police variant ===
In the Argentine Federal Police, the words (and its Constitution) may be inserted.

<doc id="417423" wikidata="Q255931" url="?curid=417423" title="Haripuñjaya">
<text>Haripuñjaya (Central and Northern Thai: , also spelled Haribhuñjaya) was a Mon kingdom in what is now Northern Thailand, existing from the 7th or 8th to 13th century CE. Its capital was at Lamphun, which at the time was also called Haripuñjaya. In 1292 the city was besieged and captured by Mangrai of the Tai kingdom of Lan Na.

The kingdom is referred to as &quot;K&#x27;un-lun&quot; in ancient Chinese records.
==Founding==
According to the &quot;Camadevivamsa&quot;, &quot;Jinakalamali&quot; and &quot;Singhanavati&quot; chronicles, the city was founded between 629–57 AD by four hermits named Suthep, Sukatanata, Tapanana, and Chantasikatungka. Hermit Sukatanata requested the Mon ruler of the Lavo Kingdom (present-day Lopburi) to send his daughter, Jamadevi, to become the first queen of the city. However, this date is now considered too early, and the actual beginning is placed at around 750 AD. At that time, most of what is now central Thailand was under the rule of various Mon city-states, known collectively as the Dvaravati kingdom. Queen Jamadevi gave birth to twins, the older succeeding her as the ruler of Lamphun, and the younger becoming ruler of neighboring Lampang.

The local legend said that at the beginning of her reign, Haripuñjaya&#x27;s Jamadevi defeated the Lawa dynasty&#x27;s , the 13th king of Raming Nakhon (), but her 2 princes married the 2 princesses of King Vilanga and both dynasties became allies.

==Flourishing and downfall==

In the twelfth century, during the reign of King Adityaraja, who, together with his brother Chadachota (), were previously princes of Suphannabhum but fled to Haripuñjaya after the kingdom was annexed by Lavo of Tambralinga&#x27;s prince Kampoch, came into conflict with the Khmers who took over Lavo from Tambralinga in 1002. Adityaraja, with an assist from Suphannabhum, annexed Lavo in 1052 and appointed his brother, Chadachota, the king of Lavo. This marked the end of Khmer influence in the Menam Valley. Lamphun inscriptions from 1213, 1218, and 1219, mention King Sabbadhisiddhi endowing Buddhist monuments.

The chronicles say that Austroasiatic-speaking people, possibly Kuy people and/or Lawa people, from the northern polity of Umongasela () in the present-day Fang unsuccessfully besieged Haripuñjaya several times during the 10th–11th century. In 957, due to such invasions, a Haripuñjaya noble named Aphai Kamini () went south and refounded Sukhothai, which previously was abandoned around the 6th century. 

The early 13th century was a golden time for Haripuñjaya, as the chronicles talk only about religious activities or constructing buildings, not about wars. Nevertheless, Haripuñjaya was besieged in 1292 by the Tai Yuan king Mangrai, who incorporated it into his Lan Na (&quot;One Million Rice Fields&quot;) kingdom. The plan set up by Mangrai to overpower Haripuñjaya began by dispatching Ai Fa () on an espionage mission to create chaos in Haripuñjaya. Ai Fa managed to spread discontent among the population, which weakened Haripuñjaya and made it possible for Mangrai to take the kingdom over. Phraya Yi Ba, the last king of Haripuñjaya, was forced to flee south to Lampang.

<doc id="417424" wikidata="Q33213" url="?curid=417424" title="Flag of Armenia">
<text>The national flag of Armenia (), also known as the Tricolour (), consists of three horizontal bands of equal width, red on the top, blue in the middle, and orange on the bottom. The Armenian Supreme Soviet adopted the current flag on 24 August 1990. On 15 June 2006, the Law on the National Flag of Armenia, governing its usage, was passed by the National Assembly of Armenia.

Throughout history, there have been many variations of the Armenian flag. In ancient times, Armenian dynasties were represented by different symbolic animals displayed on their flags. In the twentieth century, various Soviet flags represented the Armenian SSR.

The meanings of the colours are interpreted in many different ways. The red stands for the Armenian highlands, the Armenian people&#x27;s continued struggle for survival, maintenance of the Christian faith and Armenia&#x27;s independence and freedom, blue is for the Armenian peaceful skies, and orange represents the nation&#x27;s talent and hard-work.

==Design==
The symbolism of the flag&#x27;s colors is officially given in the 2006 law on the National Flag of Armenia:

In 2012, the Armenian National Institute of Standards (SARM) issued specifications about the construction and colours on the national flag:
==History==
Today&#x27;s tricolour flag bears little resemblance to the earliest Armenian &#x27;flags&#x27;. In ancient times, armies went into battle behind carvings mounted on poles. The carvings might represent a dragon, an eagle, a lion or &quot;some mysterious object of the gods&quot;.

=== Middle Ages ===
During the invasion of the Arabs, despite stronger resistance than even the Persian, Armenia came under control Umayyad Caliphate, and on its territory the Armenian Emirate was created, stretching from modern Baku and Derbent in the east to the sources of the Euphrates in the west and from the Terek River in the north to Lake Urmia in the south. The emirate received a flag, which is a black cloth without any additional elements on it.

In 885, Armenia gained independence and the flag, which is a dark red canvas with the image of a white leopard and a Christian cross on it. Now the &quot;Ani leopard&quot; from this flag is also an element of the flag and coat of arms of the second largest city and cultural capital of Armenia - Gyumri. Unlike the flags of Greater Armenia, the flag of Armenian Kingdom was not the flag of the ruling dynasty.

One of the first atlases to contain an Armenian state, a 1339 map by Angelino Dulcert depicts the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia with two flags. The first flag is that of the flag of Ayas or Lajazzo and has a white field, with a red animal in the center. The second is the flag of Lamos has a black field, broken by a grid of white crosses. The flag of Lamos would later appear in the 1375 Catalan Atlas along with the flag of Alexandretta which has a white field with a red animal in the center, created the same year the Kingdom of Cilicia fell to the Ottoman Empire. Another variation of the flag of Ayas would appear on the 1325 portolan chart of Angelino de Dalorto, featuring a red background with a white animal in the center and black stripes. On a Jorge Aguiar&#x27;s portolan chart, Alexandretta would be featured again with a different scheme, red and yellow diagonal stripes. Sebastia was also featured on the Catalan Atlas and Dulcert Atlas, with the right side of the flag boasting a white square with a red cross and for smaller red crosses, similar to the modern flag of Georgia, with a yellow section attached to the left side bearing a red square, that of the Ilkhanate, most likely representing Ilkhanate occupation. On a 1428 atlas by Johas de Villadestes kept in the Topkapi Museum, the flags of Corycus, Alexandretta, and Tarson appear. With Alexandretta bearing a yellow flag with a green circle and yellow lion in the center, Corycus bearing a black field with a large white cross and four smaller white crosses in the open black fields, and Tarson bearing a brown field with, cross hatched on the right side with black stripes and overlated with seven gold crosses, while the right remains brown and bears two gold crosses. According to the Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms, the flag of Cilician Armenia is show with the bottom half gray with five gold crowns or Fleur-de-lis with the top of the flag being white with a large red cross and four smaller crosses similar to the Jerusalem cross. The flag of Sebastia is also recorded in the same source with three given variants, all of which feature a white background with a red cross dividing the white and four smaller red crosses in the spaces. The flag of Corycus is also found in the Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms as well with the same design previously described. In a Portuguese armorial produced in 1416, the flag of Cilician Armenia under the House of Lusignan is shown. The banner divided into four parts, the top left depicting a gray background with a golden Jerusalem cross, the top right showing a red lion rampant on top of a striped blue and white background representing the Lusignans, the bottom right showing a white background with a red lion rampnt, and crowned with a golden crown representing the Rubenids, and the bottom left showing a red background with a yellow or gold lion with a crown representing the Hethumids.

===19th century===
After Armenia was split between the Persian and the Ottoman Empire, the idea of an Armenian flag ceased to exist for some time. The Armenian Catholic priest Father Ghevont Alishan created a new flag for Armenia in 1885, after the Armenian Students Association of Paris requested one for the funeral of the French writer Victor Hugo. Alishan&#x27;s first design was a horizontal tricolour, the top band was red, symbolizing the first Sunday of Easter (called &quot;Red&quot; Sunday), followed by a green band to represent the &quot;Green&quot; Sunday of Easter, and finally an arbitrary colour, white, was chosen to complete the combination. While in France, Alishan also designed a second flag. Its colours were red, green, and either blue or yellow, representing the rainbow that Noah saw after landing on Mount Ararat. During the Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828, the Armenian volunteer militias had three battle flags, boasting the Double-headed eagle, Noah&#x27;s Ark, and a depiction of Jesus Christ.

===First Republic of Armenia===

On 1 August 1918, after the declaration of the First Republic of Armenia, the Armenian National Council convened the first session of the National Assembly of Armenia. Several reports indicate that an unknown tricolor flag was flown at the assembly, which was possibly the tricolor that would be approved during the assembly. According to Simon Vratsian, Stepan Malkhasyants presented a now-lost report on the first day of the assembly, in which he discussed the flag of the republic and proposed a horizontal tricolor of red, blue, and orange. While no meaning was given to these colors by Malkhasyants, several parliament members believed that the red represented the blood of the Armenian people, the blue represented the sky of Armenia and the orange represented the talent and work of the Armenian people. The proposed flag sparked significant debate in the parliament, in which several proposed flags historically used in Armenia were brought up. Many members argued that the orange should be replaced with green, as orange cloth was difficult to source in Armenia at the time. However, Prime Minister Hovhannes Kajaznuni believed the orange to be more aesthetically pleasing, and so kept the color. Later that day, a vote was held, in which it was decided that the flag was to be a horizontal tricolor of red, blue, and orange, with a height to width ratio of 2:3.

The design was seemingly temporary, and was to be approved by the constituent assembly, which was to be formed when the Republic of Armenia united with Turkish Armenia. Sourcing orange cloth for the flag continued to be difficult; on 19 September 1918, minister of internal affairs Aram Manukian sent an instruction to government institutions that the colors to be used for the flag were red, blue, and yellow. In June 1919, the parliament of Armenia reaffirmed that the previously adopted flag was the flag of a United Armenia, but would only be finalized at the constituent assembly. Despite not being official, the Republic of Armenia used it in official documents, such as an April 1920 bank check issued in the United States. The constituent assembly would never take place, as on 29 November 1920, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic troops and Armenian Bolsheviks occupied Armenia&#x27;s capital Yerevan, and proclaimed the Socialist Soviet Republic of Armenia.

Several alternate proposals for the flag were made by Armenians. On 31 July 1919, Armenian artist Martiros Saryan sent a letter to Kajaznuni after learning that the flag had not been finalized, in which he proposed three alternate designs, one tricolor and two rainbows. As he believed that the temporary flag represented a rainbow, and thought it was too similar to the , he proposed that the flag be a six-colored horizontal rainbow. In the watercolor images contained in the letter, one of these rainbow flags was depicted with equally-spaced bars, and the other depicted with the primary colored bars twice as large as the secondary color bars. The final attached imaged is a tricolor of red, yellow, and blue from top to bottom, possibly arranged to match their order in a rainbow.

In April 1919, a proposal for the flag of Armenia was published in the Armenian diaspora journal , consisting of a horizontal bicolor with the top two-thirds blue, and the bottom third red, with a white cross in the center.

===Armenian SSR===
On 2 February 1922, the Constitution of the Armenian SSR was signed into law, describing the republic&#x27;s flag in Article 89 as a red banner, with the gold letters &quot;Հ.Խ.Ս.Հ.&quot; in the upper left corner. Official contemporaneous media which depict the flag, such as pins and certificates, often portray it with variations, including periods between the letters, and with a gold frame around the letters. Additionally, an 1923 book published by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs depicts the lettering of the flag in Cyrillic script, instead of in the Armenian alphabet used in the constitution&#x27;s description.

The flag would continue to be used by the Armenian SSR even after its integration into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic in 1922. The new constitution of the Armenian SSR under the Transcaucasian SFSR, approved on 4 March 1927, described the flag almost exactly the same as the 1922 constitution.

In 1936, the Constitution of the USSR was rewritten, splitting the Transcaucasian SFSR into its constituent republics. Soon after in 1937, the constitution of the Armenian SSR was once again rewritten, adding a gold yellow hammer and sickle above the lettering. In 1940, a decree by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR ordered that the lettering on the flag be changed to &quot;Հ.Ս.Ս.Ռ.&quot;, in order to reflect the new name of the Armenian SSR. In 1952, the flag was completely redesigned. The obverse of the new flag was composed of a red field, with a horizontal blue stripe running through the center, and a golden hammer and sickle below a star in the canton. The reverse of the flag simply contained the red field and blue stripe.

In late May 1988, amid rising nationalist tensions due to glasnost and perestroika, the leader of the Communist Party of Armenia, , allowed the previously banned flag of the First Republic of Armenia to fly in Yerevan for the first time in over sixty years. A year later, he urged that the flag be officially recognized, after a mass demonstration by the Karabakh movement where the tricolour was flown. This came on 24 August 1990, a day after the Armenian Supreme Soviet declared the republic&#x27;s sovereignty and renamed the country the Republic of Armenia. At that point, just over a year before Armenia declared its formal independence from the USSR, the tricolour replaced the 1952 flag.

==Usage==
The 2006 law on the National Flag of Armenia states that the flag has to be raised on the following public buildings:
*Residence of the President
*Parliament
*Government
*Constitutional Court
*Office of Public Prosecutor
*Central Bank of Armenia
*Other governmental buildings

The law requires the lowering of the flag to the midpoint of the flagpole on the days of mourning or during mourning ceremonies. A black ribbon needs to be placed at the top of the flag; the length of the ribbon should be equal to the length of the flag. The flying flag has to be raised in its entirety, clean, and unfaded; moreover, the lower part of the flag should be at least 2.5 m off the ground.

===National flag days===
The day of the National Flag of Armenia is marked on 15 June every year. The day is chosen for the reason that the Armenian law on the National Flag of Armenia was passed on 15 June 2006. The day of the Armenian tricolour was celebrated for the first time on 15 June 2010 in Yerevan.

The daily display of the Armenian flag is encouraged, but legally required only on the following days:

* 1 January, 2 JanuaryNew Year
* 6 JanuaryChristmas
* 8 MarchInternational Women&#x27;s Day
* 7 AprilMotherhood and Beauty Day
* 1 MayInternational Worker&#x27;s Solidarity Day
* 9 MayVictory and Peace Day
* 28 MayFirst Armenian Republic Day, 1918
* 5 JulyConstitution Day, 1995
* 21 SeptemberIndependence Day, 1991
* 7 DecemberSpitak Earthquake Memorial Day, 1988

==Influence==
The national flag is also mentioned in the song &quot;Mer Hayrenik&quot; (Our Fatherland), the national anthem of Armenia. Specifically, the second and third stanzas sing about the creation of the national flag:

===Flag of Artsakh===

On 2 June 1992, the Republic of Artsakh, a now-defunct &quot;de facto&quot; independent republic in South Caucasus, adopted a flag derived from the flag of Armenia, with only a white pattern added. A white, five-toothed, stepped carpet pattern was added to the flag, beginning at the two verges of the cloth&#x27;s right side and connecting at a point equal to one-third of the distance from that side. The white pattern symbolized the separation of Artsakh from Armenia proper and its aspiration for eventual union with the Republic&#x27;s claimed Fatherland. This symbolized the Armenian heritage, culture and population of the area and represents Artsakh as being a separated region of Armenia by the triangular shape and the zigzag cutting through the flag. The pattern was also similar to the designs used on rugs. The ratio of the flag&#x27;s breadth to its length is 1:2, same as the Armenian tricolour.

===Flag of the Pan-Armenian Games===
In addition to the flag of Artsakh, the Armenian flag colors influenced the design of the Pan-Armenian Games flag. In the center of the light blue flag are six interlocking rings, derived from the Olympic rings. The sixth, orange-colored ring, interlocks with the blue and red rings, which symbolize Armenia. Above the rings is a flame in the colors of the Armenian flag.

<text>The Socialist Party of Serbia (, abbr. SPS) is a populist political party in Serbia. Ivica Dačić has led SPS as its president since 2006.

SPS was founded in 1990 as a merger of the League of Communists of Serbia and Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia with Slobodan Milošević as its first president. In the 1990 general elections, SPS became the ruling party of Serbia while Milošević was elected president of Serbia. During Milošević&#x27;s rule, SPS relied on the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) from 1992 to 1993 while it later led several coalition governments with SRS, New Democracy, and Yugoslav Left. Mass protests against SPS were held in 1991, and after being accused of falsifying votes in major urban cities, such as Belgrade and Niš, 1996–1997 protests were also organised. The Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition defeated SPS in the 2000 general elections but Milošević declined to accept the results. This resulted in Milošević&#x27;s overthrow.

SPS was in opposition until 2003 after which it served as confidence and supply to the government led by Vojislav Koštunica until 2007. Dačić led SPS into a coalition government with the Democratic Party after the 2008 parliamentary election, while four years later he became the prime minister of Serbia after the formation of a coalition government with the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). He remained prime minister until 2014, while SPS has since then remained a junior member of SNS-led governments. Although it described itself as a democratic socialist party, SPS promoted mixed economy and populist nationalism under Milošević&#x27;s leadership and was accused of authoritarianism. SPS has remained populist under Dačić but it shifted towards social democracy and a centre-left and more pragmatic, pro-European image. SPS is affiliated and cooperates with United Serbia and Greens of Serbia.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
After the World War II, the Communist Party consolidated power in Yugoslavia. Each constituent republic had its own branch of the party, with Serbia having the Communist Party of Serbia, which was renamed to League of Communists of Serbia (SKS) in 1952. SKS elected Slobodan Milošević as its president in 1986, after an endorsement coming from then-incumbent president of SKS, Ivan Stambolić. Milošević came to power by promising to reduce the autonomy of provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. At a congress that was held in January 1990, rifts between SKS and League of Communists of Slovenia occurred which ultimately led to the dissolution of the federal Communist Party. This also led to the establishment of multi-party systems in the constituent republics.

Milošević organised a congress on 17 July 1990, during which its delegates voted in favour of merging SKS and the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia (SSRNJ) to create the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). Milošević was elected as the party&#x27;s president. According to political scientist Jerzy Wiatr, the merger &quot;did not substantially change either the organisational structure of the party or its administration&quot;, although SPS did gain control of a large amount of infrastructure, including material and financial assets. Milošević as president of the SPS was able to wield considerable power and influence in the government and the public and private sectors, while members of SPS who had shown their independence from loyalty towards Milošević were expelled from the party.

=== 1990–1992 ===

SPS took part in the general elections which was organised for December 1990. The parliamentary election was conducted in a first-past-the-post system, where members were elected in 250 single-member constituency seats; this system strengthened the position of SPS. This resulted into SPS winning 194 out of 250 seats in the National Assembly, despite only winning 48% of the popular vote. Opposition parties, such as the Democratic Party (DS) and Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), tried to challenge the legitimacy of the election, citing alleged abuse of postal voting and manipulation during vote counting. In the presidential election, Milošević won 65% of the popular vote in the first round of the election. By January 1991, sociologist Laslo Sekelj reported that SPS had 500,000 members. SPS was faced with protests in March 1991, while Milošević was succeeded by Borisav Jović as the president of SPS on 24 May 1991; he held the position until 24 October 1992, when Milošević returned as president of SPS, following the second party congress.

After the break-up of Yugoslavia, Serbia became a part of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. With the opposition boycotting the May 1992 parliamentary election, due to claiming that there were no free and fair electoral conditions, SPS won 49% of the popular vote. Protests were held shortly after the election, after which snap elections were called for December 1992, in which SPS won 33% of the popular vote. Simultaneously with these elections, the 1992 general elections occurred in Serbia as a result of an early elections referendum that was organised in October 1992. The parliamentary election in 1992 was conducted under a proportional representation system, and in it SPS won 101 out of 250 seats in the National Assembly; because of that the SPS minority government had to rely on the far-right Serbian Radical Party (SRS), which had won 73 seats. In the presidential election however, Milošević won 57% of the popular vote in the first round, while his opponent Milan Panić won 35% of the popular vote.

=== 1993–2000 ===
After the announcement that SPS would abandon its hardline position regarding the Bosnian War and Croatian War of Independence in favour of a compromise and after a dispute regarding the rebalancing of the federal budget in July 1993, the coalition between SPS and SRS was disintegrated. SRS then unsuccessfully called a motion of no confidence against SPS in September 1993, though Milošević ended up dissolving the National Assembly to call a snap parliamentary election for December 1993. In the parliamentary election, SPS won 123 seats, though still short 3 seats of a majority, Milošević then persuaded the New Democracy (ND), which as part of the SPO-led Democratic Movement of Serbia coalition won 5 seats, to enter a coalition government with SPS. ND accepted this and the new government headed by Mirko Marjanović was sworn in March 1994.

SPS soon formed the Left Coalition with ND and the Yugoslav Left (JUL), a far-left political party headed by Milošević&#x27;s wife Mirjana Marković, to contest the parliamentary elections for the federal parliament in November 1996. The Left Coalition emerged with 64 out of 108 seats in the election. SPS was accused of falsifying votes in cities such as Belgrade and Niš in the 1996 local elections. The Electoral Commission also invalidated the results. This led to mass protests that were organised up until February 1997, when SPS ultimately accepted the defeat. Milošević, who was constitutionally limited to two terms as president of Serbia, was elected president of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in July 1997, shortly before the general elections in Serbia. SPS took part with ND and JUL under the Left Coalition banner and won 110 seats in the National Assembly. ND declined to join the government and the coalition was subsequently disintegrated after SPS and JUL formed a government with SRS. In the presidential election, SPS nominated Zoran Lilić, although the election ended up being annulled as the election&#x27;s turnout was less than 50%. This led to another presidential election which was held in December 1997; Milan Milutinović, the SPS-nominated candidate, won in the second round of the election.

The new SPS-led government was faced with the Kosovo War which ended up making a major impact on SPS. SPO joined the SPS-led federal government in January 1999. Vuk Drašković, the leader of SPO, supported the proposed Rambouillet Agreement, though Milošević declined to sign it, which ultimately led to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Additionally, SPS and SPO entered into a conflict after the assassination of journalist Slavko Ćuruvija, which led to dismissal of SPO from the federal government. In the same year, Milošević proposed constitutional changes to the federal parliament to allow him to run for another term in the 2000 election; the amendments were passed by the parliament. Otpor, a student resistance movement formed in October 1998, and the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), a wide alliance of opposition parties formed in January 2000, called for early elections, though the elections ended up being organised for September 2000. Milošević faced Vojislav Koštunica, the DOS-nominated candidate, in the presidential election. The Federal Election Committee reported that Milošević placed second although that Koštunica also won less than 50% of the popular vote. Milošević declined to accept the results, which resulted into DOS-organised mass protests that culminated into the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević. Milošević accepted defeat on 5 October 2000, while the Federal Election Committee published actual results on 7 October. Shortly after the elections, SPS, SPO, and DOS agreed to organise a snap parliamentary election in Serbia in December 2000. This parliamentary election, and all subsequent ones, were conducted in a proportional electoral system with only one electoral unit. SPS suffered defeat and only won 37 out of 250 seats in the National Assembly, which put the party in opposition for the first time since its formation in 1990. Following the 2000 elections, Milorad Vučelić formed the Democratic Socialist Party while Zoran Lilić also left and formed the Serbian Social Democratic Party.

=== 2001–2008 ===

Milošević, who was still the president of SPS, was arrested in March 2001 on suspicion of corruption and abuse of power, and was shortly after extradited to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to stand trial for war crimes instead. At the presidential election in September 2002, SPS nominated actor Bata Živojinović; he placed sixth. This election ended up being annulled as the turnout in the second round was less than 50%. This resulted into another presidential election which was held in December 2002; SPS supported Vojislav Šešelj, the leader of SRS. He placed second in the presidential election, which ended up being annulled again as the turnout was less than 50%. At a party congress in January 2003, Ivica Dačić, a reformist within SPS, was elected president of the party&#x27;s main board. It was reported that Milošević subsequently demanded his exclusion of the party, although Dačić denied this. Another presidential election was held in November 2003 which SPS ended up boycotting. A month later, SPS took part in a snap parliamentary election in which it won 22 seats; the drop in popularity occurred due to their voters shifting towards SRS. SPS ended up serving as confidence and supply to Koštunica&#x27;s government in the National Assembly. In 2004, the 50% turnout rule for presidential elections was abolished, after which SPS nominated Dačić as their presidential candidate for the 2004 presidential election; he placed fifth.

After the death of Milošević in March 2006, a conflict between Dačić and Vučelić emerged regarding who would continue leading the party. At the party congress in December 2006, Dačić was officially elected president of SPS, after previously serving as the party&#x27;s de facto leader since 2003. In the parliamentary election that was held in January 2007, SPS dropped to 16 seats in the National Assembly, after which SPS returned to opposition. A year later, SPS nominated Milutin Mrkonjić, the party&#x27;s deputy president, as its candidate in the presidential election. Mrkonjić campaigned on social issues and issues regarding the economy, insisting that SPS is &quot;the true party of the left&quot; and that Serbia should join the European Union. He placed fourth, winning 6% of the popular vote. SPS shortly after formed a coalition with United Serbia (JS) and Party of United Pensioners of Serbia (PUPS) which took part in the snap parliamentary election in May 2008. The coalition won 20 seats, 12 of which went to SPS alone. Initially, SPS negotiated with SRS, Democratic Party of Serbia, and New Serbia to form a government, however SPS ended up abandoning those negotiations in favour of those with the For a European Serbia coalition, which was led by DS. The DS–SPS coalition government was sworn in July 2008, with Dačić serving as first deputy prime minister while Slavica Đukić Dejanović became the president of the National Assembly.

=== 2009–2014 ===

While in government, SPS was faced with challenges regarding the Kosovo declaration of independence and the global financial crisis, which led to low rates of economic growth. Additionally, SPS signed a reconciliation agreement with its government partner DS, although clashes between the parties had continued to occur even after the agreement. Further, protests that were organised in 2011 led Boris Tadić, the president of Serbia, to call snap elections for 2012. During the 2012 campaign period, SPS campaigned with JS and PUPS, with Dačić being their joint presidential candidate. He campaigned on workers&#x27; rights, free education, and ending neoliberalism, as well as rising wages and pensions, while SPS also campaigned on criticising post-Milošević governments. In the parliamentary election, the coalition led by SPS won 44 seats in the National Assembly, while SPS alone won 25. Dačić placed third in the presidential election, winning 15% of the popular vote. After the announcement that Tomislav Nikolić, the leader of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), had won the presidential election, Dačić abandoned the coalition with DS and pursued to form a government with SNS instead. This resulted into Dačić becoming the prime minister of Serbia in July 2012.

As prime minister, Dačić worked on normalisation between Serbia and Kosovo, which was formalised under the Brussels Agreement in April 2013. His government was re-shuffled on his order in September 2013, after which SPS and SNS continued to govern alone without the United Regions of Serbia. However, president Nikolić called for snap parliamentary elections to be held in March 2014. SPS took part in the election with JS and PUPS and campaigned on the protection of workers, peasants, and pensioners. They won 44 seats in the National Assembly, while their coalition partner, SNS, won 158 seats in total. SPS remained in government, although Dačić was succeeded by Aleksandar Vučić, the leader of SNS, as prime minister of Serbia. At a party congress in December 2014, SPS adopted its new logo.

=== 2015–present ===
Throughout of 2015, it was discussed whether a snap parliamentary election would occur. This was confirmed in January 2016, when a parliamentary election was announced to be held in April 2016. Following the announcement, PUPS left the SPS–JS coalition and joined the one that was led by SNS, while SPS and JS formalised a coalition with the Greens of Serbia (Zeleni). The SPS-led ballot list also included Joška Broz, the leader of the Communist Party and the grandson of Josip Broz Tito. This coalition won 29 seats in the National Assembly, 21 out of which were occupied by SPS. Following the election, SPS agreed to again serve as a junior member in the SNS-led coalition government, which was inaugurated in August 2016. SPS did not take part in the 2017 presidential election and instead it supported Vučić, who ended up winning 56% of the popular vote in the first round of the election. His election as president was followed by mass protests.

At the end of 2018, a series of anti-government protests began and they lasted until March 2020. During this period, the opposition Alliance for Serbia announced that it would boycott the 2020 parliamentary elections. This led the SPS-led coalition to win 32 seats, despite getting less votes than in the 2016 election. SPS offered to continue its cooperation with the SNS-led coalition, which now had 188 out of 250 seats in the National Assembly. SPS remained in government with SNS after the election, while Dačić, who had been the first deputy prime minister of Serbia since 2014, became the president of the National Assembly in October 2020. Dačić presided over the dialogues to improve election conditions from May to October 2021. SPS affirmed its position to continue its support for SNS after these dialogues, while in January 2022, SPS announced that it would support Vučić in the 2022 presidential election. In the parliamentary election, SPS took part in a coalition with JS and Zeleni, while it campaigned on greater cooperation with China and Russia. It won 31 seats in total, 22 out of which went to SPS, while Vučić won 60% of the popular vote in the presidential election. SPS agreed to continue governing with SNS after the election, which led to Dačić being re-appointed as first deputy prime minister in October 2022.

After Vučić announced the formation of the People&#x27;s Movement for the State in March 2023, Dačić has affirmed that it could bring &quot;a new, even higher stage of cooperation between SNS and SPS&quot;. However, a faction opposed to joining the movement was formed inside SPS with individuals, such as vice-president Predrag J. Marković who has said that &quot;SPS would lose its identity if it joins the movement&quot;. Despite this, SPS again formed an electoral alliance with JS and Zeleni for the early 2023 parliamentary election. SPS suffered from defeat in the elections, only winning 12 seats as part of the SPS-led coalition. Dačić expressed his willingness of electing a new president of SPS, however, the main board of SPS expressed its support for Dačić to remain president of SPS and to continue the cooperation with SNS. In an unprecedent move, SPS formed a joint electoral list with SNS for the 2024 Belgrade City Assembly election. Their electoral list won 52 percent of the popular vote and 64 out of 110 seats in the City Assembly of Belgrade.

== Ideology and platform ==
=== Milošević era ===
SPS adopted its first political programme in October 1990, which had the intention to develop &quot;Serbia as a socialist republic, founded on law and social justice&quot;. The party made economic reforms outside of Marxist ideology such as recognising all forms of property and intended a progression to a market economy while at the same time advocating some regulation for the purposes of &quot;solidarity, equality, and social security&quot;. While in power, SPS enacted policies that were negative towards workers&#x27; rights, while beginning in 1992, SPS moved its support towards a mixed economy with both public and private sectors. SPS maintained connections with trade unions, although independent trade unions faced hostility and their activities were brutalised by the police. During Milošević&#x27;s era, SPS was positioned on the left-wing on the political spectrum, and was associated with anti-liberalism. SPS declared itself to be a &quot;democratic socialist party&quot; and &quot;the follower of the ideas of Svetozar Marković, Dimitrije Tucović, and the Serbian Social Democratic Party&quot;. Political scientists Heinz Timmermann and Luke March, and Marko Stojić, a Metropolitan University Prague lecturer, associated SPS during Milošević&#x27;s era with nationalist form of populism. Political scientist Jean-Pierre Cabestan noted that SPS thrived on the growth of nationalism, but was not nationalist itself, and instead associated SPS with communism. Mirjana Prošić-Dvornić, an ethnologist, noted that SPS &quot;usurped the nationalist rhetoric of opposition parties&quot;. Janusz Bugajski, a political scientist, described SPS as nationalist, but also noted that it never identified as such. Warren Zimmermann, the last United States ambassador to Yugoslavia, argued that Milošević was &quot;not a genuine nationalist but an opportunist&quot;.

SPS nominally endorsed the principle of full equality of all the Yugoslav peoples and ethnic minorities, while it was also supportive of Yugoslavism. Up until 1993, it supported Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia who wished to remain in Yugoslavia. As Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence, the involvement by SPS as a ruling party had become more devoted to helping external Serbs run their own independent entities. Milošević denied that the government of Serbia helped Serb military forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, instead stating that they had the right to self-determination; Jović stated in a 1995 &quot;BBC&quot; documentary that Milošević endorsed the transfer of Bosnian Serb federal army forces to the Bosnian Serb Army in 1992 to help achieve Serb independence from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Though shortly before the Dayton Agreement in 1995, SPS began to oppose the government of Republika Srpska, which was headed by Radovan Karadžić. The opposition accused SPS of authoritarianism, as well as personal profiteering from illegal business transactions in the arms trade, cigarettes and oil; this illegal business was caused by the UN sanctions, and none of accusations for personal profiteering were ever proven at the court. Political scientists Nebojša Vladisavljević, Karmen Erjavec, and Florian Bieber also described Milošević&#x27;s rule as authoritarian. Independent media during the SPS administration received threats and high fines.

=== Dačić era ===
After Dačić came to power, SPS shifted towards democratic socialism, and then to social democracy in the 2010s. Although SPS is still affiliated and has promoted populist rhetoric, its nationalist image has softened. It is now positioned on the centre-left on the political spectrum. Prior to mid-2000s, SPS was Eurosceptic and it also promoted anti-globalist and anti-Western sentiment. It also promoted anti-imperialist criticism towards the European Union and NATO. Since then, SPS had adopted its support for the accession of Serbia to the European Union, and a more pro-European image after it came back to government in 2008, which scholars Nataša Jovanović Ajzenhamer and Haris Dajč described as rather pragmatic. Besides this, SPS has also been also described as pro-Russian.

=== Demographic characteristics ===
Before the federal parliamentary election in December 1992, the Institute of Social Studies polled that a majority of SPS supporters preferred a citizen state over a nation state. According to political scientist Dragomir Pantić, supporters of SPS in the early 2000s were mostly elderly people, traditionalists, and those without higher education. In comparison with its demographic from the 1990s, the percentage of workers and farmers increased amongst its base in the 2000s. According to a CeSID opinion poll from 2005, SPS supporters consisted of unskilled and semi-skilled workers.

In 2007, political scientist Srećko Mihailović noted that most of the SPS supporters saw themselves on the far-left, that 19 percent of them saw themselves on the left-wing, while 8 percent only saw themselves as centre-left. According to CeSID in 2008, a majority of supporters of the SPS–PUPS–JS coalition were Eurosceptics. In 2014, CeSID and National Democratic Institute polled that 59 percent of SPS supporters were women and that 58 percent of all SPS supporters were 50 years old or older. However, by 2016 a majority of the supporters were over 60 years old. The Heinrich Böll Foundation conducted a research in November 2020 in which most SPS supporters were against the accession of Serbia to the European Union, preferred closer relations with Russia instead, and wanted to implement laws to preserve patriarchal family values.

== Organisation ==
The current president of SPS is Dačić, who was most recently re-elected in December 2022, while the current vice-presidents are Aleksandar Antić, Branko Ružić, Dušan Bajatović, Novica Tončev, Predrag J. Marković, Slavica Đukić Dejanović, Đorđe Milićević, and Žarko Obradović. The president of its parliamentary group is Snežana Paunović. The headquarters of SPS is located at Bulevar Mihajla Pupina 6 in Belgrade. It has a youth wing named Socialist Youth and a women&#x27;s wing named Women&#x27;s Forum.

Its membership from its foundation in 1990 to 1997 involved many elements of the social strata of Serbia, including state administrators and business management elites of state-owned enterprises, employees in the state-owned sector, less privileged groups of farmers, and the unemployed and pensioners. From 1998 to 2000, its membership included &quot;apparatchiks&quot; at administrative and judicial levels, the &quot;nouveau riche&quot;, whose business success was founded solely from their affiliation with the government, and top army and police officials and a large majority of the police force. In 2011, SPS reported to have had 120,000 members, while in 2014 SPS stated that they had around 200,000 members. SPS reported to have 65,000 members in 2015. In 2016, it was reported that SPS had 195,000 members.

=== International cooperation ===
SPS cooperated with Momir Bulatović in Montenegro and the parties he led, while in Bosnia and Herzegovina SPS used to cooperate with Karadžić&#x27;s Serb Democratic Party and with the Socialist Party. SPS cooperates with Syriza, a political party in Greece. Following the 2008 elections, SPS sent an application to join the Socialist International while Dačić also met with its then-president George Papandreou. However, the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina opposed this move and called for its application to be declined, while Jelko Kacin, a Liberal Democracy of Slovenia politician, claimed that Tadić blocked SPS from joining the Socialist International. Its candidature has not yet been accepted, although SPS also seeks associate member status in the Party of European Socialists. In the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, SPS is represented by Dunja Simonović Bratić, who sits in the Socialists, Democrats and Greens Group.

<text>The Serbian Radical Party (, abbr. SRS) is a far-right, ultranationalist political party in Serbia. Founded in 1991, its co-founder, first and only leader is Vojislav Šešelj.

The SRS was founded in 1991 as a merger of the Serbian Chetnik Movement, led by Šešelj, and the People&#x27;s Radical Party, led by Tomislav Nikolić. Upon formation, they became the president and deputy president of SRS respectively. During the first half of the 1990s the SRS supported the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia regime, which had contributed greatly to the rise of SRS through the use of media. The party had strong support until the 2000 election, when SRS suffered a major defeat, but through populist rhetoric it became the most voted party in the early-to-mid 2000s. Šešelj voluntarily surrendered to the ICTY to defend himself against charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity that he was alleged to have committed during the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War. Nikolić assumed &quot;de facto&quot; party leadership until he left the party in 2008.

During the years of Nikolić&#x27;s leadership, SRS blended ultranationalism with brash, populist, and anti-corruption rhetoric. Due to disagreements with Šešelj over European Union integration, Nikolić took many of the high-ranking members of the party to form the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), which became the ruling party of Serbia in 2012. After the split, Dragan Todorović assumed &quot;de facto&quot; leadership, and the party went into a major decline, only pulling 4% of the vote in 2012 and 2% in 2014, the first time that SRS was not represented in the parliament. Shortly after Šešelj&#x27;s return to Serbia in 2014, the party gained back some of its popularity and it placed third with 8% of the vote in the 2016 election. In late 2019, the party went into decline again, and in the 2020 election it ended up only with 2% of the vote and gaining no seats in the parliament again.

A right-wing populist party, SRS supports the creation of a Greater Serbia. It is Eurosceptic, anti-Western orientated, opposed to the accession of Serbia to the European Union and supports establishing closer ties with Russia instead. Some journalists described SRS as neofascist in the 1990s due to its vocal support of ultranationalism. Regarding social issues, SRS is traditionalist. It also holds local branches in some of the neighbouring states.

== Ideology ==
The party&#x27;s core ideology is based on Serbian nationalism and the goal of creating a Greater Serbia. The party is also strongly opposed to European integration (euroscepticism) and globalisation, advocating closer ties with Russia instead. The SRS is extremely critical of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), where Šešelj was incarcerated from 2003 to 2014. The party regards former general Ratko Mladić and former Republika Srpska president Radovan Karadžić as &quot;Serbian heroes&quot;.

In 2007, the party advocated the use of military force to prevent the independence of Kosovo.

Due to Tomislav Nikolić&#x27;s support for the accession of Serbia to the European Union conflicting with the party&#x27;s original hardline policy, Nikolić was expelled in 2008. With his supporters breaking apart from the SRS, he founded the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) which succeeded the SRS as one of the country&#x27;s leading parties.

In the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, SRS was briefly associated with the Free Democrats Group in 2019.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===

The Serbian Radical Party (SRS) was formed on 23 February 1991 by the merger of Vojislav Šešelj&#x27;s Serbian Chetnik Movement (SČP) and the People&#x27;s Radical Party (NRS). The SČP had been formed in 1990, although it was denied official registration due to its overt identification with the historical Chetniks. Formation of the new party followed Šešelj&#x27;s breakaway from the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) due to internal quarrels with Vuk Drašković; the SPO having been founded by the merger of Šešelj&#x27;s former Serbian Freedom Movement and Drašković&#x27;s faction from the Serbian National Renewal. Šešelj was chosen as the first president of the SRS while Tomislav Nikolić, a member of the NRS, became deputy president.

=== Rise under SPS ===
Led by Milošević, the Socialist Party (SPS) contributed greatly to the rise of the SRS through its use of the media. With the SRS allowed to promulgate its ultranationalist views on state television, the SPS could present itself as a comparatively moderate, yet still patriotic party. Šešelj promoted popular notions of an &quot;international conspiracy against the Serbs,&quot; the foremost of which involved Germany, the Vatican, the CIA, Italy, Turkey, as well as the centrist Serbian political parties. Such conspiracy theories were also promoted by Milošević-controlled media. In 1991, Šešelj became a Member of Parliament as an independent candidate, and created a belligerent image by engaging in physical fights with opponents of the government.

The 22.6% of the vote won by the SRS in the 1992 parliamentary election confirmed the party&#x27;s rapid rise and made it the second largest parliamentary party. Šešelj campaigned for the election on issues such as driving Albanians out of Kosovo to Albania, expelling Muslims from Sandžak, and forcing the Croats out of Vojvodina. Having helped engineer the party&#x27;s election to parliament, the SPS formed an informal coalition with the SRS, and collaborated on ousting moderate politicians from public office.

=== Milošević breaks with SRS ===
By late 1993 the parties had turned against each other. Milošević saw it necessary to change his policies and distance himself from the SRS in order for his new peacemaking orientation to be taken seriously by the West, as well as to counter the effects of United Nations sanctions against the country. Many socialists also feared competition from the party based on its strong growth record. As discord erupted among the opposition including the SRS, Milošević called new elections in 1993. These cut SRS support almost in half, while the SPS increased its share of the vote from 28% to 38%. Although most people had grown tired of the wars, UN sanctions and the catastrophic economic situation, the SRS had also been subjected to powerful state propaganda and exclusion by the media. Following Milošević&#x27;s agreement to the Dayton accords in 1995 to bring peace to Bosnia, Šešelj denounced Milošević as &quot;the worst traitor in Serbian history&quot;, and likened the event to Serbia&#x27;s greatest defeat since the Battle of Kosovo fought against the Ottoman Empire in 1389.

In 1995, Šešelj and the SRS joined in a technical coalition with the centrist Democratic Party (DS) and the conservative Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS). This gave Šešelj a degree of democratic legitimacy, although the coalition withered away by the end of the same year.

=== Kosovo war and Milošević&#x27;s overthrow ===
When Šešelj beat the SPS candidate for the 1997 presidential election, despite the contest being declared invalid due to low turnout, he was again brought into the Serbian government. In 1998 the SRS and SPO entered the so-called &quot;war&quot; government, and as Deputy Prime Minister, Šešelj passed new information laws and helped launch propaganda offensives against Kosovo Albanians. U.S. officials in turn branded him a &quot;fascist&quot;, while the U.S. Department of State declared that they would never deal with him. Following the 1999 NATO occupation of Kosovo, Šešelj resigned from government until his party was enticed to re-enter the administration by the SPS. As the party had held posts under Milošević&#x27;s regime, it was excluded from the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), and suffered a major defeat in the 2000 parliamentary election when Milošević was ousted.

=== Indictment of Šešelj ===
During the Yugoslav Wars some SRS supporters including Šešelj were active in paramilitary units loyal to the federal government, serving as his &quot;iron fist&quot; during military campaigns. Milošević&#x27;s regime at times supported Šešelj and provided him with arms, whilst at others it accused him of war crimes. The SRS was also provided with resources to establish paramilitary volunteer forces such as the White Eagles. As the SRS protested against Milošević&#x27;s extradition to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 2001, Milošević urged his supporters to vote for the SRS rather than his own SPS. The ICTY also indicted Šešelj, who has been on trial since 2007 following his surrender in 2003. Deputy President Nikolić became the new &quot;de facto&quot; SRS leader and presented a more moderate face, with a new approach to international cooperation and a vision of Serbia acting as a &quot;link between the West and the East.&quot;

=== Nikolić leadership ===
During the 2003 parliamentary election, the SRS condemned cooperation with the war crimes tribunal, corruption scandals in government, poor living standards, and slightly moderated its formerly aggressive rhetoric. While it won a clear plurality with 28% of the vote and 82 seats, the party was still viewed as a pariah by its democratic rivals and was thus left in opposition. In the 2007 parliamentary election it won 29% of the vote and 81 seats. The SRS caucus in parliament elected Nikolić as its president and Aleksandar Vučić vice-president. Nikolić was later chosen as parliamentary speaker, supported by the DSS amidst a deadlock in coalition talks. He stepped down just five days later, as the DS and DSS agreed to form a coalition government.

At the National Assembly&#x27;s first session on 14 February 2007, politicians voted overwhelmingly to reject the proposal by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari on the preliminary resolution of the status of Kosovo. New elections were called in 2008 as the DS-DSS coalition collapsed due to EU recognition of Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence. In the 2008 parliamentary election the SRS again won 29% of the vote, and 78 seats, leading to the formation of a DS-SPS-led government coalition. The party also won 17 seats in the Kosovska Mitrovica-based Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija consisting of Kosovan Serb municipalities who defied Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence.

=== 2008 split ===
After disagreements with Šešelj, on 8 September 2008, Nikolić formed the new parliamentary group &quot;Napred Srbijo!&quot; (&quot;Forward Serbia!&quot;) along with a number of other SRS members. Šešelj responded with a letter on 11 September addressed to SRS members, in which he condemned the Nikolić group as &quot;traitors&quot; and &quot;Western puppets&quot;, while calling on SRS members to remain loyal to the ideologies of &quot;Serbian nationalism, anti-globalism, and Russophilia.&quot; Nikolić and his group were officially expelled from the SRS the next day, in response to which Nikolić announced that he would form his own party. On 14 September, SRS general secretary Aleksandar Vučić also resigned from the SRS. Nikolić and Vučić then launched the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) on 21 October of the same year.

Following their departure, Dragan Todorović took over as the party&#x27;s acting leader from Nikolić; however the office of deputy chairman was officially abolished. By April 2011 the SRS had about 7% of support in opinion polls, while the SNS and its coalition partners held about 40%. In the 2012 parliamentary election the Radical Party received only 4.63% of the popular vote, thus failing to cross the 5% threshold to enter parliament for the first time in the party&#x27;s history.

=== Šešelj&#x27;s return ===
With their leader back in Serbia in 2014, the party campaigned for the parliamentary election of 2016 aiming to restore its presence prior to 2008. They received 8.34% of the popular vote and gained back 22 seats. In the 2020 parliamentary election, the SRS received 2.22% of the votes, thus failing to get above the new 3% threshold and lost all their seats. In the following elections, they did not receive enough votes to cross the electoral threshold.

The party formed an alliance with the ruling Serbian Progressive Party to contest the 2023 Belgrade City Assembly election. This announcement caused attention in national media. In the 2024 Belgrade City Assembly election, the party gained 2 seats whilst being with the ruling SNS coalition. During the 2024 local election, the SRS cooperated with the SNS coalition.

== International relations ==
The Serbian Radical Party maintains ties with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and had ties with the French National Front party in the 1990s. The SRS also has minimal ties with the far-right Golden Dawn party in Greece, focusing on religious similarities, and the Forza Nuova party in Italy.

The party counted Iraq&#x27;s Saddam Hussein and the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party as one of its political and financial backers until the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as the parties found common cause in defiance of the United States. Similar sentiment led the party to back Libya&#x27;s Muammar Gaddafi following the 2011 military intervention in Libya by NATO. Serbia and Libya had maintained good relations since Gaddafi vocally opposed NATO intervention in Serbia in the 1990s, while he also backed Serbia&#x27;s opposition to Kosovo&#x27;s independence. The SRS has also expressed support for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad following the Syrian Civil War. Šešelj advocates for a neutral position on the Israel-Palestine conflict, balancing Serbia&#x27;s strong relations with both countries.

On 9 March 2016 Šešelj and Zmago Jelinčič, president of the Slovenian National Party, signed an agreement with the intention of bringing their parties closer in terms of partnership and political alliance.

<doc id="417438" wikidata="Q332528" url="?curid=417438" title="Winston Churchill (1940–2010)">
<text>Winston Spencer Churchill (10 October 1940 – 2 March 2010), generally known as Winston Churchill, was an English Conservative politician and a grandson of British prime minister Winston Churchill. During the period of his prominence as a public figure, he was normally referred to as Winston Churchill , in order to distinguish him from his grandfather. His father Randolph Churchill was also an MP and his mother Pamela Harriman was the United States Ambassador to France.

==Early life==
Churchill was born on 10 October 1940 at Chequers, Buckinghamshire, England, five months after his grandfather became Prime Minister, a year into the Second World War. He was educated at Ludgrove, Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford. His famous grandfather died in 1965, and his father died three years afterwards.

== Career as a journalist ==

Before becoming a Member of Parliament he was a journalist, notably in the Middle East during the Six-Day War, during which time he met numerous Israeli politicians, including Moshe Dayan. He also published a book recounting the war. During the 1960s he covered conflicts in Yemen and Borneo as well as the Vietnam War. He visited Czechoslovakia in 1968 to record the Prague Spring, and when, that same year, in the wake of public assassinations, the Democratic National Convention was held at Chicago, he was attacked by the police.

In the early 1970s at Biafra, Nigeria, he witnessed both war and famine, and the indiscriminate bombing of civilians was an outrage to him. He reported in further trouble spots including Communist China, and in Portugal during the Carnation Revolution. Like other members of his family, he began a lecture tour of the United States.

In 1965, he became a member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.

== Political career ==
Churchill was not able to take up his grandfather&#x27;s parliamentary seat at Woodford in Essex when he stepped down at the 1964 general election, three months before his death at the age of 90. However, he was at the centre of the Conservative campaign: despite being quite inexperienced in politics, he had been appointed as Edward Heath&#x27;s personal assistant. Heath, who was already a senior cabinet minister, was elected party leader the following year after the resignation of Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who lost the general election to Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour Party.

Churchill&#x27;s first attempt to enter Parliament was at the 1967 Manchester Gorton by-election. In spite of the unpopularity of the incumbent Labour government, he lost, but only by 577 votes. He was still a journalist with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; when his father died in 1968; the paper&#x27;s proprietor, Lord Hartwell, took the decision to employ Martin Gilbert to continue the work on the former Prime Minister&#x27;s biography that Randolph had started.

Churchill became Member of Parliament for the constituency of Stretford, near Manchester, at the 1970 general election. As an MP he was a member of the parliamentary ski team and chairman of the Commons Flying Club. He became a friend of Julian Amery MP, who as Minister for Housing and Construction at the Department of the Environment, appointed him his Parliamentary Private Secretary. Churchill was not much interested in the mundane questions of housing, however, and doing as little as possible, took questions to the House from civil servants. Transferred to the Foreign Office with Amery, he became very outspoken on issues in the Middle East and on the Communist Bloc. After he attempted to question Alec Douglas-Home&#x27;s abilities as Foreign Secretary, he was forced to resign in November 1973, just over three months before the Conservatives lost power to Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour Party for the second time in a decade.

Churchill resumed his great-grandfather Lord Randolph Churchill&#x27;s precedent of protecting Ulster Unionism, defending the Diplock Courts, internment and arguing for the death penalty for terrorists. He was part of a group of Conservative MPs of the era (including Margaret Thatcher) who were heavily critical of BBC coverage of the conflict in Northern Ireland as expressing communist sympathies, for which some journalists were sacked.

As a frontbench spokesman on defence policy, he took a hard line on Rhodesia, voting against any sanctions. His presentation at the despatch box was strident for the times; he was censured by the Speaker for calling Foreign Secretary David Owen &quot;treacherous&quot; over the abandonment of Rhodesia. Thatcher, who succeeded Edward Heath as Conservative leader in 1975, dismissed Churchill from the Conservative front bench in November 1978. However, when the Conservatives came to power in the election of May 1979 he was elected to the executive of the 1922 Committee.

Boundary changes that took effect at the 1983 general election made his seat more marginal (it was subsequently taken by the Labour Party), and he transferred to the nearby Davyhulme constituency, which he represented until the seat was abolished for the 1997 general election. Although well known by virtue of his family history, he never achieved high office and remained a backbencher. His cousin, Nicholas Soames, was first elected a Conservative MP in 1983 and remained in Parliament until 2019.

During his time as a Member of Parliament, Churchill visited Beijing with a delegation of other MPs, including Clement Freud, a grandson of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Freud asked why Churchill was given the best room in the hotel, and was told it was because Churchill was a grandson of Britain&#x27;s most illustrious Prime Minister. Freud responded by saying it was the first time in his life that he had been &quot;out-grandfathered&quot;. After the 1990–91 Gulf War, Churchill visited British troops in the desert. When he introduced himself to a soldier, the soldier replied &quot;Yes, and I&#x27;m Rommel&quot;, highlighting, as his father had told him, the comparative disadvantage in his name. He was the subject of controversy in 1995 when he and his family sold a large archive of his grandfather&#x27;s papers for £12.5m to Churchill College, Cambridge. The purchase was funded by a grant from the newly established National Lottery.

After leaving Parliament at the 1997 election (his Davyhulme seat having been abolished), Churchill was a sought-after speaker on the lecture circuit, and wrote many articles in support of the Iraq War and the fight against Islamic terrorism. He also edited a compilation of his grandfather&#x27;s famous speeches entitled &quot;Never Give In&quot;. In 2007, he acted as a spokesman for the pressure group UK National Defence Association. He was also involved with the National Benevolent Fund for the Aged, as trustee from 1974 and chair from 1995 to 2010. He attempted to be selected as an MEP, but was unsuccessful.

==Family==
Churchill was the son of Randolph Churchill (1911–1968), the only son of Sir Winston Churchill, and his first wife Pamela Digby (1920–1997). His parents divorced in 1945. His father married June Osborne: their daughter was Arabella Churchill (1949–2007). His mother married W. Averell Harriman, former United States ambassador to the United Kingdom. Churchill&#x27;s first marriage, in July 1964, was to Mary &quot;Minnie&quot; Caroline d&#x27;Erlanger, the daughter of the banker Sir Gerard John Regis d&#x27;Erlanger and granddaughter of Baron Emile Beaumont d&#x27;Erlanger. The couple had four children, including a son named Randolph. Churchill&#x27;s second marriage, to Luce Engelen, a Belgian-born jewellery maker, lasted from 1997 until his death.

===Ancestry===
== Death ==

Churchill lived in Belgravia, London, where he died aged 69 on 2 March 2010 from prostate cancer, from which he had suffered for the last two years of his life. On 9 March, he was buried in the family plot at St Martin’s Church in Bladon, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire.
