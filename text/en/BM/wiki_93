<text>The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) T-45 Goshawk is a highly modified version of the British BAE Systems Hawk land-based training jet aircraft. Manufactured by McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) and British Aerospace (now BAE Systems), the T-45 is used by the United States Navy as an aircraft carrier-capable trainer.

==Development==
===Background===
The T-45 Goshawk has its origins in the mid-1970s, during which time the U.S. Navy formally commenced its search for a new jet trainer aircraft to serve as a single replacement for both its T-2 Buckeye and TA-4 Skyhawk trainers. During 1978, the VTXTS advanced trainer program to meet this need was formally launched by the U.S. Navy. An Anglo-American team, comprising British aviation manufacturer British Aerospace (BAe) and American aircraft company McDonnell Douglas (MDC), decided to submit their proposal for a navalised version of BAe&#x27;s land-based Hawk trainer. Other manufacturers also submitted bids, such as a rival team of French aircraft company Dassault Aviation, German manufacturer Dornier and American aerospace company Lockheed, who offered their Alpha Jet to fulfil the requirement.

The VTX-TS competition was not simply for the procurement of an aircraft in isolation; it comprised five core areas: the aircraft itself, capable flight simulators, matured academic training aids, integrated logistic support, and program management. For their proposal, MDC was the prime contractor and systems integrator, BAe functioned as the principal subcontractor and partner for the aircraft element, Rolls-Royce provided the Adour engine to power the aircraft, and Sperry is the principal subcontractor for the simulator system. During November 1981, the U.S. Navy announced that it had selected the Hawk as the winner of the VTX-TS competition. Reportedly, approximately 60 per cent of the work on the T-45 program was undertaken overseas in Britain. During September 1982, a Full Scale Engineering Development contract was awarded to the MDC team to fully develop and produce the proposed aircraft, which had been designated &quot;T-45 Goshawk&quot;. On 16 April 1988, the first T-45A Goshawk conducted its maiden flight.

===Production===
Work on the production of the Goshawk was divided between the two primary partner companies. BAE Systems (BAe&#x27;s successor following its merger with Marconi Electronic Systems during 1999) was responsible for manufacturing the fuselage aft of the cockpit, along with the air inlets, and the vertical stabilizer of the T-45 at their Samlesbury facility, while the wings were produced at the company&#x27;s plant at Brough, England. Boeing (which had merged with McDonnell Douglas during 1997) performed the manufacture of the remaining elements of the Goshawk, as well as conducting assembly of the type at a production line at St. Louis, Missouri, after having transferred work on the program from the company&#x27;s facility in Long Beach, California.

The Goshawk retained the typical powerplant used by the Hawk, the Rolls-Royce Adour turbofan jet engine. During the mid-1990s, Rolls-Royce worked on establishing a US-based production line for the Adour engine, which was to be operated by the former Allison Engine Company (which had been recently acquired by Rolls-Royce in 1995); however, during September 1997, the U.S. Navy chose to terminate the partially-finished engine effort. Around this time, the U.S. Navy was greatly interested in potentially adopting another powerplant, the International Turbine Engine Company&#x27;s F124 turbofan engine, for the Goshawk. On 7 October 1996, a T-45A test aircraft flew, powered by the rival F124 engine.

Early production aircraft were designated &quot;T-45A&quot;. From December 1997 onwards, later-built production Goshawks were constructed with enhanced avionics systems, which included the adoption of a glass cockpit and head-up display (HUD); as such, they were designated &quot;T-45C&quot;. From 2003 onwards, all of the extant T-45A trainer aircraft were eventually converted to the more modern T-45C configuration under the T-45 Required Avionics Modernization Program. This program brought the U.S. Navy&#x27;s trainers to an identical &quot;Cockpit 21&quot; standard, which incorporated both the HUD and the glass cockpit, which had the benefit of making the trainers more similar to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s frontline fighter aircraft. On 16 March 2007, it was announced that the 200th Goshawk had been delivered to the U.S. Navy. During November 2009, the 221st aircraft, the final aircraft to be produced, was delivered.

===Further development===
During early 2008, it was announced by the US Navy that several of its T-45C Goshawks would be outfitted with a synthetic radar capability to allow them to support rear crew training requirements, and that it was considering a possible requirement for a follow-on order for such equipped models of the type. An initial batch of 19 T-45Cs equipped with this virtual mission training system (VMTS), which simulates the capabilities of the US Navy&#x27;s Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet&#x27;s Raytheon APG-73 radar (including ground mapping, air-to-ground and air-to-air targeting modes, along with an electronic warfare training capability) were delivered to the Navy&#x27;s Undergraduate Military Flight Officer training school at Pensacola, Florida. The type was used to prepare weapon system and electronic warfare operators for the Super Hornet and the Boeing EA-18G Growler.

Both McDonnell Douglas and Boeing have made multiple approaches to potential overseas customers, typically offering the Goshawk in the trainer role. During the mid-1990s, McDonnell Douglas teamed up with Rockwell International to jointly bid the T-45 as a replacement for the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s jet trainer fleet in competition against, amongst others, the Hawk that the type had been derived from. Marketing efforts to acquire export customers were intensified following a cut in the procurement rate by the U.S. Navy during 2003; according to Lon Nordeen, T-45 business development manager, Israel had been identified as having a potential requirement for the type. During late 2006, the company promoted the concept of an advanced variant of the T-45C Goshawk to Greece, emphasising its close compatibility with the Beechcraft T-6A Texan II trainer already operated by the country. During early 2007, Boeing VP Mark Kronenberg stated that the company had held discussions with the Indian Navy, which had an anticipated requirement for naval training aircraft.

Starting in 2003, the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) of the United States Air Force (USAF) worked on the requirements for replacing the 1960s-era Northrop T-38 Talon jet trainer. By 2010, the US Navy was reportedly involved in the evaluations for the initiative, known as the T-X program and had been considering the merits of adopting the same airframe to meet its long-term requirements to eventually replace the Goshawk as well. Reportedly, BAE Systems, later in partnership with American defense company Northrop Grumman, has repeatedly held discussions with the USAF on the development of a new potential derivative of the Hawk conforming to their specific trainer needs, similar in fashion to the Goshawk for the US Navy.

==Design==
The T-45 Goshawk is a carrier-qualified version of the British Aerospace Hawk Mk.60. It was redesigned as a trainer for the United States Navy (USN) and United States Marine Corps (USMC). Changes were made to the Hawk in two stages. The Hawk was redesigned for carrier operations and submitted to the Navy for flight evaluation. The development flight trials resulted in further modifications. 

The initial redesign included stronger landing gear and airframe to withstand the loads imposed by catapult launches and high sink-rate 4.3 m/s (14 ft/sec) landings. A catapult tow bar attachment was added to the oleo strut of the new two-wheel nose gear . Other additions were an arresting hook, an increased span tailplane, side-mounted airbrakes, and the addition of stabilator vanes, known as &#x27;Side Mounted Upper Rear Fuselage Strakes&#x27; (SMURFS - USN), to stabilize flow over the stabilator with speed brakes extended.

Navy test pilots found deficiences which had to be corrected. Some required further external changes: a single ventral fin in front of the arrestor hook, a 6-inch (0.152 m) extension to the tail fin, squared-off wing tips and leading-edge slats.

At the time of the Goshawk&#x27;s selection, the World War II-era USS &quot;Lexington&quot; was the U.S. Navy&#x27;s training carrier. &quot;Lexington&quot;, which featured a 277 m (910 ft) long and 58.5 m (192 ft) wide angled flight deck, complete with a pair of relatively short-stroke steam catapults and similarly short, undamped arrester gear, was a major driving factor for the design of the T-45 in order to suit such operations. The aerodynamic changes of the aircraft, which were developed by BAe at their existing facilities in the United Kingdom, included improvements to the low-speed handling characteristics and a reduction in the approach speed. During flight testing of the Goshawk, it was revealed that the aircraft had retained relatively favourable flight characteristics, even when flown within stall conditions at the required low approach speed.

==Operational history==

The T-45 has been used for intermediate and advanced portions of the Navy/Marine Corps Student Naval Aviator strike pilot training program with Training Air Wing One at Naval Air Station Meridian, Mississippi, and Training Air Wing Two at Naval Air Station Kingsville, Texas. The T-45 replaced the T-2C Buckeye intermediate jet trainer and the TA-4J Skyhawk II advanced jet trainer with an integrated training system that includes the T-45 Goshawk aircraft, operational and instrument flight simulators, academics, and training integration system support. In 2008, the T-45C also began operation in the advanced portion of Navy/Marine Corps Student Naval Flight Officer training track for strike aircraft with Training Air Wing Six at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. A small number of the aircraft is also operated by the Naval Air Systems Command at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland.

The original T-45A, which became operational in 1991, contained an analog cockpit design, while the newer T-45C, which was first delivered in December 1997, features a new digital &quot;glass cockpit&quot; design. All T-45A aircraft currently in operational use are upgraded to T-45C standard. The T-45 is to remain in service until 2035 or later.

In 2017, the USN grounded the T-45 fleet for a three-day &quot;safety pause&quot; after more than 100 instructor pilots refused to fly the aircraft. The pilots cited concerns about incidents of hypoxia that they believed to have resulted from faulty Cobham GGU-7 onboard oxygen-generation systems. Over the past five years physiological episodes linked to problems with the T-45&#x27;s oxygen system have nearly quadrupled, according to testimony from senior naval aviators in April 2017. The grounding order was first extended, but then lifted to allow flights up to a ceiling of 10,000 feet where the Onboard Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS) would not be needed, and to allow instructors to conduct flights above 10,000 feet. The grounding order was fully lifted, along with all restrictions on flight ceiling and student pilots, in August 2017. The T-45 fleet was thereafter upgraded with new sensors to monitor the onboard oxygen systems, as well as a new water separation system, in hopes of reducing hypoxia events and determining the root cause of the problems. By the first quarter of 2018, hypoxia events had returned to nominal levels after peaking in 2016 and 2017. The fleet was later fitted with Cobham&#x27;s revised GGU-25 onboard oxygen generating systems.

In recent years, similar issues have also affected the Navy&#x27;s F/A-18s and the Air Force&#x27;s T-6s, F-22s, and F-35s, some within the same or similar time frames, and the Department of Defense has established a joint command to investigate the issue.

On 14 October 2022, the Navy&#x27;s T-45 fleet was grounded following a low-pressure compressor blade fault being identified during a pre-flight check. The grounding was lifted after two weeks.

==Variants==
;T-45A
:Two-seat basic and advanced jet trainer for the US Navy and US Marine Corps

;T-45B
:Proposed land-based version which would have been essentially a conventional Hawk furnished with a US Navy-spec cockpit and no carrier capability. The US Navy had wanted to procure the T-45B so that trainee pilots could benefit from an earlier training capability, but abandoned the idea during 1984 in favor of less-costly updates to the TA-4J and T-2C.

;T-45C
:Improved T-45A, outfitted with a glass cockpit, inertial navigation, and other improvements. All existing T-45As have been upgraded to the T-45C standard.

;T-45D
:Tentative designation for an envisioned upgrade of the T-45, potentially incorporating various manufacturing improvements and additional equipment, such as helmet-mounted displays.

<doc id="425514" wikidata="Q1756454" url="?curid=425514" title="Art theft">
<text>Art theft, sometimes called artnapping, is the stealing of paintings, sculptures, or other forms of visual art from galleries, museums or other public and private locations. Stolen art is often resold or used by criminals as collateral to secure loans. Only a small percentage of stolen art is recovered—an estimated 10%. Many nations operate police squads to investigate art theft and illegal trade in stolen art and antiquities.

Some famous art theft cases include the robbery of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; from the Louvre in 1911 by employee Vincenzo Peruggia. Another was theft of &quot;The Scream&quot;, stolen from the Munch Museum in 2004, but recovered in 2006. The largest-value art theft occurred at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, when 13 works, worth a combined $500 million were stolen in 1990. The case remains unsolved. Large-scale art thefts include the Nazi looting of Europe during World War II and the Russian looting of Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Individual theft==
Many thieves are motivated by the fact that valuable art pieces are worth millions of dollars and weigh only a few kilograms at most. Also, while most high-profile museums have extremely tight security, many places with multimillion-dollar art collections have disproportionately poor security measures. That makes them susceptible to thefts that are slightly more complicated than a typical smash-and-grab, but offer a huge potential payoff. Thieves sometimes target works based on their own familiarity with the artist, rather than the artist&#x27;s reputation in the art world or the theoretical value of the work.

Unfortunately for the thieves, it is extremely difficult to sell the most famous and valuable works without getting caught, because any interested buyer will almost certainly know the work is stolen and advertising it risks someone contacting the authorities. It is also difficult for the buyer to display the work to visitors without it being recognized as stolen, thus defeating much of the point of owning the art. Many famous works have instead been held for ransom from the legitimate owner or even returned without ransom, due to the lack of black-market customers. Returning for ransom also risks a sting operation.
For those with substantial collections, such as the Marquess of Cholmondeley at Houghton Hall, the risk of theft is neither negligible nor negotiable. Jean-Baptiste Oudry&#x27;s &quot;White Duck &quot; was stolen from the Cholmondeley collection at Houghton Hall in 1990. The canvas is still missing.

==Prevention in museums==
Museums can take numerous measures to prevent the theft of artworks include having enough guides or guards to watch displayed items, avoiding situations where security-camera sightlines are blocked, and fastening paintings to walls with hanging wires that are not too thin and with locks.

=== Art theft education ===
The Smithsonian Institution sponsors the National Conference on Cultural Property Protection, held annually in Washington, D. C. The conference is aimed at professionals in the field of cultural property protection.

Since 1996, the Netherlands-based Museum Security Network has disseminated news and information related to issues of cultural property loss and recovery. Since its founding the Museum Security Network has collected and disseminated over 45,000 reports about incidents with cultural property. The founder of the Museum Security Network, Ton Cremers, is recipient of the National Conference on Cultural Property Protection Robert Burke Award.

2007 saw the foundation of the Association for Research into Crimes against Art (ARCA). ARCA is a nonprofit think tank dedicated principally to raising the profile of art crime (art forgery and vandalism, as well as theft) as an academic subject. Since 2009, ARCA has offered an unaccredited postgraduate certificate program dedicated to this field of study. The Postgraduate Certificate Program in Art Crime and Cultural Heritage Protection is held from June to August every year in Italy. A few American universities, including New York University, also offer courses on art theft.

==Recovery==

In the public sphere, Interpol, the FBI Art Crime Team, London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Art and Antiques Unit, New York Police Department&#x27;s special frauds squad and a number of other law enforcement agencies worldwide maintain &quot;squads&quot; dedicated to investigating thefts of this nature and recovering stolen works of art.

According to Robert King Wittman, a former FBI agent who led the Art Crime Team until his retirement in 2008, the unit is very small compared with similar law-enforcement units in Europe, and most art thefts investigated by the FBI involve agents at local offices who handle routine property theft. &quot;Art and antiquity crime is tolerated, in part, because it is considered a victimless crime,&quot; Wittman said in 2010.

In response to a growing public awareness of art theft and recovery, a number of not-for-profit and private companies now act both to record information about losses and oversee recovery efforts for claimed works of art. Among the most notable are:

* IFAR
* Commission for Looted Art in Europe
* Holocaust Claims Conference
* Art Loss Register
* Art Recovery Group

In January 2017, Spain&#x27;s Interior Ministry announced that police from 18 European countries, with the support of Interpol, Europol, and Unesco, had arrested 75 people involved in an international network of art traffickers. The pan-European operation had begun in October 2016 and led to the recovery of about 3,500 stolen items including archaeological artifacts and other artwork. The ministry did not provide an inventory of recovered items or the locations of the arrests.

In 1969 the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism formed the Comando Carabinieri Tutela Patrimonio Culturale (TPC), better known as the Carabinieri Art Squad. In 1980, the TPC established the database Leonardo, with information about more than 1 million stolen artworks, and accessible to law enforcement agencies around the world.

In December 2021 Michael Steinhardt, an American hedge-fund billionaire, was ordered to surrender 180 looted and illegally smuggled antiquities valued at 70 million U.S. dollars. The antiquities will be returned to their rightful owners and Steinhardt is banned for life from acquiring any other relics.

==State theft, wartime looting and misappropriation by museums==
From 1933 through the end of World War II, the Nazi regime maintained a policy of looting art for sale or for removal to museums in the Third Reich. Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, personally took charge of hundreds of valuable pieces, generally stolen from Jews and other victims of the Holocaust.

In early 2011, about 1,500 art masterpieces, assumed to have been stolen by the Nazis during and before World War II, were confiscated from a private home in Munich, Germany. The confiscation was not made public until November 2013. With an estimated value of $1 billion, their discovery is considered &quot;astounding&quot;, and includes works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall, Paul Klee, Max Beckmann and Emil Nolde, all of which were considered lost.

The looted, mostly Modernist art was banned by the Nazis when they came to power, on the grounds that it was &quot;un-German&quot; or Jewish Bolshevist in nature. Descendants of Jewish collectors who were robbed of their works by the Nazis may be able to claim ownership of many of the works. Members of the families of the original owners of these artworks have, in many cases, persisted in claiming title to their pre-war property.

The 1964 film &quot;The Train&quot;, starring Burt Lancaster, is based on the true story of works of art which had been placed in storage for protection in France during the war, but was looted by the Germans from French museums and private art collections, to be shipped by train back to Germany. Another film, &quot;The Monuments Men&quot; (2014), co-produced, co-written and directed by George Clooney, is based on a similar true-life story. In this film, U.S. soldiers are tasked with saving over a million pieces of art and other culturally important items throughout Europe, before their destruction by Nazi plunder.

In 2006, after a protracted court battle in the United States and Austria (see &quot;Republic of Austria v. Altmann&quot;), five paintings by Austrian artist Gustav Klimt were returned to Maria Altmann, the niece of pre-war owner, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer. Two of the paintings were portraits of Altmann&#x27;s aunt, Adele. The more famous of the two, the gold &quot;Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I&quot;, was sold in 2006 by Altmann and her co-heirs to philanthropist Ronald Lauder for $135 million. At the time of the sale, it was the highest known price ever paid for a painting. The remaining four restituted paintings were later sold at Christie&#x27;s New York for over $190 million.

Because antiquities are often regarded by the country of origin as national treasures, there are numerous cases where artworks (often displayed in the acquiring country for decades) have become the subject of highly charged and political controversy. One prominent example is the case of the Elgin Marbles, which were moved from the Parthenon to the British Museum in 1816 by the Earl of Elgin. Many different Greek governments have called for the repatriation of the marbles.

Similar controversies have arisen over Etruscan, Aztec, and Italian artworks, with advocates of the originating countries generally alleging that the artifacts taken form a vital part of the countries cultural heritage. Yale University&#x27;s Peabody Museum of Natural History is engaged (as of November 2006) in talks with the government of Peru about possible repatriation of artifacts taken during the excavation of Machu Picchu by Yale&#x27;s Hiram Bingham. Likewise, the Chinese government considers Chinese art in foreign hands to be stolen and there may be a clandestine repatriation effort underway.

In 2006, New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum reached an agreement with Italy to return many disputed pieces. The Getty Museum in Los Angeles is also involved in a series of cases of this nature. The artwork in question is of Greek and ancient Italian origin. The museum agreed on November 20, 2006, to return 26 contested pieces to Italy. One of the Getty&#x27;s signature pieces, a statue of the goddess Aphrodite, is the subject of particular scrutiny.

In January 2013, after investigations by Interpol, FBI and The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, police in Canada arrested John Tillmann for an enormous spate of art thefts. It was later determined that Tillmann in conjunction with his Russian wife, had for over twenty years stolen at least 10,000 different art objects from museums, galleries, archives and shops around the world. While not the largest art heist in total dollar value, Tillmann&#x27;s case may be the largest ever in number of objects stolen.

Since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has stolen tens of thousands of art pieces. Experts state that this is the largest art theft since the Nazi looting of Europe in World War II.

==In fiction==
Genres such as crime fiction often portray fictional art thefts as glamorous or exciting raising generations of admirers. Most of these sources add adventurous, even heroic element to the theft, portraying it as an achievement. In literature, a niche of the mystery genre is devoted to art theft and forgery. In film, a caper story usually features complicated heist plots and visually exciting getaway scenes. In many of these movies, the stolen art piece is a MacGuffin.

<text>David Patrick Reed (born January 31, 1952) is an American computer scientist, educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, known for a number of significant contributions to computer networking and wireless communications networks.

He was involved in the early development of TCP/IP, and was the designer of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), though he finds this title &quot;a little embarrassing&quot;. He was also one of the authors of the original paper about the end-to-end principle, &quot;End-to-end arguments in system design&quot;, published in 1984.

He is also known for Reed&#x27;s law, his assertion that the utility of large s, particularly social networks, can scale exponentially with the size of the network.

From 2003–2010, Reed was an adjunct professor at the MIT Media Lab, where he co-led the Viral Communications group and the Communication Futures program. He currently serves as a senior vice president of the Chief Scientist Group at SAP Labs.

He is one of six principal architects of the Croquet project (along with Alan Kay, Julian Lombardi, Andreas Raab, David A. Smith, and Mark McCahill). He is also on the advisory board of TTI/Vanguard.

His 1978 dissertation introduced multiversion concurrency control (MVCC). MVCC is a concurrency control method commonly used by database management systems to provide concurrent access to the database and in programming languages to implement transactional memory.

<text>Japanese mythology is a collection of traditional stories, folktales, and beliefs that emerged in the islands of the Japanese archipelago. Shinto traditions are the cornerstones of Japanese mythology. The history of thousands of years of contact with Chinese and various Indian myths (such as Buddhist and Hindu mythology) are also key influences in Japanese religious belief.

Japanese myths are tied to the topography of the archipelago as well as agriculturally-based folk religion, and the Shinto pantheon holds uncountable &quot;kami&quot; (&quot;god(s)&quot; or &quot;spirits&quot;).

Two important sources for Japanese myths, as they are recognized today, are the and the . The , or &quot;Record of Ancient Matters,&quot; is the oldest surviving account of Japan&#x27;s myths, legends, and history. Additionally, the &quot;Shintōshū&quot; describes the origins of Japanese deities from a Buddhist perspective.

One notable feature of Japanese mythology is its explanation of the origin of the Imperial Family, which has been used historically to deify to the imperial line.

Japanese is not transliterated consistently across all sources (see spelling of proper nouns).

== Sources ==
Japanese myths are passed down through oral tradition, through literary sources (including traditional art), and through archaeological sources. For much of Japan&#x27;s history, communities were mostly isolated, which allowed for local legends and myths to grow around unique features of the geographic location where the people who told the stories lived.

=== Literary sources ===

The Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki, completed in A.D. 712 and A.D. 720 respectively, had the two most referenced and oldest sources of Japanese mythology and pre-history. Written in the Eighth century, under the Yamato state, the two collections relate the cosmogony and mythic origins of the Japanese archipelago, its people, and the imperial family. It is based on the records of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki that the imperial family claims direct descent from the sun goddess Amaterasu and her grandson Ninigi.

Emperor Temmu enlisted the help of Hiyeda no Are who committed to memory the history of Japan as it was recorded in two collections that are thought by historians to have existed before the Kojiki and Nihongi. Under Empress Gemmei&#x27;s rule, Hideya no Are&#x27;s memory of the history of the Japanese archipelago and its mythological origins were recorded in spite of Emperor Temmu&#x27;s death before its completion. As a result of Hideya no Are&#x27;s account, the Kojiki was finally completed, transcribed in kanji characters, during Empress Genshō&#x27;s time as sovereign. The Yamato state also produced &quot;fudoki&quot; and &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, two more of the oldest surviving texts that relate the historical and mythical origins of Japan&#x27;s people, culture, and the imperial family.

Motoori Norinaga, an Edo-period Japanese scholar, interpreted Kojiki and his commentary, annotations, and use of alternate sources to supplement his interpretations are studied by scholars today because of their influence on the current understanding of Japanese myths.

=== Archaeological sources ===
Archaeologists studying the history of the Japanese Archipelago separate the prehistoric history into three eras based on attributes of the discoveries associated with each era. The Jōmun period marks the first cases of pottery found on the archipelago, followed by the Yayoi period and the Kofun period. The Yayoi district of the Japanese capital Tokyo, is the namesake of the Yayoi period because archaeologists discovered pottery associated with the time period there.

Contact with Korean civilization in the latter part of the Yayoi period influenced the culture of the Japanese Archipelago greatly, as evidenced by the discovery of artifacts that archaeologists associate with various cultural streams from Korea, and northeast Asia. Finally, Kofun period artifacts, ranging from A.D. 250 to A.D. 600, are the archaeological sources of what historians know about the Yamato kingdom — the same Yamato state that was responsible for the two most prominent literary sources of Japanese myth, the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki.

== Cosmogony ==

=== Origins of Japan and the kami ===
==== Kuniumi and Kamiumi ====
Japan&#x27;s archipelago creation narrative can be divided into the birth of the deities (Kamiumi) and the birth of the land (Kuniumi). The birth of the deities begins with the appearance of the first generation of gods who appeared out of primordial oil, a trio of gods who produced the next seven generations of gods. Izanagi and Izanami were eventually born, siblings, and using a naginata decorated with jewels, named Ame-no-nuhoko (&quot;Heavenly Jeweled Spear&quot;) that was gifted to them. Izanagi created the first islands of the Japanese Archipelago by dipping the Naginata into the primordial waters. Historians have interpreted the myth of Izanagi&#x27;s creation of the first Japanese Island Onogoro as an early example of phallocentrism in Japanese mythology.The earliest creation myths of Japanese mythology generally involve topics such as death, decay, loss, infanticide, and contamination. The creation myths place great importance on purification, ceremonial order, and the masculine. For example, the first child born to Izanagi and Izanami after they attempt a union ceremony is born with no limbs or bones, and the parents discard the child by sending him to sea in a boat. When Izanagi and Izanami ask the older gods why their child was born without bones or limbs, they are told it was because they did not conduct the ceremony properly and that the male must always speak before the female. Once they follow the directions of the older gods correctly, they produce many children, many of whom are the islands of the Japanese Archipelago. Among their children are the Ōyashima, or the eight great islands of Japan — Awaji, Iyo, Oki, Tsukushi, Iki, Tsushima, Sado, and Yamato. The last child that Izanami produces is a fire god, Kagutsuchi (incarnation of fire), whose flames kill her; and Izanagi murders the child in grief-driven anger. The child&#x27;s corpse creates even more gods. Izanami was then buried on Mount Hiba, at the border of the old provinces of Izumo and Hoki, near modern-day Yasugi of Shimane Prefecture.

Scholars of Japanese mythology have noted the incestuous themes of the creation myth as represented in the Kojiki, and the first scholar to write about Izanagi and Izanami as siblings was Oka Masao. Izanami is referred to in the Kojiki as Izanagi&#x27;s &quot;imo&quot; (meaning both wife or little sister in Japanese) and other scholars dispute that the pair were siblings. Hattori Asake, another scholar, argued that Oka was correct because he drew evidence from another myth about humans who had incestuous relations because of a great flood wiping out the rest of the human population. Essentially, Hattori said the myth Oka used as evidence was too different to be the origin of the Izanagi and Izanami myth. In the Man&#x27;yōshū, Izanami is also referred to as &quot;imo&quot; by the compiler, suggesting that the compiler believed that Izanami was Izanagi&#x27;s sister. While scholars disagree about the nature of Izanami and Izanagi&#x27;s relationships, the gods Amaterasu and Susanoo, children of Izanagi, were sibling gods who created children together in a contest preceding Susanoo&#x27;s desecration of Amaterasu&#x27;s home which leads to her hiding in a cave. A unique aspect of Japanese mythology is its inclusion of graphic details, with disgusting and horrific images that are considered to be taboo in modern Japanese society, which has many cultural practices associated with purification and cleanliness.

==== Yomi ====
After Izanami&#x27;s death, the myth of Izanagi&#x27;s efforts to rescue her from Yomi, an underworld described in Japanese mythology, explains the origins of the cycle of birth and death. After killing their child Kagutsuchi, Izanagi was still grief-stricken, so he undertook the task of finding a way to bring Izanami back from the dead. After finally locating her, he disobeyed her order to not look at her while she went to ask permission to leave Yomi. He used his hair to create a flame, and when he gazed at Izanami&#x27;s rotting, maggot-filled flesh he fled in fear and disgust. Izanami felt betrayed and tried to capture him, but he escaped by creating obstacles for Izanami&#x27;s horde of shikome including using peaches to threaten them. The myth of Izanagi&#x27;s journey into Yomi features many themes of food, he creates grapes to distract the shikome who stop to eat them, granting him time to escape. The peaches he uses to scare the shikome off are then blessed, and peaches appear in many other Japanese myths, especially the tale of Momotarō the peach boy.

==== The Sun, Moon, and Storm ====
The origins of the Sun and the Moon are accounted for in Japanese mythology through the myth of Izanagi&#x27;s return from Yomi. After spending so much time in Yomi, Izanagi cleansed himself with a purification ceremony. As Izanagi cleansed himself, the water and robes that fell from his body created many more gods. Purification rituals still function as important traditions in Japan today, from shoe etiquette in households to sumo wrestling purification ceremonies. Amaterasu, the Sun goddess and divine ancestor of the first Emperor Jimmu, was born from Izanagi&#x27;s eye. The Moon god and Susanoo the storm god were born at the same time as Amaterasu, when Izanagi washed his face.

Myths related the Sun, the Moon, and the Storm kami are full of strife and conflict. The Sun goddess and her sibling the moon god&#x27;s interpersonal conflicts explain, in Japanese myth, why the Sun and the Moon do not stay in the sky at the same time — their distaste for one another keeps them both turning away from the other. Meanwhile, the sun goddess and the storm god Susanoo&#x27;s conflicts were intense and bloody. Various accounts of Susanoo&#x27;s temper tantrum in Amaterasu&#x27;s home depict a variety of disgusting and brutal behaviors (everything from smearing his feces across her home&#x27;s walls to skinning her favorite horse alive and throwing it at her maid and killing the maid) but it is usually, in depictions of this particular myth, Susanoo&#x27;s behavior that scares Amaterasu into hiding in a cave. It would take the combined efforts of many other kami, and the erotic dance of a particular goddess named Ame no Uzume, to lure Amaterasu from the cave again. Ame no Uzume exposed herself while dancing and created such commotion that Amaterasu peeked out from her cave. The myth of Amaterasu&#x27;s entering and emerging from a cave is depicted in one of the most iconic images of Japanese mythology which is shown to the right.

The sun goddess Amaterasu&#x27;s importance in Japanese mythology is two-fold. She is the sun, and one of Izanagi&#x27;s most beloved of children, as well as the ancestor of the Japanese imperial line, according to legend. Her status as a sun goddess had political ramifications for the imperial family, and the Yamato state most likely benefited from the myth when dealing with Korean influences because Korea also had myths of sun god ancestors for the Korean imperial family.

==== First Emperor Jimmu ====

The tale of first Emperor Jimmu is considered the origin of the Imperial family. Emperor Jimmu is considered to be the human descendant of Amaterasu the Sun goddess. His ascension to the throne marked the &quot;Transition from Age of the Gods to Human Age&quot;. After taking control of Yamato province, he established the imperial throne and acceded in the year of kanototori (conventionally dated to 660 B.C.). At the end of the seventh century, the Imperial court finally moved from where Emperor Jimmu was said to have founded it in Yamato.

The importance of this myth in particular is that it establishes the origins, and the power, of the Japanese imperial family as divine. Although some scholars believe that the myths found in the Nihon Shoki and Kojiki are meant to give authority to the imperial family, others suggest that the myths in the Nihon Shoki and Kojiki are unique accounts meant to give authority to the mythic histories in themselves. The Nihon Shoki and Kojiki have varying accounts of the mythic history of Japan, and there are differences in the details of the origins of the imperial family between the two texts. The imperial dynasty still has a role as a public symbol of the state and people, according to the current constitution of Japan.

=== The Japanese pantheon ===
Japanese gods and goddesses, called kami, are uniquely numerous (there are at least eight million) and varied in power and stature. They are usually descendants from the original trio of gods that were born from nothing in the primordial oil that was the world before the kami began to shape it. There are easily as many kami in Japanese myth as there are distinct natural features, and most kami are associated with natural phenomena. Kami can take many shapes and forms, some look almost human in depictions found by archaeologists; meanwhile, other kami look like hybrids of humans and creatures, or may not look human at all. One example of a kami who looks almost human in depictions is the ruler of the Seas Ryujin. On the other hand, kami like Ninigi and Amaterasu are often depicted as human in their forms.

Shinto originated in Japan, and the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki tell the tales of the Shinto pantheon&#x27;s origins. Shinto is still practiced today in Japan. In Shinto belief, kami has multiple meanings and could also be translated as &quot;spirit&quot; and all objects in nature have a kami according to this system. Myths often tell stories of particular, local deities and kami; for example, the kami of a mountain or a nearby lake. Most kami take their origins from Shinto beliefs, but the influence of Buddhism also affected the pantheon. Contact with other cultures usually had some influence on Japanese myth. In the fourteenth century, Christianity found its way to Japan through St. Francis Xavier and there was also contact with westerners. However, during the Tokugawa shogunate Christians were executed in Japan. Twenty Christians were crucified before that while Toyotomi Hideyoshi was consolidating his power after the assassination of Oda Nobunaga. Christianity was banned in Japan until well into the nineteenth century.

==== Folklore heroes ====
As in other cultures, Japanese mythology accounts for not only the actions of supernatural beings but also the adventures and lives of folk heroes. There are many Japanese heroes that are associated with specific locations in Japan, and others that are more well known across the archipelago. Some heroes are thought to have been real people, such as the Forty-seven rōnin, but their legacy has been transformed into great folktales that depict the historical figures as more gifted, powerful, or knowledgeable than the average person. The heroic adventures of these heroes range from acts of kindness and devotion, such as the myth of Shita-kiri Suzume, to battling frightful enemies, as in the tale of Momotaro.
Themes that appear in the folklore concerning heroes are moral lessons, or stories that function as parables. The tale of Shita-kiri Suzume, for example, warns of the dangers of greed, avarice, and jealousy through the example of an old couple&#x27;s experiences with a fairy who disguised herself as a sparrow to test the old man. The influence of &quot;Bushido&quot; is noticeable in the behavior of heroes, and heroes often were also warriors. Momotaro, born from a peach for a childless couple to raise, is a mythic hero who embodied courage and dutifulness as he went on a journey to defeat &quot;oni&quot; who were kidnapping, raping, and pillaging his home island. The tale of Momotaro also shares in the themes of violence, sexual violence, and deities or demons devouring humans. Stories of sexual violence are common in the Buddhist text &quot;Nihon ryōiki&quot;, while stories of people being devoured by mountain deities are found as if they are historical accounts in the fudoki. In Japanese folklore, heroes like Momotaro rescue women from violent &quot;kami&quot; and &quot;oni&quot;. Although the exploits of heroes are well known, Japanese mythology also featured heroines. Ototachibana, the wife of Yamato Takeru, threw herself into the sea to save her husband&#x27;s ship and quell the wrath of the storm that threatened them. Yamato Takeru, once safe, built a tomb for her and his mourning utterance for his wife caused Eastern Honshu to be called Adzuma.

==== Mythological creatures ====
Jorōgumo spider: The Jorōgumo spider is commonly known as a member of the Yōkai myths. The myth begins in a waterfall near the city of Izu. A man had been working long hours, and decided to take a nap. He rested near, the waterfall and there is when Jorōgumo, caught her first prey. Taking on the persona of a beautiful woman, the man simply thought she was merely a woman. After she saw he was asleep, she quickly turned to her true form, top half a beautiful woman and the bottom half is a spider. The man awoke in a web, and was lucky enough to escape said web, to tell the tale to local citizens. Unfortunately, a lumberjack who worked in that forest was not lucky enough to escape the mythological creature.

The Jorōgumo spider is commonly told in Japanese folklore. The word itself translate to the meaning,&quot;whore spider&quot;. Every story commonly states, that the creature captures it&#x27;s prey by first seeming like a beautiful women than after seduction is complete turning into the much more bitter better half. This creature is believed to be over 400 years old. There is said to be a male version of this horrific creature, commonly called the Tschuigumo.

<text>Daniel Jonah Goldhagen (born June 30, 1959) is an American author, and former associate professor of government and social studies at Harvard University. Goldhagen reached attention and broad criticism as the author of two books about the Holocaust: &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Willing Executioners&quot; (1996) and &quot;A Moral Reckoning&quot; (2002). He is also the author of &quot;Worse Than War&quot; (2009), which examines the phenomenon of genocide, and &quot;The Devil That Never Dies&quot; (2013), in which he traces a worldwide rise in virulent antisemitism.

==Biography==
Daniel Goldhagen was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Erich and Norma Goldhagen. He grew up in nearby Newton. His wife Sarah (née Williams) is an architectural historian, and critic for &quot;The New Republic&quot; magazine.

Goldhagen&#x27;s father is Erich Goldhagen, a retired Harvard professor. Erich is a Holocaust survivor who, with his family, was interned in a Nazi Jewish ghetto in Czernowitz (which later became part of Ukraine in 1991). Daniel credits his father for being a &quot;model of intellectual sobriety and probity&quot;. Goldhagen has written that his &quot;understanding of Nazism and of the Holocaust is firmly indebted&quot; to his father&#x27;s influence. In 1977, Goldhagen entered Harvard, and remained there for some twenty years - first as an undergraduate and graduate student, then as an assistant professor in the Government and Social Studies Department.

During early graduate studies, he attended a lecture by Saul Friedländer, in which he had what he describes as a &quot;lightbulb moment&quot;: The functionalism versus intentionalism debate did not address the question, &quot;When Hitler ordered the annihilation of the Jews, why did people execute the order?&quot;. Goldhagen wanted to investigate &quot;who&quot; the German men and women who killed the Jews were, and their reasons for killing.

==Academic and literary career==
As a graduate student, Goldhagen undertook research in the German archives. The thesis of &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust&quot; proposes that, during the Holocaust, many killers were ordinary Germans, who killed for having been raised in a profoundly antisemitic culture, and thus were acculturated — &quot;ready and willing&quot; — to execute the Nazi government&#x27;s genocidal plans.

Goldhagen&#x27;s first notable work was a book review titled &quot;False Witness&quot; published by &quot;The New Republic&quot; magazine on April 17, 1989. It was one in a series of hostile reviews of the 1988 book &quot;Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?&quot; by an American-Jewish professor of Princeton University born in Luxembourg, Arno J. Mayer. Goldhagen wrote that &quot;Mayer&#x27;s enormous intellectual error&quot; was in ascribing the cause of the Holocaust to anti-Communism, rather than to antisemitism, and criticized Prof. Mayer&#x27;s saying that most massacres of Jews in the USSR, during the first weeks of &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot; in the summer of 1941, were committed by local peoples (see the Lviv pogroms for more historical background), with little Wehrmacht participation. Goldhagen accused him also of misrepresenting the facts about the Wannsee Conference (1942), which was meant for plotting the genocide of European Jews, not (as Mayer said) merely the resettlement of the Jews. Goldhagen further accused Mayer of obscurantism, of suppressing historical fact, and of being an apologist for Nazi Germany, like Ernst Nolte, for attempting to &quot;de-demonize&quot; National Socialism. Also in 1989, historian Lucy Dawidowicz reviewed &quot;Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?&quot; in &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine, and praised Goldhagen&#x27;s &quot;False Witness&quot; review, identifying him as a rising Holocaust historian who formally rebutted &quot;Mayer&#x27;s falsification&quot; of history.

In 2003, Goldhagen resigned from Harvard to focus on writing. His work synthesizes four historical elements, kept distinct for analysis; as presented in the books &quot;A Moral Reckoning: the Role of the Catholic Church in the Holocaust and its Unfulfilled Duty of Repair&quot; (2002) and &quot;Worse Than War&quot; (2009): (i) description (what happens), (ii) explanation (why it happens), (iii) moral evaluation (judgment), and (iv) prescription (what is to be done?). According to Goldhagen, his Holocaust studies address questions about the political, social, and cultural particulars behind other genocides: &quot;Who did the killing?&quot; and &quot;What, despite temporal and cultural differences, do mass killings have in common?&quot;, which yielded &quot;Worse Than War: Genocide, Eliminationism, and the Ongoing Assault on Humanity&quot;, about the global nature of genocide, and averting such crimes against humanity.

==Books==
===&quot;Hitler&#x27;s Willing Executioners&quot;===
&quot;Hitler&#x27;s Willing Executioners&quot; (1996) posits that the vast majority of ordinary Germans were &quot;willing executioners&quot; in the Holocaust because of a unique and virulent &quot;eliminationist antisemitism&quot; in German identity that had developed in the preceding centuries. Goldhagen argued that this form of antisemitism was widespread in Germany, that it was unique to Germany, and that because of it, ordinary Germans willingly killed Jews. Goldhagen asserted that this mentality grew out of medieval attitudes with a religious basis, but was eventually secularized. Goldhagen&#x27;s book was meant to be a &quot;thick description&quot; in the manner of Clifford Geertz. As such, to prove his thesis Goldhagen focused on the behavior of ordinary Germans who killed Jews, especially the behavior of the men of Order Police (Orpo) Reserve Battalion 101 in occupied Poland in 1942 to argue ordinary Germans possessed by &quot;eliminationist anti-Semitism&quot; chose to willingly murder Jews in cruel and sadistic ways. Scholars such as Yehuda Bauer, Otto Kulka and Israel Gutman among others had asserted before Goldhagen, the primacy of ideology, radical anti-Semitism, and the corollary of an inimitability exclusive to Germany.

The book, which began as a doctoral dissertation, was written largely as a response to Christopher Browning&#x27;s &quot;Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland&quot; (1992). Much of Goldhagen&#x27;s book was concerned with the same Order Police battalion, but with very different conclusions. On April 8, 1996, Browning and Goldhagen discussed their differences during a symposium hosted by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Browning&#x27;s book recognizes the impact of the unending campaign of antisemitic propaganda, but it takes other factors into account, such as fear of breaking ranks, desire for career advancement, a concern not to be viewed as weak, the effect of state bureaucracy, battlefield conditions and peer-bonding. Goldhagen does not acknowledge the influence of these variables. Goldhagen&#x27;s book went on to win the American Political Science Association&#x27;s 1994 Gabriel A. Almond Award in comparative politics and the Democracy Prize of the &quot;Journal for German and International Politics&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that it was one of the two most important books of 1996, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;one of those rare, new works that merit the appellation &#x27;landmark.

The book sparked controversy in the press and academic circles. Several historians characterized its reception as an extension of the &quot;Historikerstreit&quot;, the German historiographical debate of the 1980s that sought to explain Nazi history. The book was a &quot;publishing phenomenon&quot;, achieving fame in both the United States and Germany despite being criticized by some historians, who called it ahistorical and, according to Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg, &quot;totally wrong about everything&quot; and &quot;worthless&quot;. Due to its alleged &quot;generalizing hypothesis&quot; about Germans, it has been characterized as anti-German. The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer claims that &quot;Goldhagen stumbles badly&quot;, &quot;Goldhagen&#x27;s thesis does not work&quot;, and charges &quot;... that the anti-German bias of his book, almost a racist bias (however much he may deny it), leads nowhere&quot;. The American historian Fritz Stern denounced the book as unscholarly and full of racist Germanophobia. Hilberg summarised the debates, &quot;by the end of 1996, it was clear that in sharp distinction from lay readers, much of the academic world had wiped Goldhagen off the map&quot;.

===&quot;A Moral Reckoning&quot;===
In 2002, Goldhagen published &quot;A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Catholic Church in the Holocaust and Its Unfulfilled Duty of Repair&quot;, his account of the role of the Catholic Church before, during and after World War II. In the book, Goldhagen acknowledges that individual bishops and priests hid and saved a large number of Jews, but also asserts that others promoted or accepted antisemitism before and during the war, and some played a direct role in the persecution of Jews in Europe during the Holocaust.

David Dalin and Joseph Bottum of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; criticized the book, calling it a &quot;misuse of the Holocaust to advance [an] anti-Catholic agenda&quot;, and poor scholarship. Goldhagen noted in an interview with &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, as well as in the book&#x27;s introduction, that the title and the first page of the book reveal its purpose as a moral, rather than historical analysis, asserting that he has invited European Church representatives to present their own historical account in discussing morality and reparation.

===&quot;Worse Than War&quot;===
In &quot;Worse than War: Genocide, Eliminationism, and the Ongoing Assault on Humanity&quot; (2009), Goldhagen described Nazism and the Holocaust as &quot;eliminationist assaults&quot;. He worked on the book intermittently for a decade, interviewing atrocity perpetrators and victims in Rwanda, Bosnia, Guatemala, Cambodia, Kenya, and the USSR, and politicians, government officers, and private humanitarian organization officers. Goldhagen states that his aim is to help &quot;craft institutions and politics that will save countless lives and also lift the lethal threat under which so many people live&quot;. He concludes that eliminationist assaults are preventable because &quot;the world&#x27;s non-mass-murdering countries are wealthy and powerful, having prodigious military capabilities (and they can band together)&quot;, whereas the perpetrator countries &quot;are overwhelmingly poor and weak&quot;.

The book was cinematically adapted, and the documentary film of &quot;Worse Than War&quot; was first presented in the U.S. in Aspen, Colorado, on August 6, 2009 – the sixty-fourth anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945. In Germany, the documentary was first broadcast by the ARD television network October 18, 2009, and was to be nationally broadcast by PBS in 2010. Uğur Ümit Üngör criticized the title of the book, stating &quot;Worse than war? What does that mean? If I write a book about the enormous destruction and deaths of innocent people brought about by war, could I call it &quot;Better than Genocide&quot;?&quot;

David Rieff, characterizing Goldhagen as a &quot;pro-Israel polemicist and amateur historian&quot;, writes that the subtext of what Goldhagen deems &quot;eliminationism&quot; may be his own view of contemporary Islam. Rieff writes that Goldhagen&#x27;s website states that the author &quot;speaks nationally ... about Political Islam&#x27;s Offensive, the threat to Israel, &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Willing Executioners&quot;, the &quot;Globalization of Anti-Semitism&quot;, and more&quot;. Rieff questions Goldhagen&#x27;s equating the &quot;culture of death&quot; of Nazism with that of &quot;political Islam&quot;, as well as Goldhagen&#x27;s conclusion that, in order to prevent &quot;eliminationism&quot;, the United Nations should be remade into an interventionist entity focusing on &quot;a devoted international push for democratizing more countries&quot;. 

Adam Jones, who praised this book for its fluid style and commendable passion, concludes however, that the book is undermined by a casual approach to basic research, and by the author&#x27;s tendency to overreach and overstate his case. The British historian David Elstein accused Goldhagen of manipulating his sources to make a false accusation of genocide against the British during the Mau Mau Uprising of the 1950s in Kenya. Elstein wrote in his view that the chapter on Kenya left Goldhagen open &quot;...to the charge that he is the kind of scholar who is either unaware of the facts or prefers to exclude those which do not fit his thesis&quot;.

==Personal life==

<doc id="425530" wikidata="Q824379" url="?curid=425530" title="Strangers with Candy">
<text>Strangers with Candy is an American television sitcom created by Stephen Colbert, Paul Dinello, Amy Sedaris, and Mitch Rouse that originally aired on Comedy Central from April 7, 1999, to October 2, 2000. Its timeslot was Sundays at 10:00 p.m. (ET). The series, inspired by after school specials, follows Jerri Blank (Sedaris) a 46-year-old woman, who after living as a prostitute and drug addict, decides to go back to high school and start doing things the right way. The series was produced by Comedy Partners, with Kent Alterman serving as executive producer and Colbert as co-producer.

&quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; episodes were produced in a single-camera setup and were filmed between upstate New York and New Jersey. The pilot episode premiered on April 7, 1999, and three seasons followed. The series stars Sedaris, Colbert, Dinello and Greg Hollimon with a supporting cast that includes Roberto Gari, Deborah Rush, Larc Spies, Maria Thayer, Orlando Patoboy, Sarah Thyre and David Pasquesi.

Tonally, &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; uses surreal humor to satirize after school specials and the sanitized, saccharine advice those shows would give to kids. The show altered the lessons so the principal character would always do the wrong thing. It was Comedy Central&#x27;s first ever live-action narrative series. The show struggled with low ratings during its initial broadcast run. Despite the lack of audience, it is now known as a cult classic, having influenced numerous contemporary comedians and screenwriters. A prequel film of the same name was released in 2006.

==Plot==
Set in the fictional city of Flatpoint, &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; follows Geraldine Antonia &quot;Jerri&quot; Blank, a former prostitute and drug addict—referred to in the show as a &quot;junkie whore&quot;—who returns to high school as a 46-year-old freshman at Flatpoint High. Jerri ran away from home and became &quot;a boozer, a user, and a loser&quot; after dropping out of high school as a teenager, supporting her drug habits through prostitution, stripping, and larceny. She has been to prison several times, the last time because she &quot;stole the TV&quot;.

Jerri tries to do things the right way but always ends up learning the wrong lesson. Her hijinks often involve, either directly or indirectly, history teacher Chuck Noblet and his secret lover art teacher Geoffrey Jellineck. Every episode features a warped theme or moral lesson and ends with the cast and other featured actors from the episode dancing. The last episode features Flatpoint High being turned into a strip mall, a development that reflected Comedy Central cancelling the show to make room for a TV show called &quot;Strip Mall&quot;.

==Development==

===Conception===

Sedaris, Dinello, Colbert and Rouse first created the sketch comedy show &quot;Exit 57&quot;, which debuted on Comedy Central in 1995 and aired through 1996&quot;.&quot; Although it lasted only 12 episodes, the show received favorable reviews and was nominated for five CableACE Awards in 1995, in categories including best writing, performance, and comedy series. After the show was cancelled, Colbert and Dinello were preparing a pitch for a show known as &quot;Mysteries of the Insane Unknown.” Simultaneously, Rouse and Sedaris had developed their own pitch, which Sedaris described as &quot;something based on after-school specials&quot; inspired by shows like &quot;The Brady Bunch.&quot; They presented it first to MTV, as Rouse knew someone there; while his friend loved it, they were told the channel would not go for it. Comedy Central was prepared to greenlight &quot;Mysteries&quot; but Dinello convinced Colbert to go help Sedaris with her pitch. Colbert was reticent after hearing her idea because he knew it was better than theirs; he was right, and Comedy Central&#x27;s Kent Alterman chose her show instead.

At first, Sedaris wanted to do a straight after-school special: &quot;We wanted to play it dead, dead serious. No laugh track, nothing. But Comedy Central didn’t go for it.&quot; Rouse, Colbert, and Dinello went to the Museum Of Television and found several after-school specials starring Scott Baio, which they used as reference. Dinello later found a tape of Florrie Fisher&#x27;s &quot;The Trip Back&quot; at Kim&#x27;s video in the East Village; Fisher, a motivational speaker, recalled her days as a New York prostitute and heroin addict to a group of high-school students. After watching it, Dinello thought Fisher reminded him of Sedaris and promptly suggested doing a character—inspired by Fisher—that would go back to high school. Colbert added the idea of her learning the wrong lesson after every episode, and Sedaris said &quot;Okay, she&#x27;ll be a junkie whore this time.&quot; Rouse noted &quot;Strangers&quot; was a combination of Fisher&#x27;s tape, the Baio specials, &quot;Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer&quot;, and Frederick Wiseman’s &quot;Titicut Follies&quot;.

===Writing and production===
Colbert, Dinello and Sedaris wrote most of the episodes. The process started with an &quot;overlying outline&quot;: knowing the start and the end of the episode, they would build the scenes in between and later would improvise together in a room. Whatever they laughed at went in the script. Colbert later said of this method: &quot;Our rule was, if it makes us laugh, we put it in the script. There was not a single thing said by a character in that show that was right. Every choice was the wrong moral choice. Because of the freedom Comedy Central allowed us, we said and did things that were outrageous and extreme.&quot; They would also keep typos in. Sedaris recalled: &quot;That&#x27;s what I learned from working on &quot;Strangers.&quot; If you&#x27;re not laughing, how do you expect anyone else to laugh?&quot; Alterman said of the show&#x27;s structure &quot;The way we approached [it] was to present each one as a morality play where in the third act the protagonist, Jerri Blank, would always, without fail, make the wrong choice. And then to cap it off, she would come back in the epilogue in the fourth act to say what she learned, and she would also draw the wrong lesson from the wrong choice she had made.&quot; To absolve themselves of the offensive stuff they had written, they would imagine all the scripts were written by a middle-aged woman named Jocelyn Hershey Guest, in a similar way to J.D. Salinger alter ego Buddy Glass. &quot;In the world where she’s writing, these are the right moral choices,&quot; Colbert has said. Very occasionally they would write with a collaborator such as Cindy Caponera, Mitch Rouse, or Thomas Lennon. Some of Jerri&#x27;s phrases like &quot;You got skills to pay the bills&quot; and &quot;I like the pole and the hole&quot; came from things Sedaris&#x27; brother Paul would say. Much of Jerri&#x27;s past is taken from anecdotes in &quot;The Trip Back&quot;, some of which are also in Fisher&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Lonely Trip Back&quot;. Several lines of dialogue in the series were taken verbatim from Fisher&#x27;s public-service film. Sedaris would often watch the show without sound to see if a deaf person could follow: &quot;Okay, if I couldn&#x27;t hear or understand anything, could I still find the show entertaining?&quot; And I did. &#x27;Cause everyone was so interesting to look at.&quot; The third season was written in Charleston, South Carolina, Colbert&#x27;s hometown.

Comedy Central picked up the series in 1998 after Colbert had already begun working on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. As a result, he accepted a reduced role, filming only around 20 &quot;Daily Show&quot; segments a year while he worked on the new series. The show was originally entitled &quot;The Way After School Special&quot;, but later was changed to Strangers With Candy, which was just a name they had come up with years earlier, and had been wanting to use for one of their projects. It came from the phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t take candy from strangers,&quot; which would probably be a lesson from an after school special. Sedaris has credited producer Kent Alterman with the development of the show: &quot;He really helped us shape that show. We went in there with strong ideas, but he changed it a lot from the pilot to the first episode. He had a good eye and really good ideas, and we trusted him from the get-go.&quot; Doug Herzog, who was at the time, president of Comedy Central&#x27;s parent company Viacom, also noted his influence, &quot;Kent recognized the brilliance and genius of &quot;Strangers With Candy&quot; really early on. He really championed it when a lot of us were looking at it, going, “What is this?” The show faced slight censorship from the network, Sedaris said, &quot;It was weird. Like they let you say &quot;pussy,&quot; but not &quot;faggot&quot; — until the fourth show. They said, &quot;You have to build up to &#x27;faggot.&#x27;&quot; And the script of one show had me writing in my &quot;dirty, filthy Jew diary.&quot; Well, I could say &quot;dirty,&quot; but I couldn&#x27;t say &quot;filthy.&quot; It was killing me.&quot; Mostly, however, the writers were left alone to their own devices.

Vicki Farrell designed the wardrobe for the show. When designing Jerri Blank&#x27;s appearance, Sedaris told Farrell &quot;I want to look like I own a snake.&quot; Jerri would often wear high-waisted pants and snakeskin ankle boots, as well as turtlenecks because Comedy Central did not want track marks or tattoos to be visible. To complete the look Sedaris wore a fatsuit. Some of her clothes were custom made or came from thrift stores. Sedaris wore a wig and fake lashes, and told the hair and makeup department she wanted Jerri to look like a professional golfer. It would take about 40 minutes for Sedaris to get into character.

===Casting===
When writing the pilot, the writers would perform the characters, and realized that they were imitating Greg Hollimon when they read Principal Blackman&#x27;s lines. Colbert called Hollimon to play the part, but his mother, who had dementia, forgot to pass him the message. A few weeks later Rose Abdoo was able to contact him, and he flew to New York to film. The creators, Hollimon, and many other stars of the series, were also alumni of Chicago&#x27;s Second City. Roberto Gari was chosen for the role of Jerri&#x27;s father Guy as he was the only actor who was able to do the character&#x27;s poses and keep still for a long period of time.

===Filming===
The show was filmed between Westchester County, New York and New Jersey, with two different abandoned schools in the Rutherford area being used as the set for Flatpoint High.

==Cast and characters==

===Main characters===
* Stephen Colbert as Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Noblet, the school&#x27;s history teacher and sponsor of the school newspaper, &quot;The Donkey Trouser&quot;. He and his wife Claire have a son, Seamus, and he is in a secret sexual relationship with Geoffrey Jellineck.
* Paul Dinello as Geoffrey Jellineck, the school&#x27;s art teacher. He is an emotionally fragile and narcissistic man who is engaged in a secret homosexual relationship with Chuck Noblet.
* Greg Hollimon as Principal Onyx Blackman, Principal of Flatpoint High School. His image is prominently displayed around the school, in classrooms, lockers, and even paper towels.
* Roberto Gari as Guy Blank (season 1; guest season 2), Jerri&#x27;s biological father, shown only in a motionless state during mid-action. In the film, he is replaced by Dan Hedaya.
* Deborah Rush as Sara Blank (season 1; recurring seasons 2–3), Jerri&#x27;s hateful stepmother.
* Larc Spies as Derrick Blank (season 1; recurring seasons 2–3), Jerri&#x27;s arrogant teenage half-brother. He plays quarterback for the Flatpoint Donkeys football team. In the film, he is replaced by Joseph Cross.
* Amy Sedaris as Geraldine &quot;Jerri&quot; Antonia Blank, a 46-year-old ex-con, ex-junkie, ex-prostitute, and high-school freshman at Flatpoint High.

===Recurring characters===
* Sarah Thyre as Coach Cherri Wolf, the girls&#x27; gym teacher. Thyre played Jerri&#x27;s stepmom in the original pilot.
* Orlando Pabotoy as Orlando Pinatubo, Jerri&#x27;s Filipino sidekick, about whose heritage she makes many racist remarks. In the film, he is replaced by Carlo Alban as Megawatti Sukarnoputri.
* Maria Thayer as Tammi Littlenut, Jerri&#x27;s red-headed friend, who is often referred to as &quot;Coppertop&quot;.
* David Pasquesi as Stew, the Blank family&#x27;s meat man. He engages in an affair with Sara while remaining married to the mother of his two children (Chuck and Patty).
* Dolores Duffy as Iris Puffybush (seasons 2–3), secretary to Principal Blackman (and, as implied on several occasions, &quot;much, much more&quot;).

==Episodes==

==Cancellation==
The show was cancelled to give space for a new show called &quot;Strip Mall.&quot; In 2016, Sedaris said, &quot;We never knew we had an audience. We never knew what the ratings were—we still haven’t been told we were canceled! But we were fine doing more or not doing more, either way.&quot;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
In an early review, Joyce Millman of &quot;Salon&quot;, said: &quot;Strangers With Candy&quot; is one of the most inventively bizarre shows in a long time –right up there with HBO&#x27;s recent trial run of the mock-rock duo sitcom &quot;Tenacious D&quot;–. It manages to sustain the &quot;Afterschool Special&quot; joke with its smudged, &#x27;70s neo-realistic look, generic pseudo-pop background music and Jerri&#x27;s throwback wardrobe.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was also complimentary of the show, &quot;Strangers With Candy is gleefully absurdist stuff that is clearly not factory-made to suit all tastes, but it&#x27;s certainly a brave if willfully fucked-up piece of work. And, who knows, Comedy Central has done well for itself selling that previously forbidden flavor before.&quot; Pete Schulberg at &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, commented on the show&#x27;s uncompromising humour, &quot;In its own twisted and taboo-bashing way, the series proves to be as outrageous as anything you&#x27;ll see on TV. The satire is heavy-duty, but more often than not, it works&quot;.

&quot;The New York Post&#x27;s&quot; Michelle Greppi, compared the show unfavourably to similar media, &quot;Strangers With Candy&quot; aspires to be the anti-after-school special. Instead, it&#x27;s just a flat and unfunny rip-off of &quot;South Park&quot; refracted through a prison prism and executed in a style that makes cable access look Oscar-ready and all of the &quot;Heathers&quot; ready for sainthood&quot;. Ana Marie Cox of &quot;Feedmag&quot;, had similar thoughts, &quot;So far, critics have mostly responded to the show&#x27;s supposed &quot;outrageousness,&quot; though anyone who still thinks drug references and abortion jokes are &quot;outrageous&quot; must have stopped watching TV when the real After School Specials went off the air.&quot; Further adding, &quot;Yet for all the richness of its targets, the show is curiously flat -- a broad parody whose sharpest moments stem from social non-sequitors and squeamishly inappropriate one-liners, as when Jerri announces: &quot;I have to leave class early -- I&#x27;m getting my uterus scraped.&quot; Perhaps flatness is to be expected, as the show&#x27;s creators [...] are veterans of &quot;alternative comedy,&quot; a genre whose distinguishing characteristic is that it is rarely, you know, funny.&quot; Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the show &quot;is simply boring&quot; and that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t fail on the grounds of bad taste, but of bad comedy&quot;.

In a review of the second season, Tom Conroy of &quot;US Weekly&quot; called the show, &quot;A tart satiric confection with a hard center&quot;, and rated it three of four stars. &quot;The Badger Herald&quot;, praised it as: &quot;One of the most intelligently written shows on TV today. [...] believe me, &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; is a rose garden in the decomposing landscape of network programming.&quot; On another positive review, Kinney Littlefield of 
&quot;The Orange County Register&quot; said, &quot;Like great chocolate, Strangers With Candy has proved to be an addictive substance over its past two seasons&quot;.

On the show&#x27;s cancellation, &quot;ABC News&quot;, commented: &quot;Comedy Central might be canceling the sage, delightfully back-ass-wards Strangers With Candy show. If your response is &quot;What&#x27;s Strangers With Candy?&quot; consider yourself part of the problem rather than the solution.&quot; Similarly, Melanie McFarland of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, lamented its demise: &quot;The show regularly took viewers outside their comfort zone, and ardent fans kept &quot;Strangers&quot; a secret, taking the show&#x27;s existence for granted. After all, it had a faithful core viewership that seemed to grow as more turned their friends on to it. As you can tell, &quot;Strangers With Candy&quot; is probably one of the most deliciously non-P.C. shows out there and certainly deserves more attention on TV than it&#x27;s getting.&quot;

In 2007, &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; was ranked number 30 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;&#x27;s Top Cult Shows Ever.

===Legacy and influence===
Although the series had low ratings during its emission, it became a cult classic, and served as inspiration for other comedians and screenwriters. When talking about &quot;Would It Kill You to Laugh?&quot; John Early and Kate Berlant cited the show as an influence, with Early saying: &quot;It pushes back against schmaltziness in general, I feel a real kinship with that. It’s irreverent and it’s handled so well that it feels very personal.&quot; Lena Dunham also talked about it as an inspiration for &quot;Girls&quot; and cited Jerri Blank as one of her favorite television characters. Cole Escola, who was Sedaris&#x27;s co-star on At Home with Amy Sedaris, also praised &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; and recalled watching it as a teen with their high school boyfriend. Ilana Glazer claimed “Jerri Blank is at least 15 percent of my facial expressions, so I thank her for part of my face.” Julie Klausner, who worked as an intern on the show while in college, said of it: &quot;I can’t really overestimate how influential that show was to me, [...] It’s not for everyone, but the people it is for love it so passionately that when fans meet each other, it’s almost like finding some sort of kinship.&quot; Rapper Amanda Blank based her stage name on Sedaris&#x27;s character. Colbert has claimed that Blank served as a basis for his character on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, noted the show was part of the &quot;tonal DNA&quot; of Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;The Heart She Holler&quot;. Other fans of the show include Dan Levy, RuPaul, John Mulaney, Dave Atell, Justin Theroux, Kevyn Aucoin, Sharon van Etten, Jack Antonoff, Danny DeVito, and Natalie Wynn.

In 2003, Dinello said of the show&#x27;s cult status: &quot;People were angered by it or fanatical about it. We were mocking the conventions of after-school specials and most of what you see on television--how easily things are sewn up, how false relationships are.&quot; In a panel with Levy, when asked about why they think the show had such a dedicated fanbase, Dinello and Sedaris said, &quot;We embrace losers, misfits and outcasts.&quot; Sedaris has described the audience for the show as &quot;Drag Queens getting ready on a Friday at 5:30.&quot; as well as &quot;Homosexuals and 14-year-olds and farmers and ghosts.&quot; She has also said, &quot;I’m just glad it still lives on. It’s fun to know that you threw a hole on the wall, you went through it, you did this show that you didn’t know what it was, and now there’s a whole new generation of kids watching it. It’s still out there and still alive, and we’re all really proud of it. Colbert echoed the statement: &quot;It&#x27;s a badge of honor that I served Amy&#x27;s comedic vision. I could do hack shit for the rest of my life, but I&#x27;d go, &quot;Yeah, but I also wrote that stuff.&quot; In 2024 he described the show&#x27;s fan base as &quot;deeply troubled,&quot; continuing, &quot;And I’m happy for them, because I’m deeply troubled too.&quot;

==Film adaptation and future==

On February 7, 2006, film company ThinkFilm announced that it had acquired the distribution rights to a feature film based on the series. The film, a prequel to the television show, was completed in 2004 and acquired by Warner Independent at Sundance in 2005, but release of the film was delayed due to legal clearance issues. Amy Sedaris, Stephen Colbert, and Paul Dinello reprised their roles for the film; several other characters were recast because the actors who played them now looked too old to be in high school. In addition to acting, Colbert is a co-producer and Dinello is a director for the film. Worldwide Pants, a production company owned by comedian David Letterman, was also a producer. This is the company&#x27;s first feature film production. A teaser trailer for the film was released in April 2006.

The initial theatrical release was June 28, 2006, in the New York City area, followed by the remainder of the United States on July 7. A DVD of the film was released in November 2006. Amy Sedaris said of Jerri Blank that &quot;she&#x27;s like a rash; you never know when she&#x27;s going to pop up.&quot;

In 2024, it was revealed that the creators had been approached about a revival of the series, which they have declined as &quot;Nothing has felt right so far&quot;. Regardless, they have not brushed off the possibility of it coming back in some way. Dinello noted: &quot;Everybody seems game to do something. But we need an adult to make it happen&quot;. Although Sedaris has brought up concerns about the difficulty to make the show now, due to its un-PC humor, Colbert has disagreed, &quot;You can make anything you want, you just have to deal with people being upset&quot;.

<doc id="425533" wikidata="Q1193720" url="?curid=425533" title="Tsukihime">
<text>is a Japanese adult visual novel game created by Type-Moon, who first released it at the Winter Comiket in December 2000. In 2003, it was adapted into both an anime television series, &quot;Lunar Legend Tsukihime&quot;, animated by J.C.Staff, and a manga series, which was serialized between 2003 and 2010 in MediaWorks manga magazine &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot;, with 10 volumes released.

Several other related media have also been released, including the bonus disc &quot;Tsukihime Plus-Disc&quot;, a fan disc &quot;Kagetsu Tohya&quot;, and the fighting game series &quot;Melty Blood&quot;. Story concepts and characters shared many similarities with other Type-Moon&#x27;s series &quot;The Garden of Sinners&quot;, and the two were also subtly connected. A remake with updated art and story was announced in 2008. The first part of the remake, &quot;Tsukihime: A Piece of Blue Glass Moon&quot;, featuring a rewritten and expanded version of two of the original routes, first released in Japan in 2021, and was released worldwide in 2024. The second part, &quot;Tsukihime: The Other Side of Red Garden&quot;, was teased in a secret unlockable trailer in &quot;A Piece of Blue Glass Moon&quot;. &quot;Melty Blood: Type Lumina&quot;, a fighting game, was released worldwide on September 30, 2021, as companion to the remake titles.
==Gameplay==

&quot;Tsukihime&quot; is a visual novel where the story is presented via text that intermittently presents choices for the player to make. These choices influence the story, some in large ways while others in small ones. Some choices lead to bad endings where the protagonist dies, after which the player can optionally view a comedic section called &quot;Teach Me, Ciel-sensei!&quot;, where a fourth-wall-breaking version of the character Ciel offers hints on what led to the bad ending. The game is divided into five routes, distributed amongst two scenarios: The &quot;Near Side of the Moon&quot; (Arcueid and Ciel routes), and the &quot;Far Side of the Moon&quot; (Akiha, Hisui and Kohaku routes). Every heroine except Kohaku has two possible endings. When the player has achieved all possible endings, a new epilogue part, entitled &quot;Eclipse&quot;, is unlocked.

&quot;Tsukihime&quot; remake entries are visual novels like the original, and though it features modern amenities (such as better skip functions), it plays mostly the same. The &quot;Teach Me, Ciel-sensei!&quot; section after a bad ending also returns. Unlike the original, both remakes of Near and Far sides titled &quot;Tsukihime: A Piece of Blue Glass Moon&quot; and &quot;Tsukihime: The Other Side of Red Garden&quot; are released separately:
* &quot;Tsukihime: A Piece of Blue Glass Moon&quot; solely focuses on the Near Side storyline. The Arcueid route titled &quot;Tsukihime&quot; has one ending, while Ciel route titled &quot;Midnight Rainbow&quot; has two branching endings.
* &quot;Tsukihime: The Other Side of Red Garden&quot; solely focuses on the Far Side storyline, featuring Akiha, Hisui, and Kohaku as heroines. This also adds an additional route not included in the original game featuring Satsuki Yumizuka, exploring events previously left unexplored in the series&#x27; fighting game follow up &quot;Melty Blood&quot;.

==Story==
===Setting===
The game&#x27;s plot follows the perspective of protagonist , a second-year high school student in the fictional town of Misaki. He suffers a life-threatening injury at a young age. After regaining consciousness, he gains the ability to see &quot;Death lines&quot;—lines by which things, living or not, will eventually break when they die. Due to his injury, Shiki has immense headaches as his mind cannot cope with the sight of death. Soon after he is given special glasses from Aoko Aozaki that block the sight of these lines. Due to his injury, Shiki is exiled by his father to a branch family of the Tohno household. Eight years later, he returns to accompany his sister after his father died. After moving back, Shiki has trouble adjusting to the old-fashioned lifestyle his sister lives by. As the game progresses, Shiki confronts supernatural beings such as mostly two different types of vampires (, a natural-born vampire race; and , a race of former humans who were mutated into vampires via magecraft or being bitten by a vampire), as well as his family&#x27;s secret and his actual past.

As with many Type-Moon works, &quot;Tsukihime&quot; takes place in the shared &quot;Nasuverse&quot; universe and is set many years after the events of &quot;Witch on the Holy Night&quot;. The original 2000 release takes place in the fictional town of Misaki in 1999, with the events of &quot;Witch on the Holy Night&quot; being a prequel that explores the backstory of Shiki&#x27;s teacher Aoko Aozaki. The 2024 remake takes place in the fictional city of Soya in 2014 and serves as a direct sequel to the 2022 remastered version of &quot;Witch on the Holy Night&quot; instead.

===Plot===
====A Piece of Blue Glass Moon====
After a horrible accident that hospitalized him, a young Shiki Tohno awakens to his Mystic Eyes of Death Perception and is guided by a now older Aoko Aozaki that his powers were a gift and to be used for good one day, giving him a pair of glasses that would deactivate his Eyes so long he was wearing them. After being discharged, Shiki is banished by the Tohno Family and sent to live with his relatives. 

;Arcueid Brunestud Route
Seven years later, Shiki returns to Soya City upon the death of his estranged father, Makihisa Tohno. As a child, he was meant to be heir of the family but was expelled after an accident that left him anemic, resulting in his younger sister Akiha becoming the heir instead. At the same time, the city is also plagued with a series of serial killings by a vampire known as Vlov Archangel, who claims the life of Shiki’s homeroom teacher, creating an opportunity for the vacant spot to be filled by Noel Aizome, a vampire hunting Executor working for the Church. 

After an anemic attack that causes him to lose control of himself, Shiki accidentally kills a True Ancestor vampire, Arcueid Brunesud, who later self-revives out of anger and forces Shiki to hunt down Vlov with her. Despite their success in defeating Vlov, Arcueid reveals that the true serial killer was not Vlov, but rather another vampire named Michael Roa Valdamjong, who can reincarnate after death and has seemingly selected Shiki to be his next host. 

As Ciel, an upperclassman of Shiki, makes herself known as a member of the Executors, she reluctantly works with Shiki and Arcueid to drive Roa out of his hiding spot underneath their school, who has taken the reincarnation of Shiki’s childhood friend of the same name and also possesses similar Mystic Eyes. However Shiki’s variant of the eyes prove superior, allowing him to secure victory over Roa and negate his reincarnation ability permanently. One month after Roa’s defeat, Shiki returns to a normal life while Arcueid returns to her homeland to sleep.

;Ciel Normal Route 
After Shiki forms his first alliance with Arcueid, he intentionally ignores her advice of attacking Vlov at night and instead pursues him during the day, which results in him being thrown into Vlov’s underground catacomb. He finds both Noel and Ciel there on an official Church operation, but he and Noel are temporarily buried under rubble after an attack. While Ciel continues to fight Vlov, Arcueid stubbornly refuses to help the Executors, but her last minute technique to contain Vlov within his area after Ciel’s Bounded Field shatters helps Shiki and Ciel obtain victory and defeat Vlov. 

The next day, Arcueid secretly kills Roa, while Shiki believes that Vlov’s death marked the end of the murders. Arcueid tells Shiki about how she killed Roa and requests he help her nightly to clean up his leftover zombies. Their excursions raise concerns for Ciel, who after following Shiki to one of his meetings with Arcueid, results in her fighting the True Ancestor. 

Noel also begins frantically trying to prove herself by killing more vampires as a result of having been threatened with reassignment due to her poor recent performance. However Ciel humiliates her in battle, leaving Noel no choice but to willingly undergo vampire transformation herself. 

After Arcueid leaves, Ciel is horrified to learn from Shiki that Roa had already been killed, leading her to explain that Shiki is Roa’s next host. Upon learning this, Shiki begins sleepwalking to the point he has killed humans, later realizing that Roa was beginning to surface. Shiki desperately calls Ciel for help, but she responds with full combat, having ascertained that Shiki was too deep into his infection. However Shiki is able to prove his humanity and love for Ciel, convincing Ciel to want to help him fight his infection. This angers Noel, who in her new Dead Apostle form, targets the two with personal vendetta, as Ciel is revealed to have been a former Roa host herself who killed Noel’s family many years ago. 

After Noel’s defeat, Shiki’s attempt to recover from the fight as well as him trying to suppress Roa is taken advantage of by Arcueid, who offers to turn him into a vampire, but he refuses and instead takes advantage of the situation and cuts Arcueid’s line. This results in Arcueid losing control and Shiki is rescued by Ciel, who is then overwhelmed by Arcueid’s power. Shiki, accessing Roa’s memories, reaches out to Arcueid and convinces her to go back home.

As Shiki lies dying, he cuts his own line to completely rid Roa and himself, but is unexpectedly revived by Ciel at the cost of her own life force. In a dream, Ciel tells Shiki the reason why she did what she did. A year and a half later, Shiki decides to join the Church in search of a way to reunite with Ciel once again. 

;Ciel True Route
The route diverges after Ciel and Shiki escape into the school. Arcueid takes longer to resurrect, allowing Ciel time to prepare her battle gear and meet her in the city. However within three minutes of their fight, Arcueid’s power proves to be overwhelming for Ciel as she ultimately takes on a giant luminous form powered by the planet, which distorts reality. 

Ciel is trapped and tortured multiple times in Arcueid’s giant luminous hand. With the amount of lumina energy being extorted by Arcueid, it allows Shiki to directly converse with Roa, who advises him on how to fight Arcueid while helping him stay focused. As Arucied will eventually die the longer she maintains her luminous form, Shiki wants to prevent that from happening. Roa ultimately decides to give up his reincarnating essence to allow Shiki to do just that, as Shiki uses the remaining of Ciel’s celestial arrow energy to finish the job. After the battle, Shiki and Arcueid banter before the latter returns back to her homeland. 

After Shiki awakens in a dream where Ciel does not exist, an incarnation of his young seven-year-old self attempts to convince to stay in that dream as his body would either be stuck in a lifelong coma or eventually die. Shiki ultimately chooses to return to his mortal body and he awakens in the arms of Ciel outside the school. The two kiss and forge a new future for their own.

==Development==
The original story of &quot;Tsukihime&quot; was based on one of Kinoko Nasu&#x27;s ideas for a novel. It featured Arcueid as a cold stereotypical vampire that is the complete opposite of her finished incarnation. The basis for Shiki was a middle-aged old, worn-down vampire who says to Arcueid upon her first approach &quot;I have no interest in women I&#x27;ve already killed once.&quot; The tone of the story was the complete opposite and only the tagline of &quot;a biting relationship between a murderer who can see death lines and a vampire&quot; remained in the final version. Upon developing the story for &quot;Tsukihime&quot;, they pictured Arcueid as a cool and princess-like &quot;Noble Vampire&quot;, but thought that it overlapped with Akiha&#x27;s &quot;Lady&quot; character. All of the heroines spoke politely to the main character, so they figured that the only character who could fit the role of someone who didn&#x27;t speak politely would be Arcueid. They eventually came up with the idea of a &quot;pure white&quot; vampire that developed her character very differently from the original version. There was originally a planned Satsuki route for the original version, but it was later cut.

Several trial versions of &quot;Tsukihime&quot; were released before its full release. The first preview version of &quot;Tsukihime&quot; was a free promotional version of which 300 copies (on 3½ floppy disks) were produced and distributed at Comiket 56 in 1999. At the next Comiket 57 in late 1999, a demo was sold for 100 yen, with only 50 being produced and sold, also distributed on 3½ floppy disks. At Comiket 58 in 2000, &quot;Tsukihime Half Moon Edition&quot; was released. 300 copies were produced and sold for 1,000 yen each. This version contained Arcueid and Ciel&#x27;s &quot;Near Side of the Moon&quot; storylines. The half moon edition came with bonuses including a coupon that would allow purchasers to claim the complete edition in the future. The complete edition of &quot;Tsukihime&quot; was first released at Comiket 59 in December 2000.

Type-Moon released &quot;Tsukihime Plus-Disc&quot; developed with NScripter engine in January 2001, a light-hearted addition to &quot;Tsukihime&quot; that featured two short stories: &quot;Alliance Of Illusionary Eyes&quot; and &quot;Geccha&quot;. The first edition included wallpapers, the first four chapters of &quot;The Garden of Sinners&quot;, an early demo version of &quot;Tsukihime&quot;, a contemporary &quot;Tsukihime&quot; demo, and two omakes featuring &quot;Tsukihime&quot; characters. The second edition &quot;Tsukihime Plus+Disc&quot; added two more stories: &quot;Geccha 2&quot; and &quot;Kinoko&#x27;s Masterpiece Experimental Theater&quot;. This version used the more capable KiriKiri engine. In April 2003, Type-Moon released , a three-disc set that included &quot;Tsukihime&quot;, &quot;Tsukihime Plus+Disc&quot;, &quot;Kagetsu Tohya&quot;, a remixed soundtrack, a trial version of Melty Blood and other assorted multimedia. The original visual novel was available to play with Game Boy Advance with the conversion software &quot;Rinkai Tsukihime&quot; distributed by the doujin circle &quot;Inside-Cap&quot;.

In December 2001, Inside-Cap released an officially licensed program for Windows 98/Me/2000/XP that allowed customers to convert their PC copy of &quot;Tsukihime&quot; into a Game Boy Advance rom; the program was distributed via CD-ROM through retail and online shops.

===Remake===
A remake of &quot;Tsukihime&quot; was announced in 2008, with work commencing in 2012. Work was then suspended in 2013 due to Type Moon&#x27;s work on &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, before resuming in 2017. It was later announced that it would be released in two parts, with the first, titled &quot;Tsukihime: A Piece of Blue Glass Moon&quot;, containing the &quot;Near-side&quot; part of the game. The game was released on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch consoles on August 26, 2021 in Japan. The theme songs &quot;Seimeisen&quot; and &quot;Juvenile&quot;, as well as the ending themes &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Believer&quot; were written, composed and arranged by Kegani from Live Lab and performed by Reona, and released on CD on September 1, 2021. The soundtrack was composed by Hideyuki Fukasawa and Keita Haga, and was released as a set of eight CDs on November 24, 2021. &quot;Tsukihime: The Other Side of Red Garden&quot;, containing the remake&#x27;s equivalent of the &quot;Far-side&quot; part of the original, was teased in an unlockable secret trailer in &quot;Tsukihime: A Piece of Blue Glass Moon&quot;.

The remake modernizes the setting of &quot;Tsukihime&quot;, having it take place in a large city in 2014 (as opposed to the suburban town in 1999 of the original), and also makes changes to the plot. The remake also adds new characters, voice acting, and new character designs. Writer Kinoko Nasu has stated in interviews that he was inspired by &quot;&quot; to make the changes, and when writing the remake, Arcueid&#x27;s route was written to be a reproduction of the old &quot;Tsukihime&quot;, while Ciel&#x27;s route was written to be new. It also includes the Satsuki route.

At Anime Expo 2023, it was announced that the &quot;Tsukihime&quot; remake entries would get official localization outside Japan, starting from &quot;A Piece of Blue Glass Moon&quot; on June 27, 2024. It is also confirmed in &quot;Type-Moon Ace&quot; Vol. 15 that Windows version of the &quot;Tsukihime&quot; remake entries will be included as well.

===Sequel===
&quot;Kagetsu Tohya&quot; has teasers for a &quot;Tsukihime 2&quot;, and writer Kinoko Nasu&#x27;s short stories &quot;talk.&quot; and &quot;Prelude&quot; from &quot;Tsukihime&quot; material book″s &quot;Plus Period&quot; published on October 22, 2004 and the Type-Moon″s &quot;Character material&quot; published on August 20, 2006 are set before it. References to it have been mostly been made into jokes during recent interviews, and they have displayed no current plans to actually create the project. According to &quot;Character material&quot;, the sequel would have been called &quot;Tsukihime: The Dark Six&quot; and would have revolved, at least in part, around a ritual gathering of Dead Apostle ancestors. Arcueid&#x27;s sister Altrouge would have had a possible role.

===Video games===
&quot;Kagetsu Tohya&quot; is a sequel released in August 2001 and set one year after the events in the main &quot;Tsukihime&quot; storyline. Shiki gets into an accident and has a repeating dream sequence in which he must relive the same day over until he finds Len. As the player repeats each day they are able to make different choices which affect the flow of the narrative and unlock extra content in the game, including ten short stories.

&quot;Melty Blood&quot; is a PC dojin fighting game series developed by Type-Moon and French-Bread, originally released at Comiket 63 in 2002. The game features characters from the &quot;Tsukihime&quot; games as well as new characters specific for the games. Multiple updated versions of the game have been created as well as a sequel. It later spawned an arcade version, titled &quot;Act Cadenza&quot;, that was developed by Ecole Software and was then ported to the PlayStation 2. A decade later, Type-Moon and French-Bread collaborated once again to develop the fifth installment and reboot, &quot;Melty Blood: Type Lumina&quot;, featuring the characters from the remake titles.

===Anime===

A 12-episode anime television series adaptation titled was directed by Katsushi Sakurabi and produced by J.C.Staff. It was written by Hiroko Tokita and features original music by Toshiyuki Ōmori. It first aired between October 10 to December 26, 2003 on BS-i. It also aired on Animax Asia in Southeast Asia and South Asia. Two pieces of theme music are used for the episodes; one opening theme and one ending theme. The opening theme was titled &quot;The Sacred Moon&quot; by Toshiyuki Omori, and the ending theme was by Fumiko Orikasa. The reason for choosing &quot;Lunar Legend Tsukihime&quot; instead of the title &quot;Tsukihime&quot; is that the trademark of &quot;Tsukihime&quot; had already been used.

Geneon announced it had licensed the series for distribution in North America in 2004 under the title &quot;Tsukihime, Lunar Legend&quot;. Upon Geneon&#x27;s American operations having shut down, the newly instituted licensor Sentai Filmworks acquired the North American rights to the series, with Section23 Films handling its distribution and marketing, along with other titles.

===Print===
A manga adaptation using the same &quot;Lunar Legend Tsukihime&quot; title as the anime, illustrated by Sasaki Shōnen, was serialized in ASCII Media Works&#x27; manga magazine &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; between October 2003 and September 2010 issues. The plot largely follows the game&#x27;s Arcueid route with a mix of the other routes. The chapters were collected in ten volumes published by ASCII Media Works. &quot;Tsukihime&quot; creator Kinoko Nasu has praised Sasaki&#x27;s manga, saying that the settings mentioned in &quot;Tsukihime&quot; and &quot;Kagetsu Tohya&quot; are integrated without damaging the atmosphere of the original. Nasu also went on to say that Sasaki Shonen&#x27;s manga was the greatest rival to the remake game project, and that Sasaki&#x27;s stamp of approval after he playtested it meant there was &quot;nothing to be afraid of&quot;. The manga was licensed for an English-language release in North America by ComicsOne in 2004. In 2005, DR Master took over the publication of ComicsOne&#x27;s manga titles including &quot;Tsukihime&quot;. Six out of ten volumes were published.

&quot;Tsuki no Sango&quot; is a short story by Kinoko Nasu for Maaya Sakamoto&#x27;s Full Moon Recital Hall, a project organized by the Japanese online magazine Saizensen, that consisted of Sakamoto reading short novels in a theater while an accompanying short animation was aired in the background. &quot;Tsuki no Sango&quot; was the first of the recitals on December 21, 2010, and it was aired live on Ustream. The short movie was animated by Ufotable, which also animated &quot;The Garden of Sinners&quot; and &quot;Fate/Zero&quot;, and features drawings by Takashi Takeuchi and Chihiro Aikura. The animation used Frédéric Chopin composed music. The concept is &quot;Tsukihime 3000&quot; and the Princess Kaguya folktale. There is also a 42-page booklet version of the story with illustrations by Takeuchi and Aikura. &quot;Tsuki no Sango&quot; also got a manga adaptation with story and art by Sasaki Shōnen. It was serialized on the &quot;Saizensen&quot; web magazine from July 7, 2012 until January 22, 2019. The chapters were compiled into two tankobon volumes published by Seikaisha Comics. The first volume was released on March 10, 2014 and the second volume on May 26, 2019. An omnibus version was also published on May 26, 2019.

==Music==
A remake of the visual novel&#x27;s soundtrack was released on February 24, 2004 titled &quot;Ever After ~Music from &quot;Tsukihime&quot; Reproduction~&quot;. Two soundtrack compilations were released for the anime &quot;Lunar Legend Tsukihime&quot;, titled &quot;Moonlit Archives&quot; and &quot;Moonlit Memoirs&quot;. The music was composed by Keita Haga. The &quot;Tsukihime: A Piece of Blue Glass Moon&quot; theme songs by Reona were released on CD on September 1, 2021 while the eight disc soundtrack, which was composed by Keita Haga and Hideyuki Fukasawa, was released on November 24, 2021.

==Reception==
Following its release, &quot;Tsukihime: A Piece of Blue Glass Moon&quot; sold 72,237 units on the Nintendo Switch and 66,171 units on the PlayStation 4, bringing it to a total of 138,408 copies sold at retail; this does not include download sales. 

&quot;Tsukihime: A Piece of Blue Glass Moon&quot; was very well received by English-language media. The narrative, production quality, and localization were all praised by reviewers. and it was (as of July 26, 2024) the highest-rated 2024 game on OpenCritic.

The manga series has shown high sales figures in its later volumes, with volume seven staying in the Japanese comic ranking for two weeks, while volume eight stayed in for three weeks.

Carlos Santos of Anime News Network&#x27;s opinion on the anime&#x27;s third DVD release is that it &quot;is a show that&#x27;s all about creating a mood, which it does very well with its carefully planned color schemes and evocative music score.&quot; He states, &quot;It&#x27;s an ending that takes its time, however, as this show&#x27;s deliberate pacing ensures that the story is revealed only to those who are patient enough.&quot;

<text>Gunther Alexander Schuller (November 22, 1925June 21, 2015) was an American composer, conductor, horn player, author, historian, educator, publisher, and jazz musician.

==Biography and works==

===Early years===
Schuller was born in Queens, New York City, the son of German parents Elsie (Bernartz) and Arthur E. Schuller, a violinist with the New York Philharmonic. 
He studied at the Saint Thomas Choir School and became an accomplished French horn player and flute player. 
At age 15, he was already playing horn professionally with the American Ballet Theatre (1943) followed by an appointment as principal hornist with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (1943–45), and then the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in New York, where he stayed until 1959. 
During his youth, he attended the Precollege Division at the Manhattan School of Music, later going on to teach at the school. But, already a high school dropout because he wanted to play professionally, Schuller never obtained a degree from any institution. He began his career in jazz by recording as a horn player with Miles Davis (1949–50).

===Performance and growth===
In 1955, Schuller and jazz pianist John Lewis founded the Modern Jazz Society, which gave its first concert at Town Hall, New York, the same year and later became known as the Jazz and Classical Music Society. While lecturing at Brandeis University in 1957, he coined the term &quot;Third Stream&quot; to describe music that combines classical and jazz techniques. He became an enthusiastic advocate of this style and wrote many works according to its principles, among them &quot;Transformation&quot; (1957, for jazz ensemble), &quot;Concertino&quot; (1959, for jazz quartet and orchestra), &quot;Abstraction&quot; (1959, for nine instruments), and &quot;Variants on a Theme of Thelonious Monk&quot; (1960, for 13 instruments) utilizing Eric Dolphy and Ornette Coleman. In 1966, he composed the opera &quot;The Visitation&quot;. 
He also orchestrated Scott Joplin&#x27;s only known surviving opera &quot;Treemonisha&quot; for the Houston Grand Opera&#x27;s premiere production of this work in 1975.

===Career maturity===
In 1959, Schuller largely gave up performance to devote himself to composition, teaching and writing. He conducted internationally and studied and recorded jazz with such greats as Dizzy Gillespie and John Lewis among many others. Schuller wrote over 190 original compositions in many musical genres.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Schuller was president of New England Conservatory, where he founded The New England Ragtime Ensemble. During this period, he also held a variety of positions at the Boston Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s summer home in Tanglewood, serving as director of new music activities from 1965 to 1969 and as artistic director of the Tanglewood Music Center from 1970 to 1984 and creating the Tanglewood Festival of Contemporary Music.

In the 1970s and 1980s Schuller founded the publishers Margun Music and Gun-Mar and the record label GM Recordings. Margun Music and Gun-Mar were sold to Music Sales Group in 1999.

Schuller recorded the LP &quot;Country Fiddle Band&quot; with the Conservatory&#x27;s country fiddle band, released by Columbia Records in 1976. Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;The melodies are fetchingly tried-and-true, the (unintentional?) stateliness of the rhythms appropriately nineteenth-century, and the instrumental overkill (twenty-four instruments massed on &#x27;Flop-Eared Mule&#x27;) both gorgeous and hilarious. A grand novelty.&quot;

Schuller was editor-in-chief of Jazz Masterworks Editions, and co-director of the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra in Washington, D.C. Another effort of preservation was his editing and posthumous premiering at Lincoln Center in 1989 of Charles Mingus&#x27;s immense final work, &quot;Epitaph&quot;, subsequently released on Columbia/Sony Records. He was the author of two major books on the history of jazz, &quot;Early Jazz&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Swing Era: The Development of Jazz, 1930-1945&quot;.

His students included Irwin Swack, Ralph Patt, John Ferritto, Mohammed Fairouz, Gitta Steiner, Oliver Knussen, Nancy Zeltsman, Riccardo Dalli Cardillo and hundreds of others. 

===Accomplishments in final decades===
From 1993 until his death, Schuller served as Artistic Director for the Northwest Bach Festival in Spokane, Washington state. Each year the festival showcased works by J.S. Bach and other composers in venues around Spokane. At the 2010 festival, Schuller conducted the Mass in B minor at St. John&#x27;s Cathedral, sung by the Bach Festival Chorus, composed of professional singers in Eastern Washington, and the BachFestival, composed of members of the Spokane Symphony and others. Other notable performances Schuller conducted at the festival include the St Matthew Passion in 2008 and Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; in 2005.

Schuller&#x27;s association with Spokane began with guest conducting the Spokane Symphony for one week in 1982. He then served as Music Director from 1984 to 1985 and later regularly appeared as a guest conductor. Schuller also served as Artistic Director to the nearby Festival at Sandpoint.

In 2005, the Boston Symphony, New England Conservatory, and Harvard University presented a festival of Schuller&#x27;s music, curated by Bruce Brubaker, titled &quot;I Hear America.&quot; At the time, Brubaker remarked, &quot;Gunther Schuller is a key witness to American musical culture.&quot; His modernist orchestral work &quot;Where the Word Ends&quot;, organized in four movements corresponding to those of a symphony, was premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 2009.

In 2011 Schuller published the first volume of a two-volume autobiography, &quot;Gunther Schuller: A Life in Pursuit of Music and Beauty&quot;.

In 2012, Schuller premiered a new arrangement, the &quot;Treemonisha&quot; suite from Joplin&#x27;s opera. It was performed as part of &quot;The Rest is Noise&quot; season at London&#x27;s South Bank in 2013.

Schuller died on June 21, 2015, in Boston, from complications from leukemia. He married Marjorie Black, a singer and pianist, in 1948, and the marriage lasted until her death in 1992. His sons Ed (born 1955), a jazz bassist, and George (born 1958), a jazz drummer, survived him, as did his brother Edgar.

<text>The Bram Stoker Award is a recognition presented annually by the Horror Writers Association (HWA) for &quot;superior achievement&quot; in dark fantasy and horror writing.

==History==
The Awards were established in 1987 and have been presented annually since 1988, and the winners are selected by ballot of the Active members of the HWA. They are named after Irish horror writer Bram Stoker, author of the novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, among others.

Several members of the HWA—including Dean Koontz—were reluctant to endorse such writing awards, fearing it would incite competitiveness rather than friendly admiration. The HWA therefore went to lengths to avoid mean-spirited competition, they agreed to specifically seek out new and neglected writers and works, and officially issue Awards not based on &quot;best of the year&quot; criteria, but &quot;for superior achievement&quot;, which allows for ties.

Nominated works come from two different processes. Works can be recommended by any member of the HWA and a separate list of works is presented by a Jury for each category. Members with Active status then vote on works appearing on preliminary ballots. The field is thereby narrowed to the Final ballot; and Active members vote to choose the winners from that Final Ballot. Winners of a Bram Stoker Award receive a statuette made by New York firm, Society Awards.

The terms Bram Stoker Award and Bram Stoker Awards are registered trademarks of the Horror Writers Association.

<doc id="425546" wikidata="Q2319444" url="?curid=425546" title="Herpetophobia">
<text>Herpetophobia is a common specific phobia, which consists of fear or aversion to reptiles, commonly lizards and snakes, and similar vertebrates as amphibians. It is one of the most diffused animal phobias, very similar and related to ophidiophobia. This condition causes a slight to severe emotional reaction, for example anxiety, panic attack or most commonly nausea. Herpetophobia is a common phobia and comes in many forms. Some people have fears of just looking at a reptile, some have fears of touching a reptile, and some cannot even stand knowing a reptile is in their space. Due to the specific type of phobia, there are no individual statistics for those who suffer from herpetophobia. Not everyone who is scared or has a fear of reptiles has herpetophobia.

==Specific reptiles that may cause herpertophobia==
* Snakes 
* Lizards 
* Turtles
* Tortoises 
* Tuataras 
* Alligators 
* Crocodiles 
* Caimans 
* Dinosaurs

==Causes==
The cause of the phobia is different for everyone and varies from person to person, meaning that the cause is still unknown. The phobia is likely to be caused by an experience that is traumatic either negative, scary experience, or painful experience. Herpetophobia can affect people of all ages but is more common in children. Herpetophobia may also be caused by a family member&#x27;s same fear making the other person also scared and gain the phobia. Seeing another person having a phobia it may make someone else scared and maybe frightened by the reptile.

==Signs and symptoms==
The physiological signs are when an individual is unable to control the fear, anxiety, and panic that arises even when those who are experiencing the fear are not in danger. When you are around reptiles you are unable to function or concentrate.

Signs and symptoms include:
* Increased heart rate
* Shaking
* Shortness of breath
* Sweating
* Dizziness or faintness
* Nausea
* Chills or heat flush
* Feeling of choking

In some instances, people who have Herpetophobia may cry, freeze, and cling to others in their environment.

==Conditioning experiences==
* Putting a fake look-alike reptile in front of someone with herpetophobia.
* Making a reptile noise in front of someone with herpetophobia.
* Rubbing something that feels like a reptile to someone with herpetophobia.
This is an image that may cause herpetophobia due to its realistic features.

==Behavior==
Those with herpetophobia tend to go out of their way to avoid the reptile and will do anything to avoid herpetophobia. This may lead to self-isolation, and depression, and change the way they live. The sufferers may affect their work and social lives which can lead to isolation.

==Management and treatment==
Those with herpetophobia may utilize two types of therapy. One is exposure therapy, which is when your therapist slowly introduces you to reptiles. Some types of Exposure therapy include:
* Imaginal exposure therapy- This process makes a person imagine that there are reptiles all around them to help cope with their fear. 
* Graded exposure therapy- This process is where repeated exposure to the feared stimulus leads to a reduction in the fear response over time. 
* Vivo exposure treatment- this process directly exposes the patient to the reptiles by either the doctor holding the reptile in front of the patient or the patient the reptile 
* Virtual reality exposure Virtual reality therapy - this treatment is when they use virtual reality to expose the patient to real-life things even though it is fake and not happening in real life 
* Flooding therapy Flooding (psychology)- this process uses cooping techniques that are associated with feelings to help the patient relax while dealing with the fear. 
The second type is Cognitive behavioral therapy, which is used to help identify and change the negative experience you had with reptiles. The third type is desensitization therapy Desensitization (psychology) where the doctor allows the treatment process to progress on its own which may help to reduce the discomfort those feel while facing their fear. Some coping mechanisms that may work are:
* Understanding your phobia
* Visualizing yourself getting over the fear
* Desensitization (psychology)
* Changing negative thoughts
* Creating a Fear Ladder
* Practicing meditation and yoga 
* Learning breathing exercises
* Seeking personal support or a support group
Some medications that have been found beneficial for herpetophobia are Benzodiazepine, Antidepressant, and Beta blocker. The drugs aren’t a cure, but they are used to help cope with the phobia and may only be effective for a short amount of time.

<text>SMPTE color bars are a television test pattern used where the NTSC video standard is utilized, including countries in North America. The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) refers to the pattern as Engineering Guideline (EG) 1-1990. Its components are a known standard, and created by test pattern generators. Comparing it as received to the known standard gives video engineers an indication of how an NTSC video signal has been altered by recording or transmission and what adjustments must be made to bring it back to specification. It is also used for setting a television monitor or receiver to reproduce NTSC chrominance and luminance information correctly.

A precursor to the SMPTE test pattern was conceived by Norbert D. Larky (1927–2018) and David D. Holmes (1926–2006) of RCA Laboratories and first published in RCA Licensee Bulletin LB-819 on February 7, 1951. U.S. patent 2,742,525 Color Test Pattern Generator (now expired) was awarded on April 17, 1956, to Larky and Holmes. Later, the EIA published a standard, RS-189A, which in 1976 became EIA-189A, which described a Standard Color Bar Signal, intended for use as a test signal for adjustment of color monitors, adjustment of encoders, and rapid checks of color television transmission systems. In 1977, A. A. Goldberg, of the CBS Technology Center, described an improved color bar test signal developed at the center by Hank Mahler (1936–2021) that was then submitted to the SMPTE TV Video Technology Committee for consideration as a SMPTE recommended practice. This improved test signal was published as the standard SMPTE ECR 1-1978. Its development by CBS was awarded a Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award in 2002. CBS did not file a patent application on the test signal, thereby putting it into the public domain for general use by the industry.
An extended version of the SMPTE color bars, SMPTE RP 219:2002 was introduced to test HDTV signals (see subsection).

Although color bars were originally designed to calibrate analog NTSC equipment, they remain widely used in transmission and within modern digital television facilities. In the current context color bars are used to maintain accurate chroma and luminance levels in CRT, LCD, LED, plasma, and other video displays, as well as duplication, satellite, fiber-optic and microwave transmission, and television and webcast equipment.

In a survey of the top standards of the organizations&#x27; first 100 years, SMPTE EG-1 was voted as the 5th-most important SMPTE standard.

==SMPTE ECR 1-1978 (SDTV)==
In a SMPTE color bar image, the top two-thirds of the television picture contain seven vertical bars of 75% intensity. In order from left to right, the colors are white or gray, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, and blue. The choice of white or gray depends on whether that bar&#x27;s luminance is 100% or not. This sequence runs through all seven possible combinations that use at least one of the three basic color components of green, red, and blue, with blue cycling on and off between every bar, red cycling on and off every two bars, and green on for the leftmost four bars and off for the rightmost three. Because green contributes the largest share of luminance, followed by red, then blue, this sequence of bars thus appears on a waveform monitor in luminance mode as a downward staircase from left to right. The graticule of a vectorscope is etched with boxes showing the permissible regions where the traces from these seven bars are supposed to fall if the signal is properly adjusted.

Below the main set of seven bars is a strip of blue, magenta, cyan, and white or gray castellations. When a television receiver is set to filter out all colors except for blue, these castellations, combined with the main set of color bars, are used to adjust the color controls; they appear as four solid blue bars, with no visible distinction between the bars and the castellations if the color controls are properly adjusted.

The bottom section contains a square of 100% intensity white and a rectangle of 7.5% intensity black, for use in setting the luminance range. More modern versions of the pattern feature a &quot;PLUGE pulse&quot;. The white square lines up so that it is below the yellow and cyan bars, and on a waveform monitor this will show up with the white bar overlapping the peak of the yellow and cyan chroma at 100 IRE units. The &quot;pluge&quot; (short for picture line-up generation equipment) pulse is positioned within the black rectangle, below the red bar (it is present in the illustration but may be hard to see). It comprises three small vertical bars, a rightmost one with intensity 4% above black level (11.5 IRE), a middle one with intensity exactly equal to black (7.5 IRE), and a leftmost one with intensity 4% below black (super-black or &quot;blacker than black&quot;, 3.5 IRE). The pluge pulse aids in adjusting the bottom of the luminance range to avoid either washing out the black tones into grays or collapsing picture information into the signal clipping that occurs a small distance below the black level (known as &quot;crushing the blacks&quot;). When a monitor is properly adjusted, the rightmost pluge bar should be just barely visible, while the left two should appear indistinguishable from each other and completely black. Also in the bottom section are two sections that contain -In-phase and +Quadrature signals (see YIQ), centered on black level and having the same gain as the color burst signal; these show up on the pattern as a square of very dark blue, and a square of very dark purple. On a vectorscope, they appear as two short lines ninety degrees apart. These are used to ensure that the television receiver is properly demodulating the 3.58 MHz color subcarrier portion of the signal. The vectors for the -I and +Q blocks should fall exactly on the I and Q axes on the vectorscope if the chrominance signal is demodulated properly.

These bars give rise to the former portion of the casual term &quot;bars and tone&quot;. Typically, a television network, TV station, or other originator of video programming transmits SMPTE color bars together with a continuous 1,000 Hz sine wave before sending program material, in order to assert ownership of the transmission line or medium, and so that receiving stations and intermediary telecommunications providers may adjust their equipment. Likewise, producers of television programs typically record &quot;bars and tone&quot; at the beginning of a videotape or other recording medium so that the playback equipment can be calibrated. Often, the name or callsign of the TV station, other information such as a real-time clock, or another signal source is graphically superimposed over the bars.

=== Analog NTSC ===
Values of 75% (75/7.5/75/7.5) SMPTE ECR 1-1978 color bars as analog NTSC signals:

=== Digital video ===
For digital video sources, the 10-bit YCbCr values for SD color bars are based on the SMPTE formula for Y from the NTSC system (Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B). The following table show the expected digital values, for example when measured using a signal analyzer.


The colors below are presented using sRGB transfer of CSS. Since sRGB is the standard colorspace for webpages and computer screens, this gives only an idea of the intended colors. They are not completely representative of how they look on TV displays, since these follow the ITU-R BT.1886 standard, specifying a different gamma correction value, and thus colors below will look darker on such a display, and those darker colors will be the reference ones. The off-by-one errors (for example 254 instead of 255 and 1 instead of 0) happen because the 8 bit Y&#x27;PbPr values were used when decoding to R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27;, if you use 10-bit Y&#x27;PbPr that does not happen.

Y&#x27;PbPr (and Y&#x27;CbCr) values of 75% (100/0/75/0) SMPTE ECR 1-1978 color bars (0.75 * 219 + 16 = 180) using BT.709-2 matrix coefficients as written in RP 219:2002:

The source data for 10-bit and 12-bit Y&#x27;PbPr is 8-bit Studio R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27;, so 10-bit data is not just a bitshift operation (that means multiply by 4) from 8-bit Y&#x27;PbPr, as usually the case. For example, for 75% Blue 28-212-120 would be just 112-848-480, but it is actually 111-848-481.

Per ITU-R BT.2111-2 TABLE 2

==SMPTE RP 219:2002 (HDTV version)==

An extended version of SMPTE Color Bars signal, developed by the Japanese Association of Radio Industries and Businesses as ARIB STD-B28 and standardized as SMPTE RP 219:2002 (High-Definition, Standard-Definition Compatible Color Bar Signal) was introduced to test HDTV signal with an aspect ratio of 16:9 that can be down converted to a SDTV color bar signal with an aspect ratio of either 4:3 or 16:9. The Color Bar signal is generated with unconventionally slow rise and fall time value to facilitate video level control and monitor color adjustments of HDTV and SDTV equipment.

Digital test images generated following the RP 219:2002 specifications and adapted to perfectly fit 114 standard and non-standard resolutions for both 16bpp and 8bpp, are freely available in the COLOR dataset of the TESTIMAGES archive.

Later RP 219:2002 became RP 219-1:2014, with RP 219-2:2016 and ARIB STD-B66 adding details for UHD. ITU-R Rec. BT.2111 and ARIB STD-B72 further added versions with PQ / HLG HDR transfer functions and wide color gamut (BT.2020), which additionally have 100% saturated colors at the top and BT.709 bars at right bottom and left bottom; the 75% gray horizontal bar in the middle is changed to grayscale stair steps.

===Values===
The values of 100% (100/0/100/0) SMPTE RP 219:2002 color bars (1.00 * 219 + 16 = 235) using BT.709 matrix coefficients (only white and black are the same using BT.601 matrix), taken from the standard:
ITU-R Rec. BT.1729 specified the last two 100% colors, green and magenta. It also specified all 100% colors for BT.601 matrix, not only BT.709.

<doc id="425555" wikidata="Q1737699" url="?curid=425555" title="Kedgeree">
<text>Kedgeree (or occasionally ) is a dish consisting of cooked, flaked fish (traditionally smoked haddock), boiled rice, parsley, hard-boiled eggs, curry powder, lemon juice, salt, butter or cream, and occasionally sultanas.

The dish can be eaten hot or cold. Other fish can be used instead of haddock such as tuna or salmon, though these are not traditional. In Scotland, kippers are often substituted for the smoked haddock.

In India, khichari is any of a large variety of legume-and-rice dishes. These dishes are made with a spice mixture designed for each recipe and either dry-toasted or fried in oil before inclusion. This dish was heavily adapted by the British, resulting in a dish almost unrecognisably different from the original khichari.

==History==
Kedgeree is thought to have originated with the Indian rice-and-bean or rice-and-lentil dish khichuṛī, traced back to 1340 or earlier. &quot;Hobson-Jobson&quot; cites ibn Battuta () mentioning a dish of munj (mung beans) boiled with rice called kishrī and cites a recipe for khichdi from the &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot; (). In Gujarat, where khichdi remains popular, the lentil and rice dish is usually served with kadhi, a spiced yogurt dish that can be mixed with the khichdi. Khichdi is usually not prepared with fish in Gujarat, although fish is sometimes eaten with khichdi in coastal villages where seafood is plentiful. According to &quot;Hobson-Jobson&quot;, while fish is eaten with kedgeree, the use of the term for &quot;mess of re-cooked fish ... is inaccurate&quot;.

The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb (d.1707) was fond of the Alamgiri Khichdi, a variety featuring fish and boiled eggs. It is widely believed that the dish was brought to the United Kingdom by returning British colonials who had enjoyed it in India and introduced it to the UK as a breakfast dish in Victorian times, part of the fashionable Anglo-Indian cuisine. The dish was listed as early as 1790 in the recipe book of Stephana Malcolm of Burnfoot, Dumfriesshire. The National Trust for Scotland&#x27;s book &quot;The Scottish Kitchen&quot; by Christopher Trotter notes the Malcolm recipe and other old examples, expressing the belief that the dish was devised by Scottish regiments hankering for the tastes of India. By the 19th century, Kedgeree had become a sophisticated breakfast/brunch dish in England, appearing, for example, in a Saki short story, &quot;A Bread and Butter Miss&quot;.

<text>Larne (, , the name of a Gaelic territory) is a town on the east coast of County Antrim, Northern Ireland, with a population of 18,853 at the 2021 census. It is a major passenger and freight roll-on roll-off port. Larne is administered by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. Together with parts of the neighbouring districts of Antrim and Newtownabbey and Causeway Coast and Glens, it forms the East Antrim constituency for elections to the Westminster Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly. The civil parish is in the historic barony of Glenarm Upper.

==History==

The coastal area around Larne has been inhabited for millennia, and is thought to have been one of the earliest inhabited areas of Ireland, with these early human populations believed to have arrived from Scotland via the North Channel. Knockdhu, north of Larne, was the site of a Bronze Age promontory fort and settlement. The early coastal dwellers are thought to have had a sophisticated culture which involved trading between the shores of the North Channel and between other settlements on the coasts of Scotland. The coast of Scotland is in fact clearly visible from here. Archaeological digs in the area have found flintwork and other artefacts which have been assigned dates from 6000 BC onwards. The term &quot;Larnian&quot; has even been coined by archaeologists to describe such flintworks and similar artefacts of the Mesolithic era (and one time to describe Mesolithic culture in Ireland as a whole). Larnian is also currently used to refer to people from Larne.

Larne takes its name from &quot;Latharna&quot;, a Gaelic territory or &quot;túath&quot; that was part of the Ulaid petty kingdom of &quot;Dál nAraidi&quot;. The name spelt as &quot;Latharne&quot; was used at one point in reference to the Anglo-Norman cantred of Carrickfergus. &quot;Latharna&quot; itself means &quot;descendants of Lathar&quot;, with Lathar according to legend being a son of the pre-Christian king Úgaine Mór. The town sprang up where the River Inver flows into Larne Lough. This area was known in Irish as &quot;Inbhear an Latharna&quot; (&quot;rivermouth/estuary of Latharna&quot;) and was later anglicised as &quot;Inver Larne&quot; or simply &quot;Inver&quot;. &quot;Latharna&quot; was only applied exclusively to the town in recent centuries. The Roman emperor Severus is known to have described how, in 204 AD, a Roman galley bound for Scotland veered off course to a place called Portus Saxa, which was believed to be Larne Lough.
There was Viking activity in the area during the 10th and 11th centuries AD. Viking burial sites and artefacts have been found in the area and dated to that time. &quot;Ulfreksfjord&quot; was an Old Norse name for Larne Lough. According to the Norse historian Snorri Sturluson, Connor, King of Ireland, defeated Orkney Vikings at &quot;Ulfreksfjord&quot; in 1018. Later anglicised names include &quot;Wulfrichford&quot;, &quot;Wolderfirth&quot;, &quot;Wolverflete&quot; and the surviving name &quot;Olderfleet&quot;. The ending &quot;-fleet&quot; comes from the Norse &quot;fljot&quot;, meaning &quot;inlet&quot;. &quot;Older-&quot; may come from the Norse &quot;oldu&quot;, meaning &quot;wave&quot;. The town motto is &quot;Falce Marique Potens&quot; (Latin for &quot;Powerful with the sickle and on the sea&quot;).

In the 13th century the Scots Bissett family built Olderfleet Castle at Curran Point. In 1315, Edward the Bruce of Scotland (brother of Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland) landed at Larne with his 6000 strong army en route to conquer Ireland, where Olderfleet Castle was of strategic importance. Edward saw Ireland as another front in the ongoing war against Norman England.

In 1569, Queen Elizabeth I, Queen of England and Ireland, appointed Sir Moyses Hill as the governor of Olderfleet Castle. It was seen as strategically important for any Tudor conquest of Ulster. Following the 17th century Union of the Crowns of Scotland, England and Ireland under James VI &amp; I many more settlers would have arrived to Ulster via Larne during the Plantation of Ulster. The area around County Antrim itself, however, was not part of the official 17th century Plantation; instead many Scottish settlers arrived in the area through private settlement in the 17th century.

During the 18th century many Scots-Irish emigrated to America from the port of Larne. A monument in the Curran Park commemorates the &quot;Friends Goodwill&quot;, the first emigrant ship to sail from Larne in May 1717, heading for Boston, Massachusetts in the New England region of the modern United States of America. Boston&#x27;s long standing Scots-Irish roots can be traced to Larne. The town is documented as being the first in county Antrim to be taken by United Irishmen during the ill-fated rebellion of 1798. The Protestant rebels from this area (almost entirely Presbyterian) filled Larne and engaged the government forces around 2am on the morning of 7 June. This surprise attack drove the garrison to flee the town, at which point the rebel force marched off to join up with McCracken and fight in the Battle of Antrim.

In 1914, Loyalists opposed to the Home Rule Act 1914 prepared for armed resistance. In an episode known as the Larne Gun Running German, Austrian and Italian weapons with ammunition were transported into the ports of Larne and Bangor in the dead of night and distributed throughout Ulster. This event marked a major step in cementing the right to Ulster Unionist self-determination, with the recognition of such a right ultimately leading to the creation of Northern Ireland.

=== The Troubles ===
Larne throughout the course of The Troubles had a significant paramilitary presence in the town, mostly through the presence of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA). For further information see UDA South East Antrim Brigade.

The town suffered a number of Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb attacks during The Troubles, notably including a large car bomb at the King&#x27;s Arms hotel in 1980 that caused damage to the main shopping areas, for which the IRA claimed responsibility. This incident was raised in Parliament at the time.

Incidents which involved fatalities
*16 September 1972: Sinclair Johnston a UVF member, was shot by the Royal Ulster Constabulary during street disturbances in the town when the Royal Ulster Constabulary were protecting Catholics living in St Johns Place.
*20 November 1974: Kevin Regan died from his injuries received in a UVF attack five days before on Maguires bar on Lower Cross Street. The Larne UDA blamed the IRA for the attack.
*6 February 1975: Colette Brown, a Catholic, was found by the side of the Killyglen Road after being shot by Loyalists. Two men, one a UVF member the other a Lance Corporal in the UDR (Ulster Defence Regiment) were later convicted of her murder.
*8 September 1975: Michael O&#x27;Toole a Catholic, died from his injuries sustained in a loyalist booby trap bomb attached to his car two days previously.
*24 August 1980: Rodney McCormick a Catholic, was shot dead by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) in the Antiville area of the town. The gunmen involved were convicted.
*11 July 2000: Andrew Cairns a UVF member, was killed by members of the UDA at an eleventh night bonfire celebration in a suspected loyalist feud at Boyne Square. He may also have been murdered due to his alleged involvement in an earlier assault. The Royal Ulster Constabulary detective inspector, George Montgomery, did not find any motive for the murder. David Ervine (PUP) stated that there was no Loyalist feud.

==Geography==

Larne sits on the western side of a narrow inlet that links Larne Lough to the sea. On the eastern side of the inlet is a peninsula called Islandmagee. To the west of Larne is the ancient volcanic formation of Antrim Plateau, with its glaciated valleys scenically sweeping down to the sea to the north of Larne in what are known as the Glens of Antrim. Larne is 25 miles from the Scottish mainland, with views across the North Channel towards the Mull of Kintyre, Rhins of Galloway, Islay and Paps of Jura often visible from the Larne area – this proximity to Scotland has had a defining influence on Larne&#x27;s history and culture.

The town is within the small parish of the same name. Like the rest of Ireland, this parish is divided into townlands. The following is a list of townlands within Larne&#x27;s urban area, along with their likely etymologies:

*Antiville (likely from &quot;An Tigh Bhile&quot; meaning &quot;the house of the old tree&quot;)
*Ballyboley (from &quot;Baile Buaile&quot; meaning &quot;townland of the booley/dairy place&quot;)
*Ballycraigy (from &quot;Baile Creige&quot; meaning &quot;townland of the rocky outcrop&quot;)
*Ballyloran (from &quot;Baile Loairn&quot; meaning &quot;Loarn&#x27;s townland&quot;)
*Blackcave North
*Blackcave South
*Curran and Drumalis (from &quot;Córran&quot; meaning &quot;crescent&quot; and &quot;Druim a&#x27; Lios&quot; meaning &quot;ridge of the ringfort&quot;)
*Greenland
*Inver (from &quot;Inbhear&quot; meaning &quot;rivermouth&quot;)

Many street names in Larne end in &quot;brae&quot;, such as &#x27;Whitla&#x27;s Brae&#x27; which comes from the Scots for &quot;hillside&quot;.

===Civil parish of Larne===

<text>Princeton Tiger or Tiger Magazine is the second-oldest college humor magazine in the United States, published by Princeton University undergraduates since 1882. It is best known for giving the start to literary and artistic talent as wide-ranging as F. Scott Fitzgerald, John McPhee, Jim Lee, Booth Tarkington. and Tim Ferriss, first publishing the &quot;Man from Nantucket&quot; limerick, and being the first published source using the Tiger as mascot for Princeton.

== History ==
The magazine&#x27;s style has not remained stagnant over the past 135 years. While the format in the mid-20th century still tended towards humorous, light pieces, the off-campus circulation was broader and the writing reflected it. In recent years, &quot;Tiger Magazine&quot; has moved to the internet, where it has begun to expand its topics to be more accessible to those outside of Princeton.

Past editorial boards have occasionally published material sufficiently offensive as to spark controversy. Most famous among those controversies was the &quot;Brooke Book&quot; issue of 1983, which satirized an actress named &quot;Brook Shell&quot; who had been purportedly accepted into Princeton—a thinly veiled jab at the real-life actress-model Brooke Shields, shortly after she was accepted into Princeton&#x27;s class of 1987. While the published material was substantially less obscene than some of the drafts that led to it (see the links below for details), the magazine&#x27;s graduate board was so disturbed as to fire the top undergraduate officers shortly after the issue was published. The issue became a campus cause célèbre, attracting national news attention.

The March 30, 1893 issue contained the earliest print appearance of the delayed postfixed Not! joke. &quot;Tiger Magazine&quot; also has the first recorded &quot;There once was a man from Nantucket&quot; limerick.

== Alumni ==
A number of its writers and editors later went on to notable literary or artistic careers.

<doc id="425561" wikidata="Q467000" url="?curid=425561" title="Sandra Roelofs">
<text>Sandra Elisabeth Roelofs-Saakashvili (also spelled Saakasjvili; ; born 23 December 1968) is a Dutch-Georgian activist and diplomat who was the First Lady of Georgia from 2004 to 2013, when her husband Mikheil Saakashvili was president of the country.

==Biography==
Roelofs was born in Terneuzen, Netherlands. In 1991, she graduated in French and German languages from the Erasmushogeschool in Brussels and in 1993 attended courses at the International Institute of Human Rights in Strasbourg. She met Mikheil Saakashvili in 1993 in Strasbourg and later that year moved to New York City where she worked at Columbia University and a Dutch law firm. In 1996, the couple came to Georgia, where Roelofs worked for the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Consulate of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Tbilisi.

From 1999 to 2003, Roelofs was a visiting lecturer of French language at Tbilisi State University and was a radio correspondent for Dutch radio. Beyond her native Dutch, Roelofs speaks French, English, German, Russian, and Georgian.

Roelofs acquired Georgian citizenship in January 2008 and is a dual Dutch-Georgian citizen.

Roelofs ran as a candidate for the United National Movement in the 2016 Georgian parliamentary election. She ran in the Zugdidi district and was number two on the party list. The United National Movement won 27 (nationwide) party list seats. The initial Zugdidi district vote of 8 October 2016 was nullified in several polling stations and a repeat vote was held there on 22 October 2016 and again Roelofs placed second in the district. Roelofs refused to participate in the Zugdidi district 30 October 2016 second round run-off election claiming the official results were falsified (adding not only in this election district but in the whole country). On 7 November 2016, she also gave up her party list seat and thus did not become an MP in the Georgian parliament.

Roelofs and Saakashvili have two sons, Eduard (b. 1995) and Nikoloz (b. 2005).

A few days before Saakashvili&#x27;s October 2021 return to Georgia he recorded a video on Facebook with Ukrainian MP Yelyzaveta Yasko in which they disclosed they were having a romantic relationship. A few days later Yasko remarked that Sandra Roelofs was Saakashvili&#x27;s &quot;ex-wife&quot;. There had been no media reports that Saakashvili and Roelofs had divorced. Roelofs had been &quot;caught by surprise&quot; by Yasko&#x27;s and Saakashvili&#x27;s video announcement and remarked on Facebook (on 7 October 2021) that &quot;its form was absolutely unacceptable.&quot;

Roelofs autobiographical book &quot;The Story of an Idealist&quot; (2005) has been translated into Georgian, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Turkish, Azerbaijani and English.

== Charity work ==

In 1998, Roelofs founded charity foundation SOCO which has the primary focus of implementing the programs funded by western European and Georgian companies and individuals and is aimed at supporting low income families. Since setting new targets in 2007, SOCO has been actively taking care of reproductive health and child welfare in Georgia. In 2007, Roelofs founded Radio Muza, the first Georgian radio dedicated solely to classical music.

During her period as first lady of Georgia, she was Stop TB Partnership Ambassador as well as a Goodwill Ambassador promoting Millennium Development Goals for WHO Europe. She was serving at the Board of the Global Fund fighting Aids, TB and Malaria from 2012 to 2015.

Roelofs set up breast and cervical cancer screening programs in Georgia, as well as prenatal screening and promoted palliative care and awareness about rare diseases, safety belts and healthy lifestyle.

<text>George Harris Hees (June 17, 1910 – June 11, 1996) was a Canadian politician and businessman.

==Background==
Born in Toronto, Hees was educated at the exclusive Crescent School in Toronto, Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, the Royal Military College, student #1976 (where he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Military Science in 1986), the University of Toronto, and spent a year at Cambridge University in 1933.

==Athlete==
He was a noted athlete, winning championships in boxing and lacrosse at Cambridge. As a professional football player he was a star linebacker with the Toronto Argonauts team that won the 1938 Grey Cup. While serving during the Second World War, he played in the famed &quot;Tea Bowl&quot; for the Canadian Army football team against American Army team at White City Stadium in London on February 13, 1944; the Canadians won 16-6.&lt;ref name = &quot;Coffee/Tea Bowl&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
He attended The Royal Military College of Canada from 1927 to 1931. He then attended the University of Toronto and concurrently served for four years with The Royal Grenadiers, a Militia Regiment based in Toronto. He served in the Canadian Army in North-West Europe during the Second World War. During the Battle of the Scheldt, he served as the brigade major of the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade. On 1 November 1944, he volunteered to take over command of a company of The Calgary Highlanders when all their officers were killed or wounded after crossing the Walcheren Causeway. He was wounded in the arm during the battle, evacuated, and repatriated to Canada where he was discharged from active service.

==Politics==
After placing second to Liberal candidate David Croll in the Toronto riding of Spadina in the 1945 federal election, he won election to the House of Commons of Canada in a 1950 by-election in the nearby riding of Broadview. He was also President of the Progressive Conservative Party from 1953 to 1956.

When the PCs under John Diefenbaker won government in 1957, Hees was named Minister of Transport, and oversaw the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and the new Halifax International Airport. In 1960, he was appointed Minister of Trade and Commerce. During this period, Hees was regarded as the second most powerful man in the Tory party. However, in 1963, he fell out with Diefenbaker, and became embroiled in the Munsinger Affair and elected to sit out the 1963 election. In that election, the Liberals replaced the Tories&#x27; minority government with one of their own, causing Diefenbaker&#x27;s succession with Lester B. Pearson as prime minister.

Hees considered leaving the Conservatives for the Liberals, but did not do so. He became president of the Montreal Stock Exchange. He returned to Parliament in the 1965 election as a PC, defeating Liberal MP Pauline Jewett in the rural riding of Northumberland, and remained in the front rows of the opposition ranks for almost two decades.

He ran for the leadership of the PC Party at its 1967 leadership convention, and placed fourth in a field of eleven on the first ballot. He remained for two further ballots before withdrawing, and supporting the eventual winner, Nova Scotia Premier Robert Stanfield.

He was noted for being involved in a 1972 election campaign incident. On 22 September 1972, Hees forcefully ejected campaign worker Douglas MacDonald from his motel room in Trenton, Nova Scotia. He struck MacDonald&#x27;s head against the door, shattering some glass that lacerated him in several places. During the trial, Hees tried to plead self-defence. His plea failed and on 22 February 1974, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court ordered him to pay $6,175 to MacDonald.

He was not named to Cabinet during the Joe Clark government in 1979–80, and was quoted saying, as Clark stepped down in the 1983 leadership race, &quot;We&#x27;ve got him! We&#x27;ve got the S.O.B.&quot;

In 1981, Hees was the Chairman of the Canada-US Permanent Joint Board on Defence. In this role, he was the first Canadian to bring to the attention of then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau the US request to test nuclear-capable cruise missiles over Canadian territory.

When Brian Mulroney led the party to a majority government in 1984, Hees was named Minister of Veterans Affairs. Hees retired from politics at the 1988 Canadian federal election. In 1989 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

There is a veterans wing at Toronto&#x27;s Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre bearing his name, and near the relocated Crescent School he attended as a child.

==Election results (partial)==
==In popular culture==
Hees was portrayed by Christopher Plummer in the 1997 TV miniseries &quot;The Arrow&quot;.

Following the season, Brown again became a free agent, signing with the Florida Marlins for $12.9 million over three years. In his first season with the Marlins, Brown posted a 17–11 record with 159 strikeouts and an MLB best 1.89 ERA, finishing second in the Cy Young Award voting.

In , Brown threw a one-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers in his first appearance and a no-hitter against the San Francisco Giants on June 10, 1997. The only base runner in the game for the Giants came via a HBP with two outs and two strikes in the eighth inning.

In the 1997 National League Championship Series, Brown, while sick with the flu, pitched a complete game in Game Six to defeat the Atlanta Braves and reach the World Series. Brown was the losing pitcher in both his starts against the Cleveland Indians.

===San Diego Padres===
Following the disassembly of the Marlins&#x27; championship team, Brown was traded to the San Diego Padres for Derrek Lee and prospects, where he pitched one season. He posted an 18–7 record with a career-high 257 strikeouts and a 2.38 ERA, finishing third in the Cy Young Award voting.

Masterful during the National League Division Series against the Houston Astros, San Diego won both of Brown&#x27;s starts by a 2–1 score. As the Game 1 starter opposing Randy Johnson, he allowed no runs in eight innings and struck out 16 Astros, a career-high, and second to that point in MLB playoff history only to Bob Gibson&#x27;s 17-strikeout performance in the 1968 World Series.

He helped lead the Padres to the World Series with a three-hit shutout against the Braves in the NLCS, though he did blow a save in Game 5 during a rare relief appearance. Brown was ultimately the losing pitcher in Game Four as the New York Yankees swept the Padres in the 1998 World Series.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Following the season, Brown again became a free agent. He signed a lucrative contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers for 7 years/$105 million USD, becoming the first $100 million man in baseball. Enrique Rojas of ESPN Deportes called the contract &quot;one of the worst deals ever from a team&#x27;s point of view&quot; because Brown averaged only nine wins per season and was frequently injured during the seven years of the deal.

In Brown&#x27;s first season in Los Angeles, he posted an 18–9 record with 221 strikeouts and a 3.00 ERA. After leading the NL in ERA during an injury-plagued season, his performance began to dwindle as Brown was hampered by injuries and poor run support. In , Brown rebounded, producing a respectable 14–9 record with 185 strikeouts and a 2.39 ERA.

===New York Yankees===

On December 11, 2003, Brown was traded to the New York Yankees as part of a deal that sent Jeff Weaver, Yhency Brazobán, Brandon Weeden, and $2.6 million in cash to Los Angeles. In 2004, he posted a 10–6 record with a 4.09 ERA, but experienced health problems throughout the season. Toward the end of the season, he punched a concrete column in frustration, breaking his hand. He returned to the rotation near the end of September but failed to get out of the first inning in a start at Fenway Park.

During that season&#x27;s playoffs, Brown pitched well in the Division Series, but then lasted only two innings in his first start of the 2004 American League Championship Series (ALCS) against the Red Sox.

However, it was Brown&#x27;s performance in Game 7 of the ALCS (with the Yankees trying to avoid being the first team in baseball history to lose a series they led three games to none) that he is perhaps most negatively remembered for in New York: Brown lasted less than two innings while being charged with five earned runs, including a two-run homer to David Ortiz in the first inning. He left with the bases loaded in the second inning (allowing Johnny Damon to subsequently hit the first pitch from Javier Vasquez for a grand slam).

Brown attempted to come back in but missed several games during the season due to injury. He went 4–7 with a 6.50 ERA. On February 20, , Brown announced his retirement.

==Mitchell Report==
The Mitchell Report named Brown as one of a group of Los Angeles Dodgers implicated in steroid use. The report documents allegations by Kirk Radomski that he sold Brown human growth hormone and Deca-Durabolin over a period of two or three years beginning in either 2000 or 2001. Radomski claims he was introduced to Brown by Paul Lo Duca. Radomski&#x27;s claims were supported by an Express Mail receipt dated June 7, 2004, addressed to Brown. The report also contains notes from a meeting of Dodgers executives in 2003 during which they question the medication Brown takes and include a note stating &quot;Steroids speculated by GM&quot;. Brown declined to meet with the Mitchell investigators.

Bill Plaschke states that by 2003 &quot;it was obvious to me...(and) Dodger management that...(he was) probably on steroids. We would even talk about it while watching their bulging, straining bodies from the dugout during batting practice. But the players would admit nothing, so there was nothing I could write.&quot; Brown&#x27;s temper tantrums, Plaschke notes, may have in fact been &quot;roid rage.&quot;

==Pitching assessment==
Brown was a pitcher who had the rare talent of relying both on movement and velocity. His main pitch was a sinking fastball that averaged 91–96 mph, with tremendous tailing, downward movement. He could spot it to either side of the plate. Batters facing him generally pounded this pitch into the ground or missed it entirely. He complemented this pitch with a sharp slider in the high 80s and a solid split fingered fastball he used against left-handed hitters or for another look.

Over his career, Brown won 211 games and finished his career with a 127 ERA+ (27% better than the league-wide earned run average). Only seven pitchers have won between 200 and 220 games with an ERA+ between 120 and 135. Of those seven, Stan Coveleski (215 wins, 128 ERA+), John Smoltz (213/125), Don Drysdale (209/121), and Hal Newhouser (207/130) are in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Only Curt Schilling, Eddie Cicotte (209/123) of Black Sox infamy and Brown have been excluded.

==Personal life==
Brown resides in Macon, Georgia, with his wife, Candace, and four sons: Ridge, Grayson, Dawson, and Maclain. He is currently an assistant baseball coach at Tattnall Square Academy.

Since retiring, Brown has been involved in multiple handgun-related incidents. In August 2006, his neighbor reported that Brown pulled out a gun during a dispute over yard debris. No charges were filed. In June 2018, Brown held two suspected mail thieves at gunpoint until police arrived.

<doc id="425564" wikidata="Q3127607" url="?curid=425564" title="Harold Greenberg">
<text>Harold Greenberg, OC, CQ, (January 11, 1930 – July 1, 1996) was a Canadian film producer.

==Career==
Greenberg got his start in film working in his uncle&#x27;s second-hand camera store when he was thirteen. He eventually set up his own film and photography company, obtaining the exclusive rights to footage from 1967 International and Universal Exposition or Expo 67, as it was commonly known in Montreal. In 1973 he acquired Astral Communications (aka Astral Bellevue Pathe) and subsequently combined it with his own company &quot;Ann Green Photos&quot;, named after his mother Ann Greenberg. Soon thereafter, it became one of the leading film production companies in Canada.

Astral slowly evolved into a pure play media company and expanded through the acquisition of pay television channels, such as First Choice and The Movie Network. It would go on to become a leader in the field. Greenberg went on to produce &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; franchise, one of the most successful Canadian films, spawning three sequels: &quot;Porky&#x27;s II: The Next Day&quot; (1983), &quot;Porky&#x27;s Revenge!&quot; (1985), and &quot;Pimpin&#x27; Pee Wee&quot; (2009). He also produced the critically acclaimed &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot;. He is also responsible for the development of Centre De Production de Montreal, which was set for 1989.

Harold was a staunch advocate of the viability of Canadian and Quebec cinema, going on to play a large role in the cultural exemptions included in the North American Free Trade Agreement. He was adamant that Quebec and Canada had its own industry, each having their own, separate cultures. Harold saw that Canada had distinct needs from the United States, frequently scolding industry executive from the United States when they would group Canada (and Quebec) within the wider North American marketplace. Greenberg was instrumental in creating a separate dubbing industry in Canada, citing the nuances separating Parisian and Canadian French.

==Personal life==
Greenberg was born in Montreal, Quebec, in 1930 and has three brothers, Ian, Sydney, and Harvey. Harold and his wife Edith, had three children.

==Philanthropy==
Greenberg was also a noted philanthropist and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1992, he was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec and a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur.

Greenberg recognized that there was a demand for well-written Canadian scripts, but insufficient resources in order to fund them. In April 1986, he established The FUND (Foundation to Underwrite New Drama). In 1996, after his death, it was renamed The Harold Greenberg Fund. The French-language program, Les Fonds Harold Greenberg, was also established but was closed in 2021.

==Death and legacy==
Greenberg died in 1996 and his brother, Ian Greenberg, took his place as CEO of Astral.

Since 1986, The Harold Greenberg Fund/Le Fonds Harold Greenberg has invested almost $73 million in the Canadian film and television industry in over 3,250 projects.

<doc id="425567" wikidata="Q6488936" url="?curid=425567" title="Lares Familiares">
<text>Lares Familiares are guardian household deities and tutelary deities in ancient Roman religion. The singular form is &quot;Lar Familiaris&quot;. Lares were thought to influence all that occurred within their sphere of influence or location. In well-regulated, traditional Roman households, the household Lar or Lares were given daily cult and food-offerings, and were celebrated at annual festivals. They were identified with the home to the extent that a homeward-bound Roman could be described as going &quot;ad larem&quot; (&quot;to the Lar&quot;).

==Origins==
The name &quot;Lar&quot; is of uncertain origin. It seems to derive from the Etruscan , , or , meaning &quot;lord&quot;. Ancient Greek and Roman authors offer &quot;heroes&quot; and &quot;&quot;daimones&quot;&quot; as translations of &quot;Lares&quot;

==Functions==
The &quot;Lar Familiaris&quot; cared for the welfare and prosperity of a Roman household. A household&#x27;s &quot;lararium&quot; (plural &quot;lararia&quot;), a shrine to the Lar Familiaris and other domestic divinities, usually stood near the dining hearth or, in a larger dwelling, the semi-public atrium or reception area of the dwelling. A lararium could be a wall-cupboard with doors, an open niche with small-scale statuary, a projecting tile, a small freestanding shrine, or simply the painted image of a shrine; most Romans lived in apartment blocks or small-scale rural houses, with minimal indoor facilities.
The symbolism and meanings conveyed by &quot;lararia&quot; and their contents are much disputed. Lararia usually held images of one or more bearded or crested snakes, which are presumed to represent the family genius, fertility, or generative or procreative power. &quot;Lararia&quot; almost always contain the central painted image of a togate man, head covered by a fold of his toga, as if at worship or fulfilling his domestic priestly duties, carrying or offering a &quot;patera&quot;, or sacrificial vessel. This figure is usually said to represent the head of the household, or &quot;paterfamilias&quot;. He is symmetrically flanked by two painted or sculpted Lares. The Lar Familiaris is a more-or-less standard image, like other &quot;lares&quot; he is young, slender, clad in high boots, a short tunic, and a hitched undergarment. Garlands adorn his head, and he is lithe, graceful, and nimble. He stands on tiptoe, and offers a &quot;rhyton&quot;, &quot;patera&quot;, or both; or sometimes, a cornucopia. The Lar&#x27;s statue could be moved from the &quot;lararium&quot; to wherever its presence was needed. It could be placed on a dining table during feasts or be a witness at weddings and other important family events. Brides were expected to give a coin to the Lares of the crossroads (&quot;Lares Compitalicii&quot;) of their new neighbourhood, and one to the &quot;lar&quot; of their new home.

References to domestic religious practice often pair the Lares together with the Penates. Penates, although also domestic guardian spirits, were more specifically protectors of the master of the household and his immediate family. The Lar Familiaris, on the other hand, protected all household members, free or slave, and was associated with a particular place. If a family moved out, their Penates went with them, but the Lar stayed. Tradition holds that a family&#x27;s Lar would generously help those who honored him by devotionals and sacrifices, but would turn his back to those who would not offer him thanks or neglected him.

The Roman playwright Plautus offers a moral tale concerning a household and its Lar. In the &quot;Aulularia&quot; (lines 1–36) a grandfather begs his Lar to hide the family gold, so the Lar buries it under the hearth. When the grandfather dies, the Lar does not reveal where the gold is hidden because the son has never remembered to honor the Lar; nor has the grandson, Euclio, a frightful miser. Euclio&#x27;s daughter is ready to marry, pregnant by an elderly, wealthy neighbour, but has no dowry. However, she shows a pious disposition to the Lar and towards her family, so the Lar sets in motion a complicated chain of events whereby Euclio finds the gold. Much of the play is incomplete, but what survives has Euclio seeing the error of his miserly ways. He bestows the gold upon his daughter for a dowry, so that all ends well.

<doc id="425568" wikidata="Q152750" url="?curid=425568" title="Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia">
<text>The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was a partially-annexed territory of Nazi Germany that was established on 16 March 1939 after the German occupation of the Czech lands. The protectorate&#x27;s population was mostly ethnic Czech.

After the Munich Agreement of September 1938, the Third Reich had annexed the German-majority Sudetenland to Germany from Czechoslovakia in October 1938. Following the establishment of the independent Slovak Republic on 14 March 1939, and the German occupation of the Czech rump state the next day, German leader Adolf Hitler established the protectorate on 16 March 1939, issuing a proclamation from Prague Castle. The creation of the protectorate violated the Munich Agreement.

The protectorate remained nominally autonomous and had a dual system of government, with German law applying to ethnic Germans while other residents had the legal status of Protectorate subjects and were governed by a puppet Czech administration. During World War II (1939–1945), the well-trained Czech workforce and developed industry were forced to make a major contribution to the German war economy. Since the Protectorate was just out of the reach of Allied bombers based in Britain, the Czech economy was able to work almost undisturbed until the end of the war. The Protectorate administration became deeply involved in the Holocaust in Bohemia and Moravia.

The state&#x27;s existence came to an end with the surrender of Germany to the Allies in May 1945. After the war, some Protectorate officials were charged with collaborationism, but according to the prevailing belief in Czech society, the Protectorate was not entirely rejected as a collaborationist entity.

==Background==

The Four-Year Plan that Hitler launched in September 1936 to have the German economy ready for a &quot;total war&quot; by 1940 was faltering by 1937 owing to a shortage of foreign exchange to pay for the vast economic demands imposed by the ambitious armaments targets as Germany lacked many of the necessary raw materials, which had to be imported. The British historian Richard Overy wrote the huge demands of the Four Year Plan &quot;...could not be fully met by a policy of import substitution and industrial rationalization&quot;. In November 1937 at the Hossbach conference, Hitler announced that to stay ahead in the arms race with the other powers that Germany had to seize Czechoslovakia in the very near-future. Czechoslovakia was the world&#x27;s 7th largest manufacturer of arms, making Czechoslovakia into an important player in the global arms trade.

After Czechoslovakia accepted the terms of the Munich Agreement of 30 September 1938, Nazi Germany incorporated the ethnic German majority Sudetenland regions along the German border directly into Nazi Germany. Five months later, the Nazis violated the Munich Agreement, when, with Nazi German support, the Slovak parliament declared the independence of the Slovak Republic, Adolf Hitler invited Czechoslovak President Emil Hácha to Berlin and the latter accepted his request for the German occupation of the Czech rump state and its reorganization as a German protectorate.

Hitler&#x27;s wish to occupy Czechoslovakia was largely caused by the foreign exchange crisis as Germany had exhausted its foreign exchange reserves by early 1939, and Germany urgently needed to seize the gold of the Czechoslovak central bank to continue the Four Year Plan. The British historian Victor Rothwell wrote that the Czechoslovak reserves of gold and hard currency seized in March 1939 were &quot;invaluable in staving off Germany&#x27;s foreign exchange crisis&quot;.

On 16 March when Hitler proclaimed the protectorate, he declared: &quot;For a thousand years the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia formed part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; of the German people.&quot;

There was no real precedent for this action in German history. The model for the protectorate were the Princely states in India under the Raj. In just in the same way that Indian maharajahs in the Princely states were allowed a nominal independence, but the real power rested with the British resident stationed to monitor the maharajah, Hitler emulated this practice with the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia as the German media quite explicitly compared the relationship between the Reich Protector, Baron Konstantin von Neurath and President Emil Hácha to that of a British resident and an Indian maharajah. Neurath seems to be chosen as Reich Protector in because as a former foreign minister and a former ambassador to the United Kingdom, he was well known in London for his avuncular, but dignified manner, which were the personality traits associated with the popular image of a British resident. Hitler believed that emulating the Raj would make this violation of the Munich Agreement more acceptable to Britain, and as that proved not to be the case the German media launched a lengthy campaign denouncing British &quot;hypocrisy&quot;. The German authorities intentionally allowed the protectorate &quot;all the trappings of independence&quot; in order to encourage the Czech inhabitants to collaborate with them. However, despite the protectorate having its own postage stamps and presidential guard, real power lay with the Nazi authorities.

== History ==

The population of the protectorate was mobilized for labor that would aid the German war effort, and special offices were organized to supervise the management of industries important to that effort. The Germans drafted Czechs to work in coal mines, in the iron and steel industry, and in armaments production. Consumer-goods production, much diminished, was largely directed toward supplying the German armed forces. The protectorate&#x27;s population was subjected to rationing. The Czech crown was devalued to the &quot;Reichsmark&quot; at the rate of 10 crowns to 1 &quot;Reichsmark&quot;, through actual rate should have been 6 crowns for 1 &quot;Reichsmark&quot;, a policy that allowed the Germans to buy everything on the cheap in the protectorate. Inflation was a major problem throughout the existence of the protectorate, which was made worse by the refusal of the German authorities to raise wages to keep up with inflation, making the era a period of decreasing living standards as the crowns bought less and less. Even members of the &quot;volksdeutsche&quot; (ethnic Germans) living in the protectorate complained their living standards had been higher under Czechoslovakia, which was quite a surprise to most of them, who expected their living standards to rise under German rule. 

German rule was moderate by Nazi standards during the first months of the occupation. The Czech government and political system, reorganized by Hácha, continued in formal existence. The Gestapo directed its activities mainly against Czech politicians and the intelligentsia. In 1940, in a secret plan on Germanization of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, it was declared that those considered to be racially Mongoloid and the Czech intelligentsia were not to be Germanized, and that about half of the Czech population were suitable for Germanization. Generalplan Ost assumed that around 50% of Czechs would be fit for Germanization. The Czech intellectual elite were to be removed from Czech territories and from Europe completely. The authors of Generalplan Ost believed it would be best if they emigrated overseas, as even in Siberia, they were considered a threat to German rule. Just like Jews, Poles, Serbs, and several other nations, Czechs were considered to be &quot;Untermenschen&quot; by the Nazi state. The Czechs however, were not subjected to a similar degree of random and organized acts of brutality that their Polish counterparts experienced. This is attributed to the view within the Nazi hierarchy that a large swath of the populace was &quot;capable of Aryanization&quot;, such capacity for Aryanization was supported by the position that part of the Czech population had German ancestry. There is also the fact that a relatively restrained policy in Czech lands was partly driven by the need to keep the population nourished and complacent so that it can carry out the vital work of arms production in the factories. By 1939, the country was already serving as a major hub of military production for Germany, manufacturing aircraft, tanks, artillery, and other armaments.

The Czechs demonstrated against the occupation on 28 October 1939, the 21st anniversary of Czechoslovak independence. The death on 15 November 1939 of a medical student, Jan Opletal, who had been wounded in the October violence, precipitated widespread student demonstrations, and the Germans retaliated. Politicians were arrested &quot;en masse&quot;, as were an estimated 1,800 students and teachers. On 17 November, all universities and colleges in the protectorate were closed, nine student leaders were executed, and 1,200 were sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp within Nazi Germany; further arrests and executions of Czech students and professors took place later during the occupation. (&quot;See also Czech resistance to Nazi occupation&quot;)

During World War II, Hitler decided that Neurath was not treating the Czechs harshly enough and adopted a more radical policy in the protectorate. On 29 September 1941, Hitler appointed SS hardliner Reinhard Heydrich as Deputy &quot;Reichsprotektor&quot; (&quot;Stellvertretender Reichsprotektor&quot;). At the same time, he relieved Neurath of his day-to-day duties. For all intents and purposes, Heydrich replaced Neurath as &quot;Reichsprotektor&quot;. Under Heydrich&#x27;s authority Prime Minister Alois Eliáš was arrested (and later executed), the Czech government was reorganized, and all Czech cultural organizations were closed. The Gestapo arrested and murdered people. The deportation of Jews to concentration camps was organized, and the fortress town of Terezín was made into a ghetto way-station for Jewish families.

On 4 June 1942, Heydrich died after being wounded by Czechoslovak Commandos in Operation Anthropoid. Directives issued by Heydrich&#x27;s successor, SS-&quot;Oberstgruppenführer&quot; Kurt Daluege, and martial law brought forth mass arrests, executions and the obliteration of the villages of Lidice and Ležáky. In 1943 the German war-effort was accelerated. Under the authority of Karl Hermann Frank, German minister of state for Bohemia and Moravia, within the protectorate, all non-war-related industry was prohibited. Most of the Czech population obeyed quietly until the final months preceding the end of the war, when thousands became involved in the resistance movement.

For the Czechs of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, German occupation represented a period of oppression. The number of Czech victims of political persecution and murders in concentration camps totalled between 36,000 and 55,000. After Heydrich assumed control of the Protectorate, he instituted martial law and stepped up arrests and executions of resistance fighters. Heydrich allegedly referred to Czechs as &quot;laughing beasts&quot;, reflecting Czech subversion and Nazi racial beliefs about the inferiority of Czechs.

The Jewish population of Bohemia and Moravia (118,000 according to the 1930 census) was virtually annihilated, with over 75,000 murdered. Of the 92,199 people classified as Jews by German authorities in the Protectorate as of 1939, 78,154 were murdered in the Holocaust, or 85 percent.

Many Jews emigrated after 1939; 8,000 survived at the Terezín concentration camp, which was used for propaganda purposes as a showpiece. Several thousand Jews managed to live in freedom or in hiding throughout the occupation. The extermination of the Romani population was so thorough that the Bohemian Romani language became totally extinct. Romani internees were sent to the Lety and Hodonín concentration camps before being transferred to Auschwitz-Birkenau for gassing. The vast majority of Romani in the Czech Republic today descend from migrants from Slovakia who moved there within post-war Czechoslovakia. The Theresienstadt concentration camp was located in the Protectorate, near the border to the Reichsgau Sudetenland. It was designed to concentrate the Jewish population from the Protectorate and gradually move them to extermination camps, and it also held Western European and German Jews. While not an extermination camp itself, the harsh and unhygienic conditions still resulted in the death of 33,000 of the 140,000 Jews brought to the camp while a further 88,000 were sent to extermination camps, and only 19,000 survived.

==Politics==


After the establishment of the Protectorate all political parties were outlawed, with the exception of the National Partnership (&quot;Národní souručenství&quot;). Membership of the &quot;Národní souručenství&quot; was closed to women and Jews. In the spring of 1939, about 2,130,000 men joined the group, amounting to between 98%-99% of the Czech male population. However, much of the registration for the &quot;Národní souručenství&quot; was done in the style of a census (a traditional outlet for nationalist feeling in the Czech lands), and the messages advocating joining the &quot;Národní souručenství&quot; emphasized that the group existed to affirm the Czech character of Bohemia-Moravia.

One spy for the government-in-exile in London reported: &quot;The original, observable chaos and later fear of Gestapo informants and uncertainty has changed to courage and hope. The nation is coming together, not only in the National Solidarity Movement, which the majority did only to avoid losing our national existence, but individuals are coming together and one begins to feel if the nation has a backbone again&quot;. This local Czech Fascist party was led by a ruling Presidium until 1942, after which a Vůdce (Leader) for the party was appointed.

===German government===
Ultimate authority within the Protectorate was held by the Reich Protector (&quot;Reichsprotektor&quot;), the area&#x27;s senior Nazi administrator, whose task it was to represent the interests of the German state. The office and title were held by a variety of persons during the Protectorate&#x27;s existence. In succession these were:

* 16 March 1939 – 20 August 1943:
Konstantin von Neurath, former Foreign Minister of Nazi Germany (1932–1938) and Minister without Portfolio (1938–1945). He was placed on leave in September 1941 after Hitler&#x27;s dissatisfaction with his &quot;soft policies&quot;, although he still held the title of &quot;Reichsprotektor&quot; until his official resignation in August 1943.
* 27 September 1941 – 30 May 1942:
Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the &quot;SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt&quot; (Reich Security Main Office) or RSHA. He was officially only a deputy to Neurath, but in reality was granted supreme authority over the entire state apparatus of the Protectorate.
* 31 May 1942 – 20 August 1943:
Kurt Daluege, Chief of the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Order Police) or Orpo, in the Interior Ministry, who was also officially a deputy Reich Protector.
* 20 August 1943 – 5 May 1945:
Wilhelm Frick, former Minister of the Interior (1933–1943) and Minister without Portfolio (1943–1945).

Next to the Reich Protector there was also a political office of State Secretary (from 1943 known as the State Minister to the Reich Protector) who handled most of the internal security. From 1939 to 1945 this person was Karl Hermann Frank the senior SS and Police Leader in the Protectorate. A command of the &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; was also established, known as the SS-Oberabschnitt Böhmen-Mähren. The command was an active unit of the General-SS, technically the only such unit to exist outside of Germany, since most other Allgemeine-SS units in occupied or conquered countries were largely paper commands.

===Czech government===
The Czech State President (Státní Prezident) under the period of German rule from 1939 to 1945 was Emil Hácha (1872–1945), who had been the President of the Second Czechoslovak Republic since November 1938. Rudolf Beran (1887–1954) continued to hold the office of Minister President (Předseda vlády) after the German take-over. He was replaced by Alois Eliáš on 27 April 1939, who was himself also sacked on 2 October 1941 not long after the appointment of Reinhard Heydrich as the new Reich Protector. Because of his contacts with the Czechoslovak government-in-exile Eliáš was sentenced to death, and the execution was carried out on 19 June 1942 shortly after Heydrich&#x27;s own death. From 19 January 1942 the government was led by Jaroslav Krejčí, and from January to May 1945 by Richard Bienert, the former police chief of Prague. When the dissolution of the Protectorate was proclaimed after the Liberation of Prague, a radio call was issued for Bienert&#x27;s arrest. This resulted in his conviction to a three-year prison term in 1947, during which he died in 1949.

Aside from the Office of the Minister President, the local Czech government in the Protectorate consisted of the Ministries of Education, Finance, Justice, Trade, the Interior, Agriculture, and Public Labour. The area&#x27;s foreign policy and military defence were under the exclusive control of the German government. The former foreign minister of Czechoslovakia František Chvalkovský became a Minister without Portfolio and permanent representative of the Czech administration in Berlin.

The most prominent Czech politicians in the Protectorate included:




==Population==

The area of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia contained about 7,380,000 inhabitants in 1940. 225,000 (3.3%) of these were of German origin, while the rest were mainly ethnic Czechs as well as some Slovaks, particularly near the border with Slovakia. Ethnic Germans were offered Reich citizenship, while Jews and Czechs were from the outset second-class citizens (&quot;Protectorate subjects&quot;, ).

In March 1939, Karl Frank defined a &quot;German national&quot; as:
The Nazis aimed for the protectorate to become fully Germanized. Marriages between Czechs and Germans became a problem for the Nazis. In 1939, the Nazis did not ban sexual relations between Germans and Czechs and no law prohibited Jews from marrying Czechs. The Nazis made German women who married any non-Germans lose their Reich citizenship whereas Czech women who married German men were accepted into the German &quot;Volk&quot;. Czech families aiming to improve their lives in the protectorate encouraged their Czech daughters to marry German men as it was one way to save a family business.

Hitler had approved a plan designed by Konstantin von Neurath and Karl Hermann Frank, which projected the Germanization of the &quot;racially valuable&quot; half of the Czech population after the end of the war. This consisted mainly of industrial workers and farmers. The undesirable half contained the intelligentsia, whom the Nazis viewed as &quot;ungermanizable&quot; and potential dangerous instigators of Czech nationalism. Some 9,000 Volksdeutsche from Bukovina, Dobruja, South Tyrol, Bessarabia, Sudetenland and the Altreich were settled in the protectorate during the war. The goal was to create a German settlement belt from Prague to Sudetenland, and to turn the surroundings of Olomouc (Olmütz), České Budějovice (Budweis), Brno (Brünn) and the area near the Slovak border into German enclaves.

Further integration of the protectorate into the Reich was carried out by the employment of German apprentices, by transferring German evacuee children into schools located in the protectorate, and by authorizing marriages between Germans and &quot;assimilable&quot; Czechs. Germanizable Czechs were allowed to join the Reich Labour Service and to be admitted to German universities.

==Education==
In common with the other &quot;submerged&quot; nations of Eastern Europe, the Czech &quot;intelligentsia&quot; had an immense prestige as the bearers and protectors of the national culture, who would keep the Czech language and culture alive when the Czech nation was &quot;submerged&quot;. No segment of the Czech &quot;intelligentsia&quot; faced more pressure to conform to the occupation policy than school teachers. Frank called the teachers &quot;the most dangerous wing of the &quot;intelligentsia&quot;&quot; while Heydrich referred to the teachers as &quot;the training core of the opposition Czech government [in exile in London]&quot;. To keep their jobs, teachers were required to demonstrate fluency in German and were supposed to greet their students with the fascist salute while saying &quot;Sieg Heil!&quot; (&quot;Hail Victory!&quot;). School inspectors made surprise visits to the classrooms and all chairpersons of the exam boards had to be ethnic Germans. Some teachers and students were Gestapo informers, which spread a climate of mistrust and paranoia across the school system as both teachers and students never knew whom to trust. One teacher recalled: &quot;The Gestapo even had informers and agents amongst the children. Uncertainty and mistrust destroyed any feeling of comradeship among the children&quot;.

Despite these pressures, a number of Czech teachers quietly inserted &quot;anti-&quot;Reich&quot; ideas into their lessons while refusing to greet their students with &quot;Sieg Heil!&quot;&quot;. Especially under Frank, the teachers suffered harshly. In the first six months of 1944, about 1,000 Czech teachers were either executed or imprisoned. By 1945, about 5,000 Czech teachers were imprisoned in the concentration camps, where a fifth died. By the end of the occupation, about 40% of all Czech teachers had been fired with the figure reaching 60% in Prague.

==Administrative subdivisions==
===Protectorate districts===
For administrative purposes the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was divided into two Länder: Böhmen (Bohemia) and Mähren (Moravia). Each of these was further subdivided into &quot;Oberlandratsbezirke&quot;, each comprising a number of &quot;Bezirke&quot;.

===NSDAP districts===
For party administrative purposes the Nazi Party extended its Gau system to Bohemia and Moravia when the Protectorate was established. This step divided the remaining parts of Bohemia and Moravia up between its four surrounding &quot;Gaue&quot;:
* Reichsgau Sudetenland
* Gau Bayreuth (Bavarian Eastern March)
* Reichsgau Niederdonau (Lower Danube)
* Reichsgau Oberdonau (Upper Danube)

The resulting government overlap led to the usual authority conflicts typical of the Nazi era. Seeking to extend their own powerbase and to facilitate the area&#x27;s Germanization the Gauleiters of the surrounding districts continually agitated for the liquidation of the Protectorate and its direct incorporation into the German Reich. Hitler stated as late as 1943 that the issue was still to be decisively settled.

== Military commander ==
Like in other occupied countries, the German military in Bohemia and Moravia was commanded by a &quot;Wehrmachtbefehlshaber&quot;. Through the year, the headquarter received several different names because of the complex structure of the &quot;Reichsprotektorat&quot;: &quot;Wehrmachtbevollmächtigter beim Reichsprotektor in Böhmen und Mähren&quot;, &quot;Wehrmachtbefehlshaber beim Reichsprotektor in Böhmen und Mähren&quot; and &quot;Wehrmachtbefehlshaber beim deutschen Staatsminister in Böhmen und Mähren&quot;. 
The commander also held the position of the &quot;Befehlshaber im Wehrkreis Böhmen und Mähren&quot;.

=== Commanders ===
* &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; Erich Friderici (1 April 1939 – 27 October 1941) 
* &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; Rudolf Toussaint (1 November 1941 – 31 August 1943) 
* &quot;General der Panzertruppe&quot; Ferdinand Schaal (1 September 1943 – 26 July 1944) (arrested after the 20 July plot) 
* &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; Rudolf Toussaint (26 July 1944 – 8 May 1945)

<doc id="425573" wikidata="Q1507032" url="?curid=425573" title="Latvian Way">
<text>Latvian Way () was a conservative-liberal political party in Latvia. It merged with Latvia&#x27;s First Party to form the Latvia&#x27;s First Party/Latvian Way (LPP/LC) in 2007.

It described itself as &quot;a liberal party defending people&#x27;s freedom to shape their own lives&quot;. Latvian Way was a member of Liberal International and the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party.

==History==
Latvian Way was founded on 25 September 1993, by a group of former activists of Popular Front of Latvia and Latvian exiles who had returned to Latvia after it regained independence. In its first election in 1993, Latvian Way won 32.4% of popular vote and became the leading party in a coalition government. Later, its popularity declined, with 14.6% of votes in 1995 election and 18.0% in 1998. Despite that, Latvian Way remained a powerful force in Latvian politics and was part of every coalition government in Latvia from July 1993 to November 2002. Four Latvian Way members were Prime Ministers: Valdis Birkavs (from 1993 to 1994), Māris Gailis (from 1994 to 1995), Vilis Krištopans (from 1998 to 1999) and Andris Bērziņš (from 2000 to 2002). A fifth former prime minister, Ivars Godmanis, joined the Latvian Way party after his term as prime minister ended.

In the 2002 general election, it got 4.9% of the vote, just under the 5% needed to secure representation in parliament. After this loss, several politicians left Latvian Way for other parties. Latvian Way regained some ground in the European Parliament Election in June 2004 with 6.5% of vote but it still faced an uncertain future and the difficult task of regaining voters&#x27; trust. For the 2006 election, Latvian Way formed an electoral coalition with the Latvia&#x27;s First Party. They won 10 seats in the election, allowing Latvian Way to join the coalition government. Party chairman Ivars Godmanis became Minister of the Interior in November 2006, and then prime minister in December 2007. He resigned after protests paralysed the Latvian capital, Riga, due to the global economic crisis. On 20 February 2009, Godmanis resigned as prime minister along with the rest of his government amid concerns about handling the economic crisis.

<doc id="425574" wikidata="Q239301" url="?curid=425574" title="Hope Lange">
<text>Hope Elise Ross Lange (November 28, 1933 – December 19, 2003) was an American film, stage, and television actress. She was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Selena Cross in the 1957 film &quot;Peyton Place&quot;. In 1969 and 1970, she twice won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Carolyn Muir in the sitcom &quot;The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir&quot;.

==Early life==

Lange was born into a theatrical family in Redding, Connecticut. Her father, John George Lange, was a cellist and the music arranger for Florenz Ziegfeld and conductor for Henry Cohen; her mother, Minette (née Buddecke), was an actress. They had two other daughters, Minelda and Joy, and a son, David. John worked in New York City and the family moved to Greenwich Village when Hope was a young child. 

Lange sang with other children in the play &quot;Life, Laughter and Tears&quot;, which opened at the Booth Theatre in March 1942. Her father died in September 1942. The family stayed in New York City after his death. At age 9, she had a speaking part in the award-winning Broadway play &quot;The Patriots&quot;, which opened in January 1943. From 1944 to 1956 Minette ran a restaurant on Macdougal Street, near Washington Square Park, called Minette&#x27;s of Washington Square. (Some sources confuse it with Minetta Tavern, an Italian restaurant on Macdougal Street, founded in 1937.) The entire family worked there; Minelda ran the cash register, and Joy and Hope waited on tables.

In high school, Lange studied dance, modeled, and worked in the family restaurant. She sometimes walked the dog of former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who had a nearby apartment. When her photo appeared in the newspaper, she received an offer to work as a New York City advertising model. She appeared on the June 1949 cover of &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; magazine wearing the &quot;Man from Mars&quot; Radio Hat. This portable radio built into a pith helmet was a sensation in 1949.

Lange attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, studying dance and theater. At Reed, she was a student of artist Xenia Cage. After completing her first year of studies, Lange transferred to Barmore Junior College in New York, where she met her first husband, Don Murray.

==Career==
Lange began working in television in the 1950s with appearances on &quot;Kraft Television Theatre.&quot; She was seen by a Hollywood producer and contracted to 20th Century Fox. She came to prominence in her first film role in &quot;Bus Stop&quot; with Marilyn Monroe and Don Murray, whom she married on April 14, 1956. Murray later said that Monroe grew jealous of another blonde being hired for the movie and asked the producers to dye Lange&#x27;s blonde hair light brown.
After favorable reviews, Lange landed a major role in the then-risqué 1957 film &quot;Peyton Place&quot;. Her strong performance earned her a nomination for a Golden Globe Award and another for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She subsequently became well-known for such supporting ingénue roles, and said that the resulting typecasting shortened her movie career.

She went on to appear in Nicholas Ray&#x27;s film &quot;The True Story of Jesse James&quot; (1957) as James&#x27; wife, opposite Robert Wagner; and in &quot;The Young Lions&quot; with Montgomery Clift. She starred as the wife of Jeffrey Hunter&#x27;s character in Anton Myrer&#x27;s wartime drama &quot;In Love and War&quot; (1958). These roles led to her earning top billing in &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; (1959), with Suzy Parker and Joan Crawford.

Lange appeared as Elvis Presley&#x27;s older psychologist love interest in &quot;Wild in the Country&quot; (1961), despite being only 13 months Elvis&#x27;s senior. She then appeared in Frank Capra&#x27;s final movie, &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot;, with Glenn Ford (for whom she had left her husband, fellow actor Don Murray). The next year, she co-starred with Ford again, in the romantic comedy &quot;Love Is a Ball&quot;.

Lange returned to television for a 1966 role on the series &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1963). She starred from 1968 to 1970 on the television series, &quot;The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir&quot; for which she earned two Emmy Awards. and a Golden Globe Award nomination. This success was followed by three seasons on &quot;The New Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; as Dick Van Dyke&#x27;s wife, Jenny Preston, from 1971 to 1974, after which she declined to return for a fourth season of the show. She also appeared in twelve television movies, one being &quot;Crowhaven Farm&quot; where she played the role of a witch. In 1977, she returned to the Broadway stage where her acting career had originally begun. She also played the murdered wife of Charles Bronson&#x27;s vigilante character in &quot;Death Wish&quot; (1974). In 1985, she appeared in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, and in 1986, she took a role as Laura Dern&#x27;s mother in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. She took a Broadway role in &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot; and then made appearances in the television movie based on Danielle Steel&#x27;s &quot;Message from Nam&quot; and in &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; (1994).

Lange made appearances in the Maine town in which &quot;Peyton Place&quot; had been filmed during the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary celebrations in 1998.

==Personal life==
===Date of birth===
Lange&#x27;s year of birth is often reported as 1931, but the correct year is 1933. A possible source of this error is the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest Almanac and Yearbook&quot;. It had shown the year as 1931 from as early as its 1980 edition up until its 2009 issue. (The &quot;Almanac and Yearbook&quot;&#x27;s 1976 and earlier editions had consistently reported Lange&#x27;s year of birth as 1933.) Other references such as &quot;Chase&#x27;s Annual Events&quot; have always shown 1933, as does her Social Security Death Index entry.

The 1933 year also matches the ages given in newspaper accounts of Lange in her youth. &quot;The New York Times&quot; covered the annual &quot;Young People&#x27;s Concert&quot; awards given at Carnegie Hall. Lange received an award in April 1945 and again in April 1946, when her age was given as 12. Lange&#x27;s age of 12 in April 1946 would correspond to a birthdate in November 1933, not 1931.

Also, a short feature story was published in February 1951 about Hope Lange&#x27;s culinary skills. The first paragraph gives the biography of a 17-year-old Hope Lange of Greenwich Village, New York. Her late father was &quot;director of music for Florenz Ziegfield [sic]&quot; and her mother had a catering business. In addition to modeling, acting, and dancing, Hope could make &quot;terrific&quot; sandwiches. The article gives her recipes for &quot;Sardine Strips&quot; and &quot;Cheese Ribbon&quot; sandwiches. Born in 1933, Lange would have been 17 years old in February 1951.

===Marriages and relationships===
Lange&#x27;s first marriage was to actor Don Murray. They married while he was filming his breakout role in &quot;Bus Stop&quot; with Marilyn Monroe in 1956; they had two children, actor Christopher Murray and photographer Patricia Murray. Lange left Don Murray in 1961 for actor Glenn Ford, the associate producer and co-star of &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot;. They had a four-year relationship but never married. From October 19, 1963, until their divorce in 1971, Lange was married to film director Alan J. Pakula.

In 1972, Hope dated Frank Sinatra and began a relationship with the married novelist John Cheever. In 1986, she married theatrical producer Charles Hollerith, Jr. (1927–2011), with whom she remained for the rest of her life.

==Death==
Lange died on December 19, 2003, at St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Santa Monica, California, as a result of an ischemic colitis infection at the age of 70. Her body was cremated.

<doc id="425575" wikidata="Q1573271" url="?curid=425575" title="Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party">
<text>The Latvian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (, LSDSP) is a social-democratic political party in Latvia and the second oldest existing Latvian political party after the Latvian Farmers&#x27; Union. It is currently represented with two seats in the parliament of Latvia as a part of the Union of Greens and Farmers alliance after an absence of 20 years. The party tends to hold a less Russophilic view than the Social Democratic Party &quot;Harmony&quot;.

==History==

=== Founding, interwar Latvia, under authoritarianism and occupation ===
The Latvian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party was founded on 17 June 1918, by Menshevik elements who had been expelled from the Social Democracy of the Latvian Territory in 1915. Once Latvia became independent, LSDSP was one of the two most influential political parties (along with the Latvian Farmers&#x27; Union). LSDSP held 57 out of 150 seats in the 1920 Constitutional Assembly (Satversmes Sapulce). It won the most seats in each of four parliamentary elections of that period (31 out of 100 in 1922, 33 in 1925, 26 in 1928 and 21 in 1931). The leader of the LSDSP, Pauls Kalniņš, was speaker of the Latvian parliament from 1925 to 1934.

The party itself, however, would often be in opposition because of many smaller right-wing parties forming coalition governments, typically led by the Latvian Farmers&#x27; Union.

The party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1940, and was admitted into the modern Socialist International in 1994.

The LSDSP was banned after the 1934 coup by Kārlis Ulmanis, together with all other political parties. Around 320 prominent members were briefly interned in the Liepāja Concentration Camp and then released. After the coup, the party loosely merged with the Latvian Communist Party from 1937 to 1940 as the Socialist Workers and Peasants Party of Latvia and went underground, only to re-emerge briefly after the Soviet occupation of 1940, nearly instantly being banned and driven underground by the Soviet and, later, Nazi occupiers. Some Social Democrats briefly collaborated with the Soviets (e.g. ), however, many, including leaders and Brūno Kalniņš, joined with other democratic politicians and called for the restoration of democratic Latvian statehood. LSDSP members, like Pauls Kalniņš and others, were involved with the Latvian Central Council resistance group. When many Latvians left Latvia during World War II, the LSDSP was restored as an &quot;exile organization&quot;, operating in Sweden since 1945, and later in other Western countries.

The Swedish-based section - the LSDSP Foreign Committee (LSDSP ĀK) - managed to secure its observer status at the Socialist International during its existence.

=== Return to Latvia, activities 1990–2010 ===
When Latvia became independent again in 1991, the LSDSP returned to Latvia. In the early 1990s, it struggled with internal splits. At one point, Latvia had three social democratic parties, two of them being descendants of the LSDSP, and the third being the reformed faction of the former Communist Party of Latvia (LSDP). Eventually, all three parties merged, under the name of the LSDSP.

The merged party enjoyed some success in the parliamentary election of 1998, winning 14 seats out of 100; and in local elections in 2001, when one of its members, Gundars Bojārs, became the mayor of Riga. It was less successful in the next legislative election, held on 5 October 2002, where it got only 4% of the vote, and did not make the 5% minimum to get seats. The decline of the LSDSP&#x27;s popularity continued as the party lost the mayor&#x27;s seat in Riga in the 2005 municipal election (keeping 7 seats in the Riga City Council but forced into the opposition). The parliamentary election of 2006 brought even more dissatisfying results for the LSDSP, as the party got 3.5% of votes and thus got no representation in the parliament once again.

=== 2010–present ===
For the 2010 parliamentary election, the LSDSP formed the Responsibility Alliance with smaller parties, but their performance was poor, receiving less than 1% of the vote. In January 2011, , who was supported by the outgoing leader , was elected as party chairman. He defeated Ansis Dobelis, who was more aligned with youth activist circles and later formed The Progressives. His tenure did not improve the party&#x27;s performance, with the LSDSP not running in the 2014 parliamentary election. By 2017, Dinēvičs had returned to lead the party. At the 2018 election, the party received just 0,21% of the vote.

2022 brought a historic turn for the party, when on June 1 it joined the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS) after the Latvian Green Party had left the alliance, as the second member of ZZS is the Farmer&#x27;s Union, LSDSP&#x27;s main rival in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 2022 elections, the party managed to get two of its members elected on the ZZS list, marking a return to the Saeima after an absence of 20 years.

In 2012, the Socialist International demoted LSDSP to observer member for not paying membership fees. The party was officially delisted from the Socialist International in December 2014. It currently maintains the status of observer member in the Party of European Socialists.

<doc id="425576" wikidata="Q7554365" url="?curid=425576" title="Software standard">
<text>A software standard is a standard, protocol, or other common format of a document, file, or data transfer accepted and used by one or more software developers while working on one or more than one computer programs. Software standards enable interoperability between different programs created by different developers.

==How it is used and applied==
Software standards consist of certain terms, concepts, data formats, document styles and techniques agreed upon by software creators so that their software can understand the files and data created by a different computer program. To be considered a standard, a certain protocol needs to be accepted and incorporated by a group of developers who contribute to the definition and maintenance of the standard.

Some developers prefer using standards for software development because of the efficiencies it provides for code development and wider user acceptance and use of the resulting application.

The protocols HTML, TCP/IP, SMTP, POP and FTP are examples of software standards that application designers must understand and follow if their software expects to interface with these standards. For instance, in order for an email sent using Microsoft Outlook to be read by someone using Yahoo! Mail, the email must be sent using the SMTP so that the recipient&#x27;s software can understand and correctly parse and display the email. Without such a standardized protocol, two different software applications would be unable to accurately share and display the information delivered between each other.

Some other widely used data formats, while understood and used by a variety of computer programs, are not considered a software standard. Microsoft Office file formats, such as .doc and .xls, are commonly converted by other computer programs to use, but are still owned and controlled by Microsoft, unlike text files (TXT or RTF.)

==Creation of a software standard==
Representatives from standards organizations, like W3C and ISOC, collaborate on how to make a unified software standard to ensure seamless communication between software applications. These organisations consist of groups of larger software companies like Microsoft and Apple Inc. 

The complexity of a standard varies based on the specific problem it aims to address but it needs to remain simple, maintainable and understandable. The standard document must comprehensively outline various conditions, types, and elements to ensure practicality and fulfill its intended purpose. For instance, although both FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) facilitate computer-to-computer communication, FTP specifically handles the exchange of files, while SMTP focuses on the transmission of emails.

==Open versus closed standards==
A standard can be a closed standard or an open standard. The documentation for an open standard is open to the public and anyone can create a software that implements and uses the standard. The documentation and specification for closed standards are not available to the public, enabling its developer to sell and license the code to manage their data format to other interested software developers. While this process increases the revenue potential for a useful file format, it may limit acceptance and drive the adoption of a similar, open standard instead.

<doc id="425579" wikidata="Q1250133" url="?curid=425579" title="People's Party (Latvia)">
<text>The People&#x27;s Party (, TP) was a conservative political party in Latvia. The People&#x27;s Party was the leader of three governments and a member of another four.

== History ==

Tautas partija was founded in 1998 by Andris Šķēle, a businessman and former prime minister, who was the chairman of the party until 2002. Because of Šķēle&#x27;s powerful personality, many voters identified the party with its leader during this period. In 2002, Šķēle exited politics and Atis Slakteris became the chairman of Tautas partija. At the October 2002 elections the party became the third largest in the Saeima (parliament), winning 16.7% of the vote and 20 seats. In 2004, People&#x27;s Party member Aigars Kalvītis became prime minister.

At the legislative elections, on 7 October 2006, the party won 19.49% of the popular vote and 23 out of 100 seats in the Saeima, becoming the largest party in parliament and maintaining its status as leader of the coalition government, with Kalvītis as prime minister. The post of the Prime Minister was lost in 2007, but the party retained its place in the coalition under Ivars Godmanis of the Latvian Way party, and then until spring of 2010 under Valdis Dombrovskis of the New Era Party. However at the 2010 elections, the first after the Latvian economic crisis, the party lost most of its support, winning just 4 seats in the elections.

Tautas partija was a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP).

On July 9, 2011, 248 out of 308 party congress delegates voted to disband the People&#x27;s Party. According to some political analysts, it was done in order to avoid repaying a Ls1.03 million campaign donation it received and spent illegally in 2006, but party chairman Andris Šķēle denied that. On September 22, 2011, the Senate of the Supreme Court of Latvia refused People’s Party appeal against the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau&#x27;s decision to make it pay back 1.03 million lats, however on December 16, 2011, the People&#x27;s Party was declared insolvent by the Riga City Central District Court.

<doc id="425581" wikidata="Q1070311" url="?curid=425581" title="Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party">
<text>The Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (, , ), abbreviated to LSAP or POSL, is a social democratic, pro-European political party in Luxembourg. The LSAP sits on the centre-left of the political spectrum.

The LSAP is the third-largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, having won 11 of 60 seats at the 2023 general election, and has one seat in the European Parliament. Since March 2022, the party&#x27;s President have been Francine Closener and Dan Biancalana.

The party is close to the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions, the country&#x27;s largest trade union centre, but they have no formal links. The LSAP is particularly strong in the south of the country, controlling most of the mayoralties in the large towns of the Red Lands. It is affiliated with the Socialist International, the Progressive Alliance, and the Party of European Socialists.

==History==
The party was formed on 5 July 1902 as the Social Democratic Party. Left-wing elements split in 1905 to create the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party. These were both re-united in 1912. In 1916, the party was renamed to &#x27;Socialist Party&#x27;, part of the Second International.

On 2 January 1921, communist elements split to create the Communist Party of Luxembourg. The Socialist Party was renamed the &quot;Luxembourg Workers&#x27; Party&quot; in 1924, and was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1940. On 5 November 1937, the Party joined the government for the first time, in a coalition under Prime Minister Pierre Dupong.

===Post-war===
The party was reformed after the Second World War as the &#x27;Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;, in the mould of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, where the government had been exiled. In the first election after the war, in 1945, the LSAP was the big loser, falling to 26% of the vote, but remained in the National Union Government, along with all other parties. In 1947, the party started its process of re-building itself, and it managed to join a coalition government (1951–1959 in the Dupong-Bodson and Bech Bodson governments, and 1964–1968 in the Werner-Cravatte government). The discussions over the party&#x27;s direction split the LSAP again. On 2 May 1970, Henry Cravatte was ejected as President by a trades union-led coup. In March 1971, centrist elements, led by Cravatte, split to create the Social Democratic Party. Those who left included 6 Deputies and most of the party leadership.

However, the LSAP could recover by 1974 and joined the DP in a centre-left coalition (the Thorn-Vouel-Berg government), which enacted important social reforms: judicial system reforms (including a humanisation of the penal system), introduction of a fifth week of holiday, general introduction of the 40-hour week, the salary index, reform of unemployment benefits. This did not prevent an electoral defeat in 1979. In this legislative period, the LSAP held their famous energy conference, and decided a moratorium for the atomic power station of Remerschen. This was the definitive end of the project.

In 1984, the LSAP were re-united with most of the Social Democratic Party (some members joined the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party).

===Recent history===
Following the 2004 general election, the LSAP served in the government of Luxembourg as junior partner to the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party (CSV) under Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker in the first Juncker–Asselborn government, with the LSAP&#x27;s Jean Asselborn serving as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs. The coalition with the CSV continued as the second Juncker–Asselborn government following the 2009 general election, which lasted until July 2013 when the LSAP withdrew its support from the government, necessitating early elections.

Following the 2013 general election, the LSAP was in a three-party Bettel–Schneider government with the Democratic Party and The Greens, with the Democratic Party&#x27;s Xavier Bettel serving as Prime Minister and Etienne Schneider of the LSAP as Deputy Prime Minister. Since 2023, they have been in opposition again.

<doc id="425582" wikidata="Q1029792" url="?curid=425582" title="Democratic Party (Luxembourg)">
<text>The Democratic Party (DP; , , ), is the major social-liberal political party in Luxembourg. One of the three major parties, the DP sits on the centre to centre-right, holding moderate market liberal views combined with a strong emphasis on civil liberties, human rights, and internationalism.

Founded in 1955, the party is currently led by Lex Delles. Its former president, Xavier Bettel, was the Prime Minister of Luxembourg from 2013 to 2023, leading the Bettel I and II governments in coalition with the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (LSAP) and The Greens. It is the second-largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, with fourteen seats out of sixty, having won 17.8% of the vote at the 2023 general election, and has two seats in the European Parliament out of six. The party&#x27;s stronghold is around Luxembourg City, where it has held the mayorship for all but 7 years since the end of World War II.

The party has often played the minor coalition partner to the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party (CSV). In Gaston Thorn and Xavier Bettel, the DP has provided the only Prime Ministers of Luxembourg since 1945 not to be affiliated with the CSV (1974–1979 and 2013–2023). The party is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) and the Liberal International. The party has been one of the most influential liberal parties in Europe, due to its strength, its regular involvement in government, its role in international institutions, and Thorn&#x27;s leadership.

==History==

===Emergence as major party===
Although the party traces its history back to the foundation of the Liberal League in 1904, it was founded in its current form on 24 April 1955. It was the successor to the Democratic Group, which had grown out of the major group of war-time liberal resistance fighters, the Patriotic and Democratic Group. The DP spent the majority of the 1950s and 1960s, under the leadership of Lucien Dury and then Gaston Thorn, establishing itself as the third major party, ahead of the Communist Party.

At the time of its foundation, the party had six seats in the Chamber of Deputies. At the following election in 1959, the DP won 11 seats, allowing it to serve as a minor role in a grand coalition with the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party (CSV) and Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (LSAP). However, in 1964, the party went back to six seats. In 1968, the DP absorbed the anti-establishment Popular Independent Movement. In that year&#x27;s election, the party benefited from a tide of moderates shifting from an increasingly radical LSAP, returned to 11 seats, and consequently entered into government with the CSV under Prime Minister Pierre Werner.

===Government===
The DP remained in coalition with the CSV until 1974, when it experienced a surge in support in the 1974 general election, to 22.2% of the vote and 14 seats. This political upset gave it the opportunity to enter into coalition negotiations with the second-placed LSAP. Surprisingly, in the negotiations, the DP got the upper hand, securing the most ministerial positions and departments, as well as the premiership itself under Gaston Thorn.

The formation of Thorn&#x27;s government, however, coincided with the beginning of an economic crisis, and the government was occupied mostly with the restructuring of the steel industry whilst attempting to avoid mass unemployment.

Despite this, the coalition managed to push through major reforms of social policy, including abolishing capital punishment (1974), allowing no-fault divorce (1975) and broadening at-fault divorce (1978), and legalising abortion (1978). In 1977, the government abandoned plans to build a nuclear power plant at Remerschen, of which the DP had been the primary advocate. When PM, in 1975, Thorn sat as President of the United Nations General Assembly.

===Since 1979===
In 1979, Thorn went head-to-head with Werner, with the LSAP serving a supporting role to the DP. Both the CSV ended victorious, gaining six seats, and the LSAP&#x27;s loss of three seats made it impossible for the DP to renew the coalition with them. As a result, Werner formed a coalition with the DP, with Thorn as Deputy Prime Minister. In the first European election in 1979, the DP won 2 seats: an achievement that it hasn&#x27;t matched since. In 1980, Thorn was named the new President of the European Commission, and was replaced by Colette Flesch.

The 1984 general election saw the DP&#x27;s first electoral setback in twenty years. The DP lost one seat, standing on 14, whilst the resurgence of the LSAP meant it overtook the Democratic Party once again. The LSAP formed a coalition with the CSV, with Jacques Poos serving as Deputy Prime Minister to Jacques Santer. This was renewed twice again, and the DP remained out of government until 1999.

After the 1999 general election, the DP became the second-largest party in the Chamber of Deputies once again, with 15 seats. It also overtook the LSAP in vote share for the first time ever. This allowed it to displace the LSAP as the CSV&#x27;s coalition partner, with Lydie Polfer as Deputy Prime Minister. As a result of the 2004 general election, the DP lost 5 seats, bringing its total down to 10. The party also lost its place as the coalition partner back to the LSAP, and remained in opposition until 2013. In the 2013 general election, held early due to the collapse of the second Juncker–Asselborn government, the party acquired 13 deputies with 18.3% of the vote, becoming joint second-largest party along with the LSAP. In October 2013 the DP negotiated a three-party coalition government with the LSAP and The Greens, and on 4 December 2013 the Bettel-Schneider government was sworn in, with DP leader Xavier Bettel serving as Prime Minister. The 2018 general election saw the DP lose a seat, but the three-party coalition was able to maintain its majority under the Bettel II Government. In 2023, though the DP gained the most votes in its history and had its best result since 1999 with 14 seats, the electoral defeat of the Greens, who went from 9 to 4 seats, meant the government lost its majority. The party became a junior coalition partner to the CSV, with Bettel becoming Deputy Prime Minister in the Frieden-Bettel Government.

==Ideology==
The Democratic Party sits on the moderate centre-right of the political spectrum in Luxembourg. Since the late 1960s, thanks to the secularisation of Luxembourg and the CSV, the party has moved gradually towards the centre, to allow it to form coalitions with either the CSV or LSAP. Now, it could be seen to be to the left of the CSV, in the centre, and with more in common with the British Liberal Democrats or German Free Democratic Party than with liberal parties in Belgium or the Netherlands. However, the CSV usually prefers forming coalitions with the LSAP to those with the DP, pushing the DP to the economically liberal right.

In economic policies, the DP is a strong supporter of private property rights, free trade, and the free market, although under Thorn&#x27;s government, the DP greatly increased public sector employment. Taxation plays a major role in the party platform. It is also a supporter of agriculture, particularly the wine industry. It long advocated the advancement of nuclear power, but scrapped plans to build a plant at Remerschen, and now supports renewable alternatives, although not opposing nuclear power in principle. Indicating its priorities, when in government, the DP has usually or always controlled ministries in charge of Transport, Public Works, the Middle Class, the Civil Service, and Energy.

The DP is the most outspoken party in support of civil liberties. Between 1974 and 1979, it legalised abortion and divorce, and abolished the death penalty. It also focuses its attention on the issues of minority groups, particularly migrant groups, but also homosexuals and single mothers. Unlike the Catholic CSV, the DP is notably anti-clerical, which gives it more importance than its electoral performances would suggest.

The DP has led the CSV and LSAP in becoming more internationalist in outlook, focusing on the European Union, environmentalism, and advocacy of human rights abroad. It is the most vocal supporter of European integration, even in a particularly pro-EU country. The party puts great emphasis on the role of the United Nations, and Thorn served as President of the UN General Assembly. The party is centrist on national security, supporting membership of NATO, but having worked to end conscription.

==Organization ==

=== Presidents ===
The leader of the party is the president. Below is a list of presidents of the Democratic Party, and its predecessors, since 1948.
* Lucien Dury (1948–1952)
* Eugène Schaus (1952–1959)
* Lucien Dury (1959–1962)
* Gaston Thorn (1962–1969)
* René Konen (1969–1971)
* Gaston Thorn (1971–1980)
* Colette Flesch (1980–1989)
* Charles Goerens (1989–1994)
* Lydie Polfer (1994–2004)
* Claude Meisch (2004–2013)
* Xavier Bettel (2013–2015)
* Corinne Cahen (2015–2022)
* Lex Delles (2022–)

=== Political support ===

The DP has been consistent in its advocacy of the middle class, and consequently has a very distinctive class profile. When in government, the DP has always held the office of Minister for the Middle Class. Most DP supporters are civil servants, white-collar workers, self-employed people, and those on high incomes. This group has been fast-growing, further focusing the party&#x27;s electoral socio-economic appeal.

The party&#x27;s most successful areas electorally are Luxembourg City and its wealthy suburbs, where those groups are concentrated. The Mayor of Luxembourg City has come from the DP since 1970, and the party and its liberal predecessors have been out of the office for only seven years since the foundation of the Liberal League in 1904. The city lies in the Centre constituency, where the DP challenges the CSV for the most seats. However, the party also has some traditional following in Est and the Nord, consistently coming second in each.

The party has notably more support amongst young people, whilst the CSV, LSAP, and (recently) the Alternative Democratic Reform Party tend to receive the votes of older people. Unlike the CSV and LSAP, the DP is not affiliated to a major trade union. The party is particularly popular amongst male voters. Despite its anti-clericalism, DP voters are no less religiously affiliated than the general population.

<doc id="425596" wikidata="Q1186346" url="?curid=425596" title="Democratic Union for Integration">
<text>The Democratic Union for Integration (, ) is the largest ethnic Albanian political party in North Macedonia and the third largest political party in the country. It was formed immediately after the country&#x27;s 2001 armed conflict between the National Liberation Army and Macedonian security forces. NLA founder Ali Ahmeti has been the party&#x27;s president ever since.

==History==
The party was founded on 5 June 2002 by former NLA leader Ali Ahmeti, who has been the party&#x27;s president ever since. In the 2002 parliamentary election, the party won 12.1% of the popular vote (roughly 70% of the Albanian vote) and 16 of 120 seats, compared to 7 seats by Democratic Party of Albanians and 2 seats by Party for Democratic Prosperity.

From 2002 to 2006, it was part of the ruling &quot;Together for Macedonia&quot; coalition along with the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) and the Liberal Democratic Party. In the 2006 parliamentary election, the party formed a coalition with the Party for Democratic Prosperity and the Democratic League of Bosniaks. This coalition received 12.2% of the vote and 16 seats. Although DUI won the most seats among ethnic Albanian parties (13), since their governmental partners lost the election, it was not invited by the newly elected Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski to participate in the government. Its place was taken by the second-largest ethnic Albanian political party, the Democratic Party of the Albanians. However, after the 2008 early parliamentary election, the party returned to the government in a coalition with Gruevski&#x27;s VMRO-DPMNE.

In the 2011 parliamentary election, DUI received 10.2% of the total vote, winning 15 seats, a loss of 3 seats from the previous election. DUI had the best election result in the 2014 parliamentary election when it received 153,646 votes (14.2%), winning 19 seats, and had the worst result in the next election in 2016, receiving 86,796 votes (7.5%). In 2016, DUI entered the government in a coalition with SDSM.

In the campaign for the 2020 parliamentary election, DUI made its participation in any coalition contingent on the nominee for Prime Minister being an ethnic Albanian, which both SDSM and VMRO-DPMNE have refused. On 18 August, SDSM and DUI reached a deal on a coalition government as well as a compromise on the issue of an ethnic Albanian Prime Minister.

On World Environment Day in 2021, Ahmeti announced the party will focus more on environmental issues, citing Greta Thunberg&#x27;s activism as inspiring the party&#x27;s new direction.

In 28 January Talat Xhaferi of Democratic Union for Integration has been elected as prime minister of the technical government of North Macedonia which, in accordance with the Pržino Agreement, will lead the country in the 100 days prior to the parliamentary elections scheduled for 8 May.

<doc id="425598" wikidata="Q379498" url="?curid=425598" title="Munsinger affair">
<text>The Munsinger affair was Canada&#x27;s first national political sex scandal in 1966. The affair involved Gerda Munsinger, a German citizen who had been convicted in Germany as a common prostitute, a petty thief and a smuggler, who emigrated to Canada in 1956 in spite of a warning card dated 1952, and who in 1960 was the mistress of the former Associate Minister of National Defence Pierre Sévigny. Munsinger was &quot;a self-admitted espionage agent&quot; in the employ of the &quot;Russian Intelligence Service&quot;.

==The affair in Ottawa==
Munsinger had been accepted into a Canadian Immigration program looking for young women displaced by war to work as domestics and au pairs in Canada. She arrived in Quebec City aboard the &quot;Acosta Sun&quot; in search of a better life. She was assigned to a family in Montreal. She eventually left that job and went on to find work as a hostess in Montreal&#x27;s nightclub scene. Munsinger also worked part-time as a waitress at the Chic &#x27;n&#x27; Coop Restaurant which was owned by the gangster William Obront of the Cotroni family. 

As she was an attractive woman, she also moonlighted as a model for several Montreal furriers. Her looks and good humour made her popular amongst high society. She was introduced to many notable businessmen and politicians. Most noted amongst these was the Associate Minister of National Defence, Pierre Sévigny, who met her in the summer of 1958. She applied for Canadian citizenship in 1960. A routine security check by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) discovered elements in her background that raised questions. The file was supplied to the RCMP by a foreign intelligence service, the CIA. She was put under surveillance. Sévigny was observed visiting her apartment in November 1960. The RCMP informed Justice Minister E. Davie Fulton of her activities. Fulton brought the file to the attention of Prime Minister Diefenbaker. Diefenbaker ordered Sévigny to break off the relationship with Munsinger and continue on with his duties. Munsinger left Canada to return to East Germany in 1961. Rumours circulated that she died of leukemia upon her return.

==Possible security breach==
After the Gouzenko affair, matters of Canadian national security were not usually made the subject of public debate. In 1966, however, the Liberal government came under attack for a security breach involving two Soviet diplomats and George Victor Spencer, a Vancouver mail clerk, who confessed to collecting information for the Soviet Embassy. On March 4, John Diefenbaker called Liberal Justice Minister Lucien Cardin &quot;a dwarf in giant&#x27;s clothing&quot; for his handling of the Spencer case. Two days later, Cardin rebutted the Tories by bringing up Munsinger&#x27;s name in the House of Commons responding to Diefenbaker&#x27;s attacks. Cardin was told that Munsinger was dead. His aim was to criticize Diefenbaker&#x27;s handling of the case five years earlier.

The day after Justice Minister Cardin pronounced to the Canadian press that she was indeed dead, Munsinger was tracked down and interviewed in Munich by &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot; reporter Robert Reguly. She freely admitted her numerous affairs with government officials to the Canadian media. The story dominated the media for weeks and was followed with rapt attention across the country. It became a massive distraction and all but shut down all other parliamentary activity for some weeks.

A Royal Commission was immediately convened. In his report, Supreme Court Justice Wishart Spence found no criminal wrongdoing or security breach, but he did criticize Diefenbaker&#x27;s handling of the case.

==Legacy==
Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s gambit to distract a nation from scandals plaguing his government partially worked but eventually backfired on him. His weak leadership of the Liberal party came into question with his handling of this affair. He was replaced as leader of the party by Pierre Elliot Trudeau in 1968. Diefenbaker did not fare any better. A cabal of dissidents led by Dalton Camp and Flora MacDonald saw to it that he too was replaced as leader of the Progressive Conservative party by Robert Stanfield the previous year. The vitriol, recriminations and political mudslinging in Parliament created by the affair almost destroyed the House of Commons.

The newsmagazine &quot;This Hour Has Seven Days&quot; published a series on the scandal and one of the major news organizations involved in covering it as it unfolded. The series was cancelled by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) just weeks after the Munsinger Affair broke. The real reason for its cancellation as believed by some observers was that the show&#x27;s dogged pursuit of the story would uncover the truth behind Pearson&#x27;s ascension to power in 1963 when six Creditistes mysteriously crossed the floor in support of the Liberals giving them a majority in the House just days after having fought an election campaign in April of that year.

Charles Lynch, bureau chief of Southam News, suggested the Munsinger affair might change Canada&#x27;s &quot;dull and unexciting&quot; image, and promote the upcoming Expo 67.

<doc id="425605" wikidata="Q2073214" url="?curid=425605" title="Martin Abern">
<text>Martin &quot;Marty&quot; Abern ( Martin Abramowitz; December 2, 1898 – April 1949) was a Marxist politician who was an important leader of the Communist youth movement of the 1920s as well as a founder of the American Trotskyist movement.

==Background==
Martin Abern was born on December 2, 1898, in Berlad, Romania, the son of Joseph Abramovitz an ethnic Jewish peddler and Hinda Schwartz and brother of Rita Abramovitz. The family emigrated to the United States in 1902, moving to Minneapolis the following year. Abern attended public elementary school and high school in Minneapolis. He married Lydia Winter in November 1928.

==Career==

===Socialist===

The young man was radically inclined from an early age, joining the Socialist Party of America&#x27;s youth section, the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League in 1912, the Socialist Party itself in 1915, as well as the Industrial Workers of the World. He attended the University of Minnesota for two years, starring on the football team. The radical Abern staunchly opposed World War I and following American entry into that conflict he refused induction into the military on political grounds. This refusal to join the military resulted in his expulsion from the university and ultimately led to a six-month prison term.

===Communist===
Abern seems to have been a member of the Communist Party of America at the time of its establishment in the fall of 1919 or shortly thereafter. In November 1920, the US Department of Justice attempted to make Abern a test case for the deportation of alien radicals citing Communist Party membership as sole grounds for action. He was saved from deportation at the last minute by a court order obtained by his attorney.

Abern was a delegate to the 2nd World Congress of the Young Communist International (YCI), held in Moscow in June 1921, where he was made a member of the Executive Committee of the YCI. He also held a seat on the governing National Executive Committee of the Young Workers League of America (YWL) from May 1922 and was reelected by the convention of that organization held the following year. Abern served as Secretary of the YWL from May 30, 1922, to October 19, 1922, ostensibly resigning for reasons of health.

Abern was also sent to Moscow to attend the 4th World Congress of the Comintern late in the fall of 1922. Upon his return he was made a member of the Central Executive Committee of the now legal Communist Party, the Workers Party of America, where he would develop a close ideological affinity and working relationship with James P. Cannon, a leading light of the legal party.

Abern also briefly was part of a three-person Secretariat running the Young Workers League in the summer and fall of 1924 before being replaced as National Secretary on October 15 by John Williamson. In 1925 Cannon became the National Secretary of International Labor Defense, the legal defense arm of the American Communist movement, Abern joined him as assistant national secretary and thereafter dedicated most of his effort in an attempt to build the size and influence of that parallel mass organization of the Workers (Communist) Party.

In 1926, Abern wrote a two-part, two-day article entitled &quot;Can the Workers Write for Our Press?

Abern then took an important leadership role in the adult Workers (Communist) Party of America, becoming the District Organizer of the party&#x27;s important Chicago district in 1928 and sitting on the governing Central Executive Committee of the organization. Abern was a steadfast supporter of the majority faction of Foster-Cannon-Lore during the bitter factional fighting that continued ceaselessly throughout the decade.

===Trotskyist===

Together with Jim Cannon and youth leader Max Shachtman, Abern was expelled from the Workers (Communist) Party in 1928 for supporting Leon Trotsky. He was a founding member of the Communist League of America (CLA) in May 1928 and sat on the governing National Committee of that organization from 1931 to 1934. In this interval Shachtman and Cannon were increasingly at odds with one another, with Abern tending to follow Shachtman in matters of controversy.

Abern was also a founding member of Workers Party of the United States in 1934, formed when the CLA merged with A.J. Muste&#x27;s Workers Party. He was a member of the National Committee of that organization from 1934 to 1936. In that year he and other Trotskyists entered the Socialist Party &quot;en masse&quot; as part of the so-called &quot;French Turn&quot; tactic, a brief interlude ending with their expulsion late in 1937.

In 1938, Abern helped found the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and he was on the National Committee of that organization from 1938 until 1940. The April 1940 convention of the SWP instructed the National Committee of the party to take disciplinary action against Abern, Shachtman, James Burnham, and their factional supporters if that group failed to abide by the decisions of the convention. In accordance with these instructions, the National Committee suspended Burnham, Shachtman, and Abern at its meeting of April 22, 1940, giving the members of this so-called &quot;petty-bourgeois opposition&quot; an opportunity to recant and return to the party. Burnham left the radical movement at this time, while Abern joined Max Shachtman&#x27;s in establishing a new organization called the Workers Party of the United States (WPUS). The pair were expelled from the SWP by a Plenum Conference held in Chicago from Sept. 27 to 29, 1940.

Abern was elected to the governing National Committee of the WPUS at the time of its formation in 1940 and remained in the top leadership of that organization for the rest of his life.

==Death==
Abern, who adopted the party name Harry Allen, was a central leader of the Workers Party and frequent contributor to its paper, &quot;Labor Action,&quot; until his death from a heart attack in April 1949. Abern was 50 years old at the time of his death.

==Legacy==
Abern&#x27;s papers comprise part of the John Dwyer Papers held by Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. A small collection of his correspondence with Leon Trotsky is also housed at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

<doc id="425614" wikidata="Q1674673" url="?curid=425614" title="35th Paratroopers Brigade (Israel)">
<text>The 35th Paratroopers Brigade (, &quot;Hativat HaTzanhanim&quot;) is an Israeli military airborne infantry brigade. It is a selective unit, which accepts new recruits following physical tryouts and interviews, and consists of volunteers. It forms a major part of the Israeli Ground Forces&#x27; Infantry Corps, and has a history of carrying out special operations from the 1950s onwards. Soldiers of the brigade wear maroon berets with the Infantry Corps pin and russet boots. 

As part of an IDF tradition unique to the brigade, its soldiers wear a tunic and belt over their shirts. The IDF maintains four reserve paratrooper brigades, currently the 55th, 226th, and 646th, at all times, whose enlisted personnel consist of reservists that have already completed their compulsory military service in the 35th Brigade.

== History ==
In 1949 Chaim Laskov asked Machalnik Captain Tom Derek Bowden to create a paratroop school. He did so, writing a training manual with the help of his Hebrew-speaking secretary Eva Heilbronner and training soldiers with British Army surplus equipment. Bowden returned to England in 1950.

The brigade was created in the mid-1950s when the commando Unit 101 was merged with the 890th Battalion (the IDF&#x27;s Airborne Commando unit) in order to form an elite infantry brigade. The new unit was equipped with the IMI Uzi submachine gun as their primary weapon as it provided light and small automatic fire, essential properties for recon units and commandos.

The goals in creating the Paratroopers Brigade were: 
# To have an elite leading force.
# To innovate and improve fighting skills within other units.
# To raise the next generation of military commanders and officers.

The first commander of the Paratroopers Brigade was Ariel Sharon.

The Paratroopers Brigade has had only one operational combat parachute drop, during the 1956 Sinai War. In the Six-Day War (1967) reservists from this unit, formed into the 55th Paratroopers Brigade, took part in the capture of Jerusalem, along with the Jerusalem Brigade, Harel Brigade and armored support. The 55th Brigade paratroopers were the ones to capture the Western Wall and the Temple Mount, considered a historic moment and the highlight of the war by the Israeli public due to the sanctity of these places to the Jewish people.

Over the years, the Paratroopers Brigade has been the source of several future Israeli Chiefs of Staff, including Shaul Mofaz, Moshe Ya&#x27;alon, Benny Gantz and Aviv Kochavi.

== Selection and training ==
Service in the Paratroopers is voluntary and requires passing an intense two-day selection process that includes tests of physical fitness as well as emotional preparedness, leadership skills and the ability to cooperate in a group. Each year the brigade receives five times more applicants than it can accept. Paratrooper recruits go through a year of training, and more than a quarter drop out.

The paratrooper training course includes fitness training, Krav Maga training, harsh combat skills, specializing in a wide range of weapons, field craft, long marches with heavy equipment, weeks of survival training including navigation and camouflage, helicopter training, jump training, collaboration with other units, close quarters combat, and urban warfare. The course begins with four months of basic infantry training followed by advanced training that ends with a &quot;Beret March&quot;, where recruits march 80 kilometers in full combat gear, after which they are inducted into the IDF.

== Battles and operations ==
=== Reprisal operations ===
The Paratroopers Brigade played a key role in the Reprisal operations, a series of retaliatory raids into Arab territory in response to fedayeen attacks on Israel. In 1955, the 890th battalion of the Paratroopers Brigade carried out Operation Elkayam, successfully attacking Egyptian military positions in the Khan Yunis area of the Gaza Strip. This was followed up with Operation Volcano, a successful raid by paratroopers together with Nahal Brigade and Golani Brigade infantry against Egyptian military positions on the Egyptian-Israeli border. 

It was the largest Israeli military undertaking since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and Operation Egged later that year, a raid that destroyed an Egyptian military post in the Sinai. In December 1955, paratroopers augmented by Nahal and Givati Brigade infantry carried out Operation Olive Leaves, an attack on Syrian gun emplacements along the border which had been shelling Israel, destroying them. In 1956, a force of paratroopers carried out Operation Black Arrow, raiding an Egyptian military base in Gaza and ambushing an Egyptian military relief convoy.

=== Sinai Campaign (1956) ===

The Suez Crisis began with a drop of an entire paratroop battalion over the eastern approaches to the Mitla Pass. The remaining members of the brigade force traveled along a 300 km route, 200 km deep within enemy territory, and linked up with the battalion. This break-through took 28 hours, during which the column swept through the deserted Kuntilla and fought two short but fierce battles against Egyptian forces in Thamad and Nakhl. 

The major paratroop action during the campaign was the battle for Mitla Pass. A paratroop reconnaissance patrol entering the pass found itself trapped by an overwhelming enemy force. The Egyptians enjoyed the topographical advantage, fighting from positions and niches in superior terrain. Outnumbered reinforcements who entered the fray fought desperately to rescue their comrades. After nightfall, the Egyptians were routed, but at the cost of 38 paratroopers dead and over 100 more wounded. Enemy losses were estimated at 260.

The paratroopers jumped once again during the Sinai Campaign—at At-Tur, on the south-eastern shore of the Gulf of Suez. The rest of the brigade proceeded by land to conquer Ras Sudar and link up with their comrades at At-Tur. They then moved southeastward to Sharm El Sheikh at the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula—which they conquered in a classic pincers move in coordination with the 9th brigade which had been moving southwestward. After the war&#x27;s end, the paratroopers concentrated on reorganization and training with emphasis on helicopter operations.

At least 49 Egyptian POWs were executed by the Paratroopers Brigade. The officer Arye Biro ordered the executions, because &quot;We had to move on to Ras Sudar&quot;.

=== Six-Day War (1967) ===

During the Six-Day War, the paratroopers, whose ORBAT had now greatly increased in number, fought on all fronts: the Sinai Peninsula, Judea, Samaria and the Golan Heights. Paratroopers and armor broke through the Rafah positions heavily defended by the Egyptian 7th Division from behind, with the unit suffering heavy losses. Many troops were further killed in action during the evacuation of the wounded. The following day, the unit entered Gaza. Paratroop forces under the command of Danny Matt, who later attained the rank of Major General, made a helicopter landing at the Um Katef artillery positions in the enemy&#x27;s rear line. 

A battalion raced against the 7th IDF Armored Division for the honor of being the first to reach the Suez Canal. Veteran paratrooper Aharon Davidi arrived first at the banks of the Suez. During the Six-Day War, paratroopers reached Sharm El Sheikh and likewise participated in the attack on the Golan. During the recapture of East Jerusalem from Jordanian annexation, considerable care was taken to protect and avoid damaging the holy places of the three religions. For this, the Paratroopers paid a heavy price in dead and wounded.

Sayeret Tzanhanim reconnaissance paratroopers equipped with Jeeps mounting 106mm recoilless rifles waged a campaign of destruction against Egyptian armor formations. During the Battle of Firdan Bridge the paratroopers destroyed dozens of T-55 tanks right off the freighter in Alexandria harbor.

=== War of Attrition (1968–1973) ===
After the Six-Day War, paratroopers participated in pursuit and retaliation operations against Egyptian infiltrators and became embroiled in the War of Attrition on various fronts.
On March 21, 1968, paratroopers and armor raided a headquarters in Karame, Jordan, killing 250 Jordanian soldiers. On December 12, 1968, a heliborne paratroop force raided Beirut Airport and destroyed Lebanese aircraft. The raid came in response to repeated terrorist attacks against Israeli aircraft. On December 23, 1969, paratroopers participated in Operation Rooster 53, airlifting an entire Soviet radar station out of Egypt and transporting it back to Israel.

In January 1970, the brigade spearheaded Operation Rhodes, taking over the Egyptian island of Shadwan. Three Israeli soldiers were killed in the raid which saw the paratroopers remain on the island for 36 hours before departing with 62 Egyptian POWs and a captured Decca radar set.

On 12 May 1972, a hijacked Sabena airliner landed at Israel&#x27;s Lod Airport (now Ben Gurion), after which paratroopers disguised as El-Al flight technicians assaulted the aircraft and rescued the passengers.

On the night of April 9, 1973, during Operation Spring of Youth, a select force of paratroopers headed by Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak landed in different sites in and around Beirut, where according to published foreign reports, they linked up with waiting cars hired by Mossad agents. According to these sources, the soldiers drove through Beirut without arousing suspicion. 

They simultaneously attacked the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine&#x27;s headquarters and the residences of three high-ranking PLO leaders responsible for the Fatah-Black September Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in 1972. Surprise was total, and despite fierce resistance in the headquarters, all teams succeeded in carrying out their missions and were extracted by Israeli Air Force helicopters. Two Israeli soldiers and dozens of PFLP fighters were killed during the fighting.

=== Yom Kippur War (1973) ===

The Yom Kippur War saw the paratroopers fighting in some of the most difficult battles of the war. In the Sinai, paratroopers assigned to armored units rescued the beleaguered &#x27;Budapest&#x27; outpost and destroyed the Egyptian forces. Paratroopers armed with LAW missiles helped contain an Egyptian armored thrust. Paratroopers of Danny Matt&#x27;s brigade crossed the canal, as the spearhead of General Sharon&#x27;s divisions, and established a bridgehead. Others, attempting to break open a route for them, ran up against the massive &quot;Chinese Farm&quot; fortifications. 

For three days, paratroopers and armored corps of General Sharon&#x27;s and General Adan&#x27;s divisions made repeated attempts until they succeeded in breaking through and rescuing their comrades. During the bitter fighting, IDF soldiers ran over open ground to evacuate fallen comrades, and often fell victim to enemy fire in the process. The battles for the &quot;Chinese Farm&quot; prevented the Egyptians from closing in on the bridgehead and eventually succeeded in opening an access point to it. 

On the West Bank of the Suez Canal, paratroopers fought in the city of Suez and advanced upon the city of Ismailia. On the Syrian front, paratroopers captured the peaks of Mt. Hermon in a heliborne operation. Other troops conquered Quneitra in the Golan Heights and Tel Shams and acted as armored infantry in the thrust into Syrian territory. After the Yom Kippur War the paratroopers and other infantry units were placed under the command of a chief Paratroop and Infantry Officer.

During an operation known as Operation Nightgown Sayeret Tzanhanim paratroopers were dropped off at a grassy opening near Kasr al-Hayr on the main Baghdad-Damascus Highway. They headed for a bridge where a brigade of Iraqi T-62 tanks was about to cross en route to the Golan Heights battlefield. The paratroopers attacked the Iraqi armor from the front causing a bottleneck. The Sayeret Tzanhanim paratroopers also attacked the trapped brigade from the rear with machine gun fire and RPGs destroying the brigade. 

The paratroopers then placed explosive charges underneath the bridge full of destroyed Iraqi tanks destroying the bridge. This prevented crucial Iraqi reinforcements from ever reaching the Golan Heights front destroying an Iraqi tank brigade in the process. Operation Nightgown was one of the smallest Israeli special operations ever mounted and also one of the most important. Approximately a dozen paratroopers destroyed the Iraqi tank brigade.

=== Operation Entebbe (1976) ===
On the morning of July 4, 1976, a counter-terrorist hostage-rescue mission headed by Brig. Gen. Dan Shomron succeeded in rescuing 102 passengers and crew of a hijacked Air France aircraft at Entebbe, Uganda. The Paratroopers force, led by Col. Matan Vilnai, was tasked with securing the civilian airport field, clearing and securing the runways, protection and fuelling of the Israeli aircraft. The commandos, transported in four Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport planes, succeeded in landing undetected at Entebbe&#x27;s airport and taking the hijackers and their Ugandan collaborators by surprise. All seven hijackers and dozens of Ugandan soldiers were killed during the mission. 

After the raid, the assault team returned to their aircraft and began loading the hostages where they were shot at by Ugandan soldiers. Israeli forces returned fire with their AK-47s, inflicting casualties on the Ugandans. During this brief but intense firefight, Lt. Col. Yonatan &quot;Yoni&quot; Netanyahu, the older brother of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was shot in the chest and killed during the firefight. He was the only Israeli commando killed in the operation. Three hostages were killed, one was left in Uganda, and approximately 10 were wounded. The 102 rescued hostages were flown to Israel via Nairobi, Kenya, shortly after the raid.

=== Operation Litani (1978) ===
Paratroopers participated in the 1978 invasion of Lebanon, carried out after the infamous Coastal Road massacre, which temporarily purged Southern Lebanon of PLO terrorists. After the IDF withdrawal and the return of sporadic attacks, the Paratroopers participated in preventive raids against bases in Lebanon, raids designed to keep the terrorists off balance and &quot;on the run,&quot; thereby preventing them from carrying out their operations within Israel.

=== 1982 Lebanon War (1982–1985) ===

The paratroopers were an important component of the 1982 Lebanon War. The war in Lebanon proved the IDF&#x27;s fighting ability and tested Paratroop combat doctrine, which had been revised as a result of the lessons of the Yom Kippur War, Operation Litani and other operations.
Paratroopers fought in every sector of the war against Syrian troops and paratroops, both in built-up and mountainous areas. They operated efficiently and in full coordination with other corps, the Navy and the Air Force.

One of the better known operations was the amphibious landing at the mouth of the Awali River, north of Sidon, from where the paratroopers advanced to the outskirts of Beirut through the mountains. In their advance, they engaged Syrian commando forces.

=== Second Intifada ===
The paratroopers played a key role in the Second Intifada. Paratroopers participated in Operation Defensive Shield, taking part in the Battle of Jenin and Battle of Nablus.

=== 2008–2009 Gaza War ===

Paratroopers took part in ground operations in the 2008–2009 Gaza War. The brigade was an important component during the war.

=== 2006 Lebanon War ===
The brigade participated in the 2006 Lebanon War. The paratroopers took part in key engagements. Paratrooper units took part in the Battle of Maroun al-Ras, the first serious battle of the war, which ended in the IDF capturing most of the town. The paratroopers also participated in the Battle of Bint Jbeil, the Battle of Ayta ash-Shab, and Operation Change of Direction 11.

=== 2014 Gaza War ===

During the 2014 Gaza War, the Paratroopers Brigade participated in ground operations, particularly in the Khan Yunis area. The brigade was credited with killing 141 Hamas militants and locating four tunnels during the war. Eight paratroopers were killed in the war, including one in a grenade explosion outside of combat.

=== Israel–Hamas war ===
== Organization and insignia==

The 35th Paratrooper Brigade is part of the IDF&#x27;s 98th Division, also known as the &quot;Fire Formation.&quot; It consists of three regular battalions, each bearing the name of a venomous snake. The 101st, bearing the number of disbanded Unit 101, is the Brigade&#x27;s first battalion. The 202nd is the Brigade&#x27;s second battalion and was numbered to keep it in line with the 101st. The 890th, although the brigade&#x27;s 3rd battalion, was in fact the IDF&#x27;s first paratrooper battalion. The brigade operates a sayeret battalion combining the three specialized units of the brigade.

Soldiers of the Paratroopers Brigade are distinguished by their red beret, paratrooper wings, reddish-brown leather boots and the paratroopers tunic (&quot;Yerkit&quot;), which is slightly different in an appearance from the regular infantry outfits.

<doc id="425617" wikidata="Q6594294" url="?curid=425617" title="List of Plymouth Argyle F.C. managers">
<text>Plymouth Argyle Football Club is an English association football club based in Plymouth, Devon. Founded in 1886 as &quot;Argyle Football Club&quot;, they became a professional club in January 1903, and were elected to the Southern League ahead of the 1903–04 season. The club won the Southern League championship in 1913 and finished as runners-up on two occasions, before being elected to the Football League in 1920, where they compete to this day, as a founder member of the Third Division. Argyle won their first Football League championship, and promotion to the Second Division for the first time, ten years later in 1930. As of May 2011, the club has won five championships in the Football League, gained promotion on eight occasions, and been relegated nine times. Four of those league championships were won in the third tier, which is a divisional record. Argyle have made one appearance at Wembley Stadium, in which they won the 1996 Third Division play-off final. The club has also achieved moderate success in domestic cup competitions; they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1984, and the quarter-finals in 2007. Argyle have also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup twice, in 1965 and 1974.

In that time, the club has had 37 permanent managers. They are listed below in chronological order. Including caretakers, 49 individuals have held responsibility for team selection. The club&#x27;s first manager was Frank Brettell, who was appointed in March 1903. He led the club to the Western League title, their first in the professional game, in 1905 before retiring. The most successful person to manage the club is Bob Jack, who was also Argyle&#x27;s first professional player. He won the Southern League in 1913 and the Third Division South in 1930, having finished as runner-up on six occasions. He then established the club in the second tier of English football and guided them to their joint highest league finish of 4th in the Second Division. He is also the club&#x27;s longest serving manager. Having spent one year as player-manager during the 1905–06 season, Jack returned in 1910 as manager and club secretary. He retired in 1938 after 29 years of service.

Four people have managed the club in two separate terms, of whom the most recent was Paul Sturrock. The first was Bob Jack in 1910 and it wasn&#x27;t equalled until 1970 when Ellis Stuttard returned for a second two-year spell. Malcolm Allison was the third in 1978, having previously joined the club in 1964, and Sturrock made it four in November 2007, returning to Home Park three years after departing to manage in the Premier League. 12 of the club&#x27;s managers have also played for Argyle competitively, not including Ian Holloway who came out of retirement in October 2006 to play for the club&#x27;s reserve team. Outside forward Bob Jack was the first in 1905 and he has been succeeded by full back Jimmy Rae and centre forward Jack Rowley, both of whom also won league titles with the club, among others. 13 other people have been in charge as a caretaker, including former players Steve McCall and Kevin Summerfield (twice). Five managers have won major league championships with the club, of whom both Jack and Sturrock were successful twice. Three others have achieved promotion to a higher division.

<text>John Edward Patrick Gallagher (16 July 1916 – 16 December 1998) was a Canadian oilman who from 1950 to 1983 was the head of Dome Petroleum. Gallagher is best remembered for leading extensive explorations in the Beaufort Sea in the late 1970s.

==Biography==

=== Early years and university ===

Jack Gallagher was born in Winnipeg on 16 July 1916. In 1933 he graduated from St. John&#x27;s High School. In the fall of 1933 Gallagher entered the University of Manitoba, studying engineering. Fearful about his prospects of getting a job in construction during the Great Depression, he later transferred to studying geology. During the summer of 1936, Gallagher worked for the Geological Survey of Canada in northern Manitoba. This first encounter with the north would inspire his return there later in his career.

Upon graduating in 1937, Gallagher hitched a ride to Washington state and got a job selling Caterpillar tractors. After a year, Gallagher moved to California, where he got a job as a scout with the Shell Oil Company. Despite not having experience in oil and gas, the company was interested in his field experience in the North. In January 1939 Shell sent Gallagher to Egypt. When the Second World War began in September of that year, Shell ceased its Egyptian operations and moved to the Dutch East Indies. Instead of transferring to the new location, Gallagher left Shell and began to work for the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, who remained in the region. At one point, Gallagher worked for the British Eighth Army searching for water wells. During his time in the east Gallagher also lectured on geology at the Cairo University.

In the early 1940s Standard transferred Gallagher to South America, where he spent time in Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama. His South American stay led to many interesting experiences, including being granted a meeting with president Jorge Ubico to ask permission to search for oil in the north of the country. On another occasion, while in the passenger seat of a truck on a trip through the Andes, Gallagher&#x27;s driver fainted from the altitude. Gallagher managed to steer the truck into a rock wall, preventing it from going off the cliff. Suffering from back pain, it was ten days before he was able to see a doctor, who concluded he was only experiencing muscle spasms. A year later in New York City, an X-Ray revealed three fractured vertebrae. Gallagher would have back pain the rest of his life. The pressure from giving a hand shake would often cause him pain, and to help the problem he would often use a two-hand clasp when meeting people.

In 1948 Standard sent Gallagher to Harvard University for a year to study management. Upon finishing at Harvard, Standard informed Gallagher that they wanted him to work as their head geologist in the Far East. Wanting to return to Canada, Gallagher instead took a job with Standard&#x27;s Canadian subsidiary, Imperial Oil, in Calgary.

=== Dome Petroleum ===

In 1950 Gallagher was approached by Jim McCrea of Dome Mines, a Toronto company that had been in existence since 1910. Wanting to expand their operations to include oil, the company formed Dome Exploration (Western), wanting Gallagher to head the new operation. Throughout the 1950s Dome remained a relatively small company. Gallagher worked primarily on his own and had an office in the Alberta Block at 805 1st Street South West with his secretary Ethel Cairns. In 1951 Dome became public, selling a half-million shares, and in 1958 it changed its name to Dome Petroleum and moved into the new Dome Building at 706 8th Avenue South West. Having become fascinated with the Canadian North during the summer of 1936, Gallagher remained interested in the potential for northern oil and gas exploration. In 1959 Gallagher first filed for land position in the north, and in September 1961 Dome became the first company to drill in the Canadian Arctic. In 1974 Gallagher was contacted by then Minister of Northern Affairs, Jean Chrétien, to ask if Dome would be interested in exploration in the Beaufort Sea. Dome&#x27;s first season of exploration in the Beaufort was in 1976. By the early 1980s, Dome had built a fleet of around 40 vessels. Although Dome invested a great deal of money in Arctic exploration, it never made a major discovery.

By the early 1980s Gallagher, although still Chief Executive, had relinquished some power to younger members of the company. In May 1981 Dome set out to acquire the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Oil and Gas Company, which at the time was controlled by the American company Conoco. Gallagher had opposed this move, although he ultimately allowed it to take place. That June, Dome took a U.S.$1.68 billion loan from the Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. In the fall Toronto-Dominion requested that part of the loan be repaid, at which time it was revealed that Dome did not have the money. This revelation threw the Canadian banking system into a state of chaos for the next year before a rescue package for Dome was developed in the fall of 1982. On 8 April 1983, Gallagher stepped down as the head of Dome. In his 33 years of running the company, he had turned a one-man operation into the third-largest private company in Canada, at the time.

=== Personal life ===

Gallagher was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1983. After leaving Dome, he dedicated his time largely to political causes, helping to found the Reform Party of Canada. Gallagher was known for his affable personality and famous smile, being given the nickname &quot;Smilin&#x27; Jack.&quot; In August 1949 he married Kathleen Marjorie Stewart (1919-2011), who was originally from Red Deer, Alberta. They, along with their three sons, lived in a house located at 4315 Britannia Drive in Calgary&#x27;s mid-century Britannia neighbourhood. He died from cancer at a hospice in Calgary on December 16, 1998. The house remains largely original today and has been featured in local architectural tours. Gallagher&#x27;s personal papers are held at the Glenbow Museum as the &quot;Jack Gallagher fonds&quot;.

<text>A Zippo lighter is a reusable metal lighter produced by Zippo Manufacturing Company of Bradford, Pennsylvania, United States. Thousands of different styles and designs have been made since their introduction in 1933, including military versions for specific regiments. Zippo lighters have been sold worldwide and described as &quot;a legendary and distinct symbol of America.&quot; In 2012, the company produced the 500-millionth unit. Since the company&#x27;s inception in 1932, Zippo lighters have been primarily manufactured in the United States, although the company operated in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada from 1949 until 2002.

== Company history ==
American inventor George G. Blaisdell founded Zippo Manufacturing Company in 1932 and produced the first Zippo lighter in early 1933, being inspired by an Austrian cigarette lighter of similar design made by IMCO. It got its name because Blaisdell liked the sound of the word &quot;zipper,&quot; and &quot;zippo&quot; sounded more modern. On March 3, 1936, the U.S. Patent Office granted a patent for the Zippo lighter.

Zippo lighters became popular in the United States military, especially during World War II—when, as the company&#x27;s web site says, Zippo &quot;ceased production of lighters for consumer markets and dedicated all manufacturing to the US military&quot;. The U.S. war correspondent Ernie Pyle wrote a letter to the Zippo founder commenting that &quot;Zippo is probably the most important element on the front.&quot; Period Zippos were made of brass, but Zippo used a black crackle finished steel during the war years because of metal shortages. While the Zippo Manufacturing Company never had an official contract with the military, individual armed forces personnel requested that base exchange (BX) and post exchange (PX) stores carry this sought-after lighter. While it had previously been common to have Zippos with authorized badges, unit emblems, and division insignias, it became popular among the American soldiers of the Vietnam War to get their Zippos engraved with personal mottos. These lighters are now sought-after collector&#x27;s items and popular souvenirs for visitors to Vietnam.

After World War II, the Zippo lighter became increasingly used in advertising by companies large and small through the 1960s. Much of the early Zippo lighter advertising are works of art painted by hand, and as technology has evolved, so has the design and finish of the Zippo lighter. The basic mechanism of the Zippo lighter has remained unchanged, but they developed into a popular fashion accessory, with a huge variety of artistic designs produced.

In 2002, Zippo expanded its product line to include a variety of utility-style multi-purpose lighters, known as Zippo MPLs. This was followed in 2005 with the Outdoor Utility Lighter, known as the OUL. These lighters are fueled with butane. In August 2007, Zippo released a new butane lighter called the Zippo BLU. It discontinued the line January 1, 2016.

A museum called &quot;Zippo/Case visitors center&quot; is located in Bradford, Pennsylvania, at 1932 Zippo Drive. This building contains rare and custom made Zippo lighters, and also sells the entire Zippo line. The museum was featured on the NPR program &quot;Weekend Edition&quot; on Sunday, January 25, 2009. The museum also contains an enormous collection of Case knives. Since the Zippo company&#x27;s 60th anniversary in 1992, annual editions have been produced for Zippo collectors.

In 2009, Zippo announced plans to purchase Ronson Consumer Products Corporation, a long-time competitor in the lighter market. On February 3, 2010, the deal was finalized.

In March 2011, due to significant decrease of sales from 18 million lighters a year in the mid-1990s to about 12 million lighters a year recently, combined with increasing pressure on people not to smoke, Zippo Manufacturing Co. tried offering a wider variety of products using the Zippo name, such as watches, leisure clothing and eau de cologne. This strategy is similar to the success Victorinox Swiss Army Brands Inc. has had selling watches, luggage, clothing, and fragrance.

On June 5, 2012, the company manufactured its 500,000,000th lighter and celebrated its 80th anniversary. In 2018, Zippo announced the sound trademark of its windproof lighter, making the Zippo lighter&#x27;s click officially one of the most recognised sounds in the world.

On June 3, 2020, the company manufactured its 600,000,000th lighter.

== Usage ==
Zippo lighters, which have gained popularity as “windproof” lighters, are able to stay lit in harsh weather, due to the design of the windscreen and adequate rate of fuel delivery.

A consequence of the windproofing is that it is hard to extinguish a Zippo by blowing out the flame. However, if the flame is blown from the top down, it will be easily extinguished. The proper way to extinguish the lighter is to close the top half, which starves the flame of oxygen, but unlike other lighters, this does not cut off the fuel supply. One of the recognizable features of Zippo is the fact that it burns with a wick. Opening the top lid produces an easily recognizable &quot;clink&quot; sound for which Zippo lighters are known, and a different but similarly recognizable &quot;clunk&quot; when the lighter is closed. This noise is produced by the spring-loaded toggling cam, a small lever that keeps the lid closed or opened securely. 

Unlike disposable lighters, newly purchased Zippo lighters do not contain fuel. Instructions for safely fueling the Zippo are included in its packaging. Zippo also sell a name-brand lighter fluid.

=== Vietnam War ===

Morley Safer, in his August 5, 1965 &quot;CBS News&quot; report of the Cam Ne incident and Private First Class Reginald &quot;Malik&quot; Edwards, the rifleman with the 9th Regiment, US Marine Corps Danang (June 1965 – March 1966) whose profile comprises chapter one of Wallace Terry&#x27;s book, &quot;Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans&quot; (1984), describe the use of Zippo lighters in search and destroy missions during the Vietnam War. Edwards stated: &quot;when you say level a village, you don&#x27;t use torches. It&#x27;s not like in the 1800s. You used a Zippo. Now you would use a Bic. That&#x27;s just the way we did it. You went in there with your Zippos. Everybody. That&#x27;s why people bought Zippos. Everybody had a Zippo. It was for burnin&#x27; shit down.&quot;

&quot;Zippo squad&quot; became a phrase of American military jargon for being assigned to burn a village. The M132 armored flamethrower was referred to as a &quot;Zippo&quot;.

== Price ==
As of March 2022, Zippos carry a suggested retail price between US$17.95 and US$25,000 (for the Armor 18k solid gold model). In 2001, according to the fall 2003 issue of &quot;IUP Magazine&quot;, a 1933 model was purchased for $18,000 at a swap meet in Tokyo, and in 2002 the company bought one valued at $12,000 for its own collection. During the 75th anniversary celebrations in 2007, Zippo sold a near mint 1933 model for $37,000.

All Zippo windproof lighters carry an unlimited lifetime guarantee, promoted using the trademarked phrase &quot;It works or we fix it free.&quot; The corporate web site claims: &quot;in almost 75 years, no one has ever spent a cent on the mechanical repair of a Zippo lighter regardless of the lighter&#x27;s age or condition.&quot;

== Date codes ==

In mid-1955, Zippo started year coding its lighters by the use of dots. From 1966 until 1973, the year code was denoted by combinations of vertical lines. From 1974 until 1981 the coding comprised combinations of forward slashes. In 1979, the company inadvertently introduced an error into fabrication, with some lighters reading / on the left and // on the right instead of // on the left and / on the right, but corrected the problem within the year. From 1982 until June 1986 the coding was by backslash.

After July 1986, Zippo began including a date code on all lighters showing the month and year of production. On the left of the underside was stamped a letter A–L, denoting the month (A = January, B = February, C = March, etc.). On the right was a Roman numeral which denoted the year, beginning with II in 1986. However, in 2001, Zippo altered this system, changing the Roman numerals to Arabic numerals. Thus a Zippo made in August 2004 was stamped H 04.

== Construction ==
The cases of Zippo lighters are typically made of brass and are rectangular with a hinged top. On most models, the top of the case is slightly convex.

Inside the case are the works of the lighter. The insert contains the spring-toggle lever that keeps the top closed, the wick, windscreen chimney, flintwheel, and flint, all of which are mounted on an open-bottom metal box that is slightly smaller than the bottom of the outer case, and into which it slips snugly.

The hollow part of the interior box encloses five rayon balls (similar to cotton balls) which are in contact with the wick. The bottom of this is covered by a piece of felt approximately 1/4 of an inch thick. Printed on the bottom of the felt (in modern Zippos, not on older models prior to late 1992) are the words, &quot;LIFT TO FILL,&quot; to indicate one must lift the felt away from the &quot;cotton&quot; in order to refuel it. The fuel, light petroleum distillate or synthetic isoparaffinic hydrocarbon (commonly referred to as lighter fluid or naphtha), is poured into the rayon balls (sometimes called the &quot;cotton,&quot; or the &quot;batting&quot;), which absorbs it. It also contains a tube that holds a short, cylindrical flint. The tube has an interior spring and exterior cap-screw that keeps the flint in constant contact with the exterior flint-wheel. Spinning this rough-surfaced wheel against flint results in a spark that ignites the fluid in the wick.

All parts of the lighter are replaceable. The Zippo lighter requires 108 manufacturing operations.

== Zippo BLU and Zippo BLU 2 ==
Zippo released the Zippo BLU in 2007 (although there are many 2005 pre-release models). These are butane torch lighters, which Zippo has gone to great lengths to make sure are still &quot;identifiable as a Zippo&quot;. Specifically, the lid and cam were &quot;tuned&quot; so that the lighter still makes the distinctive &quot;Zippo click&quot;, and also it is one of the few butane torch lighters to use a flint and striker wheel. The company also marketed the BLU2, which features a squarer frame and eliminates the fuel gauge on the side of the original Zippo BLU.

On January 1, 2016, Zippo discontinued production of the BLU line of lighters and sold the BLU trademark to Lorillard, but continued to service all Zippo BLU lighters.

== Zippo subsidiaries ==
In addition to its 2010 purchase of the Ronson brand in the US and Canada, Zippo also owns W. R. Case &amp; Sons Cutlery Co. of Bradford, Pennsylvania, Zippo UK, Ltd. of London, England, and Zippo Fashion Italia of Vicenza, Italy.

<doc id="425635" wikidata="Q2339517" url="?curid=425635" title="List of World Heavyweight Champions (WWE, 2002–2013)">
<text>The World Heavyweight Championship was a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship in WWE. It was established by WWE in 2002 after WWE bought out World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), and split its roster into two brands, Raw and SmackDown!, in a brand extension.
WWE&#x27;s original world title, the WWE Championship, with which the WCW World Heavyweight Championship had been unified in 2001, was designated to the SmackDown! brand; as a result the World Heavyweight Championship was established for the Raw brand. Although both titles used the &quot;Big Gold&quot; belt design, the World Heavyweight Championship was not a continuation of the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, but rather its indirect successor. For a list of champions who have held those titles, see the list of WCW World Heavyweight Champions and list of NWA World Heavyweight Champions respectively.

At the pay-per-view on December 15, 2013, when WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena, the World Heavyweight Championship was unified with the WWE Championship, resulting in the retiring of the former, and the renaming of the latter to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.

The championship was contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants execute scripted finishes. The first champion was Triple H, who was awarded the title on September 2, 2002, by Eric Bischoff, then-General Manager of Raw, and he also holds the record for longest combined reign at 616 days. Overall, there have been 25 different official champions, with Edge having the most reigns at seven. The longest single reign was held by Batista, lasting 282 days. The final holder was Randy Orton, who was also the youngest champion at the age of 24 when he first won the championship. The Undertaker was the oldest champion when he won the title for the third time at the age of 44 years.

<doc id="425636" wikidata="Q836563" url="?curid=425636" title="Christmas Bird Count">
<text>The Christmas Bird Count (CBC) is a census of birds in the Western Hemisphere, performed annually in the early Northern-hemisphere winter by volunteer birdwatchers and administered by the National Audubon Society. The purpose is to provide population data for use in science, especially conservation biology, though many people participate for recreation. The CBC is the longest-running citizen science survey in the world.

==History==

In the 19th century, many North Americans participated in the tradition of Christmas &quot;side hunts&quot;, in which they competed at how many birds they could kill. In December 1900, the U.S. ornithologist Frank Chapman, founder of &quot;Bird-Lore&quot; (which became &quot;Audubon&quot; magazine), proposed counting birds on Christmas instead of killing them.

On Christmas Day of that year, 27 observers took part in the first count in 25 places in the United States and Canada. The participants counted 18,500 birds in 90 species. Since then the counts have been held every winter, usually with increasing numbers of observers. The 101st count, in the winter of 2000–2001, involved 52,471 people in 1,823 places in 17 countries (but mostly in the U.S. and Canada). During the 113th count (winter 2012–2013), 71,531 people participated in 2,369 locations. The National Audubon Society now partners with Bird Studies Canada, the Gulf Coast Bird Observatory of Texas (responsible for CBCs in Mexico), and the Red Nacional de Observadores de Aves (RNOA, National Network of Bird Observers) and the Instituto Alexander von Humboldt of Colombia.

The greatest number of bird species ever reported by any U.S. location in a single count is 250, observed on December 19, 2005, in the Matagorda County-Mad Island Marsh count circle around Matagorda and Palacios, Texas. The greatest number of bird species ever reported by a CBC circle in the world is 531, observed on December 21, 2013, in the Cosanga-Narupa count (previously known as the Yanayacu count) on the eastern slope of the Andes in Ecuador.

==Methods==
Each individual count is performed in a &quot;count circle&quot; with a diameter of . At least ten volunteers, including a compiler to manage things, count in each circle. They break up into small parties and follow assigned routes, which change little from year to year, counting every bird they see. In most count circles, some people also watch feeders instead of following routes.

Counts can be held on any day from December 14 to January 5 inclusive.

The results, providing data on winter ranges of birds, are complementary to those of the Breeding Bird Surveys.

<text>The Penny Blue is frequently mistaken for a postage stamp of Britain. It is from a series of proof impressions which were made at the time Rowland Hill was looking at the new colours which were to be used for the stamps which were to replace the Penny Black and the original 1840 issue of the Two pence Blue.

The decision to change the black stamp to red had already been made, and at the same time the colour of the ink used for the cancellations was to be changed from red to black. Although it had been decided that the two pence value would remain in blue, this was going to be printed using a different ink from that used on the original. (Thus when the stamp was printed it had the addition of white lines added above and below the inscription so that the new printings could be distinguished at a glance).

At the beginning of December 1840, Rowland Hill wished to see what the stamps would look like in the new colours and requested, (in sheet form), examples in the red brown which was to be used for the new one penny stamp as well as two sheets in blue as the choice of colour had not yet been made. The two blues used for the printing were full deep blue and prussian blue.

For the printing of these three sheets, plate 8 constructed for the production of the penny blacks was used.

Rowland Hill chose the full deep blue colour for the two pence stamp.

Examples printed in the red-brown shade, if they made it onto postage, would be indistinguishable from later printings which were made in this colour as part of the general issue in 1841.

Die, plate and paper proofs have been a common step in the process of stamp pre-production since the first stamps. These are never usable as postage, and as a result do not constitute being a &quot;postage stamp&quot;, rather it is a representation of it, frequently to test the type or colour of ink, how it will react on certain papers, as well as validating the image itself. This was more critical in the early days of stamp production where metal (and sometimes stone or even wooden plates) were used to make the stamp impression, and some inks caused undue wear on the plates.

<doc id="425644" wikidata="Q3910469" url="?curid=425644" title="Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement">
<text>The [[Bram Stoker Award]] for Lifetime Achievement annually recognizes one to three living artists for &quot;superior achievement in an entire career&quot; which has &quot;substantially influenced the horror genre&quot;. It is conferred by the Horror Writers Association, and most winners have been horror fiction writers, but other creative occupations are eligible.

The Bram Stoker Awards, including the lifetime honor in particular, were established along with the Association itself in 1987. They are presented in the year following the award year, which is the publication year for most of the awards program.

The winners are selected by the annual Lifetime Achievement Award Committee, which comprises five HWA members appointed by the President. Unlike the literary awards, which are determined by vote of all members, there are no official runners-up.

Elizabeth Massie, Nuzo Onoh, and John Saul are the most recent winners, all three receiving the award on June 17, 2023.

==Recipients==

The annual committee may bestow up to 
fu awards, by unanimous agreement, and it need not bestow any. In fact, though, there has been at least a single winner every year, and there were three winners for 1987, and more recently 2020 and 2021. There were 40 Lifetime Achievement Awards in the first 25 years, through the 2011/2012 cycle.


Multiple awards

Six of the Stoker Award winners have also been named SFWA Grand Masters by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America: Leiber, Simak, Bradbury, Ellison, Jack Williamson, and Moorcock.

<text>This list of photographic equipment makers lists companies that manufacture (or license manufacture from other companies) equipment for photography.

== Camera and lens manufacturers ==
Note that producers whose only presence in the photo industry at any time has been the manufacture of digital cameras (Logitech, for example, which has made Webcams) are listed separately on the List of digital camera brands.

There is not a very clear distinguishing line between camera producers and lens producers; many companies do both, or have done both at one time or another. Some camera manufacturers sell lenses made by others as their own, in an OEM arrangement. Some camera makers design lenses but outsource manufacture. Some lens makers have cameras made to sell under their own brand name. A few companies are only in the lens business. Some camera companies make no lenses, but usually at least sell a lens from some lens maker with their cameras as part of a package.

Note that many optical instruments such as microscopes, telescopes, spotting scopes and so forth can be used as photographic lenses; manufacturers of these types of equipment are not included here (unless they also make more conventional photo gear).

<text>The Soil Association is a British registered charity focused on the effect of agriculture on the environment. It was established in 1946. Their activities include campaigning for local purchasing, public education on nutrition and certification of organic foods, and against intensive farming.

== History ==

===The Haughley experiment===
Lady Eve Balfour (niece of former British Prime Minister Arthur Balfour) was one of the first women to study agriculture in a British university. She and her sister Mary bought New Bells Farm at Haughley Green in Suffolk and started the Haughley Experiment, trialling different types of farming techniques to compare chemical and organic farming.

The Haughley experiment was the first formal, side-by-side farm trial to compare organic and chemical-based farming. It was based on an idea that farmers were over-reliant on fertilizers, that livestock, crops and the soil should be treated as a whole system and that &quot;natural&quot; farming produced food which was in some way more wholesome than food produced with more intensive methods. Lady Balfour believed that humanity&#x27;s future and human health were dependent on how the soil was treated, and ran the experiment to generate scientific data that would support these beliefs. 

Lady Balfour then published results in 1943 in her book &quot;The Living Soil&quot;. Reprinted numerous times, it became a founding text of the emerging organic food and farming movement and of the Soil Association. 

===Founders&#x27; meeting===

Lady Eve Balfour, Friend Sykes and George Scott Williamson organized a founders&#x27; meeting for the Soil Association on 12 June 1945 and about a hundred people attended. The association was formally registered on 3 May 1946, and in the next decade grew to over 4,000 members.

It was also founded in part due to concerns over intensive agriculture and in particular the use of herbicides. British Union of Fascists member Jorian Jenks, who was closely associated with Oswald Mosley, was one of the founders. Following Jenks&#x27; death in 1963, the association tilted towards the left of the political spectrum, especially under the new president, Barry Commoner. 

The association was one of the five bodies which in Versailles in 1972 formed the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements to act as the umbrella organisation to advocate for organic farming.

==Campaigns==
Former campaigns by the association include the following areas: 
*intensive pesticide use
*neonicotinoid pesticides
*deregulation of gene editing
*megafarming
*agroecology
*welfare of farm animals
*ultra-processed foods
*healthy school meals 
*labelling of beauty products

The association takes part in industry and trade events, as well as offering training days. 

==Twenty-first century==
Campaigner Alastair Sawday was vice-chairman of the association between 2005 and 2007.

As of 2023, Wiltshire farmer Helen Browning is the chief executive; broadcaster Monty Don was president from 2008 to 2016. Honorary vice-presidents include Jonathan Dimbleby, George McRobie, and Charlotte Mitchell. King Charles III is a royal patron.

== Certification ==

The association certifies organic products in farming, food processing, restaurants and catering, fisheries, textiles and leather, and health and beauty products. Its subsidiary Soil Association Certification Ltd is approved by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It sets standards for packaging, animal welfare, wildlife conservation, residues and additives. Since 2008 its standards have excluded nanomaterials.

<doc id="425662" wikidata="Q741935" url="?curid=425662" title="Ghawar Field">
<text>Ghawar (Arabic: الغوار) is an oil field located in Al-Ahsa Governorate, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. Measuring (some ), it is by far the largest conventional oil field in the world, and accounts for roughly a third of the cumulative oil production of Saudi Arabia as of 2018.

Ghawar is entirely owned and operated by Saudi Aramco, the state-run Saudi oil company. In April 2019, the company first published its profit figures since its nationalization nearly 40 years ago in the context of issuing a bond to international markets. The bond prospectus revealed that Ghawar is able to pump a maximum of per day—well below the more than per day that had become conventional wisdom in the market.

== Geology ==
Ghawar occupies an anticline above a basement fault block dating to Carboniferous time, about 320million years ago; Cretaceous tectonic activity, as the northeast margin of Africa began to impinge on southwest Asia, enhanced the structure. Reservoir rocks are Jurassic Arab-D limestones with exceptional porosity (as much as 35 % of the rock in places), which is about thick and occurs beneath the surface. Source rock is the Jurassic Hanifa formation, a marine shelf deposit of mud and lime with as much as 5 % organic material, it is estimated that 1 % to 7 % is considered good oil source rock. The seal is an evaporitic package of rocks including impermeable anhydrite.

== History ==
In the early 1940s, Max Steineke, Thomas Barger and Ernie Berg noted a bend in the Wadi Al-Sahbah dry riverbed. Measurements confirmed that the area had undergone geologic uplift, an indication that an oil reservoir may be trapped underneath. Oil was indeed found, in what turned out to be the southern reaches of Ghawar.

Historically, Ghawar has been subdivided into five production areas, from north to south: &#x27;Ain Dar and Shedgum, &#x27;Uthmaniyah, Hawiyah and Haradh. The major oasis of Al-Ahsa and the city of Al-Hofuf are located on Ghawar&#x27;s east flank, corresponding to the &#x27;Uthmaniyah production area. Ghawar was discovered in 1948 and put on stream in 1951. Some sources claim that Ghawar peaked in 2005, though this is denied by the field operators.

Saudi Aramco reported in mid-2008 that Ghawar had produced 48% of its proven reserves.

== Extraction of crude oil ==
Approximately 60–65% of all Saudi oil produced between 1948 and 2000, came from Ghawar. Cumulative extraction of petroleum through early 2010, has exceeded . In 2009, it was estimated that Ghawar produced about of oil a day (6.25% of global production), a figure which was later shown to be substantially overestimated.

As of 31 December 2018, total reserves of of oil equivalent including barrels of liquid reserves have been confirmed by Saudi Aramco. Average daily extraction was per day.

Ghawar also produces approximately of natural gas per day.

The operators stimulate production by waterflooding, using seawater at a rate said to be around per day . Water flooding is said to have begun in 1965. The water cut was about 32% in 2003, and ranged from about 27% to 38% from 1993 to 2003. By 2006, North Uthmaniyah&#x27;s water cut was about 46%.

== Energy content ==
Taking the production figure per year and the conventional energy density of crude oil (per the definition of the ton of oil equivalent) of 41.868 MJ/kg (5275.3 Wh/lb)) the total thermal energy equivalent produced yearly by the oil field is roughly 7.955 EJ or 2.21 PWh of thermal energy equivalent.

For comparison,
*North Antelope Rochelle Mine, the largest coal mine in the world, produced 85.3 Mt of coal in 2019 (down from over 100 Mt in 2015) at 1.746 EJ or 485 TWh of thermal energy equivalent.

*McArthur River uranium mine, the largest uranium mine in the world, produced 7.3 Mt (16.1 Mio lb) of yellowcake in fiscal 2017, equivalent to roughly 6.2 kt of uranium metal or 4.46 EJ (1240 TWh) of thermal energy at a burnup of 200 MWh/kg achievable in CANDU-type reactors, but much less in more widespread reactor designs.

*The largest solar farm in the world, Bhadla solar park in India, covering 57 km2 and boasting a nameplate capacity of 2255 MW would produce 17.778 PJ or 4938 GWh of electricity per year.

*The largest wind farm as of 2021, Gansu Wind Farm in China has a nameplate capacity approaching 8 GW with plans to ramp up to 20 GW. A 20 GW power plant at 100 % capacity factor could deliver of electric output per year. However, once again due to the weather-dependency and intermittency of wind power, capacity factors for onshore wind installations like Gansu are typically much lower, ranging at 15-35% depending on local factors. 250000 standard tons of coal will be replaced per year at full deployment, which is equivalent to 7327 TJ (2035 GWh).

The Ghawar oil field is thus the largest single supplier of primary energy on Earth.

== Reserves ==
In April 2010, Saad al-Tureiki, Vice-President for Operations at Aramco, stated, in a news conference reported in Saudi media, that over have been produced from the field since 1951. Tureiki further stated that the total reserves of the field had originally exceeded .

The International Energy Agency in its 2008 World Energy Outlook stated that the oil production from Ghawar reached 66 Bbo in 2007, and that the remaining reserves are 74 Bbo.

Matthew Simmons, in his 2005 book &quot;Twilight in the Desert&quot;, suggested that production from the Ghawar field and Saudi Arabia may soon peak.

When appraised in the 1970s, the field was assessed to have of original oil in place (OOIP), with about recoverable (1975 Aramco estimate quoted by Matt Simmons). The second figure, at least, was understated since that production figure has already been exceeded.

<doc id="425671" wikidata="Q922724" url="?curid=425671" title="Socialist Party of Ukraine">
<text>The Socialist Party of Ukraine (, abbreviated SPU) was a social democratic and democratic socialist political party in Ukraine. It was one of the oldest parties in Ukraine and was created by former members of the Soviet-era Communist Party of Ukraine in late 1991, when the Communist Party was banned.

Involved in a number of popular protest movements in the early 2000s, it was third and fourth largest party in parliament during its time in parliament. The party entered government for the first time as part of a coalition with Our Ukraine and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc in 2005, but its decision to form a government with the opposing Party of Regions and the re-founded Communist Party of Ukraine in 2006 caused significant damage to the party&#x27;s credibility. Despite historically strong support in the central regions of Ukraine, it failed to pass the 3% threshold to enter parliament in the 2007 parliamentary elections. From then onwards, the party&#x27;s electoral results became increasingly marginal and it failed to win any seats in subsequent elections.

The party&#x27;s founder, Oleksandr Moroz, was elected Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&#x27;s parliament, in 1994 and played a key role in the adoption of the Constitution of Ukraine. He led the party for more than 20 years until his resignation in 2012, after which the party became embroiled in a long-lasting leadership struggle. In 2017, the party was taken over by a former member of the far-right Right Sector, Illia Kyva. It participated in the 2019 presidential and parliamentary elections without any success.

The party was suspended in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and banned by a court decision on 15 June 2022.

== History ==
=== Creation ===

Following Ukraine&#x27;s independence on 24 August 1991, Leonid Kravchuk as the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine&#x27;s parliament) signed several important documents among which was the disbandment (26 August) and later the prohibition (30 August) of communist parties. This led to the collapse of the communist-majority faction, informally known as the &quot;group of 239&quot;, led by Oleksandr Moroz. Four days after the prohibition of communist parties, Moroz called on communists to unite in a new left-wing party. The founding congress of the party was held in Kyiv on 26 October 1991 and Moroz was elected leader. The party&#x27;s programme, approved at a second congress held in November 1992, emphasised the party&#x27;s status as the successor to the Communist Party of Ukraine and proclaimed the party&#x27;s goal of achieving socialism through &quot;people&#x27;s democracy&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
In 1993, the party experienced a mass exodus of members when the Communist Party of Ukraine (KPU), which claimed to be the direct successor of the Soviet-era Communist Party, was formed in June. The situation was so severe that several of the party&#x27;s regional organisations had ceased to exist and the continued existence of the party was put into question at an extraordinary congress, but those who supported merging into the Communist Party remained in the minority. In total, some 40,000 members, or half the party&#x27;s membership, left for the refounded KPU.

In December 1993, the party entered the opposition to the administration of prime minister Leonid Kuchma and president Leonid Kravchuk, but by this point Kuchma had already resigned as prime minister.

In March 1994, the party participated in the country&#x27;s first parliamentary election since independence and won 14 seats, becoming the fourth-largest party in the Verkhovna Rada behind the Communist Party, People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine (Rukh), and the Peasant Party of Ukraine (SelPU). By mid-1994, the party controlled a parliamentary faction of 25 deputies, as deputies from other parties, especially those from the Peasant Party of Ukraine (SelPU) opted to sit with the Socialists, and Moroz was elected Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (speaker of parliament) with the support of Communist deputies.

In the 1994 presidential election held in June, Moroz was the sole left-wing candidate and received the support of both the Communist Party, and the Peasant Party, but garnered just 13.3% of the vote and failed to advance past the first round of voting. Moroz himself did not not endorse either Kravchuk or Kuchma in the second round, and the party&#x27;s central leadership left the decision of who to endorse for the presidency to individual branches. Most followed the Communist Party in supporting Kuchma, the eventual winner. During the election, Moroz campaigned for transforming Ukraine into a parliamentary republic, prohibiting the sale of land, and a &quot;state-regulated market&quot;.

Over the course of Moroz&#x27;s term as chairman, relations between himself and Kuchma became increasingly strained. The duo notably clashed on the issue of constitutional reform; Kuchma favoured increasing the power of the presidency and transforming Ukraine into a unitary state, while Moroz and the left-wing in parliament sought to empower parliament and advocated decentralisation. The adoption of a temporary, in June 1995 did not ease tensions, and Moroz repeatedly rebuffed efforts to pass &quot;pro-presidential&quot; drafts of a basic law. The semi-presidential republican constitution, a compromise, was eventually adopted by parliament with the necessary two-thirds majority in June 1996. 

In February 1996, Nataliya Vitrenko was expelled from the party over disputes with Moroz and the rest of the leadership concerning the party&#x27;s political programme which she believed deviated from socialist ideals. She and Volodymyr Marchenko, who was also expelled from the party, founded the Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine a month later in April 1996.

In the run up to the 1998 parliamentary election, attempts to form a coalition with the Communist Party had failed and the party instead contested alongside the Peasant Party of Ukraine in an electoral alliance called For Truth, For the People, For Ukraine (&quot;Za pravdu, za narod, za Ukrainu&quot;), later known as Left Center. The bloc managed to secure 8.55% of the votes, 29 proportional seats, and 5 constituencies out of 450 in the Verkhovna Rada. The bloc gained the position of Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (speaker of parliament) when Peasant Party chairman Oleksandr Tkachenko was elected to the post. The Peasant Party later started its own parliamentary faction with 15 deputies in the autumn of 1998 but disbanded in 2000 as many of the Peasant Party&#x27;s deputies followed their faction leader into the newly formed pro-presidential Solidarity led by Petro Poroshenko.

For the 1999 Ukrainian presidential election, Moroz was a member of the &quot;Kaniv Four&quot;, an alliance of presidential hopefuls that included former Prime Minister of Ukraine Yevhen Marchuk, Mayor of Cherkasy Volodymyr Oliynyk, and the Peasant Party&#x27;s Oleksandr Tkachenko. The four agreed to support Marchuk as the joint candidate after protracted negotiations, but the alliance fell apart when Moroz abruptly announced his decision to stand for election.

Despite being considered the most likely candidate to defeat Kuchma, Moroz failed to advance past the first round of voting, having come third with only 11.29% of the vote. Plagued by allegations of electoral fraud, Kuchma also faced accusations of having funded the Progressive Socialist Party in order split the left-wing vote.

=== 2000s ===
During the 2000s, the party was member to a series of protests and conflicts in opposition to the presidency of Kuchma and pro-Kuchma parties. It opposed the 2000 Ukrainian constitutional referendum called by Kuchma with the intention of expanding the powers of the presidency and decreasing that of the Ukrainian parliament. While the amendments were approved by voters, their implementation was obstructed when Kuchma was implicated in the Cassette Scandal, also known as Kuchmagate. Moroz publicly accused Kuchma of being involved in the disappearance and murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze, who had been found decapitated in Kyiv. He played select recordings that supposedly proved Kuchma ordered the abduction of Gongadze to journalists using a cassette player, which earned the scandal its name.

The resultant Ukraine without Kuchma (UBK) protest campaign ended when it was violently dispersed by the Militsiya, the national police force, in March 2001. One of the party&#x27;s members who gained national prominence as a result of his involvement in the protests, Yuriy Lutsenko, would later become the minister of internal affairs under the government of Yulia Tymoshenko as well as Prosecutor General of Ukraine.

Separately, a group of former party members consisting of , , , and Vasyl Aresto, founded the splinter All-Ukrainian Union of Leftists &quot;Justice&quot; in April 2000. As members of the Socialist Platform, they had been expelled for their opposition to Moroz&#x27;s reforms within the party.

During the election campaign for the 2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election, opposition parties and candidates were afforded little media access, and the party&#x27;s youth wing endorsed the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united), a member of the pro-Kuchma alliance led by Viktor Medvedchuk. Nevertheless, the party managed to secure 6.9% of the popular vote, and 20 proportional seats seats, and 3 constituencies. The Union of Young Socialists was founded as the party&#x27;s new youth organisation the same year and led by Oleksandr Starynets, a former first secretary of Komsomol of Ukraine. The party was a participant in the Rise up, Ukraine! protests which called for early presidential elections.

The party was a participant in the Orange Revolution in 2004, a series of protests sparked by the fraudulent results of the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election. Moroz had been the party&#x27;s candidate but shifted his support to Viktor Yushchenko after garnering just 5.82% of the vote in the first round. The election&#x27;s initial result, which gave the victory to Kuchma-supported Viktor Yanukovych was contested by international observers. Yushchenko was declared the winner of the re-run, and Yanukovych resigned as prime minister to allow for the appointment of a new coalition government led by Yulia Tymoshenko, which counted the Socialist Party alongside Our Ukraine, the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc, and the Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Ukraine. The government&#x27;s inauguration was the first time the party held power as part of the executive branch of the central government. It received three ministerial portfolios, with Stanislav Nikolaenko assuming the position of Minister of Education and Science, Yuriy Lutsenko as Minister of Internal Affairs, and Oleksandr Baranivsky as Minister of Agrarian Affairs. The coalition was replicated at the regional level, with the party gaining the position of chairman of the regional state administration in two oblasts, as well as the appointment of Valentyna Semenyuk-Samsonenko as director of the State Property Fund of Ukraine. The party retained its position in the succeeding Yekhanurov government, which had come to power in the aftermath of a power struggle between the head of the National Security and Defense Council Petro Poroshenko and Tymoshenko, who was dismissed as prime minister as a result.

In 2005, the Ukrainian Party of Justice - Union of veterans, handicapped, Chornobyl liquidators, and Afghan warriors merged into the Socialist Party.

The party and Moroz played a key role in the 2006 Ukrainian political crisis. Negotiations to re-form an &quot;orange&quot; coalition after the March 2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election between the Socialist Party, Our Ukraine, and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc were complicated by mutual distrust and disputes over the allocation of positions in government; Moroz supported Tymoshenko&#x27;s claim to the premiership, and she in turn supported Moroz&#x27;s candidacy as chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, but Tymoshenko herself was unpopular among Socialist Party members, while Our Ukraine held counter negotiations with Yanukovych&#x27;s Party of Regions. Three months of negotiations seemed to close to an end after Moroz announced he would no longer seek the chairmanship and promised to support Our Ukraine&#x27;s presumptive candidate, Yury Yekhanurov, paving the way for the coalition&#x27;s confirmation on 21 June. However, when Petro Poroshenko was revealed as Our Ukraine&#x27;s candidate, Moroz submitted his own candidacy and was elected with the support of deputies from the Socialist Party, Party of Regions, and the Communist Party, which formed the basis for the creation of the Anti-Crisis Coalition. Moroz would justify the turnabout by claiming Our Ukraine had intentionally engineered the coalition&#x27;s breakup by nominating a candidate it knew the party couldn&#x27;t accept, and had planned to use that as their justification for entering into an alliance with the Party of Regions. 
The party&#x27;s decision to walk back on its agreement with its erstwhile &quot;orange&quot; allies proved controversial and had a lasting impact on the party&#x27;s image, as it was now seen as traitorous and corrupt. High-ranking members including then-minister for interior affairs Yuriy Lutsenko, who would go on to lead Yuriy Lutsenko&#x27;s People&#x27;s Self-Defense, party first secretary Yosip Vinsky, who would go on to join Tymoshenko&#x27;s Batkivshchyna, as well as Halyna Garmash, a member of the party&#x27;s political council, all resigned from the party in its immediate aftermath. Furthermore, a study conducted by the Gorenshin Institute in November 2006 showed that the party had lost much of its support in its traditional heartland in central Ukraine. When a power struggle between Yanukovych and Yushchenko led to the 2007 Ukrainian political crisis and a snap election in September the same year, the party&#x27;s vote share collapsed. It received just 2.86% of the national vote, 0.14% short of the minimum 3% threshold for entry into parliament. 

Much of the criticism for the poor electoral result within the party was directed against Yaroslav Mendus, who was in charge of the party&#x27;s campaign during the election, as well as businessman Mykola Rudkovsky, both of whom were seen &quot;grey cardinals&quot; and the main figures behind the party&#x27;s cooperation with Yanukovych. Others in the leadership such as Valentina-Semenyuk and Mykhailo Melnychuk were similarly targeted. Their critics included well-known members of the party such as Volodymyr Boyko, a red director and a major financial contributor to the party, youth leader Yevhen Filindash, and former ministers Stanislav Nikolaenko, and Oleksandr Baranivsky. However, no changes were ultimately made to the composition of the party&#x27;s leadership in that year&#x27;s congress.

Continued dissension within the party culminated in the expulsion of Nikolaenko and Baranivsky, who were branded &quot;schismatics&quot; alongside Mykola Sadovy by Moroz. The two would go on to join the splinter &quot;Justice&quot; party along with some 300 members in March 2009. Both Nikolaenko and Baranivsky had previously put forward a programme to reform the party at a congress in April 2008, advocating the introduction of a two-term limit for both the party&#x27;s leader and head of the central control commission, the party&#x27;s disciplinary body. They also proposed introducing secret ballots for elections, purportedly with the aim of removing Moroz from the leadership. Other critical figures such as Yevhen Filindash left the party in April 2008, while Mykola Sadovy was only handed a reprimand.

In a press conference in November 2009, Moroz stated he had no regrets about joining the Anti-Crisis Coalition, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m not ashamed but proud of the fact that I managed to halt the crisis of power. The economy operated normal and, the parliament adopted 80% of the laws [it considered] by a constitutional majority of votes. We were close to the decentralization of power. That&#x27;s why Tymoshenko and Yushchenko&#x27;s supporters forced the president to dismiss the parliament and remove me and my political forces illegally&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
The party nominated Moroz as their candidate in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election, and garnered just 0.4% of the vote. The election was eventually won by Viktor Yanukovych. Moroz stepped down as leader in July 2010 and was replaced by Vasyl Tsushko, the incumbent minister for the economy in the Azarov government. Moroz was made the party&#x27;s honorary leader. The other candidates included Mykola Rudkovsky, one of the party&#x27;s financers, Viktor Subotin, the general manager of Turboatom, and Valentina-Semenyuk. The party&#x27;s electoral misfortunes continued in that year&#x27;s local elections, where just 38 councilors from the party were elected across 11 oblasts and three city councils. It performed the best in the Chernihiv and Poltava Oblasts where the party won 11% and 5.8% of the votes respectively.

Tsushko himself resigned as leader in July 2011, citing the difficulty of combining his position in government as head of the Anti-Monopoly Committee with party responsibilities. Sources within the party claim the true reason was Tsuhko&#x27;s deteriorating health. Rudkovsky, who allegedly received the support of the ruling Party of Regions, lost to Moroz, who ran on a platform of bringing the party into the opposition to the Azarov government, in a contentious leadership election. The same month, the party was expelled from the Socialist International for failing to comply with &quot;the fundamental values and principles of the International&quot;. However, the minutes of the meeting where the decision was undertaken showed that the party had been expelled &quot;due to not being actively engaged in SI activities, having no representation, or not having paid membership fees for some time&quot;.

Rudkovsky left the party in December 2011 after a planned merger of 11 left-wing parties failed, accusing Moroz of sabotaging the unification process to maintain his cult of personality. The party had been member to an agreement announced in November that year which would have seen ten other left-wing parties merge into the Socialist Party, whereupon it would adopt a new name. This plan fell apart when the party&#x27;s political council refused to ratify the merger agreement and demanded the other parties merge into the Socialist Party without any conditions. Only five parties agreed to do so; the Peasant Party of Ukraine, Socialist Ukraine, Children of War, &quot;Children of War&quot; People&#x27;s Party of Ukraine, and Cossack Glory, while the remaining five parties opted to merge and form the United Left and Peasants. In January 2012, the Ministry of Justice declared the merger between the Peasant Party and the Socialist Party illegal.

Rumours that Moroz would resign as leader amid reports of his deteriorating health appeared in April 2012 ahead of that year&#x27;s party congress. Petro Ustenko was elected the party&#x27;s leader after being nominated by Moroz, winning 267 votes out of 342. He previously served as the party&#x27;s first deputy chairman responsible organisational work as well as head of the party&#x27;s election headquarters. In the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election, failed to win any representation in parliament. It garnered just 0.46% of the party list vote and failed to win in any of the 58 constituencies it contested in.

The party&#x27;s poor performance in the parliamentary elections as well as Ustenko&#x27;s failure to secure funding for the party culminated in a crisis in 2013. That year&#x27;s congress was postponed from July to October as a result of &quot;secret negotiations between some heads regional party organisations with authorities about funding&quot;, with Rudkovsky, who had been readmitted to the party after he won a seat as a self-nominated candidate in the 2012 election and joined the Party of Regions faction in parliament, having reportedly held several meetings with party members where he promised to provide funding for the party. Sources close to the party described it as an &quot;internal struggle&quot; between Moroz and Rudkovsky.

The resultant congress adopted a new party statute and created two new positions; leader, which would be held by Ustenko, responsible for the party&#x27;s organisation, and chairman, by Rudkovsky, who would be responsible for the party&#x27;s political direction. Valentina-Semenyuk was touted as a possible contender for the leadership but withdrew when nominated, as did Moroz. Political scientist Andrey Zolotarev considered Rudkovsky&#x27;s election to be part of a plan by the ruling Party of Regions to weaken the popular support of its erstwhile Communist ally.

In the aftermath of the Euromaidan and Revolution of Dignity, which saw the overthrow of Yanukovych and the dismissal of the Party of Regions-led government, acting president Oleksandr Turchynov ordered the Ministry of Justice to open investigations against the Communist Party for &quot;anti-state activities&quot; in May 2014, putting its continued existence into doubt. This meant the Socialist Party&#x27;s political and monetary value experienced a significant increase as its status as the country&#x27;s oldest left-wing party left it in prime position for inheriting a sizable portion of the Communist electorate in the upcoming 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election. In that context, a congress was held on 21 June where the decision was made by a majority of delegates present to return to the party&#x27;s previous statute and elect Rudkovsky as the party&#x27;s sole leader. In response, a security firm hired by Ustenko raided the party&#x27;s office, who contested the legitimacy of the congress and its results, resulting in a protracted legal battle. Both Ustenko and Rudkovsky accused each other of intending to sell off the party.

The State Register&#x27;s refusal to register the results of the party&#x27;s congress left it unable to participate in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election; its members were part of the electoral list of the Bloc of Left Forces instead. The party won 0.08% of the vote and returned no deputies. For similar reasons, the party couldn&#x27;t participate in the 2015 Ukrainian local elections.

Citing &quot;unsatisfactory health&quot;, Rudkovsky stepped down as leader and fled the country in 2015. He was replaced by Mykola Sadovy at the second stage of the twentieth congress held in August.

In June 2017, the Administrative Court of Cassation confirmed the Kyiv District Administrative Court&#x27;s 2015 decision that the results of the 2014 congress were to be implemented in full and the State Register&#x27;s refusal was illegal.

In July 2017, Illia Kyva announced that he had been elected as the party&#x27;s chairman on his Facebook page. The former leader of the far-right political party Right Sector in eastern Ukraine, Kyva&#x27;s election was described by Moroz as an attempt by Ustenko&#x27;s faction to nullify the administrative court of cassation&#x27;s decision. Ivan Bokyi, a former chairman of the party&#x27;s parliamentary faction, described Kyva&#x27;s election as a government-linked raid against the party. Ustenko later admitted that Kyva&#x27;s election was part of an agreement with internal minister Arsen Avakov, to whom Kyva was an advisor; he was to help the party prepare for future presidential and parliamentary elections.

The same month, the State Register was updated and listed Kyva as the party&#x27;s chairman and Ustenko the leader.

In response to Kyva&#x27;s election, Sadovy&#x27;s faction opted to elect Serhiy Kaplin as their leader. Kaplin was a people&#x27;s deputy linked to Avakov&#x27;s rival, politician and oligarch Serhiy Lyovochkin. The faction subsequently agreed to enter into a coalition with Kaplin&#x27;s Social Democratic Party (SDP) as well as the Party of Pensioners for upcoming elections.

In January 2018, Ustenko and his faction&#x27;s members were removed from the State Register. Ustenko accused Kyva of being responsible and announced his expulsion from the party. In an appearance on Espreso TV, a Ukrainian news organisation owned by Avakov&#x27;s wife Inna Avakova, Kyva denied reports of his expulsion and alleged that Ustenko had been in contact with individuals linked to Russian president Vladimir Putin and Russian organised crime to negotiate funding for the party, further claiming that they had been expelled from the party the previous month as a result. In response, Ustenko launched a lawsuit to nullify the changes made to the State Register.

In March 2018, Kyva&#x27;s faction approved a new programme where it adopted an outwardly pro-European Atlanticist attitude, advocating for the Ukrainian membership in the European Union and NATO. It also adopted a new logo, a yellow fist on a crimson background, and nominated Kyva as its candidate for the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election. He won just 0.03% of the vote and was replaced as the party&#x27;s leader by Serhiy Cherednychenko. The faction nominated candidates for two constituencies in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Cherednychenko in the 144th district and pro-Russian oligarch Oleksandr Onyshchenko in the 93rd district. It also co-operated with the pro-Russian Opposition Platform — For Life, with Kyva being elected as a member of its closed list.

In January 2019, Kaplin&#x27;s election as chairman of the Sadovy faction was nullified, and the party opted to support Moroz&#x27;s candidacy in the presidential election instead. However, Moroz withdrew from the race four days before the first round of voting.

=== Russian invasion and banning ===

On 24 February 2022, Russia launched an invasion into Ukraine. On 6 March, Kyva was charged with high treason after making a number of statements justifying the invasion and blaming it on Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He had fled to Russia a month prior to the invasion. The SPU was one of several political parties suspended by the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine as a result of the invasion, along with Derzhava, Left Opposition, Nashi, Opposition Bloc, Opposition Platform — For Life, Party of Shariy, Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine, Union of Leftists, and the Volodymyr Saldo Bloc.

On 15 June 2022, the Eighth Administrative Court of Appeal banned the party and all of its property was transferred to the state. Vikor Zaika, who was also the director of the Illia Kyva Charitable Foundation &quot;Liberation&quot;, was the party&#x27;s official leader at its banning. The Security Service of Ukraine and Ministry of Justice cited the party&#x27;s alleged anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russian activities, statements of its previous leaders, as well as Kyva&#x27;s continued influence over the party as its justifications.

On 18 October 2022, the final appeal against the party&#x27;s ban lodged by Sadovy&#x27;s faction was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Ukraine.

== Ideological development ==
While the party was founded at the initiative of reformists within the Soviet-era Communist Party of Ukraine, the rank-and-file membership who answered the appeal for the formation of a new left-wing party were significantly more radical than its leadership and many who had participated in the party&#x27;s founding had sought to recreate the banned Communist Party under a new name. This had a significant impact on the party&#x27;s early positions; while it adopted a compromise on the national question, positioning itself as a supporter of Ukrainian statehood, but one based on the equality of all individuals regardless of nationality, and advocated for unity with former Soviet republics, it fiercely opposed any and all reforms to the country&#x27;s economic system, with Moroz decrying the &quot;unprecedented, uncontrolled profiteering of Western monopolies in the economical and spiritual space of Ukraine&quot;. It also adopted the view that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was caused by the failure of the state-bureaucratic system rather than the result of a crisis of socialism.

The party&#x27;s poor performance in the 1994 parliamentary elections, where it won fewer seats than the refounded Communist Party, as well as Moroz&#x27;s election as parliamentary chairman, which necessitated compromise with the executive, provided the some impetus for the party to begin adopting a more moderate position. In a post-election congress held in April 1994, Moroz publicly complained about the attitude of some of the party&#x27;s membership, who had tried to &quot;transfer the party organisation over to the Communists&quot; upon its refoundation in 1993. Instead, he argued that with the party free of its defectors—some 40,000 party members had left for the Communist Party in between 1993 and 1994—it could now adopt a more centrist approach. The party&#x27;s leadership thus adopted a less antagonistic attitude towards the government&#x27;s reform programme and accepted the principle of private ownership, if only for the service and retail trade industry. Moroz&#x27;s supporters also began to talk of emulating the Democratic Left Alliance of Poland, whose electoral success in the 1993 Polish parliamentary election allowed it to form a coalition government; that following the &quot;Polish route&quot;, the party should build a broad coalition of left-wing parties with democratic and progressive-patriotic forces.

During this time, the party also attempted to affirm its Ukrainian character by claiming the legacy of non-Soviet socialists such as Mykhailo Drahomanov and Volodymyr Vynnychenko, as well as early nationalist figures within the Ukrainian SSR, such as Vasyl Shahkrai, Mykola Skrypnyk, Christian Rakovsky, and Alexander Shumsky.

The party&#x27;s right-ward shift resulted in a split in 1995, when the head of the party&#x27;s theoretical council and author of its political programme, Natalia Vitrenko, was expelled from the party&#x27;s faction in parliament, and finally expelled from the party proper alongside Volodomyr Marchenko in 1996. With the possibility of another large-scale defection, as much of the party&#x27;s rank-and-file&#x27;s sympathies laid with the rebels, a special congress in February 1996 reverted to a more hardline stance. However, the party&#x27;s move toward the centre was renewed with the adoption of a &quot;New Course&quot; in its June 1998 congress, held in the aftermath of that year&#x27;s parliamentary elections, where the party won just 34 seats compared to the Communists&#x27; 124. Moroz opened the party to other social and political movements and deemphasised Marxism-Leninism as the party&#x27;s theoretical base, while abandoning ideas such as the dictatorship of the proletariat and class struggle entirely. The party further sought to broaden its appeal to include the emerging middle class and &quot;honest&quot; industrialist. While the congress had been compared to the one the Social Democratic Party of Germany 1959 Godesberg Congress, the changes it introduced can be traced back to Robert Hue&#x27;s modernisation of the French Communist Party, from which Moroz took inspiration.

The adoption of an explicitly democratic socialist programme at the party&#x27;s May 2000 congress was preceded by another two waves of expulsions in December 1999 and February 2000 of members of the Socialist Platform. The document, which classified the party as centre-left, consisted of a minimum programme, which called for the elimination of the oligarchic clan system and establishment of a transitionary government, and a maximum programme, which called for the establishment of democratic socialism in Ukraine. The party also advocated European integration as well as Ukrainian membership in the Commonwealth of Independent States, but opposed membership in NATO and its expansion into Eastern Europe. 

In its 2006 pre-election programme &quot;We will build Europe in Ukraine&quot;, the party promoted itself as a European social democratic party and proposed a referendum on Ukrainian membership in NATO. In contrast, its 2007 pre-election programme lacked the previous year&#x27;s social democratic character, did not mention NATO, and advocated closer relations with both the European Union and Russia.

<text>Jason Reece (born July 13, 1971) is a member of Austin, Texas rock band ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, pulling double duties as both drummer and part-time frontman.

==Biography==
Reece was born in Huntington Beach, CA to Patrick and Kathleen Reece. At an early age, Reece&#x27;s family moved him and his younger brother, Cole, to the rural outskirts of Hilo, Hawaii. As a teenager, Reece&#x27;s family moved again from The Big Island to Oahu where he met Conrad Keely through a mutual friend, and they later both moved to Olympia, WA where Keely attended college. There they formed a band from which Reece was shortly fired. Reece then joined the band Honeybucket and, when that band broke up, Mukilteo Fairies. In 1994 Reece relocated to Austin. Keely joined him in moving, and they formed ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, initially as a guitar-and-drums duo. Later other members joined, and in 2001, after two albums released on independent labels, the band was signed by Interscope. Reece continued to have side-projects, such as A Roman Scandal, and his solo work, A Flood of Red. Little known fact he also had a brief acting career in the 1995 TV series Mighty Morphin Power Rangers as the White Power Ranger.

<text>The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (CMStP&amp;P), better known as the Milwaukee Road , was a Class I railroad that operated in the Midwest and Northwest of the United States from 1847 until 1986.

The company experienced financial difficulty through the 1970s and 1980s, including bankruptcy in 1977 (though it filed for bankruptcy twice in 1925 and 1935, respectively). In 1980, it abandoned its Pacific Extension, which included track in the states of Montana, Idaho, and Washington. The remaining system was merged into the Soo Line Railroad , a subsidiary of Canadian Pacific Kansas City , on January 1, 1986. Much of its historical trackage remains in use by other railroads. The company brand is commemorated by buildings like the historic Milwaukee Road Depot in Minneapolis and preserved locomotives such as Milwaukee Road 261 which operates excursion trains.

==History==
===Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Minneapolis Railroad===
The railroad that became the Milwaukee Road began as the Milwaukee and Waukesha Railroad in Wisconsin, whose goal was to link the developing Lake Michigan port City of Milwaukee with the Mississippi River. The company incorporated in 1847, but changed its name to the Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad in 1850 before construction began. Its first line, long, opened between Milwaukee and Wauwatosa, on November 20, 1850. Extensions followed to Waukesha in February 1851, Madison, and finally the Mississippi River at Prairie du Chien in 1857.

As a result of the financial panic of 1857, the M&amp;M went into receivership in 1859, and was purchased by the Milwaukee and Prairie du Chien Railroad in 1861. In 1867, Alexander Mitchell combined the M&amp;PdC with the Milwaukee and St. Paul (formerly the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company) under the name Milwaukee and St. Paul. Critical to the development and financing of the railroad was the acquisition of significant land grants. Prominent individual investors in the line included Alexander Mitchell, Russell Sage, Jeremiah Milbank, and William Rockefeller.

In 1874, the name was changed to Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul after constructing an extension to Chicago in 1872. The company absorbed the Chicago and Pacific Railroad Company in 1879, the railroad that built the Bloomingdale Line (now The 606) and what became the Milwaukee District / West Line as part of the 36-mile Elgin Subdivision from Halsted Street in Chicago to the suburb of Elgin, Illinois. In 1890, the company purchased the Milwaukee and Northern Railroad; by now, the railroad had lines running through Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

The corporate headquarters were moved from Milwaukee to the Rand McNally Building in Chicago, America&#x27;s first all-steel framed skyscraper, in 1889 and 1890, with the car and locomotive shops staying in Milwaukee. The company&#x27;s general offices were later located in Chicago&#x27;s Railway Exchange building (built 1904) until 1924, at which time they moved to Chicago Union Station.

===Pacific Extension===
In the 1890s, the company&#x27;s directors felt they had to extend the railroad to the Pacific to remain competitive with other railroads. A survey in 1901 estimated costs to build to the Pacific Northwest as $45 million ($ in dollars). In 1905, the board approved the Pacific Extension, now estimated at $60 million ($ in dollars). The contract for the western part of the route was awarded to Horace Chapin Henry of Seattle. The subsidiary Chicago, Milwaukee and Puget Sound Railway Company was chartered in 1905 to build from the Missouri River to Seattle and Tacoma.

Construction began in 1906 and was completed three years later. The route chosen was shorter than the next shortest competitor&#x27;s, as well as better grades than some, but it was an expensive route, since Milwaukee Road received few land grants and had to buy most of the land or acquire smaller railroads.

The two main mountain ranges that had to be crossed, the Rockies and the Cascades, required major civil engineering works and additional locomotive power. The completion of of railroad through some of the most varied topography in the nation in only three years was a major feat. Original company maps denote five mountain crossings: Belts, Rockies, Bitterroots, Saddles, and Cascades. These are slight misnomers as the Belt mountains and Bitterroots are part of the Rockies. The route did not cross over the Little Belts or Big Belts, but over the Lenep-Loweth Ridge between the Castle Mountains and the Crazy Mountains.

Some historians question the choice of route, since it bypassed some population centers and passed through areas with limited local traffic potential. Much of the line paralleled the Northern Pacific Railway. &quot;Trains&quot; magazine called the building of the extension, primarily a long-haul route, &quot;egregious&quot; and a &quot;disaster&quot;. George H. Drury listed the Pacific Extension as one of several &quot;wrong decisions&quot; made by the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s management which contributed to the company&#x27;s eventual failure.

Beginning in 1909, several smaller railroads were acquired and expanded to form branch lines along the Pacific Extension.
*The Montana Railroad formed the mainline route through Sixteen Mile Canyon as well as the North Montana Line which extended North from Harlowton to Lewistown. This branch led to the settlement of the Judith Basin and, by the 1970s, accounted for 30% of the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s total traffic.
*The Gallatin Valley Electric Railway, originally built as an interurban line, was extended from Bozeman to the mainline at Three Forks. In 1927, the railroad built the Gallatin Gateway Inn, where passengers traveling to Yellowstone National Park transferred to buses for the remainder of their journey.
*The White Sulphur Springs &amp; Yellowstone Park Railway, originally built by Lew Penwell and John Ringling, primarily carried lumber and agricultural products.

Operating conditions in the mountain regions of the Pacific Extension proved difficult. Winter temperatures of in Montana made it challenging for steam locomotives to generate sufficient steam. The line snaked through mountainous areas, resulting in &quot;long steep grades and sharp curves&quot;. Electrification provided an answer, especially with abundant hydroelectric power in the mountains, and a ready source of copper in Anaconda, Montana. Between 1914 and 1916, the Milwaukee Road implemented a 3,000 volt direct current (DC) overhead system between Harlowton, Montana, and Avery, Idaho, a distance of . Pleased with the result, the Milwaukee electrified its route in Washington between Othello and Tacoma, a further , between 1917 and 1920. This section traversed the Cascades through the Snoqualmie Tunnel, just south of Snoqualmie Pass and over lower in elevation. The single-track tunnel&#x27;s east portal at Hyak included an adjacent company-owned ski area (1937−1950).

Together, the of main-line electrification represented the largest such project in the world up to that time, and would not be exceeded in the US until the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s efforts in the 1930s. The two separate electrified districts were never unified, as the Idaho Division (Avery to Othello) was comparatively flat down the St. Joe River to St. Maries and through eastern Washington, and posed few challenges for steam operation. Electrification cost $27 million, but resulted in savings of over $1 million per year from improved operational efficiency.

===Bankruptcies===
The Chicago, Milwaukee, and Puget Sound Railway was absorbed by the parent company on January 1, 1913. The Pacific Extension, including subsequent electrification, cost the Milwaukee Road $257 million, over four times the original estimate of $60 million. To meet this cost, the Milwaukee Road sold bonds, which began coming due in the 1920s. Traffic never met projections, and by the early 1920s, the Milwaukee Road was in serious financial condition. This state was exacerbated by the railroad&#x27;s purchase of several heavily indebted railroads in Indiana. The company declared bankruptcy in 1925 and reorganized as the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in 1928. In 1929, its total mileage stood at .
In 1927, the railroad launched its second edition of the &quot;Olympian&quot; as a premier luxury limited passenger train and opened its first railroad-owned tourist hotel, the Gallatin Gateway Inn in Montana, southwest of Bozeman, via a spur from Three Forks.

The reorganized company scarcely had a chance for success before the Great Depression hit. Despite innovations such as the famous &quot;Hiawatha&quot; high-speed trains that exceeded , the railroad again filed for bankruptcy in 1935. The Milwaukee Road operated under trusteeship until December 1, 1945.

During WWII the CMSt.P&amp;P sponsored one of the Army&#x27;s MRS units the 757th Railroad Shop Battalion.

===Postwar===
The Milwaukee Road enjoyed temporary success after World War II. Out of bankruptcy and with the wartime ban on new passenger service lifted, the company upgraded its trains. The &quot;Olympian Hiawatha&quot; began running between Chicago and the Puget Sound over the Pacific Extension in 1947, and the &quot;Twin Cities Hiawatha&quot; received new equipment in 1948. Dieselisation accelerated and was complete by 1957. In 1955, the Milwaukee Road took over from the Chicago and North Western&#x27;s handling of Union Pacific&#x27;s streamliner trains between Chicago and Omaha.The whole railroad industry found itself in decline in the late 1950s and the 1960s, but the Milwaukee Road was hit particularly hard. The Midwest was overbuilt with a plethora of competing railroads, while the competition on the transcontinental routes to the Pacific was tough. The premier transcontinental streamliner, the &quot;Olympian Hiawatha&quot;, despite innovative scenic observation cars, was mothballed in 1961, becoming the first visible casualty. The resignation of President John P. Kiley in 1957 and his replacement with the fairly inexperienced William John Quinn was a pivotal moment. From that point onward, the road&#x27;s management was fixated on merger with another railroad as the solution to the Milwaukee&#x27;s problems.

Railroad mergers had to be approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and in 1969 the ICC effectively blocked the merger with the Chicago and North Western Railway (C&amp;NW) that the Milwaukee Road had counted on and had been planning for since 1964. The ICC asked for terms that the C&amp;NW was not willing to agree to. The merger of the &quot;Hill Lines&quot; was approved at around the same time, and the merged Burlington Northern came into being.

===Early 1970s===

The formation of Burlington Northern in 1970 from the merger of Northern Pacific, Great Northern, Burlington Route, and the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway on March 3 created a stronger competitor on most Milwaukee Road routes. To boost competition, the ICC gave the Milwaukee Road the right to connect with new railroads in the West over Burlington Northern tracks. Traffic on its Pacific Extension increased substantially to more than four trains a day each way as it began interchanging cars with Southern Pacific at Portland, Oregon and Canadian railroads at Sumas, Washington. The railroad&#x27;s foothold on transcontinental traffic leaving the Port of Seattle increased such that the Milwaukee Road held a staggering advantage over BN, carrying nearly 80% of the originating traffic along with 50% of the total container traffic leaving the Puget Sound (prior to severe service declines after roughly 1974).

In 1970, the president of Chicago and North Western offered to sell the railroad to the Milwaukee Road outright. President William John Quinn refused, stating that it now believed only a merger with a larger system, not a slightly smaller one, could save the railroad. Almost immediately, the railroad filed unsuccessfully with the ICC to be included in the Union Pacific merger with the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad.

By the mid-1970s, deferred maintenance on Milwaukee Road&#x27;s physical plant, which had been increasing throughout the 1960s as it attempted to improve its financial appearance for merger, was beginning to cause problems. The railroad&#x27;s financial problems were exacerbated by their practice of improving its earnings during that period by selling off its wholly owned cars to financial institutions and leasing them back. The lease charges became greater, and more cars needed to be sold to pay the lease payments. The railroad&#x27;s fleet of cars was becoming older because more money was being spent on finance payments for the old cars rather than buying new ones. This contributed to car shortages that turned away business.

The Milwaukee Road chose at this time to end its mainline electrification. Its electric locomotive fleet was reaching the end of its service life, and newer diesel locomotives such as the EMD SD40-2 and the GE Universal Series were more than capable of handling the route. The final electric freight arrived at Deer Lodge, Montana on June 15, 1974.

In 1976, the Milwaukee Road exercised its right under the Burlington Northern merger to petition for inclusion based on its weak financial condition. The ICC denied it on March 2, 1977.

===Final bankruptcy===

Between 1974 and 1977, the Milwaukee Road lost $100 million, and the company filed for its third bankruptcy in 42 years on December 19, 1977. Judge Thomas R. McMillen presided over the bankruptcy until the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s sale in 1985. The railroad&#x27;s primary problem was that it possessed too much physical plant for the revenue it generated. In 1977, it owned of track, and 36% of that mileage produced a mere 14% of the company&#x27;s yearly revenue. The approach taken by the bankruptcy trustees was to sell or abandon unprofitable or marginally profitable lines, leaving a much smaller railroad which could be profitable. Outright liquidation was considered, but not pursued.

In 1980 the secondary line between Marquette, Iowa and Rapid City, South Dakota on its section between Mitchell and Kadoka was embargoed and then acquired by the South Dakota Department of Transportation.

Between 1977 and 1984, route distance was reduced to a quarter from its peak and a third from its total in 1977, shrinking to . The most extensive abandonment eliminated the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s transcontinental service to the West Coast. While the Burlington Northern merger generated more traffic on this route, it was only enough to wear out the deteriorating track, not enough to pay for rebuilding. This forced trains to slow at many locations due to bad track. A final attempt to devise a plan to rehabilitate the Pacific Extension under the Milwaukee Road Restructuring Act failed. Operations ended west of Miles City, Montana, on February 29, 1980.The new, smaller railroad began earning small profits in 1982 (that same year, its two commuter rail lines, collectively known as the Milwaukee District West and Milwaukee District North Lines respectively, were turned over to the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Rail Corporation, a forerunner of commuter rail agency Metra). Still in reorganization, the Milwaukee Road attracted interest from three potential buyers: the Grand Trunk Corporation, the Chicago and North Western Railway, and the Soo Line Railroad. The Interstate Commerce Commission approved the offers by both Soo Line and C&amp;NW. Ultimately, Judge McMillen approved the former&#x27;s offer on February 19, 1985. The Soo reorganized the property as The Milwaukee Road, Inc., prior to merging the Milwaukee into the company itself effective January 1, 1986. The Soo Line would be acquired by Canadian Pacific in 1990 with the latter consolidating with the Kansas City Southern Railway 33 years later.

In 1982, all that remained of the main line to the Pacific to Miles City, via Aberdeen, SD, along with other lines in the same state and in Montana was sold to BN.
The successor-in-interest to what remained of the Milwaukee Road after the Soo Line sale was its holding company, the Milwaukee Land Company, reverted to Chicago Milwaukee Corporation ownership (CMC). Without the railroad, CMC&#x27;s primary function became disposal or redevelopment of Milwaukee Road real estate not sold to the Soo Line, which stretched from Bedford, Indiana, to Washington state. The larger properties were developed into big-box retail or industrial sites. The CMC itself was beset with legal and financial woes, filing for bankruptcy (under numerous versions of CMC/Heartland Partners), as a result of environmental cleanup costs and liabilities at former Milwaukee Road sites. CMC Heartland, and its various reincarnations, were dissolved in a final liquidation process that came to a close in 2010.

Much of the abandoned Milwaukee PCE line has become rail trails. The Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail (formerly the John Wayne Pioneer Trail) in Washington, Milwaukee Road Rail Trail in Idaho, Route of the Hiawatha Trail in Idaho and Montana, Route of the Olympian in Montana, Midtown Greenway in Minnesota, Bugline Trail in Wisconsin, and Milwaukee Road Transportation Trailway in Indiana all run on sections of the right-of-way among others. Today, both the Milwaukee Road and Soo Line Railroad trackage make up the Midwest US routes of the CPKC.

Following the 1984 abandonment of the Pacific Extension, Tacoma Rail purchased all of Milwaukee&#x27;s lines south of Tacoma. Starting in 1990, the Chehalis–Centralia Railroad began operating over the section from Centralia to Curtis. In 2010 the line was sold to the Port of Chehalis and in 2019, The railroad purchased the line from Chehalis to Ruth. In 2021 the section from Highway 6 West to Curtis was leased.

Milwaukee Road Historical Association now owns the Milwaukee Road trademarks/copyrights, except for the AAR reporting marks (MILW) used by the Soo Line Railroad (which does business in the American Midwest as the Canadian Pacific Kansas City Railway).

The Milwaukee Road aggressively marketed passenger service through much of its history, maintaining a high quality of service until the end of private intercity passenger operations in 1971. The Milwaukee prided itself on its passenger operations, providing the nation with some of its most innovative and colorful trains. The railroad&#x27;s home-built equipment was among some of the best passenger equipment ever run on any American railroad. The Milwaukee&#x27;s reputation for high-quality service was the principal reason that Union Pacific shifted its service to the Milwaukee Road for its &quot;City&quot; streamliners in 1955.

The Milwaukee Road&#x27;s &quot;Pioneer Limited&quot; was one of the first named trains and its colorful &quot;Hiawatha&quot; trains were among the nation&#x27;s finest streamliners. The post-World War II &quot;Hiawatha&quot; trains remain a high-water mark for passenger train industrial design.

Starting in November 1955, the Milwaukee Road assumed joint operation of the Union Pacific&#x27;s &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;, &quot;City of Portland&quot;, &quot;City of Denver&quot;, and &quot;Challenger&quot; trains as well as the UP/Southern Pacific &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;. After assuming operation of the UP&#x27;s services, the Milwaukee Road gradually dropped its orange and maroon paint scheme in favor of UP&#x27;s Armour yellow, grey, and red, finding the latter easier to keep clean.

The Milwaukee Road&#x27;s streamlined passenger services were unique in that most of its equipment was built by the railroad at its Milwaukee Menomonee Valley shops, including the four generations of &quot;Hiawatha&quot; equipment introduced in 1933–34, 1935, 1937–38, and 1947–48. Most striking were the &quot;Beaver Tail&quot; observation cars of the 1930s and the &quot;Skytop Lounge&quot; observation cars by industrial designer Brooks Stevens in the 1940s. Extended &quot;Skytop Lounge&quot; cars were also ordered from Pullman for &quot;Olympian Hiawatha&quot; service in 1951. The &quot;Olympian Hiawatha&quot; set, as well as some full-length &quot;Super Domes&quot; were later sold to the Canadian National Railway.

Regional passenger trains that the Milwaukee Road operated from Chicago up to Amtrak&#x27;s assumption of passenger operations in 1971 included the &quot;Twin Cities Hiawatha&quot; serving Minneapolis, the &quot;Sioux&quot; serving Madison, Wisconsin, the &quot;Milwaukee Express&quot; serving Milwaukee, and the &quot;Varsity&quot; serving Madison. Amtrak still operates several services on the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s Twin Cities mainline. Daily long distance service to and from the Pacific Northwest is provided by the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; along the Chicago-St. Paul route after the train was rerouted by Amtrak on the first day of operations on May 1, 1971. Amtrak also operates corridor services as the &quot;Hiawatha&quot; along the Chicago-Milwaukee section of the route. In 2024, Amtrak began service for the &quot;Borealis&quot;, supplementing the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; with an extra daily round trip from Chicago to St. Paul.

For years, the Milwaukee Road also operated an extensive commuter rail service in the Chicago area. One branch served the northern suburbs and extended into the outer suburbs of Milwaukee, while another branch served the western suburbs. These services passed to the Regional Transportation Authority in 1982 after the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s bankruptcy. They are still operated today by Metra, Chicago&#x27;s commuter rail agency, as the Milwaukee District North Line and Milwaukee District West Line. Canadian Pacific dispatches Metra trains while running freight trains on both of these lines via trackage rights.

==In popular culture==
*The 1930 film &quot;Danger Lights&quot; was filmed in the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s yard and shop at Miles City, Montana and on the main line.

<text>Merge Records is an independent record label based in Durham, North Carolina. It was founded in 1989 by Laura Ballance and Mac McCaughan. It began as an outlet for music from their band Superchunk and music created by friends, and has expanded to include artists from around the world, with records reaching the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; music charts.

==History==
After releasing a number of 7&quot; records and cassettes, the first Merge Records full-length CD release came on April 1, 1992, with MRG020 Superchunk—&quot;Tossing Seeds&quot;, the band&#x27;s first collection of singles.

Merge&#x27;s early successes included Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s &quot;In the Aeroplane over the Sea&quot;, The Magnetic Fields&#x27; &quot;69 Love Songs&quot;, and Spoon&#x27;s &quot;Kill the Moonlight&quot;.

The label&#x27;s first album to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 was Arcade Fire&#x27;s &quot;Funeral&quot;, a 2004 release. Arcade Fire gave the label its then highest-charting release with their follow-up, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Neon Bible&quot;, which debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, and, later, reaching #1 with their third album, 2010&#x27;s &quot;The Suburbs&quot;. Other Billboard Top Ten releases include Spoon&#x27;s &quot;Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga&quot; and &quot;Transference&quot;, along with She &amp; Him&#x27;s (actress/musician Zooey Deschanel along with M. Ward, a popular Merge folk musician) &quot;Volume Two&quot;. Other notable Merge releases include Caribou&#x27;s Polaris Prize-winning &quot;Andorra&quot;, M. Ward&#x27;s &quot;Hold Time&quot;, Camera Obscura&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Out of This Country&quot;, and She &amp; Him&#x27;s &quot;Volume One&quot;.

In February 2009, due to adverse market conditions it was announced that Touch and Go Records would no longer manufacture and distribute records for Merge and many other independent record labels; Merge had been &quot;under the Touch and Go umbrella&quot; ever since its 1992 release of &quot;Tossing Seeds&quot;. Merge quickly reached an agreement with the Alternative Distribution Alliance to continue distribution of its releases.

In September 2009, Algonquin Paperbacks released &quot;Our Noise: The Story of Merge Records&quot;, a book chronicling the label&#x27;s history. This followed a 6-day music festival in Chapel Hill and Carrboro, NC, featuring over 40 Merge acts from around the world celebrating the 20th anniversary of the label&#x27;s first release. The label also released a subscription-only 17-disc box set &quot;SCORE! 20 Years of Merge Records&quot; throughout the 20th anniversary year curated by pop culture tastemakers such as David Byrne, Amy Poehler, Zach Galifianakis, Jonathan Lethem, Peter Buck, David Chang, Mindy Kaling and more, with all proceeds going to charities.

In August 2010, Merge Records released Arcade Fire&#x27;s &quot;The Suburbs&quot; to critical acclaim, preceding the band&#x27;s headlining appearance at Lollapalooza. The album went straight to number one on the U.S. and U.K. charts. Famed director and Monty Python member Terry Gilliam also directed a live online broadcast of the band&#x27;s concert from the historic Madison Square Garden in New York following the album&#x27;s release, which was streamed live by an estimated 1.8 million unique viewers. &quot;The Suburbs&quot; won the Grammy for Album of the Year at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards on February 13, 2011.

<text>Elizabeth Ann Smith Whitney (December 26, 1800 – February 15, 1882) was an early Latter Day Saint leader, and wife to Newel K. Whitney, another early Latter Day Saint leader. She went by her middle name, Ann.

==Early life and marriage==
Elizabeth Ann Smith was born in Derby, Connecticut, to Gibson Smith and Polly Bradley. She was the couple&#x27;s oldest child. Her parents did not attend any church, but identified as Christian, and Ann Smith later described her young self as &quot;naturally religious.&quot; As a child, she was &quot;carefully educated according to the customs of that early period&quot;, such as dancing&lt;ref name=&quot;woman&#x27;s exponent 8/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and singing. When Smith was about 18 years old, she had some sort of disagreement with her mother and left home. She followed her unmarried aunt, Sarah Smith, westward to Kirtland, Ohio. In this venture, the two women displayed what Mark L. Staker, a faculty member of the LDS Church History Department, calls &quot;a strong sense of self-reliance&quot;. Sarah Smith bought a parcel of land within the Connecticut Western Reserve, and soon one of Ann&#x27;s uncles joined them in Ohio. Her father also tried to move west, but was prevented from doing so by his wife.

When she was 20 she met her future husband, Newel K. Whitney. The couple was married on October 20, 1822 after a three-year courtship. They quickly accumulated wealth and status in their community. They had eleven children together and adopted several homeless children.

===Conversion===
In Kirtland, Ann and her husband joined the Disciples of Christ, called the Campbellites at the time, led in the area by Sidney Rigdon. This group denied it had power to give the gift of the Holy Spirit. This, along with vague answers to Whitney&#x27;s questions, caused her and her husband to pray for direction. In response to that prayer, the couple claimed to have seen a vision and a voice stating, &quot;Prepare to receive the word of the Lord, for it is coming!&quot;

Sidney Rigdon converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which had been established by Joseph Smith in April 1830. In 1830, Whitney heard of his conversion and of the missionaries who were in the area. She agreed to hear them preach, and was particularly impressed that they did not ask for any financial compensation from their audiences. She went home after hearing them speak to share with her husband that she felt it was the right church. Parley P. Pratt then taught Ann and Newel about the faith, and the two chose to be baptized in November 1830.&lt;ref name=&quot;woman&#x27;s exponent 9/1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rigdon performed their baptisms.

Joseph and Emma Smith arrived at Newel K. Whitney&#x27;s store in Kirtland in December 1830. Joseph said, &quot;I am Joseph the Prophet; you have prayed me here; now what do you want of me?&quot; The Smiths then stayed in their home. While there, Joseph received revelations that are recorded in Doctrine and Covenants, most likely sections 41 through 44. Whitney felt that the Joseph and Emma&#x27;s coming was fulfillment of a vision she and Newel had previously witnessed, in which &quot;a cloud of glory rested upon [their] house.&quot; They lodged with the Whitneys for a number of weeks. Joseph noticed the quality of Whitney&#x27;s singing voice and accordingly dubbed her &quot;the sweet songstress of Zion&quot;. Immediately after receiving her patriarchal blessing at the hand of Joseph Smith Sr., Whitney sang about the history and importance of Adam-ondi-Ahman in tongues. The blessing had mentioned the &quot;gift of singing inspirationally.&quot;

Whitney and her husband hosted a three-day feast for the poor in January 1836. They lost some of their wealth when the Kirtland Safety Society Banking Company collapsed and people began persecuting members of the church.

==Traveling westward==
Whitney and her family traveled with the members of the church. They left Kirtland to move to Far West, Missouri in the fall of 1838 due to persecution.&lt;ref name=&quot;woman&#x27;s exponent 11/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, when they reached St. Louis, they were informed that Latter-day Saints were being kicked out of Missouri. They settled in Carrollton, Illinois during the winter of 1838–39. They then moved to Quincy, Illinois during the next winter. By the spring of 1840, they had reached Nauvoo, Illinois, then called Commerce. When the family reached Nauvoo, most of them were sick, and Whitney had her ninth child. The couple received their endowments and were sealed in the Nauvoo Temple by Joseph Smith.

The family continued moving with the Saints, and went to Winter Quarters in February, 1846 before migrating to the Salt Lake Valley. During the difficult trek west, Whitney developed rheumatoid arthritis in her arms and legs. She also gave birth to a son, Newel M., at Winter Quarters. They arrived in Salt Lake City on September 24, 1848. Two years later, her husband died.

==LDS Church service==
In March 1842, Whitney became one of the original leaders of the Relief Society, with Emma Hale Smith, Sarah M. Cleveland, and Eliza Roxcy Snow (who had been her acquaintance in Kirtland). Whitney served as the second counselor under Emma Smith. Whitney presided over many of the Relief Society&#x27;s last meetings in Nauvoo, as Emma Smith was away travelling, ill, or struggling with Joseph Smith&#x27;s doctrine of plural marriage. Ann and Newell Whitney consented for Joseph Smith to marry their daughter in 1842. Shortly after Joseph Smith&#x27;s death in 1844, Newel took another wife. Ann wrote that she was &quot;more favorably disposed to women as a class&quot; since she had a sister wife.

After the Nauvoo temple was completed, Whitney was the second woman to receive her endowment (after Emma Smith). Whitney worked there daily during the winter of 1845–46 to help other members receive their endowments. In 1850, Brigham Young called her to be in charge of the women&#x27;s department of the Endowment House. Whitney also served as second counselor to Eliza R. Snow in the Relief Society presidency from 1880–82.

=== Later years ===
Beginning in August 1878, Whitney&#x27;s autobiography was published in a series called &quot;A Leaf from an Autobiography&quot; in the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Exponent&quot;. In November 1879, she purchased a plot of land that had previously belonged to Brigham Young.

==Death==
Elizabeth Whitney was affectionately called &quot;Mother Whitney&quot; by members of the church for her service and compassion. It is noted that she had the gift of tongues, and that she even sang in tongues. Whitney also used seer stones. She died in Salt Lake City in 1882 and was buried in Salt Lake City Cemetery. At the time of her death she was the second oldest member of the LDS church. Daniel H. Wells, Lorenzo D. Young, and Joseph F. Smith spoke at Whitney&#x27;s funeral and praised her for her faith and service in the church. A residence hall at Brigham Young University was named after her in 1957.

<text>Source Tags &amp; Codes is the third album by American rock band ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead and the first distributed by a major record label. It was released on February 26, 2002 to wide critical acclaim. The album is often cited as the band&#x27;s finest work.

Music videos were produced for &quot;Another Morning Stoner&quot; and &quot;Relative Ways&quot;, which saw airplay on MTV2.

==Recording and production==
After releasing two albums on indie record imprints, Trail of Dead signed a multi-release deal with Interscope Records and began recording a follow-up to 1999&#x27;s &quot;Madonna&quot; with the same producer, Mike McCarthy. Their major label budget improved recording quality and allowed intricate orchestral pieces, yielding a sound texture unlike previous records. &quot;Source Tags &amp; Codes&quot; was recorded in Cotati, California and mixed in Nashville, Tennessee on a budget of 150,000 dollars.

==Music==
The song &#x27;Baudelaire&#x27; refers to the French poet, Charles Baudelaire, and &#x27;Days of Being Wild&#x27; is named after the Hong Kong film of the same name. &quot;After the Laughter&quot; samples the song &quot;Someday (You&#x27;ll Want Me to Want You)&quot;. The song &quot;Homage&quot; is a homage to Unwound. On the day &quot;Homage&quot; was recorded, producer Mike McCarthey woke Keely up that morning by throwing cold water in his face for him to be aggressive enough to record the drum track.

In &quot;It Was There That I Saw You&quot;: &quot;Keely had intended to conjure up the intoxicating thrill of living in Austin Texas in the mid-nineties, before America had gone to shit. The inspiration came from a girl he used to work with that he had a crush on, and several late nights spent in the company of people on drugs&quot; 

The title of &quot;Another Morning Stoner&quot; refers to getting an erection in the morning or smoking marijuana. The song is inspired by Keely&#x27;s relationship with his ex-girlfriend who was raised Christian. &quot;It recalls a moral dilemma he underwent when he realized that eventually theology would drive them apart more than anything else, because of his strong negative feelings towards organized religion.&quot;

==Critical reception==

&quot;Source Tags &amp; Codes&quot; was met with critical acclaim, receiving a score of 85 out of 100 on review aggregate site Metacritic, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;″s Michael Chamy called &quot;Source Tags &amp; Codes&quot; &quot;an album that absolutely cannot be ignored&quot;, while &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Annie Zaleski stated that &quot;what makes &quot;Source Tags &amp; Codes&quot; such an amazing album is how the band teeters on the edge of this implosion but always yanks its songs back from collapse at the very last second.&quot; Noel Murray of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that the band &quot;plays imaginative alt-rock with intense passion, and &quot;Source Tags &amp; Codes&quot; lets the pressure build exquisitely.&quot; Noting its &quot;angular, Sonic Youth-style guitar and earnest anger&quot;, &quot;Blender&quot;″s Michael Leonard credited the album for being &quot;more engaging than many of [the band&#x27;s] post-rock peers&quot;, while &quot;Uncut&quot; similarly wrote that &quot;compared to so many noisemongers, TOD understand that restraint enables unleashed firepower to be exhilarating and awesome.&quot; Matt LeMay of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; awarded &quot;Source Tags &amp; Codes&quot; a perfect score and wrote that the album &quot;will take you in, rip you to shreds, piece you together, lick your wounds clean, and send you back into the world with a concurrent sense of loss and hope,&quot; though Conrad Keely considers this rating to be &quot;preposterous&quot;, as &quot;it is clearly nowhere close to a perfect album&quot;.

Hobey Echlin of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that &quot;Source Tags &amp; Codes&quot; &quot;captures the fuzzy-math sound from too many gray-area indie bands—and it rocks hard where geezers like Mercury Rev just drift away.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; described the album as &quot;not a crossover record, but invigorating.&quot; Among average reviews, &quot;Q&quot; felt that the band &quot;has reached a point where the need for convention outweighs the joy of using guitars as weapons.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau awarded the album a &quot;dud&quot; rating, indicating &quot;a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.&quot; While noting that &quot;there&#x27;s a fantastic EP in here somewhere&quot;, Maddy Costa of &quot;The Guardian&quot; nonetheless felt that the album &quot;is ablaze with emotion – it roars and pulses and oozes angst – but it never inspires&quot;.

&quot;Kludge&quot; included it on their list of best albums of 2002.

By 2005, &quot;Source Tags &amp; Codes&quot; sales had surpassed 100,000 units.

<text>Celaya Fútbol Club is a Mexican professional football club based in Celaya, Guanajuato, that plays in the Liga de Expansión MX, the second level division of Mexican football. The club was founded in 1954, then changed its name to Atlético Celaya in 1994. After its dissolution in 2002, it returns as Cajeteros de Celaya from 2003 to 2005, and later renamed as Club Celaya in 2007. Since 2008, the club uses its original name.

==History==

===Early years (1954–1970)===
Celaya was established as a football club on 7 February 1954 as Celaya Fútbol Club, A.C. by Miguel Iriarte Montes, the first club president. Celaya registered in the Segunda División Profesional, which at that time it was the second most important league in Mexico. In its second year of existence the club finished runner-up to Monterrey, who achieved to promotion to the Mexican Primera División.

In 1957–58 the club achieved promotion after winning the season. The club did not lose in their first 18 games. The club&#x27;s promotion became official on 15 December 1957 when the club defeated Nacional 2–1 under the management of the Argentine Florencio Caffaratti. Celaya replace relegated Tampico Madero. Celaya played in Primera División de México from 1958 to 1961 and disappeared in the 1970s. After reactivation, they played in Primera División A (second level) and became a farm team of Querétaro. When this club was relegated after 2006–07 season, Celaya was absorbed and disappeared.

The club made its first division appearance on 13 July 1958 against América, losing 4–1. The first goal scored in the top division was by Felipe Negrete in a confusing play, although Mateo De la Tijera possibly should have been credited. The club struggled in its first games and did not win till round 8 when they beat Zamora 3–2. The club managed to stay in its league by just one point over last-place Cuautla. That year the club finished 13 in the league with 19 points, winning 4 games. Ranulfo &quot;Chapulin&quot; Rosas was the club&#x27;s top scorer with 8 followed by Jones and Appicciafoco with 5.

For the 1959–60 tournament the club showed little improvement, finishing 12th in the league with 12 points, leaving the relegation fight to Atletico Morelia and Zamora. Ferreyra was that year&#x27;s top scorer with 9 goals, followed by Ortiz with 8 and Cabañas with 4.

The club&#x27;s mediocre play caught up with it in the 1960–61 tournament. After finishing last with a record of 6 wins, 7 draws and 13 losses totaling 19 points it was relegated. The club had started the tournament red hot but cooled when trainer Florencio Caffaratti left, elevating Gabriel Uñate who failed to win a single game. In that relegated squad Quaglia, J. Mercado and Ismael Ferreyra were the few players who had a good year scoring 7, 5, and 4 goals in order.

===1970–1993===
The club spent the 1960s in Second division where after 10 mediocre years, the club finally folded in the 1970s. A few years later the club along with club Tecnológico de Celaya was brought back to give Celaya professional football. Club Celaya enrolled in the Tercera División de México and in the 1973–74 the club won the league. Club Celaya lost the 1975–76 Segunda División de México final to San Luis and Tecnológico de Celaya would later be relegated to Tercera División de México.

The club spent the 1980s playing on and off in the Segunda B before taking some time off and reappearing in Segunda A in 1991. From 1991 to 1993 2 clubs again represented the city; club Celaya and Linces Celaya.

===Atletico Celaya era (1994–2004)===
The club returned in 1994 when the two second-division clubs Atlético Cuernavaca (Morelos) and Escuadra Celeste de Celaya (Guanajuato) merged. Another team, Atlético Español – not to be mistaken for the same-named Mexico City team – was merged later.

All merging clubs brought a piece of their old identity into the new club: Atlético Cuernavaca offered its name; Celeste de Celaya offered their light blue colors and Atlético Español provided their mascot, the bull, engendering their nickname &quot;toros&quot; (bulls).

Atlético Celaya under Enrique Fernández Prado administration took the second-division position of their predecessors and immediately reached the top level. They joined Primera División after winning the 1994–1995 Liga de Ascenso tournament where they managed to beat Pachuca. Prior to the 1995–96 tournament the club brought in former Real Madrid greats Emilio Butragueño and Hugo Sánchez who led the club to the Final with a record of 14/10/10 for a total of 52 points, qualifying them for the quarter-finals for the first time in club history. The club defeated Monterrey in the quarter-finals, first in Monterrey, ending in a 2–2 draw, then in Celaya where the clubs again tied, 0–0. In the semi-finals they faced Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz, first in Veracruz where Celaya took a 1–0 series advantage, then in Celaya where Celaya scored 5 goals, reaching its first Final in the Mexican Primera División. In the final the club faced Necaxa, who had beaten Tigres UANL in the quarter-finals and América in the semi-finals. In the Celaya match the clubs drew at 1–1. In the following Mexico city contest they tied at 0–0. In a controversial decision the league decided not to play extra time or a penalty shootout and awarded Necaxa the title for their away goal in Celaya.

In the 1996–97 tournament the club finished last in group 4 at 5/10/2 for a total of 17 points.

Thereafter the club inhabited the lower regions. They had financial problems which led to the sale of their first-division-license in winter 2002–03. When Atlético Celaya has disappeared, their older city neighbor Club Celaya was reactivated again when La Piedad moved to Celaya. This club was made up by well-known players Mauro Néstor Gerk, Antonio Lomelí, Felipe Robles, Luis Fernando &quot;Scoponi&quot; Sandoval, Nasa, Javier Chávez González, David Pacheco and Josemir Lujambio but the club folded yet again 2004.

===Modern times===
The club once again revived in 2007 when the city and First division club Querétaro came to an agreement where Celaya would be Queretaros Primera A affiliate. The club&#x27;s first year back qualified for the play-offs, but in a controversial decision the club was eliminated by the federation for an ineligible player. The club was later sold due to the fact the Querétaro had been relegated from the first division which allowed two clubs to be operated by the same owner. The club has been playing in the Segunda División de México since 2008. In the 2010 Apertura the club defeated Tampico Madero in the final and was crowned the champion in Tamaulipas.

==Stadium==

Estadio Miguel Alemán was built and opened in 1954 in Celaya, Guanajuato. It was rebuilt 40 years later to the guidelines of the Mexican Football Federation and host to the first league meet. It was renamed in honor of President Miguel Alemán Valdés. Local teams including FC Celaya (1958–61) and Atletico Celaya Bulls (1995–02) played there.

Capacity stands at 23,182 spectators. Its design is similar to a traditional English stadium grandstand.

==Crest and colours==
The club&#x27;s original colors in the 1950s were red and white. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the club started using black and white with a topical v shape across the chest for home games and a black stripe shirt for away games, which they still use to this date.

<text>Domino Recording Company, or simply Domino, is a British independent record label based in London. There is also a wing of the label based in Brooklyn, New York that handles releases in the United States, as well as a German division called Domino Deutschland and a French division called Domino France. In addition, Stephen Pastel presides over the subsidiary label Geographic Music, which releases more &#x27;unusual&#x27; music from Britain and outside of the Western world. In 2011, the company announced that it was beginning a book publishing division, The Domino Press.

==History==
Founded in 1993 by Laurence Bell and Jacqui Rice, the label&#x27;s first release was the Sebadoh EP &quot;Rocking the Forest&quot;, licensed from Sub Pop records for release in the UK. Many of the early releases were by American artists who in the US were signed to Drag City (Smog, Will Oldham, Royal Trux), a relationship which continues to this day. Success was not immediate, as labels such as Domino, who were releasing more established American rock and unusual British music, were marginalised during the Britpop era, but a steady stream of new signings gave the label increasing credibility. Recent high-profile releases from Anna Calvi, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, and The Kills have only acted as a catalyst to this, and Domino is now one of the longest running and most successful independent record labels in the UK.

The label celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2003. There were a number of new releases, as well as a compilation album and a series of gigs in London under the &#x27;Worlds of Possibility&#x27; banner, to celebrate the label&#x27;s first decade in October of that year.

Domino celebrated their first UK #1 album in October 2005 with Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s &quot;You Could Have It So Much Better&quot;, and their first UK #1 single with Arctic Monkeys&#x27; &quot;I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor&quot; later that same month.

In 2006, Bell and co-owner, Harry Martin, founded Domino Publishing Company, a music publishing company.

In March 2021, it was announced that seminal shoegaze band My Bloody Valentine had signed with the label. This announcement was accompanied by the first ever official digital release of the band&#x27;s discography to streaming platforms. 

As well as new music, Domino have released compilations by British post-punk bands such as Orange Juice, Josef K, Fire Engines and Young Marble Giants.

<text>Lady Evelyn Barbara Balfour, (16 July 1898 – 16 January 1990) was a British farmer, educator, organic farming pioneer, and a founding figure in the organic movement. She was one of the first women to study agriculture at an English university, graduating from the institution now known as the University of Reading.

==Biography==
Balfour was born in Holland Park, London, one of the six children of Gerald, 2nd Earl of Balfour, and Lady Elizabeth Bulwer-Lytton, daughter of the 1st Earl of Lytton (former Viceroy of India). She was the niece of former prime minister Arthur J. Balfour. She decided at the age of 12 that she wanted to be a farmer. At the age of 17, she enrolled, as one of the first women students to do so, at Reading University College for the Diploma of Agriculture. After obtaining her Diploma in 1917, she completed a year&#x27;s practical farming, living in &#x27;digs&#x27; at 102 Basingstoke Road, Reading. During this time she worked at Manor Farm ploughing fields. She was subsequently appointed bailiff to a farm near Newport, Wales, under the direction of various war committees, notably the Monmouthshire Women&#x27;s War Agricultural Committee whose Chairwoman was Lady Mather Jackson of Llantilio Court, Abergavenny. 

In 1919, at the age of 21, at the suggestion of family friend William E.G. Palmer of Haughley, she and her sister Mary bought New Bells Farm in Haughley Green, Suffolk, using inheritance monies put into a trust by their father. In 1939, she launched the Haughley Experiment, the first long-term, side-by-side scientific comparison of organic and chemical-based farming. She later became Chairperson of Haughley Parish Council for many years and organised Air Raid Precautions in the village. She campaigned vigorously against the payment of tithes to the church and was in opposition to the Vicar of Haughley, the Rev Walter Grainge White. 

In 1943, leading London publishing house Faber &amp; Faber published Balfour&#x27;s book &quot;The Living Soil&quot;. Reprinted numerous times, it became a founding text of the emerging organic food and farming movement. The book synthesised existing arguments in favour of organics with a description of her plans for the Haughley Experiment.

==Soil Association ==
In 1946, Balfour co-founded and became the first president of the Soil Association, an international organisation which promotes sustainable agriculture, and became one of the UK&#x27;s main organic farming advocate. Through the introduction of the Agriculture Act 1947, the UK established its commitment towards a highly mechanised, intensive farming system, which disappointed Balfour, as it refused to offer support or funding towards organic production methods. By 1952, the Soil Association saw its membership increase to 3,000, largely owing to the dedication of a small committee, including Balfour and the publication of their journal &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, later renamed &quot;Living Earth&quot;.

In South Africa, experiments were undertaken by the Valley Trust. using Balfour&#x27;s methods in 1961 and 1962. These subsequently demonstrated that the organic approach was all that was necessary, indeed, that &quot;the people did not need chemicals, which were worse than useless on the dry soil.&quot;

==Personal life==
Balfour lived with Kathleen Carnley (1889–1976) for 50 years. Carnley joined Balfour at Haughley during the 1930s and was a skilful dairy worker. After the large farmhouse was rented out, they lived in a cottage at Haughley. Before Carnley, historians speculated about her relationship with Beryl Hearnden (1897–1978). Balfour and Carnley became friendly with Graham White and stayed with him at Bald Blair when touring Australia and New Zealand.

==Later life==
Balfour continued to farm, write and lecture for the rest of her life. A statement that &quot;Health can be as infectious as disease, growing and spreading under the right conditions&quot; is attributed to her. In 1958, she embarked on a year-long tour of Australia and New Zealand, during which she met Australian organic farming pioneers, including Henry Shoobridge, president of the Living Soil Association of Tasmania, the first organisation to affiliate with the Soil Association.

She moved to the Suffolk coast in 1963 and made regular visits back to the farm at Haughley. The farm was sold in 1970, owing to mounting debts incurred by the centre. In 1984, she retired from the Soil Association aged 85. She continued to cultivate her large garden. On 14 January 1990, she was appointed OBE in the 1990 New Year Honours list. In 1989, she had suffered a stroke from which she died in Scotland, aged 90, on 16 January 1990.

On 17 January 1990, the day after her death, the Conservative Government, under Margaret Thatcher, offered grants to encourage British farmers to change to organic methods.

<doc id="425716" wikidata="Q653122" url="?curid=425716" title="Ponytail">
<text>A ponytail is a hairstyle in which some, most, or all of the hair on the head is pulled away from the face, gathered and secured at the back of the head with a hair tie, clip, or other similar accessory and allowed to hang freely from that point. It gets its name from its resemblance to the tail of a pony.

Ponytails are most commonly gathered at the middle of the back of the head or the base of the neck but may also be worn at the side of the head (sometimes considered formal), or on the very top of the head. If the hair is divided so that it hangs in two sections, they are called &quot;ponytails&quot;, &quot;twintails&quot;, &quot;pigtails&quot;, or &quot;bunches&quot; if left loose and &quot;pigtails&quot;, &quot;plaits&quot; or &quot;braids&quot; if plaited.

== Ponytails on women and girls ==


The ponytail can be traced back to Ancient Greece, from records of images depicting women with ponytails in ancient Greek artefacts and artworks, such as the frescoes painted millennia ago in Cretes (2000–1500 BC). Hence, it is likely that the ponytail hairstyle emerged in Ancient Greece before spreading to different cultures and regions, for Egyptian and Roman art also depict women wearing hair in a style that we now call the ponytail.

In European and Western culture, it was unusual for women (as opposed to girls) to wear their hair in public in a ponytail until the mid-20th century.
The expansion in the ponytail hairstyle was in large part due to the arrival of the first Barbie doll by Mattel, which popularized the hairstyle, and movie stars like Sandra Dee who wore it in movies such as &quot;Gidget&quot;.

In the mid-1980s and through the mid-1990s it was common to see women of all ages from girls, tweens, teens, college and beyond wearing high ponytails or high side ponytails held with a scrunchie.

Today, both women and girls commonly wear their hair in ponytails in informal and office settings or when exercising with a scrunchie or tie; they are likely to choose more elaborate styles (such as braids and those involving accessories) for formal occasions. High and low ponytails are both common. Ponytails with a scrunchie are back in style and practicality as they are seen as better on the hair then traditional hair ties. The ponytail is popular with school-aged girls, partly because flowing hair is often associated with youth and because of its simplicity; a young girl is likely to be able to redo her own hair after a sports class, for example. Wearing a scrunchie with your ponytail is popular with school aged girls especially those with school uniforms as it is one piece of stylish item girls can wear as long as they conform to school colors or requirements. A ponytail can also be a fashion statement; sometimes meaning athletic; other times a low ponytail sends signals of a chic personality.

A ponytail is a practical choice as it keeps hair out of the eyes when doing many jobs or hobbies. It is not uncommon to require long hair to be tied up for safety reasons in an environment like wood shops, laboratories, sporting activities, hospitals etc., even where hair nets are not mandatory. The ponytail, particularly a low ponytail, is often the most practical way to secure the hair.

== As a male hairstyle ==


=== Historical ===
In Europe, in the second half of the 18th century (1751-1800), most men wore their hair long and tied back with a ribbon into what we would now describe as a ponytail, although it was sometimes gathered into a silk bag rather than allowed to hang freely. At that time, it was commonly known as &quot;queue&quot;, the French word for &quot;tail&quot;. The queue lost favor amongst civilians, but continued as the mandatory hairstyle for men in all European armies until the early 19th century. The British Army was the first to dispense with it, and by the end of the Napoleonic Wars most armies had changed their regulations to make short hair compulsory.

In Asia, the queue was a specifically male hairstyle worn by the Manchu people from central Manchuria and later imposed on the Han Chinese during the Qing dynasty. From 1645 until 1910, Chinese men wore this waist-length pigtail. The queue was utilised as a symbol of dominance over the Han Chinese by the Manchu people. Being a Manchu hairstyle, it was imposed on the Han Chinese to force them into submission. The queue hairstyle involves shaving the rest of the hair on the front and sides of the head, leaving a meagre portion that is tightly tied into a braid. With this hairstyle, the Han Chinese could not grow their hair naturally and freely to style them as they normally did in their own culture, and were hence denied their cultural right to grow their hair comfortably, experiencing suppression and limited agency in the rule of the Qing. Any Han Chinese man who did not wear the queue was executed by beheading. This rule of law was upheld with the exception of monks, who attended monasteries and shaved their entire heads. For this reason alone, many Han Chinese left their homes for monasteries to protect their freedom from this symbol of domination. Otherwise, those who opposed the queue were perceived as threats to Qing culture and power and were purged. Many of the officials who contributed to the enforcement of this law were Han Chinese who defected to the Qing.

The queue ended in 1910 after revolutions against the law through queue-cutting demonstrations, law revisions to make it more lax, and further queue-cutting demonstrations by Chinese influenced by Western democracy, all of which pressured reform of China&#x27;s law. Not long after, the Qing dynasty ended in 1911 or 1912.

Apart from origins in China, men in the Edo period (1683–1868) of Japan also wore short ponytails. Sumo wrestlers of Japan also wore their hair in a ponytail that is then styled in a fan shape. This hairstyle involving the ponytail continues in the culture of sumo wrestlers today.

=== Recent history ===
In the 1970s, many men wore their hair long and in ponytails. This look was popularized by 1970s-era rock musicians.

In the late 1980s, a short ponytail was seen as an impudent, edgy look for men who wanted to individualize, but keep their hair flat and functional (see mullet). Steven Seagal&#x27;s ponytail in &quot;Marked for Death&quot; is an example. (Also see &quot;Man bun&quot;).

== Scientific studies ==

The first equation of state for hair was developed by C. F. van Wyk in 1946.

Scientists in the UK have formulated a mathematical model that predicts the shape of a ponytail given the length and random curvature (or curliness) of a sample of individual hairs. The Ponytail Shape Equation provides an understanding of how a ponytail is swelled by the outward pressure which arises from interactions between the component hairs.

The researchers developed a general continuum theory for a bundle of hairs, treating each hair as an elastic filament with random intrinsic curvature. From this they created a differential equation for the shape of the bundle relating the elasticity, gravity, and orientational disorder and extracted a simple equation of state to relate the swelling pressure to the measured random curvatures of individual hairs. The equation itself is a fourth order non linear differential equation.

The Rapunzel number is a ratio used in this equation to calculate the effects of gravity on hair relative to its length.

This number determines whether a ponytail looks like a fan or whether it arcs over and becomes nearly vertical at the bottom. A short ponytail of springy hair with a low Rapunzel number, fans outward. A long ponytail with a high Rapunzel number, hangs down, as the pull of gravity overwhelms the springiness.

It is now also known why jogger&#x27;s ponytails swing side to side. An up and down motion is too unstable: a ponytail cannot sway forward and backward because the jogger&#x27;s head is in the way. Any slight jostling causes the up and down movement to become a side to side sway.

The research on the shape of the ponytail won the authors the Ig Nobel for Physics in 2012.

The Rapunzel number is important for the computer graphics and animation industry, as it helps animators resolve challenges relating to the realistic digital representation of hair and hair movement.

== Health issues ==
It is common for those who wear tight ponytails to experience traction alopecia, a form of hair loss. It has been proven that traction alopecia is highly associated with hair-pulling hairstyles, including the ponytail, and that hairstyles involving less tension are not associated with this condition. Sometimes it can cause a headache.

Additionally, people who wear ponytails may experience extracranial headaches due to tension from prolonged tying of the hairs together in a bundle, pulling at the skin of the head. The pain that results is also because the ponytail pulls at the nerves in the scalp around the face, resulting in light to serious headaches or migraines.

Loosening the ponytail may relieve pain and the headache, though the extent of this varies for different individuals.

<doc id="425717" wikidata="Q233656" url="?curid=425717" title="Angelica Singleton Van Buren">
<text>Sarah Angelica Van Buren (&quot;née&quot; Singleton; February 13, 1818 – December 29, 1877) was an American heiress and a daughter-in-law of the eighth president of the United States, Martin Van Buren. She was married to the President&#x27;s son, Abraham Van Buren II. She assumed the post of first lady because the president&#x27;s wife, Hannah Van Buren, had died and he never remarried. She is the youngest woman ever to act as the White House hostess, assuming the role at the age of 20.

==Early life==
Sarah Angelica Singleton was born in Wedgefield, South Carolina, on February 13, 1818. She was the fourth of six children born to Richard Singleton and his wife, Rebecca Travis Coles.

Angelica was educated at the Columbia Female Academy in South Carolina and Madame Grelaud&#x27;s French School in Philadelphia for five years. She was a popular student at Madame Grelaud&#x27;s and the school gave her the opportunity to meet a more diverse group of people.

==Marriage==
In the winter of 1837-38, Angelica and her sister Marion stayed in Washington, DC with United States Senator William C. Preston, a cousin of their mother Rebecca Travis Coles. Another of their mother&#x27;s cousins, former First Lady Dolley Madison, introduced the girls to Washington society. In March 1838, Madison decided to play matchmaker and introduced the girls to the bachelor sons of President Martin Van Buren. Angelica connected with the President&#x27;s son Abraham, who shortly thereafter asked her to marry him. They married at her father&#x27;s plantation in Wedgefield on November 27, 1838, Abraham&#x27;s thirty-first birthday. Although he could not attend, Van Buren was supportive of the marriage and it strengthened his ties to the Old South.

==First Lady==
Following the wedding, Van Buren assumed the duties of hostess at the White House with great success. This effectively made her the acting first lady of the United States, as her mother-in-law had died years earlier.

In 1839, the couple went to England where her uncle, Andrew Stevenson, was U.S. minister (now ambassador) to the United Kingdom. The trip, which also extended to other European countries, inspired Van Buren to introduce some European style and customs to White House functions. She also hoped to replicate the gardens of European palaces at the White House. However, these reforms were short-lived or never realized in full.

After the traditional New Year&#x27;s Day reception in 1840, Van Buren ceased hostess duties and went into seclusion due to pregnancy. In March 1840, she gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, a daughter named Rebecca; however, the child died shortly thereafter. Van Buren did not resume hostess duties after becoming pregnant a second time later that year.

The extravagancy displayed by Van Buren came amidst the prolonged Panic of 1837, which was caused in part from the policies of Van Buren and his predecessor. This eventually led to her becoming a target of her father-in-law&#x27;s reelection campaign. In 1982, the Siena College Research Institute asked historians to assess American first ladies, including &quot;acting&quot; first ladies such as Van Buren. The survey, which has been conducted periodically since, ranks first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Van Buren was ranked by historians in the 1982 survey as the 36th most highly regarded out of the 42 listed. Acting first ladies such as Van Buren have been excluded from subsequent iterations of this survey.

==Post-Van Buren presidency==
After Martin Van Buren was defeated for re-election in 1840, Angelica brought her family to Sumter, South Carolina while she was pregnant. In June 1841, she gave birth to her son Singleton (1841-1879). That Fall, the President invited the family to live at his home of Lindenwald in Kinderhook, New York. Here, Angelica oversaw the household staff and continued hostess duties as Van Buren continued to be a pivotal figure in politics. Angelica and Abraham had two more sons, Martin II (1844-1885) and Travis Coles (1848-1889); and became the guardian of her niece Mary McDuffie (1830-1874), who became close to Martin Van Buren. In 1846, Abraham returned to the military at the start of the Mexican-American War, serving until his retirement in 1854. In 1848, Abraham and Angelica moved their family to New York City, where they would reside until their deaths.

In 1853, Angelica granted refuge to her sister Marion, who was escaping an abusive husband. South Carolina law had required Marion to transfer ownership of the property and assets of her first husband to her new husband, which she attempted to regain through state courts to little success. Angelica was enraged by the decision and attempted to intervene, but found that her political connections were unwilling to help due to the tension between factions of the Democratic party. From late 1854 to 1856, Abraham and Angelica took their family on a tour of Europe. During this tour, Angelica was exposed to the conditions of poverty through literature such as &quot;Household Words&quot; and &quot;Alton Locke&quot;. Through these experiences, Van Buren became interested in social reform and charity work, which she dedicated herself to upon her return to the United States.

Martin Van Buren died of asthma on July 24, 1862, at his home in Kinderhook, New York. He was 79 years old.

Abraham Van Buren died on March 15, 1873. Angelica died five years later on December 29, 1878, and was buried alongside her husband at Woodlawn Cemetery.

<text>Polvo is an American indie rock band from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The band formed in 1990 and is fronted by guitarists/vocalists Ash Bowie and Dave Brylawski, with Steve Popson playing bass guitar and Brian Quast playing drums. Eddie Watkins was the band&#x27;s original drummer, but did not rejoin the band upon its reunion in 2008, after breaking up in 1998.

==Biography==
===Formation and early releases===
Polvo formed in 1990 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States. Their original lineup consisted of vocalists/guitarists Ash Bowie and Dave Brylawski, bassist Steve Popson, and drummer Eddie Watkins. Bowie and Brylawski met in a Spanish class at the University of North Carolina and shared an affinity for music released by SST Records and local rock band Let&#x27;s Active. Polvo&#x27;s first recording was &quot;Can I Ride&quot;, a double 7-inch single released on the band&#x27;s Kitchen Puff Records label in 1991. It was later re-released on CD as the &quot;Polvo&quot; EP on micro-indie Jesus Christ Records. The band then released two full-length albums, two EPs, and several 7-inches on Merge Records, a label run by Superchunk&#x27;s Mac McCaughan, a high-school classmate of Brylawski and Popson. Merge Records issued their debut album, &quot;Cor-Crane Secret&quot;, in 1992. &quot;Today&#x27;s Active Lifestyles&quot; followed in 1993, refining the group&#x27;s approach, and it was followed in turn by two EPs, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Celebrate the New Dark Age&quot; and 1995&#x27;s &quot;This Eclipse&quot;. &quot;Today&#x27;s Active Lifestyles&quot; was later reissued with an alternative cover without the lion image on it, because of a copyright lawsuit brought by the painter of the album.

The band also made an appearance in the 1994 cult road movie &quot;Half-Cocked&quot;.

===Wider reach, dispersion and break-up===
Polvo toured North America numerous times, including outings with Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, Pavement, Superchunk, Pipe, Sonic Youth, Unwound, Trumans Water, Sleepyhead, Trans Am, Dungbeetle, and Spatula. They toured twice in the UK and once in Europe, playing with Sebadoh, Babes in Toyland, and Superchunk.

Two albums were released after the band signed to the larger label Touch and Go Records. Their debut for the label was 1996&#x27;s double-length &quot;Exploded Drawing&quot;, an eclectic, progressive effort that began to delve more explicitly into the guitarists&#x27; fascination with Asian music. Drummer Watkins amicably left the band afterward to pursue career and family interests. The rest of the group was beginning to drift apart as well. Brylawski moved to New York City to attend graduate school and also traveled to India, while Bowie had already relocated to Boston by 1994 to join then-girlfriend, Helium frontwoman Mary Timony. Polvo reconvened in 1997 to record &quot;Shapes&quot; with new drummer Brian Walsby. Both Touch and Go releases featured a darker, more progressive rock-oriented sound instead of their earlier, post-punk influenced style. Rumors that it would be their final album proved true when they amicably disbanded later that year, ending their farewell US tour with a two-night stand at hometown club Cat&#x27;s Cradle.

===Hiatus and other projects===
In 2000 Bowie released an album of home recordings on the Tiger Style label, called &quot;Yesterday...and Tomorrow&#x27;s Shells&quot; under the name Libraness. He has since appeared with (current Polvo drummer Brian Quast&#x27;s band) the BQ&#x27;s and recorded and toured with Fan Modine. Bowie and Quast had also been working on tracks for a new Libraness album. Brylawski later played in the North Carolina–based Indonesian music-influenced band Idyll Swords, which released two albums on Communion, and currently is a member of Black Taj, as is Steve Popson. Watkins played drums in Dr. Powerful, as well as Durham outfit Stranger In The Valley of The Kings. In July 2020, Brylawski and Quast released their first album as Silver Scrolls.

===Reunion===
Polvo reformed with new drummer Brian Quast, formerly of Vanilla Trainwreck and The Cherry Valence, after being invited to appear at All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties 2008 and the Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona, Spain. They also played several shows in the US, including the Northwest Music Fest in Portland. A full live set from a benefit show at Cat&#x27;s Cradle in August 2008, featuring new songs and reworked versions of old songs, was made available to purchase online. In 2009, Polvo re-signed to Merge Records and released &quot;In Prism&quot;, their first studio album in 12 years. The album&#x27;s release coincided with Merge Records&#x27; 20th anniversary, and Polvo were featured at a concert to honor the label at the Cat&#x27;s Cradle in July. In 2010 the band toured with Versus and released their sixth album, &quot;Siberia&quot;, in 2013. The band did not undertake any promotion for its release. Polvo&#x27;s last live performance to date was in 2011.

Original drummer Eddie Watkins died on April 24, 2016, at the age of forty-seven.

In January 2020, the band announced vinyl reissues of their first 2 albums: &quot;Cor-Crane Secret&quot; and &quot;Today&#x27;s Active Lifestyles&quot;. The release was accompanied by a bundling option from Merge Records, which includes both albums with &quot;updated-but-familiar&quot; artwork (including posters &amp; other &quot;ephemera from the band&#x27;s archive&quot;) and an expanded edition of the band&#x27;s self-titled early singles compilation on translucent green vinyl. In February that year, Bowie &amp; Popson sat down for an interview with Sadie Dupuis of the band Speedy Ortiz for Talkhouse. Reflecting on their legacy, Popson said:We were just a band, one of a thousand really good bands at that time, that played shows. We were stoked that people actually liked listening to what we did. It still is shocking to me 30 years later. The reissue, I have no idea if it’s 40-year-old people, 50-year-old people restocking this stuff. Or if there are 18-year-old people out there buying it. I’d be shocked if it’s the latter. But I just don’t know.

== Musical style and influences ==
Polvo is widely considered to be a standard bearer of a genre which came to be known as math rock, although in interviews the band disavowed that categorization. Their sound was defined by complex and dissonant guitar harmonies and driving rhythm, complementing cryptic, often surrealist lyrics. Their sound was so unpredictable and angular that the band&#x27;s guitarists were often accused of failing to play with correctly tuned guitars. Polvo&#x27;s songs and artwork frequently featured Asian/&quot;exotic&quot; themes and references. Additionally, their music had a pronounced Eastern feel that came not only from the Indian and Middle Eastern-style drones in their compositions, but actual Eastern instruments like the sitar as well. &quot;Complex&quot; ranked both Bowie &amp; Brylawski among indie rock&#x27;s greatest guitarists, writing that the band &quot;built most of their songs around shimmering chords and stream-of-consciousness riffs; whistling Polvo on the bus would make someone look pretty strange. They sound as if someone stared into space and imagined the strangest guitar-based song possible and then the band tackled – and generally nailed – the unenviable task of performing it.&quot;

Across various interviews, the band members have cited &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anything&quot; by My Bloody Valentine, &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; by Hüsker Dü, Meat Puppets, Sonic Youth, early R.E.M., progressive rock bands such as Mahavishnu Orchestra, and 60s psychedelic rock as influences on their sound among others.

==Legacy==
On being asked by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; about their influence on modern bands in 2008, Ash Bowie said:I don&#x27;t really look for it, to be honest. I think we&#x27;ve had an influence, but there are other reasons why people are often found doing similar things at the same time in music, art, design, or whatever. As far as other people incorporating your style into their work, of course you&#x27;ll have mixed feelings about it, but it&#x27;s probably best to remain ambivalent about it. Anyway, I&#x27;ve always been more into music that&#x27;s completely different from Polvo, so I don&#x27;t run across it much.A wide range of bands and musicians have cited Polvo as either an influence or a favorite. They include Sadie Dupuis of Speedy Ortiz, Mary Timony, Unwound, John Dwyer of Oh Sees, Bloc Party, Mark Smith of Explosions in the Sky, Ryan Adams, St. Vincent, Les Savy Fav, Modest Mouse, Dylan Baldi of Cloud Nothings, Brand New, Kyp Malone of TV on the Radio, Johnny Jewel of Chromatics, Dry Cleaning, Conan Neutron &amp; the Secret Friends, Dogleg, Om, The Faint, Lemuria, A Minor Forest, Melissa Auf der Maur, Holy Sons, The Joggers, Leviathan, Faith Coloccia of Mamiffer, The Hair and Skin Trading Company, Alex Edkins of METZ, Pharaoh Overlord, Sean Kirkpatrick of The Paper Chase, Unwed Sailor, Posse, Sorry About Dresden, Pitchblende, Big Ups, Such Gold, Slow Mass, Tift Merritt and many others.
