<text>WGVX (105.1 MHz), WLUP (105.3 MHz) and WWWM-FM (105.7 MHz) are three separate radio stations that make up a trimulcast serving the Minneapolis-St. Paul radio market. The three stations are owned by Cumulus Media, along with sister stations KQRS-FM and KXXR. The three stations broadcast an adult contemporary radio format, with the moniker &quot;Love 105.&quot;

The studios and offices are in Southeast Minneapolis in the Como district. WGVX&#x27;s transmitter is located southeast of Apple Valley, WLUP&#x27;s transmitter is located in Cambridge, and WWWM-FM&#x27;s transmitter is located atop the IDS Center in downtown Minneapolis.

==History==

===Three signals, one station===
Prior to their unification as REV105, the three stations were known by other names.

Today&#x27;s WGVX was first licensed as KZPZ on November 15, 1990. It was officially signed on the air in late 1992 as WTCX by J. Tom Lijewski, who had previously worked at other Twin Cities stations. The station aired a Hot AC format targeting the south metro area of the Twin Cities. This was the initial FM station later purchased by Cargill Communications in 1993 to form REV105 a year later, when the call letters were changed to KREV.

WLUP is the oldest of the three stations, having signed on the air June 21, 1973 on 105.5 as KABG, with a Middle of the Road format. The call letters were changed to KXLV in 1983, and in 1991, the station increased its power, which necessitated a move to 105.3. On December 13, 1991, it became the latest of the many frequencies to use the WLOL call letters, after WLOL-FM was purchased by Minnesota Public Radio and the KSJN call letters were moved from 91.1 to 99.5 earlier that year. This longtime AC station became the northern signal of REV105, with the call letters changed to WREV in 1994.

WWWM-FM was first licensed as KOUO on March 26, 1992 to Jack Moore (creator/owner of the former Twin Cities stations WAYL (93.7 FM) and KTWN (107.9 FM)). It signed on as KCFE on March 11, 1993, airing a smooth jazz/adult album alternative format (which resembled the original format of Cities 97 from the 1980s) as &quot;Cafe 105.7&quot;. It was modeled largely on Moore&#x27;s KTWN, from the late 1970s to early 80s. The station carried Don Imus&#x27;s syndicated morning show for a short time. In October 1996, KCFE was sold to Cargill and briefly became REV105&#x27;s third transmitter, prior to all three stations being sold to ABC Radio the following March.

===REV105===
REV105, &quot;Revolution Radio,&quot; was owned by Cargill Communications, headed by Jim and Susan Cargill, heirs to the massive Cargill company fortune. It broadcast under the call signs KREV, WREV, and later KCFE on three different frequencies (105.1, 105.3 and 105.7). REV105 played a fairly wide variety of music, mostly alternative rock, and put a lot of time into promoting music from local performers. Minnesota has a very active music community, and a number of diverse artists have received national attention (see Music of Minnesota). Area high school students also contributed to some of the programming put on the air, such as the weekly &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Homeroom&quot;.

The station&#x27;s genesis came out of another station. From 1990 to 1992, KJJO (KJ104) was an adventurous modern rock station, and gained a devoted (if small) listening audience. The station switched to country music in 1992, and many held out hope that KJ104&#x27;s format would resurface soon. Two former KJ104 staffers, Brian Turner and Kevin Cole, actively sought out stations to pick up the format. On several occasions, they were turned down by previous owners of both WTCX and KCFE.

Finally, with financial backing from the Cargills, Turner and Cole found that the owner of WTCX was ready to sell. In November 1993, the Cargills purchased WTCX for $2.6 million, along with big band music-formatted KLBB for $1 million and small suburban country music outlet KBCW for $400,000. The plan was to turn the one FM and two AMs into a modern rock radio network, eventually simulcasting programming around the country. Plans eventually changed, and they decided to go with a more local approach (though REV105 did syndicate a show, Spin Radio, for a short time). Soon, the Cargills were able to purchase WLOL (located next to WTCX on the dial, but broadcasting from a location far to the north). Turner, Cole, and the Cargills were reluctant to change the big band music format on KLBB, since it did have a small, if dedicated, following, and decided not only to keep the format, but to simulcast it on their other AM signal, 1470 (105.3&#x27;s legendary call letters, WLOL, were shifted to 1470). The only other changes made to KLBB was to give it a &quot;hipper&quot; sound, incorporating more lounge music and fresher advertising and imaging. Hence, the foundation of Rev 105 was set, with KREV and WREV soon to come.

The group&#x27;s intended programming plans were public knowledge at the time and highly publicized. ABC Radio already owned classic rock KQRS-FM and felt the time was right to lay its own claim to the rapidly rising alternative rock format. On February 4, 1994, ABC agreed to purchase KQRS&#x27; main rival, KRXX, from Entercom, and KQRS management immediately took control of the station. Within two days, the former 93X became the Twin Cities&#x27; newest modern rock station, &quot;93.7 The Edge&quot;. In effect, ABC killed two birds with one stone by striking down a rival to KQRS, and warding off a potential new one. This did not change Turner&#x27;s and Cole&#x27;s plans at all, as they felt their station would be different enough to compete in the market. Pending Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval of Cargill&#x27;s own station deals, WTCX officially went off the air February 7, 1994 (coincidentally, the first full day of The Edge&#x27;s new format). WLOL followed on April 24. On May 1, REV105&#x27;s eclectic new alternative rock format took to the air, with the first official song being &quot;Crazy&quot; by Patsy Cline.

REV105 was a unique station. It would not be an ordinary, consultant-programmed modern rock station like &quot;The Edge&quot;. Rather, it took many elements from typical modern rock stations, added a heavy amount of new, obscure and local artists, and mixed in other musical styles such as industrial, punk, classic rock, hip-hop, world, dance and techno. According to Cole, when REV started, it would play the newly popular Green Day next to old Who songs, comparing and contrasting two different instances of similar music. In addition, there were a large number of specialty shows, featuring other musical styles like &quot;old school&quot; funk, imports, club mixes and ambient music. REV105 was instrumental in introducing newer artists to the airwaves, such as Ani DiFranco and Soul Coughing. As music critic Jim DeRogatis said, &quot;The brilliance of REV105 was that I would hear a set that would go Bob Marley to Nine Inch Nails to Black Sabbath. And that&#x27;s how real people listen to music.&quot;

The new &quot;Revolution Radio&quot; was a mild success, even with the high-powered competition from &quot;The Edge&quot;. In the first full ratings book, it earned a 1.5 overall Arbitron rating, and did even better in the 18-34 age breakdown. Ratings were hampered throughout the station&#x27;s history by signal reception issues, the eclectic nature of its format, and its limited budget. Signal issues were perhaps its biggest issue, as Rev&#x27;s ratings were similar or higher than any of its successor stations. The limited transmitter reach of 105.1 and 105.3 were helped when Cargill purchased another neighboring signal, KCFE, in October 1996, which improved its reach in the southwest suburbs and particularly in Minneapolis, where a large number of its listeners resided.

===Switch to X105===

REV105 enjoyed an almost three-year run, but the end came at noon on March 11, 1997, when the station was purchased by competitor Disney/Capital Cities/ABC, which already owned two powerful 100,000 watt stations in the Twin Cities, KQRS-FM and KEGE (&quot;The Edge&quot;). By 1:15 that afternoon, most of the air staff was fired, and after playing &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; by The Beatles, the station was reborn with a hard rock format as &quot;X105&quot;, with the three stations receiving the call letters KXXP, KXXU and KXXR. The first song on &quot;X105&quot; was &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; by The Scorpions.

This situation became a focal point for critics of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Fans of REV105 banded together to protest the loss of REV105, and out of this, the group Americans for Radio Diversity was formed. The purchase received fairly widespread news coverage, with articles appearing in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, where Soul Coughing frontman Mike Doughty stated, &quot;Having officially walked through every radio station in North America, I can honestly say REV was the only one that had a cause that was righteous.&quot;

Many feel that the motivation to purchase REV105 was to eliminate the competition, as ABC obtained the rights to all intellectual property of REV105, including its logos and website, and Cargill reportedly signed a non-compete agreement. The purchase was seen in some ways as a defensive maneuver against other growing radio conglomerates such as Chancellor Broadcasting, which then owned seven radio stations in the Twin Cities (eventually purchased by radio giant Clear Channel Communications in 1999). Of course, Cargill could not compete as a stand-alone owner in this environment and saw this as a perfect opportunity to sell the station. According to Cargill, &quot;As we saw all this consolidation in the market, we just didn&#x27;t feel we were going to be able to survive.&quot;

REV105 was in many ways a successor to the Twin Cities area&#x27;s original &quot;alternative&quot; station, KJJO (now KZJK), which changed its format in 1992. Kevin Cole, the former program director at REV105, and a veteran of the old KJ104, later resurfaced at KEXP in Seattle. General Manager Brian Turner eventually went back to KTCZ, where he worked in the 1980s, to host its morning show, and later worked at upstart alternative rock station KTWN. In 2005, a few former REV hosts reunited at Minnesota Public Radio for the launch of KCMP, &quot;89.3 The Current&quot;, which airs an adult album alternative format loosely inspired by REV105.

===Zone 105===
Soon after the birth of X105, a new hard rock station arrived in the Twin Cities when WBOB dropped country music and switched to a hard rock format with Howard Stern&#x27;s syndicated morning show. ABC has worked to fight off any potential competitors to its main highly rated station, KQRS-FM. At 2 p.m. on September 18, 1997, KEGE dropped its alternative format and began simulcasting on the 105s as part of a format swap (with KEGE becoming 93X once again). On September 24, after 6 days of simulcasting, the 105s became Zone 105, with an adult alternative format. After a few months, 93X took the KXXR call sign from the former X105, and the three Zone 105 stations became KZNR, KZNT and KZNZ.

After the station became Zone 105, a few of the old REV hosts were brought back. Brian Oake, who had gone over to The Edge, and Mary Lucia hosted the morning show. Lucia also hosted a weekly local music program named &quot;Popular Creeps&quot; from the local Bryant-Lake Bowl. &quot;Creeps&quot; won multiple awards for programming quality.

Over time, Zone 105 went in more of a classic alternative direction, but toward the end of its run, leaned more towards alternative rock. None of the post-REV 105 incarnations of these frequencies were true alternative rock, as the frequency had to keep a safe distance between itself and sister station 93X. For this reason, any song with a rock &quot;edge&quot; was discarded by the 105s during this time.

===V105===
On March 8, 2001, at 10 a.m., after so-so ratings as an alternative rock station, Zone 105 became V105, and flipped to rhythmic oldies. The first song as &quot;V105&quot; was &quot;Love Train&quot; by The O&#x27;Jays. The call letters were changed to WGVX, WGVY and WGVZ. V105 lasted less than a year before reverting to a revised version of the old &quot;Zone&quot; format as &quot;Drive 105&quot; on January 17, 2002.

===Drive 105===

Drive 105&#x27;s format was an adult-oriented version of the alternative rock format, and similar in many ways to the previous Zone 105. However, the fact that it was forced to distance themselves from sister station 93X by avoiding harder-edged rock meant that it played a lot of music that has more in common with the AAA format. For the better part of the last several years, the station frequently promoted &quot;This station is &quot;not&quot; owned or operated by Clear Channel Communications,&quot; though the station was actually part of another huge media conglomerate, The Walt Disney Company.

Drive 105, along with sister stations KQRS-FM and KXXR (93X), were often referred to as Disney&#x27;s &quot;Wall Of Rock&quot;. Both 93X and the 105&#x27;s are programmed with formats designed to fight competition off of Disney&#x27;s flagship in the market, top-rated KQRS. When WRQC became a rival to KQRS in 1997, the current KXXR switched to a similar format, despite a profitable alternative format already on that frequency. It is widely known in the local market that Disney would go to great lengths to protect its &quot;cash cow&quot;.

In fact, Drive 105 was in large part created to ward off competition from KTCZ (&quot;Cities 97&quot;). After the fall of Zone 105 and in the months before Drive 105 was created, Cities 97 made significant gains in the 25-54 age group. Disney saw this as a threat to KQRS and created Drive 105 originally to jab at Cities 97&#x27;s ratings. To keep a distance from sister 93X, the station targeted an older age group than most alternative stations. Like predecessor Zone 105, Drive would avoid any song that featured a significant amount of guitar distortion. When the station first began in January 2002, it aired messages such as, &quot;Remember when Cities 97 and KS95 sounded different? We do, that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re true to the music.&quot; This was a stab at Cities 97&#x27;s old slogan, &quot;true to the music,&quot; and a criticism of a recent tweak in the direction of pop-sounding KS95. During its first two years on the air, Drive 105 frequently made cracks at Cities 97. However, this came to an end after criticism from the public and as the station began to take on an identity of its own.

===Love 105===

Ratings-wise, Drive 105, like all of the previous formats, were hampered by the limited signal reach in the Twin Cities area and experienced only moderate success, usually reaching a 1% or 2% overall ratings share. Just before 3:00 p.m. on May 7, 2007, the plug was pulled on the three signals&#x27; longest-running incarnation to that point. Drive 105 played its last song, &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot; by Weezer, prior to temporarily switching over to a simulcast of sister station KXXR, in anticipation of a format flip. The flip to the Soft AC/Oldies format with the moniker &quot;Love 105&quot; happened at 5:30 the next morning, with Sonny and Cher&#x27;s &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; as the new format&#x27;s debut song.

&quot;Love 105&quot; featured mellow songs by artists including Chicago, Neil Diamond, Barbra Streisand, Sade, Bread, and many others. The playlist also initially included occasional adult standards, from the likes of Frank Sinatra and Bobby Darin, along with some more traditional oldies.

Shortly after the relaunch as Love 105, the station, along with ABC&#x27;s other non-Radio Disney and ESPN Radio stations, were acquired by Citadel Broadcasting. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.

Citadel Broadcasting would move WGVZ&#x27;s transmitter from Eden Prairie to the IDS tower in downtown Minneapolis. This significantly improved reception of the station in Minneapolis and western Saint Paul despite the drop in effective radiated power from 5,800 watts to 950 watts.

On April 13, 2012, the station transitioned to mainstream adult contemporary, dropping all pre-1970s oldies, and adding current adult contemporary fare to fill the void left by WLTE, when that station flipped to country music the previous December. In November 2012, Love 105 switched to all-Christmas music during the holidays, again filling a void created by the departure of WLTE.

On November 26, WGVY&#x27;s call letters were changed to WNSH; the call signs of WGVX and WGVZ remained unchanged. The call sign change was temporary, done to &quot;park&quot; the call letters so that they could later be used on FM 94.7 in New York City, which would use the calls to reflect its &quot;Nash FM&quot; country music franchise. On January 29, 2013, the WNSH call letters moved to New York, with the WRXP call letters parked on 105.3.

===105 The Ticket===

At 8 a.m. on March 30, 2013, a day after inadvertently releasing a new logo and identity (&quot;Radio 105&quot;) online (and after playing &quot;Some Nights&quot; by Fun and &quot;Dreams&quot; by Fleetwood Mac), the three stations dropped the AC format and began stunting with a broad range of music with no liners except for legally-mandated top-of-the-hour IDs. After stunting all weekend, on April 1 at 11 a.m., after playing &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; by Psy, the three stations dropped music altogether and became a CBS Sports Radio Network affiliate as &quot;105 The Ticket&quot;.

The station&#x27;s programming was mainly made up of nationally syndicated sports talk shows from CBS Sports Radio, including &quot;The D.A. Show&quot;, &quot;TBD in the AM&quot;, &quot;The John Feinstein Show&quot;, &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot;, &quot;The Doug Gottlieb Show&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot;, and &quot;Ferrall on the Bench&quot;.

On September 9, 2013, Mike Morris and Bob Sansevere began hosting &quot;Mike &amp; Bob Afternoons&quot; that aired from 3:00 to 6:00 pm. Morris is a former Minnesota Viking long snapper, while Sansevere is a longtime &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; columnist and former contributor to the KQ92 Morning Show.

On June 9, 2015, 105.1/105.3/105.7 dropped Sansevere, Morris, and Holsen in favor of running CBS Sports Radio around the clock. Program Director Scott Jameson told the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; that the stations would &quot;provide an alternative to the other two local (sports) stations&quot; and &quot;focus on the network product and provide it to people who prefer that.&quot; The stations retained local high school sports coverage on weekends. The change came as the stations registered just a 0.3 share in the previous three Nielsen Audio PPM ratings, well behind iHeartMedia&#x27;s KFXN-FM and Hubbard&#x27;s KSTP.

The Ticket, in an oversaturated sports talk market, did not live up to expectations, garnering less than 1.0 overall in the Arbitron ratings (with the final rating being a meager 0.1 in the July 2015 ratings).

===105 The Vibe===

On August 14, 2015, at 3 p.m., the 105 frequencies flipped to classic hip hop as “105 The Vibe”, which competed with K273BH/KTCZ-FM HD3 in the format. At the time of the launch, the Twin Cities market did not have a single commercial Urban, Urban AC or Rhythmic CHR formatted station. The only station that came close to the Urban/Rhythmic format was non-commercial KMOJ. In January 2016, KNOF flipped to KZGO with a current-based Rhythmic CHR format.

On June 22, 2016, WGVZ changed its call letters, no longer matching its simulcast partners. It is now WWWM-FM, part of a warehousing move where a co-owned station in Toledo, Ohio, changed its call letters to WQQO from WWWM-FM.

In June 2018, Cumulus Media applied to move the WLUP call letters to the WRXP signal in Minneapolis. The previous WLUP in New York state became WXMS upon acceptance of the application by the FCC. The change took effect on June 12, 2018. Cumulus had acquired the WLUP call sign earlier that year as part of its purchase of Chicago radio station WKQX from Merlin Media (whose CEO, Randy Michaels, owns the New York state station through Radioactive, LLC); the WLUP-FM call letters were formerly used on another Chicago station, WCKL, prior to its 2018 sale from Merlin Media to the Educational Media Foundation.

The ratings, however, still remained low for the trimulcast, with just an 0.8 in their last books under the format, the October 2018 Nielsen Audio ratings.

===Love 105 returns===
On November 8, 2018, at Midnight, the 105 frequencies flipped to Christmas music, reviving the &quot;Love 105&quot; branding. The relaunch was mainly because of the overall success the trimulcast had experienced during its first run under the &quot;Love 105&quot; branding and Oldies/AC format. On December 28, at Midnight, the stations officially returned to the Soft AC/Oldies format they first pioneered in 2007 by playing &quot;Yesterday Once More&quot; by The Carpenters and &quot;Love Will Keep Us Together&quot; by Captain &amp; Tennille.

By March 2023, the station&#x27;s format shifted to a soft-leaning adult contemporary, with more upbeat titles being added to the playlist.

In May 2023, the nationally syndicated Delilah began airing in weekday evenings. John Tesh&#x27;s &quot;Intelligence For Your Life&quot; show, which was previously heard in evenings, was moved to the afternoons.

In December 2023, the syndicated Bob &amp; Sheri morning show was dropped in favor of a local morning show hosted by Chris O&#x27;Connor.

===HD Radio===
In July 2019, a transmitter upgrade gave WLUP the ability to broadcast in HD Radio. WGVX and WWWM-FM do not transmit HD Radio signals. WLUP turned off its HD1 signal in early 2022.

<text>Elfyn Llwyd (born 26 September 1951) is a Welsh barrister and politician. He was the Member of Parliament for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy in the House of Commons from the 1992 general election until its abolition in 2010, and then for its principal successor constituency of Dwyfor Meirionnydd from 2010 until his retirement in 2015. Llwyd was Plaid Cymru&#x27;s Westminster parliamentary group leader.

He was announced in August 2021 as the Pro-Chancellor of Aberystwyth University.

==Biography==
Born in Betws-y-Coed, Gwynedd, Wales, Llwyd was raised in Llanrwst and later went to University of Wales, Aberystwyth, and Chester Law College.

Llwyd worked as a solicitor and subsequently a barrister (called to the bar in 1997) before election to public office. Between 1990 and 1991 he served as President of the Gwynedd Law Society. A fluent Welsh and English speaker, Llwyd is married to Welsh folk singer Eleri Llwyd, and they have two children. His hobbies include pigeon breeding, reading, travelling and rugby.

In December 2013, Llwyd appeared on a special Christmas edition of BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;University Challenge&quot; representing Aberystwyth University.

==Member of Parliament==
Llwyd was first elected to the British Parliament at the 1992, winning the Meirionnydd Nant Conwy constituency, being re-elected in 1997, 2001, and 2005. He took the newly configured Dwyfor Meirionnydd seat at the 2010 British general election with 44.3% of the vote, but there was a 7.3% swing from Plaid Cymru to the Conservatives.

He was appointed to Her Majesty&#x27;s Privy Council on 9 February 2011.

==Public service==
Having been elected to public office, his main political interests are home affairs, transport and agriculture. Llwyd credits Saunders Lewis as having most influenced his political thinking.

===Housing and language controversy===
In September 2001, Llwyd alluded to Plaid Cymru councillor Seimon Glyn&#x27;s controversial remarks about a &quot;tidal wave&quot; of English retirees emigrating to Wales and restrictions on second-home ownership proposed for Exmoor National Park when he observed that &quot;it is fine for Exmoor to defend their community but in Wales when you try to say these things it is called racist&quot;.

Glyn&#x27;s comments that English-speaking migrants were &quot;of no use to our communities&quot; had reportedly lost Plaid Cymru votes earlier in the year, and Glyn had earlier apologised for any offence caused by the &quot;out of context&quot; remarks.

Llwyd argued &quot;The language now being used in Exmoor is exactly the same issues as in Wales except that we have an added dimension in Wales of the language and the culture&quot; and called on other parties to join in a debate to &quot;talk about the Exmoor suggestion and see if we can now bring it into Wales&quot; The following spring Snowdonia National Park (Welsh: &quot;Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri&quot;) and Pembrokeshire Coast National Park (Welsh: &quot;Parc Cenedlaethol Arfordir Penfro&quot;) authorities followed the example set by Exmoor and began limiting second home ownership within the parks

===Impeach Blair campaign===
In August 2004 Llwyd joined Adam Price in a campaign to impeach then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair over the alleged misleading of the UK Parliament and for allegedly making a secret agreement with then US President George W. Bush to overthrow Saddam Hussein, amongst other charges. Llwyd and then Scottish National Party (SNP) group leader Alex Salmond co-drafted the motion.

Impeachment had not been used in the UK for one hundred and fifty years. If successful, it could have seen Blair tried before the House of Lords; however, as expected, the measure failed.

Llwyd had told the Guardian Unlimited that &quot;leading the debate on the unlawfulness of the attack on Iraq - in particular opening a debate calling for the disclosure of the attorney general&#x27;s opinion in full in March 2004,&quot; was his proudest moment.

In November 2005, the campaign announced a new motion (this time with the support of the Liberal Democrats) asking for a Commons committee to examine the conduct of ministers before and after the war. The campaign tabled an Early Day Motion :

:&quot;Conduct of Government Policy in relation to the war against Iraq&quot;

:&quot;That this House believes that there should be a select committee of 7 Members, being members of Her Majesty&#x27;s Privy Council, to review the way in which the responsibilities of Government were discharged in relation to Iraq and all matters relevant thereto, in the period leading up to military action in that country in March 2003 and in its aftermath&quot;.

The motion collected 151 signatures, including some Labour back-benchers.

By October 2006, Llwyd joined in a three-hour debate on an inquiry into the Iraq War, the first such debate in over two years. The SNP and Plaid Cymru motion proposing a committee of seven senior MPs to review &quot;the way in which the responsibilities of government were discharged in relation to Iraq&quot;, was defeated by 298 votes to 273, a Government majority of 25, but was supported by a significant number of opposition MPs, and twelve &quot;rebel&quot; Labour MPs, including Glenda Jackson.

Despite the lack of debate on the original impeachment motion, Llwyd, Price, and others pledged to continue the impeachment campaign. However, with the resignation of Blair on 27 June 2007, the entire issue of impeachment may now be moot.

===Cash-for-Honours Scandal===

In March 2007 Elfyn Llwyd was one of three individuals who made complaints about the Labour Government under section 1 of the Honours Act 1925 to the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. The other complainants were Angus MacNeill MP (Scottish National Party) and an individual who remains unidentified to this day. These three complaints led to a police investigation headed by Assistant Commissioner John Yates. The whole affair was dubbed by some in the media the Cash for Honours scandal.

===2007 Welsh Assembly election spending controversy===
Following the 2007 Welsh Assembly elections, a UK parliamentary standards and privileges committee found Plaid MPs Llwyd, Adam Price and Hywel Williams guilty of improperly advertising during the elections. Though the committee admitted the three did not break any clear rules of the UK House of Commons, the committee believed the timing of the adverts were planned to coincide with the Assembly elections.

Parliamentary funds are available for MPs to communicate with constituents regularly. However, the committee found that the three used this communication allowance improperly as part of Plaid&#x27;s campaigning during the elections as the adverts were placed in publications with a circulation outside of their respective constituencies.

Of the committee findings, Llwyd said that they would comply with the findings of the committee, but that they had &quot;...acted in good faith throughout, and fully in line with the advice that was offered to us by the DFA (Department of Finance and Administration) at the time of the publication of the reports&quot;. The three had to repay the money, about five thousand pounds each, and report the costs as part of Plaid&#x27;s election spending.

===Peerage call===
At the Llandudno party conference 2007, Llwyd encouraged the party to nominate peers into the House of Lords, citing that Plaid peers would &quot;help ensure planned legislation for Wales was not blocked at Westminster&quot;, adding that many in the Lords may want to prevent full law-making powers for Wales. In January 2011, Dafydd Wigley joined Lord Elis-Thomas in the House of Lords.

In February 2024, Llwyd was controversially overlooked for a peerage in the 2024 Special Honours in favour of Carmen Smith.

<text>Bitter Lake () is a small lake in northwest Seattle, Washington, USA.

The lake covers , with a mean depth of and a maximum depth of . Until 1913, a sawmill was located at its southwest corner. Tannic acid from logs dumped into the lake gave its water a bitter taste and the lake itself a name in English. In Lushootseed, the lake is called , meaning &quot;blackcaps on the sides,&quot; as it was a place where people historically came to collect these plants. It was also a refuge site for the Shilshole people when they experienced slave raids coming from the far north, in what is now Alaska and northern British Columbia.

It is a glacial lake with its basin having been dug 15,000 years ago by the Puget Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, which also created Lake Washington, Union, Green, and Haller Lakes.

The Seattle-to-Everett Interurban streetcar reached the lake in 1906, and the Bitter Lake neighborhood was annexed by Seattle in 1954.

The lake is situated between Greenwood Avenue North to the west, Linden Avenue North to the east, North 137th Street to the north, and North 130th Street to the south. Bitter Lake drains through a piped outlet at its southeast end that eventually flows into Lake Union.

<text>John Oldham (July 1595 – July 20, 1636) was an early Puritan settler in Massachusetts. He was a captain, merchant, and Indian trader. His death at the hands of the Indians was one of the causes of the Pequot War of 1636–37.

==Early life==
Oldham was born in Derbyshire, England, in 1595, and was baptized at the Church of All Saints (now Derby Cathedral) in Derby on July 15, 1595. He was a follower of the Puritans from an early age, and emigrated to Plymouth Colony with his sister in July 1623 aboard the &quot;Anne&quot;. His sister Lucretia Oldham Brewster was married to Jonathan Brewster, son of William Brewster, one of the signers of the Mayflower Compact.

==Banishment from Plymouth Plantation==
Some of those who sailed on the Mayflower had come for economic opportunity rather than religious motivations. In 1624, Rev. John Lyford came to America and was welcomed at first, but soon Plymouth residents gravitated to him who did not share the Puritans&#x27; viewpoints. Lyford gave them encouragement and met with them in secret. Oldham was a supporter of Lyford, and the two of them stirred up dissension and trouble in Plymouth, according to the accounts of Pilgrim leader William Bradford.

Oldham and Lyford secretly wrote letters back to England disparaging and slandering the Pilgrims. Bradford intercepted some of these letters but did not mention it immediately to Oldham or Lyford. Oldham next refused to stand his scheduled watch (a communal duty expected of all the men) and began to be insolent to the Pilgrims&#x27; military advisor Miles Standish. He then drew his knife on Standish unprovoked, and angrily denounced him as a &quot;beggarly rascal&quot;. Lyford and Oldham were put on trial for &quot;plotting against them and disturbing their peace, both in respects of their civil and church state,&quot; and they were banished from Plymouth.

==After Plymouth==
Oldham recovered and prospered from coastal trade with colonists and with the Indians. He became a representative to the General Court of Massachusetts from 1632 to 1634, and was the overseer of shot and powder for Massachusetts Bay Colony. 

As a trader, Captain Oldham sailed to Virginia and England, but by 1630 he was back in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He took up residence on an island in the Charles River and was a member of the church at Watertown. He represented Watertown in the colony&#x27;s first General Court or assembly in 1634. He continued in the Indian trade, sailing the coast from Maine to New Amsterdam.

In 1634, Oldham led a group of ten men (which included Captain Robert Seeley) along the Old Connecticut Path to establish Wethersfield, Connecticut, the first English settlement on the Connecticut River.

==Death==
On July 20, 1636, Oldham was on a voyage to trade with Indians on Block Island when Indians boarded his ship, possibly Narragansetts. The Indians killed him and five of his crew, captured his two young nephews, and looted the ship&#x27;s cargo. A fishing vessel rescued the nephews and tried to tow his sloop to port, but adverse winds affected them. They scuttled the ship but brought home the two boys.

The Narragansetts convinced the colonists that the Pequot Indians were responsible for killing Oldham. Oldham was known for his difficult ways and may have provoked the fight that killed him, but ministers across Massachusetts condemned the murders. Massachusetts Governor John Endecott was ordered to retaliate. The Bay Colony was outraged at this latest incident and sent John Endicott to Block Island.

<doc id="416934" wikidata="Q162762" url="?curid=416934" title="Indiana vesiculovirus">
<text>Indiana vesiculovirus, formerly Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV or VSV) is a virus in the family &quot;Rhabdoviridae&quot;; the well-known &quot;Rabies lyssavirus&quot; belongs to the same family. VSIV can infect insects, cattle, horses and pigs. It has particular importance to farmers in certain regions of the world where it infects cattle. This is because its clinical presentation is identical to the very important foot and mouth disease virus.

The virus is zoonotic and leads to a flu-like illness in infected humans.

It is also a common laboratory virus used to study the properties of viruses in the family &quot;Rhabdoviridae&quot;, as well as to study viral evolution.

==Properties==
&quot;Indiana vesiculovirus&quot; is the prototypic member of the genus &quot;Vesiculovirus&quot; of the family &quot;Rhabdoviridae&quot;. VSIV is an arbovirus, and its replication occurs in the cytoplasm. Natural VSIV infections encompass two steps, cytolytic infections of mammalian hosts and transmission by insects. In insects, infections are noncytolytic persistent. One confirmed vector of the virus is the phlebotomine sand fly &quot;Lutzomyia shannoni&quot;. The genome of VSIV is on a single molecule of negative-sense RNA that has 11,161 nucleotides in length, that encodes five major proteins: G protein (G), large protein (L), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N):

The VSIV G protein, aka VSVG, enables viral entry. It mediates viral attachment to an LDL receptor (LDLR) or an LDLR family member present on the host cell. Following binding, the VSIV-LDLR complex is rapidly endocytosed. It then mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. VSIV enters the cell through partially clathrin-coated vesicles; virus-containing vesicles contain more clathrin and clathrin adaptor than conventional vesicles. Virus-containing vesicles recruit components of the actin machinery for their interaction, thus inducing its own uptake. VSIV G does not follow the same path as most vesicles because transport of the G protein from the ER to the plasma membrane is interrupted by incubation at 15 °C. Under this condition, the molecules accumulate in both the ER and a subcellular vesicle fraction of low density called the lipid-rich vesicle fraction. The material in the lipid-rich vesicle fraction appears to be a post-ER intermediate in the transport process to the plasma membrane (PM). After infection, the VSIV G gene is expressed and is commonly studied as a model for &quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is translated into the rough ER where the Glc3-Man9-GlcNac2 oligosaccharide is added by a dolichol-containing protein, to an NXS motif on VSIV G. Sugars are removed gradually as the protein travels to the Golgi apparatus, and it becomes resistant to endoglycosidase H. When synthesized in polarized epithelial cells, the envelope glycoprotein VSV G is targeted to the basolateral PM. VSVG is also a common coat protein for lentiviral vector expression systems used to introduce genetic material into &quot;in vitro&quot; systems or animal models, mainly because of its extremely broad tropism.

The VSIV L protein is encoded by half the genome, and combines with the phosphoprotein to catalyze replication of the mRNA.

The VSIV M protein is encoded by an mRNA that is 831 nucleotides long and translates to a 229 amino acid-protein. The predicted M protein sequence does not contain any long hydrophobic or nonpolar domains that might promote membrane association. The protein is rich in basic amino acids and contains a highly basic amino terminal domain.

The VSV N protein is required to initiate genome synthesis.

==Vesicular stomatitis==
===Clinical signs and diagnosis===
The main sign in animals is oral disease appearing as mucosal vesicles and ulcers in the mouth, but also on the udder and around the coronary band. Animals may show systemic signs such as anorexia, lethargy and pyrexia (fever). Disease usually resolves within two weeks, and animals usually recover completely.

Cases of human infection with vesicular stomatitis virus have been described. Most of these cases have been among laboratory workers, veterinarians, and livestock handlers. In most cases, VSV infection has resulted in a short 3 to 5 day illness characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, weakness and occasionally vesicular lesions of the mouth. Serological testing is most commonly performed with an ELISA or complement fixation, and viral isolation can also be attempted.

===Treatment and control===
No specific treatment is available, but some animals may require supportive fluids or antibiotics for secondary infections.

Control relies on biosecurity protocols, quarantine, isolation and disinfection to ensure the viral disease does not enter a country or herd.

==Medical applications==

===Oncolytic therapy===
In healthy human cells the virus cannot reproduce, likely because of the interferon response, which allows the cells to adequately respond to viral infection. The same cannot be said of interferon non-responsive cancer cells, a quality which allows VSIV to grow and lyse oncogenic cells preferentially.

Recently, attenuated VSIV with a mutation in its M protein has been found to have oncolytic properties. Research is ongoing, and has shown VSIV to reduce tumor size and spread in melanoma, lung cancer, colon cancer and certain brain tumors in laboratory models of cancer.

===Anti-HIV therapy===
VSIV was modified to attack HIV-infected T-cells. The modified virus was called a &quot;trojan horse&quot; virus NIH Press Release - Trojan Horse Virus Controls HIV Infection - 09/04/1997

===Ebola vaccine===
Recombinant VSIV has undergone phase 1 trials as a vaccine for Ebola virus.

Recombinant VSIV expressing the Ebola virus glycoprotein has undergone phase III trials in Africa as a vaccine for Ebola virus disease. The vaccine was shown to be 76-100% effective in preventing Ebola virus disease. (see also rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine) In December 2019, Merck &amp; Co.&#x27;s rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine Ervebo was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat individuals 18 and older.

=== Other Uses ===
Replication competent rVSV has also been created expressing proteins of Lassa fever and Marburg virus.

==Other applications==
The VSIV G protein is routinely used in biomedical research to pseudotype retroviral and lentiviral vectors, conferring the ability to transduce a broad range of mammalian cell types with genes of interest.

The VSIV G protein has also been used in cytological studies of trafficking in the endomembrane system. Immunoelectron microscopy suggests that VSIV G protein moves from &quot;cis&quot; to &quot;trans&quot; Golgi bodies without being transported between them in vesicles, supporting the cisternal maturation model of Golgi trafficking.

VSV is often used to perform quantitative and computational studies on viral genome replication and transcription. Such studies help build a better understanding of viral behavior in the presence and absence of innate immune response.

In 2020, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, was developed based on modified VSV. The modification involved replacing the VSV&#x27;s surface protein genes with those for SARS-CoV-2&#x27;s spike proteins.

<text>CFPL-FM, branded as &quot;FM96&quot;, is a Canadian radio station owned by Corus Entertainment and based in London, Ontario. It transmits at a power of 300,000 watts on the assigned frequency of 95.9 MHz. CFPL-FM plays an alternative-leaning active rock format. CFPL-FM&#x27;s studios are located in downtown with other Corus London stations while its transmitter is located in Southwest London on the CFPL-DT tower that is also utilized by sister station CFHK-FM.

==History==
Canada&#x27;s third-oldest FM station, originally signed on in 1948 at 93.5 MHz as a simulcast station of CFPL (AM). The FM station started airing separate programming in 1949, the same year it started broadcasting at 95.9 MHz at 4,440 watts. The &quot;FPL&quot; call sign letters stand for its original owner, &quot;The&quot; &quot;London Free Press&quot; newspaper.

In 1961, CFPL-FM boosted its signal strength to 179,000 watts. During the 1960s and early 1970s, CFPL-FM broadcast classical music as an affiliate of the CBC FM network. In 1972, the station disaffiliated from the CBC, and adopted a variety format under the name &quot;Stereo 96&quot;, which included various music formats and some talk programming. In 1979, the station became known as &quot;FM96&quot; and the format changed to adult contemporary under the &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Easy&quot; moniker. CFPL had the slogan &quot;Music Above All&quot; during part of the 1980s. CFPL shifted to rock in the 1980s.

In 2006, FM96 was named Station of The Year and won the BDS Cutting Edge Award.

<text>Meirionnydd Nant Conwy was a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

The Meirionnydd Nant Conwy Welsh Assembly constituency was created with the same boundaries in 1999.

==History==
The constituency was created in 1983, largely replacing the ancient constituency of Merioneth, and was abolished in 2010. For the entire period of its existence, it was represented by Plaid Cymru, and was generally regarded as a safe seat. It had the lowest population of any constituency in England or Wales, and also had the second highest proportion of Welsh-speaking voters.

==Boundaries==
Meirionnydd Nant Conwy consisted of Merionethshire and part of the Conwy valley. This was a mainly rural area containing small towns and villages such as Dolgellau, Blaenau Ffestiniog, Bala, Betws-y-Coed, and Llanrwst.

===Boundary review===
Following its review of parliamentary representation in Wales, the Boundary Commission for Wales abolished this constituency. It was replaced mostly by Dwyfor Meirionnydd and in part by Aberconwy. These new constituencies were first fought at the 2010 general election.

==Members of Parliament==
From 1983 to 1992 the constituency was represented by Dafydd Elis Thomas of Plaid Cymru, who represented Dwyfor Meirionnydd in the Welsh Senedd and is its former Presiding Officer. The constituency was represented at its abolition by Elfyn Llwyd, also of Plaid Cymru.

<doc id="416938" wikidata="Q4905206" url="?curid=416938" title="Big Break">
<text>Big Break is a British game show that aired on BBC1 from 30 April 1991 to 10 August 2002 and was hosted by Jim Davidson with John Virgo as referee. The programme focuses on teams consisting of a contestant and a professional snooker player competing in rounds that involve snooker, with the best team eventually seeing its player seeking to win prizes for their contestant.

==History==
The idea of a snooker-related television game show was first thought of by Mike Kemp in 1984 who was also a keen snooker player around that time. He mentioned his idea to a number of friends, but the only person who was interested then and who even put a similar idea to him was mini cab driver Roger Medcalf. Kemp and Medcalf both produced a written format in 1987 where it was called &quot;Big Break&quot; and it went through a number of versions, Kemp then proposed to Medcalf that they should try to get Terry Mardell interested, Mardell was an expert in relation to quiz shows and was another one of Kemp&#x27;s friends who told him his idea of a snooker game show three years prior, which was also during that year Mardell devised a successful bingo-related quiz show called &quot;Bob&#x27;s Full House&quot;. Mardell agreed to meet Kemp and Medcalf in his office to discuss the snooker-related game that the two men came up with and showed Mardell their written format for the show, Mardell&#x27;s immediate response was that it was far too complicated, would take far too long and would cost far too much, but he was willing to help them in a further meeting that would take place in his flat where the three men would further discuss and contribute various suggestions to the idea. That meeting produced a further version of the format and afterwards Kemp was left to retype the format where it was called &quot;the June format&quot;. It was first practised at King&#x27;s Cross Snooker Club where a week later, the three men met again to work out how the game could be improved with a view to a presentation to the BBC. They attended the presentation as well as Jim Moir and Kevin Bishop from the BBC where they were sufficiently interested to agree to have rehearsals at the BBC&#x27;s Acton Studios in October.

==Format==
In each episode of the game show, three contestants are each paired up with a professional snooker player – while the contestant tackles questions given by the host, the player handles the snooker-based challenges in each round. Although a game show, Davidson and Virgo usually interject comedy into each episode, including a brief stand-up routine at the beginning of an episode before the introduction of the contestants and players. Although the first two rounds have their own rules, the last two stick to traditional regulation snooker rules regarding potting balls – colours being potted only after a red is potted – although with six red balls used in these rounds except the first round which has ten red balls. The snooker table on this game show has one colour on each pocket (Corner Pockets: Brown, Blue, Pink and Black, Central Side Pockets: Yellow and Green).

The programme features four rounds:
* Red Hot – Each contestant is given three questions, in which their answer denotes the amount of time their snooker player has to pot as many of the ten red balls on the snooker table as they possibly can. The player is allowed to break before time begins, meaning that any red balls that are potted in this period counts towards their final score. In early series, players were given 10 seconds, with each correct answer a contestant gave adding an additional 10 seconds. By later series, the format was changed, with the player having 40 seconds, minus five seconds to any incorrect answers the contestant gave. The team with the lowest score are eliminated at the end of the round.
* Virgo&#x27;s Trick Shot – A mini-game styled round, in which the contestant eliminated in the first round (Red Hot) is given the opportunity to win a consolation prize. Virgo demonstrates a type of trick shot, which the contestant must recreate themselves, in order to win the prize.
* Pocket Money – Each contestant&#x27;s player tackles a traditional game of snooker (although there are only six red balls on the table), along standard rules of potting, getting as many balls as they can within 90 seconds. Each ball on the table is denoted with both a cash amount – based on their regulation point in Snooker (i.e. Reds being one point are thus earn £10 when potted) – and a category of questions that Davidson can asks the contestants. If the player pots a ball in the same coloured pocket, the cash amount earned is doubled (i.e. potting Brown in its own colour pocket doubles the amount from £40 to £80, Blue from £50 to £100, Pink from £60 to £120 and Black from £70 to £140). If the player hits a ball but fails to pot it, they must stop and wait until their contestant answers a question correctly, based on the ball&#x27;s connected subject, in order to resume (i.e. Red questions are based on Pot Luck meaning General Knowledge, Yellow based on the Past meaning Historic events, Green based on Music including Instruments, Composers, Artists and even Albums, Brown based on Places meaning Geography, Blue based on People including with famous pet animals, Pink based on Sports including ranking and non-ranking tourneys and even Olympic and Commonwealth games and Black based on Screens meaning TV programmes, Films and even Channels), with the timer not stopped during this period. A coin toss decides which team begins first, with the team with the lowest score being eliminated at the end of the round.
* Make or Break – The final contestant is given 90 seconds to answer five questions correctly, after the player breaks the six reds on the table. Once all questions are answered, the timer is paused, with each correct answer allowing the player to remove one red ball from the table, leaving a minimum of one red left. Once their choices are made, if possible, the player begins potting balls in the remainder of the 90 seconds. Each coloured ball, when potted in order, offers the contestant a prize, with the grand prize won when the black is finally potted. However, the player must pot all the reds, before they can begin with the next colour in the sequence. If the black isn&#x27;t potted, the contestant leaves with the money earned in Pocket Money, plus the red prize, and the highest coloured prize achieved when the time ran out.

<doc id="416941" wikidata="Q313371" url="?curid=416941" title="Erich Wolfgang Korngold">
<text>Erich Wolfgang Korngold (; May 29, 1897 – November 29, 1957) was an Austrian composer and conductor, who fled Europe in the mid-1930s and later adopted US nationality. A child prodigy, he became one of the most important and influential composers in Hollywood history. He was a noted pianist and composer of classical music, along with music for Hollywood films, and the first composer of international stature to write Hollywood scores.

When he was 11, his ballet &quot;Der Schneemann&quot; (The Snowman) became a sensation in Vienna; his Second Piano Sonata, which he wrote at age 13, was played throughout Europe by Artur Schnabel. His one-act operas &quot;Violanta&quot; and &quot;Der Ring des Polykrates&quot; were premiered in Munich in 1916, conducted by Bruno Walter. At 23, his opera &quot;Die tote Stadt&quot; (The Dead City) premiered in Hamburg and Cologne. In 1921 he conducted the Hamburg Opera. During the 1920s he re-orchestrated, re-arranged and nearly re-composed several operettas by Johann Strauss II. By 1931 he was a professor of music at the Vienna State Academy.

At the request of motion picture director Max Reinhardt, and due to the rise of the Nazi regime, Korngold moved to Hollywood in 1934 to write music for films. His first was Reinhardt&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1935). He subsequently wrote scores for such films as &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935), which helped boost the career of its starring newcomer, Errol Flynn. His score for &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; (1936) won an Oscar; two years later he won another Oscar for &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938).

Korngold scored 16 Hollywood films in all, and received two more nominations for Oscars. Along with Max Steiner and Alfred Newman, he is one of the founders of film music. Although his late-Romantic style of classical composition was no longer as popular when he died in 1957, his music underwent a resurgence of interest in the 1970s beginning with the release of the RCA Red Seal album &quot;The Sea Hawk: The Classic Film Scores of Erich Wolfgang Korngold&quot; (1972). This album, produced by his son George Korngold, was hugely popular and ignited interest in his other film music (and that of other classic film composers), as well as in his concert music, which often incorporates popular themes from his film scores (an example being the Violin Concerto in D, Op. 35, which incorporates themes from four of his motion picture scores and has become part of the standard repertoire).

==Early years as prodigy==
Erich Wolfgang Korngold was born to a Jewish family in Brünn, Austria-Hungary (present-day Brno, Czech Republic). Erich was the second son of eminent music critic (Leopold) Julius Korngold (1860–1945); his older brother, (1892–1965), also became a musician. A child prodigy living in Vienna, Erich could play four-hand piano arrangements alongside his father at age five. He was also able to reproduce any melody he heard on the piano, along with playing complete and elaborate chords. By age seven, he was writing original music.

Korngold played his cantata &quot;Gold&quot; for Gustav Mahler in 1909; Mahler called him a &quot;musical genius&quot; and recommended he study with composer Alexander von Zemlinsky. Richard Strauss also spoke highly of the youth, and along with Mahler told Korngold&#x27;s father there was no benefit in having his son enroll in a music conservatory since his abilities were already years ahead of what he could learn there.

At age 11, he composed his ballet &quot;Der Schneemann&quot; (&quot;The Snowman&quot;), which became a sensation when performed at the Vienna Court Opera in 1910, including a command performance for Emperor Franz Josef. He continued composing with great success throughout his teens. At age 12, he composed a piano trio. His Piano Sonata No. 2 in E major, which followed, was played throughout Europe by Artur Schnabel. During these early years he also made live-recording player piano music rolls for the Hupfeld DEA and Phonola system and also the Aeolian Duo-Art system, which survive today and can be heard.

Korngold wrote his first orchestral score, the &quot;Schauspiel-Ouvertüre&quot;, when he was 14. His &quot;Sinfonietta&quot; appeared the following year, and his first two operas, &quot;Der Ring des Polykrates&quot; and &quot;Violanta&quot;, in 1914. In 1916, he wrote songs, chamber works, and incidental music, including to &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, which ran for some 80 performances in Vienna.

==Composing career in Europe==
Korngold was active in the theatre throughout Europe while in his 20s. After the success of his opera &quot;Die tote Stadt&quot;, which he conducted in many opera houses, he developed a passion for the music of Johann Strauss II and managed to exhume a number of lost scores. He orchestrated and staged them using new concepts. Both &quot;A Night in Venice&quot; and &quot;Cagliostro in Vienna&quot; are Korngold re-creations; these were the works that first drew the attention of Max Reinhardt to Korngold.

By this point Korngold had reached the zenith of his fame as a composer of opera and concert music. Composers such as Richard Strauss and Giacomo Puccini heaped praise upon him, and many famous conductors, soloists and singers added his works to their repertoires. He began collaborating with Reinhardt on many productions, including a collection of little-known Strauss pieces that they arranged, &quot;Waltzes From Vienna&quot;. It was retitled &quot;The Great Waltz&quot; and became the basis for a 1934 British film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and a film by the same name in the US, starring Luise Rainer. Korngold conducted staged versions in Los Angeles in 1949 and 1953.

He completed a Concerto for Piano Left Hand for pianist Paul Wittgenstein in 1923 and his fourth opera, &quot;Das Wunder der Heliane&quot;, four years later. He started arranging and conducting operettas by Johann Strauss II and others while teaching opera and composition at the Vienna Staatsakademie. Korngold was awarded the title professor &quot;honoris causa&quot; by the president of Austria.

==Composer for Hollywood films==

===&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1935)===
After Max Reinhardt&#x27;s success in producing Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; for the stage, using incidental music by Felix Mendelssohn, he invited Korngold to Hollywood in 1934 to adapt Mendelssohn&#x27;s score for his planned film version. Korngold would also enlarge and conduct the score.

The film, which was released in 1935, was a first for Warner Brothers studio in producing a film based on a 400-year-old work of literary art. The studio assigned almost every star or character actor under contract to take part in the film, with the filming taking over six months. The studio also allowed Korngold to devote more attention to the score than it had to any of its previous films; he could prerecord certain parts of the film for the benefit of actors, whom he then had act to the rhythm and tempo of the music. As a result of the score&#x27;s elaborate tailoring, the film and Korngold&#x27;s music left a strong impression on the film industry.

Korngold returned to Austria to finish &quot;Die Kathrin&quot;. He came back to Hollywood to score the film &quot;Give Us This Night&quot;, with lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II, a film which introduced mezzo-soprano Gladys Swarthout and the Polish-born tenor Jan Kiepura, who had starred in several Korngold operas in Europe.

===&quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935)===
In 1935 Warners asked Korngold if he was interested in writing an original dramatic score for &quot;Captain Blood&quot;. He at first declined, feeling that a story about pirates was outside his range of interest. However, after watching the filming, with a dynamic new star, Errol Flynn, in a heroic role alongside Olivia de Havilland, who had her debut in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, he changed his mind.

After he accepted, however, he learned that he needed to compose over an hour of symphonic music in only three weeks. The short time frame forced him to use bits of symphonic poems by Franz Liszt, and a couple of engaging cues were written by Korngold orchestrator Milan Roder. In the end, Korngold insisted he be credited only with musical adaptations, even though he scored nearly the entire film with original music.

&quot;Captain Blood&quot; became an immediate hit, with an Oscar nomination for the score. As Korngold&#x27;s first fully symphonic film score, it marked a milestone in his career, as he became the first composer of international stature to sign a contract with a film studio. It also launched the career of Flynn and gave a major boost to that of de Havilland, who did another seven movies with Flynn. Korngold scored six more films starring Flynn. In addition, &quot;Captain Blood&quot; opened the way for other costumed romantic adventures, which hadn&#x27;t been seen since the silent era.

===&quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; (1936)===
After scoring &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot;, another Warners picture, this one starring Fredric March and Olivia de Havilland, Korngold&#x27;s career in Hollywood developed quickly. He finally became convinced that dramatic scoring went well with certain types of films. The film, which is set in mid-18th century Italy, the Alps, and France, received an expensive treatment from Warners, which pleased him greatly.

Korngold was awarded his first Academy Award for the &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; score. In this film, the first half hour contains continuous scoring and proved to be a major step forward in the art of film scoring. Korngold conceived his film scores as &quot;operas without singing.&quot;

===&quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938)===
In 1938, Korngold was conducting opera in Austria when he was asked by Warner Brothers to return to Hollywood and compose a score for &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938), starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. The film, based on a largely fictional English legend, is considered the finest of its kind, with a continuous series of romantic and adventurous sequences propelled by Korngold&#x27;s dynamic score. Music historian Laurence E. MacDonald notes that there were many factors which made the film a success, including its cast, its Technicolor photography and fast-paced direction by Michael Curtiz, but &quot;most of all, there is Korngold&#x27;s glorious music.&quot; And film historian Rudy Behlmer describes Korngold&#x27;s contribution to this and his other films:
Before Korngold began composing the score, Austria was invaded by Germany and annexed by the Nazis. His home in Vienna was confiscated by the Nazis. Because all Jews in Austria were now at risk, Korngold stayed in America until the end of World War II. He later said, &quot;We thought of ourselves as Viennese; Hitler made us Jewish.&quot;

Korngold noted that the opportunity to compose the score for &quot;Robin Hood&quot; saved his life. It also gave him his second Academy Award for Best Original Score and established the symphonic style that would later be used in action films during Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age. Modern day epics such as the &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; trilogies similarly included original symphonic scores. Composer John Williams has cited Korngold as his inspiration in scoring the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series.

===&quot;Juarez&quot; (1939)===

Korngold was interested in writing a score for &quot;Juarez&quot;, as it involved historical figures from Mexico and Austria. It dealt with the Mexican politician Benito Juarez but also involved the story of Archduke Maximilian von Habsburg and his wife, Carlotta. Korngold was moved by the true-life story of how Louis Napoleon, seeing America engulfed by Civil War, took advantage of that fact and attempted, in 1864, to control Mexico. He appointed Maximilian as its emperor.

After the United States demanded that France divest itself of its interests in Mexico, the Austrian aristocrat was left to his fate, and he was executed by the Juarez government. The dramatic accent of the film leaned in favor of Maximilian and Carlotta, however, aided greatly by Korngold&#x27;s poignant themes for them.

Korngold researched the music popular in Mexico at the time and realized it was not Mexican but &quot;unmistakenly Viennese.&quot; He composed 3,000 bars of music for the score, at times emulating the rhythms of Frédéric Chopin and Franz Schubert, and the second theme of the first movement of his Violin Concerto was drawn from his work for the film. Maximilian and Carlotta loved the Mexican song &quot;La Paloma,&quot; and Korngold used it effectively during the score.

===&quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; (1939)===

Korngold was again nominated for his score of &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot;. The score is essentially operatic, with lush background music throughout, a rousing march theme for Essex (Errol Flynn), and one of his &quot;most noble and heroic melodies&quot; for 
the theme &quot;Elizabeth, The Queen&quot;, Elizabeth (Bette Davis) An hour of the hour and half long film is supported by the score, composed of rich dramatic and romantic themes.

He chose not to use any period music or to approximate 16th-century musical sounds, explaining:
The score concentrates on the regal Main Title, the triumphal entry march of Essex into London, the Queen&#x27;s theme, and the recapitulation of that theme in the End Titles.

===&quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1940)===

&quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; was Korngold&#x27;s last score for swashbuckler films, all of which had starred Errol Flynn. It is widely regarded as one of Korngold&#x27;s best. The film ran two hours and six minutes and was one of the longest films he ever worked on. It includes symphonic score in all but twenty minutes. It was also his tenth original score in less than six years.

Of the final duel between Thorpe (Errol Flynn) and Wolfingham (Henry Daniell), MacDonald states that &quot;Korngold&#x27;s breathlessly fast-paced music helps to make this one of the most exciting swordfights in cinema history&quot;, while Behlmer describes the duel scene as a &quot;&quot;tour de force&quot; of rhythmic energy and exactitude.&quot;

===&quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; (1941)===

In scoring &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot;, based on a novel by Jack London, Korngold&#x27;s film career went in a different direction. In this film, the score reflects an evil atmosphere, dark images, and the tense emotions of its crew during an unfortunate voyage. Edward G. Robinson, as Wolf Larsen, plays a tormented and brutal captain of a sealing schooner, which gets crippled by a rival ship.

To support the complex atmosphere, with its scenes of the fog-shrouded voyage, Korngold created a score that was understated, which was very different from his swashbucklers. He often used sharp brass chords with swirling configurations, along with a love theme voiced by a harmonica. Music historian Thomas S. Hischak notes some aspects of the score:
===&quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942)===

The score for &quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942) has been compared to those of films like &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot;, which also had powerful theme motifs. Those stories were based on recent best-selling novels, as was &quot;Kings Row&quot;. In this score, Korngold moved even further away from his previous romantic and swashbuckler styles. This was Korngold&#x27;s most Gothic film score, and a film which film historian Tony Thomas has called a &quot;true American classic.&quot; He adds that the score &quot;might well have been the basis for an opera or a grandly scaled symphonic poem.&quot;

The story is set in a Midwestern US town (Kings Row), where the characters portray a wide range of psychological emotions, from loves and hates, bitterness, tenderness and torment. Combined with Korngold&#x27;s score, which some claim is among his finest, the film drew an unusually high level of public interest and acclaim. Its costar, future President Ronald Reagan, considered his performance the best of his career.

The score contains a main theme which is varied throughout the film, depending on the how each scene develops. MacDonald states that the main theme is a &quot;majestic and noble melody that immediately grabs the viewer&#x27;s attention&quot; when the film begins. By using this motif, the theme connects the entire score, which often left a strong impact on viewers.

British composer Harold Truscott, for example, who saw the film when he was 28, wrote to Korngold admiring the score. He also saw the film more than thirty times just to hear the score, sometimes with his eyes completely closed. Like &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;Kings Row&quot; concludes with the main theme hymned operatically by an unseen chorus.

===Later scores: 1943–1956===
&quot;Kings Row&quot; was followed by seven film scores in four years – &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot; (1943), &quot;Between Two Worlds&quot; (1944), &quot;Devotion&quot; (1946), &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1946), &quot;&quot;Deception&quot;&quot; (1946), &quot;Escape Me Never&quot; (1947), and &quot;Adventures of Don Juan&quot; (1948) (unused score).

World War II prevented Korngold from returning to Europe. He became an American citizen in 1943 and remained in the US after retiring from film composing in 1947. 

He spent the last ten years of his life composing concert pieces, including a Violin Concerto, a Symphonic Serenade for strings, a Cello Concerto and a Symphony. The Violin Concerto has become particularly successful, with many recordings and performances following Jascha Heifetz&#x27;s initial version. 

He returned to film scoring one more time, shortly before his death, for &quot;Magic Fire&quot; (1955), a film biography of the composer Richard Wagner. He was asked to adapt the music of Wagner for most of the film, but Korngold also wrote some original music for it. He is seen during the final scenes in an unbilled cameo as the conductor Hans Richter.

At the time of his death at age 60, he was working on his sixth opera.

==Composing techniques and style==
Korngold approached his scoring theatrically, and could only write by regarding film scenarios as opera libretti. This made him prefer to write leitmotifs for each of the main characters in a film, and vary them based on the emotional level of a scene. He felt that by having &quot;musical identifications for characters, places, and even abstract ideas in a film,&quot; it would help keep characters straight in the minds of the audience. Music motifs were commonly used by other film composers during that period, including Max Steiner.

During &quot;Captain Blood&quot;, for instance, motifs were created for phases of Captain Blood&#x27;s career as a pirate, using different instrumentation. Variations of some type of brass instrument were heard, such as when the ship readies for voyage, or to lend solemnity to someone&#x27;s death. A full reiteration of the motif is reserved for a climactic battle scene. The impact of the score for &quot;Captain Blood&quot; led Gene Roddenberry, creator of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, to tell his composer to use that film as an archetypal example of the kind of sound he wanted for his series. According to Karlin and Wright in &quot;On the Track:
Korngold composed in the evenings while at the piano, as he watched scenes from the film that an assigned projectionist would run for him. He would run scenes repeatedly as he improvised the music. He would collect his ideas and concepts and later commit them to paper.

During his years scoring films, he still composed some non-film works, such as &quot;Passover Psalm&quot;, Opus 30, for chorus and orchestra (1941); &quot;Prayer&quot;, Opus 32 for chorus and orchestra (1942); and &quot;Tomorrow When You Have Gone&quot;, Opus 33, for chorus and orchestra (1942). In 1946 he composed an opera, &quot;Die stumme Serenade&quot;, which he recorded privately hoping to attract interest in making a full production. On the never-released private recording, he can be heard humming as he played the piano.

In the studio during the day, he worked with orchestrators, such as Hugo Friedhofer, with whom he would make elaborate sketches marking out exactly what he wanted. He once told Friedhofer that he felt &quot;Tosca&quot; was the best film score ever written. With the orchestra in session, Korngold would conduct.

Korngold biographer Brendan G. Carrol describes Korngold&#x27;s style and methods:

==Personal life==
In 1924, Korngold married Luzi von Sonnenthal (1900–1962), granddaughter of actor Adolf von Sonnenthal, an actress, writer, singer and pianist, with whom he had fallen in love at age 19. They had two children, Ern[e]st Werner and Georg[e] Wolfgang. Luzi&#x27;s biography of her husband was published in 1967.

In 1943, Korngold became a naturalized citizen of the United States. The year 1945 became an important turning point in his life. His father, who had never been entirely comfortable in Los Angeles, and who had never approved of Erich&#x27;s decision to work exclusively on film composition, died after a lengthy illness.

Around the same time, World War II in Europe drew to an end. At this stage in his career Korngold had grown increasingly disillusioned with Hollywood and with the kinds of pictures he was being given, and he was eager to return to writing music for the concert hall and the stage.

==Death==
Korngold lived at 9936 Toluca Lake Avenue, Toluca Lake, Los Angeles, a few blocks from Warner Brothers Studio, where he worked. In October 1956 he suffered a severe stroke and although he partially recovered, he &quot;endured many physical and emotional difficulties&quot; before his death at the age of 60, on November 29 the following year. He was survived by his wife, Luzi (Luise), two sons, George Korngold and Ernst Korngold; his mother, Josephine Korngold; a brother, Hans Robert Korngold, and three grandchildren. He was interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Despite his achievements, Korngold for years attracted little positive critical attention. In 1972, RCA Victor released an LP titled &quot;The Sea Hawk: The Classic Film Scores of Erich Wolfgang Korngold,&quot; featuring excerpts performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra. This was followed by recordings of Korngold&#x27;s operas and concert works, which led to performances of his Symphony in F-sharp major and concertos, as well as other compositions. Following the success of the Korngold album, the Classic Film Scores series was extended through thirteen additional discs, including a second Korngold collection. These records have been credited with inspiring the revival of symphonic music in films, most prominently in the Star Wars series, which features prominent allusions to Korngold&#x27;s style.

Productions of &quot;Die tote Stadt&quot; were mounted at the Vienna Volksoper in 1967 and the New York City Opera in 1975.

The American Film Institute ranked Korngold&#x27;s score for &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; as number 11 on their list of the greatest film scores. His scores for the following films were also nominated for the list:

*&quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; (1939)
*&quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1940)
*&quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942)
*&quot;Deception&quot; (1946)

Further recognition came in the 1990s; two full-scale biographies of him appeared almost simultaneously. One is Jessica Duchen&#x27;s &quot;Erich Wolfgang Korngold&quot;. The other is Brendan G. Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Erich Korngold: The Last Prodigy&quot;. Carroll is President of the International Korngold Society. Carroll released excerpts of acetates with Korngold conducting the Warner Bros. studio orchestra in music from his film scores, some possibly taken from KFWB radio broadcasts.

In 2019 the Bard Music Festival (at Bard College, New York) celebrated Korngold with an extensive series of performances and lectures and the publication of &quot;Korngold and His World,&quot; edited by Daniel Goldmark and Kevin C. Karnes. In addition, Bard sponsored the first US production of &quot;Das Wunder der Heliane&quot; — more than ninety years after its premiere.

In 2008 Gary Noland wrote a string trio &quot;Korngoldaroonie&quot; in tribute to Korngold.

<text>The Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) is a denomination of the Latter Day Saint movement headquartered in Independence, Missouri, United States. The church derives its epithet from its founder, Alpheus Cutler, a member of the Nauvoo High Council and of Joseph Smith&#x27;s Council of Fifty. Cutler justified his establishment of an independent church organization by asserting that God had &quot;rejected&quot; Smith&#x27;s organization—but not his priesthood—following Smith&#x27;s death, but that Smith had named Cutler to a singular &quot;Quorum of Seven&quot; in anticipation of this event, with a unique prerogative to reorganize the church that no one beyond this group possessed. Hence, Cutler&#x27;s organization claims to be the only legitimate Latter Day Saint church in the world today. Currently, it has only one branch, located in Independence. The Cutlerite church retains an endowment ceremony believed to date to the Nauvoo period, practices the United Order of Enoch, and accepts baptism for the dead, but not eternal marriage or polygamy.

==History==

===Alpheus Cutler===

Alpheus Cutler was a Latter Day Saint leader and contemporary of Joseph Smith who converted to Smith&#x27;s Church of Christ in January 1833, being baptized in western New York by David W. Patten. Cutler attended Smith&#x27;s School of the Prophets in Kirtland, Ohio, and assisted in the construction of the Kirtland Temple there. In 1838, during the dedication of cornerstones for the (never-built) Far West Temple, Cutler was named by Smith as &quot;chief architect and master workman of all God&#x27;s holy houses&quot;. Cutler was later appointed a member of the Nauvoo Temple construction committee, after enduring the expulsion of the Latter Day Saints from Missouri. In Nauvoo, he served on the High Council, and was named to Smith&#x27;s Council of Fifty. Prior to Smith&#x27;s murder in 1844, Cutler was called on a mission to the &quot;Lamanites&quot; (as Native Americans were often called by the Saints). However, he had not yet departed when Smith was assassinated on June 27 at the jail in Carthage, Illinois.

Smith&#x27;s death produced a profound leadership crisis in his movement, with members torn between competing claimants for Smith&#x27;s prophetic mantle. These included Smith&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve, led by Brigham Young; James Strang, a newly baptized convert; and Sidney Rigdon, who had served as Smith&#x27;s First Counselor in the First Presidency. At first, Cutler threw in his lot with the Twelve. He continued to work on the Nauvoo Temple, where he was allegedly &quot;sealed&quot; to his spouse Lois on February 14, 1846, having received his endowment on October 12, 1843, prior to Smith&#x27;s death. LDS Church records indicate that Cutler was sealed to six other women during this timeframe, but members of his church adamantly deny this or any assertion that Cutler—or Smith, for that matter—approved of or practiced plural marriage. Cutler would later insist that the temple had not been finished by the &quot;sufficient time&quot; given in the revelation authorizing its construction; this proved pivotal for his own claims to legitimacy when he chose to start his own church organization.

===Breaking with the Twelve===
When Brigham Young decided to commence the Saints&#x27; trek to the Salt Lake Valley, he appointed Cutler as Captain of &quot;Emigrating Company No. 3,&quot; one of twenty-five such travelling units into which the Mormon pioneers were organized. Cutler established Cutler&#x27;s Park, Nebraska in 1846, and was appointed presiding member of the municipal High Council on August 9 of that year. Barely one month later, he was asked to find a new location for a settlement; on September 11, he selected the site that would become Winter Quarters.

Sometime prior to 1849, Cutler made a decision to withdraw from the main church body under the Twelve, and to go his own way. In the fall of 1847, Young had sanctioned his request to conduct the mission work among the Indians to which Joseph Smith had assigned him, and Cutler had commenced his efforts with nearby tribes. All seemed well at first. However, the arrival of apostle Orson Hyde at nearby Kanesville, Iowa in early 1848 changed the situation. Cutler became the subject of lurid rumors concerning his Indian mission, with spurious reports indicating that he had been elected as the &quot;Generalissimo&quot; of a union of &quot;thirty-seven nations&quot;. Further tales of alleged disloyalty to the Twelve by Cutler among the &quot;Lamanites&quot; fueled the fire; a visit by Ezra T. Benson, George A. Smith and others to Cutler&#x27;s mission only partially calmed the situation. Although Young wrote to Cutler, offering him aid to move west, a house in Salt Lake City and a warm welcome once he arrived, the &quot;Old Fox&quot; (as Cutler was affectionately called) refused to go.

Hyde ultimately became convinced that Cutler considered himself to be a greater authority than the council over which he (Hyde) presided, and ordered his mission suspended. Insisting that Cutler had become an enemy to Young&#x27;s organization, the Kanesville High Council excommunicated him on April 20, 1851. Young labored to bring Cutler back into the fold, writing of an ardent desire to see his old friend and promising him protection against any enemies he might have in the church. Even as late as 1856, long after Cutler had founded his own organization, Young indicated to LDS Church general authorities that he would forgive everything if Cutler would only come to Utah.

===Iowa and Minnesota===
But Cutler had no intention of going to Utah. Having broken with Young&#x27;s organization, he set about creating his own. Having been forced to abandon his mission in 1851 under pressure from local Indian Agents and government authorities, Cutler and his followers relocated to Manti, Iowa, in the southwestern part of that state. On September 19, 1853, Cutler organized The Church of Jesus Christ, claiming that he had seen a special celestial sign (two crescent-moons with their backs together) which Joseph Smith had allegedly told him to wait for before commencing this &quot;reorganization&quot; of the church. From the beginning, Cutler claimed that Smith&#x27;s church had been &quot;rejected&quot; by God for its alleged &quot;trangrassions&quot;, and that only he possessed the power to reorganize it. Thus, claimed Cutler, his new organization was the sole legitimate continuance of Smith&#x27;s work.

According to Cutler, the misdeed that brought about the rejection of Smith&#x27;s church was its failure to complete the Nauvoo Temple within the &quot;sufficient time&quot; mentioned in Doctrine and Covenants 124:31-32; Smith&#x27;s church had accordingly ceased to exist as a legitimate entity. This did not mean that Smith&#x27;s restored priesthood had been withdrawn from the earth, said Cutler, for he viewed the church and the priesthood as two separate things. While the former had been rejected, said he, the latter had not, and now remained solely with him as the seventh and final member of a furtive &quot;Quorum of Seven&quot; appointed by Smith to carry on his authority independently of the rejected church. All previous members of this quorum had died or apostatized, said Cutler; hence, he and he alone possessed power to &quot;reorganize&quot; Smith&#x27;s church.

While in Manti, the Cutlerite church attained its highest membership figure: 183 persons. The church endeavored to establish a United Order in Manti, but this attempt failed. Furthermore, Manti was being visited during this period by missionaries from the Reorganized Church, a rival group that accepted the leadership of Smith&#x27;s eldest son, Joseph Smith III. Many Cutlerites chose to accept &quot;young Joseph&quot;, and joined his organization; among them was Cutler&#x27;s son, Thaddeus. On August 10, 1864, shortly after Cutler&#x27;s death, those members of his church who had remained loyal to him relocated to Clitherall and Freedhem, Minnesota, in response to an alleged vision. RLDS Church evangelists followed the Cutlerites to their new home and culled many more from their ranks, ultimately leaving Cutler&#x27;s church with a mere three elders and a few members. The remaining Cutlerites refused to give up, however, constructing a new church building in Clitherall and establishing a church corporation in 1912 to finally effect the ideals of Joseph Smith&#x27;s United Order.

===Moving to Independence and recent history===

In 1928, a portion of the Cutlerite remnant moved to Independence, where they built their present headquarters close to the Temple Lot and were gradually joined by nearly all of the other members. The Cutlerite settlement in Clitherall was ultimately abandoned, though the meetinghouse and some of the homes remain church property to this day. Schisms rent the diminutive group in 1953 and 1980; the former began as a dispute over succession in the presidency following the death of Emery Fletcher in 1953. The Minnesota congregation did not agree with the subsequent succession of Erle Whiting to the office of Church President, and selected Clyde Fletcher as their leader, instead. Fletcher&#x27;s organization, called the True Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite), remained identical to its Independence counterpart in all respects except for its leadership and ceased to exist upon Fletcher&#x27;s death in 1969, which healed the schism.

The 1980 schism came about when the church rejected the claims of former member Eugene O. Walton, who claimed to be &quot;The One Mighty and Strong&quot; prophesied by Joseph Smith. Walton left that year and founded the Restored Church of Jesus Christ, which differs substantially with its parent organization on several points of doctrine.

The Cutlerites do not conduct missionary work or actively solicit converts, because they believe that God rejected the &quot;Gentiles&quot; following the death of Joseph Smith, and thus there can be no more active missionary work among them (as is done in the LDS Church and other Latter Day Saint churches). Membership was listed at 22 in 1957, and has declined further since then. 

==Doctrines==

===Church organization===
As in most Latter Day Saint sects, Cutlerite church organization entails a presidency consisting of a prophet-president and two counselors; when a Cutlerite prophet dies, his First Counselor succeeds to his office subject to the &quot;common consent&quot; of the membership. All other offices of the Melchizedek and Aaronic priesthoods are accepted, including apostle, patriarch, high priest, elder, bishop, priest, teacher, and deacon, though not all are filled in the current organization due to its extremely small numbers. All priesthood offices in the church are limited to males.

===Priesthood and the church===
Cutlerites hold a unique view of the relationship between the priesthood and the church. They say that since the priesthood was restored to Joseph Smith in 1829, prior to his organization of the church on April 6, 1830, the priesthood &quot;can&quot; exist on earth without the church as it did between 1829 and 1830. However, the church can never exist without the priesthood—a belief held by practically all other Latter Day Saint churches today.

This idea plays a very important role in Cutlerite conceptions of the Latter Day Saint movement, especially in the period immediately prior to and following the murder of Joseph Smith. Cutlerites point to Doctrine and Covenants 124:31-32, which commands the building of a temple in Nauvoo, and also refers to a &quot;sufficient time&quot; being granted for its construction, followed by the threat of being &quot;rejected as a church, with your dead&quot; if the structure is not completed within the allotted period. While other Mormon factions interpret this passage in varying ways, Cutlerites believe it indicates that if the Nauvoo Temple was not finished within a specific time (which seems never to have been identified with any specific date), then the church organization effected by Smith on April 6, 1830 would be &quot;rejected,&quot; and thus cease to be valid in the sight of God. Since the Cutlerites assert that the Nauvoo Temple was never truly completed—an allegation contested by the LDS Church and most other Mormon factions—Cutlerites allege that the Latter Day Saint church existing from 1830 to 1844 was indeed &quot;rejected&quot; by God.

However, Cutler&#x27;s followers maintain that the demise of Smith&#x27;s church did &quot;not&quot; entail the demise of his priesthood. Foreseeing this development, the prophet had provided a means for selected priesthood holders to reorganize his church at an appropriate future time: a &quot;Quorum of Seven.&quot; Cutler stated that he was the seventh member of this order; he only identified one other alleged colleague: John Smith, uncle of Joseph Smith, who he said was the sixth. All of the others, said Cutler, had either died or apostatized (including John Smith); thus, Cutler was the only person still possessing authority from Smith to reconstitute the church. Historian D. Michael Quinn has alleged that this Quorum of Seven might have existed as a subcommittee within the Council of Fifty, but the Cutlerites have never advanced any such interpretation or otherwise addressed that particular subject.

===United Order===
Cutlerites practice the United Order. They endeavor to replicate, as far as possible, the ideal of &quot;all things common&quot; taught in the early Latter Day Saint church. This replaces the law of tithing taught by most other Mormon factions, and complete participation is required of all members. Cutlerites do not believe that Joseph Smith ever authored the 119th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which mandates tithing, claiming that it was never presented to the membership until after Smith&#x27;s death.

===Temple ordinances===
The Cutlerites are the only non-LDS Church-derived group of Latter Day Saints who practice the &quot;endowment&quot; ceremony that originated during the Nauvoo period of Mormon history. However, unlike almost all other groups that observe these ordinances, they do not require the construction of a temple edifice to perform them (though Cutlerites believe in the concept of temples). Instead, their meetinghouses are used for this purpose. These follow the pattern of the Nauvoo Temple, with a main-floor room for ordinary church services, a font beneath for baptisms of both the living and for the dead, and a second story above for the &quot;priesthood ordinances&quot;, as they term them.

As with the LDS Church ordinances, these ceremonies (and the rooms in which they are performed) are considered especially sacred, and are not open to, or shared with, the public. In contrast with the LDS Church, which allows new members to receive their endowment one year after baptism, Cutlerites generally wait many years before receiving these ordinances. The Cutlerite church also practices baptism for the dead, but not eternal marriage.

===Scriptures===
Cutlerites utilize the Inspired Version of the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the 1846 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. The latter work includes the &quot;Lectures on Faith,&quot; which Cutlerites regard as scripture, as well as the revelations on baptism for the dead. The Pearl of Great Price is not part of Cutlerite scripture, save that portion of it that forms a portion of the Inspired Version of the Bible (the Book of Moses and Joseph Smith—Matthew).

The Book of Abraham is rejected as scripture, as are the LDS Church concepts of eternal progression (whereby God was once a man, and man may become a god), plural marriage, and eternal marriage. Cutlerite concepts of the Godhead mirror those presented in the &quot;Lectures on Faith&quot;. The first vision of Joseph Smith is accepted as authentic, though none of Smith&#x27;s accounts of it are canonized as scripture. The Articles of Faith contained in the LDS Church&#x27;s Pearl of Great Price are not officially canonized, though they do reflect basic Cutlerite beliefs.

===Book of Mormon lands===
While many Latter Day Saints point to Central America as the most likely geographical location for the lands depicted in the Book of Mormon, Cutlerites insist that these were primarily in North America, particularly in the United States.

===Missionary work===
Unlike many other Latter Day Saints, Cutlerites do not engage in missionary work. Cutler taught that with the murder of Joseph Smith, the &quot;Gentiles&quot; (non-Native Americans living in America and the world) had rejected Smith&#x27;s gospel, and thus there was to be no more preaching to them. This does not mean that Cutlerites do not welcome visitors. They simply do not believe in going out to convert others; they feel that God will lead those who are truly interested to them. While Cutlerites do not discourage new members from joining them, they point out the high expectations enjoined by their ideals, and the seriousness of the baptismal commitment.

*Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) Meetinghouse, located in Clitherall, Minnesota. Another photo of the Clitherall meetinghouse. Originally built by the church in 1912, this building was used by for Clyde Fletcher&#x27;s True Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) from 1953–69, but was never the legal property of that organization. 
* Historic photos of Clitherall, Minnesota. A selection of historical and modern photographs of Clitherall, Minnesota, which was founded by the Cutlerites in 1864. The Cutlerites maintained a presence here until the early 1990s, and still own their old meetinghouse, though it is no longer used.
*Manti, Iowa. Contains information and a few modern photos of the old Cutlerite cemetery and settlement in Manti, Iowa, which was founded by Alpheus Cutler in 1851. The Cutlerites remained there until 1864, when they relocated to Clitherall, Minnesota. Also includes a map of the town.

<doc id="416945" wikidata="Q29001073" url="?curid=416945" title="Orthohantavirus">
<text>Orthohantavirus is a genus of viruses that includes all hantaviruses (family &quot;Hantaviridae&quot;) that cause disease in humans. Orthohantaviruses, hereafter referred to as hantaviruses, are naturally found primarily in rodents. In general, each hantavirus is carried by one rodent species and each rodent that carries a hantavirus carries one hantavirus species. Hantaviruses in their natural reservoirs usually cause an asymptomatic, persistent infection. In humans, however, hantaviruses cause two diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). HFRS is mainly caused by hantaviruses in Africa, Asia, and Europe, called Old World hantaviruses, and HPS is usually caused by hantaviruses in the Americas, called New World hantaviruses.

Hantaviruses are transmitted mainly through aerosols and droplets that contain rodent excretions, as well as through contaminated food, bites, and scratches. Environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity influence transmission. Human-to-human transmission does not occur. HFRS is marked by kidney disease with kidney swelling, excess protein in urine, and blood in urine. The case fatality rate of HFRS varies from less than 1% to 15% depending on the virus. A mild form of HFRS often called nephropathia epidemica is often caused by Puumala virus and Dobrava-Belgrade virus. For HPS, initial symptoms are flu-like, with fever, headache, and muscle pain, followed by sudden respiratory failure. HPS has a much higher case fatality rate than HFRS, at 30–60%. For both HFRS and HPS, illness is the result of increased vascular permeability, decreased platelet count, and overreaction of the immune system.

Individual hantavirus particles (virions) are usually spherical and vary at 70–350 nanometers in diameter. They consist of the viral RNA, which is segmented into three parts and encased in helical nucleocapsids to form three ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Attached to each RNP is a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). RNPs are surrounded by a lipid envelope that has spike proteins emanating from its surface. Each part of the viral genome is single-stranded negative-sense RNA. The segments encode one protein each: RdRp, which performs transcription and replication of the genome, a glycoprotein precursor, which is formed into surface spikes on the envelope, and the N protein, which binds to and protects viral RNA. Some hantaviruses encode on the same segment as the N protein a non-structural protein that inhibits host interferon production.

Hantavirus replication begins by attaching to the surface of cells, usually vascular endothelial cells and macrophages. They then enter the cell and form vesicles to be transferred to endosomes and lysosomes. The viral envelope fuses with the membranes of endosomes and lysosomes, which empties the viral RNPs into the host cell&#x27;s cytoplasm. RdRp then transcribes the viral genome to produce messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation by host ribosomes to produce viral proteins. RdRp also produces copies of the viral genome for progeny viruses. Old World hantavirus virions are constructed in the Golgi apparatus and obtain their envelope from the Golgi apparatus, before being transported to the cell membrane to leave the cell via exocytosis. New World hantavirus virions are constructed near the cell membrane, obtain their envelope from the cell membrane, and leave the cell by budding from its surface.

Hantaviruses were first discovered following the Korean War. During the war, HFRS was a common ailment in soldiers stationed near the Hantan river. In 1978 in South Korea, the first hantavirus was isolated, Hantaan virus, and was shown to be responsible for the outbreak during the war. Within a few years, other hantaviruses that cause HFRS were discovered throughout Eurasia. In 1982, the World Health Organization gave HFRS its name, and in 1987, hantaviruses were classified for the first time, and they collectively bear the name of Hantaan virus and the Hantan river. In 1993, an outbreak of HPS occurred in the Four Corners region in the United States, which led to the discovery of pathogenic New World hantaviruses and the second disease caused by hantaviruses. Since then, hantaviruses have been found not just in rodents but also shrews and bats.

==Disease==

Hantaviruses are sorted into Old World hantaviruses (OWHVs), which typically cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Africa, Asia, and Europe, and New World hantaviruses (NWHVs) which are associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas. The case fatality rate of HFRS ranges from less than 1% to 15%, while for HPS it is 30–60%. The severity of symptoms of HFRS varies depending on the virus: Hantaan virus causes severe HFRS, Seoul virus moderate HFRS, Puumala virus mild HFRS, and Dobrava-Belgrade virus infection varies from mild to severe depending on genotype. The mild form of HFRS caused by Puumala virus and Dobrava-Belgrade virus is often called nephropathia epidemica (NE). Repeated infections of hantaviruses have not been observed, so recovering from infection likely grants life-long immunity.

HFRS is characterized by five phases: febrile, hypotensive, low urine production (oliguria), high urine production (polyuria), and recovery. Symptoms usually occur 12–16 days after exposure to the virus. Acute kidney disease occurs with kidney swelling, excess protein in urine (proteinuria), and blood in urine (hematuria). Other symptoms include headache, lower back pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stool, the appearance of spots on the skin (petechiae), and hemorrhaging in the respiratory treact. Renal failure leads oliguria, and restoration of kidney health comes with polyuria. Recovery typically takes a few months. In more mild cases, the different phases of HFRS may be hard to distinguish, or some phases may be absent, while in more severe cases, the phases may overlap.

HPS is mainly caused by two viruses: Andes virus and Sin Nombre virus. The disease has three phases: prodromal (early), cardiopulmonary, and recovery. Symptoms occur about 1–8 weeks after exposure to the virus. Early symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, shortness of breath (dyspnea), and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). During the cardiopulmonary phase, there is elevated heart rate (tachycardia), irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), and cardiogenic shock. Pulmonary capillary leakage can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, buildup of fluids in the lungs (pulmonary edema), hypotension, and buildup of fluid in the chest cavity (pleural effusion). These symptoms can cause sudden death. After the cardiopulmonary phase is resolved, polyuria occurs while recovery takes months. While HFRS is associated with renal disease and HPS with cardiopulmonary disease, HFRS may sometimes include cardiopulmonary symptoms associated with HPS and HPS may sometimes include renal symptoms associated with HFRS.

==Transmission==

Hantaviruses that cause illness in humans are mainly transmitted by rodents. In rodents, hantaviruses usually cause an asymptomatic, persistent infection. Infected animals can spread the virus to uninfected animals through aerosols or droplets from their feces, urine, saliva, and blood, through consumption of contaminated food, from virus particles shed from skin or fur, via grooming, or through biting and scratching. Hantaviruses can also spread through the fecal-oral route and across the placenta during pregnancy from mother to child. They can survive for 10 days at room temperature, 15 days in a temperate environment, and more than 18 days at 4 degrees Celsius (39.2 degrees Fahrenheit), which aids in the transmission of the virus. Environmental conditions favorable to the reproduction and spread of rodents are known to increase disease transmission. Living in a rural environment, in unhygienic settings, and interacting with environments shared with hosts are the biggest risk factors for infection, especially people who are hikers farmers and forestry workers, as well as those in mining, the military, and zoology.

Rodents can transmit hantaviruses to humans through aerosols or droplets from the excretions and through consumption of contaminated food. Rodent bites and scratches are also an important means of transmission to humans. The prevalence of hantavirus among rodent breeders and rodent pet owners is up to 80%. In one outbreak in North America in 2017, Seoul virus infected 31 people through contact with pet rats. Andes virus has often been claimed by researchers to be the only hantavirus known to be spread from person to person, usually after coming into close contact with an infected person. It can also reportedly spread through human saliva, airborne droplets from coughing and sneezing, and to newborns through breast milk and the placenta. A 2021 systematic review, however, found human-to-human transmission of the Andes virus to not be strongly supported by evidence but nonetheless possible in limited circumstances, especially between close household contacts such as sexual partners. There is also suspicion that Puumala virus can spread from person to person through blood and platelet transfusions.

Hantaviruses that cause HFRS can be transmitted through the bites of mites and ticks. Research has also shown that pigs can be infected with Hantaan virus without severe symptoms and sows can transmit the virus to offspring through the placenta. Pig-to-human transmission may also be possible, as one swine breeder was infected with hantavirus with no contact with rodents or mites. Hantaan virus and Puumala virus have been detected in cattle, deer, and rabbits, and antibodies to Seoul virus have been detected in cats and dogs, but the role of these hosts for hantaviruses is unknown. Infection in these other animals can potentially facilitate the evolution of hantaviruses by genome reassortment. In addition to rodents, some hantaviruses are found in small insectivorous mammals, such as shrews and bats. Hantavirus antigen has also been detected in a variety of bird species, indicative of infection.

Man-made built environments are important in hantavirus transmission. Deforestation and excess agriculture may destroy rodents&#x27; natural habitat. The expansion of agricultural land is associated with a decline in predator populations, which enables hantavirus host species to use farm monocultures as nesting and foraging sites. Agricultural sites built in close proximity to rodents&#x27; natural habitats can facilitate the proliferation of rodents as they may be attracted to animal feed. Sewers and stormwater drainage systems may be inhabited by rodents, especially in areas with poor solid waste management. Maritime trade and travel have also been implicated in the spread of hantaviruses. Research results are inconsistent on whether urban living increases or decreases hantavirus incidence. Seroprevalence, which shows past infection to hantavirus, is consistently higher in occupations and areas that have greater exposure to rodents. Poor living conditions on battlefields, in military camps, and in refugee camps make soldiers and refugees at great risk of exposure as well.

==Environment==
Rodent species that carry hantaviruses inhabit a diverse range of habitats, including desert-like biomes, equatorial and tropical forests, swamps, savannas, fields, and salt marshes. The seroprevalence of hantaviruses in their host species has been observed to range from 5.9% to 38% in the Americas, and 3% to about 19% worldwide, depending on testing method and location. In some places, such as South Korea, routine trapping of wild rodents is performed to surveil hantavirus circulation. High humidity can benefit rodent populations in warm climates, where it may positively impact plant growth and thus food availability. Increased forest coverage is associated with increased hantavirus incidence, particularly in Europe.

Climate change and environmental degradation increase contact areas between rodent hosts and humans, which increases potential exposure to hantaviruses. An example of this was the 1993 Four Corners outbreak in the United States, which was immediately preceded by elevated rainfall from the 1992-1993 El Niño warming period. This caused a substantial growth in the food supply for rodents, which led to rapid growth in their population and facilitated greater spread of the hantavirus that caused that outbreak.

Rainfall is consistently associated with hantavirus incidence in various patterns. Heavy rainfall is a risk factor for outbreaks in the following months, but may negatively affect incidence by flooding rodent burrows and nests. In places that have wet and dry seasons, infections are more common in the wet season than in the dry season. Low rainfall and drought are associated with decreased incidence since such conditions result in a smaller rodent population, but displacement of rodent populations via drought or flood can lead to an increase in rodent-human interactions and infections. In Europe, however, no association between rainfall and disease incidence has been found.

Temperature has varying effects on hantavirus transmission. Higher temperatures create unfavorable environments for virus survival and decreases activity levels of Neotropic rodents, but it can cause rodents to seek shelter from heat in human settings and is beneficial for aerosol production. Lower temperature can prolong virus survival outside a host. Higher average winter temperature is associated with reduced survival of bank voles, the natural reservoir of Puumala virus, but increased survival of striped field mice in China, the natural reservoirs of Hantaan virus. Extreme temperatures, whether hot or cold, are associated with lower disease incidence.

==Genome and structure==
The genome of hantaviruses is segmented into three parts: the large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments. Each part is a single-stranded negative-sense RNA strand and consists of 10,000–15,000 nucleotides in total. The segments form into circles via non-covalent bonding of the ends of the genome. The L segment is about 6.6 kilobases (kb) in length and encodes a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which mediates transcription and replication of viral RNA. The M segment, about 3.7 kb in length, encodes a glycoprotein precursor that is co-translated and cleaved into Gn and Gc. Gn and Gc bind to cell receptors, regulate immune responses, and induce protective antibodies. The S segment is around 2.1 kb in length and encodes the nucleocapsid protein N, which binds to and protects viral RNA. An open reading frame in the N gene on the S segment of some orthohantaviruses also encodes the non-structural protein NS that inhibits interferon production in host cells. The untranslated regions at the ends of the genome are highly conserved and participate in the replication and transcription of the genome.

Individual hantavirus particles (virions) are usually spherical, but may be oval, pleomorphic, or tubular. The diameter of the virion is 70–350 nanometers (nm). The outer part of the virion is a lipid envelope that is about 5 nm thick. Embedded in the envelope are the surface spike glycoproteins Gn and Gc, which are arranged in a lattice pattern. Each surface spike is composed of a tetramer of Gn and Gc (four units each) that has four-fold rotational symmetry, and extends about 10 nm out from the envelope. Gn forms the stalk of the spike and Gc the head. Inside the envelope are helical nucleocapsids made of many copies of the nucleocapsid protein N, which are attached to the virus&#x27;s genome to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Each RNP complex has a copy of RdRp attached to it. Hantaviruses do not encode matrix proteins to assist with structuring the virion, so how surface proteins organize into a sphere with a symmetrical lattice is not yet known.

==Life cycle==

Vascular endothelial cells and macrophages are the primary cells infected by hantaviruses. Podocytes, tubular cells, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes can also be infected. Attachment and entry into the host cell is mediated by the binding of the viral glycoprotein spikes to host cell receptors, particularly β3 integrins. Decay acceleration factors, complement receptors, and, for New World hantaviruses, protocadherin-1 have also been proposed to be involved in attachment. After attachment, hantaviruses rely on several ways to enter a cell, including micropinocytosis, clathrin-independent receptor-mediated endocytosis and cholesterol- or caveolae-dependent endocytosis. Old World hantaviruses use clathrin-dependent endocytosis while New World hantaviruses use clathrin-independent endocytosis.

After entering a cell, virions form vesicles that are transported to early endosomes, then late endosomes and lysosomal compartments. A decrease in pH then causes the viral envelope to fuse with the endosome or lysosome. This fusion releases viral ribonucleoprotein complexes into the cell cytoplasm, which initiates transcription and replication by RdRp. RdRp transcribes viral -ssRNA into complementary positive-sense strands, then snatches 5′ (&quot;five prime&quot;) ends of host messenger RNA (mRNA) to prepare mRNA for translation by host ribosomes to produce viral proteins. Complementary RNA strands are also used to produce copies of the genome, which are encapsulated by N proteins to form RNPs.

During virion assembly, the glycoprotein precursor is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum into the Gn and Gc glycoproteins by host cell signal peptidases. Gn and Gc are modified by N-glycan chains, which stabilize the spike structure and assist in assembly in the Golgi apparatus for Old World hantaviruses or at the cell membrane for New World hantaviruses. Old World hantaviruses obtain their viral envelope from the Golgi apparatus and are then transported to the cell membrane in vesicles to leave the cell via exocytosis. On the other hand, New World hantavirus RNPs are transported to the cell membrane, where they bud from the surface of the cell to obtain their envelope and leave the cell.

==Evolution==
The most common form of evolution for hantaviruses is mutations through single nucleotide substitutions, insertions, and deletions. Hantaviruses are usually restricted to individual natural reservoir species and evolve alongside their hosts, but this one-species-one-hantavirus relationship is not true for all hantaviruses. The exact evolutionary history of hantaviruses is likely obscured by many instances of genome reassortment, host spillover, and host-switching. Within species, geography has affected the evolution of hantaviruses. For example, Hantaan virus and Seoul virus have both formed multiple lineages corresponding to their geographic distribution.

Because hantaviruses have segmented genomes, they are capable of genetic recombination and reassortment in which segments from different viruses can combine to form new viruses. This occurs often in nature and facilitates the adaptation of hantaviruses to multiple hosts and ecosystems. Recombination in OWHVs of the S and M segments is usually observed amongst viruses within species, but can occur between species. Reassortment in NWHVs of the S and M segments has been observed in rodents. Among Puumala viruses isolated from rodents in 2005-2009, 19.1% of them were identified as reassortments. Diploid progeny are also possible, in which virions may possess two of the same segment from two parent viruses.

==History==
Hantavirus hemorrhagic disease was likely first described in the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s Internal Canon in Imperial China during the Warring States Period of 475–221 BCE. Hantaviruses have been suggested as a cause of &quot;trench nephritis&quot; in soldiers during the US Civil War and in British soldiers in Flanders, Belgium during the First World War. The disease was also mentioned in East Asia, where it was probably endemic, and was first described scientifically in Vladivostok in 1913–1914. During the Second World War in 1942, an outbreak of disease with symptoms characteristic of hantavirus infection occurred in Salla, Eastern Lapland, Finland among German and Finnish soldiers. This outbreak was later reported in 1980 to be caused by a virus transmitted by bank voles and was named Puumala virus. Also during the war, around 10,000 Japanese soldiers stationed in Manchuria developed HFRS.

Around 3,200 cases of HFRS occurred among United Nations soldiers stationed near the Hantan river during the Korean War, where it was first identified in 1951 and named &quot;Korean hemorrhagic fever&quot; and &quot;epidemic hemorrhagic fever&quot;. After the war, in 1976 in South Korea, Ho-Wang Lee (Korean: 이호황) tested striped field mice and showed that antigens from their lungs were reactive to antibodies in sera from war survivors. In 1978, the virus was isolated for the first time and named Hantaan virus after the river. Retrospective analysis showed that Hantaan virus was responsible for the war outbreak. Other hantaviruses that caused by HFRS were then discovered throughout Eurasia. The disease had a variety of names, so in 1982, the World Health Organization officially named it &quot;hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome&quot;. In 1985, this group of viruses were named &quot;hantaviruses&quot; after Hantaan virus, and in 1987, the genus &quot;Hantavirus&quot; was established to accommodate them in the then-family &quot;Bunyaviridae&quot;.

In 1993, an outbreak of highly lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in the Four Corners region of the United States. This outbreak was determined to be caused by a hantavirus, now named Sin Nombre virus, and represented the first confirmed instance of pathogenic hantaviruses in the Americas as well as the discovery of a new type of disease caused by hantaviruses. The new disease was named &quot;hantavirus pulmonary syndrome&quot;. During subsequent years, numerous other hantaviruses were discovered in the Americas, including Andes virus, which has been claimed to be transmissible from person to person. HFRS, however, remains much more common than HPS—more than 100,000 cases of HFRS occur each year, compared to only a few hundred cases of HPS annually.

Over time, hundreds of bunyaviruses were discovered but could not be accommodated within the genera of the &quot;Bunyaviridae&quot; family. To address this, in 2017 bunyaviruses were elevated to the rank of order, &quot;Bunyavirales&quot;, and hantaviruses, along with the other bunyavirus genera, were elevated to the rank of family. Hantaviruses, also called hantavirids, now also refer to members of the family &quot;Hantaviridae&quot;. The prior genus of &quot;Hantavirus&quot; was renamed &quot;Orthohantavirus&quot; to distinguish them from members of the family, and the genus&#x27;s members are often called orthohantaviruses. In 2019, additional genera, subfamilies, and families were created to classify non-rodent hantaviruses, and in 2023 binomial nomenclature was adopted for hantaviruses.

<text>A Bartholin&#x27;s cyst occurs when a Bartholin&#x27;s gland within the labia becomes blocked. Small cysts may result in minimal or no symptoms. Larger cysts may result in swelling on one side of the vaginal opening, as well as pain during sex or walking. If the cyst becomes infected, an abscess can occur, which is typically red and very painful. If there are no symptoms, no treatment is needed. Bartholin&#x27;s cysts affect about 2% of women at some point in their life. They most commonly occur during childbearing years.

When the cyst becomes uncomfortable or painful, drainage is recommended. The preferred method is the insertion of a Word catheter for four weeks, as recurrence following simple incision and drainage is common. A surgical procedure known as marsupialization may be used or, if the problems persist, the entire gland may be removed. Removal is sometimes recommended in those older than 40 to ensure cancer is not present. Antibiotics are not generally needed to treat a Bartholin&#x27;s cyst.

The cause of a Bartholin&#x27;s cyst is unknown. An abscess results from a bacterial infection, but it is not usually a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Rarely, gonorrhea may be involved. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and examination. In women over the age of 40, a tissue biopsy is often recommended to rule out cancer.

The cyst is named after Caspar Bartholin who accurately described the glands in 1677. The underlying mechanism of the cyst was determined in 1967 by the obstetrician Samuel Buford Word.

==Signs and symptoms==

Most Bartholin&#x27;s cysts do not cause any symptoms, although some may cause pain during walking, sitting, or sexual intercourse (dyspareunia).

==Pathophysiology==
A Bartholin&#x27;s gland cyst develops when the duct that drains the gland becomes blocked. Blockage may be caused by an infection or a mucus plug. The secretions from the Bartholin&#x27;s gland are retained, forming a cyst.

==Diagnosis==
Other conditions that may present similarly include hidradenoma papilliferum, lipomas, epidermoid cysts and Skene&#x27;s duct cysts, among others conditions. In women who are more than 40 years, a biopsy may be recommended to rule out cancer.

==Treatment==
If the Bartholin&#x27;s cyst is not painful or uncomfortable, treatment may not be necessary. Small, asymptomatic cysts can be observed over time to assess their development. Sitz baths may be useful in draining minor cysts. This is a conservative treatment that involves soaking the vaginal area in a few inches of warm water. It is generally recommended to do this for ten minutes at a time, up to four times per day. This treatment can sometimes cause cysts to spontaneously drain without further intervention.

In cases that require intervention, a catheter may be placed to drain the cyst, or the cyst may be surgically opened to create a permanent pouch (marsupialization). Intervention has a success rate of 85%, regardless of the method used, to alleviate swelling and discomfort.

Catheterization is a minor procedure that can be performed locally as an outpatient procedure. A small tube with a balloon on the end (known as a Word catheter) may be inserted into the cyst. The balloon is then inflated to keep it in place. A sample of purulent discharge can be sent to a lab for culturing and a biopsy may also be done. The catheter stays in place for 2 to 4 weeks so the fluid can drain and allows a normal gland opening to form (after which the catheter is removed). The catheters do not generally impede normal activity, but sexual intercourse is generally abstained from while the catheter is in place. Catheterization may be performed multiple times if recurrence occurs. At this point, antibiotics will typically be given in addition to the catheter. Some commonly prescribed antibiotics include Doxycycline, Azithromycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, among many others. These antibiotics are chosen to ensure coverage of the most common bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus (including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), Streptococcus, and Escherichia coli. Catheterization cannot be performed in individuals with a latex allergy as the catheter used is made of latex. 

Cysts may also be opened permanently, a procedure called marsupialization. This involves opening the gland through an incision to ensure that the secretion channel remains open. If a cyst is infected, it may break open and start to heal on its own after 3 to 4 days. Non-prescription pain medication such as ibuprofen relieves pain, and a sitz bath may increase comfort and reduce pain. Warm compresses can also speed up healing. If a Bartholin gland abscess comes back several times, the gland and duct can be surgically removed. 

Bartholin&#x27;s cysts can be treated in the same way for pregnant women as non-pregnant women. The only treatment that should be used with caution in pregnant women is Bartholin gland excision (surgical removal of the gland). This is due to the increased risk for bleeding.

==Prognosis==
While Bartholin cysts can be quite painful, they are not life-threatening. New cysts cannot absolutely be prevented from forming, but surgical or laser removal of a cyst makes it less likely that a new one will form at the same site. Those with a cyst are more likely than those without a cyst to get one in the future. They can recur every few years or more frequently. 

A randomized control trial (the WoMan trial) was performed in the Netherlands and England from 2010 to 2014. Women with bartholin&#x27;s cysts were randomly assigned to receive treatment via Word catheter or marsupialization to compare rate of recurrence over a 1-year period. This trial found that recurrence rates were quite similar between the two treatments. Recurrence occurred in 12% of women in the catheter group and 10% of women in the marsupialization group. They did find that the frequency of use of analgesics was greater in the marsupialization group than the catheter group.

==Epidemiology==
Two percent of women will have a Bartholin&#x27;s gland cyst at some point in their lives. They occur at a rate of 0.55 per 1000 person-years and in women aged 35–50 years at a rate of 1.21 per 1000 person-years. The incidence of Bartholin duct cysts increases with age until menopause, and decreases thereafter. Hispanic women may be more often affected than white women and black women. The risk of developing a Bartholin&#x27;s gland cyst increases with the number of childbirths.

<doc id="416953" wikidata="Q900489" url="?curid=416953" title="Carrom">
<text>Carrom is a tabletop game of Indian origin in which players flick discs, attempting to knock them to the corners of the board. In South Asia, many clubs and cafés hold regular tournaments. Carrom is commonly played by families, including children, and at social functions. Different standards and rules exist in different areas.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;carrom&quot; probably comes from &quot;carom&quot;, which means &quot;to strike and rebound&quot;.

==History==
The game of carrom originated in India. One carrom board with its surface made of glass is still available in one of the palaces in Patiala, India. State-level competitions were being held in the different states of India during the early part of the 20th century. Serious carrom tournaments may have begun in Sri Lanka in 1935; by 1958, both India and Sri Lanka had formed official federations of carrom clubs, sponsoring tournaments and awarding prizes.

The International Carrom Federation (ICF) was formed in the year 1988 in Chennai, India. The formal rules for the Indian version of the game were published in 1988. In the same year the ICF officially codified the rules. The UKCF was formed in 1991 in London. The main work of this organisation is to promote the game of Carrom throughout the UK and ensure the participation of UK players in all major international championships.The UKCF have hosted 3 Euro cups in England and have had fantastic success in the tournament with UK players. UKCF organised national championships and league tournaments throughout the UK on annual basis.

The United States Carrom Association reports on competitions in the US and Canada and has a player ranking list as of the last tournament.

A group of Carrom enthusiasts grouped together in 2004 and established the Pakistani Carrom Federation or PCF. The PCF have worked to build clubs across Pakistan to promote and teach the game.

The German Carrom Federation was founded in 1986 with the objective of supporting and maintaining the game of Carrom. The federation oversees Germany Carrom Clubs and teams throughout Germany.

The Italian Carrom Federation was founded in 1995 by a group of Carrom enthusiasts and is responsible for the spread of the game throughout Italy. The federation is supported by a large number of volunteers who regularly run events throughout Italy to teach and educate about the game.

The Japan Carrom Federation was established in 1997. In 2001 they moved into their new headquarters in Tokyo from Hikone. Originally set up to allow players to compete in overseas tournament but held their first national championship in 2004 and now hold tournaments, demonstrations and training camps across Japan.

The board and pieces can be bought in Europe, North America or Australia and are usually imported from India. The most expensive boards are made to a high standard with high quality wood and decorations though cheaper boards are available. Some of the largest exporters of carrom boards are in India, e.g. Precise, Surco, Syndicate Sports and Paul Traders.

==Equipment==
The game is usually played on a square board made of plywood, with a pocket in each corner. The International Carrom Federation says that the square playing surface must be between exactly along each side, that the edges be bounded by bumpers of wood, and the underside of each pocket be covered by a net capable of holding at least 10 carrom pieces.

===Carrom men===
Carrom is played using small disks of wood or plastic known as &quot;carrom men&quot; (sometimes abbreviated CM, c.m. c/m, etc.). These pieces, aside from the special &quot;queen&quot;, may also be known as &quot;seeds&quot;, &quot;coins&quot;, &quot;pawns&quot; (as in chess), or &quot;pucks&quot;. Carrom men are designed to slide when struck and are made with a smooth surface that slides easily when laid flat on the board. They are struck by a &quot;Striker&quot; of a standard specification which is larger and heavier. Carrom follows similar &quot;strike and pocket&quot; games, like pool, with its use of rebounds, angles, and obstruction of opponent&#x27;s carrom pieces.

A carrom set contains 19 pieces (striker not included) in three distinct colours: 9 white carrom men, 9 black carrom men and 1 red queen.

ICF-approved pieces must have a diameter of no more than 3.18 cm and no less than 3.02 cm. The pieces must be between 7 and 9 mm thick. The pieces have a plain, rounded edge. The mass of the pieces must be between 5.0 and 5.5 g.

===Strikers===

Striker pieces are used to hit the carrom men and the queen across the board to the pockets. The carrom striker normally weighs 15 grams of size 4.1 cm diameter.

===Queen===

The red disk is called the queen; it is the most valuable piece. During board setup, it is placed at the centre of the circle. In accordance with the ICF rules, pocketing the queen adds 3 points to the player&#x27;s total score. The dimensions of the queen must be the same as those of other carrom men.
* The player must pocket the queen and subsequently pocket a carrom man of the player&#x27;s own colour. This is termed &quot;covering the queen&quot;. If by mistake, a player puts a carrom man of the opposite team in the pocket after &quot;pocketing&quot; the queen, then the queen has to be placed in the centre of the board again.
* If the player fails to pocket a subsequent carrom man, the queen is replaced at the centre of the board.
* If the player pockets their opponent&#x27;s last carrom man before pocketing the queen, then it&#x27;s a foul.
* If a player puts the queen and a carrom man of the player&#x27;s own colour in the pocket with one use of the striker, the queen is automatically covered, but it does not matter which went first.

===Powder===
Fine-grained powder is used on the board to enable the pieces to slide easier. Boric acid powder is the most commonly used for this purpose.

In the UK, many players use a version of anti-set-off spray powder from the printing industry which has specific electrostatic properties with particles of 50 micrometres in diameter. The powder is made from pure, food-grade vegetable starch.

==Standardised rules and regulations==

The ICF promulgates International Rules of Carrom (also termed &quot;The Laws of Carrom&quot;). ICF acts as the governing body of carrom. The organisation also ranks players, sanctions tournaments and presents awards. ICF has many national affiliates such as the All-India Carrom Federation, Australian Carrom Federation, and United States Carrom Association.

===Toss===
Order of play is determined by the process of &quot;calling the carrom men&quot; or &quot;the toss.” Before commencing each match, an umpire hides one black carrom man in one hand and one white carrom man on the other hand. The players guess which colour carrom men is being held in each hand. The player who guesses correctly wins the toss.

The winner of the toss strikes first, which is called the opening break. The winner of the toss has the option to change sides from white to black and give up the opening break. The winner of the toss may not pass this decision to the other player. If the winner of the toss chooses to change sides then the loser must strike first.

The player taking the first shot (or break) plays white carrom men. The opponent plays black.
If that player cannot score any points then that player loses the turn and their opponent can choose to play any carrom man, Black or White in favour.

===Shooting===

A successful pot entitles the player to shoot again. This means that, as in pool and snooker, it is possible for a player to pot all his/her pieces and cover the queen from the start of the game without the opponent being given the chance to shoot.

Any player pocketing the queen is required to &quot;cover it&quot; immediately by pocketing one of their carrom men on the entitlement shot. If after potting the queen the player fails to &quot;cover it&quot;, then the queen is returned to the center of the table. It is illegal to pot the Queen after the last piece since the queen must always be &quot;covered&quot;.

Thumbing is allowed by International Carrom Federation which allows the player to shoot with any finger including the thumb (known as &quot;thumbing&quot;, &quot;thumbshot&quot;, or &quot;thumb hit&quot;).

Crossing the diagonal lines on the board by coming in touch with it, pocketing the striker is a foul. A player needs to ensure that his striking hand does not infringe/cross the diagonal lines aerially/physically. A player committing a foul must return one carrom man that was already pocketed.

If a player pockets his striker, he has to pay a penalty. This penalty is usually 10 points.

==Variations==

===Professional===
* Each team or player is assigned a colour and can only pocket that colour of carrom men.
* Pocketing the queen must be followed by pocketing another coin on the consecutive strike.
* The queen can only be pocketed if the player has already pocketed a carrom man but has not yet pocketed the last carrom man of the player&#x27;s colour as a carrom man must be pocketed to cover it.
* Once the queen is covered, whoever clears all their carrom men first wins the board.
* Queen and cover can not be pocketed in the same strike, irrespective of the order they enter the pocket.
* The winner of a board collects one point for each of the opponent&#x27;s carrom men left at the finish and three points for the queen if covered by the winner (if covered by the loser, no-one gets those points). No more points are collected for the queen after your score reaches 21.
* A game consists of 25 points.
* When placing the striker on the board to shoot, it must touch both baselines, either covering the end circle completely or not touching it at all. The striker may not touch the diagonal arrow line.
* Shooting styles can vary between players, but all shots must involve flicking the striker and not pushing it. While players may orient their bodies for aiming, they must remain seated for the shot.
* Carrom men can be struck directly only if they are not touching the player&#x27;s baseline or situated behind the baseline. According to the new rule, if the carrom man is behind the baseline, the player can directly hit the carrom man by the carrom striker unlike before we have to strike the carrom men off any side of the carrom board or any other carrom piece on the board but not directly.
* Sinking the striker incurs a penalty of one piece and a loss of turn. If a piece is pocketed in the same shot as the striker that piece is also removed. These pieces are returned to the board in the center circle. If the striker is sunk before any of a player&#x27;s carrom men, that player must later return a carrom man after sinking to make up for the deficit.
* If while the queen and a carrom man are sunk on the same shot, the queen is not considered covered regardless of the order that the pieces entered the pocket.
* If a piece jumps off the board, it is placed on the center spot. If pieces land on end or are overlapping, they are left that way.
* If the center spot is partially covered when replacing the queen or a jumped piece, the piece should cover as much red as possible. If totally covered, the piece is placed opposite the next player behind the red spot.
* One can touch any coin. However, if the player touches their last piece directly before the queen, penalty will be imposed.
* If a player sinks an opponent&#x27;s piece, that player loses a turn. If a player sinks an opponent&#x27;s last carrom piece they lose the board and three points are deducted from their score.
* If a player sinks their last piece before the queen, they lose the board, three points and one point for each of their opponent&#x27;s pieces left.
* If the striker does not leave both lines, the player has another chance. After three tries without leaving the lines the player loses their turn.
* These rules are mostly played in the UK, Sri Lanka, and India.

===Point===

Point carrom is a variant that is popular with children or an odd number of players. Each player is allowed to pocket carrom men of any colour.
* Carrom men of either colour are assigned 1 point each.
* The queen gives 5 points.
* The black gives 1 points.
* The white gives 2 points.
* To get queen points, one needs to put a carrom man of any colour in the same pocket after the queen on the same or a subsequent strike in the same turn. If the player fails to &quot;cover&quot; the queen in this fashion, the queen is put back in the center of the board.
* The first player to reach 25 points is declared the winner.
* If no player reaches 25 points, the player with the highest points is declared the winner. If the scores are tied, a tie-breaker must be played. Players who are tied select a colour and are only allowed to pocket carrom men of the other colour on the rebound.

===Family-point===

Family-point carrom (also known as simple-point carrom) is an informal variant suitable for an odd number of players. Each player is allowed to pocket carrom men of any colour.
* Typically, a black carrom man scores 10 points, and a white scores 20 points
* The queen scores 50 points.
* As in point carrom, the queen must be &quot;covered&quot; pocketing another carrom man in the same pocket on the same or subsequent strike in one&#x27;s turn.
* With the points system, if one team/player gets queen points early in the game, the opponent still has a good chance to win by earning more points.
* This style of play is widely accepted in many areas of South-East Asia.

===Total-point===

* The black carrom men are worth 1, 5, or 10 point(s) and the white ones are worth 2, 10, or 20 points (depending on exact game variant).
* The queen is assigned 5 or 50 points. As in the above two variants, it must have a carrom man pocketed after it.
* To win, a player must receive all the carrom men on the board.
* After the first round, the player or team with the lowest score puts all their carrom men in the center.
* The others must match this score in the center and the players play for the carrom men in the center.
* They repeat this until one team or player has all the carrom men.
* This style of play is widely accepted in many areas of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.

==Board variations==
Carrom boards are available in various board sizes and corner-pocket sizes. There are smaller boards and boards with larger pockets. Boards with larger pockets are used by beginners for easier gameplay. On traditional carrom boards, the corner pockets are only slightly larger than the carrom men, but smaller than the striker. On boards with larger pockets, it is possible to pocket the striker, resulting in a &quot;&quot; as in pool. This results in a &quot;due&quot;. On a due, the player has to return one previously pocketed carrom man to the board. The standardised association and federation size is a 74 × 74 cm (29 × 29 inch) square playing surface with 5–10 cm (2–4 in) borders. Other play-area sizes are not used in tournaments and competitions.

===Pakistani &quot;carrom&quot;===
A variant of the game called &quot;duboo&quot; is played mostly in Karachi, the largest city of Pakistan. In , the size of the board is larger(2.50 x 2.50 feet) and the striker is slid instead of flicked.

===North American carrom===

North American carrom, played primarily in Canada and the northern United States, is a variant developed around 1890 by Christian missionaries to Asia, who brought the game back with them. Concerned with young boys loitering around pool halls (where gambling was common), an American Sunday school teacher named Henry L. Haskell altered the game for Western tastes. Much of the game is the same, but the striker&#x27;s weight is reduced and the carrom men are smaller. Generally, instead of disks, carrom men (including the striker) are rings, originally of wood but today commercially made of light plastic. In addition, as an alternative to using the fingers to flick the striker, some of the American carrom boards use miniature cue sticks. American carrom boards also have built into the corners, rather than circular holes in the board, to make pocketing easier. While traditionally made boards vary widely, current commercially produced American carrom boards, by the Carrom Company of Michigan, are squares measuring 28 inches (71 cm) to a side, are printed with checkerboard and backgammon patterns, among others, and are sold with dice, skittles, etc. to allow other games to be played on the same board. These boards may also be printed on the reverse with the circular pattern for playing crokinole.

===Japanese carrom===
Carrom was introduced to Japan in the early 20th century. Carrom became popular as , but fell in popularity in the Shōwa period. However, carrom became known as &quot;Hikone Karomu&quot; (Hikone carrom) in Hikone, Shiga. The Hikone carrom board has larger pockets (not unlike those of pichenotte), the discs are arranged in a ring (also like in Pichette), each player is given twelve discs instead of nine, and the queen (known as the &quot;jack&quot;) is pocketed last (similar to Eight-ball or Black ball).

===South African fingerboard===
It is similar to Carrom played in South Asia, but coins are used rather than rocks.

===Mexican fichapool===

Since 2008 there is a Mexican variation called fichapool or colloquially, &quot;fichapúl&quot; (from Spanish &quot;ficha&quot;). The men (12 each side) as the strikers, are plastic rings. As the South African fingerboard, it has larger pockets.

===Bangladeshi Carrom===

Bangladesh Carrom Federation was formed in 1990. The reason for Bangladesh&#x27;s lack of success at the international level may be that the game is played at different levels at the roots level.

==Commercial derivations==
Several companies made copies of Haskell&#x27;s carrom game board. The Transogram Company made a version in the 1950s and called it &quot;Skooker&quot;. Coleco made reproductions in the 1980s with names like &quot;Carom-playing Games Board&quot; with up to 202 derived replication games. Some variants in the 1970s were called &quot;101 Games Board&quot; and &quot;Carom-playing 166 Games Board&quot;. An ice-box manufacturer made &quot;Combinola&quot; and &quot;Crokinola&quot; variants.

==Cultural depictions==

Films depicting Carrom include the 2003 Hindi film &quot;Munna Bhai M.B.B.S&quot;, the 2010 Hindi film &quot;Striker&quot; and the 2018 Tamil film &quot;Vada Chennai&quot;.

==Similar games==

Games similar to carrom include pichenotte, pitchnut, crokinole, Chapayev, novuss and button football.

<doc id="416954" wikidata="Q2066554" url="?curid=416954" title="Viral evolution">
<text>Viral evolution is a subfield of evolutionary biology and virology concerned with the evolution of viruses. Viruses have short generation times, and many—in particular RNA viruses—have relatively high mutation rates (on the order of one point mutation or more per genome per round of replication). Although most viral mutations confer no benefit and often even prove deleterious to viruses, the rapid rate of viral mutation combined with natural selection allows viruses to quickly adapt to changes in their host environment. In addition, because viruses typically produce many copies in an infected host, mutated genes can be passed on to many offspring quickly. Although the chance of mutations and evolution can change depending on the type of virus (e.g., double stranded DNA, double stranded RNA, or single stranded DNA), viruses overall have high chances for mutations.

Viral evolution is an important aspect of the epidemiology of viral diseases such as influenza (influenza virus), AIDS (HIV), and hepatitis (e.g. HCV). The rapidity of viral mutation also causes problems in the development of successful vaccines and antiviral drugs, as resistant mutations often appear within weeks or months after the beginning of a treatment. One of the main theoretical models applied to viral evolution is the quasispecies model, which defines a viral quasispecies as a group of closely related viral strains competing within an environment.

==Origins==
=== Three classical hypotheses ===
Studies at the molecular level have revealed relationships between viruses infecting organisms from each of the three domains of life, suggesting viral proteins that pre-date the divergence of life and thus infecting the last universal common ancestor. This indicates that some viruses emerged early in the evolution of life, and that they have probably arisen multiple times. It has been suggested that new groups of viruses have repeatedly emerged at all stages of evolution, often through the displacement of ancestral structural and genome replication genes.
There are three main classical hypotheses that aim to explain the origins of viruses:

; Regressive hypothesis: Viruses may have once been small cells that parasitized larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They lend support to this hypothesis, as their dependence on parasitism is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell. This is also called the &quot;degeneracy hypothesis&quot;, or &quot;reduction hypothesis&quot;.
; Cellular origin hypothesis: Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that &quot;escaped&quot; from the genes of a larger organism. The escaped DNA could have come from plasmids (pieces of naked DNA that can move between cells) or transposons (molecules of DNA that replicate and move around to different positions within the genes of the cell). Once called &quot;jumping genes&quot;, transposons are examples of mobile genetic elements and could be the origin of some viruses. They were discovered in maize by Barbara McClintock in 1950. This is sometimes called the &quot;vagrancy hypothesis&quot;, or the &quot;escape hypothesis&quot;.
; Co-evolution hypothesis: This is also called the &quot;virus-first hypothesis&quot; and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid at the same time that cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. They have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan &quot;Acanthamoeba castellanii&quot;. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called &quot;satellites&quot; and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.

=== Later hypotheses ===

* Chimeric-origins hypothesis: Based on the analyses of the evolution of the replicative and structural modules of viruses, a chimeric scenario for the origin of viruses was proposed in 2019. According to this hypothesis, the replication modules of viruses originated from the primordial genetic pool, although the long course of their subsequent evolution involved many displacements by replicative genes from their cellular hosts. By contrast, the genes encoding major structural proteins evolved from functionally diverse host proteins throughout the evolution of the virosphere. This scenario is distinct from each of the three traditional scenarios but combines features of the Virus-first and Escape hypotheses.

One of the problems for studying viral origins and evolution is the high rate of viral mutation, particularly the case in RNA retroviruses like HIV/AIDS. A recent study based on comparisons of viral protein folding structures, however, is offering some new evidence. Fold Super Families (FSFs) are proteins that show similar folding structures independent of the actual sequence of amino acids, and have been found to show evidence of viral phylogeny. The proteome of a virus, the viral proteome, still contains traces of ancient evolutionary history that can be studied today. The study of protein FSFs suggests the existence of ancient cellular lineages common to both cells and viruses before the appearance of the &#x27;last universal cellular ancestor&#x27; that gave rise to modern cells. Evolutionary pressure to reduce genome and particle size may have eventually reduced viro-cells into modern viruses, whereas other coexisting cellular lineages eventually evolved into modern cells. Furthermore, the long genetic distance between RNA and DNA FSFs suggests that the RNA world hypothesis may have new experimental evidence, with a long intermediary period in the evolution of cellular life.

Definitive exclusion of a hypothesis on the origin of viruses is difficult to make on Earth given the ubiquitous interactions between viruses and cells, and the lack of availability of rocks that are old enough to reveal traces of the earliest viruses on the planet. From an astrobiological perspective, it has therefore been proposed that on celestial bodies such as Mars not only cells but also traces of former virions or viroids should be actively searched for: possible findings of traces of virions in the apparent absence of cells could provide support for the virus-first hypothesis.

==Evolution==

Viruses do not form fossils in the traditional sense as they are much smaller than the finest colloidal fragments forming sedimentary rocks that fossilize plants and animals. However, the genomes of many organisms contain endogenous viral elements (EVEs). These DNA sequences are the remnants of ancient virus genes and genomes that ancestrally &#x27;invaded&#x27; the host germline. For example, the genomes of most vertebrate species contain hundreds to thousands of sequences derived from ancient retroviruses. These sequences are a valuable source of retrospective evidence about the evolutionary history of viruses, and have given birth to the science of paleovirology.

The evolutionary history of viruses can to some extent be inferred from analysis of contemporary viral genomes. The mutation rates for many viruses have been measured, and application of a molecular clock allows dates of divergence to be inferred.

Viruses evolve through changes in their RNA (or DNA), some quite rapidly, and the best adapted mutants quickly outnumber their less fit counterparts. In this sense their evolution is Darwinian. The way viruses reproduce in their host cells makes them particularly susceptible to the genetic changes that help to drive their evolution. The RNA viruses are especially prone to mutations. In host cells there are mechanisms for correcting mistakes when DNA replicates and these kick in whenever cells divide. These important mechanisms prevent potentially lethal mutations from being passed on to offspring. But these mechanisms do not work for RNA and when an RNA virus replicates in its host cell, changes in their genes are occasionally introduced in error, some of which are lethal. One virus particle can produce millions of progeny viruses in just one cycle of replication, therefore the production of a few &quot;dud&quot; viruses is not a problem. Most mutations are &quot;silent&quot; and do not result in any obvious changes to the progeny viruses, but others confer advantages that increase the fitness of the viruses in the environment. These could be changes to the virus particles that disguise them so they are not identified by the cells of the immune system or changes that make antiviral drugs less effective. Both of these changes occur frequently with HIV.

Many viruses (for example, influenza A virus) can &quot;shuffle&quot; their genes with other viruses when two similar strains infect the same cell. This phenomenon is called genetic shift, and is often the cause of new and more virulent strains appearing. Other viruses change more slowly as mutations in their genes gradually accumulate over time, a process known as antigenic drift.

Through these mechanisms new viruses are constantly emerging and present a continuing challenge in attempts to control the diseases they cause. Most species of viruses are now known to have common ancestors, and although the &quot;virus first&quot; hypothesis has yet to gain full acceptance, there is little doubt that the thousands of species of modern viruses have evolved from less numerous ancient ones. The morbilliviruses, for example, are a group of closely related, but distinct viruses that infect a broad range of animals. The group includes measles virus, which infects humans and primates; canine distemper virus, which infects many animals including dogs, cats, bears, weasels and hyaenas; rinderpest, which infected cattle and buffalo; and other viruses of seals, porpoises and dolphins. Although it is not possible to prove which of these rapidly evolving viruses is the earliest, for such a closely related group of viruses to be found in such diverse hosts suggests the possibility that their common ancestor is ancient.

===Bacteriophage===
Escherichia virus T4 (phage T4) is a species of bacteriophage that infects &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; bacteria. It is a double-stranded DNA virus in the family &quot;Myoviridae&quot;. Phage T4 is an obligate intracellular parasite that reproduces within the host bacterial cell and its progeny are released when the host is destroyed by lysis. The complete genome sequence of phage T4 encodes about 300 gene products. These virulent viruses are among the largest, most complex viruses that are known and one of the best studied model organisms. They have played a key role in the development of virology and molecular biology. The numbers of reported genetic homologies between phage T4 and bacteria and between phage T4 and eukaryotes are similar suggesting that phage T4 shares ancestry with both bacteria and eukaryotes and has about equal similarity to each. Phage T4 may have diverged in evolution from a common ancestor of bacteria and eukaryotes or from an early evolved member of either lineage. Most of the phage genes showing homology with bacteria and eukaryotes encode enzymes acting in the ubiquitous processes of DNA replication, DNA repair, recombination and nucleotide synthesis. These processes likely evolved very early. The adaptive features of the enzymes catalyzing these early processes may have been maintained in the phage T4, bacterial, and eukaryotic lineages because they were established well-tested solutions to basic functional problems by the time these lineages diverged.

== Transmission ==
Viruses have been able to continue their infectious existence due to evolution. Their rapid mutation rates and natural selection has given viruses the advantage to continue to spread. One way that viruses have been able to spread is with the evolution of virus transmission. The virus can find a new host through:

* Droplet transmission: the virus is spread to a new host through bodily fluids (an example is the influenza virus)
* Airborne transmission: the virus is passed on through the air (an example is viral meningitis)
* Vector transmission: the virus is picked up by a carrier and brought to a new host (an example is viral encephalitis)
* Waterborne transmission: the virus leaves a host and enters the water, where a new host consumes the water (an example is the poliovirus)
* Sit-and-wait-transmission: the virus is living outside a host for long periods of time (an example is the smallpox virus)

Virulence, or the harm that the virus does on its host, depends on various factors. In particular, the method of transmission tends to affect how the level of virulence will change over time. Viruses that transmit through vertical transmission (transmission to the offspring of the host) will evolve to have lower levels of virulence. Viruses that transmit through horizontal transmission (transmission between members of the same species that don&#x27;t have a parent-child relationship) will usually evolve to have a higher virulence. &#x27;

<text>John William Patrick Smith (born 17 March 1951) is a Welsh Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Vale of Glamorgan from the 1989 by-election to 1992 and from 1997 to the 2010 general elections.

==Early life==
Born in Penarth, he attended Fairfield County Primary School in Penarth. Subsequent to him passing the &#x27;Eleven Plus Exam&#x27; he attended Penarth County Grammar School (which later became the comprehensive Stanwell School). He served for a while in the Royal Air Force, then worked as a carpenter and joiner for Vale Borough Council from 1971 to 1976. He became a mature student in 1976, studying at the Gwent College of Higher Education, then went to University College of Wales, Cardiff (now Cardiff University) graduating with a BSc in 1981. He was then a university tutor until 1985. From 1985 to 1989, he was a senior lecturer in Business Studies. He became a campaign manager for Gwent Image Partnership, becoming chief executive from 1992 after he lost his seat by only 19 votes.

==Parliamentary career==
Having contested Vale of Glamorgan at the 1987 general election, he was first elected for the seat in a 1989 by-election, lost it to the Conservatives in 1992 by a very narrow margin, and regained it in 1997. He was re-elected in 2001 and 2005, and served as a member of the Defence Select Committee. He spent much of his time dealing with concerns over the future of RAF St Athan. On the issue of the Iraq War, Smith opposed any form of military action, and was deeply saddened by the parliamentary vote that supported British involvement in the war.

On 22 May 2009, Smith announced that he would stand down at the 2010 general election.

Smith was a Member of the Defence Committee, and Chairman of the Wales Anti-Apartheid Movement (WAAM)

==Personal life==
Smith came from a working class family, born and raised on a council estate. He married Kathleen Mulvaney (now Kathleen Smith) in 1971 in Liverpool. They have two sons and a daughter, and are now Grandparents.

<doc id="416959" wikidata="Q155256" url="?curid=416959" title="Judge Not (song)">
<text>&quot;Judge Not&quot; is Bob Marley&#x27;s first recorded single, recorded at Federal Studios and released on Leslie Kong&#x27;s Beverley&#x27;s Records in Jamaica in 1962 and on Island Records in the UK the following year. With a ska beat, Marley has a youthful voice, as he was 16 years old at the time of recording. Headley Bennett performed saxophone on this recording. Though &quot;Judge Not&quot; failed to achieve much success, Marley was not discouraged and continued to record music. &quot;Judge Not&quot; was re-released in the &quot;Songs of Freedom&quot; album in 1992 as well as other compilations. The song was also covered by Sublime, and can be found on the box set &quot;Everything Under the Sun&quot;.

The song is about morality, and may have been based on the Biblical quote &quot;Judge not lest ye be judged&quot;. Some of the song lyrics are paraphrased in the background vocals of the later Marley hit &quot;Could You Be Loved&quot;.

== Covers ==
Ska band The Interrupters covered &quot;Judge Not&quot; on their 2014 debut album &quot;The Interrupters.&quot; The song is frequently included in their live sets.

<text>Ifor Huw Irranca-Davies (; born 22 January 1963) is a Welsh Labour and Co-operative politician who has served as Deputy First Minister of Wales since August 2024, and as Cabinet Secretary for Climate Change and Rural Affairs since March 2024. He has been the Member of the Senedd (MS) for Ogmore since 2016. Irranca-Davies was previously the Member of Parliament (MP) for Ogmore from 2002 to 2016.

Having served as Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Northern Ireland Office, the Department for Work and Pensions, and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, he became an Assistant Whip in May 2006. On 29 June 2007, he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, before being promoted to the role of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Irranca-Davies resigned his seat in parliament in March 2016 to stand to represent the constituency in the Senedd, winning the seat in the elections held in May 2016.

==Early life==
Irranca-Davies was born Ifor Huw Davies in 1963 to Teresa and Gethin Davies. He campaigned as a boy in general elections for his step great-uncle, Ifor Davies, MP for Gower and deputy to Cledwyn Hughes at the Welsh Office during Harold Wilson&#x27;s government. He attended Gowerton Comprehensive School (where his mother was a secretary), and later earned a BA (Hons) at Crewe and Alsager College, and an MSc from Swansea Metropolitan University.

After leaving higher education, he worked for local authorities in leisure management; and it was while he was working in a sports centre and she was doing aerobics that he met his wife, Joanna Irranca, born to Italian parents who had come to work in South Wales in the 1950s. On marriage, the couple both changed their surnames to Irranca-Davies; he in particular felt his existing surname was too common. The couple have three sons.

Later, he worked in private sector management, as a lecturer at Swansea Metropolitan University.

==Political career==

=== UK Parliament ===
In 2001, Irranca-Davies was Labour candidate for the Brecon &amp; Radnor constituency, but finished third, behind the Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates. In the by-election of 14 February 2002 he was elected to represent the Ogmore constituency in the South Wales Valleys (a Labour seat since 1918), following the death of MP and Government Whip Sir Ray Powell. (Irranca-Davies was himself appointed Government Whip for Wales in May 2006 after spells as a Parliamentary Aide in several government departments.) He was re-elected to serve Ogmore in the general elections of 2005, 2010 and 2015.

While in Parliament, Irranca-Davies worked on a range of local and national issues, including sitting on the Procedures Select Committee to discuss ways of modernising the work of Parliament. He also sat on Standing Committees for a number of bills, including the Police Reform Act 2002, Fireworks Bill and Communications Bill, among others. He also held positions on the Welsh Grand Committee and the Northern Ireland Grand Committee. He worked on Parliamentary Labour Party (&#x27;PLP&#x27;) Committees on Welsh Affairs, Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Home Affairs and International Development. He was also the backbench MP representative on the board of the Coal Health Claims Monitoring Subgroup for Wales.

Irranca-Davies has spoken in the House of Commons on topics as varied as international trade union rights, compulsory voting, anti-social behaviour, renewable energy and climate change, fair trade, social justice and poverty and inequality. In June 2005 he became Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Tessa Jowell, having previously served as PPS to Jane Kennedy at the Northern Ireland Office. He served as PPS to Ministers of the Department for Work and Pensions and Department for Culture, Media and Sport. He worked as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State of Wales, and as an Environment Minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Between October 2010 and October 2011, he served as the Shadow Energy Minister where he led the Labour campaign on the protection of the Feed-In Tariff for solar power. In October 2011, he was appointed as the Shadow Minister on Food and Farming.

He belonged to a number of All Party Groups within Parliament, including the All Party Groups for British Council (Vice-Chair), China Group, Citizens Advice, Clean Coal, Coalfield Communities, Energy Intensive Industries (Vice-Chair), Manufacturing, Maritime and Ports, Steel and Metal Related Industry, Children in Wales, Patient and Public Involvement in Health and Social Care (Co-Chair), University Group (Vice-Chair), and Waterways (Co-Chair). He served as Chair of the All Party Group for the Recognition of Munitions Workers which aims &quot;work with the government to find a means of recognising those munitions workers who served during the first and second world wars&quot;

On 19 June 2015, Irranca-Davies was elected to the chairmanship of the Environmental Audit Select Committee.

He was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015. His last day as MP was on 24 March 2016. The Labour party candidate, Chris Elmore, won the 2016 Ogmore by-election to replace him.

=== Senedd ===
In October 2015, Irranca-Davies announced his wish to transition from Westminster to Cardiff Bay. In December 2015, he was selected to contest the Ogmore seat as a Welsh Labour and Co-operative Party candidate at the 2016 Welsh Assembly election. Irranca-Davies won the Assembly seat, with a majority of 9,468. He was re-elected in 2021.

Irranca-Davies was appointed as Minister for Children and Social Care in November 2017 by First Minister Carwyn Jones. He served in the role for just over a year, before returning to the Backbenches in December 2018. In March 2024 he was appointed Cabinet Secretary for Climate Change and Rural Affairs in the Gething government.

In July 2024, after Vaughan Gething stood down as leader of the Welsh Labour party, Irranca-Davies was initially tipped as a candidate to replace him. However, Irranca-Davies declined to run for the leadership, instead forming a unity ticket with Eluned Morgan, under which he would be Deputy First Minister of Wales. Morgan was the only candidate to receive the required number of nominations, and therefore was elected leader of the Labour Party. He was appointed Deputy First Minister of Wales in August.

<doc id="416972" wikidata="Q580971" url="?curid=416972" title="Louis-Honoré Fréchette">
<text>Louis-Honoré Fréchette (; November 16, 1839 – May 31, 1908) was a Canadian poet, politician, playwright and short story writer. For his prose, he would be the first Quebecois to receive the Prix Montyon from the Académie française, as well as the first Canadian to receive any honor of this kind from a European nation.

==Early life and education==
Fréchette was born on November 16, 1839, in Lévis, Lower Canada. From 1854 to 1860, Fréchette did his classical studies at the Séminaire de Québec, the Collège de Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière and at the Séminaire de Nicolet. Fréchette first showed his rebelliousness when he studied at college. He later studied law at Université Laval.

==Career==

In 1864, he opened a lawyer&#x27;s office in Lévis where he founded two newspapers: &quot;Le drapeau de Lévis&quot; and &quot;La Tribune de Levis&quot;. He exiled himself in Chicago where he wrote &quot;La voix d&#x27;un exilé&quot;. A number of plays which he wrote during that period were lost in the Great Chicago Fire.

Fréchette returned to Quebec in 1871, where he was a Liberal candidate for Lévis in the provincial elections that year; he was not elected. However, in 1874 he was elected Member of Parliament in Ottawa. He served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1874 to 1878 as the Liberal Party of Canada member from Lévis.He was not re-elected in 1878. After that, he moved to Montreal where he began writing full-time, having inherited the wealth of his aunt when she died.

He was the first Quebecer to receive the Montyon Prize of the Académie française for his collection of poems &quot;Les Fleurs boréales, les oiseaux de neige&quot; (1879).

In 1881, he was given an honorary LLD by Queen&#x27;s College, Kingston. In that same year Fréchette would meet Mark Twain in Montreal, whose writing he had much admired; indeed the two would remain friends, exchanging works and favorite books. In the following year Twain would toast Fréchette at an American welcoming banquet in Holyoke, joking about his regard for the translation of works that in his fictitious &quot;translation his [Fréchette&#x27;s] pathetic poems have naturally become humorous, his humorous poems have become sad. Anybody who knows even the rudiments of arithmetic will know that Monsieur Fréchette&#x27;s poems are now worth exactly twice as much as they were before.&quot; In 1897, Fréchette was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. After his death in 1908, he was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

Canada Post issued a postage stamp in his honour on July 7, 1989.

In 1991, Louis Honoré Fréchette Public School, a French immersion, opened in Thornhill, Ontario.

<doc id="416978" wikidata="Q432709" url="?curid=416978" title="Samira Makhmalbaf">
<text>Samira Makhmalbaf (, &quot;Samira Makhmalbaaf&quot;; , born 15 February 1980) is an Iranian filmmaker and screenwriter. She is the daughter of Mohsen Makhmalbaf, the film director and writer. Samira Makhmalbaf is considered to be part of the Iranian New Wave. She has won multiple awards, including two Jury Prizes at the Cannes Film Festival, and has been nominated for numerous awards.

== Early life ==
Samira Makhmalbaf was born 15 February 1980 in Tehran to filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf. She joined her father on his film sets as a child and watched him edit afterwards. In her official biography, Makhmalbaf stated that her first taste for cinema came as a 7-year-old when she played a role in her father&#x27;s film &quot;The Cyclist&quot; in 1987. Makhmalbaf left high school when she was 14 years old to study cinema in the Makhmalbaf Film House for five years. At age 20, she studied Psychology and Law at Roehampton University in London.

== Career ==
At the age of 17, after directing two video productions, Makhmalbaf went on to direct her first feature film, &quot;La Pomme&quot; (&quot;The Apple)&quot;. She presented &quot;La Pomme&quot; at Cannes Film Festival. In an interview at the London Film Festival in 1998, Samira Makhmalbaf stated that she felt that &quot;The Apple&quot; owed its existence to the new circumstances and changed the atmosphere in Iran due to the Khatami presidency. &quot;The Apple&quot; was invited to more than 100 international film festivals in two years, and going on to the screen in more than thirty countries. In 2000 she was a member of the jury at the 22nd Moscow International Film Festival.

Samira Makhmalbaf has been the winner and nominee for numerous awards. She was nominated twice for &quot;Golden Palm&quot; of Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Takhté siah&quot; (&quot;Blackboards&quot;) (2001) and &quot;Panj é asr&quot; (&quot;At Five in the Afternoon&quot;) (2003). She won &quot;Prix du Jury&quot; of Cannes for both films in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Samira Mohmalbaf also won the &quot;Sutherland Trophy&quot; at the London Film Festival for &quot;The Apple&quot; in 1998 and the &quot;UNESCO Award&quot; at the Venice Film Festival in 2002 for &quot;11&#x27;09&quot;01 September 11&quot;. In 2003, a panel of critics at the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; named Makhmalbaf among the forty best directors at work today.

During the production of &quot;Asbe du-pa&quot; (&quot;Two Legged Horse&quot;), Makhmalbaf and her cast and crew suffered an attack while filming in Afghanistan. Production stopped when a man who infiltrated the set as an extra tossed a hand grenade from the rooftop of a local bazaar. The attack severely injured six cast members and killed a horse. In an interview, Makhmalbaf stated: &quot;I saw little boys falling to the ground, and the whole street was full of blood... My first thought was that I wouldn&#x27;t see my father anymore.&quot; Determined to carry on, Makhmalbaf completed her film and held the initial release in 2008 in France.

After completing &quot;Asbe du-pa&quot;, Makhmalbaf earned nominations at various international film festivals, ultimately winning awards at Ghent International Film Festival, San Sebastián International Film Festival and Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival.

== Style and themes ==
Makhmalbaf&#x27;s films followed applied the doc-fiction hybrid aesthetic of her father&#x27;s earlier work. Employing non-professional actors and street-level realism. Her films have been known to follow a theme of progress and change. As reflected in her style, she strives to portray real-world political purpose, fully committed to exposing issues such as poverty. She also tackles topics such as women&#x27;s rights and education in &quot;Panj é asr&quot; (&quot;At Five in The Afternoon)&quot;, which centres around a young woman in Afghanistan who sets out to pursue a more open-minded education at a non-religious school.

In an interview with &quot;Indiewire&quot;, she is asked about the relationship between metaphor and reality in her film &quot;Blackboards&quot;. She says: &quot;The first image of the film starts with a very surreal image, but as you go into the film, you can feel the reality of being a fugitive. And I love this image very much, and I think it can carry different meanings. It can express social, intelligent, and poetic meaning -- so many metaphors, and yet you can go into their reality. The idea for the film came to my father&#x27;s mind when I was looking for a subject to do for my next film. He gave me three or four pages, and then it was time to imagine it. But I couldn&#x27;t simply imagine it. How can I sit here in Cannes and think of people living in Kurdistan? So I had to go into it and be involved in it. So I cast the actors and found my locations, and at the same time, I let the reality of the situation come in. I don&#x27;t want to kill the subject, put it in front of the camera, and just shoot it as a dead subject. I let reality come into my imagination. I believe that metaphors are born from the imagination of the artist and the reality of life, making love to each other. For example, imagine over a hundred old men wanting to return to their country. This is imagination and reality. It&#x27;s a reality because some older generations want to return to their country to die. This is real. But just being old men is imagination. Or just being one woman is imagination. Or carrying these whiteboards is a combination of reality and imagination. Because maybe it&#x27;s possible, if you&#x27;re a refugee or a teacher, what can you do except carry your blackboard and look for students? They are like street vendors, shouting, &quot;Come, try to learn something!&quot; In such a dire situation, everyone is poor, so nobody can learn anything. It is imagination, but it could exist.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Mohsen Makhmalbaf married Fatemeh Meshkini, who gave birth to their three children – Samira (or Zeynab, born in 1980), Meysam (or Ayyoub, born in 1981), and Hana (or Khatereh, born in 1988).
Mohsen Makhmalbaf says in an interview: &quot;When I left the political organizations and moved into radio, Fatemeh came with me. I wrote programming, and she became an announcer. When Samira was born, we&#x27;d take her to the radio station. We worked, and she was always with one of us.&quot; Fatemeh Meshkini died in an accident in 1982. Mohsen Makhmalbaf subsequently married Fatemeh Meshkini&#x27;s sister, Marziyeh Meshkini.

Samira Makhmalbaf has been a great activist for women&#x27;s rights almost all her life. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she said: &quot;We have a lot of limitations from all the written and unwritten law. But, still, I hope, and I believe that it will get better. It started with the democratic movement. But some things don&#x27;t happen consciously. I wanted to make films, I made films to say something else, but in a way, I became a kind of example. It was breaking some cliche. Another new way of thinking started. Yes, we have a lot of limitations, but these limitations made a lot of strong, different kinds of women in Iran who, if they find a chance to express themselves, have plenty of things to say. They may have found a deeper way through all these limitations.&quot; In the same interview, she talks about politics and says, &quot;Even if I made that kind of direct movie talking about politics, it&#x27;s nothing. Nothing, because it&#x27;s just talking like a journalist. You are saying something superficial. The movies I make are deeper. This kind of work can live longer and deeper than that kind of journalistic work.&quot;

&quot;At Five in the Afternoon&quot; is the first feature film in a post-Taliban environment. She talked about her film to the BBC: &quot;I wanted to show reality, not the cliches on television saying that the US went to Afghanistan and rescued the people from the Taliban, that the US did a &quot;Rambo&quot;. Though the Taliban have gone, their ideas are anchored in peoples&#x27; minds, in their traditions and culture, there is still a big difference between men and women in Afghanistan.&quot;

In an interview with the BBC, she discusses the difficulties women directors face in Iran. &quot;Traditionally, it is in the minds of everybody that a woman cannot be a filmmaker. It is, therefore, very much harder for a woman. Also, when you live in this kind of situation, there is a danger that you can start to develop a similar mindset. So the thing is to challenge this situation, and then slowly, the situation will also change in the minds of others. I very much hope that in the advent of freedom and democracy, Iran can produce many more women directors.&quot;

<doc id="416980" wikidata="Q6308404" url="?curid=416980" title="Julie Morgan">
<text>Julie Morgan (née Edwards; 2 November 1944) is a Welsh Labour Party politician, who has been a Member of the Senedd for Cardiff North seat in the Senedd since the 2011 election. She was previously Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardiff North from 1997 until 2010.

She was married to former First Minister of Wales Rhodri Morgan until his death in 2017.

==Early life, education and career==
Julie Edwards was born in Cardiff in 1944. She was educated at Dinas Powys Primary School and Howell&#x27;s School Llandaff. She then attended King&#x27;s College London where she graduated with a BA in English in 1965. Just as her first term at university was about to begin, a general election was called, and she returned to Cardiff to campaign for Jim Callaghan in the seat which was then Cardiff South East.

Despite Callaghan&#x27;s protestations that she should go back to university, she campaigned for his victory alongside Neil Kinnock (the future leader of the Labour party), Glenys Kinnock and Rhodri Morgan, whom she would marry in 1967. Following her undergraduate degree, Morgan studied at the University of Manchester. She also holds a postgraduate diploma in Social Administration from University College, Cardiff.

Before becoming a Member of Parliament, Morgan was a social worker with Barry Social Services, and served as an assistant director of Barnardo&#x27;s. She was elected as a local councillor to South Glamorgan County Council between 1985 and 1996, and was a Cardiff City Councillor from 1995.

== Member of Parliament (1997–⁠2010) ==
Morgan was selected by Cardiff North Labour Party as their candidate for the 1992 general election. She stood against Gwilym Jones in the constituency, historically a Conservative stronghold. She achieved a 38.9% share of the vote to Jones&#x27; 45.1%, cutting his majority to 2,969.

Morgan was selected to stand for the seat once again in the 1997 election, though this time through an all-women shortlist. She took the seat with 24,460 votes—a 50.4% share and a majority of 8,126 on a marginally lower turnout than in 1992. She became the first woman to represent a Cardiff constituency and, at the time of her election, was one of only four women MPs from Wales. Morgan made her maiden speech in Parliament on 22 May 1997 in the debate on the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Bill, designed to pave the way for devolution. She subsequently joined the Welsh Affairs Select committee, on which she served until 2005.

Morgan was re-elected at the 2001 general election with a reduced majority of 6,165 and on a substantially reduced turnout (in common with the rest of the country). At the 2005 election, her seat became the most marginal in Wales as her Conservative challenger reduced her majority to 1,146.

Commentators ascribed her victory to a strong personal vote, decisive in a campaign dominated by issues such as the Iraq War, criticism of Tony Blair and a leap in council tax caused by periodic revaluation of property values. Upon her re-election, she was appointed to the Constitutional Affairs and Public Administration Select Committees.
Between 16 December 2009 and 12 March 2010, she steered the Sunbeds (Regulation) Bill (a private members&#x27; bill) through the House of Commons. The bill passed to the House of Lords for consideration.

In the 2010 election, Morgan polled 17,666 votes to Conservative Jonathan Evans&#x27; 17,860 votes, losing by 194 votes. Evans had previously been an MP between 1992 and 1997.

== Senedd ==
Morgan was elected to the seat of Cardiff North in the Senedd, in the 2011 election. She was re-elected in 2016, and again in 2021.

In 2016, she unsuccessfully stood for chair of the Senedd&#x27;s Children, Young People and Education Committee.

Morgan stood for deputy leader in the 2018 Welsh Labour deputy leadership election, ultimately losing to Carolyn Harris despite winning more members&#x27; votes. Later that year, she supported Mark Drakeford in his leadership election. Following Drakeford&#x27;s appointment as First Minister, she was appointed Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services in the Welsh Government.

==Views==
During her second term, she opposed variable tuition fees for university students, citing fears that it would open up a market in higher education. She also opposed the war in Iraq and led a demonstration of &quot;Labour Women Against War&quot; in Cardiff city centre. Nevertheless, her voting record is supportive of the Labour Government, until it proposes a measure she cannot reconcile with her fundamental beliefs—such as the equal treatment of children, for instance in the asylum system, or in respect of protection from violence.

Morgan has been involved in the field of women&#x27;s rights (having heavily promoted the introduction of all-women shortlists for political parties), as well as the welfare of children, black and minority ethnic and disabled people. She was one of the founders of the Purple Plaques scheme of public markers for remarkable women who lived in Wales. She is the chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Children in Wales and is a member of numerous other APPGs, including those on Sex Equality and Compassion in Dying. Within the Parliamentary Labour Party, she is an active member of the Women&#x27;s Group.

As her husband was, she is a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK. She supports lowering the voting age to 16 and to that end has presented a bill to Parliament.

<text>The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) is the operator of mass transit in Chicago, Illinois, United States, and some of its suburbs, including the trains of the Chicago &quot;L&quot; and CTA bus service. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

The CTA is an Illinois independent governmental agency that started operations on October 1, 1947, upon the purchase and combination of the transportation assets of the Chicago Rapid Transit Company and the Chicago Surface Lines streetcar system. In 1952, CTA purchased the assets of the Chicago Motor Coach Company, which was under the control of Yellow Cab Company founder John D. Hertz, resulting in a fully unified system. Today, the CTA is one of the three service boards financially supported by the Regional Transportation Authority and CTA service connects with the commuter rail Metra, and suburban bus and regional paratransit service, Pace.

==Operations==

The Chicago Transit Authority provides service in Chicago and 10 surrounding suburbs. The CTA provided a total of 532 million rides in 2011, a 3 percent increase over 2010 with ridership rising to levels not seen for 20 years.

The CTA operates 24 hours each day and on an average weekday provides 1.7 million rides on buses and trains. It has approximately 1,800 buses that operate over 140 routes traveling along . Buses provide about one million passenger trips a day and serve more than 12,000 posted bus stops. The Chicago Transit Authority&#x27;s 1,450 train cars operate over eight routes and of track. Its trains provide about 750,000 customer trips each weekday and serve 146 stations in Chicago and seven suburbs.

Currently, the CTA provides regular service within Chicago and the neighboring suburbs of Forest Park, Evanston, Skokie, Oak Park, Summit, Cicero, Berwyn, North Riverside, Rosemont, Evergreen Park, Oak Lawn, Park Ridge, Harwood Heights, Norridge, Lincolnwood, and Wilmette.

==Fare collection==


The CTA accepts payment with a Ventra Card which can be purchased with a single-ride, 24-hour unlimited ride ($5), 3 day unlimited ride ($15), 7 day unlimited ride ($20), 30 day unlimited ride ($75), a Ventra disposable ticket, contactless credit or debit card, and certain smartphones. Unlimited ride Ventra cards/tickets are only valid for one passenger. CTA buses also accept cash. Up to three children under 7 can ride free with a fare-paying rider.

The CTA has many free and discounted fare options, for elementary, middle, and high school students, college and university students, people with disabilities, senior citizens, and military service members.

===Cash===
Only buses allow riders to pay directly with cash at a farebox. Exact fare is required, since no change is given. Since January 7, 2018, the bus full fare is $2.50, the senior/disabled fare is $1.25, and the student fare is $.75. No cash transfers are available. Previously, some rail station turnstiles accepted cash, but this feature has been removed in an effort to speed up boarding. Cash at rail stations is only accepted at Ventra Vending Machines to purchase Ventra cards and tickets.

===Transit Cards===
The CTA no longer sells Transit Cards. All remaining Transit Cards must have been used by July 1, 2014. In its place CTA has adopted the Ventra Card system. The Ventra Card can be purchased online, Ventra Vending Machines at CTA rail stations, and at authorized retailers like Walgreens, CVS Pharmacies, and check cashing locations.

===Ventra===

Ventra is an electronic fare payment system for the Chicago Transit Authority and Pace that replaced the Chicago Card and the Transit Card automated fare collection system. Ventra (purportedly Latin for &quot;windy,&quot; though the actual Latin word is &quot;ventosa&quot;) launched in August 2013, with a full system transition slated for July 1, 2014. The Ventra payment system includes several options of payment, including a contactless smart card powered by RFID, a single day or use ticket powered by RFID, any personal bank-issued credit card or debit card that has an RFID chip, and a compatible mobile phone. This includes Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay. Ventra is operated by Cubic Transportation Systems.

Riders using Ventra pay $2.25 for bus, $2.50 for rail (except Blue Line O&#x27;Hare station, $5). Disabled &amp; seniors who are 65 or older pay $1.10 for bus, $1.25 for rail. Elementary and high school students 7–20 years old: Valid 5:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. on school days pay $.75 during school hours and pay $1.10 during weekends and holidays. The two transfers, within two hours, from the start of a trip is free. After that, it is considered a new trip and the user is charged another fare.

===Contactless payments===
Ventra readers on buses and rail station turnstiles can accept contactless payments directly from mobile devices. Riders can pay a PAYG fare ($2.50) by touching mobile phones with Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay—or any contactless bankcard with the contactless wave symbol.

==Equipment==
As mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 for all transit operators in the U.S., all CTA buses are accessible, with a ramp on every bus available for use upon request by anyone who has trouble with steps, even temporarily. The majority of train stations CTA operates have elevators or ramps to provide access for customers with disabilities. All trains are accessible, either through fully level boarding or a ramp to bridge the 3-4in height gap.

==History==

In 1953, the CTA placed an order for Flxible buses after the latter&#x27;s absorption of the Fageol Twin Coach Company.

Until 1973, CTA&#x27;s fleet included a large number of electric trolley buses – or &quot;trolley coaches&quot;, as they were commonly known at the time. In the 1950s, the fleet of around 700 trolley coaches was the largest such fleet in the U.S., and represented about one-quarter of CTA&#x27;s total number of surface-transit vehicles (motor bus, trolley bus and, until 1958, streetcar). Possibly influenced by the 1967 Chicago blizzard, during which CTA trolley buses were unable to maneuver around abandoned automobiles without dewiring, CTA decided to discontinue trolley bus service. Trolley bus service was phased out in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and trolley buses ran for the last time on March 25, 1973.

CTA buses were known as the &quot;green limousine&quot; or the &quot;big green&quot; — buses were one or more shades of green from the CTA&#x27;s establishment until the end of the 1980s. With the delivery of the TMC RTS buses in 1991, a more patriotic color scheme was adopted, and the green scheme was fully phased out by 1996. A notable color scheme was the &quot;Bicentennial&quot; of about 1974 to 1976.

CTA bought very few buses between the mid-1970s and the end of the 1980s. During this time, purchases were only made in 1979 (20 MAN/AM General SG 220 articulated buses), 1982-83 (200 Flyer D901 buses and 125 additional MAN articulateds), and 1985 (362 MAN Americana standard-length buses). Another aspect of this period was that with the exception of the 1979 and 1983 MAN orders, none of those buses had air-conditioning, a budget saving move by the CTA. The 1972-76 fleet of GM &quot;New Look&quot; buses, 1870 total, which were originally air-conditioned (although there were problems with the air-conditioning systems, eventually being disabled and sliding windows installed in the buses), composed the majority of vehicles in service into the early 1990s.

In 1995, the CTA placed an experimental order of their first 65 low floor transit buses from New Flyer Industries D40LF. In 1998, the CTA placed an order for 484 new low floor transit buses from Canadian bus-building firm Nova Bus. This executed move billed the CTA as Nova&#x27;s American launch customer for the latter&#x27;s signature product, the LFS series. This was also done to meet the &quot;Buy American&quot; requirements for buses in the United States transit bus market, since General Motors ceased bus production and Flxible went out of business. Lastly, these buses replaced buses that were built in 1983 and 1985 as these buses both lack air conditioning, aging, and not ADA compliant. 

Today CTA&#x27;s current fleet of buses is mostly dominated by New Flyer&#x27;s D40LF, numbered 1000–2029, which replaced buses that were built in 1991 and 1995. In 2014, CTA ordered 400 new buses from Nova. The number increased to 425 after it exercised an option. The buses are numbered 7900–8324. The CTA exercised another option for an additional twenty-five buses, numbered 8325–8349, from Nova Bus. CTA delivered an additional 600 new buses (numbered 8350-8949) from Nova Bus which replaced the remainder of the older Nova buses that were delivered between 2000-2002, in addition to starting the retirement of New Flyer D40LF buses delivered between 2006-2009.

The rail orders of the CTA include the last railcar stock built by the Budd Company and rail cars built by Boeing-Vertol and Morrison-Knudsen.

The most recent order was from Bombardier who built the 5000-series from 2009 to 2015. Ten (10) prototypes of the 5000-series were received in 2009, and entered passenger testing in April 2010, with 396 more ordered once the tests were completed. On July 20, 2011, CTA announced the order of 300 more railcars, bringing the total ordered to 706 at a cost of about US$1 billion.

In 2014, the CTA received their first electric buses from New Flyer, making the CTA the first major U.S. transit agency to use the new wave of electric buses as part of a regular service.

==Security and safety==
After the September 11 attacks, CTA announced its &quot;If you See Something, Say Something&quot; campaign. CTA has also installed a security camera network, and a system to send real time images from cameras in buses directly to emergency responders.

CTA has also been actively prosecuting vandals, announcing on several occasions that felony convictions were obtained against persons who spray painted authority vehicles.

==Technology==
The CTA installed GPS Bus Tracker systems on all buses starting with the 20 (Madison St) bus in 2006, before expanding it to other routes in 2008. The original claim justifying the addition of this technology was that it would reduce the issue of bunching buses. The system also allows riders to be able to determine the location of buses online.

A report prepared by the CTA claims that there was a decrease in bus bunching from 3.9% to 2.3% from 2007 to 2009, but the report neither demonstrated a direct connection between Bus Tracker and this reduction in bunching, nor did it show whether this was a temporary or permanent phenomenon.

CTA has also made its Bus Tracker and other developer tools available, and is making Bus Tracker arrival data available through text messaging. One of the first applications of the Bus Tracker Developer Tools involved the installation of monitors showing the information in several businesses in Chicago&#x27;s Wicker Park neighborhood. Using the developer API published by CTA, some augmented CTA bus tracking applications have been developed for mobile phones, and CTA has its own Transit App, CTA also has a bus tracker (Beta starting January 2011), and it can also be accessed through a computer, smart phone, text messaging, or any smart device.

==Public art==
The CTA is home to a collection of art – including mosaics, sculptures and paintings. More than 50 pieces of art are exhibited at over 40 CTA stations.

According to the CTA, the original pieces of artwork contribute to each station&#x27;s identity and enhance travel for customers. Many of the pieces are a result of the Arts in Transit Program, which is funded by the Federal Transit Administration and coordinated locally through the City of Chicago&#x27;s Office of Tourism and Culture. A number of other pieces were created through the CTA&#x27;s Adopt-A-Station program and through partnerships with organizations such as the Chicago Public Art Group.

===Arts in Transit===
In 2004, the CTA and the City of Chicago Public Art Program installed nine permanent works of art at eight renovated rail stations on what is now known as the Pink Line. The CTA has since created an ongoing program to showcase permanent works of art in conjunction with the City of Chicago Public Art Program. The Arts in Transit Program is funded by the Federal Transit Administration, and created opportunities to develop original artwork for station reconstruction projects along the CTA Red and Brown Lines. Artists were selected for each of the stations included in the Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project and select renovated Red Line stations.

With the completion of the Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project in December 2009, original artwork was installed in each of the 18 renovated stations along the CTA&#x27;s Brown Line. By combining the visibility and accessibility of the city&#x27;s mass transit system with the creativity of Chicago&#x27;s art resources, this program resulted in a successful public display of professional works of art designed with input from nearby communities. This program provided high-profile locations for public art and server as a gateway to communities served by the CTA stations. Media under consideration included, but were not limited to, mosaics, art glass, ornamental fencing, mixed-media artwork, and freestanding sculpture and furniture.

The CTA and the City of Chicago Public Art Program, administered by the Office of Tourism and Culture, encouraged and facilitated collaborations between artists, government agencies, the community and other partners. The City of Chicago Public Art Program accepted qualifications from local and national professional artists or artist teams capable of creating permanent public works of art for the CTA Arts in Transit Program for the renovated stations.

==TV show==
The Chicago Transit Authority produced a monthly television show, &quot;Connections&quot;, from May 2003 until March 2011. The show, hosted by Braydens Connections, was broadcast on City of Chicago Public-access television cable TV channels 23 &amp; 49, as well as on Comcast&#x27;s CN100 in the Chicago metropolitan area, including areas of Michigan and Indiana.

Connections featured news and information about the CTA and services it provides. Individual segments from Connections are available on CTA&#x27;s YouTube channel.

<doc id="416982" wikidata="Q7096774" url="?curid=416982" title="Operation Avalanche (child pornography investigation)">
<text>Operation Avalanche was a major United States investigation of child pornography on the Internet launched in 1999 after the arrest and conviction of Thomas and Janice Reedy, who operated an Internet pornography business called Landslide Productions in Fort Worth, Texas. It was made public in early August 2001, at the end of Operation Avalanche, that 100 arrests were made out of 144 suspects. It was followed by Operation Ore in the United Kingdom, Operation Snowball in Canada, Operation Pecunia in Germany, Operation Amethyst in Ireland, and Operation Genesis in Switzerland.

Although US prosecutions were made on the basis of other evidence, later reconstruction of the Landslide site and review of the computer hard drives in the UK identified flaws in the police forensic procedures used and contradicted evidence on the website given at the Reedys&#x27; trial. Specifically, investigation of the Landslide data indicated many names listed were victims of credit card fraud and that there was no link on the Landslide front page to take the user to child pornography sites, as stated in sworn trial testimony.

==Landslide Productions, Inc.==
Thomas Reedy was a self-taught computer programmer and entrepreneur living in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. He trained and worked as a nurse, but, understanding the financial possibilities of the Internet, he set up an adult pornography website that provided a comfortable income. He soon developed a better strategy to provide middleman services for the adult pornography industry. In 1997, he set up Landslide Productions, Inc., which he ran with his wife Janice, who handled bookkeeping for the company. Landslide quickly became an adult pornography empire stretching across three continents, with some 300,000 subscribers in 60 countries. Within two years, the company made $10 million and provided the owners with a luxurious lifestyle.

Landslide provided payment systems for adult webmasters from different countries. The systems were automated; webmasters could sign up to the system online, and users accessing the websites would go through the payment or login system before being granted access. The principal systems were AVS, for Adult Verification System, and Keyz, because it operated via the keyz.com domain name owned by Landslide.

The AVS system was meant to legally protect the companies from laws against disseminating pornography to minors, as the credit card was used to verify that the user attempting to access a particular website was of legal age to view the website&#x27;s content. Users could sign up with their credit cards to access affiliated sites, which received 65% of the sign-up fee, while Landslide took the remainder and handled the transactions with the credit card companies.

In 1998, Thomas Reedy recognized systematic fraud in streams of different credit cards being signed up in batches from the same internet address to the same website. In the use of stolen card information, Landslide would have had to bear the loss if there had been a chargeback from the card issuer, often including a penalty fee; also, the credit card industry imposed a 1% maximum for chargebacks. To preserve his business, Reedy traced the source of the traffic, set up a new web service called Badcard.com to capture card numbers coming from the same internet address, and drew up lists of addresses and card numbers that appeared to be suspiciously used. However, his efforts failed to stop the fraudulent charges.

Landslide went out of business in August 1999, as the fraudulent charges passed the 1% ceiling, leading to Superior Credit withdrawing its merchant services on August 10. Without this merchant account, Landslide could not charge credit cards and could no longer fulfill the primary function of the business. Reportedly, the biggest source of fraud at that time was coming through websites run by US law enforcement as part of a sting operation.

==Landslide investigation==

In April 1999, in Texas, the United States Postal Inspection Service received an internal complaint from postal inspector Robert Adams. Adams had received a tip from Ronnie Miller, an acquaintance in Saint Paul, Minnesota who provided information about a website advertising child pornography. The image in question was being sourced from a website in Indonesia, which presented the question as to whether the USPIS could legally investigate and prosecute it.

In early 1999, the United States Postal Inspection Service engaged the Dallas Police Department to further investigate whether the image from Indonesia could be prosecuted. As a part of a nationwide initiative funded by the Office of Justice Program&#x27;s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), the United States Department of Justice announced a grant from the Internet Crimes Against Children Taskforce Program to the Dallas Police Department on January 10, 1998. The purpose of the ICAC was to investigate and prosecute Internet crimes against children.

The court transcriptions from the case against Landslide Productions revealed that the Dallas Police Department had formed a relationship with Microsoft Corporation after the software maker had encouraged its technical employees to volunteer their time to better the community in which they lived. After having confirmed that prosecution would be difficult because the image in question was indeed being sourced from Indonesia, the Dallas Police Department asked its local Microsoft volunteers to assist in investigating the image. Using Web Buddy, a computer program designed to display Internet traffic on geographic maps, the volunteers helped the Dallas police verify that internet traffic related to Ronnie Miller&#x27;s complaint was passing through the routers of Ft. Worth-based Landslide Productions.

An adult classified section of the Landslide website allegedly included postings offering to trade Landslide-owned Keyz passwords, and illegal child pornography sites were found to be using the Keyz payment system. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) and Dallas police presented their findings to Terri Moore, an Assistant District Attorney in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, and received warrants to search the Landslide business offices and the Reedy home. In August 1999, 45 to 50 law enforcement officials from a number of agencies conducted a raid on the Landslide business offices in Fort Worth.

The raid of the Reedys&#x27; Fort Worth residence resulted in the confiscation of a home computer, on which computer expert Dane Heiskel uncovered business emails confirming his knowledge of customers using Reedy&#x27;s payment system to access child pornography. Sexually explicit images of children were also found on this computer.

Police seized the assets and records of Landslide and arrested Thomas and Janice Reedy (see &quot;United States v. Reedy&quot; - 4:00-cr-00054). Prosecutors offered Thomas a 20-year prison term and Janice a five-year term if they would plead guilty, but the Reedys refused the plea deal, believing they could not be held legally responsible for the content of third-party websites. Reedy maintained that he had attempted to run a legitimate business by writing software to reduce fraud, reporting illegal sites to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and cooperating with the ensuing investigations. According to Reedy, he was told by Special Agent Frank Super to leave the sites in his index for later investigation.

In January 2000, Thomas Reedy was convicted of trafficking in child pornography through testimony from witnesses, including Sharon Girling, a UK police officer at SOCA/NCS. Based on a prior police investigation in the UK, Girling identified victims in the pictures from a website that used the Landslide payment system. Thomas Reedy was sentenced to 1,335 years in prison, a sentence that was reduced to 180 years on appeal.

==Operation Avalanche==
The Reedy case led to the creation of a nationwide network of 30 federally funded task forces to fight Internet crimes against children. In August 2001, Attorney General John Ashcroft and Chief Postal Inspector Kenneth Weaver announced the launch of Operation Avalanche, an operation to gather evidence against users of the Landslide gateway and payment system. The seized database records included 35,000 US subscribers, some of whom were targeted with invitations to purchase child pornography by mail. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that the government also continued to run the Reedys&#x27; Landslide website for a time as part of the sting. As a result of Operation Avalanche, 100 suspects were arrested following 144 searches in 37 states.

The FBI then passed identities from the database to the police organizations of other countries, including 7,272 names in the UK and 2,329 names in Canada. Initial results of the operation seemed positive, as the gateway site and payment system were closed down and thousands of possible users of child pornography websites were identified for later investigation.

==Controversies==
Police conducting Operation Ore in the UK targeted all names for investigation due to the difference in laws between the US and the UK, which allowed for arrest on a charge of incitement to distribute child pornography based solely on the presence of a name in the database, regardless of whether the card was used—fraudulently or not—for child pornography or for other legal adult sites. Law in the UK allows conviction on the basis of incitement to distribute indecent images; as such, the mere presence on the database, regardless of the legality of the sites paid for, was sufficient to warrant prosecution. In all, 3,744 people were investigated, and arrested and 1,451 of those were convicted. However, a subsequent challenge by those targeted led to an independent reconstruction of the Landslide site and a closer inspection of the database and the payment transactions.

In 2005 and 2007, UK investigative journalist Duncan Campbell wrote a series of articles criticizing police forensic procedures and trial evidence. After obtaining copies of the Landslide hard drives, Campbell publicly identified evidence of massive credit card fraud, including thousands of charges where there was no access to any porn site at all. Campbell stated, &quot;Independent computer expert Jim Bates of Computer Investigations said &#x27;the scale of the fraud, especially hacking, just leapt off the screen&#x27;.&quot;

Campbell&#x27;s articles also indicated that sworn statements provided by Dallas detective Steve Nelson and US postal inspector Michael Mead were false. They testified that entry to the Landslide site was through a front-page screen featuring a button saying &quot;Click Here (for) Child Porn.&quot; However, the later investigation established that the button was never on the website&#x27;s front page. Instead, it was on an advertising banner for another website buried deep in the Landslide offerings.

After Campbell&#x27;s articles appeared, independent computer expert Jim Bates of &quot;Computer Investigations&quot; was charged and convicted of four counts of making false statements and one count of perjury regarding his qualifications and barred from appearing as an expert witness. He was later arrested for possession of indecent images during his Operation Ore investigation. However, the search of Bates&#x27; home was later ruled unlawful.

<text>Kim Scott Howells (born 27 November 1946) is a Welsh Labour Party former politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Pontypridd from 1989 to 2010, and held a number of ministerial positions within the Blair and Brown governments.

==Biography==
Howells is the son of Glanville Howells, a Communist lorry driver, and of Joan Glenys Howells. Born in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales and raised in Penywaun near Aberdare in the Cynon Valley, he is a former pupil of Mountain Ash Grammar School.

Howells went to Hornsey College of Art where he was active in the May 1968 student occupation, and was the first protester to breach the Metropolitan Police cordon at the demonstration against the Vietnam War outside the US Embassy in Grosvenor Square in 1968.

Howells featured as a student leader at Hornsey College of Art in director John Goldschmidt&#x27;s film &quot;Our Live Experiment is worth more than 3,000 Textbooks&quot;, made for Granada Television and shown on the ITV network.

He attended the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology between 1971 and 1974 where he studied for a Joint Honours Degree and was awarded an upper second, which allowed him to follow post-graduate studies in history. Howells later obtained a PhD from the University of Warwick in 1979 for a thesis entitled &quot;A view from below: tradition, experience and nationalism in the South Wales coalfield, 1937–1957&quot;.

===Professional career===
On returning home to South Wales from college, Howells worked as a researcher and editor for the &quot;South Wales Miner&quot;, before becoming a South Wales National Union of Mineworkers official and local representative of the Communist Party of Great Britain. He joined the Labour Party in 1982.

Howells ran the NUM Pontypridd office which co-ordinated the South Wales miners&#x27; efforts during the UK miners&#x27; strike. A serious incident during the national dispute occurred in his area at the end of November 1984, when taxi driver David Wilkie was killed when two striking miners dropped a concrete block off a local bridge onto Wilkie&#x27;s taxi, which was taking a strike-breaking miner to work. On being told of the incident in a telephone call from a reporter of the &quot;South Wales Echo&quot;, Howells rode his bicycle to the NUM offices.

After allegations that he hid evidence associated with the death of Wilkie, and an investigation by South Wales Police, Howells in 2004 commented in a BBC Wales documentary that when he heard the news, he thought &quot;hang on, we&#x27;ve got all those records we&#x27;ve kept over in the NUM offices, there&#x27;s all those maps on the wall, we&#x27;re gonna get implicated in this&quot;. He then destroyed a large number of papers because he feared a police raid on the union offices. He has commented that the attack by the strikers was a result of pressure to get the miners to return to work.

After the miners&#x27; strike and the closure of 29 of the 30 National Coal Board pits in South Wales, Howells became a writer and presenter for television and radio, and a college lecturer.

===Parliamentary career===

Howells entered the House of Commons in a by-election in 1989. As a member of the Labour Opposition, he became successively an Opposition Spokesman on Trade and Industry, on Home Affairs, on Foreign Affairs and on Development and Co-operation. Howells suggested in 1996 that the word &quot;socialism&quot; ought to be &quot;humanely phased out&quot; of Labour Party policy documents. In 1995, Clause IV of the party&#x27;s constitution was revised to state that &quot;The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party&quot;.

He held a string of junior ministerial posts in various departments following the 1997 election until October 2008. From May 1997 to January 1998, he served as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Education and Employment. He then served in the Department for Trade and Industry until June 2001, and then as a junior minister with the trade and broadcasting brief at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport until June 2003. He served as a Minister of State from June 2003 to September 2004, when he became Minister for Higher Education. He left that post when he was made Minister for the Middle East in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in May 2005. He remained a Minister of State at the Foreign Office after Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, but returned to the backbenches when Brown conducted a reshuffle in October 2008.

After leaving the government Howells was appointed to take over from Margaret Beckett as chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee, a committee of parliamentarians that oversees the work of Britain&#x27;s intelligence and security agencies.

In 2003, he said the Labour government was trying to run capitalism more &quot;efficiently&quot; and &quot;humanely&quot;. He is a member, and the former chairman, of Labour Friends of Israel.

In February 2009, Howells was appointed to the Privy Council, making him the Right Honourable Kim Howells, an appointment that coincided with the 20th anniversary of his election to Parliament.

In March 2009, it was revealed that Howells made one of the lowest expense claims among Welsh MPs, being 5th from bottom.

On 18 December 2009, Howells announced that he would stand down at the 2010 general election.

On 15 July 2011, Howells received an Honorary Doctorate for his contribution to Welsh and British politics from the University of Glamorgan. Following comments made by Howells concerning the financial reasons for recruiting students from overseas and, particularly, the perceived security risk appertaining to students from Libya, international students organised to demonstrate at the event. Howells withdrew from the ceremony at the last minute after pressure mounted on him. The NUS Wales Black Students&#x27; Campaign described Dr Howells&#x27; comments as &quot;reckless&quot; and said that the comments &quot;could add to the barriers facing Black and Minority Ethnic students in Wales&quot;.

===Parliamentary challenges===
In February 2006, he was the subject of a complaint from Paul Flynn MP after he mocked Mr Flynn&#x27;s attitude towards the UK&#x27;s Afghan drug policy:

On 22 November 2006, it was announced that on a recent visit to Iraq his helicopter was involved in an incident as it left the city of Basra with witnesses claiming shots were fired at the aircraft.

===Ministerial career===
Howells served in various ministerial capacities. Notable legislation he introduced included the Licensing Act 2003 and the Communications Act 2003.

===Personality===
Howells is known to be outspoken. He told &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper in September 1995 that devolution was akin to fascism and that it would lead to the &quot;Balkanisation of Great Britain&quot;.

In 2002, as a junior Minister at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, he criticised the Turner Prize by writing a note that read:

Throughout his Parliamentary career he was unafraid to speak his mind and often sparked strong criticism from those he criticised or offended. During a House of Commons debate on licensing laws he said that the idea of &quot;listening to three Somerset folk singers sounds like hell&quot;.

On the &quot;Today&quot; programme, while visiting Iraq on 11 March 2006 as Foreign Office minister, he commented in an interview:

On 22 July 2006, Howell criticised Israel&#x27;s bombardment of Lebanon while on a visit to Beirut, breaking with the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary&#x27;s less critical line, saying:
He once described the British royal family as &quot;a bit bonkers&quot;.

Howells said in 2013 that Labour had to change its relationship with the unions or face damaging its reputation and risk losing the next general election.

===Personal life===
Howells married Eirlys Davies in 1983. He has two sons and one stepdaughter.

<text>Operation Avalanche was a four-week U.S.-led aggression in December 2003 designed to disrupt a resurgence in insurgent activity in the southeastern territory of Afghanistan and to establish conditions for the provision of humanitarian aid. Described by the U.S. government as the biggest ground operation in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban in late 2001, the offensive led to the capture of more than 100 suspects and the deaths of 10. Two soldiers from the US backed Afghan National Army were killed. The operation was marred by the accidental killings of 15 children in raids on suspected insurgents. 

The operation involved 2,000 U.S. soldiers supported by Western backed Afghan troops, but failed to engage any Taliban or allied insurgents.

Patrols were conducted and caves searched over a 40 square mile (100 km2) area. Little of note was discovered in the caves.

<text>Mohsen Makhmalbaf (, &quot;Mohsen Makhmalbaaf&quot;; born May 29, 1957) is an Iranian film director, writer, film editor, and producer. He has made more than 20 feature films, won 50 awards, and served as a juror in more than 15 major film festivals. His award-winning films include &quot;Close-Up&quot; (1990) and &quot;Kandahar&quot;. His latest documentary is &quot;The Gardener&quot; and latest feature &quot;The President&quot;.

Makhmalbaf&#x27;s films have been widely presented at international film festivals since the early 21st century. The director belongs to the new wave movement of Iranian cinema. &quot;Time&quot; selected Makhmalbaf&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Kandahar&quot; as one of the top 100 films of all time. In 2006, he was a member of the Jury at the Venice Film Festival.

Makhmalbaf left Iran in 2005 shortly after the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He has lived in Paris since the events of the 2009 Iranian presidential election.

== Life ==

Makhmalbaf was born in Tehran on May 29, 1957. At the age of 15, he became involved in a militant group fighting against the rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran. At the age of 17, he was imprisoned for stabbing a policeman and was sentenced to death. After serving five years of his sentence, he was released in the wake of the Iranian Revolution. He left Iran in 2005.

==Career==
Makhmalbaf is a major figure in Iranian cinema. His films have explored the relationship between the individual and a larger social and political environment. As a result, his work serves as an extended commentary on the historical progression of the Iranian state and its people. Makhmalbaf has worked in several genres, from realist films to fantasy and surrealism, minimalism, and large frescoes of everyday life, with a preference (common to Iranian directors) for the themes of childhood and cinema.

In 1981, he wrote the screenplay for &quot;Towjeeh&quot;, directed by Manuchehr Haghaniparast. In 1982, he wrote the screenplay for &quot;Marg Deegari&quot;, directed by Mohammad-Reza Honarmand. He made his first film, &quot;Tobeh Nosuh&quot;, in 1983, and &quot;Boycott&quot;, a film set in pre-revolutionary Iran, in 1985. The latter tells the story of Valeh (Majid Majidi), a young man sentenced to death for Communist tendencies. It is widely believed to be based on Makhmalbaf&#x27;s own experiences.

Makhmalbaf portrays human despair, exploitation, and resilience in &quot;The Cyclist&quot; (1987), a movie about Nasim, a poor Afghan refugee in Iran in desperate need of money for his ailing wife. Nasim agrees to ride a bicycle in a small circle for one week for the money he needs to pay his wife&#x27;s medical bills.

In 1989, Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami read in the newspaper about an incident in which a Tehranian man named Hossain Sabzian tricked a family into believing he was Makhmalbaf. Kiarostami adapted the case as the 1990 docufiction film &quot;Close-Up&quot;, and recruited Makhmalbaf himself to appear in the final scene of the film. &quot;Close Up&quot; is now regarded as a masterpiece of world cinema and was voted by critics onto 2012&#x27;s &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; list of The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time.

&quot;Time of Love&quot; (1991) is Makhmalbaf&#x27;s ninth feature film. It is the first film of what he calls his &quot;third period&quot;. It is a romantic trilogy that offers three variations of the same story.
Makhmalbaf directed &quot;Gabbeh&quot; in 1996. The film follows the nomadic Ghashghai people, whose bright, bold carpets tell stories. The main thread features a young woman who loves a mysterious stranger but is forbidden to marry him. The film is romantic and non-realistic, with events seeming to leap around in time and space, much like a dream.

Makhmalbaf took time off from directing in 1996 to form the Makhmalbaf Film House, a school for young filmmakers. It quickly became a private production house for the increasing number of filmmakers in his family. In 1997, his 17-year-old daughter Samira directed &quot;The Apple&quot;, using him as a scriptwriter and editor. Makhmalbaf&#x27;s wife, Marziyeh Meshkini, worked as an assistant director to her daughter and then took up directing herself.

&quot;Kandahar&quot; (2001) is a fictional odyssey inspired by a true story set in Afghanistan before the September 11 attacks. The Taliban passed laws stripping women of civil rights and of their hopes for their futures. A Western-cultured Afghan woman returns to the country to prevent her sister&#x27;s suicide during the last eclipse of the 20th century.

==Early years of revolution==

In contrast to his later career, for about a decade after the revolution, Makhmalbaf expressed views and made films that served revolutionary art in the cultural atmosphere of Iran. 

Some pre-revolutionary filmmakers note there were celebrities hurt by Makhmalbaf&#x27;s positions in this period. Saeed Motalebi, an established writer and director before the revolution, is one of the people who has repeatedly recounted stories about how Makhmalbaf&#x27;s stances affected pre-revolutionary stars. One of these accounts refers to the 1982 film &quot;The Imperilled&quot; (Barzakhi-ha) written by Motalebi and had four pre-revolutionary male stars in the lead roles. It was directed by Iraj Ghaderi and, with its patriotic story about resisting foreign invasion, it was a chance for Fardin, Malek-Motiei, Ghaderi and Rad to renew their threatened careers as actors in the post-revolutionary atmosphere. The film was a hit and became the highest-grossing Iranian film of all time in its short period of theater screening. But it was soon banned, and consequently the four actors were banned from working. 

Motalebi says that Makhmalbaf turned people against the film and its actors:
In one Friday Mr. Mohsen Makhmalbaf gathered a couple of people and they started collecting signatures for a petition which was written on a scroll, stating that &quot;We have made a revolution while these actors are transgressors.&quot; They did it right in front of that theater in the Revolution Square near the university of Tehran. They said &quot;Look how theaters are crowded while Friday events are deserted.&quot; That&#x27;s how they stopped my film.
Then a reporter who was cued to ask something about our film, went and told the then prime minister (Mir-Hossein Mousavi) &quot;There is a film in theaters whose writer wants to convey that people who are fighting in the fronts are problematic persons.&quot; The prime minister replied, &quot;These are leftovers of junk intellectuals who will soon go to the dustbin of history.&quot; Malek-Motiei became jobless and turned his garage into a pastry shop. Ghaderi put some rice bags in his office and became a rice dealer. Fardin opened a pastry shop too and when I visited him, I used to wait outside as long as there were no customers so that he wouldn&#x27;t feel ashamed when he saw me. These were all caused by those illogical efforts, which I will never forgive.

In a 1986 letter by Makhmalbaf, he attacks such filmmakers as Dariush Mehrjui and Ali Hatami. Addressing Mohammad Beheshti Shirazi, then head of Farabi Cinema Foundation, which was Iran&#x27;s main governmental film production company, Makhmalbaf says: &quot;Two hours ago when I saw The Lodgers I was ready to attach a grenade to myself and hold Mehrjui to take both of us to the other world.&quot;

In later years, Makhmalbaf became deeply disillusioned, first by the Islamic regime, and soon after by Islamic ideology. By the early 1990s, he was one of the most outspoken critics of the government in Iran. Amir-Hossein Fardi, a writer and Makhmalbaf&#x27;s former colleague, has said that Makhmalbaf has not changed and that his inalterable characteristic has been an extremist attitude, then pro-revolution, and now anti-revolution.

==Political views==
In December 2023, together with 50 other filmmakers, Makhmalbaf signed an open letter published in &quot;Libération&quot;, demanding a ceasefire and an end to the killing of civilians amid the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip. They asked for a humanitarian corridor into Gaza to be established for humanitarian aid, and the release of hostages.

<doc id="416990" wikidata="Q7271932" url="?curid=416990" title="Quiggins">
<text>Quiggins was an indoor market within Liverpool city centre. The market, which was home to many small &#x27;alternative&#x27; stores, was located in adjacent three warehouse buildings on a site between School Lane, Peters Lane and College Lane. The main entrance was through the 1866 Palatine Building. Although Quiggins markets existed at several locations within Liverpool, these premises were the most well known in the city.

The market closed in 2006 in order to be redeveloped as part of a massive development of Liverpool City Centre by the Grosvenor Group.

==History==
The business&#x27;s first location was on Renshaw Street which opened in 1986, where it adopted the name of the long established architectural ironmongers which had formerly owned the premises and whose sign still adorned the shop front.
Originally established as an antiques business, it outgrew the building and in 1988 moved to a larger location on School Lane. With parts of the building rented out to other antique traders, it later diversified into providing space for specialist and alternative stores where many of the stall holders were local artists and craftsmen. There Quiggins soon became a significant part of Liverpool&#x27;s cultural scene. Next to the Bluecoat Centre and only two blocks from the busiest pedestrian traffic on Merseyside, it was seen as an ideal place to trade and congregate.

It was also the home of &quot;Fraggle Radio&quot;, an internet based station streaming rock and punk music founded by Dave Carter and Terry Harris, and the popular Brook Café provided a late night venue for live alternative music.

==Closure==
As part of its Capital of Culture bid, Liverpool City Council drew up the Bluecoat Triangle plan, later to become the Paradise Street Development Scheme, to boost the retail and cultural areas in the city centre, one aspect of which was the proposed acquisition of the building containing Quiggins Centre. Many local residents and businesses lodged objections to these proposals and a well-publicised four-year public relations and political campaign was launched against the plans spearheaded by Peter Tierney, (co-owner &amp; founder) and his supporters. These included a protest march, a petition with over a hundred and fifty thousand signatures presented to Parliament, letter writing and media events, etc.

A Public Inquiry was held in September to November 2003, at which fifty objectors to the scheme were heard, Quiggins being prominent among them. Noted barrister specialising in planning issues, Mr Robert McCracken QC led for Quiggins; Mr. David Elvin QC for Liverpool Council and Grosvenor Estates. On the Quiggins&#x27; team were Peter Tierney (also known as Peter Quiggins), &#x27;Save Quiggins&#x27; campaign manager, researches, urban renewal consultants, planning consultants and other experts and supporters.

Following the hearing, the Planning Inspector, Derek Mumford upheld the proposed CPOs and on 18 May 2004, the development scheme was approved by John Prescott, the British Deputy Prime Minister. This resulted in the issuance of CPOs against several businesses in the development area, including that of Quiggins. A further vigorous campaign was launched in the Spring of 2006 by the owners Quiggins and its supporter. However last-ditch negotiations between the partners and with the developer, Grosvenor Estates in June 2006, apparently led to a hostile take over by the younger brother which contributed to collapsing the Quiggins&#x27; challenge.

The CPO was then executed, which reputedly granted Quiggins a compensation claim of £1.2M before legal costs and tax. On 1 July 2006 Quiggins closed its doors for the last time at the School Lane site. By early 2007 the buildings had been demolished except for the retained ornate facade at the corner of School Lane (Palatine Building) which has been re-used by the Liverpool One development as part of a street of boutiques between Church Street and Paradise Street which opened in late 2008.

==Later development==
Following the compulsory purchase and closure of the School Lane site a number of store owners re-opened at the Grand Central Hall in Renshaw Street, under the banner &quot;Quiggins at Grand Central&quot;, retaining the alternative store/indoor market ethos. Sadly though, this building&#x27;s operations as Quiggins had ceased in 2018, the site Grand Central Hall is currently &#x27;The New Liverpool Grand Central Hotel&#x27; (this closure was spearheaded by the Smokie Mo&#x27;s landowners). 

Meanwhile, in late 2006 Peter Tierney opened &#x27;Quiggins AttiQue&#x27; in Aigburth, South Liverpool, and continues trading from there while planning a return to Liverpool City Centre retailing. Continuing its ethos of helping small independent businesses gain a strong foothold under the &quot;Quiggins&quot; banner, it had long been Quiggins&#x27; intention to acquire the lease to the John Lewis Store (formerly George Henry-Lee) on Church Street, and lengthy negotiations took place with Grosvenor and City Council in an attempt to achieve this. However an announcement on 1 October 2007 declared that Rapid Hardware would take over the premises in 2011.

In May 2012 Tierney stood as National Front candidate in the Liverpool Mayoral elections, polling 566 votes. In November that year the traders at Grand Central dropped &quot;Quiggins&quot; as part of their title, though a spokesman claimed this was an unrelated action.

<text>Măcin () is a town in Tulcea County, in the Northern Dobruja region of Romania.

==Location==
Măcin is located in the north-western part of the Northern Dobruja region, in Tulcea County. The city is located at the intersection of the DN22 (E87) and national roads. The DN22 road links it to the Romanian capital, Bucharest (230 km to the West, via Brăila) and to cities of Isaccea and Tulcea (to the East). The DN22D road connects Măcin through a southern route with Tulcea and Constanța. 

==Demographics==

According to the 2011 census, the town&#x27;s population numbered 7,666 inhabitants, composed of 91.46% Romanians, 4.8% Roma, 2.92% Turks, and 0.37% Russian Lipovans. At the 2021 census, Măcin had a population of 7,248; of those, 75.95% were Romanians, 5.66% Roma, and 1.93% Turks.

==History==
The town is located on an ancient Celtic settlement, named &quot;Arrubium&quot;. It was included in the Getic polities of Rhemaxos and Zyraxes, then conquered by the Roman Empire, who stationed a cavalry unit here between 99 and 241 AD. The ruins of the Roman fort of Arrubium can be seen today on the top of the Cetate Hill. Part of the Bulgarian, Byzantine, and later Ottoman Empire, the locality was included for some time in the Wallachian and Moldavian &quot;voivodates&quot;.

It was the site of the Battle of Măcin in 1791.

==Economy==
The main share of the local economy is taken by agriculture, especially animal husbandry, cereal growing and in less extent, fishing. The local industry is centered on surface mining, mainly extraction of granite rocks, from quarries situated on southern slopes of Măcin Mountains; textile and clothing manufacturing are also relatively well represented. A significant proportion of the area&#x27;s population (especially women) is still involved in the textile industry. There is also a factory producing electrostatic air purifiers and ventilation systems.

Since the mid-2000s, the wine industry has grown in importance, with new vineyards being planted on Carcaliu Hill along the DJ222L road, six kilometers outside city limits to the southeast. The local wine producer sells on the national and foreign markets white and red wines with the &quot;D.O.C.&quot; designation, &quot;Controlled term of origin&quot;, from Sarica-Niculițel region.

Măcin has also an &quot;inland port&quot; on the Danube, operated by two local fixed cranes and sometimes depending on the freight fluxes, by additional floating cranes brought in from Brăila. The port has grain-handling and some warehousing facilities.

<doc id="416998" wikidata="Q201882" url="?curid=416998" title="Richard Roeper">
<text>Richard E. Roeper (born October 17, 1959) is an American columnist and film critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. He co-hosted the television series &quot;At the Movies&quot; with Roger Ebert from 2000 to 2008, serving as the late Gene Siskel&#x27;s successor. From 2010 to 2014, he co-hosted &quot;The Roe and Roeper Show&quot; with Roe Conn on WLS-AM. From October 2015 to October 2017, Roeper served as the host of the FOX 32 morning show &quot;Good Day Chicago.&quot;

==Early life==
Roeper was born in Chicago, Illinois, one of four children to Robert and Margaret (nee Slobatec) Roeper. He grew up in south suburban Dolton, Illinois and attended Thornridge High School before graduating from Illinois State University in 1982 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism. While still a student at the university, he auditioned for the movie review program &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; when Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert (his future co-host on &quot;At the Movies&quot;) left the program, for which he was turned down.

==Career==
Roeper began working as a columnist for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; in 1986. The topics of his columns ranged from politics to media to entertainment. He has been voted the best columnist in Illinois by the Associated Press on numerous occasions.

He has also written seven books on topics ranging from movies to urban legends to conspiracy theories to the Chicago White Sox. In 2009, Roeper appeared on Howard Stern&#x27;s show and said he had written a book on gambling, entitled &quot;Bet the House&quot;, which was released in the first quarter of 2010.

Roeper was a radio host on WLS AM 890 in Chicago. He also hosted shows on WLUP-FM, WLS-FM, and WMVP-AM in Chicago.In the early 2000s, he was the film critic for CBS in Chicago for three years.

His columns have been syndicated by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to worldwide publications. Roeper has written for a number of magazines, including &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Spy&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. In 2001, he was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s most eligible bachelors.

Roeper has been a frequent guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, and countless other national programs. He also hosted &quot;Starz Inside&quot;, a monthly documentary series that aired on the Starz network. Roeper appeared on the first episode of the fifth season of &quot;Entourage&quot;, where he reviewed a fake movie titled &quot;Medellin&quot; with Michael Phillips on &quot;At the Movies&quot;. In April 2008, Roeper was the central figure on an episode of &quot;Top Chef&quot;, where contestants served up movie-themed dishes to Roeper and his friends (including Aisha Tyler).

In February 2009, Roeper launched his website, which features movie reviews, blog entries, photos, and Twitter posts. In December 2009, he launched a video section that featured on-camera reviews of movies. The video segments were originally produced in partnership with the Starz premium cable channel. Roeper announced that the reviews would appear first on his site, then on the Starz channel.

In December 2009, it was reported that Roeper had signed with ReelzChannel to be a regular contributor. Beginning in December 2010, Roeper began producing video reviews for ReelzChannel. He stopped reviewing movies for ReelzChannel in February 2015; his final review was for the Jude Law disaster film &quot;Black Sea&quot;.

From April 12, 2010, to October 7, 2014, he co-hosted &quot;The Roe &amp; Roeper Show&quot; with Roe Conn on Chicago&#x27;s WLS 890 radio station from 2-6 pm CST.

In October 2015, Roeper joined the cast of the Fox Chicago morning TV show &quot;Good Day Chicago&quot;. He signed off from that morning TV show on October 18, 2017.

Roeper was suspended from the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; on January 29, 2018, pending an investigation into allegations that he had purchased Twitter followers. On February 2, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; released a statement stating that their investigation did find that Roeper purchased over 25,000 fake followers. The paper later reinstated him, though he was required to begin using a new account on which he was explicitly disallowed from buying followers.

===Film critic===
After Gene Siskel of &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; died on February 20, 1999, Roger Ebert co-hosted the show with nearly 30 guest critics. After ten appearances on the program, Roeper was offered the opportunity to co-host the popular film review show with Ebert permanently. The series was renamed &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper and the Movies&quot; in 2000. The title was shortened to &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot; in 2001. Before this, he conducted an interview in 1995 with Siskel and Ebert to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their partnership.

Beginning in August 2006, while his co-host Roger Ebert was recovering from cancer surgery, Roeper was joined by numerous guest critics, including &quot;Clerks&quot; director Kevin Smith, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; host Jay Leno, and singer-songwriter John Mellencamp. On Sunday, July 20, 2008, Roeper announced that he was leaving the show in mid-August and would return with a new show later in the year. However, plans for a new program starring Roeper failed to materialize.

Between 2009 and late 2010, Roeper contributed video reviews to Starz. In December 2010, he moved to ReelzChannel, where he contributed a segment titled &quot;Richard Roeper&#x27;s Reviews&quot; every weekday at 5:00 pm ET. Roeper remained with the network until early 2015. In early 2013, Roeper began contributing film reviews to &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot;. On September 12, 2013, it was announced that Roeper will replace Roger Ebert as the main movie critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; after his death on April 4, 2013 at the age of 70. In August 2014, Roeper became first-string film critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, where he made his debut reviewing &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;. He is a member of Chicago Film Critics Association.

==Preferences==
===Favorites===
Roeper has cited &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, &quot;The Godfather&quot; trilogy, and &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; as among his favorite films. On &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; he stated that, &quot;It has one of the highest &#x27;repeatability&#x27; factors of any film I&#x27;ve ever seen...I can watch it again and again. There&#x27;s also this, and I say in all sincerity: &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; is something of a suicide prevention film or, at the very least, a story about a young man trying to help his friend gain some measure of self-worth...Ferris has made it his mission to show Cameron that the whole world in front of him is passing him by and that life can be pretty sweet if you wake up and embrace it. That&#x27;s the lasting message of &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;.&quot; Roeper pays homage to the film with a license plate that says &quot;SVFRRIS&quot;. 

In a 2000 interview, he cited Woody Allen as a hero of filmmaking. Among his favorite films from the 1990s are &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot;, &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, and &quot;Notting Hill&quot;. In November 2004, on a special segment of &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot;, Roeper stated that his all-time favorite film about Thanksgiving is &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot;.

<doc id="417004" wikidata="Q2525174" url="?curid=417004" title="The Falls (1980 film)">
<text>The Falls is a 1980 film directed by Peter Greenaway. It was Greenaway&#x27;s first feature-length film after many years making shorts. It does not have a traditional dramatic narrative; it takes the form of a mock documentary in 92 short parts.

==Plot==
The world has been struck by a mysterious incident called the &quot;Violent Unknown Event&quot; or VUE, which has killed many people and left a great many survivors suffering from a common set of symptoms: mysterious ailments (some appearing to be mutations of evolving into a bird-like form), dreaming of water (categorised by form, such as Category 1, Flight, or Category 3, Waves) and becoming obsessed with birds and flight. Many of the survivors have been gifted with new languages. They have also stopped ageing, making them immortal (barring disease or injury).

A directory of these survivors has been compiled, and &quot;The Falls&quot; is presented as a film version of an excerpt from that directory, corresponding to the 92 entries for persons whose surnames begin with the letters FALL-. Not all of the 92 entries correspond to a person – some correspond to deleted entries, cross references and other oddities of the administrative process that has produced the directory. One biography concerns two people – the twin brothers Ipson and Pulat Fallari, who are played (in still photographs) by the Brothers Quay.

&quot;The Falls&quot; includes clips of a number of Greenaway&#x27;s early shorts. It also anticipates some of his later films: the subject of biography 27, Propine Fallax, is a pseudonym for Cissie Colpitts, the central figure of &quot;Drowning by Numbers&quot; (1988), while the car accident in biography 28 prefigures that in &quot;A Zed and Two Noughts&quot; (1985).

The largely formal and deadpan manner of the narration contrasts with the absurdity of the content.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack is mainly by Michael Nyman and is partly based, like his later music for &quot;Drowning by Numbers&quot;, on the slow movement of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra K. 364&quot;. It also includes numerous clips from various songs popular among the avant-garde of the time, including pieces by Brian Eno (in particular &quot;Golden Hours&quot; from Another Green World) and snippets of &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;, the last song Syd Barrett recorded with Pink Floyd.

==Reception==
&quot;The Falls&quot; has an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with Nathan Lee of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; calling it &quot;the most playful and engaging of Greenaway&#x27;s compositions&quot;.

Vincent Canby writing in the &quot;New York Times&quot; gave &quot;The Falls&quot; a mostly positive review, saying &#x27;though &quot;The Falls&quot; is much too long for its own good, its rewards are real&#x27;.

<text>The Macintosh LC II is a personal computer designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer from March 1992 to March 1993. The LC II succeeded the LC which would be discontinued, replacing its Motorola 68020 processor with a 68030 and increasing the onboard memory to 4 MB. The LC II was priced at US$1,699, fully $800 less than the original LC when it was introduced.

In September 1992, Apple introduced the Macintosh Performa family of consumer-oriented computers. The LC II was repackaged as the Performa 400. When LC II was succeeded by the Macintosh LC III in early 1993, the LC II continued to be sold in some markets for some time after that. In North America, although the use of the LC II branding ceased, two new Performa models (the 405 and 430) were introduced in its place. In October, the Performa 400, 405 and 430 were all discontinued and a new LC II-based model called the Performa 410 was introduced which became Apple&#x27;s new entry-level computer.

The LC II was Apple&#x27;s highest-selling Macintosh product in 1992.

== Overview ==
The LC II retains the original LC&#x27;s 16-bit system bus and 10 MB RAM limit, making its performance roughly the same as the earlier model. The main benefit of the 68030 processor in the LC II is its onboard paged memory management unit, which System 7 uses to enable its new virtual memory feature. Apple had opted to get a quick update to the LC out the door instead of spending the additional time required to do a full architectural update, which would happen the following year with the Macintosh LC III. Speed tests often found that the LC II was often slightly slower than the preceding LC. 

The LC II was sold at the same time as the Macintosh IIsi, which was more than $800 more expensive than the LC II, but did not have its 10 MB memory limit, 16-bit data bus, and mono audio output. The IIsi also includes a NuBus expansion slot that the LC II lacks, and can be powered on via a button on the keyboard, unlike the LC range which has a power switch on the back of the unit.

== Hardware ==
Case: The LC II retains its predecessor&#x27;s pizza box form factor. The design was updated during the LC II&#x27;s production run when the auto-inject floppy drive was substituted for a manual-inject unit, while the revised front bezel no longer featured the horizontal indentation aligning with the floppy drive, a defining characteristic of the Snow White design language.

Logic board: The LC II retains much of the original LC&#x27;s logic board design, including a 16-bit data path and a 10 MB memory limit. These limitations limited the machine&#x27;s ability to take full advantage of the 68030 CPU.

Storage: The LC II shipped with one floppy drive as standard, with options for 40 or 80 MB hard drives. While the original LC had two internal floppy drive connectors, the LC II has one. About 5% of the LC units sold had two floppy drives, and internal hard disks were becoming common by 1992, so the second connector was removed.

Video: The LC II&#x27;s logic board has one video RAM slot, which is filled with a 256 KB SIMM as standard; the high-end configuration was shipped with a 512 KB SIMM instead. VRAM SIMMs from the original LC are supported in the LC II.

Upgrades: Apple sold a $599 upgrade kit that replaced the LC II&#x27;s logic board with that of the LC III.

<text>Paul Andrew O&#x27;Neill (born February 25, 1963) is an American former baseball right fielder who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the Cincinnati Reds (1985–1992) and New York Yankees (1993–2001). O&#x27;Neill compiled 281 home runs, 1,269 runs batted in, 2,107 hits, and a lifetime batting average of .288. He won the American League batting title in 1994 with a .359 average. He was a five-time World Series champion and a five-time All-Star (1991, 1994, 1995, 1997, and 1998).

O&#x27;Neill is the only player to have played on the winning team in three perfect games. He was in right field for the Reds for Tom Browning&#x27;s perfect game in 1988. He caught the final out (a fly ball) in the Yankees&#x27; David Wells&#x27; perfect game in 1998, and he made a diving catch in right field and doubled to help the Yankees win David Cone&#x27;s perfect game in 1999. After retiring from playing baseball, O&#x27;Neill became a broadcaster for the Yankees on the YES Network. He currently works on the network as the lead game analyst and color commentator.

==Early life==
Paul Andrew O&#x27;Neill was born on February 25, 1963, in Columbus, Ohio. O&#x27;Neill and his family were fans of the Cincinnati Reds. His older sister was Molly O&#x27;Neill (1952-2019), a chef, cookbook author, and food writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. O&#x27;Neill attended Brookhaven High School.
He played baseball and basketball. In basketball, O&#x27;Neill earned all-state honors in his senior year 1981 and Central District Player of the Year.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
O&#x27;Neill was drafted by the Reds in the fourth round of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft.

===Cincinnati Reds (1985–1992)===
O&#x27;Neill made his Major League debut on September 3, 1985, and singled in his first at-bat. For the rest of the 1985 season, O&#x27;Neill played in five games with four hits and one RBI. He spent most of the 1986 season in the minors. He played only in three games with the Major League team during 1986 and did not get a hit in the majors that year. O&#x27;Neill split his time between the minors and the MLB team in 1987. He appeared in 84 games for the Reds that year, batting .256 with seven home runs and 28 RBIs.
In 1988, his first full season with the Reds, O&#x27;Neill played 145 games, batting .252 with 16 home runs and 73 RBIs. O&#x27;Neill played 117 games in 1989, batting .276 with 15 home runs and 74 RBIs. In 1989, O&#x27;Neill had a similar statistical line, batting .276 on the year with 15 home runs and 74 RBIs. On July 5, he famously kicked a ball back into the infield after he bobbled it in shallow right, preventing a runner from second from scoring on the play (a single). The play is referenced on his Baseball-Reference page, where his characteristics are listed as &quot;Bats: Left, Throws: Left, Kicks: Left&quot;.

In 1990, O&#x27;Neill played in 145 games, batting .270 with 16 home runs and 78 RBIs. O&#x27;Neill batted .277 during the 1990 postseason with a home run and five RBIs as the Reds won the World Series over the Oakland Athletics. O&#x27;Neill clashed with Reds manager Lou Piniella, who wanted O&#x27;Neill to change his swing to hit more home runs. In response to the clash, O&#x27;Neill improved greatly in 1991 by playing 152 games with a career high of 28 home runs. He batted .256 with 91 RBIs, as well. In his final season as a member of the Reds, O&#x27;Neill played in 148 games, batting .246 with 14 home runs and 66 RBIs.

===New York Yankees (1993–2001)===
On November 3, 1992, the Reds traded O&#x27;Neill to the Yankees for Roberto Kelly. In his first season as a Yankee, O&#x27;Neill played 141 games batting .311 with 20 home runs and 75 RBIs. During the strike-shortened 1994 season, O&#x27;Neill played 103 games with a .359 batting average, 21 home runs, and 83 RBIs, which led him to be selected to his second All-Star game. O&#x27;Neill won the batting title, and the Yankees led the East Division by six and a half games when the players&#x27; strike ended the season. He signed a four-year, $19 million contract. In 1995, O&#x27;Neill played in 127 games, batting .300 with 22 home runs, 96 RBIs, and an MLB-leading 25 double plays committed. He led the Yankees to the postseason for the first time since 1981, but they lost to the Seattle Mariners in the division series despite winning the first two games.
On April 30, 1996, O&#x27;Neill hit a long home run to Eutaw Street off of Arthur Rhodes while playing at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. O&#x27;Neill famously was his own toughest critic, seemingly never satisfied with his own performance and known for his emotion on the field; when disappointed with his performance or angry with an umpire&#x27;s decision, he would attack water coolers or toss bats on the field. His tirades were both praised and criticized by the media and fans. O&#x27;Neill was involved in a brawl with Seattle catcher John Marzano. O&#x27;Neill had complained to the umpire that the previous pitch was high and inside. Marzano then hit the much bigger Paul O&#x27;Neill with a haymaker. The two grappled, and the benches cleared. During the 1996 season, O&#x27;Neill played in 150 games, batting .302 with 19 home runs, 91 RBIs, and a career-high 102 walks. He ended Game 5 of the 1996 World Series by robbing former Yankee teammate Luis Polonia of the Atlanta Braves of an extra-base hit, preserving a 1–0 victory for the Yankees. The Yankees then won the series, which was their first World Series championship since 1978.

In 1997, O&#x27;Neill played in 149 games, batting .324 with 21 home runs and 117 RBIs. He led the Yankees into the postseason again, batting .421 with two home runs and seven RBIs, but they lost the division series to the Cleveland Indians. In 1998, O&#x27;Neill played in 152 games, batting .317 with 24 home runs and 116 RBIs. He led the AL by grounding into 22 double plays. O&#x27;Neill led the Yankees into the World Series where they won against the San Diego Padres in a four-game sweep and helped the team win a record 125 games. In 1999, O&#x27;Neill played in 153 games, batting .285 with 19 home runs and 110 RBIs. O&#x27;Neill played Game 4 of the 1999 World Series just hours after his father died. The Yankees eventually won the game and swept the Braves to win their 25th World Series championship.

In 2000, O&#x27;Neill played in 142 games, batting .283 with 18 home runs and 100 RBIs. He led the Yankees to the postseason again as they won the World Series over the New York Mets. In 2001, O&#x27;Neill played in 137 games, batting .267 with 21 home runs and 70 RBIs. In Game 5 of the 2001 World Series, O&#x27;Neill received a sendoff from New York fans. While standing in right field in the 9th inning with the Yankees down 2–0, the entire stadium chanted his name. When the inning ended, O&#x27;Neill was still being cheered. With tears in his eyes, he tipped his cap, and another roar went up from the crowd at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees won the game 3–2, but they lost the series four games to three.

==Legacy==

Yankee owner George Steinbrenner labeled O&#x27;Neill as a &quot;Warrior.&quot; He was given this nickname due to his passion and love for the game. Since his retirement after the 2001 World Series, his number 21 was only worn once, when relief pitcher LaTroy Hawkins briefly wore the number to start the 2008 season. On April 16, 2008, Hawkins switched to number 22 in response to the criticism he received by many Yankee fans.

The Yankees honored O&#x27;Neill with a plaque in Monument Park on August 9, 2014. The Yankees retired O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s number 21 on August 21, 2022, at Yankee Stadium. Because O&#x27;Neill had not been vaccinated against COVID-19, the team had to make changes to the retirement ceremony to comply with its health protocols; no current Yankees joined O&#x27;Neill on the field, and he did not visit any of the broadcast booths during the game.

==Television==

In 1995, while still a player for the Yankees, O&#x27;Neill had a cameo role on the NBC sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. In the episode &quot;The Wink&quot;, Cosmo Kramer approaches O&#x27;Neill in the Yankees&#x27; locker room and says that he must hit two home runs in the next game to fulfill the wish of a sick little boy. In the ensuing game, which is entirely offscreen, O&#x27;Neill hits one home run and achieves an inside-the-park home run which is scored a triple due to the other team&#x27;s error. Though &quot;The Wink&quot; was the fourth episode broadcast during &quot;Seinfeld&quot;″s seventh season, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s scene was the first scene filmed for that season. He is also mentioned in the &quot;Friends&quot; episode &quot;The One with Rachel&#x27;s Big Kiss&quot;.

===Broadcasting career (2002–present)===
Starting after his retirement from baseball in 2001, O&#x27;Neill serves as an analyst on the &quot;New York Yankees Pre-Game Show&quot; and the &quot;New York Yankees Post-Game Show&quot;, as well as a color commentator for the YES Network. O&#x27;Neill returned to Ohio to live with his family.

On July 7, 2009, O&#x27;Neill was inducted into the Irish-American Baseball Hall of Fame (18 W. 33rd St. inside Foley&#x27;s NY Pub &amp; Restaurant) in New York City along with longtime Los Angeles Dodgers owner Walter O&#x27;Malley, broadcaster Vin Scully, former player Steve Garvey, umpire Jim Joyce, and blind sports reporter Ed Lucas.

During the 2020 and 2021 seasons, due to social-distancing requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic, O&#x27;Neill participated in Yankees broadcasts remotely from a basement studio nicknamed &quot;Studio 21&quot; in his Ohio home.

During the 2022 season, the Yankees relaxed their social-distancing requirements, but O&#x27;Neill continued to call games remotely from Studio 21. The &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that this is because he had not been vaccinated against COVID-19. Despite this, he did appear in person for his number retirement ceremony in August 2022. O&#x27;Neill returned to the YES broadcast booth during the 2023 season after the company relaxed its vaccine requirements.

==Writing==
After retiring from his playing career, O&#x27;Neill authored a book entitled &quot;Me and My Dad: A Baseball Memoir&quot;. The book discusses his relationship with his father, who instilled in him a love for the game of baseball.

In 2022, O&#x27;Neill released &quot;Swing and a Hit: Nine Innings of What Baseball Taught Me&quot;, written with Jack Curry.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Neill and his wife, Nevalee, were neighbors in Columbus. They have three children, and live in Montgomery, Ohio. His nephew, Michael, also played baseball in the Yankees organization.

At a press conference in Jupiter, Florida, in March 2016, O&#x27;Neill endorsed Donald Trump for president.

<text>Copșa Mică (; ) is a town in Sibiu County, Transylvania, Romania, located north of Sibiu, 33 km east of Blaj, and 12 km southwest of Mediaș. It is on the route of the Via Transilvanica long-distance trail.

== Economy ==

=== The Copșa Mică gas field ===
The Copșa Mică gas field is a natural gas field located in the town. Discovered in 1915 and developed by Romgaz, it began production in 1920 and produces natural gas and condensates. On July 13, 1933, the biggest fire in the history of Romania occurred at a gas well here, with the flames reaching a height of . The fire was put out by the military after 7 years, and completely extinguished only in 1947.

=== The Copșa Mică works ===
The 1933 fire at the gas field led to the creation of a carbon black factory at Copșa Mică. The town is best known for its status (dating to the 1990s) as one of the most polluted in Europe; in fact, at some point it was the second most polluted after Chernobyl.

This was due to the emissions of two factories in the area:

* One, open from 1935 to 1993, produced carbon black for dyes; its emissions permeated the area for nearly sixty years, leaving soot on homes, trees, animals, and everything else in the area. The stain from these decades of deposits are still visible.
* The other source of the pollution, less visible but with even more serious effects to the health of the town&#x27;s residents, was Sometra, a smelter whose emissions have contributed to significantly higher incidence of lung disease and impotence, along with a life expectancy nine years below Romania&#x27;s average.

== Demographics ==
The town&#x27;s population of 5,201 (as of 2011) is significantly lower compared to its previous level in 1989, the year communism collapsed in Romania. At the 2011 census, 78.8% of inhabitants were Romanians, 11.9% Roma, and 8.7% Hungarians. At the 2021 census, Copșa Mică had a population of 4,570, of which 77.13% were Romanians, 4.81% Hungarians, and 4% Roma.

== Administration and local politics ==

=== Town council ===
The town&#x27;s current local council has the following political composition, according to the results of the 2020 Romanian local elections:

== Natives ==

<doc id="417013" wikidata="Q265546" url="?curid=417013" title="A Scandal in Bohemia">
<text>&quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; is the first short story, and the third overall work, featuring Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. It is the first of the 56 Holmes short stories written by Doyle and the first of 38 Sherlock Holmes works illustrated by Sidney Paget. The story is notable for introducing the character of Irene Adler, who is one of the most notable female characters in the Sherlock Holmes series, despite appearing in only one story. Doyle ranked &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; fifth in his list of his twelve favourite Holmes stories.

&quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; was first published on 25 June 1891 in the July issue of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, and was the first of the stories collected in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in 1892.

==Plot==
The Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and hereditary King of Bohemia visits 221B Baker Street. The King explains that, five years earlier, he engaged in a secret relationship with American opera singer Irene Adler. He is set to marry a young Scandinavian princess but worries that her family will call the marriage off should they learn of this impropriety. The King seeks to regain a photograph of Adler and himself together which he gave to her as a token and which she now threatens to send to his fiancée&#x27;s family.

The next morning, a disguised Holmes follows Adler and her soon to be husband Norton to a nearby church, where he is unexpectedly asked to be a witness to their wedding. Shortly afterwards, Holmes and Watson not only convince Adler to let Holmes into her home under a disguise, but fake a fire within her home leading her to reveal where the photo was hidden. That night after slipping away from Adler&#x27;s home, Holmes and Watson request that the King arrive at Adler&#x27;s home in the morning.

When Holmes, Watson, and the King arrive at Adler&#x27;s house the next morning to retrieve the photograph, her elderly maidservant informs them Adler had left the country via train earlier that morning. Holmes goes to the photograph&#x27;s hiding spot, finding a photo of Irene Adler in an evening dress and a letter addressed to him. In the letter, Adler tells Holmes she has left England with Norton and promises she will not compromise the King.

Watson concludes the story by noting that Holmes always referred to Adler by the honourable title of &quot;&quot;the&quot; woman.&quot;

==Holmes&#x27; relationship to Adler==
Adler earns Holmes&#x27; unbounded admiration. When the King of Bohemia says, &quot;Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity she was not on my level?&quot; Holmes replies that Adler is indeed on a much different level from the King, implying that she was superior to the King all along.

The beginning of &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; describes the high regard in which Holmes held Adler:

This &quot;memory&quot; is kept alive by a photograph of Irene Adler, which had been deliberately left behind when she and her new husband took flight with the embarrassing photograph of her with the King. Holmes had then asked for and received this photo from the King, as payment for his work on the case. In &quot;The Five Orange Pips&quot; he comments to a client that he has been defeated on a mere handful of occasions and only once by a woman.

In derivative works, she is frequently used as a romantic interest for Holmes, a departure from Doyle&#x27;s novels where he only admired her for her wit and cunning. In his &quot;Sherlock Holmes Handbook&quot;, Christopher Redmond notes &quot;the Canon provides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes-Adler connection.&quot;

==Publication history==
&quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in July 1891, and in the United States in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in August 1891. The story was published with ten illustrations by Sidney Paget in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in October 1892.

==Adaptations==
===Stage===
William Gillette&#x27;s 1899 stage play &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; is based on several stories, among them &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;. Films released in 1916 (starring Gillette as Holmes) and 1922 (starring John Barrymore), both titled &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, were based on the play, as was a 1938 &quot;Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; radio adaptation titled &quot;The Immortal Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Orson Welles as Holmes.

The 1965 Broadway musical &quot;Baker Street&quot; was loosely based on the story, making Irene Adler into the heroine and adding Professor Moriarty as the villain.

Steven Dietz&#x27;s 2006 play &quot;Sherlock Holmes: The Final Adventure&quot;, adapted from the 1899 play &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, merges the storylines of &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; and &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. In this adaptation, Godfrey Norton is under the employ of Professor Moriarty and whose original plan was to rob Adler. However, they ended up falling in love, complicating the plan and forcing Moriarty to intervene when Holmes begins investigating on behalf of the King.

===Film===
The story was adapted as a 1921 silent short film as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Holmes.

The 1946 film &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;, starring Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson, features several references to &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, with Holmes and Watson discussing the recent publication of the story in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; (albeit anachronistically, the film takes place in its current day), and the villain of the film using the same trick on Watson that Holmes uses on Irene Adler in the story.

&quot;The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes&#x27; Smarter Brother&quot;, a 1975 Gene Wilder film, parodies the basic storyline, with the female lead replaced with a music hall singer.

The 1998 film &quot;Zero Effect&quot; is loosely based on the story, set in late 90s America, with Bill Pullman as Daryl Zero and Ben Stiller as Steve Arlo, both based on the Holmes and Watson characters, respectively. Kim Dickens plays Gloria Sullivan, the Irene Adler character, while Ryan O&#x27;Neal is Gregory Stark, the King of Bohemia equivalent.

===Radio===
The second episode of &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; featured an adaptation by Edith Meiser of the story on 27 October 1930 and starred Clive Brook as Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Watson. A remake of the script aired in March 1933, with Richard Gordon playing Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell again playing Dr. Watson. Another remake of the script aired in August 1936, with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson.

Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, who played Holmes and Watson in the film &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; and other films, did the story for their radio series, &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode aired on 10 December 1945, and was followed by a sequel, &quot;Second Generation&quot;, featuring Irene&#x27;s daughter hiring Holmes in retirement. &quot;Second Generation&quot; aired on 17 December 1945.

A radio adaptation starring John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson aired in October 1954 on the BBC Light Programme. The production was also broadcast on NBC radio in January 1955, and on ABC radio in May 1956.

Michael Hardwick adapted the story as a radio production which aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1966, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series. Carleton Hobbs played Sherlock Holmes and Norman Shelley played Dr. Watson.

A radio adaptation was broadcast as an episode of the series &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; in 1977, with Kevin McCarthy as Sherlock Holmes and Court Benson as Dr. Watson. Marian Seldes played Irene Adler.

Bert Coules dramatised &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; for BBC Radio 4 in 1990, as an episode of the 1989–1998 radio series, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It also featured Andrew Sachs as the King (Sachs would then go on to play Watson in Coules&#x27; radio series &quot;The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in 2002–2010).

The story was adapted as a 2012 episode of the American radio series &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

===Television===
The story was adapted for a 1951 TV episode of &quot;We Present Alan Wheatley as Mr Sherlock Holmes in...&quot; starring Alan Wheatley as Holmes, Raymond Francis as Dr. Watson and Olga Edwardes as Irene Adler.

&quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; was adapted as part of the Soviet television film series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot;, in the form of a flashback in &quot;The Treasures of Agra&quot;; two episodes adapting &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot; (1983, USSR). It starred Vasily Livanov as Sherlock Holmes, Vitaly Solomin as Dr. Watson, Georgiy Martirosyan as the King of Bohemia and Larisa Solovyova as Irene Adler.

&quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; was adapted as the first episode of the 1984–1985 television series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode featured Jeremy Brett as Holmes, David Burke as Watson, and Gayle Hunnicutt as Irene Adler, whose first name is pronounced &quot;Irena&quot; in this adaptation.

&quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; was featured in a season 1 episode of the PBS series &quot;Wishbone&quot;, entitled &quot;A Dogged Exposé&quot;. In the episode, the supporting human characters search for an incognito photographer at their school who has been publishing embarrassing photographs of students. Intermingled with the plot, the title character Wishbone portrays Sherlock Holmes in a slightly modified adaptation of the original story to compare with the events of the &quot;real-life&quot; plot.

A series of four television movies produced in the early 2000s starred Matt Frewer as Sherlock Holmes and Kenneth Welsh as Dr. Watson. One of these films, &quot;The Royal Scandal&quot;, adapted &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; and combined its story with &quot;The Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;.

&quot;A Scandal in Belgravia&quot;, episode one of the second series of the TV series &quot;Sherlock&quot;, was loosely adapted from the short story and aired on January 1, 2012, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes, Martin Freeman as Watson and Lara Pulver as Irene Adler. The plot of the short story – Holmes and Watson attempting to recover incriminating photos from Adler – is covered briefly in the first half of the episode updated for the contemporary period (Adler&#x27;s photos are stored digitally on her mobile phone) and adjusted (the royal they incriminate is British and female); the episode then moves on to a storyline based on other Sherlock Holmes stories and films while including Adler, Mycroft Holmes (Mark Gatiss) and Jim Moriarty.

&quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; is the inspiration for two consecutive episode of House. Three Stories (Season 1, episode 21, aired Tue, May 17, 2005) and Honeymoon (Season 1, episode 22, aired May 24, 2005). Sela Ward is Stacy Warner/Irene Adler.

&quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; was adapted to the second episode &quot;The Adventure of the Headmaster with Trouble&quot; of NHK puppetry &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. Holmes is a pupil of an imaginary boarding school Beeton School. One day he pretends to be ill and goes to the nurse&#x27;s office to search the photo that Headmaster Ormstein and school nurse Irene Adler are in. But Adler sees through his feigned illness. Then Holmes and his roommate John H. Watson make a false fire to find the photo but she penetrates their wiles and tells Holmes that she returned the photo to Ormstein.

The hereditary king makes an appearance in a season six episode of &quot;Elementary&quot; entitled &quot;Breathe.&quot;

===Books===
It was adapted into one of the books of the Hong Kong children&#x27;s book series &quot;The Great Detective Sherlock Holmes&quot;, as &quot;The Most Formidable Lady Nemesis&quot; (史上最強的女敵手). It is Book #17 of the original Chinese version, and book #12 of the English version.

<doc id="417014" wikidata="Q1156614" url="?curid=417014" title="Passive transport">
<text>Passive transport is a type of membrane transport that does not require energy to move substances across cell membranes. Instead of using cellular energy, like active transport, passive transport relies on the second law of thermodynamics to drive the movement of substances across cell membranes. Fundamentally, substances follow Fick&#x27;s first law, and move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration because this movement increases the entropy of the overall system. The rate of passive transport depends on the permeability of the cell membrane, which, in turn, depends on the organization and characteristics of the membrane lipids and proteins. The four main kinds of passive transport are simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, filtration, and/or osmosis.

Passive transport follows Fick&#x27;s first law.

==Diffusion==
Diffusion is the net movement of material from an area of high concentration to an area with lower concentration. The difference of concentration between the two areas is often termed as the &quot;concentration gradient&quot;, and diffusion will continue until this gradient has been eliminated. Since diffusion moves materials from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, it is described as moving solutes &quot;down the concentration gradient&quot; (compared with active transport, which often moves material from area of low concentration to area of higher concentration, and therefore referred to as moving the material &quot;against the concentration gradient&quot;). 
However, in many cases (e.g. passive drug transport) the driving force of passive transport can not be simplified to the concentration gradient. If there are different solutions at the two sides of the membrane with different equilibrium solubility of the drug, the difference in the degree of saturation is the driving force of passive membrane transport. It is also true for supersaturated solutions which are more and more important owing to the spreading of the application of amorphous solid dispersions for drug bioavailability enhancement.

Simple diffusion and osmosis are in some ways similar. Simple diffusion is the passive movement of solute from a high concentration to a lower concentration until the concentration of the solute is uniform throughout and reaches equilibrium. Osmosis is much like simple diffusion but it specifically describes the movement of water (not the solute) across a selectively permeable membrane until there is an equal concentration of water and solute on both sides of the membrane. Simple diffusion and osmosis are both forms of passive transport and require none of the cell&#x27;s ATP energy.

=== Speed of diffusion ===
For passive diffusion, the law of diffusion states that the mean squared displacement is formula_1 with &quot;d&quot; being the number of dimensions and &quot;D&quot; the diffusion coefficient). So to diffuse a distance of about formula_2 takes time formula_3, and the &quot;average speed&quot; is formula_4. This means that in the same physical environment, diffusion is fast when the distance is small, but less when the distance is large.

This can be seen in material transport within the cell. Prokaryotes typically have small bodies, allowing diffusion to suffice for material transport within the cell. Larger cells like eukaryotes would either have very low metabolic rate to accommodate the slowness of diffusion, or invest in complex cellular machinery to allow active transport within the cell, such as kinesin walking along microtubules.

=== Example of diffusion: gas exchange ===
A biological example of diffusion is the gas exchange that occurs during respiration within the human body. Upon inhalation, oxygen is brought into the lungs and quickly diffuses across the membrane of alveoli and enters the circulatory system by diffusing across the membrane of the pulmonary capillaries. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide moves in the opposite direction, diffusing across the membrane of the capillaries and entering into the alveoli, where it can be exhaled. The process of moving oxygen into the cells, and carbon dioxide out, occurs because of the concentration gradient of these substances, each moving away from their respective areas of higher concentration toward areas of lower concentration. Cellular respiration is the cause of the low concentration of oxygen and high concentration of carbon dioxide within the blood which creates the concentration gradient. Because the gasses are small and uncharged, they are able to pass directly through the cell membrane without any special membrane proteins. No energy is required because the movement of the gasses follows Fick&#x27;s first law and the second law of thermodynamics.

==Facilitated diffusion== 
Facilitated diffusion, also called carrier-mediated osmosis, is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane via special transport proteins that are embedded in the plasma membrane by actively taking up or excluding ions [14]. Through facilitated diffusion, energy is not required in order for molecules to pass through the cell membrane. Active transport of protons by H+ ATPases alters membrane potential allowing for facilitated passive transport of particular ions such as potassium down their charge gradient through high affinity transporters and channels.

=== Example of facilitated diffusion: GLUT2 ===
An example of facilitated diffusion is when glucose is absorbed into cells through Glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) in the human body. There are many other types of glucose transport proteins, some that do require energy, and are therefore not examples of passive transport. Since glucose is a large molecule, it requires a specific channel to facilitate its entry across plasma membranes and into cells. When diffusing into a cell through GLUT2, the driving force that moves glucose into the cell is the concentration gradient. The main difference between simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion is that facilitated diffusion requires a transport protein to &#x27;facilitate&#x27; or assist the substance through the membrane. After a meal, the cell is signaled to move GLUT2 into membranes of the cells lining the intestines called enterocytes. With GLUT2 in place after a meal and the relative high concentration of glucose outside of these cells as compared to within them, the concentration gradient drives glucose across the cell membrane through GLUT2.

==Filtration==
Filtration is movement of water and solute molecules across the cell membrane due to hydrostatic pressure generated by the cardiovascular system. Depending on the size of the membrane pores, only solutes of a certain size may pass through it. For example, the membrane pores of the Bowman&#x27;s capsule in the kidneys are very small, and only albumins, the smallest of the proteins, have any chance of being filtered through. On the other hand, the membrane pores of liver cells are extremely large, but not forgetting cells are extremely small to allow a variety of solutes to pass through and be metabolized.

==Osmosis==
Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of high water potential to an area of low water potential. A cell with a less negative water potential will draw in water, but this depends on other factors as well such as solute potential (pressure in the cell e.g. solute molecules) and pressure potential (external pressure e.g. cell wall). There are three types of Osmosis solutions: the isotonic solution, hypotonic solution, and hypertonic solution. Isotonic solution is when the extracellular solute concentration is balanced with the concentration inside the cell. In the Isotonic solution, the water molecules still move between the solutions, but the rates are the same from both directions, thus the water movement is balanced between the inside of the cell as well as the outside of the cell. A hypotonic solution is when the solute concentration outside the cell is lower than the concentration inside the cell. In hypotonic solutions, the water moves into the cell, down its concentration gradient (from higher to lower water concentrations). That can cause the cell to swell. Cells that don&#x27;t have a cell wall, such as animal cells, could burst in this solution. A hypertonic solution is when the solute concentration is higher (think of hyper - as high) than the concentration inside the cell. In hypertonic solution, the water will move out, causing the cell to shrink.

<doc id="417016" wikidata="Q885763" url="?curid=417016" title="Blue Man Group">
<text>Blue Man Group is an American performance art company formed in New York City in 1987. It is known for its stage productions that incorporate many kinds of music and art, both popular and obscure. Its performers, known as Blue Men, have their skin painted blue. They are mute during shows and always appear in groups of three. 

As of 2025, the company has shows running in Berlin, Boston, Las Vegas, and Shanghai. 

A typical production employs seven to nine full-time Blue Men who are selected by audition. In addition to their stage shows, Blue Man Group has toured nationally and internationally, appeared on TV programs as characters and performers, released multiple studio albums, contributed to a number of film scores, and performed with orchestras around the United States.

==History==

=== New York ===
Blue Man Group grew out of a collaboration of three close friends, Chris Wink, Matt Goldman and Phil Stanton, on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side in 1987. Its first public appearance was a celebration of the end of the 1980s. The three wore blue masks and led a street procession that included the burning of a Rambo doll and a piece of the Berlin Wall. MTV&#x27;s Kurt Loder covered the event, drawing attention to the group. What began as creative &quot;disturbances&quot; on the city&#x27;s streets became a series of small shows at downtown clubs, and eventually a full performance at the Astor Place Theatre in 1991. 

In 1993, the group trained their first understudy. To be in the group, a Blue Man had to &quot;be between five-foot-ten and six-foot-one, skilled at drumming, and able to &#x27;wordlessly emote&#x27;... [They] learn to embody six archetypes, which the group calls the &#x27;innocent, hero, scientist, shaman, group member, and trickster.&#x27;&quot; The early Blue Man cast included Gideon Banner, Chris Bowen, Michael Dahlen, Isaac Eddy, Josh Elrod, Mark Frankel, Matt Goldman, John Grady, Randall Jaynes and Pete Simpson. Andrea Johnson was the first woman to be a Blue Man. She worked with them from 1999 to 2001.

In 2010, Goldman sold his share in the group to a venture-capital firm and the group hired Willy Burkhardt who was president of the company from 2010 through 2013. In 2017, Wink and Stanton sold their shares to the Canadian company Cirque du Soleil. On June 29, 2020, Cirque du Soleil filed for bankruptcy in Canada, with them temporarily laying off staff on June 30. The next day, on July 1, 2020, they filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy.

The New York City run at Astor Place ended on February 2, 2025, after three decades and more than 17,000 performances. 

=== Other locations ===
On February 1, 2021, the group closed their run at Universal Orlando Resort, citing the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the decision. In June 2024, it was announced that the group would be returning to Orlando in a new location. The group is set to open at the ICON Park in April 2025.

==Themes==
Blue Man performances have a number of themes, including:
* Science and technology, especially the topics of plumbing, fractals, human sight, DNA, and the Internet.
* Information overload and information pollution, such as when the audience is asked to choose one of three simultaneous streams of information to read.
* Innocence, as when the Blue Men appear to be surprised and perplexed by common artifacts of modern society or by audience reactions.
* Self-conscious and naïve imitation of cultural norms, such as attempting to stage an elegant dinner of Twinkies for an audience member; or following the Rock Concert Instruction Manual with the expectation that following instructions is all it takes to put on a rock concert.
* Rooftops, or climbing to the top, a metaphor for the directive that Stanton, Wink and Goldman drew from Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers&#x27;s PBS program &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;, namely &quot;following your bliss&quot;.

==Music and tours==
In 1999, the group released &quot;Audio&quot;, their first studio recording. Although it contained some of the music from their stage productions, it was chiefly a collection of full-length instrumentals featuring new instruments.

They performed Moby’s song “Natural Blues” with Moby and Jill Scott at the Grammys in 2001. 

In 2002, the group participated in Moby&#x27;s Area2 tour, giving a more rock-oriented performance than in the theatrical shows. Songs developed during this tour appeared on 2003&#x27;s album &quot;The Complex&quot;.

Unlike &quot;Audio&quot;, &quot;The Complex&quot;, released in 2003, featured a variety of vocalists and guests including Tracy Bonham, Dave Matthews, Gavin Rossdale and Venus Hum. The record spawned its own 2003 tour, &quot;The Complex Rock Tour,&quot; the first headlined by Blue Man Group. The tour deconstructed the traditional rock concert experience into its often clichéd parts and was chronicled in a 2004 DVD release. The tour featured Tracy Bonham and Venus Hum as supporting acts. The DVD included a surround sound mix of some of the studio recordings.

Blue Man Group launched its second tour, &quot;How to Be a Megastar Tour&quot;, on September 26, 2006. It featured some new material as well as material from the original Complex Rock Tour, and featured Tracy Bonham as opening act and vocalist. DJ/VJ Mike Relm was the opening act for the tour&#x27;s second leg, which ended April 22, 2007, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The third leg of the tour began in May 2007 and included performances in Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey, Mexico; Buenos Aires, Argentina; São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Santiago, Chile. The fourth leg, using &quot;2.1&quot; in its title, included more U.S. and Canada dates. The tour visited France, Korea, Canada, Germany, and a few other European countries through 2008. From August 19–23, it visited Taipei, Taiwan to promote its 2009 Summer Deaflympics, with most of the show&#x27;s dialogue accompanied by subtitles. After Typhoon Morakot hit the island in mid-August, the group held an extra show to benefit flood victims.

Blue Man Group performed with Ricky Martin at the 2007 Latin Grammy Awards and again with Michel Teló at the 2012 Latin Grammy Awards.

In 2008, they collaborated on the track &quot;No More Heroes&quot; with Dutch DJ and producer Tiësto for the remixed version of the &quot;Elements of Life&quot; album.

Announced in 2009, Blue Man Group began performing for the first time at sea on Norwegian Cruise Line&#x27;s ship &quot;Epic&quot;. From July 2010 to March 2015, &quot;Epic&quot; alternated 7-Day Eastern and Western Caribbean sailings from Miami with nightly Blue Man Group shows.

A Blue Man Group national tour in 2010 visited various cities in the United States, Canada and Latin America. The tour included elements from their then-current theatrical performances, and new elements created for the tour.

To celebrate their 20th anniversary, the group gave a special performance with Dave Matthews at the Astor Place Theatre in New York City, collaborating on the song &quot;Sing Along.&quot;

To celebrate Blue Man Group&#x27;s 25th anniversary, a global tour began in Singapore in March 2016. It continued through Asia and Oceania in 2016 and opened for the first time in South Africa in February 2017. It was announced that the tour will continue on to Abu Dhabi and Switzerland later in 2017.

In April 2016, Blue Man Group released &quot;Three&quot;, their third studio album. Building on the group&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Three&quot; draws inspiration from the group&#x27;s 25-year history.

In May 2017, Blue Man Group collaborated with the YouTube channel The Slow Mo Guys for a video of several objects being destroyed with bowling balls, including busts of the Blue Men. A Blue Man &quot;autographed&quot; Gavin Free&#x27;s lab coat (the cleaner of the hosts&#x27;) by wiping his head on the right shoulder.

On April 27, 2019, Blue Man Group gave a special performance at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida, during the Grand Opening Session of DECA&#x27;s International Career Development Conference.

In February 2021, it was revealed that Blue Man Group had collaborated with American pop band AJR on the song &quot;Ordinaryish People&quot;, included on their album &quot;OK Orchestra&quot; (2021). A music video featuring Blue Man Group was released on February 9, 2022.

In April 2024, Blue Man collaborated with Canadian musician Andrew Huang on a song called &quot;Desert Portal&quot;. They released joint videos on their YouTube channels: the former&#x27;s of the song&#x27;s music video, which depicts the group and Huang discovering a sound-activated tent that transports them to a desert, and the latter&#x27;s of the music video&#x27;s behind the scenes.

On August 16, 2024, Blue Man Group collaborated with the YouTube channel Drumeo for a video, alongside their musical director, Josh Matthews. They are introduced to a song by My Chemical Romance called Welcome to the Black Parade. They listen to the song in its entirety without a drum track, and then are tasked with creating their own drum part and performing it on video. After their performance, the song is then revealed in its original form with the missing drum track and the group&#x27;s reaction is recorded.

<doc id="417018" wikidata="Q1474264" url="?curid=417018" title="Java Desktop System">
<text>Java Desktop System, briefly known as OpenSolaris Desktop, is a legacy desktop environment developed first by Sun Microsystems and then by Oracle Corporation after the 2010 Oracle acquisition of Sun. Java Desktop System is available for Solaris and was once available for Linux. The Linux version was discontinued after Solaris was released as open source software in 2005. Java Desktop System aims to provide a system familiar to the average computer user with a full suite of office productivity software such as an office suite, a web browser, email, calendaring, and instant messaging.

Despite being known as the Java Desktop System, it is not actually written in Java. Rather, it is built around a modified version of GNOME along with other common free software projects, which are written mostly in C and C++. The name reflected Sun&#x27;s promotion of the product as an outlet for corporate users to deploy software written for the Java platform.

==Versions==
JDS was originally made available via a titular &quot;operating environment&quot;, which was a custom Linux distribution based upon SUSE Linux.

Sun first bundled a preview release of GNOME 1.4 on a separate CD for Solaris 8.

JDS version 2 included:

*Java
*GNOME (using the Blueprint theme)
*StarOffice
*Mozilla
*Evolution
*MP3 and CD player
*Java Media Framework&#x27;s Java Media Player
*Gaim multi-service instant messaging
*RealPlayer

JDS Release 2 was available for Solaris and for the SuSE-based Linux distribution.

JDS Release 3 was released in 2005. It was included with Solaris 10 — upon installation of Solaris, one has the choice of using either the CDE or JDS. It was based on GNOME 2.6 and available only for the Solaris 10 platform. 

==OpenSolaris Desktop==
OpenSolaris received its own version of the Java Desktop System. OpenSolaris Desktop was tied to the OpenSolaris operating system, and did not have its own release schedule. 

OpenSolaris Desktop 01 (released October 28, 2005) was based on GNOME 2.10 and OpenSolaris Desktop 02 (released December 23, 2005) was based on GNOME 2.12. The last version was released with the release of OpenSolaris 2009.6, and was based on Gnome 2.24. It also included Firefox 3.1, OpenOffice 3 and Sun VirtualBox. The OpenSolaris Desktop line of the Java Desktop System became defunct with the end of the OpenSolaris project.

==Availability==
With the end of the OpenSolaris project, JDS Release 3 is now the last release of the project on a currently supported operating system Solaris 10. Newer Solaris based operating systems have abandoned the Java Desktop System. Solaris 11 and projects based upon the OpenSolaris codebase such as OpenIndiana use a stock version of GNOME.

<doc id="417019" wikidata="Q133150" url="?curid=417019" title="Cupedidae">
<text>The Cupedidae are a small family of beetles, notable for the square pattern of &quot;windows&quot; on their elytra (hard forewings), which give the family their common name of reticulated beetles.

The family consists of about 30 species in 9 genera, with a worldwide distribution. Many more extinct species are known, dating as far back as the Triassic. The family Ommatidae is considered a subfamily of Cupedidae by some authors, but ommatids have been found to more closely related to Micromalthidae in genomic analysis studies.

These beetles tend to be elongated with a parallel-sided body, ranging in length from , with colors brownish, blackish, or gray. The larvae are wood-borers, typically living in fungus-infested wood, and sometimes found in wood construction. The larvae eat the fungus-infested dead wood or tree roots while the adults are believed to subsist on pollen and plant sap.

Males of &quot;Priacma serrata&quot; (western North America) are notable for being strongly attracted to common household bleach. This suggests that compounds in bleach may resemble attractive compounds found by the beetle in nature.

<text>A paper mill is a factory devoted to making paper from vegetable fibres such as wood pulp, old rags, and other ingredients. Prior to the invention and adoption of the Fourdrinier machine and other types of paper machine that use an endless belt, all paper in a paper mill was made by hand, one sheet at a time, by specialized laborers.

== History ==

Historical investigations into the origin of the paper mill are complicated by differing definitions and loose terminology from modern authors: Many modern scholars use the term to refer indiscriminately to all kinds of mills, whether powered by humans, by animals or by water. Their propensity to refer to any ancient paper manufacturing center as a &quot;mill&quot;, without further specifying its exact power source, has increased the difficulty of identifying the particularly efficient and historically important water-powered type.

=== Human and animal-powered mills ===
The use of human and animal powered mills was known to Muslim and Chinese papermakers. However, evidence for water-powered paper mills is elusive among both prior to the 11th century. The general absence of the use of water-powered paper mills in Muslim papermaking prior to the 11th century is suggested by the habit of Muslim authors at the time to call a production center not a &quot;mill&quot;, but a &quot;paper manufactory&quot;.

Scholars have identified paper mills in Abbasid-era Baghdad in 794–795. The evidence that waterpower was applied to papermaking at this time is a matter of scholarly debate. In the Moroccan city of Fez, Ibn Battuta speaks of &quot;400 mill stones for paper&quot;. Since Ibn Battuta does not mention the use of water-power and such a number of water-mills would be grotesquely high, the passage is generally taken to refer to human or animal force.

===Water-powered mills===
An exhaustive survey of milling in Al-Andalus did not uncover water-powered paper mills, nor do the Spanish books of property distribution (&quot;Repartimientos&quot;) after the Christian reconquest refer to any. Arabic texts never use the term mill in connection with papermaking, and the most thorough account of Muslim papermaking at the time, the one by the Zirid Sultan Al-Muizz ibn Badis, describes the art purely in terms of a handcraft. Donald Hill has identified a possible reference to a water-powered paper mill in Samarkand, in the 11th-century work of the Persian scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni, but concludes that the passage is &quot;too brief to enable us to say with certainty&quot; that it refers to a water-powered paper mill. This is seen by Leor Halevi as evidence of Samarkand first harnessing waterpower in the production of paper, but notes that it is not known if waterpower was applied to papermaking elsewhere across the Islamic world at the time. Robert I. Burns remains sceptical, given the isolated occurrence of the reference and the prevalence of manual labour in Islamic papermaking elsewhere prior to the 13th century.

Hill notes that paper mills appear in early Christian Catalan documentation from the 1150s, which may imply Islamic origins, but that hard evidence is lacking. Burns, however, has dismissed the case for early Catalan water-powered paper mills, after re-examination of the evidence.

The identification of early hydraulic stamping mills in medieval documents from Fabriano, Italy, is also completely without substance.

Clear evidence of a water-powered paper mill dates to 1282 in the Iberian Crown of Aragon. A decree by the Christian king Peter III addresses the establishment of a royal &quot;molendinum&quot;, a proper hydraulic mill, in the paper manufacturing center of Xàtiva. This early hydraulic paper mill was operated by Muslims in the Moorish quarter of Xàtiva, though it appears to have been resented by sections of the local Muslim papermakering community; the document guarantees them the right to continue the way of traditional papermaking by beating the pulp manually and grants them the right to be exempted from work in the new mill.

The first permanent paper mill north of the Alps was established in Nuremberg by Ulman Stromer in 1390; it is later depicted in the lavishly illustrated &quot;Nuremberg Chronicle&quot;. From the mid-14th century onwards, European paper milling underwent a rapid improvement of many work processes.

The size of a paper mill prior to the use of industrial machines was described by counting the number of vats it had. Thus, a &quot;one vat&quot; paper mill had only one vatman, one coucher, and other laborers.

=== 15th century ===
The first reference to a paper mill in England was in a book printed by Wynken de Worde ; the mill, near Hertford, belonged to John Tate.

=== 19th century ===

An early attempt at a machine to mechanise the process was patented in 1799 by the Frenchman Nicholas Louis Robert; it was not deemed a success. In 1801, however, the drawings were brought to England by John Gamble and passed on to brothers Henry and Sealy Fourdrinier, who financed the engineer Bryan Donkin to construct the machine. Their first successful machine was installed at Frogmore Mill, Hertfordshire, in 1803.

In 1809 at Apsley Mill, John Dickinson patented and installed another kind of paper machine. Rather than pouring a dilute pulp suspension onto an endlessly revolving flat wire, this machine used a cylinder covered in wire as the mould. A cylindrical mould is partially submerged in the vat, containing a pulp suspension, and then, as the mould rotates, the water is sucked through the wire, leaving a thin layer of fibres deposited on the cylinder. These cylinder-mould machines, as they are named, were strong competition for Fourdrinier machine makers. They were the type of machine first used by the North American paper industry. It is estimated that by 1850 UK paper production had reached 100,000 tons. Later developments increased the size and capacity of machines as well as seeking high volume alternative pulp sources from which paper could be reliably produced. Many of the earlier mills were small and had been located in rural areas. The movement was to larger mills in, or near, urban areas closer to their suppliers of the raw materials. They were often situated near a port where the raw material was brought in by ship and the paper markets. By the end of the century there were less than 300 UK paper mills, employing 35,000 people and producing 650,000 tons of paper per year.

=== 20th century ===

By the early 20th century, paper mills sprang up around New England and the rest of the world, due to the high demand for paper. The United States, with its infrastructure and mill towns, was the largest producer in the world. Chief among these in paper production was Holyoke, Massachusetts, which was the largest producer of paper in the world by 1885, and home to engineers D. H. &amp; A. B. Tower who oversaw the largest firm of paper millwrights in the US during that decade, designing mills on five continents. However, as 20th century progressed this diaspora moved further north and west in the United States, with access to greater pulp supplies and labor. At this time, there were many world leaders of the production of paper; one such was the Brown Company in Berlin, New Hampshire run by William Wentworth Brown. During the year 1907, the Brown Company cut between 30 and 40 million acres of woodlands on their property, which extended from La Tuque, Quebec, Canada to West Palm, Florida.

In the 1920s, Nancy Baker Tompkins represented large paper manufacturing companies, like Hammermill Paper Company, Honolulu Paper Company and Appleton Coated Paper Company to promote sales to the distributors of paper products. It was said to be the only business of its kind in the world, and was started in 1931 by Tompkins. It prospered in spite of the business depression.
&quot;Log drives&quot; were conducted on local rivers to send the logs to the mills. By the late 20th and early 21st-century, paper mills began to close, and the log drives became a dying craft. Due to the addition of new machinery, many millworkers were laid off and many of the historic paper mills closed.

==Characteristics==

Paper mills can be fully integrated mills or nonintegrated mills. Integrated mills consist of a pulp mill and a paper mill on the same site. Such mills receive logs or wood chips and produce paper.

The modern paper mill uses large amounts of energy, water, and wood pulp in an efficient and complex series of processes, and control technology to produce a sheet of paper that can be used in diverse ways. Modern paper machines can be in length, produce a sheet wide, and operate at speeds of more than . The two main suppliers of paper machines are Metso and Voith.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives,  represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles and two trailing wheels on one axle. The locomotive became almost globally known as a Pacific type after a locomotive built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia was shipped across the Pacific Ocean to New Zealand.
==Overview==
The introduction of the design in 1901 has been described as &quot;a veritable milestone in locomotive progress&quot;. On many railways worldwide, Pacific steam locomotives provided the motive power for express passenger trains throughout much of the early to mid-20th century, before either being superseded by larger types in the late 1940s and 1950s, or replaced by electric or diesel-electric locomotives during the 1950s and 1960s. Nevertheless, new Pacific designs continued to be built until the mid-1950s.

The type is generally considered to be an enlargement of the Atlantic type, although its prototype had a direct relationship to the Ten-wheeler and Prairie, effectively being a combination of the two types. The success of the type can be attributed to a combination of its four-wheel leading truck which provided better stability at speed than a Prairie, the six driving wheels which allowed for a larger boiler and the application of more tractive effort than the earlier Atlantic, and the two-wheel trailing truck, first used on the New Zealand Prairie of 1885. This permitted the firebox to be located behind the high driving wheels and thereby allowed it to be both wide and deep, unlike the Ten-wheeler which had either a narrow and deep firebox between the driving wheels or a wide and shallow one above.

The type is well-suited to high speed running. The world speed record for steam traction of has been held by a British Pacific locomotive, the &quot;Mallard&quot;, since 3 July 1938.

===Development===
The two earliest locomotives, both created in the United States, were experimental designs which were not perpetuated. In 1887, the Lehigh Valley Railroad experimented with a Ten-wheeler design with a Strong&#x27;s patent firebox, a cylindrical device behind the cab which required an extension of the frame and the addition of two trailing wheels to support it. In 1889, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St Paul Railway rebuilt a conventional with trailing wheels as a means of reducing its axle load.

In 1896, six Q class tank locomotives were introduced on the Western Australian Government Railways.

The first true Pacific, designed as such with a large firebox aft of the coupled wheels, was ordered in 1901 by the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) from the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The NZR Chief Mechanical Engineer, Alfred Beattie, ordered thirteen new Q class locomotives with a sufficiently large Wootten firebox to efficiently burn poor grade lignite coal from eastern South Island mines. Even before they had completed the order from New Zealand, the Baldwin engineers realised the advantages of this new type, and incorporated it into standard designs for other customers. The design was soon widely adopted by designers throughout the world.

===Origin of the name===
There are different opinions concerning the origin of the name Pacific. The design was a natural enlargement of the existing Baldwin Atlantic type, but the type name may also be in recognition of the fact that a New Zealand designer had first proposed it. Usually, however, new wheel arrangements were named for, or named by, the railroad which first used the type in the United States. In the case of the Pacific, that was the Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1902.

In the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, the first Pacifics were delivered from Kitson &amp; Company in 1903 and designated the Karoo Class, from the region of the Cape Western System of the Cape Government Railways that they were designed to work in.

===Global popularity===
The Pacific type was used on mainline railways around the world. The railways of New Zealand and Australia were the first in the world to run large numbers of Pacific locomotives, having introduced types in 1901 and 1902 respectively and operating them until the 1960s.
During the first half of the 20th century, the Pacific rapidly became the predominant passenger steam power in North America. Between 1902 and 1930, about 6,800 locomotives of the type were built by North American manufacturers for service in the United States and Canada. With exported locomotives included, about 7,300 were built in total. About 45% of these were built by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) which became the main builder of the type, and 28% by Baldwin. Large numbers were also used in South America, most of which were supplied by manufacturers in the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany.
Africa was the third continent upon which the Pacific was regularly used, following the introduction of the Karoo class on the Cape Government Railways in the Cape of Good Hope in 1903. The earliest African examples were built in the United Kingdom by Kitson &amp; Company.

The earliest examples of the Pacific in Europe were two French prototypes, introduced in 1907 and designed by the &quot;Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans&quot; (PO) to overcome the insufficient power of their . Within a few weeks, these were followed by a German Pacific type that, although already designed in 1905, only entered service in late 1907. The next was a British type, introduced in January 1908. By the outbreak of World War I, the type was being widely used on the railways of Continental Europe.

The Pacific type was introduced into Asia in 1907, the same year that it was first used in Europe. By the 1920s, Pacifics were being used by many railways throughout the Asian continent.

In 1923, the Pacific gave its name to Arthur Honegger&#x27;s orchestral work, &quot;Pacific 231&quot;, which successfully reflectively interprets the emotive sounds of a steam locomotive. (231 after the French system of counting axles rather than wheels.)

===Tank locomotives===
During the first two decades of the 20th century, the Pacific wheel arrangement enjoyed limited popularity on tank locomotives. On a locomotive, the trailing wheels support the coal bunker rather than an enlarged firebox and such a locomotive is therefore actually a tank engine version of the Ten-wheeler tender locomotive. Indeed, many of the earliest examples were either rebuilt from tender locomotives or shared their basic design.

Around 1920, it became apparent to designers that the wheel arrangement allowed a too limited bunker size for most purposes, with the result that most later designs of large suburban tank classes were of the Hudson or Adriatic wheel arrangement.

===Lifespan===

The Pacific became the major express passenger locomotive type on many railways throughout the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Examples were also built for fast freight and mixed traffic duties. However, due to the increasing weight of trains during the 1940s, larger developments of the type became necessary in the United States and elsewhere. The most notable of these was the Hudson or Baltic type, which had a four-wheel trailing bogie that permitted an even larger firebox, albeit at a loss of some adhesive weight, and the Mountain type which used an extra pair of driving wheels to deliver more tractive effort to the rails. Nevertheless, the Pacific type remained widely used on express passenger trains until the end of steam traction. The last examples were built in the United Kingdom and Japan in the mid-1950s. British Railways introduced its BR Standard Class 6 and BR Standard Class 7 designs in 1951 and 1952, and the final United Kingdom design, the BR Standard Class 8, in 1954.

However, the story of the type did not end in the 1960s. One further mainline example of the LNER Peppercorn Class A1, No. 60163 &quot;Tornado&quot;, was completed at Darlington by the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust in 2008. Designed to meet modern safety and certification standards, Tornado runs on the United Kingdom&#x27;s rail network and on mainline-connected heritage railways.

==Usage==
===Argentina===
The Vulcan Foundry built twenty Pacific locomotives for the former Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway (BAGSR) in 1926, two of which still survive. A further single 12B class locomotive was built in 1930, and the 12K class of twelve Pacific locomotives was built for the BAGSR by Vulcan in 1938.

In 1930, the Central Argentine Railway (&quot;Ferrocarril Central Argentino&quot; or FCCA) ordered twenty large three-cylinder PS11 class Pacific locomotives with Caprotti valve gear, which were at the time the most powerful locomotives on the FCCA. In 1939, one of these set up a South American speed record, averaging on the &quot;El Cordobes&quot; express across the non-stop run from Rosario to Buenos Aires, hauling a 500-ton train and at times attaining a maximum speed of nearly .

The Vulcan Foundry built a further fifty locomotives of a modernised PS12 class version of this design for the nationalised &quot;Ferrocarriles Argentinos&quot; (FCA) between 1950 and 1953.

===Australia===
In Australia, the first known example of the wheel arrangement was the Q class tank locomotive of the gauge Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR). The six locomotives were introduced in 1896, but four of them were soon converted to a Hudson configuration.

The WAGR was the largest user of Pacific tender types in Australia. In total, the WAGR operated at least 223 locomotives, acquired between 1902 and 1950, making it by far its most numerous wheel arrangement.
* The first simple expansion (simplex) tender locomotives in Australia were ordered from British manufacturers for the WAGR. However, due to slow delivery times by the British companies as a result of full order books and their preference for larger orders, twenty compound expansion locomotives were also ordered from Baldwin Locomotive Works in Pennsylvania and placed in service in 1902, designated the Ec class. From 1923, these locomotives, designed for heavy goods and passenger traffic, were converted into light-lines L class engines, but without altering their wheel arrangement.
* The British-built locomotives, the WAGR E class, were built by Nasmyth, Wilson &amp; Company, North British Locomotive Company (NBL) and Vulcan Foundry between 1902 and 1912. These were the first of the type to be introduced in quantity, with 65 locomotives in the class.
* Other Pacific type locomotives operated by the WAGR included the twenty-strong C class, introduced in 1902, which were converted from a to a wheel arrangement from 1909.

* It was not until the introduction of the WAGR P class in 1924 that Western Australia received what many considered a true Pacific, a large, well balanced locomotive designed primarily for fast passenger traffic. The P class consisted of 25 locomotives, built in 1924 and 1925 by NBL as well as locally at the WAGR&#x27;s Midland Railway Workshops. The P class engines revolutionised express passenger travel in Western Australia by drastically reducing passenger travel times between destinations.
* The first batch of ten WAGR Pr &quot;River&quot; class locomotives, named after prominent rivers in Western Australia and with a boiler pressure rating of compared to the of the P class, were built in 1938 at the Midland Railway Workshops. Between 1941 and 1944, eight of the P class locomotives were also converted to Pr class. One of them was preserved.
* The WAGR U class of fourteen oil burning locomotives, one of which was preserved, were purchased from NBL in 1946 as surplus war-work engines, following the World War II.
* The WAGR&#x27;s final Pacific design was its Pm and Pmr classes of 35 locomotives, introduced in 1950, five of which have been preserved. These locomotives were intended to replace the Pr class, but were quickly relegated to goods workings after proving to be rigid steamers.

The Midland Railway of Western Australia, one of the longest-lived privately owned railways in Australia, followed the WAGR&#x27;s example by introducing five class C locomotives which were built by Kitson &amp; Company to the Karoo design of the Cape Government Railways as basis.

In the 1920s, heavy Pacific locomotives were introduced by both South Australian Railways (SAR) and Victorian Railways (VR), in response to increasingly heavy passenger trains and the demand for faster services. Although similar in size, power and top speed, their designs reflected different approaches.
* The SAR 600 class reflected contemporary American locomotive practice, both in design features and appearance, with two large cylinders. The SAR owned altogether twenty Pacific locomotives, of which the first ten were of the 600 class, supplied by Armstrong Whitworth of the United Kingdom in 1922. The remainder were of the 620 class, built at Islington Railway Workshops between 1936 and 1938.

* The VR S class, on the other hand, showed a strong British London &amp; North Eastern Railway influence, with three cylinders and with Gresley conjugated valve gear driving the third inside cylinder. The VR&#x27;s four S class locomotives were built at Newport Works between 1928 and 1930.
The VR also built a locomotive class, the Dde class that was developed from a successful Dd class design in 1908, intended for outer suburban passenger services in Melbourne.

The gauge Queensland Railways (QR) had two Pacific locomotive classes. Between 1926 and 1947, 83 B18¼ class were introduced to haul mail trains. The prototype, built by QR&#x27;s Ipswich Workshops, began trial runs on 16 July 1926 and was followed by two batches of eight locomotives in 1927 and 1929. The last locomotive of this class was delivered in 1947. In 1950, QR ordered 35 BB18¼ class locomotives from Vulcan Foundry, developed from the successful B18¼ class. Another twenty were built by Walkers Limited of Maryborough between 1955 and 1958. Of these, no. 1089 was the last mainline steam locomotive to be built in Australia.
The New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR) introduced its C38 class for express passenger service in 1943. These two-cylinder Pacifics had a free-steaming boiler and were renowned for their performance. Class leader 3801 achieved considerable fame in preservation, with notable feats such as hauling the &quot;Western Endeavour&quot;, a transcontinental journey from Sydney to Perth in 1970.

The Tasmanian Government Railways owned fourteen Pacific locomotives. Four R class were built for passenger trains by Perry Engineering in Adelaide and ten M class were built by Robert Stephenson &amp; Hawthorns in 1951, and were used on all trains on major lines in northern Tasmania.

===Austria===

The only Pacific type to be built in Austria was the class 629 tank locomotive of the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways (kkStB), later the &quot;Österreichische Bundesbahnen&quot; (ÖBB), of which 95 were built between 1913 and 1927. This highly successful locomotive remained in service until 1975.

The class 629 was later also produced and developed in Czechoslovakia as the class 354.1 of the Czechoslovak State Railways (ČSD). Between 1921 and 1941, 219 of these locomotives were built there and, in addition, seventeen of the original Austrian class 629 locomotives were used there. They survived in service until 1978. Three examples have been preserved. (Also see Czechoslovakia)

The Pacific tender locomotives that worked passenger services in Austria between 1938 and 1945 all belonged to the railways of other countries, such as the Deutsche Reichsbahn, the Czechoslovak State Railways and the Yugoslav State Railways.
===Belgium===
In 1897, a Type 4 Prairie tender locomotive, built in the 1880s, was fitted with a front bogie, making it the first Belgian Pacific. This rebuilt was not extended to the other 90 Type 4.

Apart from several Pacifics built for foreign railways by Belgian locomotive builders, only two &quot;true&quot; Pacific classes were built for Belgian railways (Belgian State Railways, later SNCB).
* The type 10 was a heavy 4-6-2 built between 1910 and 1912 and radically improved between the 1920s and the 1930s. These 59 engines were used on several main lines; they were the best passenger engines on the challenging until the line was electrified in 1956;
* The type 1, built in 1935 (15 engines) and 1938 (20), were more modern and had a much wider firebox. They were mostly used on medium inclines and easier lines. They ran until 1962.

===Bulgaria===
The Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ) bought its first four-cylinder simple expansion Pacific type locomotive from John Cockerill of Belgium in 1912. This lone engine hauled express trains from Sofia to Svilengrad and was rebuilt in 1933.

In 1938, BDZ improved its express service between Sofia and Burgas and placed an order with Krupp in Germany for five three-cylinder Pacific type locomotives. Because of the disruption caused by World War II, the locomotives were only delivered to Bulgaria in 1941. They had cylinders, coupled wheels and were capable of a maximum speed of . They were initially designated class 07.01 to 07.05, but in 1942 their classification was changed to 05.01 to 05.05. They all survived until the end of steam traction in Bulgaria in the 1980s. Engine no. 05.01 has since been restored and, as of 2015, was in working order.

===Burma===
Burma was administered as a province of British India from 1886 until 1937. In 1932, the Vulcan Foundry built three locomotives of the YC class for the Burma Railways. Since most of Burma&#x27;s locomotive stock was destroyed during the Japanese occupation of Burma in the World War II, Vulcan Foundry delivered sixty Pacific locomotives of the YB class in 1947, after the war.

===Canada===

Canadian Pacific (CP) employed several Pacific classes, beginning with 39 G1 class locomotives, built between 1906 and 1914 by the CP at its Angus Shops and by the Montreal Locomotive Works. After 1921, 166 examples of a new G2 class locomotive with a superheater were built by the American Locomotive Company at Schenectady, Angus and Montreal. The last of these remained in service until 1961.

After World War I, the CP needed heavier mixed-traffic locomotives since steel passenger cars replaced the older wooden ones on its mainlines. This resulted in the introduction in 1919 of 23 G3a class with driving wheels, built by Angus for service over flat terrain, and five G4 class locomotives with smaller drivers, built by Montreal for hilly terrain. A further 152 G3 class locomotives were built in batches between 1926 and 1948. These locomotives were withdrawn from service between 1954 and 1965.

102 examples of the G5 class locomotive were built after 1944. The first two were built by Angus and the rest by Montreal and the Canadian Locomotive Company. They were considered fast, efficient and handsome locomotives and remained in service on many secondary lines of the CP until the end of steam.
The Reid-Newfoundland Company Limited, which operated the railways in Newfoundland, took delivery of ten Pacific locomotives with drivers between 1920 and 1929, built by Baldwin, Montreal and ALCO Schenectady. Numbered 190 to 199, they had two cylinders and weighed 56.3 tons. They all passed to the Government-owned Newfoundland Railway, and then to Canadian National (CN) when Newfoundland joined the Confederation of Canada. CN renumbered them 591 to 599 and classified them as J-8-a (BLW 54398–54401 and 54466–54467 of 1920), J-8-b (BLW 59531 and MLW 67129, both of 1926) and J-8-c (ALCO-Schenectady 67941–67942 of 1929).

They were the only Pacific-type locomotives built to operate on gauge in North America. The only surviving Newfoundland steam locomotive, the Newfoundland Railway no. 193, later CN no. 593, is preserved and on display at the Humbermouth Historic Train Site in Newfoundland. (Also see )

===China===
The Japanese introduced several classes of Pacific locomotive during their occupation of Manchuria, but the &quot;Pashiro&quot; became the standard and was China&#x27;s most numerous class of steam passenger locomotive. Between 1933 and 1944, around 272 were built for the South Manchuria Railway (SMR), the Manchurian National Railway and the railways of occupied North China. They were built by various Japanese builders, including Dalian and Sifang, while the SMR&#x27;s own workshops were also involved in the construction.

The Japanese-built &quot;Pashina&quot; locomotives were used on the Asia Express train between 1934 and 1943, during Japanese control of the SMR. These were built by Kawasaki and Dalian.
The name &quot;Shengli&quot; (Victory) was used for all classes of Pacific inherited by the new China in 1951. The &quot;Pashiro&quot; became the &quot;Shengli 6&quot; (SL6 class), while the &quot;Pashina&quot; locomotives were designated &quot;Shengli 7&quot; (SL7 class) under Chinese ownership.

The Sifang works resumed production of SL6 class locomotives in 1956 and completed 151 locomotives before moving on to RM class construction in 1958. The inability of the class to haul the heavier passenger trains that were introduced in the 1970s and 1980s, saw them progressively being re-allocated to secondary duties. By 1990, most of the survivors were concentrated in Manchuria at the Dashiqiao, Jilin and Baicheng depots.

The China Railways RM was China&#x27;s last steam passenger design. It was a late 1950s development of the successful pre-war SL6 class Pacific and became the standard passenger class. The class, numbered RM 1001 to 1258, entered service in 1958 and a total of 258 were built before production ceased in 1966. In the 1970s, they were gradually displaced from premier services by locomotives more suited to handling heavier trains and they ended their service lives on secondary passenger duties.

===Czechoslovakia===

Between 1926 and 1967, two Pacific tender locomotive classes were built in Czechoslovakia and operated by the Czechoslovak State Railways (&quot;Československé státní dráhy&quot; or ČSD). These were the ČSD Class 387.0 and Class 399.0 express passenger locomotives.

The 2100 horsepower Pacific Class 387.0 was the most successful of these, nicknamed &quot;Mikádo&quot; because of its short chimney. Between 1926 and 1937, 43 were built in five series by the Škoda Works in Plzeň, intended for the heaviest long-distance express trains. This class is considered to have been among the most successful locomotives in Europe. The locomotives began to be withdrawn in 1967, with the last one being retired in 1974. One locomotive, no. 387.043, has been preserved. (Also see Austria)

===Egypt===
Prior to 1954, the Egyptian State Railways used Atlantic or Ten-wheeler types on express passenger trains. However, in 1953 a requirement arose for a locomotive capable of hauling 550-tonne trains over the from Cairo to Alexandria in two hours. These were originally going to be Hudson locomotives, but the specification was eased to suit a 500-tonne train load, allowing a type to be used.

They were ordered from Société Alsacienne (SACM) at Grafenstaden in France. The class was unusual in being designed for oil burning, with a long narrow firebox and combustion chamber fitted between the plate frames. They had a short lifespan in express train service, since the 1956 war put an end to fast train running in Egypt. The Pacifics were then transferred to haul slower night express trains to Luxor and Aswan. Some remained in service up to 1967.

===Ethiopia===
The French-owned Imperial Railway Company of Ethiopia, with of trackage, had four Pacific type locomotives on its roster.

The first one was bought from &quot;Forges, Usines et Fonderies de Haine-Saint-Pierre&quot; in Belgium in 1923. This locomotive had been ordered by the Spanish railway &quot;Ferrocarril Madrid-Aragon&quot; in 1914, prior to the outbreak of the World War I, but it was never delivered for reasons unknown. The locomotive used saturated steam and had coupled wheels, which made it well suited to run the between Addis Abeba and Dire Dawa in Ethiopia. (Also see Spain)

Three more similar Pacific locomotives, but superheated, were ordered in 1936. They arrived after the Italian conquest of Ethiopia and were allocated to the Addis Abeba and Dire Dawa sheds. They continued to haul passenger trains until the mainline diesels arrived in 1956, after which all were soon withdrawn from service and scrapped in the early 1960s.

===Finland===
Twenty-two Pacific locomotives of the Class Hr1, numbers 1000 to 1021 and named &quot;Ukko-Pekka&quot; after the nickname of Finnish President Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, were constructed in Finland by Tampella and Lokomo between 1937 and 1957. They were the largest passenger locomotives to be built and used in Finland and remained the primary locomotives on express trains for Southern Finland until 1963, when the Hr12 class diesel locomotives took over.
The last two Class Hr1 locomotives to be built in 1957, numbers 1020 and 1021, Lokomo works numbers 474 and 475, were equipped throughout with SKF C-type roller bearings, even on the coupled rod big ends, and represented a fine combination of American and German locomotive building practices. They were, along with the Deutsche Bundesbahn class 10, the last new-built Pacific type locomotives in Europe.

When tested after delivery from Lokomo or Tampella, each locomotive reached , but in everyday service their speed was limited to . All the locomotives were initially located at Pasila depot in Helsinki, but in 1959 the last seven to be built were transferred to Kouvola depot.

By European standards, Class Hr1 locomotives ran high annual kilometre figures, between per locomotive per year between 1937 and 1963. The two fully roller bearing-equipped locomotives even exceeded the mark in 1961, the highest annual kilometre figure to be obtained by a steam locomotive in Northern Europe. The only similar annual kilometres by European Pacific type locomotives were run in Germany and by the roller bearing-equipped Peppercorn Class A1 locomotives of the London and North Eastern Railway in the United Kingdom.

At least twelve class Hr1 locomotives were preserved as at April 2008, of which two were in operational condition. These were no. 1021, owned by the VR Group, and the privately owned no. 1009. No. 1001 was reserved for the Railway Museum in Hyvinkää and no. 1002 was reserved for the city of Helsinki as a possible static monument.

===France===
France was a major user of the Pacific type. Following the introduction of two successful &quot;Paris à Orléans&quot; prototypes in 1907, a further 1,362 Pacific locomotives were built for or acquired by the major French railway companies, including those acquired from Germany following the terms of the Armistice in 1918.
The &quot;Paris à Orléans&quot; ordered a further 98 Pacific locomotives that were delivered between 1908 and 1910, and another 89 in 1909 and 1910. Another fifty were ordered from the American Locomotive Company in 1921 and forty of the type &quot;TP-État&quot; were bought in 1923. The company was particularly famous for the Chapelon Pacifics of 1929 to 1932.

The &quot;L&#x27;Ouest&quot; followed with two prototype locomotives in 1908, but did not continue with the Pacific type.

The Alsace-Lorraine built eight Pacific locomotives in 1909, at the time when the railway was still under German control. These became French locomotives in 1920.

The &quot;Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée&quot; (PLM) was the largest French user of Pacific locomotives, owning 462, built between 1909 and 1932. These were both compound and simple locomotives and were built both with and without superheaters. Large numbers were later rebuilt to compounds or to incorporate superheaters by both the PLM and the state-owned Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français (SNCF).
The &quot;Nord&quot; built 139 Pacific locomotives from 1912, including the various so-called &quot;Superpacific&quot; types of 1923 to 1931. The company also ordered Chapelon type rebuilds from the &quot;Paris à Orléans&quot; in 1934, and new-built locomotives between 1936 and 1938.
The &quot;L&#x27;État&quot; owned 352 Pacific locomotives, some of which were transferred from the Bavarian Railways and Württemberg Railways as Armistice reparations in 1918.

The &quot;Midi&quot; likewise owned altogether forty Pacific locomotives, acquired in three batches.

The eastern &quot;L&#x27;Est&quot; never built a , preferring its Ten-wheeler types until it progressed straight to the much larger Mountain type. The &quot;L&#x27;Est&quot; nevertheless bought Pacific locomotives to the designs of other companies, including forty &quot;TP-État&quot; type class 11 s locomotives between 1921 and 1923, and twelve class 12 s Chapelon rebuilds in 1934.

After nationalisation in 1938, the SNCF built no more Pacifics, although it continued to rebuild some of the existing stock running on lines already established by the private railway companies, particularly by continuing to apply the great improvements brought about by the work of André Chapelon.

===Germany===

The first Pacific locomotive for a German railway was the Baden IV f class for the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways (), designed by Maffei in 1905. However, due to manufacturing delays, the first three locomotives were not introduced until 1907, shortly after the first French Pacifics. They were four-cylinder compound locomotives of the Von Borries type. After the Maffei locomotives, a further 32 were built under license by Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Karlsruhe and delivered between 1907 and 1913.

While they were successful in the mountainous regions of the G.Bad.St.E., their small driving wheels led to overheating at high speed on level track. Consequently, a new design was created, the Baden IV h, twenty of which were built by Maffei between 1918 and 1920. Most lasted to the end of World War II, with four surviving as test locomotives – three for Deutsche Bundesbahn and one for Deutsche Reichsbahn. Three of these four have survived into preservation.
However, the most successful early German Pacific class was the Bavarian S 3/6 class of the Royal Bavarian State Railways (&quot;Königliche Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen&quot;), designed by Anton Hammel and Heinrich Leppla of Maffei. This was a larger development of the Baden IV f class, with a four-cylinder compound arrangement. Altogether 159 of them were built between 1908 and 1931, with the last one being retired from ordinary service in 1969.

When the various pre-First World War Pacific locomotives from the different German state railway companies were grouped together by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as the Class 18 with seven sub-classes, the Baden Class IV f became the DRG 18.2 class while the Bavarian S 3/6 class became the DRG 18.4-5 class.
During the 1920s and 1930s the Deutsche Reichsbahn continued to build new Pacific designs, such as the Class 01.10 to Class 03.10 subclasses.
* The Class 01, a two-cylinder standard type of the Deutsche Reichsbahn introduced between 1926 and 1938, was the first standardised steam express passenger locomotive class to be built for the unified German railway system.
* The Class 02 four-cylinder compound locomotive version was less successful, being costly to maintain. Only ten were built and all of them were rebuilt into two-cylinder 01 class locomotives between 1937 and 1942.
* The Class 03 was a lighter version of the 01 class, built between 1930 and 1938. Ten locomotives of the 03.10 class remained in Poland after World War II and were designated the Polish State Railways (PKP) class Pm3. (Also see Poland)

In 1957, only two prototypes of the streamlined Class 10 were built by Krupp for the Deutsche Bundesbahn. They were nicknamed &quot;Schwarze Schwäne&quot; (Black Swans) and survived until 1968.

===Hungary===

The Hungarian locomotive builder MÁVAG (&quot;Magyar Királyi Államvasutak Gépgyára&quot;) built several classes of locomotives after 1914, both for the Hungarian State Railways (&quot;Magyar Államvasutak&quot; or MÁV) and for export elsewhere in Europe. MÁV Pacific number 301.016 has been preserved at the Hungarian Railway Heritage Park Museum in Budapest. 

===India===
The earliest Indian locomotives were two Class C locomotives, built for the narrow gauge Darjeeling Himalayan Railway by the North British Locomotive Company in 1914. Both were retired in 1976. From the mid-1920s until the 1970s, the Pacific type became very common on both the broad gauge and narrow gauge lines in India.

====Broad gauge====

In 1924, the Locomotive Standards Committee of the Indian Government recommended eight basic types of locomotive for use on the sub-continent, three of which were . These were the XA class for branch line passenger working, the XB class for light passenger trains and the XC class for heavy passenger trains. The Vulcan Foundry built large numbers of all these classes for the different Indian railways between the late 1920s and early 1930s, beginning with fourteen each for the East Indian Railway Company (EIR) and the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR) in 1927.

In 1937, two XP class locomotives were built for the GIPR by Vulcan Foundry. These were experimental locomotives that formed the basis for India&#x27;s renowned WP class, designed by Railway Board designers in India specifically to use low-calorie, high-ash Indian coal. The WP class was introduced after World War II and remained the most prestigious locomotive of the Indian Railways (IR) until the 1980s. A few reconditioned WP class locomotives were later sold to countries in the Middle East.

There were also two WL classes. The first four locomotives, built in 1939 by Vulcan Foundry for the North Western State Railway, went to Pakistan upon the India-Pakistan partition. A second Indian WL class was introduced in 1955 and ten of these locomotives were built by Vulcan Foundry.

====Narrow gauge====
The Bengal Nagpur Railway had a saturated C class, a superheated CS class, and a CC class comprising C class locomotives that had been converted from saturated to superheated steam.
The South India Railway (SIR) ordered six YB class and two XB class Pacific locomotives from the Vulcan Foundry in 1928.

The Mysore State Railway had the E, ES and ES/1 classes.

The Scindia State Railway had a class of eight NM class locomotives, built by W. G. Bagnall in 1931.

The only post-World War II on narrow gauge Indian Railways were the five ZP class locomotives with six-wheel tenders, built by Nippon Sharyo in Japan in 1954.

===Indonesia===
In the early of 20th century, &quot;Staatsspoorwegen&quot; operated 4-4-0 two-cylinder compound SS Class 600 as express locomotives for mixed freight-passenger traffics in Java. SS imported 44 units of them in 1900-1908 from Hanomag, Hartmann and Werkspoor worked as the workhorse of express trains. In 1908, the line between Cheribon–Kroya had been built which shortened the travel time between Batavia and Surabaya. By the increase in the volume of freight and passenger transports, the SS 600s were felt to be not so fast and sufficient to serve the increasing flow of transports. As a result, SS ordered the new express locomotive to Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM) and Sächsische Maschinenfabrik (Hartmann) with specifications that it could haul a series of freights in flat-line weighing up to 300 tons and gain a top speed of 80 kilometres per hour (50 miles per hour). They received 11 units of their two-cylinder superheated 4-6-2 from SLM in 1911 and 1912, while the rest of 5 were from Hartmann in 1911 and 1914 and classified as the SS Class 700 (701-716). In a number of locomotive performance tests on the Cikampek-Pegadenbaru line in 1913, another on the Maos-Jogja line in 1914 and on Cikampek-Cheribon line in 1915, these locomotives could reach speeds of more than 120 kilometres per hour (75 miles per hour) and gained world fastest cape gauge locomotive in 1914-1915. SS remarked on the SS Class 700 as engine that had fast and stable performance and soon they were placed in Meester Cornelis, Jogjakarta, Madiun and Surabaya depots. By 1927, SS 701-705 were allocated to South Sumatra division (ZSS) for passenger and freight train transports.

With all the advantages of SS Class 700s followed by the increasing of demands and traffics, the SS was attracted in making their new faster and stronger locomotives. Therefore, they sent a proposal to Dutch engineers and were manufactured in Netherlands by &quot;Nederlandsche Fabriek van Werktuigen en Spoorwegmaterieel (Werkspoor)&quot;. Twenty of new advanced 4-6-2 locomotives arrived in 1920–1922 and classified as SS 1000 class (1001-1020) with a driver&#x27;s cabin design that tapered to forward giving the impression of grace and speed, in addition of wheel arrangement supplemented with four compound cylinders and superheater was expected to provide the faster, more stability and fuel efficiency that required to haul express trains, but this was not achieved. At the first of the performance test, the locomotive had shown poor performance especially when driven at speeds over 90 kilometres per hour (55 miles per hour). There some complaints that the SS Class 1000 locomotives were oscillated showed by record that the stoker couldn&#x27;t put a shovel of coal into firebox due to hard shaking when driven at speeds above 100 kilometres per hour (67 miles per hour), while excessive wear on the third driving wheels and there was design error in manufacturing which led to maintenance difficulties (in other records, they had a design flaw at the trailing wheels causing instability). However, SS still preserved it as the main engine hauling express trains with high maintenance costs. SS also recalled the SS 700s along with the 4-6-4T SS 1300s to haul express trains by bringing back their achievements on speed and stability. Ironically, the myriad achievements of the SS Class 700 were overshadowed by SS Class 1000 when worked to haul the &quot;Eendaagsche&quot; and &quot;Java Nacht&quot; express trains by 1929 and mid 1930s.

After Japanese occupation and Indonesian Independence, both locomotives renumbered as C50 and C53. The majority of the class had been scrapped after independence (around 1960-70s). It could be said the C50 classes were the extinct class of express locomotives due to lack of documentations and they were scrapped when the last 2 of them were still operating in Tanjungkarang around 1970s. The last survivor of C53 was number 17, which lasted until the final days of steam locomotives in Indonesia. During its last days in service before retirement, it was used to haul local passenger trains between Bangil and Surabaya Kota and now preserved as static display at the Transportation Museum of Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.

===Iraq===
When the Baghdad Railway was nearing completion between Mosul and the town of Tel Kotchek on the border with Syria, the Iraqi State Railways ordered four streamlined Pacific locomotives from Robert Stephenson &amp; Hawthorns in the United Kingdom, to haul the international &quot;Taurus Express&quot; between Istanbul in Turkey and Baghdad in Iraq on the Iraqi stage of its journey.

Three were delivered in 1941 and designated the PC class, but the fourth was lost &quot;en route&quot;. When the Iraqi standard gauge railways were dieselised in the 1960s, the class was withdrawn from service.

===Italy===

Between 1911 and 1914, 33 Pacific locomotives of the 690 class were built for the &quot;Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane&quot; (Italian State Railways), twenty by Breda in Milan, ten by Ansaldo in Genoa and three by &quot;Officine Meccaniche&quot; in Milan.

Between 1928 and 1931, these locomotives were rebuilt with larger boilers and reclassified as Class 691. One of them, no. 691.011, established the Italian speed record for steam locomotives at .

The whole class was withdrawn between 1962 and 1963. One locomotive, no. 691.022, has been preserved at the &quot;Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia di Milano&quot; (National Museum of Science and Technology of Milan). 

===Japan===

The Japanese Government Railways built a number of designs between 1920 and the 1950s. The most notable was possibly the JNR Class C51, the first Japanese-built high-speed passenger locomotive, used for express services on the &quot;Tōkaidō&quot; mainline and later on regional trunk lines. Five of these locomotives were built in 1920.

Other Japanese Pacific designs included the C52 class, built from 1926 to 1929, the C53 class, built from 1928 to 1929, the C54 class, built in 1931, the C55 class, the C57 class built from 1937 to 1953, and the C59 class.

The C57 Class, of which 201 were built by Kawasaki, &quot;Kisha Seizō&quot;, Mitsubishi and Hitachi, was the JNR&#x27;s last steam locomotive and was used until 1975 to work passenger trains on the Muroran mainline between Iwamizawa and Muroran in Hokkaido.

===Malawi===
The Nyasaland Railways (the Malawi Railways after independence) obtained six Class F Pacific type locomotives from the British War Department in 1946, to work on the Trans-Zambesi Railway (TZR). The locomotives had been built by the North British Locomotive Company in 1942 and were numbered TZR 25 to 30. All six were still in service on the Malawi Railways in 1973.

===Malaysia===
The Malayan Railway was amongst the earliest railways in Asia to adopt Pacific type locomotives. Sixty locomotives of the Federated Malay States Railways (FMSR) Class H were built between 1907 and 1914. With a small volume of highly rated freight traffic, it was possible to adopt standard engines for both passenger and freight services. Three coupled axles were sufficient to move the trains at moderate speeds over the whole Malayan rail network. 

As a result of experience gained with the first batch of locomotives, the design of Malayan Pacific locomotives was finalised and 68 engines of this design were eventually built. They had bar frames, steel fireboxes and three cylinders, each of . The coupled wheels were in diameter. The heating surface of the boiler was , of which was superheating surface, while the grate area was . The total weight in working order was 60.5 tons, with a maximum axle load of 12.9 tons. Its maximum speed in ordinary service was . The three cylinders were provided with rotary cam poppet valves with the camshaft divided into two parts, independently driven from each side of the engine, which avoided complete immobilisation in case of a breakdown on a long stretch of single track. These locomotives were all later converted to burn oil fuel. 

During World War II, after the fall of Singapore, the Japanese Southern Army&#x27;s Railway Engineering Troops transferred a number of older Malayan Pacific locomotives to operate their &quot;Taimen Rensetsu Tetsudo&quot;, the Thailand-Burma Railway. Some Pacifics were not returned to Malaya after the war but remained in Thailand. When the rail connection was established between the Malayan and Thai railways, the Pacifics were a common sight at the head of the &quot;Singapore&quot; and &quot;Bangkok expresses&quot; as well as on the other passenger trains in domestic Malayan service. 

After the arrival of the mainline diesel-electric locomotives in the latter part of the 1950s, the Pacifics were transferred to less important trains. Many survived up the end of Malayan steam traction in the 1970s. 

===Mexico===
The Canadian National (CN) sold a gauge Pacific locomotive, the former CN no. 591, to &quot;Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México&quot;, where it was numbered 139. (Also see Canada)

===Mozambique===
The &quot;Caminhos de Ferro de Lourenço Marques&quot; in Portuguese Mozambique ordered its first three class 300 Pacific locomotives from Baldwin in 1919. They hauled passenger trains on the line between Lourenço Marques (Maputo) and Ressano Garcia, and also crossed the South African border at Komatipoort in South Africa, from Lourenço Marques, where South African Railways locomotives took over for the rest of the way to Pretoria. Two more locomotives were added in 1923 and a further order for four additional Pacific locomotives was placed with Henschel in 1955, for use on the Beira–Bulawayo railway line.

Henschel also supplied three more modern Pacific type locomotives to Mozambique in 1955. These Henschel Pacifics weighed 73.75 tons in working order while its total weight, tender included, was 128 tons. The firegrate area was and it had cylinders and driving wheels. These locomotives were good examples of Pacific type passenger locomotives in Southern Africa. When they arrived, their older American-built counterparts were relieved of mainline duty to haul the Lourenço Marques local suburban services. All the Pacifics were allocated to the Lourenço Marques shed for the whole of their service lives and all were still in service in 1971.

===New Zealand===
The first true Pacifics, the original thirteen Q class locomotives built by Baldwin for the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) in 1901, worked until withdrawal in 1957. None has been preserved.

These were followed by 58 Pacific locomotives of the A class, built in 1906 by the NZR&#x27;s Addington Railway Workshops and by A &amp; G Price Limited. Two of these have been preserved. A further ten locomotives of the AA class were built by Baldwin in 1914.
The most notable class in New Zealand was the AB class, built between 1915 and 1927 by Addington, Price and the North British Locomotive Company in Scotland. These were reputed to be the first locomotives to generate one horsepower for every of weight and eventually became the most numerous class of steam locomotives in New Zealand, with a total of 143 built, and a further 12 rebuilt from WAB class Hudson tank engines. When they were superseded by new locomotives on the principal express and heaviest freight trains during the 1930s, they were used on secondary duties. The AB class locomotives remained in service until 1969, two years before the end of steam locomotive operations in New Zealand. As a result, seven of them have been preserved.
One further type was the G class. These were six three-cylinder Pacific locomotives that were rebuilt from three unsuccessful G class Garratt locomotives by NZR&#x27;s Hillside Workshops in 1937. They were equipped with AB class boilers, new roller bearing trailing trucks, new cabs and Vanderbilt type tenders of similar design to that of the AB class. Like the Garratts they were created from, the rebuilds were not considered successful.

In 1960 Ted Blomfield, locomotive fitter at Rotorua, New Zealand, built a &quot;Super Q&quot; Pacific for the 1 foot gauge Toot and Whistle Railway. The engine operated at Toot and Whistle&#x27;s Kuirau park railway for six years before officialdom demanded the locomotive be retired. It was replaced by a Black Five replica. Another &quot;Super Q&quot; exists as a 5 inch-gauge engine.

===Nigeria===
Between 1926 and 1928, the gauge Nigerian Railways ordered ten Class 405 Pacifics from Nasmyth, Wilson &amp; Company in Manchester, for express services on the line between Lagos and Kano. They used saturated steam and had outside cylinders and driving wheels. All ten were named and they hauled named trains like the &quot;North Mail&quot; and &quot;Boat Express&quot;, both averaging only between stops. They were ousted from principal passenger trains when the first mainline diesel locomotives arrived, but continued working less important secondary train services well into the 1970s.

===Philippines===
The Manila Railroad (MRR) operated two classes of this type. Unlike with most rail operators of the time, this was not the most popular wheel arrangement in its mainline steam locomotive fleet as types that had eight driving wheels such as 4-8-2 and 2-8-2 were more successful in the country.

The first were six 120 class 4-6-2T tank units built by the North British Locomotive Company of Glasgow. They were first built in 1906 and entered service in 1908. These were primarily used on various services on what was the PNR North Main Line. As larger tender locomotives built by American firms started entering service in the early 1920s, these were relegated to branch line and switching services. By 1952, only one unit survived and it was scrapped not long after. An expansion of the class was ordered in 1910. However, these two tank locomotives that were numbered 127 and 128, were 4-6-4T &quot;Baltic&quot; types which entered service in 1917.

The second were ten 140 class locomotives built by Baldwin between 1926 and 1929 as part of the modernization efforts of the MRR to replace its aging British-built tank locomotives throughout its network. These were used on express services on what is now the PNR South Main Line. In 1946, a number of these units were the first to return to service among the agency&#x27;s prewar fleet. By 1952, only two locomotives were in service. These were removed from service in 1956 and were scrapped in the 1960s.

===Poland===
In the Polish State Railways (&quot;Polskie Koleje Państwowe&quot; or PKP) locomotive classification system, locomotives with a 2C1 ( ) axle arrangement were identified with the letter &quot;m&quot; in the class prefix. Express locomotives therefore had a &quot;Pm&quot; prefix, passenger locomotives an &quot;Om&quot; prefix and tank passenger locomotives an &quot;OKm&quot; prefix.
The PKP class Pm36 consisted of two experimental Polish prototype express locomotives, built by Fablok of Chrzanów in 1937. One of them, no. Pm36-1, was streamlined, while the other had a standard appearance in order to compare their respective performances in terms of top speed, acceleration and coal and water consumption.

The Pm36-1 won a gold medal at the International Exposition of Modern Art and Technology in Paris in 1937. It was damaged and later scrapped during World War II, but Pm36-2 survived and worked on the PKP until 1965, when it was given to the Warsaw Railway Museum. In 1995, it was rebuilt and restored to mainline specifications and nicknamed &quot;Beautiful Helene&quot;. As of 2011, while still remaining museum property, the locomotive was in regular service at Wolsztyn.

Besides these two Polish-built locomotives, several German DRG class 03, class 0310 and class 181 locomotives (ex Württemberg Class C) and Austrian class 629 tank locomotives saw service in Poland as the classes Pm2, Pm3, Om101 and OKm11 respectively. (Also see Germany) and (Austria)

One narrow gauge Pacific locomotive, the &quot;Belgijka&quot;, built in 1935 by Ateliers Métallurgiques in Nivelles and Tubize in Belgium, was also used in Poland and is preserved at the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum in Wenecja, Poland.

===Portugal===
The Portuguese Railways (&quot;Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses&quot; or CP) had two batches of Pacific 2C1-h2 class locomotives running on its broad gauge lines, built by Henschel &amp; Son in 1924 and 1925. The first batch of ten locomotives, numbered 551 to 560, were used on lines south of the river Tagus, while the second batch of eight, numbered 501 to 508, were built for the Porto line north of the Tagus. Both Pacific classes had deep and narrow fireboxes and the same cylinders, coupled wheels and motion as the Ten-wheelers of the class CP 351 to 370.

The Pacifics were capable of very fast running. Before World War II, the CP was renowned for the speed of its trains. The track was carefully maintained, laid with rails, and the speed limit of was frequently reached with steam locomotives.

In normal service, these engines could haul 400 tons behind the tender at on level track. In 1939, a four-coach train weighing 170 tons and hauled by a Pacific locomotive of the class 501-508, covered the from Porto to Lisbon-Campolide in 189 minutes, at an average speed of , with stops at Papilhosa and Entroncamento. A distance of of slightly falling, level or slightly rising gradient could be covered at speeds of , while station stops lasting less than a minute were frequent.

These locomotives began to be replaced by diesels in the 1960s and disappeared from the scene in the early 1970s. One of the Pacific locomotives, no. 553, is preserved at the Santarém depot museum.

===Russia/Soviet Union===
Pacifics were not common in Russia. The only known examples were the four-cylinder L class express passenger locomotives, built by the Putilov Works at Saint Petersburg for the Vladikavkaz Railway in 1914. The chief designer was Vazlav Lopushinskii, who later emigrated from Soviet Russia. These locomotives were the most powerful passenger locomotives in Tsarist Russia. Eighteen locomotives were built between 1914 and 1919, allocated to the Rostov-on-Don, Tihoretskaya, Kavkazkaya, Armavir and Mineralnye Vody depots. They hauled principal express and heavy passenger trains between Rostov-on-Don and Vladikavkaz, a distance of . All were oil fired.

After the October Revolution, a further 48 L class locomotives were built at Putilov Works between 1922 and 1926. At first, these coal fired locomotives were allocated to the October Railway to haul principal passenger trains over a distance of of double track line between the two largest cities in Soviet Russia, Moscow and Leningrad. At the time, train speeds in Soviet Russia were slow and the fastest train took fourteen hours and thirty minutes between the two cities. The trains, which were running four return workings daily, were rather heavy with train loads often exceeding 700 metric tons behind the tender. In 1936, the express trains were running at an average speed of with four intermediate stops between these cities. Locomotives were usually changed at Tver.

When the production of the heavier Berkshire class IS &quot;Joseph Stalin&quot; got under way in 1937, the Pacifics were modified from coal to oil firing and transferred to join other older locomotives on the North Caucasus lines, from where they worked as far south as to Baku. In 1941, seventeen locomotives were allocated to the North Caucasus Railway, 29 to the Transcaucasus Railway and six to the Orenburg Railway. In 1942, during the German summer invasion into North Caucasus, all the class L Pacifics were evacuated from there to the Transcaucasus Railway. After World War II, in 1947, they were designated Lp class and were relieved from heavier duties. A number were withdrawn from service between 1956 and 1959. The last one, Lp class no. 151, was retired from Grozny depot in 1967.

In 1945, 34 Pacific locomotives of the Deutsche Reichsbahn&#x27;s Class 03 and two streamlined Class 03.10 Pacific locomotives fell into Russian hands in East Prussia. They were regauged to gauge and allocated to the Lithuanian Railways, where they hauled express and passenger trains from Vilnius to Kaliningrad (Königsberg) and to Minsk. The last ones were withdrawn from service in 1957.

===South Africa===

====Cape gauge====

=====Natal Government Railways=====

The first use of the wheel arrangement in South Africa was c. 1890. During 1887, designs for a 2-8-2 Mikado type tank-and-tender locomotive were prepared by the Natal Government Railways (NGR). The locomotive was built in the Durban workshops and entered service in 1888, named &quot;Havelock&quot;, but it was soon rebuilt to a 4-6-2 Pacific configuration. &quot;Havelock&quot; was the first locomotive to be designed and built in South Africa. During the Second Boer War &quot;Havelock&quot; saw action in service on armoured trains. Unlike usual practice in such cases, the engine was not equipped with armour plate protection, but was draped in strands of thick hemp rope which earned it the apt nickname &quot;Hairy Mary&quot; amongst the troops.
In 1901, the NGR rebuilt one of its Class K&amp;S  tank locomotives to a locomotive to extend its range by providing a larger bunker. In 1912, when it was assimilated into the South African Railways (SAR), it was designated Class C1. In that same year, four more of these locomotives were built from surplus material in the SAR&#x27;s Durban workshops.

No more tank locomotives with the Pacific wheel arrangement saw use on in South Africa. Two Class 2 variants were introduced on the NGR between 1905 and 1910.
* In 1905, two Class A Pacific tender locomotives entered service on the NGR, designed by Locomotive Superintendent D.A. Hendrie and built by NBL. They had plate frames, used saturated steam and had Stephenson valve gear. To accommodate the wide and deep firebox, Hendrie used a bridle casting similar to that introduced on the CGR by Beatty with his Class 6 2-6-2 Prairie in 1903. This method of widening the frames for the firebox continued in South African locomotive design until 1927, when the general adoption of bar frames rendered it no longer necessary. In 1912, they were designated Class 2 on the SAR.
* In addition, two more Class A locomotives, also known as Class Hendrie C, were built in the NGR&#x27;s Durban workshops in 1910. They were a redesigned version of the Hendrie A, similar in general proportions, but with Walschaerts valve gear, slightly larger diameter coupled wheels, a larger boiler and a more enclosed cab that offered better protection to the crew. In 1912, the SAR designated them Class 2C.

=====Cape Government Railways=====
The first locomotives with a Pacific wheel arrangement in the Cape were two tank locomotives that entered service in 1896 on the private Metropolitan and Suburban Railway that operated a suburban passenger service between Cape Town and Sea Point. In 1901, both locomotives were sold to the Mashonaland Railway.

Three Class 5 and one experimental Karoo tender locomotive variants were introduced on the Cape Government Railways (CGR) between 1903 and 1912.
* In 1903, the first two Karoo locomotives entered passenger service on the CGR. It was a development of the CGR Class 6 2-6-2 and was designed by Chief Locomotive Superintendent H.M. Beatty. The locomotives, built by Kitson and Company, were acquired to cope with the increasing weight of passenger trains on the one in eighty ruling gradient between Beaufort West and De Aar in the Karoo, hence the Karoo Class name. In 1912, when they came onto the SAR roster, they were designated Class 5A.
* Following on the success of the first two Karoo Class locomotives, a further four were ordered from Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company in 1904. They were modified slightly in view of the experience gained with the original two. On the SAR, they were all designated Class 5B, until one was later reboilered with a Watson Standard no. 1 boiler and reclassified Class 5BR. All of them were later equipped with piston valve cylinders and superheaters.
* In 1907, the CGR placed a single experimental three-cylinder compound Pacific in service, based on the second Karoo Class. Built by the North British Locomotive Company (NBL), it was not classified and was simply referred to as the Three Cylinder Compound. The cylinders were arranged in the Smith system of compounding, with a single high-pressure cylinder situated between the two low-pressure cylinders. The locomotive had a bar frame, Walschaerts valve gear and used saturated steam. Compared to a simplex two-cylinder Karoo, the compound could take a heavy train up a long continuous grade at a much higher speed, while experienced drivers found it could outperform the Karoo in terms of power as well as fuel and water consumption. In 1912, the SAR classified it as Class Experimental 1.
* The Enlarged Karoo, built by Vulcan Foundry, was one of the locomotive types that were designed and ordered by the CGR before the SAR was established and that ended up being delivered to the newly established national railways of the Union of South Africa in 1912. It was a larger and heavier version of the Class 5B, with a higher pitched boiler, Belpaire firebox, larger diameter leading and coupled wheels and larger cylinders. The four locomotives were designated Class 5. One of them was later reboilered with a Watson Standard no. 1 boiler, equipped with a superheater and reclassified to Class 5R.

=====Central South African Railways=====

Five Class 9 Pacific passenger locomotives, designed by P.A. Hyde, the first Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the Central South African Railways (CSAR), were delivered from Vulcan Foundry in 1904. They had bar frames, Stephenson valve gear and used saturated steam, and proved very useful for passenger work with moderate loads, working the mail trains from Johannesburg to Durban as far as Charlestown on the Transvaal-Natal border for many years. They retained their Class 9 classification on the SAR.
Five Class 10 variants were introduced between 1904 and 1910.
* Also in 1904 and also designed by Hyde, fifteen Class 10 Pacific locomotives were delivered to the CSAR from NBL. The locomotives were of an extremely advanced design, superheated and with the highest boiler pitch yet in South Africa, with plate frames, wide Belpaire fireboxes, outside admission piston valves and Walschaerts valve gear. In 1912, when they were assimilated into the SAR, they retained their Class 10 classification.
* Ten heavy Pacific passenger locomotives, designed by CSAR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) G.G. Elliot based on Hyde&#x27;s Class 10 design, were ordered from NBL and delivered in 1910. They had plate frames, Belpaire fireboxes and Walschaerts valve gear and were delivered in two variants, five of them using saturated steam while the rest were superheated. While similar to the Class 10, their boilers were arranged further forwards, their firebox throats and back plates were sloped instead of being vertical, they used inside admission piston valves and their valve gear was reversed by means of a vertical steam reversing engine mounted on the right-hand running board. They were all classified as Class 10-2 by the CSAR but, in 1912, the SAR designated the saturated steam locomotives Class 10A and the superheated ones Class 10B. A further five superheated Class 10B locomotives were delivered to the SAR from Beyer, Peacock in 1912.
* Twelve light Pacific locomotives were also placed in service by the CSAR in 1910, classified as Class 10-C. Designed by Elliot and built by NBL, they were similar to the Class 10-2, but slightly smaller and with smaller coupled wheels. They used saturated steam and had Belpaire fireboxes and Walschaerts valve gear, but they were soon reboilered and equipped with superheaters. In 1912 they were designated Class 10C by the SAR.
* One more Pacific was ordered by the CSAR from ALCO in 1910. It was superheated and built to very much the same specifications as that of the Class 10-2 of that same year, but with a bar frame. It was slightly more powerful than the Class 10-2 and was designated Class 10 by the CSAR, along with the fifteen locomotives of 1904. In 1912, the locomotive became the sole Class 10D on the SAR.

=====South African Railways=====
Seven Class 16 variants were introduced on the South African Railways (SAR) between 1914 and 1935.
* The Class 16 Pacific was designed by Hendrie, CME of the SAR from 1910 to 1922, and was built by NBL, who delivered twelve locomotives in 1914. The design closely followed that of the Class 15 Mountain type that was introduced at the same time from the same builders, and many parts were made interchangeable. They had Walschaerts valve gear, were superheated and had Belpaire fireboxes. At the time, it was considered a very large and powerful express locomotive, even when compared to British locomotives built to run on . With coupled wheels, the ratio of wheel diameter to rail gauge was the same as that of a Standard gauge locomotive having coupled wheels. Their tractive effort of at 75% boiler pressure exceeded the at 85% boiler pressure of Churchward&#x27;s &quot;The Great Bear&quot; on the Great Western Railway and equalled, also at 85% boiler pressure, that of Gresley&#x27;s subsequent Great Northern Pacifics. This made the Class 16 the most powerful express passenger locomotive design yet to have been built in Britain at the time.
* The Class 16A four-cylinder simplex Pacific of 1915 was designed by Hendrie and built by NBL. Two locomotives were delivered, identical in most respects to their predecessor Class 16 except that they had four cylinders instead of the usual two. All four cylinders were arranged in line below the smokebox and were the same size, with the outer cylinders driving the centre coupled wheels while the inner cylinders operated on a cranked leading coupled wheel axle. The result was a very smooth running locomotive, capable of very fast running, but since the available space on a Cape gauge locomotive prevented larger cylinders from being fitted, the four-cylinder design was never repeated by the SAR.
* The Class 16B Pacific, also designed by Hendrie, was also built by NBL, who delivered ten locomotives in November 1917. They were identical to the predecessor Class 16 and successor Class 16C in most respects, except that they had wider cabs than the Class 16, while the Class 16C had a combustion chamber in the firebox. All ten were eventually reboilered with Watson Standard no 2B boilers and Watson cabs with slanted fronts, and reclassified to Class 16CR.
* Ten Class 16C locomotives, also designed by Hendrie and built by NBL, were delivered in 1919 with another twenty following in 1922. Identical to predecessors Class 16 and Class 16B in most respects except for the addition of a combustion chamber, they proved to be excellent free-steaming, fast and reliable locomotives with a reserve of power greater than either of the predecessors. All thirty were later reboilered with Watson Standard no 2B boilers and also reclassified to Class 16CR.
* Seven Class 16D Pacific locomotives were built for the SAR by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1925 and 1926. The Class was designed for working the &quot;Union Limited&quot; and &quot;Union Express&quot; fast passenger trains, forerunners of the &quot;Blue Train&quot;, between Johannesburg and Cape Town. The builders conformed to SAR requirements, but also incorporated the latest American railway engineering practices and introduced several new features to the SAR, such as top feeds to the boiler, self-cleaning smokeboxes, Sellar&#x27;s drifting valves, grease lubrication and arch tubes to support the brick arch and improve circulation. It had a bar frame extending from the front buffer beam to the rear dragbox, while its size earned it the nickname &quot;Big Bertha&quot;. In 1926, no. 860 made locomotive history by hauling the &quot;Union Limited&quot; over the from Johannesburg to Cape Town in 29 hours.
* When orders for more Pacific locomotives were placed in 1928, the Class 16D design was modified by the CME, Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, who shortened the frame to end at the front of the firebox and added a bridle casting. This resulted in a wider frame below the firebox and cab and consequently more ashpan room. Fourteen Class 16DA locomotives were built to this design, six by Hohenzollern Locomotive Works in 1928 and eight by Baldwin in 1929. The Hohenzollern and Baldwin locomotives differed from the Class 16D only by virtue of its shortened frame.
* When A.G. Watson succeeded Collins as CME in 1929, he designed a boiler with a very wide firebox of the Wootten type, with a grate area of to improve the steaming properties of these locomotives. The grate was larger than that of the Hohenzollern and Baldwin locomotives and these boilers were installed on the final six Class 16DA locomotives, built by Henschel in 1930. These locomotives were sufficiently different from the Baldwin and Hohenzollern-builts to justify a separate classification such as Class 16DB, but this did not happen. The steaming ability of these six, known as the Class 16DA Wide Firebox, was phenomenal and led to the adoption of wide fireboxes without combustion chambers as the standard on all subsequent SAR mainline locomotives.
* The Class 16E Pacific was designed by Watson and built by Henschel, who delivered six locomotives in 1935. With its coupled wheels, it was considered to be the most remarkable Cape gauge express passenger locomotive ever built. The coupled wheels were the largest ever used on any less than locomotive, and it had an all-up weight and tractive effort equal to or exceeding that of most Pacifics outside North America. It used rotary cam poppet valve gear driven by outside rotary shafts, which resulted in extremely free-running characteristics. It also boasted the largest fire grate on any Pacific outside North America. The Class 16E had a Watson Standard no. 3A boiler and, at above rail level, its boiler centre-line was the highest-pitched on the SAR. This and the limitations of the loading gauge made it impossible to install a normal steam dome and its place was taken by an inspection man-hole. Steam was collected through numerous small feeder pipes fixed into two collector pipes, which were arranged as high as possible above the water surface. The collector pipes joined together to form a main steam pipe, in diameter, which led to the superheater header and multiple valve regulator, situated in the smokebox.

====Narrow gauge====
In 1906, two small side-tank locomotives, designed by Hendrie and built by Hunslet, entered service on the Estcourt-Weenen narrow gauge railway of the NGR. They had outside plate frames and used Walschaerts valve gear. They were commonly known as Hunslet Side Tanks since all narrow gauge locomotives on the NGR were designated Class N. Although they came onto the SAR roster in 1912, they were never classified since they were sold to the Moçâmedes Railway in Portuguese West Africa in 1915, long before a system of grouping narrow gauge locomotives into classes was introduced by the SAR somewhere between 1928 and 1930.
In 1907, the NGR placed another six tank locomotives in service, designed by Hendrie based on his Hunslet Side Tank. Built by Hawthorn Leslie and Company, they also had outside plate frames and used Walschaerts valve gear. They were commonly known as the Hawthorn Leslie Side Tanks and were acquired specifically for the new narrow gauge Donnybrook-Esperanza Railway in Natal. They came onto the SAR roster in 1912 and were later classified as Class NG3.

In 1908, two Pacific tank locomotives with bar frames and Walschaerts valve gear, built by Bagnall, entered service on the narrow gauge Walmer Branch of the CGR in Port Elizabeth. They came onto the SAR roster in 1912 and remained in service until the Walmer branch was closed in 1929.

In 1911, shortly before being amalgamated into the SAR, the NGR placed the first two of seven narrow gauge locomotives in service, built by Kerr, Stuart &amp; Company using the Hawthorn Leslie drawings for the Class NG3. Two more followed in 1913 and another three in 1914, also from Kerr, Stuart. While virtually identical to the Hawthorn Leslie Side Tanks, their boiler pitch had been raised to make a larger firebox possible. They also had higher side tanks and less ornate sand boxes on top of the boiler. Between 1928 and 1930 they were all classified as Class NG4.
In 1916, the SAR ordered six narrow gauge Pacific tender locomotives from Baldwin Locomotive Works. They had outside bar frames and Walschaerts valve gear and became popularly known as the &quot;Sixties&quot;, based on their engine number range. Typically American in appearance, with an ornate chimney cap and steam dome as well as a separate engine number on a disk on the front of the smokebox door, they were the only narrow gauge Pacific tender locomotives to see service on the SAR. Later designated Class NG10, they were placed in service on the Langkloof line between Port Elizabeth and Avontuur in the Eastern Cape, where they spent most of their working lives. In 1948, two of them were transferred to South West Africa (SWA). All six were withdrawn from service by 1962 as a direct result of the widening of the narrow gauge lines in SWA to .

A Pacific locomotive was ordered by the &quot;Ferrocarril Madrid-Aragon&quot; from &quot;Forges, Usines et Fonderies de Haine-Saint-Pierre&quot; in Belgium in 1914, but was not delivered, presumably due to the disruption to trade caused by World War I. The locomotive was eventually sold to the French-owned Imperial Railway Company of Ethiopia in 1923. (Also see Ethiopia)

In 1958, the &quot;Ferrocarril La Robla&quot; purchased four vintage Pacific locomotives from the Tunisian Railways. These had been built in 1914 by &quot;Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques&quot; (SACM). They were numbered 181 to 185 and were scrapped in the early 1970s after having served in Spain for more than ten years. (Also see Tunisia)

===Sweden===

In 1913, the Swedish State Railways (&quot;Statens Järnvägar&quot; or SJ) ordered eleven four-cylinder compound Pacific type locomotives from Nydqvist &amp; Holm (NOHAB) for the Stockholm-Malmö heavy express train service. They had coupled wheels with two and two cylinders. They were designated the SJ class F, numbered from 1200 to 1209 and 1271.

The locomotives were limited to a maximum speed of . They hauled express trains on this southern mainline until the electrification of the Stockholm-Malmö line in 1933. The SJ then tried them on the Gothenburg non-electrified section, but they were not a success on this line which was also due to be electrified. They were then all sold to the neighbouring Danish State Railways (DSB) in 1937.

After they were withdrawn from service in Denmark, DSB no. 964 (ex SJ no. 1200) was presented to the Swedish Railway Museum at Gävle in 1964, while DSB no. 966 (ex SJ no. 1202) was presented to SJ AB by the Danish Railway Museum in 1999, to haul heritage trains.

===Taiwan===

The first Pacific type locomotives appeared in Formosa (now Taiwan) in 1912 when ALCO-Rogers delivered three locomotives that were derived from the Japanese Government Railways type 8900. They were numbered from 200 to 202. One more locomotive, number 203, was delivered in 1913. They hauled the most important passenger express trains between Taihoku and Takao. 

In 1935, five more locomotives of the Japanese Government Railways Class 55 were added, numbered 551 to 555, and in 1938 four more were delivered, numbered 556 to 559. 

Hitachi delivered eight more Japanese Class 57 locomotives, presumably as war reparations, to the Taiwan Railway Administration. These were the last Pacific type locomotives to arrive in Taiwan under the Chiang Kai-shek administration. 

===Thailand===

The Royal State Railways of Siam (RSR), the predecessor of the State Railway of Thailand (SRT), introduced new standard Pacific locomotives for express trains and mixed-traffic trains to supersede the E-Class locomotives which had been commissioned between 1915 and 1921. The first type of Pacific Locomotive was purchased from Batignolles-Châtillon in France in 1925. Others followed from Baldwin Locomotive Works between 1926 and 1929 and were prominent on Southern lines. There were also the successful Hanomag Pacific locomotives of 1928–1929, the design of which late became a model for the Pacific locomotives imported from Japan.

The final type of Pacific steam locomotive was when RSR imported the parts for 10 locomotives, based on the Hanomag design, from Japan during 1942 and 1943. However, assembly of these at the Makkasan Factory was not completed until 1945.

After the World War II, RSR imported a further thirty Pacific type locomotives from Japan in 1949–50, numbered 821 to 850. Two of them, numbers 824 and 850, were still in service with SRT in 2014 for special nostalgic trips.

===Tunisia===

====Standard gauge====
In 1914, the Tunisian Chemins de fer Bône-Guelma placed five Pacific locomotives in service at Tunis, built by &quot;Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques&quot; (SACM). They were numbered 181 to 185, later to be renumbered to Tunisian Railways (&quot;Société Nationale de Chemins de Fer Tunisiens&quot;) numbers 231.181 to 231.185. A further four were supplied in 1923 and three more in 1938, also built by SACM. They worked the line from Tunis to Ghardimaou on the Algerian border, hauling the Tunis-Algiers direct express trains. They also worked some semi-fast passenger trains on the line between Tunis and Bizerta.

They hauled all principal express and passenger trains between Tunis Ville and Ghardimaou until 1951, when the new mainline diesels relegated them to secondary trains. All were withdrawn from service during 1954 and 1955.

====Metre gauge====
Also in 1914, the &quot;Chemins de fer Bône-Guelma&quot; ordered five locomotives from SACM. The engine weight in working order was 56.6 metric tonnes, with coupled wheels of diameter and two cylinders.

They were considered very successful and Tunisian Railways ordered three more in 1928. These were used on the mainline south from Tunis to Sousse and the line to Sfax. Between the two World Wars, they were renowned for providing the fastest metre gauge service in the world and speeds of over were common in ordinary service.
When the Tunisian Railways dieselised between 1951 and 1955, these locomotives were withdrawn from service and placed in staging, even though as late as in 1952 they still regularly achieved speeds of up to . In 1958, numbers 231.801, 231.805, 231.807 and 231.808 were sold to the &quot;Ferrocarril La Robla&quot; in Spain. Those which remained in Tunisia were scrapped in 1959. (Also see Spain)

===United Kingdom===
====Tender locomotives====

Prior to the 1923 Grouping, only five locomotives had been built in the United Kingdom. The first of these was No. 111, &quot;The Great Bear&quot;, introduced by the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1908. This was an experimental locomotive which proved to be more powerful than the railway&#x27;s requirements and also too heavy for much of its infrastructure. As a result, it was scrapped in 1924 and many of the parts were used to build a GWR 4073 Castle Class &quot;ten-wheeler&quot;&quot; locomotive.

The Great Northern Railway (GNR) and the North Eastern Railway (NER) each built two Pacific types in 1922, later to become the Classes A1/A3 and A2 on the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Further examples of these two classes were built by the LNER after 1923.
The GNR Class A1, designed by Nigel Gresley and later rebuilt into the improved Class A3, featured three cylinders and an innovative conjugated valve gear. The class eventually consisted of 79 locomotives. After initial teething problems, it proved to be an excellent design and one of them, &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;, was the first locomotive to be officially recorded as reaching .
This speed was surpassed by the streamlined LNER Class A4 of 1935, when No. 2509 &quot;Silver Link&quot; reached on its inaugural run in 1935. Three years later, on 3 July 1938, No. 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot; touched , which is still the world speed record for steam traction. 35 locomotives of the class were built by 1938.

A further 89 Pacific locomotives of the Peppercorn Class A1, Thompson Class A1/1, Peppercorn Class A2, Thompson Class A2/1, Thompson Class A2/2 and Thompson Class A2/3 were either built or rebuilt for the LNER by Edward Thompson and Arthur Peppercorn, although many actually only appeared in the British Railways (BR) era after 1948. In 2008, one further locomotive of the Peppercorn Class A1 design, the 60163 &quot;Tornado&quot;, was built by the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust.
The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) introduced its twelve Princess Royal Class Pacific locomotives in 1933 and then enlarged the design with the streamlined Princess Coronation Class of 1937. 37 locomotives of the Coronation Class were built by 1947, with one more appearing in 1948 in the BR era. Coronation No. 6220, the first of the class, reached on 29 June 1937 and briefly held the British speed record for steam traction, until it was bettered by the LNER &quot;Mallard&quot; a year later. The LMS Princess Royal Class was also used as the basis for an unusual experimental locomotive, the Turbomotive, which used turbines instead of cylinders.

During World War II, the Southern Railway (SR) introduced two classes of Pacific, designed by New Zealander Oliver Bulleid. These were the Merchant Navy Class and the West Country and Battle of Britain Class. These two classes continued to be built in the BR era and eventually totalled thirty Merchant Navy Class locomotives and 110 West Country and Battle of Britain Class locomotives.

The 55 BR Standard Class 7 &quot;Britannia&quot; Pacifics, introduced in 1951, were of a simple expansion two-cylinder design with Walschaerts valve gear. Their conservative design reflected a requirement for a more cost-effective, lower maintenance locomotive. Ten locomotives of a lighter version, the BR Standard Class 6, were introduced in 1952.

The final Pacific design in the United Kingdom was the BR Standard class 8 No. 71000 &quot;Duke of Gloucester&quot;, of which only one was built in 1954. It had many parts in common with the Britannias, but had three cylinders and Caprotti valve gear.

====Tank locomotives====
Four tank locomotive designs were introduced in the United Kingdom during 1910 and 1911. Charles Bowen-Cooke of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) introduced his Prince of Wales Tank Class in 1910. It was a tank locomotive version of his successful  Prince of Wales Class. 47 were built for suburban services out of Euston station.

In the same year, the NER Class Y, designed by Wilson Worsdell and later to become the LNER Class A7, was introduced by Worsdell&#x27;s successor for hauling coal trains. It had been developed from the NER Class X  heavy shunters, later the LNER Class T1.
Also in 1910, D. E. Marsh of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) designed an entirely new J1 class locomotive for London to Brighton express trains. Only one was built before his successor, Lawson Billinton, altered the design to create the J2 class.

The most successful and longest surviving British class was the 9N class, later the LNER A5 class, of the Great Central Railway (GCR), introduced in 1911. It was designed by John G. Robinson and the last of the class survived until 1961. Four batches were built between 1911 and 1923 and a fifth batch was ordered by the LNER in 1926.

Another tank class, the Caledonian Railway 944 Class Class designed by William Pickersgill, appeared in 1917 with twelve locomotives built by North British Locomotive Company. They were nicknamed the &quot;Wemyss Bay Pugs&quot; since several of the class were allocated to do the Glasgow to Wemyss Bay suburban express work. In Scotland, all tank locomotives were called &quot;Pugs&quot;, even large ones like this Caledonian Pacific class and the large Glasgow and South Western Railway Baltic class.

In 1921 and 1922, Robert Urie of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) built five H16 class locomotives for short-distance transfer freight trains in the London area. These survived in service until 1962.

===United States===

The 4-6-2 wheel arrangement was first used in the United States in 1886. This was an unusual double-cab or &quot;Mother Hubbard&quot; type with an unusually large firebox, designed to use the waste tailings from anthracite coal mines. While this design did not become popular, the 4-6-2 was rediscovered for the same reason, to improve the 4-6-0 Ten-wheeler with a larger firebox.

With altogether 697 Pacific locomotives, the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) was the largest user of the type in the United States. The railroad bought its first experimental class from ALCO in 1907. After testing, a further 257 Pacific locomotives in various versions, designated classes , , and , were built by the PRR at its Altoona Works and by ALCO and Baldwin between 1910 and 1913.
In 1911, the PRR ordered an experimental K-29 class from ALCO, with a larger boiler, superheater, mechanical stoker and other innovations. A similar K4 class locomotive was built by the PRR in 1914, but no more were built until 1917. Between 1917 and 1928, the PRR built 349 K-4s locomotives and Baldwin a further 75, bringing the total of the K4s class to 425.

The last PRR Pacific locomotives were two large class K5 locomotives, built in 1929. No. 5698 was built at the PRR Altoona Works and had Walschaerts valve gear, while No. 5699 was built by Baldwin and had Caprotti valve gear. Although successful, these locomotives were not replicated, since the larger Mountain types began to be introduced. No. 5698 was dropped from the roster in October 1952 and no. 5699 was retired in September 1953.

The first modern example of the type to be built for duty in the United States, was built for the Missouri Pacific in 1902, but the chief proponent of the type west of the Mississippi River was the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, who began buying the type the next year and ultimately owned 274. The road would have pioneered the type, if not for a belief that a two-wheeled lead truck would be sufficient for high speed passenger service. They began buying 2-6-2 Prairie types in quantity from Baldwin in 1901, with the four cylinder Vauclain compound system, a weight of and coupled wheels.

When these proved insufficiently stable for high speed service, the road ordered the 1200 class of 4-6-2 Pacifics, which were two cylinder simplex engines weighing and fitted with coupled wheels on unusually long axle centers. Immediately upon their arrival on the property, their drive wheels were swapped with the drivers off the earlier Prairie types, which became fast freight locomotives. These would wind up in branch line service, where they were very successful and ultimately outlasted the Pacifics.

The Santa Fe ordered additional Pacific types of both four cylinder balanced compound and two cylinder simple types in seven classes through 1914. These gradually increased to and invariably rode on drivers. The simple types tended to run conservative pressures at , while the compounds ran at . The early examples used a firebox grate of , but the last few classes had larger grates of . All of these were considered light Pacifics by the road, and there were a few engines of orphan classes as well. Some of these were scrapped as compounds, but most were rebuilt with two simple cylinders and operating pressure.

The railroad began scrapping these in 1932, but regretted it during the massive traffic of World War II. Two were semi-streamlined for a brief period during 1939. They hauled varied passenger trains and saw occasional duty in local freight and helper service. All were out of service by 1955. They initially served on the western portion of the Santa Fe system, west of La Junta, Colorado, where the line traversed the Rocky Mountains. Atlantic types were generally used on the Great Plains. Later, as passenger cars grew to 85 feet (26m) in length and gained weight due to all-steel construction, Pacifics would replace the Atlantic types in the east and the western stretches would be served by new 4-8-2 Mountain and 4-8-4 Northern types.

These engines were not dissimilar to the USRA Light Pacifics introduced during World War I, but differed in certain respects. The Santa Fe, like most large United States railroads, was accustomed to custom-designing their own power and refused to buy USRA designs during the ill-fated nationalization of the United States railroads under Wilson. This era, however, did allow many smaller railroads to modernize their fleets and it also saw the rise of the USRA Heavy Pacific. The Pennsylvania K-series served as a prototype for these, but they differed in important aspects such as the PRR&#x27;s Belpaire fireboxes.

The Santa Fe did not buy any USRA Heavy Pacifics, either, but after the war, Baldwin began building the new and even heavier 3400 Class for the road. These were huge at , but were otherwise a conservative design with two simple cylinders, Walschaerts valve gear, of grate and boilers. Fifty were built by Baldwin through 1924 but, while improvements to the light Pacifics were mostly confined to simplification and other updates were only sporadically applied, all of the 3400s were built or retrofitted with feedwater heaters and all but six were to receive diameter driving wheels before or during World War II. All got a pressure increase to , nine received thermic syphons, and a little experimentation was done with combustion chambers and roller bearings. Weights ultimately reached . These, too, were mostly out of service by 1955. Six Santa Fe Pacific types survive, most of them of the heavy 3400 Class.
Most of the United States railroads which offered passenger service, used Pacific types. Except for the custom design and sheer volume of units produced, the experience of railroads in the eastern and western United States was not dissimilar to that of the Pennsylvania and Santa Fe, respectively. Some roads developed these into the Hudson (or Baltic) type , others preferred the versatility of the Mountain and Northern types, and some, like the Santa Fe, bought both. One railroad, the St. Louis-San Francisco or &quot;Frisco&quot;, actually converted a few existing Pacific types to Hudsons with larger fireboxes in their Springfield shops. The Pacific type, however, was far and away the predominant passenger service steam engine in the United States until the end of steam. Lighter streamlined cars led to a resurgence of the light Pacific, with several railroads applying streamlined shrouds to older engines. The last Pacific built for service in the United States was delivered to the Reading in 1948. Most or all Pacifics were out of regular service by 1960.

One notable , the Soo Line 2719 which hauled the last of the Soo Line Railroad&#x27;s steam-powered trains in 1959, was preserved and was restored to operating condition for excursions. It is now on display at the Lake Superior Railroad Museum in Duluth, Minnesota.

<text>The American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) is a professional not-for-profit theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1979 by Robert Brustein, the A.R.T. is known for its commitment to new American plays and music–theater explorations; to neglected works of the past; and to established classical texts reinterpreted in refreshing new ways. Over the past forty years it has garnered many of the nation&#x27;s most distinguished awards, including a Pulitzer Prize (1982), a Tony Award (1986), and a Jujamcyn Award (1985). In 2002, the A.R.T. was the recipient of the National Theatre Conference&#x27;s Outstanding Achievement Award, and it was named one of the top three theaters in the country by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2003. The A.R.T. is housed in the Loeb Drama Center at Harvard University, a building it shares with the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club. The A.R.T. operates the Institute for Advanced Theater Training. 

In 2002 Robert Woodruff replaced founder Robert Brustein as the A.R.T.&#x27;s artistic director. After Woodruff&#x27;s departure in 2007, Associate Artistic Director Gideon Lester filled the position for the 2008/2009 season, and, in May 2008, Diane Paulus was named the new artistic director. Paulus, a Harvard alum, is widely known as a director of theater and opera. Her work includes &quot;The Donkey Show&quot;, which ran off-Broadway for six years; productions at the Chicago Opera Theatre; and the Public Theater&#x27;s 2008 production of &quot;Hair&quot;, which won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical. 

==History==

American Repertory Theater was established at Harvard in 1979 as a permanent professional arts organization on campus that offered undergraduate courses in acting, directing, and dramaturgy, taught by professional members of the company with teaching experience. Robert Brustein served as artistic director of the theater until 2002, when he was succeeded by Robert Woodruff, founder of the Bay Area Playwrights Festival. In 2008, Diane Paulus became the artistic director.

During its 44-year history, it has welcomed many major American and international theater artists, presenting a diverse repertoire that includes premieres of American plays and musical productions. In the over 250 productions American Repertory Theater has staged, over half were premieres of new plays, translations, and adaptations. The A.R.T. has performed throughout the U.S. and worldwide in 21 cities in 16 countries on four continents. It continues to be a training ground for young artists, with the artistic staff teaching undergraduate classes in acting, directing, dramatic literature, dramaturgy, voice, and design. In 1987, the A.R.T. founded the Institute for Advanced Theater Training at Harvard, which offers a five-semester M.F.A. graduate program that operates in conjunction with the Moscow Art Theatre School.

The current artistic director, Diane Paulus, has focused on expanding the boundaries of traditional theater by transforming the ways in which work is developed, programmed, produced, and contextualized in order to allow the audience to participate, thereby making the experience more interactive. Productions such as &quot;Sleep No More&quot;, &quot;The Donkey Show&quot;, &quot;Gatz&quot;, &quot;The Blue Flower&quot;, &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, &quot;Gershwin&#x27;s Porgy and Bess&quot;, &quot;Wild Swans&quot;, and &quot;Pippin&quot; have engaged audiences in unique theatrical experiences through physical interaction and unconventional staging.
The theater&#x27;s productions have garnered eighteen Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical for its productions of &quot;Pippin&quot; (2013) and &quot;Gershwins&#x27; Porgy and Bess&quot; (2012), Best Musical for &quot;Once&quot; (2012), and Best Play &quot;All The Way&quot; (2014). The A.R.T. also received the Tony Award for Outstanding Regional Theater, the Pulitzer Prize, and multiple Elliot Norton and IRNE awards. Its premiere production of &quot;Death and the Powers: The Robots&#x27; Opera&quot; was a 2012 Pulitzer Prize finalist.

==Educational institution==
In 1987, the A.R.T. founded the Institute for Advanced Theater Training, a five-semester professional training program which includes a three-month period working and training at the Moscow Art Theatre School in Russia. The program provides training for graduate-level actors, dramaturgs, and voice students. From 1999 until 2016, this joint program conferred an M.F.A. from the Moscow Art Theatre School, along with a certificate of completion from Harvard. Beginning with the graduating class of 2017, students have been granted a master of liberal arts degree through the Harvard Extension School.

In July 2017, the U.S. Department of Education voiced concern over the worrisomely high debt-load of students completing the program. In response, the A.R.T. Institute announced a three-year pause in admissions, while it sought to improve student financial aid. It continues to negotiate with Harvard University about establishing an M.F.A. degree.

==Performance venues==

===OBERON===
OBERON, sometimes referred to as Club Oberon, was a club theater venue that was built by the Carr Foundation in 2004 and opened in August 2009 as A.R.T.&#x27;s second venue. The A.R.T. opened the space in 2006 as the Zero Arrow Street Theater. The Onion Cellar was staged there Dec 2006-Jan 2007. A.R.T. originally used OBERON for the open ended residency of their production of &quot;The Donkey Show&quot;; however, American Repertory soon decided to convert the theater into a fully functioning club theater venue, fitting the philosophy developed by &quot;The Donkey Show&quot; creator Randy Weiner.

In 2021, The A.R.T. decided not to renew its lease and Oberon was closed. 

===Other venues===
Before OBERON, A.R.T. used the old Hasty Pudding theater as a second space in addition to the Loeb Mainstage. A.R.T.&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Theater Training formerly used the sub-basement of the First Parish in Cambridge at Zero Church Street, as a flexible venue. In May, 2015 the A.R.T. staged an opera premiere at the Shubert Theater in Boston, their first use of that venue.

<text>David Courtenay Marr (19 January 1945 – 17 November 1980) was a British neuroscientist and physiologist. Marr integrated results from psychology, artificial intelligence, and neurophysiology into new models of visual processing. His work was influential in computational neuroscience and led to a resurgence of interest in the discipline.

== Biography ==
Born in Woodford, Essex, and educated at Rugby School; he was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 1 October 1963 (having been awarded an Open Scholarship and the Lees Knowles Rugby Exhibition).

He was awarded the Coutts Trotter Scholarship in 1966 and obtained his BA in mathematics the same year. He was elected a Research Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1968. His doctoral dissertation, supervised by Giles Brindley, was submitted in 1969 and described his model of the function of the cerebellum based mainly on anatomical and physiological data garnered from a book by J.C. Eccles. His interest turned from general brain theory to visual processing. Subsequently, he worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he took on a faculty appointment in the Department of Psychology in 1977 and was subsequently made a tenured full professor in 1980. Marr proposed that understanding the brain requires an understanding of the problems it faces and the solutions it finds. He emphasised the need to avoid general theoretical debates and instead focus on understanding specific problems.

Marr died of leukemia in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the age of 35. His findings are collected in the book &quot;Vision: A computational investigation into the human representation and processing of visual information&quot;, which was finished mainly in the summer of 1979, was published in 1982 after his death and re-issued in 2010 by The MIT Press. This book had a key role in the beginning and rapid growth of computational neuroscience field. He was married to Lucia M. Vaina of Boston University&#x27;s Department of Biomedical Engineering and Neurology.

There are various academic awards and prizes named in his honour. The Marr Prize, one of the most prestigious awards in computer vision, the &quot;David Marr Medal&quot; awarded every two years by the &quot;Applied Vision Association&quot; in the UK, and the Cognitive Science Society also awards a Marr Prize for the best student paper at its annual conference.

== Work ==
===Theories of cerebellum, hippocampus, and neocortex===
Marr is best known for his work on vision, but before he began work on that topic he published three seminal papers proposing computational theories of the cerebellum (in 1969), neocortex (in 1970), and hippocampus (in 1971). Each of those papers presented important new ideas that continue to influence modern theoretical thinking.

The cerebellum theory was motivated by two unique features of cerebellar anatomy: (1) the cerebellum contains vast numbers of tiny granule cells, each receiving only a few inputs from &quot;mossy fibers&quot;; (2) Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex each receive tens of thousands of inputs from &quot;parallel fibers&quot;, but only one input from a single &quot;climbing fiber&quot;, which however is extremely strong. Marr proposed that the granule cells encode combinations of mossy fibre inputs, and that the climbing fibres carry a &quot;teaching&quot; signal that instructs their Purkinje cell targets to modify the strength of synaptic connections from parallel fibres.

The theory of neocortex was primarily motivated by the discoveries of David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, who found several types of &quot;feature detectors&quot; in the primary visual area of the cortex. Marr proposed, generalising on that observation, that cells in the neocortex are flexible categorizers—that is, they learn the statistical structure of their input patterns and become sensitive to combinations that are frequently repeated.

The theory of hippocampus (which Marr called &quot;archicortex&quot;) was motivated by the discovery by William Scoville and Brenda Milner that destruction of the hippocampus produced amnesia for memories of new or recent events but left intact memories of events that had occurred years earlier. Marr called his theory &quot;simple memory&quot;: the basic idea was that the hippocampus could rapidly form memory traces of a simple type by strengthening connections between neurons. Remarkably, Marr&#x27;s paper only preceded by two years a paper by Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo that provided the first clear report of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, a type of synaptic plasticity very similar to what Marr hypothesized. (Marr&#x27;s paper contains a footnote mentioning a preliminary report of that discovery.) The details of Marr&#x27;s theory are no longer of great value because of errors in his understanding of hippocampal anatomy, but the basic concept of the hippocampus as a temporary memory system remains in a number of modern theories. At the end of his paper Marr promised a follow-up paper on the relations between the hippocampus and neocortex, but no such paper ever appeared.

===Levels of analysis===

Marr treated vision as an information processing system. He put forth (in concert with Tomaso Poggio) the idea that one must understand information processing systems at three distinct, complementary levels of analysis. This idea is known in cognitive science as Marr&#x27;s Tri-Level Hypothesis:
* computational level: what does the system do (e.g.: what problems does it solve or overcome) and similarly, why does it do these things
* algorithmic level (sometimes representational level): how does the system do what it does, specifically, what representations does it use and what processes does it employ to build and manipulate the representations
* implementational/physical level: how is the system physically realised (in the case of biological vision, what neural structures and neuronal activities implement the visual system)

Marr illustrates his tripartite analysis recurring to the example of a device whose functioning is well understood: a cash register.

At the computational level, the functioning of the register can be accounted for in terms of arithmetic and, in particular, in terms of the theory of addition: at this level are relevant the computed function (addition), and such abstract properties of it, as commutativity or associativity. The level of representation and algorithm specify the form of the representations and the processes elaborating them: &quot;we might choose Arabic numerals for the representations, and for the algorithm we could follow the usual rules about adding the least significant digits first and `carrying&#x27; if the sum exceeds 9&quot;. Finally, the level of implementation has to do with how such representations and processes are physically realized; for example, the digits could be represented as positions on a metal wheel, or, alternatively, as binary numbers coded by the electrical states of digital circuitry. Notably, Marr pointed out that the most important level for the design of effective systems is the computational one.

===Stages of vision===
Marr described vision as proceeding from a two-dimensional visual array (on the retina) to a three-dimensional description of the world as output. His stages of vision include:
*a primal sketch of the scene, based on feature extraction of fundamental components of the scene, including edges, regions, etc. Note the similarity in concept to a pencil sketch drawn quickly by an artist as an impression.
*a 2.5D sketch of the scene, where textures are acknowledged, etc. Note the similarity in concept to the stage in drawing where an artist highlights or shades areas of a scene, to provide depth.
*a 3D model, where the scene is visualised in a continuous, 3-dimensional map.

2.5D sketch is related to stereopsis, optic flow, and motion parallax. The 2.5D sketch represents that in reality we do not see all of our surroundings but construct the viewer-centered three dimensional view of our environment. 2.5D Sketch is a so-called paraline drawing technique of data visualization and often referred to by its generic term &quot;axonometric&quot; or &quot;isometric&quot; drawing and is often used by modern architects and designers.

Marr&#x27;s three-stage framework does not capture well a central stage of visual processing: visual attention. A more recent, alternative, framework proposed that vision is composed instead of the following three stages: encoding, selection, and decoding. Encoding is to sample and represent visual inputs (e.g., to represent visual inputs as neural activities in the retina). Selection, or attentional selection, is to select a tiny fraction of input information for further processing, e.g., by shifting gaze to an object or visual location to better process the visual signals at that location. Decoding is to infer or recognize the selected input signals, e.g., to recognize the object at the center of gaze as somebody&#x27;s face.

<doc id="417032" wikidata="Q2372455" url="?curid=417032" title="Major chord">
<text>In music theory, a major chord is a chord that has a root, a major third, and a perfect fifth. When a chord comprises only these three notes, it is called a major [[Triad (music)|triad]]. For example, the major triad built on C, called a C major triad, has pitches C–E–G:
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
{ \omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&#x27; { &lt;c e g&gt;1 } }
&lt;/score&gt;

In harmonic analysis and on lead sheets, a C major chord can be notated as C, CM, CΔ, or Cmaj. A major triad is represented by the integer notation {0, 4, 7}.

A major triad can also be described by its intervals: the interval between the bottom and middle notes is a major third, and the interval between the middle and top notes is a minor third. By contrast, a minor triad has a minor third interval on the bottom and major third interval on top. They both contain fifths, because a major third (four semitones) plus a minor third (three semitones) equals a perfect fifth (seven semitones). Chords that are constructed of consecutive (or &quot;stacked&quot;) thirds are called &quot;tertian.&quot;

In Western classical music from 1600 to 1820 and in Western pop, folk and rock music, a major chord is usually played as a triad. Along with the minor triad, the major triad is one of the basic building blocks of tonal music in the Western common practice period and Western pop, folk and rock music. It is considered consonant, stable, or not requiring resolution. In Western music, a minor chord &quot;sounds darker than a major chord&quot;, giving off a sense of sadness or somber feeling.

Some major chords with additional notes, such as the major seventh chord, are also called major chords. Major seventh chords are used in jazz and occasionally in rock music. In jazz, major chords may also have other chord tones added, such as the ninth and the thirteenth scale degrees.

==Inversions==
A given major chord may be voiced in many ways. For example, the notes of a C major triad, C–E–G, may be arranged in many different vertical orders and the chord will still be a C major triad. However, if the lowest note (i.e. the bass note) is &quot;not&quot; the root of the chord, then the chord is said to be an inversion: it is in root position if the lowest note is the root of the chord, it is in first inversion if the lowest note is its third, and it is in second inversion if the lowest note is its fifth. These inversions of a C major triad are shown below.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\omit Score.TimeSignature
\override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t
\set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 1/4)
\relative c&#x27; {
 &lt;c e g&gt;1^\markup { \column { &quot;Root&quot; &quot;position&quot; } }
 &lt;e g c&gt;1^\markup { \column { &quot;First&quot; &quot;inversion&quot; } }
 &lt;g c e&gt;1^\markup { \column { &quot;Second&quot; &quot;inversion&quot; } }
}
&lt;/score&gt;
The additional notes above the bass note can be in any order and the chord still retains its inversion identity. For example, a C major chord is considered to be in first inversion if its lowest note is E, regardless of how the notes above it are arranged or even doubled.

==Major chord table==
In this table, the chord names are in the leftmost column. The chords are given in root position. For a given chord name, the following three columns indicate the individual notes that make up this chord. Thus in the first row, the chord is C major, which is made up of the individual pitches C, E and G.

==Just intonation==
Most Western keyboard instruments are tuned to equal temperament. In equal temperament, each semitone is the same distance apart and there are four semitones between the root and third, three between the third and fifth, and seven between the root and fifth.

Another tuning system that is used is just intonation. In just intonation, a major chord is tuned to the frequency ratio 4:5:6.

This may be found on I, IV, V, VI, III, and VI. In equal temperament, the fifth is only two cents narrower than the just perfect fifth, but the major third is noticeably different at about 14 cents wider.

<text>In music theory, a minor chord is a chord that has a root, a minor third, and a perfect fifth. When a chord comprises only these three notes, it is called a minor [[Triad (music)|triad]]. For example, the minor triad built on A, called an A minor triad, has pitches A–C–E:
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
{ \omit Score.TimeSignature \relative c&#x27; { &lt;a c e&gt;1 } }
&lt;/score&gt;

In harmonic analysis and on lead sheets, a C minor chord can be notated as Cm, C−, Cmin, or simply the lowercase &quot;c&quot;. A minor triad is represented by the integer notation {0, 3, 7}.

A minor triad can also be described by its intervals: the interval between the bottom and middle notes is a minor third, and the interval between the middle and top notes is a major third. By contrast, a major triad has a major third on the bottom and minor third on top. They both contain fifths, because a minor third (three semitones) plus a major third (four semitones) equals a perfect fifth (seven semitones). Chords that are constructed of consecutive (or &quot;stacked&quot;) thirds are called &quot;tertian.&quot;

In Western classical music from 1600 to 1820 and in Western pop, folk and rock music, a major chord is usually played as a triad. Along with the major triad, the minor triad is one of the basic building blocks of tonal music and the common practice period. In Western music, a minor chord, in comparison, &quot;sounds darker than a major chord&quot; but is still considered highly consonant, stable, or as not requiring resolution.

Some minor chords with additional notes, such as the minor seventh chord, may also be called minor chords.

== Acoustic consonance of the minor chord ==

A unique particularity of the minor chord is that this is the only chord of three notes in which the three notes have one harmonic – hearable and with a not too high row – in common (more or less exactly, depending on the tuning system used). This harmonic, common to the three notes, is situated 2 octaves above the high note of the chord. This is the sixth harmonic of the root of the chord, the fifth of the middle note, and the fourth of the high note:

:In the example C, E, G, the common harmonic is a G 2 octaves above.

Demonstration:
* Minor third = 6:5 = 12:10
* Major third = 5:4 = 15:12
* So the ratios of minor chord are 10:12:15
* And the explication of the unique harmonic in common, between the three notes, is verified by : 10 × 6 = 12 × 5 = 15 × 4

== Just intonation ==

In just intonation, a minor chord is often (but not exclusively) tuned in the frequency ratio 10:12:15 (). This is the first occurrence of a minor triad in the harmonic series (if on C: E–G–B). This may be found on iii, vi, vi, iii, and vii.

In 12-TET, or twelve-tone equal temperament (now the most common tuning system in the West), a minor chord has 3 semitones between the root and third, 4 between the third and fifth, and 7 between the root and fifth. It is represented by the integer notation 0,3,7. The 12-TET fifth (700 cents) is only two cents narrower than the just perfect fifth (3:2, 701.9 cents), but the 12-TET minor third (300 cents) is noticeably (about 16 cents) narrower than the just minor third (6:5, 315.6 cents). The 12-TET minor third (300 cents) more closely approximates the 19-limit (Limit (music)) minor third 16:19 (297.5 cents, the nineteenth harmonic) with only 2 cents error.

Ellis proposes that the conflict between mathematicians and physicists on one hand and practicing musicians on the other regarding the supposed inferiority of the minor chord and scale to the major may be explained due to physicists&#x27; comparison of just minor and major triads, in which case minor comes out the loser, versus the musicians&#x27; comparison of the equal tempered triads, in which case minor comes out the winner since the ET major third is 14 cents sharp from the just major third while the ET minor third closely approximates the consonant 19:16 minor third, which many find pleasing.

In the 16th through 18th centuries, prior to 12-TET, the minor third in meantone temperament was 310 cents and much rougher than the 300 cent ET minor third. Other just minor chord tunings include the supertonic triad in just intonation (27:32:40) the false minor triad, , 16:19:24 , 12:14:18 (6:7:9) (septimal minor third), and the Pythagorean minor triad (54:64:81) . More tunings of the minor chord are also available in various equal temperaments other than 12-TET.

Rather than directly from the harmonic series, Sorge derived the minor chord from joining two major triads; for example the A minor triad being the confluence of the F and C major triads. A–C–E = &quot;F&quot;–A–C–E–&quot;G&quot;. Given justly tuned major triads this produces a justly tuned minor triad: 10:12:15 on 8:5.

<text>The Merchandise Mart (or the Merch Mart, or the Mart) is a commercial building in downtown Chicago, Illinois. When it opened in 1930, it was the world&#x27;s largest building, with of floor space. The Art Deco structure is at the junction of the Chicago River&#x27;s branches. The building is a leading retailing and wholesale location, hosting 20,000 visitors and tenants daily in the late 2000s.

Built by Marshall Field &amp; Co. and later owned for over half a century by the Kennedy family, the Mart centralizes Chicago&#x27;s wholesale goods business by consolidating architectural and interior design vendors and trades under a single roof. It has become home to several other enterprises, including the Shops at the Mart, the Chicago campus of the Illinois Institute of Art, Motorola Mobility, the Grainger Technology Group branch of W.W. Grainger, and the Chicago tech startup center 1871. It was sold in January 1998 to Vornado Realty Trust.

The Merchandise Mart is so large that it had its own ZIP Code (60654) until 2008, when the Postal Service assigned the ZIP Code to part of the surrounding area. In 2010, the building opened its Design Center showrooms to the public.

==History==

===Construction and context===


In 1926, a westward extension of double-deck Wacker Drive increased development on the south riverbank. In 1927, Marshall Field &amp; Co. announced its plans to build on the north bank opposite Wacker Drive. The site, bordered by Orleans Street, Wells Street, Kinzie Street, and the Chicago River, was formerly a Native American trading post and the site of Chicago and North Western Railway&#x27;s former Wells Street Station, abandoned in 1911 in favor of the Chicago and North Western Passenger Terminal. With the railroad&#x27;s air rights, the site was large enough to accommodate &quot;the largest building in the world&quot;. Removing the train yard supported the Chicago Plan Commission&#x27;s desire to develop and beautify the riverfront.

James Simpson, president of Marshall Field &amp; Co. from 1923 to 1930 and chairman of the Chicago Plan Commission from 1926 to 1935, turned the first shovels of dirt at groundbreaking on August 16, 1928, along with architect Ernest Graham. General contractor John W. Griffiths &amp; Sons brought building construction into the Machine Age through the use of techniques &quot;ordinarily used in the construction of big dams.&quot;

Cement arriving by boat was lifted by compressed air to bins above the ground, with gravel and sand delivered by railroad cars to conveyor belts and transfer elevators. Giant mixers provided wet concrete to skip hoists in vertical towers that were extended as the building rose. Continuously employing 2,500 men and as many as 5,700 men altogether, the construction project lasted a year and a half into the early months of the Great Depression.

With a foundation footprint of nearly two square city blocks, the building required 29 million bricks, of plumbing, of wiring, nearly of concrete, of stone, and 4,000 windows. Bethlehem Steel fabricated much of the 60,000 tons of steel. An estimated of corridors and over 30 elevators were included in the construction. The total cost was estimated at $26 million.

===Ownership===
The Merchandise Mart opened on May 5, 1930, just east of Chicago&#x27;s original trading post, Wolf Point.

The building realized Marshall Field’s dream of a single wholesale center for the nation and consolidated 13 different warehouses. It was purchased in 1945 or 1946 by the Kennedy family through Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc. (MMPI), and managed by Sargent Shriver. Kennedy&#x27;s purchase price was reported to be either $12.5 or $13 million, and it is said that his initial capital was $1 million, though records say his original mortgage was $12.5 million, roughly half of what it had cost to construct the complex.

E. Stanley Klein, a good friend of Marshall Field and Joseph Kennedy, brokered the building&#x27;s sale. At the time Klein was a partner of Field and together they started Fieldcrest Mills. Klein maintained that Kennedy&#x27;s bargain price was predicated on an oral agreement between Field and Kennedy that after the sale the building would be donated to the University of Chicago and that Kennedy would take the tax deduction. No documentary evidence of this agreement exists.

The building revenues became a principal source of Kennedy family wealth, often used for political campaign funding.

In 1998 the Kennedys sold the property to Vornado Realty Trust as part of a larger $625 million ($ billion in current dollars) transaction. When it was sold, the Merchandise Mart was also the Kennedy family&#x27;s last remaining operating business. That year, Vornado acquired MMPI for $450 million cash and a $100 million-plus stake in Vornado. As of 2007, the building was valued at $917 million.

===Expansions and renovations===
The Merchandise Mart was modernized in the late 1950s and 1960s. In 1961 the Indian chiefs were removed and replaced with concrete plates, of minimal note to onlookers as skyscrapers did not rise on the north side of the river as predicted. In 2014, some of the carvings were found in a suburban backyard and auctioned. In 1962, an entrance canopy was constructed over the south for vehicle use.

In 1977, Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill designed the Chicago Apparel Center, on the west side of Orleans Street, which increased the Merchandise Mart’s total floor space to . Plazas, esplanades, and overlooks employed the waterfront location for pedestrian use. In 1988, Helmut Jahn designed an enclosed pedestrian walking bridge over Orleans Street connecting the Mart and the Apparel Center.

After a 10-year, $100 million modernization in the late 1980s that included public utility upgrades, Beyer Blinder Belle&#x27;s commission in 1989 was to create additional perimeter entrances and restore the display windows, main entrance, and lobby. On the south facade, the drive-through canopy was removed and two smaller doorways aside the main entrance added. Display windows, painted over during the earlier modernization campaign, were restored with clear glass to showcase merchants&#x27; wares.

New main and corner entrances were added to the rear facade, and the loading dock that occupied the north portion of the first floor of the river level was removed in order to use the bottom deck of North Bank Drive. Improvements to the lobby included restoration of the original glass curtain wall over the entrance, shop fronts, and reception desk using terrazzo floors and wall sconces influenced by the original design. The project was completed in 1991.

In 2007, the building received LEED for Existing Buildings Silver recognition.

==Building==

The Merchandise Mart was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst and White to be a &quot;city within a city&quot;. Second only to Holabird &amp; Root in Chicago art deco architecture, the firm had a long-standing relationship with the Field family. Started in 1928, completed in 1931, and built in the same art deco style as the Chicago Board of Trade Building, its cost was reported as both $32 million and $38 million. The building was the largest in the world in terms of floorspace, but was surpassed by the Pentagon in 1943, and now stands forty-fourth on the list of largest buildings in the world. Once the largest commercial space in the world, New Century Global Center in China is now recognized by Guinness World Records as holding the record.

===Architecture===
Designer Alfred Shaw integrated art deco stylings with influences from three building types—the warehouse, the department store and the skyscraper. A warehouse block stands as the 18-story bulk of the building. Ribbon piers define the windows, and the building&#x27;s chamfered corners, minimal setbacks, and corner pavilions disguise the edges of the mass and visually reduce bulk.

The south corner pavilions are of greater height than the north corner pavilions. The building is open at the pedestrian level with bronzed framed display windows, typical of a department store, on the south, west and east boundaries. The 25-story central tower ascends with a peak in the form of a skyscraper, and rests in the southern half of the building. Deeply recessed portals occur between raised panels, and are adorned with medallions featuring the interlocked initials of the Merchandise Mart. The same logo occurs throughout the building. Fifty-six American Indian chiefs circled the tower&#x27;s crown, a reference to the site&#x27;s history and Chicago&#x27;s early trade activities. Three and a half feet wide by seven feet tall, the terra cotta figures were barely visible from the street, meant to be viewed from the upper floors of the skyscrapers planned to rise along the riverbank.

The lobby of The Merchandise Mart is defined by eight square marble piers, with storefronts in side aisles framed in embossed bronze trim. The green and orange terrazzo floor was conceived as a carpet: a pattern of squares and stripes bordered by overscaled chevrons inlaid with The Mart&#x27;s initials. The chevron theme is continued in the column sconces lighting an ornamented cornice overhead.

Referred to as &quot;business boulevards&quot;, two wide long corridors with terrazzo floors in the upper levels featured six and one-half miles of display windows. Building regulations specified identical entrances along corridors but tenants could personalize the individual floor space. Excepting the corridors, elevator halls, and exhibition space on the fourth floor, the of each upper floor was &quot;raw space&quot; with concrete floors.

===Artwork===
Jules Guerin&#x27;s frieze of 17 murals is the primary feature of the lobby and graphically illustrate commerce throughout the world, including the countries of origin for items sold in the building. The murals depict the industries and products, the primary mode of transportation and the architecture of 14 countries. Drawing on years as a stage set designer, Guerin executed the murals in red with gold leaf using techniques producing distinct image layers in successive planes. In a panel representing Italy, Venetian glassware appears in the foreground with fishing boats moored on the Grand Canal and the facade of the Palazzo Ducale rises above the towers of the Piazza San Marco.

&quot;To immortalize outstanding American merchants&quot;, Joseph Kennedy in 1953 commissioned eight bronze busts, four times life size, which would come to be known as the Merchandise Mart Hall of Fame:
* retail magnates Frank Winfield Woolworth, Marshall Field and Aaron Montgomery Ward
* Julius Rosenwald and Robert Elkington Wood of Sears, Roebuck and Company fame
* advertiser John Wanamaker, merchandiser Edward Albert Filene, and A&amp;P grocery chain founder George Huntington Hartford.
All of the busts rest on white pedestals lining the Chicago River and face north toward the gold front door of the building.

====&quot;Art on theMART&quot;====
&quot;Art on theMART&quot; is a digital art display begun in 2018. It provides a 2.5 acre &quot;canvas&quot; (2 football fields) for digital artwork projected on the Chicago River facing facade of the Merchandise Mart. It featured works from the nonprofit organization Arts of Life. The project is intended to be the largest digital art projection in the world and is scheduled to occur over thirty years with annual showings initially between March and December. In 2019 it was expanded from five nights a week to every night. Displays begin 15 minutes after sunset and loop for two hours. Obscura Digital studio initially installed 34 projectors to allow the rotating roster of artists to display their work.

===Surroundings===
Dominating the skyline in the south end of the Near North Side, the Mart lies just south of the gallery district on the southern terminus of Franklin Street. Eateries and nightclubs abound on Hubbard Street one block to the north. The Kinzie Chophouse, popular with politicians and celebrities, stands on the northwest corner of Wells and Kinzie, across from the Merchandise Mart. The Chicago Varnish Company Building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places and now housing Harry Caray&#x27;s restaurant, is located east on Kinzie Street. Across the street to the east is 325 N. Wells Street, home to The Chicago School of Professional Psychology and DIRTT Environmental Solutions.

The Mart is not rectangular in shape, having been constructed after the bascule bridges over the Chicago River were completed. The control house for the double decked Wells Street Bridge stands between the lower level and the southeast corner of the building. The Franklin Street Bridge stands at the southwest corner of the building, at the junction of Orleans Street and Franklin Street. The building slants at the same angle as Franklin Street, from southeast to northwest along Orleans Street.

===Exterior lighting===
A heritage of lighting the structure finds the central and corner towers, along with the columns between each window on the setbacks, bathed nightly in an upwardly focused white light. Tradition dictates annual changes to green in mid-March for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day and orange during the fall months around Halloween and Thanksgiving. Prominent events have found the behemoth lit in pink for Cancer Awareness Month. To note the 2006 Chicago Bears season, highlighted by reaching Super Bowl XLI, the building was lit with team colors, orange floodlights for the setbacks and blue floodlights for the towers.

Red and green lights are used during the Christmas season. During the Art Chicago 2008 the American artist Jenny Holzer illuminated the facade of the building with a poem by the Polish winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature Wisława Szymborska. In 2018, a large projection screen began displaying images and videos across the structure&#x27;s riverfront side.

Nighttime lighting on the Mart typically matches the colors of antenna lighting on the Sears Tower and John Hancock Center, as well as the colors used on the top floors of the Aon Center.

===Green building practices===
Under Chris Kennedy&#x27;s leadership of the Mart, it was the largest building in the world to be awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certification in 2007 from the United States Green Building Council (USGBC). The Mart has long been implementing sustainable practices. The Mart Center began operating a thermal storage facility in 1986, capable of building of ice per night, cooling 71 buildings in the surrounding neighborhood, and saving $200,000 in electricity costs in the first year.

In 1990, the Mart Center began using Green Seal-approved green cleaning products and the next year implemented a recycling program, which today includes all forms of paper products, glass, light bulbs, batteries, aluminum and construction materials. In 1996, the Mart Center became one of the first major property owners in downtown Chicago to enter into an agreement with the district cooling system now known as Thermal Chicago, thus contributing to the national effort to reduce the discharge of ozone-damaging CFCs.

In 2006, MMPI joined Clean Air Counts, a voluntary initiative to reduce smog forming pollutants and energy consumption in the Chicago area. Part of the campaign strategies included utilizing only low VOC cleaning products, paints and building materials, as well as energy efficient lighting and alternative workplace transportation options. To date, the Mart Center has reduced pollution by , the largest reduction by a commercial building.

In 2006, the Mart Center recycling program saved over 13,000 trees and recycled nearly 11 million pounds of waste, while water conservation efforts saved of water. More than eight percent of the estimated 10,000 people working at the Mart walk, bike or take public transportation; to encourage greener methods of transportation, the Mart expanded bicycle storage capacity to more than 200. In 2009, MMPI converted all stationery to a one hundred percent post-consumer recycled product. 

The Mart has nine LEED-certified showrooms, with five others on their way to LEED certification.

==Uses==

===Commerce===

Wholesale showrooms occupied 50% of the usable floor space as of 2007. In 1983, the Sultan of Brunei once spent $1.6 million at the Mart to furnish his entire palace, claiming the location was the only place where the task could be completed in one week. Select showrooms are open only to wholesalers, with others accessible to the general public. Unlike stores with traditional shelf and rack displays, entire usable rooms are created, providing consumers an opportunity to compare form and function between applications and manufacturers.

A portion of the stores offer items for purchase singly or as a collection, while others offer design services, preservation, renovation, or installation. In addition to being a resource for architects and decorators, the Mart also has featured award-winning designs as selected by the American Institute of Architects. Catering to suppliers, on-site firms specialize in providing professional services for market research projects.

In 1931, Marshall Field and Company lost $5 million, followed by $8 million in 1932. The wholesale division was greatly reduced and Field&#x27;s reduced its space in the Mart from four floors to one and half. The Mart continued to display the latest trends in home furnishings within the showrooms and trade shows. The company recovered late in the decade, but did not return to all previously occupied space.

In 1942, L. L. Skaggs formed a partnership with three other men and named the partnership the Owners Service Company, hence Osco. The headquarters moved from Waterloo, Iowa, to the Merchandise Mart.

A retail shopping area, named The Shops at the Mart, opened in 1991 and includes apparel shops, beauty services, bookstores and newsstands, financial services, telecommunication services, travel services, specialty food and wine stores, photo services, a dry cleaner, shoe shine stand, and a food court. A U.S. Post Office is located on the first floor and a FedEx location is on the second floor.

The Apparel Center houses the 521-room Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza River North hotel, the offices of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and the Chicago campus of the Illinois Institute of Art – Chicago, as well as the Chicago office of the Ogilvy &amp; Mather advertising agency. GoHealth occupies on the 5th floor of Merchandise Mart, the Potbelly Sandwich Works&#x27; corporate offices are located in the tower. Motorola Mobility moved its headquarters to the Merchandise Mart in 2014.

===Trade fairs===
Since 1969, the Merchandise Mart has been home to the annual National Exposition of Contract Furnishings, known as NeoCon. With over 1,000 exhibitors of contract and commercial furnishings, and 50,000 attendees, it is the largest trade show of its kind in North America.

Since 2006 the Merchandise Mart has hosted the Art Chicago international art fair.

===Mass media===

====Radio====
Before the location even opened, NBC announced plans to build studios in the Mart. When opened on October 20, 1930, the nineteenth-floor location covered and supported a variety of live broadcasts including those requiring orchestras. WENR and WMAQ broadcast from the location. Expanded in 1935, with office space in the previously unoccupied tower, the additional provided room for an organ chamber, two echo rooms, and a total of 11 studios. A staff of more than 300 produced up to 1,700 programs each month, including &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;.

Hugh Downs contributed to the Burr Tillstrom children&#x27;s show &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; from the NBC studios after the network picked up the program from WBKB. The &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; radio program was broadcast from the Mart from 1942 until 1945.

WMAQ and WMAQ-TV moved to the NBC Tower in 1989, though NBC sold WMAQ radio to Westinghouse Broadcasting two years earlier). WMAQ&#x27;s former sister FM station, now WKQX, stayed at the Merchandise Mart until 2016, when it moved to NBC Tower itself.. The nineteenth floor is currently vacant.

====Television====
On January 7, 1949, NBC station WNBQ commercially debuted its television broadcast schedule on channel 5, with a minimum of two hours of programming per day. April 15, 1956, is remembered as &quot;C-Day&quot; at WMAQ-TV, and was described by Broadcasting-Telecasting magazine as &quot;a daring breakthrough the black-and-white curtain.&quot; With Mayor Richard J. Daley looking on, NBC President David Sarnoff operated the controls as Channel 5 became the world&#x27;s first all-color TV station as &quot;Wide, Wide World&quot; was broadcast to 110 NBC-TV affiliated stations across the country. The color conversion project cost more than $1.25 million with advertising costing $175,000. On &quot;C-Day&quot;, three skywriting planes flew over the city, trailing streams of red, green and blue smoke.

WMAQ-TV first installed color equipment in late 1953, with the Tournament of Roses Parade of 1954 as the first major broadcast. Introduced in March 1955, the first local color program was John Ott&#x27;s &quot;How Does Your Garden Grow?&quot;, featuring the use of time-lapse color film.

Although WMAQ-TV has since moved to NBC Tower about a mile away, and for the most part the 19th floor of the Mart has been turned into office space, one former tenant (Bankers Life and Trust Company) maintained a remnant of the original studios as their video and multimedia department.

Local regional sports network NBC Sports Chicago has their control room, and broadcasts their live studio programming from the Apparel Center expansion; the studios had been home to previous RSNs FSN Chicago and SportsChannel Chicago.

==Chicago &#x27;L&#x27;==

Built in under four months and opened on December 5, 1930, the Merchandise Mart elevated train station served the Main Line of the North Side Division. The station is now noted for being one of two commercial locations to have its own station on the Chicago Transit Authority&#x27;s (CTA) &#x27;L&#x27; system. The station is now served by the Brown and Purple Lines.

The station complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The turnstiles are located within the building on the second floor, while the platforms are connected to the east side of the building. The northbound platform is accessed by an overhead bridge or elevator. It was rebuilt in 1988, prior to the Wells Street Bridge reconstruction in 1989.

The Merchandise Mart housed the CTA&#x27;s headquarters on the 7th floor from 1947 to 2004.

==Cultural involvement==

* Owing to the expanding postwar economy and family, the owners began offering tours in 1948. Architecture and design interest groups continue to offer scheduled tours.
* The Mart hosts the annual Art Chicago activities.
* Chicago Marathon routes have taken runners past the structure, typically on Wells Street.

===In popular culture===
* The 1948 film &quot;Call Northside 777&quot; was made in Illinois and the Mart is seen from newspaper offices on Wacker Drive.
* The lobby appeared in the movie &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; as the interior of the Hudsucker Company headquarters.
* In 1956, the eight-minute short subject film &quot;The Merchandise Mart&quot; used the Mart&#x27;s name and covered in detail the building&#x27;s interior and operations.
* When his late-night NBC talk show was performed in Chicago during the first week of May 1989, David Letterman called the Merchandise Mart Hall of Fame &quot;the Pez Hall of Fame&quot; because the combination of busts atop the tall vertical pedestals resembled the candy&#x27;s dispensers.
* In the 1993 film &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, U.S. Marshals pinpoint the location of Dr. Richard Kimble when they hear a CTA train conductor announce, &quot;Next stop, Merchandise Mart&quot; in the background of a recorded phone call.
* In the 2012 novel &quot;Insurgent&quot; by Veronica Roth, the Mart was depicted as the headquarters of the Candor faction, where it is named the ‘Merciless Mart’ due to Candor’s proclivity for interrogation.

<text>Rhabdoviridae is a family of negative-strand RNA viruses in the order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot;. Vertebrates (including mammals and humans), invertebrates, plants, fungi and protozoans serve as natural hosts. Diseases associated with member viruses include rabies encephalitis caused by the rabies virus, and flu-like symptoms in humans caused by vesiculoviruses. The name is derived from Ancient Greek , meaning rod, referring to the shape of the viral particles. The family has 40 genera, most assigned to three subfamilies.

== Structure ==

The individual virus particles (virions) of rhabdoviruses are composed of RNA, protein, carbohydrate and lipid. They have complex bacilliform or bullet-like shapes. All these viruses have structural similarities and have been classified as a single family.

The virions are about 75 nm wide and 180 nm long. Rhabdoviruses are enveloped and have helical nucleocapsids and their genomes are linear, around 11–15 kb in length. Rhabdoviruses carry their genetic material in the form of negative-sense single-stranded RNA. They typically carry genes for five proteins: large protein (L), glycoprotein (G), nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), and matrix protein (M). The sequence of these protein genes from the 3 &#x27;end to the 5&#x27; end in the genome is N–P–M–G–L. Every rhabdoviruses encode these five proteins in their genomes. In addition to these proteins, many rhabdoviruses encode one or more proteins. The first four genes encode major structural proteins that participate in the structure of the virion envelope.

The matrix protein (M) constitutes a layer between the virion envelope and the nucleocapsid core of the rhabdovirus. In addition to the functions about virus assembly, morphogenesis and budding off enveloped from the host plasma membrane, additional functions such as the regulation of RNA synthesis, affecting the balance of replication and transcription products was found, making reverse genetics experiments with rabies virus, a member of the family Rhabdoviridae. The large (L) protein has several enzymatic functions in viral RNA synthesis and processing. The L gene encodes this L protein, which contains multiple domains. In addition to RNA synthesis, it is thought to be involved in methyl capping and polyadenylation activity.

P protein plays important and multiple roles during  transcription and replication of the RNA genome. The multifunctional P protein is encoded by the P gene. P protein acts as a non-catalytic cofactor of large protein polymerase. It is binding to N and L protein. P protein has two independent binding regions. By forming N-P complexes, it can keep the N protein in the form suitable for specific encapsulation. P protein interferes with the host&#x27;s innate immune system through inhibition of the activities of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)  and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), thus eliminating the cellular type 1 interferon pathway. Also, P protein acts as an antagonist against antiviral PML function.

Rhabdoviruses that infect vertebrates (especially mammals and fishes), plants, and insects are usually bullet-shaped. However, in contrast to paramyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses do not have hemagglutinating and neuraminidase activities.

==Transcription==

Transcriptase of rhabdovirus is composed of 1 L and 3 P proteins. Transcriptase components are always present in the complete virion to permit rhabdoviruses to begin transcription immediately after entry.

The rhabdovirus transcriptase proceeds in a 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; direction on the genome and the transcription terminates randomly at the end of protein sequences. For example, if a transcription finishes at the end of M sequence; leader RNA and N, P and M mRNAs are formed separately from each other.

Also, mRNAs accumulate according to the order of protein sequences on the genome, solving the logistics problem in the cell. For example, N protein is necessary in high quantities for the virus, as it coats the outside of the replicated genomes completely. Since the N protein sequence is located at the beginning of the genome (3&#x27; end) after the leader RNA sequence, mRNAs for N protein can always be produced and accumulate in high amounts with every termination of transcription. After the transcription processes, all of the mRNAs are capped at the 5&#x27; end and polyadenylated at the 3&#x27; end by L protein.

This transcription mechanism thus provides mRNAs according to the need of the viruses.

==Translation==
The virus proteins translated on free ribosomes but G protein is translated by the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This means G protein has a signal peptide on its mRNA&#x27;s starting codes. Phosphoproteins (P) and glycoprotein (G) undergo post-translational modification. Trimers of P protein are formed after phosphorylation by kinase activity of L protein. The G protein is glycosylated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex.

==Replication==

Viral replication is cytoplasmic. The replication cycle is the same for most rhabdoviruses. All components required for early transcription and the nucleocapsid are released to the cytoplasm of the infected cell after the first steps of binding, penetration and uncoating take place. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral G glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Replication follows the negative stranded RNA virus replication model. Negative stranded RNA virus transcription, using polymerase stuttering is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by budding, and tubule-guided viral movement. Transmission routes are zoonosis and bite.

Replication of many rhabdoviruses occurs in the cytoplasm, although several of the plant infecting viruses replicate in the nucleus. The rhabdovirus matrix (M) protein is very small (~20–25 kDa) however plays a number of important roles during the replication cycle of the virus. These proteins of rhabdoviruses constitute major structural components of the virus and they are multifunctional proteins and required for virus maturation and viral budding process that also regulate the balance of virus RNA synthesis by shifting synthesis from transcription to replication. In order for replication, both the L and P protein must be expressed to regulate transcription. Phosphoprotein (P) also plays a crucial role during replication, as N-P complexes, rather than N alone, are necessary for appropriate and selective encapsidation of viral RNA. Therefore, replication is not possible after infection until the primary transcription and translation produce enough N protein.
The L protein has a lot of enzymatic activity such as RNA replication, capping mRNAs phosphorylation of P. L protein gives feature in about replication in cytoplasm. Transcription results in five monocistronic mRNAs being produced because the intergenic sequences act as both termination and promoter sequences for adjacent genes. This type of transcription mechanism is explained by stop-start model (stuttering transcription). Owing to stop-start model, the large amounts of the structural proteins are produced. According to this model, the virus-associated RNA polymerase starts firstly the synthesis of leader RNA and then the five mRNA which will produce N, P, M, G, L proteins, respectively. After the leader RNA was produced, the polymerase enzyme reinitiates virion transcription on N gene and proceeds its synthesis until it ends 3′ end of the chain. Then, the synthesis of P mRNAs are made by same enzyme with new starter sinyal. These steps continue until the enzyme arrives the end of the L gene. During transcription process, the polymerase enzyme may leave the template at any point and then bound just at the 3′ end of the genome RNA to start mRNA synthesis again. This process will results concentration gradient of the amount of mRNA based on its place and its range from the 3′ end. In the circumstances, the amounts of mRNA species change and will be produced N&gt;P&gt;M&gt;G&gt;L proteins. During their synthesis the mRNAs are processed to introduce a 5&#x27; cap and a 3’ polyadenylated tail to each of the molecules. This structure is homologous to cellular mRNAs and can thus be translated by cellular ribosomes to produce both structural and non-structural proteins.

Genomic replication requires a source of newly synthesized N protein to encapsidate the RNA. This occurs during its synthesis and results in the production of a full-length anti-genomic copy. This in turn is used to produce more negative-sense genomic RNA. The viral polymerase is required for this process, but how the polymerase engages in both mRNA synthesis and genomic replication is not well understood.

Replication characteristically occurs in an inclusion body within the cytoplasm, from where they bud through various cytoplasmic membranes and the outer membrane of the cell. This process results in the acquisition of the M + G proteins, responsible for the characteristic bullet- shaped morphology of the virus.

== Classification ==

===Clades===
These viruses fall into four groups based on the RNA polymerase gene. The basal clade appears to be novirhabdoviruses, which infect fish. Cytorhabdoviruses and the nucleorhabdoviruses, which infect plants, are sister clades. Lyssaviruses form a clade of their own which is more closely related to the land vertebrate and insect clades than to the plant viruses. The remaining viruses form a number of highly branched clades and infect arthropods and land vertebrates.

A 2015 analysis of 99 species of animal rhabdoviruses found that they fell into 17 taxonomic groupings, eight – &quot;Lyssavirus&quot;, &quot;Vesiculovirus&quot;, &quot;Perhabdovirus&quot;, &quot;Sigmavirus&quot;, &quot;Ephemerovirus&quot;, &quot;Tibrovirus&quot;, &quot;Tupavirus&quot; and &quot;Sprivivirus&quot; – which were previously recognized. The authors proposed seven new taxa on the basis of their findings: &quot;Almendravirus&quot;, &quot;Bahiavirus&quot;, &quot;Curiovirus&quot;, &quot;Hapavirus&quot;, &quot;Ledantevirus&quot;, &quot;Sawgravirus&quot; and &quot;Sripuvirus&quot;. Seven species did not group with the others suggesting the need for additional taxa.

===Proposed classifications===
An unofficial supergroup – &quot;Dimarhabdovirus&quot; – refers to the genera &quot;Ephemerovirus&quot; and &quot;Vesiculovirus&quot;. A number of other viruses that have not been classified into genera also belong to this taxon. This supergroup contains the genera with species that replicate in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts and have biological cycles that involve transmission by haematophagous dipterans (bloodsucking flies).

=== Prototypical rhabdoviruses ===
The prototypical and best studied rhabdovirus is vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus. It is a preferred model system to study the biology of rhabdoviruses, and mononegaviruses in general. The mammalian disease rabies is caused by lyssaviruses, of which several have been identified.

Rhabdoviruses are important pathogens of animals and plants. Rhabdoviruses are transmitted to hosts by arthropods, such as aphids, planthoppers, leafhoppers, black flies, sandflies, and mosquitoes.

In September 2012, researchers writing in the journal &quot;PLOS Pathogens&quot; described a novel species of rhabdovirus, called Bas-Congo virus (BASV), which was discovered in a blood sample from a patient who survived an illness that resembled hemorrhagic fever. No cases of BASV have been reported since its discovery and it is uncertain if BASV was the actual cause of the patient&#x27;s illness.

In 2015 two novel rhabdoviruses, Ekpoma virus 1 and Ekpoma virus 2, were discovered in samples of blood from two healthy women in southwestern Nigeria. Ekpoma virus 1 and Ekpoma virus 2 appear to replicate well in humans (viral load ranged from ~45,000 - ~4.5 million RNA copies/mL plasma) but did not cause any observable symptoms of disease. Exposure to Ekpoma virus 2 appears to be widespread in certain parts of Nigeria where seroprevalence rates are close to 50%.

<text>Mononegavirales is an order of negative-strand RNA viruses which have nonsegmented genomes. Some members that cause human disease in this order include Ebola virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, measles virus, mumps virus, Nipah virus, and rabies virus. Important pathogens of nonhuman animals and plants are also in the group. The order includes eleven virus families: &quot;Artoviridae&quot;, &quot;Bornaviridae&quot;, &quot;Filoviridae&quot;, &quot;Lispiviridae&quot;, &quot;Mymonaviridae&quot;, &quot;Nyamiviridae&quot;, &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot;, &quot;Pneumoviridae&quot;, &quot;Rhabdoviridae&quot;, &quot;Sunviridae&quot;, and &quot;Xinmoviridae&quot;.

==Use of term==
The order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot; (pronounced: ) is a virological taxon that was created in 1991 and amended in 1995, 1997, 2000, 2005, 2011, 2016, 2017, and 2018. The name &quot;Mononegavirales&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek adjective &quot;μóνος&quot; &quot;monos&quot; (alluding to the monopartite and single-stranded genomes of most mononegaviruses), the Latin verb &quot;negare&quot; (alluding to the negative polarity of these genomes), and the taxonomic suffix &quot;-virales&quot; (denoting a viral order).

==Order inclusion criteria==

A virus is a member of the order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot; if
* its genome is a linear, typically (but not always) nonsegmented, single-stranded, non-infectious RNA of negative polarity; possesses inverse-complementary 3&#x27; and 5&#x27; termini; and is not covalently linked to a protein;
* its genome has the characteristic gene order 3&#x27;-UTR–core protein genes–envelope protein genes–RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene–5&#x27;-UTR (3&#x27;-N-P-M-G-L-5&#x27;) (there are, however, some exceptions);
* it produces 5–10 distinct mRNAs from its genome via polar sequential transcription from a single promoter located at the 3&#x27; end of the genome; mRNAs are 5&#x27; capped and polyadenylated;
* it replicates by synthesizing complete antigenomes;
* it forms infectious helical ribonucleocapsids as the templates for the synthesis of mRNAs, antigenomes, and genomes;
* it encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, L) that is highly homologous to those of other mononegaviruses; and/or
* it typically (but not always) produces enveloped virions with a molecular mass of 300–1,000; an S20W of 550–&gt;1,045; and a buoyant density in CsCl of 1.18–1.22 g/cm3.

==Life cycle==

The mononegavirus life cycle begins with virion attachment to specific cell-surface receptors, followed by fusion of the virion envelope with cellular membranes and the concomitant release of the virus nucleocapsid into the cytosol. The virus RdRp partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-stranded mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins.

Mononegavirus RdRps bind to a single promoter located at the 3&#x27; end of the genome. Transcription either terminates after a gene or continues to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3&#x27; end of the genome are transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5&#x27; end are least likely to be transcribed. The gene order is therefore a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the cell determines when the RdRp switches from gene transcription to genome replication.

Replication results in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that are in turn transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane they bud from. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle.

==Paleovirology==

Mononegaviruses have a history that dates back several tens of million of years. Mononegavirus &quot;fossils&quot; have been discovered in the form of mononegavirus genes or gene fragments integrated into mammalian genomes. For instance, bornavirus gene &quot;fossils&quot; have been detected in the genomes of bats, fish, hyraxes, marsupials, primates, rodents, ruminants, and elephants. Filovirus gene &quot;fossils&quot; have been detected in the genomes of bats, rodents, shrews, tenrecs, and marsupials. A Midway virus &quot;fossil&quot; was found in the genome of zebrafish. Finally, rhabdovirus &quot;fossils&quot; were found in the genomes of crustaceans, mosquitoes, ticks, and plants.

==Taxonomy==
The order has eleven families that include numerous genera, which consist of many different species:
* &quot;Artoviridae&quot;
* &quot;Bornaviridae&quot;
* &quot;Filoviridae&quot;
* &quot;Lispiviridae&quot;
* &quot;Mymonaviridae&quot;
* &quot;Nyamiviridae&quot;
* &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot;
* &quot;Pneumoviridae&quot;
* &quot;Rhabdoviridae&quot;
* &quot;Sunviridae&quot;
* &quot;Xinmoviridae&quot;

<text>A real estate investment trust (REIT, pronounced &quot;reet&quot;) is a company that owns, and in most cases operates, income-producing real estate. REITs own many types of commercial real estate, including office and apartment buildings, studios, warehouses, hospitals, shopping centers, hotels and commercial forests. Some REITs engage in financing real estate. REITs act as a bridge between the worlds of housing and urban development on one hand, and institutional investors and financial markets on the other. They are typically categorized into commercial REITs (C-REITs) and residential REITs (R-REITs), with the latter focusing on housing assets such as apartments and single-family homes.

Most countries&#x27; laws on REITs entitle a real estate company to pay less in corporation tax and capital gains tax. REITs have been criticised as enabling speculation on housing, and reducing housing affordability, without increasing finance for building.

REITs can be publicly traded on major exchanges, publicly registered but non-listed, or private. The two main types of REITs are equity REITs and mortgage REITs (mREITs). In November 2014, equity REITs were recognized as a distinct asset class in the Global Industry Classification Standard by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI. The key statistics to examine the financial position and operation of a REIT include net asset value (NAV), funds from operations (FFO), and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO).

== History ==

===Creation===
REITs were created in the United States after President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed Public Law 86-779, sometimes called the Cigar Excise Tax Extension of 1960. The law was enacted to allow all investors to invest in large-scale, diversified portfolios of income-producing real estate in the same way they typically invest in other asset classes – through the purchase and sale of liquid securities. The first REIT was American Realty Trust founded by Thomas J. Broyhill, cousin of Virginia U.S. Congressman Joel Broyhill in 1961 who pushed for the creation under Eisenhower.

As of 2021, at least 39 countries around the world have established REITs. A comprehensive index for the REIT and the global listed property market is the FTSE EPRA/Nareit Global Real Estate Index Series, which was created jointly in October 2001 by the index provider FTSE Group, Nareit and the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA). As of 29 January 2021, the global index included 490 stock exchange listed real estate companies from 39 countries representing an equity market capitalization of about $1.7 trillion.

===Evolution===
Around the time of their creation in 1960, the first REITs primarily consisted of mortgage companies. The industry experienced significant expansion in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The growth primarily resulted from the increased use of mREITs in land development and construction deals. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 authorized REITs to be established as corporations in addition to business trusts.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 also impacted REITs. The legislation included new rules designed to prevent taxpayers from using partnerships to shelter their earnings from other sources. Three years later, REITs witnessed significant losses in the stock market.

Retail REIT Taubman Centers Inc. launched the modern era of REITs in 1992 with its creation of the UPREIT. In an UPREIT, the parties of an existing partnership and a REIT become partners in a new &quot;operating partnership&quot;. The REIT typically is the general partner and the majority owner of the operating partnership units, and the partners who contributed properties have the right to exchange their operating partnership units for REIT shares or cash. The industry struggled during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, after which listed REITs responded by deleveraging (paying off debt) and re-equitizing (selling stock to get cash) their balance sheets. Listed REITs and REOCs raised $37.5 billion in 91 secondary equity offerings, nine IPOs and 37 unsecured debt offerings as investors continued to act favorably to companies strengthening their balance sheets following the credit crisis.

REIT dividends have a 100 percent payout ratio for all income at lower rates. This inhibits the internal growth of the REIT and causes investors to not tolerate low or non-existent yields as the interest rates are more sensitive. Economic climates characterized by rising interest rates can cause a net negative effect on REIT shares. The dividends paid by REITs look less attractive when compared to bonds that have
increasing coupon rates. Also, when investors shy away from REITs, it makes it
difficult for management to raise additional funds to acquire more property.

=== Kenya ===
The first REIT in Kenya was approved by the Capital Markets Authority in October 2015. The REIT is issued by Stanlib Kenya under the name Fahari I-Reit scheme. 
The REIT scheme will provide unit holders stable cash inflows from the income generating real estate properties.
The unrestricted IPO will be listed on the main investment market segment of the Nairobi Securities Exchange.

=== Ghana ===
REITs have been in existence in Ghana since 1994. The Home Finance Company, now HFC Bank, established the first REIT in Ghana in August 1994. HFC Bank has been at the forefront of mortgage financing in Ghana since 1993. It has used various collective investment schemes as well as corporate bonds to finance its mortgage lending activities. Collective Investment Schemes, of which REITs are a part, are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Ghana.

=== Nigeria ===
In 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued the first set of guidelines for the registration and issuance of requirements for the operation of REITs in Nigeria as detailed in the Investment and Securities Act (ISA). The first REIT, the N50 billion Union Homes Hybrid Real Estate Investment Trust, was launched in September 2008. In November 2015 there were three listed REITS on the Nigerian Stock Exchange: Skye Shelter Fund, Union Home and UPDC. A Haldane McCall REIT did not list after failing to reach the minimum 50% subscription in a January 2015 initial public offer amid poor market prospects.

=== South Africa ===
By October 2015 there were 33 South African REITS and three non-South African REITs listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, according to the SA REIT Association, which said market capitalization was more than R455 billion.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Commonly referred to as Real Estate Investment Fund, the regulations were launched in July 2006 by the Saudi Capital Market Authority, The regulation did not allow the funds to be traded in the stock market and forced all funds to be structured by a licensed Investment companies by CMA with a presence of a real estate developer and some other key persons.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
The REIT legislation was introduced by Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) to promote the
development of REIT&#x27;s in the UAE by passing The Investment Trust Law No.5 that went into effect
on August 6, 2006. This restricts all &#x27;true&#x27; REIT structures to be domiciled within the DIFC. The first REIT license to be issued will be backed by Dubai Islamic Bank with a REIT named &#x27;Emirates REIT&#x27; headed up by the dot com entrepreneur, Sylvain Vieujot.

The issue is that DIFC domiciled REITs cannot acquire non-Freezone assets within the Emirate of Dubai. The only federally approved Freezone within the UAE is the DIFC itself so therefore any properties outside this zone are purchasable by local Gulf (GCC) passport holders only. However, through a collaboration with local authorities, Emirates REIT has been able to establish a platform enabling it to purchase properties anywhere in Dubai given a minimum of 51% of local ownership of its shares. This allows the company to diversify its portfolio with an efficient revenue generating mix of properties in the prime locations of Dubai. Emirates REIT is the first REIT established within the United Arab Emirates. It is also the first REIT listed on NASDAQ Dubai and one of the five Shari&#x27;a compliant REIT in the world with a focus on Income-producing assets.

Emirates REIT has a portfolio of over US$575.3 million consisting of a total of seven properties primarily focused on commercial and office space as of December 2014. It has had substantial growth over the last four years.

===Australia===

The REIT concept was launched in Australia in 1971. General Property Trust was the first Australian real estate investment trust (LPT) on the Australian stock exchanges (now the Australian Securities Exchange). REITs which are listed on an exchange were known as Listed Property Trusts (LPTs) until March 2008, distinguishing them from private REITs which are known in Australia as Unlisted Property Trusts. They have since been renamed Australian Real Estate Investment Trusts (A-REITs) in line with international practice.

REITs have shown numerous benefits over direct investment including lower tax rates and increased liquidity. There are now more than 70 A-REITs listed on the ASX, with market capitalization in excess of A$100bn.

Australia is also receiving growing recognition as having the world&#x27;s largest REITs market outside the United States. More than 12 percent of global listed property trusts can be found on the ASX.

=== Hong Kong ===
REITs have been in existence in Hong Kong since 2005, when The Link REIT was launched by the Hong Kong Housing Authority on behalf of the Hong Kong Government. Since 2005, there have been seven REIT listings as at July 2007, most of which, including Sunlight REIT have not enjoyed success because of low yield. Except for The Link and Regal Real Estate Investment Trust, share prices of all but one are significantly below the initial public offering (IPO) price. Hong Kong issuers&#x27; use of financial engineering (interest rate swaps) to improve initial yields has also been cited as having reduced investors&#x27; interest

As of July 2012 there are nine REITs listed with a total market capitalisation of approximately €15 billion which amounts to almost 2% of the total global REIT market capitalisation. Two out of the nine listed REITs are also included in the EPRA index, an index published by the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA). The current top five REITs in Hong Kong are The Link REIT with a total market capitalisation of €8 billion, Hui Xian REIT with a total market capitalisation of €2.3 billion, Champion REIT with a total market capitalisation of €1.8 billion, Fortune REIT with a total market capitalisation of €1 billion and with a total market capitalisation of €700 million.

=== India ===

As of August 2014, India approved creation of real estate investment trusts in the country. Indian REITs (country specific/generic version I-REITs) will help individual investors enjoy the benefits of owning an interest in the securitised real estate market. The greatest benefit will be that of fast and easy liquidation of investments in the real estate market unlike the traditional way of disposing of real estate. The government and Securities and Exchange Board of India through various notifications is in the process of making it easier to invest in real estate in India directly and indirectly through foreign direct investment, through listed real estate companies and mutual funds. In the budget of 2014, finance minister Arun Jaitley has introduced a law for setting up of REITs.
As in 2021, there are three REITs listed in National Stock Exchange of India. These are Embassy, Mindspace and Brookfields. Overall, the shareholding of Indian REITs is skewed towards institutional investors (mostly FPIs), with very minimal contribution from retail investors.

===China===

CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) and NDRC (National Development and Reform Commission) jointly announced the start of pilot projects in REITs on April 30, 2020. This official announcement represents the beginning of REITs in mainland China.

As of March 14, 2024, the landscape of China&#x27;s Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) saw a significant advancement with the listing of Huaxia Jinmao Commercial REITs (508017) and Jiashi Wumei Consumer REITs (508011) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on March 12, followed by Huaxia China Resources Commercial REITs (180601) on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on March 14.

According to statistics from the Shanghai Stock Exchange, listing these two consumer infrastructure REITs has increased the total number of listed REITs to 23, with an issuance scale approaching 80 billion yuan. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange has reported that the funds raised by infrastructure REITs successfully listed on their exchange have surpassed 32 billion yuan. These projects encompass various asset types, including industrial parks, toll roads, storage logistics, ecological protection, clean energy, affordable rental housing, and consumer infrastructure. The products have been operating smoothly, with active investor participation, gradually enhancing market functions, thereby creating significant scale and demonstration effects.

=== Japan ===
Japan permitted the establishment of REITs in December 2001. J-REIT securities are traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange among other exchanges in Japan.

A J-REIT (a listed real estate investment trust) is strictly regulated under the Law concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Companies (LITIC) and established as an investment company under the LITIC.

In addition to REITs, Japanese law also provides for a parallel system of special purpose companies which can be used for the securitization of particular properties on the private placement basis. REIT shares targeted in 2016 accounted for 7 percent of the United States market, which were subsequently sold for less than half of the initial value at $31 billion.

=== Malaysia ===
The Bursa Malaysia has 18 REIT listed with five Islamic REITS (shariah compliant – according to Islamic investment compliance).

=== Indonesia ===
Dana Investasi Real Estat Berbentuk Kontrak Investasi Kolektif (DIREs) have lacked popularity because of high sale tax and double taxation. Until 2016, only one DIRE was established, which was in 2012. However, tax incentives plans demonstrate an intention of policymakers and lawmakers to boost the competitiveness of the market, and to encourage DIREs to be listed domestically.

=== Pakistan ===
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan is in the process of implementing a REIT regulatory framework that will allow full foreign ownership, free movement of capital and unrestricted repatriation of profits. It will curb speculation in Pakistani real estate markets and gives access to small investors who want to diversify into real estate. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan is proposing a regulatory framework similar to that of Singapore and Hong Kong.

The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan expected that about six REITs would be licensed within the first year, mainly large asset management companies. Pakistan has seen an outflow of investments by foreign real estate development companies, mostly based in Malaysia and Dubai.

SECP has issued licenses to four parties namely, Arif Habib REIT Management Company, AKD REIT Management Company, Eden Developers REIT Management Company and SB Global REIT Management Company.

=== Philippines ===
The legal framework enabling the establishment of REITs in the Philippines have been in place after the Real Estate Investment Trust Act of 2009 (Republic Act No. 9856) passed into law on December 17, 2009. Its Implementing Rules and Regulations were approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission in May 2010. However, it failed to attract investors due to its restrictive tax policies and high friction cost.

Regulations on REITs was relaxed in January 2020 which led to the establishment of the first REIT in the country, AREIT Inc. of Ayala Land which had its public offering in August of the same year. However foreign investors still have poor reception towards REITs during that year when there was also a prevailing COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Singapore ===
Commonly referred to as S-REITs, there are more than 40 REITs listed on the Singapore Exchange, with the latest REIT, Cromwell European REIT, listed on 30 November 2017. The first one to be set up being CapitaMall Trust in July 2002. They represent a range of property sectors including retail, office, industrial, hospitality and residential. S-REITs hold a variety of properties in countries including Japan, China, Indonesia and Hong Kong, in addition to local properties. In recent years, foreign assets listing on the Singapore Exchange has grown to overtake those traditional listing with local assets.

S-REITs are regulated as Collective Investment Schemes under the Monetary Authority of Singapore&#x27;s Code on Collective Investment Schemes, or alternatively as Business Trusts.

Some of the regulations that S-REITs have to adhere to includes:

* Maximum gearing ratio of 35%
* Annual valuation of its properties
* Restriction to certain types of investments the S-REITs can make
* Distribution of at least 90% of its taxable income

S-REITs benefit from tax advantaged status where the tax is payable only at the investor level and not at the REITs level. In addition to REITs, there are ten Business Trusts (&quot;BTs&quot;) (similar to REITs but may hold assets that are not conventional and are not subjected to stringent rules as compared to SREITs), and six Stapled Instruments (composed of a stapled Business Trust Unit and a REIT unit), which are listed on the Singapore Exchange. The total market capitalisation of the listed Trust on Singapore Exchange approximate SGD 100 billion (as at 30 Nov 17).

===Thailand===
The Securities and Exchange Commission created regulations to establish REITs as an investment vehicle in late 2012, opening the doors for the first REITs to be listed in 2013. There are at least two tens of REITS. Introduced in 2014 to replace the Property Funds for Public Offering (PFPO) scheme, REITs have gained popularity, and the total market capitalisation has reached THB 85 billion across two million square metres of assets.

=== Sri Lanka ===
On 1 August 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) announced that REITS will be introduced as an extension of the current Unit Trust Code and the new Rules, which came into effect from 31 July 2020 is in the form of a Gazette Notification published by the SEC. These Rules which are comprehensive, will govern the setting up of and the conduct of a Sri Lankan REITs. Specific provisions have been included for the verification of title and valuation of property that will form part of the assets of the REIT. Amongst the requirements is the mandatory distribution of approximately 90% of income to the unit holders, which is currently not a requirement for any of the listed entities. Further, due to the availability of the tax pass through mechanism to Unit Trusts, REITs also could benefit to be a viable business concept to Sri Lanka that will open new horizons for entrepreneurs to take the real estate industry to greater heights.

==Europe==

=== Belgium ===

Bernheim Comofi (now AG Real Estate) introduced Belgian REITs in 1995 with the constitution of Befimmo. Others REITs in Belgium include Cofinimmo and Ascensio.

=== Bulgaria ===
REITs were introduced in Bulgaria in 2004 with the Special Purpose Investment Companies Act. They are pass-through entities for corporate income tax purposes (i.e., they are not subject to corporate income-tax), but are subject to numerous restrictions.

=== Finland ===
Finnish REITs were established in 2010, when the Finnish parliament passed &quot;the tax exemption law&quot; (Laki eräiden asuntojen vuokraustoimintaa harjoittavien osakeyhtiöiden verohuojennuksesta, 299/2009). Together with the &quot;Law on Real Estate Funds&quot; (Kiinteistörahastolaki, 1173–1997) it enables the existence of tax-efficient residential REITs.

&quot;Qualifications&quot;
* REITs have to be established as public listed companies (julkinen osakeyhtiö, Oyj) for this specific purpose. When the REIT is established the minimum equity is 5M€ and it has to be distributed over five separate investors.
* Minimum holding period: five years.
* At least 80% of its assets have to be invested in residential real-estate.
* At least 80% of the REIT&#x27;s gross revenues must come from residential rental income.
* At least 90% of the REIT&#x27;s taxable income, excluding unrealised capital gains, has to be distributed to its shareholders through dividends.
* The corporation is income-tax-exempt, but the shareholders will have to pay individual income tax on the dividends.
* The largest individual shareholder may own less than 10% of company shares (maximum 30% till the end of 2013).

 Orava Residential REIT is the only REIT in Finland.

=== France ===
The French acronyms for REIT are &quot;SIIC&quot; (publicly listed), contrary to &quot;SCPI&quot; and &quot;OCPI&quot; (which are two other kinds of real-estate trusts not publicly listed). In France, Unibail-Rodamco is the largest SIIC. Gecina is the second-largest publicly traded property company in France, with the third-highest asset value among European REITs.

=== Germany ===
Germany planned to introduce REITs in order to create a new type of real estate investment vehicle. The Government feared that failing to introduce REITs in Germany would result in a significant loss of investment capital to other countries. Nonetheless, there still is political resistance to these plans, especially from the Social Democratic Party.

In June 2006 the ministry of finance announced that they planned to introduce REITs in 2007. The legal details seem to adopt much of the British REIT regulation.

A law concerning REITs was enacted 1 June 2007, effective retroactively to 1 January 2007:

* REITs have to be established as corporations—&quot;REIT-AG&quot; or &quot;REIT-Aktiengesellschaft&quot;.
* At least 75% of its assets have to be invested in real estate.
* At least 75% of the G-REIT&#x27;s gross revenues must be real-estate related.
* At least 90% of the REIT&#x27;s taxable income has to be distributed to its shareholders through dividends.
* The corporation is income-tax-exempt, but the shareholders will have to pay individual income tax on the dividends.
* Investments in residential properties built before 1 January 2007 are not permitted.

The German public real-estate sector accounts for 0.21% of the total global REIT market capitalization. Three out of the four G-REITS are represented in the EPRA index, an index managed by the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA).

===Ireland===
The 2013 Finance Act contained provisions for creating REIT structures in Ireland. Irish based REITs include Hibernia REIT, Green REIT, Yew Grove REIT and IRES REIT.

===Spain===

Created in 2009, similar to British REITs, the SOCIMI (Sociedad cotizada de Capital Inmobiliario) boosted after a policy of fiscal incentives to help recover the biggest home prices crisis in Spain, in 2013. There are more than 70 REITS in Spain, but the liquidity is low and the holding period is large.

=== United Kingdom ===

The legislation laying out the rules for REITs in the United Kingdom was enacted in the Finance Act 2006 (now see the Corporation Tax Act 2010 sections 518 to 609) and came into effect in January 2007 when nine UK property-companies converted to REIT status, including five FTSE 100 members at that time: British Land, Hammerson, Landsec, Liberty International and Slough Estates. The other four companies were Brixton (now known as &quot;SEGRO&quot;), Great Portland Estates, Primary Health Properties and Workspace Group.

British REITs have to distribute 90% of their income to investors. They must be a close-ended investment trust and be UK-resident and publicly listed on a stock exchange. The EPRA in Brussels each year publishes a breakdown of the UK REIT structure requirements.

To support the introduction of REITs in the UK, several commercial property and financial-services companies formed the REITs and Quoted Property Group. Other key bodies involved include the London Stock Exchange the British Property Federation and Reita. The Reita campaign was launched on 16 August 2006 by the REITs and Quoted Property Group in order to provide a source of information on REITs, quoted property and related investment-funds. Reita aims to raise awareness and understanding of REITs and of investment in quoted property companies. It does this primarily through its portal www.reita.org, providing knowledge, education and tools for financial advisers and investors.

Doug Naismith, managing director of European Personal Investments for Fidelity International, said in 2011: &quot;As existing markets expand and REIT-like structures are introduced in more countries, we expect to see the overall market grow by some ten percent per annum over the next five years, taking the market to $1 trillion by 2010.&quot;

The Finance Act 2012 brought five main changes to the REIT regime in the UK: 
# the abolition of the 2% entry charge to join the regime—this should make REITs more attractive due to reduced costs 
# relaxation of the listing requirements—REITs can now be Alternative Investment Market quoted (the London Stock Exchange&#x27;s international market for smaller growing companies)—making a listing more attractive due to reduced costs and greater flexibility
# a REIT now has a three-year grace period before having to comply with close company rules (a close company is a company under the control of five or fewer investors)
# a REIT will not be considered to be a close company if it can be made close by the inclusion of institutional investors (authorised unit trusts, OEICs, pension schemes, insurance companies and bodies which are sovereign immune)—this point makes REITs attractive investment trusts
# the interest cover test of 1.25 times finance costs is not as onerous

Boyd Carson of Sapphire Capital Partners commented that &quot;the most important of these advantages is the ability for REITs to be listed on the AIM and the abolition of the 2% entry charge to the regime is also a significant step forward.&quot; However, &quot;UK-REITs are still not as cash driven as the market would likely prefer&quot;.

== Americas ==
=== Brazil ===
REITs were introduced in Brazil in 1993 by the law 8668–93 and initially ruled by the instruction 205/94 and, nowadays, by instruction 472/08 from CVM (Comissão de Valores Mobiliários - which is the Brazilian equivalent of SEC). Locally they are described as &quot;FII&quot;s or &quot;Fundos de Investimento Imobiliário&quot;. FII&#x27;s dividends have been free of taxes for personal investors (not companies) since 2006, but only for the funds which have at least 50 investors and that are publicly traded in the stock market. FIIs, referred to as &quot;REIT&quot; to correspond with the similar investment vehicle in the US, have been used either to own and operate independent property investments, associated with a single property or part property, or to own several real properties (multiple properties) funded through the capital markets.

=== Canada ===

Canadian REITs were established in 1993. They are required to be configured as trusts and are not taxed if they distribute their net taxable income to shareholders. REITs have been excluded from the income trust tax legislation passed in the 2007 budget by the Conservative government. Many Canadian REITs have limited liability. On December 16, 2010, the Department of Finance proposed amendments to the rules defining &quot;Qualifying REITs&quot; for Canadian tax purposes. As a result, &quot;Qualifying REITs&quot; are exempt from the new entity-level, &quot;specified investment flow-through&quot; (SIFT) tax that all publicly traded income trusts and partnerships are paying as of January 1, 2011.

=== Mexico ===
Mexico has passed legislation to allow for the equivalent of REITs, known as FIBRAs (Fideicomiso de Infraestructura y Bienes Raíces), to be traded in the Mexican Stock Exchange. Like REITs legislation in other countries, companies must qualify as a FIBRA by complying with the following rules:
* at least 70% of assets must be invested in financing or owning of real estate assets, with the remaining amount invested in government-issued securities or debt-instrument mutual funds.
* Acquired or developed real estate assets must be income generating and held for at least four years.
* If shares, known as Certificados de Participación Inmobiliarios or CPIs, are issued privately, there must be more than 10 unrelated investors in the FIBRA.
* The FIBRA must distribute 95% of annual profits to investors.

The first Mexican REIT was launched in 2011 and is called FIBRA UNO. 
According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Mexican REITs debuted in March 2011 &quot;after government regulatory changes made the structure possible. Fibras offered investors an easy way to own Mexican real estate and pick up an attractive dividend at the same time. Like U.S. REITs, Fibras avoid paying corporate taxes as long as they distribute at least 95% of their income to shareholders as dividends.&quot;

=== United States ===

==== History ====
The U.S. Congress enacted the law providing for REITs in 1960. The law was intended to provide a real estate investment structure similar to the one that mutual funds provide for investment in stocks. REITs are strong income vehicles because, to avoid incurring liability for U.S. federal income tax, REITs generally must pay out an amount equal to at least 90 percent of their taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders.

From 2008 to 2011, REITs faced challenges from both a slowing United States economy and the Great Recession.

For the five-year period ending in 2019, the S&amp;P 500 index, an index of stocks for US large cap companies, returned an annualized 12.5% compared with an annualized return of 9.0% for the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs index. However, for the years 1972-2019 the total annualized returns were 12.1% for the S&amp;P 500 versus 13.3% for the FTSE NAREIT index. There are more than 190 public REITs listed on exchanges in the United States.

==== Legislation ====

Under U.S. Federal income tax law, a REIT is &quot;any corporation, trust or association that acts as an investment agent specializing in real estate and real estate mortgages&quot; under Internal Revenue Code section 856. The rules for federal income taxation of REITs are found primarily in Part II (sections 856 through 859) of Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Because a REIT is entitled to deduct dividends paid to its owners (commonly referred to as shareholders), a REIT may avoid incurring all or part of its liabilities for U.S. federal income tax. To qualify as a REIT, an organization makes an &quot;election&quot; to do so by filing a Form 1120-REIT with the Internal Revenue Service, and by meeting certain other requirements. The purpose of this designation is to reduce or eliminate corporate tax, thus avoiding double taxation of owner income. In return, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income into the hands of investors. The REIT structure was designed to provide a real estate investment structure similar to the structure mutual funds provide for investment in stocks.

==== Structure ====

In the United States, a REIT is a company that owns, and in most cases operates, income-producing real estate. Some REITs finance real estate. To be a REIT, a company must distribute at least 90 percent of its taxable income to shareholders annually in the form of dividends.

To qualify as a REIT under U.S. tax rules, a company must:
* Be structured as a corporation, trust, or association
* Be managed by a board of directors or trustees
* Have transferable shares or transferable certificates of interest
* Otherwise be taxable as a domestic corporation
* Not be a financial institution or an insurance company
* Be jointly owned by 100 persons or more
* Have 95 percent of its income derived from dividends, interest, and property income
* Pay dividends of at least 90% of the REIT&#x27;s taxable income
* Have no more than 50% of the shares held by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year (5/50 rule)
* Have at least 75% of its total assets invested in real estate
* Derive at least 75% of its gross income from rents or mortgage interest
* Have no more than 25% of its assets invested in taxable REIT subsidiaries.
