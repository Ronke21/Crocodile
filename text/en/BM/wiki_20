India&#x27;s first Regional Rapid Transit System Delhi Meerut RRTS is currently being constructed in Meerut, and is set to be an inter-city high-speed metro corridor. Meerut is also known as the expressway capital of Western Uttar Pradesh, having three different expressways.

==Origin of the name==
The name of the city Meerut is believed to have evolved from the Sanskrit term &quot;Mahi Rashtra&quot; (मयराष्ट्र), which refers to the capital of the kingdom of Mayasura, the father of Mandodari and father-in-law of Ravana in Hindu mythology. Over time, the name may have undergone several transformations, evolving from &quot;Mahi Rashtra&quot; to &quot;Mairashtra&quot;, then to &quot;Mai-dant-ka-khera&quot;, &quot;Mairaath&quot;, and finally to the present-day &quot;Meerut&quot;.

According to another version, Maya(sura), being a distinguished architect, received from King Yudhishthira the land on which the city of Meerut now stands and he called this place Maharashtra, a name which over time became shortened to Meerut. Tradition also states that the city formed a part of the dominions of Mahipala, the king of Indraprastha, and the word Meerut is associated with his name.

==History==
===Ancient era===
In Ramayana, It was known as &#x27;Maydant Ka Kheda&#x27;, the capital of May Danav. It was hometown of Mandodari, wife of Ravana.

After the archaeological excavations at Vidura-ka-tila, a collection of several mounds named after Vidura, in 1950–52, a site north-east of Meerut, it was concluded to be remains of the ancient city of Hastinapur, the capital of Kauravas and Pandavas of &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, which was washed away by Ganges floods.

Meerut also contained a Harappan settlement known as Alamgirpur, the easternmost settlement of the Indus Valley civilisation. Meerut had been a centre of Buddhism in the period of Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (r. 273 BC to 232 BC.), and remains of Buddhist structures were found near the Jama Masjid in the present day city. The Ashoka Pillar, at Delhi ridge, next to the ‘Bara Hindu Rao Hospital’, near Delhi University and was carried to Delhi from Meerut by Firuz Shah Tughluq (r. 1351–1388); it was later damaged in a 1713 explosion, and restored in 1867.

===Muslim conquests===
In the eleventh century AD, the region to the south-west of the city was ruled by Har Dat, the &quot;Dor Raja&quot; of Bulandshahr who built a fort, which was long known for its strength and finds mention in &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot;. He was later defeated by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1018, surrendering along with his forces to Mahmud. The prominent local landmark known as the Jama Masjid, dates from this period and is said to have been built by Mahmud&#x27;s vizier. Shortly after its capture the city was regained by the local Hindu Raja and part of his fortifications, built for the city&#x27;s defence, survived until recent times. Muhammad of Ghor&#x27;s mamluk general Qutb-ud-din Aybak who went on to establish the Delhi Sultanate in 1206, attacked and captured Meerut in 1193.

Timur in 1399 attacked and sacked Meerut. It was held by Ilyas Afghan and his son Maula Muhammad Thaneswari who was assisted by non-Muslims led by Safi. Timur tried to negotiate a surrender, to which the inhabitants of the fort replied by stating that Tarmashirin had tried to capture it in the past but failed. Incensed, he set forth with 10,000 cavalry. The forces scaled the walls and Safi was killed in the battle. The inhabitants were killed and their wives and children enslaved. The fortifications and houses were razed to the ground with prisoners ordered to be flayed alive.

The city then came under the rule of the Mughal Empire and saw a period of relative tranquility. During the rule of Mughal Emperor Akbar (r. 1556–1605), there was a mint for copper coins here. Also occurring during the reign of Akbar, Meerut was listed in the Ain-i-Akbari as a pargana under Delhi Sarkar, producing a revenue of 4,391,996 dams for the imperial treasury and supplying a force of 300 infantry and 100 cavalry.
Major part of the Meerut was in the control of Sayyid Jagirdars of Abdullapur Meerut from 16th to late 18th century, Sayyed Mir Abdulla Naqvi Al Bukhari built Kot Fort in Abdullapur in 16th century, this place was his main residence. The descendants of Syed Sadarudin Shah Kabir Naqvi Al Kannauji Bukhari still present in this town, Sadarudin was a chief advisor of Sikandar Lodi and the father of great saint Shah Jewna. Famous Pakistani writer Syed Qudrat Naqvi Al Bukhari was born in Meerut.

Nawab Mansab Ali Khan was one of the most influential personalities of this city, he built the famous Karbala and Masjid, known as Mansabiya in 1882.

The city saw Sikh and Maratha invasions in the 18th century, with interruptions by Taga Brahman and Rohillas. Walter Reinhardt, a European soldier, established himself at Sardhana, and some parts of the district came under his rule. Upon his death, these areas came into the hands of Begum Samru. During this time, the southern part of the district had remained under the Maratha Confederacy&#x27;s rule.

===Colonial era===
In 1803, with the fall of Delhi, Daulat Rao Scindia of the Marathas ceded the territory to the British East India Company (EIC). The cantonment of Meerut was set up in 1806 with particular key interests, including its closeness to Delhi and its area inside the rich Ganga – Yamuna doab. The city was made headquarters of the eponymous district in 1818.

Meerut is famously associated with the 1857 rebellion against Company rule in India. The famous slogan &quot;Dilli Chalo&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s march to Delhi!&quot;) was first spoken in the city, and the Meerut cantonment was the place where the rebellion started.

The revolt, which catapulted Meerut into international prominence, started in March 1857 at Barrackpore, Bengal. Indian sepoy Mangal Pandey shot at two of his commanding officers, missed, then attempted suicide. He was later executed. By April, the fire of Pandey&#x27;s Uprising scorched north India and reached Meerut, the second-largest East India Company garrison. Here, Europeans and native sepoys were evenly balanced, with a little more than 2,000 on each side. The European cantonment was separated from the Indian one. Close by were Sadar Bazar and Lal Kurti Bazar, the latter named after the red uniforms worn by the Presidency armies. On 24 April 1857, Meerut&#x27;s commander, Colonel Carmichael Smyth, paraded 90 Indian sepoys of the Bengal Cavalry, most of whom had come from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. He ordered the soldiers to fire the new Enfield cartridges they had been supplied with. The cartridges were covered with paper that had to be torn off, and Muslim soldiers believed the paper was greased with pig fat and Hindus, with cow fat. Thus, they refused to touch them when ordered to.

All 85 soldiers were stripped of their uniforms, and court-martialed; they were all sentenced to a decade in prison. The prisoners, who were upper-class members of a cavalry regiment, were shocked at the harsh sentences handed down to them. On 10 May 1857, Kotwal Dhan Singh Gurjar opened the gates of the prison. These soldiers, along with the other imprisoned soldiers, escaped prison and declared themselves free, mutinied, attacked, and killed several Company officials in the city to bring it under their control. This marked the beginning of a widespread revolt across northern India as these soldiers marched towards Delhi. 10 May is still celebrated as a local holiday in Meerut.

Meerut was also the venue of the Meerut Conspiracy Case in March 1929, in which several trade unionists, including three Englishmen, were arrested by the colonial authorities for organizing a railway strike action. The case quickly became the subject of attention in England, inspiring a 1932 play titled &quot;Meerut Prisoners&quot; by left-wing Manchester street theatre group the &quot;Red Megaphones&quot;, which highlighted the detrimental effects of capitalism and Industrialisation. Electricity was first introduced to Meerut in 1931. In the 1940s, during the height of the Indian independence movement, cinema-goers in Meerut had an unofficial policy of refusing to stand up when &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; played before the film was shown. The last session of the Indian National Congress (INC) before the independence of India in 1947 was held at Victoria Park in Meerut on 26 November 1946. It was in this session that the Constitution-making committee was constituted.

===Post-independence era===
The city and district also suffered from communal (Hindu-Sikh) riots in 1984 and (Hindu-Muslim) riots in 1982 and in 1987, during which the Hashimpura massacre took place, in May 1987, when personnel of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) shot dead 42 Muslims, the trial of the case is still pending. In 2006, a fire at a consumer electronics &quot;Brand India&quot; fair in Victoria Park Stadium killed at least 100 people, with authorities already confirming 45 fatalities, although a specific figure on a toll was difficult to put and was predicted to be much higher.

<text>Gillidanda is an ancient sport originating from South Asia that is still widely played throughout South Asia. The sport is also found as far north as the Mediterranean and as far east as Southeast Asia. It was a precursor to cricket in South Asia. 

The game is played with two sticks: a large one called a &quot;danda&quot;, which is used to hit a smaller one, the &quot;gilli&quot;. It bears many similarities to bat and ball games such as cricket and baseball.

==History==
The sport of gillidanda is derived from &quot;ghaṭikā&quot;, literally &quot;tip-cat&quot;. Ghaṭikā is still known to countries from the Indian subcontinent and south Asian countries like Bangladesh and India. In Bangladesh, it is known as &quot;ḍāṅguli khelā&quot; while in Nepali, it is known as &quot;dandi biyo&quot; (डण्डी बियो), which is a similar game. The longer stick in &quot;ḍāṅguli khelā&quot; should be about and the shorter stick about . There are certain rules for preparing the sticks and playing the game with them. Gillidanda traces its roots back to ancient India. The game has been played for centuries and holds cultural significance. It was not only a source of recreation but also a way to develop physical agility and coordination among players.

==Rules==

Gillidanda is played with two pieces of equipment – a &quot;danda&quot;, being a long wooden stick, and a &quot;gilli&quot;, a small oval-shaped piece of wood. It is played with four or more players of even numbers.

Standing in a small circle, the player balances the &quot;gilli&quot; on a stone in an inclined manner (somewhat like a see-saw) with one end of the &quot;gilli&quot; touching the ground while the other end is in the air. The player then uses the &quot;danda&quot; to hit the &quot;gilli&quot; at the raised end, which flips it into the air. While it is in the air, the player strikes the &quot;gilli&quot;, hitting it as far as possible. After striking the gilli, the player is required to run and touch a pre-agreed point outside the circle before an opponent retrieves the gilli.There are no specific dimensions of gillidanda and it does not have a limited number of players.

The &quot;gilli&quot; becomes airborne after it is struck. If a fielder from the opposing team catches the &quot;gilli&quot;, the striker is out. If the &quot;gilli&quot; lands on the ground, the fielder closest to the &quot;gilli&quot; has one chance to hit the &quot;danda&quot; (which has to be placed on top of the circle used) with a throw (similar to a run out in cricket). If the fielder is successful, the striker is out; if not, the striker scores one point and gets another opportunity to strike. The team (or individual) with the most points wins the game. If the striker fails to hit the &quot;gilli&quot; in three tries, the striker is out (similar to a strikeout in baseball). After the &quot;gilli&quot; has been struck, the opposing players need to return to the circle or, in the best case, catch it in mid-air without it hitting the ground– this was believed to have later evolved into a Catch Out in cricket and baseball.

==Variations==
As an amateur youth sport, gilli danda has many regional variations. In some versions, the number of points a striker score depends on the distance the &quot;gilli&quot; falls from the striking point. The distance is measured in terms of the length of the danda, or in some cases the length of the &quot;gilli&quot;. Scoring also depends on how many times the &quot;gilli&quot; was hit in the air in one strike. If it travels a certain distance with two mid-air strikes, the total points are doubled. If the &quot;gilli&quot; is not struck far enough the player has to pick it up and try again.

Shobhit Maurya is a world champion of gilli danda at present with several world records in his name. The UNESCO Advisory Committee and the International Council of Traditional Sports and Games (ICTSG) are keen to revive and promote all such traditional sports which are almost dying throughout the world.

In one variation, the striker hits the gilli and when the gilli flies and lands at a distance (short or far), the striker then tells the bowler how much the distance is between where he is standing and where the gillis has fallen, i.e. how many lengths of danda. It is a guess of course, but mostly correct. The bowler or thrower either accepts the score or can measure the length himself. If a wrong score is found by measuring, striker is out.

== In popular culture ==
The 2014 Marathi sport/drama movie &quot;Vitti Dandu&quot; was made on the same sport.

The Bollywood movie &quot;Lagaan&quot; mentions the traditional youth sport of gillidanda as being similar to cricket.

The 2021 Nepali movie &quot;Damaru Ko Dandibiyo&quot; starring Khagendra Lamichhane portrays an underdog team winning the gillidanda league in the hills of Nepal.

The Hindi writer Premchand wrote a short story named &quot;Gilli-danda&quot; in which he compares old simple times and emotions to modern values and also hints at caste inequalities in India. The protagonist and narrator of the story recounts his inability to play &quot;gilli-danda&quot; well in his youth. He remembers a friend who could control the gilli as he wished. He goes away and comes back as an adult and a government officer. He searches for his old friend and finds him – he is very poor and says, &quot;Where do we get the time?&quot; when asked by the protagonist whether he plays gilli-danda. The protagonist convinces him to play – he cheats at every opportunity, but his friend meekly submits, even though he would not have let him get away with such deceit in his youth. After being defeated, the friend invites him to a gilli-danda match the next day. The protagonist is shocked when he sees his friend play just as well as before and realises that he had indulged him because he knew that he had forgotten the basics of gilli-danda. The protagonist feels very small and goes back to the city humiliated.

The 1934 Laurel &amp; Hardy film &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; features Laurel playing the US version of the game, which he refers to as &quot;Pee Wee.&quot;

<text>Samburu County is a county in the former Rift Valley Province, Kenya which covers an area of roughly 21,000 km2 (8,000 mi2) in northern Kenya where the Samburu, Turkana and many other tribes live. It stretches north from the Wuaso Ng&#x27;iro River to the south of Lake Turkana. According to the 2019 census, the county had a population of 310,327.

Within Samburu County are the towns of Maralal (the capital and largest town), Baragoi, Archers Post, South Horr, Wamba, Lodosoit, and Kisima.

It also includes the Samburu National Reserve, Bisanadi National Reserve, and Buffalo Springs National Reserve, Mount Ng&#x27;iro, Ndoto Mountains, Mathews Range (Ol Doinyo Lenkiyo), Kirisia Hills, and Loroki Forest.

The main access road to Samburu County is the A4 road from Rumuruti-Maralal-Baragoi, which as of 2019 was being tarmacked from Rumuruti up to Maralal.

There is a town named Samburu in Kwale County, Kenya, but it is not related to Samburu County or Samburu people.

==County subdivisions==
The county has three constituencies: Samburu East, Samburu West, and Samburu North. The headquarters of Samburu Central is Maralal, Samburu North is Baragoi and headquarters for Samburu East is Wamba although there has been controversy about the headquarters of Samburu East. Some schools of thought proposed Archers Post, a rapidly growing town, while others proposed Wamba town a less rapidly growing town.

== Government ==
The Samburu County Government is headed by Governor Jonathan Lati Leleliit who won the Samburu County&#x27;s gubernatorial race in the 2022 general elections under the United Democratic Alliance (UDA). He garnered 40,740 votes against Dr. Richard Lesiyampe of the Jubilee Party who got 26,834 votes, and Daniel Lekupe an independent candidate, who garnered 1,847 votes, coming in third, and Richard Leiyagu who came last with 771 votes. He succeeded the former governor, Moses Lenolkulal, who retired after two terms in office. A member of the national Jubilee party, Lenolkulal was the first governor following Kenya&#x27;s devolution to county administrations.

<text>Mark Brandon &quot;Chopper&quot; Read (17 November 1954 – 9 October 2013) was an Australian convicted criminal, gang member and author. Read wrote a series of semi-autobiographical fictional crime novels and children&#x27;s books. The 2000 film &quot;Chopper&quot; is based on his life.

==Early life==
Read was born on 17 November 1954 to former army and World War II veteran of Irish descent, Keith Read, and a mother who was a devout Seventh-day Adventist. He grew up in the Melbourne suburbs of Collingwood and Fitzroy. He was bullied at school, saying that by the age of 15 he had been on the &quot;losing end of several hundred fights&quot; and that his father, usually on his mother&#x27;s recommendation, beat him often. Read was also molested as a child. He was made a ward of the state by the age of 14, and was placed in several mental institutions as a teenager, where he stated he underwent electroshock therapy.

==Criminal activity==
When he was still young, Read was already an accomplished street fighter and the leader of the Surrey Road gang, which had a notorious reputation for violence. He began his criminal career by robbing drug dealers based in massage parlours in the Prahran area. He later graduated to kidnapping and torturing members of the criminal underworld, often using a blowtorch or bolt cutters to remove the toes of his victims as an incentive for them to produce enough money so that Read would leave them alive.

Read spent only 13 months outside prison between the ages of 20 and 38, having been convicted of crimes including armed robbery, firearm offences, assault, arson, impersonating a police officer and kidnapping. While in Pentridge Prison&#x27;s H division in the late 1970s, Read launched a prison war. &quot;The Overcoat Gang&quot; wore long coats all year round to conceal their weapons, were involved in several hundred acts of violence against a larger gang during this period. Around this time, Read had a fellow inmate cut both of his ears off to be able to leave H division temporarily. In his biography, Read claimed this was to avoid an ambush by other inmates by being transferred to the mental health wing. His later works state that he did so to &quot;win a bet&quot;. The nickname &quot;Chopper&quot; was given to him long before this, from a childhood cartoon character, Chopper a dog that is featured in Yakky Doodle.

In 1978, while Read was incarcerated, his associate Amos Atkinson held 30 people hostage at The Waiters Restaurant in Melbourne while demanding Read&#x27;s release. After shots were fired, the siege was lifted when Atkinson&#x27;s mother, in her dressing gown, arrived at the restaurant to act as go-between. Atkinson&#x27;s mother hit him over the head with her handbag and told him to &quot;stop being so stupid&quot;. Atkinson then surrendered. 

Read was stabbed by members of his gang in a sneak attack when they felt that his plan to cripple every other inmate in the division to win the gang war in one fell swoop was going too far. Another theory is that James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Loughnan, a friend of Read, with Patrick &quot;Blue&quot; Barnes, wished to benefit from a contract put on Read&#x27;s head by the Painters&#x27; and Dockers&#x27; Union. Read lost several feet of intestine in the attack. Read was serving a 16½-year sentence after attacking a judge to get Loughnan released from prison. Loughnan later died in the Jika Jika fire at Pentridge in 1987.

In the TV series &quot;Tough Nuts&quot;, Read also spoke of his mid-1980s to early 1990s rivalry with Alphonse Gangitano. Read explained that he had a disagreement with Gangitano regarding an elderly neighbourhood hero, whom Gangitano admired. It is alleged by Read that Gangitano burst open a toilet cubicle door with a number of associates and began a serious assault on Read, who made his escape but not before smearing his faeces into Gangitano&#x27;s face.

In 1992, Read was convicted of shooting Sidney Michael Edward Collins in the chest. The incident took place in Read&#x27;s car, which was in the driveway of Collins&#x27; residence at Evandale, Tasmania. The bullet was recovered from the back seat of the vehicle and Collins named Read as the shooter. Pleading not guilty, Read was convicted of committing an unlawful act intended to cause bodily harm, a downgraded charge from attempted murder and sentenced as a &quot;dangerous criminal&quot; to indefinite detention.

An appeal against the conviction was rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 24 August 1993. A second appeal against the sentence was argued on 28 February 1994, with Michael Hodgman, QC; Anita Betts appearing for Read and Tasmanian Director of Public Prosecutions, Damian Bugg, QC and Catherine Geason appearing for the Crown, on the grounds that it was manifestly excessive and also specifically in respect of the &quot;dangerous criminal&quot; declaration. The second appeal was rejected on 10 March 1994. In a subsequent review of the &quot;dangerous criminal&quot; declaration on 18 July 1997, Hodgman succeeded in overturning the declaration.

Read was granted parole early in 1998 and regained his freedom. In 2002, Read was again questioned over the disappearance of Sidney Collins, who is still on the Australian Missing Person list after going missing in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Read admitted to having murdered Collins in his last broadcast interview on the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; program aired on 20 October 2013. Read expressed no remorse for killing Collins, alleging he was &quot;stupid&quot; for allowing Read to shoot him on two occasions with his own gun.

In the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview, he also discussed the 1971 shooting of union boss Desmond Costello, the 1974 &#x27;suicide&#x27; of child sex offender Reginald Isaacs and the 1987 shooting of Siam Ozerkam (Sammy the Turk). Read variously claimed to have been involved in the killing of 19 people and the attempted murder of 11 others. In 1998, he turned up drunk on a live television show hosted by Elle McFeast and, to the outrage of many viewers, &quot;gave a colourful account of feeding a man into a cement mixer&quot;. In an April 2013 interview with the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Read said &quot;Look, honestly, I haven&#x27;t killed that many people, probably about four or seven, depending on how you look at it&quot;.

==Other activities==
In 2001, Read was featured in an advertisement on behalf of the Pedestrian Council of Australia warning of the dangers of drunk driving.

In 2005, Read embarked on a tour of Australia performing a series of shows titled &quot;I&#x27;m Innocent&quot; with Mark &quot;Jacko&quot; Jackson (Read&#x27;s manager) and later toured Sydney in a stage show with a new co-star, former detective Roger &quot;The Dodger&quot; Rogerson and throughout Australia with comedian and friend Doug Chappel. Read even made regular guest appearance on Doug Chappel&#x27;s Melbourne International Comedy Festival show in 2008 called &#x27;Comics Live in your Lounge&#x27; where the two of them told stories on stage together.

In 2006, Read appeared in another commercial speaking out against domestic violence. On 13 March 2006, he released a rap album titled &quot;Interview with a Madman&quot;. He also appeared in the 2002 Australian comedy &quot;Trojan Warrior&quot;. Read, persuaded by Andrew Roper, his manager, to allow use of his name to a wine, &quot;Chopper Red&quot; and later to a beer called &quot;Chopper Heavy&quot;. The beer is produced in Rutherglen, Victoria, a town associated with Australia&#x27;s most notorious outlaw, Ned Kelly. In 2007, despite his apparent successes, he was forced to declare bankruptcy, which included an $80,000 credit card debt and $140,000 in private loans to 12 people. Roper was later replaced by Andrew Parisi as manager.

He made the headlines again, on 15 December 2008, after being questioned by police about an alleged incident in Johnson Street, Collingwood. Read was attacked by a tomahawk-wielding man he said he had never met before. He said: &quot;I ran to the panelbeater&#x27;s and grabbed a pipe. I said, &#x27;Come here now&#x27; and he jumped into a car and pissed off.&quot; Read suffered a minor injury to his arm after being hit with the blunt end of the tomahawk. Read was questioned by detectives at Richmond police station before being released without charge. His alleged attacker has not been found.

===Author===
Read was an author of crime novels, selling more than 500,000 copies of his works. His first book, &quot;Chopper: From the Inside&quot;, was collected from letters he sent while incarcerated in Melbourne&#x27;s Pentridge Prison and published in 1991. It contains tales and anecdotes of his criminal and prison exploits. Further biographical releases followed in a similar vein. With the advent of &quot;Chopper 5: Pulp Faction&quot;, Read began writing fictional tales based on his experiences of criminal life. Attempts were made to ban a children&#x27;s book written by Read titled &quot;Hooky the Cripple&quot;. In later years he made recordings of voice narratives which also sold well.

==Cultural references==
A fictionalised version of Read was featured in several sketches on &quot;The Ronnie Johns Half Hour&quot;. In some of these sketches, such as &quot;Harden The Fuck Up!&quot;, Read was portrayed by Heath Franklin. Read said that although the parody was not totally accurate, he found it funny.

Science fiction author William Gibson based a character (Keith Blackwell) in the final two books of his &quot;Bridge&quot; trilogy on Read. In the second book of the trilogy, &quot;Idoru&quot;, Gibson wrote in his acknowledgments:

Jim G. Thirlwell, in his 1995 Foetus release, &quot;Gash&quot;, wrote and performed a song titled &quot;Steal Your Life Away&quot; which included a somewhat Read-like persona and several quotes from Read&#x27;s first book, including &quot;I&#x27;m a garbage disposal expert&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve got to stand at the edge of the grave for the rest of your life&quot;, &quot;Me and my mental health don&#x27;t agree most times&quot; and &quot;Why ask why?&quot;.

Chopper features on hip hop songs with artists such as Brad Strut, Bias B and Necro.

===Film===
The 2000 film &quot;Chopper&quot;, starring Eric Bana as Read, was based on stories from Read&#x27;s books and independent research, leading to events portrayed on screen that somewhat contradicted Read&#x27;s version. For instance, Read claimed in early books to be vehemently against drugs, but the film portrays him as a casual drug user. In response, Read stated, &quot;You have to have tried something to be able to say you hate it.&quot;

===&quot;Underbelly&quot;===
Read was featured twice in the Australian true-crime series &quot;Underbelly&quot;. He first appeared in the fifth episode of the show&#x27;s second series, &quot;&quot;, where he was played by Renato Fabretti. Read later appeared as the lead character in the show&#x27;s seventh season, &quot;Underbelly Files: Chopper&quot;. The two-part miniseries focused on Read&#x27;s attempts at going straight after his stint in Pentridge Prison, as well as the beginning of his writing career and his feud with Syd Collins and underworld figure Alphonse Gangitano. The cast featured Aaron Jeffery as Read, Vince Colosimo as Alphonse Gangitano, Michael Caton as Read&#x27;s father Keith, Todd Lasance as Syd Collins, Zoe Ventoura as Read&#x27;s first wife Mary-Ann Hodge, and Ella Scott Lynch as Read&#x27;s lifelong friend and eventual second-wife Margaret Cassar.

==Personal life==
Read married Australian Taxation Office employee Mary-Ann Hodge in 1995 while imprisoned in Risdon Prison in Tasmania for the shooting of Sidney Collins. They had one son, and divorced in 2001. On 19 January 2003, he married long-time friend Margaret Cassar, and they had one son.

===Health issues and death===
Read contracted hepatitis C during his time in prison, possibly as a result of using shared razor blades. In March 2008 he revealed he only had two to five years to live and required a liver transplant. However, he refused to agree to the procedure, stating that while a transplant would save him, he did not want one when an organ could be provided to someone else. In April 2012, he was diagnosed with liver cancer. He underwent surgery in July 2012 to remove tumours from his liver
and in late September 2013 he was admitted to Melbourne Private Hospital in failing health. He died of the illness on 9 October 2013, aged 58, in Parkville, Victoria at Royal Melbourne Hospital.

<text>Nine ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS &quot;Albion&quot; after Albion, an archaic name for Great Britain:
* was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line launched in 1763. She was converted into a floating battery in 1794 and was wrecked in 1797.
* was the mercantile &quot;Albion&quot; launched at Sunderland in 1797 that the Royal Navy purchased in 1798 for service as a sloop. The Navy sold her at Sheerness in 1803. She became a transport. It is possible that she foundered in August 1808.
* was a 74-gun third rate launched in 1802. She was used for harbour service from 1831 and was broken up in 1836.
* was a 90-gun second rate launched in 1842. She was converted to screw propulsion in 1861 and was broken up in 1884.
* was a &quot;Canopus&quot;-class pre-dreadnought battleship launched in 1898 and sold in 1919.
* was a &quot;Centaur&quot;-class aircraft carrier launched in 1947. She was converted into a commando carrier in 1962, sold in 1973, resold later that year and then broken up.
* is an &quot;Albion&quot;-class Landing Platform Dock ship launched in 2001 and currently in service.

Other RN vessels named &quot;Albion&quot; were;
* &quot;Albion II&quot;, an armed trawler taken up in 1915 and sunk by a mine in 1916.
* &quot;Albion II&quot;, a Bristol paddle steamer used for minesweeping in 1915.
* &quot;Albion III&quot;, a steam yacht, taken up from 1916 to 1919.

==Hired armed vessels==
* Between 27 April 1793 and 11 September 1794, the Navy employed a ship named &quot;Albion&quot;, of 393 tons burthen.
* During the period of the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy twice hired armed cutters named &quot;Albion&quot;, though these are probably the same vessel. See: Hired armed cutter Albion.

==Battle honours==
* Algiers 1816
* Navarino 1827
* Crimea 1854-5
* Dardanelles 1915

<text>The Padma Bhushan (IAST: &quot;Padma Bhūṣaṇa&quot;, lit. &#x27;Lotus Decoration&#x27;) is the third-highest civilian award in the Republic of India, preceded by the Bharat Ratna and the Padma Vibhushan and followed by the Padma Shri. Instituted on 2 January 1954, the award is given for &quot;distinguished service of a high order ... without distinction of race, occupation, position or sex&quot;. The award criteria includes &quot;service in any field including service rendered by Government servants&quot; including doctors and scientists, but exclude those working with the public sector undertakings. , the award has been bestowed on 1341 individuals, including 38 posthumous and 101 non-citizen recipients.

The Padma Awards Committee is constituted every year by the Prime Minister of India and the recommendations for the award are submitted between 1 May and 15 September. The recommendations are received from all the state and the union territory governments, as well as from Ministries of the Government of India, Bharat Ratna and Padma Vibhushan awardees, the Institutes of Excellence, Ministers, Chief Ministers and Governors of States, Members of Parliament, and private individuals. The committee later submits their recommendations to the Prime Minister and the President of India for further approval. The award recipients are announced on 26 January, the Republic Day of India.

When instituted in 1954, twenty-three recipients were honoured with the Padma Bhushan. The Padma Bhushan, along with other personal civil honours, was briefly suspended twice, from July 1977 to January 1980 and from August 1992 to December 1995. Some of the recipients have refused or returned their conferments.

==History==
On 2 January 1954, a press release was published from the office of the secretary to the President of India announcing the creation of two civilian awards—Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award, and the three-tier Padma Vibhushan, classified into &quot;Pahela Varg&quot; (Class I), &quot;Dusra Varg&quot; (Class II), and &quot;Tisra Varg&quot; (Class III), which rank below the Bharat Ratna. On 15 January 1955, the Padma Vibhushan was reclassified into three different awards: the Padma Vibhushan, the highest of the three, followed by the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Shri.

The award, along with other personal civilian honours, was briefly suspended twice in its history. The first time in July 1977 when Morarji Desai was sworn in as the fourth Prime Minister of India, for being &quot;worthless and politicized.&quot; The suspension was rescinded on 25 January 1980 after Indira Gandhi became the Prime Minister.

The civilian awards were suspended again in mid-1992, when two Public-Interest Litigations were filed in the High Courts of India, one in the Kerala High Court on 13 February 1992 by Balaji Raghavan and another in the Madhya Pradesh High Court (Indore Bench) on 24 August 1992 by Satya Pal Anand. Both petitioners questioned the civilian awards being &quot;titles&quot; per an interpretation of of the Constitution of India.

On 25 August 1992, the Madhya Pradesh High Court issued a notice temporarily suspending all civilian awards. A Special Division Bench of the Supreme Court of India was formed comprising five judges: A. M. Ahmadi C. J., Kuldip Singh, B. P. Jeevan Reddy, N. P. Singh, and S. Saghir Ahmad. On 15 December 1995, the Special Division Bench restored the awards and delivered a judgment that the &quot;Bharat Ratna and Padma awards are not titles under Article 18 of the Constitution of India.&quot;
==Regulations==
The award is conferred for &quot;distinguished service of a high order...without distinction of race, occupation, position or sex.&quot; The criteria include &quot;service in any field including service rendered by Government servants&quot; but exclude those working with the public sector undertakings, with the exception of doctors and scientists. The 1954 statutes did not allow posthumous awards, but this was subsequently modified in the January 1955 statute; D. C. Kizhakemuri became the first recipient to be honoured posthumously in 1999.

The recommendations are received from all the state and the union territory governments, as well as from Ministries of the Government of India, Bharat Ratna and Padma Vibhushan awardees, the Institutes of Excellence, Ministers, Chief Ministers and Governors of States, Members of Parliament, and private individuals. The recommendations received between 1 May and 15 September of every year are submitted to the Padma Awards Committee, convened by the Prime Minister of India. The Awards Committee later submits its recommendations to the Prime Minister and the President of India for further approval.

The Padma Bhushan award recipients are announced every year on 26 January, the Republic Day of India, and registered in &quot;The Gazette of India&quot;a publication released weekly by the Department of Publication, Ministry of Urban Development used for official government notices. The conferral of the award is not considered official without its publication in the &quot;Gazette&quot;. Recipients whose awards have been revoked or restored, both of which actions require the authority of the President, are also registered in the &quot;Gazette&quot; and are required to surrender their medals when their names are struck from the register.

==Specifications==
The original specification of the award was a circle made of standard silver in diameter, with rims on both sides. A centrally located lotus flower was embossed on the obverse side of the medal and the text &quot;Padma Bhushan&quot; written in Devanagari Script was inscribed above the lotus along the upper edge of the medal. A floral wreath was embossed along the lower edge and a lotus wreath at the top along the upper edge. The State Emblem of India was placed in the centre of the reverse side with the text &quot;Desh Seva&quot; in Devanagari Script on the lower edge. The medal was suspended by a pink riband in width divided into three equal segments by two white vertical lines.

A year later, the design was modified. The current decoration is a circular-shaped bronze toned medallion in diameter and thick. The centrally placed pattern made of outer lines of a square of side is embossed with a knob embossed within each of the outer angles of the pattern. A raised circular space of diameter is placed at the centre of the decoration. A centrally located lotus flower is embossed on the obverse side of the medal and the text &quot;Padma&quot; written in Devanagari script is placed above and the text &quot;Bhushan&quot; is placed below the lotus.

The Emblem of India is placed in the centre of the reverse side with the national motto of India, &quot;Satyameva Jayate&quot; (Truth alone triumphs) in Devanagari Script, inscribed on the lower edge. The rim, the edges and all embossing on either side is of standard gold with the text &quot;Padma Bhushan&quot; of gold gilt. The medal is suspended by a pink riband in width with a broad white stripe in the middle.

The medal is ranked fifth in the order of precedence of wearing of medals and decorations. The medals are produced at Alipore Mint, Kolkata along with the other civilian and military awards like Bharat Ratna, Padma Vibhushan, Padma Shri, and Param Vir Chakra.

==Refusals and controversies==
Some of the bestowals of the Padma Bhushan have been refused or returned by the recipients. Bengali theatre activist Sisir Bhaduri (1959) was the first awardee who refused their conferment as &quot;he felt state awards merely help create a sycophantic brigade&quot; and &quot;did not want to encourage the impression that the government was serious about the importance of theatre in national life.&quot; Sitar player Vilayat Khan declined to accept the award in 1968, stating that &quot;the selection committees were incompetent to judge [his] music.&quot; Khan had earlier refused Padma Shri in 1964 and later also turned down Padma Vibhushan in 2000.

Journalist Nikhil Chakravarty rejected the award in 1990 stating that &quot;journalists should not be identified with the establishment.&quot; Historian Romila Thapar refused to accept the award twice, for the first time in 1992, and later again in 2005, stating that she would accept awards only &quot;from academic institutions or those associated with my professional work.&quot; For her 2005 bestowal, Thapar sent a clarification letter to the then President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam mentioning that she had declined to accept the award when the Ministry of Human Resource Development had contacted her three-month prior to the award announcement and had explained her reasons for not accepting the award. Journalist and civil servant K. Subrahmanyam refused his 1999 bestowal citing that &quot;bureaucrats and journalists should not accept any award from the government because they are more liable to be favoured.&quot;

In 2003, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh″s (RSS) volunteer Dattopant Thengadi rejected the award until K. B. Hedgewar (RSS founder) and M. S. Golwalkar (RSS ideologue) are offered the Bharat Ratna. Civil servant S. R. Sankaran turned down the award in 2005 without citing any reason. In 2013, playback singer S. Janaki refused to accept her award and stated that &quot;the award has come late in her five-and-half-decade long career.&quot; The singer also mentioned that she is not against the Government and expressed happiness for the recognition but requested the Government to &quot;show some more consideration to the artists from the southern parts of the country.&quot;

In 2014, family members of J. S. Verma who served as 27th Chief Justice of India refused the posthumous conferral stating that &quot;Verma himself would not have accepted&quot; the honour as he &quot;never hankered or lobbied for any acclaim, reward or favour.&quot;

Kannada novelist K. Shivaram Karanth, who was awarded in 1968, returned his award to protest against the Emergency declared in the country in 1975. Novelist Khushwant Singh, who accepted the award in 1974 in the field of literature and education, returned it in 1984 as a notion of protest against the Operation Blue Star. Singh was later awarded Padma Vibhushan in 2007. Pushpa Mittra Bhargava, 1986 recipient and scientist and founder-director of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), returned his award in 2015 in protest of the Dadri mob lynching and out of concern at the &quot;prevailing socio-politico situation&quot; in the country.

The 2010 conferment on an Indian-American businessman Sant Singh Chatwal, who was awarded the Padma Bhushan in the field of Public Affairs, created much controversy. Known for his association with former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton, Chatwal pled guilty to violating the Federal Election Campaign Act and witness tampering during the 2008 United States presidential election. He was also accused of lobbying for the award by leveraging &quot;his contacts in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office and United States Congress.&quot;

The Government provided clarification regarding the conferment and issued a press release which mentioned Chatwal as a &quot;tireless advocate&quot; of the country&#x27;s interest in the United States. The statement also mentioned that &quot;due diligence&quot; exercise is carried out for each of the awardees and out of five Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered cases against Chatwal between 1992 and 1994, three were closed by CBI itself and in remaining two cases, Chatwal was discharged by the Court and as per the reports that were made available to the selection committee, there is nothing adverse on record against him. According to media reports, there were several cases filed or registered after April 2009 which includes three criminal complaints with Kerala Police and four cases in Delhi High Court and Kerala High Court. Chatwal also served a summons in January 2010. However, the then Union Home Secretary Gopal Krishna Pillai said that &quot;no probe has been ordered nor any report sought from anyone.&quot;

Earlier in 2008, Chatwal was considered for the Padma Shri but the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C. declined to nominate Chatwal when asked by the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. The then Indian Ambassador to the United States Ronen Sen had told PMO that the conferral would not be appropriate because of the controversy associated with his financial dealings in India and America. Sen also mentioned that though positive, Chatwal&#x27;s contributions are much less compared to other Indian-Americans. The bestowal would not only &quot;demoralise the others who had done much more&quot; but also would create &quot;the impression that India did not regard lack of transparency in financial dealings as a disqualification for its highest honours.&quot;

In 2022, former West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya refused to accept his award on the eve of the 73rd Republic Day of India. He reportedly refused to have been intimated about his nomination and straightaway exclaimed in the media that if he has been awarded, he refuses the same. His name appeared on the official list of awardees, and so far he has refused the same.

<doc id="413715" wikidata="Q295168" url="?curid=413715" title="Samo">
<text>Samo (–) founded the first recorded political union of Slavic tribes, known as Samo&#x27;s Empire (&quot;realm&quot;, &quot;kingdom&quot;, or &quot;tribal union&quot;), ruling from 623 until his death in 658. According to Fredegarius, the only contemporary source, Samo was a Frankish merchant who unified several Slavic tribes against robber raids and violence by nearby settled Avars, showing such bravery and command skills in battle that he was elected &quot;King of the Slavs&quot; (). In 631, Samo successfully defended his realm against the Frankish Kingdom in the three-day Battle of Wogastisburg.

==Reign==
The dates for Samo&#x27;s rule are based on Fredegar, who says that he went to the Slavs in the fortieth year of Chlothar II (i.e., 623–24) and reigned for thirty five years. The interpretation that places the start of Samo&#x27;s reign in the year of Fredegar&#x27;s arrival has been questioned on the basis that the Wends would have most likely rebelled after the defeat of the Avar khagan at the First Siege of Constantinople in 626. The Avars first arrived in the Pannonian Basin and subdued the local Slavs in the 560s. Samo may have been one of the merchants who supplied arms to the Slavs for their frequent revolts. Whether he became king during a revolt of 623–24 or during one that inevitably followed the Avar defeat in 626, he definitely took advantage of the latter to solidify his position. A string of victories over the Avars proved his &quot;utilitas&quot; (usefulness) to his subjects and secured his election as &quot;rex&quot; (king). Samo went on to secure his throne by marriage into the major Wendish families, wedding at least twelve women and fathering twenty-two sons and fifteen daughters.

The most well-documented event of Samo&#x27;s career was his victory over the Frankish royal army under Dagobert I in 631 or 632. Provoked to action by a &quot;violent quarrel in the Pannonian kingdom of the Avars or Huns&quot; during his ninth year (631–32), Dagobert led three armies against the Wends, the largest being his own Austrasian army. The Franks were routed near Wogastisburg (Latin &quot;castrum Vogastisburg&quot;), an unidentified location meaning &quot;fortress/castle of Vogast.&quot; The majority of the besieging armies were slaughtered, while the rest of the troops fled, leaving weapons and other equipment lying on the ground. In the aftermath of the Wendish victory, Samo invaded Frankish Thuringia several times and undertook looting raids there. The Sorbian prince Dervan abandoned the Franks and &quot;placed himself and his people under Samo&#x27;s realm&quot;.

In 641, the rebellious duke of Thuringia, Radulf, sought an alliance with Samo against his sovereign, Sigebert III. Samo also maintained long-distance trade relationships. On his death, however, his title was not inherited by his sons. Ultimately, Samo can be credited with forging a Wendish identity by speaking on behalf of the community that recognised his authority.

==Main sources==
The main source of written information on Samo and his empire is the &quot;Fredegarii Chronicon&quot;, a Frankish chronicle written in the mid-7th century (c. 660). Though theories of multiple authorship once abounded, the notion of a single Fredegar is now common scholarly fare. The last or only Fredegar was the author of a brief account of the Wends including the best, and only contemporary, information on Samo. According to Fredegar, &quot;Samo [was] a Frank by birth [or nation] from the &quot;pago Senonago&quot;&quot;, which could be present-day Soignies in Belgium or present-day Sens in France. Although he was of Frankish origin, Samo demanded that an ambassador (Sicharius) of Dagobert I (King of the Franks) put on Slavic clothes before entering his castle.

All other sources for Samo are derived from Fredegar and are much more recent. The &quot;Gesta Dagoberti I regis Francorum&quot; (&quot;Deeds of King Dagobert I of the Franks&quot;) was written in the first third of the 9th century. The &quot;Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum&quot; (&quot;Conversion of the Bavarians and Karantanians&quot;) from Salzburg (the Bavarian ecclesiastic centre), written in 871–72, is a very tendentious source, as its name suggests. According mainly to the &quot;Conversio&quot;, Samo was a Karantanian merchant.

The sources Fredegar used to compile his Wendish account are unknown. A few scholars have attacked the entire account as fictitious, but Fredegar displays a critical attitude and a knowledge of detail that suggest otherwise. It is possible that he had an eyewitness in the person of Sicharius, the ambassador of Dagobert I to the Slavs. According to Fredegar, the &quot;Wends&quot; had long been subjects and &quot;befulci&quot; of the Avars. &quot;Befulci&quot; is a term, cognate with the word &quot;fulcfree&quot; found in the Edict of Rothari, signifying &quot;entrusted [to guard]&quot;, from the Old German root &quot;felhan, falh, fulgum&quot; and Middle German &quot;bevelhen&quot;. Fredegar appears to have envisaged the Wends as a military unit of the Avar host. He probably based his account on &quot;native&quot; Wendish accounts. Fredegar records the story of the &quot;origo gentis&quot; (origin of the people) of the Wends. The Wends were Slavs, but Samo was the only king of the Wends, at least according to Fredegar.

It has also been suggested that Fredegar&#x27;s sources may have been the reports of Christian missionaries, especially disciples of Columbanus and the Abbey of Luxeuil. If this is correct, it may explain why he is remarkably free of typical stereotypes of heathen Slavs, and why he was familiar with the Wends as a specifically pagan nation.

==Popular works==
Few written works have their storyline taking place during Samo&#x27;s Empire. One of them is the 2018 book &quot;Fire Worshipers&quot;, by Vladimír Olej. He is a major character (in the first few episodes as an amnesiac stranger going by &quot;Vlad&quot;) in a Ukrainian-funded series &quot;The Slavs&quot; which was as of September 2024 available on Amazon Video.

<doc id="413718" wikidata="Q7392" url="?curid=413718" title="Emperor Yuan of Jin">
<text>Emperor Yuan of Jin (; 276 – 3 January 323), personal name Sima Rui (), courtesy name Jingwen (), was an emperor of the Jin dynasty and the first emperor of the Eastern Jin. He was the great-grandson of Sima Yi, the grandson of Sima Zhou and the son of Sima Jin ().

During the Upheaval of the Five Barbarians, he was stationed south of the Yangtze in Jiankang where he avoided the chaos that befell northern China. Primarily through the help of the cousins, Wang Dun and Wang Dao, he emerged as a legitimate authority figure within the empire, backed by both the southern gentry clans and northern emigres families who fled to his domain for refuge. After Emperor Min of Jin was executed by the Han-Zhao dynasty in 318, he proclaimed himself Emperor and officially moved the capital to Jiankang. At the time of his death, he left the state under the heel of Wang Dun, but the Eastern Jin dynasty as it became known lasted until its fall in July 420, contending with the Sixteen Kingdoms in the north and occasionally in the southwest. 

== Early career ==
Sima Rui was born in 276 in the Jin capital of Luoyang as the son of Sima Jin (), who was the heir to the Princedom of Langya, and his wife, Xiahou Guangji (). According to an alternative account at the end of his biography in the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, Sima Rui may have been the product of an affair between Lady Xiahou and a minor official from the family of the Cao Wei general, Niu Jin. Sima Rui&#x27;s grandfather Sima Zhou, Prince of Langya and uncle of Emperor Wu of Jin, died in June 283, leaving Sima Jin to inherit the princedom, with Lady Xiahou becoming Princess Consort. Sima Jin died on 9 March 290 at the age of 35 (by East Asian reckoning), and Sima Rui became the Prince of Langya. The &quot;Book of Jin&quot; referred to him as steady and dexterous. 

About two months after Sima Rui became Prince of Langya, Emperor Wu died. Emperor Wu&#x27;s successor, Emperor Hui, was developmentally disabled, and he was under the control of various regents throughout his reign. As the struggle to become Emperor Hui&#x27;s regent (known as the War of the Eight Princes) grew in intensity, Sima Rui was humble in his dealings, and kept himself aloof from political developments in order to protect himself. His ability to hide his talents meant that most people were unaware of them. However, Ji Shao (; son of Ji Kang), who was then Palace Attendant, saw that Sima Rui was special. He said to others, &quot;The Prince of Langya has an extraordinary appearance, which does not belong to that of a subject.&quot;

In 304, in the midst of the War of the Eight Princes, Sima Rui joined Sima Yue, the Prince of Donghai, and his campaign against Sima Ying, the Prince of Chengdu, as a minor general. After Sima Ying defeated Sima Yue, Sima Ying executed Sima Rui&#x27;s uncle Sima Yao (), the Prince of Dong&#x27;an, on 18 September. He decided to flee back to his principality, Langxie (roughly modern Weifang, Shandong), under counsel of Sima Yue&#x27;s assistant Wang Dao, whom he befriended during the campaign. He first attempted to head back to Luoyang, but when he was about to cross the Yellow River, he was stopped by guards who were instructed to stop any nobles or high level officials from crossing; Sima Ying had ordered such, fearing that nobles would desert him or plot against him. His own guard Song Dian () then arrived and shoved him under the ruse that they were both construction workers. The guards then allowed them to cross. After Sima Rui got to Luoyang, he took his mother, Princess Dowager Xiahou, and headed to Langxie where they spent the next few years away from the War of the Eight Princes.

In August 307, Sima Yue had emerged victorious in the aftermath of the War of the Eight Princes as the regent for Emperor Huai (Emperor Hui&#x27;s successor and half-brother) seven months earlier. Under the advice of his wife Princess Pei, he commissioned Sima Rui as the military commander of parts of Yang Province (, modern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu and Anhui) south of the Yangtze River, with his post at Jianye. Prior to his appointment, the region had been under the control of the rebel general, Chen Min from 305 to 307. Many of the southern gentry clans initially backed Chen Min, but towards the end, they became discontented with his rule and returned to Jin by overthrowing him. Within his first year at Jiangdong, his mother Princess Dowager Xiahou died.

Among Sima Rui&#x27;s staff, Wang Dao was entrusted by him as a chief advisor. As Sima Rui lacked fame, after he arrived in Jianye, few of the gentlemen from the southern gentry clans would come visit and support him. Under Wang Dao&#x27;s counsel, Sima Rui personally visited He Xun (; great-grandson of He Qi) and Gu Rong (; grandson of Gu Yong) and invited them to serve in his administration. He and Gu were well regarded by the local population, which eventually began to trust Sima Rui&#x27;s leadership. Wang Dao and his cousin, the general Wang Dun, served in key roles, and it was said at the time that the domain was ruled equally by the Simas and the Wangs.

While Sima Rui was in the south, Sima Yue was preoccupied in quelling rebellions and fighting the Han-Zhao dynasty in the north. Sima Rui was essentially out of Sima Yue&#x27;s reach, but for the first few years, he had to keep in check with the commander, Zhou Fu, who controlled Yang province north of the Yangtze. The deadlock was finally broken in February 311, when Zhou Fu, under fire by the imperial court for suggesting that they move to his base in Shouchun, was forced into rebellion. Sima Rui, now with grounds to attack Zhou Fu, ordered his forces to march north of the Yangtze and annexed the rest of Yang province.

== After the fall of Luoyang ==
In July 311, not long after Sima Yue died in April, Luoyang fell to Han forces and Emperor Huai was captured during the Disaster of Yongjia. A high-ranking minister, Xun Fan was able to escape Luoyang and founded a provisional government near the former capital. Through Xun Fan&#x27;s assent, Sima Rui began to exercise more imperial power as he was acclaimed the leader of the Jin alliance and granted special authority to appoint and dismiss chief officials. With many officials fleeing south of the Yangtze, Wang Dao advised Sima Rui to scout for and recruit the talented men the northern emigres families to serve in his administration. All in all, Sima Rui was able to pick out more than a hundred officials from the northern emigres, and they were collectively known as the &quot;106 Officials&quot;.

South of the Huai river and to the west of Sima Rui, the Inspector of Jiang province (, modern Jiangxi), Hua Yi and the Inspector of Yu province (, modern central Anhui at this time), Pei Xian both outrightly refused to acknowledge Sima Rui&#x27;s new authority. In response, the prince sent Wang Dun to campaign against them, killing Hua and forcing Pei to flee before replacing them with his own followers. In the central Yangtze region, the two provinces of Jing (, modern Hubei) and Xiang (, modern Hunan) had long been struggling with a refugee crisis, due to many people fleeing from the ongoing war with the Cheng-Han dynasty in Sichuan. These refugees, mainly led by Du Tao, eventually rebelled in 311, ousting the Inspector of Xiang and repeatedly defeating the Inspector of Jing, Wang Cheng. Sima Rui took the opportunity to further expand his influence into the central Yangtze, installing his own Inspector of Xiang and convincing Wang Cheng to give up his office. Under the command of Wang Dun and other generals such as Tao Kan and Zhou Fang, the agrarian rebels resisting Jin rule in Jing and Xiang were gradually subjugated.

Though Sima Rui had initially relied on the southern gentry clans to consolidate his rule in the Jiangnan, he eventually began relying more on the northern emigres families as they continued to flock to him. The southern gentry were divided on his shift of trust; while most were willing to tolerate it, others such as Zhou Qi from the Zhou clan of Yixing became resentful towards the northern emigres. The hardliners rallied around Zhou Qi and his family to oust the northern emigres and force Sima Rui to restore the southern clans to power. However, their conspiracies in 313 and 315, were both exposed and did not garner enough support, thus failing to have a major impact on Sima Rui&#x27;s stance.

In 313, after Emperor Huai was executed by the Han, Sima Ye, a nephew of Emperor Huai, was declared emperor (posthumously known as Emperor Min) in Chang&#x27;an. Due to the naming taboo for Emperor Min&#x27;s given name of &quot;Ye&quot; (業), Sima Rui&#x27;s headquarters Jianye (建業) was renamed Jiankang (建康), a name it would keep for several centuries. Sima Rui was named the Left Prime Minister, a title that he accepted; however, he took no actual actions in aid of the emperor. Indeed, even when Sima Yue was still alive, the prince showed little interest in lending his forces to help pacify the north. When his general and the refugee leader, Zu Ti requested to lead an army north, he gave Zu only supplies for one thousand men with no actual troops; Zu had to seek out his own soldiers, but was eventually able to recover a number of cities south of the Yellow River.

In 316, Chang&#x27;an fell to Han forces, and Emperor Min was captured. Sima Rui quickly declared that he was going to act against Han, but then quickly claimed a lack of supplies and cancelled the campaign. In spring 317, his officials requested that he take the throne. After he declined initially, he took the title &quot;King of Jin&quot;—a title previously used by Sima Zhao and Emperor Wu while they were regents of Cao Wei—rather than emperor on 6 April 317. He created his son Sima Shao crown prince on 1 May of the same year.

== Early reign and the loss of Northern China ==
On 7 February 318, Liu Cong, the emperor of Han Zhao, executed Emperor Min. About two and a half months later, on 23 April, news of Emperor Min&#x27;s execution reached Jiankang. Sima Rui then declared himself emperor three days later. At this time, the areas directly under his control were roughly south of the Yellow River and east of the Three Gorges, although pockets of Jin territory in the north—chief among which was Youzhou (modern Beijing, Tianjin, and northern Hebei), controlled by the ethnic Xianbei governor Duan Pidi—largely also recognized him as emperor. However, while technically recognizing him as emperor, Zhang Shi the governor of Liang Province (modern central and western Gansu), chose not to use his era names and instead continued to use Emperor Min&#x27;s era name of Jianxing, thus hinting non-recognition. Additionally, he did not recognize and was non-committal to Sima Bao the Prince of Nanyang&#x27;s claim for emperor, despite his alliance with his father Zhang Gui and whose domain was closely related to the Zhang clan, believing Emperor Yuan would be a more effective emperor but retaining Emperor Min&#x27;s era name: another sign that the Zhang clan sought independence from the Jin, though not immediately at the time. Later that year, when the Han-Zhao emperor Liu Can was overthrown by his official Jin Zhun who initially indicated that he was submitting to Emperor Yuan&#x27;s authority, Emperor Yuan tried to take advantage by sending an army to assist Jin Zhun. However, long before the army could get there, Jin Zhun was defeated by the new Han-Zhao emperor Liu Yao and the general Shi Le.

In 319, Duan Pidi&#x27;s forces fell to Shi Le—who had by that point declared independence from Former Zhao as declared by Liu Yao, establishing Later Zhao in the same year—and Duan fled to another governor still loyal to Jin, Shao Xu the governor of Ji Province (, in what is now central Hebei). In the next year, Shi Le sent his generals Shi Hu and Kong Chang to capture Shao. They were successful but Duan Pidi was able to take control of Shao&#x27;s forces, thus once again leading the resistance in the north. While this was happening, remaining Jin resistance around west of Chang&#x27;an (or Northwest China, in this area Emperor Yuan has no control of these forces—instead this is where Zhang Shi (who technically recognized the emperor) has more control) began to falter as they entered internal conflict. Meanwhile, Sima Bao (who had by then declared himself as Prince of Jin in previous year, ostensibly following the steps of Sima Zhao and did not recognize the emperor by this point) apparently suffering famine and facing Former Zhao invasion, tried to escape to Zhang Shi&#x27;s domain but was denied by the force Zhang Shi sent to &#x27;protect&#x27; him but whose orders were actually to prevent Sima Bao from entering his domain. Failing to rescue himself, he presumably faced resistance by remaining generals under him Yang Tao () and Chen An (which had by this point defected to Han-Zhao, but bearing some loyalty to him) and was soon apparently murdered by his generals Zhang Chun () and Yang Ci (), replacing him with his relative Sima Zhan (since Sima Bao had no sons). Soon after, Former Zhao forces led by Chen An attacked Sima Zhan&#x27;s domain in revenge, killing him and in turn killing Zhang and capturing Yang, ending Jin resistance in the Qin Province. 

Later in 320, Zhang Shi was assassinated by his guards Yan She () and Zhao Ang (), acting from the rumors spread by the magician Liu Hong (). Because Zhang&#x27;s son was still young at the time, his brother and successor Zhang Mao executed Liu Hong and declared a general pardon, effectively declaring his domain independent from the Jin. Additionally, Zhang Mao began to use the era name &quot;Yongguang&quot; () internally, while using &quot;Jianxing&quot; as in communications with other states, which is seen as evidence that Zhang Mao&#x27;s domain is effectively independent from the Jin. though he still continues to refer himself as Governor of Liang Province. This action completely ended Jin rule in Northwest China as his domain would continue evolving into the vacillating state of Former Liang, especially by the time Zhang Jun ruled the state. By 321, Shao Xu&#x27;s forces finally collapsed and Duan Pidi was captured by Shi Le, ending his resistance and all resemblance of Jin rule in China north of the Yellow River—although the Xianbei chief Murong Hui the Duke of Liaodong was still in control of modern Liaoning and still considered himself a Jin vassal.

== Late reign and confrontation with Wang Dun ==
By 320, Emperor Yuan&#x27;s relationship with Wang Dun was at a breaking point, as Wang Dun had grown more and more arrogant and controlling of the western provinces. Emperor Yuan feared him, and therefore began to group men around him who were against Wang Dun as well, such as Liu Huai () and Diao Xie () – men of mixed reputation who, in their efforts to suppress the Wangs&#x27; power, offended many other people.

In 321, Emperor Yuan commissioned Dai Yuan () and Liu with substantial forces, claiming that they were to defend against Later Zhao attacks, but instead was intending to have them defend against a potential Wang Dun attack. The general who actually had a charge of protecting Later Zhao attacks remains held by Zu Ti. By this time, he was a governor of Yu Province under Jin. Zu Ti was popular with the people he governed, was successfully held off attacks from Later Zhao. The next year, Chen Chuan () defected and Zu was defeated but Shi was not able to advance further. In the end, this led into a stalemate, and then informal détente in which peace and trade relations are instituted with Yellow River as the border. When Zu Ti died, there was no one on the Jin side checking the Later Zhao expansion against Jin. After Zu Ti died, the balance of power in the region often vacillated between the Jin and Zhao clans; other players include Cao Ni, a renegade general who ruled Qing Province, and Xu Kan, the general who ultimately surrendered to Jin. Both often had a history of conflicts with the Jin, and both was defeated very quickly by Later Zhao general Shi Hu. Because of these reasons, Jin was unable to hold onto these territories between the Yellow and Huai Rivers and gradually lost them. By the time Cao Ni died, it is likely that Jin does not have any of these territories left; thus these lands were lost for decades until their recovery by Huan Wen during the reign of Emperor Mu of Jin.

In spring 322, Wang Dun started his campaign against Emperor Yuan, claiming that Emperor Yuan was being deluded by Liu and Diao, and that his only intent was to clean up the government. He tried to persuade Gan Zhuo, the governor of Liang Province (what is now northwestern Hubei and southeastern Shaanxi) and Sima Cheng () the governor of Xiang Province to join him, and while both resisted, neither was effective in their campaigns against his rear guards. Wang quickly arrived in Jiankang, defeating Emperor Yuan&#x27;s forces and entering and pillaging Jiankang easily. Liu fled to Later Zhao, while Diao, Dai, and Zhou Yi () were killed. Emperor Yuan was forced to submit and grant Wang Dun additional powers in the west. Wang Dun, satisfied, allowed Emperor Yuan to remain on the throne, and personally withdrew back to his home base of Wuchang. His forces then defeated and killed Sima Cheng, while a subordinate of Gan&#x27;s, acting on Wang&#x27;s orders, assassinated Gan.

After his defeat, Emperor Yuan grew despondent and ill, and died in January 323. Crown Prince Shao succeeded to the throne as Emperor Ming.

<doc id="413723" wikidata="Q1029000" url="?curid=413723" title="Heavy metal genres">
<text>A number of heavy metal genres have developed since the emergence of heavy metal (often shortened to &quot;metal&quot;) during the late 1960s and early 1970s. At times, heavy metal genres may overlap or are difficult to distinguish, but they can be identified by a number of traits. They may differ in terms of instrumentation, tempo, song structure, vocal style, lyrics, guitar playing style, drumming style, and so on.

==Alternative metal==
Alternative metal is a style of heavy metal and alternative rock which emerged in the mid-1980s and gained popularity in the early 1990s.

Alternative metal usually combines heavy metal with influences from genres like alternative rock, and in some cases, other genres not normally associated with metal as well. One of the main characteristics of alternative metal and its subgenres are heavily downtuned, mid-paced &quot;chug&quot;-like guitar riffs. Alternative metal bands are also often characterized by melodic vocals, unconventional sounds within other heavy metal genres, unconventional song structures, and sometimes experimental approaches to heavy music. Many of the early alternative metal bands originated from Los Angeles. Prominent bands in this genre include Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Faith No More, Helmet, Life of Agony, Rollins Band and Tool. More modern bands include Breaking Benjamin, Chevelle, Godsmack and System of a Down.

===Subgenres of alternative metal===
====Funk metal====
Funk metal is essentially a fusion of heavy metal and funk. It started off in the late eighties as a subgenre of alternative metal and was heavily influenced by bands such as Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone. Funk metal bands often use a conventional riffing style influenced by 1980s thrash metal, unlike bands from other alternative metal genres. During the late-&#x27;90s, many bands which started out as funk metal branched out into more commercially viable genres, such as alternative rock and nu metal. Notable funk metal bands include Living Colour, Infectious Grooves, Mordred, Primus, and Rage Against the Machine. The biggest regional scene during funk metal&#x27;s prime was San Francisco. 
====Nu metal====
Nu metal is a fusion genre that blends alternative metal and groove metal elements with other styles, including grunge, industrial, funk and hip hop. The new metal builds on rap metal&#x27;s rock and rap collaborations, but it highlights some of the more aggressive elements of its musical ancestors. Intense and angry lyrics, off-pitched guitars, and massively amplified beats are typical of new metal songs. The style is mostly syncopated and based on riffs, and is influenced by groove metal rhythm. Some nu metal bands use seven-string guitars, which are sometimes down-tuned to increase heaviness, resulting in bass guitarists using five and six-string instruments. Turntables, sequencers and samplers are sometimes included. Nu metal vocal styles range between melodic singing, rapping, screaming and death growling. The Bakersfield-based Korn became the first band to be labeled as &quot;nu metal&quot;. MTV states that Korn &quot;arrived in 1993 into the burgeoning alternative metal scene, which would morph into nü-metal the way college rock became alternative rock.&quot; Coal Chamber, Linkin Park, Slipknot, Papa Roach, Kittie and Disturbed are prominent bands in this genre.
====Rap metal====
Rap metal bands institute the vocal and lyrical form of hip hop. Examples of rap metal include Crazy Town, Clawfinger, Stuck Mojo, Skindred and Rage Against the Machine. The thrash metal band Anthrax also helped pioneer the genre. Rap metal is often mislabeled as rapcore (a genre which fuses hardcore punk with hip hop) or nu metal, a genre which has similar elements in the music, rap metal usually does not include turntables or sampling into its sound, although keyboards are often used. Rap metal bands, unlike nu metal bands, are almost always fronted by rappers. Rap metal also lacks the melodic singing and growling commonly associated with nu metal.
==Avant-garde metal==
Avant-garde metal or avant-metal, also known as experimental metal, is a subgenre of heavy metal music loosely defined by use of experimentation, and characterized by the use of innovative, avant-garde elements, large-scale experimentation, and the use of non-standard and unconventional sounds, instruments, song structures, playing styles, and vocal techniques. It evolved out of progressive rock, jazz fusion, and extreme metal, particularly death metal. Some local scenes include Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area in the United States, Oslo in Norway, and Tokyo in Japan. Pioneers of experimental metal include Boris, Celtic Frost, Earth, Helmet, Maudlin of the Well, Neurosis, Sunn O))), and Voivod.
==Black metal==
Black metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. Similarly to avant garde metal bands, black metal singers and groups also feature unconventional song structures and lyrical emphasis on atmosphere. Common traits include fast tempos, shrieked vocals, highly distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, blast beat drumming, raw recording, and unconventional song structures.

During the 1980s, several thrash metal bands formed a prototype for black metal. This so-called &quot;first wave&quot; included bands such as Venom, Bathory, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. A &quot;second wave&quot; arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by Norwegian bands such as Mayhem, Burzum, Darkthrone, Immortal, and Emperor. The music of the early Norwegian black metal scene became a distinct genre.

Initially considered a synonym for &quot;Satanic metal&quot;, black metal has often been met with hostility from mainstream culture, mainly due to the misanthropic and anti-Christian standpoint of many artists. Moreover, several of the genre&#x27;s pioneers have been linked with church burnings and murder. Some have also been linked to neo-Nazism; however, most black metal fans and most prominent black metal musicians reject Nazi ideology and oppose its influence on the black metal subculture.

===Derivatives of black metal===
====National Socialist black metal====

NSBM typically melds Neo-Nazi beliefs (such as fascism, white supremacy, white separatism, antisemitism, xenophobia, and homophobia) with hostility to &quot;foreign&quot; religions (Christianity, Judaism, Islam, etc.). Bands often promote ethnic European paganism, occultism, or Satanism. Hendrik Möbus of Absurd described Nazism as the &quot;most perfect (and only realistic) synthesis of Satanic/Luciferian will to power, elitist Social Darwinism, connected to Aryan Germanic paganism&quot;. Members of the band Der Stürmer (named after the antisemitic newspaper edited by Julius Streicher) subscribe to esoteric Hitlerism, leaning on the works of Savitri Devi and Julius Evola.

====Red and Anarchist black metal====
Red and Anarchist black metal, often shortened to the acronym &quot;RABM&quot;, is black metal in which the artists espouse various far-left and environmentalist ideologies such as anarchism, Marxism, and green anarchism. It emerged as an amalgamation of black metal with anarchist crust punk, and typically eschews the traditional Satanic and nihilist lyrics of black metal. While some artists such as Iskra, Panopticon, Puna Terrori and Skagos overtly endorse political agendas and manifestos, others, such as Wolves in the Throne Room and some other Cascadian artists, would not explicitly associate with the red or anarchist label. Other RABM artists include Storm of Sedition, Not A Cost, Black Kronstadt, Crepehanger, Leper, Mutiny, Fauna, and Vidargangr.

====Symphonic black metal====

Symphonic black metal is a style of black metal that incorporates symphonic and orchestral elements. This may include the usage of music workstation keyboards to conjure up &quot;pseudo-orchestral&quot; landscapes with default presets (e.g. strings, choirs, piano, organs, and pads), or full orchestral arrangements containing woodwind, brass, percussion, keyboards and strings. Bands like Carach Angren may feature solo instruments such as violins, in addition to virtual or live orchestral arrangements. Vocals can be &quot;clean&quot; or operatic in style, and song structures are more defined or are inspired by symphonies, albeit not adhering to forms found in Western music (e.g. sonata, rondo, theme and variations) and following a typical riff-based approach. Many of the characteristics of traditional black metal are retained, such as shrieked vocals, fast tempos, high treble gain and tremolo picked electric guitars. But the speed is usually slower, the song structure is clearer, the band uses a lot of keyboards, and even the entire orchestra, just like symphonic metal. Examples of symphonic black metal include Emperor and Dimmu Borgir.

====Viking metal====
Viking metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music with origins in black metal and Nordic folk music, characterized by a common lyrical and thematic focus on Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age. Its musical style is typically manifested as Nordic folk-influenced black metal. Some common traits include a slow-paced and heavy riffing style, anthemic choruses, use of both clean and harsh vocals, a frequent use of folk instrumentation, and, often, the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect. Viking metal developed in the 1980s through the mid-1990s as a rejection of Satanism and the occult, instead embracing the Vikings and paganism as the leaders of opposition to Christianity. Most Viking metal bands originate from the Nordic countries, and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Bathory, from Sweden, is generally credited with pioneering the genre with its albums &quot;Blood Fire Death&quot; (1988) and &quot;Hammerheart &quot;(1990). Enslaved, Burzum, Emperor, Storm and Falkenbach helped further develop the genre in the early through mid-1990s. The death metal bands Unleashed and Amon Amarth, which emerged during the early 1990s, also adopted Viking themes, broadening the genre from its primarily black metal origin. Other key bands in the genre include Darkwoods My Betrothed, Einherjer, Ensiferum, Moonsorrow, Thyrfing, and Windir.
====War metal====

War metal, also known as war black metal or bestial black metal, is an aggressive, cacophonous and chaotic black metal style, described by &quot;Rock Hard&quot; journalist Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann as &quot;rabid&quot; and &quot;hammering&quot;. Important influences include first wave band Sodom and first wave/death metal band Possessed, as well as old grindcore, black, and death metal bands like Repulsion, Autopsy, Sarcófago and the first two Sepultura releases. War metal bands include Blasphemy, Archgoat, Impiety, In Battle, Zyklon-B.

==== Blackgaze ====
Blackgaze is a genre fusion of black metal and shoegaze that originated in the early 2000s. The genre often incorporates heavier elements common of black metal, including blast beat drumming and high-pitched screamed vocals with melodic elements, and heavily distorted &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; guitar styles typically associated with shoegazing. The French shoegazing band Alcest is often credited with having influenced and formed the genre, while American bands such as Deafheaven have become synonymous as to defining the genre&#x27;s characteristics.

====Post-black metal====
Post-black metal is a subgenre of black metal that emphasizes more experimentation and creative expression than other forms, as well as molding different music genres into black metal. Bands such as Deafheaven, Alcest, Liturgy, Deathspell Omega, and Altar of Plagues are notable bands in this genre.

==Christian metal==
Christian metal, also known as white metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity. Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians, sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music, and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks.

Christian metal artists exist in all the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal artists are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the subjects of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive alternative or counterbalance to &#x27;secular&#x27; metal music, which is known for its generally dark and negative message.

Christian metal emerged in the late 1970s as a means of evangelism to the wider heavy metal music scene and was pioneered by American bands Resurrection Band and Petra and Sweden&#x27;s Jerusalem. Los Angeles&#x27;s Stryper achieved wide success in the 1980s. California&#x27;s Tourniquet and Australia&#x27;s Mortification led the movement in the 1990s. Rap metal group P.O.D. and the metalcore groups Underoath, Demon Hunter, As I Lay Dying, and Norma Jean (dubbed by &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine as &quot;The Holy Alliance&quot;) brought some mainstream attention to the movement in the first decade of the 21st century, achieving ranks in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Saving Grace is another example of a Christian metalcore band.

===Derivatives of Christian metal===

==== Christian death metal ====

In the late 1980s and early to mid-1990s, Christian death metal bands also emerged. Incubus (later known as Opprobrium), formed in 1986 in Louisiana, United States by two brothers recently immigrated from Brazil, was Christian and in the late 1980s experimented with a death metal sound. The Melbourne, Australia, groups Mortification and Vomitorial Corpulence, Living Sacrifice and Crimson Thorn, from the United States, and Sympathy, from Canada, were the main progenitors of the Christian death metal.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Norway&#x27;s Extol, Finland&#x27;s Immortal Souls and Deuteronomium, Sweden&#x27;s Pantokrator, Germany&#x27;s Sacrificium, Ukraine&#x27;s Holy Blood, the United States&#x27; Embodyment, Feast Eternal, Possession, Aletheian, Becoming the Archetype, and Tortured Conscience, and Brazil&#x27;s Antidemon all further developed the genre. In the latter half of the 2000s, Impending Doom (from the United States) and Blood Covenant (from India) joined the forefront of Christian death metal.

====Unblack metal====
Unblack metal, sometimes called Christian black metal, is a genre of music that is stylistically black metal, but whose artists promote Christianity in their lyrics and imagery. Such artists are controversial, mainly because black metal&#x27;s pioneers, especially those of the Second Wave, intended to encourage hostility towards Christianity. It is also suggested that Christianity contradicts black metal&#x27;s dark nature, and the individualistic and misanthropic ideals of many bands.

The exact beginning of the Christian black metal movement is disputed. The Australian band Horde&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Hellig Usvart&quot; brought the concept and the term &quot;holy unblack metal&quot; (a word play on Darkthrone&#x27;s slogan &quot;unholy black metal&quot; used on the albums &quot;A Blaze in the Northern Sky&quot; and &quot;Under a Funeral Moon&quot;) to media attention. The Norwegian band Antestor formed in 1990 as a death/doom act and released its demo &quot;The Defeat of Satan&quot; in 1991, before they began shifting towards black metal on their 1994 album &quot;Martyrium&quot;. Other examples of unblack metal bands include Crimson Moonlight, Admonish, and Frosthardr.
==Crust punk==
Crust punk, often simply called crust, is a form of music influenced by anarcho-punk, hardcore punk and extreme metal. The style, which evolved in the mid-1980s in England, often has songs with dark and pessimistic lyrics that linger on political and social ills. The term &quot;crust&quot; was coined by Hellbastard on their 1986 &quot;Ripper Crust&quot; demo.
Crust is partly defined by its &quot;bassy&quot; and &quot;dirty&quot; sound. It is often played at a fast tempo with occasional slow sections. Vocals are usually guttural and may be growled or screamed. Crust punk takes cues from the anarcho-punk aspect of Crass and Discharge, and the extreme metal of bands like Venom and Celtic Frost. Notable crust punk bands include Amebix, Antisect and Doom.
===Derivatives of crust punk===
====Blackened crust====
Crust punk groups, such as Amebix, took some influence from early black metal bands like Venom, Hellhammer, and Celtic Frost. Similarly, Bathory was initially inspired by crust punk, as well as heavy metal. Crust punk was affected by a second wave of black metal in the 1990s, with some bands emphasizing these black metal elements. Iskra are probably the most obvious example of second wave black metal-influenced crust punk; Iskra coined their own phrase &quot;blackened crust&quot; to describe their new style. The Japanese group Gallhammer also fused crust punk with black metal while the English band Fukpig has been said to have elements of crust punk, black metal, and grindcore. In addition, Norwegian band Darkthrone have incorporated crust punk traits in their more recent material. As Daniel Ekeroth wrote in 2008:
==Death metal==
Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. Death metal is characterized by a hard and subdued sound. Guitars and bass are often converted to heavy metal variants to tone down multiple tones, creating an unparalleled dark and mindless sound. It typically employs heavily distorted guitars, tremolo picking, deep growling vocals, blast beat drumming, minor keys or atonality, and complex song structures with multiple tempo changes.

Building from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal emerged during the mid-1980s. Metal acts such as Slayer, Kreator, Celtic Frost, and Venom were very important influences to the crafting of the genre. Possessed and Death, along with bands such as Obituary, Carcass, Deicide and Morbid Angel are often considered pioneers of the genre. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as popular genre niche record labels like Combat, Earache and Roadrunner began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate. Since then, death metal has diversified, spawning a variety of subgenres.
===Derivatives of death metal===
====Blackened death metal====

Blackened death metal is a style that combines death metal and black metal. Examples of blackened death metal bands are Belphegor, Behemoth, Akercocke, Dissection and Sacramentum.

====Death &#x27;n&#x27; roll====
&quot;Death &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; is a term for death metal bands that incorporate rock and roll elements to their overall sound. The term is a blend of &quot;death&quot; metal and rock &quot;&#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;. The achieved effect is that of death metal&#x27;s trademark combination of growled vocals and highly distorted detuned guitar riffing with elements reminiscent of 1970s hard rock and heavy metal. Notable examples include Entombed, Six Feet Under, Gorefest, Helltrain, and Deuteronomium.
====Melodic death metal====
Melodic death metal, also referred to as melodeath or MDM, is a heavy metal music style that combines elements from the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) with elements of death metal. The style was developed during the early and mid-1990s, primarily in England and Scandinavia. The Swedish death metal scene in particular did much to popularize the style, which soon centered in the &quot;Gothenburg metal&quot; scene in Gothenburg, Sweden. Some prominent melodic death metal bands include Amon Amarth, At the Gates, Soilwork, Dark Tranquillity, Arch Enemy, In Flames, and Carcass. Recently, the boundaries of the genre have also become blurred. Melodic death metal is often combined with genres such as avant-garde metal, doomsday metal, flogging metal, or black metal. In the 2000s, the type evolved in many directions.
====Technical death metal====
Technical death metal, often abbreviated to tech death, is characterized by fast, technically complex guitar and drum work, often including sweeping guitar solos. Vocals often adopt the guttural sound of death metal. Some of the first tech death bands include Death, Pestilence, Atheist, Nocturnus, Cynic, Origin and Cephalic Carnage. The music is often dark in nature.
====Symphonic death metal====

Bands described as symphonic death metal include Ex Deo, Necronomicon, Septicflesh, Children of Bodom, Epica, and Fleshgod Apocalypse. Haggard&#x27;s 2000 album, &quot;Awaking the Centuries&quot;, has been described as death metal-styled symphonic metal.

==Doom metal==
Doom metal is an extreme form of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars, and a much &quot;thicker&quot; or &quot;heavier&quot; sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, &quot;Electric Funeral&quot; and &quot;Into the Void&quot;. During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.
===Derivatives of doom metal===

====Death/doom====
Death/doom, sometimes written as death-doom or deathdoom, is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic or depressive mood of doom metal, with the deep growling vocals and double kick drumming of death metal. The genre emerged in the mid-1980s, and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s, but had become less common by the turn of the 21st century. In turn, death/doom gave rise to the closely related genre of funeral doom, as well as to the more melodic and romantic gothic metal. The death/doom genre originated in the mid-1980s when the early progenitors like Dream Death began to mix traditional doom metal with the sounds of thrash and the nascent death metal scene. Early records by such bands as Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride and Anathema combined the sounds of mid-1980s Celtic Frost and Candlemass with the use of female vocals, keyboards and, in the case of My Dying Bride, violins.
====Drone metal====
Drone metal, also known as drone doom, began as a derivative of doom metal and it is largely defined by drones; notes or chords that are sustained and repeated throughout a piece of music. Typically, the electric guitar is performed with large amounts of reverb and feedback, while vocals, if present, are usually growled or screamed. Songs are often very long and lack beat or rhythm in the traditional sense. Drone doom is generally influenced by drone music, noise music and minimalist music. The style emerged in the early 1990s and was pioneered by Earth, Boris and Sunn O))).
====Funeral doom====
Funeral doom is a style of doom metal that crosses death-doom with funeral dirge music. It is played at a very slow tempo and places an emphasis on evoking a sense of emptiness and despair. Typically, electric guitars are heavily distorted, and dark ambient aspects such as keyboards or synthesizers are often used to create a &quot;dreamlike&quot; atmosphere. Vocals consist of mournful chants or growls and are often in the background. Funeral doom was pioneered by Mournful Congregation (Australia), Esoteric (United Kingdom), Evoken (United States), Funeral (Norway), Thergothon (Finland), Skepticism (Finland) and Corrupted (Japan).

====Sludge metal====
Sludge metal began in the early–to–mid–1980s when hardcore punk bands like Black Flag and Flipper began slowing their tempos and incorporating elements of doom metal. This style then spread to Washington, where the Melvins would go on to be described by publications such as &quot;Revolver&quot; as the band that &quot;invented sludge&quot;. By the 1990s, Louisiana developed one of the largest and influential sludge metal scenes, with bands like Acid Bath, Crowbar, Down and Eyehategod. Many sludge bands compose slow and heavy songs that contain brief hardcore passages. However, some bands emphasize fast tempos throughout their music. The string instruments are heavily distorted and are often played with large amounts of feedback to produce an abrasive, sludgy sound. Drumming is often performed in typical doom metal fashion, but drummers may employ hardcore d-beat or double-kick drumming during faster passages. Vocals are usually shouted or screamed, and lyrics are generally pessimistic in nature. Suffering, drug abuse, politics, and anger towards society are common lyrical themes.

====Stoner metal====

Stoner rock or stoner metal is typically slow-to-mid tempo, low-tuned, and bass-heavy. It combines elements of psychedelic rock, blues rock and doom metal, often with melodic vocals and &#x27;retro&#x27; production. The genre emerged during the early 1990s, and was pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. Other prominent stoner metal bands include Acid King and Electric Wizard.
==Extreme metal==

Extreme metal consists of a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s, usually characterized by a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound nearly always associated with genres like black metal, death metal, doom metal, thrash metal, and sometimes speed metal. Extreme Metal music is largely characterised by its sonic extremity. This can be seen in the genre’s utilisation of extreme forms of tempo (both slow and fast), unconventional song structures, sound-scapes of amplified distortion and vocal manipulations, and lyrical themes that include death, violence and the occult.

Folk metal is one of the youngest genres of metal. Folk metal may have originated in 1991 with the British band Skyclad featuring their debut album, The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth.

Extreme metal is by definition a counterculture. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal.

Examples of extreme metal bands include Meshuggah, Cradle of Filth, Celtic Frost, Strapping Young Lad, Dissection, and the first two albums of Venom.

==Folk metal==
Folk metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that developed in Europe during the 1990s. As the name suggests, the genre is a fusion of heavy metal with traditional folk music. This includes the widespread use of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch band Heidevolk, Danish band Sylvatica and Spanish band Stone of Erech).

The earliest example of folk metal was the English band Golgotha, whose 1984 EP &quot;Dangerous Games&quot; contained a mixture of new wave of British heavy metal and folk styles. The genre was not further developed, however, until the emergence of another English band, Skyclad. Their debut album &quot;The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth&quot; was released in 1990. It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe as well as in Israel. Among these early groups, the Irish band Cruachan and the German band Subway to Sally each spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as Celtic metal and medieval metal respectively. Despite their contributions, folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the 1990s. It was not until the early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence, particularly in Finland, with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Moonsorrow.

The music of folk metal is characterized by its diversity, with bands known to perform different styles of both heavy metal music and folk music. A large variety of folk instruments are used in the genre with many bands consequently featuring six or more members in their regular line-ups. A few bands are also known to rely on keyboards to simulate the sound of folk instruments. Lyrics in the genre commonly deal with mythology, history, and nature.

====Celtic metal====
Celtic metal is a subgenre of folk metal that developed in the 1990s in Ireland. As the name suggests, the genre is a fusion of heavy metal music and Celtic music. The early pioneers of the genre were the three Irish bands Cruachan, Primordial and Waylander. The genre has since expanded beyond Irish shores and is known to be performed today by bands from numerous other countries.
====Pirate metal====

Pirate metal is a subgenre of folk metal that blends heavy metal, thrash metal, and sometimes speed metal with pirate mythology, and, commonly, elements of sea shanties. The style was influenced heavily by German heavy metal band Running Wild and its third studio album, &quot;Under Jolly Roger&quot;. Popular Pirate metal bands include Alestorm and Swashbuckle.

====Pagan metal====
Pagan metal is heavy metal music which fuses extreme metal with &quot;the pre-Christian traditions of a specific culture or region through thematic concept, rustic melodies, unusual instruments or archaic languages&quot;, usually referring to folk metal or black metal. The Norwegian band In the Woods... was one of the first bands commonly viewed as pagan metal. Metal Hammer author Marc Halupczok wrote that Primordial&#x27;s song &quot;To Enter Pagan&quot; from the band&#x27;s demo &quot;Dark Romanticism&quot; contributed to defining the genre. Pagan metal bands are often associated with Viking metal and folk metal. Bands such as Moonsorrow and Kampfar have been identified as fitting within all three of those genres.
==Glam metal==
Glam metal (also known as hair metal or pop metal) is the visual style of certain heavy metal bands that arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, particularly on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene. It was popular throughout the 1980s and briefly in the early 1990s, combining the flamboyant look of glam rock and playing a commercial hard rock/heavy metal musical style. The term &quot;Hair bands&quot; was popularized by MTV in the 1990s and derives from the tendency among glam metal acts to style their long hair in a teased-up fashion. Many of the bands donned make-up to achieve an androgynous look, similar to that of some 1970s glam rock acts. Mötley Crüe, Stryper, Bon Jovi, Poison and Ratt are examples of bands who adopted the glam metal look in their stage attire and their music video imagery. Newer bands include Black Veil Brides and Steel Panther.
==Gothic metal==
Gothic metal is characterized as a combination of the dark atmospheres of gothic rock and dark wave with the heaviness of doom metal. The genre originated during the mid-1990s in Europe as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion genre of doom metal and death metal. Pioneers of Gothic metal include Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride and Anathema, all from the North of England. Other pioneers from the first half of the 1990s include Type O Negative from the United States, Tiamat from Sweden and The Gathering from the Netherlands. Examples of gothic metal bands include Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, Anathema, Tiamat, Type O Negative, Moonspell, Theatre of Tragedy, Lacrimosa and Lacuna Coil.
==Grindcore==
Grindcore is a fusion of crust punk, hardcore punk, and thrash metal or death metal. It is characterized by growling vocals, blast beats, and incredibly short songs with lyrics that are often focused on gore and violence, though sometimes the lyrics can be political. Grindcore, in contrast to death metal, is often very chaotic, and lacks the standard use of time signatures. The style was pioneered by the British band Napalm Death in the eighties. Other notable grindcore bands include Brutal Truth, Agoraphobic Nosebleed, and Pig Destroyer.

====Deathgrind====

Deathgrind, sometimes written as death-grind or death/grind, is a musical genre that fuses death metal and grindcore. Deathgrind has been described as &quot;grindcore and brutal death metal colliding head on.&quot; Danny Lilker described deathgrind as &quot;combining the technicality of death metal with the intensity of grindcore.&quot; Death/grind emphasizes overall musical brutality with a specific focus on fast tempos and retains grindcore&#x27;s traditional abruptness. Notable bands include Cattle Decapitation and Misery Index.

====Goregrind====
Goregrind is a subgenre of grindcore and death metal. Early examples of the genre include Repulsion&#x27;s &quot;Horrified&quot;, Impetigo&#x27;s &quot;Ultimo Mondo Cannibale&quot;, and the first two studio albums of Carcass, which defined the genre. In its &quot;Reek of Putrefaction&quot;-era, Carcass used pitch shifters, medical imagery, and, in a deviation from the frequently political or left-wing lyrics commonly used in the hardcore punk and grindcore scenes, gory, anatomical references in its lyrics.

====Pornogrind====

Pornogrind, also known as porno grind, porno-grind or porn grind, is a musical subgenre of grindcore and death metal, which lyrically deals with sexual themes. Natalie Purcell&#x27;s book &quot;Death Metal Music: The Passion and Politics of a Subculture&quot;, suggests that pornogrind is defined solely on the basis of its lyrical content and unique imagery, its focus on pornographic content. Purcell notes that bands like Gut include &quot;simpler, slower, and more rock-like songs&quot;. The artwork for pornogrind bands&#x27; albums is noted for its extreme and potentially offensive nature, which &quot;would keep them out of most stores&quot;. an example of the genre is Cock and Ball Torture.

====Electrogrind====
The 21st century also saw the development of &quot;electrogrind&quot; (or &quot;cybergrind&quot;), practiced by The Berzerker, Body Hammer, Gigantic Brain and Genghis Tron which borrows from electronic music. These groups built on the work of Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Enemy Soil and The Locust, as well as industrial metal. The Berzerker also appropriated the distorted Roland TR-909 kick drums of gabber producers. Many later electrogrind groups were caricatured for their hipster connections.

==Industrial metal==
Industrial metal combines elements of industrial music and heavy metal. It is usually centered around repetitive metal guitar riffs, sampling, synthesizer or sequencer lines, and distorted vocals. Prominent industrial metal groups include Rammstein, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, KMFDM, Fear Factory, Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie and Godflesh.
===Industrial death metal===

Some musicians emerging from the death metal scene, such as Fear Factory, Nailbomb, Autokrator and Meathook Seed, also began to experiment with industrial. Fear Factory, from Los Angeles, were initially influenced by the Earache roster (namely Godflesh, Napalm Death and Bolt Thrower). The German band Oomph!, after their second album &quot;Sperm&quot;, started to play industrial metal combined with elements of death metal and groove metal, until the album &quot;Plastik&quot;. Sepultura singer Max Cavalera&#x27;s Nailbomb, a collaboration with Alex Newport, also practiced a combination of extreme metal and industrial production techniques. A lesser-known example of industrial death metal is Meathook Seed, made up of members of Napalm Death and the Florida death metal group Obituary. An industrial music fan, Obituary guitarist Trevor Peres suggested drum machines for &quot;The End Complete&quot;, Obituary&#x27;s most successful album. The other band members&#x27; refusal led him to form Meathook Seed.

===Industrial black metal===
In the early years of the 21st century, groups from the black metal scene began to incorporate elements of industrial music. Mysticum, formed in 1991, was the first of these groups. The most famous scene was Samel, who went from pure black metal to a sound that breathed industrial air into their album Passage. Industrial Black Metal combines the original black metal vocals with black metal and industrial percussion elements. DHG (Dødheimsgard), Thorns from Norway, and Blut Aus Nord, N.K.V.D. and Blacklodge from France, have been acclaimed for their incorporation of industrial elements.

==Kawaii metal==
At its core, Kawaii metal (also known as idol metal or cute metal) fuses aspects of heavy metal and J-pop, however usually uses elements of power metal mixed with industrial metal keyboards and synthesizers, japanese idol aesthetic and vocals, shredding guitar solos and flashing drums with occasional usage of melodic death metal and post-hardcore unclean vocals and traditional Japanese musical instruments. Kawaii metal grew out of the japanese idol in the late 2000s and early 2010s, being pioneered by bands like Dazzle Vision, Babymetal and Ladybaby.

==Latin metal==

Latin metal is a genre of metal music with Latin origins, influences, and instrumentation, such as Spanish vocals, Latin percussion and rhythm such as Salsa rhythm. Prominent bands in this genre include A.N.I.M.A.L., Ill Niño, Nonpoint, and Soulfly.

==Metalcore==
Metalcore combines heavy metal and hardcore punk. Generally, metalcore guitarists use heavy guitar riffs and solos, drummers frequently use hardcore blast beats and double bass drums, and vocalists use a vocal style which includes death growls and screaming. As with melodic metalcore, some later bands originating in the 21st century combine both harsh and clean vocals. A distinguishing characteristic is the &quot;breakdown&quot;, whereby the song is slowed to half-time, and the guitarists play open strings to achieve the lowest-pitched sound. Prominent metalcore bands include Hatebreed, Bury Your Dead, Killswitch Engage, Architects, While She Sleeps, Bleeding Through, Integrity, Unearth, and Parkway Drive. Original metalcore bands from the 1990s included Earth Crisis, Hatebreed, Integrity and Converge. More modern bands include Killswitch Engage, Underoath, All That Remains, Trivium, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, Asking Alexandria, Shadows Fall, Unearth, Atreyu, and Bleeding Through.

===Subgenres of metalcore===
====Melodic metalcore====
Melodic metalcore is a fusion genre which combines sounds and traits from melodic death metal with hardcore punk, metalcore and occasionally emo. Melodic metalcore bands include Trivium, All That Remains, Atreyu, Bullet for My Valentine, Bury Tomorrow, Darkest Hour, Asking Alexandria, As I Lay Dying, August Burns Red and The Devil Wears Prada.
Melodic metalcore bands have big influences, guitar riffs, and writing styles from Swedish melodic death metal bands, such as At the Gates, Arch Enemy, In Flames and Soilwork. They tend to have strong use of instrumental melody. Many melodic metalcore vocalists use clean singing techniques, as well as growls and screaming. It also can feature harmonic guitar riffs, tremolo picking, double bass drums and metalcore-stylized breakdowns. Some bands also may feature guitar solos. A few of these groups, like Shadows Fall, have some appreciation for 1980s glam metal. Melodic metalcore groups have been described as &quot;embrac[ing] &#x27;80s metal clichés&quot;, such as &quot;inordinate amounts of smoke machines, rippin&#x27; solos, [and] three bass drums.&quot;

====Deathcore====
Deathcore combines elements of death metal with elements of metalcore or hardcore punk, or both. It is defined by an &quot;excessive&quot; use of death metal riffs, blast beats and use of hardcore punk breakdowns. Some prominent bands include the Acacia Strain, Carnifex, Despised Icon, Suicide Silence, Rings of Saturn, Thy Art is Murder, Lorna Shore and Whitechapel.

====Mathcore====
Mathcore is a rhythmically complex and dissonant style of heavy metal and hardcore punk, though many groups draw mainly from metalcore. It has its roots in bands such as Converge, Botch, and The Dillinger Escape Plan. The term &quot;mathcore&quot; is suggested by analogy with math rock. Both math rock and mathcore make use of unusual time signatures. Prominent mathcore groups have been associated with grindcore.
====Electronicore====

Electronicore (also known as synthcore or trancecore) is fusion genre of metalcore with elements of various electronic music genres, such as trance, electronica, and dubstep. The term electronicore is a portmanteau of &quot;electronic&quot; and &quot;metalcore&quot;. Notable artists of this genre have originated from the United Kingdom (Asking Alexandria), the United States (I See Stars, Sky Eats Airplane), Australia, Canada (Abandon All Ships), France, Ukraine (Make Me Famous), Hong Kong (BLAK, Soul Of Ears), Japan (Crossfaith), South Korea (In Your Face), and Malaysia (Sekumpulan Orang Gila).

====Nu metalcore====

Nu metalcore (sometimes referred to as nu metal revival or new nu metal) is the fusion genre of and metalcore that began in the 2000s, and gained popularity in the 2010s. Some of the notable groups have also taken influence from R&amp;B, industrial metal, post-hardcore, and deathcore.

====Progressive metalcore====

Progressive metalcore (also called technical metalcore or ambient metalcore) is a fusion of progressive metal and metalcore, characterized by highly technical lead guitar, &quot;atmospheric&quot; elements, and complex instrumentation.

==Neoclassical metal==
Neoclassical metal, also known as shred metal, is a subgenre that is heavily influenced by classical music in its style of composition. It uses a very technical style of guitar soloing called shred guitar, in which guitarists use crosspicking, sweep picking, and economy picking to play rapid scales and arpeggios. As well, it uses elements borrowed from classical music; including instruments, scales and melodies. Yngwie J. Malmsteen, Tony MacAlpine, and Vinnie Moore are prominent performers in this genre.
==Neue Deutsche Härte==
 (&quot;New German Hardness&quot;) describes a crossover style that is influenced by New German Wave, alternative metal, and groove metal, combining it with elements from industrial, electronica, and techno. The lyrics are generally in German, and &quot;dance metal&quot; is the term most commonly used to describe songs sung in other languages. NDH uses the basic setup of instruments for metal: electric guitar, bass guitar, drums, and vocals, along with keyboard, synthesizers, samples, and occasionally, additional percussion. Emphasis is on a demonstration of predominance, by over-pronouncing certain syllables and letters (such as the uvular or alveolar trill). The vocals are thus dominantly presented in deep, male, and clean voice. Some bands use screaming and death growls, which is also common, being heard in certain songs by Oomph!, Rammstein, Stahlhammer, Samsas Traum and Megaherz. NDH imagery is often strongly masculine, and at times militaristic, depending on the group and the song. Guitars are tuned low, usually to drop D or C, and are generally heavily distorted.

==Post-metal==
This heavy metal movement takes influences from post-rock. While it is, in many aspects, similar to post-rock, post-metal tends to include lower-tuned guitars, distorted guitar(s), heavy atmospherics, gradual evolution of song structure, and a minimal emphasis on vocals. Post-metal stresses emotion, contrasting the ambiance of post-rock with the weight and bombast of metal. Vocals are deemphasized or non-existent, and lyrics tend to be equally abstract — often thematic or philosophical in nature. It is a largely American phenomenon, but also includes some Japanese bands. Bands like Neurosis, Isis, Cult of Luna and Pelican write lengthy songs (typically five or six per album), that can range from light and guitar-driven to heavy and drum and bass-driven.
==Power metal==
Power metal takes influence from heavy metal and speed metal, and often emphasizes clean, melodic, high-pitched vocals, and fast pacing that is mostly driven by double bass drumming and melodic lead guitar. The rhythm guitar is defined by straight power chord progressions. Occasionally, harsh vocals are used, but usually only as backing vocals. Power metal lyrics usually involve fantasy themes. The songs often have a theatrical, epic, and emotionally &quot;powerful&quot; sound. Power metal is generally more upbeat than other metal genres, seeking to empower the listener and inspire joy and courage.

The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s, and refers to two different but related styles: the first, pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later, more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Germany, Finland, Italy and Scandinavia), Latin America (Argentina, Brazil) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. Examples of power metal bands include DragonForce, Blind Guardian, Helloween, Sonata Arctica, Angra, Sabaton, Stratovarius, Kamelot, Rhapsody of Fire, Powerwolf and HammerFall.
==Progressive metal==

Progressive metal is a fusion between progressive rock and heavy metal. It is one of heavy metal&#x27;s more complex genres, due to its use of unusual and dynamic time signatures, long compositions, complex compositional structures, and skilled instrumental playing, where instrumental solos are detailed and extended. However, the latest age of progressive metal has favored rougher lyrics and lower-pitched riff sequences with high amounts of strumming. Vocals, if present, are melodic (though there are a few that use unclean vocals), and lyrics are often philosophical, spiritual, or political. Many bands of the genre were influenced by the progressive rock bands Rush and King Crimson, who would often incorporate elements of heavy metal into their music. Examples of the genre include Queensrÿche, Savatage, Dream Theater, Opeth, Tool, Fates Warning, Mastodon, Gojira and Pain of Salvation.
===Derivatives of progressive metal===

====Djent====

Djent, also known as djent metal, is a musical subgenre that emerged as a spin-off from progressive metal. The word &quot;djent&quot; is an onomatopoeia for a heavily palm-muted, distorted guitar chord. Typically, the word is used to refer to music that makes use of this sound, to the sound itself, or to the scene that revolves around it. Djent as a style has been described as featuring heavily palm-muted, distorted guitar chords alongside virtuoso soloing, and is characterized by rhythmic complexity and palm-muted riffing. Pioneering bands in the style are Born of Osiris, Meshuggah, Periphery, Animals As Leaders, Tesseract, and Textures.
====Progressive metalcore====
Progressive metalcore (also called technical metalcore or ambient metalcore) is a fusion of progressive metal and metalcore characterized by highly technical lead guitar, &quot;atmospheric&quot; elements, and complex instrumentation. Some notable practitioners take influence from djent. Examples of progressive metalcore bands include After the Burial, Erra, Northlane, Invent Animate, and Volumes.

==Speed metal==
Speed metal originated in the late 1970s and early 1980s out of the new wave of British heavy metal, and was the direct musical progenitor of thrash metal. When speed metal first emerged as a genre, it increased the tempos that had been used by early heavy metal bands, while retaining their melodic approaches. Influenced by hardcore punk, speed metal is very fast, abrasive, and technically demanding. Examples of speed metal include Dorsal Atlantica, Venom, Motörhead and Anvil.
==Symphonic metal==
Symphonic metal is a cross-generic style designation for the symphonic subsets of heavy metal music subgenres. It is used to denote any metal band that makes use of symphonic or orchestral elements. Symphonic metal bands can feature classically trained vocalists, in which case they can be attributed nicknames such as opera metal or operatic metal. Examples of symphonic metal include Believer, Therion, Nightwish, Rhapsody of Fire, Epica, Within Temptation, and The Gathering.

==Thrash metal==
Thrash metal is often regarded as the first form of extreme metal. It is generally characterized by its fast tempos, complexity and aggression. Thrash metal guitar playing is most notable for the &quot;chugging&quot; sound it creates through low-pitched palm muted riffs, and high-pitched shred guitar solos. Drummers often use double-kick and double-bass drumming. Vocals are most often shouted or sung in an aggressive manner.

Thrash metal evolved from speed metal, NWOBHM and early hardcore punk at the beginning of the 1980s. Bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax spearheaded thrash metal, and are referred to as the genre&#x27;s &quot;Big Four&quot;, while on the European side, Sodom, Kreator, Destruction, and Tankard form the so-called &quot;Big Teutonic Four&quot;.
===Derivatives of thrash metal===
====Crossover thrash====

Crossover thrash, often abbreviated to &quot;crossover,&quot; and sometimes called also &quot;punk metal,&quot; is a form of thrash metal that contains more hardcore punk elements than standard thrash. The genre lies on a continuum between heavy metal and punk rock. The genre is often confused with thrashcore, which is essentially a faster hardcore punk rather than a more punk-oriented form of metal. Corrosion of Conformity, Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, Stormtroopers of Death and Suicidal Tendencies are major bands in the genre.
====Groove metal====
Groove metal, also known as neo-thrash, post-thrash, or power groove, consists of slow or mid-tempo and down tuned thrash riffs, bluesy guitar solos, greatly emphasized drum work, and harsh vocals that generally consist of screaming, shouting, and raspy singing. Examples of groove metal include Pantera, Exhorder, Lamb of God, Machine Head, DevilDriver, Jinjer, Sepultura and A.N.I.M.A.L.

==Traditional heavy metal==
Traditional heavy metal, also known as classic metal or often simply heavy metal, is the group of bands and artists who play a metal music style similar to the style heard before the genre evolved and splintered into many different styles and subgenres. It is characterized by mid-to-fast-tempo riffs, by thumping basslines, crunchy riffs, extended lead guitar solos, and clean, often high-pitched vocals and anthemic choruses. It is not generally categorized as a subgenre of metal, but the main genre of it. Examples include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Van Halen and Dio.

===New wave of traditional heavy metal===
More recently in the 2010s, the term &quot;new wave of traditional heavy metal&quot; (often abbreviated as NWOTHM) has been used to describe a new wave of bands with a newly found interest in the style, particularly the late 70s and early 80s new wave of British heavy metal variant that has influenced speed metal and power metal; some of these bands are indeed a mixture of these genres while combining more elements of the classical sound, or mimic the style at the time that would soon evolve into them.

Examples of NWOTHM bands include: Helvetets Port, Portrait, Enforcer, Cauldron, White Wizzard, Fury UK, Striker (Ca), Battle Beast, and more recently Seax, Visigoth, Blackslash (De), and Angel Sword.

<doc id="413730" wikidata="Q581195" url="?curid=413730" title="Earl of Wessex">
<text>Earl of Wessex is a title that has been created twice in British history – once in the pre-Conquest Anglo-Saxon nobility of England, and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In the 6th century AD the region of Wessex (the lands of the West Saxons), in the south and southwest of present-day England, became one of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms (one of the components of the so-called Heptarchy); in the tenth century the increasing power of the Kingdom of the West Saxons led to a united Kingdom of England.

== First creation (c. 1019) ==
Wessex was one of the four earldoms of Anglo-Danish England. In this period, the earldom of Wessex covered the lands of the old kingdom of Wessex, covering the counties of the south of England, and extending west to the Welsh border.

During the reign of King Cnut, the earldom was conferred on Godwin at some time after 1020. Thereafter, Godwin rose to become, in King Edward&#x27;s time, the most powerful man in the kingdom. Upon Godwin&#x27;s death in 1053, the earldom passed to his son, who later became King Harold II and died at the Battle of Hastings in 1066; the title became extinct on his death.

==Second creation (1999)==
The current Earl of Wessex is also Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Forfar, and Viscount Severn. This Earl of Wessex title is currently used as a courtesy title by the Duke&#x27;s son and heir apparent to the earldoms of Wessex and Forfar, James Mountbatten-Windsor.

In 1999, Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s youngest son, Prince Edward, married Sophie Rhys-Jones. Younger sons of the monarch have customarily been given dukedoms at the time of their marriage, and experts had suggested the former royal dukedoms of Cambridge and Sussex as the most likely to be granted to Prince Edward. Instead, the Palace announced that Prince Edward would eventually be given the title Duke of Edinburgh, which was at the time held by his father. This did not happen by direct inheritance, as Prince Edward is the youngest of Prince Philip&#x27;s three sons. The title of Duke of Edinburgh was newly created for Prince Edward on 10 March 2023, after it reverted to the Crown following &quot;both the death of the first Duke of Edinburgh, and the second Duke Charles III&#x27;s succession as King.&quot; On Edward’s creation as Duke of Edinburgh on 10 March 2023, Edward&#x27;s son James became styled with the courtesy title of Earl of Wessex, now his father&#x27;s most senior subsidiary title.

At the occasion of his marriage, in keeping with the tradition of a monarch&#x27;s son receiving a title upon marriage, but preserving the rank of duke for the future, Prince Edward became the first British prince in centuries to be specifically created an earl, rather than a duke. His wife Sophie became the Countess of Wessex. &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; newspaper reported that Edward was drawn to the historic title of Earl of Wessex after watching the 1998 film &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, in which a character with the title “Lord Wessex” is played by Colin Firth.

==Line of succession==

* Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh (b. 1964)
** (1) James Mountbatten-Windsor, Earl of Wessex (b. 2007)
== Fictional characters ==
1971 film &quot;Rum Runners&quot; includes a character named &quot;Lord William Percival Hammond, Marquess of Wessex&quot;, played by Clive Revill, a love interest of actress Linda Larue (Brigitte Bardot). During the film, the character introduces himself as “&quot;William Percival Rupert Plantagenet Hammond, 14th Marquess of Wessex, 11th Earl of Shetland, 17th Viscount of Fair Isle&quot;”.

The main antagonist in the 1998 film &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; is named “Lord Wessex” and played by Colin Firth. &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; newspaper reported that Prince Edward was drawn to the title after watching the film.

<doc id="413732" wikidata="Q287893" url="?curid=413732" title="Savannah sparrow">
<text>The Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) is a small New World sparrow that is the only member of the genus Passerculus. It is a widespread and abundant species that occupies open grassland habitats in North America.

Over most of its range it is migratory, breeding in Canada and the northern United States while wintering in Mexico and the southern United States. It is a sexually monomorphic species that is quite variable in appearance. Around 17 subspecies are currently recognised. These are divided into several groups, some of which have sometimes been considered as separate species.

The species name &quot;sandwichensis&quot; is Latin from Sandwich Sound (now Prince William Sound) in southern Alaska from where the first specimen was collected. The common name refers to Savannah, Georgia, where Alexander Wilson observed the species in 1811.

==Taxonomy==
The Savannah sparrow was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the buntings in the genus &quot;Emberiza&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Emberiza sandwichensis&quot;. Gmelin based his text on the &quot;Sandwich bunting&quot; that had been described by John Latham in 1783 and the &quot;Unalasha bunting&quot; that had been described by Thomas Pennant in 1785. Latham and Pennant had access to a specimen owned by the naturalist Joseph Banks that had been collected in May 1778 from Sandwich Sound (now Prince William Sound) in southern Alaska during James Cook&#x27;s third voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The specimen has not survived, but a coloured drawing of the bird made during the voyage by the artist and naturalist William Ellis is now held by the Natural History Museum in London.

The Savannah sparrow is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Passerculus&quot; that was introduced in 1838 by the French naturalist Charles Bonaparte. The English name &quot;Savannah sparrow&quot; was introduced in 1811 by the Scottish-American ornithologist Alexander Wilson in the third volume of his &quot;American Ornithology; or, the Natural History of the Birds of the United States&quot;. Wilson had first seen the species on the coast near Savannah, Georgia.

A 2005 study that compared mitochondrial DNA sequence found that the Ipswich sparrow, formerly usually considered a valid species (as &quot;Passerculus princeps&quot;), was a well-marked subspecies, whereas the southwestern large-billed sparrow was more distinct (&quot;Passerculus rostratus&quot;).

Seventeen subspecies (including the large-billed sparrows) are currently recognized, though many are only described from wintering birds and much of the variation seems to be clinal. Four additional subspecies are no longer generally accepted. The complex is usually divided into several groups:

===Savannah sparrows proper===

All are migratory; wintering ranges overlap widely.
* &quot;P. s. labradorius&quot; Howe, 1901 – breeds in Newfoundland, Labrador, and N Quebec. Includes &quot;P. s. oblitus&quot;.
* &quot;P. s. savanna&quot; (Wilson, A, 1811) – (eastern Savannah sparrow), breeds in the northeast US and adjacent Canada (includes &quot;P. s. mediogriseus&quot;)
* &quot;P. s. sandwichensis&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – (Aleutian Savannah sparrow), breeds on the Aleutian Islands and west Alaskan Peninsula
* &quot;P. s. anthinus&quot; Bonaparte, 1853 – breeds in the remainder of Alaska, south and east to central British Columbia and north of the Great Plains to Manitoba. Includes &quot;P. s. crassus&quot;.
* &quot;P. s. brooksi&quot; Bishop, 1915 – (dwarf Savannah sparrow), breeds in southernmost British Columbia to northernmost California
* &quot;P. s. alaudinus&quot; Bonaparte, 1853 – breeds in coastal northern and central California
* &quot;P. s. nevadensis&quot; Grinnell, 1910 – breeds in the northern Great Plains and the Great Basin
* &quot;P. s. brunnescens&quot; (Butler, AW, 1888) – breeds from central Mexico south to Guatemala (includes &quot;P. s. rufofuscus&quot;)
* &quot;P. s. wetmorei&quot; Van Rossem, 1938 – a doubtful subspecies that may breed in the mountains of Guatemala. It is known from only five specimens, collected June 11–17, 1897, in Huehuetenango Department.

==Ipswich sparrow==
Some post-breeding dispersal. Formerly considered as a distinct species.
* &quot;P. s. princeps&quot; Maynard, 1872 – breeds almost exclusively on Sable Island which lies southeast of Nova Scotia in the North Atlantic Ocean.
:The Ipswich sparrow is somewhat larger and paler in color than other eastern Savannah sparrows. The breast streaks are narrower and pale brown. Some birds overwinter on the island; others migrate south along the Atlantic coast, usually departing later and returning sooner than mainland birds. Some birds interbreed with &quot;P. s. savanna&quot; in Nova Scotia. These birds frequently raise three broods in a year. This bird was first observed in winter on the dunes near the town of Ipswich, Massachusetts.

===Large-billed sparrows===
The large-billed sparrows proper is sometimes treated as a separate species. There are two dark, large and strong-billed subspecies:
* &quot;P. s. rostratus&quot; (Cassin, 1852) – breeds on the Gulf Coast of northeast Baja California and northwest Sonora (some post-breeding dispersal).
* &quot;P. s. atratus&quot; Van Rossem, 1930 – resident on the coast of central Sonora to central Sinaloa (resident)

Belding&#x27;s (Savannah/large-billed) sparrows are all-year residents of salt marshes of the Californian Pacific coast. They are dark, rufous, and have rather long but not very hefty bills. This group has been considered as a separate species.
* &quot;P. s. beldingi&quot; Ridgway, 1885 – resident on the Pacific coast from Morro Bay, California, to El Rosario, Baja California (includes &quot;P. r./s. bryanti&quot;)
* &quot;P. s. anulus&quot; Huey, 1930 – resident around Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay, Baja California
* &quot;P. s. guttatus&quot; Lawrence, 1867 – resident around San Ignacio Lagoon
* &quot;P. s. magdalenae&quot; Van Rossem, 1947 – resident around Magdalena Bay

San Benito (Savannah/large-billed) sparrow is a resident bird of the Islas San Benito off Baja California; a stray bird was observed on Cedros Island on April 21, 1906. It has been considered as a separate species.
* &quot;P. s. sanctorum&quot; Coues, 1884
:This is a large-bodied and large-billed subspecies, similar to &quot;rostratus&quot;. They utilize different habitat and their breeding season does not seem to coincide with that of Belding&#x27;s sparrows. However, their bill size is due to convergent evolution and their habitat choice simply to the lack of alternatives on their barren island home; altogether, it appears to be a fairly recent offshoot from the Belding&#x27;s sparrows group. It appears as distinct evolutionarily from these as does the Ipswich sparrow from the Savannah sparrow proper group, only that there seems to have been more gene flow and/or a larger founder population in the case of the latter.

==Description==
The Savannah sparrow has a typically sparrow-like dark-streaked brown back, and whitish underparts with brown or blackish breast and flank streaking. It has whitish crown and supercilium stripes, sometimes with some yellow (more often near the beak). The cheeks are brown and the throat white. The flight feathers are blackish-brown with light brown or white border. The eyes are dark. The feet and legs are horn-colored, as is the lower part of the bill, with the upper part being dark grey.

It is a very variable species, with numerous subspecies, several of which have been split as separate species at various times. The different forms vary principally in the darkness of the plumage. The variation generally follows Gloger&#x27;s rule, with Alaskan and interior races the palest, and southwestern coastal forms the darkest. There are some exceptions, though, most conspicuously in some island populations that presumably were strongly affected by founder effects. The general pattern of variation has a fairly clear divide, southwest of which the birds become notably darker; this agrees quite well with the limit between &quot;P. sandwichensis&quot; and &quot;P. (s.) rostratus&quot;. Savannah sparrows show some variation in size across subspecies. The total length can range from , wingspan ranges from and body mass from . In the nominate subspecies, the body weight averages .

The Savannah sparrows proper (see below) are very similar, and migrant birds can not usually be related to a breeding population with certainty. The resident or partially migratory subspecies are well distinguishable by size and, particularly between groups, coloration.

==Distribution and habitat==
This passerine bird breeds in Alaska, Canada, northern, central and Pacific coastal United States, Mexico and Guatemala. The Pacific and Mexican breeders are resident, but other populations are migratory, wintering from the southern United States across Central America and the Caribbean to northern South America. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

==Behavior==

These birds forage on the ground or in low bushes; particularly in winter they are also found in grazed low-growth grassland. They mainly eat seeds, but also eat insects in the breeding season. They are typically encountered as pairs or family groups in the breeding season, and assemble in flocks for the winter migration. The flight call is a thin &quot;seep&quot;. &quot;Sensu lato&quot;, the Savannah sparrow is considered a threatened species by the IUCN. The song is mixture of &quot;chirps&quot; and trills.

<text>Edgar Charles &quot;Sam&quot; Rice (February 20, 1890 – October 13, 1974) was an American pitcher and outfielder in Major League Baseball. Although Rice made his debut as a relief pitcher, he is best known as an outfielder. Playing for the Washington Senators from until , he was regularly among the American League leaders in runs scored, hits, stolen bases and batting average. He led the Senators to three postseasons and a World Series championship in 1924. He batted left-handed but threw right-handed. Rice played his final year, , for the Cleveland Indians. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963.

Rice was best known for making a controversial catch in the 1925 World Series which carried him over the fence and into the stands. While he was alive, Rice maintained a sense of mystery around the catch, which had been ruled an out. He wrote a letter that was only opened after his 1974 death; it claimed that he had maintained possession of the ball the entire time. He collected nearly 3,000 hits in his career, with his 2,889 as a Senator being the most in franchise history.

==Early life==
Rice was the first of six children born to Charles Rice and Louisa Newmyer. Charles and Louisa married about two months after his birth. He grew up in various towns near Morocco, Indiana, on the Indiana-Illinois border, and considered Morocco his hometown. He was known as &quot;Eddie&quot; during his childhood. In 1908, Rice married 16-year-old Beulah Stam. They lived in Watseka, Illinois, where Rice ran the family farm, worked at several jobs in the area, and attended tryouts for various professional baseball teams.

By April 1912, Rice and his wife had two children, aged 18 months and three years. While Rice&#x27;s wife cared for the children, Rice traveled to Galesburg, Illinois, to play for a spot on a minor league baseball team, the Galesburg Pavers of the Central Association. Rice spent about a week with the team, appearing in three exhibition games. In an appearance on April 21, Rice entered the game as a relief pitcher and finished the last three innings of a Pavers victory, giving up one run in a game marked by forceful winds.

That same day, Rice&#x27;s wife took their children on a day trip to the homestead of Rice&#x27;s parents in Morocco, about 20 miles from Watseka. A storm arose and a tornado swept across the homestead, destroying the house and most of the outbuildings. The tornado killed Rice&#x27;s wife, his two children, his mother, his two younger sisters and a farmhand. Rice&#x27;s father survived for another week before also succumbing to his injuries. Rice had to attend two funerals: one for his parents and sisters, and a second for his wife and children.

Rice played for the Muscatine Muskies of the Central Association in 1912, hitting .194 in 18 games. He did not play in 1913.

==Early baseball career==
Perhaps wracked with grief, Rice spent the next year wandering the area and working at several jobs. In 1913, he joined the United States Navy and served on the , a 16,000-ton battleship that was large enough to field a baseball team. Rice played on that team during one season. He was on the ship when it took part in the United States occupation of Veracruz, Mexico.

In 1914, Rice joined the Petersburg Goobers of the Virginia League as a pitcher. He compiled a 9–2 record with a 1.54 earned run average (ERA) that year, then returned in 1915, earning an 11-12 record with a 1.82 ERA. Petersburg team owner &quot;Doc&quot; Leigh owed a $300 debt to Clark Griffith, who owned the major-league Washington Senators at the time, and he offered Rice&#x27;s contract to Griffith in payment of the debt. Leigh is credited with two acts which influenced Rice&#x27;s subsequent career: he changed the player&#x27;s name from &quot;Edgar&quot; to &quot;Sam&quot;, and he convinced the Senators to let Rice play in the outfield instead of pitching.

==Major league career==

===First MLB seasons===

Rice played 19 of his 20 seasons with the Washington Senators. He appeared in only 62 total major league games in 1915 and 1916. He played 155 games in 1917, registering a .302 batting average in 656 plate appearances. Rice was recalled up to the army in 1918. He joined the 68th Coast Artillery Regiment and was stationed at Fort Terry in New York. He appeared with the Senators in a few games during two furloughs. By September, his company was sent to France and they prepared for combat, but the men did not see any action before the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

In 1919, Rice played in 141 games and hit .321, one of 13 seasons in which he hit at least .300. He hit .338 in 1920, recorded a league-leading and career-high 63 stolen bases and was caught stealing a league-high 30 times. In 1921, he hit 13 triples, the first of ten consecutive seasons in which he finished in double digits in that category. He collected a league-high 216 hits in 1924, which culminated in Rice and the Senators winning the 1924 World Series in a dramatic 7 game series against the New York Giants. Though not the league leader in 1925, Rice recorded a career-high 227 hits, 87 RBI, and a .350 batting average, career highs among his full seasons.

===The catch===
The most famous moment in Rice&#x27;s career came on defense. In Game 3 of the 1925 World Series, the Senators were leading the Pittsburgh Pirates, 4–3. In the middle of the 8th inning, Rice was moved from center field to right field. With two out in the top of the inning, Pirate catcher Earl Smith drove a ball to right-center field. Rice ran the ball down and appeared to catch it at the fence, robbing Smith of a home run that would have tied the game. After the catch, Rice toppled over the fence and into the stands, disappearing from sight. When Rice reappeared, he had the ball in his glove and the umpire called Smith out. The umpire&#x27;s explanation was that as soon as the catch was made the play was over, so it did not matter where Rice ended up. His team lost the Series in seven games.

Controversy persisted over whether Rice had actually caught the ball and whether he had kept possession of it. Some Pittsburgh fans sent signed and notarized documents claiming that they saw a fan pick up the ball and put it back in Rice&#x27;s glove. Rice himself would not tell, answering only, &quot;The umpire said I caught it.&quot; Magazines offered to pay him for the story, but Rice turned them down, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t need the money. The mystery is more fun.&quot; He would not even tell his wife or his daughter. The controversy became so great that Rice wrote a letter when he was selected to the Hall of Fame, to be opened upon his death. After Rice&#x27;s death, a Hall of Fame official located the letter describing his World Series play and delivered it to Rice’s family. It was opened and read after his funeral. In an interview, his wife Mary said, &quot;He did catch it. You don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore.&quot; The letter concluded by stating, &quot;At no time did I lose possession of the ball.&quot;

===Later career===
Leading the league in hits again in 1926, Rice finished fourth in the Most Valuable Player Award voting. His batting average dipped to .297 in 1927, but he hit .328, .323 and .349 from, respectively, the 1928 through 1930 seasons. Though Rice hit .310 in 1931 across 120 games, Dave Harris got significant playing time when the team was facing lefthanded pitchers. The Senators also began to explore younger players for their outfield spots.

The Senators held &quot;Sam Rice Day&quot; in late 1932, where the team presented him with several gifts, including a check for more than $2,200 and a new Studebaker automobile. He played only 106 games that year, often appearing as a pinch hitter. In 1933, the team returned to the World Series. Though the team lost, Rice batted once in the second game, picking up a pinch hit single. The Senators released him after the season.

He played in 1934 with the Cleveland Indians, then retired at the age of 44. Cleveland manager Walter Johnson talked to Rice about returning in 1935, but Rice refused. Rice retired with a .322 career average. He stood erect at the plate and used quick wrists to slash pitches to all fields. He never swung at the first pitch and seldom struck out, once completing a 616-at-bat season (1929) with nine strikeouts. Rice struck out only 275 times in 9,269 at-bats, or once every 33.71 at-bats, making him the 11th all-time most difficult MLB player to strike out. He recorded six 200-hit seasons in the major leagues. As the ultimate contact man with the picture-perfect swing, Rice was never a home run threat, but his speed often turned singles into doubles, and his 1920 stolen base total of 63 earned him the timely nickname &quot;Man o&#x27; War&quot;.

With 2,987 hits, Rice has the most hits of any player not to reach 3,000. Rice later said, &quot;The truth of the matter is I did not even know how many hits I had. A couple of years after I quit, [Senators owner] Clark Griffith told me about it, and asked me if I&#x27;d care to have a comeback with the Senators and pick up those 13 hits. But I was out of shape, and didn&#x27;t want to go through all that would have been necessary to make the effort. Nowadays, with radio and television announcers spouting records every time a player comes to bat, I would have known about my hits and probably would have stayed to make 3,000 of them.&quot; In postseason play, Rice produced 19 hits and a .302 batting average.

==Career statistics==
See:&quot;Career Statistics&quot; for a complete explanation.

Rice accumulated 7 five-hit games and 52 four-hit games in his career.

==Later life==
By the 1940s, Rice had become a poultry farmer. His farm was located in Olney, Maryland next to that of Harold L. Ickes, the United States Secretary of the Interior. Rice and Ickes employed several workers of Japanese descent who were displaced from the West Coast by order of the U.S. Army after the outbreak of World War II.

Rice was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963. He and three other players – John Clarkson, Elmer Flick and Eppa Rixey – were elected unanimously that year by the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Veterans Committee, which considered players who had been inactive for 20 or more years. Rice said that he was glad to be inducted and said that he thought he would probably be elected if he survived long enough.

Rice remarried twice, first to Edith and at age 69 to Mary Kendall Adams. Mary had two daughters by a prior marriage, Margaret and Christine. In 1965, Rice and his family were interviewed in advance of a program to honor his career. The interviewer asked Rice about the tornado, and as he told of the storm and its destruction, his wife and children learned for the first time of the existence of his previous family.

Rice made one of his last public appearances at the Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremonies honoring Whitey Ford and Mickey Mantle in August 1974. He died of cancer that year on October 13. He was buried in Woodside Cemetery in Brinklow, Maryland.

<doc id="413739" wikidata="Q1562548" url="?curid=413739" title="Michael Powell (lobbyist)">
<text>Michael Kevin Powell (born March 23, 1963) is an American attorney and lobbyist who served as the 24th chairman of the Federal Communications Commission from 2001 to 2005. Since leaving office, Powell has worked as the president of the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association (NCTA), a broadband industry trade association.

Powell was appointed to the FCC by President Bill Clinton on November 3, 1997, and was chosen by President George W. Bush to serve as chairman of the commission on January 22, 2001. Powell is the son of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and his wife Alma Powell.

== Early life and education ==
Michael Kevin Powell was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on March 23, 1963, the first child of Colin and Alma (née Johnson) Powell. Because of his father&#x27;s military career, Michael grew up in various places in the U.S., including Dale City, Virginia; Fort Campbell, Kentucky; and Burke, Virginia, graduating from Lake Braddock High School in Burke in 1981. He graduated from the College of William &amp; Mary, where he was initiated into Theta Delta Chi, on an ROTC Scholarship. Powell later received a Juris Doctor from the Georgetown University Law Center

== Career ==
Powell served as an armor officer in the United States Army. He spent the majority of his active service with the 3rd Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in Amberg, Germany, serving as a cavalry platoon leader and troop executive officer. In 1987, Powell was seriously injured during a training mission. He and his unit were traveling in a convoy on the autobahn. Powell was riding in a jeep at the time. Due to heavy rain, the jeep crashed and Powell was ejected from the vehicle. After he hit the pavement, the jeep bounced and crashed down on Powell&#x27;s midsection.

After his rehabilitation he served as an expert advisor to the Secretary of Defense. and clerked for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. He then worked for a year and a half as a private attorney in the Washington, D.C., office of O’Melveny &amp; Myers. From 1996, Powell served in the Clinton Administration as chief of staff of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division.

== Federal Communications Commission ==
As the chairman of the FCC, Powell led the charge to open up markets in VoIP, Wi-Fi, and Broadband over Powerline (BPL). His approach believed that these new communications technologies would allow small companies to take on established corporations, and that regulations often stood in the way of progress. Powell&#x27;s deregulatory policy coincided with a period of significant consolidation in the communications market. He advocated an updating of media ownership rules to reflect new communications technologies such as the Internet, a move that critics derided as increasing rampant media consolidation.

During his tenure as chair, he spoke at the University of California, San Diego on January 26, 2004. In the talk, Powell spoke about the policymaking process in Washington, and about how ultra-wideband might impact telecommunications. While at the FCC, Powell was also the FCC&#x27;s defense commissioner and oversaw all National Security Emergency Preparedness functions for the Commission.

Powell opposed applying telephone-era regulations to new Internet technologies, a move critics charged would deny open access to communications facilities. He articulated a policy of network neutrality, and in March 2005 fined Madison River Communications for blocking voice over IP applications, the first-ever government action of its kind. Powell worked so consumers could keep phone numbers when switching wireless carriers and championed the National Do Not Call Registry.

In a notable confrontation over the FCC&#x27;s local telephone competition rules, Powell was outflanked by Republican Kevin Martin, who formed a majority with the FCC&#x27;s two Democratic commissioners. Powell was later vindicated by a D.C. Circuit Court decision on March 2, 2004, that struck down Martin&#x27;s order. Three months later, the U.S. Supreme Court let the D.C. Circuit decision stand. When Powell resigned, Kevin Martin, who served Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign in Florida, was named the FCC&#x27;s new Chairman. Martin subsequently purged the FCC of many of Powell&#x27;s staff.

Some of Powell&#x27;s initiatives were challenged in federal court. Notably, the FCC&#x27;s BrandX cable modem service decision, which declared cable modem should be free from telephone service regulations, was overturned in the Ninth Circuit case but was reinstated by the Supreme Court. The FCC&#x27;s Broadcast Flag proceeding was overturned by the D.C. Circuit Court as an inappropriate exercise of FCC jurisdiction. The FCC&#x27;s Media Ownership rules were likewise blocked by federal court and the television ownership cap set directly by the U.S. Congress.

=== Super Bowl XXXVIII controversy ===
A defining moment of his tenure as FCC chairman was the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, in which Janet Jackson&#x27;s breast was exposed on live-broadcast television. This high-profile incident increased public attention toward the FCC&#x27;s enforcement of indecency rules, which had already stepped up following Bono&#x27;s use of an expletive on live TV. Powell himself later said that the controversy was overblown, although he recognized that it would cause concern when he saw it at a Super Bowl party.

In an interview with &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot;, he stated, &quot;I think we’ve been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and my job is to enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we’re gonna do?&quot; In the aftermath, the FCC processed hundreds times more complaints than they had ever received.

=== Approach to indecency ===
Howard Stern and other controversial on-air personalities felt the sting of record fines, and both the U.S. House and Senate separately approved legislation significantly increasing the amount of money a station could be fined for indecency. Although the legislation was not ultimately enacted, the climate in Washington became so grey that several TV stations across the country declined to air &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; on Veterans Day for fear of FCC fines. Powell was interviewed on San Francisco talk radio station KGO (AM) when Stern called in to confront Powell. Stern questioned Powell&#x27;s credentials, saying he got the job only because of his father and accused Powell of targeting him and fining him large amounts of money.

== Post-FCC work ==
Powell resigned as chairman of the FCC on January 21, 2005. He said that he was glad to spend more time with his wife. In March 2006, Powell became a member of the board of trustees, for the RAND Corporation. He served two terms as a member of the Board of Visitors at his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the College of William and Mary, from 2002 to 2009. On April 21, 2006, Powell was elected the Rector of the Board of Visitors, making him the first African-American to serve in that post in the College&#x27;s 313-year history. He served as rector for two terms, stepping down on July 1, 2009.

=== Political activity ===
Described as a &quot;moderate Republican&quot;, Powell has been involved with Republican political campaigns. In the 1990s, Powell urged his father, Colin Powell, to run for President. During the 2008 presidential election, Powell advised and supported Republican nominee John McCain, while his father supported Democratic nominee Barack Obama.

In 2012, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; speculated that Powell was considering a candidacy for Mayor of the District of Columbia in the 2014 election, though he declined to enter the race. In 2013, Powell was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case.

=== Lobbying and net neutrality ===
On March 15, 2011, the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association (NCTA) announced that Powell would take the helm from Kyle McSlarrow beginning April 25. Powell left his advisory role with Providence Equity Partners. In 2012, he spoke with FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski and gave the keynote speech during the industry&#x27;s Cable Show. In April 2012, he contributed an opinion piece to &quot;Politico&quot; about the importance of cyber threats.

As a lobbyist representing the telecommunications companies, Powell published numerous editorials and opinion pieces around the country claiming to support net neutrality and opposing the FCC&#x27;s enforcement of net neutrality through broadband reclassification as a Title II service.

== Personal life ==
Powell married Jane Knott in 1988; they have two children. While serving as a junior army officer in Germany, Powell suffered serious injuries in a Jeep accident. Half of Powell&#x27;s pelvis had snapped off its rear anchor on the lower spine. In the front, it had ripped free of the cartilage connecting it to its other half. His bladder and urethra were torn and several vertebrae were cracked. After initial attention from German emergency room doctors, Powell was flown to a U.S. Army hospital in Nuremberg. After being stabilized, he was flown to Washington, D.C., and admitted to Walter Reed Army Medical Center where he spent a year in recovery. His spine remained fused at its base, forcing him to walk with a slight forward pitch the rest of his life.

<text>In music, ear training is the study and practice in which musicians learn various aural skills to detect and identify pitches, intervals, melody, chords, rhythms, solfeges, and other basic elements of music, solely by hearing. Someone who can identify pitch accurately without any context is said to have perfect pitch, while someone who can only identify pitch provided a reference tone or other musical context is said to have relative pitch. Someone that can&#x27;t perceive these qualities at all is said to be tone deaf. The application of this skill is somewhat analogous to taking dictation in written/spoken language. As a process, ear training is in essence the inverse of reading music, which is the ability to decipher a musical piece by reading musical notation. Ear training is typically a component of formal musical training and is a fundamental, essential skill required in music schools and the mastery of music.

== Functional pitch recognition ==

Functional pitch recognition involves identifying the function or role of a single pitch in the context of an established tonic. Once a tonic has been established, each subsequent pitch may be classified without direct reference to accompanying pitches. For example, once the tonic G has been established, listeners may recognize that the pitch D plays the role of the dominant in the key of G. No reference to any other pitch is required to establish this fact.

Many musicians use functional pitch recognition in order to identify, understand, and appreciate the roles and meanings of pitches within a key. To this end, scale-degree numbers or movable-&quot;do&quot; solmization (&quot;do, re, mi,&quot; etc.) can be quite helpful. Using such systems, pitches with identical functions (the key note or tonic, for example) are associated with identical labels (&quot;1&quot; or &quot;do,&quot; for example).

Functional pitch recognition is not the same as fixed-&quot;do&quot; solfège, e.g. &quot;do, re, mi&quot;, etc. Functional pitch recognition emphasizes the role of a pitch with respect to the tonic, while fixed-&quot;do&quot; solfège symbols are labels for absolute pitch values (&quot;do&quot;=C, &quot;re&quot;=D, etc., in any key). In the fixed-&quot;do&quot; system (used in the conservatories of the Romance language nations, e.g. Paris, Madrid, Rome, as well as the Juilliard School and the Curtis Institute in the USA), solfège symbols do not describe the role of pitches relative to a tonic, but rather actual pitches. In the movable-do system, there happens to be a correspondence between the solfège symbol and a pitch&#x27;s role. However, there is no requirement that musicians associate the solfège symbols with the scale degrees. In fact, musicians may utilize the movable-&quot;do&quot; system to label pitches while mentally tracking intervals to determine the sequence of solfège symbols.

Functional pitch recognition has several strengths. Since a large body of music is tonal, the technique is widely applicable. Since reference pitches are not required, music may be broken up by complex and difficult to analyze pitch clusters, for example, a percussion sequence, and pitch analysis may resume immediately once an easier to identify pitch is played, for example, by a trumpet—no need to keep track of the last note of the previous line or solo nor any need to keep track of a series of intervals going back all the way to the start of a piece. Since the function of pitch classes is a key element, the problem of compound intervals with interval recognition is not an issue—whether the notes in a melody are played within a single octave or over many octaves is irrelevant.

Functional pitch recognition has some weaknesses. Music with no tonic or ambiguous tonality does not provide the frame of reference necessary for this type of analysis. When dealing with key changes, a student must know how to account for pitch function recognition after the key changes: retain the original tonic or change the frame of reference to the new tonic. This last aspect in particular, requires an ongoing real-time (even anticipatory) analysis of the music that is complicated by modulations and is the chief detriment to the movable-do system.

== Interval recognition ==
Interval recognition is also a useful skill for musicians: in order to determine the notes in a melody, a musician must have some ability to recognize intervals. Some music teachers teach their students relative pitch by having them associate each possible interval with the first two notes of a popular song. However, others have shown that such familiar-melody associations are quite limited in scope, applicable only to the specific scale-degrees found in each melody.

In addition, there are various systems (including solfeggio, sargam, and numerical sight-singing) that assign specific syllables to different notes of the scale. Among other things, this makes it easier to hear how intervals sound in different contexts, such as starting on different notes of the same scale.

== Chord recognition ==
Complementary to recognizing the melody of a song is hearing the harmonic structures that support it. Musicians often practice hearing different types of chords and their inversions out of context, just to hear the characteristic sound of the chord. They also learn chord progressions to hear how chords relate to one another in the context of a piece of music.

== Microtonal chord and interval recognition ==

The process is similar to twelve-tone ear training, but with many more intervals to distinguish. Aspects of microtonal ear training are covered in &quot;Harmonic Experience&quot;, by W. A. Mathieu, with sight-singing exercises, such as singing over a drone, to learn to recognize just intonation intervals. There are also software projects underway or completed geared to ear training or to assist in microtonal performance.

Gro Shetelig at The Norwegian Academy of Music is working on the development of a Microtonal Ear Training method for singers and has developed the software Micropalette, a tool for listening to microtonal tones, chords and intervals. Aaron Hunt at Hi Pi instruments has developed Xentone, another tool for microtonal ear training. Furthermore, Reel Ear Web Apps have released a Melodic Microtone Ear Training App based on call and response dictations.

== Rhythm recognition ==

One way musicians practise rhythms is by breaking them up into smaller, more easily identifiable sub-patterns. For example, one might start by learning the sound of all the combinations of four eighth notes and eighth rests, and then proceed to string different four-note patterns together.

Another way to practise rhythms is by muscle memory, or teaching rhythm to different muscles in the body. One may start by tapping a rhythm with the hands and feet individually, or singing a rhythm on a syllable (e.g. &quot;ta&quot;). Later stages may combine keeping time with the hand, foot, or voice and simultaneously tapping out the rhythm, and beating out multiple overlapping rhythms.

A metronome may be used to assist in maintaining accurate tempo.

== Timbre recognition ==
Each type of musical instrument has a characteristic sound quality that is largely independent of pitch or loudness. Some instruments have more than one timbre, e.g. the sound of a plucked violin is different from the sound of a bowed violin. Some instruments employ multiple manual or embouchure techniques to achieve the same pitch through a variety of timbres. If these timbres are essential to the melody or function, as in shakuhachi music, then pitch training alone will not be enough to fully recognize the music. Learning to identify and differentiate various timbres is an important musical skill that can be acquired and improved by training.

== Transcription ==
Music teachers often recommend transcribing recorded music as a way to practise all of the above, including recognizing rhythm, melody and harmony. The teacher may also perform (&#x27;dictate&#x27;) short compositions, with the pupil listening and transcribing them on to paper.

== Modern training methods ==
For accurate identification and reproduction of musical intervals, scales, chords, rhythms, and other audible parameters a great deal of practice is often necessary. Exercises involving identification often require a knowledgeable partner to play the passages in question and to assess the answers given. Specialised music theory software can remove the need for a partner, customise the training to the user&#x27;s needs and accurately track progress. Conservatories and university music departments often license commercial software for their students, such as Meludia, EarMaster, Auralia, and MacGAMUT, so that they can track and manage student scores on a computer network. Similar data tracking software such as MyMusicianship and SonicFit focus on ear training for singers and are licensed by schools and community choirs. A variety of free software also exists, either as browser-based applications or as downloadable executables. For example, free and open source software under the GPL, such as GNU Solfege, often provides many features comparable with those of popular proprietary products. Most ear-training software is MIDI-based, permitting the user to customise the instruments used and even to receive input from MIDI-compatible devices such as electronic keyboards. Interactive ear-training applications are also available for smartphones.

<text>The lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus) is a fairly large New World sparrow. It is the only member of the genus &quot;Chondestes&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds in southern Canada, much of the United States, and northern Mexico. It is much less common in the east, where its range is contracting. The populations in Mexico and adjacent states of the United States are resident, but other birds are migratory, wintering in the southern United States, Mexico and south to Guatemala.

It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe, with two accepted records in Great Britain in 1981 and 1991.

==Description==
The lark sparrow is distinctive. Adults have a typically sparrow-like dark-streaked brown back, and white underparts except for a dark central spot. The cheeks and crown sides are chestnut, with white eyebrow and crown stripes. The dark tail&#x27;s corners are also white. Young lark sparrows are duller, and the underparts are streaked.

Measurements:

* Length: 5.9–6.7 in (15–17 cm)
* Weight: 0.8–1.2 oz (24–33 g)
* Wingspan: 11.0 in (28 cm)

==Diet and behaviour==
They forage on the ground or in low bushes. They mainly eat seeds, but insects, including grasshoppers, are also eaten in the breeding season. They form flocks on migration or in winter. When an occupied nest is approached by a predator, adult female lark sparrows are known to exhibit a distraction display.

==Breeding==
The breeding habitat is a variety of open habitats including grasslands and cultivation. Lark sparrows nest on the ground, laying three to six eggs in a grass cup nest sheltered by a clump of grass or other vegetation. The eggs are white with black scrawling. Lark sparrows are occasional victims of brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird.

==Call==
The song is two clear notes followed by a mixture of buzzes and trills. The flight call is a thin &quot;sit&quot;.

<text>Hinglish is the macaronic hybrid use of English and Hindi. Its name is a portmanteau of the words &quot;Hindi&quot; and &quot;English&quot;. In the context of spoken language, it involves code-switching or translanguaging between these languages whereby they are freely interchanged within a sentence or between sentences.

In the context of written language, Hinglish colloquially refers to Romanized Hindi — Hindustani written in English alphabet (that is, using Roman script instead of the traditional Devanagari or Nastaliq), often also mixed with English words or phrases.

The word &quot;Hinglish&quot; was first recorded in 1967. Other colloquial portmanteau words for Hindustani-influenced English include: &quot;Hindish&quot; (recorded from 1972), &quot;Hindlish&quot; (1985), &quot;Henglish&quot; (1993) and &quot;Hinlish&quot; (2013).

While the term &quot;Hinglish&quot; is based on the prefix of &quot;Hindi&quot;, it does not refer exclusively to Modern Standard Hindi, but is used in the Indian subcontinent with other Indo-Aryan languages as well, and also by &quot;British South Asian families to enliven standard English&quot;. When Hindi–Urdu is viewed as a single spoken language called Hindustani, the portmanteaus Hinglish and Urdish mean the same code-mixed tongue, though the latter term is used in India and Pakistan to precisely refer to a mixture of English with the Urdu sociolect.

==History and evolution==

=== Background ===
Hindustani has an approximately ten-century history. In this period, it has accommodated several linguistic influences. Contact with Sanskrit, Prakrit, Pali, Apabhraṃśa, Persian, Arabic and Turkic languages has led to historical &#x27;mixes&#x27; or fusions, e.g., Hindustani, Rekhta. Linguistic fusions were celebrated by Bhakti poets, in approximately the 15th-17th centuries as &#x27;khichdi boli&#x27; – or amalgamated speech.

=== Colonial era ===

At the turn of the 18th century, with the rising dominion of the East India Company, also called &#x27;Company Raj&#x27; (literally, &#x27;Company Rule&#x27;), the languages of India were brought into contact with the foreign element of English. In colonized India, English became a symbol of authority and a powerful hegemonic tool to propagate British culture, including Christianity. The political ascendancy of the British extended into social and professional roles; this meant that the legal proceedings, as well as the studies in medicine and science, were conducted in English.

This led to an interest in the promotion of English into the society of Indian natives. Educated Indians, or &#x27;brown sahibs&#x27;, wished to participate in academia and pursue professional careers. Raja Rammohan Roy, a social and education reformer, advocated that English be taught to Indians by certain British gentlemen for the benefit and instruction of the native Indians. Charles Grant, the president of the East India Company&#x27;s board of control, championed the cause of English education as a &#x27;cure for darkness&#x27; where &#x27;darkness&#x27; was &#x27;Hindoo ignorance&#x27;. The Charter Act was passed in 1813. This legalized missionary work by the Company, including the introduction of English education. By the beginning of the twentieth century, English had become the unifying language in the Indian struggle for independence against the British.

Meanwhile, English was on its way to becoming the first global lingua franca. By the end of the twentieth century, it had special status in seventy countries, including India. Worldwide, English began to represent modernization and internationalization, with more and more jobs requiring basic fluency in it. In India especially, the language came to acquire a social prestige, &#x27;a class apart of education&#x27;, which prompted native Indian or South Asian speakers to turn bilingual, speaking their mother tongue at home or in a local context, but English in academic or work environments.

In the late 19th century, Bharatendu Harishchandra, often considered the father of modern Hindi, wrote poems in Hinglish, combining languages and scripts.

The contact of &#x27;South Asian&#x27; languages, which is a category that refers inclusively to Hindi and Indian languages, with English, led to the emergence of the linguistic phenomenon now known as Hinglish. Many common Indic words such as &#x27;pyjamas&#x27;, &#x27;karma&#x27;, &#x27;guru&#x27; and &#x27;yoga&#x27; were incorporated into English usage, and vice versa (&#x27;road&#x27;, &#x27;sweater&#x27;, and &#x27;plate&#x27;). This is in parallel with several other similar hybrids around the world, like Spanglish (Spanish + English) and Taglish (Tagalog + English). A fair share of the words borrowed into English from Indian languages were themselves borrowed from Persian or Arabic. An example of this is the widely used English word &#x27;pyjamas&#x27; which originates from Persian &quot;paejamah&quot;, literally &quot;leg clothing,&quot; from &quot;pae&quot; &quot;leg&quot; (from PIE root *ped- &quot;foot&quot;) + &quot;jamah&quot; &quot;clothing, garment.&quot;

=== Contemporary era ===

In recent years, due to an increase in literacy and connectivity, the interchange of languages has reached new heights, especially due to increasing online immersion. English is the most widely used language on the internet, and this is a further impetus to the use of Hinglish online by native Hindi speakers, especially among the youth. Google&#x27;s Gboard mobile keyboard app gives an option of Hinglish as a typing language where one can type a Hindi sentence in the Roman script and suggestions will be Hindi words but in the Roman script. In 2021, Google rolled out support for Romanized Hindi on its search engine and on the Google Pay app. Phrases such as &quot;Naya Payment&quot; for &quot;New Payment&quot; and &quot;Transaction History Dekhein&quot; for &quot;See Transaction History&quot; are used.

While Hinglish has arisen from the presence of English in India, it is not merely Hindi and English spoken side by side, but a language type in itself, like all linguistic fusions. Aside from the borrowing of vocabulary, there is the phenomenon of switching between languages, called code-switching and code-mixing, direct translations, adapting certain words, and infusing the flavours of each language into each other.

The Indian English variety, or simply Hinglish, is the Indian adaption of English in a very endocentric manner, which is why it is popular among the youth. Like other dynamic language mixes, Hinglish is now thought to &#x27;have a life of its own&#x27;.

Hinglish used to be limited to informal contexts and ads, but it is now also used in university classrooms.

==Computational analysis==
With its widespread use in social media such as blogs, Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), the analysis of Hinglish using computers has become important in a number of natural language processing applications like machine translation (MT) and speech-to-speech translation.

==Users==

Hinglish is more commonly heard in urban and semi-urban centers of northern India. It is also spoken to some extent as an easier-to-learn variant of Hindi by South Indians and members of the South Asian diaspora who are more comfortable with English. Research into the linguistic dynamics of India shows that while the use of English is on the rise, there are more people fluent in Hinglish than in pure English. David Crystal, a British linguist at the University of Wales, projected in 2004 that at about 350 million, the world&#x27;s Hinglish speakers may soon outnumber native English speakers.

In India, Romanised Hindi is the dominant form of expression online. In an analysis of YouTube comments, Palakodety et al., identified that 52% of comments were in Romanised Hindi, 46% in English, and 1% in Devanagari Hindi. Romanised Hindi is also used by some newspapers such as &quot;The Times of India&quot;. The first novel written in this format, &quot;All We Need Is Love&quot;, was published in 2015. Romanised Hindi has been supported by advertisers in part because it allows a message to be conveyed in a neutral script to both Hindi and Urdu speakers. Other reasons for adoption of Romanised Hindi are the prevalence of Roman-script digital keyboards and corresponding lack of Indic-script keyboards in most mobile phones.

Hinglish has become increasingly accepted at the governmental level in India as an alternative to Sanskritised Hindi; in 2011, the Home Ministry gave permission to officials to use English words in their Hindi notes, so long as they are written in Devanagari script.

<doc id="413746" wikidata="Q1036511" url="?curid=413746" title="Vernacular">
<text>Vernacular is the ordinary, informal, spoken form of language, particularly when perceived as having lower social status or less prestige than standard language, which is more codified, institutionally promoted, literary, or formal. More narrowly, a particular language variety that does not hold a widespread high-status perception, and sometimes even carries social stigma, is also called a vernacular, vernacular dialect, nonstandard dialect, etc. and is typically its speakers&#x27; native variety. Regardless of any such stigma, all nonstandard dialects are full-fledged varieties of language with their own consistent grammatical structure, sound system, body of vocabulary, etc. 

==Overview==
Like any native language variety, a vernacular has an internally coherent system of grammar. It may be associated with a particular set of vocabulary, and spoken using a variety of accents, styles, and registers. As American linguist John McWhorter describes about a number of dialects spoken in the American South in earlier U.S. history, including older African-American Vernacular English, &quot;the often nonstandard speech of Southern white planters, nonstandard British dialects of indentured servants, and West Indian patois, [...] were &quot;non&quot;standard but not &quot;sub&quot;standard.&quot; In other words, the adjective &quot;nonstandard&quot; should not be taken to mean that these various dialects were intrinsically incorrect, less logical, or otherwise inferior, only that they were not the socially perceived norm or mainstream considered prestigious or appropriate for public speech; however, nonstandard dialects are indeed often stigmatized as such, due to socially-induced rationalization. Again, however, linguistics regards all varieties of a language as coherent, complex, and complete systems—even nonstandard varieties.

A dialect or language variety that is a vernacular may not have historically benefited from the institutional support or sanction that a standard dialect has. According to another definition, a vernacular is a language that has not developed a standard variety, undergone codification, or established a literary tradition.

Vernacular may vary from overtly prestigious speech varieties in different ways, in that the vernacular can be a distinct stylistic register, a regional dialect, a sociolect, or an independent language. Vernacular is a term for a type of speech variety, generally used to refer to a local language or dialect, as distinct from what is seen as a standard language. The vernacular is contrasted with higher-prestige forms of language, such as national, literary, liturgical or scientific idiom, or a &quot;lingua franca&quot;, used to facilitate communication across a large area. However, vernaculars usually carry covert prestige among their native speakers, in showcasing group identity or sub-culture affiliation.

As a border case, a nonstandard dialect may even have its own written form, though it could then be assumed that the orthography is unstable, inconsistent, or unsanctioned by powerful institutions, like that of government or education. The most salient instance of nonstandard dialects in writing would likely be nonstandard phonemic spelling of reported speech in literature or poetry (e.g., the publications of Jamaican poet Linton Kwesi Johnson) where it is sometimes described as &quot;eye dialect.&quot;

Nonstandard dialects have been used in classic literature throughout history. One famous example of this is Mark Twain, &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;. This classic piece of literature, commonly taught in schools in the U.S., includes dialogue from various characters in their own native vernaculars (including representations of Older Southern American English and African-American English), which are not written in standard English.

In the case of the English language, while it has become common thought to assume that nonstandard varieties should not be taught, there has been evidence to prove that teaching nonstandard dialects in the classroom can encourage some children to learn English.

==Etymology==
The first known usage of the word &quot;vernacular&quot; in English is not recent. In 1688, James Howell wrote:
Concerning Italy, doubtless there were divers before the Latin did spread all over that Country; the Calabrian, and Apulian spoke Greek, whereof some Relics are to be found to this day; but it was an adventitious, no Mother-Language to them: &#x27;tis confess&#x27;d that Latium it self, and all the Territories about Rome, had the Latin for its maternal and common first vernacular Tongue; but Tuscany and Liguria had others quite discrepant, viz. the Hetruscane and Mesapian, whereof though there be some Records yet extant; yet there are none alive that can understand them: The Oscan, the Sabin and Tusculan, are thought to be but Dialects to these.

Here, vernacular, mother language and dialect are in use in a modern sense. According to Merriam-Webster, &quot;vernacular&quot; was brought into the English language as early as 1601 from the Latin (&quot;native&quot;) which had been in figurative use in Classical Latin as &quot;national&quot; and &quot;domestic&quot;, having originally been derived from , a slave born in the house rather than abroad. The figurative meaning was broadened from the diminutive extended words . Varro, the classical Latin grammarian, used the term , &quot;termes de la langue nationale&quot; or &quot;vocabulary of the national language&quot; as opposed to foreign words.

==Concepts of the vernacular==
===General linguistics===
====In contrast with lingua franca====
In general linguistics, a vernacular is contrasted with a &quot;lingua franca&quot;, a third-party language in which persons speaking different vernaculars not understood by each other may communicate. For instance, in Western Europe until the 17th century, most scholarly works had been written in Latin, which was serving as a lingua franca. Works written in Romance languages are said to be in the vernacular. The &quot;Divina Commedia&quot;, the , and The Song of Roland are examples of early vernacular literature in Italian, Spanish, and French, respectively.

In Europe, Latin was used widely instead of vernacular languages in varying forms until , in its latter stage as Neo-Latin.

In religion, Protestantism was a driving force in the use of the vernacular in Christian Europe, the Bible having been translated from Latin into vernacular languages with such works as the Bible in Dutch: published in 1526 by Jacob van Liesvelt; Bible in French: published in 1528 by Jacques Lefevre d&#x27;Étaples (or Faber Stapulensis); German Luther Bible in 1534 (New Testament 1522); Bible in Spanish: published in Basel in 1569 by Casiodoro de Reina (Biblia del Oso); Bible in Czech: Bible of Kralice, printed between 1579 and 1593; Bible in English: King James Bible, published in 1611; Bible in Slovene, published in 1584 by Jurij Dalmatin. In Catholicism, vernacular bibles were later provided, but Latin was used at Tridentine Mass until the Second Vatican Council of 1965. Certain groups, notably Traditionalist Catholics, continue to practice Latin Mass. In Eastern Orthodox Church, four Gospels translated to vernacular Ukrainian language in 1561 are known as Peresopnytsia Gospel.

In India, the 12th century Bhakti movement led to the translation of Sanskrit texts to the vernacular.

In science, an early user of the vernacular was Galileo, writing in Italian , though some of his works remained in Latin. A later example is Isaac Newton, whose 1687 &quot;Principia&quot; was in Latin, but whose 1704 &quot;Opticks&quot; was in English. Latin continues to be used in certain fields of science, notably binomial nomenclature in biology, while other fields such as mathematics use vernacular; see scientific nomenclature for details.

In diplomacy, French displaced Latin in Europe in the 1710s, due to the military power of Louis XIV of France.

Certain languages have both a classical form and various vernacular forms, with two widely used examples being Arabic and Chinese: see Varieties of Arabic and Chinese language. In the 1920s, due to the May Fourth Movement, Classical Chinese was replaced by written vernacular Chinese.

====As a low variant in diglossia====
The vernacular is also often contrasted with a liturgical language, a specialized use of a former &quot;lingua franca&quot;. For example, until the 1960s, the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church was generally celebrated in Latin rather than in vernaculars. The Coptic Church still holds liturgies in Coptic, not Arabic. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church holds liturgies in Ge&#x27;ez, but parts of the Mass are read in Amharic.

Similarly, in Hindu culture, traditionally religious or scholarly works were written in Sanskrit (long after its use as a spoken language) or in Tamil in Tamil country. Sanskrit was a lingua franca among the non-Indo-European languages of the Indian subcontinent and became more of one as the spoken languages, or prakrits, began to diverge from it in different regions. With the rise of the bhakti movement from the 12th century onwards, religious works were created in other languages: Hindi, Kannada, Telugu and many others. For example, the Ramayana, one of Hinduism&#x27;s sacred epics in Sanskrit, had vernacular versions such as &quot;Ranganadha Ramayanam&quot; composed in Telugu by Gona Buddha Reddy in the 15th century; and &quot;Ramacharitamanasa&quot;, a Awadhi version of the Ramayana by the 16th-century poet Tulsidas.

These circumstances are a contrast between a vernacular and language variant used by the same speakers. According to one school of linguistic thought, all such variants are examples of a linguistic phenomenon termed diglossia (&quot;split tongue&quot;, on the model of the genetic anomaly). In it, the language is bifurcated: the speaker learns two forms of the language and ordinarily uses one but under special circumstances uses the other. The one most frequently used is the low (L) variant, equivalent to the vernacular, while the special variant is the high (H). The concept was introduced to linguistics by Charles A. Ferguson (1959), but Ferguson explicitly excluded variants as divergent as dialects or different languages or as similar as styles or registers. It must not be a conversational form; Ferguson had in mind a literary language. For example, a lecture is delivered in a different variety than ordinary conversation. Ferguson&#x27;s own example was classical and spoken Arabic, but the analogy between Vulgar Latin and Classical Latin is of the same type. Excluding the upper-class and lower-class register aspects of the two variants, Classical Latin was a literary language; the people spoke Vulgar Latin as a vernacular.

Joshua Fishman redefined the concept in 1964 to include everything Ferguson had excluded. Fishman allowed both different languages and dialects and also different styles and registers as the H variants. The essential contrast between them was that they be &quot;functionally differentiated&quot;; that is, H must be used for special purposes, such as a liturgical or sacred language. Fasold expanded the concept still further by proposing that multiple H exist in society from which the users can select for various purposes. The definition of an H is intermediate between Ferguson&#x27;s and Fishman&#x27;s. Realizing the inappropriateness of the term diglossia (only two) to his concept, he proposes the term broad diglossia.

===Sociolinguistics===
Within sociolinguistics, the term &quot;vernacular&quot; has been applied to several concepts. Context, therefore, is crucial to determining its intended sense.

====As an informal register====
In variation theory, pioneered by William Labov, language is a large set of styles or registers from which the speaker selects according to the social setting of the moment. The vernacular is &quot;the least self-conscious style of people in a relaxed conversation&quot;, or &quot;the most basic style&quot;; that is, casual varieties used spontaneously rather than self-consciously, informal talk used in intimate situations. In other contexts the speaker does conscious work to select the appropriate variations. The one they can use without this effort is the first form of speech acquired.

====As a non-standard dialect====
In another theory, the vernacular language is opposed to the standard language. The non-standard varieties thus defined are dialects, which are to be identified as complexes of factors: &quot;social class, region, ethnicity, situation, and so forth&quot;. Both the standard and non-standard languages have dialects, but in contrast to the standard language, the non-standard language has &quot;socially disfavored&quot; structures. The standard language is primarily written (in traditional print media), whereas the non-standard language is spoken. An example of a vernacular dialect is African American Vernacular English.

====As an idealisation====
A vernacular is not a real language but is &quot;an abstract set of norms&quot;.

==First vernacular grammars==
Vernaculars acquired the status of official languages through metalinguistic publications. Between 1437 and 1586, the first reference grammars of Italian, Spanish, French, Dutch, German and English were written, though not always immediately published. It is to be understood that the first precursors of those languages preceded their standardization by up to several hundred years.

===Dutch===
In the 16th century, the &quot;rederijkerskamers&quot; (learned, literary societies founded throughout Flanders and Holland from the 1420s onward) attempted to impose a Latin structure on Dutch, on the presumption that Latin grammar had a &quot;universal character&quot;. However, in 1559, John III van de Werve, Lord of Hovorst published his grammar &quot;Den schat der Duytsscher Talen&quot; in Dutch; Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert (&quot;Eenen nieuwen ABC of Materi-boeck&quot;) followed five years after, in 1564. The Latinizing tendency changed course, with a joint publication, in 1584 by De Eglantier and the rhetoric society of Amsterdam; this was to be the first comprehensive Dutch grammar, &quot;Twe-spraack vande Nederduitsche letterkunst/ ófte Vant spellen ende eyghenscap des Nederduitschen taals&quot;. Hendrick Laurenszoon Spieghel was a major contributor, with others contributing as well.

===English===

Modern English is considered to have begun at a conventional date of about 1550, most notably at the end of the Great Vowel Shift. It was created by the infusion of Old French into Old English, after the Norman conquest of 1066 AD, and of Latin at the instigation of the clerical administration. While present-day English speakers may be able to read Middle English authors (such as Geoffrey Chaucer), Old English is much more difficult.

Middle English is known for its alternative spellings and pronunciations. The British Isles, although geographically limited, have always supported populations of widely-varied dialects, as well as a few different languages; some examples of languages and regional accents (and/or dialects) within Great Britain include Scotland (Scottish Gaelic), Northumbria, Yorkshire, Wales (Welsh), the Isle of Man (Manx), Devon, and Cornwall (Cornish).

Being the language of a maritime power, English was (of necessity) formed from elements of many different languages. Standardisation has been an ongoing issue. Even in the age of modern communications and mass media, according to one study, &quot;… although the Received Pronunciation of Standard English has been heard constantly on radio and then television for over 60 years, only 3 to 5% of the population of Britain actually speaks RP … new brands of English have been springing up even in recent times ...&quot; What the vernacular would be in this case is a moot point: &quot;… the standardisation of English has been in progress for many centuries.&quot;

Modern English came into being as the standard Middle English (i.e., as the preferred dialect of the monarch, court and administration). That dialect was of the East Midland, which had spread to London, where the king resided and from which he ruled. It contained Danish forms not often used in the north or south, as the Danes had settled heavily in the midlands. Chaucer wrote in an early East Midland style; John Wycliffe translated the New Testament into it, and William Caxton, the first English printer, wrote in it. Caxton is considered the first modern English author. The first printed book in England was Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, published by Caxton in 1476.

The first English grammars were written in Latin, with some in French, after a general plea for mother-tongue education in England: &quot;The first part of the elementary&quot;, published in 1582, by Richard Mulcaster. In 1586, William Bullokar wrote the first English grammar to be written in English, the &quot;Pamphlet for Grammar&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Bref Grammar&quot;, in that same year. Previously he had written the &quot;Booke at Large for the Amendment of Orthography for English Speech&quot; (1580), but his orthography was not generally accepted and was soon supplanted, thus his grammar shared a similar fate. Other grammars in English followed rapidly; Paul Greaves&#x27; &quot;Grammatica Anglicana&quot; (1594), Alexander Hume&#x27;s &quot;Orthographie and Congruitie of the Britain Tongue&quot; (1617), and many others. Over the succeeding decades, many literary figures turned a hand to grammar in English; Alexander Gill, Ben Jonson, Joshua Poole, John Wallis, Jeremiah Wharton, James Howell, Thomas Lye, Christopher Cooper, William Lily, John Colet and more, all leading to the massive dictionary of Samuel Johnson.

===French===

French (as Old French) emerged as a Gallo-Romance language from Colloquial Latin during late antiquity. The written language is known from at least as early as the 9th century. That language contained many forms still identifiable as Latin. Interest in standardizing French began in the 16th century. Because of the Norman conquest of England and the Anglo-Norman domains in both northwestern France and Britain, English scholars retained an interest in the fate of French as well as of English. Some of the numerous 16th-century surviving grammars are:

* John Palsgrave, &quot;L&#x27;esclarcissement de la langue francoyse&quot; (1530; in English).
* Louis Meigret, &quot;Tretté de la grammaire françoeze&quot; (1550).
* Robert Stephanus: &quot;Traicté de la grammaire françoise&quot; (1557).

===German===

The development of a standard German was impeded by political disunity and strong local traditions until the invention of printing made possible a &quot;High German-based book language&quot;. This literary language was not identical to any specific variety of German. The first grammar evolved from pedagogical works that also tried to create a uniform standard from the many regional dialects for various reasons. Religious leaders wished to create a sacred language for Protestantism that would be parallel to the use of Latin for the Roman Catholic Church. Various administrations wished to create a civil service, or chancery, language that would be useful in more than one locality. And finally, nationalists wished to counter the spread of the French national language into German-speaking territories assisted by the efforts of the French Academy.

With so many linguists moving in the same direction, a standard German (&quot;hochdeutsche Schriftsprache&quot;) did evolve without the assistance of a language academy. Its precise origin, the major constituents of its features, remains uncertainly known and debatable. Latin prevailed as a lingua franca until the 17th century, when grammarians began to debate the creation of an ideal language. Before 1550 as a conventional date, &quot;supraregional compromises&quot; were used in printed works, such as the one published by Valentin Ickelsamer (&quot;Ein Teutsche Grammatica&quot;) 1534. Books published in one of these artificial variants began to increase in frequency, replacing the Latin then in use. After 1550 the supraregional ideal broadened to a universal intent to create a national language from Early New High German by deliberately ignoring regional forms of speech, which practice was considered to be a form of purification parallel to the ideal of purifying religion in Protestantism.

In 1617, the Fruitbearing Society, a language club, was formed in Weimar in imitation of the in Italy. It was one of many such clubs; however, none became a national academy. In 1618–1619 Johannes Kromayer wrote the first all-German grammar. In 1641 Justin Georg Schottel in &quot;teutsche Sprachkunst&quot; presented the standard language as an artificial one. By the time of his work of 1663, &quot;ausführliche Arbeit von der teutschen Haubt-Sprache&quot;, the standard language was well established.

===Irish===
&quot;Auraicept na n-Éces&quot; is a grammar of the Irish language which is thought to date back as far as the 7th century: the earliest surviving manuscripts are 12th-century.

===Italian===

Italian appears before standardization as the &quot;lingua Italica&quot; of Isidore and the &quot;lingua vulgaris&quot; of subsequent medieval writers. Documents of mixed Latin and Italian are known from the 12th century, which appears to be the start of writing in Italian.

The first known grammar of a Romance language was a book written in manuscript form by Leon Battista Alberti between 1437 and 1441 and entitled &quot;Grammatica della lingua toscana&quot;, &quot;Grammar of the Tuscan Language&quot;. In it Alberti sought to demonstrate that the vernacular – here Tuscan, known today as modern Italian – was every bit as structured as Latin. He did so by mapping vernacular structures onto Latin.

The book was never printed until 1908. It was not generally known, but it was known, as an inventory of the library of Lorenzo de&#x27;Medici lists it under the title &quot;Regule lingue florentine&quot; (&quot;Rules of the Florentine language&quot;). The only known manuscript copy, however, is included in the codex, Reginense Latino 1370, located at Rome in the Vatican library. It is therefore called the &quot;Grammatichetta vaticana.&quot;

More influential perhaps were the 1516 &quot;Regole grammaticali della volgar lingua&quot; of Giovanni Francesco Fortunio and the 1525 &quot;Prose della vulgar lingua&quot; of Pietro Bembo. In those works the authors strove to establish a dialect that would qualify for becoming the Italian national language.

===Occitan===
The first grammar in a vernacular language in western Europe was published in Toulouse in 1327. Known as the &quot;Leys d&#x27;amor&quot; and written by Guilhèm Molinièr, an advocate of Toulouse, it was published in order to codify the use of the Occitan language in poetry competitions organized by the company of the Gai Saber in both grammar and rhetorical ways.

===Spanish===

Chronologically, Spanish (more accurately, &quot;lengua castellana&quot;) has a development similar to that of Italian. There was some vocabulary in Isidore of Seville, with traces afterward, writing from about the 12th century; standardisation began in the 15th century, concurrent with the rise of Castile as an international power. The first Spanish grammar by Antonio de Nebrija (&quot;Tratado de gramática sobre la lengua Castellana&quot;, 1492) was divided into parts for native and nonnative speakers, pursuing a different purpose in each. Books 1–4 describe the Spanish language grammatically, in order to facilitate the study of Latin for its Spanish-speaking readers. Book 5 contains a phonetical and morphological overview of Spanish for nonnative speakers.

===Welsh===
The &quot;Grammar Books of the Master-poets&quot; () are considered to have been composed in the early fourteenth century, and are present in manuscripts from soon after. These tractates draw on the traditions of the Latin grammars of Donatus and Priscianus and also on the teaching of the professional Welsh poets. The tradition of grammars of the Welsh Language developed from these through the Middle Ages and to the Renaissance.

==First vernacular dictionaries==
A dictionary is to be distinguished from a glossary. Although numerous glossaries publishing vernacular words had long been in existence, such as the Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville, which listed many Spanish words, the first vernacular dictionaries emerged together with vernacular grammars.

===Dutch===
Glossaries in Dutch began about 1470 AD leading eventually to two Dutch dictionaries:
* Christophe Plantin: &quot;Thesaurus Theutonicae Linguae&quot;, 1573
* Cornelis Kiliaan: &quot;Dictionarium Teutonico-Latinum&quot;, 1574 (becoming &quot;Etymologicum&quot; with the 1599 3rd edition)

Shortly after (1579) the Southern Netherlands came under the dominion of Spain, then of Austria (1713) and of France (1794). The Congress of Vienna created the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815 from which southern Netherlands (being Catholic) seceded in 1830 to form the Kingdom of Belgium, which was confirmed in 1839 by the Treaty of London. As a result of this political instability no standard Dutch was defined (even though much in demand and recommended as an ideal) until after World War II. Currently the Dutch Language Union, an international treaty organization founded in 1980, supports a standard Dutch in the Netherlands, while Afrikaans is regulated by Die Taalkommissie founded in 1909.

===English===
Standard English remains a quasi-fictional ideal, despite the numerous private organizations publishing prescriptive rules for it. No language academy was ever established or espoused by any government past or present in the English-speaking world. In practice the British monarchy and its administrations established an ideal of what good English should be considered to be, and this in turn was based on the teachings of the major universities, such as Cambridge University and Oxford University, which relied on the scholars whom they hired. There is a general but far from uniform consensus among the leading scholars about what should or should not be said in standard English; but for every rule, examples from famous English writers can be found that break it. Uniformity of spoken English never existed and does not exist now, but usages do exist, which must be learnt by the speakers, and do not conform to prescriptive rules.

Usages have been documented not by prescriptive grammars, which on the whole are less comprehensible to the general public, but by comprehensive dictionaries, often termed unabridged, which attempt to list all usages of words and the phrases in which they occur as well as the date of first use and the etymology where possible. These typically require many volumes, and yet not more so than the unabridged dictionaries of many languages.

Bilingual dictionaries and glossaries precede modern English and were in use in the earliest written English. The first monolingual dictionary was Robert Cawdrey&#x27;s &quot;Table Alphabeticall&quot; (1604) which was followed by Edward Phillips&#x27;s &quot;A New World of English Words&quot; (1658) and Nathaniel Bailey&#x27;s &quot;An Universal Etymological English Dictionary&quot; (1721). These dictionaries whetted the interest of the English-speaking public in greater and more prescriptive dictionaries until Samuel Johnson published &quot;Plan of a Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (1747), which would imitate the dictionary being produced by the French Academy. He had no problem acquiring the funding, but not as a prescriptive dictionary. This was to be a grand comprehensive dictionary of all English words at any period, &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (1755).

By 1858, the need for an update resulted in the first planning for a new comprehensive dictionary to document standard English, a term coined at that time by the planning committee. The dictionary, known as the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, published its first fascicle in 1884. It attracted significant contributions from some singular minds, such as William Chester Minor, a former army surgeon who had become criminally insane and made most of his contributions while incarcerated. Whether the OED is the long-desired standard English Dictionary is debatable, but its authority is taken seriously by the entire English-speaking world. Its staff is currently working on a third edition.

===French===
Surviving dictionaries are a century earlier than their grammars. The Académie française founded in 1635 was given the obligation of producing a standard dictionary. Some early dictionaries are:
* Louis Cruse, alias Garbin: &quot;Dictionaire latin-françois&quot;, 1487
* Robert Estienne, alias Robertus Stephanus: &quot;Dictionnaire françois–latin&quot;, 1539
* Maurice de la Porte: &quot;Epitheta&quot;, 1571
* Jean Nicot: &quot;Thresor de la langue fracoyse, tant ancienne que moderne&quot;, 1606
* Pierre Richelet: &quot;Dictionnaire françois contenant les mots et les choses&quot;, 1680
* Académie française: &quot;Dictionnaire de l’Académie française&quot;, 1694 &quot;annis&quot;.

===German===
High German dictionaries began in the 16th century and were at first multi-lingual. They were preceded by glossaries of German words and phrases on various specialized topics. Finally interest in developing a vernacular German grew to the point where Maaler could publish a work called by Jacob Grimm &quot;the first truly German dictionary&quot;, Joshua Maaler&#x27;s &quot;Die Teutsche Spraach: Dictionarium Germanico-latinum novum&quot; (1561).

It was followed along similar lines by Georg Heinisch: &quot;Teütsche Sprache und Weißheit&quot; (1616). After numerous dictionaries and glossaries of a less-than-comprehensive nature came a thesaurus that attempted to include all German, Kaspar Stieler&#x27;s &quot;Der Teutschen Sprache Stammbaum und Fortwachs oder Teutschen Sprachschatz&quot; (1691), and finally the first codification of written German, Johann Christoph Adelung&#x27;s &quot;Versuch eines vollständigen grammatisch-kritischen Wörterbuches Der Hochdeutschen Mundart&quot; (1774–1786). Schiller called Adelung an &quot;Orakel&quot; and Wieland is said to have nailed a copy to his desk.

===Italian===
In the early 15th century a number of glossaries appeared, such as that of Lucillo Minerbi on Boccaccio in 1535, and those of Fabrizio Luna on Ariosto, Petrarca, Boccaccio and Dante in 1536. In the mid-16th the dictionaries began, as listed below. In 1582 the first language academy was formed, called Accademia della Crusca, &quot;bran academy&quot;, which sifted language like grain. Once formed, its publications were standard-setting.

Monolingual 
* Alberto Accarisio: &quot;Vocabolario et grammatica con l&#x27;orthographia della lingua volgare&quot;, 1543
* Francesco Alunno: &quot;Le richezze della lingua volgare&quot;, 1543
* Francesco Alunno: &quot;La fabbrica del mondo&quot;, 1548

* Lorenzo Franciosini: &quot;Vocabulario italiano e spagnolo/ Vocabulario español e italiano&quot;, Roma, 1620.

===Serbo-Croatian===
* The first vernacular Serbian dictionary was &quot;Srpski rječnik&quot; (Serbian dictionary) written by Vuk Karadžić and published in 1818.
* &quot;Dictionary of Serbo-Croatian Literary and Vernacular Language&quot; was initiated in 1888 by Stojan Novaković, still in the making

===Spanish===
The first Spanish dictionaries in the 15th century were Latin-Spanish/Spanish-Latin, followed by monolingual Spanish. In 1713 the Real Academia Española, &quot;Royal Spanish Academy&quot;, was founded to set standards. It published an official dictionary, 1726–1739.
* Alonzo de Palencia: &quot;El universal vocabulario en latin y romance&quot;, 1490
* Antonio de Nebrija: &quot;Lexicon latino-hispanicum et hispanico-latinum&quot;, 1492
* Sebastián de Covarrubias Orozco: &quot;Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española&quot;, 1611
* Real Academia Española: &quot;Diccionario de la lengua castellana&quot;, 1726–1739

==Metaphorical usage==
The term &quot;vernacular&quot; may also be applied metaphorically to any cultural product of the lower, common orders of society that is relatively uninfluenced by the ideas and ideals of the educated élite. Hence, vernacular has had connotations of a coarseness and crudeness. &quot;Vernacular architecture&quot;, for example, is a term applied to buildings designed in any style based on practical considerations and local traditions, in contrast to the &quot;polite architecture&quot; produced by professionally trained architects to nationally or internationally agreed aesthetic standards. The historian Guy Beiner has developed the study of &quot;vernacular historiography&quot; as a more sophisticated conceptualization of folk history.

<text>The small-headed cod (Lepidion microcephalus) or the long-finned cod is a deepwater fish belonging to the morid cod family (Moridae), and related to the true cods (genus &quot;Gadus&quot;). It is found in the Tasman Sea, including the Bass Strait. It is commercially harvested by both Australia and New Zealand. It has been found on the continental shelf, but typically its depth range is from . It grows to in total length.

The second common name is because its first dorsal fin is made up of long, filamentous rays. The pelvic fin is long, thin, and scythe-like, and it has a pronounced chin barbel.

The colour is grey-brown with a faint red tint on the body and black-edged median fins.

<text>Gabriel Józef Narutowicz (; 29 March 1865 – 16 December 1922) was a Polish professor of hydroelectric engineering and politician who served as the first president of Poland from 11 December 1922 until his assassination, five days after assuming office. He previously served as the minister of public works from 1920 to 1922 and briefly as the minister of foreign affairs in 1922. A renowned engineer and politically independent, Narutowicz was the first elected head of state following Poland&#x27;s regained sovereignty from partitioning powers.

Born into a noble family with the strong patriotic sentiment, Narutowicz studied at the Saint Petersburg Imperial University before relocating to Zurich Polytechnic and completing his studies in Switzerland. An engineer by profession, he was a pioneer of electrification and his works were presented at exhibitions across Western Europe. Narutowicz also directed the construction of the first European hydroelectric power plants in Monthey, Mühleberg and Andelsbuch. In 1907, he was nominated a professor of hydroelectric and water engineering in Zurich, and was subsequently assigned to maintaining the Rhine. In September 1919, Narutowicz was invited by the Polish authorities in rebuilding the nation&#x27;s infrastructure after the devastation caused by World War I. On 23 June 1920, Narutowicz became the minister of public works in Władysław Grabski’s government. Following his successful conduct of the Polish delegation at the Genoa Conference, on 28 June 1922 he became the minister of foreign affairs in Artur Śliwiński’s cabinet.

During the elections in 1922, Narutowicz was supported by the center-left, most notably the Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Wyzwolenie&quot;, and by national minorities, but was criticized by the right-wing National Democrats. Far-right zealots, ultra-Catholic unions and nationalists targeted him for sympathy towards Polish Jews. Upon defeating the other candidate, Maurycy Zamoyski, Narutowicz was elected the first president of the Second Polish Republic. After only five days in office, he was assassinated by a mentally disturbed Eligiusz Niewiadomski while viewing paintings at the Zachęta Art Gallery. His funeral, attended by almost 500,000 people, was simultaneously a manifestation of peace which diminished the power of the far-right movement in the upcoming years.
Narutowicz was a non-practicing Catholic and an active Freemason; he participated in rituals throughout the whole country.

==Family==
Gabriel Józef Narutowicz was born into a Polish-Lithuanian noble family in Telšiai, then part of the Russian Empire after the partitioning of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. His father, Jan Narutowicz, was a local district judge and landholder in the Samogitian village of . As a result of his participation in the January 1863 Uprising against Imperial Russia, he was sentenced to a year in prison; he died when Gabriel was only one.

Gabriel’s mother, Wiktoria Szczepkowska, was Jan&#x27;s third wife. Following her husband&#x27;s death, she raised the sons herself. An educated woman, intrigued by the philosophy of the Age of Enlightenment, she had a great influence on the development of Gabriel and his siblings&#x27; world view. In 1873 she moved to Liepāja, Latvia, so that her children would not be forced to attend a Russian school (Russification in Latvia after the Uprising of 1863 was less enforced than in Lithuania and Poland, the center of the uprising).

An illustration of the dual nature of the family&#x27;s identity is Gabriel Narutowicz’s brother, Stanisław Narutowicz, who, after Lithuania regained independence in 1918, became a Lithuanian, not Polish, citizen. Earlier, towards the end of World War I, Stanisław had become a member of the Council of Lithuania, the provisional Lithuanian parliament. He was a signatory of the Act of Independence of Lithuania of 16 February 1918.

==1865–1920==

Narutowicz finished his secondary education at the Liepāja Gymnasium, Latvia. He then enrolled at the Saint Petersburg Imperial University, in the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics. Illness, however, caused him to suspend those studies and to later transfer to the Zurich Polytechnic in Switzerland, where he studied from 1887 to 1891.

Narutowicz helped exiled Poles on the run from the Russian authorities during his time in Switzerland. He was also connected with a Polish émigré socialist party, &quot;Proletariat&quot;. As a result of his associations, he was banned from returning to Russia and had a warrant issued for his arrest. In 1895 Narutowicz became a Swiss citizen and, after completing his studies, he was employed as an engineer during the construction of the St. Gallen railway.

Narutowicz proved to be an outstanding engineering expert and, in 1895, became chief of works on the River Rhine. Later he was hired by the Kurstein technical office. His works were exhibited at the International Exhibition in Paris (1896), and he would become a famous pioneer of electrification in Switzerland. Narutowicz directed the construction of many other European hydroelectric power plants, such as in Monthey, Mühleberg, and Andelsbuch.

In 1907 he became a professor at ETH Zurich, in the water construction institute in Zurich. He was dean of that institute from 1913 to 1919. He was also a member of the Swiss Committee for Water Economy. In 1915 he was chosen chairman of the International Committee for the regulation of the River Rhine.

During World War I, he cooperated with the General Swiss Committee tasked with helping victims of the war in Poland and was also a member of &quot;La Pologne et la Guerre&quot;, located in Lausanne. A follower of the ideas of Józef Piłsudski, in September 1919 Narutowicz was invited by the Polish government to return to Poland to take part in the rebuilding of the nation&#x27;s infrastructure.

==1920–22==
After coming back to Poland, on 23 June 1920 Narutowicz became the Minister of Public Works in Władysław Grabski’s government. He held that post until 26 June 1922 (in four different subsequent cabinets: of Władysław Grabski, Wincenty Witos and the first and the second governments of Antoni Ponikowski). After becoming the Minister of Public Works, Narutowicz immediately started to work on the rebuilding of his country, using the experience acquired in Switzerland as a pioneer of electrification. He would soon go about reorganizing the reconstruction bureaucracy and reduce the number of employees fourfold over the course of two years, in that way greatly increasing its efficiency.

Narutowicz traveled around the country often to personally supervise and direct public works. By 1921 almost 270,000 buildings and 300 bridges had been rebuilt, most of the roads mended, and about 200 km of highways added. He also designed dams and supervised the building of a hydroelectric power plant in Porąbka on the river Soła in the Beskid Mountains, and worked on irrigation control of the Vistula River.

Politically he had a reputation as a moderate, reasonable and broad-minded man. He was a member of the government in every subsequent cabinet (a period of constant government crises and turnover). In April 1922, Narutowicz was delegated (together with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the time, Konstanty Skirmunt) to participate in the Genoa Conference, and was given credit for the success of the Polish delegation—many Western diplomats had greater trust in the highly respected Narutowicz than in the other government ministers of the newly re-established country.

On 28 June 1922, he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Artur Śliwiński’s government. He also held that post in the later government of Julian Ignacy Nowak. In October 1922, he represented Poland at a conference in Tallinn. In the election of 1922, he supported the center-right National Public Union (&quot;Unia Narodowo-Państwowa&quot;), connected with Józef Piłsudski. He himself was a candidate of the Public Union on Eastern Borderlands (&quot;Państwowe Zjednoczenie na Kresach&quot;) but did not gain a seat in Parliament.

==Elections==

After having lost the elections, Narutowicz continued as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government of Julian Nowak. To his own great surprise that December he was nominated as a candidate for the ensuing presidential election. Although Piłsudski tried to discourage him from becoming a presidential candidate (he himself had originally wanted to decline the nomination, which the Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Wyzwolenie&quot; had proposed), he eventually relented and accepted.

According to the March Constitution of Poland, the president had to be chosen by the National Assembly, that is, the two houses of parliament (Pol: &quot;Zgromadzenie Narodowe&quot; i.e. the Sejm and the Senate). There was no clear winner after the first round of voting. In the second round, the official socialist candidate, Ignacy Daszyński, was eliminated; but again, there was no clear victor. The next to drop out were the two candidates most favored by representatives of the national minorities: namely, Jan Baudouin de Courtenay and Stanisław Wojciechowski (the latter supported by some of the Left). In the last and decisive round, only two candidates remained: Count Maurycy Klemens Zamoyski (backed by the right-wing National Democracy movement) and Narutowicz (supported by some center and left-wing parties as well as by spokesmen for various national minorities).

Narutowicz prevailed thanks to the votes of the left, of the representatives for national minorities vote (these representatives were determined to defeat the National Democracy movement), and of the centrist Polish People’s Party &quot;Piast&quot; (PSL &quot;Piast&quot;). This last group, initially inclined toward Zamoyski, unexpectedly switched its backing to Narutowicz instead. Eventually, Narutowicz won 289 votes, whereas Zamoyski won only 227 votes, and so Narutowicz was elected the first president of the Second Polish Republic.

Narutowicz&#x27;s victory came as an extremely unpleasant surprise to various leading right-wingers. Following the election, certain Catholic and nationalist groups began an aggressive campaign against Narutowicz personally. Among other accusations, they called him an atheist and a Freemason, and some of the press referred to him as “the Jewish president”. The anti-Pilsudski faction, supported by General Józef Haller, also criticized the new president&#x27;s overall support of Piłsudski&#x27;s policies.

==Presidency==
Gabriel Narutowicz served as president of Poland for a mere five days. During his oath of office ceremony on 11 December 1922, members of the National Democracy and others manifested their opposition against the president-elect with anti-government demonstrations in Warsaw. Earlier on that day, opponents of his election attempted to prevent the president-elect from entering the Sejm by blocking the streets and throwing mud at his motorcade. Narutowicz was never comfortable with the widespread belief that he was a representative of the Left in Polish politics. He had only become the candidate of the Polish Peasant Party &quot;Wyzwolenie&quot; by happenstance; he had also not expected to win the election (in its first-round Narutowicz gained just 62 votes whereas Count Zamoyski had 222).

During his first days after his taking the oath of office, Gabriel Narutowicz met with the representatives of the Christian Democratic Party and Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski. Narutowicz realized that it would be impossible to form a majority government in the Parliament, so he made an attempt to create a government beyond the purview of parliament. As a gesture to the right wing, he offered the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs to his rival Zamoyski.

==Death==

Only five days after taking office, on 16 December 1922, Narutowicz was shot dead while attending an art exhibit in the Zachęta National Gallery of Art. The assassin was a painter, Eligiusz Niewiadomski, who had some connections with the right wing party but became pro Piłsudski since 1905.

===Trial===
Niewiadomski was sentenced to death in a one-day trial and executed outside the Warsaw Citadel on 31 January.

===Funeral===
Nearly 500,000 people attended 
Narutowicz&#x27;s funeral was simultaneously a manifestation of peace which diminished the power of the far-right movement in the upcoming years. He was buried with honors on 22 December 1922 in the vault of St. John&#x27;s Cathedral in Warsaw.

===In film===
The murder of Narutowicz was the main theme of the 1977 Polish feature film &quot;Death of a President&quot; (Pol: &quot;Śmierć prezydenta&quot;), directed by Jerzy Kawalerowicz.

<doc id="413754" wikidata="Q1053688" url="?curid=413754" title="Bizen Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area that is eastern Okayama Prefecture in the Chūgoku region of western Japan. Bizen bordered Bitchū, Mimasaka, and Harima Provinces. Its abbreviated form name was . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Bizen was one of the provinces of the San&#x27;yō circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Bizen was ranked as one of the 35 &quot;superior countries&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;near countries&quot; (近国) in terms of distance from the capital. The provincial capital was located in what is now the city of Okayama.

==History==
After its conquest, the ancient Kingdom of Kibi became Kibi Province. It was divided into Bizen (備前), Bitchū (備中), and Bingo (備後) Provinces in the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; administrative reforms in the late 7th century, with &quot;Bizen&quot; taking the first &quot;kanji&quot; of its name from &quot;Kibi&quot; and the second from its geographic position closest to the capital. Bizen Province at this time included the territory of what would later become Mimasaka Province, Tsurashima (Torago, Kojima County), Shōdoshima, and the northern part of the Naoshima Islands. In 713, the six northern counties of Eita, Katsuta, Tomata, Kume and Mashima were separated from Bizen to form Mimasaka Province.

Bizen, with much flat land and many rivers of reasonable size for flood control and water transportation, has been suitable for agriculture since ancient times. It has been an iron production area since the Kofun period, and also had salt fields along its coast with the Seto Inland Sea, which also provided for convenience of marine transportation to the Kinai region Shikoku and Kyushu. The province was economically prosperous, and although its area as not large, it was ranked as a &quot;superior country&quot; under the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; classification system.

The location of the Bizen &quot;kokufu&quot; is uncertain. Per the &quot;Wamyō Ruijushō&quot; it was located in Mino District. However, ruins discovered in Joto District in what his now the Kokufuichi neighborhood of Naka-ku, Okayama ( have been officially designated by the government as an Okayama Prefectural Historic Site. The designation is controversial as it was largely based on the geographic name of the site, which may or may not date to the Nara period.

The location of the Bizen Kokubun-ji is well defined, and is located in the city of Akaiwa, Okayama. It is located about 6.5 kilometers northeast of the estimated location of Bizen &quot;Kokufu&quot;. The foundations of the main temple buildings have been discovered, and the site is a National Historic Site. The presumed ruins of the Bizen Kokubun-niji are located 300 meters south of the monastery site. The details are not clear because no full-scale investigation has been conducted and the site is not covered by the National Historic Site designation,

The &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province is Kibitsuhiko Shrine, located in Kita-ku, Okayama.

Many &quot;shōen&quot; landed estates developed in the province during the Heian and Kamakura periods, and during this time the province also became famous for its production of Japanese swords, especially that of the Osafune school and the Ichimonji schools. Bizen ware pottery also developed during this period, but did not reach national prominence for several centuries.

In the Muromachi period, the Akamatsu clan, based in Harima Province, came to serve as &quot;shugo&quot;. When the power of the Akamatsu clan declined, the power of the Yamana clan increased, and Bizen gradually became a battlefield between the two clans and their proxies. During the Sengoku period, the Urakami clan, the &quot;shugodai&quot;, tried to rule Bizen Province by usurping the power of the Akamatsu clan, but were defeated by Amago Haruhisa, a powerful warlord from the San&#x27;in region. However, when the Amago clan declined, Ukita Naoie, a vassal of the Urakami clan, drove out the remnants of Urakami clan, and conquered Mimasaka Province and parts of Bitchū and Bizen Province to become a &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Sengoku period. He established Okayama as his stronghold. His successor, Ukita Hideie was defeated at the 1600 Battle of Sekigahara and dispossessed by Tokugawa Ieyasu, who awarded Okayama to Kobayakawa Hideaki. When Kobayakawa Hideaki died without heir, Okayama Castle and all of Bizen Province was awarded to Ikeda Tadatsugu, the second son of Ikeda Terumasa. The Ikeda clan continued to rule all of Bizen Province until the Meiji restoration.

Under the Meiji government, on August 29, 1871, Bizen Province became part of Okayama Prefecture, with the exception of its islands in the Seto Inland Sea, which were transferred to Kagawa Prefecture and Ehime Prefecture. A small area of former Bizen Province was transferred to Akō, Hyōgo in 1963 at the request of is local inhabitants.

Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation’s resources, the province had 680 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 423,379 &quot;koku&quot;.

<text>A stapler is a mechanical device that joins pages of paper or similar material by driving a thin metal staple through the sheets and folding the ends. Staplers are widely used in government, business, offices, workplaces, homes, and schools.

The word &quot;stapler&quot; can actually refer to a number of different devices of varying uses. In addition to joining paper sheets together, staplers can also be used in a surgical setting to join tissue together with surgical staples to close a surgical wound (much in the same way as sutures).

Most staplers are used to join multiple sheets of paper. Paper staplers come in two distinct types: manual and electric. Manual staplers are normally hand-held, although models that are used while set on a desk or other surface are not uncommon. Electric staplers exist in a variety of different designs and models. Their primary operating function is to join large numbers of paper sheets together in rapid succession. Some electric staplers can join up to 20 sheets at a time. Typical staplers are a third-class lever.

==History==

The growing usage of paper in the 19th century created a demand for an efficient paper fastener.

In 1841 Slocum and Jillion invented a &quot;Machine for Sticking Pins into Paper&quot;, which is often believed to be the first stapler. But their patent (September 30, 1841, Patent #2275) is for a device used for packaging pins. In 1866, George McGill received U.S. patent 56,587 for a small, bendable brass paper fastener that was a precursor to the modern staple. In 1867, he received U.S. patent 67,665 for a press to insert the fastener into paper. He showed his invention at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and continued to work on these and other various paper fasteners throughout the 1880s. In 1868 an English patent for a stapler was awarded to C. H. Gould, and in the U.S., Albert Kletzker of St. Louis, Missouri, also patented a device.

In 1877 Henry R. Heyl filed patent number 195,603 for the first machines to both insert and clinch a staple in one step, and for this reason some consider him the inventor of the modern stapler. In 1876 and 1877, Heyl also filed patents for the Novelty Paper Box Manufacturing Co. of Philadelphia, PA, However, the N. P. B. Manufacturing Co.&#x27;s inventions were to be used to staple boxes and books.

The first machine to hold a magazine of many pre-formed staples came out in 1878.

On February 18, 1879, George McGill received patent 212,316 for the McGill Single-Stroke Staple Press, the first commercially successful stapler. This device weighed over two and a half pounds and loaded a single wire staple, which it could drive through several sheets of paper.

The first published use of the word &quot;stapler&quot; to indicate a machine for fastening papers with a thin metal wire was in an advertisement in the American &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1901.

In the early 1900s, several devices were developed and patented that punched and folded papers to attach them to each other without a metallic clip. The &quot;Clipless Stand Machine&quot; (made in North Berwick) was sold from 1909 into the 1920s. It cut a tongue in the paper that it folded back and tucked in. &quot;Bump&#x27;s New Model Paper Fastener&quot; used a similar cutting and weaving technology.

===The modern stapler===
In 1941, the type of paper stapler that is the most common in use was developed: the four-way paper stapler. With the four-way, the operator could either use the stapler to staple papers to wood or cardboard, use pliers for bags, or use the normal way with the head positioned a small distance above the stapling plate. The stapling plate is known as the anvil. The anvil often has two settings: the first, and by far most common, is the reflexive setting, also known as the &quot;permanent&quot; setting. In this position, the legs of the staple are folded toward the center of the crossbar. It is used to staple papers which are not expected to need separation. If rotated 180° or slid to its second position, the anvil will be set on the sheer setting, also known as the &quot;temporary&quot; or &quot;straight&quot; setting. In this position, the legs of the staple are folded outwards, away from the crossbar, resulting in the legs and crossbar being in more or less a straight line. Stapling with this setting will result in more weakly secured papers but a staple that is much easier to remove. The use of the second setting is almost never seen, however, due to the prevalence of staple removers and the general lack of knowledge about its use. Some simple modern staplers feature a fixed anvil that lacks the sheer position.

Modern staplers continue to evolve and adapt to users&#x27; changing habits. Less effort or easy-squeeze/use staplers, for example, use different leverage efficiencies to reduce the amount of force the user needs to apply. As a result, these staplers tend to be used in work environments where repetitive, large stapling jobs are routine.

Some modern desktop staplers make use of Flat Clinch technology. With Flat Clinch staplers, the staple legs first pierce the paper and are then bent over and pressed absolutely flat against the paper – doing away with the two-setting anvil commonly used and making use of a recessed stapling base in which the legs are folded. Accordingly, staples do not have sharper edges exposed and lead to flatter stacking of paper – saving on filing and binder space.

Some photocopiers feature an integrated stapler allowing copies of documents to be automatically stapled as they are printed.

==Industry==
In 2012, $80 million worth of staplers were sold in the US. The dominant US manufacturer is Swingline.

==Methods==
Permanent fastening binds items by driving the staple through the material and into an &quot;anvil&quot;, a small metal plate that bends the ends, usually inward. On most modern staplers, the anvil rotates or slides to change between bending the staple ends inward for permanent stapling or outward for &quot;pinning&quot; (see below). Clinches can be standard, squiggled, flat, or rounded completely adjacent to the paper to facilitate neater document stacking.

Pinning temporarily binds documents or other items. To pin, the anvil slides or rotates so that the staple bends outwards instead of inwards. Some staplers pin by bending one leg of the staple inwards and the other outwards. The staple binds the item with relative security but is easily removed.

Tacking fastens objects to surfaces, such as bulletin boards or walls. A stapler that can tack has a base that folds back out of the way, so staples drive directly into an object rather than fold against the anvil. In this position, the staples are driven similar to the way a staple gun works, but with less force driving the staple. 

Saddle staplers have an inverted V-shaped saddle for stapling pre-fold sheets to make booklets.

Stapleless staplers, invented in 1910, are a means of stapling that punches out a small flap of paper and weaves it through a notch. A more recent alternative method avoids the resulting hole by crimping the pages together with serrated metal teeth instead.

==Surgical staplers==

Surgeons can use surgical staplers in place of sutures to close the skin or during surgical anastomosis. 

A skin stapler does not resemble a standard stapler, as it has no anvil. Skin staples are commonly preshaped into an &quot;M.&quot; Pressing the stapler into the skin and applying pressure onto the handle bends the staple through the skin and into the fascia until the two ends almost meet in the middle to form a rectangle.

Staplers are commonly used intra-operatively during bowel resections in colorectal surgery. Often these staplers have an integral knife which, as the staples deploy, cuts through the bowel and maintains the aseptic field. The staples, made from surgical steel, are typically supplied in disposable sterilized cartridges.

<text>was a province of Japan on the Inland Sea side of western Honshū, in what is today western Okayama Prefecture. It was sometimes called , with Bizen and Bingo Provinces; those three provinces were settled in the late 7th Century, dividing former Kibi Province. Bitchu bordered Hōki, Mimasaka, Bizen, and Bingo Provinces.

The ancient capital and temples were built around Sōja. For much of the Muromachi Period, the province was dominated by the Hosokawa clan, who resided in Shikoku and allowed the province a degree of independence. By the Sengoku Period, other clans fought over Bitchu, and Oda Nobunaga and Mōri Terumoto were fighting in the province when Oda died, leading to a division of the province. After 1600, the province was divided among a variety of han (fiefs), and included a number of castles. By the time the provinces were reorganized into prefectures, the dominant city was the port, Kurashiki.

==Shrines and temples==
&quot;Kibitsu jinja&quot; was the chief Shinto shrine (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) of Bitchū.

<text>was a province of Japan on the Inland Sea side of western Honshū, comprising what is today the eastern part of Hiroshima Prefecture. It was sometimes grouped together with Bizen and Bitchu Provinces as . The 備 &quot;bi&quot; in the names of these provinces is taken from the second character in the name of Kibi Province, whose ambit also included the area that would be divided off as Mimasaka Province in the early 8th century CE. Bingo bordered Bitchū, Hōki, Izumo, Iwami, and Aki Provinces.

The ancient capital is believed to have been in the vicinity of the city of Fuchu. During the Sengoku Period, Bingo was part of the Mori clan&#x27;s domains, but after the Battle of Sekigahara, Tokugawa Ieyasu reassigned it to one of his allies.

A notable landmark includes Fukuyama Castle, which was the main castle of the Bingo-Fukuyama &quot;han&quot; (clan) during the Edo period of Japanese history.

==Shrines and temples==
&quot;Kibitsu jinja&quot; was the chief Shinto shrine (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) of Bingo.

<doc id="413764" wikidata="Q679616" url="?curid=413764" title="Javed Miandad">
<text>Mohammad Javed Miandad PP SI (; born 12 June 1957), popularly known as Javed Miandad (; ), is a Pakistani cricket coach, commentator and former cricketer known for his unconventional style of captaincy and batting. ESPNcricinfo described him as &quot;the greatest batsman Pakistan has ever produced&quot; and his contemporary Ian Chappell extolled him as one of the finest batsmen in the history of cricket.

He played for Pakistan in Tests and One-Day Internationals between 1975 and 1996. Noted for his unique technique and impressive control, Miandad has won accolades and applause from cricket historians as well as contemporaries. Miandad was ranked 44th among the best cricketers of all time by the ESPN Legends of Cricket. He has served as a captain of the Pakistan team. Miandad is widely known for his historic last-ball six against India in 1986 at Sharjah, when 4 runs were required to win off the final ball, and for his contribution with the bat in Pakistan&#x27;s victory in the 1992 ICC World Cup. His towering, last-ball six off Chetan Sharma in 1986 was the first time that an international game had ended in that fashion until then.
After his playing career, Miandad has held key positions in the Pakistan Cricket Board. He also had three coaching stints with the Pakistan national team.

In 2009, Miandad was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

==Early and personal life==

=== Family background ===
Javed Miandad was born on 12 June 1957 in Karachi. His parents moved from Palanpur, Gujarat, India, where his father, Miandad Noor Mohammad, worked in the police department, posted in cities like Ahmedabad and Baroda, whilst at the same time he was also overseeing the sports clubs in the city for the Nawab.

One of seven children, he has three brothers who played first-class cricket in Pakistan: Anwar Miandad, Sohail Miandad and Bashir Miandad. His nephew, Faisal Iqbal, was also a Test cricketer.

=== Marriage and links with Dawood Ibrahim ===
Javed Miandad married Tahira Saigol, daughter of Khalid Saigol and Farida Hayat in 1981. He has two sons and a daughter.

His son Junaid Miandad is married to Mahrukh Ibrahim, daughter of Dawood Ibrahim, an Indian born mafia kingpin. Miandad told the press that his son and Ibrahim&#x27;s daughter met while studying together in the UK.

=== Religious work ===
In 2011, Miandad recorded a na`at for Geo TV; his &quot;Sakoon Paya&quot; was well received by his fans but he did not subsequently read any more na`at.

==Test career==

===Debut and early years===
Pakistan&#x27;s first Test captain, Abdul Hafeez Kardar, upon seeing Miandad during the 1970s, predicted famously about him: &quot;the find of the decade&quot;. His inclusion in the Pakistan team was itself an achievement. A formidable batting line-up of Mushtaq Mohammad, Majid Khan, Sadiq Mohammad, Zaheer Abbas, Asif Iqbal and Wasim Raja were hard to break into, but Miandad&#x27;s raw talent made it possible and he became an integral part of Pakistan&#x27;s strong batting lineup. He made his Test debut against New Zealand at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore on 9 October 1976. He scored 163 and 25 not out in that match, and became the youngest batsman to score a century on debut, at the age of 19 years and 119 days; he also took a wicket in the match and Pakistan won the match by six wickets. In the third match of the same series, he scored a double century by scoring 206 runs at the National Stadium, Karachi. He broke George Headley&#x27;s 47-year-old record, and became the youngest player—aged 19 years and 140 days—to score a double-century. He scored 85 runs in the second innings, failing to accomplish the unique feat of scoring a double-century and a century in a single match. Miandad was the highest run-scorer of the series, with 504 runs from five innings at an average of 126.00. His performance ensured Pakistan&#x27;s victory in the three-match series by 2–0.

During Pakistan&#x27;s tour to Australia in 1976–77, he played three Tests and scored 148 runs at the average of 29.60. He also took five wickets in the series, including three wickets for 85 runs at the Adelaide Oval. In the 1977–78 home series against England, Miandad scored 262 runs at the average of 131.00, including three half-centuries. His highest score in an innings in the series was 88 runs not out at the Niaz Stadium, Hyderabad. Miandad scored a Test century in his first match against India at the Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad, during the 1978–79 series between the teams. With 154 not out in the match, he completed his first 1,000 Test runs at the age of 21 years and 126 days; he took 23 innings and 14 matches to achieve the feat – the second youngest batsman after Kapil Dev to do so. In the same series, by scoring another century at the National Stadium, he accumulated 357 runs from five innings at the average of 178.50, and ensured Pakistan&#x27;s victory 2–0. In the same season, Miandad played three matches in New Zealand, and accumulated 297 runs against them at the average of 99.00. Being the highest run-scorer of the series, he also scored 160 not out at the Lancaster Park, Christchurch. During the Pakistan&#x27;s tour to Australia in the same season, he scored 183 runs at the average of 61.00, including 129 runs not out at the WACA Ground, Perth.

===Success in the early 1980s===

Under the captaincy of Asif Iqbal in 1979–80, Pakistan toured India and played a six-Test match series against them. Miandad was one of the most &quot;consistent&quot; batsmen, scoring 421 runs—behind Sunil Gavaskar&#x27;s 529 and Wasim Raja&#x27;s 450—with the help of four fifties, averaged 42.10. During the third series at the Wankhede Stadium, Bombay, he completed 2,000 Test runs of his career; he took 42 innings and 24 matches to achieve the feat, and became the fastest Pakistani to do so. In the same season, Miandad was appointed as Pakistan&#x27;s captain for the first time, against the touring Australia. He scored 181 runs at the average over 60 in the series, including 106 runs not out at the Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad, and Pakistan won the three-match series 1–0. In the solitary series of the 1980–81 at home, against the West Indies, Miandad scored 230 runs at the average of 32.85. He scored 60 of the 128 runs in the Pakistan&#x27;s first innings of the third Test match, after they were 14 runs for four wickets. In the 1981–82, during the Pakistan&#x27;s tour of Australia, Miandad captained the Pakistan team in three Test matches. During the first Test at Perth, he was involved in an unpleasant controversy with Dennis Lillee, where the two players came into contact after Lillee blocked Miandad&#x27;s way while he was taking a single, with Lillee kicking Miandad, who responded by shaping to strike him with his bat. Pakistan lost the first two matches of the series, but they won the third Test at Malbourne by an innings and 82 runs, and finished the series 2–1. Miandad batted consistently throughout the series, but could not get support from his teammates as a captain. He scored 205 runs from five innings at the average of 41.00, including two half-centuries.

In the home series of the same season against Sri Lanka, he captained the team in three Tests, although the players refused to play under his captaincy following the Lillee-Miandad controversy. Pakistan won the series by 2–0, with Miadad scoring 176 at the average over 35, including 92 runs at the National Stadium. After the refusal of senior players to play under Miandad captaincy, Imran Khan was appointed as a new captain for the 1982 England tour; Khan was leading the team for the first time. Pakistan lost the three-Test match series 2–1, with Miandad scoring 178 runs at the average of 35.60. In his next series against the touring Australia, he scored his eighth century—138 runs—in the third Test at the Gaddafi Stadium, and ensured Pakistan&#x27;s third successive win in the series. On his performance in the series, the cricket almanack &quot;Wisden&quot; noted that he &quot;grew further in stature as an international batsman, his youthful audacity now being supplanted by a technical competence and insatiable appetite for runs.&quot;

In their home series against India in 1982–83, Pakistan played six Tests and defeated them by 3–0; Pakistan&#x27;s victories at Karachi, Hyderabad and Faisalabad were gained by large margins. Miandad&#x27;s consistency of scoring runs, along with Zaheer, Mudassar and Mohsin Khan, crushed the Indian bowling line. Miandad was the third highest run-scorer, with 594 runs – after Mudassar&#x27;s 761 and Zaheer&#x27;s 650 runs – at the average of 118.80; they made the record for the three top batsmen in any Test series. Miandad and Mudassar&#x27;s partnership of 451 runs in the Hyderabad Test constituted a new world record for the third wicket, and equalled the all-time record for any Test wicket, made by Don Bradman and Bill Ponsford in 1938. They became the first two Pakistani batsmen to score double-centuries in an inning. Miandad scored his career best 280 not out, before the captain Imran Khan, decided to declare the innings, thus stopping him from &quot;possibly breaking the individual Test world record of Sir Garfield Sobers&quot;. Cricket critics call this &quot;one of the worst decisions by Imran as captain of Pakistan&quot; as he &quot;didn&#x27;t even give him a particular time or the number of overs he could bat on for.&quot; Miandad, however never expressed displeasure on the decision. Pakistan won the match by an innings and 119 runs. Pakistan visited India in 1983–84 under the captaincy of Zaheer, and played a leveled three-Test match series. Miandad scored 225 runs in the series at the average of 75.00, including 99 runs at Bangalore. Miandad scored 131 runs against Australia at the Adelaide Oval, the third Test of the series between the teams. He could not perform consistently and finished the series with 302 runs at average of over 33, with Pakistan lost the five-match series 2–0.

===During 1984–88===
Miandad scored centuries in the each innings of the second Test of the 1984–85 series against New Zealand; he scored 104 and 103 not out at the Niaz Stadium, Hyderabad. In the second innings of the match, he established a partnership of 212 runs for third wicket with Mudassar, a Pakistani record at that time. This was the 1,000 match in the history of Test cricket. He was the highest run-scorer of the series, with 337 runs at the average over 84; Pakistan won the series 2–0. Miandad captained the Pakistan cricket team in the next series against the same team, which was played in New Zealand. He could not maintained his previous form against them, and only managed to score 138 runs, averaged below 28. During 1985–86 Sri Lankan tour to Pakistan, three Test matches were played between the teams. Miandad, who was captaining Pakistan, made his third double century in the first Test at Iqbal Stadium. During his innings of 203 not out, he made a partnership of 397 runs with Qasim Umar—who also made a double century in the innings—for third wicket, which was eighth highest overall and second highest for the third wicket at that time. Miandad&#x27;s score of 306 runs from three innings were the most by any batsmen in the series, and his average for the score was 153.00. In the same season Pakistan visited Sri Lanka, and played three Tests against them. During the second Test, Two unpleasant incidents occurred: when an umpire started rubbing the new ball replaced with the older one on the ground, during Pakistan&#x27;s second innings after sixteen overs to get the similar characteristics; Pakistan manager came to the umpire and showed him the 1985 Wisden&#x27;s relevant Law; and Miandad&#x27;s disagreement to the umpire&#x27;s decision of lbw against him. Later on someone from the crowd threw a stone upon Miandad, and he went upstairs into the crowd to take revenge from the spectator.

===Later career===
In 1992, during the Pakistan tour to England, he scored 153 not out in the first Test at Edgbaston, Birmingham. From then to his retirement he scored 578 runs, without scoring a century, at the average of 32.11 in 11 Tests. He made only four half-centuries during that period.

Miandad played 124 Test matches, batting in 189 innings. His aggregate of 8,832 Test runs was a Pakistani record until Younis Khan broke it in 2015. Inzamam ul Haq also came close to breaking this record just falling short by 4 runs. Even though his test career spanned 17 years, he failed to make it into the top-most category of batsmen with test aggregates of over 10,000 runs. Miandad&#x27;s 23 centuries and 43 fifties were Pakistani national records, until they were broken by Inzamam-ul-Haq. Miandad&#x27;s Test career batting average of 52.57 is currently the highest for Pakistani batsmen. He scored six double centuries which is the most by a Pakistani and 6th overall. He became the first batsman in the history of cricket to score a century in both his 1st and 100th test (against New Zealand and India respectively). He made his highest score of 280 not out against India. Pakistan went on to win that match by an innings and 119 runs.

==One Day International career==

Miandad made his One Day International debut against the West Indies at Edgbaston, Birmingham in the 1975 Cricket World Cup. His last ODI was also a World Cup match, and Pakistan lost the match. More, he scored 2 fours and 0 sixes and his strike rate was below 100 in both of his, first and last ODI innings. His highest ODI score came against India at the Gaddafi Stadium in a match which Pakistan lost in 1982. He scored 119 not out off 77 balls with a strike rate of 154.54 in the match.

Pakistan recorded their first win at a major tournament in 1986&#x27;s Austral-Asia Cup held in Sharjah and Miandad finished his innings with 116 not out in the final against India. This is still considered one of the most historic moments in the history of ODI cricket and he became a national hero.

==Captaincy==
After Asif Iqbal&#x27;s retirement following a series loss in the 1979–1980 tour of India, coupled with match fixing allegations for the very first time in Pakistan&#x27;s history, a 22 year old Miandad was made the captain of Pakistan. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) preferred him over the senior cricketers like Zaheer Abbas, Sarfraz Nawaz, Majid Khan and Wasim Bari who were still playing. He faced a little opposition but his first two series as captain, in 1981/82, included a win against Australia, and a credible 0–1 loss to the West Indies. After a tough tour of Australia, opposition to his captaincy gained strength, and his first captaincy period ended during the following home series against Sri Lanka.

He captained Pakistan in six more tests in 1985, and thereafter broadly shared Test captaincy duties with Imran Khan until the end of his career. Pakistan won 14 and lost 6 of his 34 tests in charge. He captained them to home and away Test series victories against England in 1987-8 and 1992, and averaged just over 50 as a batsman when Pakistan&#x27;s captain.

In one-day cricket he captained Pakistan in 62 one-day internationals of which they won 26 and lost 33. None of his one-day international hundreds came as captain.

==Coaching and commentary==
Miandad is one of the few individuals (others being Waqar Younis and Richard Pybus) to have coached the Pakistan Cricket Team over three or more separate occasions. He was first appointed coach in September 1998. Under his reign, Pakistan defeated India in India (once in the Test series which ended 1–1, and once in the Asian Test Championship), won the tri-series in India, won the Asian Test Championship and won the 1999 Sharjah Cup in April. Strangely, Miandad faxed his resignation to the PCB in late April 1999, just before the 1999 Cricket World Cup. The reason for his first resignation was unknown. Many cited hiring of Richard Pybus (technical coach) and Sarfaraz Nawaz (bowling coach) as a possible reason. Others suggested unrest with senior players.

In 2000, after Moin Khan took over captaincy from Saeed Anwar, Miandad was reappointed as the coach. During his second reign, Pakistan won the Sharjah Cup (March 2000), the Asia Cup (May–June 200), the West Indies tri-series and the Test series in Sri Lanka. Pakistan lost the ICC Champions Trophy semifinal under his reign. Miandad was removed along with Moin Khan in April 2001 after Pakistan lost the ODI series in New Zealand. There were also reports of match fixing during the preceding Test series which Pakistan drew after losing the third game.

After Pakistan&#x27;s dismal show in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, another cleanup operation was undertaken by the PCB, naming Rashid Latif as captain and Javed Miandad as team coach in March 2003. During this reign, Miandad won Pakistan the Sharjah Cup (April 2003) bereft of big names like Inzamam and Yousaf. Pakistan won the home Test series against South Africa after losing 3–2 in the ODI series. Pakistan lost the home ODI series to India in 2004 and following the loss of the Test series, Miandad was shown the door in June 2004, being replaced by South African Bob Woolmer.

Following this he was offered broadcasting and coaching positions in India. Also in November 2010, it was being planned to give Miandad a role as a batting coach.
Miandad was again appointed as a batting consultant for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka.

<text>The New Zealand blue cod (Parapercis colias) is a temperate marine ray-finned fish of the family Pinguipedidae. It is also known by its Māori names, rāwaru, pākirikiri and patutuki, and by its other names in English, Boston blue cod, New Zealand cod or sand perch.

It is exclusively found in New Zealand, in shallow waters around rocky coasts to a depth of 150 m, though it is far more common south of the Cook Strait. It is bluish green to blue-black above with white toward the belly. Large examples are usually greenish blue in colour, while smaller ones are blotched in varying shades of brown. An adult may grow to 60 cm in length and weigh from 1.0 to 3.0 kg. It feeds mainly on small fish and crabs. Blue cod is territorial. Spawning takes place in southern spring. Blue cod can also change sex from female to male.

It is an important recreational species in the South Island and is commercially harvested. Blue cod populations are managed under New Zealand&#x27;s fisheries quota management system, although they are becoming scarce in some small areas due to fishing pressure. Annual catch range is between 2,000 and 2,500 tonnes.

== Identification ==

&quot;Parapercis colias&quot; are protogynous hermaphrodites, which means they have both female and male reproductive organs at the beginning and some females change sex to males later in their life. &quot;P. colias&quot; is a marine bottom dwelling fish that is found in coastal New Zealand waters. Their colouring varies on age and sex. Juveniles start off being generally pale in colour and have two long dark stripes along the sides which will turn brown and barely distinguishable when they become middle-sized fish. As they mature with a body length over 25 cm, both sexes would have a blueish-grey dorsal with a white underside. Females have a tinge of orange and there is a trend for them to become green when they grow larger. Brownish pigments can be found at the base of pectoral fin. On the other hand, adult males have distinctive blue-grey colour coat with greenish sides and a golden brown line can be found above each eye. Body length of &quot;P. colias&quot; is about 30–40 cm in general, but can up to 60 cm and their weight is 0.8–1.5 kg in general, but can up to 3 kg. Males tend to be larger than females. They can live up to 32 years old.

Heads of &quot;P. colias&quot; are prominent and rounded with scales. They have a plump shaped body covered with firm scales. Above their non expanded cheeks are two large lateral eyes which can rotate independently, this allows them to see almost everywhere around them. &quot;P. colias&quot; possess a terminal mouth with bulbous lips. Their pelvic fins are generally placed forward on the throat with brown dots appear underneath it. There is a single horizontal stripe where ten to twelve scales above across their side of the body. The anterior section of their dorsal fin is small and short, followed by fins with five short spines. In contrast their second dorsal is long. A key used in an article of Cantwell can distinguish &quot;P. colias&quot; from other parapercids. Key features are listed below:

*The outer row of lower jaw has eight teeth
*Dorsal spines longer to the posterior (rear end)
*Soft dorsal fins have 20 rays and anal fins with 17
*10 to 11 scales are present from lateral line to base of first soft dorsal ray
*23 to 26 counts of gill rakers
*Caudal (tail) fins have 15 branched rays that looks rounded but bi-lobed.

Other characters of detailed skeleton structures (osteology) of &quot;Parapercis&quot; species can be found in an article written by Gosline.

Swimming bladder is usually present in osteichthyids, it helps the fish to stay at a certain water pressure level (depth) without spending more energy. Swimming bladder in &quot;P. colias&quot; are absent. They will automatically sink to the sea floor if they stop swimming; therefore, they are called bottom-dwelling or sedentary bottom-hugging species. Their body shape of having a flattened abdomen indicates this as well. Normally, &quot;P. colias&quot; use their pectoral fin to swim, their body muscles and tails fin are only involved in swimming when a sudden burst or speed is needed, this type of swimming character is called labriform. As a result, their pelvic fins, used as props when they are resting on the seabed, are reduced and thicken. Due to their nature of being bottom-dwelling species, sand can clog their gills when they are resting. To remedy this, &quot;P. colias&quot; often hold their breath and open their mouths for a long interval like having a yawn to take good gulps of air every now and then. Speaking of having a yawn, if you look closely you will notice that &quot;P. colias&quot; do not have palatine teeth and only have small teeth; however, you would not want to feel their sharp and well developed pharyngeal teeth near their throat like their prey.

There are some other detailed morphological characteristics inside the body of &quot;P. colias&quot; that determine their taxonomy, such as the presence of a lentiform body (an ocular vascular structure) and others, are mentioned by Eastman.

== Distribution ==

=== Natural global range ===
Pinguipedid fishes (Sandperches) are widely found in the southern Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions. However, &quot;P. colias&quot; is endemic to New Zealand.

=== New Zealand range ===
&quot;P. colias&quot; is found from the shore to the shelf edge around New Zealand&#x27;s entire coastline, but there are no records in either the Kermadec Islands or the Snares Islands / Tini Heke. They are more abundant from south of Cook Strait and they are an iconic species for the South Island. They are most common around Southland and the Chatham Islands.

== Habitat preferences ==
&quot;P. colias&quot; can be found at 150 m in depth occupying bedrock outcrops on gravel or sandy seabed. These habitats with macro algae or Sponges are even more preferred. Furthermore, their abundance in each habitat varies between age. Juvenile are found more frequently in sponge gardens (more than 16m deep) dominated by orange finger sponges (&quot;Raspalia topsenti&quot; &amp; &quot;Raspalia flaccida&quot;), large black massive sponge (&quot;Ancorina alata&quot;) and the small bright yellow clumps of &quot;Polymastia granulosa&quot; that provide more shelters and safer refuges, whereas adults are mainly found on reef margins and deeper areas.

Since &quot;P. colias&quot; are generalists, which means that they prey on various species instead of depending on only one species, habitats that are rich in diversity of species are also favoured by them. An example of this is the kelp forest which is often established on rock beds where it is also desirable for &quot;P. colias&quot;. However, they can be also found in less species diverse habitats such as barren rock flats (4-12m deep) that are dominated by sea urchins grazing on algae.

As mentioned before, &quot;P. colias&quot; can be found at 150 m in depth and was reported to be caught at 350m below the surface, other important aspects such as temperature, salinity and oxygen content in the ocean are often influenced by water depth. 766 samples were taken to determine the water temperature and chemistry ranges of &quot;P. colias&quot; as listed below:

==Life cycle/phenology==

===Spawning and Hatching===
Multiple spawning events of a female &quot;P. colias&quot; occur throughout late winter and spring in the centre to the outer continental shelf. Instead of a distinct spawning episode, their spawning is a continuous event that the eggs are released over time. One male can be spawning with different groups of female. Eggs could possibly drift 74 km away from the spawning site and hatch potentially after 116 hours. Young fish are found below 20 metres then move to shallow water in summer.

===Age, Growth, Sex and Maturity===
Growth of &quot;P. colias&quot; is measured by the relationship between age and their body length. &quot;P. colias&quot; are protogynous hermaphrodites, when the length of &quot;P. colias&quot; reaches 410mm, 50% of the females are transitional. Sex inversion occurs with the colour change from whitish with a brown band at both sides or an orange tinge to bluish colour with a blue green band. Though sex inversion found to occur across a wide range of age and size, the cause of activating the sex inversion has not been well understood. Studies have shown that the proportion of sex change decreases afterwards as the presence of males in the population would discourage sex change. Hence, it is regarded as a response to the demographic structure in the population instead of a response to their size. Another study indicated that blue cod is most fecund at the size which closes to the average size of the first maturity of males. It has been regarded as a sign of potential sex change by reducing egg production for saving the resource. Sex change is also not well described that the transitional gonads has different definitions.

Their growth rate can differ due to food supply, water temperature and habitat as other fish do. Sex can also influence the growth rate. Male grow faster and larger than female. &quot;P. colias&quot; have the potential to grow up to 50 cm in length and weight 4 kg. Growth ring interpretation shows that they can live about 10 to 15 years, but a study showed that the known maximum age of blue cod is 23 years old.

Maturity values are derived from the length of the fish. Their growth rate varies between locations. For example, male can reach maturity when their length reached 10–19 cm (which is about 2–3 years old) in Northland, but in Southland the male needs to reach 26–28 cm (which is about 4–6 years old). Besides, males generally have a faster growth rate compared to females. Both female and male &quot;P. colias&quot; are assumed to reach sexual maturity with the measuring of 28 cm. The maximum lifespan of &quot;P. colias&quot; is 32 years.

===Behaviours===
Similar to other &quot;Parapercis&quot; species, male &quot;P. colias&quot; hold territories and their home range increases as the individual grows. Mutch found that they tend to hold large territories rather than but loose territories with small social groups that contain three to five females. Though they hold stable territories, &quot;P. colias&quot; moves from time to time. In a study, &quot;P. colias&quot; can move with on average of 2.09±2.12 km, this could potentially be home range shifts. It is reported that &quot;P. colias&quot; emigrate from coastal to offshore waters in May of each year, this is thought to be a preparation for mating and spawning in early winter.

Thunder is known to agitate the fish. Reports since the 1950s have documented thunder activating blue cod&#x27;s flight mechanisms, causing the fish to leap out of aquariums.

===Migration===
&quot;P. colias&quot; seem to be migratory at certain times in a year, but little is known about their migration. Other studies indicated that they are relatively sedentary, however, long-term dispersal has been suggested due to a record that one individual travelled 156 km over 20 months.

== Diet and foraging ==
Many fish species are generalists; thus, they are not limited by the predator-prey cycle. &quot;P. colias&quot; is one of them. They have been recorded to have 52 taxa in their diet, where adults are found to be more selective than juveniles. It makes sense that when &quot;P. colias&quot; grows bigger, the variety of species in their diet also increases, this includes polychaetes, crustaceans, molluscs, Pisces, algae and even its own spawn! This means that &quot;P. colias&quot; are omnivores which &quot;feeds on more one trophic level&quot;. In short, you can say that they consume anything that is abundant and available locally. Other than the development of the fish itself, what they consume differs from region to region and whether the area is fished or not plays an important role as well. One study showed that oyster dredged habitat can reduce their prey diversity and have a negative effect on fish size. They usually stalk, seize and swallow their prey. After being caught, they tend to regurgitate the stomach contents.

&quot;Our Big Blue Backyard&quot; is a documentary of New Zealand marine and shoreline species. In the Chatham Islands episode, blue cod (&quot;P. colias&quot;) waits to feed on pāua, an endemic sea-snail that attaches itself on hard surfaces such as rocks, at its most vulnerable phases – when they move or are grasped up by a starfish using hundreds of tube feet. They are also said to be voracious.

== Predators, parasites, and diseases ==
=== Predators ===
&quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (humans) fish 2000 to 2500 tons of &quot;P. colias&quot; annually. Natural predators include: 
*Great white shark
*Benthic feeders, such as:
**Yellow-eyed penguins
**Dolphins 
*Sea birds, such as mollymawks

As many marine predators are generalists there are many other potential predators not listed. &quot;P. colias&quot; are known to predate upon juveniles of their own species.

=== Parasites ===
Hewitt and Hine summarised the parasites found on blue cod including species in five main groups:

Blood sucking sea lice are also known to parasitise &quot;P. colias&quot;.

=== Disease and Injuries ===
No specific disease is found on &quot;P. colias&quot;, but some injuries have been recorded. Hooking injuries could cause tissue damage and possibly lead to mortality. Despite having greater risk for parasitic, bacterial, or fungal infections, mortality after having a hook injury is often caused by blood loss rather than disease. An article suggests that small hooks cause more blood loss problems than big hooks to &quot;P. colias&quot;.

Compared to other bony fish, swimming bladder in &quot;P. colias&quot; is absent, this means that they do not suffer from barotrauma – an injury due expansion or eruption of the swimming bladder in fish, it is often caused by rapid water pressure change when rising from deep water to water surface.

==In a human context==
Rāwaru was a valued traditional food for Māori who lived in the South Island, where the fish is more abundant. Heads of rāwaru (&quot;P. colias&quot;, blue cod) were often given back to the sea as offerings to the god Maru before Māori return from fishing.

The fish was an important species to early European settlers in New Zealand as a food source, and by the 1910s became even more popular in Australia, leading to the growth of the blue cod fishing industry in Southland.

==History of the name==
Blue cod (&quot;P. colias&quot;) is not a cod. The use of blue cod can date back to the time of Captain Cook. Some early writers listed them as coal-fish which derived from unrelated European fish. However, this name is so widely used in New Zealand that it is unlikely to be changed.

==Economic and population management issue==
Blue cod is well known by the public due to its commercial and recreational importance. As mentioned before, we fish 2000 to 2500 tones of &quot;P. colias&quot; per year. The value of &quot;P. colias&quot; as being the third popular recreational fishing species cannot be ignored, this includes using their flesh as rock lobster bait. It is estimated that the marginal willingness to pay for an additional &quot;P. colias&quot; is $1.61 per fish and the average willingness to pay is $24.46 per fish. It is estimated that in 1999, 1.2 million &quot;P. colias&quot; was harvested, of which 70% were from the South Island. Thus, Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand) has set minimum capture length and maximum capture limit of &quot;P. colias&quot;, which varies between areas mainly depending on abundance, to avoid depletion. For example, in the South-East area (of South Island from Clarence Point to Southland and extended to the Chatham Islands, New Zealand), no fish shorter than 30 cm can be taken and each fisher has a limit up to 30 fish per day.

To achieve sustainable fishing, it is crucial to persist healthy population structure with continuous monitoring and quotas set to date. However, as the largest fish in the population would be the male, males are often being caught and is thought to affect the females changing their sex earlier. This is an emerging issue to all hermaphrodites. Surprisingly, the sex ratio male to females of &quot;P. colias&quot; is about 5:1 which is biologically implausible. This suggests that sex changes might not purely depend on fish length, but we cannot ignore the fact that fishery has changed the natural population composition of &quot;P. colias&quot;. To understand the direct impact on P. colias despite population decline further research is required.

In addition, the fundamental unit of concern of its management of population is the genetic structure that can lead to the reduction of the evolutionary potential for responding to environmental change, the increase of inbreeding risk and the force of selective genetic change. Since a number of evidence indicated that blue cod are relatively sedentary, the fishing pressure may lead to potential local depletion. Recent studies showed that the genetic differences were significant between mainland List of islands of New Zealand population and Chatham Island population. On the other hand, the differences within mainlandList of islands of New Zealand populations were limited while the pattern of the isolation by distance was detected. Further research using microsatellite DNA markers suggested that some significant genetic differences between mainland population exist which indicate the potential long-distance dispersal, but the dispersal rate is too low to have demographic effect in the population.

<text>Aleksandar Stoimenov Stamboliyski (; 1 March 1879 – 14 June 1923) was a Bulgarian politician who served as the Prime Minister of Bulgaria from 1919 until 1923.

Stamboliyski was a member of the Agrarian Union, an agrarian peasant movement which was not allied to the monarchy, and edited their newspaper. He opposed the country&#x27;s participation in World War I and its support for the Central Powers. In a famous incident during 1914 Stamboliyski&#x27;s patriotism was challenged when members of the Bulgarian parliament questioned whether he was Bulgarian or not, to which he shouted in response &quot;At a moment, like the current, when our brothers South Slavs are threatened, I am neither a Bulgarian nor a Serb, I am a South Slav!&quot;. This statement relates to his belief in a Balkan Federation which would unite the region and supersede many of the national identities which existed at the time. He was court-martialed and sentenced to life in prison in 1915 due to his opposition to Bulgaria joining the Central Powers in WWI.

In 1918, with the defeat of Bulgaria as an ally of the Central Powers, Tsar Ferdinand abdicated in favor of his son Tsar Boris III who released Stamboliyski from prison. He joined the government in January 1919, and was appointed prime minister on October 14 of that year. On March 20, 1920, the Agrarian Union won national elections and Stamboliyski was confirmed as prime minister.

During his term in office, Stamboliyski made a concerted effort to improve relations with the rest of Europe. This resulted in Bulgaria becoming the first of the defeated states to join the League of Nations in 1920. Though popular with the peasants, he antagonized the middle class and military. He was ousted in a military coup in June 1923. He attempted to raise a rebellion against the new government, but was captured by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, which detested him for renouncing Bulgarian national interest on the region of Macedonia, was brutally tortured, and killed.

Born to a farmer, Aleksandar Stamboliyski spent his childhood in his birth village of Slavovitsa, the same village where he would later gather several thousand insurrectionists from the region and advance against the town of Pazardzhik. However, before this grand counter-insurgence was to transpire, Stamboliyski had to work himself up the ranks of the nation&#x27;s political scene as the leader of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union. Although successful in his political ambition of acquiring the highest political office of the state, the unstable political atmosphere of Bulgaria in the early inter-war years ultimately contributed to Stamboliyski&#x27;s demise.

==Early political career==
Until the mid 20th century Bulgaria was primarily a land of small, independent peasant farmers. The proportion of the population (approximately 4/5) who were peasants was roughly the same in 1920 as it had been in 1878. The Bulgarian Agrarian National Union, or BANU, emerged in 1899 in reaction to the low standard of living facing the agrarian peasants of Bulgaria as well as the general focus on the towns and cities which marked the political situation at the turn of the twentieth century. By 1911, as the leader of the BANU, Stamboliyski was a notorious anti-monarchist and led the opposition to Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria. On September 25, 1918, in order to gain the BANU&#x27;s acceptance, the regime was forced to release a number of political detainees, most notably Aleksandar Stamboliyski, who had been sentenced to life in prison after his meeting with Tsar Ferdinand to protest the war effort on 18 September 1915; two weeks before Bulgaria entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers. When the regime released Stamboliyski from prison, it did so with the hope that he would contain the growing unrest within the army, which at that time was essentially in full rebellion and heading for Sofia. While he initially tried to quell the rebellion, his fellow agrarian party activist Rayko Daskalov, who had been sent with Stamboliyski for the same purpose, quickly joined the rebellion and became its de facto leader. Rayko Daskalov issued a declaration under his name and that of Stamboliyski, which named Bulgaria a people&#x27;s republic and the monarchy of Tsar Ferdinand was denounced and told to surrender to the new provisional government headed on paper by the BANU leader. Even though Stambolyiski had not been informed of Daskalov&#x27;s decision (his name had been added to the declaration without his knowledge) and he immediately went to Sofia to inform the government that he did not support the uprising, a warrant was issued for his arrest.

==Radomir Rebellion (1918)==
The rebellion, centered to the west of Sofia in the town of Radomir threatened to develop into a national revolution, but the movement for a new, agrarian republic was quickly eliminated due to several factors and was left without the sufficient means to bring about the change it desired. Lasting only from 28 September until 2 October, the rebellion, although short-lived, found some early success. The mutineers managed to enter Bulgaria&#x27;s capital where Tsarist forces, led by general Aleksandar Protogerov, crushed the rebellion killing an estimated 2,000 soldiers and arresting an estimated 3,000. Unlike many of his supporters, Stamboliyski was able to escape the fate of imprisonment or execution and, instead, went into hiding until he was to re-surface in the political arena during the reign of Tsar Boris III. The movement, however, could not be considered a total failure by the Agrarian Union as it was successful in eliminating the rule of Tsar Ferdinand, who fled Bulgaria by train on 3 October 1918. Ferdinand was to be succeeded by his son, Boris III, with the approval of the Allied Powers.

==Ascension to power==
After Tsar Boris III took the throne, the emerging political factions in Bulgaria were the Agrarians, the Socialists, and the Macedonian irredentists. However, due to the loss of the territory of Macedonia immediately following Bulgaria&#x27;s surrender to the Allied forces, the Macedonian faction fell out of contention leaving the Agrarian and Communist factions struggling for political supremacy. As the general election of 1919 approached, Stamboliyski came out of hiding and won the election of prime minister of the new coalition cabinet. However, because the election was so close, Stamboliyski was forced to form a government coalition between the agrarians and the left-wing parliamentary parties. By March 1920, however, Stamboliyski was able to form a solely BANU government with another decisive election victory and some tactical manipulation of the parliamentary system (common practice at the time). From his complete acquisition of power in March 1920, until his death on 14 June 1923, Stamboliyski ruled Bulgaria with a strong personality leading many to remember him as a kind of strongman, dictator, or thug. This is in spite of his electoral successes.

==Rule of Stamboliyski==

Stamboliyski&#x27;s government immediately faced pressures from the political left and right, a harsh international occupation force, debt amounting to a “preposterous sum”, as well as national problems such as food shortages, general strikes, and a great flu epidemic. His goal was to transform the political, economic, and social structures of the state while at the same time rejecting the rhetoric of radicalism and its Bolshevik associations. He aimed at establishing the rule of the peasant, which comprised over 80% of the population of Bulgaria in 1920. Part of his objective was to offer each member of the dominant group an equitable distribution of property and access to the cultural and welfare facilities in all villages. The local BANU cooperative organizations known as the &quot;Zemedelski Druzhbi&quot; (Agrarian fellowships) were to play a vital role in linking the peasant economy to the national and international markets in addition to offering the benefits of large scale agriculture without resorting to Soviet style collectivization. Stamboliyski founded the BANU Orange Guard, a peasant militia that both protected him and carried out his agrarian reforms. In foreign policy, Stamboliyski abided by the terms he helped set in the peace treaty signed at Neuilly-sur-Seine in November 1919, which was eventually exploited by the nationalist factions of Bulgaria as he failed to lessen the outstanding reparations payments until 1923. Stamboliyski rejected territorial expansion and aimed at forming a Balkan federation of agrarian states, a policy which began with a détente with Yugoslavia. His administration was successful in bringing out land redistribution legislation, creating maximum property holding regulations. It also increased the vocational element in education, especially in rural areas. Being ardently anti-war himself he kept the army below the low level set by the Neuilly treaty, further angering the military by restriction their social status and opportunities for advancement. However, importantly Stamboliyski never settled the Macedonian problem.

On February 2, 1923, Stamboliyski and three of his ministers survived an assassination attempt in the National Theater carried out by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO). On 4 June 1923 - just few days before the coup, the internal minister Hristo Stoyanov said that if someone kills Stamboliyski or some other leader of BANU &quot;the Pirin region and maybe Kystendil and the capital will look like graveyards.&quot; (Pirin Macedonia and the Kyustendil region were the center of power of IMRO in postwar Bulgaria till the 1934 coup and the banning of IMRO that followed the same year).

In 1921 a conspirative &quot;Committee for Peasant Dictatorship&quot; (Комитет за селска диктатура, &quot;Komitet za selska diktatura&quot;) was established. The committee became the Union&#x27;s de facto leadership. In 1922 by the will of the committee the militarized Orange Guard was established to guard the regime. In early 1923 BANU openly discussed the possibility of establishing an agrarianist dictatorship.

The BANU government also made an orthographical reform, simplifying the Bulgarian orthography - the so-called agrarianist or Omarchevski orthography (Омарчевски правопис, &quot;Omarchevski pravopis&quot;), named after the minister of education Stoyan Omarchevski. The agrarianist orthography was boycotted by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and many intellectuals, as well as by the opposition. Immediately after the 9 June coup, the old orthography was restored.

==Coup and assassination==
On March 23, 1923, he signed the Treaty of Niš with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and undertook the obligation to suppress the operations of the IMRO carried out from Bulgarian territory. On 9 June 1923, Stamboliyski&#x27;s government was overthrown by a coup composed of the right-wing factions of the Military League, IMRO, the National Alliance, and the army led by Aleksandar Tsankov. Italian agents sent by Mussolini in retaliation against Stamboliyski&#x27;s refusal to ally with him against Yugoslavia also aided in the coup. With the Communist faction refusing to intervene and the international community uninterested, Stamboliyski was isolated.

As important as the overthrow of Stambolyiski was for Bulgaria, the refusal of the Communist Party of Bulgaria to unite with the Stamboliyski&#x27;s Agrarians had important ideological consequences for the young Soviet Russia next door. The passivity of the Bulgarian Communists during the June 9 coup in 1923 was bitterly disappointing to nearly all factions within the Russian government and the Bolshevik Party. Stalin, who, by 1923, was gathering power in the absence of Lenin in the leadership of the new Soviet Russian government, had sought close relations with the Stamboliyski government. The Soviet government sought a means to break the ring of isolation that the western powers had erected around the new Soviet nation. Accordingly, following the Russian example, Russian Communists were strongly of the opinion that the Communists in Bulgaria should aid and support what they viewed as &quot;the liberal petty bourgeoisie&quot; —in the form of Stamboliyski&#x27;s Agrarian Party as a means to advance the interests of the workers in Bulgaria. Indeed, this was the thinking of the Fourth Congress of the Communist International which was held in Moscow in November, 1922. At the Fourth Congress, delegates instructed the Bulgarians to support the Stamboliyski government. Yet in the 1923 coup of Alexander Tsankov in June, 1923, the Bulgarian Communist Party refused to come to the aid of Stamboliyski and following the coup the Communist Party was forced &quot;underground&quot; by the Tsankovist Terror that followed the coup. The Communist International then &quot;ordered&quot; the Bulgarian Communist Party to redress this error of passivity in the face of the successful coup. Accordingly, the Bulgarian Communist Party denied that they had suffered a defeat in the June coup and rose in a hastily arranged uprising in September 1923. This uprising however was quickly defeated by the Tsankov government.

After the coup d&#x27;etat, Stamboliyski relocated to his native village of Slavovitsa. From his native village, Stamboliyski was organizing a counter-insurgence that was large in number but weak in arms. On 14 June 1923, he was taken prisoner by activists of the IMRO, brutally tortured, and murdered. The IMRO members were extremely brutal because of his signature on the Treaty of Niš. His hand that signed the Treaty of Niš was cut off. He was also blinded in his torture and his head was cut off and sent to Sofia in a box of biscuits. Besides Stamboliyski, other notable BANU representatives were killed immediately after the coup as well, such as the mayor of Sofia Krum Popov.

==Legacy==

In 1979 the then-Communist government of Bulgaria renamed the town previously known as Novi Krichim to Stamboliyski, in honour of Aleksandar Stamboliyski. A village in Haskovo province has been named after him, as well as one in Dobrich province. A reservoir in Veliko Tarnovo province has also been named after him. Aleksandar Stamboliyski boulevard is a boulevard in central Sofia.

<doc id="413779" wikidata="Q544951" url="?curid=413779" title="Moshoeshoe II of Lesotho">
<text>Moshoeshoe II (2 May 1938 – 15 January 1996), previously known as Constantine Bereng Seeiso, was the Paramount Chief of Basutoland, succeeding paramount chief Seeiso from 1960 until the country gained full independence from Britain in 1966. He was King of Lesotho from 1966 until his exile in 1990, and from 1995 until his death in 1996.

==Early life==

Moshoeshoe was born with the name Constantine Bereng Seeiso and was the descendant of the founder of the nation, Moshoeshoe I, which is where he got his royal name. The young Seeiso was educated at the Roma College in Lesotho, then (apparently fleeing rumours that his stepfather planned to poison him) was sent to England, first to Ampleforth College and later to Corpus Christi College, Oxford. While there, he took to the life of an English country gentleman, including hunting, shooting, and fishing.

==Reign==

Moshoeshoe&#x27;s political power was always limited, and his reign was interrupted twice. Early in his reign, Chief Leabua Jonathan became Prime Minister of Lesotho and gained control of the government. Jonathan suspended Moshoeshoe in 1970 to reestablish his control in the country after his party lost the election. Moshoeshoe went into temporary exile in the Netherlands. A few months later, when he gained control, Jonathan allowed Moshoeshoe to reassume the title of King. Jonathan was himself overthrown in 1986 and the King gained some power, but he was deposed in 1990, while his son Letsie III was forced to take his place as King. Moshoeshoe went to exile in the United Kingdom, but was restored to the throne in 1995. In 1996, he was killed in a car accident, and Letsie became King again a month later. 

During the political turmoil of 1970 and 1990, and for a month after his death in 1996, his wife and Letsie&#x27;s mother, &#x27;Mamohato, acted as regent.

;Summary of reign
*1960–1966: Paramount Chief Constantine Bereng Seeiso of Basutoland.
*1966: crowned as King Moshoeshoe II of Lesotho.
*1970: exiled from Lesotho.
*February 1990: stripped of constitutional powers.
*November 1990: deposed, his son Letsie III becomes king.
*1990–1992: in exile in the UK.
*January 1995: reinstated as King.
*January 1996: died, succeeded by Letsie III.

==Death==

King Moshoeshoe II died at the age of 57 in a road accident, when his car plunged off a mountain road during the early hours of 15 January 1996. The accident also killed the car&#x27;s driver. According to a government statement, Moshoeshoe had set out at 1 am to visit his cattle at Matsieng, and was returning to Maseru through the Maloti Mountains when his car left the road.

==Family==

Moshoeshoe married Princess Tabitha &#x27;Masentle Lerotholi Mojela (later known as Queen &#x27;Mamohato of Lesotho) in 1962, and with her had two sons and one daughter:

* Prince David Mohato Bereng Seeiso, subsequently King Letsie III of Lesotho (born 17 July 1963).
* Prince Seeiso Bereng Seeiso of Lesotho (born 16 April 1966).
* Princess Constance Christina &#x27;Maseeiso (24 December 1969 – 7 September 1994).

== Honours ==

=== Grand Master of the following orders===

* : Grand Master of the Most Dignified Order of Moshoeshoe (Order of Dignity).

<doc id="413785" wikidata="Q1151411" url="?curid=413785" title="Gottlieb">
<text>Gottlieb (formerly D. Gottlieb &amp; Co.) was an American arcade game corporation based in Chicago, Illinois. It is best known for creating a vast line of pinball machines and arcade games (including &quot;Q*bert&quot;) throughout much of the 20th century.

==History==
Gottlieb&#x27;s main office and plant was at 1140-50 N. Kostner Avenue until the early 1970s, when a new modern plant and office were opened at 165 W. Lake Street in Northlake, IL. A subassembly plant was also built in Fargo, ND. 

The company was established by David Gottlieb in 1927, and initially produced only pinball machines. It later expanded into various other games, including pitch-and-bats, bowling games, and eventually video arcade games (notably &quot;Reactor&quot;, &quot;Q*bert&quot; and &quot;M*A*C*H*3&quot;.)

Like other manufacturers, Gottlieb first made mechanical pinball machines, including the first successful coin-operated pinball machine &quot;Baffle Ball&quot; in 1931. Electromechanical machines were produced starting in 1935. The 1947 development of player-actuated, solenoid-driven 2-inch bats called &quot;flippers&quot; revolutionized the industry, giving players the ability to shoot the ball back up into the playfield for more points. Flippers first appeared on a Gottlieb game called &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;, designed by Harry Mabs. By this time, the games also became noted for their artwork by Roy Parker.

In the late 1950s, Gottlieb made more widespread use of numerical score reels, making multiple player games more practical than the traditional scoring expressed by cluttered series of lights in the back box. Score reels eventually appeared on single-player games, now known as &quot;wedgeheads&quot; because of their distinctive tapered back box shape. By the 1970s, artwork on Gottlieb games was almost always by Gordon Morison, and the company had begun designing their games with longer 3-inch flippers, now the industry standard.

The company made the move into solid state machines starting in the late 1970s. The first few of these were remakes of electromechanical machines such as &quot;Joker Poker&quot; and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. By that time, multiple player machines were more the mode and wedgeheads were no longer being produced. The last wedgehead was &quot;T.K.O.&quot; (1979) and the last single player machine was &quot;Asteroid Annie and The Aliens&quot; (1980).

Gottlieb was bought by Columbia Pictures in 1976. Gottlieb released &quot;Q*bert&quot; in 1982, which would become immensely successful and is an icon of the golden age of arcade games. In 1983, the year after the Coca-Cola Company had acquired Columbia, Gottlieb was renamed Mylstar Electronics, but this proved to be short-lived. By 1984 the video game industry in North America was in the middle of a shakeout and Columbia closed down Mylstar at the end of September 1984. A management group, led by Gilbert G. Pollock, purchased Mylstar&#x27;s pinball assets in October 1984 and continued the manufacture of pinball machines under a new company, Premier Technology. As a result of this a number of prototype Mylstar arcade games, which were not purchased by the investors, were never released. Premier did go on to produce one last arcade game, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Exterminator&quot;. Premier Technology, which returned to selling pinball machines under the name Gottlieb after the purchase, continued in operation until the summer of 1996.

Gottlieb&#x27;s most popular pinball machine was &quot;Baffle Ball&quot; (released mid-1931), and their final machine was &quot;Barb Wire&quot; (early 1996).

==Licensing and rights==
The 1965 machine Gottlieb&#x27;s Kings &amp; Queens is the one played by the title character in the 1975 rock opera movie &quot;Tommy&quot; about a psychosomatically blind, deaf, and mute pinball wizard. Today, Gottlieb&#x27;s pinball machines (along with those distributed under the Mylstar and Premier names), as well as the &quot;Gottlieb&quot; and &quot;D. Gottlieb &amp; Co.&quot; trademarks (USPTO registration nos. 1403592, 2292766, and 3288024, and other numbers in countries around the world), are owned by Gottlieb Development LLC of Pelham Manor, New York. Most of Gottlieb and Mylstar&#x27;s video games are currently owned by Columbia Pictures.

* &quot;Brooks N&#x27; Dunn&quot; #749 – This game was entering production just as Gottlieb shut down and ceased operations. Two prototype machines supposedly exist, although some claim the design never proceeded past the whitewood stage. Playfield components, such as plastics, ramps, mechanisms and Translites were produced for the games about to enter production; enough for about 10 games to exist. Only buggy prototype software exists and was never completed.

Gottlieb was last to introduce a solid-state system, and last to cease manufacture of electromechanical games. The first version of Gottlieb&#x27;s solid state pinball hardware was called &quot;System 1&quot;, and had many undocumented features. Designed and developed by Rockwell International&#x27;s Microelectronics Group of Newport Beach, CA with circuit board manufacturing and final assembly in El Paso, Texas. Likely it was rushed to compete with the new solid-state games from other manufacturers, particularly Bally. An entirely new platform was produced in 1980, &quot;System 80&quot;, which was refined in &quot;System 80A&quot; and &quot;System 80B&quot;. Following the System 80 platform, a new platform named &quot;System 3&quot; was first released in 1989 and was used until the company&#x27;s closure.

<doc id="413788" wikidata="Q387762" url="?curid=413788" title="Kartchner Caverns State Park">
<text>Kartchner Caverns State Park is a state park of Arizona, United States, featuring a show cave with of passages. The park is located south of the town of Benson and west of the north-flowing San Pedro River. Long hidden from view, the caverns were discovered in 1974 by local cavers, assisted by state biologist Erick Campbell who helped in its preservation.

The park encompasses most of a down-dropped block of Palaeozoic rocks on the east flank of the Whetstone Mountains.

The caverns are carved out of limestone and filled with spectacular speleothems which have been growing for 50,000 years or longer, and are still growing. Careful and technical cave state park development and maintenance, initially established by founder Dr. Bruce Randall &quot;Randy&quot; Tufts, geologist, were designed to protect and preserve the cave system throughout the park&#x27;s development, and for perpetuity.

== History ==
The caverns were discovered in 1974, when cavers Gary Tenen and Randy Tufts found a narrow crack in the bottom of a sinkhole, and followed the source of warm, moist air toward what ended up being more than of pristine cave passages.

Randy Tufts, PhD, who at the time of his death was a geologist and lunar and planetary scientist for NASA, was introduced to caving as a young boy by his maternal uncle, who was also a geologist. His uncle showed Randy caves in Arizona that had been vandalized in various ways including graffiti, litter, and the theft of stalactites and stalagmites. At the age of 13, Randy read an English children&#x27;s adventure book entitled, &quot;Five Boys in a Cave.&quot; This book inspired him. At the time he decided to find a cave that had not ever been vandalized and protect it. For years, Randy would take his college peers out to the Whetstone limestone mountain range looking for caves, walking a grid, with no success until they asked a local miner if he had ever heard of a local cave. The miner pointed to the foothills below them. There they foundand nearly fell intoa deep sink hole filled with rattlesnakes.

At the time, although they had found a sink hole and a small cave chamber, they did not think that the cave &quot;went&quot; anywhere.

It was years later when Randy was on a picnic luncheon date, that he found another sink hole. He went home to gather his caving gear and asked Gary Tenen to join him to explore the new sink hole. That new sink hole was also disappointing, but Randy and Gary decided upon a whim to return to the prior sink hole. This time they could smell bat guano, a hint that the cave might be much larger than they had originally thought. It was after crawling the length of a football field, sometimes on their bellies, with only carbide lamps for light, that they came to a very small bat hole. After chipping away at the hole for hours they entered the &quot;Big Room&quot;. While there, they realized that this discovery could place the caverns at risk.

Hoping to protect the cave from vandalism, they kept the location a secret for 14 years. After years of thought, they decided that the best way to preserve the cavernwhich was near a freewaywas to develop it as a tour cave. After gaining the cooperation of the Kartchner family and working with them for ten years, together they approached the Arizona State Parks Board. Ken Travous, the Director of the AZ state parks was instrumental in establishing the funding and resources for protecting the caverns. In 1985, The Nature Conservancy acquired an option to purchase the land. The discovery of the cave was finally made public in 1988 when the landowners sold the area to the state for development as a park and show cavern. Prior to its grand opening in 1999, the state spent $28 million on a high-tech system of air-lock doors, misting machines and other equipment designed to preserve the cave.

== Tourism information ==
The two major features of the caverns accessible to the public are the Throne Room and the Big Room. The Throne Room contains one of the world&#x27;s longest () soda straw stalactites and a high column called Kubla Khan, after the poem. The Big Room contains the world&#x27;s most extensive formation of brushite moonmilk. Big Room cave tours are closed during the summer for several months (April 15 to October 15) each year because it is a nursery roost for cave bats, however the Throne Room tours remain open year-round.

Other features publicly accessible within the caverns include Mud Flats, Rotunda Room, Strawberry Room, and Cul-de-sac Passage. Approximately 60% of the cave system is not open to the public.

The park has hiking trails on the ground above the caverns. The longest trail, the Guindani Trail, is 4.2 miles, while the shorter trail, the Foothills Loop Trail, measures 2.5 miles.

== Animal life ==
Although the cave is largely uninhabited, as many as 2000 &quot;Myotis velifer&quot; bats nest in the cave during late spring.

==Cave formations and vegetation==
Many different cave formations can be found within the caves and the surrounding park. These include cave bacon, helictites, soda straws, stalactites, stalagmites and others. Cave formations like the stalactites and stalagmites grow approximately a 16th of an inch every 100 years.

Along the Foothills Loop Trail hike, desert plants may be observed: ocotillo, creosote bush, mesquite, desert broom, acacia, wait-a-minute bush, scrub oak, barrel cactus, prickly pear, buckhorn cholla, and hackberry.

<doc id="413804" wikidata="Q240302" url="?curid=413804" title="Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg">
<text>Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (; ; 4 January 1785 – 17 February 1831) was a German-Danish prince and officer who was the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck from 1816 to 1825, and the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg from 1825 to 1831. Friedrich Wilhelm is the progenitor of the House of Glücksburg.

Friedrich Wilhelm was the only son of Friedrich Karl Ludwig, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck and Countess Friederike of Schlieben, and was a member of the ducal house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, a junior male branch of the House of Oldenburg. From 1804, he lived in his family&#x27;s original home in Denmark-Norway, where he made a career as an officer of the Danish army during the Napoleonic Wars. His 1810 marriage to Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel meant that Friedrich Wilhelm became brother-in-law to King Frederick VI of Denmark, as his wife&#x27;s elder sister was married to the king. At the death of his father in 1816, he inherited the title of Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck as Frederick William IV, and in 1825, upon the extinciton of the elder Glücksburg line in 1824, King Frederick VI transferred Glücksburg Castle to his brother-in-law and changed his title to Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.

Duke Friedrich Wilhelm and Duchess Louise Caroline had ten children, of which his eldest son Karl succeeded him as Duke of Glücksburg, and his fourth son became King of Denmark in 1863 as King Christian IX.

== Early life ==
=== Birth and family ===

Friedrich Wilhelm was born on 4 January 1785 at the manor house in Lindenau, near the town of Braunsberg in East Prussia, the most northeastern province of the Kingdom of Prussia (today Lipowina in Poland). He was the third and youngest child and only son of Friedrich Karl Ludwig, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck (1757–1816) and his wife, Countess Friederike of Schlieben (1757–1827). He was baptized with the names &quot;Frederick William Paul Leopold&quot; and had his distant relative, Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark (later King Frederick VI), as his godfather.

Prince Friedrich Wilhelm&#x27;s father was the head of the ducal house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, a junior male branch of the House of Oldenburg. The family descended from King Christian III of Denmark&#x27;s younger son, John the Younger, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg, whose grandson Duke August Philipp severed his ties with Denmark and emigrated to Germany. There he acquired the manor of Haus Beck in Westphalia, after which the lineage was named Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck. His sons and their descendants went into Prussian, Polish and Russian service. Most recently, both Friedrich Wilhelm&#x27;s father and grandfather held important positions in the Royal Prussian Army.

=== Childhood and education ===
Prince Friedrich Wilhelm grew up with his two sisters at Lindenau, where he received his first education at home. In 1798, Wilhelm&#x27;s father retired from his Prussian military service in Königsberg and settled in Leipzig to study for a few years. At the same time, the thirteen year old Prince Friedrich Wilhelm was sent to the Knight academy in Brandenburg an der Havel where he received his education from 1798 to 1802, after which he studied at the University of Leipzig from 1803 under the supervision of the father.
Although Friedrich Wilhelm&#x27;s ancestors had been in Prussian service, the father was no longer on good terms with the Prussian king due to some unfortunate dispositions, and therefore wanted to find career opportunities for his son elsewhere. In 1804, his father sent him to the family&#x27;s original home in Denmark-Norway. Already in 1803, the boy&#x27;s godfather, Crown Prince Frederick, had appointed him rittmeister à la suite in the Royal Horse Guards and the following year he moved to Copenhagen where he was housed in the Royal Horse Guards Barracks by Frederiksholms Kanal in central Copenhagen.

=== Military career ===
Subsequently, he made a career as an officer of the Danish army during the Napoleonic Wars. After just one year in Copenhagen, Friedrich Wilhelm was, at his own request, transferred to the Duchy of Holstein, where the Danish army maintained guard duty along the Danish monarchy&#x27;s southern border. From 1805 to 1807, he served there as second rittmeiser in the Life Regiment Dragoons, where he took part in guarding the border and several times had the opportunity to demonstrate good military skills, especially in reconnaissance. However, after the British bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807, Denmark allied with France and the army was transferred to Zealand, just as Friedrich Wilhelm also returned to service in the capital.

== Marriage ==

In 1809, Friedrich Wilhelm was appointed a major at the general staff of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, and was quartered with the army&#x27;s chief of staff, Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel, at Gottorp Castle. There, he met Prince Carl&#x27;s youngest daughter and his distant relative, the twenty year old Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel (28 September 1789 – 13 March 1867), who was a granddaughter of Frederik V of Denmark through her mother, Princess Louise of Denmark. Friedrich Wilhelm and Louise Caroline were engaged in November 1809, and were married on 26 January 1810 in the chapel of Gottorp Castle. The wedding was a quiet wartime wedding without the participation of Friedrich Wilhelm&#x27;s parents or his godfather, King Frederick VI.

This marriage meant that Friedrich Wilhelm had now also become brother-in-law to King Frederick VI of Denmark, as his new wife&#x27;s elder sister, Marie of Hesse-Kassel, was married to the king. Friedrich Wilhelm and Louise Caroline had ten children.

== Duke ==

On 25 March 1816, Friedrich Wilhelm succeeded his father as Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck. On 6 July 1825, King Frederick VI transferred Glücksburg Castle to his brother-in-law and changed his title to Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, after the elder Glücksburg line had become extinct in 1824. Friedrich Wilhelm died just aged 46 on 17 February 1831 at Gottorp Castle.

== Legacy ==
Duke Friedrich Wilhelm is the progenitor of the House of Glücksburg and founded a line that includes the Royal Houses of Denmark, Greece, Norway, and the Commonwealth realms.

His grandchildren include among others Frederik VIII of Denmark, Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom, George I of Greece, Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia, Crown Princess Thyra of Hanover, Duchess of Cumberland and Teviotdale, and Friedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein.

<text>Faina Chiang Fang-liang (; born Faina Ipatyevna Vakhreva; ; ; 15 May 1916 – 15 December 2004) was the First Lady of the Republic of China on Taiwan from 1978 to 1988 as the wife of President Chiang Ching-kuo.

== Early life ==
On 15 May 1916, Faina was born near Orsha, then part of the Russian Empire (now in Belarus). Faina was orphaned at a young age and raised by her older sister Anna.

== Career ==
At age 16, as a member of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Communist Youth League, Faina worked at the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant in Sverdlovsk, Russian SFSR, where she met Chiang Ching-kuo, her supervisor. On 15 March 1935, aged 18, Faina married him.

== Move to Taiwan ==

In December 1936, Joseph Stalin granted Chiang&#x27;s return to China. After the couple was received by Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Soong Mei-ling in Hangzhou, they traveled to the Chiang home in Xikou, Zhejiang, where they held a second marriage ceremony. Fang-liang stayed behind to live with Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s mother, Mao Fumei. She was assigned a tutor to learn Mandarin Chinese, but she learned the local Ningbo dialect of Wu Chinese instead. She reportedly got along well with Mao Fumei and did her own housework.

=== As First lady ===
When Chiang Ching-kuo became President, Fang-liang rarely performed the traditional roles of First Lady, partly due to her lack of formal education; her husband also encouraged her not to get into politics. She taught Russian language occasionally to KMT cadets. She largely stayed out of the public spotlight, and little was ever known of her in an anti-communist atmosphere in the government. She never returned to Russia, and traveled abroad only three times in the last 50 years of her life, all to visit her children and their families. In 1992, she received a visit from a Belarusian delegation.

=== Children ===
On 14 December 1935, their first son Chiang Hsiao-wen was born in the Soviet Union. Each of her three younger children were born in different parts of China, reflecting turbulent years as an official of the country. Faina had four children:

* Chiang Hsiao-wen (b. 1935, Sverdlovsk)
* Chiang Hsiao-chang (b. 1938 in Nanchang)
* Chiang Hsiao-wu (b. 1945 in Chekiang)
* Chiang Hsiao-yung (b. 1948 in Shanghai)

All her children were sent to study in foreign universities - Hsiao-wu to West Germany and the remaining children to the United States. All three sons died shortly after Ching-kuo&#x27;s death in 1988: Hsiao-wen in 1989, Hsiao-wu in 1991, and Hsiao-yung in 1996. Fang-liang then lived in the suburbs of Taipei. She received occasional visitors, such as some prominent politicians who went to pay their respects every few years. In the Taiwanese media, if she ever received coverage, she was depicted as a virtuous wife who never complained and endured her loneliness with dignity.

=== Death and funeral===
Chiang died of respiratory and cardiac failure stemming from lung cancer at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital on 15 December 2004, at the age of 88 (or 89 according to East Asian age reckoning).

Chiang&#x27;s funeral was held on 27 December 2004, with President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu in attendance. Kuomintang politicians Wang Jin-pyng, Lin Cheng-chih, P. K. Chiang, and Ma Ying-jeou draped her casket with the Kuomintang party flag, and Kuomintang party elders Lee Huan, Hau Pei-tsun, Chiu Chuang-huan, and Shih Chi-yang draped her casket with the ROC national flag.
Chiang was cremated and her ashes taken to her husband&#x27;s temporary mausoleum in Touliao, Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City). They were buried together in the Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery.

<doc id="413811" wikidata="Q1054214" url="?curid=413811" title="Centre for Policy Studies">
<text>The Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) is a centre-right think tank and advocacy group in the United Kingdom. Its goal is to promote coherent and practical policies based on its founding principles of: free markets, &quot;small state,&quot; low tax, national independence, self determination and responsibility. While being independent, the centre has historical links to the Conservative Party.

It was co-founded by Sir Keith Joseph, Alfred Sherman and Margaret Thatcher in 1974 to challenge the post war consensus of Keynesianism, and to champion economic liberalism in Britain. With this in mind Keith Joseph originally wanted the think tank to study the social market economy, naming it the &#x27;Ludwig Erhard Foundation&#x27; and &#x27;Institute for a social market economy&#x27; until it was eventually settled on the benign &#x27;Centre for Policy Studies&#x27;.

The centre has since played a global role in the dissemination of free market economics alongside policy proposals claimed to be on the basis of responsibility and individual choice. It also asserts that it prioritises the concepts of duty, family, liberty, and the rule of law. The CPS states that it has a goal of serving as &quot;the champion of the small state.&quot;

==Influence==
The CPS sought reassessment of Conservative economic policy during the period in opposition from 1974 to 1979. The CPS released reports such as &quot;Stranded on the Middle Ground? Reflections on Circumstances and Policies&quot; and &quot;Monetarism is Not Enough&quot; (1974 and 1976). &quot;Monetarism is Not Enough&quot; was described by Margaret Thatcher as “one of the very few speeches which have fundamentally affected a political generation&#x27;s way of thinking.&quot;. Keith Joseph&#x27;s keynote speeches, also published by the CPS, aimed to lead the way in changing the climate of opinion in Britain and set the intellectual foundations for the privatisation reforms of the 1980s. In 1981 Sherman brought the Swiss monetarist Jurg Niehans over to Britain to advise on economic management. Niehans wrote a report critical of the government&#x27;s economic management that was crucial in influencing the change of policy in the 1981 budget; this tightened the government&#x27;s fiscal stance to make possible a looser monetary policy. However Hugh Thomas, who had been appointed Chairman of the CPS in 1979 found Sherman impossible to work with. In the summer of 1983, following a row over the relationship of the CPS with the Conservative Party, Sherman was summarily sacked from the CPS in a &quot;virulent&quot; letter from Thomas.

The CPS did not consciously represent itself as a partisan institute; ‘blame’ for the collectivist post-war consensus was placed on both sides of the political parties for operating within the same ideological framework. The CPS continually advocated a liberal economic approach and was hugely influential during Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s administration, operating as a key driving force towards her hallmark policies of privatisation, deregulation and monetarism

In her own words, its job was to &#x27;expose the follies and self-defeating consequences of government intervention...&#x27;to think the unthinkable&#x27;. In 1982, it released &quot;Telecommunications in Britain&quot;, which urged the Government to embrace a fuller agenda of privatization in the telecoms sector. The paper recommended the privatization of British Telecom and the introduction of competition to the sector –both of which were implemented. Another key publication was &quot;The Performance of the Privatised Industries&quot; (1996) – a four volume statistical analysis which showed how the privatization agenda had benefitted the consumer by ushering in lower prices and higher quality service. It argued that the taxpayer had benefitted greatly from privatisation – not just from the initial windfall from receipts, but also from higher tax revenues than had ever been received from the same companies when they were in state ownership.

According to the &quot;2014 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report&quot; (Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania), CPS is number 89 (of 150) in the &quot;Top Think Tanks Worldwide (U.S. and non-U.S.)&quot; and number 69 (of 80) in the &quot;Top Think Tanks in Western Europe&quot;.

== Funding ==
Think tank Transparify, which is funded by the Open Society Foundations, ranked the CPS as one of the four least transparent think tanks in the UK in relation to funding. Transparify&#x27;s report &quot;How Transparent are Think Tanks about Who Funds Them 2016?&quot; rated them as &#x27;highly opaque,&#x27; one of &#x27;a handful of think tanks that refuse to reveal even the identities of their donors.

In November 2022, the funding transparency website Who Funds You? gave the CPS an E grade, the lowest transparency rating (rating goes from A to E).

==History==
In 2009, the CPS celebrated its 35th anniversary for which the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron MP, gave a speech highlighting the role the CPS played in the Conservative Party&#x27;s victory in the 1979 election crediting them with ‘a great rebirth of intellectual ideas, of intellectual vigour, and of intellectual leadership’

===Reports===
In September 2011 the CPS published &quot;Guilty Men&quot; by Peter Oborne and Frances Weaver. The report sought to identify the politicians, institutions and commentators who the authors felt had tried to take Britain into the European single currency and claims to expose attacks carried out by the Euro supporters. Oborne particularly identifies William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Lord Owen as three voices of opposition to early Euro entry that suffered personal attacks from these sources.

In October 2011, Andrew Tyrie MP&#x27;s &quot;After the Age of Abundance&quot; influenced the Chancellor&#x27;s conference speech and subsequent Treasury policy.

Dominic Raab MP&#x27;s November 2011 paper &quot;Escaping the Strait Jacket&quot; called for the number one economic and social priority for the Coalition beyond deficit reduction to be to encourage job creation. He called for 10 employment regulation reforms, including excluding small businesses from a range of regulations and creating a new &#x27;no fault dismissal&#x27;, recommendations that have found much support in the Conservative Party.

&#x27;How to Cut Corporation Tax&#x27; by David Martin and &quot;Taxing Mansions: the taxation of high value property&quot; by Lucian Cook were published prior to the Budget 2012 and respectively made arguments for a lower rate of corporation tax and against the proposed &#x27;mansion tax&#x27;.

George Trefgarne&#x27;s &#x27;Metroboom: lessons from Britain&#x27;s recovery in the 1930s&#x27; sought to revise the perception of the decade as universally destitute, a view attributed to Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls. Trefgarne presented a BBC Daily Politics Soapbox piece on the recovery experienced under the National Government of the time.

In May 2012, Ryan Bourne and Thomas Oechsle published &quot;Small is a Best&quot;, a report claiming that economies with small governments tend to grow faster than those with big governments.

In June 2012, the CPS published Tim Morgan&#x27;s &quot;The Quest for Change and Renewal&quot;. Morgan says the paper in on how to &quot;... rescue capitalism and re-empower the individual to a build a winning centre-right ideology ...&quot;.

===Projects===
CapX was founded by the CPS on 21 June 2014 in collaboration with Signal Media.

==Policies==

Economy – The CPS ‘believes in regulation that does not inhibit the growth of business, taxes that do not act as a disincentive to work or to investment in the UK, and a leaner more effective state that avoids unnecessary intervention in the economy’.

Family – The CPS advocates that fiscal policy should be reformed to support marriage through the tax system and to remove the welfare penalty on two-parent families. State intervention in family life should focus on protection of vulnerable children; it should not extend to managing their day-to-day lives and removing responsibility and judgment from parents.

Energy – Recent CPS publications have argued that the UK must develop its nuclear, clean coal (including coal gasification) and efficient renewable supplies of energy.

Public Services – The CPS has been a consistent advocate for greater choice and diversity of provision, opening up state monopolies to new providers and putting greater power and responsibility in the hands of parents and patients.

Drugs – The CPS’ Prison and Addiction forum (PANDA) was set up in 2008. It provides an independent forum of debate about drugs policy for academics, practitioners, psychiatrists, and specialist commentators. Its aim is to identify the reforms required in the UK to get our drug problem under control, to prevent drug use and to offer substance abusers the help and necessary care to combat their abuse.

Broadcasting – The CPS believes that public intervention should be focussed on where there is genuine &#x27;market failure&#x27; and the remit and funding of the BBC should reflect this.

<text>Conservative Way Forward (CWF) is a British pressure ad campaigning group, which is Thatcherite in its outlook and agenda. Margaret Thatcher was its founding president.

Conservative Way Forward was founded in 1991 to &quot;defend and build upon the achievements of the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s leadership, and to adapt the principles of her era in government to modern concerns and challenges&quot;.

The group organises speaker meetings, seminars and receptions, supported and attended by Government Ministers past and future.

In all leadership elections since 1997, the candidate supported by Conservative Way Forward has ultimately won.

Conservative Way Forward is to be relaunched in 2022 by MP Steve Baker who will be its new chairman.

==Margaret Thatcher Library==
On 14 April 2013, the group announced that it was setting up a Margaret Thatcher Library as a permanent memorial to the former prime minister. The project will be based on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California, and has the support of several current and former Conservative cabinet members. It is expected to run training courses for young Conservatives and exchange student programmes to the US and elsewhere, as well as house artifacts from her premiership.

==Officers==
In December 2015 Paul Abbott resigned as chief executive, and Donal Blaney resigned as chairman, following the suicide of Elliott Johnson soon after being made redundant as an employee of Conservative Way Forward. This followed the resignations of Minister of State for International Development Grant Shapps, and the expulsion from the Conservative Party of Mark Clarke, following allegations of bullying of Elliott Johnson.

<text>Vijayadashami (), more commonly known as Dassahra in Hindi-Urdu, and also known as Dashāhra or [[Dashain]] in Bhojpuri, Maithili and Nepali, is a major Hindu festival celebrated every year at the end of Durga Puja and Navarahtri. It is observed on the tenth day of the month of Ashvin, the seventh in the Hindu lunisolar calendar. The festival typically falls in the Gregorian calendar months of September and October, more specifically between 27 September and 26 October. It is celebrated on the tenth day of the waxing moon (Shukla Paksha) of the Ashvayuja month.

Vijayadashami is observed for different reasons and celebrated differently in various parts of India and Nepal. In the southern, eastern, northeastern, and some northern states of India, Vijayadashami marks the end of Durga Puja, commemorating goddess Durga&#x27;s victory against Mahishasura to restore and protect &quot;dharma&quot;. In the northern, central, and western states, it marks the end of Ramlila and commemorates the deity Rama&#x27;s victory over Ravana. Alternatively, it marks a reverence for one of the aspects of Durga.

Vijayadashami celebrations include processions to a river or ocean front that involve carrying clay statues of Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, and Kartikeya, accompanied by music and chants, after which the images are immersed in the water for dissolution and farewell. In other places, towering effigies of Ravana, symbolising evil, are burnt with fireworks, marking evil&#x27;s destruction. The festival also starts the preparations for Diwali, the important festival of lights, which is celebrated twenty days after Vijayadashami.

==Etymology==
 () is a compound of the two words () and (), connoting the festival on the tenth day celebrating the victory of good over evil. The same Hindu festival-related term, however, takes different forms in different regions of India and Nepal, as well as among Hindu minorities found elsewhere.

The word &quot;dussehra&quot; is the British English spelling of the tadbhava &quot;Dassehrā&quot;. It is derived (), which is a Sanskrit compound word composed of () and ().

== Epic literature ==
The celebration of this festival is founded in the epic Ramayana. It marks the day Rama is regarded to have slain the rakshasa king Ravana, who had abducted Rama&#x27;s wife, Sita. Ravana kidnaps Sita and takes her to his kingdom in Lanka (identified with present day Sri Lanka). Rama asks Ravana to release her, but Ravana refuses; the situation escalates and leads to war. Prior to this, Ravana performed severe penance for ten thousand years and received a boon from the creator-god Brahma that he could henceforth not be killed by gods, demons, or spirits. However, Rama (a human incarnation of Vishnu) defeats and kills him, thus circumventing the boon given by Brahma. A battle takes place between Rama and Ravana, in which Rama kills Ravana and ends his evil rule. As a result, &quot;dharma&quot; was established on Earth because of Rama&#x27;s victory over Ravana. The festival commemorates the victory of good over evil.

In the Mahabharata, Vijayadashami also marks the day that the Pandava warrior Arjuna defeats the Kauravas. The epic tells the story of the Pandava brothers who are known to have spent their thirteenth year of exile under concealed identity in Matsya, the kingdom of Virata. Before going to Virata, they are known to have hung their celestial weapons in a &quot;shami&quot; tree for safekeeping for a year. It was during this time that Kauravas decided to attack the kingdom in which Arjuna retrieved the weapons from the Shami tree and defeated the entire Kaurava army.

==Regional variations==
===Northern India===

In most of Northern India, Vijayadashami is celebrated in honour of Lord Rama. In many places, the &quot;Ramlila,&quot; a dramatic performance on story of Rama is enacted over the 9 days leading up to the festival. The performance is inspired from the Ramcharitmanas, a Hindu text written by Tulsidas. Effigies of the demons Ravana, Kumbhakarna and Meghnath are also created and burnt on bonfires in the evening. In other cities, such as Varanasi, the entire story is freely acted out by performance-artists before the public every evening for a month.

The performance arts tradition during the Dussehra festival was inscribed by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) as one of the &quot;Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity&quot; in 2008. It is celebrated across Northern India for Dussehra, but particularly in historically important Hindu cities of Ayodhya, Varanasi, Vrindavan, Almora, Satna and Madhubani. The festival and dramatic enactment of the virtues versus vices filled story is organised by communities in hundreds of small villages and towns, attracting a mix of audiences from different social, gender and economic backgrounds. In many parts of India, the audience and villagers join in and participate spontaneously, helping the artists, others helping with stage setup, make-up, effigies, and lights. These arts come to a close on the night of Dussehra, when the victory of Rama is celebrated by burning the effigies of the evil Ravana and his allies.

====Himachal Pradesh====

Kullu Dussehra is celebrated in the Kullu valley of Himachal Pradesh and is regionally notable for its large fair and parade witnessed by an estimated half a million people. The festival is a symbol of victory of good over evil by Raghunath, and is celebrated like elsewhere in the Indian subcontinent with a procession. The special feature of the Kullu Dussehra procession is the arrival of floats containing deities from different parts of the nearby regions and their journey to Kullu.

===Southern India===

Vijayadashami is celebrated in a variety of ways in Southern India. Celebrations range from worshipping Durga, lighting up temples and major forts such as at Mysore, to displaying colourful figurines, known as a &quot;gombe habba&quot;.

The festival played a historical role in the 14th-century Vijayanagara Empire, where it was called &quot;Mahanavami&quot;. The Italian traveller Niccolò de&#x27; Conti described the festival&#x27;s intensity and importance as a grandeur religious and martial event with royal support. The event revered Durga as the warrior goddess (some texts refer to her as Chamundeshwari). The celebrations hosted athletic competitions, singing and dancing, fireworks, a pageantry military parade and charitable giving to the public. Portuguese travellers like Domingo Paes and Fernao Nuniz who visited Vijayanagara Empire in the 16th century described the Dasara elephant procession and the Vajra Mushti Kalaga wrestling bouts.

The city of Mysore has traditionally been a major center of Dasara-Vijayadashami celebrations.

This festival is called Dasara in Karnataka and the 10 day festival is celebrated as Shara navaratri where the Goddess in every temple is worshiped for 10 days in 10 forms with different Alankar/forms to signify different Goddesses avatar. Many cultural programs and competitions are organized in many cities like Mysuru, Shivamoga, Bengaluru etc. On the evening of the last day of the ten-festival, the temple&#x27;s Goddesses are taken in a procession to mark victory over evil and the completion of the war. People of Karnataka exchange leaves of Shami tree as symbol of gold on 10th day evening marking the win over demon.
Another Navaratri tradition in Karnataka has been decorating a part of one&#x27;s home with art dolls called Gombe or Bombe, similar to Golu dolls of Tamil Nadu. An art-themed Gaarudi Gombe, featuring folk dances that incorporate these dolls, is also a part of the celebration.

Another significant and notable tradition of several Southern Indian regions has been the dedication of this festival to Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of knowledge, learning, music and arts. She is worshipped along with instruments of one&#x27;s trade during this festival. In Southern India, people maintain, clean and worship their instruments, tools of work and implements of their livelihood during this festival, remembering Goddess Saraswati and Durga.

In Kerala, Vidyarambham festival is celebrated on Vijaya Dasami day. It is also known as Saraswati Puja Day. Major temple associated with Vidyarambham are Cherpu Thiruvullakkavu Temple Thrissur and Panachikkad Temple. A guru draws Om Hari Sree Ganapathaye Namah on the tongue of a child using a ring dipped in honey.Child is guided to write Hari Sree mantra on rice kept in Uruli. Children aged 3–4 who are new to school are admitted to school and Anganawadi on Vijayadashami Day.

===Western India===


In Gujarat, people engage the popular festival, Navaratri, a nine-day festival that takes places before Vijayadashami. Both the goddess Durga and Rama are revered for their victory over evil. Fasting and prayers at temples are common. A regional dance called &quot;Dandiya Raas&quot;, that deploys colourfully decorated sticks, and &quot;garba,&quot; (another type of regional dance) is a part of the festivities through the night.

The Gondi people instead celebrate Ravana by carrying an image of him riding an elephant and singing praises to him, as they consider Ravana as their ancestor and one of their gods.
In Goa, this festival is locally known as &quot;Dasro&quot; in Konkani. It marks Durga&#x27;s victory over the demon Mahishasura. Insignia known as &quot;Taranga&quot; play an important role in the festivities, which are sacred umbrellas that symbolize the village deities. At many temples, a dance of the Tarangas is held. Oracles are associated with Dasara in Goa. On this day, a ritual called &quot;Seemollanghan&quot; of the deities is held. For this people make a symbolic crossing of the border of their village. The icons of deities are carried in a grand procession. The tradition traces its roots to ancient times when kings would cross the border of their kingdom to wage war with the neighbouring kingdom. After Seemollanghan, there is a tradition wherein people exchange &quot;Aaptyachi pana&quot;. These leave symbolise gold and the ritual is a symbolic representation of the exchange of gold.

The festival is also celebrated as a harvest festival by farmers and has an important association with Agricultural activities. At Dussehra, Kharif crops like rice, guar, cotton, soybean, maize, finger millet, pulses are generally ready for harvest, farmers begin their harvest on the day. Farmers bring crops like Kharif crops from their fields for further processing and for trade. Due to this, daily arrivals of these crops in markets of the country normally increases significantly during this period.

The festival has been historically important in Maharashtra. Maratha forces in 17th and 18th centuries including those of Shivaji and the Peshwas would start their new military campaigns on Dasara. In North Maharashtra this festival is known as &quot;Dasara&quot;, and on this day people wear new clothes, and touch feet of elderly people and deities of the village temple. The deities installed on the first day of Navaratri are immersed in water. Observers visit each other and exchange sweets. Many communities in Maharashtra including the tribal communities of warli and Kokna exchange leaves of Apta tree as symbol of gold.

In Mewar region of Rajasthan, both Durga and Rama have been celebrated on Vijayadashami, and it has been a major festival for Rajput warriors.

===Eastern India===

In West Bengal Vijaya Dashami is observed as Bijoya Dashomi, immediately after Navami (the ninth and last day of Durga Puja). It is marked by processions in which idols are carried in carriages to a pond, river or ocean for a solemn good-bye to Goddess Durga, along with firecracker bursting, dance, drum beats, music and revelry. Many mark their faces with vermilion (&quot;sindoor&quot;) or wear red clothing. It is an emotional day for some devotees, especially the Bengali Hindus, and even for many atheists as the congregation sings goodbye songs. When the procession reaches the water, the clay statues of Durga and her four children are immersed; the clay dissolves and they are believed to return to Mount Kailasha with Shiva, and to the cosmos in general. People distribute sweets and gifts and visit friends, relatives and family members to wish them &quot;Subho Vijaya&quot;. Some communities such as those near Varanasi mark the eleventh day, called &quot;ekadashi&quot;, by visiting a Durga temple.

In Bihar Dushehra is celebrated over a period of 10 days. The people worship goddess durga and they setup idols in different places. On the 10th day that is Vijaya Dashmi effigy of Ravana is burnt. In Patna the capital of Bihar, people gather in historical Gandhi Maidan and a huge effigy of Ravan is burnt.

==Nepal==

In Nepal, Vijayadashami follows the festival of Dashain. Youngsters visit the elders in their family, distant ones come to their native homes, students visit their school teachers, and government workers visit the head of the state. The elders and teachers welcome the youngsters and bless them for virtuous success and prosperity in the year ahead. Elders give &quot;Dakshina&quot;, or a small amount of money, to younger relatives at this time along with the blessings. It is celebrated for 15 days from Shukla Paksha to Poornima. The red tika or simply tika symbolizes the blessings of goddess durga. Red also symbolizes the blood that ties the family together

The episode features the first appearance of Sarek (Mark Lenard) and Amanda (Jane Wyatt), the parents of Spock, and also introduces two new species, the Andorians and the Tellarites.

==Plot==
&quot;Enterprise&quot;, under the command of Captain Kirk, is transporting Federation ambassadors to a conference on the planet Babel to discuss the admission of the Coridan system into the Federation. The system is a prime source of dilithium crystals, but is underpopulated and unprotected, a situation some would prefer to maintain by keeping Coridan out of the Federation.

Sarek, who is a Vulcan ambassador, boards the ship with his human wife Amanda, ignoring Spock&#x27;s greeting. Captain Kirk learns that Sarek is in fact Spock&#x27;s father, now estranged because he had disapproved of his son&#x27;s decision to join Starfleet rather than attend the Vulcan Science Academy.

During a reception for the passengers, the Tellarite ambassador, Gav, demands to know Sarek&#x27;s position on Coridan. Pushed for a response, Sarek refers to the need to protect Coridan from unauthorized mining operations, with which Tellarite ships have been involved. Gav takes offense at the allegation and the confrontation briefly becomes physical before Kirk intervenes, warning all parties to keep order on his ship.

Meanwhile, Communications Officer Lt. Uhura has detected an encoded transmission beamed from &quot;Enterprise&quot; to a fast-moving vessel at the extreme edge of sensor range. Shortly afterward, Ambassador Gav is found murdered, his neck broken by what Spock describes as an ancient Vulcan method of execution called &quot;Tal-Shaya&quot;, casting suspicion on Sarek. During questioning, Sarek suffers a cardiovascular event, and is rushed to the sickbay, where Chief Medical Officer McCoy determines that he requires immediate surgery. Because there is a shortage of his rare T-negative-type blood, Spock volunteers to donate some of his own blood for the operation, using an experimental stimulant for increased blood production.

Plans for the procedure come to a halt when Thelev, a member of the Andorian delegation, stabs Captain Kirk. Kirk subdues Thelev but is seriously wounded and taken to Sickbay, while Thelev is imprisoned in the brig. In accordance with regulations, and despite Amanda&#x27;s emotional plea, Spock refuses to serve as the blood donor and turn command of &quot;Enterprise&quot; over to another officer, as the situation is too critical and command regulations are silent on the matter of personal privilege.

Hearing of Spock&#x27;s refusal to relinquish command, and having recovered sufficiently to be able to walk, Kirk returns to the bridge to relieve Spock and order him to Sickbay, intending to turn command over to Mr. Scott and then hide out in his quarters until the operation is completed. When Uhura picks up another encoded transmission from inside &quot;Enterprise&quot; and traces the source to the brig, Kirk decides to stay on the bridge. When Thelev is searched, it is discovered that one of his antennae is fake and conceals a small transceiver.

The unidentified vessel closes in and attacks, moving too quickly for &quot;Enterprise&quot; to lock on with phasers. The ship takes several hits from the attacking vessel. McCoy begins the operation on Sarek, who is receiving blood directly from Spock. Kirk orders Thelev brought to the bridge and questions him about himself and the attacking ship; Thelev is unresponsive. Kirk decides on a ruse, shutting down internal power to make &quot;Enterprise&quot; appear crippled. The attacker approaches and drops to sublight speed, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; damages it with a surprise phaser attack. The disabled ship self-destructs. Thelev reveals that both he and the ship were on suicide missions; he then collapses and dies from a delayed-action poison.

Kirk returns to Sickbay for further care and finds Spock and Sarek both alert, the surgery an apparent success. Spock speculates that Thelev and the attacking ship were of Orion origin, and the speed and power of the latter were consistent with a suicide mission, with all energy dedicated to attack. Thelev&#x27;s mission aboard &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Kirk and Spock presume, was to sow distrust among the Federation members and weaken &quot;Enterprise&quot; prior to the attack. In support of this theory is the fact that Orion has been raiding Coridan, and would profit by selling dilithium to both sides in a war. Amanda asks Sarek to thank Spock for saving his life, but Sarek shrugs and says that it was only logical. Amanda expresses anger at this harping on logic, and Spock, noting his mother&#x27;s exasperation, asks Sarek why he married her. Sarek replies, &quot;At the time, it seemed the &quot;logical&quot; thing to do,&quot; and offers Amanda his hand in a ritual gesture of affection. McCoy then firmly orders Kirk and Spock to remain quietly in bed, finally getting the last word.

==Production==
Wyatt had been widely known for the 1950s sitcom &quot;Father Knows Best,&quot; where she played Elinor Donahue&#x27;s mother. The episode which first aired the week prior to this episode, &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, featured Donahue as a guest actor, playing Commissioner Nancy Hedford, who became Zefram Cochrane&#x27;s &quot;Companion.&quot;

This episode introduced the Andorian and Tellarite species. John Wheeler, the actor who played the Tellarite ambassador, Gav, had difficulty seeing through the eye holes in his prosthetic makeup and was forced to raise his head in a seemingly arrogant manner in order to see the other actors. The Andorian antennae (sprouting out of the back of the head in this and other episodes of the original series) were depicted in the later &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; series as coming out of the forehead and capable of movement.

==Reception==
In 1996, for the franchise&#x27;s 30th anniversary, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;Journey to Babel&quot; No. 5 on its list of the 10 best &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes.

Io9&#x27;s 2014 listing of the top 100 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes placed &quot;Journey to Babel&quot; as the 39th best episode of all series up to that time, out of over 700 episodes; they noted this episode introduces Spock&#x27;s parents and has a focus on diplomacy.

In 2015, SyFy ranked this episode as one of the top ten essential &quot;Star Trek&quot; original series Spock episodes. The next year, they also ranked guest stars Mark Lenard, as Sarek, and Jane Wyatt, as Amanda, as the third best guest stars on the original series.

In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; rated &quot;Journey to Babel&quot; as the 15th best episode of the original series. The episode introduced Spock&#x27;s parents, Sarek and Amanda, who never again appeared in the series, but became major characters across the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Sarek is the father of Spock&#x27;s half-brother Sybok (introduced in &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;), and both adopted Michael Burnham (introduced in &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;) as an older sister to Spock.

In 2016, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ranked this episode the ninth best live-action episode of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, citing &quot;the tricky politics&quot; of Spock&#x27;s family, the Federation politics, and Mark Lenard&#x27;s performance as Sarek.

In 2016, &quot;Business Insider&quot; ranked &quot;Journey to Babel&quot; the 7th best episode of the original series.

In 2016, &quot;Newsweek&quot; ranked &quot;Journey to Babel&quot; as one of the best episodes of the original series. They note the episode features the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise aliens, Vulcans, Andorians, and Tellarites in additions to humans going to a space conference. They note the episode is a sort of teaching moment, about the Federation, politics, and Spock&#x27;s relationship with his parents.

In 2016, Vox rated this one of the top 25 essential episodes of all &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In 2017, Inverse recommended &quot;Journey to Babel&quot; as &quot;essential watching&quot; for &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

In 2019, &quot;Nerdist&quot; included this episode on their &quot;Best of Spock&quot; binge-watching guide.

In 2020, &quot;ScreenRant&quot; ranked this the 8th best episode of the original series (TOS), praising it for having &quot;a bit of everything that makes TOS great. Creative and interesting aliens, political tension and resolution, personal drama, and high-stakes adventure.&quot;

In 2021, &quot;CBR&quot; said that &quot;Journey to Babel&quot; was an &quot;essential episode&quot; of the original series, stating, &quot;″Journey to Babel&#x27; brings the action, drama and fun in an excellent showcase of what the series is capable of,&quot; and noting the two interesting plots: one of political intrigue and another of father-son relationship.

<doc id="413832" wikidata="Q1570072" url="?curid=413832" title="Hakuna matata">
<text>&quot;Hakuna matata&quot; () is a Swahili language phrase. In English, it means &quot;no trouble&quot; or &quot;no worries&quot; and &quot;take it easy&quot; (literally &quot;hakuna&quot;: &quot;there is no/there are no&quot;; &quot;matata&quot;: &quot;worries&quot;). The 1994 Walt Disney Animation Studios animated film &quot;The Lion King&quot; brought the phrase to Western prominence in one of its most popular songs, in which it is translated as &quot;no worries&quot;. The song is often heard at Disney&#x27;s resorts, hotels, and amusement parks.

==Boney M. song==
In 1983, German group Boney M. released &quot;Jambo — Hakuna Matata&quot;, an English-language version of the song &quot;Jambo Bwana&quot; by Kenyan group Them Mushrooms. Liz Mitchell provided the song&#x27;s lead vocals, backed by Reggie Tsiboe, Cathy Bartney, Madeleine Davis and Judy Cheeks. The single performed poorly, reaching number 48 in the German charts and causing it to be omitted from the group&#x27;s seventh album &quot;Ten Thousand Lightyears&quot;, released in 1984.

==&quot;The Lion King&quot; song==

In 1994, the Walt Disney Feature Animation animated film &quot;The Lion King&quot; brought the phrase international recognition, featuring it prominently in the plot and devoting a song to it. A meerkat and a warthog, Timon and Pumbaa, teach Simba, a lion cub that he should forget his troubled past and live in the present. The song was written by Elton John (music) and Tim Rice (lyrics), who found the term in a Swahili phrasebook. It was nominated for Best Original Song at the 1995 Academy Awards, and was later ranked the 99th best song in movie history by the American Film Institute on its list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs.

==Cultural appropriation charge==
In 2003, Disney was granted a trademark protecting the phrase from being used on clothing and footwear. Prior to the release of the 2019 remake, the trademark caused controversy in East Africa, where Disney was accused of cultural appropriation. More than 50,000 people signed a petition on Change.org asking Disney to drop the trademark.

<text>The Atlantic Council is an American think tank in the field of international affairs, favoring Atlanticism, founded in 1961. It manages sixteen regional centers and functional programs related to international security and global economic prosperity. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C. It is a member of the Atlantic Treaty Association.

==History==
The Atlantic Council was founded with the stated mission to encourage the continuation of cooperation between North America and Europe that began after World War II. In its early years, its work consisted largely of publishing policy papers and polling Europeans and Americans about their attitudes towards transatlantic and international cooperation. In these early years, its primary focus was on economic issues—mainly encouraging free trade between the two continents, and to a lesser extent to the rest of the world—but it also did some work on political and environmental issues.

Although the Atlantic Council did publish policy papers and monographs, Melvin Small of Wayne State University wrote that, especially in its early years, the Council&#x27;s real strength lay in its connections to influential policymakers. The Council early on found a niche as &quot;center for informal get-togethers&quot; of leaders from both sides of the Atlantic, with members working to develop &quot;networks of continuing communication&quot;.

The Atlantic Council also works outside Europe and the U.S. It was among the first organizations advocating for an increased Japanese presence in the international community. Its Asian programs have expanded since 2001 as a consequence of the war in Afghanistan leading to the opening of its South Asia Center and Program on Asia. Climate change, and coordinating with India and China on these issues, were also a factor in this development.

In February 2009, James L. Jones, then-chairman of the Atlantic Council, stepped down to serve as President Obama&#x27;s new National Security Advisor and was succeeded by Senator Chuck Hagel. In addition, other Council members also left to serve the administration: Susan Rice as ambassador to the UN, Richard Holbrooke as the Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, General Eric K. Shinseki as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and Anne-Marie Slaughter as Director of Policy Planning at the State Department. Four years later, Hagel stepped down to serve as US Secretary of Defense. Gen. Brent Scowcroft served as interim chairman of the organization&#x27;s Board of Directors until January 2014, when former ambassador to China and governor of Utah Jon Huntsman Jr. was appointed.

They expanded their efforts to Central and South America in 2013 when the Atlantic Council launched the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, named for Adrienne Arsht, a philanthropist and businesswoman who helped fund its creation through a $5 million gift.The goal of the Center was to improve relationships and economic ties between Latin American Countries, North America and Europe. Their first director was Peter Schechter, who was chosen due to his extensive experience acting as a lead consultant on elections, polling, advertising, and media relations in the region. As of October 2023, the Adrienne Arsht Latin American Center at the Atlantic Council has increased its influence across the Latin American region. With a focus on achieving greater socioeconomic prosperity, the Center has integrated political economy issues into policy-making and fostered collaboration with a diverse range of stakeholders, including governments, companies, and multilateral institutions.

In 2017, Tom Bossert, previously a Nonresident Zurich Cyber Risk Fellow at the Atlantic Council&#x27;s Cyber Security Initiative, was appointed Homeland Security Advisor to the Trump administration.

The Digital Forensic Research Lab was founded in 2016, to study disinformation in open source environments and report on democratic processes. Facebook helped fund the think tank&#x27;s project in 2018, after donating a significant but undisclosed sum that placed it among top donors to the organization, such as the government of Great Britain.

In 2019, the Atlantic Council entered into a partnership with the Hungary Foundation, a group funded by the Orbán government in Hungary. A series of strategy discussions was planned which would have included key US and Central Europe officials. In a meeting in Budapest that year, Atlantic Council members criticized Hungarian Foreign Ministry officials for limiting discussion of the state of democracy in Hungary. Following this, the Hungary Foundation canceled the project. In 2020, the Atlantic Council returned a grant from the Hungary Foundation and ended its relationship with the Foundation.

The Atlantic Council GeoEconomics Center was launched in December 2020 in a keynote event with ECB President Christine Lagarde. The GeoEconomics Center develops data-driven programs, publications, and thought leadership at the nexus of economics, finance, and foreign policy. The Center aims to bridge the divide between these siloed sectors with the goal of helping shape a more resilient global economy. The Center is organized around three pillars - the Future of Capitalism, the Future of Money, and the Economic Statecraft Initiative. They produce cutting-edge data visualizations and research on a range of issues including digital currencies, China’s economy, sanctions, and the future of the Bretton Woods system. The Center has hosted a range of leading financial policymakers for major policy speeches including Brian Deese, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Janet Yellen, Gina Raimondo, Kristalina Georgieva, David Malpass and many more.

In September 2021, the Global China Hub was founded to research three challenges posed by China&#x27;s economic growth: China’s growing influence on countries, global institutions, and democratic values; the global ramifications of political and economic change in Xi Jinping’s China; and China’s drive to dominate emerging technologies and the consequences for individual rights and privacy. As of June 2023, its senior director is David O. Shullman, who also leads the Atlantic Council&#x27;s China-related work.

==Connections and funding==
The Atlantic Council has, since its inception, stated it is a nonpartisan institution, with members &quot;from the moderate internationalist wings of both parties&quot; in the United States. Despite its connections, the Council is by charter independent of the U.S. government and NATO, a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

In September 2014, Eric Lipton reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that since 2008, the US organization had received donations from more than twenty-five foreign governments. He wrote that the Atlantic Council was one of a number of think tanks that received substantial overseas funds and conducted activities that &quot;typically align with the foreign governments&#x27; agendas&quot;.

The Atlantic Council&#x27;s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East was established with a donation from Bahaa Hariri and its founding head was Michele Dunne. After Mohamed Morsi was removed as President of Egypt by the military in 2013, Dunne urged the United States to suspend military aid to Egypt and called Morsi&#x27;s removal a &quot;military coup&quot;. Bahaa Hariri complained to the Atlantic Council about Dunne&#x27;s actions and four months later Dunne resigned her position.

In 2014, The Atlantic Council produced a report promoting the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) — a proposed trade-accommodation agreement between the European Union and the U.S. — with the financial backing of FedEx, who were simultaneously lobbying Congress directly to decrease transatlantic tariffs.

In 2015 and 2016, the three largest donors, giving over $1 million USD each, were US millionaire Adrienne Arsht (executive vice chair), Lebanese billionaire Bahaa Hariri (estranged brother of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri), and the United Arab Emirates. The Ukrainian oligarch-run Burisma Holdings donated $100,000 per year for three years to the Atlantic Council starting in 2016. The full list of financial sponsors includes many military, financial, and corporate concerns.

The leading donors in 2018 were Facebook and the British government. According to the Council, of its 2019 revenue, 14% (approximately $5.5 million) came from government donors excluding the US government.

In 2021, the founding donor was Adrienne Arsht, and donors giving more than $1 million were the American Securities Foundation, Bahaa Hariri, Embassy of the United Arab Emirates, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, The Rockefeller Foundation, and the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.

In November 2022, the Atlantic Council hosted the Global Food Security Forum, which was co-hosted with the Gaurav and Sharon Srivastava Family Foundation, run by Gaurav Srivastava. The Atlantic Council subsequently terminated its relationship with Srivastava &quot;after it could not verify important details of his background&quot; following reporting of the Guarav Srivastava Fake Spy Scam. A Spokesperson for the Atlantic Council told Politico that it had returned funds received in 2023 for future collaboration, and that it &quot;made the decision to terminate our relationship with Mr Srivastava in May 2023 upon learning new information because of our donor review process. For example, we learned that The Gaurav &amp; Sharon Srivastava Family Foundation was not established 501(c)(3) in April of 2023, despite Mr Srivastava&#x27;s representation to the Council that this was a registered foundation.&quot;

Reena Ninan is a former member of the Atlantic Council, Rockefeller Foundation &amp; Council on Foreign Relations. She currently works as a presider of their public forums.

==Events==
The Atlantic Council creates a meeting place for heads of state, military leaders, and international leaders from both sides of the Atlantic. In 2009, the Council hosted former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen&#x27;s first major U.S. speech, in which he discussed issues such as NATO&#x27;s mission in the War in Afghanistan, NATO cooperation with Russia, and the broader transatlantic relationship. Members of the U.S. Congress have also appeared, including Senator Richard Lugar and Secretary of State John Kerry. The Council hosts events with sitting heads of state and government, including former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, and former Latvian President Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga.

Since January 2007, the Council has hosted military leaders from both sides of the Atlantic. The council&#x27;s Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security has, held periodic events known as the Commanders Series, where it invites military leaders from the United States and Europe to speak about conflicts of interest to the Atlantic community. As part of the Commanders Series, American military leaders such as former General George Casey and former Admiral Timothy Keating and European leaders like former French Chief of Defense General Jean-Louis Georgelin and Dutch Lieutenant General Ton van Loon have spoken on issues such as the Iraq War, the war in Afghanistan, and security threats in Asia and Africa.

Its annual events include the Distinguished Leadership Awards in Washington, DC; the Future Leaders Summit; the Wroclaw Global Forum in Wroclaw, Poland; the Atlantic Council Energy &amp; Economic Summit in Istanbul, Turkey; and the Global Citizen Awards in New York City.

On February 22, 2019, the Atlantic Council released its &quot;Declaration of Principles&quot; at the Munich Security Conference. Frederick Kempe, President and CEO of the Atlantic Council, said it was &quot;an effort to rally and reinvigorate &#x27;free peoples&#x27; around the world&quot;.

In August 2023, a senior Atlantic Council delegation led by former Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaitė visited Taiwan with support from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office and met with President Tsai Ing-wen.

==Reception==

In 2016, the Atlantic Council drew criticism from the founder of the Human Rights Foundation for its decision to award a Global Citizen Award to Ali Bongo Ondimba. Bongo declined the award amidst controversy over the 2016 Gabonese presidential election.

In July 2019, Russia said the activities of the Atlantic Council pose a threat to the foundations of its constitutional system and the security of the Russian Federation. Russia added the Atlantic Council to its list of &quot;undesirable&quot; organizations, preventing it from operating within Russia. Russian scholars Andrei Tsygankov, Pavel Tsygankov, and Haley Gonzalez (2023) noted pro-NATO and anti-Russian bias in Atlantic Council publications.

The United States diplomatic cables leak revealed that the Atlantic Council worked closely with Chevron Corporation and ExxonMobil representatives to undermine the Brazilian legislative proposal to grant Petrobras chief operator of the pre-salt oil deposits in the Brazilian coast. Upon failure, the organization pivoted to undermine the institutions that held that legislation in place by openly supporting the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff and the ongoing lawfare against Petrobras. After the legislative victory, the success of the first auctions was announced in an event organized by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the main contributors to the Atlantic Council on this endeavour, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell plc and BP, were awarded with pre-salt exploration contracts.

<text>The Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI) is an American think tank based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that conducts research on geopolitics, international relations, and international security in the various regions of the world and on ethnic conflict, U.S. national security, terrorism, and on think tanks themselves. It publishes a quarterly journal, &quot;Orbis&quot;, and a series of monographs, books, and electronic newsletters.

==History==
FPRI was founded by Ambassador Robert Strausz-Hupé, a Vienna native who immigrated to the United States in 1923. Dissatisfied with the containment strategy of John Foster Dulles and the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s foreign policy in general, Strausz-Hupé founded FPRI in 1955 with support from the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, and the Smith Richardson Foundation. In 1957, FPRI began publishing &quot;Orbis&quot;, its quarterly journal.

Since the end of the Cold War, the institute has focused on education in international affairs, sponsoring various programs in Philadelphia-area schools as well as conferences and seminars for high school and junior college teachers and lectures for the general public.

==Research programs==
FPRI manages and sponsors several divisions and programs, including its Program on National Security (chaired by John Lehman Jr.); its Asia Program (directed by Michael Beckley and chaired by Jacques deLisle); its Program on the Middle East (directed by James Ryan); its Eurasia Program (directed by Maia Otarashvili); its Center for Study of America and the West (founded in 1997, directed by Ronald J. Granieri, and chaired by Walter A. McDougall); and the Africa Program (chaired by Charles A. Ray).

==Board of trustees==
As of 2023, FPRI&#x27;s board of trustees includes:
* Robert L. Freedman, chairman
* Dov S. Zakheim, vice-chair
* Adrian A. Basora
* Larry Ceisler
* Devon Cross, vice-chair

<text>Political Research Associates (PRA), formerly Midwest Research, Chicago (1981–87), is a non-profit research group focused on social justice and the pursuit of building a just democracy. The PRA is located in Somerville, Massachusetts.

==Mission==
PRA studies the U.S. political right wing, as well as white supremacists, and paramilitary organizations. It has a full-time staff of six. The Executive Director is Tarso Luis Ramos. Dr. Jean V. Hardisty was the founder and director from 1981 to 2004. Chip Berlet was the group&#x27;s senior analyst from 1981–2011. Peggy Shinner (a poet) was the first archivist. 

PRA publishes a journal, &quot;The Public Eye&quot;, quarterly, which reports on specific and current movements or trends within the U.S. political Right, and also produces special reports, past examples of which include &quot;Calculated Compassion: How the Ex-Gay Movement Serves the Right&#x27;s Attacks on Democracy,&quot; authored by former PRA research analyst, Surina Khan, which details attacks on gays and lesbians, and &quot;Decades of Distortion,&quot; which alleged scapegoating of welfare recipients.

The group provides public speakers, and has staff on hand to answer queries from journalists, researchers, and activists. Its annual funding of approximately $700,000 per year comes from foundation grants, individual contributions, and the sale of research materials. Expenditures are directed toward staffing, general &amp; administrative expenses, programs and fundraising. Among its major donors are the Public Welfare Foundation and the Ford Foundation.

PRA is supported by a number of progressive and liberal activists, including Anne Braden of the Southern Organizing Committee, and Suzanne Pharr of the Highlander Research Center. Pharr has written that PRA &quot;sets the standard for researchers and political analysts of integrity,&quot; and describes the group&#x27;s research as &quot;thorough, thoughtful, carefully researched, and presented within a broad context of understanding of the complex relationships and activities of the Right.&quot;

==Founding and early history==
What is now Political Research Associates in Massachusetts began as a small progressive Chicago think tank called Midwest Research. The organization was founded by Jean V. Hardisty, a professor of history. Hardisty had been hired by the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois to conduct research on the rise of the anti-feminist and anti-abortion movements. She wrote her report for the ACLU, and then left academia to devote herself full time to defending democracy and human rights against organized attacks by right wing groups and movements.

The first two people hired by Dr. Hardisty were Peggy Shinner, a poet and writer, and Chip Berlet, a journalist and photographer.

When Hardisty was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, she was referred to a medical center in Boston. Shinner chose to stay in Chicago with her partner. However, Chip Berlet and his spouse moved to the Boston area. After a few examinations in Boston, Hardisty was told her best treatment would be received in Oklahoma. She left the organization she founded in the hands of her staff. She later returned to resume her leadership position.

The year 1994 saw a rising wave of violence against persons in (or even suspected of being supportive of) LGBTQ communities. Hardisty contacted nationally-known organizers and strategists Suzanne Pharr and Loretta Ross and raised funds for a national strategy meeting at the Blue Mountain Center in the Adirondacks. What emerged was &quot;A Call to Defend Democracy and Pluralism&quot;, November 17, 1994.

Hardisty testified as an expert witness in the court fight over Colorado’s Amendment 2, described by human rights groups as &quot;homophobic&quot;. She was accompanied by staff member Chip Berlet and numerous boxes of documents prepared for submission as evidence in the case. The case defending Amendment Two quickly collapsed.

Hardisty is listed in the Chicago LGBT Hall of Fame.

<doc id="413851" wikidata="Q1343804" url="?curid=413851" title="John Wain">
<text>John Barrington Wain CBE (14 March 1925 – 24 May 1994) was an English poet, novelist, and critic, associated with the literary group known as &quot;The Movement&quot;. He worked for most of his life as a freelance journalist and author, writing and reviewing for newspapers and the radio.

==Life and education==
Wain was born and grew up in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, the son of a dentist, Arnold Wain, and his wife Annie, née Turner. He had an older sister and a younger brother, Noel. After attending Newcastle-under-Lyme High School, he entered St. John&#x27;s College, Oxford, gaining a first in his BA in 1946 and an MA in 1950. He was a Fereday Fellow of St John&#x27;s between 1946 and 1949. On 4 July 1947, Wain married Marianne Urmston (born 1923 or 1924), but they divorced in 1956. He then married Eirian Mary James (1920–1988), deputy director of the recorded sound department of the British Council, on 1 January 1960. They had three sons and lived mainly in Wolvercote, Oxford. Wain married his third wife, Patricia Adams (born 1942 or 1943), an art teacher, in 1989. He died in Oxford on 24 May 1994.

==Literary career==
Wain wrote his first novel, &quot;Hurry on Down&quot;, in 1953: a comic picaresque story about an unsettled university graduate who rejects the standards of conventional society. Other notable novels include &quot;Strike the Father Dead&quot; (1962), a tale of a jazzman&#x27;s rebellion against his conventional father, and &quot;Young Shoulders&quot; (1982), winner of the Whitbread Prize, in which a young boy deals with the death of loved ones.

Wain was also a prolific poet and critic, with critical works on fellow Midland writers Arnold Bennett, Samuel Johnson (winning him the 1974 James Tait Black Memorial Prize), and Shakespeare. Others for whom he wrote included the Americans Theodore Roethke and Edmund Wilson. He himself was the subject of a bibliography by David Gerard.

==Academic career==
Wain taught at the University of Reading during the late 1940s and early 1950s, and in 1963 spent a term as professor of rhetoric at Gresham College, London. He was the first fellow in creative arts at Brasenose College, Oxford (1971–1972), and was appointed a supernumerary fellow in 1973. In the same year he was elected to the five-year post of Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford: some of his lectures appear in his book &quot;Professing Poetry&quot;. Wain was appointed a CBE in 1984. He was made an honorary fellow of his old college, St John&#x27;s, Oxford, in 1985.

==Literary associations==
Wain was often referred to as one of the &quot;Angry Young Men&quot;, a term applied to 1950s writers such as John Braine, John Osborne, Alan Sillitoe and Keith Waterhouse, as radicals who opposed the British establishment and conservative elements of society at that time. Indeed, he contributed to &quot;Declaration&quot;, an anthology by writers associated with the philosophy, and a chapter of his novel &quot;Hurry on Down&quot; was excerpted in a popular paperback sampler, &quot;&quot;.

Yet it may be more accurate to link Wain with The Movement, a group of post-war poets including Kingsley Amis, D. J. Enright, Thom Gunn, Donald Davie, Elizabeth Jennings and Philip Larkin. Amis and Larkin, good friends of Wain&#x27;s for a time, were also associated with the &quot;Angries&quot;. But aside from their poetry, it may be more apposite to refer to them, as was sometimes done at the time, as &quot;The New University Wits&quot; – writers who wished to communicate rather than experiment and often did so in a comic manner. However, they all became more serious after their initial work. Wain is still known for his poetry (for example, his &quot; Apology for Understatement&quot;) and literary interests (contributions to &quot;The Observer&quot;), although his work is no longer as popular as it was. Critical remarks about him by Amis and Larkin in their posthumously published letters may have contributed to dimming his reputation.

Wain&#x27;s tutor at Oxford had been C. S. Lewis. He encountered, but did not see himself as a part of, the group of Lewis&#x27;s literary acquaintances, the Inklings. Wain was as serious about literature as the Inklings, and believed, as they did, in the primacy of literature as communication, but as a modern realist writer he shared neither their conservative social beliefs nor their propensity for fantasy.

<doc id="413852" wikidata="Q915562" url="?curid=413852" title="Democratic Left (Ecuador)">
<text>The Democratic Left (Spanish: &quot;Izquierda Democrática&quot;, ID) is a social-democratic political party in Ecuador. It was founded in 1970 by the then congressman Rodrigo Borja Cevallos.

Ideologically, it identifies as a central goal to &quot;achieve social justice with freedom in an innovative, just, egalitarian, equitable, fraternal, solidary, dynamic, progressive and decentralized society under the inspiration of the ideological principles of democratic socialism... and inserts itself in the international scene, in the center-left tendency&quot;.

The party&#x27;s most significant electoral victory was in the period following Ecuador&#x27;s restoration of democracy in 1979, during the 1988 Ecuadorian general election, with founder Borja Cevallos as its presidential nominee. Borja Cevallos served as president from 1988 until 1992. As of 2024, this remains the first and last time an ID candidate for the presidency was elected.

For the 1992 Ecuadorian general election, Cevallos was constitutionally prohibited from seeking re-election. As a result, the party nominated politician Raúl Baca Carbo, who had served as Minister of Social Welfare during the Cevallos administration, as their nominee for president. Carbo resigned from his cabinet position in 1991 to campaign for the presidency. Carbo was eliminated in the first round.

Rodrigo Borja Cevallos was selected as the party&#x27;s nominee for the 1998 Ecuadorian general election, where he came in third place and was eliminated in the first round.

At the legislative elections, held on 20 October 2002, the party won at least 13 out of 100 seats. Its candidate, former president Rodrigo Borja, won 14.4% of the vote in the presidential elections of the same day.

For the October 2006 elections, it has entered into an alliance with the Ethics and Democracy Network (Red Etica y Democracia), to support the ticket formed by former Vice-President León Roldós, and Ramiro González, former Prefect of the Pichincha Canton. The party won 13 seats in Congress again, while its presidential ticket came in fourth place.

In the 2017 Ecuadorian general election, the party formed an alliance with the indigenist Pachakutik Plurinational Unity Movement – New Country and communist Popular Unity (Ecuador) parties, called the National Agreement for Change. The alliance nominated retired Ecuadorian Army general and politician Paco Moncayo as their presidential nominee. Moncayo was eliminated in the first round, and for the second round endorsed Guillermo Lasso.

For the 2021 Ecuadorian general election, ID nominated businessman Xavier Hervas as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate. Despite being a newcomer to politics and being nationally unknown, Hervas came in fourth place in the first round. In the second round, Hervas endorsed Guillermo Lasso. In 2022, Hervas left the party due to disagreements with its leadership.

In April 2022, the party had thirteen members in the National Assembly after it excluded Johanna Moreira from the party.

For the 2023 Ecuadorian general election, the party supported the candidacy of Otto Sonnenholzner. For the second round, the party announced its support for Daniel Noboa. The party was left also without any representatives in the National Assembly, the result of an internal struggle within the party that remains unresolved.

For the 2025 Ecuadorian general election, the party designated businessman Carlos Rabascall as their presidential nominee. His pre-candidacy and nomination generated controversy within the party, as Rabascall was vice presidential nominee for the Correist Union for Hope ticket in the 2021 elections. As a result of Rabascall&#x27;s nomination, a group of party members have threatened legal action and to take the case to the Constitutional Court of Ecuador. These ID members also denounce the party&#x27;s leadership for altering the statutes of the party to allow Rabascall to become the nominee, as the previous statutes stipulate that persons participating in elections representing ID require at least two years of membership in the party.

<text>The A Eighth Avenue Express is a rapid transit service in the B Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot;, is colored since it is a part of the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan.

The A operates 24 hours a day between Inwood–207th Street in Inwood, Manhattan, and . During the day, additional service operates to and from Ozone Park–Lefferts Boulevard in South Ozone Park, Queens. Daytime service makes express stops in Manhattan and Brooklyn and all stops in Queens. Late night service operates only between 207th Street and , making all stops along the full route; during this time, a shuttle train (the Lefferts Boulevard Shuttle) operates between Euclid Avenue and Lefferts Boulevard.

 provides the longest one-seat ride in the system—at , between 207th Street and Far Rockaway—and a 2015 study indicated that it had a weekday ridership of 600,000.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

The A and AA were the first services on the IND Eighth Avenue Line when it opened on September 10, 1932. The Independent Subway System (IND) used single letters to refer to express services and double letters for local services. The A ran express between 207th Street and Chambers Street, and the AA ran local between 168th Street and Chambers Street, known at the time as Hudson Terminal. During late-night hours (from 1:45 a.m. to 5:45 a.m.) and on Sundays, the A did not run and the AA made all stops along the line.

The A was extended to Jay Street–Borough Hall when the Cranberry Street Tunnel to Brooklyn opened on February 1, 1933, and to Bergen Street, when the extension opened on March 20. On July 1, the A began running express at all times, stopping at 155th Street and 163rd Street during late nights. The A was extended to Church Avenue on October 7.

On April 9, 1936, the IND Fulton Street Line was opened to Rockaway Avenue. The 1936 extension played an integral part in the establishment of Bedford-Stuyvesant as Brooklyn&#x27;s central African American community. The A train connected Harlem, Manhattan&#x27;s central African American community, to areas of Bedford-Stuyvesant that provided residential opportunities for African Americans not found throughout the rest of New York City.

On December 30, 1946, and November 28, 1948, the line was extended to Broadway–East New York (now Broadway Junction) and Euclid Avenue, respectively. On October 24, 1949, express service in Brooklyn to Broadway–East New York began with the A running express during rush hours, with the extended to provide local service.

=== Extensions to Ozone Park and the Rockaways ===

On April 29, 1956, Grant Avenue was opened and the line was extended over the BMT Fulton Street Line to Lefferts Boulevard. On weekdays except midnights, alternate trains terminated at Lefferts Boulevard and at Euclid Avenue. During weekends, they terminated at Euclid Avenue with a shuttle to Lefferts Boulevard.

Two months later, on June 28, 1956, the former Long Island Rail Road Rockaway Beach Branch, having been rebuilt to subway specifications, began service to Rockaway Park and Wavecrest (Beach 25th Street). At this time, rush hour express service on the Fulton Street Line with the E train began.

On September 16, 1956, the A was extended to the Rockaways, replacing the E. At the time, alternate trains continued running to Lefferts Boulevard. On January 27, 1957, non-rush hour through service to the Rockaways was discontinued and was replaced by a shuttle running between Euclid Avenue and Wavecrest (now Beach 25th Street). Non-rush hour A train service was now to Lefferts Boulevard.

On June 18, 1957, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) announced plans to have Rockaway-bound A trains skip Grant Avenue, Hudson Street, and Boyd Street during rush hours on a one-month pilot, to take effect July 1. The change was made to determine whether ten minutes could be reduced off of travel times to the Rockaways; the NYCTA only believed it would save three minutes. In the face of community opposition, the NYCTA announced that it would take more time to review the change, meaning that it ultimately did not take effect on July 1.

On January 16, 1958, with the opening of the new terminal Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue, rush hour A service was extended. On September 8, 1958, the A train replaced the E train in the Rockaways again, and A trains resumed alternating between Euclid Avenue and Lefferts Boulevard. &quot;Round-robin&quot; service from Euclid Avenue to both Rockaway terminals began during non-rush hours, while through A service ran to Lefferts Boulevard. On September 8, 1959, the A began to run local in Brooklyn during rush hours, making it local at all times in Brooklyn, as the E became express in Brooklyn during rush hours. On July 9, 1967, the A trains running to Euclid Avenue were extended to Far Rockaway middays, evenings, and weekends, replacing the HH shuttle on that branch.

=== Simplifying service patterns ===
As part of systemwide changes in bus and subway service, major changes were made to A service in Brooklyn and Queens on January 2, 1973. The A train became the express service along Fulton Street and the E train became the local during rush hours. Express service would be provided for a longer period during rush hours as the span of E service to Brooklyn, which would cover local stops, was also increased. In addition, the A trips that terminated at Euclid Avenue during rush hours were extended to Far Rockaway, replacing E service. Service would now run to Far Rockaway between 5:30 a.m. and 11:30 p.m. A trains would alternate between Lefferts Boulevard and Far Rockaway. These changes were initially supposed to take effect on September 11, 1972.

On August 30, 1976, the CC became the Fulton Street Local during rush hours, replacing E service. On August 27, 1977, the A began making local stops in Manhattan during late nights, when the AA was not running.

On December 11, 1988, A trains began running local between 145th Street and 168th Street on weekends to replace the discontinued K (formerly AA) service, and express on the IND Fulton Street Line in Brooklyn during middays and rush hours, with the C providing local service during those times. On September 30, 1990, A trains began operating local between 145th Street and 168th Street during weekday evenings.

In January 1991, a reduction of service along the Central Park West corridor to remove excess capacity was proposed. Initially, A service would operate local between 168th Street and Euclid Avenue during weekday rush hours and middays, with weekday evening and weekend daytime service extended beyond 168th Street to operate to and from Inwood–207th Street, and daily late night service extended beyond Euclid Avenue to operate to and from Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue in Queens. Express service between 168th Street and 59th Street–Columbus Circle would be replaced by and rerouted trains, the latter of which would serve 207th Street during weekday rush hours and middays; express service below 34th Street–Penn Station in Manhattan and in Brooklyn would have been replaced by an expanded service. A new shuttle would serve Lefferts Boulevard during late nights. The service change was later amended to retain the A as an express service in place of the altered service pattern and would be re-designated as an orange A, as it would be rerouted via the Sixth Avenue Line and its southern terminal moved to Brighton Beach, operating weekday rush hours and middays only. This service change would have been implemented in October 1991, pending approval from the MTA board.

In 1991, at a series of meetings, the NYCTA presented proposed changes to A, C, and H service that would shorten the length of the C, simplify the service pattern during late nights to most efficiently serve the majority of riders, provide direct express service to Rockaway Park during rush hours in the peak direction, and provide shuttle connections during non-peak periods between Rockaway Park and through A train service. The service pattern devised was designed to improve operations by reducing route length and complexity, making service more attractive, simplifying confusing service patterns, and reducing transfers for passengers traveling during late nights. At the time, A service ran to Lefferts Boulevard and Far Rockaway during the day while the C ran to Rockaway Park during rush hours. During late nights, A service ran to Lefferts Boulevard, while service to both branches in the Rockaways was provided by round-robin H shuttle service to Euclid Avenue. As part of the changes proposed, round-robin shuttle service would be discontinued; late-night A service would run from Manhattan through to Far Rockaway; and service to Lefferts Boulevard and Rockaway Park would be provided by separate shuttle services with timed transfers to through A service. Rush hour local C service to Rockaway Park would be replaced by through A express service that ran every 20 minutes in the peak direction for a period of one hour and twenty minutes in rush hours to and from 59th Street–Columbus Circle. The initial proposal had these trips terminate at 34th Street, but this was changed to 59th Street following public comments. These five rush hour express trips were marketed as a &quot;commuter rail style service&quot;, and special efforts were to be made to follow the arrival and departure times listed in the route&#x27;s timetable, which was publicly distributed to riders. In addition, H service to Rockaway Park would be replaced by the Rockaway Park Shuttle, which would run between Broad Channel and Rockaway Park, and C service would be truncated to Euclid Avenue.

In April 1992, the MTA Board approved the proposed change to service in the Rockaways, which were expected to encourage ridership growth in the long term, and reduced NYCTA&#x27;s annual operating budget by $20,000. The changes took effect on October 23, 1992, with modification: Late night shuttle service to Lefferts Boulevard would terminate at Euclid Avenue, not Rockaway Boulevard. Later on, the rush hour A trips to Rockaway Park were extended from 59th Street to Dyckman Street and Inwood–207th Street.

On May 29, 1994, A trains began running express on weekends from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. between 168th Street and 145th Street, with C trains being extended from 145th Street to 168th Street to cover local stops. A corresponding change was made to weekday midday A service on April 30, 1995, though this change was discontinued on November 12, 1995. On March 1, 1998, A trains began running express between 168th Street and 145th Street during middays and early evenings, with local service provided by extended C service.

On May 1, 1999, the A became the express on the Fulton Street Line at all times except late nights, and C service was extended from World Trade Center to Euclid Avenue during late weekday evenings and weekends to provide local service along the line. This service change was made due to construction taking place on the Williamsburg Bridge, which prohibited the , and from entering Manhattan; as a result, service on the A, as well as the C and , were increased. This service change to the A was made permanent after the Williamsburg Bridge reopened to J, M and Z trains.

=== 21st century ===

On January 23, 2005, a fire at the Chambers Street signal room crippled A and C service. Initial assessments suggested that it would take several years to restore normal service, but the damaged equipment was replaced with available spare parts, and normal service resumed on April 21.

A service was affected by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, due to extreme damage to the IND Rockaway Line. Trains that normally traveled to Far Rockaway or Rockaway Park terminated at Howard Beach–JFK Airport. Service to the Rockaways resumed on May 30, 2013. The Far Rockaway part of the route was served by the temporary free H shuttle that ran between Far Rockaway and Beach 90th Street via the connecting track at Hammels Wye.

As a result of a two-phase program of flood mitigation work along the Hammels Wye, between April 9 and May 18, 2018, limited rush hour A service to/from Rockaway Park was suspended. The second phase, from July 1 to September 3, diverted all Far Rockaway-bound A trips to Rockaway Park, with Rockaway Park Shuttle trains being rerouted to the Far Rockaway branch through the southern leg of Hammels Wye.

From midday on March 29, 2020 to April 28, 2020, due to the suspension of C train service caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, A trains to Lefferts Boulevard ran local, while A trains to the Rockaways ran express. As part of a program to repair the South Channel Bridge, service between Howard Beach and the peninsula suspended for 17 weeks which began on January 17, 2025, and the Rockaway branches instead served by a rerouted Rockaway Park Shuttle.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Take the &#x27;A&#x27; Train&quot; is a jazz standard by Billy Strayhorn, referring to the A train, going at that time from eastern Brooklyn up into Harlem and northern Manhattan. It became the signature tune of Duke Ellington and often opened the shows of Ella Fitzgerald. The A train is mentioned by Azealia Banks in her song &quot;212&quot;.

<doc id="413865" wikidata="Q2245550" url="?curid=413865" title="Fundamental Orders of Connecticut">
<text>The Fundamental Orders were adopted by the Connecticut Colony council on . The fundamental orders describe the government set up by the Connecticut River towns, setting its structure and powers. They wanted the government to have access to the open ocean for trading.

The Orders have the features of a written constitution and are considered by some authors to be the first written Constitution in the Western tradition. Thus, Connecticut earned its nickname of &quot;The Constitution State&quot;. The document is notable as it assigns supreme authority in the colony to the elected general court, omitting any reference to the authority of the British Crown or other external authority. In 1662, the colony petitioned the king for a royal charter, which substantially secured the colony&#x27;s right to self-govern following the same form of government established by the Fundamental Orders.

== History ==

In the year 1634, a group of Puritans and others who were dissatisfied with the rate of Anglican reforms sought to establish an ecclesiastical society subject to their own rules and regulations. The Massachusetts General Court granted them permission to settle the cities of Windsor, Wethersfield, and Hartford. Ownership of the land was called into dispute by the English holders of the Warwick Patent of 1631. The Massachusetts General Court established the March Commission to mediate the dispute and named Roger Ludlow as its head. The Commission named eight magistrates from the Connecticut towns to implement a legal system. The March commission expired in March 1636, after which the settlers continued to self-govern.

On May 29, 1638, Ludlow wrote to Massachusetts Governor Winthrop that the colonists wanted to &quot;unite ourselves to walk and lie peaceably and lovingly together.&quot; Ludlow and other principals drafted the Fundamental Orders, which were adopted on January 14, 1639 O.S. (January 24, 1639 N.S.) and established Connecticut as a self-ruled colony. Major John Mason was a magistrate and is credited with being one of the writers of this document.

There is no record of the debates or proceedings of the drafting or enactment of the Fundamental Orders. It is postulated that the framers wished to remain anonymous because England was watchful and suspicious of this vigorous infant colony; the commission from Massachusetts had expired. The orders were transcribed into the official Connecticut Colony records by the colony&#x27;s secretary Thomas Welles.
&quot;The men of the three towns were a law only to themselves. It is known that they were in earnest for the establishment of a government on broad lines; and it is certain that the ministers and captains, the magistrates and men of affairs, forceful in the settlements from the beginning, were the men who took the lead, guided the discussions, and found the root of the whole matter in the first written declaration of independence in these historical orders.&quot;

== Individual rights of the people ==

The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut is a short document but contains some principles that were later applied in creating the United States government. Government is based on the rights of an individual, and the orders spell out some of those rights, as well as how they are ensured by the government. It provides that all free men share in electing their magistrates, and uses secret, paper ballots. It states the powers of the government and some limits within which that power is exercised.

In one sense, the Fundamental Orders were replaced by a Royal Charter in 1662, however, the major outline of the charter was written in Connecticut and embodied the Orders&#x27; rights and mechanics. It was carried to England by Governor John Winthrop and basically approved by the British King, Charles II. The colonists generally viewed the charter as a continuation and surety for their Fundamental Orders. Later on, the Charter Oak got its name when that charter was taken from Jeremy Adams&#x27;s tavern and supposedly hidden in an oak tree, rather than it be surrendered to the agents of James II, who intended to annex Connecticut to the more centralized Dominion of New England.

Today, the individual rights in the Orders, with others added over the years, are still included as a &quot;Declaration of Rights&quot; in the first article of the current Connecticut Constitution, adopted in 1965.

== Competing claims for the first Western constitution ==

Connecticut historian John Fiske was the first to claim that the Fundamental Orders were the first written Constitution, a claim disputed by some modern historians. The Mayflower Compact has an equal claim 19 years before; however, this Order gave men more voting rights and made more men eligible to run for elected positions. Karolina Adamová, a scientific member of the Institute of State and Law of the Czech Academy of Sciences argues that the articles of the Bohemian Confederacy adopted by the General Assembly of the evangelical estates in Prague on July 31, 1619, can be considered to be the first modern constitution and simultaneously the first federal constitution in recorded history.

<text>This is a list of people executed in Georgia. Since 1976, a total of 77 people have been executed by the state of Georgia in the United States.

== List of people executed in Georgia since 1976 ==
== Demographics ==
== Record number of executions ==
In 2016, the State of Georgia executed nine people. This set a record for the most executions conducted in Georgia in a calendar year. The same year, Texas only executed seven people, the first time it did not lead the nation in executions since 2001 (when it ranked behind Oklahoma). Prior to this, the most executions conducted in the state were five executions. This happened in 1987 and again in 2015.

== Prior to 1976 ==
* Lena Baker was an African American maid who was executed on March 5, 1945, for killing her employer. In 2005, the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles granted a pardon saying a verdict of manslaughter would have been more appropriate.
* The first individual electrocuted for a crime and sentenced to death (in Georgia) was Howard Henson, a black male, for rape and robbery; by electrocution on September 13, 1924, in DeKalb County.

<doc id="413878" wikidata="Q2858825" url="?curid=413878" title="Capital punishment in Louisiana">
<text>Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the U.S. state of Louisiana.

Despite remaining a legal penalty, there have been no executions in Louisiana since 2010, and no involuntary executions since 2002. Execution protocols are tied up in litigation due to a 2012 lawsuit challenging Louisiana&#x27;s lethal injection procedures. In addition, certain pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers do not want their products associated with capital punishment, meaning the state has been unable to obtain lethal injection drugs. Despite this, a 2018 survey by the Louisiana State University found that the majority of Louisianan citizens still support capital punishment. The most recent execution was of Gerald Bordelon, who waived his appeals and asked to be executed in 2010. He is the only person to have been executed in Louisiana since 2002.

On March 5, 2024, Governor Jeff Landry signed a law allowing executions to be carried out via nitrogen gas and electrocution. The law opened the door for Louisiana to resume capital punishment. Almost a year later, on February 10, 2025, Landry announced that the state had finalized its new execution protocol, allowing executions to be carried out in Louisiana after 15 years.

==Legal process==
When the prosecution seeks the death penalty, the sentence is decided by the jury.

In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence is issued, even if a single juror opposed death (there is no retrial).

The governor may commute death sentences with advice and consent of the Louisiana Board of Pardons and Parole. The governor doesn&#x27;t need such consent for issuing a mere stay of execution.

The male death row is at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in West Feliciana Parish. The female death row is at Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women in St. Gabriel. Executions in Louisiana are currently performed at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. 

The method of execution is selected at the discretion of the secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections among lethal injection, nitrogen hypoxia and electrocution.

==Capital crimes==
First degree murder is punishable by death when it involves any of the following aggravating factors:
#The offender was engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of aggravated or first degree rape, forcible or second degree rape, aggravated kidnapping, second degree kidnapping, aggravated burglary, aggravated arson, aggravated escape, assault by drive-by shooting, armed robbery, first degree robbery, second degree robbery, simple robbery, cruelty to juveniles, second degree cruelty to juveniles, or terrorism.
#The victim was a fireman or peace officer engaged in his lawful duties.
#The offender has been previously convicted of an unrelated murder, aggravated or first degree rape, aggravated burglary, aggravated arson, aggravated escape, armed robbery, or aggravated kidnapping.
#The offender knowingly created a risk of death or great bodily harm to more than one person.
#The offender offered or has been offered or has given or received anything of value for the commission of the offense.
#The offender at the time of the commission of the offense was imprisoned after sentence for the commission of an unrelated forcible felony.
#The offense was committed in an especially heinous, atrocious or cruel manner.
#The victim was a witness in a prosecution against the defendant, gave material assistance to the state in any investigation or prosecution of the defendant, or was an eye witness to a crime alleged to have been committed by the defendant or possessed other material evidence against the defendant.
#The victim was a correctional officer or any employee of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections who, in the normal course of his employment was required to come in close contact with persons incarcerated in a state prison facility, and the victim was engaged in his lawful duties at the time of the offense.
#The victim was under the age of 12 years or 65 years of age or older.
#The offender was engaged in the distribution, exchange, sale, or purchase, or any attempt thereof, of a controlled dangerous substance .
#The offender was engaged in ritualistic acts.
#The offender has knowingly killed two or more persons in a series of separate incidents.

Treason is also a capital crime in Louisiana. The state formerly also allowed execution for the aggravated rape of a victim under the age of 12. The Supreme Court, however, ruled it unconstitutional on June 25, 2008 in &quot;Kennedy v. Louisiana&quot;, saying &quot;there is a distinction between intentional first-degree murder on the one hand and nonhomicide crimes against individual persons&quot;.

==Notable cases==

On August 29, 2009—the fourth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina—a jury in Orleans Parish sentenced Michael Anderson to death on each of five counts of first degree murder for his execution style shooting of five teenagers on June 17, 2006. The quintuple slaying, which occurred as the nation watched New Orleans begin to rebuild in the aftermath of the storm, drew national attention to the violent crime problems plaguing the city and prompted then-Governor Kathleen Blanco to call in the Louisiana National Guard to help the New Orleans Police Department patrol the streets of the city. The sentence was especially significant as it marked the first time in twelve years that an Orleans Parish jury had sent a person to the state&#x27;s death row at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola. The sentence was later commuted to life and then reduced still further after Anderson&#x27;s cooperation with federal prosecutors and the revelation that the murder had in fact been committed by Telly Hankton

The prosecution of Rodricus Crawford for the murder of his one-year-old son in 2013 brought national attention to Caddo Parish and its controversial Assistant District Attorney (ADA) Dale Cox, responsible for one-third of the entire state of Louisiana&#x27;s death sentences since he began prosecuting capital cases and a strong proponent of the death penalty. Crawford was later exonerated.

<text>[[Capital punishment]] is a legal penalty in the U.S. state of [[Arkansas]].

Since 1820, a total of 505 individuals have been executed. According to the Arkansas Department of Correction, as of September, 10 2024, a total of 26 men were under a sentence of death in the state.

==History==
All but four executions carried out before 1913 were by hanging. Four guerillas were shot on July 29, 1864.

On July 25, 1902, seven men were hanged, the most executions in one day in the state.

Almost all executions were for crimes that involved murder. A number of people were also executed for rape and there was one execution for espionage, 17-year-old alleged Confederate spy David O. Dodd, hanged by Union soldiers on January 8, 1864.

In 1913, the method used was changed to the electric chair. The electric chair was constructed from the wood that had previously made up the state gallows. This electric chair would be used for all electrocutions up until 1964. Four more people were hanged in the state — one in 1913, two in 1914 and one in 1930.

The last execution in the state before &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; was that of Charles Fields on January 24, 1964 for rape. New capital punishment laws were passed in Arkansas and came into force on March 23, 1973. The first execution would not come until June 18, 1990 when John Edward Swindler was electrocuted. His was the first and so far only execution using an electric chair constructed by the state in the 1970s.

According to Michael L. Radelet of the University of Colorado there have been two instances of executions that did not go according to plan in Arkansas since &quot;Furman&quot;. On January 24, 1992 the execution of Ricky Ray Rector was delayed by fifty minutes after the medical staff were unable to find a suitable vein in his arm. The curtain over the witness area was not drawn, and witnesses heard Rector moan loudly eight times. State officials attributed the difficulties to his size and use of antipsychotic medication. The execution of Christina Marie Riggs faced similar delays on May 2, 2000, when staff were unable to locate a vein in her elbow. They eventually found one in her wrist.

There have been at least three death penalty volunteers in Arkansas: Ronald Gene Simmons, Christina Marie Riggs, and Clay King Smith.

In April 2017, the state planned to execute eight death row inmates before the stocks of the sedative midazolam expired at the end of April, but ultimately only four were put to death that month. A federal judge initially issued an injunction preventing the executions, but the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the ruling and the United States Supreme Court rejected a claim that the accelerated execution schedule was &quot;cruel and unusual punishment.&quot; On April 20, at about 11:30 PM CST, they were allowed to proceed. At 11:56 PM CST, four minutes prior to the expiration of his execution warrant, Ledell Lee was executed, making him the first inmate in Arkansas to be executed since 2005. On April 24, Jack Harold Jones and Marcel Williams were executed, the first double execution in the United States in 17 years. The last of the four inmates put to death in April 2017 was serial killer Kenneth Williams, who was found guilty of murdering a farmer during his prison escape and sentenced to death; Williams was also convicted of two more murders but was given two life sentences for these other killings. Williams, whose death sentence was carried out on April 27, 2017, remains the last person executed in Arkansas as of 2024.

In February 2025, a bill was proposed to allow the state to execute criminals by nitrogen hypoxia, a method first used by Alabama in 2024 to execute four of its condemned inmates between January 2024 and February 2025. A legislative panel voted 10-5 to grant approval to the Bill, and it advanced to the House for further review.

== Legal process ==
When the prosecution seeks the death penalty, the sentence is decided by the jury and must be unanimous.

In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence is issued, even if a single juror opposed death (there is no retrial).

The Governor of Arkansas has the power of clemency with respect to death sentences. The governor receives for that purpose a non-binding report from the Arkansas Board of Pardons and Paroles.

The method of execution is lethal injection. Anyone sentenced to death before July 4, 1983 can choose between lethal injection and electrocution, however, currently there aren&#x27;t any death row inmates that were sentenced before the aforementioned date. If lethal injection is ever ruled unconstitutional, electrocution shall be used to replace it.

Executions in Arkansas are currently performed at the Cummins Unit.

==Capital crimes==
The following are capital crimes in Arkansas: 
* Treason; and
* Murder involving one of the following aggravating factors:
#The murder was committed by an offender imprisoned as a result of a felony conviction.
#The murder was committed by an offender escaped after being sentenced to imprisonment as a result of a felony conviction.
#The offender previously committed another felony, an element of which was the use or threat of violence to another person or the creation of a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person.
#The offender in the commission of the capital murder knowingly created a great risk of death to a person other than the victim or caused the death of more than one person in the same criminal episode.
#The murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing an arrest or effecting an escape from custody.
#The murder was committed for pecuniary gain.
#The murder was committed for the purpose of disrupting or hindering the lawful exercise of any government or political function.
#The murder was committed in an especially cruel or depraved manner, that is, preceded by mental anguish, serious physical abuse, or torture upon the victim prior to the murder.
#The murder was committed by means of a destructive device, bomb, explosive, or similar device that the person planted, hid, or concealed in any place, area, dwelling, building, or structure, or mailed or delivered, or caused to be planted, hidden, concealed, mailed, or delivered, and the person knew that his or her act would create a great risk of death to human life.
#The murder was committed against a person whom the defendant knew or reasonably should have known was especially vulnerable to the attack because:
#*Of either a temporary or permanent severe physical or mental disability which would interfere with the victim&#x27;s ability to flee or to defend himself or herself; or
#*The victim was 12 years of age or younger.

==Death row==

Male death row inmates are located at the Arkansas Department of Correction Varner Unit&#x27;s Supermax, while the executions are performed at the Cummins Unit, adjacent to Varner. The female death row is located at the McPherson Unit. In 1999 the female death row was newly inaugurated.

In 1974, male death row inmates previously at the Tucker Unit, were moved to the Cummins Unit. In 1986, male death row inmates were moved to the Maximum Security Unit. On Friday August 22, 2003, all 39 Arkansas death row inmates, all of them male, were moved to the Supermax at the Varner Unit.

<text>A tambour desk is a desk with desktop-based drawers and s, in a way resembling bureau à gradin. The small drawers and nooks are covered, when required, by reeded or slatted shutters, &quot;tambours&quot;, which usually retract in the two sides, left and right. It is a flatter and &quot;sideways&quot; version of the rolltop desk.

Unlike the rolltop desk, the tambour desk uses straight, perfectly vertical rows of shutters, and the work surface rests on a few drawers, which in turn are supported by short legs instead of pedestals. In addition, half of the desktop folds back on itself when not in use. The desktop is supported by sliders, like a secretary desk or a slant top desk when it is unfolded.

The tambour desk is an antique form indigenous to the United States of America and should not be confused with the British tambour writing table.

<doc id="413885" wikidata="Q390384" url="?curid=413885" title="Calcareous grassland">
<text>Calcareous grassland (or alkaline grassland) is an ecosystem associated with thin basic soil, such as that on chalk and limestone downland.

There are large areas of calcareous grassland in northwestern Europe, particularly areas of southern England, such as Salisbury Plain and the North and South Downs.

The machair forms a different kind of calcareous grassland, where fertile low-lying plains are formed on ground that is calcium-rich due to shell sand (pulverised sea shells).

==Biodiversity==

Plants on calcareous grassland are typically short and , and include grasses and herbs such as clover. Calcareous grassland is an important habitat for insects, particularly butterflies and ants, and is kept at a plagioclimax by grazing animals, usually sheep and sometimes cattle. Rabbits used to play a part but due to the onset of myxomatosis their numbers decreased so dramatically that they no longer have much of a grazing effect.

The lichen flora of chalk grasslands represents an often overlooked component of calcareous grassland biodiversity. A comprehensive survey of English chalk grasslands in the 1990s identified two main lichen communities: the widespread &quot;Lecideetum watsomiae&quot; association found on chalk pebbles and flints, and the more restricted &quot;Fulgensietum fulgentis&quot; community. These lichen communities require specific conditions to grow, including areas of open ground created through natural or human disturbance, such as rabbit grazing, trampling, or historical agricultural practices. The richest lichen sites are often found where soil has been disturbed within the past century or where natural factors like landslips create suitable habitats. Key factors promoting lichen diversity include the presence of stable flints, areas of nutrient-poor soil, and the presence of a small loess (windblown silt) fraction in the soil. Characteristic species include &quot;Gyalolechia fulgens&quot; and various &quot;Cladonia&quot; species. Many calcareous grassland lichen communities have shown significant decline since the mid-20th century, attributed to factors such as reduced grazing, nitrogen deposition, and habitat loss.

<doc id="413890" wikidata="Q285249" url="?curid=413890" title="Ann Clwyd">
<text>Ann Clwyd Roberts ( , ; ; 21 March 1937 – 21 July 2023) was a Welsh Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Cynon Valley for 35 years, from 1984 until 2019. Although she had intended to stand down in 2015, she was re-elected in that year&#x27;s general election and in 2017 before standing down in 2019. Clwyd is the longest-serving female MP for a Welsh constituency.

==Early life==
Ann Clwyd was born in Halkyn, Flintshire, in 1937, the daughter of Gwilym Henri Lewis and Elizabeth Ann Lewis, born and brought up in Pentre Halkyn, Flintshire. She was educated at Holywell Grammar School and the Queen&#x27;s School, Chester, before graduating from the University of Wales, Bangor.

==Early career==
Clwyd was a student teacher at Hope School in Flintshire, before training as a journalist. She then worked for BBC Wales as a studio manager, and then became Welsh correspondent for the &quot;Guardian&quot; and &quot;Observer&quot; newspapers during 1964–79.

She was vice-chair of the Arts Council of Wales from 1975 to 1979. She was a member of the National Union of Journalists and Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union.

==Parliamentary career==
Clwyd was persuaded to stand for Parliament by Huw T. Edwards, who felt that there should be more women in parliament. She was the unsuccessful Labour candidate in Denbigh in 1970 and Gloucester in October 1974.

From 1979 to 1984, Clwyd was the Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Mid and West Wales. She was elected to Parliament in a by-election in May 1984 following the death of Ioan Evans, and became the first woman to sit for a Welsh valleys constituency. Her election came in the midst of the biggest industrial dispute since 1926, which was the 1984-85 coal miners&#x27; strike, in one of the mining constituencies most deeply affected. On her maiden speech on 7 June 1984, on the subject of the strike, she opened her remarks by saying &quot;I am the new Member for Cynon Valley and will be the Member for a long time&quot;. This prediction bore out correctly as she would serve the constituency for 35 years, and is one of the longest-serving MPs in recent history. Clwyd served as Shadow Minister of Education and Women&#x27;s Rights from 1987, but was sacked in 1988 for rebelling against the party whip on further spending on nuclear weapons. She returned as Shadow Minister for Overseas Development from 1989 to 1992, and then served as Shadow Secretary of State for Wales in 1992 and for National Heritage from 1992 to 1993.

In January 1993, Clwyd was rebuked by the Speaker of the House of Commons Betty Boothroyd for parking her car in Speaker&#x27;s Court, without permission. This culminated in Boothroyd threatening to have Clwyd&#x27;s car clamped if she did it in future whereupon Clwyd desisted.

Clwyd was the Opposition Spokesperson for Employment from 1993 to 1994, and for Foreign Affairs from 1994 to 1995, when she was again sacked, along with Jim Cousins, for observing the Turkish invasion of Iraqi Kirkuk without permission. In 1994 she staged a sit-in down Tower Colliery in her constituency to protest at its closure. She was a member of the International Development Select Committee from 1997 to 2005. On 9 August 2004, she became a member of the Privy Council.

Clwyd was a vice-chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party from 2001 until 2005, and was elected as chair by 167 to 156 (beating Tony Lloyd) on 24 May 2005. However, on 5 December 2006 she was defeated by Lloyd by 11 votes when she sought re-election, with her closeness to Tony Blair being cited as a reason for her defeat.

During her parliamentary career, Clwyd served as Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Human Rights Group and the All Party Parliamentary Iraq Group. She was vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coalfield Communities, and Secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Cambodia. She was a former Chair of the British Group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), an Executive Member on the (IPU) Committee on Middle East Questions and an Executive Member on the (IPU) Coordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians.

In February 2014, after informing party leader Ed Miliband of her decision at the monthly meeting of the Cynon Valley Labour Party, Clwyd announced that she was to stand down at the 2015 general election. However, she subsequently changed her mind but was told that she would need to go through a reselection process as the procedure to find her successor had already been put in train by the Labour Party. On 13 December 2014, she was reselected from an all-women shortlist as the Labour Party candidate in Cynon Valley for the 2015 General Election.

Clwyd was one of 13 MPs to vote against triggering the 2017 General Election.

In the series of Parliamentary votes on Brexit in March 2019, Clwyd voted against the Labour Party whip and in favour of an amendment tabled by members of The Independent Group for a second public vote.

In September 2019, Clwyd announced again that she intended to retire at the next general election.

===Iraq===
Through her interest in human rights and international women&#x27;s rights, Clwyd became involved in the debate around the rule of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Whilst opposition spokesperson for Foreign Affairs, she was sacked along with Jim Cousins for observing the Turkish Army&#x27;s invasion of Iraqi Kirkuk without permission. From 1997 to 2005 Clwyd was a member of the International Development Select Committee.

On 12 March 2003, James Mahon made first mention of the claims that some Iraqis were killed in plastic shredders or woodchippers, when he addressed the House of Commons after returning from research in northern Iraq. Six days later, Clwyd wrote an article in &quot;The Times&quot; entitled &quot;See men shredded, then say you don&#x27;t back war,&quot; saying that an unnamed Iraqi had said that Saddam and Qusay Hussein fed opponents of their Baathist rule into a plastic shredder or woodchipper, and then used their shredded bodies as fish food. Later she would add that it was believed to be housed in Abu Ghraib prison, and spoke with an unidentified person who claimed the American-sourced shredders were dismantled &quot;just before the military got there&quot;. As the first journalist to state the unsubstantiated claim, the rolling effect of the gruesome verbal picture garnered wider media and international political support, including from Australian Prime Minister John Howard, for an invasion of Iraq. &quot;The Sun&quot;&#x27;s political editor Trevor Kavanagh wrote in February 2004 that as a result of Clwyd&#x27;s article &quot;Public opinion swung behind Tony Blair, as voters learned how Saddam fed dissidents feet first into industrial shredders.&quot; As she had been vocal and prominent in her concern for the situation in Iraq before the war, Tony Blair made her a Special Envoy on Human Rights in Iraq in the run-up to the war.

At the Chilcot Inquiry in February 2010, Clwyd explained why she supported the Iraq War. A month before the invasion, she had been on a visit to Kurdistan collecting evidence regarding human rights abuses. There she found people living in fear of a repeat of the 1988 Halabja massacre, where 5,000 Kurds had been killed in a gas attack. Whilst there she was taken by the wife of the [now] President of Iraq to the border of Iraq and Kurdistan, where she pointed towards the hillside and said: &quot;That’s where they are going to fire the chemical weapons from.&quot; On publication of the Chilcot report in July 2016, Clwyd remained unmoved: &quot;So would I have still voted in Parliament in 2003 to support military action in Iraq – with the benefit of hindsight and in light of the Chilcot report? Yes. No one will ever be able to convince me that the world is not better off without Saddam Hussein and his Baathist regime in power.&quot;

===NHS===
Clwyd was a member of the Royal Commission on the National Health Service 1976–79.

In December 2012 Clwyd publicly criticised the standard of nursing care that her husband Owen Roberts had received at the University Hospital of Wales when he was dying there in October 2012. She focussed on the lack of compassion shown to him.

In 2013, following the Stafford Enquiry report, she was appointed by the Prime Minister to advise on complaint handling in the NHS.

===Female genital mutilation===
In 2003, Clwyd was chosen for a place to introduce a Private member&#x27;s bill via a ballot of MPs. She was pressed by hundreds of pressure groups who wished to publicise their own groups, and promote their own proposals for legislation. She chose to introduce the Female Genital Mutilation Bill (to prohibit parents from sending, or taking, their daughters abroad for operations such as female circumcision), which was successfully enacted. Female circumcision itself had already been banned in 1985.

==Other positions==
Clwyd was admitted to the White Robe of the Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1991. She was an Honorary Fellow of the University of Wales, Bangor, and the North East Wales Institute of Higher Education, which awarded her a University of Wales honorary degree. She held an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from Trinity College, Carmarthen for her contribution to politics and as a human rights campaigner. She was a Member of the Arts Council 1975–1979 and the Vice Chair of the Welsh Arts Council 1975–97.

==Personal life==
In 1963, Ann Clwyd married Owen Dryhurst Roberts, a television director and producer. He died in October 2012, at the age of 73.

Clwyd died at her home in Cardiff on 21 July 2023, at the age of 86.

==Honours==
*Clwyd was sworn in as a member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council in 2004, giving her the honorific title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for Life.

<doc id="413894" wikidata="Q2858807" url="?curid=413894" title="Capital punishment in Indiana">
<text>Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the U.S. state of Indiana. The last person executed in the state, excluding federal executions in Terre Haute, was mass murderer Joseph Edward Corcoran in 2024.

Federal executions take place at the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute Indiana; however the state has no control over executions there.

The execution chamber, and men&#x27;s death row are in Indiana State Prison. Indiana Women&#x27;s Prison has housed women with death sentences.

Previously Indiana law required female death row inmates (not about to be executed) to be held at Indiana State Prison even though it was a male facility.

==Legal process==
When the prosecution seeks the death penalty, the sentence is decided by the jury and must be unanimous.

In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, the judge decides the sentence.

Indiana was one of the four states (alongside Alabama, Delaware and Florida) that had allowed a judge to override a jury&#x27;s recommendation of a life sentence to the death penalty or death penalty to a life sentence. The Indiana override statute was abolished in 2002.

The power of clemency belongs to the Governor of Indiana after receiving a non-binding advice from the Indiana Parole Board.

==Capital crimes==
The following constitutes murder with aggravating circumstances, which is the only capital crime in Indiana.

# The defendant committed the murder by intentionally killing the victim while committing or attempting to commit any of the following: arson, burglary, child molesting, criminal deviate conduct, kidnapping, rape, robbery, carjacking, criminal organization activity, dealing in cocaine or narcotic drug, or criminal confinement. 
# The defendant committed the murder by the unlawful detonation of an explosive with intent to injure a person or damage property.
# The defendant committed the murder by lying in wait.
# The defendant who committed the murder was hired to kill.
# The defendant committed the murder by hiring another person to kill.
# The victim of the murder was a corrections employee, probation officer, parole officer, community corrections worker, home detention officer, fireman, judge, or law enforcement officer, and either: the victim was acting in the course of duty; or the murder was motivated by an act the victim performed while acting in the course of duty.
# The defendant has been convicted of another murder.
# The defendant has committed another murder, at any time, regardless of whether the defendant has been convicted of that other murder.
# The defendant was: under the custody of the department of correction, under the custody of a county sheriff, on probation after receiving a sentence for the commission of a felony, or on parole, at the time the murder was committed. 
# The defendant dismembered the victim.
# The defendant: burned, mutilated, or tortured the victim, decapitated or attempted to decapitate the victim.
# The victim of the murder was less than 12 years of age.
# The victim was a victim of any of the following offenses for which the defendant was convicted: A battery offense, kidnapping, criminal confinement, or a sex crime.
# The victim of the murder was listed by the state or known by the defendant to be a witness against the defendant and the defendant committed the murder with the intent to prevent the person from testifying.
# The defendant committed the murder by intentionally discharging a firearm: into an inhabited dwelling, or from a vehicle.
# The victim of the murder was pregnant and the murder resulted in the intentional killing of a fetus that has attained viability.
# The defendant knowingly or intentionally committed the murder: in a building primarily used for an educational purpose, on school property, and when students are present; or committed the murder in a building or other structure owned or rented by a state educational institution or any other public or private postsecondary educational institution and primarily used for an educational purpose, and at a time when classes are in session.
# The murder is committed: in a building that is primarily used for religious worship, and at a time when persons are present for religious worship or education.

== History ==
=== Post-Furman ===
In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court in Furman v. Georgia held all state capital punishment sentencing statutes were unconstitutional. As a result, all seven men on Indiana&#x27;s death row at the time had their sentences reduced to life in prison. The Indiana General Assembly enacted a new death penalty sentencing statute to replace the statute struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in Furman in 1973. In 1977, the Indiana Supreme Court struck down Indiana&#x27;s 1973 capital punishment statute based on the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Woodson v. North Carolina. The death sentences of the eight men on Indiana&#x27;s death row were set aside. On October 1, 1977, a new Indiana capital punishment statute, modeled on statutes upheld by U.S. Supreme Court, took effect. It remains in effect today.

<doc id="413896" wikidata="Q2858821" url="?curid=413896" title="Capital punishment in California">
<text>Capital punishment is not allowed to be carried out in the U.S. state of California due to a standing 2006 federal court order against the practice and a 2019 moratorium on executions ordered by Governor Gavin Newsom. The litigation resulting in the court order has been on hold since the promulgation of the moratorium. Should the moratorium end and the freeze conclude, executions could resume under the current state law.

The state carried out 709 executions from 1778 until 1972 when the California Supreme Court struck down California&#x27;s capital punishment statute in the case &quot;People v. Anderson&quot;. California voters reinstated the death penalty a few months later, with Proposition 17 legalizing the death penalty in the state constitution and ending the &quot;Anderson&quot; ruling. However, in the interim, the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; imposed a nationwide moratorium on capital punishment. &quot;Furman&quot;, along with continued challenges at the state level, delayed implementation of Proposition 17 for several years. As a result, the death penalty was not restored in California until after &quot;People v. Frierson&quot; in 1979. The state&#x27;s first post-&quot;Anderson&quot; execution was carried out in 1992. Since that time, there have been 13 executions, yet hundreds of inmates have been sentenced. The last execution that took place in California was in 2006. Two people condemned in California, Kelvin Malone and Alfredo Prieto, have also been executed in Missouri and Virginia, respectively.

, official California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) records show that there are 598 inmates awaiting execution in California, the lowest it has been since 2011, primarily due to suicide, death from other causes, fewer juries willing to sentence people to death, and resentencings by newly elected district attorneys, among other things. 19 of those with death sentences are women, held in general population at Central California Women&#x27;s Facility (CCWF) in Chowchilla, with the other 579 inmates awaiting execution being men that are housed throughout the state, most having been transferred from the former death row at San Quentin State Prison.

California voters rejected two initiatives to repeal the death penalty by popular vote in 2012 and 2016, and they narrowly adopted in 2016 another proposal to expedite its appeal process. On August 26, 2021, the California Supreme Court upheld the state&#x27;s death penalty rules though as of 2024 executions have yet to resume.

==History==
===Pre-&quot;Furman&quot; and pre-&quot;Anderson&quot; history===
The first known death sentence in California was recorded in 1778. On April 6, 1778, four Kumeyaay chiefs from a Mission San Diego area ranchería were convicted of conspiring to kill Christians and were sentenced to death by José Francisco Ortega, Commandant of the Presidio of San Diego; the four were to be shot on April 11. However, there is some doubt whether the executions actually took place.

Four methods have been used historically for executions. Until slightly before California was admitted into the Union, executions were carried out by firing squad. Upon admission, the state adopted hanging as the method of choice.

The penal code was modified on February 14, 1872, to state that hangings were to take place inside the confines of the county jail or other private places. The only people allowed to be present were the county sheriff, a physician, and the county District Attorney, who would in addition select at least 12 &quot;reputable citizens&quot;. No more than two &quot;ministers of the gospel&quot; and no more than five people selected by the condemned could also be present.

Executions were moved to the state level in 1889 when the law was updated so that hangings would occur in one of the state prisons—San Quentin State Prison and Folsom State Prison. According to the California Department of Corrections, although the law did not require the trial judge to choose a specific prison, it was customary for recidivists to be sent to Folsom. Under these new laws, the first execution at San Quentin was Jose Gabriel on March 3, 1893, for murder. The first hanging at Folsom was Chin Hane, also for murder, on December 13, 1895. A total of 215 inmates were hanged at San Quentin and a total of 93 were hanged at Folsom.California adopted the gas chamber as its sole method in 1937 (though two more hangings took place for people already sentenced). The first people to die in the San Quentin gas chamber (the only one in the state) were Albert Kessell and Robert Lee Cannon on December 2, 1938. Three more people had their death sentences carried out within two weeks. Up until 1967, 194 people were executed by lethal gas, including four women. The last person was Aaron Mitchell on April 12, 1967.

In previous eras the California Institution for Women housed the death row for women.

===1972 abolition of capital punishment===
On April 24, 1972, the Supreme Court of California ruled in &quot;People v. Anderson&quot; that the state&#x27;s current death penalty laws were unconstitutional. Justice Marshall F. McComb was the lone dissenter, arguing that the death penalty deterred crime, noting numerous Supreme Court precedents upholding the death penalty&#x27;s constitutionality, and stating that the legislative and initiative processes were the only appropriate avenues to determine whether the death penalty should be allowed. The majority&#x27;s decision spared the lives of 105 death row inmates, including Sirhan Sirhan (assassin of Robert F. Kennedy) and serial killer Charles Manson. McComb was so outraged by the decision that he walked out of the courtroom during its reading.

Following the ruling, the Constitution of California was modified to reinstate capital punishment under an initiative called Proposition 17. In 1973 a new statute was subsequently enacted, making the death penalty mandatory for a number of crimes including first degree murder in specific instances, kidnapping during which a victim dies, train wrecking during which a victim dies, treason against the state, and assault by a life prisoner if the victim dies within a year.

The debate over capital punishment played out in a somewhat similar fashion on the national level. On June 29, 1972, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, resulting in a &quot;de facto&quot; moratorium on executions in the United States. On July 2, 1976, the Supreme Court, in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;, reviewing capital punishment laws enacted in response to its &quot;Furman&quot; decision, found constitutional those statutes that allowed a jury to impose the death penalty after consideration of both aggravating and mitigating circumstances. On the same date, the Court held that statutes imposing a mandatory death penalty were unconstitutional.

In a later decision in 1976, the Supreme Court of California again held the state&#x27;s death penalty statute was unconstitutional as it did not allow the defendant to enter mitigating evidence. A further 70 prisoners had their sentences commuted following this. The next year, the statute was updated to deal with these issues. Life imprisonment without possibility of parole was also added as a punishment for capital offenses. A later change to the statute occurred in 1978 after Proposition 7 was enacted. This gave an automatic appeal to the Supreme Court of California, which would directly affirm or reverse the sentence and conviction without going through an intermediate appeal to the California Courts of Appeal.

In 1983, The State Bar of California created The California Appellate Project as a legal resource center to implement the constitutional right to counsel for indigent persons facing execution. At around the time of its founding, Michael Millman became the director of CAP. Millman served as director of CAP for 30 years. CAP oversees the efforts to assist private lawyers representing the more than 700 people on California&#x27;s death row.

=== 1986 retention elections ===
On November 4, 1986, three members of the state supreme court were ousted from office by voters after a high-profile campaign that cited their categorical opposition to the death penalty.

This included chief justice Rose Bird, who was removed by a margin of 67 to 33 percent. She reviewed a total of 64 capital cases appealed to the court, in each instance issuing a decision overturning the death penalty that had been imposed at trial. She was joined in her decision to overturn by at least three other members of the court in 61 of those cases. This led Bird&#x27;s critics to claim that she was substituting her own opinions and ideas for the laws and precedents upon which judicial decisions are supposed to be made.

===Resumption of executions and introduction of lethal injection===

On April 21, 1992, the state carried out its first execution since 1967 by putting to death Robert Alton Harris for the murders of two teenage boys in San Diego. A series of four stays of execution issued by the Ninth Circuit appeal court delayed the execution, causing the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene to vacate the stays and prohibit all other federal courts from any further intervention, ruling that the lower court decisions caused &quot;abusive delays&quot; and were &quot;attempts to manipulate the judicial process&quot;.

The available methods were expanded to two in January 1993, with lethal gas as the standard but with lethal injection offered as a choice for the inmate. David Mason, the first inmate to have this choice, made no selection, so was executed by the lethal gas default in August 1993. Following a legal challenge and Ninth Circuit appeal court decision in 1996, lethal gas was suspended, with lethal injection becoming the only method. Serial killer William Bonin was the first person to be executed under these new laws, on February 23, 1996. Thirteen people have been executed in California since the death penalty was reinstated in 1977, though 180 other people have died on death row from other causes (30 of them from suicide) as of December 16, 2024.

=== Lethal injection litigation ===

During the term of Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor, the state carried out two prominent executions in less than five weeks, with Stanley Tookie Williams in December 2005 and Clarence Ray Allen in January 2006.

A month later, in February 2006, U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy D. Fogel blocked the execution of convicted murderer Michael Morales because of a lawsuit against the lethal injection protocol. It was argued that if the three-drug lethal injection procedure were administered incorrectly, it could lead to suffering for the condemned, potentially constituting cruel and unusual punishment. The issue arose from an injunction made by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals which held that an execution could only be carried out by a medical technician legally authorized to administer intravenous medications. The case led to a de facto moratorium of capital punishment in California as the state was unable to obtain the services of a licensed medical professional to carry out the execution.

When the state planned the execution of Albert Greenwood Brown in late 2010, Judge Fogel declined to issue a stay, citing the efforts the state made to comply with his earlier ruling. Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit disagreed and vacated the judgment, further delaying executions in the state.

=== Studies ===
The state supreme court proposed in 2007 that the state adopt a constitutional amendment allowing the assignment of capital appeals to the courts of appeal to alleviate the backlog of such cases.

Several victims&#x27; families testified to the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice in opposition to capital punishment, explaining that while they had suffered great losses, they did not view retribution as morally acceptable, and that the high cost of capital punishment was preventing the solving of cold cases.

But others who contest this argument said the greater cost of trials where the prosecution does seek the death penalty is offset by the savings from avoiding trial altogether in cases where the defendant pleads guilty to avoid the death penalty.

The California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice in 2008 concluded after an extensive review that under the current death penalty system, death sentences are unlikely ever to be carried out (with extremely rare exceptions) because of a process &quot;plagued with excessive delay&quot; in the appointment of post-conviction counsel and a &quot;severe backlog&quot; in the California Supreme Court&#x27;s review of death judgments. According to CCFAJ&#x27;s report, the lapse of time from sentence of death to execution constitutes the longest delay of any death penalty state, and the Commission urged reform to expedite the appeal process.

Another study released in 2011 found that since 1978 capital punishment has cost California about $4 billion. A 2011 article by Arthur Alarcon, long-time judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal, and law professor Paula Mitchell, concluded that &quot;since reinstating the death penalty in 1978, California taxpayers have spent roughly $4 billion to fund a dysfunctional death penalty system that has carried out no more than 13 executions.&quot;

=== Proposition 34, the SAFE California Act ===
A coalition of death penalty opponents including law enforcement officials, murder victims&#x27; family members, and wrongly convicted people launched an initiative campaign for the &quot;Savings, Accountability, and Full Enforcement for California Act,&quot; or SAFE California, in the 2011–12 election cycle. The measure, which became Proposition 34, would replace the death penalty with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, require people sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole to work in order to pay restitution to victims&#x27; families, and allocate approximately $30 million per year for three years to police departments for the purpose of solving open murder and rape cases. Supporters of the measure raised $6.5 million, dwarfing the $1 million raised by opponents of Proposition 34.

The proposition was defeated with 52% against and 48% in favor.

=== July 2014 and November 2015 federal decisions ===
On July 16, 2014, federal judge Cormac J. Carney of the United States District Court ruled that California&#x27;s death penalty system is unconstitutional because it is arbitrary and plagued with delay. The state has not executed a prisoner since 2006. The judge stated that the current system violates the Eighth Amendment&#x27;s ban on cruel and unusual punishment by imposing a sentence that &quot;no rational jury or legislature could ever impose: life in prison, with the remote possibility of death.&quot;

However, on November 12, 2015, a panel of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the district court&#x27;s ruling in a 3-0 published decision. The three judges held that the claim was not justiciable under federal habeas corpus.

===2015 state lawsuit===
In February 2015, Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Shelleyanne Chang ruled that state law compelled the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to develop a way to execute inmates by lethal injection. Later that year a new protocol providing a single-drug execution method was developed to comply with the ruling.

This was the result of a lawsuit brought by family members of murder victims. Supporters of capital punishment blamed the nearly three-year wait for a new protocol on &quot;lack of political will&quot; and attempt to render the death penalty &quot;impractical and then argue for repeal on the grounds of practicality&quot;.

=== Propositions 62 and 66 ===
On November 8, 2016, California voted on two competing initiatives about capital punishment. Proposition 62 which, as Proposition 34, would have abolished the death penalty, was rejected by a 53–47 margin. The other initiative, Proposition 66, provides the streamlining of the capital appeal process, and also requires death-row offenders to work in jail and pay restitution to victims families, something they were previously exempted from. The measure passed 51–49. Its constitutionality was upheld 5–2 by the state supreme court on August 24, 2017, though the court held that one provision requiring it to decide direct appeals of capital cases within five years was directive rather than mandatory. The court ordered that Prop 66 take effect after this decision becomes final.

===2019 moratorium on capital punishment===
Governor Gavin Newsom promulgated Executive Order N-09-19 on March 13, 2019. Executive Order N-09-19 orders that:

The Executive Order granted everybody sentenced to death under California law a reprieve while also eliminating any mechanism that the state could use to execute an individual by repealing the lethal injection protocol adopted by the State of California. If the Executive Order was rescinded and all lawsuits challenging the use of capital punishment in the state are resolved executions would not resume immediately since the state would need to adopt a new execution protocol which requires time to do so. The Executive Order also closed the Death Chamber at San Quentin State Prison. The Death Chamber was subsequently dismantled by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Although some pro-death penalty advocates have stated otherwise, no person sentenced to death in California was released or had their conviction or sentence altered due to the promulgation of the Executive Order.

===&quot;People v. McDaniel&quot; and possible striking down of capital punishment===
Donte McDaniel, a condemned inmate, was sentenced to death in 2004 and has challenged his death sentence by challenging California&#x27;s sentencing statutes that only require convictions to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and to be unanimous but not requiring either for sentencing decisions. Therefore, under current law, a defendant needs to be found guilty by all jurors beyond a reasonable doubt but the jury does not need to be unanimous to find true any aggravating circumstances that makes one eligible to be sentenced to death, nor does the jury have to find those circumstances to be true beyond a reasonable doubt. If the Supreme Court of California rules in McDaniel&#x27;s favor, hundreds of death sentences would be overturned and the court may strike down capital punishment in the state in its entirety. McDaniel has received the support of Governor Gavin Newsom along with the county district attorneys of Contra Costa, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Joaquin, and Santa Clara counties, along with former Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti in an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief filed with the court.

===Proposed 2022 constitutional ban on capital punishment===
On December 7, 2020, Assembly members Marc Levine (D-10) and David Chiu (D-17) introduced Assembly Constitutional Amendment 2 in the California State Legislature. The constitutional amendment would amend the constitution to prohibit the use of capital punishment as a punishment for any violations of law. The amendment is coauthored by Assembymembers Laura Friedman (D-43), Mike Gipson (D-64), and Mark Stone (D-29), along with state senator Scott Wiener (D-11). The resolution needs a 2/3 majority of each house of the Legislature before the resolution can be placed before the voters during the 2022 California elections. If more voters vote Yes than No on the question in 2022, the state constitution will be amended to prohibit the use of capital punishment in California as a punishment for any violations of law. The resolution failed to advance to the Assembly floor from the Assembly Committee on Public Safety.

===2021 state Supreme Court ruling===
On August 26, 2021, efforts to overhaul California&#x27;s death penalty were weakened after the California State Supreme Court unanimously ruled that current state law provided little legal support for any overhaul in the case of People v McDaniel.

==Current legislation==
===Legal process===
When the prosecution seeks the death penalty, the sentence is decided by the jury and must be unanimous. A death sentence is automatically considered to have been requested for reconsideration, and the judge must find that the &quot;jury&#x27;s findings and verdicts that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances are contrary to law or the evidence presented.&quot;

A jury must unanimously find that one of the special circumstances outlined in the death penalty statute apply to the case. If the jury is not unanimous, the court will retry the question of whether the special circumstances that were not unanimously decided upon apply or not before a new jury. Subsequent retrials on issues not unanimously decided upon occur at the discretion of the court, which may alternatively impose a sentence of 25 years in prison.

In case of a hung jury during the penalty determination in the penalty phase of the trial, a retrial happens before another jury. If the second or any subsequent jury is also deadlocked, the judge has discretion to order another retrial or impose a life without parole sentence.

Under the state Constitution, the power of clemency belongs to the Governor of California. But if the offender was twice convicted of a felony, the governor can grant a commutation only on recommendation of the Supreme Court of California, with at least four judges concurring.

Executions are carried out by lethal injection, but an inmate sentenced before its adoption may elect to be executed by gas inhalation instead. If one of these two methods is held invalid, the state is required to use the other method.

===Capital offenses===
California has one of America&#x27;s broadest lists of capital crimes and capital circumstances. The Penal Code provides for the possibility for a sentence of death for:

====Of crimes against the person====
*first-degree murder with special circumstances
**for financial gain (1)
**the defendant had previously been convicted of first or second degree murder (2)
**multiple murders (3)
**committed using explosives (4); (6)
**to avoid arrest or aiding in escaping custody (5)
**the victim was an on-duty peace officer; federal law enforcement officer or agent; or firefighter (7); (8); (9)
**the victim was a witness to a crime and the murder was committed to prevent them from testifying (10)
**the victim was a prosecutor or assistant prosecutor; judge or former judge; elected or appointed official; juror; and the murder was in retaliation for the victim&#x27;s official duties (11); (12); (13); (20)
**the murder was &quot;especially , , or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity&quot; (14)
**the murderer lay in wait for the victim (15)
**the victim was intentionally killed because of their race, religion, nationality, or sexual orientation (a hate crime) (16)
**the murder was committed during the committing of a robbery; kidnapping; rape; sodomy; performance of a lewd or lascivious act upon the person of a child under the age of 14 years; oral copulation; burglary; arson; train wrecking; mayhem; rape by instrument; carjacking; torture; poisoning (17)
**the murder was intentional and involved the infliction of torture (18)
**poisoning (19)
**the murder was committed by discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle (21)
**the defendant is an active member of a criminal street gang and was to further the activities of the gang (22)
*train wrecking which leads to a person&#x27;s death
*fatal assault by a person under a life sentence, subject to the year and a day rule.
*aiding, abetting, counseling, commanding, inducing, soliciting, requesting, or assisting in the commission of a felony enumerated in above in enhancement 17, with reckless indifference to human life and as a major participant, which results in a death, even if the defendant is not the actual killer.

Due to the number of capital circumstances in California, almost every first-degree murder is punishable by death.

====Of crimes against the state====
*treason against the state of California, defined as levying war against the state, adhering to its enemies, or giving them aid and comfort
*perjury or subornation of perjury causing execution of an innocent person

Additionally, the Military and Veterans Code provides for possible capital punishment in either of the following if such act or acts, or failure to act, results in a death:
*intentionally and maliciously destroying, impairing, injuring, interfering, or tampering with real or personal property with reasonable grounds to believe that such act will hinder, delay, or interfere with the preparation of the United States or any of the states from preparing for war, or any foreign nation which assistance by the United States is in connection with that nation&#x27;s defense; or
*intentionally and maliciously making or causing to be made or intentionally and maliciously omitting to note on inspection any defect in any article or thing with reasonable grounds to believe that such article or thing is intended to be used in connection with the preparation of the United States or any state for defense or for war, or for the prosecution of war by the United States, or with the rendering of assistance by the United States to any other nation in connection with that nation&#x27;s defense, or that such article or thing is one of a number of similar articles or things, some of which are intended so to be used.

==Death row and execution chamber==
===Former procedure===

Men condemned to death in California were (with some exceptions) typically held at San Quentin State Prison, with condemned women being held at Central California Women&#x27;s Facility (CCWF) in Chowchilla. San Quentin also houses the state execution chamber, although it is now permanently closed. Women executed in California would have been transported to San Quentin before being put to death.

===Current statistics===
, official California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) records show 598 inmates sentenced to death in California, the lowest it has been since 2011, primarily due to suicide, death from other causes, fewer juries willing to sentence people to death, and resentencing by newly elected progressive district attorneys, among other things. 19 of those so sentenced are women, held at Central California Women&#x27;s Facility (CCWF) in Chowchilla.

===Dismantling of death rows===
On January 31, 2022, Governor Gavin Newsom announced that the current death row at San Quentin State Prison will be dismantled within two years and that the inmates housed at said facility will be transferred to other maximum security state prisons. In that time, the death row at San Quentin will be repurposed &quot;into something innovative and anchored in rehabilitation,&quot; according to corrections&#x27; spokeswoman Vicky Waters. Inmates transferred will be required to work paid prison jobs, albeit that 70% of their wages will be withheld and designated as restitution to the families of the relevant victims. A pilot program removed 116 condemned men to other facilities between 2020 and 2022. The women incarcerated at Chowchilla State Prison also had the opportunity to move to less restrictive housing and work programs. By February 5, 2025, all but 9 of the male inmates had been moved out of San Quentin, with the last group expected to transfer after completing medical and psychiatric programs. All women on death row at Chowchilla had been moved to general population.

===Racial makeup of death row===
, Black people constitute a plurality of inmates sentenced to death, with 32.61% of inmates sentenced to death being Black. The second largest group of people sentenced to death are White (31.10%), while Hispanics/Mexicans are the third largest group of people sentenced to death (27.76%).

==Criticisms==
In 2008, the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice criticized the high number of aggravating factors as giving to local prosecutors too much discretion in picking cases where they believe capital punishment is warranted. The Commission proposed to reduce them to only five (multiple murders, torture murder, murder of a police officer, murder committed in jail, and murder related to another felony). Columnist Charles Lane went further, and proposed that murder related to a felony other than rape should no longer be a capital crime when there is only one victim killed.

In 2021, the California Committee on Revision of Penal Code unanimously voted to recommend that the Legislature to abolish capital punishment in the state. A staff justified the vote by issuing a memorandum that states that &quot;[e]liminating the death penalty is a critical step towards creating a fair and equitable justice system for all in California, as the ultimate punishment is plagued by legal, racial, bureaucratic, financial, geographic, and moral problems that have proven intractable.&quot;

==Public opinion==
The Field Research Corporation found in February 2004 that when asked how they personally felt about capital punishment, 68% supported it and 31% opposed it (6% offered no opinion). This was a decrease from 72% support two years previous, and an increase from 63% in 2000. This poll was asked about the time that Kevin Cooper had his execution stayed hours before his scheduled death after 20 years on death row. When asked if they thought the death penalty was generally fair and free of error in California, 58% agreed and 32% disagreed (11% offered no opinion). When the results were broken down along ethnicity, of the people who identified themselves as African American, 57% disagreed that the death penalty was fair and free of error.

A poll in March 2012 found that &quot;61% of registered voters from the state of California say they would vote to keep the death penalty, should a death penalty initiative appear on the November 2012 ballot&quot; An August 2012 poll found that &quot;support for Prop 34, which would repeal California&#x27;s death penalty, fell from 45.5% to 35.9%.&quot;

A PPIC poll from September 2012 showed that 55% of all adults and 50% of likely voters prefer life in prison without the possibility of parole over the death penalty when given the choice.

A Field Poll in September 2014 showed that 56% support the death penalty, down from 69% three years earlier. Support for the death penalty in California had not been at this low a level since the mid-1960s.

A UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll in 2019 found that 61% of California&#x27;s registered voters supported the death penalty, with 39% opposed. However, this polls did not have an &quot;undecided&quot; option.

A UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll in April 2021 found that 44% of California&#x27;s registered voters supported a proposed 2022 constitutional amendment to abolish the death penalty, with 35% opposed and 21% undecided. 48% supported Governor Gavin Newsom&#x27;s death penalty moratorium executive order, with 35% opposed. The poll found sharp racial and partisan divides on support for the death penalty in the state, with Democrats opposing it 63%-37% and Republicans supporting it 68%-32%. No party preference voters opposed it 43%-31%. Among registered voters, 54% of African-Americans, 46% of whites, 41% of Latinos, and 38% of Asian and Pacific Islanders supported abolition.
