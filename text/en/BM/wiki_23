<text>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport primary urine. RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 90–95% of cases. It is more common in men (with a male-to-female ratio of up to 2:1). It is most commonly diagnosed in the elderly (especially in people over 75 years of age).

Initial treatment is most commonly either partial or complete removal of the affected kidney(s). Where the cancer has not metastasised (spread to other organs) or burrowed deeper into the tissues of the kidney, the five-year survival rate is 65–90%, but this is lowered considerably when the cancer has spread.

The body is remarkably good at hiding the symptoms and as a result people with RCC often have advanced disease by the time it is discovered. The initial symptoms of RCC often include blood in the urine (occurring in 40% of affected persons at the time they first seek medical attention), flank pain (40%), a mass in the abdomen or flank (25%), weight loss (33%), fever (20%), high blood pressure (20%), night sweats and generally feeling unwell. When RCC metastasises, it most commonly spreads to the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, adrenal glands, brain or bones. Immunotherapy and targeted therapy have improved the outlook for metastatic RCC.

RCC is also associated with a number of paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) which are conditions caused by either the hormones produced by the tumour or by the body&#x27;s attack on the tumour and are present in about 20% of those with RCC. These syndromes most commonly affect tissues which have not been invaded by the cancer. The most common PNSs seen in people with RCC are: high blood calcium levels, high red blood cell count, high platelet count and secondary amyloidosis.
== Signs and symptoms ==
Historically, medical practitioners expected a person to present with three findings. This classic triad is 1: haematuria, which is when there is blood present in the urine, 2: flank pain, which is pain on the side of the body between the hip and ribs, and 3: an abdominal mass, similar to bloating but larger. It is now known that this classic triad of symptoms only occurs in 10–15% of cases, and is usually indicative that the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is in an advanced stage. Today, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is often asymptomatic, meaning it presents no symptoms, and is commonly detected incidentally during examinations for unrelated medical conditions. The percentage of asymptomatic and incidentally diagnosed RCC cases, particularly smaller tumors, has continued to rise in recent years.

Other signs and symptom may include haematuria; loin pain; abdominal mass; malaise, which is a general feeling of unwellness; weight loss and/or loss of appetite; anaemia resulting from depression of erythropoietin; erythrocytosis (increased production of red blood cells) due to increased erythropoietin secretion; varicocele, which is seen in males as an enlargement of the pampiniform plexus of veins draining the testis (more often the left testis) hypertension (high blood pressure) resulting from secretion of renin by the tumour; hypercalcemia, which is elevation of calcium levels in the blood; sleep disturbance or night sweats; recurrent fevers; and chronic fatigue.

== Risk factors ==

=== Lifestyle ===
The greatest risk factors for RCC are lifestyle-related: smoking, obesity and hypertension (high blood pressure) have been estimated to account for up to 50% of cases.
Occupational exposure to some chemicals such as asbestos, cadmium, lead, chlorinated solvents, petrochemicals and PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has been examined by multiple studies with inconclusive results.
Another suspected risk factor is the long term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS).

Finally, studies have found that women who have had a hysterectomy are at more than double the risk of developing RCC than those who have not. Moderate alcohol consumption, on the other hand, has been shown to have a protective effect.

=== Genetics ===
Hereditary factors have a minor impact on individual susceptibility with immediate relatives of people with RCC having a two to fourfold increased risk of developing the condition. Other genetically linked conditions also increase the risk of RCC, including hereditary papillary renal carcinoma, hereditary leiomyomatosis, Birt–Hogg–Dube syndrome, hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, familial papillary thyroid carcinoma, von Hippel–Lindau disease and sickle cell disease.

The most significant disease affecting risk however is not genetically linked – patients with acquired cystic disease of the kidney requiring dialysis are 30 times more likely than the general population to develop RCC.

== Pathophysiology ==
The tumour arises from the cells of the proximal renal tubular epithelium. It is considered an adenocarcinoma. There are two subtypes: sporadic (that is, non-hereditary) and hereditary. Both such subtypes are associated with mutations in the short-arm of chromosome 3, with the implicated genes being either tumour suppressor genes (VHL and TSC) or oncogenes (like c-Met).

== Diagnosis ==

The first steps taken to diagnose this condition are consideration of the signs and symptoms, and a medical history (the detailed medical review of past health state) to evaluate any risk factors. Based on the symptoms presented, a range of biochemical tests (using blood and/or urine samples) may also be considered as part of the screening process to provide sufficient quantitative analysis of any differences in electrolytes, kidney and liver function, and blood clotting times. Upon physical examination, palpation of the abdomen may reveal the presence of a mass or an organ enlargement.

Although this disease lacks characterization in the early stages of tumor development, considerations based on diverse clinical manifestations, as well as resistance to radiation and chemotherapy are important. The main diagnostic tools for detecting renal cell carcinoma are ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the kidneys.

=== Classification ===
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not a single entity, but rather a collection of different types of tumours, each derived from the various parts of the nephron (epithelium or renal tubules) and possessing distinct genetic characteristics, histological features, and, to some extent, clinical phenotypes.

Array-based karyotyping can be used to identify characteristic chromosomal aberrations in renal tumors with challenging morphology. Array-based karyotyping performs well on paraffin embedded tumours and is amenable to routine clinical use. See also Virtual Karyotype for CLIA certified laboratories offering array-based karyotyping of solid tumours.

The 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of genitourinary tumours recognizes over 40 subtypes of renal neoplasms. Since the publication of the latest iteration of the WHO classification in 2004, several novel renal tumour subtypes have been described:
* Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma with smooth muscle stroma
* Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma (MTSCC) 
* Multilocular cystic clear cell renal cell carcinoma
* Tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma
* Thyroid-like follicular renal cell carcinoma
* Acquired cystic kidney disease-associated renal cell carcinoma
* Renal cell carcinoma with t(6;11) translocation (TFEB)
* Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe renal cell carcinoma
* Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC)

=== Laboratory tests ===
Laboratory tests are generally conducted when the patient presents with signs and symptoms that may be characteristic of kidney impairment. They are not primarily used to diagnose kidney cancer, due to its asymptomatic nature and are generally found incidentally during tests for other illnesses such as gallbladder disease. In other words, these cancers are not detected usually because they do not cause pain or discomfort when they are discovered. Laboratory analysis can provide an assessment on the overall health of the patient and can provide information in determining the staging and degree of metastasis to other parts of the body (if a renal lesion has been identified) before treatment is given.

==== Urine analysis ====
The presence of blood in urine is a common presumptive sign of renal cell carcinoma. The haemoglobin of the blood causes the urine to be rusty, brown or red in colour. Alternatively, urinalysis can test for sugar, protein and bacteria which can also serve as indicators for cancer. A complete blood cell count can also provide additional information regarding the severity and spreading of the cancer.

==== Complete blood cell count ====
The CBC provides a quantified measure of the different cells in the whole blood sample from the patient. Such cells examined for in this test include red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes). A common sign of renal cell carcinoma is anaemia whereby the patient exhibits deficiency in red blood cells. CBC tests are vital as a screening tool for examination the health of patient prior to surgery. Inconsistencies with platelet counts are also common amongst these cancer patients and further coagulation tests, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) should be considered.

==== Blood chemistry ====
Blood chemistry tests are conducted if renal cell carcinoma is suspected as cancer has the potential to elevate levels of particular chemicals in blood. For example, liver enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are found to be at abnormally high levels. The staging of the cancer can also be determined by abnormal elevated levels of calcium, which suggests that the cancer may have metastasised to the bones. In this case, a doctor should be prompted for a CT scan. Blood chemistry tests also assess the overall function of the kidneys and can allow the doctor to decide upon further radiological tests.

=== Radiology ===
The characteristic appearance of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a solid renal lesion which disturbs the renal contour. It will frequently have an irregular or lobulated margin and may be seen as a lump on the lower pelvic or abdomen region. Traditionally, 85 to 90% of solid renal masses will turn out to be RCC but cystic renal masses may also be due to RCC. However, the advances of diagnostic modalities are able to incidentally diagnose a great proportion of patients with renal lesions that may appear to be small in size and of benign state. Ten percent of RCC will contain calcifications, and some contain macroscopic fat (likely due to invasion and encasement of the perirenal fat).

Deciding on the benign or malignant nature of the renal mass on the basis of its localized size is an issue as renal cell carcinoma may also be cystic. As there are several benign cystic renal lesions (simple renal cyst, haemorrhagic renal cyst, multilocular cystic nephroma, polycystic kidney disease), it may occasionally be difficult for the radiologist to differentiate a benign cystic lesion from a malignant one. The Bosniak classification system for cystic renal lesions classifies them into groups that are benign and those that need surgical resection, based on specific imaging features.

The main imaging tests performed in order to identify renal cell carcinoma are pelvic and abdominal CT scans, ultrasound tests of the kidneys (ultrasonography), MRI scans, intravenous pyelogram (IVP) or renal angiography. Among these main diagnostic tests, other radiologic tests such as excretory urography, positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning, ultrasonography, arteriography, venography, and bone scanning can also be used to aid in the evaluation of staging renal masses and to differentiate non-malignant tumours from malignant tumours.

==== Computed tomography ====
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scanning is routinely used to determine the stage of the renal cell carcinoma in the abdominal and pelvic regions. CT scans have the potential to distinguish solid masses from cystic masses and may provide information on the localization, stage or spread of the cancer to other organs of the patient. Key parts of the human body which are examined for metastatic involvement of renal cell carcinoma may include the renal vein, lymph node and the involvement of the inferior vena cava. According to a study conducted by Sauk et al., multidetector CT imaging characteristics have applications in diagnosing patients with clear renal cell carcinoma by depicting the differences of these cells at the cytogenic level.

==== Ultrasound ====
Ultrasonographic examination can be useful in evaluating questionable asymptomatic kidney tumours and cystic renal lesions if computed tomography imaging is inconclusive. This safe and non-invasive radiologic procedure uses high frequency sound waves to generate an interior image of the body on a computer monitor. The image generated by the ultrasound can help diagnose renal cell carcinoma based on the differences of sound reflections on the surface of organs and the abnormal tissue masses. Essentially, ultrasound tests can determine whether the composition of the kidney mass is mainly solid or filled with fluid.

A percutaneous biopsy can be performed by a radiologist using ultrasound or computed tomography to guide sampling of the tumour for the purpose of diagnosis by pathology. However this is not routinely performed because when the typical imaging features of renal cell carcinoma are present, the possibility of an incorrectly negative result together with the risk of a medical complication to the patient may make it unfavourable from a risk-benefit perspective. However, biopsy tests for molecular analysis to distinguish benign from malignant renal tumours is of investigative interest.

==== Magnetic resonance imaging ====
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans provide an image of the soft tissues in the body using radio waves and strong magnets. MRI can be used instead of CT if the patient exhibits an allergy to the contrast media administered for the test. Sometimes prior to the MRI scan, an intravenous injection of a contrasting material called gadolinium is given to allow for a more detailed image. Patients on dialysis or those who have renal insufficiency should avoid this contrasting material as it may induce a rare, yet severe, side effect known as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. A bone scan or brain imaging is not routinely performed unless signs or symptoms suggest potential metastatic involvement of these areas.
MRI scans should also be considered to evaluate tumour extension which has grown in major blood vessels, including the vena cava, in the abdomen. MRI can be used to observe the possible spread of cancer to the brain or spinal cord should the patient present symptoms that suggest this might be the case.

==== Intravenous pyelogram ====
Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is a useful procedure in detecting the presence of abnormal renal mass in the urinary tract. This procedure involves the injection of a contrasting dye into the arm of the patient. The dye travels from the blood stream and into the kidneys which in time, passes into the kidneys and bladder. This test is not necessary if a CT or MRI scan has been conducted.

==== Renal angiography ====
Renal angiography uses the same principle as IVP, as this type of X-ray also uses a contrasting dye. This radiologic test is important in diagnosing renal cell carcinoma as an aid for examining blood vessels in the kidneys. This diagnostic test relies on the contrasting agent which is injected in the renal artery to be absorbed by the cancerous cells. The contrasting dye provides a clearer outline of abnormally-oriented blood vessels believed to be involved with the tumour. This is imperative for surgeons as it allows the patient&#x27;s blood vessels to be mapped prior to operation.

=== Staging ===
The staging of renal cell carcinoma is the most important factor in predicting its prognosis. Staging can follow the TNM staging system, where the size and extent of the tumour (T), involvement of lymph nodes (N) and metastases (M) are classified separately. Also, it can use overall stage grouping into stage I–IV, with the 1997 revision of AJCC described below:
At diagnosis, 30% of renal cell carcinomas have spread to the ipsilateral renal vein, and 5–10% have continued into the inferior vena cava.

=== Histopathology ===


The gross and microscopic appearance of renal cell carcinomas is highly variable. The renal cell carcinoma may present reddened areas where blood vessels have bled, and cysts containing watery fluids. The body of the tumour shows large blood vessels that have walls composed of cancerous cells.
Gross examination often shows a yellowish, multilobulated tumor in the renal cortex, which frequently contains zones of necrosis, haemorrhage and scarring. In a microscopic context, there are four major histologic subtypes of renal cell cancer: clear cell (conventional RCC, 75%), papillary (15%), chromophobic (5%), and collecting duct (2%). Sarcomatoid changes (morphology and patterns of IHC that mimic sarcoma, spindle cells) can be observed within any RCC subtype and are associated with more aggressive clinical course and worse prognosis. Under light microscopy, these tumour cells can exhibit papillae, tubules or nests, and are quite large, atypical, and polygonal.

Recent studies have brought attention to the close association of the type of cancerous cells to the aggressiveness of the condition. Some studies suggest that these cancerous cells accumulate glycogen and lipids, their cytoplasm appear &quot;clear&quot;, the nuclei remain in the middle of the cells, and the cellular membrane is evident. Some cells may be smaller, with eosinophilic cytoplasm, resembling normal tubular cells. The stroma is reduced, but well vascularised. The tumour compresses the surrounding parenchyma, producing a pseudocapsule.

The most common cell type exhibited by renal cell carcinoma is the clear cell, which is named by the dissolving of the cells&#x27; high lipid content in the cytoplasm. The clear cells are thought to be the least likely to spread and usually respond more favourably to treatment. However, most of the tumours contain a mixture of cells. The most aggressive stage of renal cancer is believed to be the one in which the tumour is mixed, containing both clear and granular cells.

The recommended histologic grading schema for RCC is the Fuhrman system (1982), which is an assessment based on the microscopic morphology of a neoplasm with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E staining). This system categorises renal cell carcinoma with grades 1, 2, 3, 4 based on nuclear characteristics. The details of the Fuhrman grading system for RCC are shown below:

Nuclear grade is believed to be one of the most imperative prognostic factors in patients with renal cell carcinoma. However, a study by Delahunt et al. (2007) has shown that the Fuhrman grading is ideal for clear cell carcinoma but may not be appropriate for chromophobe renal cell carcinomas and that the staging of cancer (accomplished by CT scan) is a more favourable predictor of the prognosis of this disease. In relation to renal cancer staging, the Heidelberg classification system of renal tumours was introduced in 1976 as a means of more completely correlating the histopathological features with the identified genetic defects.

==Prevention==
The risk of renal cell carcinoma can be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight.

== Management ==

The type of treatment depends on multiple factors and the individual, some of which include the stage of renal cell carcinoma (organs and parts of the body affected/unaffected), type of renal cell carcinoma, pre-existing or comorbid conditions and overall health and age of the person.
Every form of treatment has both risks and benefits; a health care professional will provide the best options that suit the individual circumstances.

If it has spread outside of the kidneys, often into the lymph nodes, the lungs or the main vein of the kidney, then multiple therapies are used including surgery and medications. RCC is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in most cases but does respond well to immunotherapy with interleukin-2 or interferon-alpha, biologic, or targeted therapy. In early-stage cases, cryotherapy and surgery are the preferred options.

=== Active surveillance ===
Active surveillance or &quot;watchful waiting&quot; is becoming more common as small renal masses or tumours are being detected and also within the older generation when surgery is not always suitable. Active surveillance involves completing various diagnostic procedures, tests and imaging to monitor the progression of the RCC before embarking on a more high risk treatment option like surgery. In the elderly, patients with co-morbidities, and in poor surgical candidates, this is especially useful.

=== Surgery ===
Different procedures may be most appropriate, depending on circumstances.

The recommended treatment for renal cell cancer may be nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy, surgical removal of all or part of the kidney. This may include some of the surrounding organs or tissues or lymph nodes. If cancer is only in the kidneys, which is about 60% of cases, it can be cured roughly 90% of the time with surgery.

Small renal tumors (&lt; 4 cm) are treated increasingly by partial nephrectomy when possible. Most of these small renal masses manifest indolent biological behavior with excellent prognosis. Nephron-sparing partial nephrectomy is used when the tumor is small (less than 4 cm in diameter) or when the patient has other medical concerns such as diabetes or hypertension. The partial nephrectomy involves the removal of the affected tissue only, sparing the rest of the kidney, Gerota&#x27;s fascia and the regional lymph nodes. This allows for more renal preservation as compared to the radical nephrectomy, and this can have positive long-term health benefits. Larger and more complex tumors can also be treated with partial nephrectomy by surgeons with a lot of kidney surgery experience.

Surgical nephrectomy may be &quot;radical&quot; if the procedure removes the entire affected kidney including Gerota&#x27;s fascia, the adrenal gland which is on the same side as the affected kidney, and the regional retroperitoneal lymph nodes, all at the same time. This method, although severe, is effective. But it is not always appropriate, as it is a major surgery that contains the risk of complication both during and after the surgery and can have a longer recovery time. It is important to note that the other kidney must be fully functional, and this technique is most often used when there is a large tumour present in only one kidney.
In cases where the tumor has spread into the renal vein, inferior vena cava, and possibly the right atrium, this portion of the tumor can be surgically removed, as well. When the tumor involved the inferior vena cava, it is important to classify which parts of the vena cava are involved and to plan accordingly, as sometimes complete resection will involve an incision into the chest with increased morbidity. For this reason, Dr. Gaetano Ciancio adapted liver mobilization techniques from liver transplant to address retrohepatic or even suprahepatic inferior vena caval thrombus associated with renal tumors. With this technique, the whole abdominal inferior vena cava is able to be mobilized. This facilitates milking of the tumor down below the major hepatic veins by the surgeon&#x27;s fingers, bypassing the need for a thoracoabdominal incision or cardiopulmonary bypass. In cases of known metastases, surgical resection of the kidney (&quot;cytoreductive nephrectomy&quot;) may improve survival, as well as resection of a solitary metastatic lesion. Kidneys are sometimes embolized prior to surgery to minimize blood loss.

Surgery is increasingly performed via laparoscopic techniques. Commonly referred to as key hole surgery, this surgery does not have the large incisions seen in a classically performed radical or partial nephrectomy, but still successfully removes either all or part of the kidney. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with shorter stays in the hospital and quicker recovery time but there are still risks associated with the surgical procedure. These have the advantage of being less of a burden for the patient and the disease-free survival is comparable to that of open surgery. For small exophytic lesions that do not extensively involve the major vessels or urinary collecting system, a partial nephrectomy (also referred to as &quot;nephron sparing surgery&quot;) can be performed. This may involve temporarily stopping blood flow to the kidney while the mass is removed as well as renal cooling with an ice slush. Mannitol can also be administered to help limit damage to the kidney. This is usually done through an open incision although smaller lesions can be done laparoscopically with or without robotic assistance.

Laparoscopic cryotherapy can also be done on smaller lesions. Typically a biopsy is taken at the time of treatment. Intraoperative ultrasound may be used to help guide placement of the freezing probes. Two freeze/thaw cycles are then performed to kill the tumor cells. As the tumor is not removed followup is more complicated (see below) and overall disease-free rates are not as good as those obtained with surgical removal.

Surgery for metastatic disease: If metastatic disease is present surgical treatment may still a viable option. Radical and partial nephrectomy can still occur, and in some cases, if the metastasis is small this can also be surgically removed. This depends on what stage of growth and how far the disease has spread.

=== Percutaneous ablative therapies ===
Percutaneous ablation therapies use image-guidance by radiologists to treat localized tumors if a surgical procedure is not a good option. Although the use of laparoscopic surgical techniques for complete nephrectomies has reduced some of the risks associated with surgery, surgery of any sort in some cases will still not be feasible. For example, the elderly, people who already have severe renal dysfunction, or people who have several comorbidities, surgery of any sort is not warranted.

A probe is placed through the skin and into the tumor using real-time imaging of both the probe tip and the tumor by computed tomography, ultrasound, or even magnetic resonance imaging guidance, and then destroying the tumor with heat (radiofrequency ablation) or cold (cryotherapy). These modalities are at a disadvantage compared to traditional surgery in that pathologic confirmation of complete tumor destruction is not possible. Therefore, long-term follow-up is crucial to assess completeness of tumour ablation. Ideally, percutaneous ablation is restricted to tumours smaller than 3.5 cm and to guide the treatment. However, there are some cases where ablation can be used on tumors that are larger.

The two main types of ablation techniques that are used for renal cell carcinoma are radio frequency ablation and cryoablation.

Radio frequency ablation uses an electrode which is inserted into the affected tissue, to send radio frequencies to the tissue to generate heat through the friction of water molecules. The heat destroys the tumor tissue. Cell death will generally occur within minutes of being exposed to temperatures above 50 °C.

Cryoablation also involves the insertion of a probe into the affected area, however, cold is used to kill the tumor instead of heat. The probe is cooled with chemical fluids which are very cold. The freezing temperatures cause the tumor cells to die by causing osmotic dehydration, which pulls the water out of the cell destroying the enzyme, organelles, cell membrane and freezing the cytoplasm.

=== Targeted drugs ===
Cancers often grow in an unbridled fashion because they are able to evade the immune system. Immunotherapy is a method that activates the person&#x27;s immune system and uses it to their own advantage. It was developed after observing that in some cases there was spontaneous regression. Immunotherapy capitalises on this phenomenon and aims to build up a person&#x27;s immune response to cancer cells. Other targeted therapy medications inhibit growth factors that have been shown to promote the growth and spread of tumours. Most of these medications were approved within the past ten years. These treatments are:

* Nivolumab
* Axitinib
* Sunitinib
* Cabozantinib
* Everolimus
* Lenvatinib
* Pazopanib
* Bevacizumab
* Sorafenib
* Tivozanib
* Temsirolimus
* Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has produced &quot;durable remissions&quot; in a small number of patients, but with substantial toxicity.
* Interferon-α
For patients with metastatic cancer, sunitinib probably results in more progression of the cancer than pembrolizumab, axitinib and avelumab. In comparison to pembrolizumab and axitinib, it probably results in more death, but it may slightly reduce serious unwanted effects. When compared with combinations of immunotherapy (nivolumab and ipilimumab), sunitinib may lead to more progression and serious effects. There may be little to no difference in progression, survival and serious effects between pazopanib and sunitib.

Activity has also been reported for ipilimumab but it is not an approved medication for renal cancer.

More medications are expected to become available in the near future as several clinical trials are currently being conducted for new targeted treatments, including: atezolizumab, varlilumab, durvalumab, avelumab, LAG525, MBG453, TRC105, and savolitinib.

=== Chemotherapy ===
Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are not as successful in the case of RCC. RCC is resistant in most cases but there is about a 4–5% success rate, but this is often short-lived with more tumours and growths developing later.

=== Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy ===
Adjuvant therapy, which refers to therapy given after a primary surgery, had for a long time not been found to be beneficial in renal cell cancer. However in 2021 Pembrolizumab was approved for adjuvant treatment after showing promising disease-free survival improvements.

Conversely, neoadjuvant therapy is administered before the intended primary or main treatment. In some cases neoadjuvant therapy has been shown to decrease the size and stage of the RCC to then allow it to be surgically removed. This is a new form of treatment and the effectiveness of this approach is still being assessed in clinical trials.

== Metastasis ==
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is the spread of the primary renal cell carcinoma from the kidney to other organs. Approximately 25–30% of people have this metastatic spread by the time they are diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma. This high proportion is explained by the fact that clinical signs are generally mild until the disease progresses to a more severe state. The most common sites for metastasis are the lymph nodes, lung, bones, liver and brain. How this spread affects the staging of the disease and hence prognosis is discussed in the &quot;Diagnosis&quot; and &quot;Prognosis&quot; sections.

MRCC has a poor prognosis compared to other cancers, although average survival times have increased in the last few years due to treatment advances. Average survival time in 2008 for the metastatic form of the disease was under a year, and by 2013 this improved to an average of 22 months. Despite this improvement the five-year survival rate for mRCC remains under 10% and 20–25% of patients remain unresponsive to all treatments and in these cases, the disease has a rapid progression.

The available treatments for RCC discussed in the &quot;Treatment&quot; section are also relevant for the metastatic form of the disease. Options include interleukin-2, which is a standard therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma. From 2007 to 2013, seven new treatments have been approved specifically for mRCC (sunitinib, temsirolimus, bevacizumab, sorafenib, everolimus, pazopanib and axitinib). These new treatments are based on the fact that renal cell carcinomas are very vascular tumours – they contain a large number of blood vessels. The drugs aim to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels in the tumours, hence slowing growth and in some cases, reducing the size of the tumours.
Side effects unfortunately are quite common with these treatments and include:
* Gastrointestinal effects – nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia
* Respiratory effects – coughing, dyspnea (difficulty breathing)
* Cardiovascular effects – hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Neurological effects – intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), thrombosis (blood clots) in the brain
* Effects on the skin and mucous membranes – rashes, hand-foot syndrome, stomatitis
* Bone marrow suppression – resulting in reduced white blood cells, increasing the risk of infections plus anemia and reduced platelets
* Renal effects – impaired kidney function
* Fatigue

Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are more commonly used in the metastatic form of RCC to target the secondary tumours in the bones, liver, brain and other organs. While not curative, these treatments do provide relief for symptoms associated with the spread of tumours.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis is influenced by several factors, including tumour size, degree of invasion and metastasis, histologic type, and nuclear grade. Staging is the most important factor in the outcome of renal cell cancer. The following numbers are based on patients first diagnosed in 2001 and 2002 by the National Cancer Data Base:
A Korean study estimated a disease-specific overall five-year survival rate of 85%. Taken as a whole, if the disease is limited to the kidney, only 20–30% develop metastatic disease after nephrectomy. More specific subsets show a five-year survival rate of around 90–95% for tumors less than 4 cm. For larger tumors confined to the kidney without venous invasion, survival is still relatively good at 80–85%. For tumors that extend through the renal capsule and out of the local fascial investments, the survivability reduces to near 60%. Factors as general health and fitness or the severity of their symptoms impact the survival rates. For instance, younger people (among 20–40 years old) have a better outcome despite having more symptoms at presentation, possibly due to lower rates spread of cancer to the lymph nodes (stage III).

Histological grade is related to the aggressiveness of the cancer, and it is classified in 4 grades, with 1 having the best prognosis (five-year survival over 89%), and 4 with the worst prognosis (46% of five-year survival).

Some people have the renal cell cancer detected before they have symptoms (incidentally) because of the CT scan (Computed Tomography Imaging) or ultrasound. Incidentally diagnosed renal cell cancer (no symptoms) differs in outlook from those diagnosed after presenting symptoms of renal cell carcinoma or metastasis. The five-year survival rate was higher for incidental than for symptomatic tumours: 85.3% versus 62.5%. Incidental lesions were significantly lower stage than those that cause symptoms, since 62.1% patients with incidental renal cell carcinoma were observed with Stage I lesions, against 23% were found with symptomatic renal cell carcinoma.

If it has metastasized to the lymph nodes, the five-year survival is around 5% to 15%. For metastatic renal cell carcinoma, factors which may present a poor prognosis include a low Karnofsky performance-status score (a standard way of measuring functional impairment in patients with cancer), a low haemoglobin level, a high level of serum lactate dehydrogenase, and a high corrected level of serum calcium. For non-metastatic cases, the Leibovich scoring algorithm may be used to predict post-operative disease progression.

Renal cell carcinoma is one of the cancers most strongly associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, most often due to ectopic hormone production by the tumour. The treatment for these complications of RCC is generally limited beyond treating the underlying cancer.

== Epidemiology ==
The incidence of the disease varies according to geographic, demographic and, to a lesser extent, hereditary factors. There are some known risk factors, however the significance of other potential risk factors remains more controversial. The incidence of the cancer has been increasing in frequency worldwide at a rate of approximately 2–3% per decade until the last few years where the number of new cases has stabilised.

The incidence of RCC varies between sexes, ages, races and geographic location around the world. Men have a higher incidence than women (approximately 1.6:1) and the vast majority are diagnosed after 65 years of age. Asians reportedly have a significantly lower incidence of RCC than whites and while African countries have the lowest reported incidences, African Americans have the highest incidence of the population in the United States. Developed countries have a higher incidence than developing countries, with the highest rates found in North America, Europe and Australia / New Zealand.

== History ==
Daniel Sennert made the first reference suggesting a tumour arising in the kidney in his text &quot;Practicae Medicinae&quot;, first published in 1613.

Miril published the earliest unequivocal case of renal carcinoma in 1810. He described the case of Françoise Levelly, a 35-year-old woman, who presented to Brest Civic Hospital on April 6, 1809, supposedly in the late stages of pregnancy.

Koenig published the first classification of renal tumours based on macroscopic morphology in 1826. Koenig divided the tumors into scirrhous, steatomatous, fungoid and medullary forms.

=== Hypernephroma controversy ===

Following the classification of the tumour, researchers attempted to identify the tissue of origin for renal carcinoma.

The pathogenesis of renal epithelial tumours was debated for decades. The debate was initiated by Paul Grawitz when in 1883, he published his observations on the morphology of small, yellow renal tumours. Grawitz concluded that only alveolar tumours were of adrenal origin, whereas papillary tumours were derived from renal tissue.

In 1893, Paul Sudeck challenged the theory postulated by Grawitz by publishing descriptions of renal tumours in which he identified atypical features within renal tubules and noted a gradation of these atypical features between the tubules and neighboring malignant tumour. In 1894, Otto Lubarsch, who supported the theory postulated by Grawitz coined the term &quot;hypernephroid tumor&quot;, which was amended to &quot;hypernephroma&quot; by Felix Victor Birch-Hirschfeld to describe these tumours.

Vigorous criticism of Grawitz was provided by Oskar Stoerk in 1908, who considered the adrenal origin of renal tumours to be unproved. Despite the compelling arguments against the theory postulated by Grawitz, the term hypernephroma, with its associated adrenal connotation, persisted in the literature.

Foot and Humphreys, and Foote et al. introduced the term &quot;Renal Celled Carcinoma&quot; to emphasize a renal tubular origin for these tumours. Their designation was slightly altered by Fetter to the now widely accepted term &quot;Renal Cell Carcinoma&quot;.

Convincing evidence to settle the debate was offered by Oberling et al. in 1959 who studied the ultrastructure of clear cells from eight renal carcinomas. They found that the tumour cell cytoplasm contained numerous mitochondria and deposits of glycogen and fat. They identified cytoplasmic membranes inserted perpendicularly onto the basement membrane with occasional cells containing microvilli along the free borders. They concluded that these features indicated that the tumours arose from the epithelial cells of the renal convoluted tubule, thus finally settling one of the most debated issues in tumour pathology.

<text>Kidney cancer, also known as renal cancer, is a group of cancers that starts in the kidney. Symptoms may include blood in the urine, a lump in the abdomen, or back pain. Fever, weight loss, and tiredness may also occur. Complications can include spread to the lungs or brain.
The main types of kidney cancer are renal cell cancer (RCC), transitional cell cancer (TCC), and Wilms&#x27; tumor. RCC makes up approximately 80% of kidney cancers, and TCC accounts for most of the rest. Risk factors for RCC and TCC include smoking, certain pain medications, previous bladder cancer, being overweight, high blood pressure, certain chemicals, and a family history. Risk factors for Wilms&#x27; tumor include a family history and certain genetic disorders such as WAGR syndrome. Diagnosis may be suspected based on symptoms, urine testing, and medical imaging. It is confirmed by tissue biopsy.
Treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. Kidney cancer newly affected about 403,300 people and resulted in 175,000 deaths globally in 2018. Onset is usually after the age of 45. Males are affected more often than females. The overall five-year survival rate is 75% in the United States, 71% in Canada, 70% in China, and 60% in Europe. For cancers that are confined to the kidney, the five-year survival rate is 93%, if it has spread to the surrounding lymph nodes it is 70%, and if it has spread widely, it is 12%. Kidney cancer has been identified as the 13th most common form of cancer, and is responsible for 2% of the world&#x27;s cancer cases and deaths. The incidence of kidney cancer has continued to increase since 1930. Renal cancer is more commonly found in populations of urban areas than rural areas.

==Signs and symptoms==
Early on, kidney masses do not typically cause any symptoms and are undetectable on physical examination. As kidney cancer becomes more advanced it classically results in blood in the urine, flank or back pain, and a mass. Other symptoms that are consistent with advanced disease include weight loss, fever, night sweats, palpable swollen lymph nodes in the neck, non-reducing varicocele, bone pain, continuous cough, and bilateral lower leg swelling.

The classic triad of visible blood in the urine (hematuria), flank pain and palpable abdominal mass occurs in less than 15% of the cases. RCC may present with signs and symptoms caused by the substances the cancer cell produce (i.e. paraneoplastic syndromes).

Paraneoplastic syndromes caused by kidney cancer can be broadly classified as endocrine and non-endocrine. Endocrine dysfunctions include increase in blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia), high blood pressure (hypertension), increased red bloods (polycythemia), liver dysfunction, milky nipple discharge unrelated normal breast-feeding (galactorrhea), and Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. Non-endocrine dysfunctions include deposition of protein in tissue (amyloidosis), decrease in hemoglobin or red blood cells (anemia), disorders of nerves, muscles (neuromyopathies), blood vessels (vasculopathy) and blood clotting mechanisms (coagulopathy).

==Causes==
Factors that increase the risk of kidney cancer include smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, faulty genes, a family history of kidney cancer in the first relatives, having kidney disease that needs dialysis, being infected with hepatitis C, and previous treatment for testicular cancer or cervical cancer.

There are also other possible risk factors such as kidney stones being investigated.

About 25–30% of kidney cancer is attributed to smoking. Smokers have a 1.3 times higher risk of developing kidney cancer compared to non-smokers. Moreover, there is a dose-dependent increased risk of cancer development. Men who smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day have twice the risk. Likewise, women who smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day have 1.5 times the risk of non-smokers. After 10 years of smoking cessation, a substantial reduction is seen in the risk of developing kidney cancer.

==Diagnosis==
Due to the increase in ultrasound and CT imaging for nonspecific abdominal complaints, kidney masses are frequently incidentally diagnosed on medical imaging. More than 60% of renal cell carcinoma (the most common type of kidney cancer), are diagnosed incidentally by abdominal imaging for nonspecific abdominal complaints.

Kidney masses can be classified by the nature of the cells in the growth, or by its appearance on radiography. The term cancer refers to a malignant tumor, which is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. However, kidney masses can be due to growth of normal tissue (benign), inflammatory (a reaction of the immune system), or vascular (cells of the blood vessels).

=== Medical imaging ===
Since there is a large differential diagnosis for a kidney tumor, the first step is to characterize the mass with medical imaging to assess its likelihood of being benign or malignant. Ultrasonography is sometimes used to evaluate a suspected kidney mass, as it can characterize cystic and solid kidney masses without radiation exposure and at relative low cost. Radiologically tumors are grouped based on appearance into simple cystic, complex cystic, or solid. The most important differentiating feature of a cancerous and non-cancerous tumor on imaging is enhancement. Simple cysts, which are defined by strict criteria are safe to be monitored if the person does not have any symptoms. However, all masses that are not clearly simple cysts should be further evaluated and confirmed by alternate imaging techniques.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen administered with and without IV contrast is the ideal imaging to diagnose and stage kidney cancer. There is tentative evidence that iodinated contrast agents may cause worsening of kidney function in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 45ml/min/1.73m2 and should therefore be given cautiously in this group.

Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an alternative imaging method that can be used to characterize and stage a kidney mass. It may be suggested if contrast material cannot be given. MRI can also evaluate the inferior vena cava if the mass is suspected to extend outside the kidney.

Since the lungs are the most common organ for kidney cancer to spread to, a chest X-ray or CT scan may be ordered based on the person&#x27;s risk for metastatic disease.

=== Histopathologic classification ===
The most common type of kidney malignancy is renal cell carcinoma, which is thought to originate from cells in the proximal convoluted tubule of the nephron. Another type of kidney cancer although less common, is transitional cell cancer (TCC) or urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis. The renal pelvis is the part of the kidney that collects urine and drains it into a tube called the ureter. The cells that line the renal pelvis are called transitional cells, and are also sometimes called urothelial cells. The transitional/urothelial cells in the renal pelvis are the same type of cells that line the ureter and bladder. For this reason TCC of the renal pelvis is distinct from RCC and is thought to behave more like bladder cancer. Other rare types of kidney cancers that can arise from the urothelial cells of the renal pelvis are squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.

Other causes of kidney cancer include the following:
* Sarcoma- for example leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, angiosarcoma, clear-cell sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma are types of sarcomas that have occurred in the kidney
* Metastatic tumor from distant organ
* Lymphoma
* Wilms tumor- an embryonic tumor that is the most common type of kidney cancer in children
* Carcinoid tumor of the renal pelvis
* Carcinosarcoma
* Inverted urothelial papilloma- was traditionally regarded as a benign growth. However, there may be an increased risk for recurrence and transformation to TCC.

In children, Wilms tumor is the most common type of kidney cancer. Mesoblastic nephroma, although rare, also typically presents in childhood.

Renal cell carcinoma has been further divided into sub-types based on histological features and genetic abnormalities. The 2004 WHO Classification of the Renal Tumors of the Adults describes these categories:
* Clear cell RCC
* Multilocular clear cell RCC
* Papillary RCC
* Chromophobe RCC
* Carcinoma of the collecting ducts of Bellini
* Renal medullary carcinoma
* Xp11 translocation carcinomas
* Carcinoma associated with neuroblastoma
* Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma
* Mixed epithelial stromal tumor

Tumors that are considered benign include angiomyolipoma, oncocytoma, reninoma (juxtaglomerular cell tumor), and renal adenoma.

===Immunohistochemistry===
=== Laboratory studies ===
People with suspected kidney cancer should also have their kidney function evaluated to help determine treatment options. Blood tests to determine kidney function include a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), a complete blood count (CBC). In addition, these tests help understand the overall health of the person, which can be affected by metastatic disease (disease that is outside of the kidney). For example, liver or bone involvement could result in abnormal liver enzymes, electrolyte abnormalities, or anemia. A urine sample should also be collected for urinalysis.

=== Biopsy ===
The utility of renal mass biopsy (RMB) lies in that it can confirm malignancy with reliability, can direct therapy based on diagnosis, and can provide drainage.

Once imaging has been completed, renal mass biopsy should be considered if there is a high likelihood that the mass is hematologic, metastatic, inflammatory, or infectious. These types of lesions would not be managed surgically, differing from cancer originating from the kidney. Cancer originating outside the kidney and lymphoma are managed systemically.

RMB can accurately diagnose malignancy, however, it cannot reliably diagnose benign disease. In other words, if the biopsy shows cancer, there is a 99.8% chance that kidney cancer is present (Positive Predictive Value= 99.8%). A negative biopsy does not rule out a diagnosis of cancer.

===Staging===
Staging is the process that helps determine the extent and spread of the disease. Renal cell carcinoma is the only type of kidney cancer that can be staged. The first step of staging follows the TNM staging system proposed by the Union International Contre le Cancer that is widely used among cancers in other organs. The TNM staging system classifies the primary tumor (T), lymph nodes (N) and distant metastasis (M) of the disease. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) published a Cancer Staging Manual revision in 2010 that describes the values of TMN for renal cell carcinoma.

Lymph node involvement is classified as either regional lymph node metastasis (N1), or no involvement (N0). Similarly, M1 describes distant metastasis, while M0 describes no distant metastasis.

The primary tumor of renal cell carcinoma is categorized in the table below, as according to the AJCC 8th Edition Cancer Staging Manual:
The lungs are the most common site for metastasis, with other common sites including bone, brain, liver, adrenal gland and distant lymph nodes.
==Treatment==
Treatment for kidney cancer depends on the type and stage of the disease. Surgery is the most common treatment as kidney cancer does not often respond to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgical complexity can be estimated by the RENAL Nephrometry Scoring System. If the cancer has not spread it will usually be removed by surgery. In some cases this involves removing the whole kidney however most tumors are amenable to partial removal to eradicate the tumor and preserve the remaining normal portion of the kidney. Surgery is not always possible – for example, the patient may have other medical conditions that prevent it, or the cancer may have spread around the body and doctors may not be able to remove it. If the cancer cannot be treated with surgery, other techniques such as freezing the tumour or treating it with high temperatures may be used. However, these are not yet used as standard treatments for kidney cancer. Recently, evidence stemming from the KEYNOTE-564 study has shed light on the potential use of systemic therapy in the adjuvant setting, with promising results. Patients exhibiting specific clear cell RCC tumor characteristics and having undergone treatment with Pembrolizumab for 17 cycles (around 1 year) had significant improvement in disease-free survival. However, the study has yet to yield conclusive findings in relation to overall survival. 

Other treatment options include biological therapies such as everolimus, torisel, nexavar, sutent, and axitinib, the use of immunotherapy including interferon and interleukin-2. Immunotherapy is successful in 10 to 15% of people. Sunitinib is the current standard of care in the adjuvant setting along with pazopanib; these treatments are often followed by everolimus, axitinib, and sorafenib. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are also in trials for kidney cancer, and some have gained approval for medical use.

In the second line setting, nivolumab demonstrated an overall survival advantage in advanced clear renal cell carcinoma over everolimus in 2015 and was approved by the FDA. Cabozantinib also demonstrated an overall survival benefit over everolimus and was approved by the FDA as a second-line treatment in 2016. Lenvatinib in combination with everolimus was approved in 2016 for patients who have had exactly one prior line of angiogenic therapy.

In Wilms&#x27; tumor, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are the accepted treatments, depending on the stage of the disease when it is diagnosed.

===Children===
The majority of kidney cancers reported in children are Wilms&#x27; tumors. These tumors can begin to grow when a fetus is still developing in the uterus, and may not cause problems until the child is a few years old. Wilms&#x27; tumor is most common in children under the age of 5, but can rarely be diagnosed in older children or in adults. It is still not clear what causes most Wilms&#x27; tumors. The most common symptoms are swelling of the abdomen and blood in the urine.

==Epidemiology==
Around 208,500 new cases of kidney cancer are diagnosed in the world each year, accounting for just under 2% of all cancers. The highest rates are recorded in North America and the lowest rates in Asia and Africa.

Lifestyle risk factors

Certain lifestyle factors have been associated with the development of renal cancer, although not all of them can be considered definitive causes. These include smoking, chemical carcinogens, radiation, viruses, diet and obesity, hypertension, diuretics, and alcohol consumption. Only a small percentage of kidney cancer cases have been linked to genetic factors. With obesity listed as one of the risk factors, daily physical activity and engaging in a healthy diet is proven to lower the rates of developing kidney cancer in the future.

Age

The incidence rate of renal cancer increases with the age of an individual, with 75 being the approximate age of the peak incidence rate, as of 2018. However, nearly one half of all cases are diagnosed before the age of 65. In both male and female children, renal tumors represent 2% to 6% of kidney cancer, with Wilms&#x27; tumor being the most common.

Sex

The incidence of kidney cancer is two times greater in men than in women, and this is thought to be due to biological differences. Mortality rates typically decrease more rapidly in women compared to men.

International variations

Incidence rates of kidney cancer can vary throughout the world. As of 2018, Czech Republic and Lithuania have the highest incidence rate of kidney cancer worldwide, with an age-standardized rate of 21.9/100,000 in males (Czech Republic) and 18.7/100,000 in males (Lithuania.) China, Thailand, and African countries (low-risk countries) have an incidence rate that is less than 2/100,000.

Since the early 2000s, Austria and Poland have been the only countries to report a decrease in kidney cancer rates.

Diagnosis access bias plays a large role in the epidemiology of kidney cancer. Differences in kidney cancer diagnosis across regions are likely due to differences in healthcare access, rather than a population&#x27;s biological factors. Discrepancies in kidney cancer diagnosis has most likely led to the underrepresentation of mortality and incidence in low income countries.   

Race

Race and ethnicity may be a factor in the distribution of kidney cancer around the United States. There are higher incidence rates in Black men and Hispanics, an average rate for American Indians, and low rates in Asians in the United States. Black people with kidney cancer have lower mortality rates than Caucasians in the United States.

Screening

Accessibility for cancer screening is not very common due to high expenses. Improving cancer registries can improve care to those who have kidney cancer as well as decreasing the incidence and death rates. Safe and dependable treatment is key with the screening and treatment, which is not always the case in many developing nations.

===United States===
The United States&#x27; NIH estimates for 2013 around 64,770 new cases of kidney cancer and 13,570 deaths from the disease.

The incidence of kidney cancer is also increasing in the United States. This is thought to be a real increase, not only due to changes in the way the disease is diagnosed.

===Europe===
The most recent estimates of incidence of kidney cancer suggest that there are 63,300 new cases annually in the EU25. In Europe, kidney cancer accounts for nearly 3% of all cancer cases. Kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in the UK (around 10,100 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011), and it is the fourteenth most common cause of cancer death (around 4,300 people died in 2012).

<text>Something&#x27;s Gotta Give is a 2003 American romantic comedy drama film written, produced, and directed by Nancy Meyers. It stars Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton as professionals who find love for each other in later life, despite being complete opposites. Keanu Reeves and Amanda Peet co-star, with Frances McDormand, Paul Michael Glaser, Jon Favreau, and KaDee Strickland playing key supporting roles.

&quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; received positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards Keaton and Nicholson&#x27;s performances. The film emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office, grossing $266 million worldwide against a production budget of $80 million.

For her performance, Keaton received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress, the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. At the 61st Golden Globe Awards, Keaton won Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, while Nicholson received a nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

== Plot ==
Harry Sanborn is a wealthy NYC record company owner who only dates women under 30, including his latest girlfriend, Marin Klein. The two drive to her mother&#x27;s Hamptons beach house, expecting to be alone. However her mother, the playwright Erica Barry, and Erica&#x27;s sister Zoe unexpectedly arrive.

After an awkward dinner, the night turns disastrous when—during foreplay with Marin—Harry has a heart attack and is rushed to a hospital. The attending doctor, Julian Mercer, tells him to stay nearby for a few days, so he reluctantly stays with Erica.

Their personalities clash and create awkward living arrangements at first, but they soon find charming qualities in each other and begin to form a connection. Harry&#x27;s relationship with her daughter and Erica&#x27;s budding relationship with Julian become obstacles to their growing attraction.

Marin tells her mother that she will break up with Harry, but he ends things first. He and Erica spend more time together and eventually have sex. Julian tells Harry he has improved enough to return to the city. He and Erica share an awkward goodbye, as despite their strong feelings, Harry is clearly hesitant to enter into a relationship.

Marin receives news that her father, and Erica&#x27;s ex-husband, Dave Klein is getting remarried, to a doctor who is only two years older than she. Though Erica is unaffected by the news, Marin is devastated and pressures her mother into accompanying her to a dinner.

At dinner, Erica sees Harry at another table with a much younger woman. An argument follows and Erica confesses that she is in love with him, but he does not seem to reciprocate, so she ends things between them and leaves. Harry suffers from what he believes is another heart attack, but in the emergency room he is told it was a panic attack.

Devastated, Erica returns home where she cries almost nonstop for several weeks. She pours her heartbreak into a new play about a woman who falls in love with her daughter&#x27;s boyfriend, titling it &quot;A Woman to Love,&quot; a phrase Harry had used to describe Erica. Harry hears about the play and rushes to the theater, where it is being rehearsed.

Despite her denials, it is obvious that Erica has used the most personal details of their affair in the play. When Harry tells her he still cares about her, she rebuffs him. After learning his character dies in the play, he suffers another panic attack. At the hospital, he is told he needs to de-stress, and he relocates temporarily to the Bahamas.

Six months later, Erica&#x27;s play is a huge success. Harry pays Marin a visit to apologize for any past disrespect, and discovers that she is now happily married and pregnant. She informs him that Erica is in Paris celebrating her birthday. Harry flies there and surprises Erica at her favorite restaurant. He tells her he has been reaching out to all the young women he had affairs with in an attempt to atone for his heartless behavior. Julian, whom Erica is now dating, appears.

Harry, Erica and Julian have dinner together, and part amicably outside the restaurant. While Harry gazes in heartache over the river Seine, Erica arrives. She tells him that Julian realized she still loves Harry and decided to step aside to let them be together. He tells her that at age 63, he is in love for the first time in his life, and they embrace.

A year later at a restaurant, the now married Erica and Harry are out with Marin, her husband Danny and their new baby daughter, celebrating life as a loving family.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; holds an approval rating of 72% based on 171 reviews, with an average rating of 6.60/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Though it occasionally stumbles into sitcom territory, &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; is mostly a smart, funny romantic comedy, with sharp performances from Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton and Keanu Reeves.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A to F.

Mick LaSalle, writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, felt the performances of the film&#x27;s stars, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, were among their best, and that Nicholson&#x27;s acting, as his role covered a wider range of emotions, was the more complex. The reviewer praised the film for being a romantic comedy for adults:
Roger Ebert describes the film&#x27;s dialogue as &quot;smart&quot;. Although noting that Keanu Reeves&#x27;s role &quot;seems like nothing more than a walking plot complication&quot;, he praises the performances of Keaton and Nicholson: &quot;A movie like this depends crucially on its stars. To complain that Nicholson is playing &quot;himself&quot; – or that Keaton is also playing a character very much like her public persona – is missing the point. Part of the appeal depends on the movie&#x27;s teasing confusion of reality and fiction.&quot;

<text>In the United States and Canada, the Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) is a corps of trained amateur radio operator volunteers organized to assist in public service and emergency communications. It is organized and sponsored by the American Radio Relay League and the Radio Amateurs of Canada.

Communication failures have been a defining part of natural disasters and even some human-generated events. Amateur radio provides a means of communication &quot;when all else fails&quot;.

== Historical operations ==

Amateur radio operators belonging to ARES (and its predecessor, the Amateur Radio Emergency Corps) have responded to local and regional disasters since the 1930s, including the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the category 5 storms Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Michael. During the Katrina event, more than one thousand ARES volunteers assisted in the aftermath and provided communications for the American Red Cross, The Salvation Army, and other individuals related to the relief effort. After Katrina Hancock County, Mississippi, had lost all contact with the outside world, except through ARES operators who served as 911 dispatchers and message relayers.

ARES has deployed for a variety of other emergencies and disasters, including the 2003 North America blackout. The blackout covered a wide geographical area of North America. In the United States its scope included Cleveland, Detroit, and New York City. Landline telephones and cell phone systems were overloaded and amateur ability to operate off the grid was put to the test. On Long Island in New York many pieces of health and welfare traffic were passed on VHF and HF nets. Because some television and radio stations had gone off the air amateurs helped fill the lack of information. This was not the first time that amateur radio operators assisted during a blackout in New York City. On a warm evening of July 13, 1977, lightning caused a power outage across the city and most of its suburbs. Radio operators started communication nets on simplex and on a repeater located in the Chrysler Building.

== Organizational structure ==

ARES groups are volunteer amateur radio operators who come together for the common purpose of providing emergency and/or auxiliary communications service to public safety and public service organizations. Most individual ARES units are autonomous and operate locally. Although the Amateur Radio Emergency Service is a program (and trademark) of the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) in the U.S., the structure is more supportive than directive in nature, providing mostly for mutual aid in the event of large-scale emergencies. As long as local units are operating in the best interests of Amateur Radio in general and the ARRL in particular, intervention from the national organization is minimal. The government expresses little governance of ARES (other than the FCC regulations - 47 CFR Part 97 - which regulate all of Amateur Radio) and local authorities only passively regulate ARES groups by way of formal understandings.

ARES groups are generally organized by city or county and are made up of volunteers from the local area. The only requirements to join ARES are a willingness to serve and a valid amateur radio license.

Groups are organized locally by the person holding the position of &quot;Emergency Coordinator&quot; (EC). The EC maintains full responsibility for organizing the local groups and serving as their leader during operations. The EC is an ARRL or RAC member, and is generally the point of contact for those wishing to perform Emergency Communications in their local area. They may appoint one or several AECs (Assistant Emergency Coordinator) to oversee certain geographical areas, or they may appoint by function such as the SKYWARN severe weather spotting network, Net Managing, Training Direction, or Public Information, or maybe a mix of the above (i.e. whatever works locally). Some members may be appointed as Official Emergency Stations and are trained to serve specific duties such as being a net controller during emergencies.

The next higher level of coordination is the optional District Emergency Coordinator (DEC). This person coordinates the operation of several local county or city ARES groups and reports to the Section Emergency Coordinator in those sections where the span of control would otherwise be too large. A DEC may have one or more Assistant District Emergency Coordinators serving them.

Leading the structure is the Section Emergency Coordinator, or SEC. This person is appointed by the elected Section Manager and is responsible for emergency communications in their section. An SEC may have one or more Assistant SECs serving to assist them. In the U.S., a Section is one of 71 geographic administrative areas of the ARRL. It is either a state or in more densely populated areas of the U.S., a portion of a state.

In Canada, the ARES is coordinated overall by the Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC) Field Services Organization which has eight (8) Sections: Alberta, British Columbia/Yukon, Manitoba, Maritimes (consisting of Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick), Newfoundland/Labrador, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. As is the case in the U.S., each Section is managed by an elected Section Manager.

In Canada, the ARES logo is a registered trademark of the Radio Amateurs of Canada Inc.(RAC).

== Mutual assistance ==

ARES in the U.S. has Memorandums of Understanding with organizations including the American Red Cross, National Weather Service, Department of Homeland Security, Citizen Corps, Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International, National Communications System, National Association of Radio and Telecommunications Engineers Inc., Salvation Army, Society of Broadcast Engineers, Quarter Century Wireless Association Inc. and REACT International Inc.

Often these memorandums illustrate a common and united sense of purpose between ARES and another organization. However, Memorandums of Understanding with the American Red Cross, the National Weather Service, the Salvation Army and others lay out the general guidelines for organization and coordination between agencies in times of emergency.

ARES of the Radio Amateurs of Canada have MOUs with the Canadian Red Cross Society and PERCS, the British Columbia Provincial Emergency Radio Communication Service.

== Alternative groups ==
Frequently, members of local ARES groups in the U.S. are registered with local government Emergency Management agencies to permit operations under the RACES rules, if ever needed. This allows continuation of operation during times of declared emergency when normal amateur operations might be prohibited. Today, ARES has operators and officials at local, county, and state levels, and most potential RACES operations are generally integrated within ARES organizations.

A few U.S. Amateur Radio emergency communications groups have decided, for one reason or another, not to affiliate with the ARRL. Some such groups in Canada have elected not to offer their services under the Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC) banner. However, their essential purpose remains the same and, in times of need, they often work side-by-side with ARES groups. Radio clubs independent of the ARRL or the RAC and ARES also participate in emergency communications activities in some areas.

Many ARES operators are also part of storm spotter networks, e.g., SKYWARN (a program organized by the U.S. National Weather Service) and CANWARN (coordinated by Environment Canada).

In many cases, the ARES Emergency Coordinator for a county coordinates all local Amateur Radio emergency and disaster communications activity.

<text>The amateur auxiliary was an American amateur radio organization operated by the American Radio Relay League between 1994 and 2019 that was authorized by and worked in conjunction with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Auxiliary consisted of official observer volunteer amateur radio operators who monitored amateur radio service frequencies. This was one way in which the FCC encouraged amateur radio operators in the United States to self-police.

== Official observer ==
If the official observers (OO) hear something that, in their judgment, is in violation of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations, they will send a postcard to the amateur radio station describing the infraction. The receipt of an official observer card is merely advice from another amateur radio operator and has no legal authority to it. Official observers are trained to deal only with clear and unambiguous violations of FCC rules and not become interpreters in areas that are controversial.

To become an official observer, the amateur must first be appointed to the position by their section manager. ARRL field services will send the amateur a manual which describes the amateur auxiliary, how the official observer is supposed to conduct business, and several technical details concerning FCC rules and regulations. The potential official observer also receives a self-paced test that they must pass to receive the appointment. Once the test is forwarded back to ARRL field services (and passes), the amateur receives their official observer appointment. The OO performs his/her function by listening for such things as frequency instability, harmonics, hum, key clicks, broad signals, distorted audio, over deviation, out-of-band operation, etc.

In hard-core rules violations cases, OOs refer problems to higher echelons of the amateur auxiliary and may be requested to gather evidence for possible FCC enforcement actions.

== Official observer coordinator ==
The official observer coordinator (OOC) is an ARRL section-level leadership official, appointed by the section manager (SM), for two related purposes: to supervise the maintenance monitoring work of the section official observers, and to coordinate special amateur auxiliary efforts with headquarters and the SM.

With the inception of the amateur auxiliary to the FCC, the role of the OOC is greater today than ever before. A key liaison in the auxiliary, the OOC assists OOs in evidence gathering and conveys evidentiary materials to headquarters for handling with the FCC.

== Local interference committees ==
Local interference committees are formed to &quot;track down and resolve repeater jamming problems.&quot;

== Current FCC actions ==
Current FCC enforcement actions, including those base on reports from the amateur auxiliary are available.

<text>Oral cancer, also known as oral cavity cancer, tongue cancer or mouth cancer, is a cancer of the lining of the lips, mouth, or upper throat. In the mouth, it most commonly starts as a painless red or white patch, that thickens, gets ulcerated and continues to grow. When on the lips, it commonly looks like a persistent crusting ulcer that does not heal, and slowly grows. Other symptoms may include difficult or painful swallowing, new lumps or bumps in the neck, a swelling in the mouth, or a feeling of numbness in the mouth or lips.
Risk factors include tobacco and alcohol use. Those who use both alcohol and tobacco have a 15 times greater risk of oral cancer than those who use neither. Other risk factors include betel nut chewing and sun exposure on the lip. HPV infection may play a limited role in some oral cavity cancers. Oral cancer is a subgroup of head and neck cancers. Diagnosis is made by sampling (biopsy) of the lesion, followed by an imaging workup (called staging) which can include CT scan, MRI, PET scan to determine the local extension of the tumor, and if the disease has spread to distant parts of the body.
Oral cancer can be prevented by avoiding tobacco products, limiting alcohol use, sun protection on the lip, HPV vaccination, and avoidance of betel nut chewing. Treatments used for oral cancer can include a combination of surgery (to remove the tumor and regional lymph nodes), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy. The types of treatments will depend on the size, locations, and spread of the cancer taken into consideration with the general health of the person.
In 2018, oral cancer occurred globally in about 355,000 people, and resulted in 177,000 deaths. Between 1999 and 2015 in the United States, the rate of oral cancer increased 6% (from 10.9 to 11.6 per 100,000). Deaths from oral cancer during this time decreased 7% (from 2.7 to 2.5 per 100,000). Oral cancer has an overall 5 year survival rate of 65% in the United States as of 2015. This varies from 84% if diagnosed when localized, compared to 66% if it has spread to the lymph nodes in the neck, and 39% if it has spread to distant parts of the body. Survival rates also are dependent on the location of the disease in the mouth.
==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of oral cancer depend on the location of the tumor but are generally thin, irregular, red and/or white patches in the mouth. The classic warning sign is a persistent rough patch with ulceration, and a raised border that is minimally painful. On the lip, the ulcer is more commonly crusting and dry, and in the pharynx it is more commonly a mass. It can also be associated with loose teeth, bleeding gums, persistent ear ache, a feeling of numbness in the lip and chin, or swelling. When the cancer extends to the oropharynx (back of the throat), there can also be difficulty swallowing. 
==Causes==

The main causes of oral cancer are alcohol and tobacco (smoked or chewed). The risk is especially high when a person regularly uses both. The more is consumed of either the higher the risk of developing oral cancer. Like all environmental factors, the rate at which cancer will develop is dependent on the dose, frequency and method of application of the carcinogen (the substance that is causing the cancer). Aside from tobacco and alcohol, other carcinogens for oral cancer include viruses (particularly HPV 16 and 18), radiation, and UV light.

=== Tobacco ===
Tobacco is the greatest single cause of oral and pharyngeal cancer. Using tobacco increases the risk of oral cancer by 3 to 6 times and is responsible for around 40% of all oral cancers. Smokeless tobacco (including chewing tobacco, snuff, snus) also causes oral cancer. Cigar and pipe smoking are also important risk factors.

The use of electronic cigarettes may also lead to the development of head and neck cancers due to the substances like propylene glycol, glycerol, nitrosamines, and metals contained therein, which can cause damage to the airways.

Use of marijuana has currently not been shown to be associated with head and neck cancer risk.

=== Alcohol ===
Drinking alcohol is a major cause of oral cancer. It is responsible for about 20% of global oral cancer cases. The more alcohol is consumed regularly the higher the risk, but light to moderate drinking still somewhat increases the chances of getting oral cancer. The risk is especially high when both alcohol and tobacco are used.

It has been controversial if the use of alcohol-based mouthwashes increases oral cancer risk. As of 2024, there is some limited evidence supporting that the use of mouthwashes containing alcohol can increase the occurrence of oral cancer in some cases. There are complex interactions between alcohol content, usage patterns, reduction of oral pathogens, poor oral hygiene, smoking, and drinking which make any broad conclusion very tenuous in the absence of rigorously controlled studies. In subgroup analyses, various combinations of smoking, drinking alcohol, poor oral hygiene, and using mouthwash several times a day for 35 years or more significantly increased risk. Although alcohol is necessary to dissolve some active antimicrobial agents, Rao et al. advise reducing the alcohol content of mouthwashes if possible.

===Human papillomavirus===
Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly type 16, is a cause of oropharyngeal cancer (tonsils, base of tongue). However, its role in the genesis of oral cavity cancers is a matter of debate. A 2023 meta-analysis observed that the HPV was present 6% of all oral cavity cancer cases, however without establishing a role of this virus in the oncogenesis of these tumors. The authors even reported that some base of tongue tumors may have been misclassified as oral cavity tumors, therefore mistakenly increasing the rate of HPV-positive oral cavity cancers.

===Betel nut===

Chewing betel quid (paan) and Areca nut-based products is known to be a strong risk factor for developing oral cancer even in the absence of tobacco. It doubles the risk of oral cancer 2.1 times and when chewed with additional tobacco in its preparation (like in gutka), there is an even higher risk.

In India where such practices are common, oral cancer represents up to 40% of all cancers, compared to just 4% in the UK.

===Stem cell transplantation===
People after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at a higher risk for oral cancer. Post-HSCT oral cancer may have more aggressive behavior with poorer prognosis, when compared to oral cancer in people not treated with HSCT. This effect is supposed to be owing to the continuous lifelong immune suppression and chronic oral graft-versus-host disease.

This HPV16 (along with HPV18) is the same virus responsible for the vast majority of all cervical cancers and is the most common sexually transmitted infection. Risk factors for developing HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer include multiple sexual partners, anal and oral sex and a weak immune system.

===Premalignant lesions===

A premalignant (or precancerous) lesion is defined as &quot;a benign, morphologically altered tissue that has a greater than normal risk of malignant transformation.&quot; There are several different types of premalignant lesion that occur in the mouth. Some oral cancers begin as white patches (leukoplakia), red patches (erythroplakia) or mixed red and white patches (erythroleukoplakia or &quot;speckled leukoplakia&quot;). Other common premalignant lesions include oral submucous fibrosis and actinic cheilitis. In the Indian subcontinent oral submucous fibrosis is very common due to betel nut chewing. This condition is characterized by limited opening of mouth and burning sensation on eating of spicy food. This is a progressive lesion in which the opening of the mouth becomes progressively limited, and later on even normal eating becomes difficult.

== Pathophysiology ==

Oral squamous cell carcinoma is the end product of an unregulated proliferation of mucous basal cells. A single precursor cell is transformed into a clone consisting of many daughter cells with an accumulation of altered genes called oncogenes. What characterizes a malignant tumor over a benign one is its ability to metastasize. This ability is independent of the size or grade of the tumor (often seemingly slow growing cancers like the adenoid cystic carcinoma can metastasis widely). It is not just rapid growth that characterizes a cancer, but their ability to secrete enzymes, angiogeneic factors, invasion factors, growth factors and many other factors that allow it to spread.

The full causal relation between alcohol consumption and the elevated risk of cancer remains unclear, but acetaldehyde plays a major role. Immediately after alcohol consumption, there are elevated levels of acetaldehyde in saliva, peaking after about 2 minutes. Acetaldehyde is produced by the oral microbiome, and also by enzymes in the oral mucosa, saliva glands, and liver. It is also naturally present in alcoholic beverages. Of these, the microbiome is the major contributor, accounting for at least half of the acetaldehyde present. Poor oral hygiene, smoking, and heavy drinking induce an increase in acetaldehyde-producing bacteria in the mouth. Many species of bacteria contribute to acetaldehyde production and their epidemiological significance is not known. The acetaldehyde reacts with oral epithelial cells, inducing DNA modifications, which can lead to mutations and cancer development. The ability to metabolize acetaldehyde in the mouth is limited, so it may remain in the saliva for hours. L-cysteine tablets may be used to decrease acetaldehyde exposure in the oral cavity.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of oral cancer is completed for (1) initial diagnosis, (2) staging, and (3) treatment planning. A complete history, and clinical examination is first completed, then a wedge of tissue is cut from the suspicious lesion for tissue diagnosis. This might be done with scalpel biopsy, punch biopsy, fine or core needle biopsy. In this procedure, the surgeon cuts all, or a piece of the tissue, to have it examined under a microscope by a pathologist. Brush biopsies are not considered accurate for the diagnosis of oral cancer. Salivary biomarkers are also being under investigation with emerging outcomes and could potentially be used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool in the future.

With the first biopsy, the pathologist will provide a tissue diagnosis (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma), and classify the cell structure. They may add additional information that can be used in staging, and treatment planning, such as the mitotic rate, the depth of invasion, and the HPV status of the tissue.

After the tissue is confirmed cancerous, other tests will be completed to:
* better assess the size of the lesion (CT scan, MRI or PET scan with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)),
* look for other cancers in the upper aerodigestive tract (which may include endoscopy of the nasal cavity/pharynx, larynx, bronchus, and esophagus called panendoscopy or quadoscopy),
* spread to the lymph nodes (CT scan) or
* spread to other parts of the body (chest X-ray, nuclear medicine).

Other, more invasive tests, may also be completed such as fine needle aspiration, biopsy of lymph nodes, and sentinel node biopsy. When the cancer has spread to lymph nodes, their exact location, size, and spread beyond the capsule (of the lymph nodes) needs to be determined, as each can have a significant impact on treatment and prognosis. Small differences in the pattern of lymph node spread, can have a significant impact on treatment and prognosis. Panendoscopy may be recommended, because the tissues of the entire upper aerodigestive tract are generally affected by the same carcinogens, so other primary cancers are a common occurrence.

From these collective findings, taken in consideration with the health and desires of the person, the cancer team develops a plan for treatment. Since most oral cancers require surgical removal, a second set of histopathologic tests will be completed on any tumor removed to determine the prognosis, need for additional surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, or other interventions.

===Classification===
Oral cancer is a subgroup of head and neck cancers which includes those of the oropharynx, larynx, nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, salivary glands, and thyroid gland. Oral melanoma, while part of head and neck cancers is considered separately. Other cancers can occur in the mouth (such as bone cancer, lymphoma, or metastatic cancers from distant sites) but are also considered separately from oral cancers.

===Staging===
Oral cancer staging is an assessment of the degree of spread of the cancer from its original source. It is one of the factors affecting both the prognosis and the potential treatment of oral cancer.

The evaluation of squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth and pharynx staging uses the TNM classification (tumor, node, metastasis). This is based on the size of the primary tumor, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

TMN evaluation allows the person to be classified into a prognostic staging group;
==Screening==
The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2013 stated evidence was insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for oral cancer in adults without symptoms by primary care providers. The American Academy of Family Physicians comes to similar conclusions while the American Cancer Society recommends that adults over 20 years who have periodic health examinations should have the oral cavity examined for cancer. The American Dental Association recommends that providers remain alert for signs of cancer during routine examinations.

There are a variety of screening devices such as toluidine blue, brush biopsy, or fluorescence imaging, however, there is no evidence that routine use of these devices in general dental practice is helpful. Potential risks of using screening devices include false positives, unnecessary surgical biopsies, and a financial burden. Micronuclei assays can help in early detection of pre-malignant and malignant lesions, thereby improving survival and reducing morbidity associated with treatment.

There has also been research showing potential in using oral cytology as a diagnostic test for oral cancer instead of traditional biopsy techniques. In oral cytology, a brush is used to take some cells from the suspected lesion/area and these are sent to a laboratory for examination. This can be much less invasive and painful than a scalpel biopsy for the patient, however, there needs to be further research before oral cytology can be considered as an effective routine screening tool when compared to biopsies.

==Management==
Oral cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) is usually treated with surgery alone, or in combination with adjunctive therapy, including radiation, with or without chemotherapy. With small lesions (T1), surgery or radiation have similar control rates, so the decision about which to use is based on functional outcome, and complication rates.

===Surgery===
In most centres, removal of squamous cell carcinoma from the oral cavity and neck is achieved primarily through surgery. This also allows a detailed examination of the tissue for histopathologic characteristics, such as depth, and spread to lymph nodes that might require radiation or chemotherapy. For small lesions (T1–2), access to the oral cavity is through the mouth. When the lesion is larger, involves the bone of the maxilla or mandible, or access is limited due to mouth opening, the upper or lower lip is split, and the cheek pulled back to give greater access to the mouth. When the tumor involves the jaw bone, or when surgery or radiation will cause severe limited mouth opening, part of the bone is also removed with the tumor.

====Management of the neck====

Spread of cancer from the oral cavity to the lymph nodes of the neck has a significant effect on survival. Between 60 and 70% of people with early stage oral cancer will have no lymph node involvement of the neck clinically, but 20–30% of those people (or up to 20% of all those affected) will have clinically undetectable spread of cancer to the lymph nodes of the neck (called occult disease).

The management of the neck is crucial, since spread to it reduces the chance of survival by 50%. If there is evidence of lymph node involvement of the neck, during the diagnostic phase, then a modified radical neck dissection is generally performed. Where the neck lymph nodes have no evidence of involvement clinically, but the oral cavity lesion is high risk for spread (e.g. T2 or above lesions), then a neck dissection of the lymph nodes above the level of the omohyoid muscle may be completed. T1 lesions that are 4 mm or greater in thickness have a significant risk of spread to neck nodes. When disease if found in the nodes after removal (but not seen clinically) the recurrence rates is 10–24%. If post-operative radiation is added, the failure rate is 0–15%. When lymph nodes are clinically found during the diagnosis phase, and radiation is added post-operative, disease control is &gt;80%.

===Radiotherapy and chemotherapy===

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are most often used, as an adjunct to surgery, to control oral cancer that is greater than stage 1, or has spread to either regional lymph nodes or other parts of the body. Radiotherapy alone can be used instead of surgery, for very small lesions, but is generally used as an adjunct when lesions are large, cannot be completely removed, or have spread to the lymph nodes of the neck. Chemotherapy is useful in oral cancers when used in combination with other treatment modalities such as radiation therapy but it is not used alone as a monotherapy. When a cure is unlikely, it can also be used to extend life and can be considered palliative but not curative care.

Monoclonal antibody therapy (with agents such as cetuximab) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of squamous cell head and neck cancers, and are likely to have an increasing role in the future management of this condition when used in conjunction with other established treatment modalities, although it is not a replacement for chemotherapy in head and neck cancers. Likewise, molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapies may be effective for the treatment of oral and oropharyngeal cancers. Adding epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody (EGFR mAb) to standard treatment may increase survival, keeping the cancer limited to that area of the body and may decrease reappearance of the cancer.

===Rehabilitation===
Following treatment, rehabilitation may be necessary to improve movement, chewing, swallowing, and speech. Speech and language pathologists may be involved at this stage. Treatment of oral cancer will usually be by a multidisciplinary team, with treatment professionals from the realms of radiation, surgery, chemotherapy, nutrition, dentistry, and even psychology all possibly involved with diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and care. Due to the location of oral cancer, there may be a period where the person requires a tracheotomy and feeding tube.

==Prognosis==
Survival rates for oral cancer depend on the precise site and the stage of the cancer at diagnosis. Overall, 2011 data from the SEER database shows that survival is around 57% at five years when all stages of initial diagnosis, all genders, all ethnicities, all age groups, and all treatment modalities are considered. Survival rates for stage 1 cancers are approximately 90%, hence the emphasis on early detection to increase survival outcome for people. Similar survival rates are reported from other countries, such as Germany.

==Epidemiology==

Globally, it newly occurred in about 355,000 people and resulted in 177,000 deaths in 2018. Of these 355,000, about 246,000 are males and 108,000 are females.

In 2013, oral cancer resulted in 135,000 deaths, up from 84,000 deaths in 1990. Oral cancer occurs more often in people from lower and middle income countries.

===Europe===
Europe places second-highest after Southeast Asia among all continents for age-standardised rate (ASR) specific to oral and oropharyngeal cancer. It is estimated that there were 61,400 cases of oral and lip cancer within Europe in 2012. Hungary recorded the highest number of mortality and morbidity due to oral and pharyngeal cancer among all European countries while Cyprus reported the lowest numbers 

====United Kingdom====
British Cancer Research found 2,386 deaths due to oral cancer in 2014; while most oral cancer cases are diagnosed in older adults between 50 and 74 years old, this condition can affect the young as well; 6% of people affected by oral cancer are under 45 years of age. The United Kingdom is 16th-lowest for males and 11th-highest for females for oral cancer incidence among Europe. Additionally, there is a regional variability within the United Kingdom, with Scotland and northern England having higher rates than southern England. The same analysis applies to lifetime risk of developing oral cancer, as in Scotland it is 1.84% in males and 0.74% in females, higher than the rest of the UK, being 1.06% and 0.48%, respectively.

Oral cancer is the sixteenth most-common cancer in the United Kingdom (around 6,800 people were diagnosed with oral cancer in the United Kingdom in 2011), and it is the 19th most-common cause of cancer death (around 2,100 people died from the disease in 2012).

====Northern Europe====
The highest incidence of oral and pharyngeal cancer was recorded in Denmark, with age-standardised rates per 100,000 of 13.0, followed by Lithuania (9.9) and the United Kingdom (9.8). Lithuania reported the highest incidence in men while Denmark reported the highest in women. The highest rates for mortality in 2012 were reported in Lithuania (7.5), Estonia (6.0), and Latvia (5.4). Incidence of oral cancer in young adults (ages 20–39 years old) in Scandinavia has reportedly risen approximately 6-fold between 1960 and 1994 The high incidence rate of oral and pharyngeal cancer in Denmark could be attributed to their higher alcohol intake than citizens of other Scandinavian countries and low intake of fruits and vegetables in general.

====Eastern Europe====
Hungary (23.3), Slovakia (16.4), and Romania (15.5) reported the highest incidences of oral and pharyngeal cancer. Hungary also recorded the highest incidence in both genders as well as the highest mortality rates in Europe. It is ranked third globally for cancer mortality rates. Cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, inequalities in the care received by people with cancer, and gender-specific systemic risk factors have been determined as the leading causes for the high morbidity and mortality rates in Hungary.

====Western Europe====
The incidence rates of oral cancer in western Europe found France, Germany and Belgium to be highest. The ASRs (per 100,000) were 15.0, 14.6, and 14.1, respectively. When filtered by gender category, the same countries rank top 3 for male, however, in different order of Belgium (21.9), Germany (23.1), and France (23.1). France, Belgium, and the Netherlands rank highest for females, with ASRs 7.6, 7.0, and 7.0, respectively.

====Southern Europe====
Incidence of oral and oropharyngeal cancers were recorded, finding Portugal, Croatia and Serbia to have highest rates (ASR per 100,000). These values are 15.4, 12, and 11.7, respectively.

===North America===
It is the eleventh-most-common cancer in the United States among males while in Canada and Mexico it is the twelfth and thirteenth-most-common cancer respectively. The ASIR for lip and oral cavity cancer among men in Canada and Mexico is 4.2 and 3.1, respectively.

Of all the cancers, oral cancer attributes to 3% in males, opposed to 2% in women. New cases of oral cancer in US as of 2013, approximated almost 66,000 with almost 14000 attributed from tongue cancer, and nearly 12000 from the mouth, and the remainder from the oral cavity and pharynx. In the previous year, 1.6% of lip and oral cavity cancers were diagnosed, where the age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR) across all geographic regions of United States of America estimates at 5.2 per 100,000 population.

In 2022, close to 54,000 Americans are projected to be diagnosed with oral or oropharyngeal cancer. 66% of the time, these will be found as late stage three and four disease. It will cause over 8,000 deaths. Of those newly diagnosed, only slightly more than half will be alive in five years. Similar survival estimates are reported from other countries. For example, five-year relative survival for oral cavity cancer in Germany is about 55%. In the US oral cancer accounts for about 8 percent of all malignant growths.

Oral cancers overall risk higher in black males opposed to white males, however specific oral cancers-such as of the lip, have a higher risk in white males opposed to black males. Overall, rates of oral cancer between gender groups (male and female) seem to be decreasing, according to data from 3 studies.

===South America===
The ASIR across all geographic regions of South America as of 2012 sits at 3.8 per 100,000 population where approximately 6,046 deaths have occurred due to lip and oral cavity cancer, where the age-standardized mortality rate remains at 1.4.

In Brazil, however, lip and oral cavity cancer is the 7th most common cancer, with an estimated 6,930 new cases diagnosed in the year 2012. This number is rising and has an overall higher ASIR at 7.2 per 100,000 population whereby an approx 3000 deaths have occurred 

Rates are increasing across both males and females. As of 2017, almost 50000 new cases of oropharyngeal cancers will be diagnosed, with incidence rates being more than twice as high in men than women.

===Asia===
Oral cancer is one of the most-common types of cancer in Asia due to its association with smoking (tobacco, bidi), betel quid and alcohol consumption. Regionally incidence varies with highest rates in South Asia, particularly India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. In South East Asia and Arab countries, although the prevalence is not as high, estimated incidences of oral cancer ranged from 1.6 to 8.6/ 100,000 and 1.8 to 2.13/ 100,000 respectively. According to GLOBOCAN 2012, the estimated age-standardised rates of cancer incidence and mortality was higher in males than females. However, in some areas, specifically South East Asia, similar rates were recorded for both genders. In 2012, there were 97,400 deaths recorded due to oral cancer.

====India====
Oral cancer is the third-most-common form of cancer in India with over 77 000 new cases diagnosed in 2012 (2.3:1 male to female ratio). Studies estimate over five deaths per hour. One of the reasons behind such high incidence might be popularity of betel and areca nuts, which are considered to be risk factors for development of oral cavity cancers.

===Africa===
There is limited data for the prevalence of oral cancer in Africa. The following rates describe the number of new cases (for incidence rates) or deaths (for mortality rates) per 100 000 individuals per year.

The incidence rate of oral cancer is 2.6 for both sexes. The rate is higher in males at 3.3 and lower in females at 2.0.

The mortality rate is lower than the incidence rate at 1.6 for both sexes. The rate is again higher for males at 2.1 and lower for females at 1.3.

===Australia===
The following rates describe the number of new cases or deaths per 100 000 individuals per year. The incidence rate of oral cancer is 6.3 for both sexes; this is higher in males at 6.8–8.8 and lower in females at 3.7–3.9. The mortality rate is significantly lower than the incidence rate at 1.0 for both sexes. The rate is higher in males at 1.4 and lower in females at 0.6. Table 1 provides age-standardised incidence and mortality rates for oral cancer based on the location in the mouth. The location &#x27;other mouth&#x27; refers to the buccal mucosa, the vestibule and other unspecified parts of the mouth. The data suggests lip cancer has the highest incidence rate while gingival cancer has the lowest rate overall. In terms of mortality rates, oropharyngeal cancer has the highest rate in males and tongue cancer has the highest rate in females. Lip, palatal and gingival cancer have the lowest mortality rates overall.

==Other animals==
Oral cancers are the fourth most common type seen in other animals in veterinary medicine, with older animals having higher chances of developing it.

Dogs that are a breed that is at higher risk of developing oral cancer are more susceptible. Tumors that are found early in development can be removed by surgery, however some cases involve removing a part of the jaw. Chemotherapy is used following surgeries or to remove a tumor that cannot be accessed. Tumors that are caught when the cancer has already spread to other places of the body will result in the dog living for only 6-12 more months.

The most common type of oral cancer seen in cats is squamous cell carcinoma. Due to tumors developing in hidden spots such as beneath the tongue, when the tumors in the cats mouth are caught it is often untreatable. Risk factors include secondhand smoke, as the smoke settles on the fur which is ingested when cats groom, and potentially the over consumption of canned food and use of flea collars.

<text>Church of Christ may refer to:

==Church groups==
* Christianity, the Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ
* Christian Church, an ecclesiological term used by denominations to describe the true body of Christians, can include only the denomination itself or a larger group of Christians from multiple denominations or traditions

===Restoration Movement===
* The Restoration Movement originated on the American frontier in the early 19th century, many congregations used the name &quot;Church of Christ&quot; along with a geographic descriptor. The Restoration Movement has split into several different groups and denominations, all of which have used the term &quot;Church of Christ&quot; or &quot;Churches of Christ&quot;. These include:
**Churches of Christ, a conservative group of congregations distinguished by their prohibition of instrumental music in worship
***Churches of Christ (non-institutional), an identifiable subgroup within the Churches of Christ which opposes organizations beyond the local congregation
***International Churches of Christ, a group of churches that split off from the main Churches of Christ in the 1970s and 1980s
****International Christian Church, a group of churches that split of from the International Churches of Christ in the early 2000s
**Christian churches and churches of Christ, a conservative group of congregations often referred to as &quot;Independents&quot; due to their official separation from the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in the mid-20th century. These churches can often be distinguished from the Churches of Christ by their use of instrumental music in worship.
**Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), a mainline Protestant denomination in the United States and Canada. Historically many of its congregations used the name &quot;Church of Christ&quot;. After the Churches of Christ were recognized as a distinct group in 1906, congregations using &quot;Church of Christ&quot; that remained with the portion of the movement that would become the Disciples slowly changed their name to Christian Church during the first half of the 20th century
**Churches of Christ in Europe, a group of churches in Europe with connections to the Restoration Movement of the United States. Most Restoration Movement congregations in the United Kingdom have been part of the United Reformed Church since 1981.
**Churches of Christ in Australia, a denomination in Australia influenced by the Restoration Movement in the United States and the United Kingdom. Part of the Disciples Ecumenical Consultative Council.
**Evangelical Christian Church in Canada, a small denomination in Canada with roots in the Restoration Movement
*The World Convention of Churches of Christ is a global convention of the Churches of Christ, Christian Churches and Christian churches and churches of Christ, and Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)
*Other historically-related groups:
**Christian Connection, a group of churches begun in the 1790s which briefly combined with the group of Christians led by Barton W. Stone in Kentucky during the early 19th century. When Stone united with the Disciples led by Alexander Campbell to form the mainstream Restoration Movement most churches from the Christian Connection remained separate, later becoming part of the Congregational Christian Churches in 1931 and then the United Church of Christ in 1957.

<text>Ovarian cancer is a cancerous tumor of an ovary. It may originate from the ovary itself or more commonly from communicating nearby structures such as fallopian tubes or the inner lining of the abdomen. The ovary is made up of three different cell types including epithelial cells, germ cells, and stromal cells. When these cells become abnormal, they have the ability to divide and form tumors. These cells can also invade or spread to other parts of the body. When this process begins, there may be no or only vague symptoms. Symptoms become more noticeable as the cancer progresses. These symptoms may include bloating, vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, abdominal swelling, constipation, and loss of appetite, among others. Common areas to which the cancer may spread include the lining of the abdomen, lymph nodes, lungs, and liver.
The risk of ovarian cancer increases with age. Most cases of ovarian cancer develop after menopause. It is also more common in women who have ovulated more over their lifetime. This includes those who have never had children, those who began ovulation at a younger age and those who reach menopause at an older age. Other risk factors include hormone therapy after menopause, fertility medication, and obesity. Factors that decrease risk include hormonal birth control, tubal ligation, pregnancy, and breast feeding. About 10% of cases are related to inherited genetic risk; women with mutations in the genes &quot;BRCA1&quot; or &quot;BRCA2&quot; have about a 50% chance of developing the disease. Some family cancer syndromes such as hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome also increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Epithelial ovarian carcinoma is the most common type of ovarian cancer, comprising more than 95% of cases. There are five main subtypes of ovarian carcinoma, of which high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common. Less common types of ovarian cancer include germ cell tumors and sex cord stromal tumors. A diagnosis of ovarian cancer is confirmed through a biopsy of tissue, usually removed during surgery.
Screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks. Those at very high risk may have their ovaries removed as a preventive measure. If caught and treated in an early stage, ovarian cancer is often curable. Treatment usually includes some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Outcomes depend on the extent of the disease, the subtype of cancer present, and other medical conditions. The overall five-year survival rate in the United States is 49%. Outcomes are worse in the developing world.
In 2020, new cases occurred in approximately 313,000 women. In 2019 it resulted in 13,445 deaths in the United States. Death from ovarian cancer increased globally between 1990 and 2017 by 84.2%. Ovarian cancer is the second-most common gynecologic cancer in the United States. It causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. Among women it ranks fifth in cancer-related deaths. The typical age of diagnosis is 63. Death from ovarian cancer is more common in North America and Europe than in Africa and Asia. In the United States, it is more common in White and Hispanic women than Black or American Indian women. 
==Signs and symptoms==

===Early symptoms===

Early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may be absent or subtle. In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed. Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome. The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype. Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.

The most typical symptoms of ovarian cancer include bloating, abdominal or pelvic pain or discomfort, back pain, irregular menstruation or postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, pain or bleeding after or during sexual intercourse, loss of appetite, fatigue, diarrhea, indigestion, heartburn, constipation, nausea, feeling full, and possibly urinary symptoms (including frequent urination and urgent urination).

===Later symptoms===

Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases. Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis. The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered. Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule. Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis. Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.

===Children===
In adolescents or children with ovarian tumors, symptoms can include severe abdominal pain, irritation of the peritoneum, or bleeding. Sex cord stromal tumors produce hormones which can lead to the premature development of secondary sex characteristics. Sex cord-stromal tumors in prepubertal children may be manifested by signs of early puberty; abdominal pain and distension are also common. Adolescents with sex cord-stromal tumors may experience amenorrhea. As the cancer becomes more advanced, it can cause an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen and lead to distension. If the malignancy has not been diagnosed by the time it causes ascites, it is typically diagnosed shortly thereafter. Advanced cancers can also cause abdominal masses, lymph node masses, or pleural effusion.

== Risk factors ==
There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman&#x27;s risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating. Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer. During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer. Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have. Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.

The risk of developing ovarian cancer is less for women who have fewer menstrual cycles, no menstrual cycles, breast feeding, take oral contraceptives, have multiple pregnancies, and have a pregnancy at an early age. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is reduced in women who have had tubal ligation (colloquially known as having one&#x27;s &quot;tubes tied&quot;), both ovaries removed, or hysterectomy (an operation in which the uterus is removed). Age is also a risk factor. Non-genetic factors such as diabetes mellitus, high body mass index, and tobacco use are also risk factors for ovarian cancer.

=== Hormones ===
The use of fertility medication may contribute to ovarian borderline tumor formation, but the link between the two is disputed and difficult to study. Fertility drugs may be associated with a higher risk of borderline tumors. Those who have been treated for infertility but remain nulliparous are at higher risk for epithelial ovarian cancer due to hormonal exposure that may lead to proliferation of cells. However, those who are successfully treated for infertility and subsequently give birth are at no higher risk. This may be due to shedding of precancerous cells during pregnancy, but the cause remains unclear. The risk factor may instead be infertility itself, not the treatment.

Hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis are associated with ovarian cancer, but the link is not completely confirmed. Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen likely increases the risk of ovarian cancer. The association has not been confirmed in a large-scale study, but notable studies including the Million Women Study have supported this link. Postmenopausal HRT with combined estrogen and progesterone may increase contemporaneous risk if used for over 5 years, but this risk returns to normal after cessation of therapy. Estrogen HRT with or without progestins increases the risk of endometrioid and serous tumors but lowers the risk of mucinous tumors. Higher doses of estrogen increase this risk. Endometriosis is another risk factor for ovarian cancer, as is pain with menstruation. Endometriosis is associated with clear-cell and endometrioid subtypes, low-grade serous tumors, stage I and II tumors, grade 1 tumors, and lower mortality. Ovarian cancer which coexists with endometriosis is known as endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer. The presence of transitional lesions (atypical endometriosis, borderline tumors) linking endometriosis to its malignant transformation is termed endometriosis-correlated ovarian cancer while the simple presence of endometriosis and ovarian cancer without the proof of transition is termed endometriosis-incidental ovarian cancer.

Before menopause, obesity can increase a person&#x27;s risk of ovarian cancer, but this risk is not present after menopause. This risk is also relevant in those who are both obese and have never used HRT. A similar association with ovarian cancer appears in taller women.

=== Genetics ===
A family history of ovarian cancer is a risk factor for ovarian cancer. Women with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (Lynch syndrome), and those with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genetic abnormalities are at increased risk.

The major genetic risk factor for ovarian cancer is a mutation in &quot;BRCA1&quot; or &quot;BRCA2&quot; genes, or in DNA mismatch repair genes, which is present in 10% of ovarian cancer cases. Only one allele needs to be mutated to place a person at high risk. The gene can be inherited through either the maternal or paternal line, but has variable penetrance. Though mutations in these genes are usually associated with increased risk of breast cancer, they also carry a substantial lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, a risk that peaks in a person&#x27;s 40s and 50s. The lowest risk cited is 30% and the highest 60%. Mutations in BRCA1 have a lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer of 15–45%. Mutations in &quot;BRCA2&quot; are less risky than those with &quot;BRCA1&quot;, with a lifetime risk of 10% (lowest risk cited) to 40% (highest risk cited). On average, BRCA-associated cancers develop 15 years before their sporadic counterparts because people who inherit the mutations on one copy of their gene only need one mutation to start the process of carcinogenesis, whereas people with two normal genes would need to acquire two mutations.

In the United States, five of 100 women with a first-degree relative with ovarian cancer will eventually get ovarian cancer themselves, placing those with affected family members at triple the risk of women with unaffected family members. Seven of 100 women with two or more relatives with ovarian cancer will eventually get ovarian cancer. In general, 5–10% of ovarian cancer cases have a genetic cause. BRCA mutations are associated with high-grade serous nonmucinous epithelial ovarian cancer.

A strong family history of endometrial cancer, colon cancer, or other gastrointestinal cancers may indicate the presence of a syndrome known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (also known as Lynch syndrome), which confers a higher risk for developing a number of cancers, including ovarian cancer. Lynch syndrome is caused by mutations in mismatch repair genes, including &quot;MSH2, MLH1, MLH6, PMS1&quot;, and &quot;PMS2&quot;. The risk of ovarian cancer for an individual with Lynch syndrome is between 10 and 12 percent. Women of Icelandic descent, European Jewish descent/Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and Hungarian descent are at higher risk for epithelial ovarian cancer. Estrogen receptor beta gene (ESR2) seems to be a key to pathogenesis and response to therapy. Other genes that have been associated with ovarian cancer are &quot;BRIP1&quot;, &quot;MSH6&quot;, &quot;RAD51C&quot; and &quot;RAD51D&quot;. &quot;CDH1&quot;, &quot;CHEK2&quot;, &quot;PALB2&quot; and &quot;RAD50&quot; have also been associated with ovarian cancer.

Several rare genetic disorders are associated with specific subtypes of ovarian cancer. Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, also predisposes women to sex cord tumour with annular tubules. Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome are associated with granulosa cell tumors in children and may also be associated with Sertoli-Leydig tumors. Benign fibromas are associated with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.

=== Diet ===

Alcohol consumption does not appear to be related to ovarian cancer.

The American Cancer Society recommends a healthy eating pattern that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and a diet that avoids or limits red and processed meats and processed sugar. High consumption of total, saturated and trans-fats increases ovarian cancer risk. A 2021 umbrella review found that coffee, egg, and fat intake significantly increases the risk of ovarian cancer. There is mixed evidence from studies on ovarian cancer risk and consumption of dairy products.

=== Environmental factors ===
Industrialized nations, with the exception of Japan, have high rates of epithelial ovarian cancer, which may be due to diet in those countries. White women are at a 30–40% higher risk for ovarian cancer when compared to Black women and Hispanic women, likely due to socioeconomic factors; white women tend to have fewer children and different rates of gynecologic surgeries that affect risk for ovarian cancer.

Tentative evidence suggests that talc, pesticides, and herbicides increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The American Cancer Society notes that as of now, no study has been able to accurately link any single chemical in the environment, or in the human diet, directly to mutations that cause ovarian cancer.

=== Other ===

Other factors that have been investigated, such as smoking, low levels of vitamin D in the blood, presence of inclusion ovarian cysts, and infection with human papilloma virus (the cause of some cases of cervical cancer), have been disproven as risk factors for ovarian cancer. The carcinogenicity of perineal talc is controversial, because it can act as an irritant if it travels through the reproductive tract to the ovaries. Case-control studies have shown that use of perineal talc does increase the risk of ovarian cancer, but using talc more often does not create a greater risk. Use of talc elsewhere on the body is unrelated to ovarian cancer. Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from epithelial ovarian cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.

Increased age (up to the 70s) is a risk factor for epithelial ovarian cancer because more mutations in cells can accumulate and eventually cause cancer. Those over 80 are at slightly lower risk.

Smoking tobacco is associated with a higher risk of mucinous ovarian cancer; after smoking cessation, the risk eventually returns to normal. Higher levels of C-reactive protein are associated with a higher risk of developing ovarian cancer.

=== Protective factors ===
Suppression of ovulation, which would otherwise cause damage to the ovarian epithelium and, consequently, inflammation, is generally protective. This effect can be achieved by having children, taking combined oral contraceptives, and breast feeding, all of which are protective factors. A longer period of breastfeeding correlates with a larger decrease in the risk of ovarian cancer. Each birth decreases risk of ovarian cancer more, and this effect is seen with up to five births. Combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by up to 50%, and the protective effect of combined oral contraceptives can last 25–30 years after they are discontinued. Regular use of aspirin (MALOVA (MALignant OVArian cancer) study) or acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer; other NSAIDs do not seem to have a similar protective effect.

Tubal ligation is protective because carcinogens are unable to reach the ovary and fimbriae via the vagina, uterus, and Fallopian tubes. Tubal ligation is also protective in women with the BRCA1 mutation, but not the BRCA2 mutation. Hysterectomy reduces the risk, and removal of both Fallopian tubes and ovaries (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) dramatically reduces the risk of not only ovarian cancer but breast cancer as well. This is still a topic of research, as the link between hysterectomy and lower ovarian cancer risk is controversial. The reasons that hysterectomy may be protective have not been elucidated as of 2015.

A diet that includes large amounts of carotene, fiber, and vitamins with low amounts of fat—specifically, a diet with non-starchy vegetables (e.g. broccoli and onions) may be protective. Dietary fiber is associated with a significant reduced risk of ovarian cancer. A 2021 review found that green leafy vegetables, allium vegetables, fiber, flavanoids and green tea intake can significantly reduce ovarian cancer risk.

== Pathophysiology ==

Ovarian cancer forms when errors in normal ovarian cell growth occur. Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called an ovarian tumor or growth. These abnormal cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow excessively. When an ovary releases an egg, the egg follicle bursts open and becomes the corpus luteum. This structure needs to be repaired by dividing cells in the ovary. Continuous ovulation for a long time means more repair of the ovary by dividing cells, which can acquire mutations in each division.

Overall, the most common gene mutations in ovarian cancer occur in &quot;NF1, BRCA1, BRCA2, &quot;and &quot;CDK12&quot;. Type I ovarian cancers, which tend to be less aggressive, tend to have microsatellite instability in several genes, including both oncogenes (most notably &quot;BRAF&quot; and &quot;KRAS&quot;) and tumor suppressors (most notably &quot;PTEN&quot;). The most common mutations in Type I cancers are &quot;KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, PTEN, PIK3CA,&quot; and &quot;ARID1A.&quot; Type II cancers, the more aggressive type, have different genes mutated, including &quot;p53, BRCA1&quot;, and &quot;BRCA2&quot;. Low-grade cancers tend to have mutations in KRAS, whereas cancers of any grade that develop from low malignant potential tumors tend to have mutations in p53. Type I cancers tend to develop from precursor lesions, whereas Type II cancers can develop from a serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma. Serous cancers that have BRCA mutations also inevitably have p53 mutations, indicating that the removal of both functional genes is important for cancer to develop.

In 50% of high-grade serous cancers, homologous recombination DNA repair is dysfunctional, as are the notch and FOXM1 signaling pathways. They also almost always have p53 mutations. Other than this, mutations in high-grade serous carcinoma are hard to characterize beyond their high degree of genomic instability. &quot;BRCA1&quot; and &quot;BRCA2&quot; are essential for homologous recombination DNA repair, and germline mutations in these genes are found in about 15% of women with ovarian cancer. The most common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the frameshift mutations that originated in a small founding population of Ashkenazi Jews.

Almost 100% of rare mucinous carcinomas have mutations in &quot;KRAS&quot; and amplifications of &quot;ERBB2&quot; (also known as &quot;Her2/neu&quot;). Overall, 20% of ovarian cancers have mutations in &quot;Her2/neu&quot;.

Serous carcinomas may develop from serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, rather than developing spontaneously from ovarian tissue. Other carcinomas develop from cortical inclusion cysts, which are groups of epithelial ovarian cells inside the stroma.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Examination ===
Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound. Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery. The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.

Ovarian cancer&#x27;s early stages (I/II) are difficult to diagnose because most symptoms are nonspecific and thus of little use in diagnosis; as a result, it is rarely diagnosed until it spreads and advances to later stages (III/IV). Additionally, symptoms of ovarian cancer may appear similar to irritable bowel syndrome. In women in whom pregnancy is a possibility, BHCG level can be measured during the diagnosis process. Serum alpha-fetoprotein, neuron-specific enolase, and lactate dehydrogenase can be measured in young girls and adolescents with suspected ovarian tumors as younger women with ovarian cancer are more likely to have malignant germ cell tumors.

A physical examination, including a pelvic examination, and a pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal or otherwise) are both essential for diagnosis: physical examination may reveal increased abdominal girth and/or ascites (fluid within the abdominal cavity), while pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. An adnexal mass is a significant finding that often indicates ovarian cancer, especially if it is fixed, nodular, irregular, solid, and/or bilateral. 13–21% of adnexal masses are caused by malignancy; however, there are other benign causes of adnexal masses, including ovarian follicular cyst, leiomyoma, endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy, hydrosalpinx, tuboovarian abscess, ovarian torsion, dermoid cyst, cystadenoma (serous or mucinous), diverticular or appendiceal abscess, nerve sheath tumor, pelvic kidney, ureteral or bladder diverticulum, benign cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum, peritoneal tuberculosis, or paraovarian cyst. Ovaries that can be felt are also a sign of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women. Other parts of a physical examination for suspected ovarian cancer can include a breast examination and a digital rectal exam. Palpation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes may reveal lymphadenopathy, which can be indicative of metastasis. Another indicator may be the presence of a pleural effusion, which can be noted on auscultation.

When an ovarian malignancy is included in a list of diagnostic possibilities, a limited number of laboratory tests are indicated. A complete blood count and serum electrolyte test is usually obtained; when an ovarian cancer is present, these tests often show a high number of platelets (20–25% of patients) and low blood sodium levels due to chemical signals secreted by the tumor. A positive test for inhibin A and inhibin B can indicate a granulosa cell tumor.

A blood test for a marker molecule called CA-125 is useful in differential diagnosis and in follow up of the disease, but it by itself has not been shown to be an effective method to screen for early-stage ovarian cancer due to its unacceptable low sensitivity and specificity. CA-125 levels in premenopausal women over 200 U/mL may indicate ovarian cancer, as may any elevation in CA-125 above 35 U/mL in post-menopausal women. CA-125 levels are not accurate in early stage ovarian cancer, as half of stage I ovarian cancer patients have a normal CA-125 level. CA-125 may also be elevated in benign (non-cancerous) conditions, including endometriosis, pregnancy, uterine fibroids, menstruation, ovarian cysts, systemic lupus erythematosus, liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, and leiomyoma. HE4 is another candidate for ovarian cancer testing, though it has not been extensively tested. Other tumor markers for ovarian cancer include CA19-9, CA72-4, CA15-3, immunosuppressive acidic protein, haptoglobin-alpha, OVX1, mesothelin, lysophosphatidic acid, osteopontin, and fibroblast growth factor 23.

Use of blood test panels may help in diagnosis. The OVA1 panel includes CA-125, beta-2 microglobulin, transferrin, apolipoprotein A1, and transthyretin. OVA1 above 5.0 in premenopausal women and 4.4 in postmenopausal women indicates a high risk for cancer. A different set of laboratory tests is used for detecting sex cord-stromal tumors. High levels of testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, combined with other symptoms and high levels of inhibin A and inhibin B can be indicative of an SCST of any type.

Current research is looking at ways to consider tumor marker proteomics in combination with other indicators of disease (i.e. radiology and/or symptoms) to improve diagnostic accuracy. The challenge in such an approach is that the disparate prevalence of ovarian cancer means that even testing with very high sensitivity and specificity will still lead to a number of false positive results, which in turn may lead to issues such as performing surgical procedures in which cancer is not found intraoperatively. Genomics approaches have not yet been developed for ovarian cancer.

CT scanning is preferred to assess the extent of the tumor in the abdominopelvic cavity, though magnetic resonance imaging can also be used. CT scanning can also be useful for finding omental caking or differentiating fluid from solid tumor in the abdomen, especially in low malignant potential tumors. However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a chest x-ray is used to detect metastases in the chest or pleural effusion. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a barium enema, which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease. Positron emission tomography, bone scans, and paracentesis are of limited use; in fact, paracentesis can cause metastases to form at the needle insertion site and may not provide useful results. However, paracentesis can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present. A physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform mammography or an endometrial biopsy (in the case of abnormal bleeding) to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy, respectively. Vaginal ultrasonography is often the first-line imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found. Several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations. However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.

To definitively diagnose ovarian cancer, a surgical procedure to inspect the abdomen is required. This can be an open procedure (laparotomy, incision through the abdominal wall) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy). During this procedure, suspicious tissue is removed and sent for microscopic analysis. Usually, this includes a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, removal of a single affected ovary and Fallopian tube. Fluid from the abdominal cavity can also be analyzed for cancerous cells. If cancer is found, this procedure can also be used to determine the extent of its spread (which is a form of tumor staging).

Pafolacianine is indicated for use in adults with ovarian cancer to help identify cancerous lesions during surgery. It is a diagnostic agent that is administered in the form of an intravenous injection prior to surgery.

==== Risk scoring ====
A widely recognized method of estimating the risk of malignant ovarian cancer is the risk of malignancy index (RMI), calculated based on an initial workup. An RMI score of over 200 or 250 is generally felt to indicate high risk for ovarian cancer.

The RMI is calculated as:

:RMI = ultrasound score × menopausal score x CA-125 level in U/ml.

Two methods can be used to determine the ultrasound score and menopausal score, with the resultant scores being referred to as RMI 1 and RMI 2, respectively, depending on what method is used.

Another method for quantifying risk of ovarian cancer is the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA), which observes levels over time and determines if they are increasing rapidly enough to warrant transvaginal ultrasound. The Risk of Ovarian Malignancy algorithm uses CA-125 levels and HE4 levels to calculate the risk of ovarian cancer; it may be more effective than RMI. The IOTA models can be used to estimate the probability that an adnexal tumor is malignant. They include LR2 risk model, The Simple Rules risk (SRrisk) calculation and Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the Adnexa (ADNEX) model that can be used to assess risk of malignancy in an adnexal mass, based on its characteristics and risk factors. The QCancer (Ovary) algorithm is used to predict likelihood of ovarian cancer from risk factors.

Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (ORADS) is a standardized system developed by the American College of Radiology to improve the management and diagnosis of ovarian and adnexal masses. It provides a consistent framework for interpreting imaging findings, particularly from ultrasound, and assigns risk stratification categories that guide clinical decision-making. By utilizing a clear set of criteria and terminology, ORADS aims to enhance communication among healthcare providers, increase diagnostic accuracy, and ultimately improve patient outcomes in the evaluation of ovarian and adnexal pathologies. Additionally, a specialized ORADS calculator is available to facilitate reporting, helping radiologists and clinicians quickly and accurately classify findings according to the system&#x27;s guidelines.

=== Pathology ===
Ovarian cancers are classified according to the microscopic appearance of their structures (histology or histopathology). Histology dictates many aspects of clinical treatment, management, and prognosis. The gross pathology of ovarian cancers is very similar regardless of histologic type: ovarian tumors have solid and cystic masses. According to SEER, the types of ovarian cancers in women age 20 and over are:

Ovarian cancers are histologically and genetically divided into type I or type II. Type I cancers are of low histological grade and include endometrioid, mucinous, and clear-cell carcinomas. Type II cancers are of higher histological grade and include serous carcinoma and carcinosarcoma.

==== Epithelial carcinoma ====

Epithelial ovarian cancer typically presents at an advanced stage and is derived from the malignant transformation of the epithelium of the ovarian surface, peritoneum, or fallopian tube. It is the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death. There are various types of epithelial ovarian cancer, including serous tumor, endometrioid tumor, clear-cell tumor, mucinous tumor, and undifferentiated or unclassified tumors. Annually worldwide, 230,000 women will be diagnosed and 150,000 will die. It has a 46% 5 year survival rate after diagnosis because of the advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Typically, around 75% of patients are diagnosed as having an advanced stage of the disease because of the asymptomatic nature of its presentation. There is a genomic predisposition to epithelial ovarian cancer and the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been found to be the causative genes in 65–75% of hereditary epithelial ovarian cancer.

===== Serous carcinoma =====

Serous ovarian cancer is the most common type of epithelial ovarian cancer and it accounts for about two-thirds of cases of epithelial ovarian cancer. Low-grade serous carcinoma is less aggressive than high-grade serous carcinomas, though it does not typically respond well to chemotherapy or hormonal treatments. Serous carcinomas are thought to begin in the Fallopian tube. High grade serous carcinoma accounts for 75% of all epithelial ovarian cancer. About 15–20% of high grade serous carcinoma have germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Histologically, the growth pattern of high grade serous carcinoma is heterogenous and has some papillary or solid growth patterns. The tumor cells are atypical with large, irregular nuclei. It has a high proliferation rate. 50% of the time, serous carcinomas are bilateral, and in 85% of cases, they have spread beyond the ovary at the time of diagnosis.

Serous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma (STIC) is now recognized to be the precursor lesion of most so-called ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas.
STIC is characterised by
#Abnormal p53 staining
#Ki67 proliferation index in excess of 10%
#Positive WT1 (to exclude metastases)

===== Small-cell carcinoma =====

Small-cell ovarian carcinoma is rare and aggressive, with two main subtypes: hypercalcemic and pulmonary. This rare malignancy most commonly affects young women under the age of 40 years old with a range between 14 months and 58 years. The mean age of diagnosis of 24 years. Approximately two-thirds of patients will present with paraneoplastic hypercalcemia meaning they have high blood calcium levels for an unknown reason. The tumor secretes Parathyroid hormone related protein which acts similarly to PTH and binds PTH receptors in the bone and kidney causing hypercalcemia. Recent research has found an inactivating germline and somatic mutation of &quot;SMARCA4&quot; gene. The hypercalcemic subtype is very aggressive and has an overall survival rate of 16% with a recurrence rate of 65% in patients who receive treatment. Patients who have spread of the disease to other parts of the body tend to die 2 years after the diagnosis. Extra-ovarian spread is involved in 50% of cases and lymph node spread is present in 55% of cases. The most common initial presentation is a rapidly growing unilateral pelvic mass with a mean size of 15 cm. Histologically, it is characterized by many sheets of small, round, tightly packed cells with clusters, nests, and cords. Immunohistochemistry is typically positive for vimentin, cytokeratin, CD10, p53, and WT-1.

Small cell ovarian carcinoma of the pulmonary subtype presents differently from the hypercalcemic subtype. Typically, pulmonary small cell ovarian cancer usually affects both ovaries of older women and looks like oat-cell carcinoma of the lung. The average age of disease onset is 59 years old and approximately 45% of cases are bilateral for the pulmonary subtype. Additionally, several hormones can be elevated in the pulmonary subtype including serotonin, somatostatin, insulin, gastrin, and calcitonin.

====== Primary peritoneal carcinoma ======
Primary peritoneal carcinomas develop from the peritoneum, a membrane that covers the abdominal cavity that has the same embryonic origin as the ovary. They are often discussed and classified with ovarian cancers when they affect the ovary. They can develop even after the ovaries have been removed and may appear similar to mesothelioma.

===== Clear-cell carcinoma =====

Ovarian clear-cell carcinoma is a rare subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer. Those diagnosed with ovarian clear-cell carcinoma are typically younger at the age of diagnosis and diagnosed at earlier stages than other subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer. The highest incidence of clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary have been observed among young Asian women, especially those of Korean, Taiwanese, and Japanese background. Endometriosis has been linked to being the main risk factor for the development of clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary and has been found to be present in 50% of women diagnosed with clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary. The development of clots in the legs such as deep vein thromboembolism or in the lungs with pulmonary embolism is reported to be 40% higher in patients with clear-cell carcinoma than other epithelial ovarian cancer subtypes. Mutations in molecular pathways such as ARID1A, PIK3, and PIK3CA have been found to be linked to clear-cell carcinoma. They typically present as a large, unilateral mass, with a mean size between 13 and 15 cm. 90% of cases are unilateral. Ovarian clear-cell carcinoma does not typically respond well to chemotherapy due to intrinsic chemoresistance, therefore treatment is typically with aggressive cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy.

===== Clear-cell adenocarcinoma =====
Clear-cell adenocarcinomas are histopathologically similar to other clear-cell carcinomas, with clear cells and hobnail cells. They represent approximately 5–10% of epithelial ovarian cancers and are associated with endometriosis in the pelvic cavity. They are typically early-stage and therefore curable by surgery, but advanced clear-cell adenocarcinomas (approximately 20%) have a poor prognosis and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy.

===== Endometrioid =====
Endometrioid adenocarcinomas make up approximately 13–15% of all ovarian cancers. Because they are typically low-grade, endometrioid adenocarcinomas have a good prognosis. The median age of diagnosis is around 53 years of age. These tumors frequently co-occur with endometriosis or endometrial cancer. Cancer antigen 125 levels are typically elevated and a family history of a first degree relative with endometrioid ovarian cancer is associated with increased risk of developing endometrioid ovarian cancer. The average tumor size is larger than 10 cm.

====== Malignant mixed müllerian tumor (carcinosarcoma) ======
Mixed müllerian tumors make up less than 1% of ovarian cancer. They have epithelial and mesenchymal cells visible and tend to have a poor prognosis.

===== Mucinous =====
Mucinous tumors include mucinous adenocarcinoma and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.

====== Mucinous adenocarcinoma ======
Mucinous adenocarcinomas make up 5–10% of epithelial ovarian cancers. Histologically, they are similar to intestinal or cervical adenocarcinomas and are often actually metastases of appendiceal or colon cancers. Advanced mucinous adenocarcinomas have a poor prognosis, generally worse than serous tumors, and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy, though they are rare.

====== Pseudomyxoma peritonei ======
&quot;Pseudomyxoma peritonei&quot; refers to a collection of encapsulated mucus or gelatinous material in the abdominopelvic cavity, which is very rarely caused by a primary mucinous ovarian tumor. More commonly, it is associated with ovarian metastases of intestinal cancer.

===== Undifferentiated epithelial =====
Undifferentiated cancers - those where the cell type cannot be determined - make up about 10% of epithelial ovarian cancers and have a comparatively poor prognosis. When examined under the microscope, these tumors have very abnormal cells that are arranged in clumps or sheets. Usually there are recognizable clumps of serous cells inside the tumor.

====== Malignant Brenner tumor ======
Malignant Brenner tumors are rare. Histologically, they have dense fibrous stroma with areas of transitional epithelium and some squamous differentiation. To be classified as a malignant Brenner tumor, it must have Brenner tumor foci and transitional cell carcinoma. The transitional cell carcinoma component is typically poorly differentiated and resembles urinary tract cancer.

====== Transitional cell carcinoma ======
Transitional cell carcinomas represent less than 5% of ovarian cancers. Histologically, they appear similar to bladder carcinoma. The prognosis is intermediate - better than most epithelial cancers but worse than malignant Brenner tumors.

==== Sex cord-stromal tumor ====
Sex cord-stromal tumor, including estrogen-producing granulosa cell tumor, the benign thecoma, and virilizing Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor or arrhenoblastoma, accounts for 7% of ovarian cancers. They occur most frequently in women between 50 and 69 years of age but can occur in women of any age, including young girls. They are not typically aggressive and are usually unilateral; they are therefore usually treated with surgery alone. Sex cord-stromal tumors are the main hormone-producing ovarian tumors.

Several different cells from the mesenchyme can give rise to sex-cord or stromal tumors. These include fibroblasts and endocrine cells. The symptoms of a sex-cord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer. Common signs and symptoms include ovarian torsion, hemorrhage from or rupture of the tumor, an abdominal mass, and hormonal disruption. In children, isosexual precocious pseudopuberty may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen. These tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation (excessive bleeding, infrequent menstruation, or no menstruation) or postmenopausal bleeding. Because these tumors produce estrogen, they can cause or occur at the same time as endometrial cancer or breast cancer. Other sex-cord/stromal tumors present with distinct symptoms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors cause virilization and excessive hair growth due to the production of testosterone and androstenedione, which can also cause Cushing&#x27;s syndrome in rare cases. Also, sex-cord stromal tumors occur that do not cause a hormonal imbalance, including benign fibromas, which cause ascites and hydrothorax. With germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors are the most common ovarian cancer diagnosed in women under 20.

===== Granulosa cell tumor =====
Granulosa cell tumors are the most common sex-cord stromal tumors, making up 70% of cases, and are divided into two histologic subtypes: adult granulosa cell tumors, which develop in women over 50, and juvenile granulosa tumors, which develop before puberty or before the age of 30. Both develop in the ovarian follicle from a population of cells that surrounds germinal cells.

====== Adult granulosa cell tumor ======
Adult granulosa cell tumors are characterized by later onset (30+ years, 50 on average). These tumors produce high levels of estrogen, which causes its characteristic symptoms: menometrorrhagia; endometrial hyperplasia; tender, enlarged breasts; postmenopausal bleeding; and secondary amenorrhea. The mass of the tumor can cause other symptoms, including abdominal pain and distension, or symptoms similar to an ectopic pregnancy if the tumor bleeds and ruptures.

====== Juvenile granulosa cell tumor ======

===== Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor =====
Sertoli-Leydig tumors are most common in women before the age of 30, and particularly common before puberty.

===== Sclerosing stromal tumors =====
Sclerosing stromal tumors typically occur in girls before puberty or women before the age of 30.

==== Germ cell tumor ====

Germ cell tumors of the ovary develop from the ovarian germ cells. Germ cell tumor accounts for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are teratomas and most teratomas are benign. Malignant teratomas tend to occur in older women, when one of the germ layers in the tumor develops into a squamous cell carcinoma. Germ-cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20s–30s) and girls, making up 70% of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group. Germ-cell tumors can include dysgerminomas, teratomas, yolk sac tumors/endodermal sinus tumors, and choriocarcinomas, when they arise in the ovary. Some germ-cell tumors have an isochromosome 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other. Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They are more likely to be stage I at diagnosis. Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: choriocarcinomas are monitored with beta-HCG and endodermal sinus tumors with alpha-fetoprotein.

Germ-cell tumors are typically discovered when they become large, palpable masses. However, like sex cord tumors, they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and, in children, isosexual precocious puberty. They frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, especially para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes. The most common symptom of germ cell tumors is subacute abdominal pain caused by the tumor bleeding, necrotizing, or stretching the ovarian capsule. If the tumor ruptures, causes significant bleeding, or torses the ovary, it can cause acute abdominal pain, which occurs in less than 10% of those with germ-cell tumors. They can also secrete hormones which change the menstrual cycle. In 25% of germ-cell tumors, the cancer is discovered during a routine examination and does not cause symptoms.

Diagnosing germ cell tumors may be difficult because the normal menstrual cycle and puberty can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of teen pregnancy. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, karyotype, human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring gonadal dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign ovarian cyst.

===== Dysgerminoma =====
Dysgerminoma accounts for 35% of ovarian cancer in young women and is the most likely germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes; nodal metastases occur in 25–30% of cases. These tumors may have mutations in the &quot;KIT&quot; gene, a mutation known for its role in gastrointestinal stromal tumor. People with an XY karyotype and ovaries (gonadal dysgenesis) or an X,0 karyotype and ovaries (Turner syndrome) who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at risk for a gonadoblastoma in the other ovary, and in this case, both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor. Gonadoblastomas in people with Swyer or Turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40% of cases. However, in general, dysgerminomas are bilateral 10–20% of the time.

They are composed of cells that cannot differentiate further and develop directly from germ cells or from gonadoblastomas. Dysgerminomas contain syncytiotrophoblasts in approximately 5% of cases, and can therefore cause elevated hCG levels. On gross appearance, dysgerminomas are typically pink to tan-colored, have multiple lobes, and are solid. Microscopically, they appear identical to seminomas and very close to embryonic primordial germ cells, having large, polyhedral, rounded clear cells. The nuclei are uniform and round or square with prominent nucleoli and the cytoplasm has high levels of glycogen. Inflammation is another prominent histologic feature of dysgerminomas.

===== Choriocarcinoma =====

Choriocarcinoma can occur as a primary ovarian tumor developing from a germ cell, though it is usually a gestational disease that metastasizes to the ovary. Primary ovarian choriocarcinoma has a poor prognosis and can occur without a pregnancy. They produce high levels of hCG and can cause early puberty in children or menometrorrhagia (irregular, heavy menstruation) after menarche.

===== Immature (solid) teratoma =====
Immature, or solid, teratomas are the most common type of ovarian germ cell tumor, making up 40–50% of cases. Teratomas are characterized by the presence of disorganized tissues arising from all three embryonic germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm; immature teratomas also have undifferentiated stem cells that make them more malignant than mature teratomas (dermoid cysts). The different tissues are visible on gross pathology and often include bone, cartilage, hair, mucus, or sebum, but these tissues are not visible from the outside, which appears to be a solid mass with lobes and cysts. Histologically, they have large amounts of neuroectoderm organized into sheets and tubules along with glia; the amount of neural tissue determines the histologic grade. Immature teratomas usually only affect one ovary (10% co-occur with dermoid cysts) and usually metastasize throughout the peritoneum. They can also cause mature teratoma implants to grow throughout the abdomen in a disease called growing teratoma syndrome; these are usually benign but will continue to grow during chemotherapy, and often necessitate further surgery. Unlike mature teratomas, immature teratomas form many adhesions, making them less likely to cause ovarian torsion. There is no specific marker for immature teratomas, but carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA-125, CA19-9, or AFP can sometimes indicate an immature teratoma.

Stage I teratomas make up the majority (75%) of cases and have the best prognosis, with 98% of patients surviving five years; if a Stage I tumor is also grade 1, it can be treated with unilateral surgery only. Stage II though IV tumors make up the remaining quarter of cases and have a worse prognosis, with 73–88% of patients surviving five years.

===== Mature teratoma (dermoid cyst) =====

Mature teratomas, or dermoid cysts, are rare tumors consisting of mostly benign tissue that develop after menopause. The tumors consist of disorganized tissue with nodules of malignant tissue, which can be of various types. The most common malignancy is squamous cell carcinoma, but adenocarcinoma, basal-cell carcinoma, carcinoid tumor, neuroectodermal tumor, malignant melanoma, sarcoma, sebaceous tumor, and struma ovarii can also be part of the dermoid cyst. They are treated with surgery and adjuvant platinum chemotherapy or radiation.

===== Yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor =====

Yolk sac tumors, formerly called endodermal sinus tumors, make up approximately 10–20% of ovarian germ cell malignancies, and have the worst prognosis of all ovarian germ cell tumors. They occur both before menarche (in one-third of cases) and after menarche (the remaining two-thirds of cases). Half of the people with yolk sac tumors are diagnosed in stage I. Typically, they are unilateral until metastasis, which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs. Yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily, and are not easily treatable once they have recurred. Stage I yolk sac tumors are highly treatable, with a 5-year disease-free survival rate of 93%, but stage II-IV tumors are less treatable, with survival rates of 64–91%.

Their gross appearance is solid, friable, and yellow, with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. They also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture. Histologically, yolk sac tumors are characterized by the presence of Schiller-Duval bodies (which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors) and a reticular pattern. Yolk sac tumors commonly secrete alpha-fetoprotein and can be immunohistochemically stained for its presence; the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence.

===== Embryonal carcinoma =====

Embryonal carcinomas, a rare tumor type usually found in mixed tumors, develop directly from germ cells but are not terminally differentiated; in rare cases, they may develop in dysgenetic gonads. They can develop further into a variety of other neoplasms, including choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. They occur in younger people, with an average age at diagnosis of 14, and secrete both alpha-fetoprotein (in 75% of cases) and hCG.

Histologically, embryonal carcinoma appears similar to the embryonic disc, made up of epithelial, anaplastic cells in disorganized sheets, with gland-like spaces and papillary structures.

===== Polyembryoma =====

Polyembryomas, the most immature form of teratoma and very rare ovarian tumors, are histologically characterized by having several embryo-like bodies with structures resembling a germ disk, yolk sac, and amniotic sac. Syncytiotrophoblast giant cells also occur in polyembryomas.

==== Squamous cell carcinoma ====
Primary ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are rare and have a poor prognosis when advanced. More typically, ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are cervical metastases, areas of differentiation in an endometrioid tumor, or derived from a mature teratoma.

==== Mixed tumors ====
Mixed tumors contain elements of more than one of the above classes of tumor histology. To be classed as a mixed tumor, the minor type must make up more than 10% of the tumor. Though mixed carcinomas can have any combination of cell types, mixed ovarian cancers are typically serous/endometrioid or clear-cell/endometrioid. Mixed germ cell tumors make up approximately 25–30% of all germ cell ovarian cancers, with combinations of dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, and/or immature teratoma. The prognosis and treatment vary based on the component cell types.

==== Secondary ovarian cancer ====
Ovarian cancer can also be a secondary cancer, the result of metastasis from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body. About 5–30% of ovarian cancers are due to metastases, while the rest are primary cancers. Common primary cancers are breast cancer, colon cancer, appendiceal cancer, and stomach cancer (primary gastric cancers that metastasize to the ovary are called Krukenberg tumors). Krukenberg tumors have signet ring cells and mucinous cells. Endometrial cancer and lymphomas can also metastasize to the ovary.

==== Borderline tumors ====
Ovarian borderline tumors, sometimes called low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, have some benign and some malignant features. LMP tumors make up approximately 10–15% of all ovarian tumors. They develop earlier than epithelial ovarian cancer, around the age of 40–49. They typically do not have extensive invasion; 10% of LMP tumors have areas of stromal microinvasion (&lt;3mm, &lt;5% of tumor). LMP tumors have other abnormal features, including increased mitosis, changes in cell size or nucleus size, abnormal nuclei, cell stratification, and small projections on cells (papillary projections). Serous and/or mucinous characteristics can be seen on histological examination, and serous histology makes up the overwhelming majority of advanced LMP tumors. More than 80% of LMP tumors are Stage I; 15% are stage II and III and less than 5% are stage IV. Implants of LMP tumors are often non-invasive.

=== Staging ===
Ovarian cancer is staged using the FIGO staging system and uses information obtained after surgery, which can include a total abdominal hysterectomy via midline laparotomy, removal of (usually) both ovaries and Fallopian tubes, (usually) the omentum, pelvic (peritoneal) washings, assessment of retroperitoneal lymph nodes (including the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes), appendectomy in suspected mucinous tumors, and pelvic/peritoneal biopsies for cytopathology. Around 30% of ovarian cancers that appear confined to the ovary have metastasized microscopically, which is why even stage-I cancers must be staged completely. 22% of cancers presumed to be stage I are observed to have lymphatic metastases. The AJCC stage is the same as the FIGO stage. The AJCC staging system describes the extent of the primary tumor (T), the absence or presence of metastasis to nearby lymph nodes (N), and the absence or presence of distant metastasis (M). The most common stage at diagnosis is stage IIIc, with over 70% of diagnoses.

====FIGO====

====AJCC/TNM====
The AJCC/TNM staging system indicates where the tumor has developed, spread to lymph nodes, and metastasis.
The AJCC/TNM stages can be correlated with the FIGO stages:
====Grading====
Grade 1 tumors have well differentiated cells (look very similar to the normal tissue) and are the ones with the best prognosis. Grade 2 tumors are also called moderately well-differentiated and they are made up of cells that resemble the normal tissue. Grade 3 tumors have the worst prognosis and their cells are abnormal, referred to as poorly differentiated.

Metastasis in ovarian cancer is very common in the abdomen and occurs via exfoliation, where cancer cells burst through the ovarian capsule and are able to move freely throughout the peritoneal cavity. Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the lymphatic system and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the infundibulopelvic ligament, the broad ligament, and the round ligament. The most commonly affected groups include the paraaortic, hypogastric, external iliac, obturator, and inguinal lymph nodes. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is a recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.

== Prevention ==
Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with &quot;BRCA&quot; gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.

Because a large fraction of ovarian cancers originate in the fallopian tubes, the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology now recommend that women who are not planning on having additional children and who are undergoing surgical procedures such as tubal ligation (having one&#x27;s &quot;tubes tied&quot;) undergo opportunistic salpingo-oophorectomy — i.e. simultaneously having their fallopian tubes removed. OVCARE — BC Cancer&#x27;s multi-institutional and multidisciplinary ovarian research group — began recommending salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy and in place of tubal ligation in 2010.

Women with a significant family history for ovarian cancer are often referred to a genetic counselor to see if testing for BRCA mutations would be beneficial. The use of oral contraceptives, the absence of &#x27;periods&#x27; during the menstrual cycle, and tubal ligation reduce the risk.
There may an association of developing ovarian cancer and ovarian stimulation during infertility treatments. Endometriosis has been linked to ovarian cancers. Human papillomavirus infection, smoking, and talc have not been identified as increasing the risk for developing ovarian cancer.

== Screening ==
There is no simple and reliable way to test for ovarian cancer in women who do not have any signs or symptoms. Screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks. Women with high risk of ovarian cancer that are currently identified based on family history and genetic testing may benefit from screening. The Pap test does not screen for ovarian cancer.

Ovarian cancer is usually only palpable in advanced stages. This high risk group has benefited with earlier detection. Screening is not recommended using CA-125 measurements, HE4 levels, ultrasound, or adnexal palpation in women who are at average risk. Currently there is no national screening programme in the UK for ovarian cancer. CA125 and transvaginal ultrasound can be utilised but there is minimal evidence to suggest this decreases mortality . More recently, the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROMA) has been shown to detect earlier cancers using CA125 and age but again does not provide a robust measure to decrease mortality at present.

Ovarian cancer has low prevalence, even in the high-risk group of women from the ages of 50 to 60 (about one in 2000), and screening of women with average risk is more likely to give ambiguous results than detect a problem that requires treatment. Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage when it is more likely to be treated successfully.

Screening with transvaginal ultrasound, pelvic examination, and CA-125 levels can be used instead of preventive surgery in women who have BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. This strategy has shown some success.

Screening for CA125, a chemical released by ovarian tumours, with follow-up using ultrasound, was shown to be ineffective in reducing mortality in a large-scale UK study.

There have been some screening trials that have used age, family history of ovarian cancer, and mutation status to identify target populations for screening.

== Management ==
Once it is determined that ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer is present, treatment is scheduled by a gynecologic oncologist (a physician trained to treat cancers of a woman&#x27;s reproductive system). Gynecologic oncologists can perform surgery on and give chemotherapy to women with ovarian cancer. A treatment plan is developed.

Treatment usually involves surgery and chemotherapy, and sometimes radiotherapy, regardless of the subtype of ovarian cancer. Surgical treatment may be sufficient for well-differentiated malignant tumors and confined to the ovary. Addition of chemotherapy may be required for more aggressive tumors confined to the ovary. For patients with advanced disease, a combination of surgical reduction with a combination chemotherapy regimen is standard. Since 1980, platinum-based drugs have had an important role in treating ovarian cancer. Borderline tumors, even following spread outside of the ovary, are managed well with surgery, and chemotherapy is not seen as useful. Second-look surgery and maintenance chemotherapy have not been shown to provide benefit.
=== Surgery ===
Surgery has been the standard of care for decades and may be necessary for obtaining a specimen for diagnosis. The surgery depends upon the extent of nearby invasion of other tissues by the cancer when it is diagnosed. This extent of the cancer is described by assigning it a stage, the presumed type, and the grade of cancer. The gynecological surgeon may remove one (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy). The Fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), uterus (hysterectomy), and the omentum (omentectomy) may also be removed. Typically, all of these organs are removed.

For those who test positive for faulty BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes having a risk-reducing surgery is an option. An increasing number of women choose this. At the same time the average waiting time for undergoing the procedure is two-years which is much longer than recommended.

For low-grade, unilateral stage-IA cancers, only the involved ovary (which must be unruptured) and Fallopian tube will be removed. This can be done especially in young people who wish to preserve their fertility. However, a risk of microscopic metastases exists and staging must be completed. If any metastases are found, a second surgery to remove the remaining ovary and uterus is needed. Tranexamic acid can be administered prior to surgery to reduce the need for blood transfusions due to blood loss during the surgery.

If a tumor in a premenopausal woman is determined to be a low malignant potential tumor during surgery, and it is clearly stage I cancer, only the affected ovary is removed. For postmenopausal women with low malignant potential tumors, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is still the preferred option. During staging, the appendix can be examined or removed. This is particularly important with mucinous tumors. In children or adolescents with ovarian cancer, surgeons typically attempt to preserve one ovary to allow for the completion of puberty, but if the cancer has spread, this is not always possible. Dysgerminomas, in particular, tend to affect both ovaries: 8–15% of dysgerminomas are present in both ovaries. People with low-grade (well-differentiated) tumors are typically treated only with surgery, which is often curative. In general, germ cell tumors can be treated with unilateral surgery unless the cancer is widespread or fertility is not a factor. In women with surgically staged advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages III and IV), studies suggest all attempts should be made to reach complete cytoreduction (surgical efforts to remove the bulk of the tumor).

In advanced cancers, where complete removal is not an option, as much tumor as possible is removed in a procedure called debulking surgery. This surgery is not always successful, and is less likely to be successful in women with extensive metastases in the peritoneum, stage- IV disease, cancer in the transverse fissure of the liver, mesentery, or diaphragm, and large areas of ascites. Debulking surgery has usually only been done once but a recent study has shown a longer overall survival in recurrent ovarian cancer when surgery combined with chemotherapy was performed compared to treatment with chemotherapy alone. Computed tomography (abdominal CT) is often used to assess if primary debulking surgery is possible, but low certainty evidence also suggests fluorodeoxyglucose‐18 (FDG) PET/CT and MRI may be useful as an addition for assessing macroscopic incomplete debulking. More complete debulking is associated with better outcomes: women with no macroscopic evidence of disease after debulking have a median survival of 39 months, as opposed to 17 months with less complete surgery. By removing metastases, many cells that are resistant to chemotherapy are removed, and any clumps of cells that have died are also removed. This allows chemotherapy to better reach the remaining cancer cells, which are more likely to be fast-growing and therefore chemosensitive.

Interval debulking surgery is another protocol used, where neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given, debulking surgery is performed, and chemotherapy is finished after debulking. Though no definitive studies have been completed, it is shown to be approximately equivalent to primary debulking surgery in terms of survival and shows slightly lower morbidity. Previous studies have shown different results from primary debulking versus interval debulking. The ongoing TRUST study may clarify selection criteria for each surgical approach.

There are several different surgical procedures that can be employed to treat ovarian cancer. For stage I and II cancer, laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending on the extent of the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, omentectomy, splenectomy, bowel resection, diaphragm stripping or resection, appendectomy, or even a posterior pelvic exenteration.

To fully stage ovarian cancer, lymphadenectomy can be included in the surgery, However, it has not offered benefits in terms of survival in either HGSOC or LGSOC. This is particularly important in germ cell tumors because they frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes.

If ovarian cancer recurs, secondary surgery is sometimes a treatment option. This depends on how easily the tumor can be removed, how much fluid has accumulated in the abdomen, and overall health. Effectivenes of this surgery depends on surgical technique, completeness of cytoreduction, and extent of disease. It also can be helpful in people who had their first surgery done by a generalist and in epithelial ovarian cancer. Secondary surgery can be effective in dysgerminomas and immature teratomas. Evidence suggests surgery in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer may be associated with prolonging life in some women with platinum-sensitive disease.

The major side effect of oophorectomy in younger women is early menopause, which can cause osteoporosis. After surgery, hormone replacement therapy can be considered, especially in younger women. This therapy can consist of a combination of estrogen and progesterone, or estrogen alone. Estrogen alone is safe after hysterectomy; when the uterus is still present, unopposed estrogen dramatically raises the risk of endometrial cancer. Estrogen therapy after surgery does not change survival rates. People having ovarian cancer surgery are typically hospitalized afterwards for 3–4 days and spend around a month recovering at home. Surgery outcomes are best at hospitals that do a large number of ovarian cancer surgeries.

It is unclear if laparoscopy or laparotomy is better or worse for FIGO stage I ovarian cancer. There is also no apparent difference between total abdominal hysterectomy and supracervical hysterectomy for advanced cancers. Approximately 2.8% of people having a first surgery for advanced ovarian cancer die within two weeks of the surgery (2.8% perioperative mortality rate). More aggressive surgeries are associated with better outcomes in advanced (stage III or IV) ovarian cancer.

=== Chemotherapy ===
Chemotherapy has been a general standard of care for ovarian cancer for decades, although with variable protocols. Chemotherapy is used after surgery to treat any residual disease, if appropriate. In some cases, there may be reason to perform chemotherapy first, followed by surgery. This is called &quot;neoadjuvant chemotherapy&quot;, and is common when a tumor cannot be completely removed or optimally debulked via surgery. Though it has not been shown to increase survival, it can reduce the risk of complications after surgery. If a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or other surgery is performed, additional chemotherapy, called &quot;adjuvant chemotherapy&quot;, can be given. Adjuvant chemotherapy is used in stage 1 cancer typically if the tumor is of a high histologic grade (grade 3) or the highest substage (stage 1c), provided the cancer has been optimally staged during surgery. Bevacizumab may be used as an adjuvant chemotherapy if the tumor is not completely removed during surgery or if the cancer is stage IV; it can extend progression-free survival but has not been shown to extend overall survival. Chemotherapy is curative in approximately 20% of advanced ovarian cancers; it is more often curative with malignant germ cell tumors than epithelial tumors. Adjuvant chemotherapy has been found to improve survival and reduce the risk of ovarian cancer recurring compared to no adjuvant therapy in women with early stage epithelial ovarian cancer.

Chemotherapy in ovarian cancer typically consists of platins, a group of platinum-based drugs, combined with non-platins. Platinum-based drugs have been used since 1980. Common therapies can include paclitaxel, cisplatin, topotecan, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and gemcitabine. Carboplatin is typically given in combination with either paclitaxel or docetaxel; the typical combination is carboplatin with paclitaxel. Carboplatin is superior to cisplatin in that it is less toxic and has fewer side effects, generally allowing for an improved quality of life in comparison, though both are similarly effective. Three-drug regimens have not been found to be more effective, and platins alone or nonplatins alone are less effective than platins and nonplatins in combination. There is a small benefit in platinum‐based chemotherapy compared with non‐platinum therapy. Platinum combinations can offer improved survival over single platinum. In people with relapsed ovarian cancer, evidence suggests topotecan has a similar effect on overall survival as paclitaxel and topotecan plus thalidomide, whilst it is superior to treosulfan and not as effective as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in platinum-sensitive people.

Chemotherapy can be given intravenously or in the peritoneal cavity. Though intraperitoneal chemotherapy is associated with longer progression-free survival and overall survival, it also causes more adverse side effects than intravenous chemotherapy. It is mainly used when the cancer has been optimally debulked. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy can be highly effective because ovarian cancer mainly spreads inside the peritoneal cavity, and higher doses of the drugs can reach the tumors this way.

Chemotherapy can cause anemia; intravenous iron has been found to be more effective than oral iron supplements in reducing the need for blood transfusions. Typical cycles of treatment involve one treatment every 3 weeks, repeated for 6 weeks or more. Fewer than 6 weeks (cycles) of treatment is less effective than 6 weeks or more. Germ-cell malignancies are treated differently than other ovarian cancers — a regimen of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) is used with 5 days of chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 3 to 4 cycles. Chemotherapy for germ cell tumors has not been shown to cause amenorrhea, infertility, birth defects, or miscarriage. Maintenance chemotherapy has not been shown to be effective.

In people with &quot;BRCA&quot; mutations, platinum chemotherapy is more effective. Germ-cell tumors and malignant sex-cord/stromal tumors are treated with chemotherapy, though dysgerminomas and sex-cord tumors are not typically very responsive.

====Platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant==== 
If ovarian cancer recurs, it is considered partially platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant, based on the time since the last recurrence treated with platins: partially platinum-sensitive cancers recurred 6–12 months after last treatment, and platinum-resistant cancers have an interval of less than 6 months. Second-line chemotherapy can be given after the cancer becomes symptomatic because no difference in survival is seen between treating asymptomatic (elevated CA-125) and symptomatic recurrences.

For platinum-sensitive tumors, platins are the drugs of choice for second-line chemotherapy, in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Regimens include carboplatin combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel. Carboplatin-doublet therapy can be combined with paclitaxel for increased efficacy in some cases. Another potential adjuvant therapy for platinum-sensitive recurrences is olaparib, which may improve progression-free survival but has not been shown to improve overall survival. (Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA for use in BRCA-associated ovarian cancer that had previously been treated with chemotherapy.) For recurrent germ cell tumors, an additional 4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for those who have been treated with surgery or platins.

If the tumor is determined to be platinum-resistant, vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) or some combination of paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin may be used as a second-line therapy.

For platinum-resistant tumors, there are no high-efficacy chemotherapy options. Single-drug regimens (doxorubicin or topotecan) do not have high response rates, but single-drug regimens of topotecan, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or gemcitabine are used in some cases. Topotecan cannot be used in people with an intestinal blockage. Paclitaxel used alone is another possible regimen, or it may be combined with liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cisplatin, topotecan, etoposide, or cyclophosphamide. ( See also Palliative care below.)

Novel agents are being developed to inhibit the development of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) for women with ovarian cancer who develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs. As of 2023 there would appear to be a role for these treatments but due to the additional treatment burden and cost of maintenance treatments the risk versus benefits require careful consideration.

Novocure sponsored a phase-2 trial proving efficacy of tumor treating fields in recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma, in conjunction with weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy.

=== Radiation therapy ===
Dysgerminomas are most effectively treated with radiation, though this can cause infertility and is being phased out in favor of chemotherapy. Radiation therapy does not improve survival in people with well-differentiated tumors.

In stage 1c and 2 cancers, radiation therapy is used after surgery if there is the possibility of residual disease in the pelvis but the abdomen is cancer-free. Radiotherapy can also be used in palliative care of advanced cancers. A typical course of radiotherapy for ovarian cancer is 5 days a week for 3–4 weeks.

Common side effects of radiotherapy include diarrhea, constipation, and frequent urination. Radiotherapy late effects (and occurrence rates) include osteonecrosis (8-20%), bladder ulceration (&lt;3%), vaginal stenosis (&gt;2.5%) and irreversible lumbosacral plexopathy.

=== Hormonal therapy ===
Despite the fact that 60% of ovarian tumors have estrogen receptors, ovarian cancer is only rarely responsive to hormonal treatments. A Cochrane review found a lack of evidence about the effects of tamoxifen in people with relapsed ovarian cancer. Estrogen alone does not have an effect on the cancer, and tamoxifen and letrozole are rarely effective. &quot;Some women with borderline malignancy ovarian cancer and stromal ovarian cancer may receive hormonal therapy.&quot;

=== Immunotherapy ===
Immunotherapy is a topic of current research in ovarian cancer. In some cases, the antibody drug bevacizumab, though still a topic of active research, is used to treat advanced cancer along with chemotherapy. It has been approved for this use in the European Union.

=== Follow-up ===
Specific follow-up depends on, for example, the type and stage of ovarian cancer, the treatment, and the presence of any symptoms. Usually, a check-up appointment is made about every 2 to 3 months initially, followed by twice per year for up to 5 years. For epithelial ovarian cancers, the most common test upon follow-up is CA-125 level. However, treatment based only on elevated CA-125 levels and not any symptoms can increase side effects without any prolongation of life, so the implication of the outcome of a CA-125 test can be discussed before taking it. The recommendation as of 2014 is recurrent cancer may be present if the CA-125 level is twice normal. Treating a recurrence detected by CA-125 does not improve survival.

For women with germ-cell tumors, follow-up tests generally include alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and/or human chorionic gonadotropin. For women with stromal cancers, tests for hormones like estrogen, testosterone, and inhibin are sometimes helpful. Inhibin can also be useful for monitoring the progress of sex-cord tumors, along with Müllerian inhibiting substance. AFP can also be used to monitor Sertoli-Leydig tumors. In dysgerminomas, lactate dehydrogenase and its two isozymes (LDH-1 and LDH-2) are used to test for recurrence.

Women with ovarian cancer may not need routine surveillance imaging to monitor the cancer unless new symptoms appear or tumor markers begin rising. Imaging without these indications is discouraged because it is unlikely to detect a recurrence, improve survival, and because it has its own costs and side effects. However, CT imaging can be used if desired, though this is not common. If a tumor is easily imaged, imaging may be used to monitor the progress of treatment.

=== Palliative care ===
Palliative care focuses on relieving symptoms and increasing or maintaining quality of life. This type of treatment&#x27;s purpose is not to cure the cancer but to make the woman more comfortable while living with cancer that can not be cured. It has been recommended as part of the treatment plan for any person with advanced ovarian cancer or patients with significant symptoms. In platinum-refractory and platinum-resistant cases, other palliative chemotherapy is the main treatment.

Palliative care can entail treatment of symptoms and complications of the cancer, including pain, nausea, constipation, ascites, bowel obstruction, edema, pleural effusion, and mucositis. Especially if the cancer advances and becomes incurable, treatment of symptoms becomes one of the main goals of therapy. Palliative care can also entail helping with decision-making such as if or when hospice care is appropriate, and the preferred place for the patient at end of life care.

Bowel obstruction can be treated with palliative surgery (colostomy, ileostomy, or internal bypass) or medicine, but surgery has been shown to increase survival time. Palliative surgery may result in short bowel syndrome, enterocutaneous fistula, or re-obstruction; or may not be possible due to the extent of obstruction. Other treatments of complications can include total parenteral nutrition, a low-residue diet, palliative gastrostomy, and adequate pain control. Bowel obstruction can also be treated with octreotide when palliative surgery is not an option. Cancer can also block the ureters, which can be relieved by a nephrostomy or a ureteric stent. Ascites can be relieved by repeated paracentesis or placement of a drain to increase comfort. Pleural effusions can be treated in a similar manner, with repeated thoracentesis, pleurodesis, or placement of a drain.

Radiation therapy can be used as part of the palliative care of advanced ovarian cancer, since it can help to shrink tumors that are causing symptoms. Palliative radiotherapy typically lasts for only a few treatments, a much shorter course of therapy than non-palliative radiotherapy. It is also used for palliation of chemotherapy-resistant germ cell tumors.

=== Psychosocial care ===
Ovarian cancer has a significant effect on quality of life, psychological health and well-being. Interventions are available to help with the needs and social support. Many ovarian cancer survivors report a good quality of life and optimism. Others reported a &quot;spiritual change&quot; that helped them find meaning during their experience. Others have described their loss of faith after their diagnosis with ovarian cancer. Those who have gone through treatment sometimes experience social isolation but benefit from having relationships with other survivors. Frustration and guilt have been described by some who have expressed their inability to care for their family.

Self-esteem and body image changes can occur due to hair loss, removal of ovaries and other reproductive structures, and scars. There is some improvement after hair grows in. Sexual issues can develop. The removal of ovaries results in surgically induced menopause that can result in painful intercourse, vaginal dryness, loss of sexual desire and being tired. Though prognosis is better for younger survivors, the impact on sexuality can still be substantial.

Anxiety, depression and distress is present in those surviving ovarian cancer at higher rates than in the general population. The same psychosocial problems can develop in family members. Emotional effects can include a fear of death, sadness, memory problems and difficulty in concentrating. When optimism was adopted by those at the beginning of their treatment, they were less likely to develop distress. Those who have fear of the cancer recurring may have difficulty in expressing joy even when disease-free. The more treatments that a woman undergoes, the more likely the loss of hope is expressed. Women often can cope and reduce negative psychosocial effects by a number of strategies. Activities such as traveling, spending additional time with family and friends, ignoring statistics, journaling and increasing involvement in spiritually-based events are adaptive.

Women with ovarian cancer may also experience difficulties with their diet and are at risk of malnutrition.

== Prognosis ==

Ovarian cancer usually has a relatively poor prognosis. It is disproportionately deadly because it lacks any clear early detection or screening test, meaning most cases are not diagnosed until they have reached advanced stages.

Ovarian cancer metastasizes early in its development, often before it has been diagnosed. High-grade tumors metastasize more readily than low-grade tumors. Typically, tumor cells begin to metastasize by growing in the peritoneal cavity. More than 60% of women presenting with ovarian cancer have stage-III or stage-IV cancer, when it has already spread beyond the ovaries. Ovarian cancers shed cells into the naturally occurring fluid within the abdominal cavity. These cells can then implant on other abdominal (peritoneal) structures, including the uterus, urinary bladder, bowel, lining of the bowel wall, and omentum, forming new tumor growths before cancer is even suspected.

The five-year survival rate for all stages of ovarian cancer is 46%; the one-year survival rate is 72% and the ten-year survival rate is 35%. For cases where a diagnosis is made early in the disease, when the cancer is still confined to the primary site, the five-year survival rate is 92.7%. About 70% of women with advanced disease respond to initial treatment, most of whom attain complete remission, but half of these women experience a recurrence 1–4 years after treatment. Brain metastasis is more common in stage III/IV cancer but can still occur in cancers staged at I/II. People with brain metastases survive a median of 8.2 months, though surgery, chemotherapy, and whole brain radiation therapy can improve survival.

Ovarian cancer survival varies significantly with subtype. Dysgerminomas have a very favorable prognosis. In early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%. Around two-thirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage I. Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, even those with metastatic disease can survive a decade or more. Low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.

Complications of ovarian cancer can include spread of the cancer to other organs, progressive function loss of various organs, ascites, and intestinal obstructions, which can be fatal. Intestinal obstructions in multiple sites are the most common proximate cause of death. Intestinal obstruction in ovarian cancer can either be a true obstruction, where tumor blocks the intestinal lumen, or a pseudo-obstruction, when tumor prevents normal peristalsis. Continuous accumulation of ascites can be treated by placing a drain that can be self-drained.

=== Prognostic factors ===
There are a number of prognostic factors in ovarian cancer. Positive prognostic factors – those indicating better chances of survival – include no residual disease after surgery (stage III/IV), complete macroscopic resection (stage IV), BRCA2 mutations, young age (under 45 years), nonserous type, low histologic grade, early stage, co-occurrence with endometrial cancer, and low CA-125 levels. There is conflicting evidence for BRCA1 as a prognostic factor. Conversely, negative prognostic factors – those that indicate a worse chance of survival – include rupture of the ovarian capsule during surgery, older age (over 45 years), mucinous type, stage IV, high histologic grade, clear-cell type, upper abdominal involvement, high CA-125 levels, the presence of tumor cells in the blood, and elevated cyclooxygenase-2.

Expression of various mRNAs can also be prognostic for ovarian cancer. High levels of Drosha and Dicer are associated with improved survival, whereas high levels of let-7b, HIF1A, EphA1, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase are associated with worse survival. Cancers that are positive for WT1 carry a worse prognosis; estrogen-receptor positive cancers have a better prognosis.

=== Survival rates ===
Overall five-year survival rates for all types of ovarian cancer are presented below by stage and histologic grade:


The survival rates given below are for the different types of ovarian cancer, according to American Cancer Society. They come from the National Cancer Institute, SEER, and are based on patients diagnosed from 2004 to 2010.





=== Recurrence rates ===

Ovarian cancer frequently recurs after treatment. Overall, in a 5-year period, 20% of stage I and II cancers recur. Most recurrences are in the abdomen. If a recurrence occurs in advanced disease, it typically occurs within 18 months of initial treatment (18 months progression-free survival). Recurrences can be treated, but the disease-free interval tends to shorten and chemoresistance increases with each recurrence. When a dysgerminoma recurs, it is most likely to recur within a year of diagnosis, and other malignant germ cell tumors recur within 2 years 90% of the time. Germ cell tumors other than dysgerminomas have a poor prognosis when they relapse, with a 10% long-term survival rate. Low malignant potential tumors rarely relapse, even when fertility-sparing surgery is the treatment of choice. 15% of LMP tumors relapse after unilateral surgery in the previously unaffected ovary, and they are typically easily treated with surgery. More advanced tumors may take up to 20 years to relapse, if they relapse at all, and are only treated with surgery unless the tumor has changed its histological characteristics or grown very quickly. In these cases, and when there is significant ascites, chemotherapy may also be used. Relapse is usually indicated by rising CA-125 levels and then progresses to symptomatic relapse within 2–6 months. Recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors are typically unresponsive to treatment but not aggressive.

It is the most deadly gynecologic cancer.

==Epidemiology==

Globally, in 2018, the incidence of ovarian cancer was 6.6 per 100,000 and mortality was 3.9. Globally, about 160,000 people died from ovarian cancer in 2010. This was an increase from 113,000 in 1990. The number of new cases per year in Europe is approximately 5–15 per 100,000 women. In Europe, Lithuania, Latvia, Ireland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic have the highest incidences of ovarian cancer, whereas Portugal and Cyprus have the lowest incidences. In 2008, the five-year survival rate was 44%. This has increased since 1977 when the survival rate was 36%.

===United States===
In 2022, in the United States, an estimated 19,880 new cases were diagnosed and 12,810 women died of ovarian cancer. The 5-year relative survival rate is 49.7%. Around 57% cases have metastasized at the time of diagnosis.

In 2014, over 220,000 diagnoses of epithelial ovarian cancer were made yearly. The overall lifetime risk in the US is around 1.6% In the US, ovarian cancer affects 1.3–1.4% and is the cause of death of about 1% of women. In the United States, it is also the fifth-most common cancer in women but the fourth-most common cause of cancer death. This decrease made it the ninth-most common cancer in women.

The risks from developing specific types of ovarian cancer varies. Germ cell tumors and sex cord-stromal tumors are less common than epithelial tumors. The number of new cases a year in the US is 0.4 per 100,000 women and 0.2 per 100,000 women, respectively. In young people, sex-cord stromal tumors and germ cell tumors total 1% of overall ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer represents approximately 4% of cancers diagnosed in women.

===United Kingdom===
It is the 5th-most common cancer in UK women (around 7,100 were diagnosed in 2011) and the 5th-most common cause of cancer death in women (around 4,300 died in 2012). The incidence rate over the whole UK population is 21.6 per 100,000.

As of 2014, the UK saw approximately 7,000–7,100 yearly diagnoses with 4,200 deaths. A 2022 article from &quot;The Times&quot; put the estimate at 7,500 new cases yearly in Britain. Early symptoms are often mistaken for common conditions such as cystitis or irritable bowel syndrome, and about 40 per cent of UK women wrongly believe that cervical screening detects ovarian cancer, an increase from 30 per cent in 2016. 

===Ethnicity===

Black women have twice the risk for sex cord-stromal tumors compared to non-Black women. The highest prevalence is in Caucasian and Hispanic women, followed by African-American and Asian women. The highest mortality from ovarian cancer is in African-American women. Ashkenazi Jewish women carry mutated &quot;BRCA&quot; alleles five times more often than the rest of the population, giving them a higher risk developing ovarian cancer.

===Older women===
In the US, the incidence rate in women over 50 is approximately 33 per 100,000. The rate of ovarian cancer between 1993 and 2008 decreased in women of the 40–49 age cohort and in the 50–64 age cohort. Ovarian cancer is most commonly diagnosed after menopause, between the ages of 60 and 64. Ninety percent of ovarian cancer occurs in women over the age of 45 and 80% in women over 50. Older women are more likely to present with advanced ovarian cancer.

== In pregnancy ==
Malignant germ cell tumors are the type of ovarian cancer most likely to occur during pregnancy. They are typically diagnosed when an adnexal mass is found on examination (in 1–2% of all pregnancies), a tumor is seen on ultrasound, or the parent&#x27;s level of alpha-fetoprotein is elevated. Dermoid cysts and dysgerminomas are the most common germ cell tumors during pregnancy. Germ cell tumors diagnosed during pregnancy are unlikely to have metastasized and can be treated by surgery and, in some cases, chemotherapy, which carries the risk of birth defects. Yolk sac tumors and immature teratomas grow particularly quickly and are usually treated with chemotherapy even during pregnancy; however, dysgerminomas that have been optimally debulked may be treated after childbirth.

== Other animals ==
Ovarian tumors have been reported in equine mares. Reported tumor types include teratoma, cystadenocarcinoma, and particularly granulosa cell tumor.

== Research ==
===Screening===
Screening by hysteroscopy to obtain cell samples obtained for histological examination is being developed. This is similar to the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening is testing a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound. Other studies suggest that this screening procedure may be effective. Although results published in 2015 were not conclusive, there was some evidence that screening may save lives in the long-term. As a result, the trial has been extended and will publish definitive results at the end of 2019. One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery. The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population. Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.

Researchers from BGI Genomics and Fudan University have uncovered significant findings on ovarian cancer (OV) in Chinese patients, revealing a unique RAD51D variant that may serve as a therapeutic target. Published in &quot;&quot;, the study identified an enriched RAD51D variant associated with tumor growth promotion. Notably, the RAD51D K91fs variant was found to increase sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib and niraparib, offering new treatment avenues. 

===Prognosis research===
Research into various prognostic factors for ovarian cancer is also going on. Recent research shows that thrombocytosis predicts lower survival and higher stage cancer. Ongoing research is also investigating the benefits of surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer.

===Immunotherapy===
While an active area of research, as of 2018 there is no good evidence that immunotherapy is effective for ovarian cancer. However, trials of the antibody and VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab, which can slow the growth of new blood vessels in the cancer, have shown promising results, especially in combination with pazopanib, which also slows the process of blood vessel growth. Bevacizumab has been particularly effective in preliminary studies on stage-III and -IV cancer and has been cited as having at least a 15% response rate. It is being investigated particularly in mucinous ovarian cancers.

===Pharmacology===
mTOR inhibitors were a highly investigated potential treatment in the 2000s and 2010s, but the side effects of these drugs (particularly hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia) were not well tolerated and the survival benefit not confirmed. PI3 kinase inhibitors have been of interest, but they tend to be highly toxic and cause diarrhea. Another investigated drug is selumetinib, a MAPK inhibitor. It improved survival, but did not correlate with any mutations found in tumors.

Bevacizumab can also be combined with platinum chemotherapy, a combination that has had positive preliminary results in PFS, but equivocal results regarding overall survival. One disadvantage to these treatments is the side effect profile, which includes high blood pressure and proteinuria. The drug can also exacerbate bowel disease, leading to fistulae or bowel perforation. Vintafolide, which consists of an antifolate conjugated with vinblastine, is also in clinical trials; it may prove beneficial because folate receptors are overexpressed in many ovarian cancers. Another potential immunotherapy is trastuzumab, which is active against tumors positive for Her2/neu mutations. Other angiogenesis inhibitors are also being investigated as potential ovarian cancer treatments. Combretastatin and pazopanib are being researched in combination for recurrent ovarian cancer. Trebananib and tasquinimod are other angiogenesis inhibitors being investigated. The monoclonal antibody farletuzumab is being researched as an adjuvant to traditional chemotherapy. Another type of immunotherapy involves vaccines, including TroVax.

An alternative to BEP chemotherapy, a regimen of 3 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide, is a current topic of research for germ cell malignancies.

Intraperitoneal chemotherapy has also been under investigation during the 2000s and 2010s for its potential to deliver higher doses of cytotoxic agent to tumors. Preliminary trials with cisplatin and paclitaxel have shown it is not well tolerated, but does improve survival, and more tolerable regimens are being researched. Cisplatin and paclitaxel are both being researched as intraperitoneal chemotherapy agents. A specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clear-cell cancers is also under investigation: irinotecan combined with cisplatin.

PARP inhibitors have also shown promise in early trials, particularly in people with &quot;BRCA&quot; gene mutations, since the BRCA protein interacts with the PARP pathway. It is also being studied in recurrent ovarian cancer in general, where preliminary studies have shown longer PFS. Specifically, olaparib has shown greater survival compared to doxorubicin, though this treatment is still being investigated. It is not clear yet which biomarkers are predictive of responsiveness to PARP inhibitors. Rucaparib is another PARP inhibitor being researched in BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative recurrent advanced ovarian cancer. Niraparib is a PARP inhibitor being tested in BRCA-positive recurrent ovarian cancer.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are another investigational drug class that may have applications in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor group, including pazopanib, cediranib, and nintedanib, have also been shown to increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015. Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3–4 months and increased survival by 3 months. MK-1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. Nintedanib is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are another area of research.

===Hormones and radiation===
Hormone therapies are a topic of current research in ovarian cancer, particularly, the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer. These include tamoxifen, letrozole, and anastrozole. Preliminary studies have showed a benefit for tamoxifen in a small number of people with advanced ovarian cancer. Letrozole may help to slow or stop growth of estrogen receptor positive ovarian cancer. Anastrozole is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptor-positive cancer.

Research into mitigating side effects of ovarian cancer treatment is also ongoing. Radiation fibrosis, the formation of scar tissue in an area treated with radiation, may be relieved with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but research has not been completed in this area. Treatment of ovarian cancer may also cause people to experience psychiatric difficulties, including depression. Research is ongoing to determine how counseling and psychotherapy can help people who have ovarian cancer during treatment.

===Inflammation===

There are some indications that pelvic inflammatory disease may be associated with ovarian cancer, especially in non-western countries. It may be due to the inflammatory process present with pelvic inflammatory disease.

===Clinical trials===
Clinical trials are monitored and funded by US governmental organizations to test treatment options to see if they are safe and effective. These include NIH Clinical Research Trials and You (National Institutes of Health), Learn About Clinical Trials (National Cancer Institute), Search for Clinical Trials (National Cancer Institute), ClinicalTrials.gov (National Institutes of Health). Clinical trials are also conducted in Canada.

It came into being in 1999 as the successor institution to the former Radcliffe College, originally a women&#x27;s college connected with Harvard.

The institute comprises three programs:

* The Radcliffe Institute Fellowship Program is a highly selective fellowship that supports the work of 50 artists and scholars each year. 
* The Academic Ventures program is for collaborative research projects and hosts lectures and conferences. 
* The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America documents the lives of American women of the past and present for the future.

The Radcliffe Institute often hosts public events, many of which can be watched online. It is a member of the Some Institutes for Advanced Study consortium. Prof. Tomiko Brown-Nagin is the institute&#x27;s current dean.

==History==
===20th century===
The Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study was founded in 1961 by the then-president of Radcliffe College, Mary Bunting, who sought to stem the exodus of highly trained and educated women from promising careers. The institute provided stipends as well as access to all of the resources of Harvard University to take up their chosen creative intellectual studies. The initial funding for the institute came from the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations. The institute was renamed the Bunting Institute in 1978; its grants expanded to support women wishing to pursue advanced degrees on a part-time basis.

The current institute came into being by the agreement of October 1, 1999, under which Radcliffe College merged with Harvard University. Long before this date, the focus of Radcliffe had already begun to shift: undergraduate women had attended classes with Harvard men since 1943, received Harvard degrees signed by both Harvard and Radcliffe presidents since 1963, and lived in integrated dormitories with Harvard men since 1971.

===21st century===
In 2001, the first professorship at the institute was established with the Carol K. Pforzheimer Professorship at Radcliffe. The professorship was endowed by the Pforzheimer family, who also endowed the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Directorship and the Carol K. Pforzheimer Student Fellowships at the institute&#x27;s Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, which, with the Radcliffe Institute Fellowship Program, both of which date back to Radcliffe College days, are among the institute&#x27;s best-known features.

As the college became an institute, Mary Maples Dunn served as acting president of Radcliffe College and acting dean of the Radcliffe Institute. On January 1, 2001, Drew Gilpin Faust became the institute&#x27;s first permanent dean; she stepped down in July 2007 to become president of Harvard University. Barbara J. Grosz, Higgins Professor of Natural Sciences at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, served as interim dean after Faust&#x27;s departure and was named dean on April 28, 2008; she stepped down in June 2011. After serving as interim dean from 2011 to 2012, Lizabeth Cohen became dean. A historian, Cohen stepped down on June 30, 2018, to return to research, writing, and teaching.

==Schlesinger Library==

The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America exists to document women&#x27;s lives and endeavors. Its wealth of resources reveals the wide range of women&#x27;s activities at home in the United States and abroad from the early 19th century to the present day. The library&#x27;s holdings include manuscripts; books and periodicals; and photographic and audiovisual material.

There are more than 2,500 unique manuscript collections from individuals, families, and organizations. Women&#x27;s rights movements past and present, feminism, health and sexuality, social reform, and the education of women and girls are manuscript holdings. Ordinary lives of women and families and the struggles and triumphs of women of accomplishment are richly documented in diaries and other personal records. Many collections, such as the papers of Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Pauli Murray, and the records of the National Organization for Women, feature political, organizational, and economic questions. In addition to these collections, the library also houses the personal papers of Susan B. Anthony, Amelia Earhart, Betty Friedan, Adrienne Rich, and many others.

Books and Periodicals: More than 80,000 printed volumes include scholarly monographs as well as popular works. These cover topics including women&#x27;s rights; women and work; women&#x27;s health; women of color; comparative material about women in other cultures; works on women in the arts and in music; women and family; feminist and anti-feminist theory; and lesbian writings. Hundreds of periodical titles, including popular magazines such as &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, &quot;Ebony&quot;, and &quot;Seventeen&quot;, highlight domestic concerns, leisure pursuits, etiquette, fashion, and food.

Photographic and Audiovisual Material: More than 90,000 photographs, ranging from casual snapshots to the works of professional photographers, create an unparalleled visual record of private and public life. Audiotapes, videotapes and oral history tapes, and transcripts add the soundtrack to the story of women&#x27;s lives.

The library has two distinguished special collections. A culinary collection of more than 15,000 books—spanning five centuries and global cuisines—is one of the world&#x27;s most significant. This collection also includes the papers of several famous chefs and food writers, such as M. F. K. Fisher, Julia Child, and Elizabeth David. The Radcliffe College Archives, 1879–1999—including papers of college officers, students, and alumnae—record the history of women in higher education.

While its focus for collecting is American women, the library has an abundance of print and manuscript materials bearing on issues around the globe as a result of American women&#x27;s extensive travel and foreign residence. Some examples are letters of early missionaries in China, activists&#x27; accounts of the Women&#x27;s Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice, and the speeches and writings of Shirley Graham Du Bois.

Detailed records for the library&#x27;s manuscript collections as well as books and periodicals can be found in HOLLIS. The catalog record gives a description of the item or collection and provides other important information such as offsite location or access restrictions.

==Radcliffe Institute Fellowship Program==

Radcliffe Institute fellowships are designed to support scholars, scientists, artists, and writers of exceptional promise and demonstrated accomplishments who wish to pursue work in academic and professional fields and in the creative arts.

The Radcliffe Institute Fellowship Program was founded at Radcliffe College in 1961 as the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study. In 1978, the institute was renamed the Mary Ingraham Bunting Institute to honor Radcliffe College President Mary Bunting, whose initiative it was to create a postgraduate study center for female scholars and artists. Concerned about the prevailing &quot;climate of unexpectation&quot; for women at that time, Bunting deliberately sought to reverse that negative attitude by establishing the essential gifts of an Institute fellowship: time, financial support, a room of one&#x27;s own, membership in a vital community of women, and access to all Radcliffe and Harvard resources.

Once Bunting&#x27;s idea was made public and the announcement appeared on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in the fall of 1960, more than 2,000 women inquired about the &quot;experiment&quot;. The outpouring of interest confirmed President Bunting&#x27;s hunch—that a growing number of educated women were ready to resume intellectual or artistic work after raising families.

From 1960 to 2000, more than 1,300 scholars, scientists, artists, writers, and musicians have been named fellows. &quot;The Boston Globe Magazine&quot; called the Bunting Institute &quot;America&#x27;s Think Tank for Women&quot;, and the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; described the institute as a place where &quot;lives get turned around, books get written, and discoveries are made, all the result of time spent among intellectual peers.&quot;

Including the 2017–2018 academic year, the Radcliffe Institute Fellowship Program has hosted around 900 women and men of exceptional promise working on projects across the arts, humanities, sciences, and social sciences. For the 2017–2018 fellowship class, the acceptance rate was only 4 percent.

Research clusters at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study use the Radcliffe Fellowship Program to draw together scholars to focus on particular themes. Previous cluster topics include unconscious prejudice and the law, immigration, randomness and computation, and cosmology and theoretical astrophysics.

The program is currently run out of Byerly Hall, one of the historic buildings in Radcliffe Yard.

<text>Oswalt Kolle (2 October 1928 in Kiel – 24 September 2010 in Amsterdam) was a German-Dutch sex educator, who became famous during the late 1960s and early 1970s for his numerous pioneering books and films on human sexuality. His work was translated into all major languages, while his films found an audience of 140 million worldwide. In his 1997 book &quot;Open to Both Sides&quot; he came out as bisexual.

He was awarded the Magnus Hirschfeld Medal in 2000.

He had lived in the relatively more sexually liberal city of Amsterdam, Netherlands since the 1970s with his three children to escape harassment of his family by conservative German journalists, and was also a Dutch citizen. His wife died in 2000.

<text>Gary &quot;Gedde&quot; Watanabe (; born June 26, 1955) is an American actor. He is known for voicing the character of Ling in the animated film &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998) and its sequel &quot;Mulan II&quot; (2004), as well as playing Long Duk Dong in the film &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; (1984) and Takahara &quot;Kaz&quot; Kazihiro in &quot;Gung Ho&quot; (1986), and Nurse Yosh Takata in the NBC medical drama &quot;ER&quot; from 1997 to 2003. He was also an original cast member of the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Watanabe was born and raised in Ogden, Utah, in a Japanese-American family. His mother worked as a seamstress at the Utah Tailoring Company. He performed in several dramatic productions in high school, both acting and singing. After graduation, Watanabe relocated to San Francisco, where he worked as a street musician while honing his acting skills.

==Career==
In 1976, Watanabe&#x27;s first role was as a member of the original Broadway cast of &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot;, originating the roles of Priest, Girl, and The Boy. He has since appeared in a number of films and television series, the first of which was &quot;The Long Island Four&quot; in 1980.

Many of his roles are caricatured East Asians with heavy accents, though he himself does not speak Japanese.

He had a starring role in both the film &quot;Gung Ho&quot; and its television spinoff. In the 1989 movie &quot;UHF&quot; starring &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, Watanabe co-starred as Kuni, a karate instructor and abusive host of a TV game show called &quot;Wheel of Fish&quot;. He later reprised this role on the &quot;Weird Al Show&quot;. Watanabe appeared on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; from 1988 to 1991 as Hiroshi and had a recurring role as gay nurse Yosh Takata on the television drama from 1997 to 2003. During the nineties, Watanabe studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, with Chris Aable, who introduced him to fellow actors Jon Cedar and Steve Burton. He voiced various Japanese characters on the animated television comedy &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In 1998, he voiced Ling in the Disney animated film &quot;Mulan&quot; and reprised the role for the 2004 direct-to-video sequel &quot;Mulan II&quot; and the 2005 video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;.

<text>Lüshunkou District (also Lyushunkou District; ) is a district of Dalian, Liaoning province, China. The district&#x27;s area is and its permanent population is 398,579.

Lüshunkou is located at the extreme southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula. It has a natural harbor, the possession and control of which became a &quot;casus belli&quot; of the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05). Japanese and then Russian administration was established in 1895 and continued until 1905 when control was ceded to Japan. During that period, it was world-famous and was more significant than the other port on the peninsula, Dalian proper.

Also formerly called Lüshun City () or literally [[Lüshun Port]] (), it was formerly known as both Port Arthur () and Ryojun ().

==Toponym==
In English-language diplomatic, news, and historical writings, it was known as Port Arthur after a British Royal Navy Lieutenant named William Arthur who surveyed the harbor in the gunboat HMS &quot;Algerine&quot; in 1860.

During the period when the Japanese Empire controlled and administered the Liaodong (formerly Liaotung) Peninsula it was called , the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese characters in the city&#x27;s name. After the Japanese defeat in World War II, the city was under the administration of the Soviet Union, which rented the port from China, until 1950. Although the Soviets presented the port to the new People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1950, Soviet Armed Forces troops remained in the city until 1955.

==Geography==

Central Dalian is some farther up the coast, sprawling around the narrowest neck of the Liaodong Peninsula (), whereas Lüshun occupies its southern tip. (See Landsat Map below Zoomed – Lüshun City surrounds the lake-like structure clearly visible near the peninsular tip—the lake-like feature is the inner natural harbour of the port, a very well-sheltered and fortifiable harbour to 19th century eyes.)

The Liaodong Peninsula is located northwest in relation to Korea, the Yellow Sea to its southeast, the Korea Bay to its due east, and the Bohai Sea (or Gulf) to its west. Beijing is almost directly (due west-northwest) across the Bo Hai Gulf from the port city.

==History==

In the late 1880s, the German company Krupp was contracted by the Qing dynasty to build a series of fortifications around Port Arthur. Reportedly, this was after local contractors had &quot;made an extensive bungle of the job&quot;.

Port Arthur first came into international prominence during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895). Following Japan&#x27;s victory over the Imperial Chinese Army troops at the Battle of Pyongyang in Korea in September 1894, the Japanese First and Second Armies converged on the Liaodong Peninsula by land and sea. Imperial Japanese Armed Forces war planners, ambitious for control of the Liaodong Peninsula and Port Arthur and also cognizant of that port&#x27;s strategic position controlling the northern Yellow Sea routes and the passage to Tianjin, were determined to seize it.

On 20–21 November 1894, 15,000 Japanese troops defeated 13,000 Qing soldiers and conquered Lüshunkou. 

Japan went on to occupy Port Arthur and to seize control of the whole Liaodong Peninsula. As part of the terms of the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki concluding the war, Japan was granted the Liaodong Peninsula but had to cede the territory when threatened jointly with war by France, Germany and Russia in what is called the Triple Intervention of 1895. This was seen as a great humiliation in Japan.

===Russian base in Port Arthur===
The Russian Empire in 1898 coerced a lease from China of the Liaodong Peninsula and created the territory of Russian Dalian. It gained railroad right-of-way to join the Liaodong Peninsula to the Chinese Eastern Railway with a line running from Port Arthur to the Chinese city of Harbin, and systematically began to fortify the town and harbor at Port Arthur. 
Tsar Nicholas II believed this acquisition of a Pacific port would enhance Russian security, and extend its economic influence. He was also falsely informed that the British Empire was considering seizing the port.
Nicholas founded Dalny (later Dalian) near Port Arthur and also on the Chinese Eastern Railway. In 1902, the Russian viceroy de-emphasized Dalny, building a palace and cultural edifices at Port Arthur instead. All of these developments contributed to Japanese resentment towards Russia over competing imperial aims in Manchuria.

===Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905)===
Ten years later, Port Arthur again played a central role in war in China. After the Boxer Rebellion (1900–01) had been extinguished by an international Eight-Nation Alliance of troops, the Imperial Russian Army refused to withdraw its reinforcements from Manchuria and instead began to fortify and garrison the entire route along the Southern Manchurian Railway. With this development, Japan proposed the two powers meet and discuss their respective roles in eastern Manchuria, as the area was considered being in their respective spheres of influence. Talks were conducted between 1902 and 1904. While numerous proposals and agreement papers were generated between the two powers, Russia continued the de facto annexation of territory through fortification and garrison, if not &quot;de jure&quot;; while employing stalling tactics in its negotiations. In the end, with over two years of intensive bilateral negotiations having gotten nowhere in clarifying each country&#x27;s rights, prerogatives, and interests in Manchuria, Japan attacked Port Arthur and the Russian fleet without declaring war in February 1904.

==== The Battle of Port Arthur ====

The Battle of Port Arthur, the opening battle of the Russo-Japanese War, was fought in the heavily fortified harbor of the town of Port Arthur/Lüshun on 9 February 1904 when the Japanese attacked at night with torpedoes, followed by a brief daylight skirmish by major surface combatants.

By the end of July 1904, the Japanese army had pushed down the Liaodong peninsula and was at the outer defenses of Port Arthur. The fact that Japanese forces had closed to within artillery range of the harbor in early August 1904 led directly to the naval Battle of the Yellow Sea which solidified Japan&#x27;s command of the sea, where her fleets continued to blockade the harbor. Virtually all the battles of the war until July 1904 were strategic battles for territorial gain or position leading to the investment and siege of the port city.

The port eventually fell 2 January 1905 after a long train of battles on land and sea during which the Japanese occupied the whole of the Korean Peninsula, split the Russian Army, devastated the Imperial Russian Navy, and cut off the source of supplies on the railway from Harbin, culminating in the bloody battle known as the Siege of Port Arthur (June–January; some sources place the siege start in late July, a technical difference due to definitions).

===Japanese Ryojun===
After Japan&#x27;s defeat of Russia, it took over Kwantung Leased Territory and renamed Port Arthur to Ryojun. The Japanese-controlled Ryojun City had 40 districts. They built the war monuments on 203 Hill and Baiyu Mountain. The Port Arthur–Harbin line became part of the South Manchurian Railway. After Japan created the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932, Japan regarded its lease as being held from Manchukuo rather than from China.

===Post-war administration===

The Chinese Lüshun City was established on 25 November 1945 to replace Ryojun. The city was a subdivision of a larger Lüda City and contained 40 villages in 3 districts: Dazhong (), Wenhua (), and Guangming (). In January 1946, Wenhua was merged into Dazhong, and the 40 villages were reduced to 23 communes (). In January 1948, the remaining two districts were merged into one: Shinei (), with 12 communes.

Under the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance signed by Joseph Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek, the Republic of China agreed to allow the Soviet Navy to maintain a base there in exchange for Soviet diplomatic recognition of the Nationalist government. However, the USSR later used the port to assist the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army during the Chinese Civil War, leading to the Kuomintang&#x27;s overthrow.

On 7 January 1960, Lüshun City was renamed Lüshunkou District, still under Lüda. In 1981, Lüda was renamed Dalian, with Lüshunkou remaining a constituent district. In 1985, 7 of Lüshunkou&#x27;s 9 townships were upgraded to towns.

Lüshunkou District administers 9 subdistricts; all of the former towns were either abolished, merged or converted into subdistricts themselves. 

*Dengfeng Subdistrict ()
*Desheng Subdistrict ()
*Shuishiying Subdistrict ()
*Longwangtang Subdistrict ()
*Tieshan Subdistrict ()
*Shuangdaowan Subdistrict ()
*Sanjianpu Subdistrict ()
*Changcheng Subdistrict ()
*Longtou Subdistrict ()
The city&#x27;s southern half along Lüshun South Road, central Lüshun and the Naval Port zone continue to be off-limits to foreigners although Lüshunkou District is thoroughly modernized. The World Peace Park opened on the western coast of Lüshun, becoming a sightseeing spot.

The universities in downtown Dalian are being relocated to Lüshunkou. Dalian Jiaotong University (formerly Dalian Railroad University) moved its software school to the area near the new port, and the Dalian University of Foreign Languages and Dalian Medical University relocated their main campuses to the eastern slope of Baiying Mountain, on Lüshun South Road. Dalian Fisheries University is in the process of moving its English and Japanese language schools to Daheishi, on Lüshun North Road. From late 2006, Sinorail has operated the Bohai Train Ferry between Lüshun, Dalian, and Yantai, Shandong.

<text>Paul Johannes Tillich (; ; August 20, 1886 – October 22, 1965) was a German-American Christian existentialist philosopher, religious socialist, and Lutheran theologian who was one of the most influential theologians of the twentieth century. Tillich taught at German universities before immigrating to the United States in 1933, where he taught at Union Theological Seminary, Harvard University, and the University of Chicago.

For the general public, Tillich wrote the well-received &quot;The Courage to Be&quot; (1952) and &quot;Dynamics of Faith&quot; (1957). His major three-volume &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; (1951–1963) was for theologians; in many points it was an answer to existentialist critique of Christianity.

Tillich&#x27;s work attracted scholarship from other influential thinkers like Karl Barth, Reinhold Niebuhr, H. Richard Niebuhr, George Lindbeck, Erich Przywara, James Luther Adams, Avery Cardinal Dulles, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Sallie McFague, Richard John Neuhaus, David Novak, Thomas Merton, Michael Novak, and Martin Luther King Jr. According to H. Richard Niebuhr, reading of &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; can be a great voyage of discovery into a rich and deep, and inclusive and yet elaborated, vision and understanding of human life in the presence of the mystery of God.&quot; John Herman Randall Jr. lauded the &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; as &quot;beyond doubt the richest, most suggestive, and most challenging philosophical theology our day has produced.&quot;

Tillich also authored many works in ethics, the philosophy of history, and comparative religion. His ideas continue to be studied and discussed at international conferences and seminars.

== Biography ==
Tillich was born on August 20, 1886, in the small village of Starzeddel, Province of Brandenburg, then part of Germany (modern-day Starosiedle, Poland). He had two younger sisters. Tillich&#x27;s Prussian father, Johannes Tillich, was a conservative Lutheran pastor of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia&#x27;s older Provinces; his mother, Mathilde Dürselen, was from the Rhineland and more liberal.

When Tillich was four, his father was assigned to Bad Schönfliess (now Trzcińsko-Zdrój, Poland), a town of three thousand, where Tillich began primary school. In 1898, Tillich was sent to Königsberg in der Neumark (now Chojna, Poland) to begin his &quot;gymnasium&quot; schooling. He was billeted in a boarding house and lonely, so he read the Bible. At school, he discovered humanist ideas.

In 1900, Tillich&#x27;s father was transferred to Berlin. Tillich switched to a Berlin school in 1901 and graduated in 1904. In September of the preceding year, his mother died of cancer; Tillich was 17. He attended several universities: the University of Berlin beginning in 1904; the University of Tübingen in 1905; and the University of Halle-Wittenberg from 1905 to 1907. He received his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree at the University of Breslau in 1911 and his Licentiate of Theology at Halle-Wittenberg in 1912. His PhD dissertation at Breslau was on Schelling and the history of religion&quot;.&quot;

During his time at university, he became a member of the Wingolf Christian fraternities in Berlin, Tübingen, and Halle.

In 1912, Tillich was ordained as a Lutheran minister in the Province of Brandenburg. On 28 September 1914, he married Margarethe (&quot;Grethi&quot;) Wever (1888–1968), and in October he joined the Imperial German Army as a chaplain during World War I. Grethi deserted Tillich in 1919 after an affair that produced a child not fathered by Tillich; the two then divorced. During the war, Tillich served as a chaplain in the trenches; he buried his closest friend and numerous soldiers in the mud of France. He was hospitalized three times for combat trauma, and was awarded the Iron Cross for bravery under fire. He came home from the war shattered. Tillich&#x27;s academic career began after the war; he became a Privatdozent of Theology at the University of Berlin, a post he held from 1919 to 1924. On his return from the war, he met Hannah Werner-Gottschow (then married and pregnant). In March 1924, they married; it was the second marriage for both. She later wrote a book entitled &quot;From Time to Time&quot; about their life together (including their open marriage). Although their lifestyle was upsetting to some, they remained together into old age.

From 1924 to 1925, Tillich served as an Associate Professor of Theology at the University of Marburg, where he began to develop his systematic theology, teaching a course on it during the last of his three terms. While at Marburg, Tillich developed a professional relationship with both Rudolf Bultmann and Martin Heidegger. From 1925 until 1929, Tillich was a Professor of Theology at the Dresden University of Technology and the University of Leipzig. Then, succeeding Max Scheler (who had died suddenly in 1928), Tillich held the post of &quot;Professor of Philosophy and Sociology&quot; at the University of Frankfurt from 1929 to 1933. While at Frankfurt Tillich&#x27;s two assistants (both completing their doctorates under him) were Harald Poelchau and Theodor Adorno (in 1931 Leo Strauss had applied for the same position but was rejected). During that period Tillich also &quot;was instrumental in hiring Max Horkheimer as the Director of the Institut für Sozialforschung and to a professorship in sociology at the University of Frankfurt.&quot; In Winter Term 1930-31 Tillich and Horkheimer together team-taught a course on John Locke; and during the several terms to immediately follow Tillich and Adorno together led seminars on Georg Simmel, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Along the way Tillich also remained in conversation with Erich Przywara.

While at the University of Frankfurt, Tillich traveled throughout Germany giving public lectures and speeches that brought him into conflict with the Nazi movement. Ten weeks after Adolf Hitler became German Chancellor, on 13 April 1933 Tillich, along with Karl Mannheim and Max Horkheimer, were among the &quot;first batch&quot; of prominent German academic &quot;enemies of the Reich&quot; to be summarily dismissed from their tenured positions for solely ideological and/or racial reasons. Reinhold Niebuhr visited Germany in the summer of 1933 and, already impressed with Tillich&#x27;s writings (they had known one another since 1919), contacted Tillich upon learning of his dismissal. Niebuhr urged Tillich to join the faculty at New York City&#x27;s Union Theological Seminary; Tillich accepted.

At the age of 47, Tillich moved with his family to the United States. This meant learning English, the language in which he would eventually publish works such as the &quot;Systematic Theology&quot;. From 1933 until 1955 he taught at Union Theological Seminary in New York, where he began as a Visiting Professor of Philosophy of Religion. During 1933–34 he was also a Visiting Lecturer in Philosophy at Columbia University. Remarkably, &quot;the faculty of Union [had] agreed to a 5% pay cut, at the height of the Great Depression, to bring the 47-year old Tillich and his family to the U.S.&quot;
Tillich acquired tenure at the Union Theological Seminary in 1937, and in 1940 he was promoted to Professor of Philosophical Theology and became an American citizen.
At Union, Tillich earned his reputation, publishing a series of books that outlined his idiosyncratic synthesis of Protestant Christian theology and existential philosophy. He published &quot;On the Boundary&quot; in 1936; &quot;The Protestant Era&quot;, a collection of his essays, in 1948; and &quot;The Shaking of the Foundations&quot;, the first of three volumes of his sermons, also in 1948. His collections of sermons gave him a broader audience than he had yet experienced.

Tillich&#x27;s most heralded achievements, though, were the 1951 publication of volume one of the &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; (University of Chicago Press), and the 1952 publication of &quot;The Courage to Be&quot; (Yale University Press). The first volume of the systematic theology examines the inner tensions in the structure of reason and being, primarily through a study in ontology. These tensions, Tillich contends, show that the quest for revelation is implied in finite reason, and that the quest for the ground of being is implied in finite being. The publication of &quot;Systematic Theology, Vol. 1&quot; brought Tillich international academic acclaim, prompting an invitation to give the prestigious Gifford Lectures in 1953–54 at the University of Aberdeen. &quot;The Courage to Be&quot;, which examines ontic, moral, and spiritual anxieties across history and in modernity, was based on Tillich&#x27;s 1950 Dwight H. Terry Lectureship and reached a wide general readership.

These works led to an appointment at Harvard Divinity School in 1955, where he was University Professor, among the (at the time) five highest ranking professors at Harvard. He was primarily a professor of undergraduates, because Harvard did not have a department of religion for them, but was thereby more exposed to the wider university and &quot;most fully embodied the ideal of a University Professor.&quot; In 1959, Tillich was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

In 1961, Tillich became one of the founding members of the Society for the Arts, Religion and Contemporary Culture, an organization with which he maintained ties for the remainder of his life. During this period, he published volume two of the &quot;Systematic Theology&quot;, as well as the popular book &quot;Dynamics of Faith&quot;, both in 1957. Tillich&#x27;s career at Harvard lasted until 1962, when he was appointed John Nuveen Professor of Theology at the University of Chicago. He remained at Chicago until his death in 1965.

Volume three of Tillich&#x27;s &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; was published in 1963. In 1964, Tillich became the first theologian to be honored in Kegley and Bretall&#x27;s &quot;Library of Living Theology&quot;: &quot;The adjective &#x27;great,&#x27; in our opinion, can be applied to very few thinkers of our time, but Tillich, we are far from alone in believing, stands unquestionably amongst these few.&quot; A widely quoted critical assessment of his importance was Georgia Harkness&#x27; comment: &quot;What Whitehead was to American philosophy, Tillich has been to American theology.&quot;

Tillich died on October 22, 1965, ten days after having a heart attack. In 1966, his ashes were interred in the Paul Tillich Park in New Harmony, Indiana. His gravestone inscription reads: &quot;And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit for his season, his leaf also shall not wither. And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.&quot; (Psalms 1:3)

== Philosophy and theology ==

===Being===
Tillich used the concept of being (&quot;Sein&quot;) throughout his philosophical and theological work. Some of his work engaged with the fundamental ontology of Martin Heidegger.

Tillich&#x27;s preliminary analysis of being ascends from the human subject&#x27;s asking of the ontological question (&quot;What is being itself?&quot;), upwards to the highest categories of metaphysics. He distinguishes among four levels of ontological analysis: self-world; dynamics and form, freedom and destiny, and individualization and participation; essential being and existential being; and time, space, causality, and substance.

Being plays a key role throughout Tillich&#x27;s &quot;Systematic Theology&quot;. In the opening to the second volume, Tillich writes: 
===God as the ground of being===

Throughout most of his work Tillich provides an ontological view of God as being-itself, the ground of being, and the power of being, one in which God is beyond essence and existence. He was critical of conceptions of God as a being (e.g., the highest being), as well as of pantheistic conceptions of God as universal essence. Traditional medieval philosophical theology in the work of figures such as St. Anselm, Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham tended to understand God as the highest existing being, to which predicates such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, goodness, righteousness, holiness, etc. may be ascribed. Arguments for and against the existence of God presuppose such an understanding of God. Tillich is critical of this mode of discourse, which he refers to as &quot;theological theism,&quot; and argues that if God is a being, even if the highest being, God cannot be properly called the source of all being. With respect to both God&#x27;s existence and essence, moreover, Tillich shows how difficulties beset Thomas Aquinas&#x27; attempt to &quot;maintain the truth that God is beyond essence and existence while simultaneously arguing for the existence of God.&quot;

Though Tillich is critical of propositional arguments for the existence of God as found in natural theology, as he considers them objectifying of God, he nonetheless affirms the reality of God as the ground of being. A similar line of thought is found in the work of Eric Voegelin. Tillich&#x27;s concept of God can be drawn out from his analysis of being. In Tillich&#x27;s analysis of being, all of being experiences the threat of nonbeing. Yet, following Heidegger, Tillich claims that it is human beings alone who can raise the question of being and therefore of being-itself. This is because, he contends, human beings&#x27; &quot;infinite self-transcendence is an expression of [their] belonging to that which is beyond nonbeing, namely, to being-itself ... Being-itself manifests itself to finite being in the infinite drive of the finite beyond itself.&quot;

Tillich addresses questions both ontological and personalist concerning God. One issue deals with whether and in what way personal language about the nature of God and humanity&#x27;s relationship to God is appropriate. In distinction to &quot;theological theism&quot;, Tillich refers to another kind of theism as that of the &quot;divine-human encounter&quot;. Such is the theism of the encounter with the &quot;Wholly Other&quot; (&quot;Das ganz Andere&quot;), as in the work of Karl Barth and Rudolf Otto. It implies a personalism with regard to God&#x27;s self-revelation. Tillich is quite clear that this is both appropriate and necessary, as it is the basis of the personalism of biblical religion altogether and of the concept of the &quot;Word of God&quot;, but can become falsified if the theologian tries to turn such encounters with God as the Wholly Other into an understanding of God as a being. In other words, God is both personal and transpersonal.

Tillich&#x27;s ontological view of God has precedent in Christian theology. In addition to affinities with the concept of God as being-itself in classical theism, it shares similarities with Hellenistic and Patristic conceptions of God as the &quot;unoriginate source&quot; (&quot;agennetos&quot;) of all being. This view was espoused in particular by Origen, one of a number of early theologians whose thought influenced Tillich&#x27;s. Their views in turn had pre-Christian precedents in middle Platonism. Aside from classical and Christian influences in Tillich&#x27;s concept of God, there is a dynamism in Tillich&#x27;s notion of &quot;the living God,&quot; reflecting some influence from Spinoza.

Tillich combines his ontological conception of God with a largely existential and phenomenological understanding of faith in God, remarking that God is &quot;the answer to the question implied in man&#x27;s finitude ... the name for that which concerns man ultimately.&quot; This is notably manifest in his understanding of faith as ultimate concern. Following his existential analysis, Tillich further argues that theological theism is not only logically problematic, but is unable to speak into the situation of radical doubt and despair about meaning in life. This issue, he said, was of primary concern in the modern age, as opposed to anxiety about fate, guilt, death and condemnation. This is because the state of finitude entails by necessity anxiety, and that it is our finitude as human beings, our being a mixture of being and nonbeing, that is at the ultimate basis of anxiety. If God is not the ground of being, then God cannot provide an answer to the question of finitude; God would also be finite in some sense. The term &quot;God Above God,&quot; then, means to indicate the God who appears, who is the ground of being, when the &quot;God&quot; of theological theism has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt. While on the one hand this God goes beyond the God of theism as usually defined, it finds expression in many religious symbols of the Christian faith, particularly that of the crucified Christ. The possibility thus exists, says Tillich, that religious symbols may be recovered which would otherwise have been rendered ineffective by contemporary society.

Tillich argues that the God of theological theism is at the root of much revolt against theism and religious faith in the modern period. Tillich states, sympathetically, that the God of theological theism 

Another reason Tillich criticized theological theism was because it placed God into the subject-object dichotomy. The subject-object dichotomy is the basic distinction made in epistemology. Epistemologically, God cannot be made into an object, that is, an object of the knowing subject. Tillich deals with this question under the rubric of the relationality of God. The question is &quot;whether there are external relations between God and the creature&quot;. Traditionally Christian theology has always understood the doctrine of creation to mean precisely this external relationality between God, the Creator, and the creature as separate and not identical realities. Tillich reminds us of the point, which can be found in Luther, that &quot;there is no place to which man can withdraw from the divine thou, because it includes the ego and is nearer to the ego than the ego to itself&quot;.

Tillich goes further to say that the desire to draw God into the subject–object dichotomy is an &quot;insult&quot; to the divine holiness. Similarly, if God were made into the subject rather than the object of knowledge (The Ultimate Subject), then the rest of existing entities then become subjected to the absolute knowledge and scrutiny of God, and the human being is &quot;reified,&quot; or made into a mere object. It would deprive the person of his or her own subjectivity and creativity. According to Tillich, theological theism has provoked the rebellions found in atheism and Existentialism, although other social factors such as the industrial revolution have also contributed to the &quot;reification&quot; of the human being. The modern man could no longer tolerate the idea of being an &quot;object&quot; completely subjected to the absolute knowledge of God. Tillich argued, as mentioned, that theological theism is &quot;bad theology&quot;.
Alternatively, Tillich presents the above-mentioned ontological view of God as Being-Itself, Ground of Being, Power of Being, and occasionally as Abyss or God&#x27;s &quot;Abysmal Being&quot;. What makes Tillich&#x27;s ontological view of God different from theological theism is that it transcends it by being the foundation or ultimate reality that &quot;precedes&quot; all beings. Just as Being for Heidegger is ontologically &quot;prior&quot; to conception, Tillich views God to be beyond being. God is not a supernatural entity among other entities. Instead, God is the inexhaustible ground which empowers the existence of beings. We cannot perceive God as an object which is related to a subject because God &quot;precedes&quot; the subject–object dichotomy.

Thus Tillich dismisses a literalistic Biblicism. Instead of rejecting the notion of personal God, however, Tillich sees it as a symbol that points directly to the Ground of Being. Since the Ground of Being ontologically precedes reason, it cannot be comprehended since comprehension presupposes the subject–object dichotomy. Tillich disagreed with any literal philosophical and religious statements that can be made about God. Such literal statements attempt to define God and lead not only to anthropomorphism but also to a philosophical mistake that Immanuel Kant warned against, that setting limits against the transcendent inevitably leads to contradictions. Any statements about God are simply symbolic, but these symbols are sacred in the sense that they function to participate or point to the Ground of Being.

Tillich also further elaborated the thesis of the God above the God of theism in his Systematic Theology.



===Method of correlation===
The key to understanding Tillich&#x27;s theology is what he calls the &quot;method of correlation.&quot; It is an approach that correlates insights from Christian revelation with the issues raised by existential, psychological, and philosophical analyses.

Tillich states in the introduction to the &quot;Systematic Theology&quot;:


For Tillich, the existential questions of human existence are associated with the field of philosophy and, more specifically, ontology (the study of being). This is because, according to Tillich, a lifelong pursuit of philosophy reveals that the central question of every philosophical inquiry always comes back to the question of being, or what it means to be, and, consequently, what it means to be a finite human being within being. To be correlated with existential questions are theological answers, themselves derived from Christian revelation. The task of the philosopher primarily involves developing the questions, whereas the task of the theologian primarily involves developing the answers to these questions. However, it should be remembered that the two tasks overlap and include one another: the theologian must be somewhat of a philosopher and vice versa, for Tillich&#x27;s notion of faith as &quot;ultimate concern&quot; necessitates that the theological answer be correlated with, compatible with, and in response to the general ontological question which must be developed independently from the answers. Thus, on one side of the correlation lies an ontological analysis of the human situation, whereas on the other is a presentation of the Christian message as a response to this existential dilemma. For Tillich, no formulation of the question can contradict the theological answer. This is because the Christian message claims, &quot;a priori&quot;, that the &quot;logos&quot; &quot;who became flesh&quot; is also the universal &quot;logos&quot; of the Greeks.

In addition to the intimate relationship between philosophy and theology, another important aspect of the method of correlation is Tillich&#x27;s distinction between form and content in the theological answers. While the nature of revelation determines the actual content of the theological answers, the character of the questions determines the form of these answers. This is because, for Tillich, theology must be an answering theology, or apologetic theology. God is called the &quot;ground of being&quot; in part because God is the answer to the ontological threat of non-being, and this characterization of the theological answer in philosophical terms means that the answer has been conditioned (insofar as its form is considered) by the question. Throughout the &quot;Systematic Theology&quot;, Tillich is careful to maintain this distinction between form and content without allowing one to be inadvertently conditioned by the other. Many criticisms of Tillich&#x27;s methodology revolve around this issue of whether the integrity of the Christian message is really maintained when its form is conditioned by philosophy.

The theological answer is also determined by the sources of theology, our experience, and the norm of theology. Though the form of the theological answers are determined by the character of the question, these answers (which &quot;are contained in the revelatory events on which Christianity is based&quot;) are also &quot;taken by systematic theology from the sources, through the medium, under the norm.&quot; There are three main sources of systematic theology: the Bible, Church history, and the history of religion and culture. Experience is not a source but a medium through which the sources speak. And the norm of theology is that by which both sources and experience are judged with regard to the content of the Christian faith. Thus, we have the following as elements of the method and structure of systematic theology:

* Sources of theology
** Bible
** Church history
** History of religion and culture
* Medium of the sources
** Collective experience of the Church
* Norm of theology (determines use of sources)
** Content of which is the biblical message itself, for example:
*** Justification through faith
*** New Being in Jesus as the Christ
*** The Protestant principle
*** The criterion of the cross

As McKelway explains, the sources of theology contribute to the formation of the norm, which then becomes the criterion through which the sources and experience are judged. The relationship is circular, as it is the present situation which conditions the norm in the interaction between church and biblical message. The norm is then subject to change, but Tillich insists that its basic content remains the same: that of the biblical message. It is tempting to conflate revelation with the norm, but we must keep in mind that revelation (whether original or dependent) is not an element of the structure of systematic theology per se, but an event. For Tillich, the present-day norm is the &quot;New Being in Jesus as the Christ as our Ultimate Concern&quot;. This is because the present question is one of estrangement, and the overcoming of this estrangement is what Tillich calls the &quot;New Being&quot;. But since Christianity answers the question of estrangement with &quot;Jesus as the Christ&quot;, the norm tells us that we find the New Being in Jesus as the Christ.

There is also the question of the validity of the method of correlation. Certainly one could reject the method on the grounds that there is no &quot;a priori&quot; reason for its adoption. But Tillich claims that the method of any theology and its system are interdependent. That is, an absolute methodological approach cannot be adopted because the method is continually being determined by the system and the objects of theology.

===Life and the Spirit===
This is part four of Tillich&#x27;s &quot;Systematic Theology&quot;. In this part, Tillich talks about life and the divine Spirit.

===Absolute faith===
Tillich stated the courage to take meaninglessness into oneself presupposes a relation to the ground of being: absolute faith. Absolute faith can transcend the theistic idea of God, and has three elements.



===Faith as ultimate concern===
According to the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, Tillich believes the essence of religious attitudes is what he calls &quot;ultimate concern&quot;. Separate from all profane and ordinary realities, the object of the concern is understood as sacred, numinous or holy. The perception of its reality is felt as so overwhelming and valuable that all else seems insignificant, and for this reason requires total surrender. In 1957, Tillich defined his conception of faith more explicitly in his work, &quot;Dynamics of Faith&quot;.

Tillich further refined his conception of faith by stating that, &quot;Faith as ultimate concern is an act of the total personality. It is the most centered act of the human mind ... it participates in the dynamics of personal life.&quot;

An arguably central component of Tillich&#x27;s concept of faith is his notion that faith is &quot;ecstatic&quot;. That is to say:

In short, for Tillich, faith does not stand opposed to rational or nonrational elements (reason and emotion respectively), as some philosophers would maintain. Rather, it &quot;transcends&quot; them in an ecstatic passion for the ultimate.

It should also be noted that Tillich does not exclude atheists in his exposition of faith. Everyone has an ultimate concern, and this concern can be in an act of faith, &quot;even if the act of faith includes the denial of God. Where there is ultimate concern, God can be denied only in the name of God&quot;

=== Tillich&#x27;s ontology of courage ===

In Paul Tillich&#x27;s work &quot;The Courage to Be&quot; he defines courage as the self-affirmation of one&#x27;s being in spite of a threat of nonbeing. He relates courage to anxiety, anxiety being the threat of non-being and the courage to be what we use to combat that threat. For Tillich, he outlines three types of anxiety and thus three ways to display the courage to be.

1) The Anxiety of Fate and Death
a. The Anxiety of Fate and Death is the most basic and universal form of anxiety for Tillich. It relates quite simply to the recognition of our mortality. This troubles us humans. We become anxious when we are unsure whether our actions create a causal damnation which leads to a very real and quite unavoidable death (42-44). &quot;Nonbeing threatens man&#x27;s ontic self-affirmation, relatively in terms of fate, absolutely in terms of death&quot; (41).
b. We display courage when we cease to rely on others to tell us what will come of us, (what will happen when we die etc.) and begin seeking those answers out for ourselves. Called the &quot;courage of confidence&quot; (162-63).

2) The Anxiety of Guilt and Condemnation
a. This anxiety afflicts our moral self-affirmation. We as humans are responsible for our moral being, and when asked by our judge (whoever that may be) what we have made of ourselves we must answer. The anxiety is produced when we realize our being is unsatisfactory. &quot;It [Nonbeing] threatens man&#x27;s moral self-affirmation, relatively in terms of guilt, absolutely in terms of condemnation&quot; (41).
b. We display courage when we first identify our sin; despair or whatever is causing us guilt or afflicting condemnation. We then rely on the idea that we are accepted regardless. &quot;The courage to be is the courage to accept oneself as accepted in spite of being unacceptable&quot; (164).

3) The Anxiety of Meaninglessness and Emptiness 
a. The Anxiety of Meaninglessness and Emptiness attacks our being as a whole. We worry about the loss of an ultimate concern or goal. This anxiety is also brought on by a loss of spirituality. We as beings feel the threat of non-being when we feel we have no place or purpose in the world. &quot;It [Nonbeing] threatens man&#x27;s spiritual self-affirmation, relatively in terms of emptiness, absolutely in terms of meaninglessness&quot; (41).
b. We display the courage to be when facing this anxiety by displaying true faith, and by again, self-affirming oneself. We draw from the &quot;power of being&quot; which is God for Tillich and use that faith to in turn affirm ourselves and negate the non-being. We can find our meaning and purpose through the &quot;power of being&quot; (172-73).

Tillich writes that the ultimate source of the courage to be is the &quot;God above God,&quot; which transcends the theistic idea of God and is the content of absolute faith (defined as &quot;the accepting of the acceptance without somebody or something that accepts&quot;) (185).

== Political views ==
Tillich espoused socialist politics, and became involved in religious socialist circles after World War I. He co-wrote a pamphlet in 1919 which advocated that Christian leaders with socialist leanings should &quot;enter into the socialist movement in order to pave the way for a future union of Christianity and the socialist social order&quot;. The Fellowship of Socialist Christians was organized in the early 1930s by Reinhold Niebuhr and others with similar views.
Later it changed its name to Frontier Fellowship and then to Christian Action.
The main supporters of the Fellowship in the early days included Tillich, Eduard Heimann, Sherwood Eddy and Rose Terlin. 
In its early days the group thought capitalist individualism was incompatible with Christian ethics.
Although not Communist, the group acknowledged Karl Marx&#x27;s social philosophy. Tillich was sympathetic towards the young Marx&#x27;s theory of alienation as well as his idea of historical materialism, but was opposed to rigid understandings of historical determinism that claimed the victory of socialism was inevitable, as espoused by many vulgar Marxists.

Tillich&#x27;s book &quot;The Socialist Decision&quot; was published in the early 1930s, during the rise of Nazism, and it was immediately censored by the Nazi regime. In the book, Tillich characterised Nazism as a form of political romanticism, which he defined as an attachment to a &quot;myth of origin (that) envisions the beginnings of humankind in elemental, superhuman figures of various kinds&quot; that he contended formed the basis for right-wing politics more generally. Tillich identified three basic origin myths in romantic politics: blood, soil and social group. He argued that these origin myths served to legitimate established social hierarchies by idealising the past and promoting a cyclical view of history that denied the possibility of progress and enlightened reform: &quot;the origin (myth) embodies the law of cyclical motion: whatever proceeds from it must return to it. Wherever the origin is in control, nothing new can happen&quot;. He also contended that whilst political romanticism could be critical of capitalism and industrial society, it could still be used by the capitalist class to advance their interests. Tillich more precisely described Nazism as form of revolutionary romanticism, which he counterposed to conservative romanticism. He stated that whilst the latter &quot;defend(s) the spiritual and social residues of the bond of origin... and whenever possible (seeks) to restore past forms&quot;, the former &quot;tries to gain a basis for new ties to the origin by a devastating attack on the rational system&quot;.

Tillich viewed liberalism as intertwined with capitalism, arguing that it granted freedom to the capitalist class without liberating the masses, and believing it had a key role in dismantling traditional social bonds, including religious ones, as well as advancing colonialism and slavery. However, he was positive about liberalism&#x27;s individualism, rationalism and egalitarianism, and believed that it was inseparable from democracy, despite tensions between the two. He considered that the connection between liberalism and capitalism needed to be severed in order for liberalism&#x27;s aspirations for freedom to be realised, advocating for an embrace of democratic socialism as an alternative.

== Popular works ==

Two of Tillich&#x27;s works, &quot;The Courage to Be&quot; (1952) and &quot;Dynamics of Faith&quot; (1957), were read widely, including by people who would not normally read religious books. In &quot;The Courage to Be&quot;, he lists three basic anxieties: anxiety about our biological finitude, i.e. that arising from the knowledge that we will eventually die; anxiety about our moral finitude, linked to guilt; and anxiety about our existential finitude, a sense of aimlessness in life. Tillich related these to three different historical eras: the early centuries of the Christian era; the Reformation; and the 20th century. Tillich&#x27;s popular works have influenced psychology as well as theology, having had an influence on Rollo May, whose &quot;The Courage to Create&quot; was inspired by &quot;The Courage to Be&quot;.

== Reception ==

Tillich&#x27;s most enduring legacy may be his spiritually-oriented public instruction. Tillich&#x27;s chapel sermons (especially at Union) were enthusiastically received. He was the only faculty member at Union willing to attend the revivals of Billy Graham. Tillich&#x27;s students commented on his approachability and interaction with them. Tillich along with his student, psychologist Rollo May, was an early leader at the Esalen Institute. New Age catchphrases describing God spatially as the &quot;Ground of Being&quot; and temporally as the &quot;Eternal Now,&quot; in tandem with the view that God is not an entity among entities but rather is &quot;Being-Itself&quot;—ideas which Eckhart Tolle invoked repeatedly throughout his career—were renovated by Tillich, although these ideas derive from Christian mystics and early theologians such as St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas.

A consideration of Tillich&#x27;s traumatic experiences as an active duty chaplain during World War I has led some to view his theology as &quot;Post-traumatic.&quot; The book &quot;Post-Traumatic God: How the Church Cares for People Who Have Been to Hell and Back&quot; explores Tillich&#x27;s experiences and theology to offer people afflicted with post-traumatic stress an understanding of God aimed at helping them heal.

===Criticism===
Martin Buber&#x27;s disciple Malcolm Diamond claims Tillich&#x27;s approach indicates a &quot;transtheistic position that Buber seeks to avoid&quot;, reducing God to the impersonal &quot;necessary being&quot; of Thomas Aquinas.

Tillich has been criticized from the Barthian wing of Protestantism for what is alleged to be correlation theory&#x27;s tendency to reduce God and his relationship to man to anthropocentric terms. Tillich countered that Barth&#x27;s approach to theology denies the &quot;possibility of understanding God&#x27;s relation to man in any other way than heteronomously or extrinsically&quot;. Defenders of Tillich claim that the critics misunderstood the distinction Tillich made between God&#x27;s unknowable essence as the unconditional &quot;Ground of Being&quot;, and how God reveals himself to mankind in existence. Tillich established the distinction in the first chapter of &quot;Systematic Theology Volume One:&quot; &quot;But though God in his abysmal nature [&quot;footnote: &#x27;Calvin: in his essence&#x27; &quot; ] is in no way dependent on man, God in his self manifestation to man is dependent on the way man receives his manifestation.&quot;

Some conservative forms of evangelical Christianity believe Tillich&#x27;s thought is too unorthodox to qualify as Christianity at all, but rather is a form of pantheism or atheism. The &quot;Evangelical Dictionary of Theology&quot; states, &quot;At best Tillich was a pantheist, but his thought borders on atheism.&quot; Defenders of Tillich counter such claims by pointing to clear monotheistic expressions from a classical Christian viewpoint, of the relationship between God and man, such as his description of the experience of grace in his sermon &quot;You Are Accepted&quot;.

<doc id="414219" wikidata="Q1412895" url="?curid=414219" title="Penile fracture">
<text>Penile fracture is rupture of one or both of the &quot;tunica albuginea&quot;, the fibrous coverings that envelop the penis&#x27;s &quot;corpora cavernosa&quot;. It is caused by rapid blunt force to an erect penis, usually during vaginal intercourse, or aggressive masturbation. It sometimes also involves partial or complete rupture of the urethra or injury to the dorsal nerves, veins and arteries.

==Signs and symptoms==
A popping or cracking sound, significant pain, swelling, immediate loss of erection leading to flaccidity, and skin hematoma of various sizes are commonly associated with the sexual event.

==Causes==
Penile fracture is a relatively uncommon clinical condition. Vaginal intercourse and aggressive masturbation are the most common causes. A 2014 study of accident and emergency records at three hospitals in Campinas, Brazil, showed that woman on top positions caused the greatest risk with the missionary position being the safest. The research conjectured that when the receptive partner is on top, they usually control the movement and are not able to interrupt movement when the penis suffers a misaligned penetration. Conversely, when the penetrative partner is controlling the movement, they have better chances of stopping in response to pain from misalignment, minimizing harm.

The practice of &quot;taqaandan&quot; (also &quot;taghaandan&quot;) also puts men at risk of penile fracture. Taqaandan, which comes from a Kurdish word meaning &quot;to click&quot;, involves bending the top part of the erect penis while holding the lower part of the shaft in place, until a click is heard and felt. Taqaandan is said to be painless and has been compared to cracking one&#x27;s knuckles, but the practice of taqaandan has led to an increase in the prevalence of penile fractures in western Iran. Taqaandan may be performed to achieve detumescence.

==Diagnosis==
=== Imaging studies ===
Ultrasound examination is able to depict the tunica albuginea tear in the majority of cases (as a hypoechoic discontinuity in the normally echogenic tunica). In a study on 25 patients, Zare Mehrjardi et al. concluded that ultrasound is unable to find the tear just when it is located at the penile base. In their study magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) accurately diagnosed all of the tears (as a discontinuity in the normally low signal tunica on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences). They concluded that ultrasound should be considered as the initial imaging method, and MRI can be helpful in cases that ultrasound does not depict any tear but clinical suspicions for fracture are still high. In the same study, authors investigated accuracy of ultrasound and MRI for determining the tear location (mapping of fracture) in order to perform a tailored surgical repair. MRI was more accurate than ultrasound for this purpose, but ultrasound mapping was well correlated with surgical results in cases where the tear was clearly visualized on ultrasound exam. The advantage of ultrasound in the diagnosis of penile fracture is unrivaled when its noninvasive, cost-effective, and nonionising nature are considered.

Penile trauma can result from a blunt or penetrating injury, the latter being rarely investigated by imaging methods, almost always requiring immediate surgical exploration. In the erect penis, trauma results from stretching and narrowing of the tunica albuginea, which can undergo segmental rupture of one or both of the corpora cavernosa, constituting a penile fracture.

In the ultrasound examination, a lesion of the tunica albuginea presents as an interruption in (loss of continuity of) the echoic line representing it (Figure 4). Small, moderate, or broad hematomas demonstrate the extent of that discontinuity. Intracavernous hematomas, sometimes without the presence of a tunica albuginea fracture, can be observed when there is a lesion of the smooth muscle of the trabeculae surrounding the sinusoid spaces or the subtunical venular plexus.

In 10–15% of penile traumas, there can be an accompanying urethral lesion. When blood is observed in the urethral meatus, contrast-enhanced evaluation of the urethra is necessary. In cases in which the ultrasound findings are inconclusive, the use of magnetic resonance imaging can facilitate the diagnosis and is recommended by various authors.

==Treatment ==
Penile fracture is a medical emergency, and emergency surgical repair is the usual treatment. Delay in seeking treatment increases the complication rate. Non-surgical approaches result in 10–50% complication rates including erectile dysfunction, permanent penile curvature, damage to the urethra and pain during sexual intercourse, while operatively treated patients experience an 11% complication rate.

In some cases, retrograde urethrogram may be performed to rule out concurrent urethral injury.
==Legal issues==
In the United States, the case of &quot;Doe v. Moe&quot;, 63 Mass. App. Ct. 516, 827 N.E.2d 240 (2005), tested liability for a penile fracture injury caused during sexual intercourse. The court declined to find duty as between two consensual adults. The plaintiff in this case, a man who suffered a fractured penis, complained that the defendant, his ex-girlfriend, had caused his injury while she was on top of him during sexual intercourse. The court ruled in her favor, determining that her conduct was neither legally wanton nor reckless.

<text>Shigeki Maruyama (丸山茂樹, &quot;Maruyama Shigeki&quot;; born 12 September 1969) is a Japanese professional golfer.

==Early life==
Maruyama was born in Ichikawa, Japan, near Tokyo. He attended Nihon University.

== Professional career ==
In 1992, he turned professional. He is known for his ever-present smile on the golf course which has given rise to his nickname of the &quot;Smiling Assassin.&quot; He began his career on the Japan Golf Tour, quickly becoming one of the leading players on that tour. Two excellent finishes in World Golf Championships events in 1999 helped to earn him membership of the U.S.-based PGA Tour for the 2000 season. He has three PGA Tour victories. At the end of the 2008 season he announced he was returning to Japan after failing to maintain full playing rights on the PGA Tour.

Maruyama was a member of The International Team in the Presidents Cup in 1998 and 2000. He had a 5–0–0 win–loss–tie record in the 1998 matches.

He has featured in the top 20 of the Official World Golf Ranking.

On 5 June 2000, he shot a first round 58 at Woodmont Country Club (South Course) in Rockville, Maryland while qualifying for the 2000 U.S. Open. This round ties the score achieved by Jim Furyk on the final round of the Travelers Championship on 2016.

<text>Helen Joy Davidman (18 April 1915 – 13 July 1960) was an American poet and writer. Often referred to as a child prodigy, she earned a master&#x27;s degree from Columbia University in English literature at age twenty in 1935. For her book of poems, &quot;Letter to a Comrade&quot;, she won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition in 1938 and the Russell Loines Award for Poetry in 1939. She was the author of several books, including two novels.

While an atheist and after becoming a member of the American Communist Party, she met and married her first husband and father of her two sons, William Lindsay Gresham, in 1942. After a troubled marriage, and following her conversion to Christianity, they divorced and she left America to travel to England with her sons.

Davidman published her best-known work, &quot;Smoke on the Mountain: An Interpretation of the Ten Commandments,&quot; in 1954 with a preface by C. S. Lewis. Lewis influenced her work and conversion and became her second husband after her permanent relocation to England in 1956. She died from metastatic carcinoma involving the bones in 1960.

The relationship that developed between Davidman and Lewis has been featured in a BBC television film, a stage play, and a 1993 cinema film named &quot;Shadowlands&quot;. Lewis published &quot;A Grief Observed&quot; under a pseudonym in 1961, from notebooks he kept after his wife&#x27;s death revealing his immense grief and a period of questioning God.

==Early life==
Helen Joy Davidman was born on 18 April 1915 into a secular middle-class Jewish family in New York City of Polish-Jewish and Russian-Jewish descent. Her parents, Joseph Davidman and Jeanette Spivack (married 1909), arrived in America in the late 19th century. Davidman grew up in the Bronx with her younger brother, Howard, and with both parents employed, even during the Great Depression. She was provided with a good education, piano lessons and family vacation trips. Davidman wrote in 1951: &quot;I was a well-brought-up, right-thinking child of materialism... I was an atheist and the daughter of an atheist&quot;.

Davidman was a child prodigy, who scored above 150 on IQ testing, with exceptional critical, analytical and musical skills. She read H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Outline of History&quot; at the age of eight and was able to play a score of Chopin on the piano after having read it once and not looking at it again. At an early age, she read George MacDonald&#x27;s children&#x27;s books and his adult fantasy book, &quot;Phantastes&quot;. She wrote about the influence of these stories: &quot;They developed in me a lifelong taste for fantasy, which led me years later to C. S. Lewis, who in turn led me to religion.&quot; A sickly child, suffering from a crooked spine, scarlet fever and anemia throughout her school years, and attending classes with much older classmates, she later referred to herself at this time as being &quot;bookish, over-precocious and arrogant&quot;.

After finishing high school at Evander Childs High School at fourteen years old, she read books at home until she entered Hunter College in the Bronx at the age of fifteen, earning a BA degree at nineteen. In 1935, she received a master&#x27;s degree in English literature from Columbia University in three semesters, while also teaching at Roosevelt High School. In 1936, after several of Davidman&#x27;s poems were published in &quot;Poetry&quot;, editor Harriet Monroe asked her to work for the magazine as reader and editor. Davidman resigned her teaching position to work full-time in writing and editing.

During the Great Depression, several incidents, including witnessing the suicide of a hungry orphan jumping off a roof at Hunter College, are said to have caused her to question the fairness of capitalism and the American economic system. She joined the American Communist Party in 1938.

For her collection of poems, &quot;Letter to a Comrade&quot;, she won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition in 1938. She was chosen by Stephen Vincent Benét, who commended Davidman for her &quot;varied command of forms and a bold power.&quot; In 1939, she won the Russell Loines Award for Poetry for this same book of poems. Although much of her work during this period reflected her politics as a member of the American Communist Party, this volume of poetry was much more than implied by the title, and contained forty-five poems written in traditional and free verse that were related to serious topics of the time such as the Spanish Civil War, the inequalities of class structure and male-female relationship issues. Davidman&#x27;s style in these revealed the influence of Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;.

She was employed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1939 for a six-month stay in Hollywood writing movie scripts. She wrote at least four, but they were not used and she returned to New York City to work for &quot;The New Masses&quot;, where she wrote a controversial movie column, reviewing Hollywood movies in a manner described as &quot;merciless in her criticisms.&quot; Her acclaimed first novel, &quot;Anya&quot; was published in 1940. Between 1941 and 1943, she was employed as a book reviewer and poetry editor for &quot;The New Masses&quot; with publications in many of the issues.

==Life with William Lindsay Gresham==
She married her first husband, author William Lindsay Gresham, on 24 August 1942 after becoming acquainted with him through their mutual interest in communism. They had two sons, David Lindsay Gresham (born 27 March 1944) and Douglas Howard Gresham (born 10 November 1945). Bill Gresham had become disillusioned with the Communist Party while volunteering in Spain during the Spanish Civil War to fight fascism and influenced Davidman to leave the party after the birth of their sons. During the marriage, Gresham wrote his most famous work &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot; in 1946, while Davidman did freelance work and cared for the house and children.

The marriage was marked by difficulties that included financial problems, as well as her husband&#x27;s alcoholism and infidelities. Gresham sometimes had drunken outbursts, once smashing his guitar on a chair. Davidman wrote that her husband had telephoned her one day in spring 1946 telling her that he was having a nervous breakdown and did not know when he would return home. Afterwards, she suffered from a defeated emotional state. She had an experience that she described as: &quot;for the first time my pride was forced to admit that I was not, after all, &#x27;the master of my fate&#x27;... All my defenses – all the walls of arrogance and cocksureness and self-love behind which I had hid from God – went down momentarily – and God came in.&quot; When Gresham did return home, the couple began to look to religion for answers. Davidman at first studied Judaism, but decided to study all religions and concluded that &quot;the Redeemer who had made himself known, whose personality I would have recognized among ten thousand—He was Jesus.&quot; Through their religious studies, the couple, in particular, began to read and be influenced by the books of C.S. Lewis.

When Gresham received a large sum for the movie rights to &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;, the family moved to an old mansion with acreage in the New York countryside, where Davidman began to write her second novel, &quot;Weeping Bay&quot; and Gresham also started his second novel, &quot;Limbo Tower&quot;. In 1948, they became members of the Pleasant Plains Presbyterian Church. Gresham had at first similar Christian convictions as Joy, but soon rejected them; he continued to have extramarital affairs and developed an interest in tarot cards and the &quot;I Ching&quot;. Both experimented with L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s theories of Dianetics and &quot;audited&quot; each other and friends. The couple became estranged, even though they continued to live together. After an introduction by a fellow American writer, Chad Walsh, Davidman began a correspondence with C. S. Lewis in 1950.

==Life with C. S. Lewis==
Davidman first met Lewis in August 1952 when she made a trip to the United Kingdom. She planned to finish her book on the Ten Commandments, which showed influences of Lewis&#x27;s style of apologetics. After several lunch meetings and walks accompanying Lewis and Davidman, Lewis&#x27;s brother, Warren Lewis, wrote in his diary that &quot;a rapid friendship&quot; had developed between his younger brother and Davidman, whom he described as &quot;a Christian convert of Jewish race, medium height, good figure, horn rimmed specs, quite extraordinarily uninhibited.&quot; She spent Christmas and a fortnight at The Kilns with the brothers. Though Davidman was deeply in love with Lewis, there was no reciprocation on his side.

She returned home in January 1953, having received a letter from Gresham that he and her cousin were having an affair and he wanted a divorce. Her cousin Renée Rodriguez had moved into the Gresham home and was keeping house for the family while she was away. Davidman intended to try to save the marriage, but she agreed to a divorce after a violent encounter with Gresham, who had resumed drinking. He married Rodriguez when the divorce became final in August 1954.

Confessing to be a &quot;complete Anglomaniac&quot;, Davidman returned to England with her sons in November 1953. Cynthia Haven speculates that the activities of HUAC might have been a factor in her decision to emigrate and not return, given her political affiliations in the past. Davidman found a flat in London and enrolled David and Douglas at Dane Court Preparatory School, but she soon ran into financial difficulties when Gresham stopped sending money for support. Lewis paid the school fees and found Davidman and her sons a house in Oxford close to The Kilns. Lewis originally regarded her only as an agreeable intellectual companion and personal friend. Warren Lewis wrote: &quot;For Jack (C.S. Lewis) the attraction was at first undoubtedly intellectual. Joy was the only woman whom he had met... who had a brain which matched his own in suppleness, in width of interest, and in analytical grasp, and above all in humour and a sense of fun.&quot; 
She was my daughter and my mother, my pupil and my teacher, my subject and my sovereign; and always, holding all these in solution, my trusty comrade, friend, shipmate, fellow-soldier. My mistress; but at the same time all that any man friend (and I have good ones) has ever been to me. Perhaps more. – C. S. Lewis

Lewis began to ask for Davidman&#x27;s opinion and criticism when he was writing and she served as the inspiration for Orual, the central character in &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot; (1956). Other works that she influenced or helped with include &quot;Reflections on the Psalms&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Four Loves&quot; (1960). Davidman&#x27;s book &quot;Smoke on the Mountain: An Interpretation of the Ten Commandments&quot; was published in 1955 in England with a preface by C. S. Lewis. It sold 3,000 copies, double that of US sales.

In 1956, Davidman&#x27;s visitor&#x27;s visa was not renewed by the Home Office, requiring that she and her sons return to America. Lewis agreed to enter into a civil marriage contract with her so that she could continue to live in the UK, telling a friend that &quot;the marriage was a pure matter of friendship and expediency&quot;. The civil marriage took place at the register office, 42 St Giles&#x27;, Oxford, on 23 April 1956.

The couple continued to live separately after the civil marriage. In October 1956, Davidman was walking across her kitchen when she tripped over the telephone wire and fell to the floor, thereby breaking her left upper leg. At the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, she was diagnosed with incurable cancer, with bone metastases from breast carcinoma. It was at this time that Lewis recognised that he had fallen in love with her, realising how despondent he would feel to lose her. He wrote to a friend: &quot;new beauty and new tragedy have entered my life. You would be surprised (or perhaps you would not?) to know how much of a strange sort of happiness and even gaiety there is between us.&quot; Davidman underwent several operations and radiation treatment for the cancer. In March 1957, Warren Lewis wrote in his diary: &quot;One of the most painful days of my life. Sentence of death has been passed on Joy, and the end is only a matter of time.&quot;
The relationship between Davidman and C. S. Lewis had developed to the point that they sought a Christian marriage. This was not straightforward in the Church of England at the time, because she was divorced, but a friend and Anglican priest, the Reverend Peter Bide, performed the ceremony at Davidman&#x27;s hospital bed on 21 March 1957. The marriage did not win wide approval among Lewis&#x27;s social circle, and some of his friends and colleagues avoided the new couple.

Upon leaving the hospital a week later, she was taken to The Kilns and soon enjoyed a remission from the cancer. She helped Lewis with his writing, organised his financial records and wardrobe, and had the house renovated and redecorated. The couple went on a belated honeymoon to Wales and then by air to Ireland. In October 1959, a check-up revealed that the cancer had returned, and as of March 1960, was not responding to radiation therapy, as before. In April 1960, Lewis took Davidman on a holiday to Greece to fulfil her lifelong wish to visit there, but her condition worsened quickly upon return from the trip, and she died on 13 July 1960.

As a widower, Lewis wrote &quot;A Grief Observed&quot; which he published under the pseudonym of N. W. Clerk, describing his feelings and paying tribute to his wife. In the book, he recounts his wavering faith due to the overwhelming grief which he suffered after Davidman&#x27;s death, and his struggle to regain that faith. Lewis developed a heart condition two years later and went into a coma, from which he recovered, but he died a year later—three years after his wife.

==&quot;Shadowlands&quot;==
&quot;Shadowlands&quot; is a dramatised version of Davidman&#x27;s life with C. S. Lewis by William Nicholson, which has been filmed twice. In 1985, a television version was made by the BBC One, starring Joss Ackland as Lewis and Claire Bloom as Davidman. The BBC production won BAFTA awards for best play and best actress in 1986. Nicholson&#x27;s work drew in part from Douglas Gresham&#x27;s book &quot;Lenten Lands: My Childhood with Joy Davidman and CS Lewis&quot;. It was also performed in London as an award-winning stage play in 1989–90. The play was transferred successfully to Broadway in 1990–91 with Nigel Hawthorne and Jane Alexander starring, and was also revived in London in 2007. A cinema film version was released in 1993, with Anthony Hopkins as Jack (C. S. Lewis) and Debra Winger (in an Academy Award-nominated performance) as Joy Davidman.

==Epitaph==
C. S. Lewis wrote an epitaph originally on the death of Charles Williams; he adapted it to place on his wife&#x27;s grave.
&lt;poem&gt;Here the whole world (stars, water, air,
And field, and forest, as they were
Reflected in a single mind)
Like cast off clothes was left behind
In ashes, yet with hopes that she,
Re-born from holy poverty,
In lenten lands, hereafter may
Resume them on her Easter Day.&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="414227" wikidata="Q4237448" url="?curid=414227" title="Greater administrative region">
<text>Greater administrative regions or greater administrative areas () were top-level administrative divisions of the Communist-held Liberated Zone in Northern China and later the nascent People&#x27;s Republic of China that directly governed provinces and municipalities. These were the largest-ever political divisions of China and were controlled by the Central People&#x27;s Government. They were dissolved between June and November 1954.

== List ==
The greater administrative regions originated from the districts governed by governors-general () established during the late Qing dynasty. The six greater administrative regions were:

== History ==
The highest officials of the greater administrative regions were known as chairmen (). (From this historical origin derives the term still used today for the top officials of China&#x27;s autonomous regions.)

The North China Region was the first to be abandoned on October 31, 1949, given the People&#x27;s Republic by now had been established with Beijing as capital city. The provinces it governed were thenceforth directly controlled by the North China Branch () of the Government Administration Council of the Central People&#x27;s Government instead. In May 1952, control was again transferred, this time to the North China Administrative Council () of the Government Administration Council.

Several other large-scale entities governed parts of China&#x27;s territory during this time and were equivalent to greater administrative regions:

* Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
* Local Government of Tibet () &quot;i.e.&quot; (Kashag) 
* The Executive Committee of Qiongyai Minority Nationality Autonomous Region () from 1949, later assigned to Central and South China region; the predecessor of Hainan

Except the Northeast, which was governed by a People&#x27;s Government, the regions&#x27; highest government bodies were Military and Administrative Committees (), which were replaced by administrative councils in November 1952.

Several domains in China today retain the same structure of geographic divisions as the GAAs. Military administrative regions, the divisions of some major banks, and civil aviation districts are still divided in the same form as the greater administrative regions.

The provincial cities were formerly under the jurisdiction of provinces, but the provinces were streamlined and effectively downsized to non-self-governing bodies in 1998, in 2018 all provincial governmental organs were formally abolished. Provincial cities along counties, are presently regarded as &quot;de facto&quot; principal subdivisions directed by the central government of the ROC.

== History ==

The first administrative divisions entitled &quot;city&quot; were established in the 1920s when Taiwan was under Japanese rule. At this time cities were under the jurisdiction of prefectures. After the World War II, nine (9) out of eleven (11) prefectural cities established by the Japanese government were reform into provincial cities. Their roman spellings are also changed to reflect the official language shift from Japanese to Mandarin Chinese, but characters remain the same.
The reform was based on the &quot;Laws on the City Formation&quot; () of the Republic of China. This law was passed in the early 20th century. The criteria for being a provincial city included being the provincial capital as well as having a population of over 200,000, or over 100,000 if the city had particular significance in politics, economics, and culture. The division reform in 1945 had some compromises between the Japanese and the Chinese systems, some of the cities with population under the criteria were still be established as provincial cities.

After the government of the Republic of China relocated to Taipei, Taiwan in 1949, the population criterion for provincial cities was raised to 500,000 in the &quot;Guidelines on the Implementation of Local Autonomy in the Counties and Cities of Taiwan Province&quot; (), which was passed in 1981. It was later raised again to 600,000. Since the streamline of provinces in 1998, provincial cities are all directly under the central government, and are simply referred to as &quot;cities&quot;.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), which claims Taiwan as its 23rd province, has all of its provincial cities classified as county-level city.

== Current cities ==

Currently, the &quot;Local Government Act&quot; of the Ministry of the Interior applies for the creation of a &quot;city&quot;, in which a city needs to have a population between 500,000 and 1,250,000 and occupies major political, economical and cultural roles. Note that all three existing &quot;cities&quot; are not qualified for the population test, they were built for historical reasons.

There are currently three &quot;cities&quot;, all in Taiwan Province:

Their self-governed bodies (executive and legislature) regulated by the &quot;Local Government Act&quot; are:

<text>Douglas Howard Gresham (born November 10, 1945) is an American British stage and voice-over actor, biographer, film producer, and executive record producer. He is one of the two stepsons of C. S. Lewis.

== Early life ==
Gresham was born in New York City, the son of writers William Lindsay Gresham and Joy Davidman. William Gresham was the author of &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;, the classic of American noir literature, while Joy Davidman (of Jewish descent) was best known for her book &quot;Smoke on the Mountain&quot;, about the Ten Commandments. The couple separated in 1954, and Joy moved to England with her two sons, sending them to Dane Court preparatory school in Pyrford, Surrey.

== C. S. Lewis ==
Gresham&#x27;s mother had become friends with C. S. Lewis through correspondence, and the friendship blossomed, eventually leading to marriage in 1956. Gresham&#x27;s mother died of cancer in 1960, and Lewis continued to raise Douglas and his elder brother David. (Lewis had adopted the boys when he married, and &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; is dedicated to them both.) At Lewis&#x27;s death in 1963, his estate went to his brother Major Warren Hamilton Lewis. The Major in turn passed the estate to Douglas and David 10 years later.

Douglas Gresham is a Christian, as were Lewis and his mother Joy, while David returned to the Orthodox Judaism of their mother&#x27;s ancestors while still a child in Lewis&#x27;s home. Lewis made an effort to find kosher food for him.

== Career ==
Gresham hosted Focus on the Family Radio Theatre&#x27;s adaptations of his stepfather&#x27;s most famous works, and he was named co-producer for the series of theatrical films adaptations of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;; he also appeared in a cameo role in the first installment as a radio newscaster, the second as a &quot;Telmarine crier&quot; and the third as a slaver.

Gresham came on as executive producer of recording artist Meg Sutherland&#x27;s debut album in 2014, successfully signing her to Sprig Music in March with producer Christopher Hopper. He has responded to Sutherland&#x27;s music by saying that it &quot;sings from and about the heart. Sometimes it hurts. Sometimes it fills with joy. But then, beauty is like that.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Gresham and his wife Merrie lived at Rathvinden House in Leighlinbridge, County Carlow, Ireland, before moving to their house in Malta in 2008. They have five children. Before this, he owned four farms in Tasmania, Australia, with his wife and four of their children. In the late 2000s, Gresham and his family also acquired Little Green Island, a private island in Australia near Mackay, Queensland. The island was sold in 2024, as Gresham could &quot;no longer travel internationally&quot;.

Gresham has written an autobiography, &quot;Lenten Lands&quot;, of his life to the age of 28 in 1973. A fictionalized young Douglas Gresham is a character in the 1993 film &quot;Shadowlands&quot;, in part derived from &quot;Lenten Lands&quot;. In the film, Gresham is played by the American actor Joseph Mazzello. There is no character derived from Douglas&#x27; brother David in the film or in the stage play on which the film was based, although both Douglas and David were portrayed in the original teleplay (1985) on which the stage play was based.

In November 2005, Gresham acknowledged in an interview on NPR that he and his brother David had been estranged, although in a subsequent interview he did say that they had been in email contact. After David&#x27;s death, Gresham revealed that his brother had been diagnosed as a dangerous paranoid schizophrenic, and in their youth had often tried to harm him. David died in a Swiss mental hospital on December 25, 2014.

<text>A county-administered city is a third-level administrative division in the Republic of China (Taiwan) below a county, which in turn is below of a province. Under the administrative structure of the ROC, it is at the same level as a township or a district. Such cities are under the jurisdiction of counties. It is also the lowest-level city in Taiwan, below a city and a special municipality. There are 14 county-administered cities currently under ROC control.

==History==

The first administrative divisions entitled &quot;city&quot; were established in the 1920s when Taiwan was under Japanese rule. At this time cities were under the jurisdiction of prefectures. After the World War II, nine (9) out of eleven (11) prefectural cities established by the Japanese government were reorganized into provincial cities based on the &quot;Laws on the City Formation&quot; ().

However, the populations of Hualien (Karenkō) and Yilan (Giran) were too low to become a provincial city, but they were of more importance than urban townships. Thus the &quot;Scheme on the Local Rules in Various Counties and Cities of Taiwan Province&quot; () provided for the creation of county-administered cities along with urban townships and rural townships. 

In 1951, a large scale administrative division reorganization took place in Taiwan. The size of counties shrink and the county-administered districts were abolished. This puts county-administered cities and townships into the same level in the hierarchy. Four provincial cities were also downgraded to county-administered cities after this reorganization. Since county-administered cities are based on the law for Taiwan Province, Kinmen and Lienchiang Counties of Fukien Province do not have any city under their jurisdiction.

The population criterion was originally 50,000 in the 1940s, but was raised to 100,000 in 1959, again in 1977 to 150,000, and in 2015 it was lower back to 100,000. Under the current. Currently, the &quot;Local Government Act&quot; regulates the creation of a county-administered city, in which a city needs to have a population between 100,000 and 500,000 and occupies major political, economical and cultural roles. Not all existing county-administered cities are qualified for the population test, they were built for historical reasons.

== Current county-administered cities ==
There are currently fourteen (14) county-administered cities, all in Taiwan Province:
Each county-administered city has its own local self-government bodies as stipulated in the &quot;Local Government Act&quot;: a city office () and a city council (). The mayor () and members of the city council () are elected by the residents of the city. A county-administered city is further divided into urban villages ().

== Timeline ==
Below, unless noted otherwise in parentheses, the newly created cities were towns that exceeded the 150,000 criteria.
==Populous Townships==
Townships with population more than 90,000, close to the upgrading criterion (as of March 2017)
* Caotun (草屯鎮; 98,330)
* Zhudong (竹東鎮; 96,877)
* Hemei (和美鎮; 91,159)

<doc id="414254" wikidata="Q2271589" url="?curid=414254" title="Sephardic music">
<text>Sephardic music is an umbrella term used to refer to the music of the Sephardic Jewish community. Sephardic Jews have a diverse repertoire the origins of which center primarily around the Mediterranean basin. In the secular tradition, material is usually sung in dialects of Judeo-Spanish, though other languages including Hebrew, Turkish, Greek, and other local languages of the Sephardic diaspora are widely used. Sephardim maintain geographically unique liturgical and para-liturgical traditions.

Songs which are sung by women are traditionally sung while performing household tasks, without accompaniment or harmony. Tambourines and other percussion instruments are sometimes used, especially in wedding songs. Oud and qanún are also used in some instrumentations of Sephardic music, and more modern performers incorporate countless other imported instruments.

== History ==
Sephardic music has its roots in the musical traditions of the Jewish communities in medieval Spain and medieval Portugal. Since then, it has picked up influences from Morocco, Greece, Bulgaria, and the other places that Spanish and Portuguese Jews settled after their expulsion from Spain in 1492 and from Portugal in 1496. Lyrics were preserved by communities formed by the Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula. These Sephardic communities share many of the same lyrics and poems, but the melodies vary considerably.

Because so many centuries have passed since the expulsion, a lot of the original melodies have been lost. Instead, Sephardic music has adopted the melodies and rhythms of the various countries where the Sephardim settled in. The Greek and Turkish traditions are fairly close. The Moroccan or “western” Sephardic traditions are not that close to the eastern/Greek/Turkish traditions.

These song traditions spread from Spain to Morocco (the &quot;Western Tradition&quot;) and several parts of the Ottoman Empire (the &quot;Eastern Tradition&quot;) including Greece, Jerusalem, Armenia, the Balkans and Egypt. Sephardic music adapted to each of these locales, assimilating North African high-pitched, extended ululations; Balkan rhythms, (for instance in 9/8 time); and the Arabic &quot;maqam&quot; mode.

The song traditions were studied and transcribed in the early twentieth century by a number of ethnomusicologists and scholars of medieval Hispanic literature. From around 1957 until quite recently, Samuel Armistead (UC Davis) with colleagues Joseph Silverman and Israel Katz collected Judeo-Spanish songs from informants in North America, Turkey, the Balkans, Greece, North Africa, and Israel. The digitized recordings, with transcriptions and information about song type, are available on the website Folk Literature of the Sephardic Jews, now permanently hosted by the University of Illinois Library.

The early 20th century saw some popular commercial recordings of Sephardic music come out of Greece and Turkey, followed by recordings from Jerusalem and other parts of the Eastern Tradition. The first performers were mostly men, including the &quot;Turks&quot; Jack Mayesh, Haim Efendi and Yitzhak Algazi. Later, a new generation of singers arose, many of whom were not themselves Sephardic. Gloria Levy, Pasharos Sefardíes, Flory Jagoda the Parvarim, and Janet &amp; Jak Esim Ensemble are popular Eastern Tradition performers of this period. Gerard Edery, Savina Yannatou, Stefani Valadez, Françoise Atlan, Marlene Samoun Yasmin Levy and Mara Aranda are among the new generation of singers bringing a new interpretation to the Ladino/Judeo-Spanish heritage and, in the large case of Levy and Edery, mixing it with Andalusian Flamenco. Opera singer and actor David Serero sings Ladino and Sephardic songs which he often includes in theater classics such as Merchant of Venice and Othello.

The Jewish Community of Thessaloniki Choir was founded in 1995 by members of the community. The choir was founded in the hope that the musical tradition that their ancestors took with them when they were expelled from the Iberian Peninsula 500 years ago would be preserved and revived. The research of its conductor &#x27;Kostis Papazoglou&#x27; on Sepharadic music from the medieval tradition (songs like &quot;Tres Ermanikas&quot;) and later as the music evolved resulted to a CD, produced by Minos EMI, with the participation of the Codex Ensemble, under the title &quot; En la mar ay una torre.&quot; Today, this choir has 25-30 members of different ages. Its conductor Kostis Papazoglou, is an experienced and distinguished music teacher, soloist, and orchestras conductor, who has given concerts all over Greece as well as in Israel (Tel Aviv), Skopia, Vienna, Salzburg, Bulgaria (Sofia), Russia (St. Petersburg), Egypt (Cairo at the inauguration of the rebuilt Ben Ezra Synagogue),Turkey (Istanbul in the Ashkenaz Synagogue on the occasion of Jewish Culture Week), and Hungary (in the Great Budapest Synagogue).

==Instrumentation==

Sephardic music, including pan-Sephardic music which may not necessarily be Judeo-Spanish, is primarily vocal. Instruments, when they are used, are played to accompany songs. the choice of Instruments used by Sephardim has generally reflected the instruments used in the host culture: (Greek, Ottoman, Moroccan, etc.) The instruments most commonly played are plucked lutes (fretless: oud, the Middle Eastern lute; and in what is now Turkey fretted saz or sometimes mandolin or the cumbus),the Assyrian kanun or santur (plucked or hammered Middle Eastern zither), violin and hand drums (frame and goblet).

For weddings and other celebrations, musicians might also be hired from the Muslim community, as skilled Jewish musicians are also hired by the Muslim community. Generally, Sephardic men played both local percussion and melody instruments, while women usually sang unaccompanied in domestic contexts, and at weddings, accompanying their singing with tambourines and sometimes other percussion instruments. Molho describes Sephardic women in Salonica using kitchen utensils as improvised percussion, in a manner reminiscent of Spanish and Portuguese village practice today. (Molho 2021) In the eastern Mediterranean, women musicians specializing in singing and drumming for weddings were known as tanyederas, and they played a central role in wedding events. Some early 20th-century Ottoman-area Jewish schools taught &#x27;ud and mandolin to girls; and some women learned to play the piano. In any case, whether or not instruments are used, the main and always appropriate element in Sephardic music is the voice.

Sephardim, like other traditional musicians, often adapt traditional instruments to current norms; at a modern Sephardic wedding one will definitely not find any medieval instruments, but will likely hear an electronic keyboard.

==Composers==
From the sephardic music roots has grown a large corpus of original new classical music. Notable among modern composers are
*Flory Jagoda, who was known for her composition and interpretation of Sephardic songs and the Bosnian folk ballads.
*Yitzhak Yedid, who has written music mostly for chamber groups, strives to combine classical genres with improvisation on Sephardic roots and Arabic music. Yedid&#x27;s composition &#x27;Oud Bass Piano Trio&#x27; is a good example of this.
*Betty Olivero, who has taken traditional Jewish melodies – both Ashkenazic and Sephardic – and set them in complex, profoundly dissonant contexts. Her work &quot;Serafim,&quot; for soprano, clarinet, violin, cello and piano is a good example of this.
*Tsippi Fleischer, who has composed vocal works that merge contemporary Western compositional techniques with the modal, quartertone scales of Arabic music.
*Marina Toshich, Bosnian-born Israeli contemporary composer and oud player who uses Sephardi elements from her homeland Bosnia. She has also published Oud educational books in USA (Mel Bays).
*Rabbi Simon Benzaquen from the Djudeo Espanyol Hip-Hop band Los Serenos Sefarad, who has composed rap lyrics to update Old Romanzas.

<doc id="414255" wikidata="Q848127" url="?curid=414255" title="Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture">
<text>Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture is an autonomous prefecture in northern Xinjiang, China. Its capital is Yining, also known as Ghulja or Kulja. Covering an area of 268,591 square kilometres (16.18 per cent of Xinjiang), Ili Prefecture shares a -long border with Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Russia. There are nine ports of entry in Ili Prefecture at the national level, notably Khorgas. Directly administered regions () within the prefecture cover 56,622 square kilometres (21.08 per cent of Ili&#x27;s total area) and have a population of 4,930,600 (63.95 per cent of Ili&#x27;s registered population). Kazakhs are the second largest ethnicity in the prefecture after the Han Chinese, and make up a little over a quarter of the population.

Ili is the only prefecture-level division that has other prefecture-level divisions (Altay and Tacheng Prefectures) under its administration. The term &quot;sub-provincial autonomous prefecture&quot; () has often been applied to Ili, but it has no legal basis under Chinese law and is a misnomer.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Before the advent of the Qin dynasty (221BC – 206BC), Ili was inhabited by the Wusuns, a tributary tribe of the Huns. The Wusuns were driven away in the 6th century AD by the northern Xiongnu, who established the First Turkic Khaganate in 552. The area later became a dependency of Dzungaria. During the Tang dynasty (618–907), the khanate became the Protectorate General to Pacify the West of the Tang Empire.

Ili came under the control of the Uyghur Khaganate in the 8th and 9th centuries, the Qara Khitai in the 12th century, and Genghis Khan in the 13th century. The Oirats, specifically the Dzungars, conquered Ili at the end of the 16th or the beginning of the 17th century.

=== Qing dynasty ===
The Dzungar Khanate controlled both Dzungaria and the Ili basin until 1755, when the region was conquered by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty under the Qianlong Emperor. Having defeated the Dzungars in the Dzungarian and Ili basins, as well as the Afaqi Khojas in Kashgaria, the Qing court decided to make the Ili basin the main base of their control in Xinjiang.

In the 1760s, the Qing built nine fortified towns in the Ili basin:


Huiyuan Cheng, as the residence of the General of Ili, the chief commander of Qing troops in Xinjiang, became the administrative capital of the region. It was provided with a large penal establishment and a strong garrison. This city was called &quot;New Kulja&quot;, &quot;Manhcu Kulja&quot; or &quot;Chinese Kulja&quot; by foreigners to distinguish it from Ningyuan / Yining, known as &quot;Old Kulja&quot; or &quot;Taranchi Kulja&quot;.

The first General of Ili was Ming Rui. The Qing tradition, unbroken until the days of Zuo Zongtang in the 1870s, was to only appoint Manchus as officials in Xinjiang.

During the Muslim revolt of 1864, Dungans and Taranchis of the area formed the Taranchi Sultanate. Huiyuan Cheng was the last Qing fortress in the Ili basin to fall to the rebels. The Dungan rebels massacred most of the city&#x27;s inhabitants; Governor General Mingsioi (Mingxu) assembled his family and staff in his mansion and blew it up, dying under its ruins.

The insurrection led to the occupation of the Ili basin by the Russians in 1871. Ten years later, part of the territory was returned to China in accordance with the 1881 Treaty of Saint Petersburg.

In October 1884, the Qing government officially approved the establishment of Xinjiang Province and the local political system in Ili consequently went through major reforms. The Amban () and Baig systems () were abolished and replaced by circuit, urban prefecture, prefecture, and county systems. The position of General of Ili was renamed Ili Garrison General () and its responsibilities were greatly reduced. The Ili Garrison General would only oversee the military affairs of Ili and Tacheng instead of the whole of Xinjiang, the latter responsibility being delegated to the newly created position of Xinjiang Grand Coordinator (). The Ili Garrison General was based in Huiyuan Town.

Yita Circuit () was formed in Ili and Tacheng in 1888, as a subdivision of Xinjiang Province. It was headquartered in Ningyuan County (present-day Yining). Yita Circuit was divided into Ili Prefecture (), Tacheng Directly Administered Division (), and Jinghe Directly Administered Division (). Altay region was formed from Khovd (; seat in Khovd Town) in 1904.

=== Modern history ===
The Xinhai Revolution broke out on 10 October 1911. Under the leadership of Yang Zuanxu (), a general of the Ili New Army, an armed rebellion against the Qing broke out on 7 January 1912. The rebels occupied Huiyuan Town and killed Zhi Rui (), the Ili Garrison General. On 12 February 1912, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China was established in Beijing, and on 15 March, it ordered the Xinjiang Grand Coordinator, Yuan Dahua (), to end Qing rule in Xinjiang. 

With the end of hostilities between Qing and Republican forces, the position of Grand Coordinator of Xinjiang was abolished and replaced with the position of Military Governor of Xinjiang (). Guang Fu (), Zhi Rui&#x27;s predecessor as Ili Garrison General, was appointed Xinjiang&#x27;s first military governor. On 25 April, Yuan Dahua was forced to resign as Grand Coordinator of Xinjiang. On 18 May, Yang Zengxin () was recommended for the position of Military Governor of Xinjiang. On 8 July, the Qing and Republican governments signed a peace agreement, which stipulated that the position of Ili Garrison General would be replaced by the position of Defence Governor of Ili (), under the direct supervision of the Republican government in Beijing. Guang Fu was subsequently appointed as the first Defence Governor of Ili. The agreement also recognised Yang Zengxin as the top military and political authority in all of Xinjiang. 

In August 1912, the Republican government adjusted Ili&#x27;s administrative divisions. The Defence Governor of Ili headquarters were established in Huiyuan Town, the Counsellor&#x27;s () in Tacheng, and the Business Executive&#x27;s () in Altay. Yita Circuit () was retained to govern local civil affairs; it was placed under the administration of the Defence Governor.

The position of Ili Defence Governor became vacant after Guang Fu died of illness on 1 February 1914. Yang Zengxin flew to Beijing to petition the Beiyang government (Republican government) to appoint Yang Feixia () as Guang Fu&#x27;s replacement. The appointment was approved by Beijing, and the administrative jurisdiction of the position was transferred from the central government to the government of Xinjiang Province. Yita Circuit was then divided into two circuits, Ili and Tacheng, in 1916. The Circuit Governor of Tacheng () replaced the Counsellor of Tacheng () with the establishment of Tacheng Circuit.

In 1919, the Beiyang government placed the Altay Chief under the jurisdiction of the government of Xinjiang Province and Ashan Circuit () was established from the Altay region. In August 1939, by decree of the Beiyang government, the &quot;mingyan&quot; () and &quot;centenari&quot; () administrative divisions were abolished and replaced with district and township divisions. Kazakh pastoral affairs were gradually integrated into local government services.

Ili Prefecture () was established in 1943, with 11 counties and Xinyuan Division (; present-day Xinyuan County) under its administration. The 11 counties were Yining, Suiding (; part of present-day Huocheng), Khorgas (present-day Huocheng), Gongliu, Tekes, Gongha (; present-day Nilka), Ningxi (; present-day Qapqal), Jinghe, Bole, Wenquan and Zhaosu. In December 1953, the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Region was established. It was declared a prefecture-level division under the jurisdiction of Xinjiang Province, with the three prefectures of Ili, Tacheng, and Altay under its administration. Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture was created in July 1954 from the counties of Bole, Jinghe, and Wenquan, three counties of Ili Prefecture. Ili Kazakh Autonomous Region was renamed Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture on 5 February 1955.

During the Yi–Ta incident from March to May 1962, a mass exodus of 14,000 people from Ili Prefecture occurred. Chinese citizens, predominantly Kazakhs, left through the border port of Korgas, driven by deteriorating living conditions in Xinjiang and rumours of Soviet citizenship. To compensate for the loss in manpower brought about by the exodus, thousands of &quot;Bingtuan&quot; soldiers were relocated to northern Xinjiang from the region&#x27;s interior. The Chinese government also encouraged the migration of hundreds of thousands of Han Chinese youth from major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin. By 1969 the number of Han Chinese in Ili Prefecture had reached 1.2 million, outnumbering the number of Kazakhs and Uyghurs combined.

==Geography==

<doc id="414256" wikidata="Q6496282" url="?curid=414256" title="Latin American music in the United States">
<text>Latin American music has long influenced popular music in the United States. Within the industry, &quot;Latin music&quot; has influenced jazz, rhythm and blues, and country music, even giving rise to unique US styles of music, including salsa, New Mexico, Tejano, and Western. Fusion genres such as Chicano rock, Nuyorican rap, and Chicano rap have emerged from Latin communities within the United States.

Latin American music has become a powerful driver of economic growth, skyrocketing by the recent but long-overdue recognition of its cultural and global appeal. Latin American artists are not only elevating representation of their heritage and culture but are also achieving remarkable economic success while giving back and reinvesting in their communities. Prominent artists demonstrate how the industry generates billions through streaming platforms and live events. “Revenue for Latin grew about 24 percent from 2021, significantly outpacing the 6 percent growth the recording industry overall saw last year, according to the RIAA. Latin music now makes up nearly 7 percent of market share for the entire U.S. market, up from 6 percent last year.” These figures showcase the genre&#x27;s growing economic and cultural influence in the United States and beyond.

The genre of Latin American music includes music from Spanish, Portuguese, and, sometimes, French-speaking countries and territories in Latin America. While Latin American music has also been referred to as &quot;Latin music,&quot; the American music industry defines Latin music as any release with lyrics mostly in Spanish, regardless of whether the artist or music originates from Latin America or not.

==History==
For example, in the bridge of &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; (1914) with the lyrics &quot;Saint Louis woman, with her diamond rings,&quot; a habanera beat is evident, leading Jelly Roll Morton to comment, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got to have that Spanish tinge.&#x27; To capture this essence, many American bands have incorporated a conga player, maracas, or other Latin percussion instruments into their music.

The Argentine tango was a worldwide success in the 1930s. Tango dancers and records could be found from Los Angeles to Beijing. It was common in dance halls in the late 1930s and 1940s for a Latin orchestra, such as that of Vincent López, to alternate with a big band because dancers insisted on it. Latin American music was extremely popular with dancers, encompassing not only the samba, pasodoble, rhumba, and mambo but also the conga, adapted for the ballroom.

The song Amapola (Pretty Little Poppy), written in 1920 by Spanish American composer José María Lacalle García (later known as Joseph Lacalle), featured original lyrics in Spanish. It became popular, and a recorded version was later made by the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra with vocalists Helen O&#x27;Connell and Bob Eberly.

The term &quot;Latin music&quot; originated in the United States due to the increasing influence of Latino Americans in the American music market. Notable pioneers of this genre include Xavier Cugat (1940s) and Tito Puente (1950s), and its popularity accelerated in later decades. As one author explained the rising popularity from the 1940s: &quot;Latin America, the one part of the world not engulfed in World War II, became a favorite topic for songs and films for Americans who wanted momentarily to forget about the conflagration.&quot; Wartime propaganda for America&#x27;s &quot;Good Neighbor Policy&quot; further enhanced the cultural impact. Pérez Prado, known as &quot;The Mambo King,&quot; composed famous pieces like &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot; and &quot;Mambo No. 8.&quot; At the height of the mambo movement in 1955, Pérez topped the American charts with a cha-cha-chá version of &quot;Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White.&quot; In the 1950s, Perez Prado popularized the mambo, and the Afro-Cuban jazz of Dizzy Gillespie introduced many to the harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic possibilities of Latin American music, which continues to influence the genre of salsa.

Artists like Carmen Miranda and Desi Arnaz were popular with audiences of all cultures. Judy Garland&#x27;s first hit, as a member of the &quot;Gumm Sisters,&quot; was &quot;La Cucaracha.&quot;

During the 1940s, music from Latin America was introduced to large audiences throughout the United States via international radio networks such as CBS. Programs like &quot;Viva America&quot; showcased leading musicians from both North and South America, featuring performances of Mexican boleros. These programs included collaborations by notable musicians, vocalists, and composers, including Alfredo Antonini, Juan Arvizu, Nestor Mesta Chayres, Eva Garza, Elsa Miranda, John Serry Sr., Miguel Sandoval, and Terig Tucci.


Latin American music imported from Cuba (such as chachachá, mambo, and rhumba) and Mexico (including ranchera and mariachi) had brief periods of popularity during the 1950s. The earliest popular Latin American music in the United States came with the rhumba in the early 1930s, followed by calypso in the mid-1940s, mambo in the late 1940s and early 1950s, chachachá and charanga in the mid-1950s, bolero in the late 1950s, and finally boogaloo in the mid-1960s. During the same period, Latin American music mixed with jazz, resulting in Latin jazz and the fusion of cool jazz with bossa nova.

The first Mexican-Texan pop star was Lydia Mendoza, who started recording music in 1934. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the 1940s that música norteña was popularized by female duets like Carmen y Laura and Las Hermanas Mendoza, who had a series of regional hits. The following decade witnessed the ascent of Chelo Silva, known as the &quot;Queen of the (Mexican) Bolero,&quot; who sang romantic pop songs.

In the 1950s, further innovation took place in the Mexican-Texan community, with the addition of electric guitars, drums, and elements of rock and jazz to conjunto music. Valerio Longoria was the first major performer of conjunto, known for introducing Colombian cumbia and Mexican ranchera to conjunto bands. Later, Tony de la Rosa modernized conjunto big bands by adding electric guitars, an amplified bajo sexto, and a drum kit, while slowing down the frenetic dance rhythms of the style. In the mid-1950s, bandleader Isidro Lopez incorporated an accordion into his band, marking the beginning of the evolution of Tejano music. The rock-influenced Little Joe was the first major star of this scene.

The &quot;Spanish tinge&quot; was also a common feature in rhythm and blues in the 1950s. The monster hit &quot;Little Darling&quot; was driven by the clave beat, and Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Havana Moon&quot; achieved great success. Ritchie Valens, born Ricardo Valenzuela, soared to the top of the hit parade with &#x27;La Bamba,&#x27; originally a Mexican wedding song. In 1954, Andy Russell relocated to Mexico, where he became a star in radio, television, motion pictures, records, and nightclubs. The Argentinian band Los Cinco Latinos released their first album, &quot;Maravilloso Maravilloso,&quot; which found success in Latin America and the United States.

In 1963, Trini Lopez burst onto the scene with his chart-topping album, &quot;Trini Lopez at PJ&#x27;s.&quot; While performing at a popular Los Angeles nightclub frequented by Hollywood stars, Frank Sinatra noticed Trini and signed him to his own record label, Reprise Records. Trini was the first rock act on Reprise Records, which later signed Jimi Hendrix.

Trini Lopez, the son of immigrant Mexican parents, was born in Houston, Texas. He was chosen to replace Buddy Holly in the Crickets after Holly&#x27;s tragic death. Growing up in a Mexican and Black neighborhood in Houston, his father bought him a guitar to keep him engaged in a hobby that wasn&#x27;t associated with gangs. He began his career as a rockabilly artist in Texas.

After relocating to Los Angeles with the goal of meeting his idol, Frank Sinatra, he found himself at PJ&#x27;s nightclub, where he played solo guitar and sang for a year and a half. He performed popular tunes during 4 or 5 sets every night. At the time, the folk music scene was thriving, and he incorporated well-known folk songs into his sets, along with rock standards ranging from Ray Charles to show tunes from &quot;West Side Story.&quot; His infectious energy and ability to captivate an audience and get them in the party spirit were captured live on the two albums recorded at PJ&#x27;s, with the addition of drums and bass guitar.

The result was international stardom, marked by several folk-rock hits, including &quot;Lemon Tree&quot; and &quot;If I Had a Hammer,&quot; along with a sensational remake of &quot;La Bamba,&quot; all recorded live in front of the PJ&#x27;s crowd. Trini Lopez not only pioneered the folk-rock genre but also paved the way for future generations of Latin stars by refusing to change his last name when early record executives doubted that a Lopez could make a name in the predominantly Anglo radio and TV world.

He later ventured into film acting and became associated with Frank Sinatra&#x27;s Rat Pack. He was co-billed with the Beatles in Paris just two weeks before they made their iconic appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.

Similarly, the Tex-Mex and Tejano styles incorporated the conjunto sound, giving rise to important music such as &#x27;Tequila&#x27; by The Champs, &quot;96 Tears&quot; by Question Mark and the Mysterians, Sam the Sham &amp; the Pharaohs, Thee Midniters, and the various groups led by Doug Sahm, including the Sir Douglas Quintet and the Texas Tornados. The Texas Tornados included Freddy Fender, who infused Latin soul into country music. Flaco Jiménez, a member of the Tornados, is a genuine conjunto hero, a third-generation accordionist whose grandfather learned the instrument from German settlers in Texas. Johnny Rodriguez is another Latin country star.

In the modern rock and roll era, Carlos Santana featured a full-blown Latin approach. Joe King Carrasco y las Coronas play punk rock in a Tex-Mex style.

Herman Santiago wrote the lyrics to the iconic rock and roll song &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love.&quot; Another song that became popular in the United States, especially during the holiday season, is &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot; by José Feliciano.

===1980s crossover acts===
Starting in the mid-1980s, &quot;Billboard&quot; introduced the Top Latin Albums and Hot Latin Tracks charts for Latin music albums and singles. In 1980, Angélica María recorded for the first time in a U. K. studio, making an album of ballads and a single record with two pop songs in English, seeking some kind of crossover. Her singing career spans through 2013, being her most recent album &quot;With Your Love&quot;, produced by R. Levaron, and launched by Universal Music. Jose Feliciano was the very first to become known as a &quot;Crossover Artist&quot; and, along with Gloria Estefan, is among the most successful crossover performers in Latin music to date. Puerto Rico&#x27;s boy band Menudo had several Latin Hits and English songs including 1985&#x27;s Hold Me #62 on Billboard Hot 100 and #61 on Billboard Hot R&amp;B. Gloria began crossing over to English music in 1984. Estefan at the time was with the Miami Sound Machine. Their more successful follow-up album, &quot;Primitive Love&quot;, was released in 1985, launching three Top 10 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: &quot;Conga&quot; (U.S. #10), &quot;Words Get in the Way&quot; (U.S. #5), and &quot;Bad Boy&quot; (U.S. #8) became follow–up hits in the U.S. and around the world. &quot;Words Get in the Way&quot; reached No. 1 on the US Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, establishing that the group could perform pop ballads as successfully as dance tunes. The song &quot;Hot Summer Nights&quot; was also released that year and was part of the blockbuster movie &quot;Top Gun&quot;. Since then Estefan has bridged between both the English and Latin world for the mid to late 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.

===1990s Latin explosion===
In the mid-1990s, Selena was gaining prominence within the Latin American music world. Primarily marketed as a Tejano music artist, Selena&#x27;s success was met with rhythmic Cumbia recordings. After bypassing several barriers within the Tejano industry, she quickly superseded other Latin artist acts and earned the title &quot;Queen of Tejano Music&quot;. After being presented with a Grammy for &quot;Selena Live!&quot;, Selena became the first Latin artist to release four number–one singles in 1994. With a meteoric rise in popularity, Selena was presented with the opportunity to record an English-crossover album.

Months before the release of her English album, Selena was murdered by her fan club president on March 31, 1995, in Corpus Christi, Texas. Selena&#x27;s incomplete album, titled &quot;Dreaming of You&quot;, was released in July 1995, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Selena&#x27;s songs &quot;Dreaming of You&quot; and &quot;I Could Fall In Love&quot; quickly became mainstream hits, and the album became among the top ten best-selling debuts of all time along with being among the best-selling debuts for a female artist. Selena became the first Latin artist, male or female, to have ever debuted with a No. 1 album, partially in Spanish.

Despite, and perhaps fueled by, Selena&#x27;s death and crossover success, the &quot;Latin explosion&quot; continued in the late 1990s. At that time, a handful of rising stars who shared a Latin heritage were touted as proof that sounds from Latin countries were infiltrating the pop mainstream. These included Ricky Martin, Shakira, Paulina Rubio, Marc Anthony, Enrique Iglesias and Jennifer Lopez, who rendered a Golden Globe performance as Selena on film. 
Like Estefan and Selena, many of these artists, including some who recorded in English after gaining fame singing in Spanish, had been influenced at least as much by American music and culture.

In 1994, Frank Sinatra personally invited Luis Miguel to participate on a duet in the album &quot;Duets II&quot;. Luis Miguel has been dubbed several times by the press and the media as the &quot;Latin Frank Sinatra&quot;. &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot; was the song of the duet with Luis Miguel.

Ricky Martin gained success with &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot;, which Martin made a major hit in an English version when he was chosen to sing the anthem of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. &quot;The Cup of Life&quot; reached number one on the charts in 60 countries and the English version became No. 45 on the Hot 100 charts. The song went Platinum in France, Sweden and in Australia, where it ultimately became the number one single of the year. The song was awarded &quot;Pop Song of the Year&quot; at the 1999 Lo Nuestro Awards.

Martin at the Grammy Awards was booked to sing on the show&#x27;s live TV broadcast. The now-legendary performance of &quot;The Cup of Life&quot; stopped the show, earning Martin an unexpected standing ovation and introducing the star to the mainstream American audience. Martin capped off the evening by winning the award for Best Latin Pop Performance. &quot;Vuelve&quot; became Martin&#x27;s first Top 40 album on Billboard Top 200 Albums chart in the U.S., where it was certified Platinum by the RIAA. The album notably went to No. 1 in Norway for three weeks, going on to sell eight million copies worldwide.

Martin prepared his first English album in 1999, as the first and most prominent single was &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;, which reached number one in many countries around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, France, Greece, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Guatemala, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, and South Africa. He followed up with the hit &quot;She&#x27;s All I Ever Had&quot; which peaked at No. 2 on The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This album became one of the top-selling albums of 1999, and was certified seven times platinum, selling over 22 million copies worldwide to date.

Also in 1999, attempting to emulate the crossover success of Gloria Estefan, Selena, and Ricky Martin in the anglophone market, Marc Anthony released an English-language Latin Pop self-titled album with the US Top 5 hit single &quot;I Need to Know&quot; and the Spanish version &quot;Dímelo&quot;. Other hits include &quot;When I Dream At Night&quot; and &quot;My Baby You&quot;. His song &quot;You Sang To Me&quot; was featured in &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;. The successful dance version was re-mixed by Dutch producer Rene Van Verseveld. The foray was considered a mixed success, partly because it alienated his traditional salsa fans, though &quot;Da La Vuelta&quot; (not a Spanish version of any of the songs) was a salsa song and was a hit.
Enrique Iglesias had begun a successful crossover career into the English language music market. Thanks to other successful crossover acts, Latino artists and music had a great surge in popularity in mainstream music. Iglesias&#x27;s contribution to the soundtrack of Will Smith&#x27;s movie &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;Bailamos&quot;, became a number–one hit in the US. After the success of &quot;Bailamos&quot;, several mainstream record labels were eager to sign Enrique. Signing a multi-album deal after weeks of negotiations with Interscope, Iglesias recorded and released his first full CD in English, &quot;Enrique&quot;. The pop album, with some Latin influences, took two months to complete and contained a duet with Whitney Houston called &quot;Could I Have This Kiss Forever&quot; and a cover of the Bruce Springsteen song &quot;Sad Eyes&quot;. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Be With You&quot;, became his second number one.

Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s debut album &quot;On the 6&quot;, a reference to the subway line she used to take growing up in Castle Hill, was released on June 1, 1999, and reached the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one lead single, &quot;If You Had My Love&quot;, as well as the top ten hit &quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot;, and even the Spanish version of the song &quot;Una Noche Mas&quot; became a hit as well. The album also featured a Spanish language, Latin-flavored duet &quot;No Me Ames&quot; with Marc Anthony, who later would become her husband. Although &quot;No Me Ames&quot; never had a commercial release, it reached number one on the U.S. Hot Latin Tracks.

By the mid-nineties, sales of Spanish language albums in the US by such acts as Luis Miguel, Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin had increased to compete with English language acts. To reflect the growing interest in Latin acts the American Music Awards instituted a category for Latin recording artists.

Martin was seen as the forerunner of a trend in pop music of using Latin tropes which the press dubbed a &quot;Latin Pop explosion&quot; or &quot;Latin invasion&quot;.

===2000s Latin pop boom===
After the 1990s, there were very few crossover acts that became successful in the 2000s. The only ones who proved successful were Shakira, Thalía, Paulina Rubio, Jennifer Lopez and Christina Aguilera, although the latter started at first in English and then turned to Spanish. Both Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias retained their roles as one of the most successful crossover artists this decade.

Colombian singer Shakira, who had been successful in the Latin world in the late 1990s, began working on an English crossover album in 2001. Thanks to other successful crossover acts in the 1990s, the crossover of Spanish artists to the English market had a great surge of popularity in mainstream music and it was the next logical step to Shakira and her label for her career, and Shakira worked for over a year on new material for the album. &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; (&quot;Suerte&quot; in Spanish countries) was released as the first and lead single from Shakira&#x27;s first English album and third studio album throughout the period of August 2001 and February 2002. The song took heavy influence from Andean music, including the charango and panpipes in its instrumentation. Produced by Shakira, the track was internationally successful, reaching number one in most countries. It was also her first success in the U.S., reaching No. 6 on the Hot 100.

Shakira&#x27;s third studio album and first English language album, &quot;Laundry Service&quot; (&quot;Servicio De Lavandería&quot;, in Latin America and Spain) was released on November 13, 2001. The album debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling over 200,000 records in its first week. &quot;Laundry Service&quot; was later certified triple platinum by the RIAA in May 2002 (six months after the album released) as well and thus helped to establish Shakira&#x27;s musical presence in the mainstream North American market. Seven songs from the album became international singles and hit mainstream as well: &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; (&quot;Suerte&quot;), &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;, &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot; (&quot;Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)&quot;), &quot;The One&quot;, &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot;, &quot;Que Me Quedes Tú&quot;, and &quot;Poem to a Horse&quot;, with four of the singles becoming largely successful.

Because the album was created for the English language market, the rock and Spanish dance-influenced album gained mild critical success, while some critics claimed that her English skills were too weak for her to write songs for it. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated &quot;She sounds downright silly&quot;, and &quot;Shakira&#x27;s magic is lost in translation.&quot; Shakira&#x27;s Latin fans also criticized her for seemingly abandoning her folk and rock roots in favor of contemporary American pop music. Despite this fact, the album became the best-selling album of 2002, selling 13 million copies worldwide and becoming the most successful album of her career to date.

After that success, Shakira&#x27;s second English studio album, &quot;Oral Fixation Vol. 2&quot;, was released on November 29, 2005. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200, selling 128,000 copies in its first week. The album has gone on to sell 1.8 million records in the U.S., earning a Platinum certification from the RIAA. Oddly enough, the Spanish counterpart was practically equally successful snatching more than 1.5 million copies to date according to RIAA. &quot;Oral Fixation Vol. 2&quot; has also gone on to sell over 8 million copies worldwide. The album, went on to spawn two more singles. &quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, featuring Wyclef Jean, was released as the album&#x27;s second single in February 2006. The song went on to become the highest–selling single of the 21st century and became Shakira&#x27;s first number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, in addition to reaching number one in over 50 countries. Shakira and Wyclef Jean also recorded a bamboo version of the song to serve as the official theme of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

In early 2007, Shakira worked with American R&amp;B singer Beyoncé for the track &quot;Beautiful Liar&quot; which was released as the second single from the deluxe edition of Knowles&#x27; &quot;B&#x27;Day&quot;. In April 2007, the single jumped ninety-one positions, from ninety-four to three, on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, setting the record for the largest upward movement in the history of the chart at the time.
After that success, &quot;She Wolf&quot; was released in October 2009 internationally and then on November 23, 2009, in the U.S. The album received mainly positive reviews from critics, but only managed to sell 89,000 copies in its first week in the U.S., earning the number–15 spot on the Billboard 200. It has gone on to sell only 300,000 records in the U.S., becoming her least successful album there. However, the album has been moderately successful worldwide, having been certified Gold in Russia, Ireland, Switzerland, Poland, France, Argentina, Greece, and Hungary, Platinum in Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Middle East, 2× Platinum in Colombia and Mexico, and 3× Platinum in Taiwan. To date, the album has sold 3 million copies worldwide, becoming Shakira&#x27;s least commercially successful studio album so far. The lead single, &quot;She Wolf&quot; and &quot;Loba&quot; were successful worldwide, reaching number one in Latin America, number two in Germany, Ireland, Italy, Estonia and Spain, number three in Switzerland and Austria, number four in the UK, France and Greece, number five in Canada and Belgium, number six in Finland, number nine in Japan, and number 11 in the U.S.

Christina Aguilera had been very successful in English, as in 2000, Aguilera began recording her first Spanish-language album with producer Rudy Pérez in Miami. Later in 2000, Aguilera first emphasized her Latin heritage by releasing her first Spanish album, &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot;, on 12 September 2000. This album contained Spanish versions of songs from her English debut as well as new Spanish tracks. However, some criticized Aguilera for trying to cash in on the Latin American music boom at the time. According to Pérez, Aguilera was only semi-fluent while recording, but she understood the language, having grown up with her father, a native of Ecuador. He added, &quot;Her Latin roots are undeniable.&quot; The album peaked at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and went number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Charts for a record 20 weeks. In 2001, it won Aguilera a Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album. The album went Gold in the U.S. She also won the World Music Award as the best selling Latin artist that year.

Jennifer Lopez officially released her first full Spanish-language album, &quot;Como Ama una Mujer&quot;, in March 2007. Her husband, singer Marc Anthony, produced the album with Estefano, except for &quot;Qué Hiciste&quot;, which Anthony co-produced with Julio Reyes. The album peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200 and number one on the U.S. Top Latin Albums for four straight weeks, and on the U.S. Latin Pop Albums for seven straight weeks. The album did well in Europe, peaking at number three on the albums chart, mainly due to the big success in countries such as Switzerland, Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, Greece, Germany, Austria, and Portugal.

On 24 July 2007, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported that Lopez and husband Marc Anthony would co-headline a worldwide tour called &quot;Juntos en Concierto&quot; starting in New Jersey on 29 September. Tickets went on sale on August 10. The tour was a mix of her current music, older tunes, and Spanish music. In a later press release, Lopez announced a detailed itinerary. The tour launched 28 September 2007 at the Mark G. Etess Arena and ended on 7 November 2007 at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida. The lead single, &quot;Qué Hiciste&quot;, was officially released to radio stations in January 2007. Since then, it has peaked at 86 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Latin Songs and the Hot Dance Club Play. It also went top ten on the European chart. The video for the song was the first Spanish-language video to peak at number one on MTV&#x27;s Total Request Live daily countdown.

Lopez won an American Music Award as the Favorite Latin Artist in 2007. With &quot;Como Ama Una Mujer&quot;, Jennifer Lopez is one of the few performers to debut in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 with a Spanish album.

This century also saw the crossover of some of Mexican recording artist like Paulina Rubio and Thalía into the English music industry, with bilingual albums that included hit songs in English and Spanish, and the first solo English-language albums by this Mexican Pop artist. The best recording crossover artist has been Paulina Rubio with her first English-language album being &quot;Border Girl&quot; released on June 18, 2002. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot; would become her most successful song in English until her second bilingual album &quot;Brava!&quot; Two of its three singles, &quot;Me Gustas Tanto&quot; (English: I Like You So Much) and &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot;, became hits for Rubio with &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot; being Rubio&#x27;s most successful English song to date. The other singles released from the &quot;Border Girl&quot; album were &quot;Casanova&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Right Here (Sexual Lover)&quot;. Each of the main single releases, as well as other English songs on the album, have Spanish-language counterparts that became big hits on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Latin Songs chart and vice versa for songs like &quot;Casanova&quot;, which has an English-language counterpart of the same name. The Spanish-language counterpart for the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Right Here (Sexual Lover)&quot; is &quot;Y Yo Sigo Aquí&quot; (English: &quot;And I&#x27;m Still Right Here&quot;), the Spanish version of the song by Rubio, taken from her fifth studio album &quot;Paulina&quot;. Selena Gomez was recognized as the Billboard Woman of the Year in 2017.

In addition to collaborations with English recording artists like Paulina&#x27;s song &quot;Nada Puede Cambiarme&quot; (English: Nothing Can Change Me), the music video, like the song itself, wouldn&#x27;t have been complete without presence of the legendary former Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; guitarist, Slash. Thalia collaborated with legendary American pop singer Tony Bennett in the duet &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;, which featured on Bennett&#x27;s album &quot;Viva Duets&quot;, released in October 2012. Thalía&#x27;s first English-language album, released in 2003, shares a title with her 1990 and 2002 Spanish-language albums.
&quot;I Want You&quot; was the album&#x27;s most popular song, peaking at number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number seven in the Mainstream chart. It is her only song to date that has charted within the Billboard Hot 100. In Greece, the song peaked number twenty-six in Top 50 singles sales. The Spanish version of the song, &quot;Me Pones Sexy&quot;, was released for the Spanish-language audience and also performed quite well on the Latin charts, peaking within the top ten of the Hot Latin Tracks at number nine. The album&#x27;s music incorporated Latin pop styles with rock, R&amp;B, dance, and mariachi elements. Vicente Fernandez, Mexican singer of traditional pop ranchera standards and cultural icon, also collaborated with singer Tony Bennett in a duet for &quot;Viva Duets&quot; with &quot;Return To Me&quot; (&quot;Regresa a Mí&quot;).

Shakira collaborated with the South African group Freshlyground to create the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, &quot;Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)&quot;, which is based on a traditional Cameroonian soldiers&#x27; Fang song named &quot;Zangalewa&quot; by the group Zangalewa or Golden Sounds. The song was made popular in her native Colombia in 1987 through west African DJs in Colombia. The single later reached the top 20 in Europe, South America and Africa and the top 40 in the U.S., and was performed by Shakira at the World Cup kick-off and closing. The Spanish version was successful as well.

&quot;Sale el Sol&quot; was released as Shakira&#x27;s seventh studio album on 19 October 2010. It has both English and Spanish songs. Shakira and Enrique Iglesias have retained their roles as some of the most successful crossover artists this decade.

In May 2013 Christina Aguilera appeared on Mexican singer Alejandro Fernández&#x27;s cover of &quot;Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti&quot; from his album &quot;Confidencias&quot;.

===2010s continued success===
Today, Latin American music has become a term for music performed by Latinos regardless of whether it has a Latin element or not. Acts such as Shakira, Jennifer Lopez, Enrique Iglesias, and Pitbull are prominent on the pop charts. Iglesias, who holds the record for most No. 1s on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Latin Tracks, released a bilingual album inspired by urban acts, and he frequently releases two completely different songs to Latin and pop formats at the same time. Mainstream artists and producers tend to feature more on songs from Latin artists and it has also become more likely that English language songs crossover to Spanish radio and vice versa.

&quot;Viva Duets&quot; is a studio album by Tony Bennett, released in October 2012. The album is sung in English, Spanish and Portuguese, and features Latin American singers. Album&#x27;s adaptations were written by Andres Castro, Edgar Barrera, Miguel Bose, Ricardo Arjona, Kany Garcia, Thalia, Franco De Vita, Dani Martin, and Mario Molina Montez.

The 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony had performers that were dressed as several types of trees and flowers. The entire ensemble performed three separate acts leading up to the finale where the ball opened up to reveal Brazilian singer Claudia Leitte, who sang alone for a few minutes before being joined by Jennifer Lopez and Pitbull, with whom she performed the tournament&#x27;s official song &quot;We Are One (Ole Ola)&quot;, which was co-written and recorded by the three artists. Both the Cuban-American rapper and Mexican-American pop star Pitbull and Becky G were invited to perform at the closing ceremony of the Copa América Centenario soccer tournament at the MetLife Stadium in 2016. After having done English music, with only one song having mainstream success, ever since 2016, Gomez herself has released several Spanish singles: &quot;Sola&quot;, &quot;Mangú&quot;, &quot;Todo Cambio&quot;, and &quot;Mayores&quot;. Gomez has confirmed that her debut album will be completely in Spanish. Three-time Grammy nominated Miguel del Aguila has represented the cross-over between Latin and classical with his 45 CDs released and over 125 works.

Plácido Domingo Jr. is the son of Plácido Domingo who released his first album, &quot;Latidos&quot;, in Spanish in April 2017, followed with the English version, Heartbeat, in the third quarter of 2017.

In 2018, Latin music became the fifth most popular and successful music genre in the U.S., surpassing country and EDM. Nearly 11 percent of song consumption (including streams and digital sales) and 9.4 percent of album consumption (streams, physical and digital sales) in 2018 was from Latin music.

91 percent of the $135 million produced by the Latin music market last year came from either paid subscription platforms such as Spotify, or ad revenue from streaming services like YouTube.

In 2017, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee&#x27;s &quot;Despacito&quot; (which also became the most viewed video in the site&#x27;s history), was the most viewed music video on YouTube that year. In 2018, that accolade was passed on to the remix of Nio García, Casper Mágico and Darrell&#x27;s &quot;Te Boté&quot; featuring Nicky Jam, Bad Bunny, and Ozuna, which currently has 1.8 billion views. Of the top 10 most viewed music videos on YouTube in 2018, eight were from Latin music artists. The Latin pop song &quot;Havana&quot; by Camila Cabello featuring Young Thug reached No. 1 on the Hot 100.

Perhaps the biggest subgenre of Latin American Music, Latin Trap has emerged to be one of the most popular genres of music to this day. Latin Trap, also known as Spanish Trap or trapeton, is a style of trap music that is infused and influenced by Latin Hip Hop and Reggaeton.

Paving the way for Latin trap artists all over the world is Puerto Rico&#x27;s own Bad Bunny. Bursting into the music scene in 2016, Bad Bunny is a chart-topping Latin trap artist based in San Juan. With hit songs like &quot;I Like It&quot; with Cardi B and J Balvin, which became the first Latin trap song to reach No. 1 the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and &quot;MIA&quot; featuring Drake, which debuted at No. 5 on the Hot 100 in October 2018, Bad Bunny is one of the most successful Latin artists of his generation.

The 2018 Top Latin Artist &quot;Billboard&quot; award was won by Dominican-Puerto Rican reggaeton and Latin trap singer, Ozuna. Ozuna&#x27;s infectious music has put him on top of Latin song charts and was even named YouTube&#x27;s most watched artist of 2018.

Ozuna released his first studio album titled &quot;Odisea&quot; on August 25, 2017. His song, &quot;Me Niego&quot;, alongside Reik and Wisin, peaked at number 6 and his song &quot;El Farsante&quot;, featuring Romeo Santos, peaked at number 2. In his second studio album, &quot;Aura&quot;, he took part in one of the most anticipated collaborations of the year with Cardi B, and their song, &quot;La Modelo&quot;, debuted at number 3 on the Hot Latin charts. Ozuna&#x27;s most recent collaboration was with American singer Selena Gomez, Cardi B, and DJ Snake. Their song, &quot;Taki Taki&quot;, took the U.S by storm. It debuted at number 1 and then led the Hot Latin chart for 13 weeks.&quot;&quot;

The popularity of Latin music has increased over the years. While Latin music has always had a place in the American music industry, there&#x27;s certainly been a rise of the music and has become mainstream. Its high demand has helped many Spanish speaking artists. It is reaching a greater audience in the United States and outside the Spanish speaking world. The growth of Latin music has resulted for the opportunity for female Latin artists to dominate in the music industry as well. 

2018 was a breakthrough year for women in Latin music. Female artists like Dominican singer and songwriter Natti Natasha and singer and actress Becky G are a few of the young Latinas who climbed the male dominated reggaeton music charts in 2018. This was especially true after Becky G and Natti Natasha&#x27;s song, “Sin Pajamas”, ranked in the top ten most viewed music uploads worldwide, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.
Latin pop growth has helped non-Latin recording artist as they pair with popular Latin stars, thus increasing collaborations. The collaborative efforts between Spanish speaking and English speaking artist is a testament to how big the genre has gotten. In 2018, Latin pop appears to have been more traction than it did in the 1990s Latin boom. With that being said, it is a dominant force in the music industry with no signs of slowing down. 

Latin pop and other Latin music genres such as reggaeton continued to be successful in the 2020s. The Super Bowl LIV halftime show was co-headlined by Jennifer Lopez and Shakira, with guest appearances by J Balvin, Bad Bunny, and Lopez&#x27;s daughter, Emme Muñiz in 2020. Bad Bunny&#x27;s &quot;YHLQMDLG&quot; (2020) achieved the biggest streaming week ever for a Latin album in the United States. Carrie Underwood teamed up with Spanish singer David Bisbal in 2020 for a new single, “Tears of Gold.” The song marks Underwood&#x27;s first-ever bilingual single, with both vocalists singing in English and in Spanish.

Selena Gomez released her first Spanish-language project, &quot;Revelación&quot;, in March 2021. It incorporated urbano influences. Anitta&#x27;s &quot;Envolver&quot; song became the first song by a Latin female act to reach the number one on Spotify Global Daily chart, reaching the number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Global 200 and the number one in &quot;Billboard&quot; Global Excl. U.S. The soundtrack of &quot;Encanto&quot;, Disney&#x27;s 2021 animated fantasy film, written and produced by American playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda, was a viral phenomenon, enjoying widespread popularity on the internet. It has spent multiple weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. &quot;Far Out&quot; called the phenomenon &quot;&quot;Encanto&quot;-mania&quot;. The TikTok videos tagged with the hashtag &quot;#encanto&quot; have received more than 11.5 billion views in total, as of January 23, 2022. The most popular song of the soundtrack was &quot;We Don&#x27;t Talk About Bruno&quot;, a salsa tune which experienced widespread commercial success in 2022. &quot;Dos Oruguitas&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 94th Academy Awards. Christina Aguilera&#x27;s Spanish-language extended play &quot;La Fuerza&quot; (2022) debuted at number two at the Latin Pop Albums chart, and was followed by the critically acclaimed studio album &quot;Aguilera&quot; the same year.

Peso Pluma, is a breakthrough Mexican artist like we have never seen before. Releasing music on streaming services since 2020. His rise to fame was nothing of a coincidence. His art heavily inspired by Regional Mexican Music was vital to his success and a win for Regional Mexican Music lovers across the globe. Peso has made it to mainstream, and this shouldn&#x27;t be talked about lightly. Being born in Guadalajara, Mexico, Peso Pluma was set to have a disadvantage in the U.S. music scene. &quot;The general consensus within the music industry is that the boisterous rhythms, charro fashion, and gritty lyrical content associated with Mexican music holds none of the sexiness and exotic allure necessary to attract non-Latino listeners, or even more affluent and “acculturated” Latinos.&quot; Regional Mexican Music&#x27;s &quot;standing in the Latin music community is so low that Mexican regional artists boycotted the inaugural Latin Grammys in 2000 to protest their vast under-representation in the show&#x27;s award categories.&quot;

Peso Pluma&#x27;s verse on Eslabon Armado&#x27;s Ella Baila Sola (song) was the driving force that not only launched his career but shaped the future of Mexican Music on a global scale. Ella Baila Sola made history as the first Mexican song ever to score a spot in &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top 10, for a consecutive six weeks. It also charted in the Top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Global 200. This success was fueled by streaming services like, &quot;Spotify&quot;, &quot;Apple Music&quot;, &quot;Amazon music&quot;, etc. &quot;Digital technology provides new means for local artists to create music and distribute and promote it themselves. Since the introduction of the internet, “music can now be disseminated online, and people can connect easily across localities, regions, countries, and continents.” An overnight sensation, thanks to TikTok, &quot;Ella Baila Sola&quot; saw over 5 million user-generated videos, amplifying its impact.

Culturally, the impacts of Peso Pluma&#x27;s addition to the music industry are immersive, new and add a sense of ethnic identity to listeners in the U.S and beyond. “ Music is a constitutive part of culture and hence is important for individual and social identity formation. It can serve as a space and practice that binds group members together, so that they understand themselves as belonging to each other and maybe even having a specific task or mission to accomplish.” 

Grupo Frontera, an American band with deep Mexican roots. This group contains six members that were born in Texas and Mexico. Its members include: Adelaido “Payo” Solis III, Juan Javier Cantú, Julian Peña Jr, Alberto “Beto” Acosta, Carlos Guerrero, and Brian Ortega. Their sound is beloved because of their norteño cumbias and their Regional Mexican sound. Grupo Frontera was formed in 2022, and they have been paving the way for future Mexican Artists. In less than two years, Grupo Frontera made their way to the top five in the &quot;Billboard 100 w&quot;ith their collaboration with Bad Bunny “un x100to”. They made history by becoming the first regional Mexican artists to showcase their talents on the Coachella main stage during Bad Bunny&#x27;s headlining set.

==Awards==

The Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, awards Latin performers in four categories as of 2018: The Grammy for Best Latin Pop Album, Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album, Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano), and Best Tropical Latin Album. The ALMA Award, also highlighting the best American Latino contributions to music, promote fair and accurate portrayals of Latinos and was first awarded in 1995.
The most prestigious Latin American music awards in Spanish in the United States are broadcast by the two biggest Spanish networks Univision and Telemundo. Univision is the broadcaster of the Latin Grammy Awards and &quot;Premios Lo Nuestro&quot; (&quot;Our Thing Awards&quot;). Before the Latin Grammy Awards inception in 2000, the Lo Nuestro Awards were considered as the Grammy Award equivalent for Latin music. Therefore, the Lo Nuestro ceremony was advanced from May to February since the first Latin Grammy Awards were held in September 2000.

Premios Lo Nuestro was first awarded in 1989 by the network to honor the previous year&#x27;s top artists in Latin music with nominees initially selected by Univision and &quot;Billboard&quot; and winners decided by viewers. After &quot;Billboard&quot; created its own Latin Awards ceremony in 1994, the nominees and winners were selected by a poll conducted among program directors of Spanish-language radio stations throughout the United States, with results were tabulated and certified by Arthur Andersen. 
In 2004, the network launched &quot;Premios Juventud&quot; (&quot;Youth Awards&quot;), a viewer-decided awards show (similar in format and identical in target audience to the Teen Choice Awards), honoring Latinos in film, music, sports, fashion and pop culture. On August 24, 2005, Univision acquired the rights to broadcast the Latin Grammy Awards (which aired on the network for the first time exclusively in Spanish on November 3 of that year), after organizers with the Latin Recording Academy chose to end its four-year relationship with CBS, having canceled the 2001 broadcast following the September 11 attacks, were rebuffed by executives with that network in efforts to retool the show to better cater to a Latino audience. The Latin Recording Academy extended its agreement with Univision to televise the Latin Grammys for six years on June 26, 2012.
Telemundo is the broadcaster of the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine with the Billboard Latin Music Awards first awarded in 1994. In October 2015, through a licensing agreement with Dick Clark Productions signed in July 2014, Telemundo became the originating broadcaster of the Latin American Music Awards (Premios de la Música Latinoamericana), a Latin music-focused version of the American Music Awards. For the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, the academy announced several changes for different categories and rules: The category Best Latin Pop Album has been renamed Best Latin Pop Or Urban Album, and Latin Rock, Urban Or Alternative Album has been renamed Best Latin Rock Or Alternative Album
While only debuting in 2020, Peso Pluma was nominated twice and won one Grammy for Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano) for &quot;Genesis&quot;. Pluma also won Billboard Music Award for Top Latin Song &quot;Ella Baila Sola,&quot; New Artist of the Year in the 2023 Billboard Latin Music Awards.

Grupo Frontera wins Best Norteño Album for “El Comienzo” at the 25th Latin Grammy Awards. Frontera also won Best Regional Song for “El Amor de Su Vida”. This achievement marks a significant milestone in their career and further solidifies their presence as a prominent group of talented artists in the Regional Mexican music scene.

<doc id="414259" wikidata="Q132595" url="?curid=414259" title="Trichomonas vaginalis">
<text>Trichomonas vaginalis is an anaerobic, flagellated protozoan parasite and the causative agent of a sexually transmitted disease called trichomoniasis. It is the most common pathogenic protozoan that infects humans in industrialized countries. Infection rates in men and women are similar but women are usually symptomatic, while infections in men are usually asymptomatic. Transmission usually occurs via direct, skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual, most often through vaginal intercourse. It is estimated that 160 million cases of infection are acquired annually worldwide. The estimates for North America alone are between 5 and 8 million new infections each year, with an estimated rate of asymptomatic cases as high as 50%. Usually treatment consists of metronidazole and tinidazole.

==Clinical==


===History===

Alfred Francois Donné (1801–1878) was the first to describe a procedure to diagnose trichomoniasis through &quot;the microscopic observation of motile protozoa in vaginal or cervical secretions&quot; in 1836. He published this in the article entitled, &quot;Animalcules observés dans les matières purulentes et le produit des sécrétions des organes génitaux de l&#x27;homme et de la femme&quot; in the journal, &quot;Comptes rendus de l&#x27;Académie des sciences&quot;. With it, he created the binomial name of the parasite as &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;. 80 years after the initial discovery of the parasitic protozoan, Hohne declared &quot;Trichomoniasis&quot; as a clinical entity in 1916.

===Signs and symptoms===
Most women (85%) and men (77%) with infected with &quot;T. vaginalis&quot; do not have symptoms. Half of these women can develop symptoms within 6 months and can have vaginal erythema, dyspareunia, dysuria, and vaginal discharge, which is often diffuse, malodorous, and yellow-green, along with itching in the genital region. “Strawberry cervix,” occurs in about 5% of women. In men, it can cause urethritis, epididymitis and prostatitis.

===Complications===
Some of the complications of &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; in women include: preterm delivery, low birth weight, and increased mortality as well as predisposing to human immunodeficiency virus infection, AIDS, and cervical cancer. &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; can be seen in diverse locations within the body, such as,&quot; in the urinary tract, fallopian tubes, and pelvis and can cause pneumonia, bronchitis, and oral lesions.&quot;

===Diagnosis===
Classically, with a cervical smear, infected women may have a transparent &quot;halo&quot; around their superficial cell nucleus but more typically the organism itself is seen with a, &quot;slight cyanophilic tinge, faint eccentric nuclei, and fine acidophilic granules.&quot; It is unreliably detected by studying a genital discharge or with a cervical smear because of their low sensitivity. &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; is also routinely diagnosed via a wet mount, in which motility is observed. Currently, the most common method of diagnosis is via overnight culture, with a sensitivity range of 75–95%. Newer methods, such as rapid antigen testing and transcription-mediated amplification, have even greater sensitivity, but are not in widespread use.

===Treatment===
Infection is treated and cured with metronidazole or tinidazole. The CDC recommends a one time dose of 2 grams of either metronidazole or tinidazole as the first-line treatment; the alternative treatment recommended is 500 milligrams of metronidazole, twice daily, for seven days if there is failure of the single-dose regimen. Medication should be prescribed to any sexual partner(s) as well because they may be asymptomatic carriers.

==Morphology==

&quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; exists in only one morphological stage, a trophozoite, and cannot encyst (or form cysts.) This protozoan does not typically adhere to one shape, as in different conditions, the parasite has the ability to change. When in culture separate from the host, it usually displays a more &quot;pear&quot; or oval shaped morphology, but when present in a living host, specifically on the epithelial cells of the vaginal wall, the shape is more &quot;amoeboid&quot;. It is slightly larger than a white blood cell, measuring 9 × 7 μm. In both forms, &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; has five flagella – four protruding from the front or anterior of the parasite and the fifth on the back or posterior end. The functionality of the fifth flagellum is not known. In addition, a barb-like axostyle projects opposite the four-flagella bundle. All of these flagella are connected to an &quot;undulating&quot; membrane. The axostyle may be used for attachment to surfaces and may also cause the tissue damage seen in trichomoniasis. The nucleus is usually elongated, and is located near the anterior end of the protozoan within the cytoplasm which contains many hydrogenosomes (closed-membrane organelle with the ability to produce both adenosine triphosphate and hydrogen while in anaerobic conditions.) 

While &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; does not have a cyst form, the organism can survive for up to 24 hours in urine, semen, or even water samples. A nonmotile, round, pseudocystic form with internalized flagella has been observed under unfavorable conditions. This form is generally regarded as a degenerate stage as opposed to a resistant form, although viability of pseudocystic cells has been occasionally reported. The ability to revert to trophozoite form, to reproduce and sustain infection has been described, along with a microscopic cell staining technique to visually discern this elusive form.

== Metabolism ==

&quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; is an anaerobe. There is an absence of cytochrome C and mitochondria, thus making oxygen uptake and synthesis of adenosine triphosphate via oxidative phosphorylation difficult. Although it contains no mitochondria, an analogous structure called a hydrogenosome, which is the site of fermentative oxidation of pyruvate, carries out many of the same metabolic processes. Carbohydrates, specifically those with alpha1,4- glycosidic linkages, are metabolized and eventually fermented to produce products such as acetate, lactate, malate, glycerol and CO under aerobic conditions. Hydrogen is produced under anaerobic conditions. Outside the hydrogenosome, carbohydrate metabolism also occurs freely in the cytoplasm. The Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. is used to convert glucose into phosphoenolpyruvate which ultimately becomes pyruvate. 

==Virulence factors==
Although &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; exists as a trophozoite in its infective form, its amoeboid form is also an important characteristic that adds to how well it is able to infect its host. The amoeboid form, which is pancake shaped, allows for greater surface area contact with epithelial cells of the vagina, cervix, urethra, and prostate. The pseudocyst form is also a way in which the microbe can infect more efficiently, but this only induced when exposed to cold and other stressors. These various forms are accompanied with differing protein phosphorylation profiles which are triggered by environmental pressures.

One of the hallmark features of &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; is the adherence factors that allow cervicovaginal epithelium colonization in women. The adherence that this organism illustrates is specific to vaginal epithelial cells being pH, time, and temperature dependent. A variety of virulence factors mediate this process some of which are the microtubules, microfilaments, bacterial adhesins (4), and cysteine proteinases. The adhesins are four trichomonad enzymes called AP65, AP51, AP33, and AP23 that mediate the interaction of the parasite to the receptor molecules on vaginal epithelial cells. The best characterized surface molecule associated with one of the four adhesins is called &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; lipoglycans. This molecule is the most abundant on the surface of &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;, aids in sticking to vaginal epithelial cells, and can also influence how the human immune system responds, affecting inflammatory responses and macrophages in the body. Cysteine proteinases may be another virulence factor because not only do these 30 kDa proteins bind to host cell surfaces but also may degrade extracellular matrix proteins like hemoglobin, fibronectin or collagen IV.

==Genome sequencing and statistics==
The &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; genome is approximately 160 megabases in size – ten times larger than predicted from earlier gel-based chromosome sizing. (The human genome is ~3.5 gigabases by comparison.) As much as two-thirds of the &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; sequence consists of repetitive and transposable elements, indicative of a recent drastic, evolutionarily expansion of the genome. The total number of predicted protein-coding genes is ~60,000, with the genome being around 65% repetitive (virus-like, transposon-like, retrotransposon-like, and unclassified repeats, all with high copy number and low polymorphism). Approximately 26,000 of the protein-coding genes have been classed as &#x27;evidence-supported&#x27; (similar either to known proteins, or to expressed sequence tags), while the remainder have no known function. These extraordinary genome statistics are likely to change downward as the genome sequence, currently very fragmented due to the difficulty of ordering repetitive DNA, is assembled into chromosomes, and as more transcription data (expressed sequence tags, microarrays) accumulate. 

TrichDB.org was launched as a free, public genomic data repository and retrieval service devoted to genome-scale trichomonad data. The site currently contains all of the &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; sequence project data, several expressed sequence tag libraries, and tools for data mining and display. TrichDB is part of the EupathDB functional genomics database project funded by the National Institutes of Health and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

== Genetic diversity ==
High levels of genetic diversity were detected in &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; after phenotypic differences were discovered during clinical presentations. Studies into the genetic diversity of &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; has shown that there are two distinct lineages of the parasite found worldwide; both lineages are represented evenly in field isolates. The two lineages differ in whether or not &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; virus infection is present. &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; virus infection is clinically relevant in that, it has an effect on parasite resistance to metronidazole, a first line drug treatment for human trichomoniasis.

==Increased susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus==
In addition to inflammation that &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; causes, the parasite also causes lysis of epithelial cells and red blood cells in the area leading to more inflammation and disruption of the protective barrier usually provided by the epithelium. Having &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; also may increase the chances of the infected woman transmitting human immunodeficiency virus to her sexual partner(s).

==Evolution==
The biology of &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; has implications for understanding the origin of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes. &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; is not known to undergo meiosis, a key stage of the eukaryotic sexual cycle. However, when Malik &quot;et al.&quot; examined &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; for the presence of 29 genes known to function in meiosis, they found 27 homologous genes to the ones found in animals, fungi, plants and other protists, including eight of nine genes that are specific to meiosis in model organisms. These findings suggest that &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; has the capability for meiotic recombination, and hence &quot;parasexual&quot; reproduction. 21 of the 27 meiosis genes were also found in another parasite &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot; (also called &quot;Giardia intestinalis&quot;), indicating that these meiotic genes were present in a common ancestor of &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; and &quot;G. intestinalis&quot;. Since these two species are descendants of lineages that are highly divergent among eukaryotes, these meiotic genes were likely present in a common ancestor of all eukaryotes.

<doc id="414262" wikidata="Q2272069" url="?curid=414262" title="Fecal–oral route">
<text>The fecal–oral route (also called the oral–fecal route or orofecal route) describes a particular route of transmission of a disease wherein pathogens in fecal particles pass from one person to the mouth of another person. Main causes of fecal–oral disease transmission include lack of adequate sanitation (leading to open defecation), and poor hygiene practices. If soil or water bodies are polluted with fecal material, humans can be infected with waterborne diseases or soil-transmitted diseases. Fecal contamination of food is another form of fecal-oral transmission. Washing hands properly after changing a baby&#x27;s diaper or after performing anal hygiene can prevent foodborne illness from spreading..Toilet flushing &amp; subsequent inhaled aerosols is another potential route. 

The common factors in the fecal-oral route can be summarized as five Fs: fingers, flies, fields, fluids, and food. Diseases caused by fecal-oral transmission include typhoid, cholera, polio, hepatitis and many other infections, especially ones that cause diarrhea.

== Background ==

Although fecal–oral transmission is usually discussed as a route of transmission, it is actually a specification of the entry and exit portals of the pathogen, and can operate across several of the other routes of transmission. Fecal–oral transmission is primarily considered as an indirect contact route through contaminated food or water. However, it can also operate through direct contact with feces or contaminated body parts, such as through anal sex. It can also operate through droplet or airborne transmission through the toilet plume from contaminated toilets.

=== F-diagram ===
The foundations for the &quot;F-diagram&quot; being used today were laid down in a publication by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1958. This publication explained transmission routes and barriers to the transmission of diseases from the focal point of human feces.

Modifications have been made over the course of history to derive modern-looking F-diagrams. These diagrams are used in many sanitation publications. They are set up in a way that fecal–oral transmission pathways are shown to take place via water, hands, arthropods and soil. To make it easier to remember, words starting with the letter &quot;F&quot; are used for each of these pathways, namely fluids, fingers, flies, food, fields, fomites (objects and household surfaces).

Rather than only concentrating on human feces, feces from other animals should also be included in the F-diagram.

The sanitation and hygiene barriers when placed correctly prevent the transmission of an infection through hands, water and food. The F-diagram can be used to show how proper sanitation (in particular toilets, hygiene, handwashing) can act as an effective barrier to stop transmission of diseases via fecal–oral pathways.

== Examples ==

=== Transmission ===
The process of transmission may be simple or involve multiple steps. Some examples of routes of fecal–oral transmission include:
* water that has come in contact with feces (for example due to groundwater pollution from pit latrines) and is then not treated properly before drinking;
* by shaking someone&#x27;s hand that has been contaminated by stool, changing a child&#x27;s diapers, working in the garden, or dealing with domestic animals;
* food that has been prepared in the presence of fecal matter;
* eating soil (geophagia);
* disease vectors, like houseflies, spreading contamination from inadequate fecal disposal such as open defecation;
* poor or absent hand washing after using the toilet or changing diapers;
* poor or absent cleaning of anything that has been in contact with feces;
* sexual practices that may involve oral contact with feces, such as anilingus, coprophilia, or A2M.
* eating feces, in children, or in a mental disorder called coprophagia

=== Prevention ===

One approach to changing people&#x27;s behaviors and stopping open defecation is the community-led total sanitation approach. In this process &quot;live demonstrations&quot; of flies moving from food to fresh human feces and back are used. This can &quot;trigger&quot; villagers into action.

== Diseases ==
The list below shows the main diseases that can be passed via the fecal–oral route. They are grouped by the type of pathogen involved in disease transmission.

===Bacteria===
* &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; (cholera)
* &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; (pseudomembranous enterocolitis)
* &quot;Shigella&quot; (shigellosis / bacillary dysentery)
* &quot;Salmonella typhii&quot; (typhoid fever)
* &quot;Vibrio parahaemolyticus&quot;
* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;
* &quot;Campylobacter&quot;

===Viruses===
* Hepatitis A
* Hepatitis E
* Enteroviruses
* Norovirus acute gastroenteritis
* &quot;Poliovirus&quot; (poliomyelitis)
* Most human Coronaviruses are transmitted fecally including Feline coronavirus, there have also been reports of SARS-CoV-2 being found in stool samples.
* Rotavirus gastroenteritis
* Adenovirus gastroenteritis

===Protozoans===
* &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; (amoebiasis / amoebic dysentery)
* &quot;Giardia&quot; (giardiasis)
* &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; (cryptosporidiosis)
* &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; (toxoplasmosis)

===Helminths===
* Tapeworms
* Soil-transmitted helminths

=== Related diseases ===
Waterborne diseases are diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms that most commonly are transmitted in contaminated fresh water. This is one particular type of fecal-oral transmission.

Neglected tropical diseases also include many diseases transmitted via the fecal-oral route.

<text>Maurice Félix Charles Allais (31 May 19119 October 2010) was a French physicist and economist, the 1988 winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences &quot;for his pioneering contributions to the theory of markets and efficient utilization of resources&quot;, along with John Hicks (Value and Capital, 1939) and Paul Samuelson (The Foundations of Economic Analysis, 1947), to neoclassical synthesis. They formalize the self-regulation of markets, which Keynes refuted but reiterated some of Allais&#x27;s ideas.

Born in Paris, France, Allais attended the Lycée Lakanal, graduated from the École Polytechnique in Paris and studied at the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris. His academic and other posts have included being Professor of Economics at the École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris (since 1944) and Director of its Economic Analysis Centre (since 1946). In 1949, he received the title of doctor-engineer from the University of Paris, Faculty of Science. He also held teaching positions at various institutions, including at the university of Paris X–Nanterre. His first works oriented him towards the sciences of the concrete and the experiments of fundamental physics, on which he will also publish numerous works, notably on pendular oscillations and the laws of gravitation. It&#x27;s after a trip in 1933 to the United States during the Great Depression, that he decides to make the economy. Allais died at his home in Saint-Cloud, near Paris, at the age of 99.

Allais considered Léon Walras, Wilfredo Pareto, and Irving Fisher to be his primary influences. He was reluctant to write in or translate his work into English, and many of his major contributions became known to the dominant community only when they were independently rediscovered or popularized by English-speaking economists. At the same time, he claimed Keynes&#x27;s liberalism and declared himself in favor of an important public sector. Allais attended the inaugural meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society, but he was alone among the attendees to refuse to sign the statement of aims because of a disagreement over the extent of property rights. He exerted an important influence, at the end of the war, on French economists such as Gérard Debreu, Jacques Lesourne, Edmond Malinvaud and Marcel Boiteux.

Paul Samuelson said &quot;Had Allais earliest writings been in English, a generation of economic theory would have taken a different course&quot;, and felt the Nobel Prize should have been awarded to him much earlier. Assar Lindbeck, the chairman of the selection committee, considered Allais as &quot;a giant within the world of economic analysis&quot;.

==Economist==
Author of several theoretical and applied economics studies, his work has focused on the development of mathematical economics, especially in the fields of general equilibrium theory, capital theory, decision theory, and monetary policy. A pioneer in macroeconomic monetary analyses, the economist has been authoritative for his theoretical studies of risk, illustrated by his famous paradox: &quot;the less the risk is, the more speculators flee.&quot; He has also been a pioneer in various fields such as the role of central banks and the pricing of public services.

=== Inspired at first by Walras ===
His first book develops the microeconomic aspect. With &quot;Traité d&#x27;économie pure&quot;, which he wrote between January 1941 and July 1943, based on his contributions, along with Hicks and Samuelson, to the concept of neoclassical synthesis. He anticipates several of the propositions and theorems put forward by Hicks, Samuelson and others, sometimes giving them a more general and rigorous formulation. In particular, he demonstrates the equivalence theorems that Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu will find in 1954: &quot;Every equilibrium situation in a market economy is a situation of maximum efficiency, and reciprocally, every situation of maximum efficiency Is a equilibrium situation in a market economy.&quot; The market thus ensures economic efficiency and optimal distribution of income in the nation. At the same time, Samuelson exposed the process of trial and error which leads to the equilibrium of markets.

In 1947, in the second part of his work &quot;Économie et Intérêt&quot;, Allais introduced time and currency and thus tackled the dynamics and growth of capitalist economies. Again, he made several proposals, that would be later attributed to other, better-known economists. He introduced the first overlapping generations model(OLG model) (later popularized and attributed to Paul Samuelson in 1958), introduced the golden rule of optimal growth before Trevor Swan and Edmund Phelps, show that an interest rate equal to the growth rate maximizes consumption. He also described the transaction demand for money rule before William Baumol and James Tobin

He was also responsible for early work in Behavioral economics, which in the US is generally attributed to Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.
In the 1940s, Allais worked on &quot;decision theory&quot; (or &quot;theory of choice&quot;) under uncertainty and developed a theory of cardinal utility. Due to war conditions and his commitment to publish in French, his work was undertaken independently of Theory of games and economic behavior developed by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern. He formulated the Allais paradox in 1953, which questions the traditional model of rationality of choices and contradicts the expected utility hypothesis.

=== Liberalism and socialism ===
Although he participated in the Mont Pelerin Society, Allais was convinced of an affinity between liberalism and socialism, stating: &quot;‘For the true liberal, as for the true socialist, it matters little whether the means of production are privately or collectively owned, so long as the essential goals they pursue, namely efficiency and justice, are achieved.&quot; He advocated &quot;competitive planning&quot; as a &quot;possible synthesis of liberalism and socialism.&quot; Bruce Caldwell states: &quot;Allais disagreed with the group&#x27;s stance on private property, this on vaguely Georgist lines.&quot; In 1959, he and other French members of Mont Pelerin such as Jacques Rueff established an organization, &quot;Mouvement pour une société libre&quot;, which spoke readily of a social liberalism that would go &quot;beyond &quot;laissez-faire&quot; and socialism.&quot;

=== Rejection of general equilibrium theory ===
Finally he criticizes the drifts of a discipline that privileges mathematical virtuosity at the expense of realism. With this &quot;new scholastic totalitarianism&quot; he moved away, in the 60s, from the analysis of the general equilibrium developed by Walras and replace it with a study focusing on real markets rather than a utopian market, favoring the study of imbalance and based on the idea of surplus. The economic dynamics are thus characterized by the research, the realization and the distribution of a surplus and there is a general equilibrium when there is no longer any realizable surplus.

Allais&#x27;s Hereditary, Relativist and Logistic (HRL) theory of monetary dynamics contains an original theory of expectations formation that is a genuine alternative to both adaptive and rational expectations. It was praised by Milton Friedman in 1968 with the following words:
&quot;&quot;This work &quot;[the HRL formulation]&quot; introduces a very basic and important distinction between psychological time and chronological time. It is one of the most important and original paper that has been written for a long time … for its consideration of the problem of the formation of expectations&quot;&quot;.
Allais&#x27;s contribution has nevertheless been &quot;lost&quot;: it has been absent from the debate about expectations.

=== Position against globalization ===
On the first page, he dedicates his book &quot;La mondialisation: destruction des emplois et de la croissance&quot; (1990), &quot;Globalization: destruction of jobs and growth&quot;, &quot;To the countless victims worldwide of the free-trade ideology, ideology as fatal as it is erroneous, and to all those who are not blind to some partisan passion&quot;. Allais believes that Ricardo&#x27;s theory is valid only in a steady state, but disappears when the specializations evolve and when the capital is mobile.

According to him, &quot;Globalization can only bring everywhere instability, unemployment, injustices [...] and &quot;widespread globalization is neither inevitable nor necessary nor desirable&quot;. He considers that &quot;unemployment arise from the offshoring, themselves due to the excessive differences in wages&quot;; &quot;reasoned protectionism between countries with very different incomes, is not only justified but absolutely necessary&quot;; and the absence of protection will destroy all industries of each country with higher incomes.

In his opinion, crisis and globalization are linked: &quot;The financial and banking crisis which, is only the spectacular symptom of a deeper economic crisis: the deregulation of competition in the global labor market&quot;. &quot;Current unemployment is due to this total liberalization of trade[...] As such, it constitutes a major foolishness, starting from an unbelievable contradiction. Just as attributing the crisis of 1929 to protectionist causes is a historical contradiction. The true origin was already in the careless development of credit in the years preceding it.&quot;

In 1992, Allais criticised the Maastricht Treaty for its excessive emphasis on free trade. He also expressed reservations on the single European currency. In 2005, he expressed similar reservations concerning the European Constitution.

==Physics==

Besides his career in economics, he performed experiments between 1952 and 1960 in the fields of gravitation, special relativity and electromagnetism, to investigate possible links between the fields. He reported three effects:
# An unexpected anomalous effect in the angular velocity of the plane of oscillation of a paraconical pendulum, detected during two partial solar eclipses in 1954 and 1959. The claimed effect is now called the Allais effect.
# Anomalous irregularities in the oscillation of the paraconical pendulum with respect to a sidereal diurnal periodicity of 23 hours 56 minutes and tidal periodicity of 24 hours 50 minutes.
# Anomalous irregularities in optical theodolite measurements, with the same lunisolar periodicities.

Over the years, a number of pendulum experiments were performed by scientists around the world to test his findings. However, the results were mixed.

<doc id="414267" wikidata="Q2792361" url="?curid=414267" title="Lust murder">
<text>Lust murder, also called sexual homicide, is a homicide which occurs in tandem with either an overt sexual assault or sexually symbolic behavior. &quot;Lust murder&quot; is associated with the paraphilic term erotophonophilia, which is sexual arousal or gratification contingent on the death of a human being. The term &quot;lust killing&quot; stems from the original work of Richard von Krafft-Ebing in his 1898 discussion of sadistic homicides. Commonly, this type of crime is manifested either by murder during sexual activity, by mutilating the sexual organs or areas of the victim&#x27;s body, or by murder and mutilation. The mutilation of the victim may include evisceration, displacement of the sexual organs, or both. The mutilation usually takes place postmortem. Although the killing sequence may include an act of sexual intercourse, sexual intercourse does not always occur, and other types of sexual acts may be part of the homicide.
In 2019, &quot;Current Psychiatry Reports&quot; published a review of the recent findings on sexual homicide research and concluded that sexually oriented murderers should be viewed as a specific offender with distinct traits which requires an international reporting system. Earlier, the authors of the review reported on comparisons of offenders in the French national police database with the same conclusion.

==Characteristics==
Lust murder sometimes includes activities such as removing clothing from the body, posing and propping of the body in different positions (generally sexual ones), insertion of objects into bodily orifices, cannibalism and necrophilia, as most infamously seen with the cannibalistic lust murderer Issei Sagawa.

Most cases of lust murder involve male perpetrators, although accounts of female lust murderers do exist. In general, lust murder is a phenomenon most common among serial killers. These offenders have made a connection between murder and sexual gratification. When this type of offender chooses a victim there must be something about that victim that the offender finds sexually attractive. This attractive trait might be common among all of the offender&#x27;s victims and is called the offender&#x27;s Ideal Victim Type (IVT). There might be many potential targets that an offender passes by because they do not meet their ideal victim. Once the offender has found a victim who is ideal, they might engage in stalking or other predatory behaviors before acting out their fantasy on their victim. Fantasies are a key component in lust murders and can never be completely fulfilled. The lust killer will have a fantasy that continues to evolve over time and becomes increasingly violent as they struggle to fulfill it.

The most critical component in the psychological development of a serial killer is violent fantasy, especially in the lust murderer. Fantasies accompany &quot;intrusive thoughts about killing someone that are associated with other distressing psychopathological processes&quot;. Fantasies can never be completely fulfilled; sometimes the experience of killing can generate new fantasies of violence, creating a repetitive cycle. The purpose of fantasy is total control of the victim, whereas a sexual assault can be used as a vehicle for control. Sexual torture becomes a tool to degrade, humiliate, and subjugate the victim. Often the killer selects victims to stand as a proxy, resulting from childhood trauma. Fantasies may be fueled by pornography and facilitated by alcohol or other causes. Typically, fantasies involve one or several forms of paraphilia.

The term &quot;lust murder&quot; is also used in a related, but slightly different sense, to refer to an individual who gains &quot;sexual arousal&quot; from the act of committing murder, or has persistent &quot;sexual fantasies&quot; of committing murder, even if the murder itself does not involve genital mutilation or other aforementioned characteristics. As such, it is a type of paraphilia.

Although the dynamic of violent fantasy in lust murders is understood, an individual&#x27;s violence fantasy alone is not enough to determine if an individual has or has not engaged in lust murder. Moreover, to conclude that an individual is a violent psychopath because they have drawn multitudes of violent images is overreaching.

<text>The Ananga Ranga () or Kamaledhiplava () is an ancient Indian Sanskrit text written by Kalyana malla in the 15th or 16th century. The translators of the manuscript stated that its objective is not to encourage wantonness, but simply to prevent the separation of husband and wife.

The poet wrote the work for the amusement of Lad Khan, son of Ahmed Khan Lodi. He was related to the Lodi dynasty, which from 1451 to 1526 ruled from Delhi. This work is often compared to the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;, on which it draws.

== Overview ==
Ananga Ranga was translated and published in English by the Kama Shastra Society in 1885 under the editorship of Sir Richard Francis Burton. After his death, the manuscript of the translation and notes were burnt by his wife Isabel Burton.

<doc id="414270" wikidata="Q1160868" url="?curid=414270" title="Revolution Studios">
<text>Revolution Studios Distribution Company, LLC, operating as Revolution Studios, is an American independent motion picture and television studio headed by Chief Executive Officer Scott Hemming, founded in 2000, and based in Los Angeles, California.

The company focuses primarily on the distribution, remake, and sequel rights to titles in its library, which it continues to add to through acquisitions and new productions.

== Company history ==
On January 12, 2000, after a successful run at Walt Disney Studios, and his time at 20th Century Fox and Caravan Pictures, Joe Roth left Disney, to create a yet-unnamed venture. On February 17, 2000, Roth signed an agreement with actress Julia Roberts to star in their films as well as producing through their Shoelace Productions banner.

On June 7, 2000, Roth officially decided to name his new venture Revolution Studios and announced that &quot;Tomcats&quot; was the first film to be produced by the studio. On the same day, Revolution Studios entered into an agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment—which also owned a stake in the company—to distribute and market Revolution Studios&#x27; films. Roth owned the controlling interest in Revolution Studios. Other equity owners included Hollywood executives Todd Garner, Rob Moore, Tom Sherak and Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, as well as Starz Entertainment and 20th Century Fox. The company&#x27;s title was named after the song of the same name by The Beatles, of which Roth is a fan of. Starz owned exclusive cable distribution rights, with broadcast television licenses going to Fox.

Soon afterwards, the company expanded into television production, under the moniker Revolution Television, with &quot;Queens Supreme&quot; as its first product, followed by a deal with American Girl.

On January 5, 2005, Revolution Studios signed a television syndication distribution deal with Debmar-Mercury to market their library to syndication.

In August 2006, Revolution Studios announced that it had licensed to Universal Pictures the sequel rights to its comic-book-inspired hit &quot;Hellboy&quot; (2004). Universal released &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot; in the United States in 2008.

Coinciding with the end of its six-year distribution deal with Sony in 2007, Revolution Studios turned its attention to exploiting the remake, sequel and television rights to films in its library. Roth suddenly decided to move into a producing deal with Sony Pictures to start his own production company.

Revolution Studios produced a sitcom based on its comedy feature &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot;, which ran from June 1, 2010 to March 2, 2013 on TBS, as well as a sitcom adaptation of &quot;Anger Management&quot;, which ran from June 28, 2012 to December 22, 2014 on FX.

In June 2014, Roth announced that he had sold Revolution Studios to funds managed by Fortress Investment Group for roughly $250 million. Roth continues to serve as a strategic adviser and develops television projects for the Revolution Studios through a first-look deal. Concurrent with the sale, former Chief Operating Officer Vince Totino was promoted to CEO, and former finance executive Scott Hemming was named COO.

After the sale, the newly recapitalized Revolution Studios began adding to its library through a series of acquisitions. In October 2014, Revolution Studios acquired the foreign rights and copyrights of Morgan Creek Productions.

In October 2015, Revolution Studios acquired Cross Creek Pictures&#x27; 50% interests in feature films &quot;Black Swan&quot; and &quot;The Ides of March&quot;. Later that month, Revolution Studios purchased the eight-film Cold Spring Pictures film library, including the 2009 Academy Award nominee and Golden Globe Award winner &quot;Up in the Air&quot;.

Also in 2015, Revolution Studios announced a partnership with Universal Pictures Home Entertainment to produce non-theatrical sequels, prequels, or other spinoffs based on the titles in Revolution Studios&#x27; library.

In June 2016, Revolution Studios expanded its library to 126 films when it acquired worldwide rights to five films produced by Graham King&#x27;s GK Films: &quot;Hugo&quot;, &quot;The Tourist&quot;, &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, &quot;The Rum Diary&quot; and &quot;The Young Victoria&quot;. The rights were previously held by Dallas-based Tango Films. In January 2017, Revolution Studios returned to film production with their release &quot;&quot;, the company&#x27;s first film since 2007&#x27;s &quot;The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep&quot;.

In January 2017, Content Partners LLC and its affiliate CP Enterprises acquired Revolution Studios from investment funds managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group for an undisclosed price.

== Corporate partnerships ==
In October 2014, Revolution Studios forged a global licensing pact with Miramax, wherein the latter company would sell the worldwide television and digital distribution rights to Revolution Studios&#x27; library. Miramax has been handling U.S. sales of the Revolution Studios library since June 2012.

In May 2016, Revolution Studios announced that it had made a seven-figure investment for a stake in Spanish-language digital services company Latin Everywhere, agreeing to license Spanish-dubbed versions of its library titles to Latin Everywhere&#x27;s video streaming platform Pongalo (Spanish for &quot;play it&quot;).

In October 2019, Revolution Studios signed a worldwide television and digital distribution deal with Sony Pictures Television, covering the Revolution Studios and Morgan Creek libraries.

<text>Abū Isḥāq Ibrāhīm ibn Yaḥyā al-Naqqāsh al-Zarqālī [[Banu Tujib|al-Tujibi]] (); also known as Al-Zarkali or Ibn Zarqala (1029–1100), was an Arab maker of astronomical instruments and an astrologer from the western part of the Islamic world.

Although his name is conventionally given as al-Zarqālī, it is probable that the correct form was al-Zarqālluh. In Latin he was referred to as Arzachel or Arsechieles, a modified form of &quot;Arzachel&quot;, meaning &#x27;the engraver&#x27;. He lived in Toledo, Al-Andalus before moving to Córdoba later in his life. His works inspired a generation of Islamic astronomers in Al-Andalus, and later, after being translated, were very influential in Europe. His invention of the Saphaea (a perfected astrolabe) proved very popular and was widely used by navigators until the 16th century.

The crater Arzachel on the Moon is named after him.

==Life==
Al-Zarqālī, of Arab origin, was born in a village near the outskirts of Toledo, the then capital of the newly established Taifa of Toledo. He started work after 1048 under Said al-Andalusi for the Emir Al-Mamun of Toledo and also under Al-Mu&#x27;tamid of the Taifa of Seville. Assuming a leading position under Said, Al-Zarqālī conducted solar observations for 25 years from 1050.

He was trained as a metalsmith and due to his skills he was nicknamed &quot;Al-Nekkach&quot; &quot;the engraver of metals&quot;. His Latinized name, &#x27;Arzachel&#x27; is formed from the Arabic &quot;al-Zarqali al-Naqqash&quot;, meaning &#x27;the engraver&#x27;.

He was particularly talented in geometry and astronomy. He is known to have taught and visited Córdoba on various occasions, and his extensive experience and knowledge eventually made him the foremost astronomer of his time. Al-Zarqālī was also an inventor, and his works helped to put Toledo on the intellectual center of Al-Andalus. He is also referred to in the works of Chaucer, as &#x27;Arsechieles&#x27;.

In the year 1085, Toledo was taken by the Christian king of Castile Alfonso VI. Al-Zarqālī and his colleagues, such as Al-Waqqashi (1017–1095) had to flee. It is unknown whether the aged Al-Zarqālī fled to Cordoba or died in a Moorish refugee camp.

His works influenced Ibn Bajjah (Avempace), Ibn Tufail (Abubacer), Ibn Rushd (Averroës), Ibn al-Kammad, Ibn al-Haim al-Ishbili and Nur ad-Din al-Betrugi (Alpetragius).

In the 12th century, Gerard of Cremona translated al-Zarqali&#x27;s works into Latin. He referred to Al-Zarqali as an astronomer and magician. wrote a book in the 15th century on the advantages of the Sahifah al-Zarqalia. In 1530, the German scholar Jacob Ziegler wrote a commentary on one of al-Zarqali&#x27;s works. In his &quot;De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium&quot;, in the year 1530, Nicolaus Copernicus quotes the works of al-Zarqali and Al-Battani.

==Science==
===Instruments===
Al-Zarqālī wrote two works on the construction of an instrument (an equatorium) for computing the position of the planets using diagrams of the Ptolemaic model. These works were translated into Spanish in the 13th century by order of King Alfonso X in a section of the &quot;Libros del Saber de Astronomia&quot; entitled the &quot;Libros de las laminas de los vii planetas&quot;.

He also invented a perfected kind of astrolabe known as &quot;the tablet of al-Zarqālī&quot; (al-ṣafīḥā al-zarqāliyya), which was famous in Europe under the name &quot;Saphaea&quot;.

There is a record of an al-Zarqālī who built a water clock, capable of determining the hours of the day and night and indicating the days of the lunar months. According to a report found in al-Zuhrī&#x27;s &quot;Kitāb al-Juʿrāfīyya&quot;, his name is given as Abū al-Qāsim bin ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, also known as al-Zarqālī, which has made some historians think that this is a different person.

===Theory===
Al-Zarqali corrected geographical data from Ptolemy and Al-Khwarizmi. Specifically, he corrected Ptolemy&#x27;s estimate of the width of the Mediterranean Sea from 62 degrees to the correct value of 42 degrees. In his treatise on the solar year, which survives only in a Hebrew translation, he was the first to demonstrate the motion of the solar apogee relative to the fixed background of the stars. He measured its rate of motion as 12.04 arcseconds per year, which is remarkably close to the modern calculation of 11.77 arcseconds. Al-Zarqālī&#x27;s model for the motion of the Sun, in which the center of the Sun&#x27;s deferent moved on a small, slowly rotating circle to reproduce the observed motion of the solar apogee, was discussed in the thirteenth century by Bernard of Verdun and in the fifteenth century by Regiomontanus and Peurbach. In the sixteenth century Copernicus employed this model, modified to heliocentric form, in his &quot;De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium&quot;.

===Tables of Toledo===
Al-Zarqālī also contributed to the famous &quot;Tables of Toledo&quot;, an adaptation of earlier astronomical data by Al-Khwarizmi and Al-Battani, to locate the coordinates of Toledo. His zij and almanac were translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the 12th century, and contributed to the rebirth of a mathematically based astronomy in Christian Europe and were later incorporated into the &quot;Tables of Toledo&quot; in the 12th century and the &quot;Alfonsine tables&quot; in the 13th century.

Famous as well for his own &quot;Book of Tables&quot;, of which many had been compiled. Al-Zarqālī&#x27;s almanac contained tables which allowed one to find the days on which the Coptic, Roman, lunar, and Persian months begin, other tables which give the position of planets at any given time, and still others facilitating the prediction of solar and lunar eclipses. This almanac that he compiled directly provided &quot;the positions of the celestial bodies and need no further computation&quot;, it further simplifies longitudes using planetary cycles of each planet. The work provided the true daily positions of the sun for four Julian years from 1088 to 1092, the true positions of the five planets every 5 or 10 days over a period of 8 years for Venus, 79 years for Mars, and so forth, as well as other related tables.

In designing an instrument to deal with Ptolemy&#x27;s complex model for the planet Mercury, in which the center of the deferent moves on a secondary epicycle, al-Zarqālī noted that the path of the center of the primary epicycle is not a circle, as it is for the other planets. Instead it is approximately oval and similar to the shape of a pignon (or pine nut). Some writers have misinterpreted al-Zarqālī&#x27;s description of an earth-centered oval path for the center of the planet&#x27;s epicycle as an anticipation of Johannes Kepler&#x27;s sun-centered elliptical paths for the planets. Although this may be the first suggestion that a conic section could play a role in astronomy, al-Zarqālī did not apply the ellipse to astronomical theory and neither he nor his Iberian or Maghrebi contemporaries used an elliptical deferent in their astronomical calculations.

<doc id="414273" wikidata="Q583232" url="?curid=414273" title="Mesonephric duct">
<text>The mesonephric duct, also known as the Wolffian duct, archinephric duct, Leydig&#x27;s duct or nephric duct, is a paired organ that develops in the early stages of embryonic development in humans and other mammals. It is an important structure that plays a critical role in the formation of male reproductive organs. The duct is named after Caspar Friedrich Wolff, a German physiologist and embryologist who first described it in 1759.

During embryonic development, the mesonephric ducts form as a part of the urogenital system.

== Structure ==
The mesonephric duct connects the primitive kidney, the &quot;mesonephros&quot;, to the cloaca. It also serves as the primordium for male urogenital structures including the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles.

== Development ==
In both males and females, the mesonephric ducts develop into the trigone of urinary bladder, a part of the bladder wall, but the sexes differentiate in other ways during development of the urinary and reproductive organs.

=== Male ===

In a male, they develop into a system of connected organs between the efferent ducts of the testis and the prostate, namely the epididymis, the vas deferens, and the seminal vesicle. The prostate forms from the urogenital sinus and the efferent ducts form from the mesonephric tubules.

For this, it is critical that the ducts are exposed to testosterone during embryogenesis. Testosterone binds to and activates androgen receptor, affecting intracellular signals and modifying the expression of numerous genes.

In the mature male, the function of this system is to store and mature sperm, and provide accessory semen fluid.The mesonephric duct (precursor of the male reproductive system) forms around the 3-4th week of pregnancy, present before the paramesonephric duct (precursor of the female reproductive system).

=== Female ===

In the female, with the absence of anti-Müllerian hormone secretion by the Sertoli cells and subsequent Müllerian apoptosis, the mesonephric ducts regress, although inclusions may persist. The vestigial epoophoron arises from these ducts. Also, lateral to the wall of the vagina, a Gartner&#x27;s duct could develop as a remnant.

== Function ==

=== Sexual differentiation ===
==History==
It is named after Caspar Friedrich Wolff who described the mesonephros and its ducts in his dissertation in 1759.

<doc id="414275" wikidata="Q1045608" url="?curid=414275" title="Prefecture (China)">
<text>Prefectures are one of four types of prefecture-level divisions in China, the second-level administrative division in the country. While at one time prefectures were the most common prefecture-level division, they are in the process of being abolished and only seven formally-designated prefectures remain. 

The term &quot;prefecture&quot; is also used as a translation of three unrelated types of administrative divisions that were historically in use in China: the &quot;xian&quot;, the &quot;zhou&quot;, and the &quot;fu&quot;.

==Modern prefectures==
Prefectures are administrative subdivisions of provincial-level divisions. The constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China does not endorse any prefecture-level division, except for autonomous prefectures. Prefectures and leagues are not at all mentioned; provinces are explicitly stated to be divided directly into counties.

The administrative commission () is an administrative branch office with the rank of a national ministerial department () and dispatched by the higher-level provincial government. The leader of the prefecture government, titled as prefectural administrative commissioner (), is appointed by the provincial government. Instead of local people&#x27;s congresses, the prefecture&#x27;s working commission of the standing committee of the provincial people&#x27;s congress is dispatched and supervises the prefecture governments but can not elect or dismiss prefecture governments. The prefecture&#x27;s working committee of the provincial committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPCC) is a part of the prefecture&#x27;s committee of the CPPCC. This means that the prefecture&#x27;s working committee of the CPPCC is a branch of the provincial committee of the CPPCC, not an individual society entity. The same is valid for provincial CPPCCs, which are formally sections of the national CPPCC.

The term &quot;prefecture&quot; derives from the former circuit, which was a level between provinces and the counties during the Qing dynasty. In 1928, the government of the Republic of China abolished circuits and provinces began to administer counties directly; however, this reform was soon found unfeasible because some provinces had hundreds of counties. Consequently, in 1932, provinces were again subdivided into several prefectures, and regional administrative offices were set up.

===List of prefectures===
==Historical prefectures==
In general the word &quot;prefecture&quot; is applied to &quot;xian&quot; for the period before the Sui and Tang dynasties; for the period after, &quot;xian&quot; are called &quot;districts&quot; or &quot;counties&quot;, while &quot;prefectures&quot; refer to &quot;zhou&quot; and &quot;fu&quot;.

===&quot;Xian&quot;===

&quot;Xian&quot; (/) were first established during the Warring States period, and have existed continuously ever since. Today, they continue to form an important part of the political divisions of China.

&quot;Xian&quot; has been translated using several English language terms. In the context of ancient history, &quot;district&quot; and &quot;prefecture&quot; are the most commonly used terms, while &quot;county&quot; is generally used for more contemporary contexts.

===&quot;Zhou&quot;===
&quot;Zhou&quot; () were first established during the Han dynasty, and were abolished only with the establishment of the Republic of China.

&quot;Zhou&quot; is generally translated as &quot;province&quot; or &quot;region&quot; for the period before the Sui dynasty, and &quot;prefecture&quot; for the period from the Sui dynasty onwards.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China has revived the word &quot;zhou&quot; as part of the term &quot;zizhizhou&quot; (), which is translated as &quot;autonomous prefectures&quot;, as described above.

===&quot;Fu&quot;===
&quot;Fu&quot; () were first established during the Tang dynasty, and were also abolished with the establishment of the Republic of China.

During the Tang and Song dynasties, the term was mainly applied to prefectures with major urban centers. For this period, it is often translated as &quot;urban prefecture&quot; or &quot;superior prefecture&quot;. Later, however, most first-level prefectures under provinces would become known as &quot;fu&quot;.

<text>Eligius (; 11 June 588 – 1 December 660), venerated as Saint Eligius, was a Frankish goldsmith, courtier, and bishop who was chief counsellor to Dagobert I and later Bishop of Noyon–Tournai. His deeds were recorded in &quot;Vita Sancti Eligii&quot;, written by his friend Audoin of Rouen.

Born into a Gallo-Roman family, Eligius found success as a goldsmith at the Merovingian royal court of Clotaire II and served as chief counsellor to Dagobert I until Dagobert&#x27;s death in 639. Under the subsequent regency of Nanthild, the queen consort, Eligius was ordained a priest and campaigned against simony in the Church. Appointed Bishop of Noyon–Tournai in 642, he founded many monasteries and churches while working to convert the pagan population of Flanders to Christianity.

Despite his background as a goldsmith, Eligius became increasingly ascetic during his time at the royal court and used his influence to ransom captive slaves and care for the poor. A legend emerged of him once healing a demon-possessed horse by amputating and miraculously re-attaching the horse&#x27;s foreleg.

Eligius is best known for being the patron saint of horses and those who work with them. He is also the patron saint of goldsmiths, metalworkers, coin collectors, veterinarians, and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME), a corps of the British Army.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Eligius was born into a Gallo-Roman family at the villa of Chaptelat, Aquitaine (modern-day France), six miles north of Limoges. His father, recognising unusual talent in his son, sent him to the goldsmith Abbo, master of the mint at Limoges. Later Eligius went to Neustria, the palace of the Franks, where he worked under Babo, the royal treasurer, on whose recommendation Clotaire II, king of the Franks, is said to have commissioned Eligius to make a throne of gold adorned with precious stones.

Among other goldsmithing work soon entrusted to Eligius were the bas-reliefs for the tomb of Germain, Bishop of Paris. Clotaire took Eligius into the royal household and appointed him master of the mint at Marseilles.

===Chief counsellor to Dagobert I: 629–639===
After the death of Clotaire in 629, his son Dagobert I appointed Eligius his chief counsellor. Eligius&#x27; reputation spread rapidly, to the extent that ambassadors first sought him out for his counsel and to pay their respects to him before going to the king. He made some enemies. Eligius was able to induce Judicael to make a pact with Dagobert at a meeting at the king&#x27;s villa of Creil (636–37); this success increased his influence: 
Eligius took advantage of this royal favour to obtain alms for the poor and to ransom captive Romans, Gauls, Bretons, Moors and especially Saxons, who were arriving daily at the slave market in Marseilles. He founded several monasteries, and with the king&#x27;s consent, sent his servants through towns and villages to take down the bodies of criminals who had been executed and give them decent burial.

Eligius was a source of edification at the royal court, where he and his friend Audoin of Rouen lived according to the strict Irish monastic rule that had been introduced into Gaul by Columbanus. Eligius introduced this rule, either entirely or in part, into the monastery of Solignac near Limoges, which he founded in 632 at a villa he had purchased, and also at the convent he founded at Paris, where three hundred virgins were under the guidance of the Abbess Aurea. He also built the basilica of St. Paul and restored the basilica at Paris that was devoted to Martial, the patron bishop-saint of Limoges. Eligius also erected several fine tombs in honour of the relics of Martin of Tours, the national saint of the Franks, and Denis, who was chosen patron saint by the king.

===Service under Nanthild: 639–642===
On the death of Dagobert in 639, the queen consort Nanthild took the reins of government, the king Clovis II being a child. During this regency, Eligius was ordained into the priesthood in 640. He then launched a successful campaign against simony in the Church which resulted in a royal order banning the sale of pontifical offices and mandating that such offices be earned through having good character and an ethical life.

===Bishop of Noyon–Tournai: 642–660===
On the death of Acarius, Bishop of Noyon–Tournai, on 14 March 642, Eligius was made his successor, with the unanimous approbation of clergy and people. &quot;So the unwilling goldsmith was tonsured and constituted guardian of the towns or municipalities of Vermandois which include the metropolis, Tournai, which was once a royal city, and Noyon and Ghent and Kortrijk of Flanders.&quot;

The inhabitants of his new diocese were pagans for the most part. He undertook the conversion of the Flemings, Frisians, Suevi, and the other Germanic tribes along the North Sea coast. He made frequent missionary excursions and also founded a great many monasteries and churches. In his own episcopal city of Noyon he built and endowed a nunnery for virgins. After the finding of the body of Quentin of Amiens, Eligius erected in the saint&#x27;s honour a church to which was joined a monastery under Irish rule. He also discovered the bodies of Piatus of Tournai and his martyred companions, and in 654 removed the remains of Fursey, the celebrated Irish missionary (died 650).

===Legend of the shoeing of the horse===
There is a legend that Eligius resolved the problem of a horse reluctant to be shod. He thought it was possessed by demons, so he cut off the horse&#x27;s foreleg and, while the horse stood on the remaining three legs and watched, he re-shod the hoof on the amputated leg, before miraculously re-attaching the leg to the horse.

===Death and legacy===
Eligius died on 1 December 660 and was buried at Noyon.

Audoin of Rouen recorded the life and deeds of Eligius in his hagiography, &quot;Vita Sancti Eligii&quot;. At one point, Audoin lovingly recalls Eligius&#x27; increasingly ascetical appearance during their time serving at the royal court:

Besides Eligius&#x27; self-mortification, Audoin recalls his propensity for weeping, &quot;For he had the great grace of tears.&quot;

Several writings of Eligius have survived: a sermon in which he combats the pagan practices of his time, a homily on the Last Judgment and a letter written in 645 in which he begs for the prayers of Bishop Desiderius of Cahors. There are fourteen other pseudepigraphical homilies that are no longer attributed to him. An important study about his work as a goldsmith was contributed by the German scholar Hayo Vierck to the &quot;Joachim Werner Festschrift&quot; in 1974.

==Veneration==

The feast day of Eligius is celebrated on 1 December. Eligius is particularly honored in Flanders, in the province of Antwerp, and at Tournai, Kortrijk, Ghent, Bruges, and Douai. During the Middle Ages his relics were the object of special veneration and were repeatedly divided and transferred to other resting places, in 881, 1066, 1137, 1255, and 1306. A good deal of legend has gathered around the life of Eligius, who is still very popular with goldsmiths, farriers and car mechanics.

== Patronage ==
Eligius is the patron saint of horses and cattle and is also the patron saint of goldsmiths, blacksmiths, metalworkers in general, numismatists/coin collectors and the British Army corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME).

A mass is celebrated around 9 December at Notre Dame de Paris for members of the Confraternity of Saint Éloi. This follows the tradition of the May offering, usually a religious painting, made to the Cathedral between 1630 and 1707 by the goldsmiths of Paris. The tradition of the Guild Chapel was revived in 1953 by the Paris goldsmiths who provided the altar, crucifix above it and a statue of Eligius.

==Iconography==
Eligius is invariably depicted in bishop&#x27;s garb, alongside his emblem, a goldsmith&#x27;s hammer. The only exceptions are the illustrations to &quot;Vita Sancti Eligii&quot; that depict episodes before his investiture as bishop. He is generally represented as a bishop, a crosier in his right hand, holding a miniature church of chased gold in the open palm of his left hand.

The Petrus Christus panel of 1449 illustrating this article, since the removal of its overpainted halo in 1993, is now recognised in the Lehman Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as the &quot;Vocational Portrait of a Goldsmith&quot;, and not as a depiction of Eligius.

The legend of the shoeing of the horse is depicted in a pre-Reformation carving in the Wincanton Parish Church, Slapton Church Northamptonshire, England, a tapestry in the Hospices de Beaune (Hotel Dieu) in Beaune, France, as a fresco on the wall of Aarhus Cathedral, Denmark, as well as in a 14th-century painting attributed to Niccolo di Pietro Gerini in the Petit Palais in Avignon, France. The painting was confiscated from an Austrian collector by the Germans during World War II and was restituted to the heirs of the original owners in March 2013 by the French Ministry of Culture.

<text>Bad breath, also known as halitosis, is a symptom in which a noticeably unpleasant breath odour is present. It can result in anxiety among those affected. It is also associated with depression and symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder.

The concerns of bad breath may be divided into genuine and non-genuine cases. Of those who have genuine bad breath, about 85% of cases come from inside the mouth. The remaining cases are believed to be due to disorders in the nose, sinuses, throat, lungs, esophagus, or stomach. Rarely, bad breath can be due to an underlying medical condition such as liver failure or ketoacidosis. Non-genuine cases occur when someone complains of having bad breath but other people cannot detect it. This is estimated to make up between 5% and 72% of cases.

The treatment depends on the underlying cause. Initial efforts may include tongue cleaning, mouthwash, and flossing. Tentative evidence supports the use of mouthwash containing chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride. While there is tentative evidence of benefit from the use of a tongue cleaner it is insufficient to draw clear conclusions. Treating underlying disease such as gum disease, tooth decay, tonsil stones, or gastroesophageal reflux disease may help. Counselling may be useful in those who falsely believe that they have bad breath.

Estimated rates of bad breath vary from 6% to 50% of the population. Concern about bad breath is the third most common reason people seek dental care, after tooth decay and gum disease. It is believed to become more common as people age. Bad breath is viewed as a social taboo and those affected may be stigmatized. People in the United States spend more than $1 billion per year on mouthwash to treat it.
==Signs and symptoms==
Bad breath is when a noticeably unpleasant odour is believed to be present on the breath. It can result in anxiety among those affected. It is also associated with depression and symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder.

== Causes ==

=== Mouth ===
In about 90% of genuine halitosis cases, the origin of the odour is in the mouth itself. This is known as intra-oral halitosis, oral malodour or oral halitosis.

The most common causes are odour producing biofilm on the back of the tongue or other areas of the mouth due to poor oral hygiene. This biofilm results in the production of high levels of foul odours. The odours are produced mainly due to the breakdown of proteins into individual amino acids, followed by the further breakdown of certain amino acids to produce detectable foul gases. Volatile sulfur compounds are associated with oral malodour levels, and usually decrease following successful treatment. Other parts of the mouth may also contribute to the overall odour, but are not as common as the back of the tongue. These locations are, in order of descending prevalence, inter-dental and sub-gingival niches, faulty dental work, food-impaction areas in between the teeth, abscesses, and unclean dentures. Oral based lesions caused by viral infections like herpes simplex and HPV may also contribute to bad breath.

The intensity of bad breath may differ during the day, due to eating certain foods (such as garlic, onions, meat, fish, and cheese), smoking, and alcohol consumption. Since the mouth is exposed to less oxygen and is inactive during the night, the odour is usually worse upon awakening (&quot;morning breath&quot;). Bad breath may be transient, often disappearing following eating, drinking, tooth brushing, flossing, or rinsing with specialized mouthwash. Bad breath may also be persistent (chronic bad breath), which affects some 25% of the population in varying degrees.

==== Tongue ====

The most common location for mouth-related halitosis is the tongue. Tongue bacteria produce malodourous compounds and fatty acids, and account for 80 to 90% of all cases of mouth-related bad breath. Large quantities of naturally occurring bacteria are often found on the posterior dorsum of the tongue, where they are relatively undisturbed by normal activity. This part of the tongue is relatively dry and poorly cleansed, and the convoluted microbial structure of the tongue dorsum provides an ideal habitat for anaerobic bacteria, which flourish under a continually-forming tongue coating of food debris, dead epithelial cells, postnasal drip and overlying bacteria, living and dead. When left on the tongue, the anaerobic respiration of such bacteria can yield either the putrescent smell of indole, skatole, polyamines, or the &quot;rotten egg&quot; smell of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) such as hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, allyl methyl sulfide, and dimethyl sulfide. The presence of halitosis-producing bacteria on the back of the tongue is not to be confused with tongue coating. Bacteria are invisible to the naked eye, and degrees of white tongue coating are present in most people with and without halitosis. A visible white tongue coating does not always equal the back of the tongue as an origin of halitosis, however a &quot;white tongue&quot; is thought to be a sign of halitosis. In oral medicine generally, a white tongue is considered a sign of several medical conditions. Patients with periodontal disease were shown to have sixfold prevalence of tongue coating compared with normal subjects. Halitosis patients were also shown to have significantly higher bacterial loads in this region compared to individuals without halitosis.

==== Gums ====
Gingival crevices are the small grooves between teeth and gums, and they are present in health, although they may become inflamed when gingivitis is present. The difference between a gingival crevice and periodontal pocket is that former is &lt;3mm in depth and the latter is &gt;3mm. Periodontal pockets usually accompany periodontal disease (gum disease). There is some controversy over the role of periodontal diseases in causing bad breath. However, advanced periodontal disease is a common cause of severe halitosis. People with uncontrolled diabetes are more prone to have multiple gingival and periodontal abscess. Their gums are evident with large pockets, where pus accumulation occurs. This nidus of infection can be a potential source for bad breath. Removal of the subgingival calculus (i.e. tartar or hard plaque) and friable tissue has been shown to improve mouth odour considerably. This is accomplished by subgingival scaling and root planing and irrigation with an antibiotic mouth rinse. The bacteria that cause gingivitis and periodontal disease (periodontopathogens) are invariably gram negative and capable of producing VSC. Methyl mercaptan is known to be the greatest contributing VSC in halitosis that is caused by periodontal disease and gingivitis. The level of VSC on breath has been shown to positively correlate with the depth of periodontal pocketing, the number of pockets, and whether the pockets bleed when examined with a dental probe. Indeed, VSC may themselves have been shown to contribute to the inflammation and tissue damage that is characteristic of periodontal disease. However, not all patients with periodontal disease have halitosis, and not all patients with halitosis have periodontal disease. Although patients with periodontal disease are more likely to develop halitosis than the general population, the halitosis symptom was shown to be more strongly associated with degree of tongue coating than with the severity of periodontal disease. Another possible symptom of periodontal disease is a bad taste, which does not necessarily accompany a malodour that is detectable by others.

==== Other causes ====
Other less common reported causes from within the mouth include:
* Deep carious lesions (dental decay) – which cause localized food impaction and stagnation
* Recent dental extraction sockets – fill with blood clot, and provide an ideal habitat for bacterial proliferation
* Interdental food packing – (food getting pushed down between teeth) – this can be caused by missing teeth, tilted, spaced or crowded teeth, or poorly contoured approximal dental fillings. Food debris becomes trapped, undergoes slow bacterial putrefaction and release of malodourous volatiles. Food packing can also cause a localized periodontal reaction, characterized by dental pain that is relieved by cleaning the area of food packing with interdental brush or floss.
* Acrylic dentures (plastic false teeth) – inadequate denture hygiene practises such as failing to clean and remove the prosthesis each night, may cause a malodour from the plastic itself or from the mouth as microbiota responds to the altered environment. The plastic is actually porous, and the fitting surface is usually irregular, sculpted to fit the edentulous oral anatomy. These factors predispose to bacterial and yeast retention, which is accompanied by a typical smell.
* Oral infections
* Oral ulceration
* Fasting
* Stress or anxiety
* Menstrual cycle – At mid cycle and during menstruation, increased breath VSC were reported in women.
* Smoking – Smoking is linked with periodontal disease, which is the second most common cause of oral malodour. Smoking also has many other negative effects on the mouth, from increased rates of dental decay to premalignant lesions and even oral cancer.
* Alcohol
* Volatile foods – e.g. onion, garlic, durian, cabbage, cauliflower and radish. Volatile foodstuffs may leave malodourous residues in the mouth, which are the subject to bacterial putrefaction and VSC release. However, volatile foodstuffs may also cause halitosis via the blood borne halitosis mechanism.
* Medication – often medications can cause xerostomia (dry mouth) which results in increased microbial growth in the mouth.

=== Nose and sinuses ===
In this occurrence, the air exiting the nostrils has a pungent odour that differs from the oral odour. Nasal odour may be due to sinus infections or foreign bodies.

Halitosis is often stated to be a symptom of chronic rhinosinusitis, however gold standard breath analysis techniques have not been applied. Theoretically, there are several possible mechanisms of both objective and subjective halitosis that may be involved.

=== Tonsils ===
There is disagreement as to the proportion of halitosis cases that are caused by conditions of the tonsils. Some claim that the tonsils are the most significant cause of halitosis after the mouth. According to one report, approximately 3% of halitosis cases were related to the tonsils. Conditions of the tonsils that may be associated with halitosis include chronic caseous tonsillitis (cheese-like material can be exuded from the tonsillar crypt orifi), tonsillolithiasis (tonsil stones), and less commonly peritonsillar abscess, actinomycosis, fungating malignancies, chondroid choristoma, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.

=== Esophagus ===
The lower esophageal sphincter, which is the valve between the stomach and the esophagus, may not close properly due to a hiatal hernia or GERD, allowing acid to enter the esophagus and gases to escape to the mouth. A Zenker&#x27;s diverticulum may also result in halitosis due to aging food retained in the esophagus.

=== Stomach ===
The stomach is considered by most researchers as a very uncommon source of bad breath. The esophagus is a closed and collapsed tube, and continuous flow of gas or putrid substances from the stomach indicates a health problem—such as reflux serious enough to be bringing up stomach contents or a fistula between the stomach and the esophagus—which will demonstrate more serious manifestations than just foul odour.

In the case of allyl methyl sulfide (the byproduct of garlic&#x27;s digestion), odour does not come from the stomach, since it does not get metabolized there.

=== Systemic diseases ===
There are a few systemic (non-oral) medical conditions that may cause foul breath odour, but these are infrequent in the general population. Such conditions are:
# Fetor hepaticus: an example of a rare type of bad breath caused by chronic liver failure.
# Lower respiratory tract infections (bronchial and lung infections).
# Kidney infections and kidney failure.
# Carcinoma.
# Trimethylaminuria (&quot;fish odour syndrome&quot;).
# Diabetes mellitus.
# Metabolic conditions, e.g. resulting in elevated blood dimethyl sulfide.

Individuals affected by the above conditions often show additional, more diagnostically conclusive symptoms than bad breath alone.

=== Delusional halitosis ===
One quarter of the people seeking professional advice on bad breath have an exaggerated concern of having bad breath, known as halitophobia, &quot;delusional halitosis&quot;, or as a manifestation of the olfactory reference syndrome. They are sure that they have bad breath, although many have not asked anyone for an objective opinion. Bad breath may severely affect the lives of some 0.5–1.0% of the adult population.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Self diagnosis ===
Scientists have long thought that smelling one&#x27;s own breath odour is often difficult due to acclimatization, although many people with bad breath are able to detect it in others. Research has suggested that self-evaluation of halitosis is not easy because of preconceived notions of how bad we think it should be. Some people assume that they have bad breath because of bad taste (metallic, sour, fecal, etc.), however bad taste is considered a poor indicator.

Patients often self-diagnose by asking a close friend.

One popular home method to determine the presence of bad breath is to lick the back of the wrist, let the saliva dry for a minute or two, and smell the result. This test results in overestimation, as concluded from research, and should be avoided. A better way would be to lightly scrape the posterior back of the tongue with a plastic disposable spoon and to smell the drying residue. Home tests that use a chemical reaction to test for the presence of polyamines and sulfur compounds on tongue swabs are now available, but there are few studies showing how well they actually detect the odour. Furthermore, since breath odour changes in intensity throughout the day depending on many factors, multiple testing sessions may be necessary.

=== Testing ===
If bad breath is persistent, and all other medical and dental factors have been ruled out, specialized testing and treatment is required. Hundreds of dental offices and commercial breath clinics now claim to diagnose and treat bad breath. They often use some of several laboratory methods for diagnosis of bad breath:
* Halimeter: a portable sulfide monitor used to test for levels of sulfur emissions (to be specific, hydrogen sulfide) in the mouth air. When used properly, this device can be very effective at determining levels of certain VSC-producing bacteria. However, it has drawbacks in clinical applications. For example, other common sulfides (such as mercaptan) are not recorded as easily and can be misrepresented in test results. Certain foods such as garlic and onions produce sulfur in the breath for as long as 48 hours and can result in false readings. The Halimeter is also very sensitive to alcohol, so one should avoid drinking alcohol or using alcohol-containing mouthwashes for at least 12 hours prior to being tested. This analog machine loses sensitivity over time and requires periodic recalibration to remain accurate.
* Gas chromatography: portable machines are being studied. This technology is designed to digitally measure molecular levels of major VSCs in a sample of mouth air (such as hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and dimethyl sulfide). It is accurate in measuring the sulfur components of the breath and produces visual results in graph form via computer interface.
* BANA test: this test is directed to find the salivary levels of an enzyme indicating the presence of certain halitosis-related bacteria.
* β-galactosidase test: salivary levels of this enzyme were found to be correlated with oral malodour.

Although such instrumentation and examinations are widely used in breath clinics, the most important measurement of bad breath (the gold standard) is the actual sniffing and scoring of the level and type of the odour carried out by trained experts (&quot;organoleptic measurements&quot;). The level of odour is usually assessed on a six-point intensity scale.

=== Classification ===
Several classification schemes have been proposed to define halitosis.

==== Miyazaki &quot;et al.&quot; ====
The Miyazaki &quot;et al.&quot; classification was originally described in 1999 in a Japanese scientific publication, and has since been adapted to reflect North American society, especially with regards halitophobia. The classification assumes three primary divisions of the halitosis symptom, namely genuine halitosis, pseudohalitosis and halitophobia.

* Genuine halitosis
**A. Physiologic halitosis
**B. Pathologic halitosis
***&quot;(i) Oral&quot;
***&quot;(ii) Extra-oral&quot;
* Pseudohalitosis
* Halitophobia

This classification has been criticized for being inflexible, and that the pseudohalitosis and halitophbia categories contain psychopathologic connotations.

==== Tangerman and Winkel ====
The Tangerman and Winkel classification was suggested in Europe in 2002. This classification focuses only on those cases where there is genuine halitosis, and has therefore been criticized for being less clinically useful for dentistry when compared to the Miyazaki &quot;et al.&quot; classification.

* Intra-oral halitosis
* Extra-oral halitosis
** A. Blood borne halitosis
*** &quot;(i) Systemic diseases&quot;
*** &quot;(ii) Metabolic diseases&quot;
*** &quot;(iii) Food&quot;
*** &quot;(iv) Medication&quot;
** B. Non-blood borne halitosis
*** &quot;(i) Upper respiratory tract&quot;
*** &quot;(ii) Lower respiratory tract&quot;

The same authors also suggested that halitosis can be divided according to the character of the odour into 3 groups:

* &quot;Sulfurous or fecal&quot; caused by volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), most notably methyl mercaptan, hydrogen sulfide and dimethyl sulfide.
* &quot;Fruity&quot; caused by acetone, present in diabetes.
* &quot;Urine-like or ammoniacal&quot; caused by ammonia, dimethyl amine and trimethylamine (TMA), present in trimethylaminuria and uremia.

==== Aydin and Harvey-Woodworth ====
Based on the strengths and weaknesses of previous attempts at classification, Aydin and Harvey-Woodworth proposed a cause-based classification.

* Type 0 (physiologic)
* Type 1 (oral)
* Type 2 (airway)
* Type 3 (gastroesophageal)
* Type 4 (blood-borne)
* Type 5 (subjective)

Any halitosis symptom is potentially the sum of these types in any combination, superimposed on the physiologic odour present in all healthy individuals.

== Management ==
Approaches to improve bad breath may include physical or chemical means to decrease bacteria in the mouth, products to mask the smell, or chemicals to alter the odour creating molecules. Many different interventions have been suggested and trialed such as toothpastes, mouthwashes, lasers, tongue scraping, and mouth rinses. There is no strong evidence to indicate which interventions work and which are more effective. It is recommended that in those who use tobacco products stop. Evidence does not support the benefit of dietary changes or chewing gum.

===Mechanical measures===
Brushing the teeth may help. While there is evidence of tentative benefit from tongue cleaning it is insufficient to draw clear conclusions. Flossing may be useful.

=== Mouthwashes ===
Mouthwashes often contain antibacterial agents including cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, zinc gluconate, zinc chloride, zinc lactate, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, amine fluorides, stannous fluoride, hinokitiol, and essential oils. Listerine is one of the well-known mouthwash products composed of different essential oils. Other formulations containing herbal products and probiotics have also been proposed. Cetylpyridinium chloride and chlorhexidine can temporarily stain teeth.

===Underlying disease===
If gum disease and cavities are present, it is recommended that these be treated.

If diseases outside of the mouth are believed to be contributing to the problem, treatment may result in improvements.

Counselling may be useful in those who falsely believe that they have bad breath.

== Epidemiology ==
It is difficult for researchers to make estimates of the prevalence of halitosis in the general population for several reasons. Firstly, halitosis is subject to societal taboo and stigma, which may impact individuals&#x27; willingness to take part in such studies or to report accurately their experience of the condition. Secondly, there is no universal agreement about what diagnostic criteria and what detection methods should be used to define which individuals have halitosis and which do not. Some studies rely on self reported estimation of halitosis, and there is contention as to whether this is a reliable predictor of actual halitosis or not. In reflection of these problems, reported epidemiological data are widely variable.

== History, society and culture ==
The earliest known mention of bad breath occurs in ancient Egypt, where detailed recipes for toothpaste are made before the Pyramids are built. The 1550 BC Ebers Papyrus describes tablets to cure bad breath based on incense, cinnamon, myrrh and honey. Hippocratic medicine advocated a mouthwash of red wine and spices to cure bad breath. Alcohol-containing mouthwashes are now thought to exacerbate bad breath as they dry the mouth, leading to increased microbial growth. The Hippocratic Corpus also describes a recipe based on marble powder for females with bad breath. The Ancient Roman physician Pliny wrote about methods to sweeten the breath.

Ancient Chinese emperors required visitors to chew clove before an audience. The Talmud describes bad breath as a disability, which could be grounds for legal breaking of a marriage license. Early Islamic theology stressed that the teeth and tongue should be cleaned with a siwak, a stick from the plant Salvadora persica tree. This traditional chewing stick is also called a Miswak, especially used in Saudi Arabia, an essentially is like a natural toothbrush made from twigs. During the Renaissance era, Laurent Joubert, doctor to King Henry III of France stated that bad breath is &quot;caused by dangerous miasma that falls into the lungs and through the heart, causing severe damages&quot;.

In and &quot;&quot; (1919), the following recipe is offered: &quot;[One] teaspoonful of the following mixture after each meal: One ounce chloride of soda, one ounce liquor of potassa, one and one-half ounces phosphate of soda, and three ounces of water.&quot;

In the present day, bad breath is one of the biggest social taboos. The general population places great importance on the avoidance of bad breath, illustrated by the annual $1 billion that consumers in the United States spend on deodorant-type mouth (oral) rinses, mints, and related over-the-counter products. Many of these practices are merely short term attempts at masking the odour. Some authors have suggested that there is an evolutionary basis to concern over bad breath. An instinctive aversion to unpleasant odours may function to detect spoiled food sources and other potentially invective or harmful substances. Body odours in general are thought to play an important role in mate selection in humans, and unpleasant odour may signal disease, and hence a potentially unwise choice of mate. Although reports of bad breath are found in the earliest medical writings known, the social stigma has likely changed over time, possibly partly due to sociocultural factors involving advertising pressures. As a result, the negative psychosocial aspects of halitosis may have worsened, and psychiatric conditions such as halitophobia are probably more common than historically. There have been rare reports of people committing suicide because of halitosis, whether there is genuine halitosis or not.

=== Etymology ===
The word halitosis is derived from the Latin word &quot;halitus&quot;, meaning &#x27;breath&#x27;, and the Greek suffix &quot;-osis&quot; meaning &#x27;diseased&#x27; or &#x27;a condition of&#x27;. With modern consumerism, there has been a complex interplay of advertising pressures and the existing evolutionary aversion to malodour. Contrary to the popular belief that Listerine coined the term &quot;halitosis&quot;, its origins date to before the product&#x27;s existence, being coined by physician Joseph William Howe in his 1874 book &quot;The Breath, and the Diseases Which Give It a Fetid Odor&quot;, although it only became commonly used in the 1920s when a marketing campaign promoted Listerine as a solution for &quot;chronic halitosis&quot;. The company was the first to manufacture mouth washes in the United States. According to Freakonomics:

=== Alternative medicine ===
According to traditional Ayurvedic medicine, chewing areca nut and betel leaf is a remedy for bad breath. In South Asia, it was a custom to chew areca or betel nut and betel leaf among lovers because of the breath-freshening and stimulant drug properties of the mixture. Both the nut and the leaf are mild stimulants and can be addictive with repeated use. The betel nut will also cause dental decay and red or black staining of teeth when chewed. Both areca nut and betel leaf chewing, however, can cause premalignant lesions such as leukoplakia and submucous fibrosis, and are recognized risk factors for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (oral cancer).

Practitioners and purveyors of alternative medicine sell a vast range of products that claim to be beneficial in treating halitosis, including dietary supplements, vitamins, and oral probiotics. Halitosis is often claimed to be a symptom of &quot;candida hypersensitivity syndrome&quot; or related diseases, and is claimed to be treatable with antifungal medications or alternative medications to treat fungal infections.

== Research ==
In 1996, the International Society for Breath Odor Research (ISBOR) was formed to promote multidisciplinary research on all aspects of breath odours.

<text>Joseph Emanuel Roth (born June 13, 1948) is an American film executive, producer and director. He co-founded Morgan Creek Entertainment in 1988 and was chairman of 20th Century Fox (1989–1993), Caravan Pictures (1993–1994), and Walt Disney Studios (1994–2000) before founding Revolution Studios in 2000, then Roth/Kirschenbaum Films in 2007.

==Early life==
Roth was born on June 13, 1948 to Frances and Lawrence Roth. He has stated that his Jewish family faced various forms of harassment growing up in a heavily Catholic part of Long Island, New York. This involved incidents like &quot;a cross being burned on the lawn and some of Roth&#x27;s schoolmates crossed themselves before they would speak to him.&quot; In 1959, Roth&#x27;s father volunteered his son to be a plaintiff in the ACLU&#x27;s effort to abolish mandatory prayer in public schools. The case, filed in New York, went through several appeals, finally reaching the U.S. Supreme Court in 1962. The Court ruled that such prayer was unconstitutional under the First Amendment, in the landmark case of &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot;.

Roth attended Boston University, graduating in 1970 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in communication.

==Career==
Over the course of his career, he has produced over 40 films, and has directed six to date, including 1990&#x27;s &quot;Coupe de Ville&quot;, 2001&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Sweethearts&quot; and 2006&#x27;s &quot;Freedomland&quot;.

In 1988 by Roth and James Robinson co-founded Morgan Creek Entertainment. The name came from Roth&#x27;s favorite film, &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot;. The company had box-office hits including &quot;Young Guns&quot; and &quot;Major League&quot;.

In 1989, Roth became chairman of 20th Century Fox, who were very successful under him, including hits &quot;Home Alone&quot;, &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; and &quot;White Men Can&#x27;t Jump&quot;. His contract expired in July 1992 but he agreed to stay on as Fox Inc. chairman Barry Diller had quit earlier in the year. He later announced in November 1992 that he was leaving Fox to set up an independent production company at The Walt Disney Studios.

In 1992, he co-founded Caravan Pictures with Roger Birnbaum, which had a production deal with The Walt Disney Studios. Roth moved on to be Disney studio chief on August 24, 1994. Disney CEO Michael Eisner was so set on replacing Jeffrey Katzenberg as Disney studio chief with Roth that he forgave the $15 million cost overrun debt for &quot;I Love Trouble&quot; and paid Roth $40 million of fees for 21 unproduced films under the deal.

Roth, who was ranked 6th in &quot;Premiere Magazine&quot;s 2003 Hollywood Power List, produced the 76th annual Academy Awards. Roth announced in October 2007 that, when Revolution&#x27;s distribution deal with Sony Pictures ended, that he would depart from Revolution Studios to form his own production company, Roth Films.

On November 13, 2007, Roth was introduced as the majority owner of a Seattle, Washington–based Major League Soccer franchise along with Paul Allen. Seattle Sounders FC—which calls Lumen Field home—began regular season play in 2009. On November 12, 2015, Roth passed on majority ownership to Adrian Hanauer.

==Personal life==
Roth was married to Donna Arkoff whose father was movie producer Samuel Z. Arkoff. They have three children.

The family resided in the Dolores del Río House, designed by architect Douglas Honnold for Irish production designer Cedric Gibbons and Mexican actress Dolores del Río in 1929 in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California. In 2021, Roth paid $23 million for a , 1960s Midcentury home designed by Dan Dworsky and renovated by Waldo Fernandez in Beverly Hills.

<doc id="414286" wikidata="Q2192309" url="?curid=414286" title="Myrtle warbler">
<text>The myrtle warbler (Setophaga coronata) is a small New World warbler. It is considered a subspecies of the yellow-rumped warbler and its own species by different classification societies. The myrtle warbler has a northerly and easterly distribution, with the Audubon&#x27;s warbler farther west. It breeds in much of Canada and the northeastern United States. It is migratory, wintering in the southeastern United States, eastern Central America, and the Caribbean. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe, and has wintered in Great Britain.

The summer male myrtle warbler has a slate blue back, and yellow crown, rump and flank patch. It has white tail patches, and the breast is streaked black. The female has a similar pattern, but the back is brown as are the breast streaks. The myrtle can be distinguished from the similar Audubon&#x27;s warbler by its whitish eyestripe, white (not yellow) throat, and contrasting cheek patch. Their trill-like songs, nearly indistinguishable, consist of a three or four syllable &quot;tyew-tyew-tyew-tyew&quot;, sometimes followed by three more &quot;tew&quot;s. The call is a hard &quot;check&quot;.

Its breeding habitat is a variety of coniferous and mixed woodland. Myrtle warblers nest in a tree, laying four or five eggs in a cup nest.

These birds are insectivorous, but will readily take wax-myrtle berries in winter, a habit which gives the species its name. Experienced birders recognize myrtle warblers with the naked eye by their flycatcher-like habit of making short flights from their perch in search of bugs. They form small flocks on migration or in winter.

==Taxonomy==
This passerine bird was long known to be closely related to its counterparts Audubon&#x27;s warbler and Goldman&#x27;s warbler, and at various times the three forms have been classed as either one, two or three species. At present, the American Ornithological Society and Clements considers the myrtle, Audubon&#x27;s, and Goldman&#x27;s warbler three subspecies of the yellow-rumped warbler (&quot;Setophaga coronata coronata&quot;, &quot;Setophaga coronata auduboni,&quot; and &quot;Setophaga coronata goldmani&quot; respectively) while the IOC World Bird List classifies the myrtle warbler, Audubon&#x27;s, and Goldman&#x27;s warbler as separate species (&quot;Setophaga coronata&quot;, &quot;Setophaga auduboni&quot;, and &quot;Setophaga goldmani&quot;).

<text>The yellow-rumped warbler (Setophaga coronata) is a regular North American bird species that can be commonly observed all across the continent. Its extensive range connects both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the U.S. as well as Canada and Central America, with the population concentrated in the continent&#x27;s northern reaches during the breeding season and migrating southwards to southern North and Central America in the winter. It generally prefers coniferous forests or mixed coniferous-deciduous forests as its breeding habitat, while during the winter it can be found inhabiting more open areas such as shrublands that offer food resources. The yellow-rumped warbler is primarily insectivorous, though the species does eat fruits such as juniper berries as well, especially in winter.

The species combines four closely related forms: the eastern myrtle warbler (spp. &quot;coronata&quot;); its western counterpart, Audubon&#x27;s warbler (spp. group &quot;auduboni&quot;); the northwest Mexican black-fronted warbler (spp. &quot;nigrifrons&quot;); and the Guatemalan Goldman&#x27;s warbler (spp. &quot;goldmani&quot;). All subspecies of the yellow-rumped warbler are characterized by the yellow rump as its name implies, while intra-group and inter-group variations in appearance exist in spite of many similarities. The myrtle and Audubon&#x27;s groups, as two major subspecies, are distinguished by noticeable features such as differing throat colorations.

==Etymology==

The genus name &quot;Setophaga&quot; is from ancient Greek &quot;ses&quot;, &quot;moth&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, &quot;eating&quot;, and the specific &quot;coronata&quot; means &quot;crowned&quot;.

==Classification==
Since 1973, the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union has elected to merge these passerine birds as one species. A 2017 proposal to split the yellow-rumped warbler into separate species failed. By contrast, the IOC World Bird List classifies the myrtle, Audubon&#x27;s, and Goldman&#x27;s as separate species (&quot;Setophaga coronata&quot;, &quot;Setophaga auduboni&quot;, and &quot;Setophaga goldmani&quot;, respectively), and the black-fronted warbler as a subspecies of &quot;S. auduboni&quot;. Its proper taxonomy remains a matter of debate.

The myrtle form was apparently separated from the others by glaciation during the Pleistocene, and the Audubon&#x27;s form may have originated more recently through hybridization between the myrtle warbler and the Mexican &quot;nigrifrons&quot; form.

==Distribution==

The yellow-rumped warbler breeds from eastern North America west to the Pacific, and southward from there into Western Mexico. Goldman&#x27;s yellow-rumped warbler is a non-migratory endemic within the highlands of Guatemala, and the black-fronted warbler is a non-migratory Mexican endemic. The myrtle and Audubon&#x27;s forms are migratory, wintering in the southern U.S., Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.

The breeding area of the myrtle warbler ranges from Alaska across Canada to Newfoundland, and as far south as New England and Virginia, including throughout the northern Great Lakes region. Myrtle warblers migrate south for the winter, ranging from southern British Columbia all the way to Panama and throughout most of the southeastern United States.

Audubon&#x27;s warbler breeds throughout western North America, from British Columbia to California, across the Rocky Mountains and as far east as the Dakotas. Among warblers, the Audubon&#x27;s is by far the most widespread in North America in winter, being among the last to leave in the fall and among the first to return in spring.

==Habitat==

=== Habitat in breeding range ===
During the breeding season, the yellow-rumped warbler is generally known to be residing in either exclusively coniferous areas across the North American continent, or mixed coniferous-deciduous habitats where coniferous forests merge with trees like aspen (&quot;Populus&quot; spp.) and willow (&quot;Salix&quot; spp.), etc. Many of its habitats in the western U.S. tend to be mountainous, but it can also inhabit places at the sea level as long as there are conifers present—which is the case of its habitats in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast of the United States. Studies indicate that the yellow-rumped warbler is generally adaptive to changes in its breeding habitat&#x27;s tree density (usually as a result of selective logging), as its population densities are found to remain largely unaffected in areas where the logging regime leads to decreasing densities of trees; the yellow-rumped warbler is believed to be capable of maintaining its breeding density in habitats as long as there still exists some mature trees, which may be used for nesting. The nest of the Audubon&#x27;s warbler group is known to have the shape of a deep cup: its frame is built out of twigs, barks, and fiber, etc.; the surrounding rim of the &quot;cup&quot; is woven by softer materials such as grass, hair, and feather, etc., structured in a way to conceal the eggs from predators when parent warblers are absent from the nest.

=== Habitat in non-breeding range ===
During the winter, when the yellow-rumped warbler is not in breeding season, it often inhabits resourceful open areas with shrubs or scattered trees which can provide it with some source of food, such as bayberries or insects. Open areas preferred by the yellow-rumped warbler may include agricultural and residential areas, secondary forests, and shrublands, as these habitats generally do not have very dense vegetation; the species can also inhabit forests that are relatively open, such as mangroves, pine forests, and even coffee plantations. The yellow-rumped warbler tends to occupy more diversified habitats during the migration process; although it is sometimes found in the deserts of the American southwest, it is more commonly found in alpine areas during migration, as it tends to arid lowlands.

==Description==
The yellow-rumped warbler has an average length of 14 cm and weight of 12.5 g, its appearance is known to be different across its subspecies groups, especially the two major ones: the coronata group (myrtle warbler) and the &quot;auduboni&quot; group (Audubon&#x27;s warbler); intra-group variations are also observed. In spite of varying appearances, the yellow rump (as suggested by its name) is present in all subspecies and thus characterizes the yellow-rumped warbler. Within the myrtle warbler group, adult males during the breeding season have gray backs with dark streaks, while females have brown backs in contrast; male and female myrtle warblers can also be distinguished by their different cheek colors, with the former&#x27;s being black and the latter having brown or gray cheeks. The Audubon&#x27;s subspecies group is not very dissimilar to the myrtle: in summers, males of both forms have streaked backs of black on slate blue, white wing patches, a streaked breast, and conspicuous yellow patches on the crown, flank, and rump (the latter giving rise to the species&#x27;s nickname &quot;butter butt&quot; among birdwatchers). Yet the color of the &quot;coronata&quot; and &quot;auduboni&quot; groups&#x27; throat patches differs and distinguishes them, as the Audubon&#x27;s warbler sports a yellow throat patch while the myrtle warbler has a white throat and eye stripe, and a contrasting black cheek patch. Females of both forms are more dull, with brown streaking front and back, but still have noticeable yellow rumps. Goldman&#x27;s warbler, found in Guatemala, resembles Audubon&#x27;s but has a white lower border to the yellow throat and otherwise darker plumage; males replace the slate blue of Audubon&#x27;s with black.

Comprising most of the species of the New World warbler family, among the genus &quot;Setophaga&quot; (formerly &quot;Dendroica&quot;), the yellow-rumped warbler is a mid-to-large sized species. The total length of the species can range from long, with a wingspan of . Although the length is only slightly greater than other &quot;Setophaga&quot; warblers, it can be mildly to significantly heavier than most other North American species, although blackpoll warblers are slightly larger still. Body mass can vary from , though averages between . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is .

==Behavior==

=== Diet and foraging ===
Audubon&#x27;s and myrtle warblers are among North America&#x27;s most abundant neotropical migrants. While they are primarily insectivorous, the species is perhaps the most versatile foragers of all warblers. Beyond gleaning from leaves like other New World warblers, they often flit, flycatcher-like, out from their perches in short loops, to catch flying insects. Other places yellow-rumped warblers have been spotted foraging include picking at insects on washed-up seaweed at the beach, skimming insects from the surface of rivers and the ocean, picking them out of spiderwebs, and grabbing them off piles of manure. Common foods include caterpillars and other larvae, leaf beetles, bark beetles, weevils, ants, scale insects, aphids, grasshoppers, caddisflies, craneflies, and gnats, as well as spiders. They also eat spruce budworm, a serious forest pest, during outbreaks.

When bugs are scarce, the myrtle warbler also eats fruit, including the wax-myrtle berries which gave it its name. It is the only warbler able to digest such waxy material. The ability to use these fruits allows it to winter farther north than other warblers, sometimes as far north as Newfoundland. Other commonly eaten fruits may include juniper berries, poison ivy, poison oak, greenbrier, grapes, Virginia creeper and dogwood. They eat wild seeds such as from beach grasses and goldenrod, and they may come to feeders, where they&#x27;ll take sunflower seeds, raisins, peanut butter, and suet. On their wintering grounds in Mexico they&#x27;ve been seen sipping the sweet honeydew liquid excreted by aphids. Male yellow-rumped warblers tend to forage higher in the trees than females do. While foraging with other warbler species, they sometimes aggressively displace other species, including pine warblers and Blackburnian warblers.

=== Migratory behaviors ===
The yellow-rumped warbler&#x27;s migratory behaviors vary greatly across different groups and subspecies. Some individuals in Central America, such as in Mexico and Guatemala, migrate only limitedly or do not migrate at all; while individuals in the northern parts of the continent may either choose to migrate all the way towards Central America or winter near their breeding area along the Pacific Coast of the U.S. The species&#x27;s migratory behaviors are generally nocturnal, as individuals tend to travel at night; accordingly, during the yellow-rumped warbler&#x27;s migration in spring, it often relies on skylight polarization as a way to navigate and orient at dusk. The general direction of its migratory route maintains southwards during winter, as more individuals are present in Central America and southern parts of North America during the season, while less are observed in the north. Every year, fall migration usually takes place from September to November, spring migration from April to May, and the species known to depart from its winter habitats from March to April. Research shows that before migration, the yellow-rumped warbler intentionally gains weight and accrues more fat in its body: as a preparation for this energy-intensive activity, it consumes more food than other times for the purpose of increasing net energy intake from feeding, along with a refined diet that gives priority to food that supplies more energy.

=== Nesting and vocal behaviors ===
Audubon&#x27;s and the myrtle nest in coniferous and mixed woodlands, and lay 4–5 eggs. Females build the nest, sometimes using material the male carries to her. The nest is a cup of twigs, pine needles, grasses, and rootlets. She may also use moose, horse, and deer hair, moss, and lichens. She lines this cup with fine hair and feathers, sometimes woven into the nest in such a way that they curl up and over the eggs. The nest takes about 10 days to build. Nests are located on the horizontal branch of a conifer, anywhere from high. Tree species include hemlock, spruce, white cedar, pine, Douglas-fir, and larch or tamarack. They may build their nests far out on a main branch or tuck it close to the trunk in a secure fork of two or more branches. Occasionally nests are built in a deciduous tree such as a maple, oak or birch. The eggs are incubated for 12 to 13 days. Nestlings are helpless and naked at hatching but grow quickly. The young are brooded for 10 to 14 days, at which point they can fledge.

The yellow-rumped warbler has a trill-like song of 4–7 syllables (&quot;&quot;) and an occasional &quot;check&quot; or &quot;chip&quot; call note.

<doc id="414302" wikidata="Q945750" url="?curid=414302" title="Kurt Warner">
<text>Kurtis Eugene Warner (born June 22, 1971) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons, primarily with the St. Louis Rams and Arizona Cardinals. His career, which saw him ascend from an undrafted free agent to a two-time Most Valuable Player and Super Bowl MVP, is widely regarded as one of the greatest Cinderella stories in NFL history.

After playing college football for the Northern Iowa Panthers from 1990 to 1993, Warner spent four years without being named to an NFL roster. He was signed by the Green Bay Packers in 1994, but released before the regular season and instead played three seasons for the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League (AFL). Warner landed his first NFL roster spot in 1998 with the Rams, holding a backup position until he was thrust into becoming St. Louis&#x27;s starter the following season. During his first season as an NFL starting quarterback, Warner led The Greatest Show on Turf offense to the Rams&#x27; first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXIV, earning him league and Super Bowl MVP honors. He won his second league MVP award two years later en route to an appearance in Super Bowl XXXVI. Released from St. Louis in 2004 amid a performance decline, Warner spent one season with the New York Giants before revitalizing his career with the Cardinals. He led Arizona during the 2008 season to Super Bowl XLIII, the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl appearance.

Considered the NFL&#x27;s greatest undrafted player, Warner is the only undrafted player to be named NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP and the only undrafted quarterback to lead his team to a Super Bowl victory. He was also the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl during his first season as the primary starter. Warner was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017 and is the only player inducted to both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Arena Football Hall of Fame.
==Early life and college==
Born in Burlington, Iowa, Warner played football at Regis High School in Cedar Rapids, graduating in 1989. After graduation from high school, he attended the University of Northern Iowa, graduating in 1993. At UNI, Warner was third on the Panthers&#x27; depth chart until his senior year. When Warner was finally given the chance to start, he was named the Gateway Conference&#x27;s Offensive Player of the Year and first-team all-conference.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==

===Green Bay Packers===
Following his college career, Warner went undrafted in the 1994 NFL draft. He was invited to try out for the Green Bay Packers&#x27; training camp in 1994, but was released before the regular season began. Warner was competing for a spot against Brett Favre, Mark Brunell, and former Heisman Trophy winner Ty Detmer. While Warner was with the Packers, the head coach was Mike Holmgren, the quarterback coach was Steve Mariucci, and Andy Reid was the offensive assistant.

After his release, Warner stocked shelves at a Hy-Vee grocery store in Cedar Falls for $5.50 an hour. Warner often cites this starting point when telling of his rise to NFL stardom in 1999. He also mentions that his deepened dedication to Christianity occurred around 1997. Warner returned to Northern Iowa and worked as a graduate assistant coach with the football team, while still hoping to get another tryout with an NFL team.

===Iowa Barnstormers===
With no NFL teams willing to give him a chance, Warner turned to the Arena Football League (AFL) in 1995 and signed with the Iowa Barnstormers. He was named to the AFL&#x27;s First-team All-Arena in both 1996 and 1997 after he led the Barnstormers to ArenaBowl appearances in both seasons. Warner&#x27;s performance was so impressive that he was later named twelfth out of the 20 Best Arena Football Players of all time.

Before the 1997 NFL season, Warner requested and got a tryout with the Chicago Bears, but an injury to his throwing elbow caused by an unknown insect bite sustained during his honeymoon prevented him from attending.
In 2000, after Warner&#x27;s breakout NFL season, the AFL used his new fame for the name of its first widely available video game, &quot;Kurt Warner&#x27;s Arena Football Unleashed&quot;. Years later, on August 12, 2011, he would be inducted into the Arena Football Hall of Fame.

===St. Louis Rams===

====Amsterdam Admirals====
In December 1997 after the St. Louis Rams&#x27; season ended, Warner signed a future contract with the team. In February 1998, he was allocated to NFL Europe to play for the Amsterdam Admirals, where he led the league in touchdowns and passing yards. His backup at the time was future Carolina Panthers quarterback Jake Delhomme. Returning to the United States, Warner spent the 1998 season as St. Louis&#x27;s third-string quarterback behind Tony Banks and Steve Bono, beating out former Virginia Tech quarterback Will Furrer. He ended his season completing only 4 of 11 pass attempts for 39 yards and a 47.2 QB rating.

====1999 season====
Prior to the 1999 free-agency period, the Rams chose Warner to be one of the team&#x27;s five unprotected players in the 1999 NFL expansion draft. Warner went unselected by the Cleveland Browns, who chose no Rams and whose only quarterback selection was Scott Milanovich. Warner and the Rams had feared his being selected by the Browns upon learning the Browns hired John Hufnagel for their coaching staff, as Hufnagel had been a rival coach from Warner&#x27;s Arena League days.

The Rams let Bono leave in free agency and signed Trent Green to be the starter. Banks was traded to the Ravens, and Warner now found himself second on the depth chart. After Green suffered a torn ACL via a low hit by Rodney Harrison in a preseason game, Rams coach Dick Vermeil named Warner as the Rams&#x27; starter. In an emotional press conference, Vermeil—who had not seen Warner work with the first-string offense—said, &quot;We will rally around Kurt Warner, and we&#x27;ll play good football.&quot; With the support of running back Marshall Faulk and wide receivers Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt, Az-Zahir Hakim, and Ricky Proehl, Warner put together one of the top seasons by a quarterback in NFL history, throwing for 4,353 yards with 41 touchdown passes and a completion rate of 65.1%. The Rams&#x27; high-powered offense, run by offensive coordinator Mike Martz, was nicknamed &quot;The Greatest Show on Turf&quot; and registered the first in a string of three consecutive 500-point seasons, an NFL record.

Warner threw three touchdown passes in each of his first three NFL starts, an NFL record until it was surpassed by Patrick Mahomes in 2018. Warner drew more attention in the Rams&#x27; fourth game of the season, a home game against the San Francisco 49ers (who had been NFC West division champions for 12 of the previous 13 seasons). The Rams lost their last 17 meetings with the 49ers, but Warner proceeded to throw a touchdown pass on each of the Rams&#x27; first three possessions of the game, and four touchdowns in the first half alone, to propel the Rams to a 28–10 halftime lead on the way to a 42–20 victory. Warner finished the game with five touchdown passes, giving him 14 in four games and the Rams a 4–0 record. Warner&#x27;s breakout season from a career in anonymity was so unexpected that &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; featured him on their October 18 cover with the caption &quot;Who &quot;Is&quot; This Guy?&quot; He was named the 1999 NFL MVP at the season&#x27;s end for leading the Rams to their first playoff berth since 1989 (when they were still in Los Angeles) and their first division title since 1985.
In the NFL playoffs, Warner ultimately led the Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV against the Tennessee Titans. In the game, he threw for two touchdowns and a then Super Bowl-record 414 passing yards, including a 73-yard touchdown to Isaac Bruce when the game was tied with just over two minutes to play, which proved to be the game-winning score. Warner also set a Super Bowl record by attempting 45 passes without a single interception. For his performance, Warner was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award. Warner was the last player to win both the NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP in the same year until Patrick Mahomes did so in Super Bowl LVII in the 2022 NFL season.

====2000 season====
On July 21, Warner signed a seven-year contract worth $47 million. He started the 2000 season where he had left off in his record-setting 1999 season, racking up 300 or more passing yards in each of his first six games (tying Steve Young&#x27;s record) and posting 19 touchdown passes in that stretch. Warner broke his hand and missed the middle of the season, but Trent Green filled in ably and the Warner/Green duo led the Rams to the highest team passing yard total in NFL history, with 5,232 net yards. Warner and Green&#x27;s combined gross passing yards total was 5,492. In contrast to his previous season, however, Warner&#x27;s turnover rate drastically increased in 2000, as he threw an interception in 5.2% of his attempts (compared to just 2.6% in 1999). Despite one of the most productive offensive years by an NFL team, the Rams won only ten games and lost in the wild card round to the New Orleans Saints. In response to the disappointing season, the Rams cut nine of their eleven defensive starters during the offseason, and Trent Green was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs.

====2001 season====
Warner returned to MVP form in 2001. Although his performance lagged behind his 1999 performance, he amassed a league-high 36 touchdown passes and 4,830 passing yards, and another league high mark in passer rating (101.4). Warner&#x27;s tendency for turnovers carried over from 2000, as he tossed a career-high 22 interceptions (despite completing a career-high 68.7% of his passes), but he still led &quot;The Greatest Show on Turf&quot; to its third consecutive 6–0 start (becoming the first NFL team to do so, later equaled by the 2005–2007 Indianapolis Colts), an NFL-best 14–2 record, and an appearance in Super Bowl XXXVI. Warner was also named the NFL MVP for the second time in three seasons, giving the Rams their third winner in as many years (running back Marshall Faulk won in 2000).

In Super Bowl XXXVI, Warner threw for 365 yards (then the second-highest, now the sixth-highest total in Super Bowl history) and a passing touchdown along with a rushing touchdown, but his rhythm was disrupted by New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick&#x27;s defensive game plan and he tossed two costly interceptions which helped stake the heavy-underdog Patriots to a two-touchdown lead. After falling behind to the Patriots 17–3, though, the Rams rallied to tie the game late in the fourth quarter on a one-yard Warner quarterback sneak touchdown run and a 26-yard touchdown pass from Warner to Ricky Proehl. The game ended in a 20–17 loss for Warner and the Rams when Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri kicked a game-winning field goal as time expired, giving the Patriots the first of three Super Bowl wins in four years.

====2002–2003 seasons====
Warner began the 2002 season as the Rams&#x27; starter, but he played poorly, throwing seven interceptions against only one touchdown as the team went 0–3. In the Rams&#x27; Week 4 game against the Dallas Cowboys, Warner broke a finger on his throwing hand. Warner attempted to come back later in the season, but his injury allowed him to play only two more games (both losses). In contrast to his 103.0 career passer rating entering the season, Warner posted a minuscule 67.4 rating in 2002.

The following season, Warner was replaced as the Rams&#x27; starting quarterback for good after fumbling six times in the team&#x27;s opening-day game against the New York Giants. Warner later revealed that he had previously broken his hand and that it had not fully healed, making it more difficult to grip the football. His successor as the Rams&#x27; starting quarterback, Marc Bulger (another relatively unheralded quarterback coming out of college), stepped into the breach and played reasonably well upon replacing Warner.

The Rams signed veteran Chris Chandler as Bulger&#x27;s backup. The Rams released Warner on June 1, 2004, with three years left on his contract.

===New York Giants===
Two days after his release from the Rams, he signed a one-year, $3 million deal with the New York Giants, with a second year player option worth $6 million. Warner started the 2004 season as the Giants&#x27; starting quarterback, winning five of his first seven games, but following a two-game losing streak, highly touted rookie quarterback Eli Manning was given the starting job in a decision made by Tom Coughlin not based on Warner&#x27;s play. The Giants had a 5–4 win–loss record at the time of Warner&#x27;s benching. Warner made a spot appearance at the end of a Giants blowout loss against Baltimore, and it was Warner who advised Coughlin to go to the media and say that Manning was still the starter for the team. It was the last appearance for Warner as a Giant. Ultimately, New York finished at 6–10 (going only 1–6 under Manning). Following the season, Warner chose to void the second year of his contract, and thus became a free agent.
===Arizona Cardinals===

====2005 season====
In early 2005, Warner signed a one-year, $4-million contract with the Arizona Cardinals, and was quickly named the starter by coach Dennis Green. Warner posted three relatively mediocre performances before injuring his groin and being replaced by former starter Josh McCown. McCown performed well enough in the two games Warner missed that McCown remained the starter.

After McCown struggled in two straight games, Green re-inserted Warner into the starting line-up. After playing fairly well in two consecutive losses (passing for a total of nearly 700 yards), Warner defeated his former team, the Rams, by a score of 38–28. He passed for 285 yards and three touchdowns while posting a quarterback rating of 115.9. Warner&#x27;s season ended in week 15 when he partially tore his MCL.

Warner signed a new three-year extension with the Cardinals on February 14, 2006. The deal had a base salary of $18 million and, with performance incentives, could have been worth as much as $24 million.

====2006 season====
In Week 1 of the 2006 NFL season, Warner won the NFC Offensive Player of the Week award, throwing for 301 yards and three touchdowns in a win over San Francisco. Two weeks later, Warner passed the 20,000-yard passing milestone in his 76th game, the second-quickest of any player in NFL history (Warner accomplished the feat in one game more than it took record-holder Dan Marino).

After three subpar games in Weeks 2–4, Warner was replaced as quarterback by rookie Matt Leinart in the fourth quarter of week 4. Coach Dennis Green stated that Warner would be the backup quarterback for the remainder of the season. In week 16, Leinart went down with a shoulder injury against the 49ers, forcing Warner to see his first action since week 4. Warner filled in nicely, as he was able to hang on for the Cardinals win. In week 17 against the San Diego Chargers, Warner started again in place of the injured Leinart, throwing for 365 yards (which led the NFL for that week) and a touchdown, though the Chargers were able to hold on for a 27–20 win.

====2007 season====
Leinart was given the starting quarterback job at the start of the 2007 season. However, in the third game of the season, against the Baltimore Ravens, Warner came off the bench to relieve an ineffective Leinart during the 4th quarter with the Ravens leading 23–6 at the beginning of the quarter. Warner led a furious comeback, as he completed 15 of 20 passes for 258 yards and 2 touchdowns. This brought Arizona to a tie game (23–23), though Arizona would go on to lose the game 26–23 after Baltimore kicked a last-second field goal.

On September 30, 2007, during the week four game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Warner relieved Leinart again, following another ineffective start. Warner finished with 14 completed of 21 attempts for 132 yards with one touchdown pass and no interceptions, while Leinart re-entered the game in the 4th quarter and led the Cardinals to their final touchdown. After Leinart was placed on injured reserve, Warner was named starter for the remainder of the 2007 season.

Warner passed for a career-high 484 yards against the 49ers in a 37–31 loss on November 25, but had a fumble in the end zone in overtime that was recovered by Tully Banta-Cain, and the Cardinals lost. However, the following week Warner improved; and the Cardinals earned a victory over the Browns that brought the Cardinals to 6–6 and kept them in the chase for the NFC Wild Card playoff spot. Warner finished the 2007 season with 27 passing touchdowns, just one shy of the Cardinals franchise record.

====2008 season====
Leinart was named the Cardinals&#x27; starting quarterback going into the 2008 off-season, but Ken Whisenhunt stated that it would be very possible for Warner to be the starter before week one of the regular season. Indeed, Warner was named the starter on August 30, 2008. That season, Warner had 4,583 passing yards, 30 touchdowns, and a completion percentage of 67.1%. He was the top ranked passer in the National Football Conference for the third time, and only trailed Philip Rivers and Chad Pennington of the AFC in NFL passer rating for the season. Warner also received FedEx Air Player of the Week honors for his performance during weeks 9 and 11 of the season. He had his struggles during the season, as in week 3 of the season vs. the New York Jets, his team turned the ball over 7 times. This included an interception for a touchdown, and 2 picks resulting in a touchdown and a field goal in just the second quarter. Warner still managed to get his team to score 35 points in a 56–35 loss.

On December 7, 2008, Warner led the Cardinals to a 34–10 win over his former team, the Rams, securing for the Cardinals the NFC West Division title and their first playoff berth since 1998. It was the Cardinals&#x27; first division title since 1975 and third of the post-merger era. As a result, the Cardinals earned a home playoff game, only their second ever, and their first in Arizona. (Despite winning division titles in the 1974 and 1975 seasons in St. Louis, the Cardinals played on the road in the playoffs as a result of the playoff structure in those days.) On December 16, 2008, Warner was named the starting quarterback for the NFC team in the 2009 Pro Bowl.

=====2008 postseason=====

On January 3, 2009, Warner led the Cardinals in their victory over the Atlanta Falcons 30–24 at home in the first round of the playoffs. During the game Warner went 19 for 32 passing, a completion percentage of 59.4%, for 271 yards. He threw two touchdowns and one interception.

On January 10, Warner helped the Cardinals defeat the Carolina Panthers 33–13 in Charlotte, North Carolina in the second round of the playoffs. During the game Warner went 21 for 32 passing, for 220 yards, a completion percentage of 65.6%, with two touchdowns and one interception. This win was the first time the Cardinals had won a game on the East Coast the entire 2008 season, after having lost away games to the Panthers, Washington Redskins, Philadelphia Eagles, New York Jets, and the New England Patriots.

On January 18, Warner threw for 279 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions against the Philadelphia Eagles to lead the Cardinals to their first Super Bowl appearance in history. Warner became the second quarterback to start a Super Bowl with multiple teams and first since Craig Morton (Warner has since been joined by Peyton Manning and Tom Brady).

In Warner&#x27;s third career Super Bowl appearance on February 1, the Cardinals lost Super Bowl XLIII 27–23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers, leaving him with a career 1–2 record in Super Bowls. Despite losing, Warner still managed to throw for 377 yards (the fourth-highest total in Super Bowl history as of 2023). He completed 72.1% of his passes, and had a quarterback rating of 112.3. Warner had thus recorded the three highest single-game passing yardage totals in Super Bowl history up to that point, and joined Roger Staubach, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, John Elway, and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks to throw a touchdown pass in three Super Bowls. Warner took his team to the Super Bowl every year that he played as the starting quarterback during all regular and post season games.

====2009 season====
Warner announced his desire to return to the Cardinals for the 2009 season. The Cardinals offered him a two-year contract worth around $20 million but Warner was looking for a contract that would pay him about $14 million a year and the two sides could not come to an agreement. On February 27, 2009, Warner became a free agent and went on to have talks with the San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers offered Warner a contract worth more than that offered by the Cardinals. On March 4, Warner re-signed with the Cardinals to a two-year deal worth $23 million total, $4 million for each of the next two years, with a $15 million signing bonus, and $19 million guaranteed. Warner underwent arthroscopic hip surgery to repair a torn labrum on March 17, 2009. On September 20, 2009, Warner broke the NFL&#x27;s single-game record for completion percentage in the regular season, completing 24 of 26 passing for 243 yards and two touchdowns. Warner&#x27;s 92.3 percent completion rate broke the previous NFL record set by Vinny Testaverde in 1993.

On November 1, 2009, Warner threw a career-high-equaling five interceptions during a loss to the Carolina Panthers. During the same game Warner became the first quarterback in the NFL to throw for over 14,000 yards with two teams. On November 8, Warner equaled his career-high of five touchdown passes in a single game during a 41–21 victory over the Chicago Bears. This performance led to Warner being named both the NFC Offensive Player of the Week and the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Week. On November 15, 2009, Warner reached a career milestone with his 200th touchdown pass during a 31–20 win against the Seattle Seahawks.

On November 22, 2009, during a 21–13 victory over the St. Louis Rams, Warner left the game after suffering a concussion. Warner continued to suffer from post-concussion symptoms and on November 29, 2009, he was deactivated against the Tennessee Titans, breaking his consecutive starts streak at 41 games. On December 6, 2009, Warner returned to action as the Cardinals defeated the Minnesota Vikings 30–17. Warner registered his fourth consecutive game with a passer rating of 120 or better, making him only the second quarterback in NFL history to accomplish the feat. After his three-touchdown performance, Warner was named both the NFC Offensive Player of the Week and the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Week.

On December 27, 2009, Warner became only the second quarterback in NFL history to throw 100 touchdown passes with two teams (Hall of Famer Fran Tarkenton is the other), in the Cardinals&#x27; 31–10 win over the St. Louis Rams. On December 29, 2009, Warner was named an alternate quarterback for the NFC team in the 2010 Pro Bowl.

=====2009 postseason=====
On January 10, 2010, Warner threw five touchdowns and completed 29 of 33 passes for 379 yards in a 51–45 victory over the Green Bay Packers. The game had the highest combined total score in NFL playoff history. Warner became one of the very few quarterbacks in NFL history to throw more touchdowns (5) than incompletions (4) in a playoff game. Warner finished the game with the second highest quarterback rating in NFL playoff history with a rating of 154.1. He also became the second quarterback to throw for five touchdown passes in a playoff game twice, and the first to do so since the merger of the leagues. He is also the oldest player to have thrown that many touchdown passes in a playoff game (38 years, 202 days). Warner also tied the NFL record for consecutive playoff games with at least three touchdown passes (three games). Since the playoff game was his last at home in the playoffs during his career, he finished a perfect 7–0 in home contests (4–0 with St. Louis; 3–0 with Arizona).
On January 16, Warner was injured in the first half trying to tackle the ball carrier after an interception on the way to a 45–14 loss at New Orleans in the NFC Divisional Round. He returned for the second half, but yielded to understudy Matt Leinart midway through the fourth quarter. In 2012, the NFL discovered the Saints had placed a bounty on Warner. Warner never accused the Saints of making an illegal hit or ending his career, saying &quot;It was a violent hit, no question. But I also believe it was a legal hit.&quot;

===Retirement===
Warner officially announced his retirement from the NFL in January 2010. He said he was looking forward to finally being a true father to his seven kids, and that he wanted to spend time with his wife. He spoke on the impact and influence of his family, former teammates, and God. He became eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame following the 2014 season. In December 2014, Warner admitted he briefly considered coming out of retirement and returning to the Cardinals following the team losing Carson Palmer and Drew Stanton due to injuries.

==Post-retirement career==
Warner became an Iowa Barnstormers broadcaster for the 2011 Arena Football League season. In May 2010, he was inducted into the Arena Football Hall of Fame. He is also a member of the Iowa Barnstormers Hall of Fame.

Warner was inducted into the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame in 2014.

Warner was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2017. He was inducted on August 5, 2017, alongside Morten Andersen, Terrell Davis, Kenny Easley, Jerry Jones, Jason Taylor, and LaDainian Tomlinson. Warner is the only person inducted into both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Arena Football Hall of Fame.

From 2015 to 2018, Warner was a coach at Desert Mountain High School in Scottsdale, Arizona. Notably, Kedon Slovis played under Warner before being recruited by the USC Trojans for the 2019 college football season.

Since 2019, Warner has been the quarterbacks coach at Brophy College Preparatory.

==Personal life==
===Childhood===
Kurt Warner was born to Gene and Sue Warner. Warner&#x27;s parents divorced when he was six. Kurt and his brother, Matt, lived with their mother, including through another short marriage and divorce.

Kurt&#x27;s father, Gene Warner, remarried a year after divorcing Kurt&#x27;s mother. Warner&#x27;s stepmother, Mimi Warner, also had a son named Matt (Post). The three boys formed a close relationship soon thereafter. Kurt graduated in 1989 from Regis High School, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he was quarterback of the school&#x27;s Class 3A football team.

===College===
Warner graduated from University of Northern Iowa with a degree in communications.

===Marriage===
During college, Warner met his future wife, Brenda Carney Meoni; they married on October 11, 1997. Brenda is a former United States Marine Corps corporal. She was divorced with two children, one of whom was left brain damaged and blind after being accidentally dropped by Brenda&#x27;s ex-husband, leading to her hardship discharge from the Marines in 1990.

After Warner was cut from the Packers&#x27; training camp in 1994, he got a job working the night shift as a night stock clerk at a local Hy-Vee grocery store, in addition to his work as an assistant coach at Northern Iowa. While Warner was working as an assistant coach, the couple were living in Warner&#x27;s parents&#x27; basement in Cedar Falls. Brenda&#x27;s parents were killed in 1996 when their Mountain View, Arkansas, home was destroyed by a tornado. Warner and Brenda married on October 11, 1997, at the St. John American Lutheran Church, the same place where the service for Brenda&#x27;s parents was held. Warner was still hoping to get an NFL tryout, but with that possibility appearing dim and the long hours at Hy-Vee for minimum wage taking their toll, Warner began his Arena League career.

After marrying Brenda, Warner officially adopted her two children from her first marriage; they have since had five children together. His son E. J. is the starting quarterback for the Rice Owls. Another son, Kade, played wide receiver for the Kansas State Wildcats and signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in April 2023.

===Christian faith and testimony===
Kurt and Brenda Warner are devout evangelical Christians. His faith first emerged on the national stage following the Rams&#x27; Super Bowl victory, where he was named the game&#x27;s MVP:

Nine years later, upon leading the Cardinals to the franchise&#x27;s first-ever Super Bowl, Warner&#x27;s response was similar:

Warner has usually attended charismatic churches, and believes that God healed him from a concussion he suffered in 2000. However, he eschews the term &quot;charismatic&quot;. In 2001, he told &quot;Charisma&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m just a Christian.&quot;

==Broadcasting==
In 2010, Warner joined NFL Network as an analyst. He can be seen regularly on NFL Total Access, as well as in-studio on NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; pregame show, &quot;Thursday Night Kickoff Presented by Sears&quot;. Warner also served as an analyst for the NFL Network&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 Arena Football League playoffs. Warner tested positive for COVID-19 in January 2021, and was unable to serve on the studio panel for &quot;NFL GameDay Morning&quot; for the wild card playoff round.

In August 2010, Fox Sports announced that Warner would be serving as a color analyst on the network&#x27;s NFL coverage in the 2010 season. He teamed with play-by-play announcers Chris Rose or Chris Myers to call regional games.

In 2014, Westwood One radio hired Warner as a substitute analyst on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games when regular analyst Boomer Esiason is unavailable. In 2018, Warner became the full-time radio analyst.

==Television appearances==
On January 27, 2009, Warner made a special appearance on the NBC reality show &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;.

Warner made a guest appearance on Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Suite Life on Deck&quot; as himself, in the episode &quot;Any Given Fantasy&quot; which aired on January 18, 2010.

On February 9, 2010, Warner was a surprise guest on the final episode of &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;.

On August 30, 2010, it was announced on live television that Warner would be appearing as a contestant on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. His professional dance partner was Anna Trebunskaya; the couple was eliminated in week 8, the Instant Choreography Week.

Warner appeared as the host of &quot;The Moment&quot;, a reality series on USA Network, in 2013.

==Film and video==
In 2003, GoodTimes Entertainment released the direct-to-home video &quot;Kurt Warner&#x27;s Good Sports Gang&quot;, a film featuring Warner as the &quot;coach&quot; of a group of animated sports balls. The series was sponsored by Warner, and focused on religious faith and moral values. A portion of the proceeds went to Warner&#x27;s First Things First Foundation. Although it was originally planned as a series, &quot;Episode 1: Elliot the Invincible&quot;, was the only release along with Together, We&#x27;re Better (Episode 2) and a few shorts featuring Warner and his adopted daughter, Jesse Warner.

In February 2020, it was announced that the Erwin Brothers were creating and releasing a theatrical film about Warner&#x27;s life titled &quot;American Underdog&quot;, with Zachary Levi as Warner. The film was produced by Kingdom Story Company, and distributed by Lionsgate on December 25, 2021, to generally favorable reviews.

== Other cultural depictions ==
Warner was one of three Iowa college athletes, each from one of the state&#x27;s three public four-year universities, to be the subjects of butter sculptures at the 2023 Iowa State Fair. Warner was joined by Caitlin Clark (Iowa basketball) and Jack Trice (Iowa State football).

==Endorsements==
On December 3, 2010, Warner&#x27;s first multi-year post-retirement endorsement agreement was announced. Amway North America announced that it had signed Warner to a multi-year endorsement agreement to represent the Nutrilite brand. Amway reportedly agreed to make a $50,000 donation to Kurt Warner&#x27;s First Things First Foundation.

In addition to his post-retirement endorsements and charity work, Warner has invested in the Elite Football League of India, a South Asian professional football league. Other prominent American backers include former Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka, former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin, sports analyst and former NFL quarterback Ron Jaworski, and actor Mark Wahlberg. Warner&#x27;s total investment amount remains undisclosed, although $50,000 of it will go towards a donation of footballs to schools and underprivileged children throughout India.

==Public service==
Warner has also appeared in several public service announcements for Civitan International, promoting his and Brenda&#x27;s volunteer efforts and their work with the developmentally disabled. This issue is personally close to Warner, as Zachary, his adopted son from Brenda&#x27;s first marriage, suffered major brain damage as an infant when his biological father accidentally dropped him.

Warner has devoted time and money to his First Things First Foundation, the name of which was derived from his interview after winning the Super Bowl in 1999. The foundation is dedicated to impacting lives by promoting Christian values, sharing experiences and providing opportunities to encourage everyone that all things are possible when people seek to put &quot;first things first&quot;. The foundation has been involved with numerous projects for causes such as children&#x27;s hospitals, people with developmental disabilities and assisting single parents. Warner&#x27;s work both on and off the field resulted in him being awarded the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year Award 2008, which was presented to him at the start of Super Bowl XLIII. In March 2009, Warner was honored with the Muhammad Ali Sports Leadership Award. Warner was selected by USA Weekend as the winner of its annual Most Caring Athlete Award for 2009. In December 2009, Warner topped a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; poll of NFL players to name the best role model on and off the field in the NFL.

In February 2010, Warner received the annual Bart Starr Award, given for outstanding character and leadership in the home, on the field and in the community. At the award presentation, Bart Starr said of Warner: &quot;We have never given this award to anyone who is more deserving&quot;.

<doc id="414303" wikidata="Q21855429" url="?curid=414303" title="Audubon's warbler">
<text>Audubon&#x27;s warbler (Setophaga auduboni) is a small bird of the family Parulidae. At one time considered a distinct species, discovery of a hybrid zone between it and the myrtle warbler in 1973 has led to it being classified as a subspecies of the yellow-rumped warbler.

Audubon&#x27;s warbler can be found across western North America, breeding from the U.S. to Canada and wintering in Central America. It is an active bird, often seen flying between branches of trees. In the summer the males have a distinctive yellow throat and a dark head and back.

==Taxonomy==
This passerine bird was long known to be closely related to its counterparts Goldman&#x27;s warbler and myrtle warbler, and at various times the three forms have been classed as either one, two or three species. At present, the American Ornithological Society and Clements considers the myrtle, Audubon&#x27;s, and Goldman&#x27;s warbler three subspecies of the yellow-rumped warbler (&quot;Setophaga coronata coronata&quot; and &quot;Setophaga coronata auduboni,&quot; and &quot;Setophaga coronata goldmani&quot; respectively) while the IOC World Bird List classifies the myrtle warbler, Audubon&#x27;s, and Goldman&#x27;s warbler as separate species (&quot;Setophaga coronata&quot;, &quot;Setophaga auduboni&quot;, and &quot;Setophaga goldmani&quot;).

Audubon&#x27;s warbler was originally called the yellow-rumped warbler along with the myrtle warbler. However, in 1973 scientists began to differentiate between them. Regionally, these subspecies are differentiated with the myrtle warbler belonging to the eastern United States and Audubon&#x27;s warbler being found in the west. Intermediate forms of the species can also exist when their breeding ranges overlap like in the hybrid zone in the United States and western Canada. A study done in 2011 concluded that Audubon&#x27;s warbler is itself the result of hybridization of the myrtle warbler and black-fronted warbler. The study found that Audubon&#x27;s warbler and the myrtle warbler share mitochondrial DNA and migratory patterns and northern Audubon&#x27;s warblers&#x27; nuclear allele frequency and wing span were an average between the Myrtle Warbler and black-fronted warbler while southern Audubon&#x27;s warblers allele frequency and wing span mimicked the black-fronted warbler.
Black-fronted warbler, &quot;Setophaga auduboni nigrifrons&quot; is a subspecies found in Chihuahua to Durango, Mexico.
==Description==

In the spring and summer, the adult male has a dark back with a bright yellow throat, rump, and flank patch, and black head and back. The adult female&#x27;s throat and shoulders contain less yellow than the males and is further distinguished by the brown in its back and its white wing bars compared to the white wing panels of the males. The juvenile male is similarly colored but with more black in its tail and can be distinguished by its incomplete wing panel. The juvenile female is much browner than the adult female and has whitish shoulders and some yellow in the throat.

In the fall and winter, the adult male has a grey and black back with black lores and black streaks in the breast. However, there is significant overlap with the adult female so the identification of the adult male can be conclusive only if there is extensive black across the back and breast. The adult female and juvenile male are virtually indistinguishable and have lighter breast streaking and are browner than the adult male. The juvenile female is very dull and has a slightly-tinted yellow throat but there is considerable overlap between the juvenile female and adult female. The two can only be definitely distinguished in cases where the juvenile throat is white or the juvenile displays two feather ages in its greater converts.

This form is distinguished from the myrtle warbler by its lack of a whitish eyestripe, its yellow throat, and concolorous cheek patch.

The song is a simple trill, and they make a hard &quot;check&quot; call. Both males and females measure between long, with a wingspan of . Both sexes typically weigh between .

==Distribution and habitat==
Audubon&#x27;s warbler is distributed across the western half of North America. It breeds in much of western Canada, the western United States, and into Mexico. It is migratory, wintering from the southern parts of the breeding range into western Central America.

Audubon&#x27;s warbler is most commonly found in coniferous forests, but can also be found in deciduous forests during the spring and summer. In the fall and winter, however, they migrate to more open, shrubby areas. This change in location coincides with their eating habits.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Audubon&#x27;s warbler tends to be rather active, typically spotted while catching insects during the warmer months in the year. During the colder months of the year Audubon&#x27;s warbler is usually found eating berries and traveling in flocks.

The breeding habitat is a variety of coniferous and mixed woodland. Audubon&#x27;s warblers nest in a tree, laying four or five eggs in a cup nest.

<text>The Kennedy Center Honors are annual honors given to those in the performing arts for their lifetime of contributions to American culture. They have been presented annually since 1978, culminating each December in a gala celebrating five Honorees in the Kennedy Center Opera House in Washington, D.C. While the awards are primarily given to individuals, they have occasionally been given to duos or musical groups, as well as to one Broadway musical, one television show, and one performing arts venue.

==History==
George Stevens Jr. created the Kennedy Center Honors with Nick Vanoff and produced the first gala in 1978. He was the producer and co-writer through the 2014 awards, after which he sold the production rights to the Kennedy Center.

The idea for the Kennedy Center Honors began in 1977, after that year&#x27;s 10th-anniversary White House reception and Kennedy Center program for the American Film Institute (AFI). Roger L. Stevens, the founding chairman of the Kennedy Center, asked George Stevens Jr. (no relation), the founding director of the AFI, to hold an event for the center. Stevens Jr. asked Isaac Stern to become involved, and then pitched the idea to the television network CBS, who bought it. With the first Honors event and Honorees, CBS vice president for specials, Bernie Sofronski, stated:

The first host was Leonard Bernstein in 1978, followed by Eric Sevareid in 1979 (with Gene Kelly closing it) and Beverly Sills in 1980. Walter Cronkite hosted from 1981 to 2002 and Caroline Kennedy hosted from 2003 to 2012. Glenn Close hosted in 2013 and Stephen Colbert hosted from 2014 to 2016. Ricky Kirshner and Glenn Weiss of White Cherry Entertainment were the Executive Producers of the 38th annual Kennedy Center Honors (2015) after George Stevens Jr. stepped down. There was no formal host in 2017, although Caroline Kennedy delivered an introduction. In 2018, mid-2021, and 2023 Gloria Estefan hosted, LL Cool J hosted in 2019, and David Letterman hosted in late 2021. Queen Latifah hosted in 2024. There was no formal host in 2022, though several former honorees delivered an introduction. In 2022, David Jammy of Done+Dusted and Elizabeth Kelly of ROK Productions were hired to serve as Executive Producers.

This awards show does not air live (with the exception of closed-circuit venues), but an edited version lasting approximately two hours is normally televised on CBS after Christmas. In 2024, the presentation added a half hour, making the show two and a half hours. Normally, the show has been aired between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s on CBS television, but, in a departure from this tradition, the 2019 Kennedy Center Honors aired on regular television in early December and was later made available on CBS All Access. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 edition was postponed and eventually held between May 17 and May 22, 2021, and the edited broadcast aired on June 6, 2021. Since 2021, the annual Honors broadcast has been available to stream for a limited time through CBS platforms and Paramount+

===Selection process===
Honoree recommendations are accepted from the general public, and the Kennedy Center initiated a Special Honors Advisory Committee, which comprises members of the board of trustees as well as past Honorees and distinguished artists. The executive committee of the board of trustees selects the Honoree recipients based on their impact and contributions to American culture and excellence in music, dance, theater, opera, motion pictures or television. The selections are typically announced sometime between July and September. Most honorees are Americans, with non-U.S. citizen honorees typically hailing from elsewhere in the anglosphere. 

==Events==

The invitation-only, weekend-long ceremony includes the Chairman&#x27;s Luncheon, the State Department dinner, White House reception, and the Honors gala performances and supper.

The Chairman&#x27;s Luncheon is held on Saturday at the Kennedy Center. Surrounded by the Honorees, the chairman of the board of trustees launches the event with a welcoming speech. At that evening&#x27;s reception and dinner at the State Department, presided over by the Secretary of State, the Honorees are introduced and the Honors medallions are presented by the chairman of the board. The wide rainbow-colored ribbon then hung around the necks of the recipients and prominently noticeable when the events are televised, symbolizes &quot;a spectrum of many skills within the performing arts&quot; according to creator Ivan Chermayeff.

On Sunday, there is an early-evening White House reception, traditionally hosted by the President of the United States and the First Lady, followed by the Honors gala performance at the Kennedy Center and supper.

Prior to 2017, there had been three occasions in which the president did not attend the gala performance. President Jimmy Carter did not attend in 1979 during the Iran hostage crisis; First Lady Rosalynn Carter served as his surrogate. President George H. W. Bush was on a trip to Brussels and could not attend in 1989; First Lady Barbara Bush served as his surrogate. President Bill Clinton was on a trip to Budapest and could not attend in 1994; First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton served as his surrogate.

For the 2015 gala performance, President Barack Obama joined First Lady Michelle Obama late after addressing the nation in a live telecast from the White House.

In 2017, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump decided not to participate in events honoring recipients of the 2017 Kennedy Center Honors awards to &quot;allow the Honorees to celebrate without any political distraction.&quot; The 2017 ceremony was held on December 3, 2017, without them, marking the first time that neither the president nor the first lady attended; Caroline Kennedy was the host and presented the Honorees. The traditional dinner at the State Department on the Saturday evening before the ceremony was hosted by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and the White House reception was canceled. Donald and Melania Trump also did not participate in any of the events of the 2018 or 2019 editions.

Because of changes imposed on the delayed and abbreviated 2020 edition due to the COVID-19 pandemic, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden welcomed that year&#x27;s Honorees to the White House in May 2021 but did not attend any other events.

For the 2021 edition, Joe and Jill Biden attended the gala performance on December 5, 2021, marking the first time since 2016 that a sitting president and first lady had attended the event.

==Recipients==

255 people have been awarded the Kennedy Center Honors as of 2024, not counting special awards. The award given to stand-up comedian and actor Bill Cosby in 1998 was rescinded in 2018 following Cosby&#x27;s sexual assault conviction.

The vast majority of Kennedy Center Honors have been bestowed on individuals. On 13 occasions since 1985, awards have been presented to duos or groups, including three married couples who were actors: Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy; Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward; and Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee. Dancers The Nicholas Brothers, Fayard and Harold were honored, along with three musical theater songwriting duos: Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and John Kander and Fred Ebb.

Members of six music groups were awarded: Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey of The Who; John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin; Don Henley, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh and (posthumously) Glenn Frey of the Eagles; Philip Bailey, Verdine White and Ralph Johnson of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire; Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton, and Larry Mullen Jr. of U2, and Mickey Hart, Billy Kreutzmann, (posthumously) Phil Lesh and Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead.

At the 2018 ceremony, a special award for &quot;trailblazing creators of a transformative work that defies category&quot; was presented to the creators of the musical &quot;Hamilton&quot;: Lin-Manuel Miranda, Thomas Kail, Andy Blankenbuehler and Alex Lacamoire.

For the first time, the 2019 Honorees included a television program. The co-founders of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett, accepted the Kennedy Center Honors on behalf of all the creators.

In 2024, a special award was given to the Apollo Theater in New York City, the first institution to be awarded at the Kennedy Center Honors.

==Prospective Honorees who declined, canceled or postponed==
Pianist Vladimir Horowitz was to be an Honoree, but the selection committee withdrew the offer when Horowitz conditioned his acceptance on being honored alone and at 4:00 in the afternoon.

Actress Katharine Hepburn declined the committee&#x27;s first offer, although she relented in 1990.

Doris Day repeatedly turned down the Honor because her fear of flying prevented her from attending the ceremony.

When considering Irving Berlin for the 1987 awards because of criticism for overlooking him, the center was informed that Berlin wanted to be honored only if he surpassed his 100th birthday (which would not be until May 1988). He was also in failing health, using a wheelchair following a series of strokes, and could not attend a public event. The Center chose instead to pay special tribute to him at the 1987 Gala. He died in 1989.

Paul McCartney was selected as an Honoree in 2002, but was unable to attend due to an &quot;inescapable personal obligation,&quot; his cousin&#x27;s previously planned wedding. After initially saying McCartney&#x27;s award would be postponed until the following year, the Kennedy Center did not give the award to McCartney in 2003. However, McCartney became a 2010 Honoree.

Mel Brooks said he refused the Honor when George W. Bush was in office, due to his distaste for Bush&#x27;s Iraq policy. He was honored in 2009, the first year Barack Obama was president.

In November 2015, one month before the ceremony, the Eagles postponed their Honors acceptance until the following year because Glenn Frey had health problems that required major surgery and a long recovery period. Despite their absence, they were still honored in 2015 via a performance of &quot;Desperado&quot; by country singer Miranda Lambert. Frey died on January 18, 2016; the center made him and the three surviving Eagles members 2016 Honorees.

In 2017, Norman Lear accepted the Honor but boycotted the White House ceremony because of his opposition to President Donald Trump, citing Trump&#x27;s proposal to end the National Endowments for the Humanities and for the Arts. Lear did attend the 2017 events and ceremony. However, Donald and Melania Trump were not present, becoming the first U.S. presidential couple to skip the event &quot;to allow the Honorees to celebrate without any political distraction&quot;.
