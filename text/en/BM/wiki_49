<text>Execution in computer and software engineering is the process by which a computer or virtual machine interprets and acts on the instructions of a computer program. Each instruction of a program is a description of a particular action which must be carried out, in order for a specific problem to be solved. Execution involves repeatedly following a &quot;fetch–decode–execute&quot; cycle for each instruction done by the control unit. As the executing machine follows the instructions, specific effects are produced in accordance with the semantics of those instructions. 

Programs for a computer may be executed in a batch process without human interaction or a user may type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter. In this case, the &quot;commands&quot; are simply program instructions, whose execution is chained together. 

The term run is used almost synonymously. A related meaning of both &quot;to run&quot; and &quot;to execute&quot; refers to the specific action of a user starting (or &quot;launching&quot; or &quot;invoking&quot;) a program, as in &quot;Please run the application.&quot;

== Process ==

Prior to execution, a program must first be written. This is generally done in source code, which is then compiled at compile time (and statically linked at link time) to produce an executable. This executable is then invoked, most often by an operating system, which loads the program into memory (load time), possibly performs dynamic linking, and then begins execution by moving control to the entry point of the program; all these steps depend on the Application Binary Interface of the operating system. At this point execution begins and the program enters run time. The program then runs until it ends, either in a normal termination or a crash.

== Executable ==

&quot;Executable code&quot;, an &quot;executable file&quot;, or an &quot;executable program&quot;, sometimes simply referred to as an &quot;executable&quot; or 
&quot;binary&quot;, is a list of instructions and data to cause a computer &quot;to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions&quot;, as opposed to a data file that must be interpreted (parsed) by a program to be meaningful. 

The exact interpretation depends upon the use. &quot;Instructions&quot; is traditionally taken to mean machine code instructions for a physical CPU. In some contexts, a file containing scripting instructions (such as bytecode) may also be considered executable.

== Context of execution ==
The context in which execution takes place is crucial. Very few programs execute on a bare machine. Programs usually contain implicit and explicit assumptions about resources available at the time of execution. Most programs execute within multitasking operating system and run-time libraries specific to the source language that provide crucial services not supplied directly by the computer itself. This supportive environment, for instance, usually decouples a program from direct manipulation of the computer peripherals, providing more general, abstract services instead.

=== Context switching ===
In order for programs and interrupt handlers to work without interference and share the same hardware memory and access to the I/O system, in a multitasking operating system running on a digital system with a single CPU/MCU, it is required to have some sort of software and hardware facilities to keep track of an executing process&#x27;s data (memory page addresses, registers etc.) and to save and recover them back to the state they were in before they were suspended. This is achieved by a context switching. The running programs are often assigned a Process Context IDentifiers (PCID).

In Linux-based operating systems, a set of data stored in registers is usually saved into a process descriptor in memory to implement switching of context. PCIDs are also used.

==Runtime==
Runtime, run time, or execution time is the final phase of a computer program″s life cycle, in which the code is being executed on the computer&#x27;s central processing unit (CPU) as machine code. In other words, &quot;runtime&quot; is the running phase of a program.

A runtime error is detected after or during the execution (running state) of a program, whereas a compile-time error is detected by the compiler before the program is ever executed. Type checking, register allocation, code generation, and code optimization are typically done at compile time, but may be done at runtime depending on the particular language and compiler. Many other runtime errors exist and are handled differently by different programming languages, such as division by zero errors, domain errors, array subscript out of bounds errors, arithmetic underflow errors, several types of underflow and overflow errors, and many other runtime errors generally considered as software bugs which may or may not be caught and handled by any particular computer language. 

=== Implementation details ===
When a program is to be executed, a loader first performs the necessary memory setup and links the program with any dynamically linked libraries it needs, and then the execution begins starting from the program&#x27;s entry point. In some cases, a language or implementation will have these tasks done by the language runtime instead, though this is unusual in mainstream languages on common consumer operating systems.

Some program debugging can only be performed (or is more efficient or accurate when performed) at runtime. Logic errors and array bounds checking are examples. For this reason, some programming bugs are not discovered until the program is tested in a production environment with real data, despite sophisticated compile-time checking and pre-release testing. In this case, the end-user may encounter a &quot;runtime error&quot; message. 

=== Application errors (exceptions) ===
Exception handling is one language feature designed to handle runtime errors, providing a structured way to catch completely unexpected situations as well as predictable errors or unusual results without the amount of inline error checking required of languages without it. More recent advancements in runtime engines enable automated exception handling which provides &quot;root-cause&quot; debug information for every exception of interest and is implemented independent of the source code, by attaching a special software product to the runtime engine.

== Runtime system ==

A &quot;runtime system&quot;, also called &quot;runtime environment&quot;, primarily implements portions of an execution model. This is not to be confused with the runtime lifecycle phase of a program, during which the runtime system is in operation. When treating the &quot;runtime system&quot; as distinct from the &quot;runtime environment&quot; (RTE), the first may be defined as a specific part of the application software (IDE) used for programming, a piece of software that provides the programmer a more convenient environment for running programs during their production (testing and similar), while the second (RTE) would be the very instance of an execution model being applied to the developed program which is itself then run in the aforementioned &quot;runtime system&quot;.

Most programming languages have some form of runtime system that provides an environment in which programs run. This environment may address a number of issues including the management of application memory, how the program accesses variables, mechanisms for passing parameters between procedures, interfacing with the operating system, and otherwise. The compiler makes assumptions depending on the specific runtime system to generate correct code. Typically the runtime system will have some responsibility for setting up and managing the stack and heap, and may include features such as garbage collection, threads or other dynamic features built into the language.

==Instruction cycle==

The &quot;instruction cycle&quot; (also known as the &quot;fetch–decode–execute cycle&quot;, or simply the &quot;fetch-execute cycle&quot;) is the cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) follows from boot-up until the computer has shut down in order to process instructions. It is composed of three main stages: the fetch stage, the decode stage, and the execute stage. 

In simpler CPUs, the instruction cycle is executed sequentially, each instruction being processed before the next one is started. In most modern CPUs, the instruction cycles are instead executed concurrently, and often in parallel, through an instruction pipeline: the next instruction starts being processed before the previous instruction has finished, which is possible because the cycle is broken up into separate steps.

== Interpreter ==

A system that executes a program is called an interpreter of the program. Loosely speaking, an interpreter directly executes a program. This contrasts with a language translator that converts a program from one language to another before it is executed.

== Virtual machine ==

A &quot;virtual machine&quot; (&quot;VM&quot;) is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

Virtual machines differ and are organized by their function, shown here:

* System virtual machines (also termed full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments which are isolated from one another, yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, virtualization-specific hardware, primarily from the host CPUs.
* Process virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment.

Some virtual machine emulators, such as QEMU and video game console emulators, are designed to also emulate (or &quot;virtually imitate&quot;) different system architectures thus allowing execution of software applications and operating systems written for another CPU or architecture. OS-level virtualization allows the resources of a computer to be partitioned via the kernel. The terms are not universally interchangeable.

<text>Pushchino () is a town in Moscow Oblast, Russia, an important scientific center of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Situated south of Moscow, and 13 km south-east of Serpukhov, on the right side of the Oka River opposite the Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Reserve. It is informally called Pushchino-on-Oka. Population: 

Pushchino Research Center of Russian Academy of Sciences has unique status and significance. It hosts a major component of Russian Federation endeavor in the fields of physical, chemical, and bio-molecular biology. It employs more than 3000 people, of whom 800 hold doctorates in science or medicine. Pushchino scientists have made seminal contributions to molecular and cell biology, bio-organic chemistry, plant and soil biology, as well as to astronomy and astrophysics - including the discovery of the solar supercorona and radial magnetic fields within it, and the discovery of radio recombination lines of highly excited atoms.

==History==

The town takes its name from the village of Puschino, which was first mentioned in the 1579 records (&#x27;cadasters&#x27;) of Ivan the Terrible as being a fiefdom of the Pushchin family. The modern town of Pushchino was founded in 1956 on the hill above the Oka River, some of the highest ground in the Moscow Region, to host the new Radio Astronomy Observatory, an important resource that continues to contribute to mapping of space flights. This was followed by the establishment of Pushchino as a Science City, focusing on biological sciences. It was granted town status in 1966.

Several mesolithic, neolithic, and Bronze Age settlements exist in the area around Pushchino. Dyakovo culture artifacts have been found on the outskirts of the modern town. An Iron Age hillfort dates back 2500 years. 1 km to the west of Pushchino on important Oka river ford in the 12th to 16th Centuries there stood the ancient Russian town of Teshilov (see), earthworks of which can be seen today.

At the end of the 18th century, a prominent country house was established overlooking the water at Pushchino, which for a time became the home of Alexander Alyabyev (1787–1851), an acclaimed composer. During World War II Axis tank divisions reached 20 km from Pushchino, and until 1970 the mansion served as a hospital. The mansion was the setting for the director N. Mikhalkov&#x27;s 1974 film ‘An Unfinished Play for Mechanical Piano&#x27;. The Pushchino mansion is now in disrepair and the ruins are still an important tourist site.
German infantry took Pushchino briefly.

==Development of Pushchino==

The President of the USSR Academy of Science (Alexander Nesmeyanov, 1899-1980) advocated the formation of a biological research center equipped with the latest equipment and facilities. In 1955 the Council of Ministers established a special commission tasked to find a site in the Moscow region. By March 1956 two options were selected, both on the Oka River: at Tarusa, and the other at Pushchino. Given the proximity of Tarusa to Polenovo, an established cultural center, major new construction was deemed inappropriate, and in April 1956 it was decreed that a scientific campus would be constructed in the Moscow region, near the Pushchino village. The Russian Academy of Sciences was allotted a plot of land of 761.8 hectares for the construction of a scientific campus and radioastronomy station.

The structure of modern Pushchino was planned by scientists in the 1950s - two parallel roads, the residences, shops, and restaurants on the northerly road closer to the river, the institutes along the southerly road, and a large green zone and park between them.

First constructed was the Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory, which, at the time, had the world&#x27;s largest radio telescope: a parabolic antenna in the form of a giant cup and a complex network of antennas with a kilometer strip.

During construction of the town transport access was provided along a low-level road adjoining the Oka river. Seasonal flooding regularly made this road impassable for weeks, and in 1965 a new highway was constructed along the edge of the plateau to link Pushchino with Serpukhov to the west. The first institute, the Institute of Biochemistry and Physiology of Microorganisms, led by Nikolai Dmitrievich Jerusalimski, was completed in 1969, followed by the Institute of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science.

Today Pushchino is among the top-ranking academic centers in Russia.

==Geography==

Altitudes range from 104 m (beach of Oka) to 219 m on the plateau. The Oka river, one of the largest tributaries of the Volga, is a typical lowland river in the forest zone of the European part of Russia with a well-established valley. Special aspects of Oka are frequent spring and autumn floods and large fluctuations in levels. Its width at Pushchino on average is 150-200m and does not exceed 250 m, and the depth reaches 3.75 m. Average flow velocity is 0.25 m/s, mean volume 159 m³/s. Three rivers small at Pushchino make their way into the Oka: the Khokhla, the Neglyadeyka and the Lyubozhiha.

The banks of the Oka have carbon limestone outcrops on the surface, part of which is landslide blocks. In some places (the valley of the river Khokhla), limestone is covered with only a thin soil cover (15–20 cm). Karst is active at such places. Pushchino takes its water from artesian wells and the carbonate bedrock provides very calcium-rich groundwater. Glacial moraines cover the limestone at some distance from the river, while the floodplain of the Oka is fringed by remnants of late-Pleistocene sandy dunes on the surface of upper terraces. Thus, the relief of Pushchino is a preglacial elevated plateau, overlapped with Dnieper moraine and dismembered by deep erosion embedded to a depth of 130–140 m.

=== Climate ===

The climate is determined mainly by the impact of the transfer of air masses from the Atlantic Ocean, interrupted often by invasion of cold air masses from the Arctic in the rear of cyclones. In general, the climate of Pushchino is moderately continental, with moderately cold winters, warm summers and fairly stable humidity. In winter, invasions of the Atlantic cyclones are usual, which lead to frequent thaws and the rising of the temperature to 5-8 °C.

Average annual temperature is +3.9 °C, but in winter the temperature is commonly -20, the coldest recorded temperature being -44 °C. From Springtime onwards the temperature warms, with mid-20s to mid-30s being usual; the highest recorded temperature at Pushchino was 39 °C.

Average annual precipitation is 582 mm, most falling during the warm season (April to October: 394 mm, 70%), with 30% falling during the cold season (188 mm, 30%). Summer precipitation often takes the form of stormwater, leading to erosion of arable lands.

Snow in the winter comprises 20% of precipitation. Typically wide snow cover forms by late November, reaching a maximum height at the beginning of March (average 44 cm, 99 cm at maximum and 13 cm at minimum).

===Forest, natural reserves and protected areas===

The Oka river draws an approximate line between coniferous and deciduous forests. North of the Oka at Pushchino begins a mixed forest including spruce and birch that extends to Northern Russia. Pushchino itself and further south are characterized by broad-leaved forests, with a predominance of oak, linden, elm, ash, aspen, and without any admixture of spruce, before giving way to cultivated land. Near the river willow trees grow in dense thickets.

Pushchino City has an active conservation program - Ecopolis - that has identified several areas now subject to conservation measures. These include:
# Lyubozhikha River Valley: a protected area is located at the foot of Pushchino hill. Wildlife species include nightingales, orioles, owls, and beavers.
# Teshilov hillfort: a historical monument that is now subject to state preservation. It is located 700 meters from the river Lyubozhikha. Earthwork ramparts and moat are well preserved. In 1925 archeological excavations discovered a fortress on the site dating to the 12th century. The settlement was mentioned in Russian chronicles in 1147.
# Khokhla River Valley: this protected area lies 2.5 km west of Lyubozhikha between the lower and upper roads to Serpukhov. This deep valley is renowned for its natural beauty, with dense forestation, meadow hills, limestone outcrops, and waterfalls. Rare flowers include forget-me-nots, anemones, gentians, and coronilla elfworts. The Zaoksky Forestry Commission reports an exceptional diversity of tree species; recent construction work imperils the reserve.
# Entomological Meadow: this protected area is located in the south-western outskirts of the city and occupies a meadow on slope of the right tributary of the Lyubozhikha river (Solonovka creek). The name of the river shows its direction (the old Russian word &quot;Sologne&quot;, &quot;posolon&quot; meaning &quot;going behind the Sun&quot;, that is, from east to west). Until the 1930 this was the site of a village (Solonovka). The meadow slopes are a home to rare species of butterflies: the red and ordinary melitaea, small limenitis, chalkhill blue, Nordmannia spini, skippers and others.
# Solonovsky Wood protected area: a deep ravine of Solonovka east from the Pushchino-Serpukhov road. &quot;Gremyak&quot; creek falls on limestone from high slope.
# Birch Grove protected area: a pure birch forest on the Solonovka tributary south of Pushchino (the Endova site).
# Oak Wood protected area: also known as Perlovskii Reserve, an area dominated by mature oak trees.
# Neglyadeyka River Valley protected area: a narrow strip of forested slopes of the eastern tributary of the Oka at the eastern boundary of Puschino with villages of Balkovo and Mitinki.

==Administrative and municipal status==

Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Pushchino Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Pushchino Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Pushchino Urban Okrug., and was officially recognized as a Science City of the Russian Federation in 2006.

==Science==

Pushchino is an academic research center focusing on microbiology, molecular biology, biophysics, and astronomy. The town hosts a core group of key Research institutes and a University Institute:
*Institute of Basic Biological Problems
*Institute of Biochemistry and Physiology of Microorganisms
*Institute of Bio-Organic Chemistry, Pushchino Branch
*Institute of Cell Biophysics
*Institute of Mathematical Problems of Biology
*Institute of Protein Research
*Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics
*Pushchino Radioastronomy Observatory
*Pushchino State University, now the Pushchino State Institute of Natural Sciences, and a branch of Moscow State University

Pushchino hosts the annual Russia-wide &#x27;Conference of Young Scientists&#x27;

==Culture==

The prevailing religious culture is of Russian Orthodoxy, and a new church of Archangel Michael was completed in 1990. The School of Music, named after A. Alyabyev, has about 300 students, and Pushchino hosts the annual and widely renowned &#x27;Song and Bard Festival&#x27;. The town facilities include Sport Palace Oka, ski training, and a rowing base &#x27;Delphin&#x27; on the Oka. A focus for cultural life is the &#x27;House of Scientists&#x27;.

<text>North Lee is a hamlet in the parish of Ellesborough, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located in the very north of the parish, near the main road that links Aylesbury with Wendover.

The hamlet name is a compound of English and Anglo Saxon languages, and refers to the northernmost clearing. The name refers to the adjacent hamlet of Nash Lee.

Today North Lee has survived more or less unscathed from the construction of the Wendover Bypass, though the road that leads to North Lee is now a dead end rather than a through road to Wendover.</text><links>

<doc id="418212" wikidata="Q23419" url="?curid=418212" title="Merlon">
<text>A merlon is the solid, upright section of a battlement (a crenellated parapet) in medieval architecture or fortifications. Merlons are sometimes pierced by narrow, vertical embrasures, or tooth-like slits designed for observation and fire. The space between two merlons is called a crenel, and a succession of merlons and crenels is a crenellation. Crenels designed in later eras for use by cannons were also called embrasures.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;merlon&quot; comes from French [1704], adapted from the Italian , possibly a shortened form of , perhaps connected to Latin (&quot;two-pronged pitchfork&quot;), or from a diminutive , from or (a wall). An alternative etymology suggests that the medieval Latin (mentioned from the end of the 10th century) functioned as a diminutive of Latin , &quot;blackbird&quot;, expressing an image of this bird sitting on a wall.

==As part of battlements==

As an essential part of battlements, merlons were used in fortifications for millennia. The best-known examples appear on medieval buildings, where battlements, though defensive, could be attractively formed, thus having a secondary decorative purpose. Some (especially later) buildings have false &quot;decorative battlements&quot;. The two most notable European variants in Middle Ages merlons shape were the Ghibelline and the Guelph merlon: the former ended in the upper part with a swallow-tailed form, while the latter term indicates the normal rectangular shape merlons (wimperg).

Other shapes include: three-pointed, quatrefoil, shielded, flower-like, rounded (typical of Islamic and African world), pyramidal, etc., depending either from the type of attacks expected or aesthetic considerations.

In Roman times, the merlons had a width sufficient to shelter a single man. As new weapons appeared in the Middle Ages (including crossbows and the first firearms), the merlons were enlarged and provided with loop-holes of various dimensions and shapes, varying from simply rounded to cruciform. From the 13th century, the merlons could also be used to pivot wooden shutters; these added further protection for the defenders when they were not firing, or were firing downwards near the base of the wall. The shutters, also known as mantlets, could be opened by hand, or by using a pulley.

==Later use==
After falling out of favour when the invention of the cannon, forced fortifications to take a much lower profile, merlons re-emerged as mostly decorative features in buildings constructed in the Gothic Revival style of the 19th century.

<doc id="418214" wikidata="Q11790739" url="?curid=418214" title="Nettleden">
<text>Nettleden is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Nettleden with Potten End, in the Dacorum district, in the county of Hertfordshire, England. It is in the Chiltern Hills, about four miles north-west of Hemel Hempstead, near Little Gaddesden, Great Gaddesden and Frithsden. In 1931 the parish had a population of 133.

==Etymology==
The village name of Nettleden is Anglo-Saxon in origin and means &#x27;valley where nettles grow&#x27;. In manorial records of the late twelfth century the village was recorded as &quot;Neteleydene&quot;.

==History==
Historically, Nettleden was a hamlet in the parish of Pitstone in Buckinghamshire, although the boundary of the hamlet was almost surrounded by the county of Hertfordshire. Nettleden was included in the Berkhamsted Poor Law Union from 1835. As Nettleden had its own overseer of the poor, it was deemed to be a separate civil parish from 10 August 1866 under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866. When district councils were established in December 1894, Nettleden was included in the Berkhamsted Rural District, which was temporarily allowed to straddle Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire pending Nettleden being transferred to Hertfordshire, which happened on 30 September 1895.

The church, St Lawrence, was first mentioned in 1285 when it became a part of the endowment of Ashridge Monastery. The church, except for the tower, was largely rebuilt in brick by John, Earl of Bridgewater, in 1811. Until 1895 it was a chapelry of Pitstone.

The hamlet of St Margaret&#x27;s, formerly belonging to Ivinghoe in Buckinghamshire, was added to the parish of Nettleden in 1895 at the same time as the county boundary change. Here, Henry de Blois, bishop of Winchester, founded the nunnery of St Margaret&#x27;s de Bosco. After the Dissolution in 1539, St Margaret&#x27;s came into private hands. During the Second World War, St Margaret&#x27;s Camp was a London County Council senior school for evacuee boys from London. The school closed one week after the end of the war in Europe, when all the boys were returned to their homes in London. Since 1984 it has been the Amaravati Buddhist Monastery.

On 1 April 1937 the civil parish of Nettleden was abolished, joining with parts of the parishes of Great Berkhampstead Rural and Northchurch to form a new parish called Nettleden with Potten End.

From Nettleden to Frithsden runs the &quot;Roman Road&quot; or &quot;Spooky Lane&quot;, named in reference to the ghost of an Ashridge monk. In the early 19th century, the lane was dug deeper into the hill, with high revetted walls on both sides, and a bridge was built over the lane, in order that people using the driveway leading to Ashridge did not meet the villagers. Another feature of Nettleden is the steep Pipers Hill to the east of the village.

<text>Dirk Arthur Kempthorne (born October 29, 1951) is an American politician who served as the 49th United States Secretary of the Interior from 2006 to 2009 under President George W. Bush. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as a United States Senator from Idaho from 1993 to 1999 and the 30th governor of Idaho from 1999 to 2006.

Kempthorne was first elected to public office as Mayor of Boise in 1985, where he served for seven years. He serves as a co-chair of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. In November 2010, he was appointed president and CEO of the American Council of Life Insurers.

==Early life, education and early career==
Raised in San Bernardino, California, Kempthorne graduated from San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino. He attended San Bernardino Valley College, then transferred north to the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he graduated in 1975 with a degree in political science, and served a term as student body president. Upon graduation Kempthorne served as an assistant to the director of the Idaho Department of Lands and then as executive vice president of the Idaho Home Builders Association.

In 1982, Kempthorne managed the gubernatorial campaign for Lieutenant Governor Phil Batt, who lost to the incumbent Democrat, Governor John V. Evans. In 1983 Kempthorne became state public affairs manager for FMC Corporation.

Kempthorne and his wife, Patricia Kempthorne, also a UI graduate, have two adult children, Heather and Jeff.

Kempthorne is of Cornish ancestry.

==Political career==
===Mayor of Boise===
Kempthorne&#x27;s first major political victory came at age 34, when he was elected mayor of Boise in 1985. As mayor, Kempthorne became very popular and was unopposed for reelection in 1989.

=== U.S. Senate ===
In 1992, U.S. Senator Steve Symms decided not to seek a third term and Kempthorne pursued the Republican nomination for the seat. In the general election, Kempthorne defeated Democratic U.S. Representative Richard H. Stallings.

In the Senate, Kempthorne sponsored and helped pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, a bill meant to prohibit Congress from imposing unfunded federal mandates on states. The bill aimed to:

[C]urb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on States and local governments; to strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and State, local and tribal governments; to end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those governments in complying with certain requirements under Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.

Also in 1995, Senator Kempthorne introduced amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill was signed into law by President Clinton on August 6, 1996.

During his six years in the Senate, Kempthorne scored a &quot;0&quot; on the League of Conservation Voters&#x27; legislative scorecards every year except 1993, when he scored 6 percent on the basis of one vote against funding a rocket booster for the space program that environmentalists judged harmful to the environment. His overall LCV score for that period was less than 1%.

===Governor of Idaho===
Kempthorne was expected to run for reelection in 1998, but instead decided to run for the open seat for governor. The incumbent, Phil Batt, shocked the state by announcing his retirement after only one term in office, citing his age (71) as the prime factor in his decision. Kempthorne&#x27;s Senate seat would be won by Republican congressman Mike Crapo of Idaho Falls.

Kempthorne won the gubernatorial election in a landslide, receiving 68 percent of the vote while his Democratic opponent, Robert C. Huntley, received only 29 percent. He was reelected in 2002 with 56 percent of the vote; his Democratic opponent, Jerry Brady, polled 42 percent. Kempthorne&#x27;s campaign spent nearly $200,000 more than it had received in contributions prior to the election; he spent the next two years raising funds to pay off the campaign debt.

===U.S. Secretary of the Interior===
On March 16, 2006, Kempthorne was nominated by President George W. Bush to replace Gale Norton as the 49th Secretary of the Interior. On May 10, 2006, Kempthorne&#x27;s nomination was approved by voice vote by the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. He was confirmed by the full Senate on May 26 and resigned as Idaho Governor to accept the position the same day. Lieutenant Governor Jim Risch succeeded Kempthorne as Idaho Governor, filling out the remaining months of his term. Kempthorne is the second Idahoan to hold the Cabinet post. Former Governor Cecil Andrus was the Secretary of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter, serving from 1977 to 1981.

Upon Kempthorne&#x27;s appointment as Secretary of the Interior, environmental groups characterized him as someone who has &quot;almost always favored changing laws like the Endangered Species Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act to make them more favorable to commercial interests.&quot;

As Secretary of the Interior, Kempthorne was criticized for not placing any plants or animals on the federal endangered species list since his confirmation on May 26, 2006. As of September 2007, Kempthorne held the record for protecting fewer species over his tenure than any Interior Secretary in United States history, a record previously held by James G. Watt for over 20 years.

In December 2007, as a result of a long-term investigation and resignation of former Deputy Assistant Secretary Julie MacDonald, Inspector General Earl Devaney found &quot;abrupt and abrasive, if not abusive&quot; management at the department under Kempthorne&#x27;s supervision. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, attributed the &quot;untold waste of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers&#x27; dollars&quot; to MacDonald&#x27;s actions. Of the department, Representative Nick J. Rahall II, chairman of the House Natural Resources said &quot;The results of this investigation paint a picture of something akin to a secret society residing within the Interior Department that was colluding to undermine the protection of endangered wildlife and covering for one another&#x27;s misdeeds.&quot;

In September 2008, Devaney reported wrongdoing by current and former employees of the Minerals Management Service, an agency under Kempthorne&#x27;s administration that collects about $10 billion in oil and gas royalties annually, and one of the government&#x27;s largest sources of revenue other than taxes. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Eight officials in the royalty program accepted gifts from energy companies whose value exceeded limits set by ethics rules—including golf, ski and paintball outings; meals and drinks; and tickets to a Toby Keith concert, a Houston Texans football game and a Colorado Rockies baseball game ... The investigation also concluded that several of the officials &quot;frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions, had used cocaine and marijuana, and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives.&quot; The New York Times reports a whistleblower had officially complained about the wrongdoings in the spring of 2006, prior to Kempthorne&#x27;s being sworn into the office.
On December 16, 2008, the Center for Biological Diversity announced intent to sue the Interior Department under Kempthorne for introducing &quot;regulations ... that would eviscerate our nation&#x27;s most successful wildlife law by exempting thousands of federal activities, including those that generate greenhouse gases, from review under the Endangered Species Act.&quot; The lawsuit, which is critical of policy advocated by Kempthorne and President George W. Bush, was filed in the Northern District of California by the CBD, Greenpeace and Defenders of Wildlife. According to the CBD, &quot;The lawsuit argues that the regulations violate the Endangered Species Act and did not go through the required public review process. The regulations, first proposed on August 11th, were rushed by the Bush administration through an abbreviated process in which more than 300,000 comments from the public were reviewed in 2-3 weeks, and environmental impacts were analyzed in a short and cursory environmental assessment, rather than a fuller environmental impact statement.&quot;

In 2009, CNN correspondent Campbell Brown criticized Kempthorne for using &quot;$235,000 of [taxpayer] money to renovate his office bathroom at the Department of Interior.&quot; According to Brown, the costs included a shower, a refrigerator, and a freezer hidden behind lavish wood paneling, as well as &quot;DK&quot; monogrammed towels. Donald Swain, Chief of the Interior Department&#x27;s National Business Center said the towels do not exist. He further says the project came in $10,000 under budget and was approved by the General Services Administration.

<text>Kenneth Carroll Guinn (August 24, 1936 – July 22, 2010), was an American businessman, academic administrator, and politician who served as the 27th Governor of Nevada from 1999 to 2007. He previously served as interim president of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) from 1994 until 1995. Originally a Democrat, he joined the Republican Party before running for governor.

==Early life and career==

Guinn was born in Garland, Arkansas and reared in Exeter, California. He married his wife, Dema, in Reno on July 7, 1956. They had two sons, Jeff and Steve. He earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in physical education from California State University, Fresno. He received his Bachelor of Arts in 1957. In 1970, Guinn earned an Ed.D. from Utah State University in Logan.

==Governor of Nevada==
Guinn was first elected governor in 1998, defeating Democratic nominee Las Vegas Mayor Jan Laverty Jones, with 52% of the vote; Guinn became the first Republican elected governor of Nevada since 1978. When Guinn ran for re-election in 2002, he received 68% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee state Senator Joe Neal, who received only 22%. In November 2005, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him one of the five best governors in the U.S.

As Governor of Nevada, Guinn developed a reputation as a moderate Republican who was not motivated by partisan ideology. During his first term as governor, Guinn used the national tobacco settlement money, and pushed for the creation of the Millennium Scholarship program to provide all Nevada High School graduates with a 3.25 GPA, a scholarship to attend a Nevada university. He also championed a state run prescription drug benefit program for Nevada senior citizens called Senior RX. Guinn, who prided himself on his detailed knowledge of the state budget, believed Nevada&#x27;s tax structure was inherently flawed with its dependence on growth and tourism—Nevada has no income tax and relies heavily on gaming and sales tax.

Guinn proposed a tax restructuring during the 2003 legislative session that was met with opposition from anti-tax business groups and many anti-tax Republicans. After a divisive session that divided the Republicans and ended in a Nevada Supreme Court decision upholding the passage of the bill very little of Guinn&#x27;s original proposal was enacted. As Guinn had predicted the state was plunged into a serious budget deficit as soon as the 2008 recession hit the gaming and construction industry causing sales and gaming tax revenues to plummet. In percentage terms, Guinn&#x27;s 2003 tax hike was the largest tax increase ever by one of the 50 states, but it was praised as &quot;a controversial but realistic step to shore up the overstretched budget of the nation&#x27;s fastest-growing state.&quot;

In 2006, Guinn declined to endorse Jim Gibbons, the Republican nominee for Governor of Nevada, due to bitter disagreements between the two politicians. Gibbons was one of the more vocal critics of Guinn&#x27;s tax plan during the 2003 legislative session. Guinn said only that he hoped a Republican would succeed him as governor. Gibbons defeated the Democratic nominee, Dina Titus. Guinn&#x27;s second term as governor ended on January 1, 2007, due to lifetime term limits established by the Nevada Constitution. His official portrait was painted by artist Michele Rushworth and hangs in the state capitol in Carson City, Nevada.

Guinn served as a board member of MGM Resorts International (formerly MGM Mirage) from May 22, 2007, until his untimely death on July 22, 2010, under chairman and CEO Terrence Lanni (1995–2008) and James Murren (2008–present).

== Death ==
After leaving the governorship, Guinn became a board member of MGM Resorts International (formerly MGM Mirage) on May 22, 2007, serving under chairman and CEO Terrence Lanni (1995–2008) and James Murren (2008–present). Guinn died on July 22, 2010, at the age of 73, of complications from injuries sustained after falling from the roof of his Las Vegas home and possibly following a heart attack. He was pronounced dead at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada in Las Vegas.

Guinn is interred at the Exeter District Cemetery in Exeter, California.

<text>Newton Blossomville is a village in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. It is a civil parish, sharing a joint parish council with Clifton Reynes. At the 2011 census, the population of the parish was 329, an increase of 17.5% on the 280 figure for 2001

It is located in the north of the Borough, about east of Olney, west of Bedford, and north-east of Central Milton Keynes, close to the Bucks/Beds border.

==History==
The village name &#x27;Newton&#x27; is an Old English language word meaning &#x27;new village&#x27; or &#x27;new homestead&#x27;. It was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the holdings of Clifton Reynes (Clystone) as not much was left of the original settlement. Called &#x27;Neutone&#x27; when first named independently in 1175, it gained the affix &#x27;Blossevill&#x27;, referring to the family name of the lords of the manor in the 13th century.

In 1419, it appears as &quot;Newenton Blosumvyll&quot;.

===Listed buildings and structures===
The parish has one scheduled ancient monument, one grade II* listed building, and 14 at grade II.

==Services==

Today, the only service remaining in the village is the Newton Blossomville Church of England First School. The village post office has been closed for many years, as is common for other villages of this size. The nearest railway station, , was closed when the Bedford to Northampton Line was closed in the 1960s. For a brief time the new diesel engines were tested along the railway. Some of the line remains but much is unused and overgrown or incorporated into the adjacent fields. Although, a section is used as private access to Newton Lodge Farm in Spring Lane, Clifton Reynes, coming off Clifton Road, to the west of the remains of the Clifton Road railway bridge, where once a track with a railway crossing used to run to &quot;Costerpits Farm&quot; (now a residential barn conversion).

<doc id="418223" wikidata="Q502023" url="?curid=418223" title="Coatzacoalcos">
<text>Coatzacoalcos (; formerly known as Puerto México; ; Zapotec: ; Popoluca: &quot;Puertu&quot;) is a major port city in the southern part of the Mexican state of Veracruz, mostly on the western side of the Coatzacoalcos River estuary, on the Bay of Campeche, on the southern Gulf of Mexico coast. The city serves as the municipal seat of the municipality of the same name. The city had a 2020 census population of 212,540, making it the third-largest city in the state after Veracruz and Xalapa. The municipality covers a surface area of and reported a population of 310,698 persons. The municipality population in 2015 was 319,187 a decrease of 9% over 2020.

==Etymology==
Coatzacoalcos comes from a Nahuatl word meaning &quot;site of the Snake&quot; or &quot;where the snake hides.&quot; According to the legend, this is where the god Quetzalcoatl made his final journey to the sea in around 999 and he made his promise to return.

==History==

Coatzacoalcos sits within the Olmec heartland. Excavations in 2008 for a tunnel under the Coatzacoalcos River indicate a substantial pre-Hispanic population. 
By the time of the Spanish arrival the area was under Mayan influence. In 1522, Hernán Cortés ordered Gonzalo de Sandoval to fund a settlement near Guazacualco. Sandoval named it Villa del Espíritu Santo.

San Martín Tuxtla is an active volcano lying northwest of Coatzcoalcos in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas. It erupted in 1664, in May 1793 with large ash falls and lava flows, and most recently in 1796.

The town was elevated to the category of port in 1825 and the name was changed to Coatzacoalcos.

The municipality of Coatzacoalcos was established 22 December 1881, with the town as its seat. In 1900 the town name was changed to Puerto México. In 1911 it was elevated to city, and in 1936 the name was changed to the current Coatzacoalcos.

On 23 July 1940, Coatzacoalcos welcomed refugees from the Spanish Civil War who sought asylum in Mexico after travelling across the Atlantic aboard the SS &quot;Santo Domingo&quot;.

In 1959, the city suffered damage from an 6.4 earthquake.

Coatzacoalcos became a very important crossroads during the oil boom of the 1970s, connecting the Yucatán Peninsula and oil fields in Campeche to the rest of Mexico and to the port of Salina Cruz in Oaxaca on the Pacific coast.

==Geography and climate==
The city is located at where the Coatzacoalcos River debouches into the Bay of Campeche. Overland it is connected by road and rail to the Pacific Ocean about away. This location has prompted plans for an interoceanic waterway across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, or for a much expanded railroad system, for over a century.

In the Köppen climate classification the climate is classified as Am for a tropical monsoon climate. A typical year sees more than of rainfall. Lying on the Gulf of Mexico, Coatzacoalcos has been struck by several hurricanes and tropical storms such as Hurricane Diana in August 1990, Hurricane Mitch in November 1998, Tropical Storm Larry in October 2003, Hurricane Stan in October 2005, Hurricane Dean in August 2007, Tropical Storm Marco in October 2008, Tropical Storm Hermine in early September 2010, Hurricane Karl in mid September 2010, Tropical Storm Matthew in late September 2010, Hurricane Richard in October 2010 and Hurricane Agatha in late May 2022. The winter months are cooler and drier than the summer months. Occasionally, cold high pressure cells from North America drift south across the Gulf of Mexico and drive strong Tehuano winds across the Isthmus, with very strong wind concentration taking place in Chivela Pass in Oaxaca.

==Economy==

The city&#x27;s industry is dominated by the petrochemical sector. Four big industrial petrochemical complexes are located near the city (Pajaritos, Cosoleacaque, Morelos and Cangrejera) making it one of the most important concentrations of its kind in the world. The state-owned Pemex Petroquímica subsidiary is headquartered in Coatzacoalcos and 85% of its production is concentrated there.

==Demographics==

In 2020, the municipality reported a population of 310,698 inhabitants, 212,540 residing in the municipal seat. which makes it the 3th largest in the state after Veracruz and Xalapa. Other townships include Olmec City (24,085 hab.), Allende (23,351 hab.), Villa San Martín (15,659 hab.) and Puerto Esmeralda (9,585 hab.). Coatzacoalcos is the seat of a Metropolitan Area, which together with the municipalities of Ixhuatlán del Sureste and Nanchital de Lázaro Cárdenas del Río had a population of 354,606 in 2020.

== Education ==
The Universidad Veracruzana maintains a branch campus and library in Coatzacoalcos. Also, TecNM has a campus in the city.

== Sports ==
The Tiburones Rojos de Coatzacoalcos (Red Sharks) played in the Primera División A until December 2008 when they moved to Orizaba to become part of a reformed Albinegros de Orizaba. The Delfines de Coatzacoalcos (Dolphins) play in the Estadio Rafael Hernández Ochoa, which was built in 1980. The Universidad Istmo Americana F.C. plays in the Tercera División de México and is based in Coatzacoalcos.

== Transportation ==
Coatzacoalcos has been a transportation hub for hundreds of years. It is connected via air, water, road, and rail to
the surrounding region and the rest of the world.

The Minatitlán/Coatzacoalcos National Airport is away in Cosoleacaque and has been an
international airport since August 2006.

The Port of Coatzacoalcos (Puerto México) is an international port of entry that provides transhipment of oil and petrochemicals.
After an upgrade to the railway along the Tehuantepec Route was opened in 1907 by Porfirio Díaz the port saw an increase of shipping via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, particularly from the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company. The port saw a decrease in traffic after the opening of the Panama Canal from 1914 on, but traffic has started to build up since the oil boom of the 1970s. The railway is now known as the Ferrocarril Transístmico (&quot;Trans-Isthmic Railroad&quot;).

The CG Railway operates train ferries between the Port of Coatzacoalcos and the United States at the Port of Mobile in Alabama. Ferrosur also provides rail service in and out of Coatzacoalcos as far southeast as Las Choapas, to the north and west to Veracruz and Mexico City, as well as to the south over the Tehuantepec route now owned by Ferrocarril Transístmico from Medias Aguas to Salina Cruz in the state of Oaxaca.

Mexican Federal Highway 180 follows the southern shore of the Bay of Campeche through Coatzacoalcos to the Yucatán Peninsula. Highway 180 and a rail line to Allende have been carried over the Coatzacoalcos River via the 1910 built &quot;Coatza I&quot; bridge for more than a century. A second cable stayed bridge known as &quot;Coatza II&quot; or &quot;Antonio Dovalí Jaime&quot; was built to the south to carry more road traffic over the river. It was constructed starting in 1979 and was opened by President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado on 17 October 1984. &quot;Coatza II&quot; has a center span of and an overall length of . A ferry operates between the city of Coatzacoalcos and Allende, which in 2017 was supplemented by a underwater tunnel that carries four lanes of traffic. Coatzacoalcos is also the northern terminus of Mexican Federal Highway 185, which links it with the Pacific Ocean at Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, on the other side of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

== Notable people ==
Coatzacoalcos is the birthplace of actress Salma Hayek; journalist María Antonieta Collins; and footballers Sergio Ramirez, who played for FC Ararat Yerevan, in the Armenian Premier League and José Arturo Rivas, who played for the Tigres de la UANL, in the Primera División de México. Also, Silviano Delgado Valladolid, who was part of Mexico&#x27;s National Squad during Barcelona 1992 Olympic Games and played for Toluca F.C., Puebla F.C., Morelia F.C.

<text>Newton Longville is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, within the Buckinghamshire Council unitary authority area. The village is about south-west of Bletchley in Milton Keynes.

==History==
The toponym &quot;Newton&quot; is derived from the Old English for &quot;new farm&quot;. It is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Nevtone&quot;. The affix &quot;Longville&quot; was added in the 13th century after the Cluniac priory of Longueville, Calvados, in Normandy, France, that held the manor of Newton at that time, and to distinguish this village from other places called Newton, particularly nearby Newton Blossomville. In 1441, when its previous holder died without an heir, the Crown bestowed the manor on the Warden and fellows of New College, Oxford.

Parts of the Church of England parish church of Saint Faith are late 12th century, but the exterior is largely Perpendicular Gothic.

Newton Longville has a number of cruck-framed thatched houses dating from the mid to late 15th century, with good examples at Moor End.

Newton Longville is twinned with Longueville-sur-Scie in Normandy, France.

The main industry in the village between 1847 and 1991 was brick making. The village had a large brick factory, originally belonging to the Read family, becoming the Bletchley Brick company in 1923, and then taken over by the London Brick Company (LBC) in 1929. The works made Fletton bricks and distributed them all over the country. It was closed in November 1991 after Hanson Trust bought the London Brick Company.

==Amenities==
Newton Longville Church of England Combined School is a mixed, voluntary controlled primary school, that takes children between the ages of four and eleven. It has slightly over 200 pupils.

==Salden Chase==
In 2009 Buckinghamshire County Council proposed a new settlement called &quot;Salden Chase&quot; outside Newton Longville, however due to an extended planning process work has not commenced on the development.

<doc id="418228" wikidata="Q3367716" url="?curid=418228" title="Nopal">
<text>Nopal (plural nopales) is a common name in Spanish for &quot;Opuntia&quot; cacti (commonly referred to in English as prickly pear or tender cactus), as well as for its pads. The name &quot;nopal&quot; derives from the Nahuatl word for the pads of the plant.

==Description==
There are about 114 known species in Mexico, where it is a common ingredient in numerous Mexican cuisine dishes. The &quot;nopal&quot; pads can be eaten raw or cooked, used in marmalades, soups, stews and salads, as well as being used for traditional medicine or as fodder for animals. Farmed &quot;nopales&quot; are most often of the species &quot;Opuntia ficus-indica&quot; or &quot;Opuntia matudae&quot; although the pads of almost all &quot;Opuntia&quot; species are edible. The other edible part of the &quot;nopal&quot; cactus is the fruit, called in Spanish and &quot;prickly pear&quot; in English.

==Culinary use==
&quot;Nopales&quot; are generally sold fresh in Mexico, cleaned of spines, and sliced to the customer&#x27;s wishes on the spot. They can also be found canned or bottled as &quot;nopalitos&quot;, and less often dried, especially for export. Cut into slices or diced into cubes, &quot;nopales&quot; have a light, slightly tart flavor, like green beans, and a crisp, mucilaginous texture. In most recipes, the mucilaginous liquid they contain is included in the cooking. They are at their most tender and juicy in the spring.

&quot;Nopales&quot; are most commonly used in Mexican cuisine in dishes such as &quot;huevos con nopales&quot; &quot;eggs with nopal&quot;, &quot;carne con nopales&quot; &quot;meat with nopal&quot;, &quot;tacos de nopales&quot;, in salads with tomato, onion, and &quot;queso panela&quot; (panela cheese), or simply on their own as a side vegetable. &quot;Nopales&quot; have also grown to be an important ingredient in New Mexican cuisine and in Tejano culture of Texas.

== Nutrition ==
Per US cup serving (236.6 ml), &quot;nopal&quot; fruit is an excellent source of the dietary mineral manganese (20% of the Daily Value, DV) and a good source of vitamin C (13% DV), magnesium (11% DV) and calcium (14% DV), with nutrient content improving as the plant matures. However, its calcium may not be biologically available because it is present as calcium oxalate, a non-absorbable complex in the small intestine.

== Economic value ==

The &quot;nopal&quot; cactus grows extensively throughout Mexico, being especially abundant in the central Mexican arid and semi arid regions. In Mexico there are over of land used to cultivate &quot;nopal&quot;. There are three typical ways to cultivate &quot;nopal&quot; cacti — commercial plantations, family farms and gardens, or in the wild. Approximately are used to produce prickly pear fruit, for the pads production, and to cochineal production. In 1996 there were prickly pear farmers, as well as around 8000 general &quot;nopal&quot; farmers, with all of the people involved in the processing industries and in cochineal production, employing a significant number of the Mexican population. &quot;Nopal&quot; is grown in eighteen of the Mexican states with 74% in the Mexico City metropolitan area, with an annual yield of tons of both the &quot;tuna&quot; and the pads. The farming of &quot;nopal&quot; provides many subsistence communities with employment, food, income, and allows them to remain on their land.

Detection of the cactus-eating moth &quot;Cactoblastis cactorum&quot; in Mexico in 2006 caused anxiety among the country&#x27;s phytosanitary authorities, as this insect can be potentially devastating for the cactus industry. In 1925, the same insect was successfully used in Australia to control the quickly growing population of cactus, which had become an invasive species after its introduction.

<text>Philip Eugene Batt (March 4, 1927 – March 4, 2023) was an American politician who served as the 29th Governor of Idaho from 1995 to 1999. A member of the Republican Party, Batt had previously served as the 35th Lieutenant Governor of Idaho, Chair of the Idaho Republican Party, and as a member of the Idaho Legislature.

==Early life and education==
Born in Wilder, Idaho, Batt was the fifth and youngest child of John and Elizabeth Karn Batt. He graduated from Wilder High School. Batt served sixteen months in the United States Army Air Forces during and after World War II at Lowry Field, Colorado, working as a clerk discharging veterans. He then returned to the University of Idaho and studied chemical engineering, lived in the dorms, and led a dance band, playing clarinet and tenor saxophone. (Half a century later as governor, Batt played with Lionel Hampton in Moscow, Idaho at the jazz legend&#x27;s UI festival.)

==Career==
===State offices===
Before becoming governor, Batt had been a Republican politician in Idaho for thirty years, serving in the state legislature (house 1965–1967, state senate 1967–1979), and as the 35th lieutenant governor from 1979 to 1983. He ran for governor in 1982 and was defeated in a close race by the Democratic incumbent, John Evans. The election was so close that at least one television network declared Batt the winner on election night.

Batt returned to the state senate with victories in 1984 and 1986, then resigned in the spring of 1988 to sit on the three-member state transportation board, appointed by Governor Cecil Andrus.

=== Idaho Republican Party ===
Batt was elected chairman of the Idaho Republican Party in January 1991, and after a successful two years, he stepped aside in April 1993 to re-enter electoral politics in 1994. Batt had previously run for the post in 1968 and lost to Roland Wilber, 127 to 218.

===Governor===
Batt won the Republican gubernatorial primary in 1994 with 48% of the vote, and defeated state attorney general Larry Echo Hawk in the general election 52% to 44%, for the first GOP victory for governor in 28 years. Despite high popularity, he chose to serve only one term, citing his age, and left office at age 71. Among Batt&#x27;s more notable accomplishments as governor was pushing through worker&#x27;s compensation for agricultural workers and negotiating a pact limiting nuclear waste storage in Idaho.

=== Later career ===
Batt was one of Idaho&#x27;s presidential electors for George W. Bush during the 2000 United States presidential election. Batt self-published two books after leaving office, a memoir titled &quot;The Compleat Phil Batt: A Kaleidoscope&quot; in 1999, and a compilation of humorous stories, &quot;Life as a Geezer&quot;, in 2003. Batt, who has a gay grandson who lives out of state, supported Add The Words.

=== Memorials ===
Boise has two memorials to Batt, with both acknowledging his work while in government: the Philip E. Batt Building of the Wassmuth Center for Human Rights, which opened in October 2024, as well as the Philip E. Batt Building of the Idaho Transportation Department, dedicated as such in June 2013.

== Personal life ==
On January 9, 1948, in Potlatch, Idaho, Batt eloped with Jacque Fallis of Spokane, a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. The newlyweds had to leave school a month later when Batt&#x27;s 66-year-old father was involved in a serious automobile accident which left him with limited strength and speech. Though the young Batts initially hoped to return to college, economic circumstances changed their plans and they reluctantly did not.

Jacque Batt died on September 7, 2014, after 66 years of marriage. In 2015, at age 88, Batt married Francee Riley of Boise. Batt died on March 4, 2023, the morning of his 96th birthday.

<doc id="418232" wikidata="Q11540244" url="?curid=418232" title="Agni-III">
<text>The Agni-III () is an Indian intermediate-range ballistic missile inducted into service in 2011 as the successor of the Agni-II. It has a range of and can reach targets deep inside neighbouring countries including Pakistan and China.

==Introduction==

India&#x27;s credible minimum deterrence envisaged a nuclear triad of counter-strike capability which required a long-range missile to provide robust second strike capability. India developed a larger missile, with a heavier payload and longer range in a compact configuration. 

==Description==

The Agni-III was developed as the successor to the Agni-II. Designed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Agni-III is a two-stage ballistic missile capable of nuclear weapons delivery. DRDO formed a separate propulsion plant in September 2001 to develop large-sized solid-propellant rocket engines, including the infrastructure for propellant casting. The stubby, two-stage solid-fuel missile is compact enough for easy mobility and flexible deployment on a number of surface and sub-surface platforms.

The missile is equipped with sophisticated navigation, guidance and control systems and advanced on-board computer systems. The electronic systems are designed to withstand greater vibration, heat and noise. A high-performance, indigenous ring laser gyro-based inertial navigation system was flight-tested for the first time on 7 Feb 2010.

The two stages of Agni-III has an overall diameter of . Initially, The mass of first-stage is about 32 tonnes and long, and 10 tonnes and long for second stage. The missile was expected to support a wide range of warhead configurations, with a range and a total payload weight of . The ground support system and launcher are developed by Research &amp; Development Establishment (Engineers).

The circular error probable (CEP) of Agni-III is within . The US Air Force&#x27;s National Air and Space Intelligence Center estimated that in June 2017, fewer than 10 launchers had been deployed.

== Propulsion ==

The Agni-III has two solid-fuelled stages and an overall diameter of , compatible with an Indian sub-surface launch system which has a launch-tube aperture. The first-stage booster weighs around 32 tonne and is made of advanced carbon-composite materials to provide high payload fraction (mass fraction). It is long; the second stage weighs around 11 tonne, made of maraging steel, is long and has vectoring nozzles for flight-trajectory control.

== Flight tests ==
On 9 July 2006, the first test of the Agni-III was conducted on Abdul Kalam Island (then known as Wheeler Island), near the Bhadrak coast. The launch was unsuccessful; the missile fell into the sea off the coast of Odisha, short of the target. According to the Defence Research and Development Organisation, the failure was due to a first-stage anomaly of recirculating hot gases which entered the missile-base shroud and damaged electronic components. Indian Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee called it a &quot;partial success&quot; (a euphemism indicating that the test generated useful data for diagnosis and correction), since the missile was air-borne for five minutes instead of the expected 15.

On 12 April 2007, Agni-III was successfully test-fired on from Abdul Kalam Island, off the coast of Odisha. India&#x27;s Cabinet Committee on Security announced, &quot;This test confirms the extent of India&#x27;s nuclear reach and India&#x27;s nuclear deterrence as the missile can accurately hit targets at distance more than 3000 km away&quot;. The Agni-III is the most powerful and capable of India&#x27;s missile inventory; capable of carrying a variety of warheads (including nuclear warheads), it can be launched from a number of platforms and extends India&#x27;s regional power projection.

On 7 May 2008, the missile was again test-fired successfully. After a flight of about 15 minutes, defence scientists confirmed that the test was successful and the missile met all requirements. With a velocity of 5,000 meters per second, the Agni-III has a range of ; new navigation software will increase the missile&#x27;s accuracy and lethality. The successful 2008 test opened the door for the next-generation Indian ICBM Agni V, with a range. The Agni-III&#x27;s development test was postponed for unknown reasons in August 2009.

On 7 February 2010, it was again tested successfully on Abdul Kalam Island in Odisha. The missile hit the target accurately (witnessed by two ships near the target), and met all mission objectives. Supporting a range of warhead configurations, the Agni-III has a total payload weight of . The two-stage, solid-fuel missile is small enough for easy mobility and flexible deployment from a number of surface and sub-surface platforms. The test validated its nuclear-triggering mechanism, indicating that the Agni-III is intended for strategic nuclear deterrence. The test launch was part of the missile&#x27;s pre-induction into the Indian Army.

India&#x27;s defence minister announced in August of that year that the Agni-III was ready for induction into the country&#x27;s armed forces, and its induction was reported in June 2011. In September 2012, it was reported that a missile group of Agni-IIIs was being raised.

On 21 September 2012, the Strategic Forces Command successfully test-fired an Agni III missile from a rail mobile launcher. The missile was again successfully tested on 23 December 2013, on 16 April 2015, and on 27 April 2017.

On 30 November 2019, the missile&#x27;s first night trial was conducted. The test reportedly failed, with the missile beginning to diverge from its planned flight trajectory after and mission control aborting the flight. A manufacturing defect was thought to be a possible cause of the failure.

<text>Larry J. Echo Hawk (born August 2, 1948) is an American attorney, legal scholar, and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, Echo Hawk served under U.S. President Barack Obama as the United States Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs from 2009 to 2012. He previously served as the Attorney General of Idaho from 1991 to 1995, the first Native American elected to the position, and spent two terms in the Idaho House of Representatives. In 2012, he was called as a general authority of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). As of 2022, Echo Hawk is the last Democrat to have served as Attorney General of Idaho.

==Early life and education==
Echo Hawk was born into the federally-recognized Pawnee Nation in Cody, Wyoming, in 1948 to Ernest and Emma Jane Echo Hawk, where his father worked with the oil and gas industry. He is enrolled as a member of the tribe, whose reservation is in Oklahoma. Before Echo Hawk started first grade, his family moved to Farmington, New Mexico. His family joined the LDS Church when he was 14.

Echo Hawk attended Brigham Young University on a football scholarship. After earning a degree in physical education and zoology, Echo Hawk served for two years in the United States Marine Corps.

He earned a Juris Doctor in 1973 from the University of Utah. He then earned a Master of Business Administration from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

==Career==
Echo Hawk began his legal career working with California Indian Legal Services. In 1975, he started his own law practice in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1977, he became general legal counsel for the Fort Hall, Idaho-based Shoshone-Bannock Tribes. He also served as a special prosecutor for the Navajo Nation in 1985.

He later settled in Idaho, becoming active in the Democratic Party. In 1982 Echo Hawk was elected to a seat in the Idaho House of Representatives from Bannock County, where he served two terms. He was later elected Bannock County prosecuting attorney in 1986. Echo Hawk was elected Attorney General of Idaho in 1990, the first Native American elected to this position in Idaho.

Echo Hawk served as national co-chair for Native Americans for the Bill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign. He was a principal speaker at that year&#x27;s Democratic National Convention and led the Idaho delegation as chair at the convention.

In 1994 Echo Hawk announced his candidacy to succeed fellow Democrat Cecil D. Andrus, who was retiring as Governor of Idaho. Echo Hawk decisively defeated former state senator Ron Beitelspacher and an unknown candidate in the Democratic primary, fueling speculation that he could be the nation&#x27;s first Native American governor. But, he was defeated in the general election by the Republican candidate, former Lieutenant Governor Phil Batt. Echo Hawk has not been a candidate for public office since.

Shortly after the 1994 election defeat, Echo Hawk accepted a faculty position at BYU&#x27;s J. Reuben Clark Law School and returned to Utah. In that capacity he taught courses in criminal law, criminal procedure and federal Indian law. He has also published several scholarly papers.

Echo Hawk is admitted to the bar in Idaho, Utah and California.

===Native American issues===
Echo Hawk has served on the American Indian Services National Advisory Board and Board of Trustees. He was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice, a leading group on justice policy development. He has also served on the board of the American Indian Community Resource Center. John Echo Hawk, director of the Native American Rights Fund, is his brother.

Echo Hawk was appointed by President Obama as the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs in 2009. During his tenure, the government increased the amount of land held in trust for federally recognized Native American tribes by 158,000 acres, supporting their efforts to be self-supportive and to reconnect fragmented reservations. He also oversaw several water agreements made with Native American tribes. He directed implementation of the Tribal Law and Order Act. While leading Indian Affairs, he oversaw the formation of the Tribal Leadership Conference, which provides for an annual meeting between leaders or other representatives of the 566 federally recognized tribes, the U.S. president and all members of the Cabinet. He resigned his position at Interior on April 27, 2012.

In February 2019, Echo Hawk joined the administration of Utah governor Gary Herbert as special counsel on Native American affairs.

===LDS Church service ===

In the LDS Church, Echo Hawk has served as president of a student stake on the BYU campus, a bishop, and high councilor.

At the time he was elected State Attorney General in Idaho, he was serving as a member of the board of trustees of LDS Social Services.

He was accepted by church membership as a general authority and member of the First Quorum of the Seventy on March 31, 2012. During his first year as a general authority he made multiple trips throughout the southwest US, often meeting with groups of Latter-day Saint Native Americans. From 2013 to 2015, Echo Hawk served as second counselor in the presidency of the church&#x27;s Philippines Area. From 2015 to 2018, Echo Hawk served as an assistant executive director of the church&#x27;s Correlation Department. He was also a member of the LDS Church&#x27;s Boundary and Leadership Change Committee. On October 6, 2018, Echo Hawk was released and designated an emeritus general authority.

== Personal life ==
He later baptized Teresa &quot;Terry&quot; Pries, whom he had been dating for several years. In 1968, their marriage in the Salt Lake Temple was performed by Spencer W. Kimball, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The couple have had six children together.

<text>North Crawley is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. It is located near the border with Bedfordshire, about east of Newport Pagnell, and north-east of Central Milton Keynes.

The village name &#x27;Crawley&#x27; is an Old English language word, and means &#x27;clearing frequented by crows&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was referred to as &quot;Crauelai&quot;. In manorial records in 1197 the area was split into Great Crawley and Little Crawley. The prefix &#x27;North&#x27; was added sometime before 1398. Local speculation has it that the prefix was added to distinguish the village from the town of Crawley in West Sussex but supporting historical evidence remains to be found. The hamlet of Little Crawley still exists under that name.

Anciently North Crawley was the location of a monastery dedicated to Saint Firmin. The monastery was recorded in the Domesday Book, though had fallen into such decay by the Dissolution of the Monasteries that little notice was taken of it, and it fell into ruin shortly afterwards. The Anglican parish church continues to be dedicated to the saint.

The village has a number of different societies. They range form the Women&#x27;s Institute and Masonic Lodges to the Historical Society. There is also North Crawley Cricket Club and North Crawley Bowls Club.

There are two public houses in North Crawley. One named The Cock, the other named The Chequers. There also used to be a third pub named The Castle in North Crawley.

<text>The New America is the eleventh studio album by punk band Bad Religion. It was released in 2000 and is their last album (to date) on Atlantic Records.

&quot;The New America&quot; is also Bad Religion&#x27;s last album with Bobby Schayer on drums. Though not yet credited as a member of the band, then-former and now-current guitarist Brett Gurewitz co-wrote and played guitar on the song &quot;Believe It&quot;. The album was re-released by Epitaph Records on September 15, 2008. Like its predecessor, none of the album&#x27;s songs would develop into live staples; only the title track is performed live occasionally.

==Musical style and lyrics==

The album was initially titled &quot;The Last Word&quot;, before being changed to &quot;The New America&quot; as a large number of people thought the band was breaking up. The album marks a departure for the band, as some of the songs are personal, rather than political in nature, and more optimism is employed. Topics range from singer Greg Graffin&#x27;s recent divorce to his past growing up as a punk kid in the early &#x27;80s. Apart from Brett Gurewtiz&#x27;s guest contribution, it is the only Bad Religion album solely written by Graffin.

==Production==

&quot;The New America&quot; was recorded from October to December 1999 at Victor&#x27;s Barn, Kauai, Hawaii and produced by Todd Rundgren. Rundgren had been one of the musicians Greg Graffin looked up to while growing up. However, working with Rundgren proved to be a disappointment to the band and especially Graffin, because they did not get along well with each other. Graffin however would later write in his book, &quot;Anarchy Evolution&quot;, that although Rundgren was difficult to work with, they remain friends to this day. Graffin reflected on the recording of &quot;The New America&quot; with Rundgren in an even more positive light in his 2023 memoir &quot;Punk Rock Paradox&quot;, calling it a &quot;great experience.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;The New America&quot; was released on May 9, 2000, and is the last Bad Religion album distributed via Atlantic Records to date. The release of &quot;The New America&quot; marked the band&#x27;s fulfillment of their four-album contract with Atlantic Records, allowing the band to reconvene with former band-mate Brett Gurewitz for their next album, 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Process of Belief&quot;, released on Epitaph Records. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, a music video was made for &quot;New America&quot;, which features two children playing with action figures of the band. The band promoted it with a supporting slot for Blink-182, and appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot; and &quot;Core Culture&quot;. In March 2001, the band toured South America, supporting Biohazard for two of the shows.

==Reception==

&quot;The New America&quot; peaked at number 88 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), wrote that working with Rundgren &quot;opens the band&#x27;s already wide-screen sound into a whole new dimension of sonic insanity.&quot;

<doc id="418237" wikidata="Q775708" url="?curid=418237" title="Mach wave">
<text>In fluid dynamics, a Mach wave, also known as a weak discontinuity, is a pressure wave traveling with the speed of sound caused by a slight change of pressure added to a compressible flow. These weak waves can combine in supersonic flow to become a shock wave if sufficient Mach waves are present at any location. Such a shock wave is called a Mach stem or Mach front. Thus, it is possible to have shockless compression or expansion in a supersonic flow by having the production of Mach waves sufficiently spaced (&quot;cf.&quot; isentropic compression in supersonic flows). A Mach wave is the weak limit of an oblique shock wave where time averages of flow quantities don&#x27;t change (a normal shock is the other limit). If the size of the object moving at the speed of sound is near 0, then this domain of influence of the wave is called a Mach cone.

== Mach angle ==

A Mach wave propagates across the flow at the Mach angle &quot;μ&quot;, which is the angle formed between the Mach wave wavefront and a vector that points opposite to the vector of motion. It is given by
:formula_1
where &quot;M&quot; is the Mach number.

Mach waves can be used in schlieren or shadowgraph observations to determine the local Mach number of the flow. Early observations by Ernst Mach used grooves in the wall of a duct to produce Mach waves in a duct, which were then photographed by the schlieren method, to obtain data about the flow in nozzles and ducts. Mach angles may also occasionally be visualized out of their condensation in air, for example vapor cones around aircraft during transonic flight.

<text>Rodger Wilton Young (April 28, 1918July 31, 1943) was a United States Army infantryman from Ohio during World War II. Born in the small town of Tiffin, Ohio, in 1932, Young suffered a sports injury in high school that led to his becoming nearly deaf and blind. Despite this, he was able to pass the exams necessary to enter the Ohio National Guard. Soon after the United States entered World War II, Young&#x27;s company was activated as part of the U.S. Army. Soon after his activation, in 1943, Young was killed on the island of New Georgia in Solomon Islands while helping his platoon withdraw from a Japanese ambush. For his actions, he was posthumously awarded the United States&#x27; highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor.

In remembrance of Young, the songwriter Frank Loesser wrote &quot;The Ballad of Rodger Young&quot;, a war song based on Young&#x27;s Medal of Honor citation. The night infiltration course at Fort Moore is named for Young, as is a small arms firing range at Camp Perry. Rodger Young Village was a veteran&#x27;s living community set up near Laguna, California (now paved over as a freeway).

==Early life and education==
Young was born on April 28, 1918, in Tiffin, Ohio, to Nicholas and Ester Young. He had four siblings; three brothers and one sister. For much of his early life, Young lived in the town of Green Springs, Ohio, but later in his childhood he and his family moved to Clyde, Ohio. Throughout his childhood, Young enjoyed hunting, which improved his marksmanship skills.

Although a small-statured boy, Young was a keen athlete. While in high school, he tried out for his school&#x27;s football team. He was not accepted at first, but eventually, his effort and enthusiasm in practices persuaded the coach to allow him to play in some games.

During a high school basketball game, Young received a serious head injury after contact with an opponent. The incident led to significant but gradual damage to his hearing and eyesight. Because of this, he had to drop out of high school in his sophomore year, at which point his hearing and vision loss had progressed to a severe point.

==Military service==
Looking for ways to earn extra income and thinking that, because of his health issues, he would fail the normal Army medical exam, Young applied to the Ohio National Guard in 1939. Despite his poor sight and hearing, Young was accepted and posted to &quot;B&quot; Company, 148th Infantry Regiment of the 37th Infantry Division. Although Young was the shortest man in his company and wore glasses, he was considered a good soldier by his peers.

=== World War II ===
In October 1940, a year after joining the National Guard, Young and his unit were activated for federal service as part of American preparations for World War II. At that time, Young was a corporal, training new recruits in handling small arms. Following a promotion to sergeant, he was assigned to lead an infantry squad. In 1942, soon after America&#x27;s entry into the war, the 148th embarked for Fiji, in the Pacific, and after that to the nearby Solomon Islands for training prior to a deployment to the Japanese-held island of New Georgia. By this time, Young&#x27;s hearing and eyesight had deteriorated to a point where, taking into account the safety of those under him, Young requested a demotion to private, which would render him unable to command a squad.

When Young submitted his request to the company commander, the commander initially thought Young was malingering in order to avoid combat; however, a medical examination carried out soon after determined that Young was nearly deaf, which convinced the commander to demote him. The examining doctor recommended that Young go to a field hospital for treatment. However, not wanting to miss the New Georgia landing, Young requested to remain with his squad. The commander accepted his request and a week later, on July 31, 1943, Young carried out the actions that led to his posthumous award of the Medal of Honor.

Nine days into the Battle of Munda Point, on July 31, Young was assigned to a 20-man patrol sent out at around 4:00 p.m. to reconnoiter Japanese territory. After achieving their objective, the patrol was returning to American lines when they were ambushed by five Japanese soldiers. Heavy fire from the enemy, who were concealed in a machine gun pit on higher ground, prevented further forward movement by the patrol. Two soldiers were killed in the initial burst and Young was wounded. During an attempt to flank the enemy, two more soldiers were killed. At this point, the patrol leader ordered a withdrawal.
Young, ignoring the order to withdraw and his wound, began crawling towards the Japanese position. Another machine gun burst wounded Young a second time, but he continued his advance, drawing the enemy fire away from his squad. As Young drew closer to the machine gun pit, he began responding with rifle fire and by throwing hand grenades at the nest, wounding or killing most of the soldiers inside. Young was soon hit by enemy fire and killed. Because of his actions, Young&#x27;s platoon was able to withdraw from the ambush without any further casualties.
On January 6, 1944, Young&#x27;s family was presented with the Medal of Honor.
Young&#x27;s Medal of Honor citation reads:

On July 31, 1943, the infantry company of which Pvt. Young was a member, was ordered to make a limited withdrawal from the battle line in order to adjust the battalion&#x27;s position for the night. At this time, Pvt. Young&#x27;s platoon was engaged with the enemy in a dense jungle where observation was very limited. The platoon suddenly was pinned down by intense fire from a Japanese machinegun concealed on higher ground only 75 yards away. The initial burst wounded Pvt. Young. As the platoon started to obey the order to withdraw, Pvt. Young called out that he could see the enemy emplacement, whereupon he started creeping toward it. Another burst from the machine gun wounded him the second time. Despite the wounds, he continued his heroic advance, attracting enemy fire and answering with rifle fire. When he was close enough to his objective, he began throwing hand grenades, and while doing so was hit again and killed. Pvt. Young&#x27;s bold action in closing with this Japanese pillbox and thus diverting its fire, permitted his platoon to disengage itself, without loss, and was responsible for several enemy casualties.
Young&#x27;s body was transferred to the United States in July 1949 and is now buried in McPherson Cemetery in Clyde, Ohio.

==Legacy==

At the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Moore in Georgia, the night infiltration course is named for Young. A passing grade in the course is a prerequisite for graduation; soldiers crawl through sandy and muddy terrain while live gunfire from M60 or M240B machine guns passes overhead. Fort Moore&#x27;s Recreation Center has a plaque in recognition of his bravery.

On March 1, 1945, the city of Fremont, Ohio memorialized Fremont Water Works Park by dedicating it to the memory of Rodger W. Young and members of the armed forces from Sandusky County, Ohio in World War II.

In 1945, songwriter Frank Loesser wrote &quot;The Ballad of Rodger Young&quot;. At the time, Loesser was a private serving in the Army&#x27;s Radio Production Unit. &quot;Life&quot; magazine featured the ballad&#x27;s sheet music and lyrics in a story on Young in its March 5, 1945, edition. The &quot;Life&quot; article, together with the 1949 repatriation of Young&#x27;s body to the United States, boosted the song&#x27;s popularity. Best-selling recordings were made by Burl Ives and Nelson Eddy by the end of 1949. On March 31, 1946, &quot;The Ballad of Rodger Young&quot; was sung by tenor Dennis Day on the &quot;Jack Benny Program&quot; on the radio. After the song, Jack Benny gave a speech in Young&#x27;s honor.

In 1946, a veterans&#x27; housing project was established in Los Angeles, California. This was known as the Rodger Young Village until the mid-1950s when it was destroyed. At the Ohio National Guard Training Site in Camp Perry, there is a small arms firing range named in honor of Young. Camp Perry hosts the National Rifle &amp; Pistol Championships.

Young is briefly mentioned in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1949 short story &quot;The Long Watch&quot; and in his novel &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot;, a mountain range on the moon is named for Young. In Heinlein&#x27;s novel &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, for which he was awarded the Hugo in 1959, the troop transport TFCT &quot;Rodger Young&quot; is named for him. Loesser&#x27;s ballad also features on several occasions in the book. Heinlein also included a &quot;Historical Note&quot; in which he quoted Young&#x27;s Medal of Honor citation. The starship is also featured in Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s adaption of the novel, named the &quot;No. 176 &quot;Rodger Young&quot;; in the movie the character Sgt. Zim pays a loose homage to Young&#x27;s history by asking to be demoted so he can join the front lines.

In January 1964, Young&#x27;s story was featured in the 15th episode of the TV historical series &quot;The Great Adventure&quot;, in which he was portrayed by James MacArthur.

<text>The common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), also known as the yellow bandit or Maryland yellow-throat, is a New World warbler. It is an abundant breeder in North America, ranging from southern Canada to central Mexico. The genus name &quot;Geothlypis&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;geo&quot;, &quot;ground&quot;, and &quot;thlupis&quot;, an unidentified small bird; &quot;thlypis&quot; is often used in the scientific names of New World warblers. The specific &quot;trichas&quot; is also from Greek; &#x27; is a kind of thrush, the word being derived from&#x27;, &quot;hair&quot;.

==Description==

Common yellowthroats are small songbirds that have olive backs, wings and tails, yellow throats and chests, and white bellies. Adult males have black face masks which stretch from the sides of the neck across the eyes and forehead, which are bordered above with white or gray. Females are similar in appearance, but have paler underparts and lack the black mask. Immature birds are similar in appearance to the adult female. First-year males have a faint black mask which darkens completely by spring.

There are 13 races of this bird. These races differ mainly in the males&#x27; facial patterns and the brightness of the yellow underparts. The southwestern forms of this bird are the brightest and the yellowest below.

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

==Habits==
The breeding habitats of these birds are marshes and other wet areas with dense low vegetation, and may also be found in other areas with dense shrub. However, these birds are less common in dry areas. Females appear to prefer males with larger masks. Common yellowthroats nest in low areas of the vegetation, laying 3–5 eggs in a cup-shaped nest. Both parents feed the young.

Northern races are nocturnal migrants, wintering in the southern parts of the breeding range, Central America and the West Indies. Southern forms are largely resident. This species is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

These birds feed on insects, which are usually captured in dense vegetation, but sometimes caught in midair.
The common yellowthroat&#x27;s song is a loud &quot;&quot;. Its call is a soft &quot;jip&quot;.
==Population==
Despite a decline in numbers, which is due to loss of favoured habitat, this species is still very common.

==Migration==
Routes of migration vary based on the season and location of common yellowthroats. During fall migration, from August to October, common yellowthroats in Canada, Western, Eastern, and Central U.S., and regions outside of the United States all have unique migration routes. When migrating in the fall months, all adults and immature individuals tend to arrive at their migration destinations around the same time. Migration differences in timing and routes are also seen during the spring months from early February to late May in these same groups across the United States, Canada, and other areas. However, males generally arrive at their destination site before the females during the spring migration months. During both fall and spring migration, many birds take time to rest during a stopover period. Some individuals stay at their stopover destinations for several weeks or months while others spend only a few days resting before they continue on in their migration patterns to their final destination.

One place of study on common yellowthroat migration that is unique and worth noting is Appledore Island, Maine. Common yellowthroats here typically migrate to this island during the spring months displaying distinct patterns of movement and stopover ecology. Analysis of the common yellowthroat spring migration from April to June was observed by researchers from the Department of Biology at Canisius College in Buffalo, New York, to determine patterns of migration and time spent resting on the island before continuing on their journey. Birds returning for more than the second time arrive earlier than birds migrating to the island for their first time. Every year, males tend to arrive on the island an average of five days earlier than females weighing more than the females upon arrival. One possible explanation for the early arrival of males to this island is the ability of males to set up territories before the females arrive. This could give them better access to resources and a higher likelihood of finding a female. However, both sexes spend about a week on the island before leaving.

Migration of common yellowthroats in Florida has also been extensively studied. In Florida, the common yellowthroat can be found more often in the southern peninsular region rather than the northern panhandle region closer to the mainland of the United States. Peak migration times of the birds in this region are during the last week of September through the second week of October. Not as much is known about spring migration in Florida, but the patterns appear similar to that of the autumn migration.

Future studies are needed to understand specific migration patterns of common yellowthroats in other parts of the United States.

==Ecology==
Common yellowthroat nests are commonly subject to brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;).

<doc id="418241" wikidata="Q2882621" url="?curid=418241" title="Bank One Corporation">
<text>Bank One Corporation was an American bank founded in 1968 and at its peak the sixth-largest bank in the United States. It traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol ONE. The company merged with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. on July 1, 2004, with Bank One CEO Jamie Dimon soon becoming CEO and Chairman of the combined company but under JPMorgan Chase branding. The company had its headquarters in the Bank One Plaza (now the Chase Tower) in the Chicago Loop in Chicago, Illinois, now the headquarters of Chase&#x27;s retail banking division.

Bank One traces its roots to the merger of Illinois based First Chicago NBD, and Ohio-based First Banc Group (later Bank One), a holding company for the City National Bank in Columbus, Ohio.

==History==

===First Banc Group===
The First Banc Group, Inc. was formed in 1968 as a holding company for City National Bank and was used as a vehicle to acquire other banks. As Ohio began to gradually relax its very restrictive Great Depression era banking laws that had severely restricted bank branching and ownership, City National Bank, through its First Banc Group parent, started to purchase banks outside of its home county. The first acquisition by the new bank holding company was the 1968 acquisition of the &quot;Farmers Saving &amp; Trust Company&quot; in Mansfield, Ohio. With each acquisition, new member banks kept their name, employees, and management while obtaining new resources from the parent holding company. This is very important when the bank holding company was expanding into primarily rural and extremely conservative markets.

In 1971, First Banc acquired Security Central National in Portsmouth, Ohio.

Initially, Ohio law did not permit bank mergers across county lines but allowed bank holding companies to own multiple banks across the state with some geographical restrictions. The newly acquired banks had to maintain their existing banking charters while each bank had to operate separately. Holding companies also were not allowed to have the word &quot;bank&quot; in their names so the word &quot;banc&quot; was used in its place.

=== Expansions by Banc One ===
====Expansion in central Ohio by Banc One Corp.====
Although Ohio law still had restricted bank mergers outside a certain geographic area, the holding company management decided to unify the marketing efforts of its member banks by having all of its members banks adopt similar names. In October 1979, First Banc Group, Inc. became Banc One Corporation, and each member bank became Bank One followed by the city or the geographic area that the member bank served. For example, &quot;City National Bank&quot; was renamed &quot;Bank One Columbus&quot;, &quot;Security Central National Bank&quot; became &quot;Bank One Portsmouth&quot;, and &quot;Farmers Saving &amp; Trust Company&quot; became &quot;Bank One Mansfield&quot;.

In 1980, Banc One acquired banks in Painesville, Ohio (Lake County National Bank; Bank One Painesville), Akron, Ohio (Firestone Bank; Bank One Akron), and Youngstown, Ohio (Union National Bank; Bank One Youngstown).

&quot;Winters National Bank&quot; in Dayton, Ohio, was acquired in 1982 and renamed &quot;Bank One Dayton&quot;. The merger with Winters National Corporation brought into the Bank One organization 42 Winters National Bank &amp; Trust Co. branch offices in the greater Dayton area, a branch in Cincinnati and three offices in Circleville. Also added were 21 Euclid National Bank branch offices in the Cleveland area which were renamed Bank One Cleveland.

====Early expansion outside Ohio====
With the change in federal and state banking laws in 1985, Banc One began to rapidly expand outside of Ohio. Its first out-of-state acquisition was of Purdue National Bank in Lafayette, Indiana which occurred just after the new laws went into effect. This bank was renamed &quot;Bank One Lafayette&quot;. This merger was quickly followed by the purchase of other small banks in Indiana and Kentucky, the only states that initially allowed bank purchases by Ohio-based banks.

The bank entered Kentucky by acquiring Citizens Union National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Lexington, Kentucky, in 1986. This bank was renamed Bank One Lexington.

Banc One acquired the Merrillville, Indiana–based Bank of Indiana and rename it Bank One Merrillville in early 1986. This was quickly followed by acquisitions in Marion, Indiana (First National Bank of Marion; Bank One Marion), Crawfordsville, Indiana (First National Bank and Trust Co. of Crawfordsville; Bank One Crawfordsville), Rensselaer, Indiana (Northwest National Bank of Rensselaer; Bank One Rensselaer) and Richmond, Indiana (First National Bank of Richmond; Bank One Richmond).

The first major merger that had an effect on the management of the holding company occurred in 1986 with the acquisition of Indianapolis-based American Fletcher Corporation, a multi-bank holding company, with its lead bank, American Fletcher National Bank &amp; Trust Company, which resulted in giving 20% of the voting stock in the new company to the former managers of American Fletcher and also had Frank E. McKinney, Jr., the head of American Fletcher, replaced John B. McCoy as president of Banc One Corp. and moved McCoy up to chairman of the combined organization. Another change made in the corporate organization was the formation of a two-tiered management system with the formation of statewide holding companies that were placed in between the regional member banks and the ultimate Banc One parent holding company. So, in Indiana, American Fletcher Corporation became Indianapolis based Banc One Indiana and all member banks in Indiana, such as Bank One Lafayette, which previously reported directly to the main parent in Columbus, reported to management in Indianapolis instead. The merger resulted in a $597.3 million swap of stock.

The merger with American Fletcher Corp. also brought along four small banks that American Fletcher had just recently acquired or was in the process of acquiring. These banks included Citizens Northern Bank of Elkhart (Bank One Elkhart), Carmel Bank &amp; Trust Co. (Bank One Carmel), First American National Bank of Plainfield (Bank One Plainfield), and Union Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Franklin (Bank One Franklin). Under Indiana law at that time, American Fletcher was not permitted to merge these banks into its main American Fletcher National Bank.

The First National Bank of Bloomington in Bloomington, Indiana, was acquired in 1987. This bank became Bank One Bloomington. With the acquisition of the Bloomington-based bank, Banc One temporarily ceased further acquisitions in the state in Indiana since they had reached that state&#x27;s cap of the percentage of ownership within that state at that time.

====Early expansion into Michigan====
Bank One expanded into the state of Michigan in late 1986 by acquiring the Citizens State Bank in Sturgis, Michigan, and convert it into Bank One Sturgis. Within a few months of the Sturgis acquisition, additional acquisitions were quickly made in East Lansing, Michigan (East Lansing State Bank; Bank One East Lansing), Fenton, Michigan (First National Bank of Fenton; Bank One Fenton) and Ypsilanti, Michigan (National Bank of Ypsilanti; Bank One Ypsilanti) a few months later.

Seven years later, Citizens Banking Corp. announced in September 1994 that they were acquiring all four Michigan banks in East Lansing, Fenton, Sturgis, and Ypsilanti from Banc One for $115 million. The divestiture was completed in February 1995.

The Bank One brand did not return to Michigan until the 1998 merger with First Chicago NBD which resulted in the rebranding of the former NBD offices.

====Expansion into Wisconsin====
Banc One&#x27;s first acquisition in a state that did not share a common border with the state of Ohio occurred in 1987 with the acquisition of Marine Corporation, the third-largest bank holding company in Wisconsin, after First Wisconsin Corporation and Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corporation. The result of this merger brought into organization 21 banks and 76 offices in Wisconsin with Marine Corp. being renamed Banc One Wisconsin Corp. and each of the subsidiary Marine Banks were renamed Bank One along their respective affiliated geographical based name. The lead bank, Marine Bank, N.A., became Bank One Milwaukee. The merger came about Marine was trying to resist an unwanted acquisition attempt by Marshall &amp; Ilsley that was initiated in June 1987 which would have resulted in massive firings.

Prior to the unwanted overtures by Marshall &amp; Ilsley, Marine went on a buying spree as soon as Wisconsin and surrounding states started loosening their restrictive bank branching and ownership laws and Marine had recently purchased banks throughout Wisconsin and most recently had purchased a bank with three branch offices in the state of Minnesota and another bank in the state of Illinois just a few months before. In late December 1986, Marine entered the Chicago market by initiating the purchase of the American branch of the Italian bank Banco di Roma, which was rename Marine Bank Chicago. Since Minnesota and Illinois forbade the bank ownership by companies based in Ohio, Marine had to sell those banks before the merger was permitted to proceed. The Minnesota banks were sold to First Bank System while the Chicago bank was sold to a lawyer with the understanding that Banc One wanted the Chicago bank back as soon as the Illinois banking laws would permit ownership by Ohio-based companies, which eventually happened in December 1990. The lawyer was able to sell the bank back to Banc One within two years at a substantial profit.

====Expansion into Texas====
Banc One entered the state of Texas in 1989 through the acquisition of a number of failed banks that were seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as a result of the late 1980s banking crises in Texas that was caused by the defaulting of a large number of real estate and energy sector loans when energy prices dropped and large numbers of people lost their jobs as a result. Although Banc One could obtain failed banks at a discount that were subsidized by the Federal government, they could also be stuck with loans in which borrowers could later default on if the economic crises worsen.

The first banks to be acquired were 20 banks that were formerly owned by MCorp, which the FDIC had consolidated into a single bank that they named the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank. The FDIC had seized the banks in March 1989. The failure of 20 of MCorp&#x27;s 24 banks cost the FDIC $2.8 billion. MCorp was the second largest bank holding company in Texas at the time of its failure. MCorp was formed in 1984 through the merger of Mercantile National Bank of Dallas with Bank of the Southwest of Houston with Mercantile becoming MBank Dallas and Southwest becoming MBank Houston.

After the acquisition, the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank became Bank One Texas with Banc One Texas formed as the state holding company. Banc One brought in managers from other parts of the Banc One organization to correct mistakes which led to the insolvency, though they kept on a few key MCorp staff whose leadership and connections were considered crucial to the transformation. Laws were changed in Texas that would allow Banc One, and other purchasers of failed banks, to operate a single bank statewide instead of being restricted by narrow geographical regions.

The next acquisition that occurred in Texas was the purchase of the failed Bright Banc Savings a few months later from the Resolution Trust Corporation in 1990. This failed savings and loan association cost the federal government $1.4 billion. The 48 former branch offices were integrated into Bank One Texas, which had 63 branch offices at that time. The following year, Banc One acquired 13 Houston-area offices of the failed Benjamin Franklin Savings from the RTC for $36 million.

In 1992, Banc One acquired Team Bancshares of Dallas, a company that was formed by a private investor group in 1988 to acquire failed and weak Texas banks, for $782 million in Banc One stock. The acquisition of Team Bank brought 56 branches into Banc One Texas, which then had 146, though a few branches needed to be closed because of branch overlaps. After this acquisition, Bank One Texas remained as the next largest bank in the state after NationsBank. The acquisition of Team Bancshares was unusual in Texas during this period since Team was making a profit at the time of sale.

====Expansion into Illinois====
Compared to other states, Illinois was very slow to allow statewide branching and multi-bank holding companies. When Illinois finally removed its last prohibition on interstate banking in December 1990, the first thing that Banc One did was to complete its planned acquisition of Marine Bank Chicago in downtown Chicago. In 1992, Banc One acquired the Marine Corp. of Springfield in Central Illinois with its 15 banking locations in Springfield, Bloomington, Champaign, and Monticello for $193 million in stock. Marine Corp. of Springfield was renamed Banc One Illinois and Marine&#x27;s lead bank, Marine Bank of Springfield, became Bank One Springfield. A few months later, Banc One acquired First Illinois with its 15 offices in suburban Chicago for $349 million in stock. Because the Illinois legislature was slow in removing obstacles against interstate banking, Banc One had to compete with Northwest and NBD, along with some Chicago-based banks, to obtain available banks in key markets in Illinois.

====Later expansion into Kentucky====
After a five-year acquisition lull in the state of Kentucky, Banc One increased its presence in northeast central Kentucky with the acquisition of Lexington-based First Security Corporation of Kentucky with its 28 offices for $204 million in stock in 1992. Most of the First Security offices were folded into Bank One Lexington with a few offices were closed because they were too close to an existing branch.

Although Banc One had a presence in Kentucky since 1986, it had little or no presence beyond Lexington and suburban Cincinnati. To remedy this problem, Banc One acquired Louisville-based Liberty National Bancorp with its 104 banking offices located throughout Kentucky and Southern Indiana in 1994 for $842 million in stock. At the time of the acquisition, Liberty National Bancorp was the largest bank holding company in Kentucky that was still headquartered in that state. Liberty National Bancorp was renamed Banc One Kentucky and its lead bank, Liberty National Bank and Trust Company of Kentucky, became Bank One Kentucky. As a result of the merger, Bank One Lexington was placed under the supervision of the new Banc One Kentucky holding company.

====Expansion into the western states====
In the 1992, Banc One announces the pending acquisitions of two western-based holding bank holding companies, Denver-based Affiliated Bankshares of Colorado and Phoenix-based Valley National Corporation, that would give the company access to new markets in Colorado, Arizona, Utah, and California.

Banc One paid $378 million in stock to stockholders of Affiliated Bankshares for 27 affiliate banks with 38 offices in Colorado and $1.2 billion in stock to stockholders of Valley National for 206 offices in Arizona operating under the name &quot;Valley National Bank of Arizona&quot; (renamed Bank One Arizona), 35 offices in Utah operating under the name &quot;Valley Bank and Trust of Utah&quot; (renamed Bank One Utah), and 7 offices in California operating under the name &quot;California Valley Bank&quot; (renamed Bank One Fresno). Affiliated Bankshares was renamed Banc One Colorado and Valley National Corp. was renamed Banc One Arizona.

Since all of the new offices in California were located in remote Fresno and far away from the large metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and San Francisco, Banc One had little opportunity to make a significant move into California and was not able to compete efficiently against California-based banks such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo. After two years of ownership, Banc One decided to withdraw from California market completely by selling Bank One Fresno to ValliCorp Holdings, the holding company for Valliwide Bank, formerly the Bank of Fresno.

In May 1994, Banc One increased their holdings in Arizona by acquiring the 58 of 60 Arizona offices of the failed San Diego–based Great American Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $49.36 million. The newly acquired offices were integrated into Bank One Arizona.

====Expansion into West Virginia====
In 1993, Banc One entered the state of West Virginia by acquiring Key Centurion Bancshares, the largest bank holding company in West Virginia with 54 offices throughout West Virginia and parts of eastern Kentucky, for $536 million in stock.

====Expansion into Oklahoma====
Banc One entered into Oklahoma by acquiring the Central Banking Group in Oklahoma City, with its eight offices all located in Oklahoma City, for $96 million in stock in 1994. Thirty months later, Banc One entered Tulsa by the acquisition of Liberty Bancorporation of Oklahoma City for $546 million in stock in 1997. Liberty had 29 offices in Oklahoma City and Tulsa at the time of the acquisition.

====Expansion into Louisiana====
Banc One entered Louisiana by acquiring the assets of Premier Bancorp of Baton Rouge, the third-largest bank holding company in the state with 150 offices, for $700 million in stock in 1996. Although the merger was consummated in January 1996, the relationship between the two organizations goes back much further. The just recently retired and former head of Premier, and its predecessor Louisiana National Bank, was Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; McCoy, the younger brother of John G. McCoy and uncle to John B. McCoy. In 1991, Premier received $65 million from Banc One to help cover its debts in an exchange for the right for Banc One to acquire Premier within the next five years. Premier acquired most of its debts during the economic downturn that had hit Louisiana during the late 1980s. Premier Bancorp became Banc One Louisiana and Premier Bank became Bank One Louisiana.

The following year, Banc One acquired First Commerce Corporation of New Orleans for $3.5 billion in stock. At the time of the acquisition in 1998, First Commerce was the largest Louisiana-based financial institution in the state. The acquisition included the lead bank First National Bank of Commerce plus five other regional banks with a combined total of 144 banking offices. All of the acquired banks were consolidated into Bank One Louisiana.

===Acquisition of First USA===
In 1997, Banc One decided to expand its national credit card business by acquiring the Dallas-based First USA for $7.9 billion in stock. Prior to this acquisition, most Bank One credit card accounts were issued and serviced by the various local Bank One banks. For example, most Bank One Indianapolis customers had credit cards that were issued and serviced by Bank One Indianapolis via the former American Fletcher credit card center prior to the acquisition.

Unfortunately for Banc One and especially for John B. McCoy, First USA would later cause problems for its new parent by generating unexpected losses that were caused by mismanagement and by questionable decisions that were made in the attempt to increase profitability.

====History of First USA before Banc One====
First USA original was originally formed in Dallas as a subsidiary of MCorp that was called MNet. It was formed in 1985 to handle the back end work for providing credit cards, electronic banking, and other consumer services through member banks of the Texas bank holding company. To issue credit cards, MCorp (via MNet) established a credit card issuing bank in Wilmington, Delaware, called MBank USA. Although, the MNet division was generating a profit, the rest of MCorp began suffering huge loses when customers began to default on their mortgage payments that were the result of the economic downturn that had begun in Texas. In attempt to save itself, MCorp sold MNet to Lomas &amp; Nettleton Financial Corporation the following year for $300 million in cash and securities.

After the acquisition by Lomas, MNet was renamed Lomas Bankers Corp. and MBank USA was renamed Lomas Bank USA. Under Lomas, the credit card company aggressively acquired new customers by purchasing credit card accounts from other credit card issuers. In 1987, Lomas Bank USA acquired 230,000 accounts from two banks in Louisiana, 23,000 accounts from a bank in Amarillo, 260,000 accounts from two banks in Oklahoma, and 90,000 accounts from a bank in San Antonio. In 1988, Lomas acquired 80,000 accounts from a bank in New York. In 1989, Lomas &amp; Nettleton Financial was in financial trouble and was forced to sell its credit card division. Lomas sold Lomas Bankers Corp. and Lomas Bank USA to an investor group led by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners for $500 million in cash and preferred stock.

After the sale to the consortium led by Merrill Lynch, Lomas Bankers Corp. was renamed First USA, Inc. and Lomas Bank USA was renamed First USA Bank. At the time of the Merrill Lynch acquisition in 1989, Lomas Bankers–First USA was the 11th-largest issuer of credit cards in the nation.

In 1992, First USA reduced some of its debt by going public. First attempt to sell stock occurred in late January, but the offer was quickly withdrawn because the stock market had dropped too low. A more successful attempt was made four months later in which $43 million was raised in the stock sale. At the time of the IPO in 1992, First USA was the 14th-largest issuer of credit cards in the nation.

Most of the growth of the company during the 1980s and early 1990s were the results from the acquisition of credit cards accounts from banks needing to sell some assets for quick cash to stave off insolvency, or from banks that had ceased issuing and servicing their own credit cards accounts because they either could not compete with the larger credit card issuers such as First USA. As more bank credit card accounts became concentrated in a few large issuers during the 1990s, fewer banks had credit card accounts to sell, so large issuers switched to direct marketing to obtain more cardholders. Those issuers started offering no annual fee cards with introductory interest rates that quickly increased after a set time. This led to fierce competition among the remaining credit card issuers, especially in the fight to attract lucrative customers: those who maintain large monthly revolving balances. These are the same customers who could cause problems for the bank if the local economy turns sour.
At this time, First USA was generating profits as high as nearly 25% on its owners&#x27; investment, which was phenomenal since a return of 1% on its assets is usually considered great for most other sectors of banking. The high rate of return was one of the factors that attracted Banc One to the acquisition of First USA.

====History of First USA after the acquisition by Banc One====
Banc One first announced the proposed acquisition of First USA in January 1997. Wall Street reaction to news caused Banc One&#x27;s stock to drop 8%. First USA was the fourth-biggest credit card issuer in the nation at the time of the announcement. The acquisition was finalized six months later. First USA Chairman and co-founder (in 1985) John Tolleson was appointed a Banc One director while First USA president and co-founder Richard Vague was appointed chairman and CEO of First USA.

===History of Bank One Corporation===
In 1998, Banc One Corporation merged with Chicago-based First Chicago NBD – the result of the 1995 merger of First Chicago Corp. and NBD Bancorp, two large banking companies who had themselves been created through the merger of many banks) – to form Bank One Corporation, and moved its headquarters from Columbus to Chicago. Adverse financial results led to the departure of CEO John B. McCoy, whose father and grandfather had headed Banc One and predecessors. Jamie Dimon, a former key executive of Citigroup, was brought in to head the company.

In 1998, Bank One paid $66 million for the naming rights for 30 years to a newly constructed ballpark in Phoenix, which was built for the Major League Baseball expansion team Arizona Diamondbacks. The retractable roof stadium was called Bank One Ball Park, and was ultimately renamed Chase Field in 2005.

===Private equity===
In 2001, Dimon selected former colleague Dick Cashin, from Citicorp Venture Capital to run a new private equity effort within Bank One, One Equity Partners. Dick Cashin is the brother of Steven Cashin, founder and CEO of Pan African Capital Group, based in Washington, D.C.

In 2005, Bank One&#x27;s private equity affiliate, One Equity Partners, was selected to be the exclusive private equity affiliate for the combined firm, prompting the spinout of JPMorgan&#x27;s private equity affiliate, which is today CCMP Capital.

<doc id="418242" wikidata="Q933094" url="?curid=418242" title="North Marston">
<text>North Marston is a village and also a civil parish in the Buckinghamshire district in the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire, England. It is located about three miles south of Winslow, and four miles north of Waddesdon.

The village name &#x27;Marston&#x27; is a common one in England, and is Anglo-Saxon for &#x27;farm by a marsh&#x27;. This refers to the common state of the land in the Aylesbury Vale, where the water table is quite high. The prefix &#x27;North&#x27; was added later to distinguish the village from nearby Fleet Marston. The population of the village is approximately 700 and there are about 280 houses.

The facilities in North Marston include:
*a village hall, which was built as a war memorial after the First World War
*a pub called The Pilgrim (formerly, The Bell) that reopened on 1 May 2010 
*a recreation ground and sports field (that is shared with Granborough)

A recent project within the village has re-created the sports field, which is now called the North Marston and Granborough Community Sports Field. In the field there is a pavilion, football pitch, running track, nature trail and cricket nets. There is a cricket team (North Marston &amp; Granborough Cricket Club).

A community shop in the village is now established. Construction work started on The Shop North Marston on 11 November 2010 and opened in June 2011.

The village borders with Oving, Pitchcott, Quainton, Hogshaw, Granborough, Swanbourne and Hoggeston.

==St Mary&#x27;s Church==

The parish church is dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary; the foundation stones of the church on this site were laid around the 12th century. Pilgrim money enabled the nave roof to be raised and clerestory windows put in. The inner part of the tower dates back to the 15th century: from 2002 to 2004 all of the outer stones were replaced due to crumbling. There are six bells in the tower – tuned to the key of F – and a tenor weight of 13-2-27 from 1925 (with original inscriptions dating from as far back as the 16th century). There is a plan to build a meeting room, with kitchen and toilet facilities on the north side of the church, to replace those facilities of the Methodist chapel, which it is planned to sell. Since 2004, when the Methodist Chapel closed, the Parish Church has been in a Local Ecumenical Partnership with the Methodists.

==Holy Well or Schorne Well==
There is a holy well in the village, found by Sir John Schorne, who was rector of the parish of North Marston in about 1290. He was referred to as a saint who, it is claimed, performed many miracles. It was he that blessed the village well and after his death it became a resort of great pilgrimage. Pilgrims probably stayed at one or two of the houses in Church Street that still stand today, but most of the houses were destroyed in a later fire. The Holy Well was renovated in 2004/2005, after many other designs had been put in place. On the day of its official reopening a poem was read; this can be found here, with some &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; pictures.

==Education==
The North Marston Church of England School is a mixed Church of England primary school. It is a voluntary controlled school, which takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The school has approximately 100 pupils. It is situated across the road from the parish church.
The school has 3 &quot;houses&quot; each named for local reasons: Camden Neild (Red) Verney (Green) Schorne (Blue)

There was also &quot;The Schorne College&quot; situated in the grounds of the church directly opposite the present site of the School

The Village has a pre-school called Schorne Pre-School which has been running for around twenty years now.

==Sport==

A football club based in the village, Schorne College (Past &amp; Present) F.C., played in the FA Cup qualifying rounds in the 1880s and 1890s, notably beating beating Millwall 4–0, away from home, in 1889.

==Famous links in North Marston==
*John Schorne - Local unofficial saint, and Rector of North Marston around 1290.
*John Camden Neild - Miser to whose memory the chancel of North Marston was dedicated when Queen Victoria paid for its refurbishment; he had left her all his money.

<text>Northall is a hamlet in the parish of Edlesborough, in Buckinghamshire, England.

This large hamlet straddles the A4146 road halfway between Edlesborough and Billington, Bedfordshire. It has one large Baptist chapel which is still in use. The hamlet has one public house &#x27;The Swan&#x27;. An old 16th century public house &#x27;the Village Green&#x27; was converted to a private house.

The village was formerly part of the Ashridge Estate of the Earls and Dukes of Bridgwater. Like nearby Slapton it has a few very high gabled cottages, with thickly latticed window panes.

<text>Moses Alexander (November 13, 1853 – January 4, 1932) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 11th governor of Idaho, the second elected Jewish governor of a U.S. state, and the first who actually practiced that religion. Jewish California Governor Washington Bartlett, was elected in 1887, but had converted to Christianity. Moses Alexander served from 1915 until 1919, and remains the state&#x27;s sole Jewish chief executive.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Obrigheim, then in the Kingdom of Bavaria. Alexander emigrated to the United States in 1867 and settled in New York City.

== Career ==
After moving to the United States, Alexander accepted an invitation from his cousin in Chillicothe, Missouri, where he showed a talent for the business and was made a partner in the store in 1874.

In Chillicothe, Alexander showed an early interest in Democratic politics, particularly within the progressive wing of the party. In 1886, he was elected to the Chillicothe City Council. The next year, Alexander was elected mayor and served two terms. His primary concern as mayor was addressing the city&#x27;s dire financial situation.

In 1891, Alexander left Chillicothe with the intention of moving to Alaska. While en route, he made a stop in Idaho at Boise to look at its investment opportunities. Based on that, he abandoned his plans in Alaska and settled in Boise instead. In July 1891, Alexander opened the first of several clothing stores, Alexanders, in Boise and nearby communities.

In 1895, Alexander led an effort to build the Ahavath Beth Israel, the first synagogue in Idaho. Completed in 1896, it is the oldest in continuous use west of the Mississippi River.

=== Mayor of Boise ===

In 1897, Alexander was elected mayor of Boise. He chose not to run for reelection in 1899, but was elected again in 1901. During his terms as mayor, Boise&#x27;s volunteer fire department was reorganized into a professional body, anti-gambling ordinances were passed and other city improvements were made.

=== Governor of Idaho ===

==== Election ====
In 1908, Alexander was declared the Democratic nominee for governor in a bitterly contested nomination process which required intervention by the Idaho Supreme Court. However, he was defeated in the general election by Republican nominee James H. Brady. Alexander was offered the nomination again in 1910, but declined due to poor health.

In 1914, Alexander entered the gubernatorial race on a platform strongly supporting prohibition and limited government spending. Alexander won the general election with a 44% plurality against Republican incumbent John M. Haines, thanks, in part, to a misappropriation scandal in the state treasurer&#x27;s office that dogged the Republican ticket. He thus became the first observant Jew to be elected governor of a U.S. state. (Washington Bartlett, governor of California in 1887, had a Jewish mother but did not practice Judaism himself .)

In 1916, Alexander was re-elected over his Republican opponent, D. W. Davis, by only 572 votes, the closest gubernatorial election in Idaho history.

==== Tenure ====
Upon taking office, Alexander set to work immediately on making Idaho a dry state. Alexander continued to be an ardent prohibition supporter even though bootlegging became common practice in Idaho in the ensuing years.

World War I was another central issue during Alexander&#x27;s administration. Alexander pledged state militia troops to both the war cause and to the Mexican Expedition against Pancho Villa and ordered a home guard (Idaho State Guard) into service to protect Idaho. Despite rampant anti-German hysteria in Idaho during the period, Alexander himself was never thought of as unpatriotic, even though he was born in present-day Germany.

Several labor laws were also introduced during Alexander&#x27;s time as governor.

=== Later years ===
Alexander did not run for re-election in 1918. He was the Democratic nominee for governor again in 1922, but was not able to campaign as vigorously as he had before. That year, Alexander finished third in the general election behind Republican Charles C. Moore and Progressive H. F. Samuels.

Throughout the 1920s, Alexander remained active with the Idaho Democratic Party as a speaker and delegate to Democratic National Conventions.

== Personal life ==
In 1876, Alexander married Helena (née Hedwig) Kaestner (1853–1949), a Christian immigrant from Germany who converted to Judaism. Together, they had a daughter, Leha Alexander Spiro (1885–1979).

He made his last public appearance for the Democrats on December 29, 1931, less than a week before his death in Boise. Alexander and his wife are buried in Morris Hill Cemetery in Boise.

<doc id="418249" wikidata="Q328527" url="?curid=418249" title="John Evans (Idaho politician)">
<text>John Victor Evans Sr. (January 18, 1925 – July 8, 2014) was an American politician from Idaho. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the state&#x27;s 27th governor and was in office for 10 years, from 1977 to 1987.

==Biography==
Born in Malad, Idaho, Evans was an infantryman in the U.S. Army during World War II. Following the war, he attended Stanford University and graduated in 1951. He and his wife, Lola Daniels Evans (1927–2015), were married for over 69 years and had five children: three sons and two daughters.

==Career==
Evans returned to Malad after college to help run the family wheat and cattle ranch. He was elected to the state senate at age 27 in 1952 and re-elected in 1954 and 1956, serving as majority leader in his final term. In 1960, Evans became mayor of Malad City and served in that capacity until 1966. He returned to the state senate in 1969 and served as minority leader from 1969 to 1975.

Evans was elected lieutenant governor in 1974, and became governor in January 1977 when Cecil Andrus accepted an appointment to become the Secretary of the Interior in the new Carter administration.

Evans finished Andrus&#x27; term and was elected governor in his own right in 1978, defeating Republican house speaker Allan Larsen of Blackfoot. , Evans remains the only Mormon to have won election as governor in Idaho. Arnold Williams was the Mormon first to serve as governor (succeeding to the office following the resignation of Charles Gossett), holding office for slightly over a year starting in late 1945, but lost the 1946 election.

Evans was re-elected in 1982, narrowly defeating Republican lieutenant governor Phil Batt of Wilder in a contest so close on election night that at least one Idaho television network incorrectly declared Batt the winner.

After nearly a decade as a governor, Evans unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1986, but was defeated by Republican incumbent Steve Symms of Caldwell. He was succeeded as governor by Andrus, who served two more terms, giving the Democrats six consecutive elections for governor in the state, holding the office from 1971 to 1995.

While he was in office as governor in 1981, Evans&#x27;s 29-year-old son John was the target of a foiled kidnapping attempt in Burley.

===Elections===


==Later life and death==
Evans became president of the family-owned D. L. Evans Bank in Burley in January 1987, which was founded in 1904 in Albion by his grandfather, David Lloyd Evans Sr. (1854–1929). Evans died at age 89 in 2014 at his Boise home on July 8. Less than a year later, Evans&#x27; widow, Lola, died at her Boise home on May 19, 2015, at the age of 88. They are interred at the Malad City Cemetery in Malad City.

<doc id="418250" wikidata="Q7292765" url="?curid=418250" title="Ranger Creed">
<text>The Ranger Creed is the official creed of the United States Army Rangers. The Ranger Creed was written in 1974 by CSM Neal R. Gentry, the original command sergeant major of the reactivated 1st Ranger Battalion. It was initiated by the Battalion Commander, then-LTC Kenneth C. Leuer, and re-drafted by the battalion XO, MAJ &quot;Rock&quot; Hudson and finalized at Fort Stewart, Georgia in 1974 when the original cadre deployed there on 1 July 1974. Today, members of Ranger community recite the Ranger Creed during formations, ceremonies, physical training activities and upon graduations from the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program (RASP) and the U.S. Army Ranger Course.

== Ranger Handbook version ==
==Variations==
The very first draft by CSM Neal R. Gentry used the phrasing &quot;of the Ranger Battalion.&quot; Eventually, after some revisions on the overall creed, they settled on &quot;of my Ranger Battalion.&quot; The Ranger School cadre later adopted the phrasing &quot;of the Rangers&quot; as seen in the Ranger Creed above. After the formation of the 75th Ranger Regiment, members of all battalions adopted the wording, &quot;of my Ranger Regiment&quot;, and this version remains in use throughout the regiment.

<text>One-Eyed Jacks is a 1961 American Western film directed by and starring Marlon Brando, his only directorial credit. Brando portrays the lead character Rio, and Karl Malden plays his partner, &quot;Dad&quot; Longworth. The supporting cast features Pina Pellicer, Katy Jurado, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

==Plot==

Rio, his mentor Dad Longworth, and a third man called Doc rob a bank of two saddlebags of gold in Sonora, Mexico, in 1880. Mexican &quot;rurales&quot; (mounted police) catch them celebrating in a cantina and kill Doc. Dad and Rio escape, but Dad leaves Rio to be taken by the &quot;rurales&quot;. Rio is arrested and spends five hard years in a Sonora prison. He escapes and travels to Monterey, California, where Dad has become sheriff. Rio plans to kill Dad and rob the bank in Monterey with his new partners Chico Modesto, Harvey Johnson and Bob Emory.

Plans are sidetracked when Rio falls in love with Dad&#x27;s beautiful stepdaughter, Louisa. Rio takes advantage of a &quot;fiesta&quot; (festival) to spend the night with her on the beach. Dad tries to punish Louisa for what happened, but backs down after intervention by his wife, Maria. Instead, he traps Rio, whips him in public, and smashes his gun hand to make sure Rio will never be able to beat him in a gunfight. While recovering from his wounds, Rio struggles with his conflicting desires to love the girl and to get revenge on her stepfather. He decides to forgo vengeance, fetch Louisa, and leave town.

Emory and Johnson kill Chico and pull off the bank job without Rio&#x27;s knowledge. The heist goes wrong and a young girl is killed. Dad accuses Rio of the crime. Dad has one last private talk with Rio, again attempting to absolve himself for all he has done. Rio replies, &quot;You&#x27;re a one-eyed jack around here, Dad, but I&#x27;ve seen the other side of your face&quot;. Rio tells him he had been imprisoned for the last five years, but Dad calls it a lie.
Louisa visits Rio in jail to tell him she is going to have his baby. He is then beaten by sadistic deputy Lon Dedrick, who desired and has been denied Louisa&#x27;s affection. Maria confronts Dad and insists on being told the truth about the relationship between him and Rio, stating she knew something was wrong since the moment Rio arrived. She says she knows Dad wants to hang him purely out of guilt. Dad tells her she has no appreciation for everything he has done for her.

Louisa attempts to smuggle a Derringer to Rio, but she is discovered by Dedrick, who carries her out of the jail, leaving the gun on a table. While they are out, Rio is able to get hold of the pistol. Pointing the unloaded gun at Dedrick when he returns, Rio bluffs his way out of jail in a tense confrontation. Rio takes Dedrick&#x27;s revolver, beats him unconscious, and locks him in a cell. As Rio is making his escape, he is spotted by Dad, riding into town. Under fire, in the final showdown Rio shoots Dad dead.

Rio and Louisa ride out to the dunes and say a sentimental farewell. Now a hunted man, Rio tells Louisa that he might go to Oregon, but will return for her in the spring.

==Cast==
==Adaptation and development==

Rod Serling, creator of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; television series, wrote an adaptation of the 1956 novel &quot;The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones&quot; by Charles Neider, at the request of producer Frank P. Rosenberg. The book was a fictional treatment of the familiar Billy the Kid story, relocated from New Mexico to the Monterey Peninsula in California. The adaptation was rejected.

Rosenberg next hired Sam Peckinpah, who finished his first script on 11 November 1957. Marlon Brando&#x27;s Pennebaker Productions had paid $40,000 for the rights to &quot;Authentic Death&quot; and then signed a contract with Stanley Kubrick to direct for Paramount Pictures. Kubrick stepped down from directing the film in November 1958 just two weeks before starting production, reportedly to get &quot;Lolita&quot; into production. Malden was offered the directorial role but declined and Brando volunteered to direct instead. Peckinpah handed in a revised screenplay on 6 May 1959. Brando later fired Peckinpah and hired Calder Willingham to further revise the film&#x27;s script, but he too was eventually fired. Guy Trosper was brought on as a final replacement.

The movie ultimately bore little resemblance to the Neider novel. At various times, the two credited screenwriters and the uncredited Peckinpah have claimed (or had claimed for them) a majority of the responsibility for the film. When Karl Malden was asked who really wrote the story, he said: &quot;There is one answer to your question—Marlon Brando, a genius in our time.&quot;

==Production==

Spencer Tracy was Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s preference for the role of Dad Longworth, but Marlon Brando had already given the role to his friend Karl Malden, who was on the payroll of his personal production company, Pennebaker Inc. The movie went vastly over its $2 million budget, which was blamed on Brando&#x27;s perfectionism as a director. Scheduled for a three-month shoot, principal photography on &quot;One Eyed Jacks&quot; took six months at a cost $6 million, while Brando shot 1 million feet (304,800 meters) of film. Shooting began in 1958, but the film was not released until 1961.

Brando had shot and printed a total of five hours of additional footage, which made the editing process long and laborious; some of the unused footage was later destroyed. Later, other directors worked on the rest of the film after Brando walked away from the production. He did not direct another film in his later years, but he did continue to act. In a 1975 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Brando said of directing, &quot;You work yourself to death. You&#x27;re the first one up in the morning... I mean, we shot that thing on the run, you know, you make up the dialogue the scene before, improvising, and your brain is going crazy&quot;.

The film was Paramount Pictures&#x27; last feature released in VistaVision. Cinematographer Charles Lang received an Academy Award nomination in the Best Cinematography, Color category that year. Upon release, it made little money, leading to a string of unsuccessful films for Brando. It was filmed at Pebble Beach and Pfeiffer Beach.

==Release==
The film was released on March 30, 1961, in New York City. The film was selected for screening as part of the Cannes Classics section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. The Cannes screening was that of a 4K restoration supervised by Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and The Film Foundation.

==Critical reception==
&quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 61% approval rating based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, favorably influenced by Brando&#x27;s efforts, noted: &quot;Directed and played with the kind of vicious style that Mr. Brando has put into so many of his skulking, scabrous roles. Realism is redolent in them, as it is in many details of the film. But, at the same time, it is curiously surrounded by elements of creamed-cliché romance and a kind of pictorial extravagance that you usually see in South Sea island films.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot;, on the other hand, wrote: &quot;It is an oddity of this film that both its strength and its weakness lie in the area of characterization. Brando&#x27;s concept calls, above all, for depth of character, for human figures endowed with overlapping good and bad sides to their nature.&quot; Dave Kehr of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; wrote: &quot;There is a strong Freudian pull to the situation (the partner&#x27;s name is &quot;Dad&quot;) that is more ritualized than dramatized: the most memorable scenes have a fierce masochistic intensity, as if Brando were taking the opportunity to punish himself for some unknown crime.&quot;

==In popular culture==

One-Eyed Jacks is the name of a brothel in the TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; created by David Lynch and Mark Frost. The film is mentioned in dialogue between characters Donna Hayward and Audrey Horne. Horne asks Hayward if she has heard of &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; and Hayward responds, &quot;Isn&#x27;t that that Western with Marlon Brando?&quot;.

A short loop from the film plays on a cinema screen during a story mission in &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;.

==Home media and restoration==
The film fell into the public domain and for years was only available via numerous low-quality budget reissues on VHS and DVD, along with the occasional official release by Paramount Home Video. In 2016, work was completed on a &quot;New 4K digital restoration, undertaken by Universal Pictures in partnership with The Film Foundation and in consultation with filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg&quot;. This restoration was issued on Blu-ray and DVD in November 2016 by the Criterion Collection in the US, and in June 2017 by Arrow Video in the UK.

<text>Limekiln State Park is a California state park on the Big Sur coast. It contains four lime kilns from an 1887–1890 lime-calcining operation, plus a beach, redwood forest, and Limekiln Falls. It is located south of Lucia on Big Sur Coast Highway. The park was established in 1994.

==Cultural history==

From 1887 to 1890 the Rockland Lime and Lumber Company harvested limestone from a scree slope and fed it into four iron and stone lime kilns they erected onsite. Long exposure to very hot fires extracted lime. Barrels of lime were slid on a cable out to Rockland Cove, where they were loaded onto ships at a dog-hole port at the mouth of Limekiln Creek. The lime was a key ingredient in the cement that was used for construction in San Francisco and Monterey. However, after three years the company had exhausted most of the limestone as well as the redwood used to fire the kilns. A trail leads from the Big Sur Coast Highway to the ruins of the lime smelting operations, which include four kilns and some stone walls and bridge abutments.

The redwood forest recovered from this industrial use, but in 1984 a private landowner planned to log the west fork of Limekiln Creek. Conservationists objected and succeeded in getting the land preserved as a public park. The campground was family-owned before it was then sold and operated by the Esalen Institute for a number of years. The property was transferred to the California state park system and opened in September 1995.

Limekiln State Park was heavily damaged in the Chalk Fire of September and October 2008. In total the Chalk Fire burned in California. Due to the damage the park was closed, not reopening until July 2, 2010. At that time the Limekiln Falls Trail remained closed, but reopened in summer 2011. The Hare Creek Trail is shorter due to damage related to the Chalk Fire.

==History==
Limekiln State Park was one of many state parks threatened with closure in 2008. Those closures were ultimately avoided by cutting hours and maintenance system-wide. The park was again threatened with closure, along with 70 other California state parks in July 2012 as part of a deficit reduction program. A partner organization has signed an agreement to keep the park open.

==Recreation==
Limekiln State Park has a small but popular campground with 31 sites among the redwoods and 11 sites with an ocean view. Easy trails lead to the lime kilns or up Hare Creek Canyon. Another leads to Limekiln Falls on the east fork of Limekiln Creek.

<doc id="418254" wikidata="Q372022" url="?curid=418254" title="Cecil Andrus">
<text>Cecil Dale Andrus (August 25, 1931 – August 24, 2017) was an American politician who served as 26th and 28th governor of Idaho, for a total of fourteen years. A Democrat, he also served as U.S. Secretary of the Interior from 1977 to 1981 during the Carter Administration. Andrus lost his first gubernatorial election in 1966 but won four (in 1970, 1974, 1986, and 1990) and his fourteen years as governor is the most in state history. 

In public life, Andrus was noted for his strong conservationist and environmental views and accomplishments, and an Idaho wildlife preserve established in 1993 in Washington County is named the Cecil D. Andrus Wildlife Management Area in his honor. In 2018, the Cecil D. Andrus–White Clouds Wilderness was renamed after him. A political liberal, he protected the environment by minimizing the control of business interests held over the public domain and by concentrating decision-making in the hands of experts in the Interior Department. He argued that environmentalism can and must coexist with positive economic development.

==Early life==
Born in Hood River, Oregon on August 25, 1931, Andrus was the middle of three children of Hal Stephen and Dorothy May (Johnson) Andrus, with older brother Steve and younger sister Margaret. They later lived near Junction City, on a farm without electricity. During World War II, the family moved to Eugene in early 1942, when &quot;Cece&quot; was 11, where Hal (1906–2004) and his brother Bud opened a machine shop to refurbish sawmill equipment. Andrus graduated from Eugene High School in 1948 at age 16 and attended Oregon State College in Corvallis, where he majored in engineering in his freshman year.

At age 17, he got a good summer job with the local utility in 1949, and late in August, he eloped to Reno with Carol Mae May (born December 26, 1932), his high school sweetheart. Andrus had just turned 18, and she was 16 months younger. The Andruses enjoyed a happy, affectionate marriage, and he always referred to her as &quot;his first wife&quot; or &quot;his bride&quot;. He decided to keep working and not return to college. Following the outbreak of the Korean War, he enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserves in February 1951, and served as an electronics technician aboard patrol aircraft until 1955.

After his discharge from the Navy, Andrus moved to Orofino in northern Idaho, where he worked in the timber industry in a variety of jobs at a sawmill his father co-owned. After the sawmill closed, Andrus switched to the insurance industry in 1963, and moved his family down the Clearwater River to Lewiston in 1966.

==Political career==
===State Senate===
In 1960, at age 28, and concerned over the local Republican state senator&#x27;s stance against needed education improvements in Idaho schools, particularly in rural areas of the state, Andrus filed as a Democrat to run against him and won, and was re-elected in 1962 and 1964 from Orofino (and Clearwater County).

===Gubernatorial candidate===
Andrus first ran for governor in 1966 but was narrowly defeated in the Democratic primary by Charles Herndon, an attorney from Salmon.

Seven weeks before the November election, Herndon and two others died in a twin-engine private plane crash in the mountains northwest of Stanley, while en route from Twin Falls to Coeur d&#x27;Alene in mid-September. Andrus was appointed the nominee to take Herndon&#x27;s place on the ballot. He lost the general election to Republican Don Samuelson of Sandpoint by more than 11,000 votes, earning Andrus the unlikely distinction of losing both the primary and general election races for the same office in the same year. He returned to the state senate two years later, easily unseating the Republican incumbent in the and represented Herndon&#x27;s widow, Lucille, was elected to several local political offices after 

===Governor of Idaho (1971–1977)===
Undaunted by his earlier setback, Andrus defeated Samuelson by over 10,000 votes in a gubernatorial election rematch in 1970. This was attributed in large part to Andrus&#x27;s public opposition to proposals for development of molybdenum mining in central Idaho&#x27;s White Cloud Mountains, which Samuelson supported.

During his first term as governor, Andrus played a key role in winning support by the U.S. Congress for federal designation of the Sawtooth Wilderness Area in the State of Idaho. Andrus was easily re-elected in 1974 with over 70% of the vote, defeating Republican Lieutenant Governor Jack M. Murphy of Shoshone by a record margin.

In 1974, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Governor Andrus one of the &quot;200 Faces for the Future&quot;.

===Secretary of the Interior (1977–1981)===
In January 1977, Andrus left his post as governor to serve as Secretary of the Interior for newly inaugurated President Jimmy Carter, whom he had known since both were freshman governors in 1971. Andrus became the first Idahoan to serve in a presidential cabinet. He was succeeded in Idaho by Lieutenant Governor John V. Evans, a Democrat who served nearly a decade, winning elections in 1978 and 1982.

Andrus also took a leadership role in securing Congressional passage of the Redwood National Park Expansion Act in 1978. which added to Redwood National Park in California, in a major expansion to preserve remnants of the giant redwood forests there.

In 1979, when President Carter asked for the resignations of his entire Cabinet during an administration retreat at Camp David, the resignation of Andrus was not accepted. Andrus stayed on as Secretary of the Interior for the remainder of Carter&#x27;s presidency and returned to Idaho after Carter&#x27;s term ended in January 1981.

Andrus wrote in his memoir about such a need for compromise relative to his successful, last-ditch efforts in securing passage of the Alaska Lands Act during the last month of the Carter Administration in December 1980, following Ronald Reagan&#x27;s election in November: &quot;The environmental groups were initially hostile. I actually had to listen to the idiotic argument (from the Wilderness Society and Sierra Club&#x27;s paid Washington lobbyists) that they could get a better Alaska package out of Reagan and Watt.&quot;

&quot;Cooler heads quickly prevailed&quot;, Andrus continues, &quot;It proved the old adage that there&#x27;s nothing like a hanging in the morning to focus the mind. Even though we were creating tomorrow&#x27;s controversies, a 103-million acre [preservation] plan ... was a lot better than nothing.&quot;

===Governor of Idaho again (1987–1995)===
After several years in private life following his return to Idaho in 1981, Andrus surprised many by seeking and recapturing the Idaho governorship in 1986, when he defeated Republican Lieutenant Governor David Leroy in a close open seat election. The incumbent since succeeding Andrus in 1977, Evans had chosen to run for the U.S. Senate, but lost.

During this second stint as governor, Andrus vigorously opposed federal efforts to store nuclear waste in Idaho. He also brokered a path-breaking agreement among land use and conservation interests to control water pollution from nonpoint sources to protect riparian and fish habitat in Idaho&#x27;s rivers and streams.

In September 1989, Andrus closed off the Idaho border to nuclear waste shipments from the federal government&#x27;s Rocky Flats site near Denver. He initially agreed to open a temporary dump near Idaho Falls to store waste until the federal government agreed to open a site near Carlsbad, New Mexico. When the federal government failed to open the Carlsbad site, Andrus refused to accept shipments of plutonium from Rocky Flats. Secretary of Energy James D. Watkins did not challenge Andrus&#x27;s authority to close the border.

In 1990, Andrus drew attention when he vetoed a bill, passed by the legislature, which &quot;would have made abortion illegal except in cases of non-statutory rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim was under 18, severe fetal deformity or where the pregnancy posed a threat to the mother&#x27;s life.&quot; Andrus was easily re-elected later that year against conservative Republican state senator Roger Fairchild of Fruitland, and won every county except Lemhi and Jefferson.

In his fourth and final term as governor, Andrus was again in the national spotlight due to the Endangered Species Act listing of several Snake River salmon species. These anadromous fish species spawn in their natal streams in Idaho and migrate seaward at a young age. Governor Andrus called attention to the downstream federal dams operated by the Army Corps of Engineers as the major culprit. His successful lawsuit against the federal government led to incremental changes in operations of the dams, and to continuing efforts for major conservationist modifications to the dams that are ongoing today.

On April 3, 1990, he signed &quot;House Bill 817&quot; into law, creating two new types of felony crimes, defined new criminal investigation areas, provided the basis for opening ritual child abuse cases based upon probable cause, and provided a framework for extensive ritual child abuse investigation training throughout Idaho.

Despite remaining personally popular, Andrus did not seek a fifth term in 1994. At his death in 2017, he was the eleventh longest-serving governor in Andrus was succeeded by Phil Batt of Wilder, the first Republican to win a gubernatorial election in Idaho since 1966; he served a single term and did not seek a second in 1998. Andrus&#x27;s re-election in 1990 was the sixth straight gubernatorial win by Democrats in Idaho (Evans in 1978, 1982), but is the most recent; Republicans have since won eight consecutive, through 2022.

===Election results===
==Elder statesman==

A wildlife preservation area in Idaho established in 1993, from Cambridge in Washington County, is named the Cecil D. Andrus Wildlife Management Area in his honor.

In 1995, Andrus founded the Andrus Center for Public Policy at Boise State University, and in 1998, published his memoir, &quot;Politics Western Style&quot;.

An elementary school opened in 1997 in west Boise by the West Ada School District was named the Cecil D. Andrus Elementary School in his honor.

Andrus remained active in the Idaho Democratic Party in the early 21st Century and continued to campaign on behalf of other Democrats. In 2006, Andrus served as campaign treasurer for Idaho Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jerry Brady. In February 2008, Andrus endorsed and campaigned actively on behalf of Illinois Senator Barack Obama in Boise.

At what was described as the &quot;second biggest political rally in Idaho history&quot;, by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Andrus introduced Obama and recalled hearing John F. Kennedy speak years earlier: &quot;I&#x27;m older now, some would suggest in the twilight of a mediocre political career&quot;, Andrus said, &quot;[but] I, like you, can still be inspired. I can still hope.&quot;

In the closing page of his memoir, Andrus quotes the poet Robert Frost: &quot;We should not have to care so much, you and I.&quot; &quot;But we do care&quot;, Andrus continues, &quot;and we should. We care about the future ... I remain hopeful that I will be able to pass on to my grandchildren all the pleasures of life in an unspoiled West. Perhaps hope should be replaced by a stronger word. It is a matter of obligation.&quot;

A 2011 book on Andrus and his career in public service described him as &quot;Idaho&#x27;s greatest governor&quot;.

==Death==
Andrus died on August 24, 2017, in Boise, just one day before his 86th birthday, of complications from lung cancer.

<doc id="418255" wikidata="Q27075910" url="?curid=418255" title="Northern parula">
<text>The northern parula (Setophaga americana) is a small New World warbler. It is migratory and breeds in eastern North America from southern Canada to Florida.

==Taxonomy==
The northern parula was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the tits in the genus &quot;Parus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Parus americanus&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on &quot;The Finch-Creeper&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1731 by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as northern America, but in 1931 this was restricted to South Carolina by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union. The northern parula was moved from the genus &quot;Parus&quot; to the genus &quot;Setophaga&quot; based on a molecular phylogenetic study of the Parulidae that was published in 2010. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. Northern parulas will occasionally hybridize with yellow-throated warblers, resulting in a hybrid species known as Sutton&#x27;s warblers.

The genus name &quot;Setophaga&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;ses&quot;, &quot;moth&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, &quot;eating&quot;, and the specific &quot;americana&quot; is Latin for &quot;American&quot;. The common name &quot;Parula&quot; ultimately derives from Latin &quot;parrula&quot;, Tit (bird).

==Description==
The northern parula is one of the smaller North American migratory warblers, often being one of the smallest birds in a mixed feeding flock besides kinglets or gnatcatchers. Length is , wingspan is and body mass is . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . This species has mainly blue-gray upper parts, with a greenish back patch and two white wing bars. The breast is yellowish shading into the white belly. The summer male has bluish and rufous breast bands and prominent white eye crescents. At the end of the breeding season, individuals molt into a duller version of the breeding plumage. Females are similar-looking but tend to be duller and lack the breast bands. The unique breastband fades in males and may disappear altogether in females.

Its song is a click-like trill or buzz, &quot;zeeeeee-yip&quot; and the call is a soft &quot;chip&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is migratory, wintering in southern Florida, northern Central America, the West Indies and most of the Lesser Antilles. This species is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

While the species is still common as a breeder across most of eastern North America, there are conspicuous gaps in their breeding range that were likely once breeding grounds. They have been extirpated as a breeder from much of the Midwest as well as from many areas in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. Explanations for the disappearance may be changes in habitat or increasing air pollution, which limited the growth of epiphytes on trees that the warbler depended on for nesting. A further explanation is the clear-cutting and bog draining that have significantly reduced the amount of suitable habitat in eastern North America.

The northern parula inhabits various habitats depending on season and location. This is primarily a forest-dwelling species, but the northern and southern breeding populations select different habitats. In general, abundance of this species has been found to be positively correlated with increased tree species diversity, canopy height, and percent canopy cover. Northern populations breed in mature, moist coniferous forests. This species constructs its pendulum nests in hanging vegetation and so it is often attracted to suspended clumps of moss or coniferous twigs that are more abundant in moist spruce bogs or hemlock swamps. Southern populations breed in mature, moist, bottomland forest where Spanish moss is prevalent. Outside of the breeding season, the northern parula becomes more of a habitat generalist and may be found in a wide variety of habitats during migration and winter. These habitats may include: pastures; moist, dry or wet forests; and agricultural fields or plantations.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
The northern parula is considered a monogamous species; however, a few cases of polygamy have been reported. Southern populations can start breeding as soon as March but in the north of the range, the species does not nest until May. The breeding habitat is humid woodland with growths of Old Man&#x27;s Beard lichen or Spanish moss. Northern parulas nest in trees in clumps of these fungi (Old Man&#x27;s Beard; &quot;Usnea&quot;) or plants (Spanish moss; &quot;Tillandsia usneoides&quot;), laying 3–7 eggs in a scantily lined cup nest. Sites located near water sources are preferred and many nests are found at the end of branches suspended over water. Due to their longer breeding season, southern parulas frequently raise two broods, as opposed to northern ones who raise only one. The female hollows out a clump of vegetation in the moss and proceeds to fill the cavity with vegetation fibers, animal hair, grass, or pine needles. These nests average in outside diameter. The incubation period typically lasts 12–14 days and the young fledge at 10–11 days. Breeding maturity is attained the following year.

===Food and feeding===
The northern parula forages mostly or entirely on terrestrial invertebrates. Prey items include spiders, damselflies, locusts, bugs, grasshoppers, aphids, beetles, caterpillars, flies, wasps, bees, and ants. Regardless of season, caterpillars and spiders are consumed most often. During the winter, the northern parula consumes more beetles and occasionally forages on berries, seeds, and nectar. This species primarily captures prey from vegetation by a hover-glean method, however this species is versatile in using a variety of foraging methods. It may make short flights from a perch to snatch prey in mid-flight or even hang upside-down to forage. It is most often seen foraging in the mid- to upper canopy levels of vegetation. Though most foraging activity occurs in arboreal vegetation, this species occasionally forages on or around the ground as well.

A northern parula from Augusta, Georgia was found to be a host of an intestinal acanthocephalan worm, &quot;Apororhynchus amphistomi&quot;.

<text>Araucaria bidwillii, commonly known as the bunya pine (), banya or bunya-bunya, is a large evergreen coniferous tree in the family Araucariaceae which is endemic to Australia. Its natural range is southeast Queensland with two very small, disjunct populations in northeast Queensland&#x27;s World Heritage listed Wet Tropics. There are many planted specimens on the Atherton Tableland, in New South Wales, and around the Perth metropolitan area, and it has also been widely planted in other parts of the world. They are very tall trees – the tallest living individual is in Bunya Mountains National Park and was reported by Robert Van Pelt in January 2003 to be in height.

==Description==
&quot;Araucaria bidwillii&quot; will grow to a height of with a single unbranched trunk up to diameter, which has dark brown or black flaky bark. The branches are produced in whorls at regular intervals along the trunk, with leaf-bearing branchlets crowded at their ends. The branches are held more or less horizontally – those towards the top of the trunk may be somewhat ascending, those on the lowest section of the trunk may be somewhat drooping. This arrangement gives the tree a very distinctive egg-shaped silhouette.

The leaves are small and rigid with a sharp tip which can easily penetrate the skin. They are narrowly triangular, broad at the base and sessile (without a stem). They measure up to long by wide with fine longitudinal venation, glossy green above and paler underneath. The leaf arrangement is both distichous and decussate (referred to as secondarily distichous) – that is, one pair of leaves are produced on the twig opposite each other, and the next pair above is rotated around the twig 90° to them, and so on.

The cones are terminal, the male (or pollen) cone is a spike up to long which matures around October to November. The female (or seed) cone is much larger, reaching up to long and wide, which is roughly equivalent to a rugby ball. At maturity, which occurs from December through to March, female cones are green with 50–100 pointed segments, each of which encloses a seed, and they can weigh up to 10 kg. Both seed and pollen cones are some of the largest of all conifer species.

The edible seeds measure between and long and are ovoid to long-elliptic.

===Architecture===
&quot;Araucaria bidwillii&quot;, like many species from the Araucariaceae family and the fir genus, changes its structural model over time – initially its growth follows a perfect Massart&#x27;s model and gradually changes to a Rauh model when old. Tree architecture has been studied in recent decades from a scientific point of view, in a systematic way. Botanists Hall, Oldeman and Tomlinson 
studied the growth of tropical trees and arrived at the idea of the architectural model, which can be seen as a growth strategy to occupy space.
===Phenology===
The trees&#x27; pollen cones appear in April and mature in September or October. The cones require fifteen months to mature, and the cones fall 17 to 18 months after pollination in late January to early March from the coast to the current Bunya Mountains. When there is heavy rainfall or drought, pollination may vary.

==Taxonomy==
The species was described by the English botanist William Jackson Hooker in 1843, based on material collected in the &quot;Mount Brisbane range of hills, 70 miles N.W. of Moreton Bay&quot; by John Carne Bidwill in 1842. Hooker states in his paper that Bidwill took &quot;not only branches and cones and male flowers, but also a healthy young living plant&quot; to England where Hooker set about describing the new species, and his paper (titled &quot;Figure and description of a new species of Araucaria from Moreton Bay, New Holland&quot;) was published in his own journal &quot;London Journal of Botany&quot;.

===Etymology===
The genus name &quot;Araucaria&quot; is taken from the Spanish word &quot;Araucanía&quot;, the name of the area in Chile where the first species of this genus originated, and/or &quot;Araucanos&quot;, the Spanish word for the original inhabitants of the area. Hooker coined the species epithet in honour of Bidwill, for his efforts in collecting specimens and bringing them to him.

===Vernacular names===
In various Australian Aboriginal languages this tree is known as &quot;banya&quot; (anglicized as &quot;bunya&quot;), &quot;bonye, bonyi&quot; (in Gubbi Gubbi), &quot;bunyi&quot; or &quot;bunya-bunya&quot;, leading to its common name &#x27;bunya pine&#x27;. It is also less-known as the false monkey puzzle tree (not to be confused with &quot;Araucaria araucana&quot;, the monkey puzzle tree).

==Evolution==
The bunya pine is a member of the Section &quot;Bunya&quot; of the genus &quot;Araucaria&quot;, and is the sole extant species within it. This section is thought to have been most widespread in the Mesozoic – fossils from the Jurassic period with cone morphology similar to &quot;A. bidwillii&quot; have been found in the UK (&quot;Araucaria sphaerocarpa&quot;) and South America (&quot;Araucaria mirabilis&quot;)

==Distribution==
At the start of British occupation, &quot;A. bidwillii&quot; was abundant in southern Queensland, occurring in large groves or sprinkled regularly as an emergent species throughout other forest types on the upper Stanley and Brisbane Rivers, Sunshine Coast hinterland (especially the Blackall Range and Maleny), and also towards and on the Bunya Mountains.

Two more natural, but very small and very isolated, populations of the species occur approximately to the north, in the wet tropics region of northeastern Queensland – one close to Cannabullen Falls on the Atherton Tableland, and the other in the Mount Lewis National Park.

Today, the southeast Queensland populations exist as very small groves or single trees in its former range, except on and near the Bunya Mountains, where it is still fairly prolific, while the populations in north Queensland remain stable.

The limited distribution of &quot;A. bidwillii&quot; in Australia is in part due to poor seed dispersal, and also the drying out of the Australian continent over the millennia, leading to a reduction of areas with suitable climatic zones for rainforest.

==Ecology==
A variety of birds and animals, including sulphur-crested cockatoos (&quot;Cacatua galerita&quot;), short-eared possums (&quot;Trichosurus caninus&quot;), fawn-footed melomys (&quot;Melomys cervinipes&quot;), and wallabies are known to eat the seeds. The cockatoos are also a dispersal agent as they will carry seeds to a distant perch to eat, but may drop them on the way.

The suggestion that extinct large animals (initially dinosaurs and later the Australian megafauna) may have been dispersers for the bunya is reasonable, given the size of the seeds and their energy content, but difficult to confirm given the incompleteness of the fossil record for coprolites.

&quot;A. bidwillii&quot; has an unusual cryptogeal seed germination in which the seeds develop to form an underground tuber from which the aerial shoot later emerges. The actual emergence of the seed is then known to occur over several years presumably as a strategy to allow the seedlings to emerge under optimum climatic conditions or, it has been suggested, to avoid fire. This erratic germination has been one of the main problems in silviculture of the species.

A problem in small forestry plantations of the bunya pine in Southeast Queensland is the introduction of red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;). Unlike possums and rodents, the deer eat bunya cones while still intact, preventing their dispersal.

==Cultural significance==
The &quot;bunya&quot;, &quot;bonye&quot;, &quot;bunyi&quot;, &quot;bunya-bunya&quot; or &quot;banya&quot; tree produces edible kernels. The ripe cones fall to the ground. Each segment contains a kernel in a tough protective shell, which will split when boiled or put in a fire. The flavour of the kernel is often compared to a chestnut, although it is less intense in terms of aroma and flavour. The savory flavour and aroma is also comparable to cooked potato.

The cones were a very important food source for native Australians – each Aboriginal family would own a group of trees and these would be passed down from generation to generation. This is said to be the only case of hereditary personal property owned by the Aboriginal people.

After the cones had fallen and the fruit was ripe, a large festival harvest would sometimes occur, between two and seven years apart. The people of the region would set aside differences and gather in the Bon-yi Mountains (Bunya Mountains) to feast on the kernels. The local people, who were bound by custodial obligations and rights, sent out messengers to invite people from hundreds of kilometres to meet at specific sites. The meetings involved Aboriginal ceremonies, dispute settlements and fights, marriage arrangements and the trading of goods.

In what was probably Australia&#x27;s largest Indigenous event, diverse tribes – up to thousands of people – once travelled great distances (from as far as Charleville, Bundaberg, Dubbo and Grafton) to the gatherings. They stayed for months, to celebrate and feast on the bunya nut. The bunya gatherings were an armistice accompanied by much trade exchange, and discussions and negotiations over marriage and regional issues. Due to the sacred status of the bunyas, some tribes would not camp amongst these trees. Also in some regions, the tree was never to be cut.

Representatives of many different groups from across southern Queensland and northern New South Wales would meet to discuss important issues relating to the environment, social relationships, politics and The Dreaming lore, feasting and sharing dance ceremonies. Many conflicts would be settled at this event, and consequences for breaches of laws were discussed.

A Bunya festival was recorded by Thomas Petrie (1831–1910), who went with the Aboriginal people of Brisbane at the age of 14 to the festival at the Bunya Range (now the Blackall Range in the hinterland area of the Sunshine Coast). His daughter, Constance Petrie, put down his stories in which he said that the trees fruited at three-year intervals. The three-year interval may not be correct. Ludwig Leichhardt wrote in 1844 of his expedition to the Bunya feast.

In 1842, the government of what was then the Colony of New South Wales published a notice in the N.S.W. Government Gazette which prohibited settlers from occupying land or cutting timber within a proclaimed &quot;Bunya district&quot;. This may have been in recognition of the local Aboriginal people&#x27;s close association with these trees, or their &quot;fierce protection&quot; of them. Regardless, the proclamation was repealed in 1860 in one of the first acts of the government of the newly created Colony of Queensland. The Aboriginal people were eventually driven out of the forests and the festivals ceased. The forests were felled for timber and cleared to make way for cultivation.

===Today===
Indigenous groups such as the Wakawaka, Githabul, Kabi Kabi, Jarowair, Goreng goreng, Butchulla, Quandamooka, Baruŋgam, Yiman and Wulili have continued cultural and spiritual connections to the Bunya Mountains to this day. A number of strategies including the use of traditional ecological knowledge have been incorporated into the current management practices of the national park and conservation reserves with the Bunya Murri Ranger project currently operating in the mountains.

==Uses==


Indigenous Australians eat the nut of the bunya tree (known as &quot;yenggi&quot; ) both raw and cooked, and also in its immature form. Traditionally, the nuts were additionally ground and made into a paste, which was eaten directly or cooked in hot coals to make bread called &quot;manu&quot;. The nuts were also stored in the mud of running creeks, and eaten in a fermented state. This was considered a delicacy.

Apart from consuming the nuts, Indigenous Australians ate bunya shoots, and utilised the tree&#x27;s bark as kindling.

Bunya nuts are still sold as a regular food item in grocery stalls and street-side stalls around rural southern Queensland. Some farmers in the Wide Bay/ Sunshine Coast regions have experimented with growing bunya trees commercially for their nuts and timber.

Bunya timber was and is still highly valued as &quot;tonewood&quot; for stringed instruments&#x27; sound boards since the first European settlers. Since the mid-1990s, the Australian company Maton has used bunya for the soundboards of its BG808CL Performer acoustic guitars. The Cole Clark company (also Australian) uses bunya for the majority of its acoustic guitar soundboards. The timber is valued by cabinet makers and woodworkers, and has been used for that purpose for over a century.

However, its most popular use is as a &#x27;bushfood&#x27; by indigenous foods enthusiasts. A huge variety of home-invented recipes now exists for the bunya nut; from pancakes, biscuits and breads, to casseroles, to &#x27;bunya nut pesto&#x27; or hoummus. The nut is considered nutritious, with a unique flavour similar to starchy potato and chestnut.

When the nuts are boiled in water, the water turns red, making a flavoursome tea.

The nutritional content of the bunya nut is: 40% water, 40% complex carbohydrates, 9% protein, 2% fat, 0.2% potassium, 0.06% magnesium. It is also gluten free, making bunya nut flour a substitute for people with gluten intolerance.

==Cultivation==

Bunya nuts are slow to germinate. A set of 12 seeds sown in Melbourne took an average of about six months to germinate (with the first germinating in three months) and only developed roots after one year. The first leaves form a rosette and are dark brown. The leaves only turn green once the first stem branch occurs. Unlike the mature leaves, the young leaves are relatively soft. As the leaves age they become very hard and sharp. Cuttings can be successful, though they must be taken from erect growing shoots, as cuttings from side shoots will not grow upright.

In the highly variable Australian climate, the varied timing of emergence of the seedlings maximises the possibility of at least successful replacement of the parent tree. A test of germination was carried out by Smith starting in 1999. Seeds were extracted from two mature cones collected from the same tree, a cultivated specimen at Petrie, just north of Brisbane (originally the homestead of Thomas Petrie, the son of the first European to report the species). One hundred apparently full seeds were selected and planted into 30 cm by 12 cm plastic tubes commercially filled with sterile potting mix in early February 1999. These were then placed in a shaded area and watered weekly. Four tubes were lost due to being knocked over. Of a total of 100 seeds placed, 87 germinated. The tubes were checked monthly for emergence over three years. Of these seeds, 55 emerged from April to December, 1999; 32 emerged from January to September in 2000, one seed emerged in January 2001, and the last appeared in February 2001.

Once established, bunyas are quite hardy and they can be grown as far south as Hobart in Australia (42° S) and Christchurch in New Zealand (43° S) and (at least) as far north as Sacramento in California (38° N) and Coimbra (in the botanical garden) and even in Dublin area in Ireland (53ºN) in a microclimate protected from arctic winds and moderated by the Gulf Stream. They will reach a height of 35 to 40 metres, and live for about 500 years.

==Dangers==
The cones of the bunya pine are some of the largest produced by the conifer family. The cones—which can grow to as much as in diameter when mature, and weigh up to —can drop on unsuspecting passersby from heights of or more. The falling cones are capable of causing severe injuries. Caution is also advised when parking under these trees as the falling cones can dent or damage vehicles.

==In popular culture==
A specimen of &quot;Araucaria bidwillii&quot; in East Los Angeles, California is featured in Taylor Hackford&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Blood In Blood Out&quot; as a touchstone for the main characters. The tree, known as &quot;El Pino&quot; (&quot;the pine&quot; in Spanish), has become famous from this association, and is visited by international fans of the film. A late-2020 prank claiming the tree would be cut down incited a brief panic locally.

<doc id="418258" wikidata="Q1811775" url="?curid=418258" title="Lee Cruce">
<text>Lee Cruce (July 8, 1863 – January 16, 1933) was an American lawyer, banker and the second governor of Oklahoma. Losing to Charles N. Haskell in the 1907 Democratic primary election to serve as the first governor of Oklahoma, Cruce successfully campaigned to succeed Haskell to serve as the second governor of Oklahoma. As governor, Cruce was responsible for the establishment of the Oklahoma Department of Highways and the Oklahoma State Capitol. He worked hard to enforce prohibitions on alcohol and gambling, going so far as to use the state militia to stop horse racing. He was succeeded by Robert L. Williams.

Born in Kentucky, Cruce worked as a lawyer, a banker, and a municipal official before his election as governor. After finishing his term as governor, he worked in the private sector and made an unsuccessful bid for the United States Senate. He died in 1933 in Los Angeles, California, and was buried in Ardmore, Oklahoma.

==Early life and move to Oklahoma==
Lee Cruce was born in the city of Marion, Kentucky, on July 8, 1863. He attended Marion Academy, and subsequently attended Vanderbilt University, receiving a law degree from the latter. Though he passed the Kentucky bar exam in 1888, he did not practice law until he joined his brother&#x27;s law firm, Johnson, Cruce and Cruce at Ardmore in Indian Territory in 1891.

After ten years of practicing law, Cruce entered the financial world as the first cashier of the Ardmore National Bank, of which he later served as the bank&#x27;s president. In 1901, Cruce was elected an alderman in the local government of Ardmore.

==Gubernatorial campaigns==
Through his combined positions of power in the Ardmore National Bank and the movement towards statehood in late 1906, Cruce submitted his name to the Democratic primary for governor of the newly created state of Oklahoma. The popular Charles N. Haskell defeated Cruce for the nomination, but before Haskell&#x27;s term ended in 1911, Cruce once again sought the Democratic nomination for governor and was successful. He then defeated his Republican opponent in the general election.

==Governor of Oklahoma==
Cruce was inaugurated as the second Governor of Oklahoma on January 9, 1911. Whereas the state&#x27;s first governor exercised extensive executive control over the Oklahoma Legislature through his force of personality, Cruce continually struggled for power against the state legislature throughout his term. Despite the power struggles, Cruce did manage to complete many of the projects he initiated. Cruce&#x27;s first major success came in the realm of automotives. With the increase in automobiles, the state legislature acted upon Cruce&#x27;s commendation and established the Oklahoma Department of Highways in 1911. Roads were improved with funds generated from an annual $1 license fee.

Next on the governor&#x27;s agenda was the construction of the Oklahoma State Capitol in the state capital, which Haskell officially moved from Guthrie to Oklahoma City in 1910. Under the supervision of Cruce, the state legislature established the three member State Capitol Commission in 1913. The commission was charged with purchasing land for the state capitol building. After purchasing the desired property in downtown Oklahoma City, on July 20, 1914, groundbreaking began. Then on November 16, 1915 (Oklahoma&#x27;s 8th birthday) the cornerstone was laid in Masonic fashion and construction began.

Believing the state needed to take on a greater moral role, Cruce supported enforcement of blue laws. Through specific legislation, Cruce and the state legislature closed businesses on Sundays, and declared prize fighting, gambling, bootlegging, and horseracing illegal. This, combined with Haskell&#x27;s prohibition plan, proved too much for the state to handle. The state legislature did not possess the funds needed to finance the operations and only ended up shifting funds around from one law enforcement agency to another. Cruce, on numerous occasions, in his role as Commander-in-Chief, called out the state militia to enforce his laws. The most famous of these events occurred when Cruce declared martial law in Tulsa to prevent a horserace from taking place. The race was brought to a halt as shots were fired over the heads of the jockeys.

Cruce was an avid abolitionist when it came to the use of capital punishment throughout the state. Pioneering the movement to abolish capital punishment, Cruce commuted twenty-two death sentences to life imprisonment and only one execution took place during his administration. Despite this, he did little to prevent lynchings of non-white people, explaining to the NAACP;
There is a race prejudice that exists between the white and Negro races wherever the Negroes are found in large numbers ... Just this week the announcement comes as a shock to the people of Oklahoma that the Secretary of the Interior ... has appointed a Negro from Kansas to come to Oklahoma and take charge of the supervision of the Indian schools of this State. There is no race of people on earth that has more antipathy for the Negro race than the Indian race, and yet these people, numbering many of the best citizens of this State and nation, are to be humbled and their prejudices and passions are to be increased by having this outrage imposed upon them ... If your organization would interest itself to the extent of seeing that such outrages as this are not perpetrated against our people, there would be fewer lynchings in the South than at this time ...

Congressional reapportionments nearly resulted in the downfall of Cruce&#x27;s administration. In 1912, Cruce vetoed a bill to reapportion the state into eight congressional districts designed to minimize Republican voting strength. This veto as well as the Governor&#x27;s attempts to abolish some public institutions for economic reasons, led the legislature to investigate the executive branch. As a result, the State Auditor, State Insurance Commissioner, and State Printer were impeached. Cruce himself escaped removal in the Oklahoma House of Representatives by a single vote.

By the end of his term in 1915, the voters were, for the most part, ready for a change. Looking for a new governor, the voters looked to Oklahoma Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert L. Williams. Elected in 1914 following the end of his only term on the court, Williams became the third governor of Oklahoma.

==Late life and legacy==

After Cruce left office, he would continue his career as a lawyer and banker through Oklahoma. In 1930, Cruce was defeated in the primary for the United States Senate losing out to Thomas Gore, one of Oklahoma&#x27;s first Senators. Cruce died January 16, 1933, in Los Angeles, California. He is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in his adopted hometown of Ardmore.

<doc id="418260" wikidata="Q1676987" url="?curid=418260" title="Jack C. Walton">
<text>John Calloway Walton (March 6, 1881 – November 25, 1949) was an American politician and the 5th Governor of Oklahoma, serving the shortest tenure. He was impeached and removed from office shortly into his first term. A populist member of the Democratic Party, Walton previously served as the 18th Mayor of Oklahoma City between 1919 and 1923.

Following his removal from office, he entered the primary for a seat in the United States Senate, winning the Democratic nomination, but losing to William B. Pine, a Republican. He was elected to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in 1932 and served until 1939, running for governor again in 1934 and 1938. He died in 1949 and is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Oklahoma City.

==Early life==
John Calloway Walton was born on March 6, 1881, near Indianapolis, Indiana. His family later moved to Lincoln, Nebraska and then again to Fort Smith, Arkansas. He attended Fort Smith Commercial College before finding work as a railroad timekeeper.

At the age of sixteen, Walton joined the United States Army in 1897, and served for six years. Walton did not see combat service during the Spanish–American War; however he did serve at a post in Mexico for some time. He claimed to have worked as the presidential train engineer for Porfirio Diaz while in Mexico, but this is likely untrue. However, he did study engineering in Mexico City before returning to Kansas City to work as a salesman.

Following his discharge from the Army in 1903, Walton traveled to Oklahoma Territory to make his life as a contractor in the field of civil engineering. Walton set up his practice in Oklahoma City. Around 1913 he cofounded the McIntosh and Walton Engineering Company. Some of Walton&#x27;s critics allege he did not arrive in Oklahoma City until 1915.

==Oklahoma City politics==
Walton joined the Democratic Party and by 1917 had earned a reputation as a charismatic politician.

===Mayor of Oklahoma City===
In 1917 Walton was elected Oklahoma City&#x27;s Commissioner of Public Works. Two years later Walton, known for very active campaigning and bringing a jazz band to his events, was elected as the Mayor of Oklahoma City in 1919. However Walton was not popular amongst Oklahoma City journalists who viewed him as a political upstart.

As Mayor, he launched a &quot;Purity Squad&quot; campaign against crime in the city and struggled with the city commission over control of the Oklahoma City Police Department throughout his term.

While Mayor, Walton had his first run-in with the rising Ku Klux Klan. On July 19, 1921, Walton declared that he had information that fifty per cent of the members of the Oklahoma City police department belonged to the Ku Klux Klan. Welton directed Chief Glitsch to investigate and to discharge every police officer who did not resign immediately from the Klan. On July 24, Mayor Welton was called on the telephone, and was told: “We warn you to lay off the Ku Klux Klan, or we will have to wait on you.” The mayor paid no attention to the warning, and the investigation went ahead.

In January 1922, Walton supported striking meat packers in the city by refusing to provide Oklahoma City Police Department protection to businesses with striking workers and providing food for striking workers. After the Lynching of Jake Brooks he denounced attempts to declare martial law in the city by James B. A. Robertson. His efforts earned him the support of the Socialist Party of Oklahoma, the Farmer-Labor Reconstruction League, and other farmer and labor organizations.

==Governor of Oklahoma==
===1922 Gubernatorial campaign and inauguration===

In 1922 the Farmer-Labor Reconstruction League&#x27;s George Wilson and the Socialist Party of Oklahoma faction led by Patrick S. Nagle organized the 1922 Shawnee Convention during the Oklahoma State Federation of Labor&#x27;s annual conference to create an 18-point platform, similar to North Dakota&#x27;s Non-Partisan League&#x27;s platform. After the conference began courting his endorsement, Walton agreed to run for governor on their platform.

Walton entered the 1922 Democratic primary as a candidate for Governor of Oklahoma to succeed James B. A. Robertson. Walton defeated the Ku Klux Klan backed R. H. Wilson and the conservative Democrat Thomas H. Owen. He continued his habit of campaigning with dramatic speeches and a jazz band during his general election for governor and went on to win the general election against the Republican candidate John Fields, despite an advertising campaign by conservative Democrats accusing him of &quot;Sovietism&quot; and &quot;state Socialism&quot;.

Walton was inaugurated as the fifth Governor of Oklahoma on January 9, 1923. Walton&#x27;s inauguration was hosted as a two day party in Oklahoma City with square dancing and barbecue. The party included &quot;antelope, bear, buffalo, five thousand chickens, deer, ducks, frogs, geese, two hundred hogs, two hundred possums, three
thousand rabbits, one thousand squirrels, five hundred beef &#x27;critters,&#x27; sweet potatoes, two hundred and fifty bushels of onions, one hundred thousand loaves of bread, and one hundred thousand buns&quot; and &quot;20,000 gallons of coffee.&quot; Attendance estimates range from 60,000 to 150,000 people.

===Tenure===
Once in office Walton appointed the Socialist organizer Patrick S. Nagle to a key advisership role. Walton pushed through agricultural reform: establishing agriculture warehouses, advanced farmer&#x27;s cooperatives, and farmer&#x27;s community market associations. Other agricultural reform included a revision of the Workman&#x27;s Compensation Law for improved benefits to employees and stronger warehouse inspection laws to satisfy Oklahoma&#x27;s cotton and wheat farmers.

He also vehemently opposed the death penalty, vowing no executions would happen during his term. He also liberally used pardons and encouraged the liberal use of parole, all of which proved unpopular with the Oklahoma Legislature. He also passed through the Legislature Oklahoma&#x27;s first program to allow free text books to all students in Oklahoma&#x27;s schools, passed through a grant of over $1,000,000 in state funds to aid weak schools, instituted harsher penalties for breaking state laws and regulations, increased spending on welfare programs, and instituted a farm stabilization program under the supervision of the State Board of Agriculture.

Walton heavily appointed his political allies to state jobs. On one occasion, he removed five members of the Oklahoma University Board of Regents, replacing them with political allies. Another such ally, George Wilson, Walton&#x27;s pick for president of Oklahoma A&amp;M College, lacked a college degree and was installed with an escort from the Oklahoma National Guard after protests in Stillwater.

Walton later lost the support of his populist and progressive allies when he purchased a personal mansion in Oklahoma City and a second home in Muskogee with financial backing from oilman, and future governor, E. W. Marland. He replaced his former allies in state jobs with more conservative Democrats as he began to campaign for the 1924 United States Senate election in Oklahoma. He also requested a raise from $5,000 to $200,000 a year, which alienated his former allies and the legislature.

The Ku Klux Klan had between 75,000 and 105,000 members in Oklahoma in 1923, including many prominent Oklahomans. Walton himself had both criticized the Klan and been reported as a member. On June 26, 1923, Walton declared martial law in Okmulgee County in order to crack down on reports of mob violence from the Ku Klux Klan. He deployed 400 Oklahoma National Guard troops to the county for three days, with a small contingent occupying Henryetta until July 10. On August 10, four men beat Nata Hantaman in Tulsa after he was questioned by police. The assault led Walton to institute martial law again, this time in Tulsa County, on August 14 after no arrests were made. General Baird H. Markham led 150 Oklahoma National Guard troops into Tulsa and began investigating mob violence in the city. Four Klansmen were later arrested and sentenced for rioting. The Oklahoma press attacked Walton&#x27;s expansion of power, with one of his own secretaries saying he had &quot;the power of George III&quot; in Tulsa.

On September 6 Walton named the Klan, for the first time, as the target of his use of martial law. Oklahoma Klan Grand Dragon N. C. Jewett defiantly told the governor the Klan in the state would not be broken. On the 11, he banned all Klan demonstrations for the duration of his administration.

===Impeachment and removal===
Walton&#x27;s main opponents in Oklahoma politics were &quot;disappointed office-seekers, the Klan, and the school bloc&quot; according to a 1930 study.

The Oklahoma Constitution strictly forbade any member of the state government from suspending habeas corpus and the legislature was outraged by Governor Walton&#x27;s move to do so in Tulsa County. In response, a grand jury was ordered to convene in Oklahoma City S based on a petition by Campbell Russell on the September 17 order of Judge George W. Clark. On the September 20, William Dalton McBee organized a meeting of 64 other Oklahoma legislators at the Skirvin Hotel where they issued a proclamation, modeled off the Declaration of Independence, announcing their intention to convene a special session of the Oklahoma Legislature despite lacking constitutional authority to call their own special session on the 26th.

Following the announcement of the creation of the grand jury, on September 23, 1923, Walton declared &quot;absolute martial law&quot; for the entire state to prevent a &quot;klan conspiracy.&quot; He threatened to have the Oklahoma National Guard shoot any legislators attempting to meet at the capitol on the 26th. That day, 68 members of the legislator showed up for the special session and were dispersed by national guardsmen from the capitol, forcing them to return to the Skirvin Hotel. Back at the hotel, 54 men &quot;from Chicago&quot; were at the hotel to intimidate state legislators.

On September 28 Oklahoma Secretary of State Richard A. Sneed ruled a petition amendment to allow the legislature to meet would be scheduled for October 2. The Oklahoma Supreme Court approved the election the next day. On October 1, Walton declared an indefinite postponement of the referendum and threatened to use troops to prevent the election, however most counties held their elections anyway with only minor incidents. The amendment passed and McBee gathered enough legislator signatures to call a special session on October 17. Walton offered to resign in exchange for the legislature passing anti-Klan legislation and called an October 11 special session.

Under the supervision of the Speaker of the House William Dalton McBee, the House brought twenty-two charges (with six later dismissed) against Walton on October 16. Representative Wesley E. Disney, acted as the prosecutor in the Senate, which oversaw his impeachment trial in its function as the Court of Impeachment. His impeachment trial was presided over by the chief justice of the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Of the House&#x27;s twenty-two charges, eleven were sustained, including &quot;illegal collection of campaign funds, padding the public payroll, suspension of habeas corpus, excessive use of the pardon power, and general incompetence.&quot; On November 19, 1923, Walton was convicted and removed from office. Lieutenant Governor Trapp succeeded Walton and became the sixth Governor of Oklahoma on the same day.

The impeachment is said to have &quot;frightened&quot; the state &quot;into a system of preferential voting as an escape from minority nominations.&quot; Walton received 44% of the total votes cast in the Democratic primary, yet not a majority. This perceived injustice induced the legislature to adopt a different electoral system. Eventually, they created the primary electoral system in the state.

==Later political activity and death==
In 1924, the year after Walton&#x27;s removal from office, U.S. Senator Robert L. Owen retired; he had represented Oklahoma in the Senate since it became a state in 1907. Walton promptly entered the primary for Senator and won the Democratic nomination with just 30% of the vote, narrowly defeating Rep. E. B. Howard. Walton may have won the nomination so soon after his removal from office because he was the only Democratic candidate to criticize the Klan publicly. However, Walton lost in the general election in a landslide (62% to 35%) to Republican William B. Pine. Leading Democrats in the state responded by enacting a ranked-choice voting scheme that required voters to support second and third choices in order for their ballots to count, a provision that resulted in the primary electoral system being ruled unconstitutional by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. After that legislation was passed to implement the run-off system that is in place in the state today.

In 1931, Walton ran for another term as Mayor of Oklahoma City, but lost the election. In 1932 he was elected to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, serving from 1933 to 1939. In 1934, and again in 1938, he ran for Governor, losing both times in Democratic primary. He died on November 25, 1949 and is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Oklahoma City.

<doc id="418261" wikidata="Q492551" url="?curid=418261" title="Maio, Cape Verde">
<text>Maio is the easternmost of the Sotavento islands of Cape Verde. Maio is located south of the island of Boa Vista and east of Santiago. Administratively, the island forms one &quot;concelho&quot; (municipality): Maio.

==History==
The island was discovered in 1460. It was first settled at the end of the 16th century, when the land was used to raise livestock, especially goats. Salt was first exploited in the 17th century which caused the population to grow. The English exported salt to Europe from Porto Inglês, hence the name of that city.

The inconclusive Battle of Maio was fought between British and French frigate squadrons off the island&#x27;s southern coast on 23 January 1814 in the last stages of the Napoleonic Wars. Due to persisting drought many inhabitants emigrated from Maio in the 20th century.

==Geography==
The island has an area of 274.5 km2. It is 24.1 km long and 16.3 km wide. The tallest mountain on the island (436 m) is near the east coast, in a mountain range named Monte Penoso. Terras Salgadas is a salty plain in the far north. The northernmost point on the island is Ponta Cais. 20% of the island area (54.5 km2) is forested and 28% of the island area (76.0 km2) is a protected area. Bays includes Baía do Galeão and Baía da Santana to the north and in the southeast is a lagoon named Lagoa Cimidor. The uninhabited islet Ilhéu Laje Branca lies near its north coast. The island&#x27;s main town is Porto Inglês, near which its airport, Maio Airport lies.

==Municipality==

Administratively, the island of Maio is covered by one municipality, &quot;Concelho do Maio&quot;. This municipality consists of one &quot;freguesia&quot; (civil parish), &quot;Nossa Senhora da Luz&quot;, which also covers the whole island. The &quot;freguesia&quot; is subdivided into the following settlements:

*Alcatraz
*Barreiro (town)
*Calheta (town)
*Cascabulho
*Figueira
*Morro
*Morrinho
*Pedro Vaz
*Pilão Cão
*Porto Inglês (city)
*Praia Gonçalo
*Ribeira Dom João
*Santo António
===Politics===

Since 2004, the Movement for Democracy (MpD) is the ruling party of the municipality. The results of the latest elections, in 2016:

==Population==

In the 1830s, the population was estimated at 2,500. Most people in Maio are Roman Catholic.

==Economy==
The island prospered around salt collecting in its early days of colonialism, with a little agriculture and grazing.

There are two types of agriculture practiced in Maio, rain fed and irrigated. During the raining season products as corn, beans, pumpkins and melons are being cultivated. Products that farmers cultivate year round are sweet potato, cassava, papaya, fig, coconut and tamarind. Goats, cows, pigs, chickens and donkeys are common on the island. Few people own a horse. Scarcity of water is the biggest problem for the locals.

Fishery is important and abundant available. Tuna, sailfish and different coral fishes such as the coral hind are caught.

The economy is heavily supported by migrants who send money to their family on the island.

==Sports==
Football is by far the most popular sport, but basketball and futsal along with water sports as surfing, diving and swimming are becoming more popular.

==Notable people==
*Maria Helena da Costa Dias, Cape Verdean born Portuguese writer and translator
*Edy Tavares, basketball player
*Horace Silver, jazz pianist, composer, and arranger
*Joana Rosa, politician. Minister of Justice of Cape Verde (2021- )

<text>Henry Simpson Johnston (December 30, 1867 – January 7, 1965) was an American lawyer and politician who served as a delegate to the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention, the first president pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate, and the seventh governor of Oklahoma. He would become the second governor in Oklahoma history to be impeached and removed from office.

As governor, Johnston successfully proposed the establishment of a crippled children&#x27;s hospital and a large increase to school aid funds. His trouble began with complaints about his private secretary holding too much power and making executive decisions that he should be making. After an unsuccessful and unconstitutional special session to impeach the governor in 1927, a new group of state lawmakers impeached the governor in 1929.

Johnston died in 1965 and is buried in Perry, Oklahoma.

==Early life==
Born in a log cabin on December 30, 1867, Johnston was a native of Evansville, Indiana. At age 24, Johnston would move to Colorado where he studied law and passed the bar exam in 1891. After a few years in Colorado, Johnston would move to Perry in Oklahoma Territory where he would become a powerful and popular figure throughout the area of Noble County.

Upon announcement that Oklahoma and Indian Territories were to combine into one state, Johnston was elected in 1906 to represent Noble and the surrounding counties at the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention. During the convention, Johnston would be elected to serve in the body&#x27;s number-two office as the President Pro Tempore of the Convention. Johnston met future governors Charles N. Haskell, William H. Murray and Robert L. Williams. These men would work together to write one of the most progressive Constitutions of any U.S. state, as well as the longest governing document in the world at the time.

On November 16, 1907, the United States Congress accepted the Oklahoma Constitution. On the same day, Charles N. Haskell was inaugurated as the state&#x27;s first governor. Before the state constitution was approved, Johnston ran and was elected to the Oklahoma Senate to serve in the 1st Oklahoma Legislature. A popular figure, Johnston was selected to serve as the first President Pro Tempore of the Oklahoma Senate, the state senate&#x27;s highest official behind the Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma, who serves as President of the Oklahoma Senate.

Among his most powerful supporters were prohibitionists, Protestant churchmen, and Freemasons. Johnston himself would serve as the Grand Master of the Masonic Lodge of Oklahoma. So popular was Johnston that he placed his name in the Democratic primary in 1926 to run for Governor of Oklahoma to replace outgoing Governor Martin E. Trapp. During the campaign, Johnston was supported by the Ku Klux Klan. Winning the general election, Johnston was inaugurated as the seventh governor of Oklahoma.

==Governor of Oklahoma==
On January 10, 1927, Johnston was inaugurated as the seventh Governor of Oklahoma with all the hopes of a successful administration. Immediately, the Oklahoma Legislature approved Johnston&#x27;s appropriation proposals to establish a crippled children&#x27;s hospital and increased school aid funds to over $1,500,000 a year. As one observer cited, it was the &quot;highest public school subsidy in state history at the time&quot;.

However, problems would haunt Johnston&#x27;s governorship from the beginning. Before the state legislature adjourned in May 1927, complaints were raised against Johnston&#x27;s private secretary, Mrs. O. O. Hammonds. The legislative leaders believed Hammonds held too much power over the governor. It was even believed that she went so far to make executive decisions and appointments in her own right. Believing that Johnston was neglecting his duties, the leaders of the state legislature&#x27;s demanded that she be immediately discharged from the governor&#x27;s services.

Determined to impeach Johnston for neglect of his duties by the end of 1927, the legislative leaders met in special session under a newly adopted initiative proposition. This measure was introduced to deal with Governor Jack C. Walton&#x27;s impeachment four years earlier. In this special session, the state legislature announced its plans to investigate the governor. Before the Oklahoma Legislature could act, the Oklahoma Supreme Court intervened to the benefit of Johnston. The court ruled in the case &quot;Simpson v. Hill&quot; that the Legislature&#x27;s actions were unconstitutional and that they could only meet during regular sessions or at the call of the governor in special session. Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s example, Oklahoma City&#x27;s district court issued an injunction against the Oklahoma Legislature, preventing state lawmakers from convening.

Ignoring both courts, the state legislature proceeded with its plans and headed for the Oklahoma State Capitol to continue with impeachment charges. The Oklahoma Legislature was only stopped when Oklahoma National Guard troops, under the orders of Johnston, prevented them from entering the Capitol. This did not stop the Legislature from acting. The Legislature convened on December 13, 1927 in the Huckins Hotel in downtown Oklahoma City. There, the Oklahoma House of Representatives raised charges, which the Oklahoma Senate as the Court of Impeachment agreed to, against Governor Johnston and many members of his administration. However, realizing that the judicial branch sided with the executive branch on this matter and that the courts were concerned over the legality of their session, the state senate dismissed the issues and the state legislature adjourned. The whole event only made Johnston more popular and powerful. The people loved him for using the courts to decide the issue, rather than martial law.

==Impeachment==

Johnston returned to serve for several months without any harassment from the state legislature. However, everything changed toward the end of 1928. That year, the Democrats had selected Al Smith as their U.S. presidential nominee to challenge the Republican nominee, Herbert Hoover. Supporting his Democratic ally, Johnston campaigned in the state on Smith&#x27;s behalf. Smith, a Catholic, supported the end of prohibition and he spoke out against &quot;religious bigots&quot;. Hoover won the presidency in an overwhelming national landslide with 58% of the popular vote. In Oklahoma, Hoover did even better and trounced Smith with 63.7% of the vote and many Oklahoma Republicans won state offices on his coattails, including seats on the Oklahoma Supreme Court, a near majority in the Oklahoma House, and large gains in the Oklahoma Senate. Johnston was left alone as the only strong Democratic figure in the state.

When the state legislature met in regular session in 1929, both Democrats and Republicans crafted a second wave of impeachment charges. Of the thirteen charges presented by the Oklahoma House of Representatives, the state senate accepted eleven. On January 21, Johnston was officially suspended from office and Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma William J. Holloway became acting governor. Johnston&#x27;s impeachment trial began on February 6 and would last over six weeks. The trial came to an end on March 20 with the State Senate removing Johnston from office on the eleventh charge: general incompetence. The ten other charges were dismissed. On the same day, Holloway became the eighth governor of Oklahoma. He was the second lieutenant governor to become governor through the gubernatorial succession process in state history, the first being Martin E. Trapp.

==Later life and legacy==
Following impeachment, Johnston returned to practice law in Perry. Four years later, he would win a term in the state senate, serving from 1933 to 1937. After leaving the Senate, he would once again return to practice law in Perry, where he died at the age of 97 on January 7, 1965. He was the longest-lived governor in Oklahoma history, before or since. Johnston is buried in Perry.

The removal of Johnston proved to be the Oklahoma Legislature&#x27;s apex of dominance against the other two branches of state government. Over the first two decades of Oklahoma&#x27;s state existence, the state legislature had brought impeachment charges against four governors and had removed two. Only Governors Charles N. Haskell and Robert L. Williams would wield great executive power during this time.

Nationwide, it would be nearly 60 years before another U.S. governor was impeached—Governor Evan Mecham of Arizona in 1988.

<doc id="418266" wikidata="Q2741081" url="?curid=418266" title="Oakley, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Oakley is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. It has an area of and includes about 400 households. The 2021 Census recorded the population as 1,128.

At one time it was thought Oakley held a rare (and possibly unique) double distinction, in that a Victoria Cross recipient, Edward Brooks, and a Medal of Honor recipient, James J. Pym, were both born in the village. However, the latter, a namesake of a contemporary James Pym from Oakley, has been found to be from Garsington, a village away in Oxfordshire.

In 1963 Oakley was centre of national and international news, when Leatherslade Farm, near Oakley, was used as a hideout by the criminal gang involved in the Great Train Robbery.

==Geography==
The parish is in the west of Buckinghamshire, adjoining the boundary with Oxfordshire. It is roughly diamond shaped, extending a maximum east to west and south to north. Oakley parish is bounded to the north-west by Boarstall parish, north-east by Brill, east by Chilton, south by Ickford and Worminghall and in the extreme west by Horton-cum-Studley in Oxfordshire. There were once four hamlets that stood within the vicinity of the parish of Oakley. Brill and Boarstall are now parishes in their own right. The hamlet of Studley was, many years ago, annexed to nearby Horton in Oxfordshire, to become Horton-cum-Studley. The hamlet of Little London became part of Oakley parish in 1934 and lies to the north of the B4011 road. The hamlet of Addingrove now no longer exists and its chapel has long since fallen into disrepair, but Addingrove Farm still exists and is south-east of Oakley. The hamlet of The Foresters lies about 750 yards to the North-West of Oakley on the B4011, it consists of twelve houses, including a former public house called The Foresters (closed in 1917).

The village proper is about north-west of Long Crendon and south of Brill, mainly to the south of the B4011 road, midway between Thame and Bicester. The land is generally just below above sea level, that contour passing through Little London Green. At one time the village was owned by the dukes of Marlborough.

==Etymology==
Oakley&#x27;s toponym is derived from Old English meaning &quot;Oak-lea&quot;, a clearing within the oaks. Originally, the village was probably a collection of small huts around the stream, at the church end of the village, although the parish church as it is known today had not been built. The village would have been in Bernwood Forest. The Forest was not oak trees from horizon to horizon. In the Early Middle Ages a forest was a legally defined hunting area, with some densely wooded areas, shrub land, parks of pastureland and areas of cultivation.

Oakley&#x27;s name has been variously spelt through the ages (parenthesised dates denote earliest occurrence): &quot;Achelei&quot; (1086); &quot;Akeley&quot; (12th century), &quot;Aclei&quot;, &quot;Acle&quot;, &quot;Ocle&quot; (13th century); &quot;Ocle iuxta Brehull&quot; (14th century); and &quot;Whokeley&quot; (16th century).

==History==

===11th to 13th centuries===
Before the Norman Conquest two hides of land in Oakley belonged to Alwid (or Ælfgeth) the maid, and another half a hide of land granted her by Godric the sheriff on condition that she taught his daughter embroidery. Alwid is supposed to have been the same lady who held lands in Wiltshire under the name of Leuide, embroiderer to the King and Queen.

Oakley, like many English settlements, has its first written mention in the Domesday Book in 1086. It was a settlement in the Hundred of Ixhill. Robert Doyley, son of Walter, held &quot;Achelei&quot; (as Oakley was called). The exact area is not known, since borders with other local villages were not specified. The village was valued at £6, and its land consisted of 5¾ hides; with Oakley&#x27;s clay soil the total cultivated land would have been around . Seven ploughs, three by the Lord of the Manor and four by nine villagers (consisting of seven smallholdings) tilled the land. There were three slaves in the village and there was enough woodland for 200 pigs. Other local places mentioned in the Domesday Book were Brill, Addingrove and Nashway.

The earliest parts, the nave and some pillars, of the present church date from around 1100. In 1142 Empress Matilda granted Oakley parish church, with its chapels of Brill, Boarstall and Addingrove to the monks of St Frideswide&#x27;s Priory, in Oxford. St Frideswide&#x27;s Monastery much later became Christ Church, Oxford. In 1208 William Basset was confirmed by King John, the knight&#x27;s fee of Oakley (&quot;i.e.&quot; the Manor of Oakley), which his grandfather Osmund had held by charter of Brian FitzCount. In 1222 Ralphe de Norwich became first Rector of Oakley, appointed by the Henry III who had recovered the right of advowson by judgement of his Court at Westminster. Ralphe later founded the priory at Chetwode in 1226. A transaction in 1224 mentions selions (cultivated strips of land) in Oakley, suggesting an open field system, &quot;i.e.&quot; no fences or hedges. The Oakley area would have been a populated landscape of mixed farming and woodland, with roadways, drovers&#x27; roads, flocks of sheep, herds of cattle and pigs, small areas of meadow, and open fields of barley and oats (and possibly some wheat).

===14th to 16th centuries===
1327 John de Abingdon became the first vicar of Oakley (as opposed to rector). 1349 William de Grauntpont died in office as vicar of Oakley, probably of the Black Death. The first estimate of Oakley&#x27;s population was, made by &quot;Lysons&quot;, of 257 in 1377.

In 1522 Oakley&#x27;s population of men eligible for military service (ages 16–60) was estimated at 140. The oldest existing houses in the village date from around this time. In 1570 coppicing enclosures drew complaints from Richard Leigh of Oakley (lord of Oakley). In 1586 Oakley had about 248 inhabitants in 56 households (22 landholders and 58 with small cottages within the Forest). These figures were drawn up by Hugh Cope of Oakley in his Court of the Exchequer return.

In 1589 Roman Catholic layman Thomas Belson escaped capture in Aston Rowant, Oxfordshire and fled to Ixhill Lodge in Oakley, where he hid in a priest hole. After some time he went to Oxford but was captured, tried and convicted in London and was hanged, drawn and quartered in Oxford.

===17th century===
In 1603 the &quot;Return of Communicants&quot; gave Oakley&#x27;s population as 238. In the period 1622 to 1635 the Crown decided to remove Royal Forest status from Bernwood Forest, along with the severe laws protecting its contents (wood, animals and people). This was a most significant event for Oakley (and Brill and Boarstall), and transformed the economic balance of society. It modernised the farming structures of the communities in ways that left problems of poverty and rural under-employment for the smallholders and the landless.

The process of disafforestation – analogous in modern terms to privatisation – should not be confused with deforestation, meaning to strip a forest of its trees. Nevertheless, disafforestation of Bernwood Forest led to a gradual deforestation over subsequent centuries.

The &quot;Cottrell-Dormer&quot; enumeration of cottages recorded Oakley&#x27;s population as 122 in 1622. In 1626 nine men were summoned to Aylesbury to resolve disafforestation issues. Two, Sir Timothy Tyrrell and John Dynham, were from Oakley.

The effect of the English Civil War of 1642–46 on Oakley is unrecorded. It was near the front line between the Parliamentarian and Royalist sides. It was at this time the church font was smashed, according to local tradition, by Parliamentarian troops. Foraging by soldiers from both sides would have made caused even more problems to local villagers exacerbating problems due to disafforestation. In 1662, according to Hearth tax returns the population was 238. The &quot;Compton Census&quot; returned a population of 258 for Oakley in 1676.

===18th century===
&quot;Bishop Wake&#x27;s visitation returns&quot; recorded Oakley as having 216 inhabitants. In 1713 a lace school is recorded as being in the village. On 8 May 1718 George I made William Cadogan the 1st Baron Cadogan of Oakley. Oakley&#x27;s surviving parish records start in 1726, later than many English parishes. Most local parishes have registers dating from the 16th century, Worminghall going back to 1538.

The index of the Poll for Knights of the Shire for the County of Bucks in April 1784, listed 11 knights in Oakley: Edward Batt, Thomas Dorrington, Isaac Fennimore, Thomas Hawes, Francis Kirby, Leonard Paulin, Robert Piers, Thomas Needham Rees, John Stevens, Reverend Robert Twicross and Thomas Wyatt.

In 1790 Mark Ing was recorded as being a member of the Oakley Morris Men. In 1798 Buckinghamshire was the only county to have kept a complete record of an early census called &quot;Posse Commitatus&quot;. Oakley at this time had 21 farmers, a cordwainer, a carpenter, a pedlar and a schoolmaster (although Oakley&#x27;s school was not established until the 1850s). 24 labourers and 12 other men were listed.

===19th century===
The United Kingdom Census of 1801 recorded 257 inhabitants in 65 families living in 34 houses recorded in Oakley. The 1811 census recorded 325 people in Oakley. The first attempt to enclose Oakley was in 1818 and was unsuccessful.

382 people were recorded in the 1821 census. In the same year, the enclosure of common land was opposed by a mob that tried to prevent the attorney attaching notice of it to the church door. Villagers were outraged because large areas of land were granted to local landowners and were sold to cover the cost of the enclosure. Only were awarded to smallholders and only were set aside for the poor. The poor in Oakley would have to survive on what was left of Poor Folk&#x27;s Pasture in Boarstall parish, itself subject to stringent eligibility rules. The enclosure listed every landowner in the village. The 1831 census gave Oakley&#x27;s population as 413. In 1833 a turnpike was approved between Bicester and Thame, passing through the centre of Oakley. This is now the B4011 and bypasses the village.

The first four censuses were merely a head count, but the United Kingdom Census 1841 was more detailed.

On 20 October 1844, the hamlet of Studley, which had been part of Oakley parish, was transferred to Horton-cum-Studley in Oxfordshire, as a result of Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844

The 1851 census noted that houses had been demolished in Oakley as villagers left (for English cities and emigration to the Americas). The population was 425.

Oakley School was first recorded in use in 1853, in what is now School Lane. The first headmaster was Henry Fenemore.

In the 1860s Charles Edmund Clutterbuck, a master stained glass artist, made two windows for the parish church. They are the south window in the vestry and the east window in the north aisle. Between the years 1880–1887 Oakley church was re-dedicated from Saint Matthew to Saint Mary.

In 1889 a new local magazine was first printed, Waddesdon Deanery News. There was no mention of any Oakley people in the page of Oakley news in issue 1. However, in issue Number 2 in February 1889 carried the story about a pantomime and concert at the school – a complete success that befittingly crowned the exertions and careful organisations of its promoter, Miss Boys. A full-dress rehearsal of the piece was given on the previous evening to the Sunday School. Children were not invited in vain, a tea feast (generously given by Mrs. Kirby) winding up an extra-special treat, which coming as a surprise was all the more thoroughly enjoyed.

The first Parish Council was formed on 19 December 1894. Its members were Thomas Brooks, James Eborn, Rev. William Greenwood, James Kirby and Thomas Kirby.

===20th century===
Oakley Public Library (in the Lady Verney Reading Room) was opened on 17 February 1911 and closed in 1936.

On 1 August 1910 the British painter etcher and engraver James Henry Govier was born at Oakley to Henry and Mary Ann (&quot;née&quot; Measey) Govier. In 1914 the family moved to Gorseinon in Glamorgan.

During the First World War about 93 village boys went to war, of which 23 gave their lives for their country, including four brothers named Measey. Charles, Frank, George and Thomas were the sons of Joseph and Martha Measey (&quot;née&quot; Gladdy) of The Royal Oak. Thomas the first to be killed was a private in the 101st Machine Gun Corps. He died on 20 January 1917 aged 33 and was buried at the Cite Bonjean Military Cemetery at Armentieres in France. Charles was a private in the 146th Machine Gun Corps and was killed on 11 November 1917. He is buried at the Aeroplane Cemetery in Belgium. Frank was a corporal in the 7th Battalion of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. He was killed in action on 22 June 1918 and was buried at the Karasouli Military Cemetery on the Macedonian front in Greece. George the fourth son to be die, was a private in the 2nd/4th Battalion of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. He ended up as a wounded prisoner of war at the Hotel Berthad at Chateau Loes in Switzerland and died of illness on 5 October 1918. He is buried at St. Martin&#x27;s Cemetery, Vevey, Switzerland.

Victoria Cross recipient Edward Brooks was born in Oakley, winning his medal at Fayet, near St Quentin, France on 28 April 1917. While taking part in a raid on the enemy&#x27;s trenches, he saw that the front wave was being checked by an enemy machine gun. On his own initiative he rushed forward from the second wave, killed one of the gunners with his revolver and bayoneted another. The remainder of the gun crew then made off, leaving the gun, whereupon the company sergeant-major turned it on the retreating enemy, after which he carried it back to Allied lines. His courageous action undoubtedly prevented many casualties and greatly added to the success of the operation.

The alehouse called &quot;The Foresters&quot; on the Bicester Road closed in about 1919. An alehouse was an ordinary domestic house in which people were allowed to come into the kitchen or front room to drink beer, but not spirits.

In 1934, by Bucks Review Order, Little London, then part of Brill, was added to Oakley.

On 27 May 1942 RAF Oakley opened and became operational, initially a satellite airfield for RAF Bicester and then in August 1942 as RAF Westcott&#x27;s satellite. No 11 Operational Training Unit (No 11 OTU) moved to Westcott in September 1942, many Vickers Wellingtons were located here. After Victory in Europe Day in 1945, orders were received to clear the hangar and fit it for the provision of refreshment and succour to thousands of repatriated prisoners of war brought here as part of Operation Exodus. RAF Oakley was closed to flying in August of that year.

Two men from Oakley died in the war and are commemorated on the Oakley Roll of Honour.

Halls Brewery gave the playing fields to Oakley Village in 1948.
In 1957 Oakley Village Hall was completed having been built and financed by the village. In 1959 the original Oakley School in Bicester Road was closed and Oakley Combined School in Worminghall Road was opened, the first new post-war school to be built in Aylesbury Vale. The Sun Inn, an alehouse rather than a public house, closed in about 1961.

In 1963 Oakley was centre of national and international news, when Leatherslade Farm, near Oakley, was used as a hideout by the criminal gang involved in the Great Train Robbery. John Maris, a local farm worker, alerted police to the hideout at the farm. John Wooley, a local policeman from Brill, was the first officer to go to the hideout.

On 16 January 1991 Malcolm Rifkind opened the section of the M40 motorway: the stretch between Waterstock and Wendlebury, passing through Oakley parish. In 1997 the Oakley Village Appraisal / ACORN report reviewed what villagers thought about the village and what changes they would like to see. It was the most successful village appraisal in Buckinghamshire for a village of Oakley&#x27;s size, with over 70% response.

===21st century===
In 2003 Oakley featured in national and international news again through an exhibition marking the 40th anniversary of the Great Train Robbery. The guest speakers included the mastermind behind the robbery and ex-gang-leader Bruce Reynolds, John Wooley and John Maris (see above) – all meeting for the first time. On show were memorabilia from the robbery, Bruce Reynold&#x27;s Lotus Cortina, the lorry and one of the Land Rovers used in the raid. Like many other English villages, in the years between 2000 and 2011, Oakley lost many local facilities, including its post office, shop, surgery, filling station and one of its pubs (the Royal Oak). The remaining businesses include one public house (the Chandos Arms) and Oakley Garage. 

On 28 April 2017, a paving stone will be laid at the foot of the war memorial to commemorate 100 years since the winning of a Victoria Cross by Edward Brooks in Fayet, France on 28 April 1917 (only two such stones will be laid in Buckinghamshire).

On 30 September 2021, Oakley Parish Council bought the Chandos Arms. from Punch Taverns. after the company had threatened to de-licence this last remaining pub and sell it as a development opportunity. This action will ensure the facility is available for the villagers over the next decades. Other plans for the village in 2022 are a small shop and cafe attached to the village hall and rollout of ultrafast broadband to the village. 

St. Mary&#x27;s parish is now part of the Church of England Benefice of Worminghall with Ickford, Oakley and Shabbington.

Oakley Church of England Combined School is a mixed, voluntary controlled primary school, that takes children between the ages of four and 11. It has about 100 pupils.

The village had a football club, Oakley United, which was successful in the Oxford Senior League and Oving Cup during the 2010s.

<text>Henry Louis Bellmon (September 3, 1921 – September 29, 2009) was an American Republican politician from the U.S. State of Oklahoma. A member of the Oklahoma Legislature, he went on to become both the 18th and 23rd governor of Oklahoma, mainly in the 1960s and again in the 1980s, as well as a two-term United States Senator in the 1970s. He was the first Republican to serve as Governor of Oklahoma and, after his direct predecessor George Nigh, only the second governor to be reelected.

A World War II veteran, Bellmon served a single term in the Oklahoma House of Representatives, before running for governor. After serving in the U.S. Senate, he returned to serve again as governor and was responsible for passing a large education reform package. He died in 2009 after a long struggle with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Early life and career==
Bellmon was born in Tonkawa, Oklahoma, and graduated from Billings High School in Billings, Oklahoma. He graduated from Oklahoma A &amp; M (now Oklahoma State University) in 1942 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in agriculture. He was a lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps from 1942 to 1946. He was a tank platoon leader in the Pacific Theater of World War II. He took part in four amphibious landings on Pacific islands, including Iwo Jima. For his service, he was awarded the Legion of Merit and a Silver Star. After the war he returned to farming and took up politics.

Bellmon served a single term in the Oklahoma House of Representatives from 1947 to 1949. In January 1947, he married Shirley Osborn, to whom he remained married until her death in 2000. In 1960 he served as the State Republican Party Chairman.

==Governor of Oklahoma==
In 1962, beating the studied journalist and well known constructor Bill Atkinson with 392,316 votes (55.3%), Bellmon became Oklahoma&#x27;s first Republican governor since statehood in 1907. While governor, he served as the chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission and as a member of the executive committee of the National Governor&#x27;s Association. He was unable to run for reelection in 1966; at the time, Oklahoma did not allow governors to immediately succeed themselves. Republican Dewey F. Bartlett was elected as his successor.
As governor, Bellmon in 1965 pardoned convicted murderer Ernest Burkhart, known for his role in the Osage Indian murders.

==United States Senate==
In 1968, he was serving as the national chairman for Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidential election campaign, but then decided to run for the U.S. Senate, and won, unseating U.S. Senator A.S. Mike Monroney.

His 1974 contest was far closer and ultimately was resolved by the Senate. On election night, He led Rep. Ed Edmondson by only 3,835 votes. Edmondson challenged the result alleging irregularities in the voting, specifically that Tulsa County did not have levers to allow straight-ticket voting, as required under state law, and that the machines had misleading instructions. The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that there were problems, but Edmondson could not demonstrate that they would have changed the result. Edmondson then appealed to the Senate in January 1975, asking it to take up the challenge. Although the Senate voted to seat Bellmon, this was done without prejudice to the challenge.

The Senate investigated the election and the Rules and Administration Committee voted along party lines on a report that it could not identify who won the election. The full Senate would have to decide how to proceed. Both candidates made their cases on the floor and nine Democrats voted along with all the Republicans to end the challenge and seat Bellmon. Although the Democratic Party had a 62–38 majority, seven Democrats were not in Washington and did not vote.

He did not run for a third term in 1980. During his service in the Senate, he sometimes took moderate positions that put him at odds with the largely conservative Oklahoma Republican Party: he supported Gerald Ford over Ronald Reagan in the 1976 presidential election (even though the state delegation was committed to Reagan); he opposed a constitutional amendment to prohibit forced busing for the purpose of racially desegregating public schools; and he supported the Panama Canal treaty.

In 1976, Bellmon was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame.

During his second term he was the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. He was a co-founder and co-chairman of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. He chose not to run for re-election in 1980 and was succeeded by Republican Don Nickles.

Bellmon was appointed the interim director of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services by Governor George Nigh, a Democrat, in 1982.

==Return to governorship==
As the tenures of Bellmon and his party colleague Bartlett had been followed by four terms of Democratic rule, Oklahoma Republican leaders asked him in 1986, if he would consider running for governor again. Bellmon agreed to run, and he narrowly won the election in November with 431,762 votes (47.5%) over David Walters (405,295; 44.5%). He served from January 12, 1987, to January 14, 1991. During his second tenure as governor he chaired the Southern States Energy Board.

During his second term, Bellmon worked with Democrats in the Oklahoma legislature to pass an educational reform package, House Bill 1017, over the opposition of most Republicans. Though the state constitution had been amended in 1966 to allow governors to succeed themselves, Bellmon chose not to seek reelection in 1990. He would have been eligible for a third term, since 8-year lifetime term limits were not enacted until 2010. The Republican candidate to replace him, Bill Price, promised to repeal HB 1017. However, Price was defeated by David Walters, whom Bellmon had defeated four years earlier.

===Death penalty===
Bellmon is notable for overseeing as governor both Oklahoma&#x27;s final pre-&quot;Furman&quot; execution, when James French was electrocuted in 1966, and its first post-&quot;Furman&quot;, when Charles Coleman was put to death by lethal injection in 1990.

==Later years==
Bellmon returned to his agriculture business interests. Bellmon also taught at Oklahoma City University, Central State University, Oklahoma State University, and the University of Oklahoma. Shirley Bellmon died in 2000; Bellmon married a longtime friend, Eloise Bollenbach, in 2002. A March 1, 2009, profile in &quot;The Oklahoman&quot; reported that he was living with Eloise in Kingfisher, Oklahoma; the article also reported that, despite suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and a heart ailment, Bellmon was still operating his family farm in Billings.

He was inducted into the Oklahoma CareerTech Hall of Fame posthumously in 2011.

==Death==
Bellmon died September 29, 2009, in Enid, Oklahoma, at the age of 88 after a long battle with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
He is buried at the Union Cemetery in Billings, Oklahoma.

==Henry Bellmon Sustainability Awards==

In 2009 Tulsa Southside Rotary Club and Sustainable Tulsa received permission from Bellmon&#x27;s daughters to name the Henry Bellmon Sustainability Awards after him.

<doc id="418268" wikidata="Q1887377" url="?curid=418268" title="Oving, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Oving (historically , more recently ) is a village and also a civil parish within Aylesbury Vale district in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located about three and a half miles north east of Waddesdon, four miles south of Winslow.

The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;Ufa&#x27;s people&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Olvonge&quot;, though previously it was known as &quot;Ulfingas&quot;. In manorial records in the 13th century it became known as &quot;Vuinges&quot;.

Oving was described in 1806 in &quot;Magna Britannia&quot; as follows:

OVING, in the hundred of Ashendon and deanery of Wendover, lies about six miles north-west of Aylesbury, and about a mile to the west of the road from that town to Buckingham. The manor of Oving was purchased, in 1735, of the family of Collins, by Francis Tyringham esq. after whose death it devolved to his elder sister Parnell, wife of Charles Pilsworth esq. M.P. for Aylesbury, who resided at Oving. Some time after Mr. Pilsworth&#x27;s death it was sold to the late Richard Hopkins esq. one of the lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and was bequeathed by him to Colonel Richard Northey, who has since taken the name of Hopkins in addition, and has now the rank of major-general. The manor-house being situated on the brow of a hill forms a conspicuous object in the vale of Aylesbury. Another manor in Oving has passed with North Marston, and is now held under Magdalen College, in Oxford, by Francis Wastie esq. The rectory is in the gift of the crown.

The small parish church is dedicated to &#x27;All Saints&#x27;. The village contains some attractive cottages especially in New Road.

The village has one public house known as &#x27;The Black Boy&#x27;, a quaint half-timbered construction under a tiled roof built c. 1524. The inn is situated in Church Lane opposite the village green.

The village is host to one of the oldest football cups the Oving Villages Cup, which started in 1889 and persists today on the recreation ground on Bowling Alley. The origins of this street name are unknown although it is believed by some locals that the name originates from farming terminology as a route by which cattle would travel through the village.

The village is very community based with schemes such as Neighbourhood watch in place and regular council meetings. Mother and toddler groups, reading clubs, walking groups and youth clubs create a sense cohesion and community spirit.

<doc id="418269" wikidata="Q16981502" url="?curid=418269" title="Fry sauce">
<text>Fry sauce is a condiment often served with French fries or tostones (twice-fried plantain slices) in many places in the world. It is usually a combination of one part tomato ketchup and two parts mayonnaise. 

==In the United States==

Although sauce composed of a mixture of equal parts ketchup and mayonnaise appears in a New Orleans cookbook published in 1900, fry sauce was popularized in Utah. The Utah origin is when Don Carlos Edwards used a pink sauce at his restaurant, Don Carlos Barbecue, sometime between 1941 and 1943. Edwards also used the pink sauce at the first Arctic Circle restaurant in Salt Lake City, Utah, which opened in 1950. The &quot;pink sauce&quot;, later became known as fry sauce. In his essay on Utah fry sauce, Michael P. Christensen noted that fry sauce &quot;functions as a cultural identifier for Utahns.&quot; The Arctic Circle chain still serves fry sauce in its western United States restaurants.

In April 2018, Heinz announced the release of &quot;Mayochup&quot;, a mixture of the two sauces, because 500,000+ users voted &quot;yes&quot; in a Twitter poll asking Americans if they wanted to see it in stores. A number of Twitter users responded that such a mixture already existed as &quot;fry sauce&quot; and &quot;fancy sauce&quot;. The sauce arrived at U.S. retailers&#x27; shelves in September 2018.

The sauce is also closely related to Yum Yum sauce, which is popular in Japanese steakhouses in America.

==Outside the United States==
In Argentina and Uruguay, a similar condiment known as &quot;&quot; (golf sauce) is a popular dressing for fries, burgers, steak sandwiches, and seafood salads. According to tradition, the sauce was invented by Luis Federico Leloir, a Nobel laureate and restaurant patron, at a golf club in Mar del Plata, Argentina, during the mid-1920s. 

In France, many Turkish restaurants and fast food establishments serve fry sauce and call it &#x27;; it is also common for customers to request &#x27; (a dab of mayonnaise and a dab of ketchup) alongside their French fries at such places. Both &quot;sauce cocktail&quot; and the Thousand Island dressing-like &quot;sauce cocktail&quot; can often be found in supermarkets.

In Germany, a popular product called &#x27; (red white) is sold in toothpaste-style tubes; it consists of unmixed ketchup and mayonnaise, which form a red-and-white striped string when squeezed out. Fries at restaurants are sometimes served with an equal mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise. This style of serving is often called &quot;Pommes Rot-Weiß&quot; or, colloquially &quot;Pommes Schranke&quot; (barrier gate) due to the red-and-white coloration of those. &#x27; or &#x27; (fry sauce) is a lightly spiced mayonnaise similar to the Dutch &#x27;. A condiment similar to the American fry sauce is known as &quot;, but it is more often used for döner kebab than for French fries.

In Iceland, a condiment similar to fry sauce called &quot; (cocktail sauce) is popular.

In the Philippines, a similar sauce is made by combining mayonnaise and banana ketchup. It is commonly used as a dipping sauce for fried food like french fries and cheese sticks (deep fried cheese wrapped in lumpia wrapper) but also for appetizers like &quot;lumpia&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, more specifically, London, this sauce is known as &quot;burger sauce&quot;, and is served in one of two ways:

* Premixed, similarly to the photos above;
* Separate, but together, similar to the Turkish &quot;&quot;. The ketchup is put in the container followed by the mayonnaise, and is mixed by hand by the consumer, using the desired foodstuffs to mix them together as it is dipped.

In Puerto Rico, &quot;mayokétchup&quot; is widely used with , sandwiches, burgers, and fried foods. It is made of equal parts of mayonnaise and ketchup with the addition of garlic.

In Japan, this sauce is known as &quot;aurora sauce&quot;. It is different from the sauce of the same name used in French cuisine.

In Russia, the mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise is known as “ketchunez”. In 2019, the local Heinz division launched a sauce with this name.

<doc id="418271" wikidata="Q5020785" url="?curid=418271" title="1994 California Proposition 187">
<text>California Proposition 187 (also known as the &quot;Save Our State&quot; (SOS) initiative) was a 1994 ballot initiative to establish a state-run citizenship screening system and prohibit illegal immigrants from using non-emergency health care, public education, and other services in the State of California. Voters passed the proposed law at a referendum on November 8, 1994. The law was challenged in a legal suit the day after its passage, and found unconstitutional by a federal district court on November 11. In 1999, Governor Gray Davis halted state appeals of this ruling.

Passage of Proposition 187 reflected state residents&#x27; concerns about illegal immigration into the United States. Opponents believed the law was motivated by bigotry against illegal immigrants of Hispanic or Asian origin; supporters maintained that their concerns were economic: that the state could not afford to provide social services for so many people who had entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas. The California Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Office later said that the cost of verification would be greater than any fiscal benefits of the ballot measure. As the state&#x27;s demographics have shifted to include more immigrants, the reversal of Proposition 187 has been cited as a reason for the decline of the California Republican Party.

==Background and passage==
In 1994, California had an estimated 1.3 million illegal immigrants. Some residents were increasingly concerned about the costs of providing services to the families of such illegal immigrants.

The Republican assemblyman Dick Mountjoy of Monrovia introduced Proposition 187 to the state legislature as the &quot;Save Our State&quot; (SOS) initiative. It gained enough signatures to be placed on the ballot as a statutory initiative during the general election on November 8, 1994. Originally one of several immigration reform bills placed before the California legislature in the early 1990s, polls surveying community responses showed that Proposition 187 began with widespread support—a 37-point lead in July 1994, and 62-29% lead among likely voters by September 1994. Proponents of the bill estimated that California spent $3 billion per year on services for illegal immigrants, about half of which provided education to children of illegal immigrants.

Governor Pete Wilson, a Republican, was a prominent supporter of Proposition 187, which ultimately became a key issue during his 1994 re-election campaign against Democratic opponent Kathleen Brown. After facing record low approval ratings during his first term, Wilson trailed Brown in opinion polls by more than 20% early during the gubernatorial campaign. Commentators considered his aggressive support of the Proposition 187 as crucial to his re-election. In the days leading up to the election, Wilson said that he would require all state and local government employees to report suspected illegal immigrants to the Attorney General&#x27;s Office if Proposition 187 passed. State Attorney General Dan Lungren, also running for re-election, agreed to enforce emergency regulations to implement the law immediately after the election.

During the United States Senate election in California, 1994 campaign, the incumbent Senator Dianne Feinstein and Republican challenger Michael Huffington both adopted tough policies against illegal immigration. The candidates each revealed that they had previously hired illegal immigrants for housekeeping and childcare. Unlike Feinstein, Huffington had hired a housekeeper who was an illegal immigrant after the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which made it illegal to knowingly hire illegal immigrants. Feinstein was narrowly re-elected.

President Bill Clinton urged Californians to reject Proposition 187 as an impediment to federal policy on immigration. After stating that &quot;it is not wrong for you Californians to want to reduce illegal immigration,&quot; Clinton asked voters to allow the federal government to &quot;keep working on what we&#x27;re doing.&quot; In November 1994, Clinton publicly criticized the ballot measure, stating that it “is not the answer” to the issues stemming from illegal immigration. In the days leading up to the ballot measure vote, Latino students organized large protests of Proposition 187 across the state, including a mass boycott of high schools. Their protests often included waving the Mexican flag, a controversial symbol that was described by opponents as counterproductive.

On November 8, 1994, California voters approved the proposition by a wide margin: 59% to 41%. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; exit polls, 63% of non-Hispanic white voters and 23% of Latino voters voted for Proposition 187; African-American and Asian voters were closely divided between those voting for and against the law. Although non-Hispanic whites comprised 57% of California&#x27;s population at the time, they represented 81% of voters in the 1994 general election. Latinos totaled 8% of voters, although they comprised 26% of the state&#x27;s population.

Among those who voted on the initiative, 78% of Republicans and 62% of independents voted for it, while 64% of Democrats opposed it.

Section 1 of Proposition 187 provides this introduction:

The People of California find and declare as follows:

That they have suffered and are suffering economic hardship caused by the presence of illegal aliens in this state. That they have suffered and are suffering personal injury and damage caused by the criminal conduct of illegal aliens in this state. That they have a right to the protection of their government from any person or persons entering this country unlawfully.
==Key elements of Proposition 187==
Proposition 187 included the following key elements:
# All law enforcement agents who suspect that a person who has been arrested is in violation of immigration laws must investigate the detainee&#x27;s immigration status, and if they find evidence of illegality they must report it to the attorney general of California, and to the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). They must also notify the detainee of his or her apparent status as an alien.
# Local governments are prohibited from preventing or limiting the fulfillment of this requirement.
# If government agents suspect anyone applying for benefits of being illegal immigrants, the agents must report their suspicions in writing to the appropriate enforcement authorities.
# People shall not receive any public social services until verified as a United States citizen or as a lawfully admitted alien.
# People shall not receive any health care services from a publicly funded health care facility until verified as a United States citizen or as a lawfully admitted alien.
# A public elementary or secondary school shall not admit or permit the attendance of any child until verified as a United States citizen or as a lawfully admitted alien.
# By 1996, each school district shall verify the legal status of each child enrolled within the district and the legal status of each parent or guardian of each child.
# A child who is in violation of the requirements above shall not continue to attend the school 90 days from the date of notice to the attorney general and INS.
# The attorney general must keep records on all such cases and make them available to any other government entity that wishes to inspect them.
# The manufacture, distribution, sale, or use of false citizenship or residency documents is a state felony punishable by imprisonment or fine.

==Opposition==

Activists on campuses, churches, and ethnic communities in California and across the country rallied to express opposition to Proposition 187. Critics argued that the measure was xenophobic and discriminated against ethnic minorities, especially those of Latino origin. Others were fearful that the costs of a state-run citizenship screening system and the potential loss of federal funds would off-set any savings of denying public benefits to unlawful residents. The day after the law was approved, an alliance of Latino and civil rights groups, including Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and American Civil Liberties Union, filed lawsuits against the measure in state court. Multiple local governments outside California, including the city of Denver, Colorado, threatened to boycott the state altogether. Latino organizations announced that they would not hold conventions in California and urged a boycott by their members and supporters of Disneyland, a major tourist attraction.

In the weeks leading up to the election, opponents of Proposition 187 led a series of demonstrations. These events gathered several thousands of people. One of the largest protests of the proposition, as well as one of the largest protests in Los Angeles history, was held on October 16, 1994, when an estimated 70,000 people marched through the downtown area. The line of demonstrators stretched at least a mile long. 2 weeks later, 7,000 people participated in another rally against Proposition 187 that took the form of a concert in which dozens of musicians and speakers performed. Young people, particularly Hispanic students, organized their own protests. Most often, these involved campus walkouts. Students as young as middle schoolers participated. In one of the largest student-led demonstrations against Proposition 187, more than 10,000 young people walked out from more than 30 campuses in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The protest was held without endorsement by any official groups; instead, students had been encouraged to stay in school and stage sit-ins as an alternative.

Due to Proposition 187&#x27;s statutes requiring children and their parents or legal guardians to prove their legal status, the California State Parent-Teacher Association joined in opposing the bill. The Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Gray Davis, who succeeded Wilson, campaigned against Proposition 187. Proposition 187 was widely supported by conservatives. However, some prominent conservatives, including former Congressman and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, former Secretary of Education William Bennett, and unsuccessful Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron Unz, publicly opposed the initiative. The Mexican president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, decried the law as xenophobic and harmful to the human rights of migrant laborers. One week after the bill was approved, Salinas proposed cross-border discussions to develop a &quot;guest worker&quot; program that would permit non-resident Mexicans to work legally in the United States. Such a program had been in place during World War II.

==Ethnic minority reactions==
Reactions against the proposition varied between and within different ethnic minority groups. Latino communities are cited as having been the most active; Hispanic students in particular were marked as they marched in the streets with Mexican flags. Some sources claim that this reaction might have caused indecisive voters to vote in favor of the proposition. After the election, Harold Ezell, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service Director who helped author Proposition 187, maintained that the &quot;biggest mistake the opposition made was waving those green and white flags with the snake on it. They should have been waving the American flag.&quot; When Hispanic students were criticized for waving Mexican flags during demonstrations in Los Angeles, community leaders responded to the controversy by saying that it was &quot;a symbolic clinging to self-pride&quot;. But some movement leaders did attempt to address these criticisms. As the election drew near, organizers sold thousands of American flags at their demonstrations against Proposition 187.

Asian communities in particular were divided, with an overall majority of 57% supporting the proposition. As the bill became more visible, some Asian communities became increasingly active politically, with the Los Angeles Times reporting &quot;massive organizing among California&#x27;s communities of color, particularly the Latino and Asian communities&quot;. In fact, the largest organized group in support of Proposition 187 in October 1994 was the Asian Americans for Border Control in Sylmar, which had only ten members. On the other hand, Chinese, Japanese, Cambodian, Thai and Korean alliances and coalitions banded to form the Asian Pacific Islanders Against Proposition 187 which consisted of hundreds of members. Significantly, many consider the strong reactions by some Asian voters against Proposition 187 to be the first time such numbers of Asian Americans had come together, with around 60 organizations joining forces.

==Legal challenges==
The constitutionality of Proposition 187 was challenged by several lawsuits. On November 11, 1994, three days after the bill&#x27;s passage, Federal Judge W. Matthew Byrne issued a temporary restraining order against institution of the measure, which was filed by State Attorney General Dan Lungren. After Judge Mariana Pfaelzer issued a permanent injunction of Proposition 187 in December 1994, blocking all provisions except those dealing with higher education and false documents, multiple cases were consolidated and brought before the federal court. In November 1997, Pfaelzer found the law to be unconstitutional on the basis that it infringed on the federal government&#x27;s exclusive jurisdiction over matters relating to immigration. Pfaelzer also explained that Proposition 187&#x27;s effect on the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, the congressional overhaul of the American welfare system, proved that the bill was a &quot;scheme&quot; to regulate immigration:

&quot;California is powerless to enact its own legislative scheme to regulate immigration. It is likewise powerless to enact its own legislative scheme to regulate alien access to public benefits.&quot; 
Governor Wilson appealed the ruling, which brought the case to the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. But in 1999, the newly elected Democratic Governor Gray Davis had the case brought before mediation. His administration withdrew the appeal before the courts in July 1999, effectively killing the law.

The unenforceable sections of Proposition 187 remained on the books until 2014. In September of that year, California passed a bill, SB 396, that removed those sections from California&#x27;s education, health and safety, and welfare codes, as a symbolic act after the overturn of Prop.187. Bill author Kevin de León said this &quot;closes a dark chapter in our state’s history, and brings dignity and respect to the national immigration debate.&quot;

==Legacy==
Noting a rapid increase in the number of Latinos voting in California elections, some analysts cite Wilson and the Republican Party&#x27;s embrace of Proposition 187 as a cause of the subsequent failure of the party to win statewide elections. A 2006 study published in the &quot;American Journal of Political Science&quot; found that Republican support of Proposition 187 and 2 later state ballot initiatives—Proposition 209 in 1996, which ended affirmative action at governmental institutions, and Proposition 227 in 1998, which limited bilingual education in public schools—shifted both white and Latino voters in California away from identifying with the Republican Party and toward the Democratic Party. The authors of the study said that the &quot;results raise serious questions about the long-term efficacy of racially divisive strategies for electoral gain.&quot; Studies published in 2001 and 2011 also show that Proposition 187 mobilized Hispanic voters for the Democratic Party. A 2016 article by pro-immigration researcher Alex Nowrasteh came to the same conclusion. However, a 2018 study questioned the conventional wisdom that Proposition 187 led to an abrupt realignment in Latino voters&#x27; political preferences.

Conservative group Eagle Forum instead argues that immigration, whether legal or not, made California&#x27;s electorate more liberal. Fred Bauer of &quot;National Review&quot; concurs, adding that Democrats have usually controlled both branches of the California state legislature since the 1960s and that the Democratic Party has had consistently strong support among both white and Hispanic voters in California. Bill Whalen, a former aide to Wilson, in an article for &quot;Forbes&quot;, noted that Proposition 187 was popular among voters and that Republican struggles in California are partly due to women gradually moving away from the party for other reasons, particularly reproductive rights. Whalen also cited Schwarzenegger&#x27;s reelection as governor in 2006, in which he won 39% of the votes cast by Latinos, as evidence that Proposition 187 did not harm Republicans&#x27; chances of being elected in California. Writing after Schwarzenegger&#x27;s 2003 recall election victory, Debra J. Saunders of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; noted that he won the election despite voting for Proposition 187, which other publications had claimed would seriously jeopardize his bid.

Between 1995 and 2004 the following states passed similar ballot initiatives or laws: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma and Texas.

During Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, his use of &quot;anti-immigrant tactics&quot; drew comparisons from media members to Wilson and California Proposition 187. Seema Mehta of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Many have had a visceral reaction to Trump&#x27;s proposals that include deporting 11 million people and building an enormous border wall. Protests greet Trump whenever he holds rallies in California.&quot;

<text>Emma Lazarus (July 22, 1849 – November 19, 1887) was an American author of poetry, prose, and translations, as well as an activist for Jewish and Georgist causes. She is remembered for writing the sonnet &quot;The New Colossus&quot;, which was inspired by the Statue of Liberty, in 1883. Its lines appear inscribed on a bronze plaque, installed in 1903, on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. Lazarus was involved in aiding refugees to New York who had fled antisemitic pogroms in eastern Europe, and she saw a way to express her empathy for these refugees in terms of the statue. The last lines of the sonnet were set to music by Irving Berlin as the song &quot;Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor&quot; for the 1949 musical &quot;Miss Liberty&quot;, which was based on the sculpting of the Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;). The latter part of the sonnet was also set by Lee Hoiby in his song &quot;The Lady of the Harbor&quot; written in 1985 as part of his song cycle &quot;Three Women&quot;.

Lazarus was also the author of &quot;Poems and Translations&quot; (New York, 1867); &quot;Admetus, and other Poems&quot; (1871); &quot;Alide: An Episode of Goethe&#x27;s Life&quot; (Philadelphia, 1874); &quot;Poems and Ballads of Heine&quot; (New York, 1881); &quot;Poems, 2 Vols.&quot;; &quot;Narrative, Lyric and Dramatic&quot;; as well as &quot;Jewish Poems and Translations&quot;.

==Early years and education==
Emma Lazarus was born in New York City, July 22, 1849, into a large Jewish family. She was the fourth of seven children of Moses Lazarus, a wealthy merchant and sugar refiner, and Esther Nathan (of a long-established German-Jewish New York family). One of her great-grandfathers on the Lazarus side was from Germany; the rest of her Lazarus ancestors were originally from Portugal and they were among the original twenty-three Portuguese Jews who arrived in New Amsterdam after they fled Recife, Brazil in an attempt to flee from the Inquisition. Lazarus&#x27;s great-great-grandmother on her mother&#x27;s side, Grace Seixas Nathan (born in Stratford, Connecticut, in 1752) was also a poet. Lazarus was related through her mother to Benjamin N. Cardozo, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Her siblings included sisters Josephine, Sarah, Mary, Agnes and Annie, and a brother, Frank.

Privately educated by tutors from an early age, she studied American and British literature as well as several languages, including German, French, and Italian. She was attracted in youth to poetry, writing her first lyrics when she was eleven years old.

==Career==
===Writer===

The first stimulus for Lazarus&#x27;s writing was offered by the American Civil War. A collection of her &quot;Poems and Translations&quot;, verses written between the ages of fourteen and seventeen, appeared in 1867 (New York), and was commended by William Cullen Bryant. It included translations from Friedrich Schiller, Heinrich Heine, Alexandre Dumas, and Victor Hugo. &quot;Admetus and Other Poems&quot; followed in 1871. The title poem was dedicated &quot;To my friend Ralph Waldo Emerson&quot;, whose works and personality were exercising an abiding influence upon the poet&#x27;s intellectual growth. During the next decade, in which &quot;Phantasies&quot; and &quot;Epochs&quot; were written, her poems appeared chiefly in &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; and &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;.

By this time, Lazarus&#x27;s work had won recognition abroad. Her first prose production, &quot;Alide: An Episode of Goethe&#x27;s Life&quot;, a romance treating of the Friederike Brion incident, was published in 1874 (Philadelphia), and was followed by &quot;The Spagnoletto&quot; (1876), a tragedy. &quot;Poems and Ballads of Heinrich Heine&quot; (New York, 1881) followed, and was prefixed by a biographical sketch of Heine; Lazarus&#x27;s renderings of some of Heine&#x27;s verse are considered among the best in English. In the same year, 1881, she became friends with Rose Hawthorne Lathrop. In April 1882, Lazarus published in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; the article &quot;Was the Earl of Beaconsfield a Representative Jew?&quot; Her statement of the reasons for answering this question in the affirmative may be taken to close what may be termed the Hellenic and journeyman period of Lazarus&#x27;s life, during which her subjects were drawn from classic and romantic sources.

Lazarus also wrote &quot;The Crowing of the Red Cock&quot;, and the sixteen-part cycle poem &quot;Epochs&quot;. In addition to writing her own poems, Lazarus edited many adaptations of German poems, notably those of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Heinrich Heine. She also wrote a novel and two plays in five acts, &quot;The Spagnoletto&quot;, a tragic verse drama about the titular figure and &quot;The Dance to Death&quot;, a dramatization of a German short story about the burning of Jews in Nordhausen during the Black Death. During the time Lazarus became interested in her Jewish roots, she continued her purely literary and critical work in magazines with such articles as &quot;Tommaso Salvini&quot;, &quot;Salvini&#x27;s &#x27;King Lear, &quot;Emerson&#x27;s Personality&quot;, &quot;Heine, the Poet&quot;, &quot;A Day in Surrey with William Morris&quot;, and others.

Lines from her sonnet &quot;The New Colossus&quot; appear on a bronze plaque which was placed in the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty in 1903. The sonnet was written in 1883 and donated to an auction, conducted by the &quot;Art Loan Fund Exhibition in Aid of the Bartholdi Pedestal Fund for the Statue of Liberty&quot; in order to raise funds to build the pedestal. Lazarus&#x27;s close friend Rose Hawthorne Lathrop was inspired by &quot;The New Colossus&quot; to found the Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne.

She traveled twice to Europe, first in 1883 and again from 1885 to 1887. On one of those trips, Georgiana Burne-Jones, the wife of the Pre-Raphaelite painter Edward Burne-Jones, introduced her to William Morris at her home. She also met with Henry James, Robert Browning and Thomas Huxley during her European travels. A collection of &quot;Poems in Prose&quot; (1887) was her last book. Her &quot;Complete Poems with a Memoir&quot; appeared in 1888, at Boston.

===Activism===
Lazarus was a friend and admirer of the American political economist Henry George. She believed deeply in Georgist economic reforms and became active in the &quot;single tax&quot; movement for land value tax. Lazarus published a poem in the &quot;New York Times&quot; named after George&#x27;s book, &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;.

Lazarus became more interested in her Jewish ancestry as she heard of the Russian pogroms that followed the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881. As a result of this anti-Semitic violence, and the poor standard of living in Russia in general, thousands of destitute Ashkenazi Jews emigrated from the Russian Pale of Settlement to New York. Lazarus began to advocate on behalf of indigent Jewish immigrants. She helped establish the Hebrew Technical Institute in New York to provide vocational training to assist destitute Jewish immigrants to become self-supporting. Lazarus volunteered as well in the Hebrew Emigrant Aid Society employment bureau, although she eventually criticized its organization. In 1883, she founded the Society for the Improvement and Colonization of East European Jews.

The literary fruits of identification with her religion were poems like &quot;The Crowing of the Red Cock&quot;, &quot;The Banner of the Jew&quot;, &quot;The Choice&quot;, &quot;The New Ezekiel&quot;, &quot;The Dance to Death&quot; (a strong, though unequally executed drama), and her last published work (March 1887), &quot;By the Waters of Babylon: Little Poems in Prose&quot;, which constituted her strongest claim to a foremost rank in American literature. During the same period (1882–87), Lazarus translated the Hebrew poets of medieval Spain with the aid of the German versions of Michael Sachs and Abraham Geiger, and wrote articles, signed and unsigned, upon Jewish subjects for the Jewish press, besides essays on &quot;Bar Kochba&quot;, &quot;Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&quot;, &quot;M. Renan and the Jews&quot;, and others for Jewish literary associations. Several of her translations from medieval Hebrew writers found a place in the ritual of American synagogues. 

Lazarus&#x27;s most notable series of articles was that titled &quot;An Epistle to the Hebrews&quot; (&quot;The American Hebrew&quot;, November 10, 1882 – February 24, 1883), in which she discussed the Jewish problems of the day, urged a technical and a Jewish education for Jews, and ranged herself among the advocates of an independent Jewish nationality and of Jewish repatriation in Palestine. Some scholars consider her to be one of the forerunners of Zionism. The only collection of poems issued during this period was &quot;Songs of a Semite: The Dance to Death and Other Poems&quot; (New York, 1882), dedicated to the memory of George Eliot.

==Death and legacy==
Lazarus returned to New York City seriously ill after she completed her second trip to Europe, and she died two months later, on November 19, 1887, most likely from Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. She never married. Lazarus was buried in Beth Olam Cemetery in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn. &quot;The Poems of Emma Lazarus&quot; (2 vols., Boston and New York, 1889) was published after her death, comprising most of her poetic work from previous collections, periodical publications, and some of the literary heritage which her executors deemed appropriate to preserve for posterity. Her papers are kept by the American Jewish Historical Society, Center for Jewish History, and her letters are collected at Columbia University.

The Emma Lazarus Federation of Jewish Women&#x27;s Clubs, founded in 1951, was named after Lazarus.

A stamp featuring the Statue of Liberty and Lazarus&#x27;s poem &quot;The New Colossus&quot; was issued by Antigua and Barbuda in 1985. In 1992, she was named as a Women&#x27;s History Month Honoree by the National Women&#x27;s History Project. Lazarus was honored by the Office of the Manhattan Borough President in March 2008, and her home on West 10th Street was included on a map of Women&#x27;s Rights Historic Sites. In 2009, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. The Museum of Jewish Heritage featured an exhibition about Lazarus in 2012. The Emma Lazarus Art and Music Venue, as well as a park are named in her honor in Carrick, a refugee-friendly neighborhood in the Carrick, a neighborhood on the South Side of the City of Pittsburgh.

Biographer Esther Schor praised Lazarus&#x27; lasting contribution:

The irony is that the statue goes on speaking, even when the tide turns against immigration — even against immigrants themselves, as they adjust to their American lives. You can&#x27;t think of the statue without hearing the words Emma Lazarus gave her.
==Style and themes==
Lazarus contributed toward shaping the self-image of the United States as well as how the country understands the needs of those who immigrated to the United States. Her themes produced sensitivity and enduring lessons regarding immigrants and their need for dignity. What was needed to make her a poet of the people as well as one of literary merit was a great theme, the establishment of instant communication between some stirring reality and her still hidden and irresolute subjectivity. Such a theme was provided by the immigration of Russian Jews to America, consequent upon the proscriptive May Laws of 1882. She rose to the defense of her ethnic compatriots in powerful articles, as contributions to &quot;The Century&quot; (May 1882 and February 1883). Hitherto, her life had held no Jewish inspiration. Though of Sephardic ancestry, and ostensibly Orthodox in belief, her family had till then not participated in the activities of the synagogue or of the Jewish community. Contact with the unfortunates from Russia led her to study the Torah, the Hebrew language, Judaism, and Jewish history. While her early poetry demonstrated no Jewish themes, her &quot;Songs of a Semite&quot; (1882) is considered to be the earliest volume of Jewish American poetry.

A review of &quot;Alide&quot; by &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; was critical of Lazarus&#x27;s style and elements of technique.

<text>The black-and-white warbler (Mniotilta varia) is a species of New World warbler, and the only member of its genus, Mniotilta. 
It breeds in northern and eastern North America and winters in Florida, Central America, and the West Indies down to Peru. This species is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

Relative to other New World warblers, it is not well studied.

== Description ==
The black-and-white warbler is to in length with a mass of to grams. Wingspan ranges from 7.1 to 8.7 in (18–22 cm).

True to their name, black-and-white warblers are black and white in colour. Both sexes have black and white crowns with a white eyebrow, black streaking on a white belly, black wings with two white wing bars, a black tail, a black-and-white streaked back, streaky undertail coverts, and grey-black legs and feet. Breeding males have a black-and-white streaked throat and black cheek, while females have a grey cheek and a white-cream coloured throat and sides. First fall males are very similar to adult females in colour and patterning, while first fall females resemble adult females but with less streaking and a more noticeable buffy wash. Juveniles are heavily spotted, but are similar to first fall individuals otherwise.

This species is long and weighs . The summer male black-and-white warbler is boldly streaked in black and white, and the bird has been described as a flying humbug. Each wing is black with two white wing bars. Female and juvenile plumages are similar, but duller and less streaky than males.

This warbler can be confused with the blackpoll warbler (&quot;Setophaga striata&quot;). The blackpoll warbler is also black and white in its summer plumage, but has a solid black cap. The black-and-white warbler can also be confused behaviourally with the pine warbler (&quot;Setophaga pinus&quot;) and yellow-throated warbler (&quot;Setophaga dominica&quot;).

== Taxonomy ==
Linnaeus described the black-and-white warbler (&quot;Mniotilta varia&quot;) in 1766. This warbler is a species of New World warbler or wood warbler (family Parulidae), and is the only member of its genus due to its unique foraging adaptations.

It is known to hybridize with the cerulean warbler (&quot;Setophaga cerulea&quot;) and Blackburnian warbler (&quot;Setophaga fusca&quot;). However, it is not closely related to the genus &quot;Setophaga&quot;.

No subspecies are known.

=== Etymology ===
The genus name comes from the Ancient Greek , meaning &quot;seaweed&quot;, and , &quot;to pluck&quot;. Vieillot mistranslated the first word, as &quot;moss&quot;. The specific &quot;varia&quot; is from the Latin , meaning &quot;variegated&quot;.

== Habitat and distribution ==
The black-and-white warbler is a migratory species, breeding in North America and wintering in North and South America. It is typically found in deciduous forest in its breeding range, but becomes more of a habitat generalist in the non-breeding season.

=== Habitat ===
The black-and-white warbler occupies a broad niche, and is found in a variety of habitats.

In its breeding habitat, it prefers mature forest, but will occupy successional and second growth forest. Preferred forest types include deciduous and mixed forest, and this warbler sometimes occupies swampy forest.

During migration, this species prefers forest to other land cover types and is frequently found in riparian areas.

In its wintering habitat, it can be found in a variety of land cover types, from mangroves to wet, dry, and cloud forest. It occupies both successional and mature forest. It has also been noted to winter in shade coffee plantations and gardens.

Males are territorial in both their summer and winter habitats.

=== Distribution ===
The black-and-white warbler breeds in northern and eastern North America. It ranges from the Northwest Territories to the northwest and Newfoundland and Labrador to the northeast, to North Carolina to the southeast and Texas to the southwest. This species is migratory, wintering in Florida, Central America, the West Indies and northern South America down to Peru. The IUCN estimates the extent of occurrence, or range, to be 11,500,000 km2.

This species occurs as a vagrant in Iceland, Ireland, Faeroes, and the UK.

== Conservation status ==
The IUCN classifies the black-and-white warbler as Least Concern due to its large range and population size. However, its population is decreasing. Habitat loss and degradation, especially forest fragmentation, are the main factors contributing to the species&#x27; decline. If habitat loss continues, in either or both summer or wintering habitat, the species may continue to decline in the future. Pesticides such as fenitrothion and phosphamidon have contributed to the species&#x27; decline in the 1970s, and others such as chlorinated hydrocarbons may continue to have an effect.

== Behaviour ==
=== Vocalization ===
The black-and-white warbler has a high-pitched song, described as a repeating that is repeated at least six times in succession. It has a &quot;chip&quot; call as well as a call that is sometimes given in flight&quot;.&quot;
Its song is a high or . It has two calls, a hard and a soft, thin .

=== Diet ===
This bird feeds on insects and spiders, and, unlike other warblers, forages like a nuthatch, moving up and down tree trunks and along branches.

The black-and-white warbler feeds in a manner similar to a nuthatch or a creeper. It forages on tree trunks and limbs to feed on insects below the bark&#x27;s surface. Its short legs and long hind toe are adaptations to this foraging method. The black-and-white warbler is unique among warblers in its time spent foraging on tree trunks and inner branches. This bird also gleans, like many warblers, for insects. Its diet is composed of insects and other arthropods, including lepidopteran larvae, beetles, ants, and spiders. During migration and breeding, this warbler relies heavily on lepidopteran larvae.

During migration, the black-and-white warbler sometimes joins mixed flocks to feed.

=== Reproduction ===
It breeds in broadleaved or mixed forest, preferably in wetter areas. Black-and-white warblers nest on the ground, laying four or five eggs in a cup nest.

The black-and-white warbler is of the first warblers to arrive to its spring breeding grounds. In the southernmost range of its breeding habitat, it can begin breeding mid-April. Males are territorial and defend their territory, both by singing and chasing competitors away. When a female arrives in a male&#x27;s territory, he pursues her in an effort to breed. The male may display by flapping his wings.

The nest is cup-shaped, often located on the ground among roots or against a tree, or in crevices on tree stumps. The species prefers to nest in damp areas. The nest is constructed with grassy material, bark, and dry leaves, and lined with softer material such as moss and hair. The female is responsible for most of the nest-building. The female lays four or five eggs, which are light brown and speckled with darker brown. The female begins incubating once the last or second-to-last egg is laid. Incubation lasts 10 to 12 days, and is done solely by the female. During incubation, the female is sometimes fed by the male.

Both parents care for the nestlings. The young fledge after 8 to 12 days, and stay around the nest while they improve their flight ability. During this time, the parents remain nearby.

This species generally produces one brood per year.

Black-and-white warbler nests are sometimes parasitized by the brown-headed cowbird (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;).

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, a  locomotive has two leading wheels on one axle, usually in a Bissel truck, ten coupled driving wheels on five axles, and four trailing wheels on two axles, usually in a bogie. These were referred to as the Texas type in most of the United States, the Colorado type on the Burlington Route, and the Selkirk type in Canada.

==Overview==
The Texas wheel arrangement originated and was principally used in the United States. The evolution of this locomotive type began as a Santa Fe type with a larger four-wheeled trailing truck that would allow an enlarged firebox. A subsequent development was as an elongated Berkshire type that required extra driving wheels to remain within axle load limits. Examples of both of these evolutionary progressions can be found.

Some tank locomotives also existed in eastern Europe. One extraordinary experimental tender locomotive, built in the Soviet Union, had an opposed-piston drive system.

==Usage==

===Belgian Congo===

The Texas type was rare in Africa. One locomotive, numbered 801, was built for the CF du Bas-Congo au Katanga by Société Anonyme John Cockerill in 1939. It had cylinders and diameter driving wheels, with a working order mass of , a grate area of , and a tractive effort at 65% boiler pressure of . The locomotive is believed to have been built for the line between Bukama and Kamina and accumulated during its service lifetime. Even with its large size, it was hand-fired and had two firebox doors, with two firemen being carried.

===Brazil===
Outside North America, the was rare. In South America, the Central Railway of Brazil ordered 17 locomotives, 10 from Baldwin, which were delivered in 1940, and another seven from the American Locomotive Company, which were delivered in 1947.

===Canada===
The Canadian Pacific (CP) Selkirk locomotives were all built by Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW). The first 20 of these large engines were built in 1929, designated T1a class and allocated numbers 5900 to 5919. Their Canadian type name was after the Selkirk Mountains across which they were placed in service, the railway summit of which was located just inside the western portal of the Connaught Tunnel beneath Rogers Pass.
MLW built another 10 of these successful locomotives for CP during November and December 1938, designated T1b class and numbered from 5920 to 5929. Modifications to the original design led to the T1b being 10 tonnes lighter while its operating steam pressure was increased from .

A further six Selkirks, classed T1c and numbered from 5930 to 5935, were delivered by MLW in 1949. They were the last standard gauge steam locomotives to be built in Canada for a Canadian railway. These were very similar to the T1b class, apart from a few refinements, which included two cross-compound air compressors to speed up recharging of the air brake system, while some small streamlining touches were not retained, such as the streamlined casing around the smokebox stack and the teardrop shape of the classification lights. In addition, the insides of the cabs were no longer insulated in the same manner as the previous versions, which had provided better cold-weather cab insulation and were better liked by crews. The last Selkirks were taken out of service in 1959. These were the most powerful steam locomotives in the British Empire.

=== Japan ===
In 1948, the JGR built five Class E10 tank locomotives for the purpose of supplementing the aging Class 4110 (0-10-0) in Itaya Pass on the Ou Main Line for a short time until electrification. E10 2 is statically stored.

===South Africa===

In 1937, the South African Railways (SAR) placed one 2-10-4 Class 21 steam locomotive in service, designed for mixed traffic and suitable for light rail. It was designed by A.G. Watson, chief mechanical engineer of the SAR from 1929 to 1936, and built by the North British Locomotive Company in Glasgow. It was the only example built, and represented the maximum power obtainable on Cape gauge from a non-articulated locomotive limited to a axle load and rail. In order to negotiate tight curves, the third and fourth sets of coupled wheels were flangeless.

The locomotive&#x27;s Type FT tender was an experimental type using six pairs of wheels in a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with the leading and trailing wheels as bissel-type pony trucks and the remainder mounted on a rigid wheelbase. A similar Type JV tender had been built in the Salt River shops in Cape Town in 1936 as a prototype to the Type FT. The wheel arrangement was not very successful however, and not used again.

===Soviet Union===
Two Texas-type locomotives were built in the USSR. One, the class OR23, built in 1949 by the locomotive works in Ulan Ude, had cylinders that were placed above the center driving axle. Unlike nearly all steam locomotives, the pistons had rods on both ends, which transferred power to the wheels. The idea was to balance the driving forces on the wheels, allowing the counterweights on the wheels to be smaller and reducing hammer blow on the track. Test runs showed, however, that the OR23 design was unsuitable as a practical locomotive. The locomotive was never used for more than testing and was returned to its builder and scrapped.

===United States===

====Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway====
The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) took delivery of locomotive No. 3829 from the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1919. It was used by ATSF as an experimental locomotive and was rostered as a member of ATSF&#x27;s 3800 class of 2-10-2s that was fitted with a four-wheel trailing truck. Nearly 100 more 3800 class locomotives were delivered after No. 3829, but all with the 2-10-2 wheel arrangement. Photographs exist that show No. 3829 fitted with at least two different designs of four-wheel trailing truck through the years. No other members of the 3800 class have been documented with four-wheel trailing trucks. No. 3829 was scrapped in 1955, still equipped with a four-wheel trailing truck.

Santa Fe, which had originated the type, adopted it again in 1930 with No. 5000, named &quot;Madame Queen&quot;. This locomotive was similar to the C&amp;O T-1, with the same drivers, but with boiler pressure and 60% limited cutoff. It proved the viability of the type on the ATSF, but the Great Depression shelved plans to acquire more.

In 1938, with the railroad&#x27;s fortunes improving, ATSF acquired 10 more locomotives. These came with diameter drivers and boiler pressure, making these ATSF s the fastest and most modern of all.

Of the original order of ten, five were oil-burning and five coal-burning, but when Santa Fe ordered 25 more for delivery in 1944, all were delivered equipped to burn oil. The first of the 1944 batch produced on road test, the highest figure known for a two-cylinder steam locomotive.

====Texas and Pacific====
The type was revived in 1925 by the Lima Locomotive Works. This time, it was an expansion of the Berkshire type that Lima had pioneered. A version of the Berkshire with 10 driving wheels instead of eight was an obvious development and the first to be delivered were to the Texas and Pacific Railway, after which the type was subsequently named. The four-wheel trailing truck allowed a much larger firebox, thus a greater ability to generate heat, and thus steam. The &quot;Superpower&quot; design, as Lima&#x27;s marketing department called it, resulted in a locomotive that could develop great power at speed while not running out of steam-generating ability.

====Bessemer and Lake Erie====
Baldwin built a fleet of 47 H-1 class 2-10-4s for the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad, an iron ore–hauling railroad, between 1929 and 1944, in eight subclasses numbered 601–647. Calculated tractive force was , average weight was over , and boiler pressure was . Eighteen were sold in 1951 to the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway, another ore-hauling railroad, that renumbered them 700–717. By the beginning of the 1960s, all but one were sold for scrap. The exception was No. 643, which almost operated in excursion service in the late 1990s, but for its large size. It is now owned by the Age of Steam Roundhouse.

====Chesapeake and Ohio====
The early Lima-built Texas types were low-drivered, in diameter, which did not leave enough space to fully counterweight the extremely heavy and sturdy side rods and main rods required for such a powerful locomotive&#x27;s piston thrusts. That changed in 1930 on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O), which stretched the design of an Erie Railroad high-drivered Berkshire type locomotive to produce 40 of the , a Texas type with diameter drivers that was both powerful and fast enough for the new higher-speed freight services that the railroads were introducing. All subsequent Texas types were of this higher-drivered sort.

====Chicago Great Western Railway====
The Chicago Great Western Railway was an unusual customer for 2-10-4s as it was a &#x27;granger&#x27; railroad, operating in the predominantly flat Midwestern United States. Traffic was overwhelmingly agricultural in nature, with few fast freights or express passenger services. By the end of the 1920s the CGW had few especially large locomotives on its roster, having quickly given up a brief experiment with Mallet types. The largest types in traffic were USRA Light Mikados and most trains were handled by 2-8-0 locomotives - with multiple engines per train on the CGW&#x27;s isolated steep valley grades. 

With the arrival of the Great Depression and its locomotive fleet ageing, the CGW chose a major upgrade with 2-10-4 locomotives, ordering 36 shared between Lima and Baldwin. They arrived into service during 1930 in three batches, which differed in detail but were to the same fundamental design. All had 63&quot; diameter drivers, 29&quot; x 32&quot; cylinders and a 255 psi boiler pressure - the same basic specification as the successful Texas &amp; Pacific fleet of 2-10-4s.

The 2-10-4s allowed the CGW to dramatically improve its operational efficiency - trains could be heavier yet faster and double heading and banking was eliminated in many locations. Fewer trains hauling more tonnage allowed the railroad to cut many jobs, so the new big locomotives were not well-received by employees. Being much heavier than previous CGW locomotives the 2-10-4s were barred from certain parts of the CGW system with lightly-laid track (they could not cross the bridge over the Missouri at Leavenworth, Kansas, for instance, and so could not work trains through to the CGW yard at Kansas City). Freight trains hauled by the 2-10-4s had to be given priority over passenger trains at certain points because sidings were too lightly-laid to handle the heavy locomotives. The CGW carried out a programme of relaying key sections of track with heavier rail in the mid-1930s to properly handle the 2-10-4s and in doing so became the first American railroad to install continuous welded rail. The 2-10-4s promoted a new way of working on the CGW, which adopted a principle of fewer but much longer and heavier trains - a practice usually seen on transcontinental railroads in the West rather than granger routes in the prairies. The CGW continued this principle after dieselization in the late 1940s, which saw all the 2-10-4s withdrawn between 1948 and 1950. 

====Pennsylvania Railroad====
The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) ordered few new locomotives after 1930, since electrification both consumed the railroad&#x27;s resources and resulted in a supply of excess steam locomotives that eliminated any requirement for new power. Until the Second World War had begun, the PRR&#x27;s locomotive fleet had not begun to appear inadequate. Although the PRR urgently needed new and modern freight power, the War Production Board prohibited working on a new design, and not enough time remained to trial a prototype in any event, the PRR cast around for other railroads&#x27; designs that it might modify for PRR use.

It settled on the . Some modifications were made to the design for these PRR &quot;War Babies&quot;. These included PRR drop-couplers, sheet-steel pilots, PRR-style cabs, large PRR tenders, Keystone-shaped number plates up front, and other modifications. It still betrayed its foreign heritage by lacking the PRR trademark Belpaire firebox and by having a booster engine on the trailing truck. Altogether, 125 locomotives were built between 1942 and 1944 and became the largest fleet of Texas-type locomotives in existence. All were eventually sold as scrap when the Pennsylvania Railroad converted to diesel.

<doc id="418289" wikidata="Q485921" url="?curid=418289" title="Military Assistance Command, Vietnam">
<text>The U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) was a joint-service command of the United States Department of Defense, composed of forces from the United States Army, United States Navy, and United States Air Force, as well as their respective special operations forces.

MACV was created on 8 February 1962, in response to the increase in United States military assistance to South Vietnam. MACV was implemented to assist and oversee the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) Vietnam while the Viet Cong insurgency was under way. It was reorganized on 15 May 1964 and absorbed MAAG Vietnam when the deployment of combat units became too large for the advisory group to control.

General Paul D. Harkins was the first commanding general of MACV (COMUSMACV), and was previously the commander of MAAG Vietnam. After reorganization he was succeeded by General William Westmoreland in June 1964, followed by General Creighton W. Abrams (July 1968) and General Frederick C. Weyand (June 1972).

MACV was disestablished on 29 March 1973 and replaced by the Defense Attaché Office (DAO), Saigon. The DAO performed many of the same roles of MACV within the restrictions imposed by the Paris Peace Accords until the Fall of Saigon.

==Establishment and growth==
Admiral Harry D. Felt, Commander-in-Chief, Pacific, established the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, on 8 February 1962, as a subordinate unified command under his control. Lieutenant General Paul D. Harkins, the Deputy Commander in Chief, U.S. Army, Pacific, who, as the commander-designate for the task force headquarters (HQ) in the event of operations in Southeast Asia, had participated in the planning for such operations, was appointed commander and promoted to general. 

Harkins became the senior U.S. military commander in South Vietnam and responsible for U.S. military policy, operations and assistance there. Harkins had the task of advising the South Vietnamese government on security, organization, and employment of their military and paramilitary forces. As provided for in the organization of the task force headquarters in the contingency plans, MACV&#x27;s commander was also his own Army component commander. With an initial authorized strength of 216 men (113 Army), MACV was envisaged as a temporary HQ that would be withdrawn once the Viet Cong insurgency was brought under control. In that event, the Military Assistance Advisory Group would be restored to its former position as the principal U.S. headquarters in South Vietnam. For this reason, the MAAG was retained as a separate headquarters.

In March 1962 Headquarters, United States Army Pacific, removed the &quot;provisional&quot; designation from the U.S. Army Support Group, Vietnam, attached it to United States Army Ryukyu Islands for administrative and logistical support, and made its commanding officer the deputy Army component commander under MACV. All U.S. Army units in South Vietnam, excluding advisory attachments, were assigned to the Army Support Group for administrative and logistical needs. Over the course of 1962 U.S. military strength in South Vietnam rose from about 1,000 to over 11,000 personnel. Each service continued to provide its own logistical support.

Throughout 1963 the duties of the U.S. Army Support Group steadily increased, particularly regarding to combat support activities and logistics. During the year, the U.S. buildup continued, especially in aviation, communications, intelligence, special warfare and logistic units, reaching a total of 17,068 men, of which 10,916 were Army. Because of this expansion, the commanding general, General Joseph Warren Stilwell Jr. late in 1963 proposed that the name of the support group be changed to U.S. Army Support Command, Vietnam. Harkins concurred and General James Francis Collins, commander of United States Army, Pacific and Admiral Felt approved the redesignation. The new designation went into effect on 1 March 1964.

MACV was reorganized on 15 May 1964, and absorbed MAAG Vietnam within it, when combat unit deployment became too large for advisory group control. A Naval Advisory Group was established and the Commanding General, 2nd Air Division, became MACV&#x27;s Air Force component commander. That year the U.S. strength in Vietnam grew from about 16,000 men (10,716 Army) to about 23,300 (16,000 Army) in 1964. Logistic support operations were highly fragmented. As a result, the 1st Logistics Command was established.

Large scale combat deployments began when the 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade was deployed in the Da Nang area from March 1965. When the III Marine Amphibious Force moved to Da Nang on 6 May 1965, its commanding general, Major General William R. Collins, was designated MACV&#x27;s naval component commander. In May 1965, the Army&#x27;s 173d Airborne Brigade from Okinawa arrived. In July 1965, in response to the growing size of U.S. Army forces in the country, United States Army, Vietnam was established, and both the 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division as well as the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, deployed from the United States. 

The brigade from the 101st Airborne Division was originally planned to replace the 173d Airborne Brigade but, with the need for additional combat forces, both brigades remained in South Vietnam. Two months later, the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), recently reorganized from an infantry formation, reported in country, and the rest of the 1st Infantry Division arrived in October.

Two corps-level HQs were established in 1965-66, Task Force Alpha (soon to become I Field Force, Vietnam) for U.S. forces in the II Corps Tactical Zone and II Field Force, Vietnam, for U.S. Army forces in the III Corps Tactical Zone. The 5th Special Forces Group was also established in-country by 1965. A brigade of the 25th Infantry Division arrived in late 1965, with the 4th Infantry Division deploying between August and November 1966.
The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment was alerted for assignment to Southeast Asia on 11 March 1966.

In April 1967, General Westmoreland, who had arrived in June 1964 as Commander of MACV, organized a division-sized blocking force along the border between North and South Vietnam. The deployment of a division-sized U.S. Army force would allow the 1st Marine Division to move north, to provide greater support for the 3rd Marine Division in the northern portion of the I Corps Tactical Zone. Designated as Task Force Oregon, it included the 196th Infantry Brigade; the 3rd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division at Chu Lai Base Area; and the 1st Brigade, 10lst Airborne Division. On 25 September 1967 the 23rd Infantry (Americal) Division) was activated to control the blocking force, replacing the provisional task force HQ. With the elapse of five months, all the three same brigades remained in the new division, but the brigade at Chu Lai was now named the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, after a responsibility swap that had occurred in August.

In April 1966, all Army communications-electronics resources in South Vietnam were combined in a single formation, the 1st Signal Brigade. It supported the combat signal battalions of the divisions and field forces in each corps area. The 1st Signal Brigade operated the many elements of the Defense Communications System in South Vietnam. To improve co-ordination and management of communications-electronics assets, the brigade commander served as the U.S. Army, Vietnam, staff adviser on all matters pertaining to Army communications-electronics. 

On 24 January 1968, General Westmoreland &quot;cabled to Admiral Sharp a recommendation that the Commander in Chief, Pacific (CINCPAC), and MACV begin contingency planning for the use of tactical nuclear weapons in northern Quang Tri if necessary to prevent a major defeat. He noted that in the uninhabited mountains around Khe Sanh, such weapons could be used with great effect and with “negligible” civilian casualties. Sharp on the thirtieth accepted Westmoreland’s proposal and ordered planners from MACV and CINCPAC’s component commands to meet on Okinawa on 1 February. Assigning the project the code-name Fracture Jaw, Sharp told all concerned to “bear in mind the very sensitive nature” of the planning and to restrict knowledge of it to as few people as possible on an “absolutely essential need to know basis.” Planning began in January 1968 to move nuclear weapons into South Vietnam so that they could be used on short notice against North Vietnamese troops. However planning quickly ceased after the effort became public in the United States in February.

===Naval Forces, Vietnam===
In contrast to the carrier, amphibious, and naval gunfire support forces and, at least during early 1965, the coastal patrol force, which Commander Seventh Fleet directed, the Navy&#x27;s forces within South Vietnam were operationally controlled by COMUSMACV. Initially, Westmoreland exercised this command through the Chief, Naval Advisory Group. However, the increasing demands of the war required a distinct operational rather than an advisory headquarters for naval units. As a result, on 1 April 1966, Naval Forces Vietnam, was established to control the Navy&#x27;s units in the II, III and IV Corps Tactical Zones. This eventually included the major combat formations: Coastal Surveillance Force (Task Force 115), River Patrol Force (Task Force 116) and Riverine Assault Force (Task Force 117). The latter unit formed the naval component of the joint Army-Navy Mobile Riverine Force.

Commander Naval Forces, Vietnam (COMNAVFORV) also controlled the Naval Support Activity Saigon (NSA Saigon), which supplied naval forces in the II, III and IV Corps areas. Naval Support Activity Danang (NSA Danang), provided logistic support to all American forces in I Corps, where the predominant Marine presence demanded a naval supply establishment. NSA Danang was under the operational control of Commander III Marine Amphibious Force.

==MACV component commands==
Major component commands of MACV were:
*United States Army, Vietnam (USARV)
*I Field Force, Vietnam (I FFV)
*II Field Force, Vietnam (II FFV)
*XXIV Corps
*III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF)
*Naval Forces, Vietnam (NAVFORV)
*Seventh Air Force (7AF)
*5th Special Forces Group
*Civil Operations and Rural Development Support (CORDS)
*Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG)
*Field Advisory Element, MACV

==Commanders==
The &quot;Commander, U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam&quot; was known by the abbreviation COMUSMACV ( &quot;com-U.S.-mack-vee&quot;). COMUSMACV was in one sense the top person in charge of the U.S. military on the Indochinese peninsula; however, in reality, the CINCPAC and the U.S. ambassadors to Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia also had &quot;top person in charge&quot; status with regard to various aspects of the war&#x27;s strategy.

==MACV Headquarters/DAO Compound==
The original MACV Headquarters were colocated with MAAG at 606 Trần Hưng Đạo, Cholon. In May 1962 it moved to 137 Pasteur Street () in central Saigon. The Trần Hưng Đạo site subsequently became the headquarters of Republic of Korea armed forces in Vietnam.

As the U.S. military presence in South Vietnam grew, MACV quickly outgrew the Pasteur Street quarters and expanded into a proliferating number of buildings throughout downtown Saigon. This added to the command’s existing security vulnerabilities and communications difficulties. In March 1965, Westmoreland began a search for a new location large enough to accommodate the entire headquarters. He initially tried to obtain a site between the ARVN Joint General Staff compound and Tan Son Nhut Airport, desirable from the standpoint of removing Americans from central Saigon and placing MACV conveniently close to its Vietnamese counterpart. 

The Vietnamese government refused to turn over the most suitable location, a soccer field () near the civilian air terminal, allegedly because Premier Nguyễn Cao Kỳ wanted to keep the property for a postwar tourist hotel. In late April 1966, with the Saigon regime locked in a tense confrontation with Buddhist and ARVN rebels in I Corps, Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. and Westmoreland reopened the effort to acquire the Tan Son Nhut soccer field. Under their combined pressure, Kỳ gave way. 

On 2 July 1966 the construction of a purpose-built building began. It was designed and constructed under the supervision of the U.S. Navy Officer in Charge of Construction RVN. The construction contractor was RMK-BRJ, at a cost of $25 million. MACV occupied its new headquarters early in August 1967. The new complex soon earned the nickname &quot;Pentagon East.&quot; 

The air-conditioned complex of two-story prefabricated buildings, a little more than a third the size of its Washington namesake, included twelve acres of enclosed office space. In addition to the headquarters offices, the complex included a barracks, a mess hall, a refrigerated storage building and its own power plant and telephone exchange. Inside, according to one staff officer, &quot;the well-waxed corridors had the fluorescent feel of an airport terminal.&quot; A cyclone fence, topped with barbed wire and with watch towers at intervals, provided close-in protection. 

Following the closure of MACV and the establishment of the DAO, the MACV Headquarters became the DAO Compound.
==Inactivation==
Under the terms of the Paris Peace Accords MACV and all American and third country forces had to be withdrawn from South Vietnam within 60 days of the ceasefire. A small U.S. military headquarters was needed to continue the military assistance program for the southern Republic of Vietnam Military Forces and supervise the technical assistance still required to complete the goals of Vietnamization. This headquarters became the Defense Attaché Office, Saigon. That headquarters also reported operational and military intelligence through military channels to DOD authorities.

A multi-service organization was required to plan for the application of U.S. air and naval power into North or South Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos, should this be required and ordered. Called the United States Support Activities Group &amp; 7th Air Force (USSAG/7th AF), it was located at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base in northeast Thailand.

The advance echelon of USSAG/7AF moved from Tan Son Nhut Air Base to Nakhon Phanom on 29 January 1973. Transfer of the main body, drawn largely from the operations and intelligence sections of MACV and Seventh Air Force, began on 10 February. USSAG was activated on 11 February 1973 under the command of commander of MACV. At 08:00 on 15 February, USAF General John W. Vogt Jr., as USSAG/7AF commander, took over from MACV control of American air operations. U.S. air support operations into Cambodia continued under USSAG/7th AF until August 1973.

The DAO was established as a subsidiary command of MACV and remained under the command of commander of MACV until the deactivation of MACV on 27 March 1973. Command then passed to the Commander USSAG/Seventh Air Force at Nakhon Phanom. The DAO was activated on 28 January 1973 with United States Army Major General John E. Murray, formerly MACV director of logistics, as the Defense Attaché and United States Air Force Brigadier General Ralph J. Maglione, formerly the MACV J-1 (Director for Manpower and Personnel), as deputy Defense Attaché.

By 29 March, the only American military personnel left in South Vietnam were the U.S. delegates to the Four-Party Joint Military Commission established under the Paris Peace Accords to oversee the ceasefire, themselves in the process of winding up work and departing; the fifty man DAO military contingent; and a 143-man Marine Security Guard. At 11:00 on the 29th, in a simple ceremony, General Weyand furled the colors of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, and formally inactivated it.

<text>A strain gauge (also spelled strain gage) is a device used to measure strain on an object. Invented by Edward E. Simmons and Arthur C. Ruge in 1938, the most common type of strain gauge consists of an insulating flexible backing which supports a metallic foil pattern. The gauge is attached to the object by a suitable adhesive, such as cyanoacrylate. As the object is deformed, the foil is deformed, causing its electrical resistance to change. This resistance change, usually measured using a Wheatstone bridge, is related to the strain by the quantity known as the gauge factor.

== History ==
Edward E. Simmons and Professor Arthur C. Ruge independently invented the strain gauge.

Simmons was involved in a research project by Dätwyler and Clark at Caltech between 1936 and 1938. They researched the stress-strain behavior of metals under shock loads. Simmons came up with an original way to measure the force introduced into the sample by equipping a dynamometer with fine resistance wires.

Arthur C. Ruge, a professor at MIT, on the other hand, conducted research in seismology. He tried to analyze the behavior of a model water tank installed on a vibration table.  He was not able to utilize the standard optical strain measurement methods of his time due to the small scale and low strains in his model. Professor Ruge (and his assistant J. Hanns Meier) had the epiphany of measuring the resistance change caused by strain in metallic wires cemented on the thin walls of the water tank model.

The development of the strain gauge was essentially just a byproduct of other research projects. Edward E. Simmons and Professor Arthur C. Ruge developed a widely used and useful measurement tool due to the lack of an alternative at their times. 
Arthur C. Ruge realized the commercial utility of the strain gauge. His employer at MIT waived all claims on the right of the invention, as they did not predict the economic and large-scale usage potential. This prediction turned out to be false. The strain gauge applications were quickly gaining traction as they served to indirectly detect all other quantities that induce strain. Additionally, they were simple to install by the scientists, did not cause any obstruction or property changes to the observed object and thus falsifying the measurement results. Probably the last and most important property was the ease of transmission of the electrical output signal.

==Physical operation==
A strain gauge takes advantage of the physical property of electrical conductance and its dependence on the conductor&#x27;s geometry. When an electrical conductor is stretched within the limits of its elasticity such that it does not break or permanently deform, it will become narrower and longer, which increases its electrical resistance end-to-end. Conversely, when a conductor is compressed such that it does not buckle, it will broaden and shorten, which decreases its electrical resistance end-to-end. From the measured electrical resistance of the strain gauge, the amount of induced stress may be inferred.

A typical strain gauge arranges a long, thin conductive strip in a zig-zag pattern of parallel lines. This does not increase the sensitivity, since the percentage change in resistance for a given strain for the entire zig-zag is the same as for any single trace. A single linear trace would have to be extremely thin, hence liable to overheating (which would change its resistance and cause it to expand), or would need to be operated at a much lower voltage, making it difficult to measure resistance changes accurately.

==Gauge factor==
The gauge factor formula_1 is defined as:
:formula_2
where 
:formula_3 is the change in resistance caused by strain,
:formula_4 is the resistance of the undeformed gauge, and
:formula_5 is strain.

For common metallic foil gauges, the gauge factor is usually a little over 2. For a single active gauge and three dummy resistors of the same resistance about the active gauge in a balanced Wheatstone bridge configuration, the output sensor voltage formula_6 from the bridge is approximately:
:formula_7
where
:formula_8 is the bridge excitation voltage.

Foil gauges typically have active areas of about 2–10 mm2 in size. With careful installation, the correct gauge, and the correct adhesive, strains up to at least 10% can be measured.

==In practice==

An excitation voltage is applied to input leads of the gauge network, and a voltage reading is taken from the output leads. Typical input voltages are 5 V or 12 V and typical output readings are in millivolts.

Foil strain gauges are used in many situations. Different applications place different requirements on the gauge. In most cases the orientation of the strain gauge is significant.

Gauges attached to a load cell would normally be expected to remain stable over a period of years, if not decades; while those used to measure response in a dynamic experiment may only need to remain attached to the object for a few days, be energized for less than an hour, and operate for less than a second.

Strain gauges are attached to the substrate with a special glue. The type of glue depends on the required lifetime of the measurement system. For short term measurements (up to some weeks) cyanoacrylate glue is appropriate, for long lasting installation epoxy glue is required. Usually epoxy glue requires high temperature curing (at about 80-100 °C). The preparation of the surface where the strain gauge is to be glued is of the utmost importance. The surface must be smoothed (e.g. with very fine sand paper), deoiled with solvents, the solvent traces must then be removed and the strain gauge must be glued immediately after this to avoid oxidation or pollution of the prepared area. If these steps are not followed the strain gauge binding to the surface may be unreliable and unpredictable measurement errors may be generated.

Strain gauge based technology is used commonly in the manufacture of pressure sensors. The gauges used in pressure sensors themselves are commonly made from silicon, polysilicon, metal film, thick film, and bonded foil.

===Variations in temperature===
Variations in temperature will cause a multitude of effects. The object will change in size by thermal expansion, which will be detected as a strain by the gauge. Resistance of the gauge will change, and resistance of the connecting wires will change.

Most strain gauges are made from a constantan alloy. Various constantan alloys and Karma alloys have been designed so that the temperature effects on the resistance of the strain gauge itself largely cancel out the resistance change of the gauge due to the thermal expansion of the object under test. Because different materials have different amounts of thermal expansion, self-temperature compensation (STC) requires selecting a particular alloy matched to the material of the object under test.

Strain gauges that are not self-temperature-compensated (such as isoelastic alloy) can be temperature compensated by use of the dummy gauge technique. A dummy gauge (identical to the active strain gauge) is installed on an unstrained sample of the same material as the test specimen. The sample with the dummy gauge is placed in thermal contact with the test specimen, adjacent to the active gauge. The dummy gauge is wired into a Wheatstone bridge on an adjacent arm to the active gauge so that the temperature effects on the active and dummy gauges cancel each other. (Murphy&#x27;s law was originally coined in response to a set of gauges being incorrectly wired into a Wheatstone bridge.)

Every material reacts when it heats up or when it cools down. This will cause strain gauges to register a deformation in the material which will make it change signal. To prevent this from happening strain gauges are made so they will compensate this change due to temperature. Dependent on the material of the surface where the strain gauge is assembled on, a different expansion can be measured.

Temperature effects on the lead wires can be cancelled by using a &quot;3-wire bridge&quot; or a &quot;4-wire ohm circuit&quot; (also called a &quot;4-wire Kelvin connection&quot;).

In any case it is a good engineering practice to keep the Wheatstone bridge voltage drive low enough to avoid the self heating of the strain gauge. The self heating of the strain gauge depends on its mechanical characteristic (large strain gauges are less prone to self heating). Low voltage drive levels of the bridge reduce the sensitivity of the overall system.

== Applications ==

=== Structural health monitoring ===
Structural health monitoring (SHM) is used to monitor structures after their completion. To prevent failures, strain gauges are used to detect and locate damages and creep. A specific example is the monitoring of bridge cables increasing safety by detecting possible damages. Also, the bridge&#x27;s behavior to unusual loads such as special heavy-duty transports can be analyzed.

=== Biological measurements ===
Measuring the strain of skin can provide a multitude of biomechanic measurements such as posture, joint rotation, respiration and swelling both in humans and other animals. Resistive foil strain gauges are seldom used for these applications, however, due to their low strain limit. Instead, soft and deformable strain gauges are often attached to a host garment, to make it simple to apply the sensor to the correct part of the body, though sometimes they are attached directly to the skin. Typically in these applications, such soft strain gauges are known as stretch sensors. For medical use, the sensors must be accurate and repeatable which typically requires the use of capacitive stretch sensors.

=== Predictive maintenance ===
Many objects and materials in industrial applications have a finite life. To improve their lifetime and cost of ownership, predictive maintenance principles are used. Strain gauges can be used to monitor the strain as an indicator of fatigue in materials to enable software systems to predict when certain components need to be replaced or serviced. Resistive foil gauges can be used to instrument stiff materials like metals, ceramics, composites and similar, whereas highly elastic strain gauges are used to monitor softer materials such as rubber, plastics, textiles and the like. 

=== Aviation ===
In aviation, strain gauges are the standard approach to measuring the structural load and calculating wing deflection. Strain gauges are fixed in several locations on the aircraft. However, deflection measurement systems have been shown to measure reliable strains remotely. This reduces instrumentation weight on the aircraft and thus is replacing the strain gauge.

=== Repurposing ===
There are also applications where it isn&#x27;t first obvious that you would measure strain to get to the wanted result. So for example in the detection of intruders on certain structures, strain gauges can be used to detect the presence of such an intruder. This is done by measuring the slight change in strain of the said structure.

==Errors and compensations==
* Zero Offset - If the impedance of the four gauge arms are not exactly the same after bonding the gauge to the force collector, there will be a zero offset which can be compensated by introducing a parallel resistor to one or more of the gauge arms.
* Temperature coefficient of gauge factor (TCGF) is the change of sensitivity of the device to strain with change in temperature. This is generally compensated for by the introduction of a fixed resistance in the input leg, whereby the effective supplied voltage will decrease with a temperature increase, compensating for the increase in sensitivity with the temperature increase. This is known as modulus compensation in transducer circuits. As the temperature rises the load cell element becomes more elastic and therefore under a constant load will deform more and lead to an increase in output; but the load is still the same. The clever bit in all this is that the resistor in the bridge supply must be a temperature sensitive resistor that is matched to both the material to which the gauge is bonded and also to the gauge element material. The value of that resistor is dependent on both of those values and can be calculated. In simple terms if the output increases then the resistor value also increase thereby reducing the net voltage to the transducer. Get the resistor value right and you will see no change. 
* Zero shift with temperature - If the TCGF of each gauge is not the same, there will be a zero shift with temperature. This is also caused by anomalies in the force collector. This is usually compensated for with one or more resistors strategically placed in the compensation network.
* Linearity is an error whereby the sensitivity changes across the pressure range. This is commonly a function of the force collection thickness selection for the intended pressure and the quality of the bonding.
* Hysteresis is an error of return to zero after pressure excursion.
* Repeatability - This error is sometimes tied-in with hysteresis but is across the pressure range.
* Electromagnetic interference (EMI)-induced errors - As the output voltage of strain gauges is in the mV range, even μV if the Wheatstone bridge voltage drive is kept low to avoid self heating of the element, special care must be taken in output signal amplification to avoid amplifying also the superimposed noise. A solution which is frequently adopted is to use &quot;carrier frequency&quot; amplifiers, which convert the voltage variation into a frequency variation (as in voltage-controlled oscillators) and have a narrow bandwidth, thus reducing out of band EMI.
* Overloading – If a strain gauge is loaded beyond its design limit (measured in microstrain) its performance degrades and can not be recovered. Normally good engineering practice suggests not to stress strain gauges beyond ±3000 microstrain.
* Humidity – If the wires connecting the strain gauge to the signal conditioner are not protected against humidity, such as bare wire, corrosion can occur, leading to parasitic resistance. This can allow currents to flow between the wires and the substrate to which the strain gauge is glued, or between the two wires directly, introducing an error which competes with the current flowing through the strain gauge. For this reason, high-current, low-resistance strain gauges (120 ohm) are less prone to this type of error. To avoid this error it is sufficient to protect the strain gauges wires with insulating enamel (e.g., epoxy or polyurethane type). Strain gauges with unprotected wires may be used only in a dry laboratory environment but not in an industrial one.

In some applications, strain gauges add mass and damping to the vibration profiles of the hardware they are intended to measure. In the turbomachinery industry, one used alternative to strain gauge technology in the measurement of vibrations on rotating hardware is the non-intrusive stress measurement system, which allows measurement of blade vibrations without any blade or disc-mounted hardware.

==Geometries of strain gauges==
The following different kind of strain gauges are available in the market:
* Linear strain gauges
* Membrane Rosette strain gauges
* Double linear strain gauges
* Full bridge strain gauges
* Shear strain gauges
* Half bridge strain gauges
* Column strain gauges
* 45°-Rosette (3 measuring directions)
* 90°-Rosette (2 measuring directions).

==Other types==
Strain Gauge measurement devices are prone to drift problems. Additionally, their manufacturing requires precise requirements during all the production steps. So there are multiple different ways of also measuring strain.

* For measurements of small strain, semiconductor strain gauges, so called piezoresistors, are often preferred over foil gauges. A semiconductor gauge usually has a larger gauge factor than a foil gauge. Semiconductor gauges tend to be more expensive, more sensitive to temperature changes, and are more fragile than foil gauges.
* Nanoparticle-based strain gauges emerge as a new promising technology. These resistive sensors whose active area is made by an assembly of conductive nanoparticles, such as gold or carbon, combine a high gauge factor, a large deformation range and a small electrical consumption due to their high impedance.
* In biological measurements, especially blood flow and tissue swelling, a variant called mercury-in-rubber strain gauge is used. This kind of strain gauge consists of a small amount of liquid mercury enclosed in a small rubber tube, which is applied around e.g., a toe or leg. Swelling of the body part results in stretching of the tube, making it both longer and thinner, which increases electrical resistance.
* Fiber optic sensing can be employed to measure strain along an optical fiber. Measurements can be distributed along the fiber, or taken at predetermined points on the fiber. The 2010 America&#x27;s Cup boats Alinghi 5 and USA-17 both employ embedded sensors of this type.
* Other optical measuring techniques can be used to measure strains like electronic speckle pattern interferometry or digital image correlation.
* Microscale strain gauges are widely used in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to measure strains such as those induced by force, acceleration, pressure or sound. As example, airbags in cars are often triggered with MEMS accelerometers. As alternative to piezo-resistant strain gauges, integrated optical ring resonators may be used to measure strain in microoptoelectromechanical systems (MOEMS).
* Capacitive strain gauges use a variable capacitor to indicate the level of mechanical deformation.
* Vibrating wire strain gauges are used in geotechnical and civil engineering applications. The gauge consists of a vibrating, tensioned wire. The strain is calculated by measuring the resonant frequency of the wire (an increase in tension increases the resonant frequency).
* Quartz crystal strain gauges are also used in geotechnical applications. A pressure sensor, a resonant quartz crystal strain gauge with a bourdon tube force collector is the critical sensor of DART. DART detects tsunami waves from the bottom of the open ocean. It has a pressure resolution of approximately 1mm of water when measuring pressure at a depth of several kilometers.
* Multi-axis force sensors could have plenty of advantages over strain gauges regarding their safety, dexterity, and collaborative perspectives. They are based on pre-stress resonant composite plates of which the measurements are performed by piezoelectric transducers. It allows for measuring 3 components of external forces. Moreover, the hardware needed is cheaper than classical strain gauges.

== Non-contact strain measurements ==
Strain can also be measured using digital image correlation (DIC). With this technique one or two cameras are used in conjunction with a DIC software to track features on the surface of components to detect small motion. The full strain map of the tested sample can be calculated, providing similar display as a finite-element analysis. This technique is used in many industries to replace traditional strain gauges or other sensors like extensometers, string pots, LVDT, accelerometers... The accuracy of commercially available DIC software typically ranges around 1/100 to 1/30 of a pixels for displacements measurements which result in strain sensitivity between 20 and 100 μm/m. The DIC technique allows to quickly measure shape, displacements and strain non-contact, avoiding some issues of traditional contacting methods, especially with impacts, high strain, high-temperature or high cycle fatigue testing.

== Literature ==
In 1995  Prof. Dr.-Ing. Stefan Keil published the first edition of a detailed book about strain gauges and how to use them called “Dehnungsmessstreifen”. Although this first edition was only published in German, it became popular outside of Germany because of the wide range of uses of strain gauges in different fields. After more than 20 years (in 2017), he published a second edition that was translated into English, hence available to more engineers that use strain gauges. This newest book is titled “Technology and Practical Use of Strain Gages”.

== Strain gauge theory (sociology) ==
The term &quot;strain gauge&quot; can be encountered in sociology. The social strain gauge theory is an approach to understanding accusations of witchcraft and sorcery. South African anthropologist Maxwell Marwick studied these sociological phenomena in Zambia and Malawi in 1965. Accusations of witchcraft reflect strain on relationships and or the whole social structure. The theory says that the sorcery accusations were a pressure valve of society.

<doc id="418293" wikidata="Q676237" url="?curid=418293" title="Lasing threshold">
<text>The lasing threshold is the lowest excitation level at which a laser&#x27;s output is dominated by stimulated emission rather than by spontaneous emission. Below the threshold, the laser&#x27;s output power rises slowly with increasing excitation. Above threshold, the slope of power vs. excitation is orders of magnitude greater. The linewidth of the laser&#x27;s emission also becomes orders of magnitude smaller above the threshold than it is below. Above the threshold, the laser is said to be &quot;lasing&quot;. The term &quot;lasing&quot; is a back formation from &quot;laser,&quot; which is an acronym, not an agent noun. 

==Theory==
The lasing threshold is reached when the optical gain of the laser medium is exactly balanced by the sum of all the losses experienced by light in one round trip of the laser&#x27;s optical cavity. This can be expressed, assuming steady-state operation, as

:formula_1.

Here formula_2 and formula_3 are the mirror (power) reflectivities, formula_4 is the length of the gain medium, formula_5 is the round-trip threshold power gain, and formula_6 is the round trip power loss. Note that formula_7. This equation separates the losses in a laser into localised losses due to the mirrors, over which the experimenter has control, and distributed losses such as absorption and scattering. The experimenter typically has little control over the distributed losses.

The optical loss is nearly constant for any particular laser (formula_8), especially close to threshold. Under this assumption the threshold condition can be rearranged as

:formula_9.

Since formula_10, both terms on the right side are positive, hence both terms increase the required threshold gain parameter. This means that minimising the gain parameter formula_11 requires low distributed losses and high reflectivity mirrors. The appearance of formula_4 in the denominator suggests that the required threshold gain would be decreased by lengthening the gain medium, but this is not generally the case. The dependence on formula_4 is more complicated because formula_14 generally increases with formula_4 due to diffraction losses.

===Measuring the internal losses===
The analysis above is predicated on the laser operating in a steady-state at the laser threshold. However, this is not an assumption which can ever be fully satisfied. The problem is that the laser output power varies by orders of magnitude depending on whether the laser is above or below threshold. When very close to threshold, the smallest perturbation is able to cause huge swings in the output laser power. The formalism can, however, be used to obtain good measurements of the internal losses of the laser as follows:

Most types of laser use one mirror that is highly reflecting, and another (called the output coupler) that is partially reflective. Reflectivities greater than 99.5% are routinely achieved in dielectric mirrors. The analysis can be simplified by taking formula_16. The reflectivity of the output coupler can then be denoted formula_17. The equation above then simplifies to

:formula_18.

In most cases the pumping power required to achieve lasing threshold will be proportional to the left side of the equation, that is formula_19. (This analysis is equally applicable to considering the threshold energy instead of the threshold power. This is more relevant for pulsed lasers). The equation can be rewritten:

:formula_20,

where formula_21 is defined by formula_22 and formula_23 is a constant. This relationship allows the variable formula_21 to be determined experimentally.

In order to use this expression, a series of slope efficiencies have to be obtained from a laser, with each slope obtained using a different output coupler reflectivity. The power threshold in each case is given by the intercept of the slope with the x-axis. The resulting power thresholds are then plotted versus formula_25. The theory above suggests that this graph is a straight line. A line can be fitted to the data and the intercept of the line with the x-axis found. At this point the x value is equal to the round trip loss formula_26. Quantitative estimates of formula_11 can then be made.

One of the appealing features of this analysis is that all of the measurements are made with the laser operating above the laser threshold. This allows for measurements with low random error, however it does mean that each estimate of formula_28 requires extrapolation. 

A good empirical discussion of laser loss quantification is given in the book by W. Koechner.

<text>A Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) is a designation for a group of United States military advisors sent to other countries to assist in the training of conventional armed forces and facilitate military aid. Although numerous MAAGs operated around the world throughout the 1940s–1970s, including in Yugoslavia after 1951, and to the Ethiopian Armed Forces, the most famous MAAGs were those active in South Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, before and during the Vietnam War. Records held by the National Archives and Records Administration detail the activities of numerous assistance advisory groups.

Typically, the personnel of MAAGs were considered to be technical staff attached to, and enjoying the privileges of, the US diplomatic mission in a country. &quot;The special status of personnel serving in Military Advisory Assistance Groups (MAAG) results from their position as an integral part of the Embassy of the United States where they perform duty.&quot; Although the term is not as widespread as it once was, the functions performed by MAAGs continue to be performed by successor organizations attached to embassies, often called United States Military Groups (USMILGP or MILGRP). The term MAAG may still occasionally be used for such organizations helping promote military partnerships with several Latin American countries such as Peru and the Dominican Republic as well as in African countries such as Liberia.

== Post-WWII China ==
At the end of World War II, a Col. Wise recruited for the Military Advisory Group to the Republic of China Air Force with headquarters located at Nanking and liaison teams at Hankou.

== Yugoslavia ==
A MAAG of 30 officers commanded by Brigadier General John W. Harmony was established by the United States in Belgrade in 1951. It operated for ten years, disbursing military grants and arranging another US$1 billion in arms sales on favorable terms. Among weapons transferred were 599 M4A3 tanks, 319 M-47 tanks, 715 M-7, M-18, and M-36 self-propelled guns, 565 M-3A1 and M-8 armored cars, and a total of total of 760 105mm, 155mm, and 203mm artillery pieces. The artillery pieces delivered were used to reequip artillery units within Yugoslavia&#x27;s eight divisions.

Harmony was promoted to major general by February 1956 and became commander of Military Advisory Assistance Group (Provisional) – Korea.

==Indochina; Vietnam==

In September 1950, US President Harry Truman sent the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) to Vietnam to assist the French in the First Indochina War. The President claimed they were not sent as combat troops, but to supervise the use of $10 million worth of US military equipment to support the French in their effort to fight the Viet Minh forces. By 1953, aid increased dramatically to $350 million to replace old military equipment owned by the French. 

Although Vietnam was then nominally independent, the country was still partly controlled by the French Union. The French Army was reluctant to take U.S. advice and would not allow the Vietnamese army to be trained to use the new equipment. They were supposed to not only defeat enemy forces but to solidify themselves as a colonial power, which they could not do if a Vietnamese army existed. French commanders were so reluctant to accept advice that would weaken the time-honored colonial role that they got in the way of the various attempts by the MAAG to observe where the equipment was being sent and how it was being used. Eventually, the French decided to cooperate, but at that point, it was too late. By 1954, the United States had spent $1 billion in support of the French military effort, shouldering 80 percent of the cost of the war. 

In 1954 the commanding general of French Union forces in Indochina, General Henri Navarre, allowed the United States to send liaison officers to Vietnamese forces. But it was too late, because of the siege and fall of Dien Bien Phu in the spring. On 4 June 1954, Vietnam gained full autonomy within the French Union. As stated by the Geneva Accords a month later, France and its Vietnamese ally were forced to give up the northern half of Vietnam. The French army later withdrew from South Vietnam by April 1956. 

At a conference in Washington, D.C., on February 12, 1955, between officials of the U.S. State Department and the French Minister of Overseas Affairs, it was agreed that all U.S. aid would be funneled directly to South Vietnam and that all major military responsibilities would be transferred from the French to the MAAG under the command of Lieutenant General John O&#x27;Daniel. MAAG Indochina was renamed the MAAG Vietnam on November 1, 1955, as the United States became more deeply involved in what would come to be known as the Vietnam War.

The next few years saw the rise of a Communist insurgency in South Vietnam, and President Diem looked increasingly to US military assistance to strengthen his position, albeit with certain reservations. Attacks on US military advisors in Vietnam became more frequent. On October 22, 1957, MAAG Vietnam and USIS installations in Saigon were bombed, injuring US military advisors. In the summer of 1959, Communist guerrillas staged an attack on a Vietnamese military base in Bien Hoa, killing and wounding several MAAG personnel. During this time, American advisors were not put in high-ranking positions, and President Diem was reluctant to allow American advisors into Vietnamese tactical units. He was afraid that the United States would gain control or influence over his forces if Americans got into the ranks of the army. The first signs that his position was beginning to shift came in 1960, when the number of official US military advisors in the country was increased from 327 to 685 at the request of the South Vietnamese government. By 1961, communist guerrillas were becoming stronger and more active. This increased enemy contacts in size and intensity throughout South Vietnam. At this point, Diem was under pressure from US authorities to liberalize his regime and implement reforms. Although key elements in the US administration were resisting his requests for increased military funding and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) troop ceilings, MAAG Vietnam played a significant role in advocating for a greater US presence in the country. Throughout this period relations between the MAAG Vietnam and Diem were described as &quot;excellent&quot;, even though the advisors were doubtful of his ability to hold off the insurgency.

Newly elected President John F. Kennedy agreed with MAAG Vietnam&#x27;s calls for increases in ARVN troop levels and the U.S. military commitment in both equipment and men. In response, Kennedy provided $28.4 million in funding for ARVN, and overall military aid increased from $50 million per year to $144 million in 1961. In the first year of the Kennedy administration, MAAG Vietnam worked closely with administration officials, USOM, and the US Information Service to develop a counterinsurgency plan (CIP). The CIP&#x27;s main initiatives included the strengthening of ARVN to combat the Communist insurgency, which had the corollary effect of strengthening Diem&#x27;s political position. At the same time President Diem agreed to the assignment of advisors to battalion level, significantly increasing the number of advisors; from 746 in 1961 to over 3,400 before MAAG Vietnam was placed under U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) and renamed the Field Advisory Element, Vietnam. At the peak of the war in 1968, 9,430 US Army personnel, along with smaller numbers of US Navy, US Marine Corps, US Air Force and Australian Army personnel acted as advisors down to the district and battalion level to train, advise and mentor the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps, Republic of Vietnam Navy and the Republic of Vietnam Air Force.

MAAG Indochina had three commanders: BG Francis G. Brink (who committed suicide at The Pentagon on 24 June 1952), October 1950 – June 1952; MG Thomas J. H. Trapnell, June 1952 – April 1954; and LTG John W. O&#x27;Daniel, April 1954 – November 1955. MAAG Vietnam was commanded by LTG Samuel T. Williams, November 1955 – September 1960; LTG Lionel C. McGarr, September 1960 – January 1962; and MG Charles J. Timmes, January 1962 – May 1964, before being reorganized on May 15, 1964 and absorbed into the Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) under GEN Paul D. Harkins.

==MAAG Thailand==
As part of the military outreach of the USA to friendly countries in Southeast Asia, a MAAG was established in Bangkok, Thailand in September 1950 with Brigadier general John T. Cole as Group Chief.

It was replaced by the Joint United States Military Advisory Group Thailand in September 1953, which still operates today.

==MAAG Laos==
MAAG Laos was preceded by the Programs Evaluation Office, established on 15 December 1955. Due to the limitations emplaced by international treaty, the PEO was set up with civilian personnel instead of a MAAG with military staff. When political changes superseded the treaty, MAAG Laos was established in 1961 to replace the Programs Evaluation Office in its support of the Royal Lao Army&#x27;s fight against the communist Pathet Lao. On July 23, 1962, several interested countries agreed in Geneva to guarantee the neutrality and independence of Laos. As such, the US removed the MAAG, replacing it with a Requirements Office, which served as a convenient cover for the CIA activities.

One of MAAG Laos&#x27; commanders was Reuben Tucker.

==MAAG Cambodia==

MAAG Cambodia was established on June 4, 1955, pursuant to the United States-Royal Government of Cambodia agreement of May 16, 1955. This agreement included the introduction of high-ranking US military personnel to advise the Cambodian armed forces as non-combatants. The advisory group was staffed mainly by army personnel, with smaller contingents of navy and air force personnel.

As Cambodia&#x27;s leadership took an official policy of neutrality in the Cold War, MAAG Cambodia&#x27;s involvement in the country was terminated on November 20, 1963, by General Order 6, MAAG Cambodia, following the Cambodian government&#x27;s cancellation of all U.S. aid.

==MAAG, Taiwan==

From 1951 until 1978, there was a Military Assistance Advisory Group to the Republic of China in Taiwan. From 1955, operational U.S. joint combat forces operating alongside the advisory group were directed by the United States Taiwan Defense Command.

The Military Assistance Advisory Group, Taiwan, commanded by Army Major General William C. Chase, was authorized 67 Army, 4 Navy and 63 Air Force personnel. Under the group&#x27;s joint headquarters were Army, Navy and Air Force sections. General Chase arrived at Taipei, Taiwan, on 1 May 1951 to begin carrying out his duties as the military member of a team, which was charged with insuring that all assistance granted the Chinese Nationalists was in furtherance of United States foreign policy.

After its arrival at Taiwan, the advisory group was reorganized and expanded. Initially there was no representation from the Marine Corps, until a U.S. Marine officer, Robert B. Carney Jr., was added to the team. Later on he was joined by a dozen other officers and enlisted men, bringing up the total to 13 Marine Corps personnel. The original three Service sections proved inadequate, so a joint technical service section was created as a counterpart to, and for advising, the Nationalist Army&#x27;s Combined Service Force, which comprised the medical, signal, engineer, ordnance, transportation, chemical, and quartermaster services. A Headquarters Commandant, on the same level as the four section chiefs, was made responsible for the routine tasks necessary to support the group. Military Assistance Advisory Group officers assisted their counterparts within the Nationalist Ministry of National Defense and the general headquarters. Special teams were created as needed to provide aid at service schools and in tactical units.

On September 3, 1954, fourteen 120mm and 155mm Chinese Communist artillery in Xiamen (Amoy) and Dadeng (Tateng) fired six thousand rounds at the Kinmen (Quemoy) Islands in a five-hour period. Two Americans of the US Military Assistance Advisory Group, Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Medendorp and Lieutenant Colonel Frank Lynn, were killed in the shelling. Memorial cenotaphs were erected for the officers on Greater Kinmen by the ROC Army Kinmen Defense Command (陸軍金門防衛指揮部) in 1992 and 2011 respectively. Lt. Col. Alfred Medendorp () was posthumously awarded the Order of the Cloud and Banner in November 1954.

General Chase retired in 1955 at which time he was succeeded by U.S. Brigadier General Lester Bork. In 1967, Major General Richard Ciccolella commanded the MAAG. By this time, the CINCPAC Command History for 1967 gives the title as &quot;MAAG China&quot;.

American military advisors were tasked with providing arms and military advice, assisting with Taiwanese military training, implementation of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, maintaining military contacts, and monitoring Republic of China forces. In 1957 there were 10,000 Americans in Taiwan, the great majority being CIA and military personnel and their families.

Since 1979, the site of MAAG headquarters in Taipei has been occupied by American Institute in Taiwan/Taipei Main Office, which moved to a new office complex in 2019. The American Club Taipei currently occupies the former site of the MAAG NCO Open Mess – Club 63.

==MAAG, Greece==
In 1983, Joint MAAG in Greece US Navy Captain George Tsantes was killed by Revolutionary Organization 17 November.

<text>William Henry Bissell (April 25, 1811March 18, 1860) was the 11th Governor of the U.S. state of Illinois from 1857 until his death. He was one of the first successful Republican Party candidates in the U.S., winning the election of 1856 just two years after the founding of his party. In addition to being the first Republican governor of Illinois, he was also the first Catholic and also the first to die in office.

==Biography==
Bissell was born in Hartwick, New York, near Painted Post, son of Luther Bissell and Hannah Shepard. He attended the public schools and was graduated from the Philadelphia Medical College in 1835. He moved to Monroe County, Illinois in 1837, where he taught school and practiced medicine until 1840.

From 1840 to 1842, Bissell was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives. He studied law, was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Belleville, St. Clair County, Illinois. He was prosecuting attorney of St. Clair County in 1844.

He served in the Mexican War as colonel of the Second Regiment, Illinois Volunteer Infantry, where he most likely contracted the syphilis that crippled him and contributed to his death at age 48.

Bissell was elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-first and Thirty-second Congresses and as an Independent Democrat to the Thirty-third Congress (March 4, 1849 – March 3, 1855); he was chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs (Thirty-second and Thirty-third Congresses). He was not a candidate for re-nomination in 1854.

Bissell, true to his anti-slavery convictions, held a very definite dislike for his Southern colleagues, whom he described collectively as &quot;insolent, overbearing and bullying beyond all belief.&quot; A nearly hour-long speech on the House floor, in retaliation for distortive comments made by James Seddon of Virginia, regarding the Battle of Buena Vista, in which Bissell fought, won approval from Bissell&#x27;s fellow Illinoisans, but inflamed Jefferson Davis, who felt personally slighted by the speech. Davis challenged Bissell to a duel, which Northern Congressmen were known to refuse. Bissell not only accepted the challenge, but in his rights as the party challenged, specified army muskets, loaded with ball and buckshot, at close range. Davis then cleverly accepted further explanation for the seemingly offensive comments in Bissell&#x27;s speech, but lost face with some in backing down.

Though hostilities were never commenced on the field of honor, this incident disqualified Bissell from holding state office in Illinois, according to the state Constitution of 1848. All state officials, as a part of their inauguration oath, had to swear as to never having participated in a duel, either by fighting in one, accepting a challenge or even acting as a second. Once back in Illinois, Bissell, who had broken ties with Stephen A. Douglas over the slavery extension issue, came under the wing of Lincoln and the Republicans, emerging as a rare Catholic in early Republican ranks. In the gubernatorial election of 1856, Abraham Lincoln determined that a former Democrat stood the best chance of defeating the Democratic candidate, William Alexander Richardson of Quincy, a subordinate of Douglas&#x27;. Bissell, by the mid-1850s, was partially paralyzed, able to walk only with use of a cane and &quot;the aid of a friendly arm&quot;. He was nominated unopposed, on May 29, 1856, at Bloomington.

The Democrats made good work of the &quot;duel&quot; issue throughout the campaign and even after the election, which Bissell carried by 4,787 votes in a three-candidate field. The facts were plain: If Bissell took the anti-dueling oath, he was to therefore perjure himself. Bissell slipped the bonds of the charge by pointing out that the duel acceptance occurred in the District of Columbia, and was therefore not subject to the Illinois Constitution. The actual offense, of course, was the perjury itself, perpetrated when Bissell, with embarrassed but tacit approval from the Republicans, took the oath at Springfield.

Bissell, able only now to walk with crutches, has been the only governor of Illinois to be inaugurated in the Executive Mansion itself; he never entered the Capitol during the three-plus years he served. All official business was transacted from the second floor of the Executive Mansion.

In 1859, Bissell approved the exchange of a special class of bonds the state had previously devalued, known as Macalister-Stebbins bonds, at par plus interest. After receiving intense criticism from the Democratic press, he rescinded his decision. The transaction was successfully reversed without financial loss to the state, though Bissell&#x27;s reputation suffered.

Bissell served as governor from January 12, 1857, until his death. He died at the Illinois Executive Mansion in Springfield from pneumonia and was interred in Oak Ridge Cemetery. He was the first Illinois governor to die in office.

==Personal life==

After Bissell&#x27;s first wife died, in 1854 he was married to Elizabeth Kane, daughter of former United States Senator Elias Kane.

<doc id="418307" wikidata="Q1883991" url="?curid=418307" title="Weismann barrier">
<text>The Weismann barrier, proposed by August Weismann, is the strict distinction between the &quot;immortal&quot; germ cell lineages producing gametes and &quot;disposable&quot; somatic cells in animals (but not plants), in contrast to Charles Darwin&#x27;s proposed pangenesis mechanism for inheritance. 

In more precise terminology, hereditary information is copied only from germline cells to somatic cells. This means that new information from somatic mutation is not passed on to the germline. This &quot;barrier&quot; concept implies that somatic mutations are not inherited.

Weismann set out the concept in his 1892 book ″Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung″ (German for &quot;The Germ Plasm: a theory of inheritance&quot;). The use of this theory, commonly in the context of the germ plasm theory of the late 19th century, before the development of better-based and more sophisticated concepts of genetics in the early 20th century, is sometimes referred to as Weismannism. Some authors distinguish Weismannist development (either preformistic or epigenetic) that in which there is a distinct germline, from somatic embryogenesis. This type of development is correlated with the evolution of death of the somatic line.

The Weismann barrier was of great importance in its day and among other influences it effectively banished certain Lamarckian concepts: in particular, it would make Lamarckian inheritance from changes to the body (the soma) difficult or impossible. It remains important, but has however required qualification in the light of modern understanding of horizontal gene transfer and some other genetic and histological developments. 

==Immortality of the germline==
The Russian biologist and historian Zhores A. Medvedev, reviewing Weismann&#x27;s theory a century later, considered that the accuracy of genome replicative and other synthetic systems alone could not explain the &quot;immortal&quot; germ cell lineages proposed by Weismann. Rather Medvedev thought that known features of the biochemistry and genetics of sexual reproduction indicated the presence of unique information maintenance and restoration processes at the different stages of gametogenesis. In particular, Medvedev considered that the most important opportunities for information maintenance of germ cells are created by recombination during meiosis and DNA repair; he saw these as processes within the germ cells that were capable of restoring the integrity of DNA and chromosomes from the types of damage that caused irreversible ageing in somatic cells.

==Basal animals==
Basal animals such as sponges (Porifera) and corals (Anthozoa) contain multipotent stem cell lineages, that give rise to both somatic and reproductive cells. The Weismann barrier appears to be of a more recent evolutionary origin among animals.

==Plants==
In plants, genetic changes in somatic lines can and do result in genetic changes in the germ lines, because the germ cells are produced by somatic cell lineages (vegetative meristems), which may be old enough (many years) to have accumulated multiple mutations since seed germination, some of them subject to natural selection. It is noteworthy in this context that, generally speaking, adult, reproducing plants tend to produce many more offspring in number than animal organisms.

<doc id="418309" wikidata="Q108576" url="?curid=418309" title="Daniel Carleton Gajdusek">
<text>Daniel Carleton Gajdusek ( ; September 9, 1923 – December 12, 2008) was an American physician and medical researcher who was the co-recipient (with Baruch S. Blumberg) of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1976 for work on the transmissibility of kuru, implying the existence of an infectious agent, which he named an &#x27;unconventional virus&#x27;. In 1996, Gajdusek was charged with child molestation and, after being convicted, spent 12 months in prison before entering a self-imposed exile in Europe, where he died a decade later.

His papers are held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland and at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Early life and education==
Gajdusek&#x27;s father, Karol Gajdusek, was a Slovak butcher from Büdöskö, Kingdom of Hungary, now Smrdáky, Slovakia. His mother Ottilia Dobróczki, and maternal grandparents, ethnic Hungarians of the Calvinist faith, emigrated from Debrecen, Hungary. They are of Jewish descent. Gajdusek was born in Yonkers, New York, and graduated in 1943 from the University of Rochester, where he studied physics, biology, chemistry, and mathematics. 

He obtained an M.D. from Harvard University in 1946 and performed postdoctoral research at Columbia University, the California Institute of Technology, and Harvard. In 1951, Gajdusek was drafted into the U.S. Army and assigned as a research virologist at the Walter Reed Army Medical Service Graduate School. He was discharged from the military in 1954.

==Career==
In 1954, he worked as a visiting investigator at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia. There, he began the work that culminated in the Nobel Prize. From 1970 to 1996, Gajdusek was the chief of the Laboratory of Central Nervous System Studies at NINDS at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1978.

=== Kuru research ===
Gajdusek&#x27;s best-known work focused on kuru. This disease was rampant among the South Fore people of New Guinea in the 1950s and 1960s. Gajdusek connected the spread of the disease to the practice of funerary cannibalism by the South Fore. With elimination of cannibalism, kuru disappeared among the South Fore within a generation.

Gajdusek was introduced to the problem of kuru by Vincent Zigas, a district medical officer in the Fore Tribe region of New Guinea. Gajdusek provided the first medical description of this unique neurological disorder, which was miscast in the popular press as the &quot;laughing sickness&quot; because some patients displayed risus sardonicus as a symptom. He lived among the Fore, studied their language and culture, and performed autopsies on kuru victims.

Gajdusek concluded that kuru was transmitted by the ritualistic consumption of the brains of deceased relatives, which was practiced by the Fore. He then proved this hypothesis by successfully transmitting the disease to primates and demonstrating that it had an unusually long incubation period of several years. He did this by drilling holes into chimps&#x27; heads and placing pureed brain matter into the cerebellum. These animals then developed symptoms of kuru. This was the first demonstration of the infectious spread of a noninflammatory degenerative disease in humans.

Kuru was shown to have remarkable similarity to scrapie, a disease of sheep and goats caused by an unconventional infectious agent. Subsequently, additional human agents belonging to the same group were discovered. They include sporadic, familial, and variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Gajdusek recognized that diseases like Kuru and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease were caused by a new infectious agent that had not yet been identified. Further research on the scrapie agent by Stanley Prusiner and others led to the identification of endogenous proteins called prions as the cause of these diseases.

===&quot;Unconventional viruses&quot;===
In his 1977 paper &quot;Unconventional Viruses and the Origin and Disappearance of Kuru,&quot; Gajdusek postulated that the cause of kuru, scrapie and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease were caused by what he termed an unconventional virus. In comparison to normal viruses, unconventional viruses had a long incubation period and did not cause an immune response in the host. Although Gajdusek noted that there were no demonstrable nucleic acids in unconventional viruses, he did not rule out the possibility that unconventional viruses contained RNA at a low level, despite their radiation resistance.

These infectious agents were later discovered to be misfolded proteins, or prions.

==Child molestation convictions==
In the course of his research trips in the South Pacific, Gajdusek had brought 56 mostly male children back to live with him in the United States and provided them with the opportunity to receive high school and college education. One of these boys, now a grown man, later accused Gajdusek of molesting him as a child.

Gajdusek was charged with child molestation in April 1996, based on incriminating entries in published journals, his personal diary, and statements from a victim. In journals published and distributed by the NIH, Gajdusek wrote about sex between men and boys in New Guinea, Micronesia, and other Polynesian islands, and about his own sexual experiences with boys during his research trips.

Gajdusek pleaded guilty in 1997 and, under a plea bargain, was sentenced to 12 months in jail. After his release in 1998, he was permitted to serve his five-year unsupervised probation in Europe. He never returned to the United States and lived in Amsterdam, spending winters in Tromsø, Norway, where the polar night around the winter solstice helped him to do more work.

Gajdusek&#x27;s treatment was denounced in October 1996 as anti-elitist and unduly harsh by controversial former Edinburgh University psychologist Chris Brand.

The documentary &quot;The Genius and the Boys&quot; by Bosse Lindquist, first shown on BBC Four on June 1, 2009, notes that &quot;seven men testified in confidentiality about Gajdusek having had sex with them when they were boys&quot;, that four said &quot;the sex was untroubling&quot;, while for three of them &quot;the sex was a shaming, abusive, and a violation&quot;. One of these boys, the son of a friend and now an adult, appears in the film. Furthermore, Gajdusek openly admits to molesting boys and his approval of incest. The film tries to analyse Gajdusek&#x27;s sexual behaviour, and also to understand his motivations for science, exploration, and life.

==Death and legacy==
Gajdusek died December 12, 2008, in Tromsø, Norway, at the age of 85. He was working and visiting colleagues in Tromsø at the time of his death.

Hanya Yanagihara&#x27;s 2013 novel, &quot;The People in the Trees&quot;, is based on Gajdusek&#x27;s life, research, and child molestation conviction. The novel centers on a character named A. Norton Perina, inspired by Gajdusek, who researches the life-extending properties of sacred turtle meat in Micronesia.

<text>Creighton Williams Abrams Jr. (15 September 1914 – 4 September 1974) was a United States Army general who commanded military operations in the Vietnam War from 1968 to 1972. He was then Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1972 until his death in 1974.

In 1980, the United States Army named its then new main battle tank, the M1 Abrams, after him. The IG Farben building in Germany was also named after Abrams from 1975 to 1995.

==Military career==
===Early career===
Abrams graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in the Class of 1936, ranking 185th of 276 in the class. His classmates included Benjamin O. Davis Jr. and William Westmoreland. He served with the 1st Cavalry Division from 1936 to 1940, being promoted to first lieutenant in 1939 and temporary captain in 1940.

Abrams became an armor officer early in the development of that branch and served as a tank company commander in the 1st Armored Division in 1940.

===World War II===
During World War II, Abrams served in the 4th Armored Division, initially as regimental adjutant (June 1941 – June 1942), battalion commander (July 1942 – March 1943), and regiment executive officer (March–September 1943) with the 37th Armor Regiment. In September 1943, a reorganization of the division redesignated the 37th Armor Regiment to the 37th Tank Battalion, which Abrams commanded. He commanded Combat Command B of the division during the Battle of the Bulge, and entitled to wear the French Fourragère as a member of the 4th Armored Division.

During this time Abrams was promoted to the temporary ranks of major (February 1942), lieutenant colonel (September 1942), and colonel (April 1945). Abrams was promoted to lieutenant colonel at age 27 years, 11 months.

During much of this time, the 4th Armored Division, led by the 37th Tank Battalion, was the spearhead for General George S. Patton&#x27;s Third Army. Abrams was well known as an aggressive armor commander. By using his qualities as a leader and by consistently exploiting the relatively small advantages of speed and reliability of his vehicles, he managed to defeat German forces that had the advantage of superior armor and superior guns. He was twice decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism, on 20 September and 26 December 1944. General George Patton said of him: &quot;I&#x27;m supposed to be the best tank commander in the Army, but I have one peer—Abe Abrams. He&#x27;s the world champion.&quot;

Frequently the spearhead of the Third Army during World War II, Abrams was one of the leaders in the relief effort that broke up the German entrenchments surrounding Bastogne and the 101st Airborne Division during the Battle of the Bulge. In April 1945, he was promoted to temporary colonel but reverted to lieutenant colonel during the post-war demobilization. On April 23, 1945, Will Lang Jr. wrote a biography of Abrams called &quot;Colonel Abe&quot; for &quot;Life&quot;.

===Interbellum and Korean War===
Following the war, Abrams served on the Army General Staff (1945–1946), as head of the department of tactics at the Armored School, Fort Knox (1946–1948), and graduated from the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth (1949).

Abrams commanded the 63rd Tank Battalion, part of the 1st Infantry Division, in Europe (1949–1951). He was again promoted to colonel and commanded the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment (1951–1952). These units were important assignments due to the Cold War concern for potential invasion of western Europe by the Soviet Union. He then attended and graduated from the Army War College in 1953.

Because of Abrams&#x27;s service in Europe and his War College tour, he joined the Korean War late. In South Korea (1953–1954), he successively served as chief of staff of the I, X, and IX Corps.

===Staff assignments and division command===
Upon Abrams&#x27; return from Korea, he served as Chief of Staff of the Armor Center, Fort Knox (1954–1956). He was promoted to brigadier general and appointed deputy chief of staff for reserve components at the Pentagon (1956–1959). He was assistant division commander of 3rd Armored Division (1959–1960) and then commanded the division (1960–1962) upon his promotion to major general. He was transferred to the Pentagon as deputy Chief of Staff for Operations (1962–1963) and during this time he served as representative of the Army Chief of Staff overseeing the armed forces deployed to support the enrollment of James Meredith at the segregated University of Mississippi.

He performed a similar role in May 1963 during the civil rights protests in Birmingham, Alabama. Following these roles Abrams demanded a more coherent policy for the swift employment of Federal forces domestically. In May 1963, the Joint Chiefs formalized those arrangements with the Strike Command instructed to be prepared &quot;to move ready, deployable, tailored Army forces ranging in size from a reinforced company to a maximum force of 15,000 personnel&quot;.

He was promoted to lieutenant general and commanded V Corps in Europe (1963–1964).

Abrams was on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine three times in ten years: 1961 (13 October), 1968 (19 April), and 1971 (15 February).

===Vietnam War===

Abrams was promoted to general in 1964 and appointed Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army. He was seriously considered as a candidate for chief of staff. Due to concerns about the conduct of the Vietnam War, he was appointed as deputy to his West Point classmate, General William Westmoreland, commander of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), in May 1967.

Abrams succeeded Westmoreland as COMUSMACV on 10 June 1968. His tenure of command was not marked by the public optimism of his predecessors, who were prone to press conferences and public statements.

Lewis Sorley asserted that in contrast to Westmoreland, Abrams implemented counterinsurgency tactics that focused on winning the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese rural population. A joint military-civilian organization named Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support under CIA official William Colby carried out the hearts and minds programs. According to a colonel cited in &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot;, there was more continuity than change in Vietnam after Abrams succeeded Westmoreland.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine at the time of Abrams&#x27; appointment observed that its sources within the Lyndon Johnson administration had spoken at length with Abrams in the past, and had come away convinced that the general would make few changes. The magazine quoted an unidentified military analyst to the effect that, &quot;All this talk of dropping search-and destroy operations in favor of clear-and-hold is just a lot of bull.&quot; None of the strategy papers produced by Abrams on assuming command of MACV indicated the need for any change in U.S. strategy and U.S. forces continued large-scale operations to engage People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) main force units including the Battle of Hamburger Hill in May 1969.

From 1969, the Vietnam War increasingly became a conventional war between the military forces of South Vietnam and North Vietnam. Following the election of President Richard Nixon, Abrams began implementing the Nixon Administration&#x27;s Vietnamization policy to decrease U.S. involvement in Vietnam. With this new goal, Abrams decreased American troop strength from a peak of 543,000 in early 1969 to 49,000 in June 1972.

The South Vietnamese forces with aerial support from the U.S. repelled the PAVN conventional Easter Offensive in 1972. The prolonged efforts and expense of the war had by then exhausted much of the American public and political support. Abrams disdained most of the politicians with whom he was forced to deal, in particular Robert McNamara and McGeorge Bundy, and had an even lower opinion of defense contractors, whom he accused of war profiteering.

Abrams was in charge of the Cambodian Incursion in 1970. President Nixon seemed to hold Abrams in high regard, and often relied on his advice. In a tape-recorded conversation between Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger on December 9, 1970, Nixon told Kissinger about Abrams&#x27; thoughts on intervention in Cambodia that: &quot;If Abrams strongly recommends it we will do it.&quot; Troop levels in Vietnam eventually reached 25,000 in January 1973, at the time of the four power Paris Peace Accords. Although it occurred before he assumed total command, Abrams bore the brunt of fallout from the My Lai massacre in March 1968.

Nixon grew increasingly dissatisfied with Abrams&#x27; performance during Operation Lam Son 719 and had debated for some time whether to recall Abrams. On 4 May 1972, a little more than a month after the onset of the Easter Offensive, Nixon resolved to replace Abrams with his former deputy General Frederick Weyand, but the decision was not publicly announced until 20 June 1972.

===Chief of Staff===

Abrams was appointed Chief of Staff of the United States Army by Nixon in June 1972. He was not confirmed by the United States Senate until October, due to political repercussions involving accusations of unauthorized bombings of North Vietnam. It has also been reported that Congress had delayed the confirmation to question the administration&#x27;s war in Cambodia. During this time, Abrams began the transition to the all-volunteer army, also known as Project VOLAR.

In January 1974, Abrams directed the formation of a Ranger battalion. The 1st Battalion (Ranger), 75th Infantry, was activated and parachuted into Fort Stewart, Georgia, on 1 July; the 2nd Battalion (Ranger), 75th Infantry followed with activation on 1 October. The 3rd Battalion, 75th Infantry (Ranger), and Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 75th Infantry (Ranger), received their colors a decade later on 3 October 1984, at Fort Benning, Georgia. The 75th Ranger Regiment was designated in February 1986. The modern Ranger battalions owe their existence to Abrams and his charter:
Abrams served as Chief of Staff until his death on 4 September 1974.

==Personal life==
Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, and raised in the Feeding Hills section of Agawam, he was the son of Nellie Louise (Randall) and Creighton Williams Abrams, a railroad worker. Abrams married Julia Berthe Harvey in 1936. She founded the army group of Arlington Ladies and devoted time to humanitarian causes.

The Abramses had three sons and three daughters. All three sons became Army general officers, including John Nelson Abrams and Robert Bruce Abrams.

Abrams converted to Catholicism during his time in Vietnam. He was raised as Methodist Protestant.

A heavy cigar smoker, Abrams died at age 59, eleven days before his 60th birthday at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., from complications of surgery to remove a cancerous lung. He is buried with his wife Julia in Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Santo Trafficante Sr. (May 28, 1886 – August 11, 1954) was a Sicilian-born mobster, and father of the powerful mobster Santo Trafficante Jr.

Santo Trafficante Sr. gained power as a mobster in Tampa, Florida and ruled the Mafia in Tampa from the 1930s until his death in 1954. Trafficante was heavily involved in the operation of illegal bolita lotteries. During his reign, Trafficante was a well-respected boss with ties to Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano and Thomas Lucchese.

During the 1940s, Trafficante Sr. maintained a strong alliance with Tommy Lucchese, the boss of the Lucchese crime family in New York City. Lucchese would help train his son Trafficante Jr. in the mafia traditions.

Trafficante died of stomach cancer on August 11, 1954; he was a member of L&#x27;Unione Italiana, and he was buried in L&#x27;Unione Italiana Cemetery in Ybor City. His son, Santo Trafficante Jr. subsequently took over the crime family.

<text>Santo Trafficante Jr. (November 15, 1914 – March 17, 1987) was among the most powerful Mafia bosses in the United States. He headed the Trafficante crime family from 1954 to 1987 and controlled organized criminal operations in Florida and Cuba, which had previously been consolidated from several rival gangs by his father, Santo Trafficante Sr.

Trafficante maintained links to the Bonanno crime family in New York City, but was more closely allied with Sam Giancana in Chicago. Consequently, while generally recognized as the most powerful organized crime figure in Florida throughout much of the 20th century, Trafficante was not believed to have total control over Miami, Miami Beach, Ft. Lauderdale, or Palm Beach. The east coast of Florida was a loosely knit conglomerate of New York family interests with links to Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, Angelo Bruno, Carlos Marcello, and Frank Ragano.

Trafficante admitted his anti-Castro activities to the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978, and vehemently denied allegations that he had knowledge of a plot to assassinate President John F. Kennedy. Federal investigators brought racketeering and conspiracy charges against him in the summer of 1986.

== Early life ==
Trafficante was born in Tampa, Florida, to Sicilian parents Santo Trafficante Sr. and his wife Maria Giuseppa Cacciatore in 1914. He dropped out of high school before the 10th grade. Trafficante maintained several residences in New York City and Florida. U.S. Treasury Department documents indicate that law enforcement believed Trafficante&#x27;s legitimate business interests to include several legal casinos in Cuba; a Havana drive-in movie theater; and shares in several restaurants and bars in Trafficante&#x27;s hometown of Tampa, Florida. He was rumored to be part of a Mafia syndicate which owned many Cuban hotels and casinos. As one of the most powerful mobsters in the US, Trafficante was invited to the Havana Conference in December 1946.

Trafficante was arrested frequently throughout the 1950s on various charges of bribery and of running illegal &quot;bolita&quot; lotteries in Tampa&#x27;s Ybor City district. He escaped conviction all but once, receiving a five-year sentence for bribery in 1954, but his conviction was overturned by the Florida Supreme Court before he entered prison.

During the 1950s, Trafficante Jr. maintained a narcotic trafficking network with Tommy Lucchese, the boss of the Lucchese crime family in New York City. Trafficante Jr. had known Lucchese since the 1940s, when his father and Lucchese had trained him in the mafia traditions. Trafficante Jr. would frequently meet with Lucchese in New York City for dinner.

== Cuba ==
Trafficante had been operating in Cuba since the late 1940s under his father, Santo Trafficante Sr., a mobster in Tampa, Florida. After his father died in 1954, he became the head in Tampa and took over his fathers interests in Cuba. Trafficante moved to Cuba in 1955, where he came into contact with Batista and Meyer Lansky. During the rule of Cuba&#x27;s authoritarian dictator Fulgencio Batista, Trafficante openly operated the Sans Souci Cabaret and the Casino International gambling establishments in Havana. As a leading member of the syndicate, he also was suspected of having behind-the-scenes interests in other syndicate-owned Cuban casinos: the Hotel Habana Riviera, the Tropicana Club, the Sevilla-Biltmore, the Capri Hotel Casino, the Commodoro, the Deauville, and the Havana Hilton.

Trafficante was apprehended in November 1957, along with over 60 other mobsters, at the Apalachin meeting in Apalachin, New York. All were fined, up to $10,000 each, and given prison sentences ranging from three to five years. All the convictions were overturned on appeal in 1960. Cuba was one of the Apalachin topics of discussion, particularly the gambling and narcotics smuggling interests of La Cosa Nostra on the island. The international narcotics trade was also an important topic on the Apalachin agenda.

In January 1958, Trafficante was questioned by the Cuban police regarding the Apalachin meeting. A full report was made by the Cuban police, dated January 23, 1958, includes transcripts of long-distance telephone calls made from the Sans Souci during the period August–December 1957. The report was given to the District Attorney&#x27;s office. In addition, &quot;on January 23, 1958 the Cuban Department of Investigation, Havana, Cuba notified the Bureau of Narcotics that Santo Trafficante was registered in their Alien Office under No. 93461.&quot;

==Plot to assassinate Castro==
After Fidel Castro&#x27;s revolutionary government seized the assets of Trafficante&#x27;s Cuban businesses and expelled him from the country as an &quot;undesirable alien,&quot; Trafficante came into contact with various US intelligence operatives, and was involved in several unsuccessful plans to assassinate Castro. In 1975, the CIA declassified a report stating that Trafficante had been persuaded to poison Castro, an allegation he denied. In 1997, further declassified documents indicated that some &quot;mafiosi&quot; worked with the agency on assassination attempts against Castro. Allusions to these historic connections were confirmed by the CIA&#x27;s 2007 declassification of the &quot;Family Jewels&quot; documents.

The &quot;Family Jewels&quot; confirmed that in September 1960, the CIA recruited ex-FBI agent Robert Maheu to approach the West Coast representative of the Chicago mob, Johnny Roselli. Maheu hid that he was sent by the CIA, instead portraying himself an advocate for international corporations. He offered to pay $150,000 to have Castro killed, but Roselli declined any pay and introduced Maheu to two men he referred to as &quot;Sam Gold&quot; and &quot;Joe.&quot; &quot;Sam Gold&quot; was Sam Giancana; &quot;Joe&quot; was Trafficante. The CIA and the Mafia had a common enemy in Castro, a communist revolutionary who had shut down Cuba&#x27;s lucrative casino businesses.

==JFK conspiracy allegations==
In 1976, Cuban exile and FBI informant Jose Aleman told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that in September 1962, Trafficante had offered him a loan of $1.5 million to replace Aleman&#x27;s three-story &quot;ramshackle motel with a 12-story glass wonder.&quot; He said that Trafficante complained about the honesty of the Kennedys and their &quot;attacks&quot; on Jimmy Hoffa and other associates. According to Aleman, when he told Trafficante that President John F. Kennedy would likely be re-elected, Trafficante replied, &quot;No, Jose, he is going to be hit.&quot; Aleman claimed to have reported Trafficante&#x27;s comments to his FBI contacts, who &quot;dismissed the Kennedy warnings as gangland braggadocio.&quot;

In 1978, both Trafficante and Aleman were called to testify before members of the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations investigating possible links between Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and anti-Castro Cubans, including the theory that Castro had Kennedy killed in retaliation for the CIA&#x27;s attempts on his own life. On September 27, 1978, Aleman reiterated to HSCA investigators that Trafficante had complained to him for hours in June or July 1963 about Kennedy&#x27;s crackdown on organized crime at a meeting to discuss a business loan.

The HSCA had previously quoted Aleman as stating that he thought Trafficante&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;he is going to be hit&quot; meant that the mob boss knew Kennedy was going to be killed. When this was pointed out, Aleman denied that he meant that he believed Kennedy was going to murdered and said he thought that Trafficante meant that Kennedy was going to be &quot;hit&quot; politically during the next election. He stated that he was concerned for his safety and was not certain that he had ever correctly heard or understood Trafficante&#x27;s comment.

After a grant of immunity from prosecution, Trafficante testified before the HSCA the following day, September 28, and denied the allegation that he told Aleman that &quot;Kennedy was going to be hit.&quot; He stated that he was positive that he did not say it because he always spoke to Aleman in Spanish, and said that there was no way to state the phrase in Spanish. Trafficante also stated that he had no recollection of meeting Oswald or Oswald&#x27;s assassin, Jack Ruby. During his testimony, Trafficante also admitted for the first time that he had worked with the CIA from 1960 to 1961 for an attempt to poison Castro but stated that his role was only as an interpreter between CIA officials and Cuban exiles. He testified that he was brought into the plot by Roselli and Giancana, who had been recruited by Maheu. Trafficante said that he introduced the trio to Cuban exiles in Florida. He stated that he received no payment for his involvement and that he acted out of patriotism.

On January 14, 1992, Trafficante&#x27;s former attorney, Frank Ragano, told Jack Newfield of the &quot;New York Post&quot; that he relayed a request from Hoffa to Trafficante and New Orleans boss Carlos Marcello to have Kennedy killed. He repeated the claim two days later on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, in Newfield&#x27;s &quot;Frontline&quot; report entitled &quot;JFK, Hoffa and Mob&quot; broadcast in November 1992, and again in his 1994 autobiography &quot;Mob Lawyer&quot;. According to Ragano, he met Hoffa at the Teamsters&#x27; headquarters in Washington, DC, then delivered the message to Trafficante and Marcello in a meeting at the Royal Orleans Hotel in New Orleans. He stated he was chosen by Hoffa because, as both Hoffa and Trafficante&#x27;s lawyer, he could be assured of attorney–client privilege.

Ragano also claimed that Trafficante, four days prior to his death, delivered a deathbed confession which suggested that Marcello was meant to assassinate Robert F. Kennedy instead of his brother, the President. He claimed three witnesses could support his statement that he met Trafficante in Tampa, but refused to name them, adding: &quot;One guy is afraid of retaliation. The other guys are two doctors, who say they&#x27;ll testify if they&#x27;re summoned to court.&quot; In his book &quot;Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy&quot;, Vincent Bugliosi has claimed there to be many flaws in Ragano&#x27;s claims, including his own claim that Trafficante was most likely not in Tampa on the day in question, but was rather in North Miami Beach, Florida, receiving dialysis treatments.

In 2005, Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann&#x27;s book &quot;Ultimate Sacrifice&quot; said that Trafficante was behind an aborted plot to kill Kennedy in Tampa on November 18, 1963.

== Later years and death ==
Trafficante was summoned to court in 1986 and questioned about his involvement with the King&#x27;s Court Bottle Club operated by members of the Bonanno crime family, including undercover FBI agent Joseph D. &quot;Joe&quot; Pistone, a.k.a. Donnie Brasco. Trafficante again escaped conviction. On March 17, 1987, Trafficante died at the age of 72 at the Texas Heart Institute in Houston where he had gone for heart surgery. His wife, Josephine, died in 2015 at the age of 95; he is survived by two of his daughters. After the death of his wife, the Trafficante family sold their Tampa 1970-built home for $950,000. In February 2016, many of Trafficante&#x27;s personal belongings were sold at an auction in St. Petersburg, Florida.

<doc id="418322" wikidata="Q6662766" url="?curid=418322" title="Lloyd Street Grounds">
<text>Lloyd Street Grounds was a baseball park located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was used by two different professional baseball clubs during 1895–1903.

The field was situated about northwest of downtown Milwaukee in the eastern part of a block bounded by West North Avenue on the north, North 16th Street on the east, North 18th Street on the west and West Lloyd Street on the south. The field faced due north, so Lloyd Street ran directly behind home plate and the grandstand.

==History==
===Milwaukee Brewers===
The first occupants of the Lloyd Street Grounds were the Milwaukee Brewers of the Western League, which opened the park in 1895 after leaving Athletic Park, the eventual Borchert Field.

When the National League contracted by four teams following the season, it opened the door for a second major league. Ban Johnson, president of the Western League, changed his league&#x27;s name to the American League for the season, although it remained officially a minor league. He placed teams in cities that the National League had shunned, and other teams were placed in already existing National League cities to create a rivalry.

In , the American League became a major league, retaining Milwaukee as one of its charter members. Almost from the start of the season plans were underway to relocate the Brewers; this contributed to the club finishing dead last with a 48–89 record. The first major-league game played at Lloyd Street was on 3 May 1901 and the last on 12 September 1901.

For , the Brewers announced they were moving to become the St. Louis Browns, where they played until 1954, when the Browns relocated to become the Baltimore Orioles. Milwaukee was a successful minor-league city for years, before getting another major-league team in 1953, when the National League&#x27;s Boston Braves relocated and became the Milwaukee Braves. After the Braves left in 1966, the Milwaukee Brewers were re-incarnated in 1970, when the Seattle Pilots arrived after operating for just a single season.

===Milwaukee Creams===
A new Western League formed in 1902, with the Milwaukee Creams as a charter member. This club played for two years in competition with the new Milwaukee Brewers of the newly formed American Association, which had re-opened the park eventually known as Borchert Field.

The city wasn&#x27;t large enough to support two clubs, and the Western League entry folded after 1903. The Western League itself continued on until 1937, maintaining a close relationship with the American Association, trading franchises back and forth on occasion, and playing post-season series from time to time. But 1903 was the end of the Western League&#x27;s Milwaukee experiment, and of the Lloyd Street ballpark as a professional venue.

===Demolition===
The Lloyd Street ballpark was torn down in 1904. By 1909, North 17th Street was extended through the ballpark site and the property became populated with new homes. Today, the site is a residential neighborhood.

<doc id="418323" wikidata="Q2229812" url="?curid=418323" title="Norman Morrison">
<text>Norman R. Morrison (December 29, 1933 – November 2, 1965) was an American anti-war activist. On November 2, 1965, Morrison doused himself in kerosene and set himself on fire below the office of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara at the Pentagon to protest United States involvement in the Vietnam War, leading to his death. This action was inspired by photographs of Vietnamese children burned by napalm bombings, and may have been inspired by Thích Quảng Đức and other Buddhist monks, who burned themselves to death to protest the repression committed by the South Vietnam government of Catholic President Ngo Dinh Diem.

== Background ==
Morrison was born in Erie, Pennsylvania and was raised Presbyterian. At 13, his family moved to Chautauqua, New York, where Morrison joined the Boy Scouts of America and entered the God and Country Program, becoming the youngest BSA member in Chautauqua County to earn a God and Country award. Morrison graduated from the College of Wooster in 1956. He had gained an interest in the Quakers and their ideals, but continued to attend Presbyterian seminars in Pittsburgh and at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Morrison became a member of the Religious Society of Friends in 1959 and by 1965, he worked for Stony Run Friends Meeting in Baltimore as its Executive Secretary. As an ardent believer in the principle of pacifism, he condemned the actions of the U.S. military in the Vietnam War. 

Six months before the act, on March 9, President of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson had authorized the use of napalm in the Vietnam War, which, by the end of the war, would end up killing at least 50,000 civilians in airstrikes. This decision had spurred fellow Quaker and peace activist Alice Herz to set herself on fire in an open street in Detroit, Michigan on March 16 of the same year, in similar vein as Thích Quảng Đức had done in 1963. At the time of his death, Morrison was married to Anne Welsh, also a Quaker, with whom he had two daughters and a son.

==Death==
Morrison took his daughter Emily, then one year of age, to the Pentagon, and either set her down or handed her off to someone in the crowd before setting himself ablaze. He died within two minutes of leaving in an ambulance for Fort Myer.

Morrison&#x27;s reasons for taking Emily are not entirely known. However, Morrison&#x27;s wife Anne later recalled, &quot;Whether he thought of it that way or not, I think having Emily with him was a final and great comfort to Norman... [S]he was a powerful symbol of the children we were killing with our bombs and napalm – who didn&#x27;t have parents to hold them in their arms.&quot;

In a letter he mailed to Welsh, Morrison reassured her of the faith in his act. &quot;Know that I love thee ... but I must go to help the children of the priest&#x27;s village&quot;. McNamara described Morrison&#x27;s death as &quot;a tragedy not only for his family but also for me and the country. It was an outcry against the killing that was destroying the lives of so many Vietnamese and American youth.&quot; He was survived by Anne Welsh and three children, Ben (who died of cancer in 1976), Christina and Emily.

== Legacy ==
Morrison was seen as devout and sincere in sacrificing himself for a cause greater than himself. In Vietnam, Morrison quickly became a folk hero to some, his name rendered as &quot;Mo Ri Xon&quot;. Five days after Morrison died, Vietnamese poet Tố Hữu wrote a poem, &quot;Emily, My Child&quot;, assuming the voice of Morrison addressing his daughter Emily and telling her the reasons for his sacrifice.

One week after Morrison, Roger Allen LaPorte performed a similar act in New York City, in front of the United Nations building. On May 9, 1967, as part of the start to the 1967 Pentagon camp-in, demonstrators held a vigil for Morrison, before occupying the Pentagon for four days until being removed and arrested.
Morrison&#x27;s widow, Anne, and the couple&#x27;s two daughters visited Vietnam in 1999, where they met with Tố Hữu, the poet who had written the popular poem &quot;Emily, My Child&quot;. Anne Morrison Welsh recounts the visit and her husband&#x27;s tragedy in her monograph, &quot;Fire of the Heart: Norman Morrison&#x27;s Legacy In Vietnam And At Home&quot;.

On his visit to the United States in 2007, President of Vietnam Nguyễn Minh Triết visited a site on the Potomac near the place where Morrison immolated himself and read the poem by Tố Hữu to commemorate Morrison.

==Cultural depictions==
Filmmaker Errol Morris interviewed Secretary McNamara at length on camera in his documentary film, &quot;The Fog of War&quot;, in which McNamara says, &quot;[Morrison] came to the Pentagon, doused himself with gasoline. Burned himself to death below my office ... his wife issued a very moving statement – &#x27;human beings must stop killing other human beings&#x27; – and that&#x27;s a belief that I shared, I shared it then, I believe it even more strongly today&quot;. McNamara then posits, &quot;How much evil must we do in order to do good? We have certain ideals, certain responsibilities. Recognize that at times you will have to engage in evil, but minimize it.&quot;

Morrison&#x27;s self-immolation at the Pentagon is depicted in the 2002 HBO drama &quot;Path to War&quot;, with Morrison being played by Victor Slezak.
In the omnibus French documentary, &quot;Far from Vietnam&quot; (1967), Morrison&#x27;s widow Anne Welsh appears with her young children in a segment directed by William Klein. Welsh describes the circumstances of her husband&#x27;s death and expresses approval of his act. This footage is interspersed with an interview with a Vietnamese expatriate, Ann Uyen, living in Paris, who describes what Morrison&#x27;s sacrifice meant to the Vietnamese people.

==Memorials==
In the Vietnamese cities of Đà Nẵng and Hồ Chí Minh City, a road is named after Morrison (albeit spelt as &#x27;Morison&#x27; in Ho Chi Minh City). North Vietnam named a Hanoi street after him, and issued a postage stamp in his honor. Possession of the stamp was prohibited in the United States due to the U.S. embargo against North Vietnam.

<text>Roger Allen LaPorte (July 16, 1943 – November 10, 1965) was a protester of the Vietnam War who set himself on fire in front of the United Nations building in New York City on November 9, 1965, to protest the United States involvement in the war. A former seminarian, he was a member of the Catholic Worker Movement at the time of his death.

== Early life ==
Born in Geneva, New York, LaPorte was active in public speaking and debate clubs, for which he won awards. His parents divorced after he graduated from high school. Before joining the Catholic Workers, he had attended a seminary in Vermont and hoped to become a monk. However, he withdrew from the seminary early and attended and graduated from Holy Ghost Academy, Tupper Lake, New York in 1961.

== Background of immolation ==

On June 11, 1963 Thích Quảng Đức, a Vietnamese Mahayana Buddhist monk burned himself to death at a busy Saigon road intersection. Thích Quảng Đức was protesting the persecution of Buddhists by South Vietnam&#x27;s President Ngô Đình Diệm, a member of the Catholic minority. Photos of his self-immolation were circulated widely across the world and brought attention to the policies of the Diệm regime.

On March 16, 1965, 82-year-old pacifist Alice Herz immolated herself on a Detroit street corner in protest of the escalating Vietnam War. A man and his two boys were driving by and saw her burning and put out the flames. She died of her wounds ten days later. On November 2, 1965, Norman Morrison doused himself in kerosene and set himself on fire below Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara&#x27;s Pentagon office.

== Self-immolation ==
The Morrison self-immolation at the Pentagon was front-page news as Catholic Workers gathered for an antiwar demonstration on Union Square in New York City on November 6, 1965, which LaPorte attended shortly after joining the Catholic Workers. Dorothy Day, the leader of the Catholic Workers, addressed the crowd. &quot;I speak today as one who is old, and who must endorse the courage of the young who themselves are willing to give up their freedom,&quot; Day said. &quot;This very struggle was begun by courage, even in martyrdom, which has been shared by the little children, in the struggle for full freedom and human dignity.&quot;

Catholic Worker Tom Cornell had become known in 1960 for burning his draft card at actions and had repeated the act several times, including for national television cameras during the 1962 Strike for Peace. In October 1965, another Catholic Worker, David Miller, became the first draft-card burner to be arrested under a new federal law banning the practice. Immediately following Day&#x27;s speech on Union Square, Cornell and four others burned their draft cards on the platform. New York hecklers shouted, &quot;Burn yourselves, not your cards.&quot;

Three days later, in front of the Dag Hammarskjold Library at the United Nations in New York, LaPorte composed himself in the position of the Buddhist monks of Vietnam, doused himself with gasoline, and set himself alight. He died the next day at Bellevue Hospital from second- and third-degree burns covering 95 percent of his body. Despite his burns, he remained conscious and able to speak. When asked why he had burned himself, LaPorte calmly replied, &quot;I&#x27;m a Catholic Worker. I&#x27;m against war, all wars. I did this as a religious action.&quot; At the hospital, Catholic Workers sang &quot;This Little Light of Mine.&quot;

Dorothy Day responded to the tragedy with an article in &quot;The Catholic Worker&quot; newspaper entitled, &quot;Suicide or Sacrifice?&quot; &quot;It is not only that many youths and students throughout the country are deeply sensitive to the sufferings of the world,&quot; she wrote. &quot;They have a keen sense that they must be responsible and make a profession of their faith that things do not have to go on as they always havethat men are capable of laying down their lives for others, taking a stand, even when the all-encroaching State and indeed all the world are against them.&quot;

John Leo wrote in the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot; that while the Catholic Workers had been important to the Church, they displayed &quot;a sort of built-in rejection of complexity that I hope was not operative in LaPorte&#x27;s death.&quot; The famous Trappist monk Thomas Merton also took issue with LaPorte&#x27;s act and entered into a prolonged dispute with Day after laying blame for the incident at the feet of the Catholic Worker movement.

<doc id="418332" wikidata="Q1195086" url="?curid=418332" title="The Once and Future King">
<text>The Once and Future King is a collection of fantasy novels by T. H. White about the legend of King Arthur. It is loosely based upon the 1485 work &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; by Sir Thomas Malory. It was first published in 1958 as a collection of shorter novels that were published from 1938 to 1940, with some new or amended material. The title refers to a legend that Arthur will one day return as king.

==Plot==
Most of the book takes place in Gramarye, the name that White gives to Britain, and chronicles the youth and education of King Arthur, his rule as a king, and the romance between Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere. The story starts in the final years of the rule of King Uther Pendragon. 

=== &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; ===
The first part, &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (first published 1938), chronicles Arthur&#x27;s upbringing by his foster father Sir Ector, his rivalry and friendship with his foster brother Kay, and his initial training by Merlyn, a wizard who lives through time backwards. Merlyn, knowing the boy&#x27;s destiny, teaches Arthur (known as &quot;Wart&quot;) what it means to be a good king by turning him into various kinds of animals: fish, hawk, ant, goose, and badger. Each of the transformations is meant to teach Wart a lesson, which will prepare him for his future life. Merlyn instills in Arthur the concept that the only justifiable reason for war is to prevent another from going to war and that contemporary human governments and powerful people exemplify the worst aspects of the rule of Might.

=== &quot;The Queen of Air and Darkness&quot; ===
White sets the stage for Arthur&#x27;s demise by introducing the Orkney clan and detailing Arthur&#x27;s seduction by their mother, his half-sister Queen Morgause. While the young king suppresses initial rebellions, Merlyn leads him to envision a means of harnessing potentially destructive Might for the cause of Right: the chivalric order of the Round Table.

=== &quot;The Ill-Made Knight&quot; ===
The focus shifts from King Arthur to the story of Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere&#x27;s forbidden love, the means they adopt to hide their affair from the King (although he already knows of it from Merlyn), and its effect on Elaine, Lancelot&#x27;s sometime lover and the mother of his son Galahad.

=== &quot;The Candle in the Wind&quot; ===
Mordred&#x27;s hatred of his father and Sir Agravaine&#x27;s hatred of Lancelot cause the eventual downfall of Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, and the entire ideal kingdom of Camelot. The &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; is an allegory to the hope of progress. Arthur sends little Tom (Sir Thomas Mallory) to be a vessel and carry on his ideas from his famous round table.

=== &quot;The Book of Merlyn&quot; ===
Published separately following White&#x27;s death, this book chronicles Arthur&#x27;s final lessons from Merlyn.

==Reception==
Floyd C. Gale praised &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; as &quot;blithely comic and entirely delightful&quot;, stating that it was &quot;in utter contrast to the mounting tragedy&quot; of the other three volumes of the series. Fantasy historian Lin Carter called it &quot;the single finest fantasy novel written in our time, or for that matter, ever written.&quot; Constance Grady of Vox also praised the novel, stating: &quot;White was writing for a post–World War II audience, but his book has a vigor and clarity that makes it an urgent and important read today.&quot;

==Adaptations==
Although Walt Disney initially purchased the film rights to &quot;The Ill-Made Knight&quot; in 1944, he produced an adaptation of &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, released in 1963.

Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe&#x27;s 1960 musical &quot;Camelot&quot; (which was made into a movie in 1967) is based mostly on the last two books of &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; and features White&#x27;s idea of having Thomas Malory make a cameo appearance at the end, again as &quot;Tom of Warwick&quot;.

BBC Radio produced a dramatised version of &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; for Children&#x27;s Hour shortly after its publication in 1938. Incidental music for the serial was specially composed by Benjamin Britten.

A two-hour version of &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, dramatised by Neville Teller, was first broadcast as a &quot;Saturday Night Theatre&quot; on Boxing Day, 1981. Michael Hordern played Merlyn and Toby Robertson was the Wart. The cast included Pauline Letts, David Davis, Jeffrey Segal and Lewis Stringer. Benjamin Britten&#x27;s incidental music, played by the English Sinfonia, was used in the production, which was by Graham Gauld.

BBC Radio 4 serialised the book in six one-hour episodes dramatised by Brian Sibley, beginning on Sunday 9 November 2014 with Paul Ready as Arthur and David Warner as Merlyn.

<doc id="418333" wikidata="Q983119" url="?curid=418333" title="Irwin Cotler">
<text>Irwin Cotler (born 8 May 1940) is a retired Canadian politician who was Member of Parliament for Mount Royal from 1999 to 2015. He served as the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada from 2003 until the Liberal government of Paul Martin lost power following the 2006 federal election. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election in November 1999, winning 92% of votes cast.

==Early life and education==
The son of a lawyer, Cotler was born in Montreal, Quebec to a Jewish family. As a child, Cotler&#x27;s father brought him to Delorimier Stadium in 1946 where the two saw Jackie Robinson on the field, with Cotler saying this moment inspired his interest in civil liberties as he and his father discussed anti-racism.

Cotler received his B.A. (1961) and BCL (1964) degree from McGill University and was an editor of the &quot;McGill Law Journal&quot;. He then graduated from Yale Law School with an LL.M.

==Career==

=== Academia ===
After working as a speechwriter for federal Minister of Justice John Turner from 1968 until 1972, Cotler entered academia in 1970 beginning his career as an associate professor at Osgoode Hall Law School. Cotler was a professor of law at McGill University and the director of its Human Rights Program from 1973 until his election as a Member of Parliament in 1999 for the Liberal Party of Canada. He has also been a visiting professor at Harvard Law School, a Woodrow Wilson Fellow at Yale Law School and is the recipient of eleven honorary doctorates.

=== Political career ===
Cotler served on the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and its Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Development, as well as on the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. In 2000, he was appointed special advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs on the International Criminal Court.

==== Minister of Justice ====

On 12 December 2003, Prime Minister Paul Martin appointed him to Cabinet as Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. He recommended the appointment of two women to the Supreme Court of Canada: Louise Charron and Rosalie Abella, Canada&#x27;s first Jewish woman Supreme Court justice. Cotler attempted to introduce several bills to decriminalize marijuana. As Minister of Justice, Cotler tabled Canada&#x27;s first-ever National Justice Initiative Against Racism, in parallel with the government&#x27;s National Action Plan Against Racism. He was tasked with improving relations with the indigenous peoples in Canada and implemented a policy &quot;known as the seven R’s: recognition, respect, redress, representation, responsiveness, reconciliation and relationships.&quot;

As Minister of Justice, Cotler presided over many legislative changes concerning national security. This included proposed changes to privacy legislation known as &quot;Lawful Access&quot; to give police and intelligence officers the tools to conduct surveillance of electronic communications for law enforcement and national security purposes.

In early 2005, Cotler intervened in the senate review of Canada&#x27;s 2001 Anti-Terrorism Act, as mandated by section 145 of the bill. This law, adopted in the wake of the September 11 attacks, had been criticized by some human rights groups and defense lawyers, as an unreasonable trade-off between security and freedom. In his speech to the senate committee on the matter, Cotler rejected these concerns, arguing that &quot;there is no contradiction in the protection of security and the protection of human rights&quot;.

==== Liberal Party ====
On 22 February 2006, the Liberal Party appointed Cotler Critic for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness in the opposition shadow cabinet for the 39th Canadian Parliament. On 18 January 2007, Cotler was appointed Critic for Human Rights by newly elected leader Stéphane Dion.

Cotler was re-elected to Parliament in the 2008 election to represent the Mount Royal riding in Quebec with 55% of the vote, In January 2009, Cotler was named Special Counsel on Human Rights and International Justice for the Liberal Party, under Michael Ignatieff, and subsequently Critic for Human Rights. 

He was re-elected again in the 2011 election, fending off a serious challenge from former city councillor Saulie Zajdel, a longtime Liberal supporter running as a Conservative who lost by only 2,500 votes. It was only the third time that the Liberals had been seriously threatened in Mount Royal since 1940, and the closest that a centre-right party has come to winning anywhere in Montreal since 1993. 

In May 2011, Cotler was named Justice and Human Rights Critic by interim Liberal leader Bob Rae. Cotler also chaired the Inter-Parliamentary Group for Human Rights in Iran, the Inter-Parliamentary Group of Justice for Sergei Magnitsky, and the All-Party Save Darfur Coalition.

In 2013, Cotler was chosen to represent the Liberal Party of Canada at the funeral of Nelson Mandela in deference to the work he allegedly did for and with Mandela in fighting Apartheid. Party Leader Justin Trudeau gave up his seat for him.

On 5 February 2014, Cotler announced he was not running in the 42nd Canadian federal election. He said he would remain &quot;active in public life, lecturing and writing on the issues of the day, advancing the causes of human rights and international justice, and advocating on behalf of political prisoners.&quot;

== Post-political career ==
Cotler was one of thirteen Canadians banned from traveling to Russia under retaliatory sanctions imposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2014. He replied through his official Twitter feed, &quot;I see my travel ban from Russia as a badge of honour, not a mark of exclusion.&quot;

In November 2024, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told Cotler that it had stopped an assassination attempt on him by the Iranian government the previous month. Cotler, a fierce critic of the Iranian government, confirmed that he had been under police protection for more than a year.

== Activism ==

=== Human rights ===
Cotler is on the Board of Advancing Human Rights. Cotler spoke at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy on several occasions.

=== Jewish and Israel activism ===
Cotler is a past president of the Canadian Jewish Congress, a member of MEMRI&#x27;s Board of Advisors, an Honorary Member of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation, serves as a member of the Advisory Board of the Genesis Prize Foundation and is a board member of the Israel Council on Foreign Relations. Studying antisemitism, Cotler separated it into six categories and found thirteen indices of discrimination against Jews that characterizes the &quot;new anti-Jewishness&quot;.

In 1986 he was named chief counsel to the Canadian Jewish Congress at the Deschênes Commission of Inquiry on Nazi war criminals. 

Cotler worked with a group of international jurists to indict Iranian President Ahmadinejad for incitement to genocide under the UN Charter and the Genocide Convention, saying that the Iranian government used anti-Jewish rhetoric similar to the Nazi Party. Cotler chaired a commission called the &quot;Responsibility to Prevent Coalition&quot;, which released a petition in 2009 entitled &quot;The Danger of a Genocidal and Nuclear Iran: A Responsibility to Prevent Petition&quot;. The petition was signed by Elie Wiesel, Former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour, and the former Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Per Ahlmark, and historian Yehuda Bauer. Cotler is an advisory board member of United Against Nuclear Iran and the Counter Extremism Project.

In 2012, Cotler advised Canadian foreign minister John Baird on rejecting the recognition of the State of Palestine during a United Nations meeting.

Cotler is a close friend of American lawyer Alan Dershowitz; the two met at Yale University in the 1960s. Dershowitz&#x27;s book &quot;Abraham&quot; was dedicated to Cotler, who Dershowitz described as &quot;a modern-day Abraham.&quot; In 2016, the two were named by &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; as &quot;perhaps, the two most eloquent international advocates for Israel and human rights.&quot; Dershowitz nominated Cotler for the Nobel Peace Prize the same year.

In 2016, Irwin Cotler drafted the &quot;&#x27;Never Again&#x27; Declaration&quot;, which has been signed by justice ministers, parliamentarians, jurists, and Luis Moreno Ocampo, former International Criminal Court prosecutor.

Cotler has been criticized as being anti-Palestinian, though he denied the description, saying he supports a two-state solution and criticized the Palestinian National Authority, saying &quot;unfortunately, the Palestinian leadership has never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity.&quot; 

In January 2024, he criticized South Africa&#x27;s ICJ genocide case against Israel, saying that &quot;Israel consistently seeks to minimize harm to civilians [in Gaza] using measures including leaflets, messages and phone calls to urge civilians to evacuate targeted areas, creating humanitarian zones and corridors, and facilitating humanitarian aid.&quot;

=== Prisoner representation ===
Cotler began representing notable prisoners with the Natan Sharansky case, who was imprisoned in the Soviet gulag for Jewish activism. In 1977, Sharansky&#x27;s wife asked Cotler to represent Natan when the two met in Israel. Cotler went to the Soviet Union in 1979 to represent Sharansky, though he was deported. Sharansky was released in 1986 by Mikhail Gorbachev and went on to become Israeli Deputy Prime Minister. According to Cotler, the case taught him that &quot;[i]t was very important for mobilizing public opinion&quot; and that &quot;[t]he tipping point for the release of political prisoners is not necessarily the injustice of the case, ... It’s when you can make the case that it’s in their self-interest to release the prisoner because it’s costing them.&quot;

In 1981, Cotler visited South Africa after being invited by anti-apartheid activists, being detained after giving the speech titled &quot;If Sharansky, Why Not Mandela?&quot; At the request of Nelson Mandela&#x27;s South African legal team, Cotler took on the role of &quot;Canadian counsel&quot; to Mandela at the end of the visit, participating in anti-apartheid activities in Canada and advocating on Mandela&#x27;s behalf with Amnesty International. The claim that Cotler was arrested or ever represented Mandela in any capacity has been disputed by the Nelson Mandela Foundation and two prominent South African lawyers, including a surviving member of Mandela&#x27;s legal team. However, in 1986, United Press International reported that Alan Dershowitz and Cotler were involved in an attempt to negotiate Mandela&#x27;s release through a prisoner exchange.

Cotler went on to represent other imprisoned individuals, including Jacobo Timmerman in Latin America, Muchtar Pakpahan in Asia. Saad Eddin Ibrahim, an Egyptian democracy activist imprisoned by the Egyptian government, was represented by Cotler and acquitted in 2003. He acted as counsel to Maher Arar during part of Arar&#x27;s imprisonment and supported demands for a public inquiry. He has also defended both Palestinians and Israelis against their own governments, and participated in a minor role in the Camp David peace agreement between Israel and Egypt.

Imprisoned Venezuelan opposition politician Leopoldo López chose Cotler to serve as an attorney on his defense team in 2015. In 2017, Cotler was then asked to join a panel of independent international experts designated by Luis Almagro, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, to determine whether there was reasonable ground to believe that crimes against humanity have been committed in Venezuela.

==Personal life==
Cotler&#x27;s wife, Ariela (&quot;née&quot; Ze&#x27;evi), is a native of Jerusalem and worked as a legislative assistant to Likud members of the Israeli Knesset from 1967-79. The two met at a lunch with the Knesset in 1977; Cotler was asked to deliver a letter from Egyptian president Anwar Sadat to the Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, a letter that included peace negotiation proposals. The two married on 26 March 1979, the day that the Egypt–Israel peace treaty was signed. Cotler became a step-father to Ariela&#x27;s daughter Michal Cotler-Wunsh, who he adopted when the couple moved to Montreal, and the two had three other children; Gila, Tanya and Jonathan. Cotler-Wunsh is an attorney and a PhD candidate in law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She was a Member of the Knesset for the Blue and White alliance during the 23rd Knesset, from 2020 until 2021.

== Awards and achievements ==
Cotler was appointed in 1992 as an Officer of the Order of Canada. He received fifteen honorary doctorate degrees. Cotler received an honorary doctorate from McGill University on 30 May 2019, and gave the commencement address during the Faculty of Law&#x27;s convocation ceremony. In 2022, he was profiled in the documentary film &quot;First to Stand: The Cases and Causes of Irwin Cotler&quot;. In 2023, he was awarded Israel&#x27;s Presidential Medal of Honour by Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Also in 2023, he was awarded the Lantos Human Rights Prize.

<doc id="418334" wikidata="Q380675" url="?curid=418334" title="Cinema of the United States">
<text>The cinema of the United States, primarily associated with major film studios collectively referred to as Hollywood, has significantly influenced the global film industry since the early 20th century.

Classical Hollywood cinema, a filmmaking style developed in the 1910s, continues to shape many American films today. While French filmmakers Auguste and Louis Lumière are often credited with modern cinema&#x27;s origins, American filmmaking quickly rose to global dominance. As of 2017, more than 600 English-language films were released annually in the U.S., making it the fourth-largest producer of films, trailing only India, Japan, and China. Although the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand also produce English-language films, they are not directly part of the Hollywood system. Due to this global reach, Hollywood is frequently regarded as a transnational cinema with some films released in multiple language versions, such as Spanish and French.

Contemporary Hollywood frequently outsources production to countries including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The five major film studios—Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., Walt Disney Studios, and Sony Pictures—are media conglomerates that dominate U.S. box office revenue and have produced some of the most commercially successful film and television programs worldwide.

In 1894, the world&#x27;s first commercial motion-picture exhibition was held in New York City using Thomas Edison&#x27;s kinetoscope and kinetograph. In the following decades, the production of silent films greatly expanded. New studios formed, migrated to California, and began to create longer films. The United States produced the world&#x27;s first sync-sound musical film, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; in 1927, and was at the forefront of sound-film development in the following decades.

Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has primarily been based in and around the thirty-mile zone, centered in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles County, California. The director D. W. Griffith was central to the development of a film grammar. Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) is frequently cited in critics&#x27; polls as the greatest film of all time. Hollywood is widely regarded as the oldest hub of the film industry, where most of the earliest studios and production companies originated, and is the birthplace of numerous cinematic genres.

==History==
===Origins and Fort Lee===

The earliest recorded instance of motion capture was Eadweard Muybridge’s series of photographs depicting a running horse, which he took in Palo Alto, California using a set of still cameras placed in a row. Muybridge&#x27;s accomplishment led inventors everywhere to attempt to make similar devices. In the United States, Thomas Edison was among the first to produce such a device, the kinetoscope and kinetograph.
The history of cinema in the United States can trace its roots to the East Coast, where, at one time, Fort Lee, New Jersey, was the motion-picture capital of America. The American film industry began at the end of the 19th century, with the construction of Thomas Edison&#x27;s &quot;Black Maria&quot;, the first motion-picture studio in West Orange, New Jersey. The cities and towns on the Hudson River and Hudson Palisades offered land at costs considerably less than New York City across the river and benefited greatly as a result of the phenomenal growth of the film industry at the turn of the 20th century.

The industry began attracting both capital and innovative workforces. In 1907, when the Kalem Company began using Fort Lee as a location for filming in the area, other filmmakers quickly followed. In 1909, a forerunner of Universal Studios, the Champion Film Company, built the first studio. Others quickly followed and either built new studios or leased facilities in Fort Lee. In the 1910s and 1920s, film companies such as the Independent Moving Pictures Company, Peerless Pictures Studios, Solax Studios, Eclair, Goldwyn Pictures Corporation, Star Film (Georges Méliès), World Film Company, Biograph Studios, Fox Film Corporation, Société Pathé Frères, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc., Victor Film Company, and Selznick International Pictures were all making pictures in Fort Lee. Many notable actors, such as Mary Pickford, got their start at Biograph Studios.

In New York, the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, which was built during the silent film era, was used by the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields. The Edison Studios were located in the Bronx. Chelsea, Manhattan, was also frequently used.

Other Eastern cities, most notably Chicago and Cleveland, also served as early centers for film production.

In the West, California was already quickly emerging as a major film production center. In Colorado, Denver was home to the Art-O-Graf Film Company, and Walt Disney&#x27;s early Laugh-O-Gram Studio was based in Kansas City, Missouri.

From 1908, Jacksonville, Florida&#x27;s motion picture industry saw more than 30 silent film companies establish studios in town, including Kalem Studios, Metro Pictures (later MGM), Edison Studios, Majestic Films, King-Bee Films Corporation, Vim Comedy Company, Norman Studios, Gaumont Film Company and the Lubin Manufacturing Company.

Picture City, Florida was a planned site for a movie picture production center in the 1920s, but due to the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, the idea collapsed and Picture City, Florida returned to its original name of Hobe Sound. An attempt to establish a film production center in Detroit also proved unsuccessful.

The film patent wars of the early 20th century helped the spread of film companies to other parts of the US, outside New York. Many filmmakers worked with equipment for which they did not own the rights to use. Therefore, filming in New York could be dangerous, as it was close to Edison&#x27;s company headquarters and close to the agents the company sent out to seize cameras.

An alternative was Los Angeles, which had mild winters, a large selection of places to film, and, most importantly, it was only 90 miles to the border of Mexico, in case they needed to flee from Edison&#x27;s enforcement agents. By 1912, most major film companies had set up production facilities in Southern California, near or in Los Angeles, because of the region&#x27;s favorable year-round weather.

===Rise of Hollywood===
The 1908 Selig Polyscope Company production of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo,&quot; directed by Francis Boggs and starring Hobart Bosworth, was claimed as the first to have been filmed in Los Angeles, in 1907. A plaque was unveiled by the city, in 1957, at Dearden&#x27;s flagship store on the corner of Main Street and 7th Street, to mark the filming on the site when it had been a Chinese laundry. Bosworth&#x27;s widow suggested the city had got the date and location wrong, and that the film was actually shot in nearby Venice, which at the time was an independent city. &quot;In the Sultan&#x27;s Power,&quot; directed by Boggs for Selig Polyscope Company, also starring Bosworth, is considered the first film shot entirely in Los Angeles, with shooting at 7th and Olive Streets, in 1909.

In early 1910, director D. W. Griffith was sent by the Biograph Company to the West Coast with his acting troupe, consisting of actors Blanche Sweet, Lillian Gish, Mary Pickford, Lionel Barrymore, and others. They started filming on a vacant lot near Georgia Street in downtown Los Angeles. While there, the company decided to explore new territories, traveling several miles north to Hollywood: a little village that was friendly and enjoyed the movie company filming there. Griffith then filmed the first movie ever shot in Hollywood, &quot;In Old California&quot;, a Biograph melodrama about California in the 19th century, when the state was under Mexican rule. Griffith stayed there for months and made several films before returning to New York. Also in 1910, Selig Polyscope Company of Chicago established the first film studio in the Los Angeles area in Edendale, and the first studio in Hollywood opened in 1912. After hearing about Griffith&#x27;s success in Hollywood, in 1913, many movie-makers headed west to avoid the fees imposed by Thomas Edison, who owned patents on the movie-making process. Nestor Studios of Bayonne, New Jersey, built the first studio in the Hollywood neighborhood in 1911. Nestor Studios, owned by David and William Horsley, later merged with Universal Studios; and William Horsley&#x27;s other company, Hollywood Film Laboratory, is now the oldest existing company in Hollywood, presently called the Hollywood Digital Laboratory. California&#x27;s more hospitable and cost-effective climate led to the eventual shift of virtually all filmmaking to the West Coast by the 1930s. At the time, Thomas Edison owned almost all the patents relevant to motion picture production and movie producers on the East Coast acting independently of Edison&#x27;s Motion Picture Patents Company were often sued or enjoined by Edison and his agents while movie makers working on the West Coast could work independently of Edison&#x27;s control.
In Los Angeles, the studios and Hollywood grew. Before World War I, films were made in several American cities, but filmmakers tended to gravitate towards southern California as the industry developed. They were attracted by the warm, predictable climate with reliable sunlight, which made it possible to film outdoors year-round. War damage contributed to the decline of the then-dominant European film industry, in favor of the United States, where infrastructure was still intact. The stronger early public health response to the 1918 flu epidemic by Los Angeles compared to other American cities reduced the number of cases there and resulted in a faster recovery, contributing to the increasing dominance of Hollywood over New York City. During the pandemic, public health officials temporarily closed movie theaters in some jurisdictions, large studios suspended production for weeks at a time, and some actors came down with the flu. This caused major financial losses and severe difficulties for small studios, but the industry as a whole more than recovered during the Roaring Twenties.

In the early 20th century, when the medium was new, many Jewish immigrants found employment in the US film industry. They were able to make their mark in a brand-new business: the exhibition of short films in storefront theaters called nickelodeons, after their admission price of a nickel (five cents). Within a few years, men like Samuel Goldwyn, William Fox, Carl Laemmle, Adolph Zukor, Louis B. Mayer, and the Warner Brothers (Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack) had switched to the production side of the business. Soon they were the heads of a new kind of enterprise: the movie studio. The US had at least two female directors, producers, and studio heads in these early years: Lois Weber and French-born Alice Guy-Blaché. They also set the stage for the industry&#x27;s internationalism; the industry is often accused of Amerocentric provincialism.

Other movie makers arrived from Europe after World War I: directors like Ernst Lubitsch, Alfred Hitchcock, Fritz Lang and Jean Renoir; and actors like Rudolph Valentino, Marlene Dietrich, Ronald Colman, and Charles Boyer. They joined a homegrown supply of actors—lured west from the New York City stage after the introduction of sound films—to form one of the 20th century&#x27;s most remarkable growth industries. At motion pictures&#x27; height of popularity in the mid-1940s, the studios were cranking out a total of about 400 movies a year, seen by an audience of 90 million Americans per week.
Sound also became widely used in Hollywood in the late 1920s. After &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, the first film with synchronized voices was successfully released as a Vitaphone talkie in 1927, Hollywood film companies would respond to Warner Bros. and begin to use Vitaphone sound—which Warner Bros. owned until 1928—in future films. By May 1928, Electrical Research Product Incorporated (ERPI), a subsidiary of the Western Electric company, had a monopoly over film sound distribution.

A side effect of these &quot;talkies&quot; was that many actors who had made their careers in silent films suddenly found themselves out of work, as they often had bad voices or could not remember their lines. Meanwhile, in 1922, US politician Will H. Hays left politics and formed the movie studio boss organization known as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA). The organization became the Motion Picture Association of America after Hays retired in 1945.

In the early times of talkies, American studios found that their sound productions were rejected in foreign-language markets and even among speakers of other dialects of English. The synchronization technology was still too primitive for dubbing. One of the solutions was creating parallel foreign-language versions of Hollywood films. Around 1930, the American companies opened a studio in Joinville-le-Pont, France, where the same sets and wardrobe and even mass scenes were used for different time-sharing crews.

Also, foreign unemployed actors, playwrights, and winners of photogenic contests were chosen and brought to Hollywood, where they shot parallel versions of English-language films. These parallel versions had a lower budget, were shot at night, and were directed by second-line American directors who did not speak a foreign language. The Spanish-language crews included people like Luis Buñuel, Enrique Jardiel Poncela, Xavier Cugat, and Edgar Neville. The productions were not very successful in their intended markets, due to the following reasons:

* The lower budgets were apparent.
* Many theater actors had no previous experience in cinema.
* The original movies were often second-rate themselves since studios expected that the top productions would sell by themselves.
* The mix of foreign accents (Castilian, Mexican, and Chilean for example in the Spanish case) was odd for the audiences.
* Some markets lacked sound-equipped theaters.

===Classical Hollywood Cinema and the Golden Age of Hollywood===
Classical Hollywood cinema, or the Golden Age of Hollywood, is defined as a technical and narrative style characteristic of American cinema from 1913 to 1962, during which thousands of movies were issued from the Hollywood studios. The Classical style began to emerge in 1913, was accelerated in 1917 after the U.S. entered World War I and finally solidified when the film &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was released in 1927, ending the silent film era and increasing box-office profits for the film industry by introducing sound to feature films.

Most Hollywood pictures adhered closely to a formula—Western, slapstick comedy, musical, animated cartoon, biographical—and the same creative teams often worked on films made by the same studio. For example, Cedric Gibbons and Herbert Stothart always worked on MGM films, Alfred Newman worked at 20th Century Fox for twenty years, Cecil B. De Mille&#x27;s films were almost all made at Paramount, and director Henry King&#x27;s films were mostly made for 20th Century Fox.

At the same time, one could usually guess which studio made which film, largely because of the actors who appeared in it; MGM, for example, claimed it had contracted &quot;more stars than there are in heaven.&quot; Each studio had its own style and characteristic touches which made it possible to know this—a trait that rarely exists today.

For example, &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944) is notable not only for the first pairing of actors Humphrey Bogart (1899–1957) and Lauren Bacall (1924–2014), but because it was written by two future winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature: Ernest Hemingway (1899–1961), the author of the novel on which the script was nominally based, and William Faulkner (1897–1962), who worked on the screen adaptation.

After &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; was released in 1927, Warner Bros. gained huge success and were able to acquire their own string of movie theaters after purchasing Stanley Theaters and First National Productions in 1928. In contrast, Loews theaters owned MGM since forming in 1924, while the Fox Film Corporation owned the Fox Theatre. RKO (a 1928 merger between Keith-Orpheum Theaters and the Radio Corporation of America) also responded to the Western Electric/ERPI monopoly over sound in films, and developed their own method, known as Photophone, to put sound in films.

Paramount, which acquired Balaban and Katz in 1926, would answer to the success of Warner Bros. and RKO by purchasing a number of theaters in the late 1920s, and would hold a monopoly on theaters in Detroit, Michigan. By the 1930s, almost all of the first-run metropolitan theaters in the United States were owned by the Big Five studios—MGM, Paramount Pictures, RKO, Warner Bros., and 20th Century Fox.

====Rise and decline of the studio system====

Motion picture companies operated under the studio system. The major studios kept thousands of people on salary—actors, producers, directors, writers, stuntmen, craftspersons, and technicians. They owned or leased Movie Ranches in rural Southern California for location shooting of westerns and other large-scale genre films, and the major studios owned hundreds of theaters in cities and towns across the nation in 1920 film theaters that showed their films and that were always in need of fresh material.
In 1930, MPPDA President Will Hays created the Hays (Production) Code, which followed censorship guidelines and went into effect after government threats of censorship expanded by 1930. However, the code was never enforced until 1934 after the Catholic watchdog organization The Legion of Decency—appalled by some of the provocative films and lurid advertising of the era later classified Pre-Code Hollywood—threatened a boycott of motion pictures if it did not go into effect. The films that did not obtain a seal of approval from the Production Code Administration had to pay a $25,000 fine () and could not profit in the theaters, as the MPPDA controlled every theater in the country through the Big Five studios.

Throughout the 1930s, as well as most of the golden age, MGM dominated the film screen and had the top stars in Hollywood, and they were also credited for creating the Hollywood star system altogether. Some MGM stars included &quot;King of Hollywood&quot; Clark Gable, Lionel Barrymore, Jean Harlow, Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Jeanette MacDonald, Gene Raymond, Spencer Tracy, Judy Garland, and Gene Kelly.

Another great achievement of American cinema during this era came through Walt Disney&#x27;s animation company. In 1937, Disney created the most successful film of its time, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. This distinction was promptly topped in 1939 when Selznick International created what is still, when adjusted for inflation, the most successful film of all time in Gone with the Wind.

Many film historians have remarked upon the many great works of cinema that emerged from this period of highly regimented filmmaking. One reason this was possible is that, with so many movies being made, not everyone had to be a big hit. A studio could gamble on a medium-budget feature with a good script and relatively unknown actors: &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, directed by Orson Welles (1915–1985) and often regarded as the greatest film of all time, fits this description. In other cases, strong-willed directors like Howard Hawks (1896–1977), Alfred Hitchcock (1899–1980), and Frank Capra (1897–1991) battled the studios in order to achieve their artistic visions.

The apogee of the studio system may have been the year 1939, which saw the release of such classics as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot;, &quot;Ninotchka&quot; and &quot;Midnight&quot;. Among the other films from the Golden Age period that are now considered to be classics: &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, the original &quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, &quot;Top Hat&quot;, &quot;City Lights&quot;, &quot;Red River&quot;, &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot;, &quot;Rear Window&quot;, &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, and &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;.

The studio system and the Golden Age of Hollywood succumbed to two forces that developed in the late 1940s:
* a federal antitrust action that separated the production of films from their exhibition; and
* the advent of television.
In 1938, Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was released during a run of lackluster films from the major studios, and quickly became the highest-grossing film released to that point. Embarrassingly for the studios, it was an independently produced animated film that did not feature any studio-employed stars. This stoked already widespread frustration at the practice of &quot;block-booking&quot;, in which studios would only sell an entire year&#x27;s schedule of films at a time to theaters and use the lock-in to cover for releases of mediocre quality.

Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold—a noted &quot;trust buster&quot; of the Roosevelt administration—took this opportunity to initiate proceedings against the eight largest Hollywood studios in July 1938 for violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The federal suit resulted in five of the eight studios (the &quot;Big Five&quot;: Warner Bros., MGM, Fox, RKO and Paramount) reaching a compromise with Arnold in October 1940 and signing a consent decree agreeing to, within three years:
* Eliminate the block-booking of short film subjects, in an arrangement known as &quot;one shot&quot;, or &quot;full force&quot; block-booking.
* Eliminate the block-booking of any more than five features in their theaters.
* No longer engage in &quot;blind buying&quot; (or the buying of films by theater districts without seeing films beforehand) and instead have &quot;trade-showing&quot;, in which all 31 theater districts in the US would see films every two weeks before showing movies in theaters.
* Set up an administration board in each theater district to enforce these requirements.
The &quot;Little Three&quot; (Universal Studios, United Artists, and Columbia Pictures), who did not own any theaters, refused to participate in the consent decree. A number of independent film producers were also unhappy with the compromise and formed a union known as the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers and sued Paramount for the monopoly they still had over the Detroit Theaters—as Paramount was also gaining dominance through actors like Bob Hope, Paulette Goddard, Veronica Lake, Betty Hutton, crooner Bing Crosby, Alan Ladd, and longtime actor for studio Gary Cooper too- by 1942. The Big Five studios did not meet the requirements of the Consent of Decree during WWII, without major consequence, but after the war ended they joined Paramount as defendants in the Hollywood antitrust case, as did the Little Three studios.

The United States Supreme Court eventually ruled in &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; that the major studios ownership of theaters and film distribution was a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. As a result, the studios began to release actors and technical staff from their contracts with the studios. This changed the paradigm of filmmaking by the major Hollywood studios, as each could have an entirely different cast and creative team.

The decision resulted in the gradual loss of the characteristics that made Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, Columbia Pictures, RKO Pictures, and 20th Century Fox films immediately identifiable. Certain movie people, such as Cecil B. DeMille, either remained contract artists until the end of their careers or used the same creative teams on their films so that a DeMille film still looked like one whether it was made in 1932 or 1956.

===New Hollywood and post-classical cinema===
Post-classical cinema is the changing methods of storytelling in the New Hollywood. It has been argued that new approaches to drama and characterization played upon audience expectations acquired in the classical period: chronology may be scrambled, storylines may feature &quot;twist endings&quot;, and lines between the antagonist and protagonist may be blurred. The roots of post-classical storytelling may be seen in &quot;film noir&quot;, in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955), and in Hitchcock&#x27;s storyline-shattering &quot;Psycho&quot;.

The New Hollywood is the emergence of a new generation of film school-trained directors who had absorbed the techniques developed in Europe in the 1960s as a result of the French New Wave; the 1967 film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; marked the beginning of American cinema rebounding as well, as a new generation of films would afterward gain success at the box offices as well. Filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Brian De Palma, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, Roman Polanski, and William Friedkin came to produce fare that paid homage to the history of film and developed upon existing genres and techniques. Inaugurated by the 1969 release of Andy Warhol &quot;Blue Movie&quot;, the phenomenon of adult erotic films being publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope), and taken seriously by critics (like Roger Ebert), a development referred to, by Ralph Blumenthal of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as &quot;porno chic&quot;, and later known as the Golden Age of Porn, began, for the first time, in modern American culture. According to award-winning author Toni Bentley, Radley Metzger 1976 film &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot;, based on the play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; by George Bernard Shaw (and its derivative, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;), and due to attaining a mainstream level in storyline and sets, is considered the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of this &#x27;Golden Age&#x27;.

At the height of his fame in the early 1970s, Charles Bronson was the world&#x27;s No. 1 box office attraction, commanding $1 million per film. In the 1970s, the films of New Hollywood filmmakers were often both critically acclaimed and commercially successful. While the early New Hollywood films like &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and &quot;Easy Rider&quot; had been relatively low-budget affairs with amoral heroes and increased sexuality and violence, the enormous success enjoyed by Friedkin with &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, Spielberg with &quot;Jaws&quot;, Coppola with &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, Scorsese with &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, Kubrick with &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, Polanski with &quot;Chinatown&quot;, and Lucas with &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, respectively helped to give rise to the modern &quot;blockbuster&quot;, and induced studios to focus ever more heavily on trying to produce enormous hits.

===Rise of the modern blockbuster and independent films===

In the US, the PG-13 rating was introduced in 1984 to accommodate films that straddled the line between PG and R, which was mainly due to the controversies surrounding the violent content of the PG films &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; and &quot;Gremlins&quot; (both 1984).

Filmmakers in the 1990s had access to technological, political and economic innovations that had not been available in previous decades. &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990) became the first 35 mm feature film with a digital soundtrack. &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992) was the first film to make use of the Dolby Digital six-channel stereo sound that has since become the industry standard. Computer-generated imagery was greatly facilitated when it became possible to transfer film images into a computer and manipulate them digitally. The possibilities became apparent in director James Cameron&#x27;s Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), in images of the shape-changing character T-1000. Computer graphics or CG advanced to a point where &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993) was able to use the techniques to create realistic-looking animals. &quot;Jackpot&quot; (2001) became the first film that was shot entirely in digital. In the film &quot;Titanic&quot;, Cameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects with his film, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology which the director pioneered while working on &quot;The Abyss&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. Many previous films about the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing. Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their miniature of the ship as if &quot;we&#x27;re making a commercial for the White Star Line&quot;.
Even &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; (1999), a low-budget indie horror film by Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick, was a huge financial success. Filmed on a budget of just $35,000, without any big stars or special effects, the film grossed $248  million with the use of modern marketing techniques and online promotion. Though not on the scale of George Lucas&#x27;s $1  billion prequel to the &quot;Star Wars Trilogy&quot;, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; earned the distinction of being the most profitable film of all time, in terms of percentage gross.

The success of &quot;Blair Witch&quot; as an indie project remains among the few exceptions, however, and control of The Big Five studios over filmmaking continued to increase through the 1990s. The Big Six companies all enjoyed a period of expansion in the 1990s. They each developed different ways to adjust to rising costs in the film industry, especially the rising salaries of movie stars, driven by powerful agents. The biggest stars like Sylvester Stallone, Russell Crowe, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sandra Bullock, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mel Gibson, Kevin Bacon, and Julia Roberts received between $15–$20  million per film and in some cases were even given a share of the film&#x27;s profits.

Screenwriters on the other hand were generally paid less than the top actors or directors, usually under $1 million per film. However, the single largest factor driving rising costs was special effects. By 1999 the average cost of a blockbuster film was $60 million before marketing and promotion, which cost another $80 million.

===Contemporary cinema===

Since the beginning of 21st century, the theatrical marketplace has slowly been dominated by the superhero genre. , they are the best-paying productions for actors, because paychecks in other genres have shrunk for even top actors. In 2023 and 2024, however, Hollywood experts pointed to &#x27;superhero fatigue&#x27; as an emerging trend. Actors such as Paul Dano and directors like Matthew Vaughn have made similar arguments.

In 2021, despite the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, blockbuster films such as &quot;Black Widow&quot;, &quot;F9&quot;, &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot; were released in theaters after being postponed from their initial 2020 release dates.

Various studios responded to the crisis with controversial decisions to forgo the theatrical window and give their films day-and-date releases. NBCUniversal released &quot;Trolls World Tour&quot; directly to video-on-demand rental on April 10, while simultaneously receiving limited domestic theatrical screenings via drive-in cinemas; CEO Jeff Shell claims that the film had reached nearly $100 million in revenue within the first three weeks. The decision was opposed by AMC Theatres, which then announced that its screenings of Universal Pictures films would cease immediately, though the two companies would eventually agree to a 2-week theatrical window. By December 2020, Warner Bros. Pictures announced their decision to simultaneously release its slate of 2021 films in both theaters and its streaming site HBO Max for a period of one month in order to maximize viewership. However, by 2023, industry strikes by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) highlighted growing disputes over streaming residuals, AI technology in writing and acting, and fair compensation, reflecting the broader challenges faced by Hollywood&#x27;s evolving economic model. The move was vehemently criticized by various industry figures, many of who were reportedly uninformed of the decision before the announcement and felt deceived by the studio.

2019 onwards has seen the rise of American streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and Apple TV+, which came to rival traditional cinema. Industry commentators have noted the increasing treatment of films as &quot;content&quot; by corporations that correlate with the increased popularity of streaming platforms. This involves the blurring of boundaries between films, television and other forms of media as more people consume them together in a variety of ways, with individual films defined more by their brand identity and commercial potential rather than their medium, stories and artistry. Critic Matt Zoller Seitz has described the release of &quot;&quot; in 2019 as &quot;represent[ing] the decisive defeat of &#x27;cinema&#x27; by &#x27;content due to its grand success as a &quot;piece of entertainment&quot; defined by the Marvel brand that culminates a series of blockbuster films that has traits of serial television.

The films &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; and &quot;Red Notice&quot; have been cited as examples of this treatment, with the former being described by many critics as &quot;a lengthy infomercial for HBO Max&quot;, featuring scenes and characters recalling various Warner Bros. properties such as &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Austin Powers&quot;, while the latter is a $200 million heist film from Netflix that critics described &quot;a movie that feels more processed by a machine [...] instead of anything approaching artistic intent or even an honest desire to entertain.&quot; Some have expressed that &quot;Space Jam&quot; demonstrates the industry&#x27;s increasingly cynical treatment of films as mere intellectual property (IP) to be exploited, an approach which critic Scott Mendelson called &quot;IP for the sake of IP.&quot;

Martin Scorsese has warned that cinema as an art form is &quot;being systematically devalued, sidelined, demeaned, and reduced&quot; to &quot;content&quot; and called blockbusters&#x27; overemphasis on box-office returns &quot;repulsive&quot;. Quentin Tarantino has opined that the current era of cinema is one of the worst in Hollywood history. During a masterclass at the 2023 Sarajevo Film Festival, Charlie Kaufman criticized mainstream blockbusters, stating that &quot;[a]t this point, the only thing that makes money is garbage&quot; and encouraged industry professionals to &quot;make movies outside of the studio system as much as possible&quot;. James Gray noted in an interview with &quot;Deadline,&quot; &quot;When you make movies that only make a ton of money and only one kind of movie, you begin to get a large segment of the population out of the habit of going to the movies&quot;, which causes viewership to decrease, though clarified that he has &quot;no problem with a comic book movie&quot;. As a solution to the lack of &quot;investment in the broad-based engagement with the product&quot;, he suggests that studios &quot;be willing to lose money for a couple of years on art film divisions, and in the end they will be happier.&quot;

==Hollywood and politics==
In the 1930s and 1940s, the Democrats and the Republicans alike saw political opportunities in Hollywood and President Franklin Roosevelt was an early adopter, capitalizing on Hollywood&#x27;s stars in a national campaign. Melvyn Douglas and his wife Helen toured Washington, D.C., in 1939 and met the key New Dealers.

Endorsement letters from leading actors were signed, and radio appearances and printed advertising were made. Movie stars were used to draw a large audience into the political view of the party. By the 1960s, John F. Kennedy was a new, young face for Washington, and his strong friendship with Frank Sinatra exemplified this new era of glamour. The last moguls of Hollywood were gone, and younger, newer executives and producers began pushing more liberal ideas.

Celebrities and money attracted politicians to the high-class, glittering Hollywood lifestyle. As Ron Brownstein wrote in his book &quot;The Power and the Glitter&quot;, television in the 1970s and 1980s was an enormously important new media in politics and Hollywood helped in that media with actors making speeches on their political beliefs, like Jane Fonda against the Vietnam War. Despite most celebrities and producers being left-leaning and tending to support the Democratic Party, this era produced some Republican actors and producers such as Clint Eastwood and Jerry Bruckheimer. Support groups such as the Friends of Abe were set up to support conservative causes in Hollywood, which is perceived as biased against conservatives. Former actor Ronald Reagan became governor of California and subsequently became the 40th president of the United States. It continued with Arnold Schwarzenegger as California&#x27;s governor in 2003.

===Political donations===

Today, donations from Hollywood help to fund federal politics. On February 20, 2007, for example, Democratic then-presidential candidate Barack Obama had a $2,300-a-plate Hollywood gala, being hosted by DreamWorks founders David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Steven Spielberg at the Beverly Hilton.

== Criticisms ==
=== Covert advertising ===
Native advertising is information designed to persuade in more subtle ways than classic propaganda. A modern example common in the United States is Copaganda, in which TV shows display unrealistically flattering portrayals of law enforcement, in part to borrow equipment and get their assistance in blocking off streets to more easily film on location. Other reputation laundering accusations have been leveled in the entertainment industry, including burnishing the image of the Mafia.

Product placement also has been a point of criticism, with the tobacco industry promoting smoking on screen. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cites that 18% of teen smokers would not start smoking if films with smoking were automatically given an &#x27;R&#x27; rating, which would save 1 million lives.

===Censorship===


Hollywood producers sometimes seek to comply with the Chinese government&#x27;s censorship requirements in a bid to access the country&#x27;s restricted and lucrative cinema market, with the second-largest box office in the world as of 2016. This includes prioritizing sympathetic portrayals of Chinese characters in movies, such as changing the villains in &quot;Red Dawn&quot; from Chinese to North Koreans. Due to many topics forbidden in China, such as Dalai Lama and Winnie-the-Pooh being involved in the South Park&#x27;s episode &quot;Band in China&quot;, South Park was entirely banned in China after the episode&#x27;s broadcast. The 2018 film &quot;Christopher Robin&quot;, the new Winnie-the-Pooh movie, was denied a Chinese release.

Although Tibet was previously a cause célèbre in Hollywood, featuring in films including &quot;Kundun&quot; and &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, in the 21st century this is no longer the case. In 2016, Marvel Entertainment attracted criticism for its decision to cast Tilda Swinton as &quot;The Ancient One&quot; in the film adaptation &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, using a white woman to play a traditionally Tibetan character. Actor and high-profile Tibet supporter Richard Gere stated that he was no longer welcome to participate in mainstream Hollywood films after criticizing the Chinese government and calling for a boycott of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

==== Historic examples ====
Hollywood also self-censored any negative depictions of Nazis for most of the 1930s in order to maintain access to German audiences. Around that time economic censorship resulted in the self-censoring of content to please the group wielding their economic influence. The Hays Code was an industry-led effort from 1930–1967 to strict self-censorship in order to appease religious objections to certain content and stave off any government censorship that could have resulted.

===Relationship with the military===
===Sexual abuse scandals===
==Global Hollywood==

Political economy of communication researchers have long focused on the international or global presence, power, profitability and popularity of Hollywood films. Books on global Hollywood by Toby Miller and Richard Maxwell, Janet Wasko and Mary Erickson, Kerry Segrave, John Trump Bour and Tanner Mirles examine the international political economy of Hollywood&#x27;s power.

According to Tanner Mirles, Hollywood relies on four capitalist strategies &quot;to attract and integrate non-US film producers, exhibitors and audiences into its ambit: ownership, cross-border productions with subordinate service providers, content licensing deals with exhibitors, and blockbusters designed to travel the globe.&quot;

In 1912, American film companies were largely immersed in the competition for the domestic market. It was difficult to satisfy the huge demand for films created by the nickelodeon boom. Motion Picture Patents Company members such as Edison Studios, also sought to limit competition from French, Italian, and other imported films. Exporting films, then, became lucrative to these companies. Vitagraph Studios was the first American company to open its own distribution offices in Europe, establishing a branch in London in 1906, and a second branch in Paris shortly after.

Other American companies were moving into foreign markets as well, and American distribution abroad continued to expand until the mid-1920s. Originally, a majority of companies sold their films indirectly. However, since they were inexperienced in overseas trading, they simply sold the foreign rights to their films to foreign distribution firms or export agents. Gradually, London became a center for the international circulation of US films.
Many British companies made a profit by acting as the agents for this business, and by doing so, they weakened British production by turning over a large share of the UK market to American films. By 1911, approximately 60 to 70 percent of films imported into Great Britain were American. The United States was also doing well in Germany, Australia, and New Zealand.

More recently, in the last 20th and early 21st century, as globalization intensified and the United States government actively promoted free trade agendas and trade on cultural products, Hollywood became a worldwide cultural source. The success of Hollywood export markets is reflected in the boom of American multinational media corporations across the globe and the ability to make big-budget films that appeal to popular tastes in many different cultures.

Even in a globalized world, global production remained clustered in Hollywood. Contributing factors are that the United States has the largest single home market in dollar terms, entertaining and highly visible Hollywood movies have global appeal, and the role of English as a universal language contributes to compensating for higher fixed costs of production.

Hollywood has moved more deeply into Chinese markets, although influenced by China&#x27;s censorship. Films made in China are censored, strictly avoiding themes like &quot;ghosts, violence, murder, horror, and demons.&quot; Such plot elements risk being cut. Hollywood has had to make &quot;approved&quot; films, corresponding to official Chinese standards, but with aesthetic standards sacrificed to box office profits. Even Chinese audiences found it boring to wait for the release of great American movies dubbed in their native language.

==Role of women==
Women are statistically underrepresented in creative positions in the center of the US film industry, Hollywood. This underrepresentation has been called the &quot;celluloid ceiling&quot;, a variant on the employment discrimination term &quot;glass ceiling&quot;. In 2013, the &quot;top-paid actors ... made times as much money as the top-paid actresses.&quot; Older male actors made more than their female counterparts of the same age, with &quot;female movie stars mak[ing] the most money on average per film at age 34, while male stars earn the most at 51.&quot;

The 2013 Celluloid Ceiling Report conducted by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University collected a list of statistics gathered from &quot;2,813 individuals employed by the 250 top domestic grossing films of 2012.&quot;

Women accounted for:
* &quot;18% of all directors, executive producers, producers, writers, cinematographers, and editors. This reflected no change from 2011 and only a 1% increase from 1998.&quot;
* &quot;9% of all directors.&quot;
* &quot;15% of writers.&quot;
* &quot;25% of all producers.&quot;
* &quot;20% of all editors.&quot;
* &quot;2% of all cinematographers.&quot;
* &quot;38% of films employed 0 or 1 woman in the roles considered, 23% employed 2 women, 28% employed 3 to 5 women, and 10% employed 6 to 9 women.&quot;

A &quot;New York Times&quot; article stated that only 15% of the top films in 2013 had women for a lead acting role. The author of the study noted that &quot;The percentage of female speaking roles has not increased much since the 1940s when they hovered around 25 percent to 28 percent.&quot; &quot;Since 1998, women&#x27;s representation in behind-the-scenes roles other than directing has gone up just 1 percent.&quot; Women &quot;directed the same percent of the 250 top-grossing films in 2012 (9 percent) as they did in 1998.&quot;

==Race and ethnicity==

On May 10, 2021, NBC announced that it would not televise the 79th Golden Globe Awards in 2022 in support of a boycott of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) by multiple media companies over inadequate efforts to address lack of diversity within the membership of the association with people of color, but that it would be open to televise the ceremony in 2023 if the HFPA were successful in its efforts to reform. The HFPA would be disbanded two years later as a result of this and other scandals.

American cinema has often reflected and propagated negative stereotypes towards foreign nationals and ethnic minorities. For example, Russians and Russian Americans are usually portrayed as brutal mobsters, ruthless agents and villains. According to Russian American professor Nina L. Khrushcheva, &quot;You can&#x27;t even turn the TV on and go to the movies without reference to Russians as horrible.&quot; Italians and Italian Americans are usually associated with organized crime and the American Mafia. Hispanic and Latino Americans are largely depicted as sexualized figures such as the Latino macho or the Latina vixen, gang members, (illegal) immigrants, or entertainers. However, representation in Hollywood has improved in recent years, gaining traction in the 1990s, and no longer emphasizes oppression, exploitation, or resistance as primary themes. According to Charles Ramírez Berg, third-wave films &quot;do not accentuate Chicano oppression or resistance; ethnicity in these films exists as one fact of several that shape characters&#x27; lives and stamps their personalities.&quot; Filmmakers like Edward James Olmos and Robert Rodriguez were able to represent the Hispanic and Latino American experience like none had on screen before, and actors like Hilary Swank, Jordana Brewster, Jessica Alba, Camilla Belle, Al Madrigal, Alexis Bledel, Sofía Vergara, Ana de Armas, and Rachel Zegler have become successful. In the last decade, minority filmmakers like Chris Weitz, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, and Patricia Riggen have been given applied narratives. Films that portray Hispanic and Latino Americans include &quot;La Bamba&quot; (1987), &quot;Selena&quot; (1997), &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (1998), &quot;Goal II&quot; (2007), &quot;Overboard&quot; (2018), &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (2022), and Josefina López&#x27;s &quot;Real Women Have Curves&quot;, originally a play which premiered in 1990 and was later released as a film in 2002.

African-American representation in Hollywood improved drastically towards the end of the 20th century after the fall of the studio system and that trend endures in the 21st century as minority representation continues to increase. In old Hollywood, it was not uncommon for white actors to wear black face.
According to Korean American actor Daniel Dae Kim, Asian and Asian American men &quot;have been portrayed as inscrutable villains and asexualized kind of eunuchs.&quot; The Media Action Network for Asian Americans accused the director and studio of &quot;Aloha&quot; of whitewashing the cast of the film, and the director, Cameron Crowe, apologized about Emma Stone being miscast as a character who is meant to be of one quarter Chinese and one quarter Hawaiian descent. Throughout the 20th century, acting roles in film were relatively few, and many available roles were narrow characters. In the 21st century, young Asian American comedians and filmmakers have found an outlet on YouTube allowing them to gain a strong and loyal fanbase among their fellow Asian Americans. Although more recently the film &quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot; has been lauded in the United States for featuring a predominantly Asian cast, it was criticized elsewhere for casting biracial and non-Chinese actors as ethnically Chinese characters. The film &quot;Always Be My Maybe&quot; was lauded for taking familiar rom-com beats and cleverly layering in smart social commentary.

Before the September 11 attacks, Arabs and Arab Americans were often portrayed as terrorists. The decision to hire Naomi Scott, the daughter of an English father and a Gujarati Ugandan-Indian mother, to play the lead of Jasmine in the film &quot;Aladdin&quot; also drew criticism as well as accusations of racism, as some commentators expected the role to go to an actress of Arab or Middle Eastern origin. In January 2018, it was reported that white extras were being applied brown make-up during filming in order to &quot;blend in&quot;, which caused an outcry and condemnation among fans and critics, branding the practice as &quot;an insult to the whole industry&quot; while accusing the producers of not recruiting people with Middle Eastern or North African heritage. Disney responded to the controversy by saying, &quot;Diversity of our cast and background performers was a requirement and only in a handful of instances when it was a matter of specialty skills, safety and control (special effects rigs, stunt performers and handling of animals) were crew made up to blend in.&quot;

==Working conditions==
Hollywood&#x27;s workflow is unique in that much of its workforce does not report to the same factory each day, nor follow the same routine from day to day, but films at distant locations around the world, with a schedule dictated by the scenes being filmed rather than what makes the most sense for productivity. For instance, an urban film shot entirely on location at night would require the bulk of its crews to work a graveyard shift, while a situational comedy series that shoots primarily on stage with only one or two days a week on location would follow a more traditional work schedule. Westerns are often shot in desert locations far from the homes of the crew in areas with limited hotels that necessitate long drives before and after a shooting day, which take advantage of as many hours of sunlight available, ultimately requiring workers to put in 16 or 17 hours a day from the time they leave their home to the time they return.

Amidst a broad decline in the power of organized labor in America in the 20th and early 21st century, all of the major studios have continued to maintain contracts with unions through the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), a trade alliance representing the film studios and television networks. Due to the casual nature of employment in Hollywood, it is only through sectoral bargaining that individual workers can express their rights to minimum wage guarantees and access to pension and health plans that carry over from production to production and offer the studios access to a trained workforce able to step onto a set on day one with the knowledge and experience to handle the highly technical equipment they are asked to operate.

The majority of the workers in Hollywood are represented by several unions and guilds. The 150,000 member-strong International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) represents most of the crafts, such as the grips, electricians, and camera people, as well as editors, sound engineers, and hair &amp; make-up artists. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) is the next largest group representing some 130,000 actors and performers, the Directors Guild of America (DGA) represents the directors and production managers, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) representing writers, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) represents the drivers.

While the relationship between labor and management has generally been amicable over the years, working together with the state to develop safe protocols to continue working during COVID-19 and lobbying together in favor of tax incentives, contract negotiations have reported to get contentious over changes in the industry and as a response to rising income inequality. In 1945 six-month set-decorator strike, the relationship turned bloody between strikers, scabs, strikebreakers, and studio security.

In recent years, Hollywood has faced challenges such as strikes by writers and actors, which have led to significant production cuts and layoffs across the industry. These strikes have resulted in union contracts that offer more money and protections against artificial intelligence, but they have also caused a slowdown in production and a rise in unemployment among film and TV workers.

<text>Charles Harris Steiner (born July 17, 1949) is an American sportscaster and broadcast journalist. He is currently the radio play-by-play announcer for the Los Angeles Dodgers, paired with Rick Monday.

==Early life and education==
Steiner was born in 1949 in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City. He grew up a Brooklyn Dodgers fan in a Jewish family in Malverne, New York, already idolizing Vin Scully at the age of seven. He attended Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, graduating in 1971.

==Early career==
Steiner began his career as a newscaster for WIRL radio in Peoria, in 1969, while still a student at Bradley. In 1971, after graduation from college, he began hosting his first sports show on KSTT radio in Davenport, Iowa. A year later, Steiner moved to New Haven, Connecticut, and worked for WAVZ radio as its news director, before moving north to Hartford and WPOP radio in a similar capacity.

In 1977, Steiner relocated to WERE (1300 AM) in Cleveland, Ohio, where he served as a sportscaster and later news director. While in Cleveland, he received his first television exposure when WKYC-TV hired him as a sports commentator.

Steiner entered the New York market in 1978 at WXLO-FM where he did newscasts for, among others, then-morning host and future actor Jay Thomas. He later moved over to sister station WOR for several years as its morning drive sportscaster, while working simultaneously as the sports director for the RKO Radio Network. He was also the play-by-play voice for the USFL&#x27;s New Jersey Generals entire existence from 1983 to 1985, and for the NFL&#x27;s New York Jets in 1986 and 1987.

It was during his time with RKO Radio that he was involved in a fracas at the conclusion of a press conference after John McEnroe had won his semifinals match at Wimbledon in 1981. Throughout the tournament, McEnroe had consistently requested not to discuss the status of his relationship with then-girlfriend Stacy Margolin. When &quot;Daily Star&quot; gossip columnist James Whittaker persisted in broaching the subject, McEnroe cursed at him and the British media and prematurely ended the press conference by storming out of the room. Steiner confronted Whittaker to say, &quot;C&#x27;mon, man, you are just messing it up for everybody else. We want to get our quotes.&quot; Right at that point, Nigel Clarke, another British reporter who then worked for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, stuck his index finger in Steiner&#x27;s face. Clarke then got up on a chair and attempted to rain punches down on Steiner who successfully wrestled his adversary to the floor. Surprisingly, Steiner later was personally thanked by the head of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club who also had a disdain for the British tabloids.

==Career at ESPN==
Steiner joined ESPN in 1988, primarily as an anchor on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. In addition to those duties, he served as the network&#x27;s lead boxing analyst.

Steiner was involved in many comical situations during his tenure on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, including one broadcast in 1993 when Carl Lewis sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; prior to a New Jersey Nets game. Amused by hearing Lewis&#x27; terrible rendition of the song, Steiner began chortling during the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; show that night, unable to stop until the show ended. His famous comment on the event was that the song had apparently been written by &quot;Francis Scott Off-Key&quot;, a pun on the author of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, Francis Scott Key.

Steiner was featured in a series of well-known television promos from ESPN&#x27;s &quot;This is SportsCenter&quot; comical promo campaign. In 1999, amid fears of the Y2K situation, Steiner starred in a promo where the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; cast spoke about a &quot;contingency plan&quot; at ESPN&#x27;s studios &quot;after&quot; Y2K, and Steiner was featured wearing a tie as a head band (along with &quot;Braveheart&quot;-style face paint) and screaming the phrase &quot;Follow me to freedom!&quot; A second promo featured Steiner being traded from ESPN to &quot;Melrose Place&quot; in exchange for actor Andrew Shue. While Shue delivers a straight-up report on a meeting with Paul Tagliabue, Steiner is then seen wearing shorts and introduces himself to Laura Leighton (in character as Sydney Andrews) as the new &quot;pool boy&quot; in the show&#x27;s apartment complex. Steiner starred in a third promo with boxer Evander Holyfield. In the opening shot, Evander questions Stuart Scott about Steiner&#x27;s assessment that Holyfield is only the &quot;50th best heavyweight of all-time&quot;; Stuart then deadpans that he meant &quot;the 50th best heavyweight — in Georgia&quot;. In the final scene, an angry Holyfield is seen roaming the halls of ESPN screaming, &quot;Charley! Come on out and get your whoopin&#x27;! Charley, come on out! Steiner!&quot; Steiner is seen cowering under a desk. In another promo for the campaign, Steiner talks about how at ESPN the personalities can cover the sports that they enjoy and he says that his is boxing. During the promo several personalities try to pick a fight with him and he walks away from them all until the end when Steiner is getting into his car and Otto the Orange comes up to him and Steiner takes out all of his frustrations out on Otto by punching him square in the face.

On August 9, 2004, Steiner returned to ESPN to co-host an &quot;old school&quot; version of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; with Bob Ley.

Steiner also hosted a program on the NFL Network called &quot;Football America&quot;, which ran from 2003 to 2005. He has also been shown in frequent cuts of interviews for the network&#x27;s NFL Top 10 series, discussing such subjects as former Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau. Cuts of his play-by-play of the Jets&#x27; September 1986 overtime victory (51–45) over the Dolphins are used in retrospectives on that game. Steiner was also interviewed on the 1986 New York Jets–Cleveland Browns playoff game in which he proclaimed the Jets would win following a fourth-quarter touchdown only to see the Browns tie the game and win in double overtime.

==Baseball broadcasting==

===ESPN Radio===
When ESPN Radio gained broadcast rights for Major League Baseball&#x27;s national radio package from CBS in 1998, Steiner became its lead announcer, working Sunday night games, the All-Star Game, and postseason games. (Steiner never worked the World Series while he was calling games for ESPN Radio, however, as those were covered by then-lead TV voice Jon Miller.)

Steiner&#x27;s most controversial home run call came in the 2001 All-Star Game at Safeco Field on July 10. His utterance of &quot;Who wrote this script?&quot; to punctuate Cal Ripken Jr.&#x27;s third-inning homer off Chan-Ho Park fueled speculation about whether the achievement was legitimate or that the pitch was grooved to enable a legendary sendoff.

===New York Yankees (2002–2004)===
Steiner left ESPN in 2002 and joined the New York Yankees&#x27; radio booth, replacing Michael Kay as John Sterling&#x27;s play-by-play partner. Steiner was at the microphone when Yankees third baseman Aaron Boone won Game 7 of the 2003 American League Championship Series with a home run in the eleventh inning to defeat the Boston Red Sox.

After Steiner completed his call, he joined Sterling in his famous &quot;Yankees win! Theeeeeeeeeeee Yankees win!&quot; call, saying he &quot;had always wanted to do that&quot;.

Steiner and Sterling reportedly had a contentious relationship during their three years together.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2005–2023, TBA)===
Steiner left the Yankees after the following season, his last game being the infamous Game 7 of the 2004 American League Championship Series in which the Red Sox completed its historic &quot;reverse sweep&quot; over its rivals after trailing 3 games to 0. He was originally slated to move to the YES Network as a studio host, but after Ross Porter, longtime radio voice of the Los Angeles Dodgers (Steiner&#x27;s favorite team growing up, with the team still based in Brooklyn) was let go by the team, Steiner was hired to take his place.

For four years covering the 2005 through 2008 seasons, the Dodgers&#x27; unique broadcasting arrangement had Steiner teamed with analyst Rick Monday and working play-by-play on radio during all home and intra-divisional road games. However, Steiner&#x27;s duties during these games would begin with the fourth inning and cover the remainder of the game, as the first three innings were a radio/television simulcast voiced by Vin Scully. Steiner handled television play-by-play on all other games (with analyst Steve Lyons), primarily road contests east of the Rocky Mountains. For the 2009 season, the Dodgers had Steiner and Monday as their radio team for all 162 games, though the Scully simulcast of the first three innings would remain. Starting in 2014, Steiner was paired with Orel Hershiser on the television broadcast for all games Scully did not call, and broadcast on the radio with Monday the other games.

Steiner also used to host &quot;Baseball Beat&quot; on XM Satellite Radio&#x27;s MLB Home Plate channel, where he talked exclusively to writers, authors, columnists, broadcasters, or celebrities on their thoughts and analysis of the current state of baseball. Steiner&#x27;s last episode of &quot;Baseball Beat&quot; aired on January 16, 2009.

Following Vin Scully&#x27;s retirement from the Dodgers after the 2016 season, the team split its radio-TV duties between Steiner and Joe Davis, with Steiner remaining on the radio side but switching to television on those occasions Davis has a Fox Sports assignment. Starting with the 2019 season he worked radio only with Tim Neverett and later Stephen Nelson replacing him as the alternate TV announcers.

Steiner was unable to work any games for the Dodgers during the 2024 season due to his battle with multiple myeloma blood cancer.

==Awards and accomplishments==
Steiner, an Emmy Award recipient, was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame on November 9, 2013, becoming the 17th sportscaster admitted into the Hall. In December 2010 he was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from his alma mater Bradley University, where he gave the commencement address. Steiner received the United Press International award for &quot;Best Sportscaster for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut&quot; in 1981, 1983, and 1985. His football play-by-play work earned him the New York State Broadcasters Association Award for &quot;Best Radio Play-by-Play&quot; in 1983, 1984, and 1987. During his fourteen years at ESPN, Steiner won a CableACE award for a documentary on Muhammad Ali and a Clarion award for his coverage of the Mike Tyson rape trial. Bradley named its school of sports communication for Steiner at a ceremony in March, 2015.

<doc id="418338" wikidata="Q927708" url="?curid=418338" title="Vietnamization">
<text>Vietnamization was a failed policy of the Richard Nixon administration to end U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War through a program to &quot;expand, equip, and train South Vietnamese forces and assign to them an ever-increasing combat role, at the same time steadily reducing the number of U.S. combat troops&quot;. Brought on by the communist North Vietnam&#x27;s Tet Offensive, the policy referred to U.S. combat troops specifically in the ground combat role, but did not reject combat by the U.S. Air Force, as well as the support to South Vietnam, consistent with the policies of U.S. foreign military assistance organizations. U.S. citizens&#x27; mistrust of their government that had begun after the offensive worsened with the release of news about U.S. soldiers massacring civilians at My Lai (1968), the invasion of Cambodia (1970), and the leaking of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; (1971).

At a January 28, 1969, meeting of the National Security Council, General Andrew Goodpaster, deputy to General Creighton Abrams and commander of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, stated that the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) had been steadily improving, and the point at which the war could be &quot;de-Americanized&quot; was close. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird agreed with the point, but not with the language: &quot;What we need is a term like &#x27;Vietnamizing&#x27; to put the emphasis on the right issues.&quot; Nixon immediately liked Laird&#x27;s word.

Vietnamization fit into the broader détente policy of the Nixon administration, in which the United States no longer regarded its fundamental strategy as the containment of communism but as a cooperative world order, in which Nixon and his chief adviser Henry Kissinger were focused on the broader constellation of forces and the bigger world powers. Nixon had ordered Kissinger to negotiate diplomatic policies with Soviet statesman Anatoly Dobrynin. Nixon also opened high-level contact with China. U.S. relations with the Soviet Union and China were of higher priority than South Vietnam.

Nixon said Vietnamization had two components. The first was &quot;strengthening the armed force of the South Vietnamese in numbers, equipment, leadership and combat skills&quot;, while the second was &quot;the extension of the pacification program [i.e. military aid to civilians] in South Vietnam&quot;. To achieve the first goal, U.S. helicopters would fly in support; however, helicopter operations were too much part of ground operations to involve U.S. personnel. Thus, ARVN candidates were enrolled in U.S. helicopter schools to take over the operations. As observed by Lieutenant General Dave Palmer, to qualify an ARVN candidate for U.S. helicopter school, he first needed to learn English; this, in addition to the months-long training and practice in the field, made adding new capabilities to the ARVN take at least two years. Palmer did not disagree that the first component, given time and resources, was achievable. However: &quot;Pacification, the second component, presented the real challenge ... it was benevolent government action in areas where the government should always have been benevolently active ... doing both was necessary if Vietnamization were to work.&quot;

The policy of Vietnamization, despite its successful execution, was ultimately a failure as the improved ARVN forces and the reduced American and allied component were unable to prevent the fall of Saigon and the subsequent merger of the north and south under communism, to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

==Precedent: French &quot;jaunissement&quot; in Indochina War==
From 1950, after several years of the First Indochina War, French commanders adopted a policy they called &quot;yellowing&quot; (), expressly to minimize white casualties. This change, at the time, was mostly due to a deficit of troops in the FTEO, the Far-East segment of the French army. Vietnamese soldiers were progressively integrated in battalions. After recognizing Vietnamese independence within the French Union on 8 March 1949, France allowed Vietnam to establish its own army (Vietnamese National Army) on 8 December 1950, this army then worked side by side with the French army (French Union army) to fight against the communist Viet Minh rebels. U.S. critics of the war compared Vietnamization to &quot;jaunissement&quot;.

==Preparation under Johnson==


Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s major political interests were domestic; the war interfered with his domestic focus, and he was eager to end the war in a way that he considered politically acceptable. In 1967, Kissinger attended a Pugwash Conference of scientists interested in nuclear disarmament. This was the first contact between Ho Chi Minh and Kissinger, who was then an adviser to Nelson Rockefeller, the governor of New York and a presidential candidate. Two participants approached Kissinger and offered a means of communication between the U.S. and the communist leadership. In particular, Raymond Aubrac, an official of the World Health Organization, knew Ho Chi Minh and agreed to carry a message.

After discussing the matter with Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, a message was sent. Ho said he would be willing to negotiate if the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam under Operation Rolling Thunder ceased. Mai Van Bo, Hanoi&#x27;s diplomatic representative in Paris, was named a point of contact. Since Hanoi would not communicate with an American official without a bombing halt, Kissinger served as an intermediary. Johnson made a speech in San Antonio on September 29, offering the possibility of talks. They were rejected, although brought up again in 1967.

===End of Americanization===
The departure of Lyndon B. Johnson did not end the war; rather, it spread throughout Southeast Asia. The Tet Offensive (1968) was a political and media disaster. Newsman Walter Cronkite announced that he saw a stalemate as the best case scenario for the Tet Offensive. Other members of the press added to the call to (reduce costs and spending). President Johnson&#x27;s popularity plummeted and he announced a bombing halt on March 31, simultaneously announcing he would not run for re-election. Though he had low expectations, on May 10, 1968, Johnson began peace talks between U.S. and North Vietnamese in Paris. The war, however, continued.

==Nixon Administration analysis of options==
Under the Nixon administration, Henry Kissinger, Nixon&#x27;s chief adviser, asked the Rand Corporation to provide a list of policy options, prepared by Daniel Ellsberg. On receiving the report, Kissinger and Schelling asked Ellsberg about the apparent absence of a victory option; Ellsberg said &quot;I don&#x27;t believe there is a win option in Vietnam.&quot; While Ellsberg eventually did send a withdrawal option, Kissinger would not circulate something that could be perceived as defeat, though privately, he realized the United States was in a difficult position and priorities needed to be set.

According to a record, prepared by Soviet Ambassador to the United States Anatoliy Dobrynin, of discussions between Dobrynin and Kissinger, the crux of the U.S. position, was progress still must be made at the Paris talks and, for domestic political reasons, Nixon &quot;simply cannot wait a year for Hanoi to decide to take some new step and take a more flexible position&quot;. Dobrynin expressed the Soviet position that the U.S. needed to stop trying to divide the Paris Peace Talks into two parts:
*discussion of military issues between the U.S. and the DRV
*resolution of political issues by placing them, &quot;for all practical purposes, entirely in the hands of Saigon, which does not want to resolve them and is unable to do so, since it is unable to soberly assess the situation and the alignment of forces in South Vietnam&quot;.
Dobrynin, however, misunderstood the extent to which the U.S. was willing to apply military force not involving ground troops, culminating in Operation Linebacker II.

=== The domestic aspect ===
The process of Vietnamization was partly influenced by Nixon’s delicate political position on a domestic level. He had been elected with 43.4% of the votes, and Laird was concerned with his support at home. Indeed, he could sense the impatience of the American public regarding the war. Nixon himself believed American casualties reduced the support for the war. For members of his administration, a campaign of attrition was useless against an Asian power, because they were able to tolerate a greater number of casualties compared to a Western power. 

On the left, Senator Fulbright, chairman of the Foreign Relations committee, feared Vietnamization would not be enough to reduce the numbers of casualties:My fear is that the current policy will keep the US bogged down in Vietnam – with the killing and cost continuing indefinitely.

==Nixon policy direction==
Nixon directed the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prepare a six-step withdrawal plan. The Commandant of the Marine Corps General Leonard F. Chapman Jr. remembered, &quot;I felt, and I think that most Marines felt, that the time had come to get out of Vietnam.&quot; Leading the ground force withdrawals, Marine redeployments started in mid-1969, and by the end of the year the entire 3rd Marine Division had departed.

In the aftermath of the Tet Offensive, units were able to take control of areas held by the Viet Cong. General Tran Van Tra of the Viet Cong forces in the South stated:

Some ARVN units, especially that had been operating closely with U.S. troops or using facilities, could quickly move into a dominant role in their areas.

Other ARVN units faced more of a challenge. For example, the ARVN 5th Division was directed to move from its existing base camp, Phu Cuong, to that of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division in Lai Khê, while the U.S. division moved southeast to Dĩ An. The ARVN unit had to retain its previous operational responsibility, while replacing a division that was far better equipped with helicopters than a standard U.S. division. At Phu Cong, Major General Nguyen Van Hieu, the 5th Division commander, was able to use a local Popular Force battalion for base security. The Popular Force battalions, however, did not move away from the area in which they were formed.

==Joint operations against Cambodia==

In 1969, Nixon ordered B-52 strikes against the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) bases and supply routes in Cambodia, which had been used as a sanctuary by North Vietnam forces. The orders for U.S. bombing of Cambodia were classified, and thus kept from the U.S. media and Congress. In a given strike, each B-52 normally dropped of bombs, and each strike consisted of three or six bombers.

===Cambodian change of government===
Much of North Vietnamese infiltration went through Cambodia. Nixon authorized unacknowledged bombing in Cambodia while U.S. ground troops were in South Vietnam. General Lon Nol had overthrown Prince Norodom Sihanouk in March 1970, who had presented himself as a neutralist while aware of the PAVN use of his country.

In June 1969, the Viet Cong and its allied organizations formed the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRG), recognized by Hanoi as the legal government of South Vietnam. At that time, communist losses dating from the Tet Offensive numbered 75,000, and morale was faltering, even among the party leadership.

===Joint ground operations===
On April 30, 1970, responding to a Communist attempt to take Cambodia, Nixon announced a large scale U.S.–ARVN incursion into Cambodia to directly hit the PAVN headquarters and supply dumps; the area bordered ARVN III Corps tactical zone.

The campaign began on May 1. The U.S. Task Force Shoemaker, of the 1st Cavalry Divisions, carried out B-52 strikes in the Fishhook area of Cambodia. T.F. Shoemaker operated with the ARVN Airborne Brigade. Separate ARVN operations took place in the Parrot&#x27;s Beak area. III Corps tactical zone commander Do Cao Tri, the most visible ARVN leader, encouraged the deepest ARVN penetrations.

The incursion prevented the immediate takeover of Cambodia by Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge, and cost the PAVN the supply line from the port of Sihanoukville. The Khmer Rouge broke with its North Vietnamese sponsors, and aligned with China. This made American involvement visible to the U.S. population, and there were intense protests, including deaths in a confrontation between rock-throwing protesters and National Guardsmen at Kent State University.

==Intelligence and security==
The U.S. intelligence collection systems, a significant amount of which (especially the techniques) were not shared with the ARVN, and, while not fully declassified, examples have been mentioned earlier in this article. The Communist side&#x27;s intelligence operations, beyond the spies that were discovered, are much less known.

While there had been many assumptions that the South Vietnamese government was penetrated by many spies, and there indeed were many, a December 1969 capture of a Viet Cong communications intelligence center and documents revealed that they had been getting a huge amount of information using simple technology and smart people, as well as sloppy U.S. communications security. This specific discovery was made by U.S. Army infantry, with interpretation by regular communications officers; the matter infuriated General Abrams in regards to the communications specialists. Before and after, there had been a much more highly classified, and only now available in heavily censored form, National Security Agency analysis of how the Communists were getting their information, which has led to a good deal of modern counterintelligence and operations security.

Some of the material from Touchdown also gave insight into the North Vietnamese intelligence system. For example, the NVA equivalent of the Defense Intelligence Agency was the Central Research Directorate (CRD) in Hanoi. COSVN intelligence staff, however, disseminated the tactically useful material. Their espionage was under the control of the Military Intelligence Sections (MIS), which were directed by the Strategic Intelligence Section (SIS) of CRD.

==U.S. direct discussions with North Vietnam==
Henry Kissinger began secret talks with the North Vietnamese official, Lê Đức Thọ, in February 1970. However, this is credible.

==1971==
Subsequent congressional action banned further U.S. ground intervention outside the boundaries of South Vietnam, so the next major drive, Operation Lam Son 719, would have to be based on ARVN ground forces, U.S. air and artillery support, and U.S. advisory and logistical assistance.

The Vietnamization policy achieved limited rollback of Communist gains inside South Vietnam only, and was primarily aimed at providing the arms, training and funding for the South to fight and win its own war, if it had the courage and commitment to do so. By 1971, the Communists lost control of most, but not all, of the areas they had controlled in the South in 1967. The Communists still controlled many remote jungle and mountain districts, especially areas that protected the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

Commanded by Hoang Xuan Lam, known more for loyalty to Nguyen Van Thieu than for military talent, Saigon&#x27;s effort to strike against one of these strongholds, Operation Lam Son 719, failed in 1971. The SVN forces, with some U.S. air support, were unable to defeat PAVN regulars. While the operation is detailed in a separate sub-article, the key issues were that the ARVN were inexperienced in executing large operations. They underestimated the needed forces, and the senior officers had developed in a context that rewarded loyalty rather than competence. Let there be no doubt that there were individual ARVN commanders who would be credit to any military, but, Thieu, like those RVN leaders before him, was constantly concerned at preventing a military coup. &quot;Promotions were won in Saigon, not in battle. And vital to advancement was the avoidance of risk, even at the price of defeat.&quot;

Thieu relieved the operational commander, head of I Corps tactical zone commander Hoang Xuan Lam with the most respected combat commander in the ARVN, Do Cao Tri. Tri died 2.5 hours later in his first helicopter crash of inspection. It is known the crash was at low altitude; it has been argued it had crashed due to mechanical failure or enemy fire. Certainly, mechanical failure was less demoralizing.

The 25,000-man ARVN force, which U.S. planners had considered half the necessary size, took admitted 25% casualties, which some estimates put as high as 50%.

==1972==
By the beginning of 1972, over 400,000 U.S. personnel had been withdrawn, most of whom were combat troops. Politically, this allowed Nixon to negotiate with China and the Soviet Union without suggesting that he was compromising U.S. soldiers in the field.

North Vietnam made a major conventional attack on the South, for which the U.S. provided major air support under Operation Linebacker I, which enabled the ARVN to regain substantial control. In An Lộc, South Vietnamese forces halted the North Vietnamese advance towards Saigon capital. When North Vietnam, late in the year, left the negotiating table, Nixon authorized the destructive Operation Linebacker II campaign, which forced the North Vietnamese to negotiate; a peace treaty was signed and all U.S. combat forces were withdrawn.

==1973 and ceasefire==
The Armed Forces of the Republic of Vietnam had some excellent ground combat units, but still had very serious problems of command, control, and communications at division level and above.

Many units had become overdependent on American air support, and, while the RVN Air Force had not developed large-scale interdiction capability, they were also of varied quality for close air support. Beyond the issue that the Air Force was always fragmented to the corps commanders, they also did not receive various expected equipment upgrades. Photoreconnaissance was extremely limited.

Armored units had developed the greatest confidence in their ability to fight without U.S. air support. Ground commanders also learned that armored units were not for infantry support and static defenses, but needed to be used as mobile reserves. Neither North nor South Vietnam, however, had really mastered large-scale combined arms methods, compared to a NATO or Warsaw Pact level of proficiency.

In a postwar interview with the RAND Corporation, Nguyễn Bá Cẩn said: &quot;Vietnamese officials called Vietnamization the U.S. Dollar and Vietnam Blood Sharing Plan.&quot;

<doc id="418346" wikidata="Q1173093" url="?curid=418346" title="Dave Andreychuk">
<text>David John Andreychuk (born September 29, 1963) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger who played in the NHL with the Buffalo Sabres, Toronto Maple Leafs, New Jersey Devils, Boston Bruins, Colorado Avalanche, and Tampa Bay Lightning. He is one of the highest scoring left wingers in NHL history, and is in second place in career power-play goals (274) behind Alexander Ovechkin. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2017.

==Playing career==
Dave Andreychuk was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres from the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s Oshawa Generals in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft and played his first NHL season in 1982–83. He went on to play 11 seasons in Buffalo before being traded on February 2, 1993, with Daren Puppa, and a 1993 first-round pick (Kenny Jönsson) to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Grant Fuhr and a conditional 1995 fifth-round draft pick. He played for the Leafs until 1995–96 when he was traded to the New Jersey Devils, where he stayed until 1999. After New Jersey, he had short stints with the Boston Bruins (1999–2000), Colorado Avalanche (2000), and Buffalo Sabres (2000–01), before settling with the Tampa Bay Lightning (2001–02 to 2005–06).

His best season offensively was in 1993–94 when, with Toronto, he posted 53 goals and 99 points. The 1993 and 1994 playoffs also saw Andreychuk and the Maple Leafs advance to the Conference Finals, where they lost to the Los Angeles Kings and the Vancouver Canucks, respectively. As a result of his successful stint with the team, many Maple Leafs&#x27; fans still affectionately refer to him simply as &quot;Uncle Dave&quot;. Andreychuk referred to the famed 1993 run in particular as particularly heartbreaking, as Toronto was eliminated in game seven negating the chance of a Toronto–Montreal Stanley Cup Finals in the league&#x27;s 75th anniversary season.

As a member of the Boston Bruins on October 28, 1999, Andreychuk had a four-goal game versus Tampa Bay.

In the 2001–02 NHL season, Andreychuk made a shocking move which would pay dividends in the long run. Rather than sign with a Stanley Cup contender, he signed with the lowly Tampa Bay Lightning, to which he was able to bring some much-needed veteran leadership. The Lightning again missed the playoffs that season, and Andreychuk refused trades to contenders, stating his work with the team was not finished. In 2002–03, Lightning head coach John Tortorella appointed Andreychuk the captain, (succeeding Vincent Lecavalier, who was stripped of the captaincy after the 2000–01 season) and Andreychuk promptly led the Lightning to the playoffs for the first time in seven seasons.

In the 2003–04 NHL season, Andreychuk continued as a key contributor for the Lightning offence, reaching 20 goals for the third consecutive year with the team. Qualifying for the playoffs for a second consecutive year, Andreychuk helped the Lightning defeat the Calgary Flames in seven games to win the Stanley Cup for the first time in franchise history. Andreychuk went 22 years without being on a Stanley Cup championship team, tying the NHL record with Ray Bourque for the longest career before doing so (Andreychuk had played 1597 regular-season games to that point, and only Bourque had played more career games before being on his first Stanley Cup-winning team).

Following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Andreychuk returned to the Lightning for the 2005–06 season. After the year off, Andreychuk&#x27;s contributions decreased and on January 10, 2006, he was waived by the Lightning, bringing an end to his career.

==Post-retirement==

On October 1, 2006, Andreychuk rejoined the Lightning as a Community Representative.

In 2005, the city of Hamilton renamed the Mountain Arena, following renovations, the Dave Andreychuk Mountain Arena &amp; Skating Centre in his honour. On November 28, 2008, he was inducted into the Buffalo Sabres Hall of Fame.

On February 4, 2011, the Tampa Bay Lightning named Andreychuk as their Vice President in charge of fans. He currently serves as the Lightning&#x27;s Vice President of Corporate &amp; Community Affairs.

== Personal life ==
Andreychuk married his wife Sue in 1991 and together they have three daughters. Andeychuk filed for divorce in 2019. Both he and Sue still reside in Tampa, Florida. Prior to his appointment in the Lightning&#x27;s front office, Andreychuk and his family resided in East Amherst, New York.

Following his retirement from professional sport, Andreychuk also founded the Dave Andreychuk Foundation as a way of giving back to the community. The foundation has two branches, a Canadian one in Andreychuk&#x27;s home town of Hamilton, Ontario, and a U.S. one in Tampa, Florida where he currently lives. The goals of the foundation are three-fold: 1. Assist children in need, 2. Support causes for children and families enduring chronic and/or life-threatening illness, and 3. Encourage the investment of youth and amateur sports.

<text>Nikolai Alexandrovich Antropov (; born February 18, 1980) is a Kazakhstani-Canadian former professional ice hockey centre who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Rangers, Atlanta Thrashers and Winnipeg Jets. He received Canadian citizenship in May 2007. Internationally Antropov played for Kazakhstan at several junior and senior tournaments, including the 2006 Winter Olympics.

==Playing career==
Antropov was expected to be drafted early in the second round, but following a dominant season with Torpedo Ust-Kamenogorsk in the second-tier of the Russian Superleague (RSL), including an international match against Iceland, in which he scored 11 goals and 26 points, he was drafted tenth overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. Before going overseas to play hockey in North America, Antropov also played in the RSL with Dynamo Moscow.

When Owen Nolan joined the Maple Leafs in March 2003, Antropov changed his number from #11 (Nolan&#x27;s number for the San Jose Sharks) to #80, the year of his birth. In 2003–04, Maple Leafs head coach Pat Quinn placed Antropov alongside Joe Nieuwendyk and Alexei Ponikarovsky dubbed the &quot;Skyline&quot; due to the players&#x27; height. 
During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Antropov returned to the RSL and played 36 games split between Ak Bars Kazan and Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. However, injuries felled the power forward, and he missed significant time during the 2005–06 season. Antropov managed to produce 12 goals and 19 assists for 31 points in 57 games.

Upon Antropov&#x27;s return from injury, he added 15 points in the final 10 regular season games of the 2005–06 season. He finished third on the team in even strength scoring and also led the Leafs in plus-minus with a +13 rating. In 2006–07, Antropov typically played alongside team captain Mats Sundin and Ponikarovsky on Toronto&#x27;s top line. On June 6, 2007, the Maple Leafs announced they had signed Antropov to a two-year contract extension. During a game against the New York Rangers on December 6, 2007, Antropov scored his second career hat-trick and was named the game&#x27;s first star. In December 2007, a campaign was launched to encourage fans to vote Antropov as a write-in candidate for the 2007 NHL All-Star Game held in Atlanta.
On February 9, 2008, Antropov set a new career-high in goals with 19 when he scored in overtime to give the Maple Leafs a 3–2 win, tipping in an Anton Strålman slapshot; he finished the season with 26 goals. On March 4, 2009, Antropov was traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for a second-round draft pick and conditional draft pick.

On July 2, 2009, Antropov signed a four-year, $16.25 million deal with the Atlanta Thrashers as a free agent. He was expected to make $3.5 million the first year, $3.75 million the second, $4.25 million the third and $4.75 million for the final year of the deal for an average cap hit of $4.0625 million per year. Antropov&#x27;s first year with the Thrashers was his most successful, scoring 24 goals and 43 assists. Following the team&#x27;s relocation to Winnipeg in the summer of 2011, Antropov had scored the first goal of the new Winnipeg Jets on October 9, 2011, against the Montreal Canadiens.

On August 8, 2013, Antropov signed a two-year contract with Barys Astana of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), where he played during 2012–13 NHL lockout. At the conclusion of his two-year tenure with Barys, Antropov retired from professional hockey and returned to Canada.

==International play==


Internationally, Antropov represented Kazakhstan in the 1998 IIHF World Championship, the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships (scoring eight points in six games) and in the 2006 Winter Olympics, where he scored one goal. Antropov captained the Kazakhstani squad on both occasions. He and Colorado Avalanche goaltender Vitali Kolesnik were the lone NHL players on the team.

==Personal life==
During his tenure with the Leafs, Antropov became a Canadian citizen. He received Canadian citizenship in May 2007.

Antropov and his wife have three children. Antropov&#x27;s oldest son, Danil was a forward for the Saginaw Spirit of the Ontario Hockey League during the 2019-20 season.

<text>Denis Mikhailovich Arkhipov (; born May 19, 1979) is a Russian former professional ice hockey player. He played in the National Hockey League with the Nashville Predators and Chicago Blackhawks between 2000 and 2007, and then in the Kontinental Hockey League between 2008 and 2013. Internationally Arkhipov played for the Russian national team at the junior and senior level, including the 2003 and 2006 World Championships.

==Playing career==
Arkhipov was selected 60th overall in the third round of the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, the second choice of the Nashville Predators.

He made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut on January 8, 2001 in a 2–1 loss against the Vancouver Canucks in Vancouver. During this game he notched his first NHL point when he got an assist on a Richard Lintner goal against Bob Essensa. Two days later he scored his first NHL goal in a 5–2 win at the Edmonton Oilers. He scored when he took a Scott Hartnell pass and got it past Tommy Salo. He also got an assist on a Marián Cisár goal to make this his first ever NHL multi-point game.

In the 2001–02 NHL season he played in all 82 games with a career high 42 points. He led the Predators in goals, game-winning goals (6) and shooting percentage (16.9%). That year he centered the &quot;Vowel Line&quot; which also included, Vladimír Országh on right wing, and Martin Erat at left wing. They were called the &quot;Vowel Line&quot; because their last names all start with vowels.

Arkhipov played the 2004–05 NHL lockout season in the Russian Super League, and remained there for the 2005–06 season before signing as a free agent with the Chicago Blackhawks on July 6, 2006.

==Records==

<doc id="418349" wikidata="Q2723413" url="?curid=418349" title="Lancelot du Lac (film)">
<text>Lancelot du Lac is a 1974 French fantasy drama film written and directed by Robert Bresson. It retells the story of Lancelot and Guinevere&#x27;s love as Camelot and the Round Table fall apart. It is based on Arthurian legend and medieval romances, especially the Lancelot-Grail cycle, and the works of Chrétien de Troyes.

In common with Bresson&#x27;s later films, the cast was composed of amateur actors, several of whom did not appear in any other film. Bresson&#x27;s direction demanded a purposeful lack of emotion in the acting style, and reduced or eliminated the fantastical elements of the Grail legend. While much of the production is intentionally stylised as Medieval &quot;Romance&quot;, the film is punctuated with moments of graphic violence.

==Plot==
After many bloody adventures, King Arthur sends his knights, who have been pledged by the late magician Merlin, to retrieve the Holy Grail, which is believed to be hidden somewhere in Brittany. The mission proves futile and the knights are decimated. Among those who return two years later is Lancelot, the lover of Queen Guinevere. He is haunted by the death of his comrades and torn between his duty and his love for Guinevere. He wishes to end their affair, but Guinevere refuses. She implies that instead of being slain by enemies, the knights sent for the Grail had turned on one another, Lancelot chief among them. To make matters worse, many knights of Camelot are wary of or despise Lancelot, who is seen as a favourite, even by members of the Round Table, save for a few, among them Gawain and Lionel, who are his greatest friends among the knights&#x27; ranks. Mordred comes upon Lancelot and Guinevere&#x27;s secret meeting spot and discovers her scarf there.

Lancelot, obeying once more his love for Guinevere, wishes to forgo an upcoming tournament and have a tryst with Guinevere. Gawain tries to convince him to compete, but fails. Mordred suspects Lancelot is missing the tourney to be able to meet with Guinevere. En route to the tournament, Mordred tries and fails to convince Arthur of the affair. Later on, during the tourney, a strange knight bearing a white shield appears and defeats one knight after another. Gawain and Arthur recognise the knight as Lancelot by his horse and the way he rides. Lancelot triumphs over the remaining knights, Mordred among them, before making his leave. After his departure, he staggers and falls in the forest, bleeding heavily.

Gawain is informed by the jilted Guinevere that Lancelot has &quot;disappeared&quot; and the knight with the white shield could not be him. Lionel, who had wounded the knight of the white shield earlier, wishes to defend Lancelot&#x27;s honour, but is stopped by Gawain, who sends riders in search for Lancelot, to no avail. It is then believed that Lancelot is dead. Gawain seeks out Guinevere at her secret meeting place, but Guinevere is resigned to her love with Lancelot and refuses to leave.

Gawain departs, only to be met by Arthur accompanied by knights, including Mordred, who has informed Arthur of the affair. Arthur imprisons Guinevere in the same tower where she and Lancelot once had their meetings. Lancelot is shown to be hiding and recovering in Escalot, cared for by an elderly woman. With the help of Lionel and knights loyal to Lancelot, he rescues Guinevere, killing two knights, one of them being Agravain, Gawain&#x27;s brother. Arthur starts a campaign against the castle where Lancelot and Guinevere are sheltering. The resulting battles result in many losses and casualties, among them Gawain. Despite his injuries and his brother&#x27;s death, he does not begrudge his once-friend Lancelot, and says that though he and Arthur tried to save Guinevere, only Lancelot had succeeded. He dies of his wounds.

Guinevere, guilt-ridden over the blood spilt for their love, tells Lancelot to return her to Arthur, and he complies. Lancelot learns that Mordred is leading an uprising against the king, and he chooses to ride against Mordred, on Arthur&#x27;s side. The resulting battle is a bloody conflict from which none survive, including Arthur and Mordred. Lancelot staggers across the battlefield and, whispering Guinevere&#x27;s name, he collapses to die. The last thing he sees is a carrion crow flying above the bloodbath.

==Production==
===Casting===
Bresson had been planning a film of the grail legend for a long period. His original choice to play Guinevere twenty years previously had been the artist Niki de Saint Phalle, the mother of Laura Duke Condominas, but the project had been delayed again and again. His final selection of Laura came about by chance when he came across a photograph of the daughter with no prior information about who she was or that she was in fact the direct descendant of his first choice.

The 1996 issue of &quot;Positif&quot; reports that in 1964 Bresson wrote to George Cukor, saying he would like to make the film in English, with Natalie Wood and Burt Lancaster.

===Filming===
The film was shot from the end of June 1973 to the start of September 1973 in Noirmoutier-en-l&#x27;Île in the Vendée.

==Release==
The film premiered at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival in May 1974, followed by its theatrical release in France on 26 September 1974. It had its world television premiere in West Germany on 4 May 1974.

==Reception==
The film was well-received among critics, currently holding a 95% &quot;fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews.

It was Michael Haneke&#x27;s second-place choice in the 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll of the greatest films ever made.

The film won the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. Bresson refused the award, saying (in the light of the continual funding difficulties throughout his film career), &quot;I don&#x27;t want prestige, I want money and only the Palme d&#x27;Or attracts money.&quot;

David Lowery cites this movie as one of the inspirations behind &quot;The Green Knight&quot;, the adaption of the Arthurian legend, &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;.

<doc id="418351" wikidata="Q329217" url="?curid=418351" title="Elhanan Tannenbaum">
<text>Elhanan Tannenbaum, (, 12 August 1946 – 7 October 2024) was an Israeli businessman and reserve officer in the IDF who was captured by Hezbollah. In 2000 he was lured to Dubai, offered a &quot;lucrative drug deal&quot;, captured by Hezbollah, and transferred to Lebanon.
He was released in a prisoner exchange, together with the bodies of several Israeli soldiers, for 435 Arab prisoners held by Israel. After his release from Hezbollah, Tannenbaum was not charged for any crime in Israel, after a plea bargain.

==Early life==
Elhanan Tannenbaum was born in Poland, the son of Holocaust survivors. Most of his relatives had been killed in the Holocaust. In 1949, Tannenbaum and his parents and sister immigrated to Israel and moved to Holon, where Tannenbaum grew up and attended high school. He was also active in the local scouts movement.

At the age of 18, Tannenbaum enrolled in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, studying economics and political science. He began his compulsory military service in the Israel Defense Forces during his academic studies, and served in the Artillery Corps between 1965 and 1968. After graduating, he completed his active military service as an officer. He then studied business administration at Tel Aviv University. After his discharge from active service, he served as a reservist officer in the IDF Artillery Corps. Tannenbaum saw action in the Six-Day War, the War of Attrition, and the Yom Kippur War. He eventually reached the rank of Colonel in the Artillery Corps reserves.

==Capture==
In 2000, Tannenbaum, who was in debt due to gambling and business failures, was approached by his childhood friend , an Israeli-Arab, who was working for Hezbollah, and who had previously been tried by an IDF military court in the Gaza Strip for a planned operation to abduct an Israeli in Gaza and taking him to Lebanon by boat. Obeid, along with Lebanese Hezbollah operative Kaid Biro, was planning to abduct Tannenbaum in Dubai and take him to Lebanon for Hezbollah to use as a bargaining chip. Obeid offered Tannenbaum a part in an alleged lucrative drug-dealing operation. Tannenbaum was told he would have to fly to Dubai, and his role would be to consult Obeid on how to smuggle drugs into Israel.

In December 2006, Tannenbaum admitted to having knowingly gone to Dubai in 2000 to complete a drug deal, and said that he had expected to make $200,000 (€152,000) on the deal.

On the night of 3 October 2000, Tannenbaum flew to Brussels, where he met Obeid and Biro, who gave him a forged Venezuelan passport. From there, he caught a flight to Frankfurt, and boarded a Gulf Air flight to Dubai. He was met there by a man holding a sign with his name, who took him to a limousine. Tannenbaum claimed that he was then driven to an affluent neighborhood in Dubai, where he was attacked by two or three individuals and blacked out after being beaten with a club. Tannenbaum was then flown to Lebanon on a private plane.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah declared on 16 October 2000 on al-Manar TV station: &quot;We have an Israeli colonel in our hands&quot;. Israel was initially unsure who that person might be, until Nasrallah confirmed it was Tannenbaum a few days later. According to Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman, Tannenbaum held an important position in the IDF Northern Command, doing 150 days of reserve duty a year, and was privy to many important military secrets. Bergman wrote that only five days before Tannenbaum&#x27;s abduction, he was on reserve duty at the Northern Command bunker in Safed overseeing a sensitive exercise: a simulation of a full-scale war with Hezbollah and Syria. Tannenbaum could have exposed the details of Israel&#x27;s war plans to Hezbollah.

Following the abduction operation, Obeid moved to Lebanon to avoid prosecution in Israel, and was considered a wanted fugitive by the Israeli government.

==Prisoner exchange==

Tannenbaum was released in January 2004 as part of a prisoner swap with Hezbollah. The swap, mediated by Germany, resulted in the exchange of 435 prisoners held by Israel in return for Tannenbaum&#x27;s release and the return of the bodies of three soldiers killed during an ambush along the Israeli-Lebanese border. Among the 435 people released were Mustafa Dirani and Abdel Karim Obeid. These two individuals were kidnapped, in 1994 and 1989 respectively, for use as bargaining chips in the effort to secure the release of the most famous of the Israeli MIAs, Ron Arad. Fearing the release of these men would end any hope of finding Arad, his family attempted to take legal action to prevent their release. Nothing came of this effort.

While campaigning against the proposed Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange Mossad Chief Meir Dagan in 2011 claimed that 231 Israelis were killed by terrorists freed in the Tannenbaum exchange deal.

==Later life==
Following his release and arrival in Israel, Tannenbaum was arrested for his illegal actions that led up to his capture. He agreed to a plea bargain and admitted to the reasons behind his travel to Dubai and described the details of his capture. In exchange, he was not charged with any crime and served no prison time.

Tannenbaum continued to be heavily in debt from his past dealings, owing payment to the National Insurance Institute, mortgage debts, compensation for bad checks, as well as other debts along with monthly alimony to his ex-wife. In 2005, he was arrested and detained for 10 days after failing to pay alimony. He told the court that at the time, he had no source of income and was living in his sister&#x27;s home. In October 2006, he began studying law, and in 2008 was working as a taxi driver. In 2010, he was arrested for failing to pay debts totaling some NIS 2 million ($550,000). While in court, he claimed that he had recently completed his law studies and was about to begin an internship.

==Personal life and death==
Tannenbaum married in 1971, and had a son, Ori, and a daughter, Keren. Tannenbaum later divorced his wife.

Tannenbaum died on 7 October 2024, at the age of 78.

<text>A vector operator is a differential operator used in vector calculus. Vector operators include:
* Gradient is a vector operator that operates on a scalar field, producing a vector field.
* Divergence is a vector operator that operates on a vector field, producing a scalar field.
* Curl is a vector operator that operates on a vector field, producing a vector field.

Defined in terms of del:

:formula_1

The Laplacian operates on a scalar field, producing a scalar field:

:formula_2

Vector operators must always come right before the scalar field or vector field on which they operate, in order to produce a result. E.g.
:formula_3
yields the gradient of &quot;f&quot;, but
:formula_4
is just another vector operator, which is not operating on anything.

A vector operator can operate on another vector operator, to produce a compound vector operator, as seen above in the case of the Laplacian.

<doc id="418355" wikidata="Q1723890" url="?curid=418355" title="Babbling">
<text>Babbling is a stage in child development and a state in language acquisition during which an infant appears to be experimenting with uttering articulate sounds, but does not yet produce any recognizable words. Babbling begins shortly after birth and progresses through several stages as the infant&#x27;s repertoire of sounds expands and vocalizations become more speech-like. Infants typically begin to produce recognizable words when they are around 12 months of age, though babbling may continue for some time afterward.

Babbling can be seen as a precursor to language development or simply as vocal experimentation. The physical structures involved in babbling are still being developed in the first year of a child&#x27;s life. This continued physical development is responsible for some of the changes in abilities and variations of sound babies can produce. Abnormal developments such as certain medical conditions, developmental delays, and hearing impairments may interfere with a child&#x27;s ability to babble normally. Though there is still disagreement about the uniqueness of language to humans, babbling is not unique to the human species.

== Typical development ==

Babbling is a stage in language acquisition. Babbles are separated from language because they do not convey meaning or refer to anything specific like words do. Human infants are not necessarily excited or upset when babbling; they may also babble spontaneously and incessantly when they are emotionally calm.

The sounds of babbling are produced before an infant begins to construct recognizable words. This can be partly attributed to the immaturity of the vocal tract and neuromusculature at this age in life. Infants first begin vocalizing by crying, followed by cooing and then vocal play. These first forms of sound production are the easiest for children to use because they contain natural, reflexive, mostly vowel sounds.

Babbling usually occurs in all children acquiring language. Particularly it has been studied in English, Italian, Korean, French, Spanish, Japanese and Swedish. Infants across the world follow general trends in babbling tendencies. Differences that do appear are the result of the infants&#x27; sensitivity to the characteristics of the language(s) they are exposed to. Infants mimic the prosody of the language(s) they are exposed to. They use intonation patterns and timing that matches the characteristics of their parent language. Infants also babble using the consonants and vowels that occur most frequently in their parent language. Most babbling consists of a small number of sounds, which suggests the child is preparing the basic sounds necessary to speak the language to which he is exposed.

The consonants that babbling infants produce tend to be any of the following: . The following consonants tend to be infrequently produced during phonological development: . The complexity of the sounds that infants produce makes them difficult to categorize, but the above rules tend to hold true regardless of the language to which children are exposed.

The sounds produced in babble have been categorised relative to their components. For instance, babble may be broken down into syllables that contain a consonant and a vowel (CV syllables) and syllables that contain only a vowel sound (non-CV syllables). These components have been studied in relation to speech development in Goo Goo Ga Ga, and have been found to relate to future speech outcomes.

If babbling occurs during the first year of life, it can typically be concluded that the child is developing speech normally. As babies grow and change, their vocalizations will change as well.

=== Timeline of typical vocal development ===

Infants follow a general timeline of vocal developments in childhood. This timeline provides a general outline of expected developments from birth to age one. Babbling usually lasts 6–9 months in total. The babbling period ends at around 12 months because it is the age when first words usually occur. However, individual children can show large variability, and this timeline is only a guideline.

From birth to 1 month, babies produce mainly pleasure sounds, cries for assistance, and responses to the human voice.

Around 2 months, babies can distinguish between different speech sounds, and can make &quot;goo&quot;ing sounds.

Around 3 months, babies begin making elongated vowel sounds &quot;oooo&quot; &quot;aaaa&quot;, and will respond vocally to speech of others. They continue to make predominantly vowel sounds.

Around 4 months, babies may vary their pitch, and imitate tones in adult speech.

Around 5 months, babies continue to experiment with sound, imitating some sounds made by adults.

Around 6 months, babies vary volume, pitch and rate. When infants are 6 months old they are finally able to control the opening and closing of the vocal tract, and upon obtaining this ability, infants begin to distinguish between the different sounds of vowels and consonants. This age is often distinguished as the beginning of the &quot;canonical stage&quot;. During the canonical stage, the babbling involves reduplicated sounds containing alternations of vowels and consonants, for example, &quot;baba&quot; or &quot;bobo&quot;. Reduplicated babbling (also known as canonical babbling) consists of repeated syllables consisting of consonant and a vowel such as &quot;da da da da&quot; or &quot;ma ma ma ma&quot;.

Around 7 months, babies can produce several sounds in one breath, and they also recognize different tones and inflections in other speakers.

Around 8 months, babies can repeat emphasized syllables. They imitate gestures and tonal quality of adult speech. They also produce variegated babbling. Variegated babbles contain mixes of consonant vowel combinations such as &quot;ka da by ba mi doy doy&quot;. Variegated babbling differs from reduplicated babbling in terms of the variation and complexity of syllables that are produced.

Around 9–10 months, babies can imitate non speech sounds, and speech-like sounds if they are in the child&#x27;s repertoire of sounds. Infant babbling begins to resemble the native language of a child. The final stage is known as conversational babbling, or the &quot;jargon stage&quot;. Usually occurring by about ten months of age, the jargon stage is defined as &quot;pre-linguistic vocalizations in which infants use adult-like stress and intonation&quot;. The general structure of the syllables that they are producing is very closely related to the sounds of their native language and this form of babbling significantly predicts the form of early words.

Around 11 months, babies imitate inflections, rhythms, and expressions of speakers.

By 12 months, babies typically can speak one or more words. These words now refer to the entity which they name; they are used to gain attention or for a specific purpose. Children continue to produce jargon babbles beyond their first words.

=== Manual babbling ===

Manual babbling is structurally identical to vocal babbling in its development. Just as hearing and/or speaking infants babble with their mouths, infants who grow up with a sign language babble with their hands. If a hearing infant has deaf and/or mute parents or parents who otherwise use a sign language, they will still imitate the signs that they see their parents displaying. This is evidence that manual babbling is possible in both hearing and deaf infants, and in both speaking and mute infants.

All babies imitate with their hands the movements that they see. Typical gestures for example are raising arms to be lifted up, or grabbing/reaching to indicate wanting a bottle; these are used referentially. In addition, infants who grow up with a sign language begin to make gestures that are distinct from all other hand movements and gestures.

After it was established that infants could babble with their hands and their mouths, the patterns in which productions occurred were studied. Speaking and signing infants follow very similar maturational paths in language acquisition. Both go through a number of stages, and exhibit similar complexity in their babbling sequences. In studies where deaf and hearing children were compared, children learning sign language produced more multi-movement manual babbling than children who were not learning a sign language. There are three main components of manual babbling. The hand gestures contain a restricted set of phonetic units, show a syllabic organization, and are used without reference or meaning. This is comparable to aspects of vocal babbling as mentioned above. It is difficult to study manual babbling as often the manual activity can be mistaken as gestures rather than signs. When signing children are in fact babbling it will most often take place in front of their torso in a designated area that is called the phonetic space. One of the most common forms of manual babbling is the extension and spreading of all fingers. This babble is also one of the first indicators that an infant will begin to make in manual communication.

Children are able to produce signs correctly, which is important since many articulation tendencies of manual babbling transfer to the children’s early sign production. Children acquire signs for the same concepts as speaking children&#x27;s words, and in the same stage of development.

== Transition from babbling to language ==

Two hypotheses have been devised in order to explain how babbling is related to language development.

* Discontinuity hypothesis – This early hypothesis suggests that babbling has absolutely no relationship to language development. If true, infants would produce a full range of random sounds in no particular order during the babbling stage. However, it has been demonstrated that early babbling is quite limited. Supporters of this hypothesis also thought that children might drop certain sounds only to pick them up again in later months. Supporters proposed it would be possible for babies to incorrectly and inconsistently use sounds that they had already mastered in the early babbling stages later in life or even lose sounds altogether before learning how to speak. The hypothesis also implies that when children finally reach the age where they are able to learn their native language, they develop phonological sounds in an orderly manner. Over time, infants will relearn sounds and develop words in a specific language. Current evidence does not support these claims. 
Contemporary research supports the notion that babbling is directly related to the development of language as discussed in The Continuity Hypothesis. 
*Continuity hypothesis – According to this hypothesis, babbling is a direct forerunner to language. At first, infants produce universal sounds that exist in all areas of the world and in all languages. Reduplicated canonical babbling produces a number of sounds but only some of them (&quot;ma ma&quot; and &quot;da da&quot;, turning into &quot;mommy&quot; and &quot;daddy&quot;, respectively) are recognized as meaningful and thus reinforced by caregivers and parents, while the others are abandoned as meaningless (this is the argument in, for instance, Susanne Langer&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy in a New Key&quot;). This hypothesis agrees with the claim that the anatomical changes of the vocal tract are very important, but suggests that the social environment in which an infant is raised has a greater influence on the development of language. Infants pay close attention to their caregivers&#x27; reactions and use their feedback as approval for the sounds that they are making. This reinforcement through feedback helps infants to focus their attention on specific features of sound. Social feedback facilitates faster learning and earlier production of a variety of advanced words. There is evidence that babbling varies depending on the linguistic environment in which a baby is raised. Current babbling research supports The Continuity Hypothesis. For example, it has been noted that infants raised in French speaking environments display greater amounts of rising intonation in comparison to infants raised in English speaking environments. This is likely due to the differences between French and English intonations while speaking. The ordering of consonants and vowels in the babbling of English, French, Swedish and Japanese infants also appears to resemble that of their native language. These findings support another hypothesis, the &quot;babbling drift hypothesis&quot; in which infant babbling resembles the phonetic characteristics of a child&#x27;s native language through exposure to speech. When babies are exposed to two languages, their babbles resemble the language that they are most exposed to. The dominant language is considered to be the one that children have the most exposure to. Most often infants do not produce a blend of language styles while babbling however, may switch between languages. Sometimes infants may choose which language style they prefer to babble in based upon particular features. The babbling drift hypothesis provides further support for The Continuity Hypothesis.

== Physiology of babbling ==

The human mouth moves in distinct ways during speech production. When producing each individual sound out loud, humans use different parts of their mouths, as well as different methods to produce particular sounds. During the beginnings of babbling, infants tend to have greater mouth openings on the right side. This finding suggests that babbling is controlled by the left hemisphere of the brain. The larynx, or voicebox, is originally high in the throat which allows the baby to continue to breathe while swallowing. It descends during the first year of life, allowing the pharynx to develop and facilitates the production of adult-like speech sounds.

Reduplicated babbling (such as &#x27;bababa&#x27;) involves a rhythmic opening and closing of the jaw. According to the frame dominance theory, when the mandible (jaw) is elevated, a consonant sound will be produced. When the mandible is lowered, a vowel-like sound is produced. Therefore, during a reduplicated sequence of sounds, the consonant and vowels are alternated as the mandible elevates and depresses. The opening and closing of the mouth alone will not produce babbling, and phonation (or voicing) is necessary during the movement in order to create a meaningful sound. Other important oral structures involved in articulation, such as the tongue, lips and teeth remain in a stable resting position during babbling. Sometimes during the babbling period, the motions can be made without any vocalization at all. Signing infants produce manual babbling through similar rhythmic alternations, but they perform with their hands instead of their mouths. As a baby goes beyond the reduplicated sequences of babbling, they exhibit equal sized mouth or hand openings on the right and left sides.

== Abnormal development ==

Typically by 6 months of age, all normally developing children will babble. However, infants with certain medical conditions or developmental delays may exhibit a delay or an absence of babbling. For example, infants who have had a tracheotomy typically do not babble because they are unable to phonate. Following decannulation, it has been found that these infants do produce more vocalizations, but the sounds or syllables are not as diverse as those found in typically developing infant&#x27;s canonical babbling behaviour. Infants with severe apraxia may not babble, and may fail to produce first words. Communication by infants with apraxia may instead be in the form of grunting and pointing. Infants with autism may show a delay in babbling, and in some cases it may be completely absent. Babbling in children with autism tends to occur less frequently than in typically developing children, and with a smaller range of syllables produced during the canonical babbling stage. Babbling may also be delayed in individuals who are born with Down syndrome. The canonical stage may emerge two months later for individuals with Down syndrome compared to other infants, although, when produced, it is similar to babbling in typically developing infants.

=== Vocal babbling in deaf infants ===

Research has been conducted to determine whether or not infants with impaired hearing can demonstrate typical vocal sounds. Babbling can appear at the same age and in similar forms in hearing and deaf child, however, further continuation of babbling and speech development depends upon the ability for the child to hear themselves. For this reason, deaf children stop babbling vocally earlier than hearing children. Babbling should appear if the child is exposed to language, but vocal babbling can be delayed or non-existent for deaf children. It is not clear whether spoken language can develop fully without auditory experience. Deaf children are not only significantly delayed in spoken language development in comparison to their hearing counterparts, but they also produce fewer noises. This suggests that auditory experience is necessary in spoken language development. Some researchers have taken these findings as evidence against the hypothesis that language is an innate human capability.

A number of solutions have been used for hearing-impaired humans to gain auditory experience, one of which is hearing aids; they can be used to help infants reach babbling stages earlier. Cochlear implants have also been tested. Once the surgical implantation is complete, an infant has the opportunity to experience spoken language input. Once language has been heard, the infant begins to babble and speak in rhythmic patterns just as hearing infants do.

== Evidence across species ==

Though there is disagreement about the uniqueness of language to humans, babbling is not unique to the human species. Many animals produce similar ranges of sounds to human infants. These ranges of sounds are used in the young of many species to experiment with sound-making capabilities, or to practice for future vocal behavior. Similar to human infants, animal babbling is restricted by physiological development.

=== Songbirds ===

Not only are songbird and human language parallel regarding neural and molecular factors, they also are similar in how their communication is initially produced. Observations about these similarities can be traced back to Charles Darwin and his studies. Avian and mammalian brains are similar in form and connectivity and there may even be a gene that is relevant to speech found in both organisms. The learning of a song is produced through a mix of interaction, experience, and predisposition. Young songbirds will imitate their species&#x27; call when presented with songs from their own and another species. They are physically capable of producing either song, but do not. Humans learn language through similar means, which is why this early vocalization in songbirds is considered babbling.

Songbirds produce varieties of immature songs that are referred to as babbling because the immature songs precede those that are fully developed. As with humans, if these songs are reinforced with positive social feedback, they are more likely to recur. Other conspecifics provide feedback, especially the females in species for which only the males produce song. If females provide more social signals as feedback, males will develop more mature songs at a faster rate than other male birds. Young birds require reinforcement from adults in order to finalize their songs. Another relation to human infants is that the amount of vocalizations is not key, but rather the quality of the sounds that is retained and resembles the final produce of language.

The physiology of the animal is important. The properties of the ear and vocal tract, as well as the brain regions used in analyzing and processing information are critical determinants of how song is interpreted and later produced. In studies using isolated birds that have not had exposure to song, they produce an abnormal &#x27;isolate song&#x27; that nevertheless contains species-specific aspects. This shows that the neural pathways have predetermined features that allow for such a phenomenon to occur. The pathways are able to allow for plasticity of the songs that can be learned in the future.

There is an important phase in development when song learning is best accomplished. This phase is called the &#x27;sensitive period&#x27; and the amount of change that a songbird experiences in adulthood varies by species. Young birds have a production phase after a listening phase of development. The production of song is called &#x27;subsong&#x27; where vocalizations resemble that of an adult as time passes. Memory for songs is able to form before the period where learning to sing occurs. Social interaction is important in vocal learning where non-singing females can even influence an infant through feedback.

=== Pygmy marmoset (&quot;Cebuella pygmaea&quot;) ===

Pygmy marmosets have been studied and found to produce complex vocalizations 2–3 weeks after birth. Both sexes are capable of creating calls at a rate of 3 calls/second and each bout of calls can last up to 6 or 7 minutes. A normal series of calls by a pygmy marmoset contains approximately 10 different call types. This variety of call forms produced by this creature is comparable to babbling in human infants for a number of reasons. Like reduplicative babbling in humans, the call is often repeated several times before a new sequence of sounds is produced. The vocalizations gain attention from caregivers and provide practice for future vocal behavior. For these reasons, pygmy marmoset calls are seen as babbling behavior.

There are a total of 16 call types in pygmy marmoset babbling language. Different calls serve different survival functions such as when desiring food, social interaction or during times of alarm. As human infants have, marmoset babies have higher rates of social interaction when producing babbling sounds. During the juvenile age, marmosets often regress back to babbling stages if a new infant is born. It is suggested that their production of babbling calls increases because they are seeking attention and social interaction. Another babbling occurrence during the juvenile age is the addition of territorial calls and mild threat vocalizations. Although babbling is important for practising adult calls during the juvenile age, babbling decreases with age in pygmy marmosets. Overall, babbling progresses through a series of stages from infancy to adulthood and slowly leads to the construction of adult calls.

=== Sac-winged bat (&quot;Saccopteryx bilineata&quot;) ===

Babbling-like behavior in songbirds, humans and some nonhuman primates has been previously researched, but it has not been researched until recently in non-primate mammals. The sac-winged bat (&quot;Saccopteryx bilineata&quot;) is a social creature and the vocalizations that it produces depend on the social situation that the animal is in. This bat has a large repertoire of vocalizations with males being more vocal than females. Echolocation pulses, barks, chatters, and screeches are used in various social situations including courtship and territorial defense. Infants produce isolation calls if their mothers are absent, but the pups also produce vocalizations that mirror those of adults. Both sexes of infants babble, even though as an adult, the vocalizations are solely produced by males. Social context, mothers, and surrounding bats do not influence pups because the multiple vocalizations are combined regardless of the situation. Since there is not a social aspect correlated with the vocalizations, the productions of the sounds suggest that the pups vocalize for training. The pups repeat and combine adult vocalizations so that they resemble babbling in what humans, other primates and some songbirds do as infants. However, while human babbling increases social interactions, there are no social responses to babbling in bats. Babbling is common in infants that have a large repertoire of adult vocalizations to learn and this is seen in the pups of sac-winged bat.
