<text>Christopher Keith Irvine (born November 9, 1970), better known by the ring name Chris Jericho, is an American-Canadian professional wrestler, rock musician, and actor. As a wrestler, he has been signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW) , where he is the leader of The Learning Tree stable, and the two-time and current ROH World Champion in AEW&#x27;s sister promotion, Ring of Honor. Noted for his over-the-top rock star persona, in-ring technical wrestling prowess, and his ability to reinvent his character throughout the course of his career, Jericho has been named by journalists and industry colleagues as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time.

During the 1990s, Jericho performed for American organizations Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), as well as for promotions in countries such as Canada, Japan, and Mexico. In the latter half of 1999, he made his debut in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, renamed WWE in 2002). In 2001, he became the first Undisputed WWF Champion, and thus the final holder of the WCW World Heavyweight Championship (then referred to as the World Championship), having won and unified the WWF and World titles by defeating Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock on the same night. Jericho headlined multiple pay-per-view (PPV) events during his time with the WWF/WWE, including WrestleMania X8 and the inaugural and the Elimination Chamber matches and the shows itself. He was inducted into the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; Hall of Fame in 2010.

Jericho won the Undisputed WWF Championship once, the WCW/World Championship twice, and the World Heavyweight Championship (2002–2013 version) three times. He has also held the WWE Intercontinental Championship a record nine times and was the ninth Triple Crown Champion, as well as the fourth Grand Slam Champion in history. In addition, he was the 2008 Superstar of the Year Slammy Award winner and (along with Big Show as Jeri-Show) won the 2009 Tag Team of the Year Slammy Award—making him the only winner of both Superstar and Tag Team of the Year.

After his departure from WWE in 2018, Jericho signed with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he became a one-time IWGP Intercontinental Champion, becoming the first man to have held both the WWE and IWGP versions of the Intercontinental Championship. In January 2019, Jericho joined AEW and became the inaugural holder of the AEW World Championship in August of that year. While in AEW, Jericho would also capture the ROH World Championship (the main title of AEW&#x27;s sister promotion, Ring of Honor) at the 2022 &quot;Dynamite&quot;: Grand Slam event and the FTW Championship at Dynasty 2024.

In 1999, Jericho became the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Fozzy, who released their eponymous debut album the following year. The group&#x27;s early work is composed largely of cover versions, although they have focused primarily on original material from their third album, &quot;All That Remains&quot; (2005), onward. Jericho has also appeared on numerous television shows over the years, including the 2011 season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He hosted the ABC game show &quot;Downfall&quot;, the 2011 edition of the &quot;Revolver&quot; Golden Gods Awards, and the UK&#x27;s &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; Golden Gods Awards in 2012 and 2017.

== Early life ==
Christopher Keith Irvine was born in Manhasset, New York on November 9, 1970, the son of a Canadian couple. He is of Scottish descent from his father&#x27;s side and Ukrainian descent from his mother&#x27;s side. His father, ice hockey player Ted Irvine, had been playing for the New York Rangers at the time of Jericho&#x27;s birth. When his father retired, the family moved back to Winnipeg, Manitoba, where Irvine grew up. He holds dual American and Canadian citizenships. Irvine&#x27;s interest in professional wrestling began when he started watching the local American Wrestling Association (AWA) events that took place at the Winnipeg Arena with his family, and his desire to become a professional wrestler himself began when he saw footage of Owen Hart, then appearing with Stampede Wrestling, performing various high-flying moves. In addition, Irvine also cited Owen&#x27;s older brother Bret, Ricky Steamboat and Shawn Michaels as inspirations for him becoming a professional wrestler. His first experience with a professional wrestling promotion was when he acted as part of the ring crew for the first tour of the newly opened Keystone Wrestling Alliance promotion, where he learned important pointers from independent wrestlers Catfish Charlie and Caveman Broda. He attended Red River College in Winnipeg, graduating in 1990 with a diploma in Creative Communications.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1990–1991) ===
At the age of 19, he entered the Hart Brothers School of Wrestling, where he met Lance Storm on his first day. He was trained by Ed Langley and local Calgary wrestler Brad Young.

Two months after completing training, he was ready to start wrestling on independent shows, making his debut at the Moose Hall in Ponoka, Alberta, as &quot;Cowboy&quot; Chris Jericho, on October 2, 1990, in a ten-minute time limit draw against Storm. The pair then worked as a tag team, initially called Sudden Impact. According to a February 2019 interview with Rich Eisen on The Rich Eisen Show, Jericho stated that his initial name was going to be &quot;Jack Action&quot; however, someone remarked to him that the name was stupid, they then asked him what his name really was, he then got nervous and said &quot;Chris Jericho&quot;. He took the name Jericho from an album, &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot;, by German power metal band, Helloween. Jericho and Storm worked for Tony Condello in the tours of Northern Manitoba with Adam Copeland (Edge), Jason Reso (Christian) and Terry Gerin (Rhino). The pair also wrestled in Calgary&#x27;s Canadian National Wrestling Alliance (CNWA) and Canadian Rocky Mountain Wrestling (CRMW).

=== Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (1991-1992) ===
In 1991, Jericho and Storm started touring in Japan for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling as Sudden Impact, where he befriended Ricky Fuji, who also trained under Stu Hart.

===Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre and other Mexican promotions (1992–1995)===
In the winter of 1992, Jericho traveled to Mexico and competed under the name Leon D&#x27;Oro (&quot;Golden Lion&quot;, a name that fans voted on for him between &quot;He-Man&quot;, &quot;Chris Power&quot;, and his preferred choice &quot;Leon D&#x27;Oro&quot;), and later Corazón de León (&quot;Lion Heart&quot;), where he initially wrestled for several small wrestling companies in Nuevo León. In March 1993, Jericho appeared with the Universal Wrestling Association.

In April 1993, Jericho began competing in Mexico&#x27;s oldest promotion, Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). In CMLL, Jericho took on Silver King, Negro Casas, and Último Dragón en route to an 11-month reign as the NWA World Middleweight Champion that began in December 1993. Jericho made his final appearance with CMLL in September 1995, unsuccessfully challenging CMLL World Heavyweight Champion Apolo Dantés in the Arena Coliseo in Mexico City.

=== Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1994) ===
1994 saw Jericho reunited with Lance Storm, as The Thrillseekers in Jim Cornette&#x27;s Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) promotion, where they feuded with the likes of The Heavenly Bodies and Well Dunn.

=== Wrestling and Romance/WAR (1994–1996) ===
In late 1994, Jericho began competing regularly in Japan for Genichiro Tenryu&#x27;s Wrestling and Romance (later known as Wrestle Association &quot;R&quot;) (WAR) promotion as The Lion Heart. In November 1994, Último Dragón defeated him for the NWA World Middleweight Championship, which he had won while wrestling in Mexico.

In March 1995, Jericho lost to Gedo in the final of a tournament to crown the inaugural WAR International Junior Heavyweight Champion. He defeated Gedo for the championship in June 1995, losing it to Último Dragón the next month. In December 1995, Jericho competed in the second Super J-Cup tournament, defeating Hanzo Nakajima in the first round, but losing to Wild Pegasus in the second round.

In 1995, Jericho joined the heel stable Fuyuki-Gun (&quot;Fuyuki Army&quot;) with Hiromichi Fuyuki, Gedo, and Jado, adopting the name Lion Do. In February 1996, Jericho and Gedo won a tournament for the newly created International Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, defeating Lance Storm and Yuji Yasuraoka in the final. They lost the championship to Storm and Yasuraoka the following month. Jericho made his final appearances with WAR in July 1996, having wrestled a total of twenty-four tours for the company.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996) ===
Thanks in part to recommendations by Chris Benoit, Dave Meltzer and Perry Saturn, to promoter Paul Heyman, and after Mick Foley saw Jericho&#x27;s match against Último Dragón for the WAR International Junior Heavyweight Championship in July 1995 and gave a tape of the match to Heyman, Jericho began wrestling for the Philadelphia-based Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion in February 1996. In his second appearance, he defeated Rob Van Dam at the Big Apple Blizzard Blast. Jericho won the ECW World Television Championship from Pitbull #2 in June 1996 at Hardcore Heaven. While in ECW, Jericho wrestled Taz, Sabu, Rob Van Dam, Cactus Jack, Shane Douglas, and 2 Cold Scorpio. He made his final appearance at The Doctor Is In in August 1996. It was during this time that he drew the attention of World Championship Wrestling (WCW).

=== World Championship Wrestling (1996–1999) ===
==== Early appearances (1996–1997) ====
Jericho debuted for WCW on August 20, 1996, by defeating Mr. JL, which aired on the August 31 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. Jericho&#x27;s televised debut in WCW occurred on the August 26 episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; against Alex Wright in a match which ended in a no contest. He made his pay-per-view debut on September 15 against Chris Benoit in a losing effort at Fall Brawl. The following month, at Halloween Havoc, Jericho lost to nWo member Syxx due to biased officiating by nWo referee Nick Patrick. This led to a match between Jericho and Patrick at World War 3, which stipulated that Jericho&#x27;s one arm would be tied behind his back. Despite the odds stacked against him, Jericho won the match. Later that night, Jericho participated in the namesake battle royal for a future WCW World Heavyweight Championship match but failed to win the match.

Jericho represented WCW against nWo Japan member Masahiro Chono in a losing effort at the nWo Souled Out event. At SuperBrawl VII, Jericho unsuccessfully challenged Eddie Guerrero for the United States Heavyweight Championship.

==== Cruiserweight Champion (1997–1998) ====
On June 28, 1997, Jericho defeated Syxx at the &quot;Saturday Nitro&quot; live event in Los Angeles, California, to win the WCW Cruiserweight Championship for the first time, thus winning the first championship of his WCW career. Jericho successfully defended the title against Ultimo Dragon at Bash at the Beach, before losing the title to Alex Wright on the July 28 episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;. Jericho unsuccessfully challenged Wright for the title at Road Wild, before defeating Wright in a rematch to win his second Cruiserweight Championship on the August 16 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. Jericho began feuding with Eddie Guerrero over the title as he successfully defended the title against Guerrero at Clash of the Champions XXXV before losing the title to Guerrero at Fall Brawl. Jericho defeated Gedo at Halloween Havoc. At World War 3, Jericho participated in the namesake battle royal but failed to win.

On the January 15, 1998, episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, Jericho defeated Eddie Guerrero to earn a title shot against Rey Mysterio Jr. for the Cruiserweight Championship at Souled Out. Jericho won the match by forcing Mysterio to submit to the &quot;Liontamer&quot;. After the match, Jericho turned heel by assaulting Mysterio&#x27;s knee with a toolbox. In the storyline, Mysterio needed six months of recovery before he could return to the ring. Jericho then had a short feud with Juventud Guerrera in which Guerrera repeatedly requested a shot at Jericho&#x27;s Cruiserweight Championship, but Jericho constantly rebuffed him. The feud culminated in a title versus mask match at SuperBrawl VIII. Guerrera lost the match and was forced to remove his mask. Following this match, Jericho began his ongoing gimmick of collecting and wearing to the ring trophy items from his defeated opponents, such as Guerrera&#x27;s mask, Prince Iaukea&#x27;s Hawaiian dress, and a headband from Disco Inferno.
Jericho then began a long feud with Dean Malenko, in which Jericho repeatedly claimed he was a better wrestler than Malenko, but refused to wrestle him. Because of his mastery of technical wrestling, Malenko was known as &quot;The Man of 1,000 Holds&quot;, so Jericho claimed to be &quot;The Man of 1,004 Holds&quot;; Jericho mentions in his autobiography that this line originated from an IWA interview he saw as a child, where manager Floyd Creatchman claimed that Leo Burke, the first professional wrestler to be known as &quot;The Man of 1,000 Holds&quot;, was now known as &quot;The Man of 1,002 Holds&quot;, to which Floyd Creatchman stated that &quot;he learned two more&quot;.

During the March 30, 1998, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, after defeating Marty Jannetty, Jericho pulled out a long pile of paper that listed each of the 1,004 holds he knew and recited them to the audience. Many of the holds were fictional, and nearly every other hold was an armbar. On the March 12, 1998, episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, Malenko defeated a wrestler wearing Juventud Guerrera&#x27;s mask who appeared to be Jericho. However, the masked wrestler was actually Lenny Lane, whom Jericho bribed to appear in the match. This started a minor feud between Lane and Jericho after Jericho refused to pay Lane. At Uncensored, Jericho finally wrestled Malenko and defeated him, after which Malenko took a leave of absence from wrestling. Jericho then proceeded to bring with him to the ring a portrait of Malenko that he insulted and demeaned. Just prior to Slamboree, J. J. Dillon (referred to by Jericho as &quot;Jo Jo&quot;) scheduled a cruiserweight Battle Royal, the winner of which would immediately have a shot at Jericho&#x27;s Cruiserweight Championship. Jericho accepted on the grounds that whoever he faced would be too tired to win a second match. At Slamboree, Jericho came out to introduce the competitors in an insulting fashion before the match started and then went backstage for coffee. An individual who appeared to be Ciclope won the battle royal after Juventud Guerrera shook his hand and then eliminated himself. The winner was a returning Malenko in disguise. Following one of the loudest crowd reactions in WCW history, Malenko proceeded to defeat Jericho for the championship. Jericho claimed he was the victim of a carefully planned conspiracy to get the belt off of him. He at first blamed the WCW locker room, then added Dillon, Ted Turner, and finally in a vignette, he walked around Washington, D.C., with the sign &quot;conspiracy victim&quot; and accused President Bill Clinton of being one of the conspirators after being rejected from a meeting. Eventually, Malenko vacated the title. Jericho ended up defeating Malenko at The Great American Bash to win the vacant title after Malenko was disqualified after hitting Jericho with a chair. The next night, Malenko was suspended for his actions.

At Bash at the Beach, the recently returned Rey Mysterio Jr. (who had recovered from his knee injury) defeated Jericho in a No Disqualification match after the still-suspended Malenko interfered. Jericho regained the Cruiserweight Championship from Mysterio the next night after he interrupted J. J. Dillon while Dillon was giving the championship to Mysterio. Jericho was again awarded the championship. Eventually, Jericho decisively lost the title to Juventud Guerrera in a match at Road Wild with Malenko as special referee.

==== World Television Champion (1998–1999) ====
On August 10, Jericho defeated Stevie Ray to win the World Television Championship (Stevie Ray substituting for the champion Booker T). Soon afterward, Jericho repeatedly called out WCW World Heavyweight Champion Goldberg in an attempt to begin a feud with him, but never actually wrestled him. Jericho cites Eric Bischoff, Goldberg and Hulk Hogan&#x27;s refusal to book Jericho in a pay-per-view squash match loss against Goldberg, which Jericho felt would be a big draw, as a major reason for leaving the company.

On November 30, Jericho lost the World Television Championship to Konnan. In early 1999, Jericho began a feud with Perry Saturn. The feud saw Jericho and Saturn instigating bizarre stipulation matches, such as at Souled Out, where Jericho defeated Saturn in a &quot;loser must wear a dress&quot; match. At SuperBrawl IX, Jericho and Saturn wrestled in a &quot;dress&quot; match which Jericho won. Saturn finally defeated Jericho at Uncensored in a Dog Collar match. Jericho alternated between WCW and a number of Japanese tours before he signed a contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on June 30. Jericho&#x27;s final WCW match came during a Peoria, Illinois, house show July 21, where he and Eddie Guerrero lost to Billy Kidman and Rey Mysterio Jr. in a tag team match.

Fifteen years after Jericho&#x27;s departure from WCW, his best known entrance music within the company, &quot;One Crazed Anarchist&quot;, lent its name to the second single from his band Fozzy&#x27;s 2014 album, &quot;Do You Wanna Start a War&quot;.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1997–1998) ===
In January 1997, Jericho made his debut for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), who had a working agreement with WCW, as Super Liger, the masked nemesis of Jyushin Thunder Liger. According to Jericho, Super Liger&#x27;s first match against Koji Kanemoto at Wrestling World 1997 was so poorly received that the gimmick was dropped instantly. Jericho botched several moves in the match and complained he had difficulty seeing through the mask. The following six months, Jericho worked for New Japan unmasked, before being called back by WCW. On September 23, 1998, Jericho made a one-night-only return to NJPW at that years Big Wednesday show, teaming with Black Tiger against IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions Shinjiro Otani and Tatsuhito Takaiwa in a title match, which Jericho and Tiger lost.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1999–2005) ===
==== Intercontinental Champion (1999–2001) ====

In the weeks before Jericho&#x27;s debut, a clock labeled &quot;countdown to the new millennium&quot; appeared on WWF programming. On the home video, &quot;Break Down the Walls&quot;, Jericho states he was inspired to do this as his entrance when he saw a similar clock in a post office and Vince McMahon approved its use as his introduction to the WWF. The clock finally ran out on the August 9 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; in Chicago, Illinois while The Rock was in the ring cutting a promo on the Big Show. Jericho entered the arena and proclaimed &quot;&quot;Raw&quot; Is Jericho&quot; and that he had &quot;come to save the World Wrestling Federation&quot;, referring to himself as &quot;Y2J&quot; (a play on the Y2K bug). The Rock proceeded to verbally mock him for his interruption. Later that month, he would interact with several superstars including in particular interrupting a promo that The Undertaker was involved in, Jericho made his in-ring debut as a heel on August 26, losing a match against Road Dogg by disqualification on the inaugural episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; after he performed a powerbomb on Road Dogg through a table.

Jericho&#x27;s first long-term feud was with Chyna, for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. After losing to Chyna at Survivor Series on November 14, Jericho defeated her to win his first WWF Intercontinental Championship at Armageddon on December 12. This feud included a controversial decision during a rematch in which two separate referees declared each one of them the winner of a match for the title. As a result, they became co-champions, during which Jericho turned face. He attained sole champion status at the Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, by defeating Chyna and Hardcore Holly in a Triple Threat match.

Jericho lost the WWF Intercontinental title to then-European Champion Kurt Angle at No Way Out on February 27. Jericho competed in a Triple Threat match against Chris Benoit and Angle at WrestleMania 2000 on April 2 in a two-falls contest with both of Angle&#x27;s titles at stake. Jericho won the European Championship by pinning Benoit, after Benoit pinned Jericho to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship. This was the first of six pay-per-view matches between the pair within twelve months. Jericho was originally supposed to be in the main event of WrestleMania, but was taken out after Mick Foley, who was originally asked by writers to be in the match, took his place. Jericho was even advertised on the event&#x27;s posters promoting the match. Jericho lost the title the next night to Eddie Guerrero on &quot;Raw is War&quot; after Chyna sided with Guerrero.

On the April 17 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Jericho upset Triple H in a WWF Championship match. Referee Earl Hebner made a fast count when Jericho pinned Triple H, causing Jericho to win the title. Hebner later reversed the decision due to pressure from Triple H, and WWE does not recognize Jericho&#x27;s reign as champion. On April 19, Jericho defeated Eddie Guerrero at the Gary Albright Memorial Show organized by World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW). On the May 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Jericho defeated Benoit to win his third WWF Intercontinental Championship but lost the title to Benoit four days later on &quot;Raw is War&quot;. Jericho&#x27;s feud with Triple H ended at Fully Loaded on July 23, when they competed in a Last Man Standing match. Jericho lost the match to Triple H only by one second, despite the repeated assistance Triple H&#x27;s wife, Stephanie, provided him in the match.

At the Royal Rumble on January 21, 2001, Jericho defeated Chris Benoit in a ladder match to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship for the fourth time. At WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1, he successfully defended his title in a match against William Regal, only to lose it four days later to Triple H. At Judgment Day on May 20, Jericho and Benoit won a tag team turmoil match and earned a shot at Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H for their WWF Tag Team Championship on &quot;Raw&quot; the next night. Benoit and Jericho won the match, in which Triple H legitimately tore his quadriceps, spending the rest of the year injured. Benoit and Jericho each became a WWF Tag Team Champion for the first time. The team defended their title in the first fatal four-way Tables, Ladders and Chairs match on the May 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, where Benoit sustained a year-long injury after missing a diving headbutt through a table. Despite Benoit being carried out on a stretcher, he returned to the match to climb the ladder and retain the championship. The two lost the title one month later to The Dudley Boyz on the June 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. At King of the Ring on June 24, both Benoit and Jericho competed in a triple threat match for Austin&#x27;s WWF Championship, in which Booker T interfered as the catalyst for The Invasion angle. Despite Booker T&#x27;s interference, Austin retained the title.

==== Undisputed WWF Champion (2001–2002) ====
In the following months, Jericho became a major force in The Invasion storyline in which WCW and ECW joined forces to overtake the WWF. Jericho remained on the side of the WWF despite previously competing in WCW and ECW. However, Jericho began showing jealousy toward fellow WWF member The Rock. They faced each other in a match at No Mercy on October 21 for the WCW Championship after Jericho defeated Rob Van Dam in a number one contenders match on the October 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Jericho won the WCW Championship at No Mercy when he pinned The Rock after debuting a new finisher, the &quot;Breakdown,&quot; onto a steel chair, winning his first world title in the process. One night later, the two put their differences aside and won the WWF Tag Team Championship from the Dudley Boyz.

After they lost the titles to Test and Booker T on the November 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, they continued their feud. On the November 5 episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; The Rock defeated Jericho to regain the WCW Championship. Following the match, Jericho attacked The Rock with a steel chair. At Survivor Series on November 18, Jericho turned heel by almost costing Team WWF the victory after he was eliminated in their Winner Take All matchup by once again attacking The Rock. Despite this, Team WWF won the match. At Vengeance on December 9, Jericho defeated both The Rock for the World Championship (formerly the WCW Championship) and Stone Cold Steve Austin for his first WWF Championship on the same night to become the first wrestler to hold both championships at the same time, which made him the first-ever Undisputed WWF Champion, as well as the fourth Grand Slam winner under the original format. He retained the title at the Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002, against The Rock and at No Way Out on February 17 against Austin. Jericho later lost the title to Royal Rumble winner Triple H in the main event of WrestleMania X8 on March 17. Jericho was later drafted to the SmackDown! brand in the inaugural WWF draft lottery. He would then appear at Backlash on April 21, interfering in Triple H&#x27;s Undisputed WWF Championship match against Hollywood Hulk Hogan. He was quickly dumped out the ring, but Triple H would go on to lose the match. This would lead to a Hell in a Cell match at Judgment Day on May 19, where Triple H would emerge victorious. Jericho would then compete in the 2002 King of the Ring tournament, defeating Edge and The Big Valbowski to advance to the semi-finals, where he was defeated by Rob Van Dam at King of the Ring on June 23. In July, he began a feud with the debuting John Cena, losing to him at Vengeance on July 21.

==== Teaming and feuding with Christian (2002–2004) ====

After his feud with Cena ended, Jericho moved to the Raw brand on the July 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, unwilling to work for SmackDown! General Manager Stephanie McMahon. Upon his arrival to the brand, he initiated a feud with Ric Flair, leading to a match at SummerSlam on August 25, which Jericho lost. On the September 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he won the WWE Intercontinental Championship for the fifth time from Rob Van Dam, before losing the title to Kane two weeks later on &quot;Raw&quot;. He then later formed a tag team with Christian, with whom he won the World Tag Team Championship by defeating Kane and The Hurricane on the October 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Christian and Jericho lost the titles to Booker T and Goldust in a fatal four-way elimination match, involving the teams of The Dudley Boyz, and William Regal and Lance Storm at Armageddon on December 15.
On the January 13, 2003 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho won an over-the-top-rope challenge against Kane, Rob Van Dam, and Batista to select his entry number for the Royal Rumble match on January 19. He chose number two in order to start the match with Shawn Michaels, who had challenged him to prove Jericho&#x27;s claims that he was better than Michaels. After Michaels&#x27;s entrance, Jericho entered as the second participant. Christian, in Jericho&#x27;s attire, appeared while the real Jericho attacked Shawn from behind. He eliminated Michaels shortly afterward, but Michaels got his revenge later in the match by causing Test to eliminate Jericho. Jericho spent the most time of any other wrestler in that same Royal Rumble. Jericho simultaneously feuded with Test, Michaels, and Jeff Hardy, defeating Hardy at No Way Out on February 23. Jericho and Michaels fought again at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, which Michaels won. Jericho, however, attacked Michaels with a low blow after the match following an embrace.

After this match, Jericho entered a rivalry with Goldberg, which was fueled by Goldberg&#x27;s refusal to fight Jericho in WCW. During Jericho&#x27;s first episode of the &quot;Highlight Reel&quot;, an interview segment, where Goldberg was the guest, he complained that no one wanted Goldberg in WWE and continued to insult him in the following weeks. On the May 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, a mystery assailant attempted to run over Goldberg with a limousine. A week later, Co-Raw General Manager, Stone Cold Steve Austin, interrogated several Raw superstars to find out who was driving the car. One of the interrogates was Lance Storm, who admitted that he was the assailant. Austin forced Storm into a match with Goldberg, who defeated Storm. After the match, Goldberg forced Storm to admit that Jericho was the superstar who conspired Storm into running him over. On the May 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Goldberg was once again a guest on the &quot;Highlight Reel&quot;. Jericho expressed jealousy towards Goldberg&#x27;s success in WCW and felt that since joining WWE, he had achieved everything he had ever wanted in his career and all that was left was to defeat Goldberg and challenged him to a match. At Bad Blood on June 15, Goldberg settled the score with Jericho and defeated him.

On the October 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho won his sixth WWE Intercontinental Championship when he defeated Rob Van Dam. He lost the title back to Van Dam immediately after in a steel cage match. Later in 2003, Jericho started a romance with Trish Stratus while his tag team partner Christian began one with Lita. This, however, turned out to be a bet over who could sleep with their respective paramour first, with a Canadian dollar at stake. Stratus overheard this and ended her relationship with Jericho, who seemingly felt bad for using Stratus. After he saved her from an attack by Kane, Stratus agreed that the two of them could just be &quot;friends&quot;, thus turning Jericho face for the first time since 2001. After Christian put Stratus in the &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot; while competing against her in a match, Jericho sought revenge on Christian, which led to a match at WrestleMania XX on March 14, 2004. Christian defeated Jericho after Stratus ran down and &quot;inadvertently&quot; struck Jericho (thinking it was Christian) and Christian got the roll-up. After the match, Stratus turned on Jericho and revealed that she and Christian were a couple. This revelation led to a handicap match at Backlash on April 18 that Jericho won. Jericho won his record-breaking seventh WWE Intercontinental Championship at Unforgiven on September 12 in a ladder match against Christian, breaking the previous record held by Jeff Jarrett from 1999. Jericho&#x27;s seventh reign was short lived, as he lost it at Taboo Tuesday on October 19 to Shelton Benjamin.

==== World championship pursuits and departure (2004–2005) ====
Jericho teamed up with Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, and Maven to take on Triple H, Batista, Edge, and Gene Snitsky at Survivor Series on November 14. The match stipulated that each member of the winning team would be the general manager of Raw over the next four weeks. Jericho&#x27;s team won, and took turns as general manager. During Jericho&#x27;s turn as general manager, the World Heavyweight Championship was vacated because a Triple Threat match for the title a week earlier ended in a draw. At New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 9, 2005, Jericho competed in the Elimination Chamber against Triple H, Chris Benoit, Batista, Randy Orton, and Edge for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. Jericho began the match with Benoit and eliminated Edge, but was eliminated by Batista. Triple H went on to win. At WrestleMania 21 on April 3, Jericho participated in the first ever Money in the Bank ladder match. Jericho suggested the match concept, and he competed in the match against Shelton Benjamin, Chris Benoit, Kane, Christian, and Edge. Jericho lost the match when Edge claimed the briefcase.

At Backlash on May 1, Jericho challenged Shelton Benjamin for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, but lost the match. Jericho lost to Lance Storm at ECW One Night Stand on June 12. Jericho used his old &quot;Lionheart&quot; gimmick, instead of his more well known &quot;Y2J&quot; gimmick. Jericho lost the match after Jason and Justin Credible hit Jericho with a Singapore cane, which allowed Storm to win the match. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho turned heel by betraying WWE Champion John Cena after defeating Christian and Tyson Tomko in a tag team match. Jericho lost a Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship at Vengeance on June 26 which also involved Christian and Cena. The feud continued throughout the summer and Jericho lost to Cena in a WWE Championship match at SummerSlam on August 21.

The next night on the August 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho faced Cena for the WWE Championship again in a rematch, this time in a &quot;You&#x27;re fired&quot; match. Cena won again, and Jericho was fired by Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff. Jericho was carried out of the arena by security as Kurt Angle attacked Cena. Jericho&#x27;s WWE contract expired on August 25.

=== Return to WWE (2007–2010) ===
==== Feud with Shawn Michaels (2007–2008) ====

After a two-year hiatus, WWE promoted Jericho&#x27;s return starting on the September 24, 2007, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; with a viral marketing campaign using a series of 15-second cryptic binary code videos, similar to the matrix digital rain used in &quot;The Matrix&quot; series. The videos contained hidden messages and biblical links related to Jericho. Jericho made his return to WWE television as a face on the November 19, 2007, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when he interrupted Randy Orton during Orton&#x27;s orchestrated &quot;passing of the torch&quot; ceremony. Jericho revealed his intentions to reclaim the WWE Championship in order to &quot;save&quot; WWE fans from Orton. On the November 26 episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; Jericho defeated Santino Marella and debuted a new finishing move called the &quot;Codebreaker.&quot; At Armageddon on December 16, he competed in a WWE Championship match against Orton, defeating him by disqualification when &quot;SmackDown!&quot;&#x27;s color commentator John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) interfered in the match, but Orton retained the title. He began a feud with JBL and met him at the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2008. Jericho was disqualified after hitting JBL with a steel chair. On the March 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho captured the WWE Intercontinental Championship for a record eighth time when he defeated Jeff Hardy.

In April 2008, Jericho became involved in the ongoing feud between Shawn Michaels and Batista when he suggested that Michaels enjoyed retiring Ric Flair, causing Shawn Michaels to attack him. Jericho thus asked to be inserted into the match between Batista and Michaels at Backlash on April 27, but instead, he was appointed as the special guest referee. During the match at Backlash, Michaels feigned a knee injury so that Jericho would give him time to recover and lured Batista in for Sweet Chin Music for the win. After Backlash, Jericho accused Michaels of cheating, but Michaels continued to play up an injury. When Jericho was finally convinced and he apologized to Michaels for not believing him, Michaels then admitted to Jericho that he had faked his injury and he attacked Jericho with Sweet Chin Music. After losing to Michaels at Judgment Day on May 18, Jericho initiated a handshake after the match.

On the June 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho hosted his talk show segment, &quot;The Highlight Reel&quot;, interviewing Michaels. Jericho pointed out that Michaels was still cheered by the fans despite Michaels&#x27;s deceit and attack on Jericho during the previous months, whereas Jericho was booed when he tried to do the right thing. Jericho then assaulted Michaels with a low blow and sent Michaels through the &quot;Jeritron 6000&quot; television, damaging the eye of Michaels, and turning heel in the process. This began what was named by both Pro Wrestling Illustrated and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter the &quot;Feud of the Year&quot;. At Night of Champions on June 29, Jericho lost the Intercontinental Championship to Kofi Kingston after a distraction by Michaels. In June, Jericho took on Lance Cade as a protégé.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (2008–2009) ====

Afterward, Jericho developed a suit-wearing persona inspired by Javier Bardem&#x27;s character Anton Chigurh from the 2007 film &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; and wrestler Nick Bockwinkel. Jericho and Michaels met at The Great American Bash on July 20, which Jericho won after attacking the cut on Michaels&#x27;s eye. At SummerSlam on August 17, Michaels said that his eye damage would force him to retire and insulted Jericho by saying he would never achieve Michaels&#x27;s success. Jericho tried to attack Michaels, but Michaels ducked, so Jericho punched Michaels&#x27;s wife, Rebecca, instead. As a result, they fought in an unsanctioned match at Unforgiven on September 7, which Jericho lost by referee stoppage. Later that night, Jericho entered the Championship Scramble match as a late replacement for the defending champion CM Punk and subsequently won the World Heavyweight Championship, defeating Batista, John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL), Kane, and Rey Mysterio. It was announced that Michaels would challenge Jericho for the World Heavyweight Championship in a ladder match at No Mercy on October 5, which Jericho won. At Cyber Sunday on October 26, Jericho lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Batista, but later won it back eight days later on November 3 on the 800th episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in a steel cage match. Jericho defeated Michaels in a Last Man Standing match on the November 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; after interference from JBL. Jericho lost the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series on November 23 to the returning John Cena. On the December 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho was awarded the Slammy Award for 2008 Superstar of the Year award. Six days later, he lost his rematch with John Cena for the World Heavyweight Championship at Armageddon on December 14.

At the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2009, Jericho participated in the Royal Rumble match, but he was eliminated by the Undertaker. On February 15 at No Way Out, he competed in an Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship, but he failed to win as he was eliminated by Rey Mysterio. Following this, Jericho began a rivalry with veteran wrestlers Ric Flair, Ricky Steamboat, Jimmy Snuka and Roddy Piper, as well as actor Mickey Rourke. Jericho was originally arranged to face Rourke at WrestleMania 25 on April 5, but Rourke later pulled out of the event. Instead, Jericho defeated Piper, Snuka and Steamboat in a 3-on-1 elimination handicap match at WrestleMania, but was knocked out by Rourke after the match.

On the April 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2009 WWE draft. Jericho then faced Steamboat in a singles match at Backlash on April 26, where Jericho was victorious. In May, Jericho started a feud with Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio, leading to a match at Judgment Day on May 17, which Jericho lost. However, Jericho defeated Mysterio in a No Holds Barred Match at Extreme Rules on June 7 to win his ninth Intercontinental Championship, breaking his own record again. At The Bash on June 28, Jericho lost the Intercontinental Championship back to Mysterio in a mask vs. title match.

==== Jeri-Show and feud with Edge (2009–2010) ====
Later in the event, Jericho and his partner Edge won the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship as surprise entrants in a triple threat tag team match. As a result of this win, Jericho became the first wrestler to win every (original) Grand Slam eligible championship. Shortly thereafter Edge suffered an injury and Jericho revealed a clause in his contract to allow Edge to be replaced and Jericho&#x27;s reign to continue uninterrupted. At Night of Champions on July 26, Jericho revealed Big Show as his new tag team partner, creating a team that would come to called Jeri-Show. The duo defeated Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase to retain the championship. Jeri-Show successfully defended the title against Cryme Tyme at SummerSlam on August 23, MVP and Mark Henry at Breaking Point on September 13 and Rey Mysterio and Batista at Hell in a Cell on October 4. At Survivor Series on November 22, both Jericho and Big Show took part in a triple threat match for the World Heavyweight Championship, but the Undertaker successfully retained the title. At on December 13, Jeri-Show lost the tag titles to D-Generation X (DX) (Shawn Michaels and Triple H) in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match. As a member of the SmackDown brand, Jericho could only appear on &quot;Raw&quot; as a champion and DX intentionally disqualified themselves in a rematch to force Jericho off the show. On the January 4, 2010, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, DX defeated Jeri-Show to retain the championship once again, marking the end of Jeri-Show.

Jericho entered the 2010 Royal Rumble match on January 31, but was eliminated by the returning Edge, his former tag team partner, who went on to win the match. At Elimination Chamber on February 21, Jericho won the World Heavyweight Championship in an Elimination Chamber match, defeating The Undertaker, John Morrison, Rey Mysterio, CM Punk and R-Truth following interference from Shawn Michaels. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge used his Royal Rumble win to challenge Jericho for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXVI on March 28. Jericho defeated Edge at WrestleMania to retain the title, but lost the championship to Jack Swagger on the following episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, who cashed in his Money in the Bank contract. Jericho then failed to regain the title from Swagger in a triple-threat match also involving Edge on the April 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. Jericho and Edge continued their feud leading into Extreme Rules on April 25, where Jericho was defeated in a steel cage match.

Jericho was drafted to the Raw brand in the 2010 WWE draft. He formed a brief tag team with The Miz and unsuccessfully challenged The Hart Dynasty for the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship at Over the Limit on May 23. A month later, Jericho lost to Evan Bourne at Fatal 4-Way on June 20, but won a rematch during the following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, where he put his career on the line. On the July 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after being assaulted by The Nexus, Jericho teamed with rivals Edge, John Morrison, R-Truth, Daniel Bryan and Bret Hart in a team led by John Cena to face The Nexus at SummerSlam on August 15. Jericho and Cena bickered over leadership of the team, which led to him and Edge attacking Cena during the SummerSlam match that they won.

Jericho was punished for not showing solidarity against The Nexus, when he was removed from a Six-Pack Challenge for Sheamus&#x27;s WWE Championship at Night of Champions on September 19. Although he re-earned his place in the match after defeating The Hart Dynasty in a handicap steel cage match, he was the first man eliminated from the match at Night of Champions. On the September 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho faced Randy Orton who punted him in the head. This was used to explain Jericho&#x27;s departure from WWE.

=== Second return to WWE (2011–2018, 2022) ===
==== Feud with CM Punk (2011–2012) ====

Beginning in November 2011, WWE aired cryptic vignettes that promoted a wrestler&#x27;s return, making his appearance on January 2, 2012, episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;. He participated in the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble on January 29, he was eliminated last by Sheamus. Leading to WrestleMania XXVIII on April 1, Jericho feuded with WWE Champion CM Punk over the moniker &quot;the Best in the World&quot;. In a bid to psychologically unsettle Punk, Jericho revealed that Punk&#x27;s father was an alcoholic and Punk&#x27;s sister was a drug addict, which contradicted Punk&#x27;s straight edge philosophy. Jericho faced Punk for the title at WrestleMania and Extreme Rules on April 29 in a Chicago Street Fight, but Punk won both matches.
==== Championship pursuits (2012–2013) ====
On May 24 at a WWE live event in Brazil, Jericho wrestled a match against CM Punk, during which Jericho kicked a Brazilian flag, causing local police to intervene and threaten Jericho with arrest. Jericho issued an apology to the audience, enabling the event to resume. The following day, WWE suspended Jericho for 30 days while apologizing to the people and government of Brazil. Jericho returned on the June 25 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, and his absence was explained by a European tour with his band Fozzy which happened to coincide with his suspension. After losing the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match on July 15, Jericho feuded with the newly crowned Mr. Money in the Bank, Dolph Ziggler, turning face for the first time since 2008. Despite Jericho defeating Ziggler at SummerSlam on August 19, he lost to Ziggler the following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, and, as a result, Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho was terminated from WWE. This was used to write him off so he could tour with Fozzy for the remainder of the year.

On January 27, 2013, Jericho returned after a five-month hiatus entering the Royal Rumble match as the second entrant. Jericho lasted over 47 minutes before being eliminated by Dolph Ziggler. On the March 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Miz and Jericho faced Wade Barrett for the Intercontinental Championship, but Barrett retained his title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw3/18/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho asked Vince McMahon to face Barrett and win his 10th Intercontinental title at WrestleMania 29 on April 7, but he was booked in a feud with Fandango, losing to Fandango at WrestleMania, but Jericho won a rematch at Extreme Rules on May 19. He then faced the returning CM Punk at Payback on June 16, where he was defeated. Jericho then began feuding with Ryback, which led to a singles match on July 14 at Money in the Bank, where Ryback emerged victorious. On the July 19 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Jericho unsuccessfully challenged Curtis Axel for the WWE Intercontinental Championship and was afterwards attacked by Ryback. This was done to write Jericho off television as he was taking a temporary hiatus to tour with Fozzy for the remainder of the year and possibly January and February.

In a November interview for WWE.com, Jericho revealed that he would not be a full-time wrestler due to his musical and acting ventures.

==== Various sporadic feuds (2014–2016) ====
After an eleven-month hiatus, Jericho returned on the June 30, 2014, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, attacking The Miz, who had also returned minutes earlier. The Wyatt Family then interrupted and ultimately attacked Jericho. Jericho faced Bray Wyatt at Battleground on July 20 in a winning effort. At SummerSlam on August 17, with Wyatt Family members Luke Harper and Erick Rowan banned from ringside, Wyatt picked up the victory. On the September 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho lost to Wyatt in a steel cage match, ending the feud. Jericho then feuded with Randy Orton, who had attacked him the week before after his match against Wyatt in the trainers room. Orton defeated him at Night of Champions on September 21. Throughout the rest of October and November, Jericho wrestled exclusively at live events, defeating Bray Wyatt. Jericho returned to WWE television in December as the guest general manager of the December 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Jericho booked himself in a street fight against Paul Heyman in the main event, which led to the return of Brock Lesnar. Before the match could begin, Lesnar attacked Jericho with an &quot;F-5&quot;.
In January 2015, Jericho revealed that he signed an exclusive WWE contract, under which he would compete at 16 house shows only. He later signed a similar contract once the former expired and competed at house shows throughout the rest of 2015. During this time he wrestled against the likes of Luke Harper, Kevin Owens and King Barrett in winning efforts. In May 2015, Jericho was one of the hosts of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;&#x27;s sixth season. Jericho also hosted two &quot;Live! With Chris Jericho&quot; specials on the WWE Network during 2015; his guests were John Cena and Stephanie McMahon. Jericho made his televised return at The Beast in the East on July 4, defeating Neville. At Night of Champions on September 20, Jericho was revealed as the mystery partner of Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose, facing The Wyatt Family in a losing effort. On October 3, Jericho unsuccessfully challenged Kevin Owens for the WWE Intercontinental Championship at Live from Madison Square Garden. The match marked 20 years since Jericho&#x27;s debut with ECW while also celebrating his 25th year as a professional wrestler in total.

On the January 4, 2016, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho returned to in-ring competition full-time and confronted The New Day. At the Royal Rumble on January 24, Jericho entered as the sixth entrant, lasting over 50 minutes, before being eliminated by Dean Ambrose. On the January 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho faced the recently debuted AJ Styles in a losing effort. Following the match, after initial hesitation by Jericho, the pair shook hands. On the February 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Jericho defeated Styles. At Fastlane on February 21, Styles was victorious in a third match between the pair. On the February 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho and Styles formed a tag team, dubbed Y2AJ. Following their loss against The New Day on the March 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho attacked Styles, ending their alliance, claiming that he was sick of the fans chanting for Styles instead of him, turning heel in the process. Their feud culminated at WrestleMania 32 on April 3, where Jericho defeated Styles. However, on the April 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho competed in a fatal-four-way match against Styles, Kevin Owens and Cesaro to determine the No. 1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort after being pinned by Styles, ending their feud.

The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Dean Ambrose interrupted &quot;The Highlight Reel&quot;, handing Jericho a note from Shane McMahon replacing the show with &quot;The Ambrose Asylum&quot;, igniting a feud between the two. During this time, Jericho tweaked his gimmick. He became arrogant and childish while wearing expensive scarfs and calling everyone who appeased him &quot;stupid idiots&quot;. At Payback on May 1, Jericho faced Ambrose in a losing effort. After attacking one another and Ambrose destroying Jericho&#x27;s light-up ring jacket, Jericho was challenged by Ambrose to an Asylum match at Extreme Rules on May 22, where Ambrose again defeated Jericho after Jericho was thrown in a pile of thumbtacks. On the May 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho defeated Apollo Crews to qualify for the Money in the Bank ladder match at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view on June 19, where Jericho was unsuccessful as the match was won by Ambrose. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Jericho was drafted to the Raw brand. At Battleground on July 24, Jericho hosted a &quot;Highlight Reel&quot; segment with the returning Randy Orton, where he took an &quot;RKO&quot; from Orton after he insulted him. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho competed in a fatal four-way match to determine the number one contender for the newly created WWE Universal Championship at SummerSlam on August 21, but he was unsuccessful, as Roman Reigns won the match.

==== The List of Jericho (2016–2017) ====

At SummerSlam, Jericho and Kevin Owens defeated Enzo and Cass. Both wrestlers began an alliance, allowing Owens to win the WWE Universal Championship.

Jericho also started a new character, where he began a list called &quot;The List of Jericho&quot;, where he wrote down the name of the person that bothered him and why. If someone annoyed Jericho, he would ask &quot;you know what happens?&quot; before shouting &quot;you just made the list!&quot; and writing the person&#x27;s name down. The List of Jericho soon became incredibly popular with the fans, with many critics describing Jericho and his list as &quot;easily one of the best moments of &quot;Raw&quot;&#x27;s broadcast&quot;. During Owens&#x27; reign, Jericho assisted him to retain the title. Jericho also defeated Roman Reigns in a handicap match also involving Owens on the January 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to win the WWE United States title, becoming Grand Slam winner under the current format. Due to interfering multiple times in Owens&#x27;s matches, Jericho was suspended above the ring in a shark proof cage during Reigns&#x27;s rematch at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view event. Owens nonetheless retained the championship after Braun Strowman, taking advantage of the added no disqualification stipulation, interfered. Also at the event, Jericho entered as the second entrant in the Royal Rumble match, lasting over an hour (thus breaking the record with a cumulative time of over five hours) and being the third to last before being eliminated by Reigns.

In February, a feud started between Jericho and Owens after Jericho accepted a Universal Championship challenge from Goldberg on Owens&#x27;s behalf. On the February 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho held a &quot;Festival of Friendship&quot; for Owens, who attacked Jericho, ending their alliance. Jericho returned at Fastlane on March 5, distracting Owens during his match with Goldberg and causing Owens to lose the Universal Championship, turning face again in the process. This led to a match between Jericho and Owens at WrestleMania 33, where Jericho lost the title. At Payback on April 30, Jericho defeated Owens to regain the title and moved to the SmackDown brand, but lost it back to him two nights later on &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;. Following the match, Owens attacked Jericho, who was carried out on a stretcher. Thus, Jericho was written off television so he could fulfill his commitments to tour with and promote his new album with Fozzy. Jericho made a surprise return at a house show in Singapore on June 28, where he lost to Hideo Itami.

==== Final matches and departure (2017–2018) ====
On the July 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, Jericho participated in a triple threat match against Owens and Styles for the title in which Jericho was pinned by Styles. On January 22, 2018, during the 25th Anniversary of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho appeared backstage in a segment with Elias, putting him on The List of Jericho. At the Greatest Royal Rumble, Jericho was the final entrant in the 50-man Royal Rumble match, eliminating Shelton Benjamin before being eliminated by the eventual winner Braun Strowman. This event marked Jericho&#x27;s final in-ring appearance with WWE to date. In September 2019, during an interview for the Mature Audiences Mayhem Podcast, Jericho explained that an incident occurred that made him finalize a decision to leave WWE. Even though Jericho was with the WWE for 15 years, at WrestleMania 33 in 2017, the match between Jericho and Kevin Owens (an established feud) was marked as second place on the WrestleMania match card for the United States Championship. The decision, made by Vince McMahon, prompted Jericho to seek work elsewhere.

==== Cameo (2022) ====
On the June 27, 2022 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jericho made an appearance via video message to congratulate John Cena on his career.

=== Return to NJPW (2017–2020) ===
On November 5, 2017, Jericho returned to NJPW in a pre-taped vignette, challenging Kenny Omega to a match at Wrestle Kingdom 12 in Tokyo Dome for Omega&#x27;s IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship. The match, dubbed &quot;Alpha vs. Omega&quot;, was Jericho&#x27;s first match outside of WWE since he left WCW in July 1999. Journalist Dave Meltzer wrote that Jericho&#x27;s WWE contract had expired and that he was a &quot;free agent&quot;. NJPW also referred to Jericho as a free agent. In contrast, the &quot;Tokyo Sports&quot; newspaper described an anonymous NJPW official saying that Jericho is still under contract with WWE, and that WWE chairman Vince McMahon had given him permission to wrestle this match in NJPW. At the event, Jericho was defeated by Omega. It was later revealed that the match was awarded a five-star rating from Dave Meltzer of the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;. This was the first of his career.
Jericho&#x27;s next feud was against Tetsuya Naito, defeating him at Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall to win the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. After retaining the title against Evil at Power Struggle, he lost it against Naito at Wrestle Kingdom 13.

==== The Inner Circle (2019–2021) ====
On January 8, 2019, Jericho made a surprise appearance at a media event organized by the upstart All Elite Wrestling (AEW) promotion. Shortly afterwards, Jericho was filmed signing a full-time performers three-year contract with AEW. Jericho defeated Kenny Omega at the promotion&#x27;s inaugural event Double or Nothing on May 25, and went on to defeat Adam Page at All Out on August 31 to become the inaugural AEW World Champion.

Jericho next began a rivalry with Orange Cassidy, with Jericho defeating him on the Fyter Fest episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot; on July 8, but losing a rematch on the August 12 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;. The two faced once again at All Out on September 5, in a Mimosa Mayhem match, which Jericho lost.

Beginning in October, Jericho began a feud with MJF, who requested to join the Inner Circle, despite disapproval from Sammy Guevara, Santana and Ortiz. Jericho and MJF wrestled in a match at the Full Gear event on November 7, which MJF won, thus allowing him to join the Inner Circle. On the Beach Break episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot; on February 3, 2021, Jericho and MJF won a tag team battle royal to become the number one contenders for the AEW World Tag Team Championship at the Revolution event on March 7 against The Young Bucks, which they were unsuccessful in winning.

On the March 10 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, MJF betrayed and left The Inner Circle after revealing he had been secretly plotting against them and building his own stable, The Pinnacle—consisting of Wardlow, Shawn Spears and FTR (Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood) turning the Inner Circle face. On the Blood and Guts episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot; on May 5, The Inner Circle lost to The Pinnacle in the inaugural Blood and Guts match. However, in the main event of Double or Nothing on May 30, The Inner Circle defeated The Pinnacle in a Stadium Stampede match, after Sammy Guevara pinned Shawn Spears. Jericho then began pursuing another match with MJF, who stated that he would first have to defeat a gauntlet of opponents selected by MJF, in a series dubbed the &quot;Labors of Jericho&quot;. Jericho would defeat each of MJF&#x27;s handpicked opponents (Shawn Spears, Nick Gage, Juventud Guerrera and Wardlow) and faced MJF in the final labor on the August 18 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, but he was defeated. Jericho demanded one more match, stipulating that if he lost, he would retire from in-ring competition, which MJF accepted. At All Out on September 5, Jericho defeated MJF to maintain his career and end their feud.

Following All Out, The Inner Circle started a rivalry with Men of the Year (Ethan Page and Scorpio Sky), and their ally, mixed martial arts (MMA) coach Dan Lambert.

At Final Battle on December 10, Jericho lost the ROH World Championship back to Castagnoli, ending his reign at 80 days.
Going into 2023, Jericho began feud with Ricky Starks. The feud cultimated at Revolution, where Jericho was defeated by Starks.

On the August 9, 2023 episode of &quot;Dynamite,&quot; all members except Sammy Guevera, of the Jericho Appreciation Society walked out on Jericho due to his association with Don Callis, effectively disbanding the stable.

==== Feud with The Don Callis Family (2023–2024) ====
Jericho was able to maintain his alliance with Guevara, reforming their tag team known as &quot;Le Sex Gods&quot;. At All In, Jericho was defeated by Will Ospreay. After the match, Jericho shoved Guevara away. On the &quot;Dynamite&quot; edition of Grand Slam, Jericho defeated Guevara, but when Jericho tried to show respect, Guevara hit him with a low blow and joined The Don Callis Family, turning Jericho face in the process. On the &quot;Rampage&quot; edition of Grand Slam, Jericho tried to attack The Don Callis Family, only to be outnumbered and saved by Kenny Omega. Jericho and Omega then formed a tag team known as &quot;The Golden Jets&quot; to take out The Don Callis Family. At WrestleDream, The Golden Jets with Kota Ibushi were defeated by The Don Callis Family (Ospreay, Guevera, and Konosuke Takeshita). At Full Gear, The Golden Jets defeated The Young Bucks to earn a shot at the AEW World Tag Team Championships. In December 2023, Omega was diagnosed with diverticulitis and would be forced to take time off, effectively ending The Golden Jets. On the December 27 edition of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Jericho came to Guevara&#x27;s aid from a Don Callis Family attack and reunited Le Sex Gods. At Worlds End, Le Sex Gods teamed with Sting and Darby Allin to defeat The Don Callis Family (Takeshita and Powerhouse Hobbs), Ricky Starks, and Big Bill.

On January 13, 2024, at &quot;Battle of the Belts IX&quot;, Le Sex Gods unsuccessfully challenged Starks and Bill for the AEW World Tag Team Championships due to interference from Hobbs and Takeshita. On the February 7 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Jericho was defeated by Takeshita, ending a near six-month feud with The Don Callis Family. In February 2024, Jericho revived his &quot;Lionheart&quot; persona.

==== The Learning Tree (2024–present) ====
Starting in March 2024, Jericho attempted to form a mentor-student relationship with Hook, however, Jericho was rebuffed, ultimately leading to a match between the two at Dynasty which saw Jericho win the FTW Championship. On the April 24 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Jericho turned heel by renaming the FTW Championship to the &quot;For The World Championship&quot;, dubbed himself &quot;The Learning Tree&quot;, where he would arrogantly offer advice and guidance to wrestlers, and sarcastically saying he needs his &quot;TV time&quot;, which was a reference to the online criticism of Jericho being constantly featured on AEW programming. On the May 1 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Jericho successfully defended the FTW Championship against Katsuyori Shibata, with the assistance of Big Bill, whom Jericho then agreed to add to his learning tree. On May 26 at Double or Nothing, Jericho successfully defended the title against Hook and Katsuyori Shibata with the help of Bryan Keith. On June 30 at Forbidden Door Jericho teamed with Jeff Cobb and Big Bill to take on Samoa Joe, Katsuyori Shibata and Hook but was unsuccessful. On August 25, Jericho faced Hook at All in but lost the title, ending his reign at 127 days. On the October 23, 2024 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Jericho defeated Mark Briscoe in a Ladder War (with Big Bill giving him a boost on his shoulders) to win the ROH World Championship for the second time, marking his ninth overall world title, and with that he gave himself the nickname of &quot;The Nueve&quot; (nine in Spanish). On November 27 at Thanksgiving Eve Dynamite, Jericho successfully defended his title against Tomohiro Ishii. On December 20 at Final Battle, Jericho successfully defended his title against Matt Cardona. After the match, Jericho attempted to attack Cardona but was chased off by a returning Bandido.

== Legacy ==
Known for his over-the-top, rock star persona, Jericho has been described by multiple industry commentators as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time. Journalist Chris Van Vliet noted that his name is &quot;always thrown around as the GOAT [greatest of all time], or at least one of the GOATs&quot;, with Van Vliet himself asserting that Jericho is &quot;if not &quot;the&quot; best, certainly one of the best&quot;. Todd Martin of the &quot;Pro Wrestling Torch&quot; remarked, to agreement from editor Wade Keller, that Jericho is &quot;one of the great wrestlers of all time&quot; and in &quot;a lofty category&quot;, while likening his oeuvre to those of WWE Hall of Famers Randy Savage, Ricky Steamboat, Ted DiBiase and Dory Funk Jr. Praised for his ability to continually evolve his gimmick, Jericho was dubbed by KC Joyner of ESPN as &quot;wrestling&#x27;s David Bowie&quot;.

Various outlets have included Jericho in lists of the greatest wrestlers ever. &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reporter Kevin Eck, who has also served as editor of &quot;WCW Magazine&quot; and a WWE producer, featured Jericho in his &quot;Top 10 favorite wrestlers of all time&quot; and &quot;Top 10 all-around performers&quot;—the former piece noting that Jericho is &quot;regarded as one of the very best talkers in the business&quot;. Keisha Hatchett in &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote that Jericho &quot;owns the mic with cerebral insults&quot; and is set apart from peers by &quot;his charismatic presence, which is highlighted by a laundry list of unforgettable catchphrases&quot;. He was voted by &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; (&quot;WON&quot;) readers as &quot;Best on Interviews&quot; for the 2000s decade, coinciding with his 2010 induction into the &quot;WON&quot; Hall of Fame. Fans also named Jericho the greatest WWE Intercontinental Champion of all time in a 2013 WWE poll, affording him a landslide 63% victory over the other four contenders (Mr. Perfect, The Honky Tonk Man, Rick Rude and Pat Patterson).

Chris Jericho&#x27;s feud with Shawn Michaels and their series of matches, particularly their ladder match at No Mercy in 2008 received critical acclaim. Wrestling Observer Newsletter named their feud the &quot;feud of the year&quot; and the ladder match the &quot;match of the year&quot;.

A number of Jericho&#x27;s industry colleagues have hailed him as one of the greatest wrestlers in history. Kurt Angle labelled him the single greatest performer of all time. Stone Cold Steve Austin lauded his consistently &quot;dynamic&quot; promos and in-ring work, while arguing that he should be considered among the 10 best ever. Kenny Omega asserted that Jericho &quot;has a legit argument for being the best of all time&quot;, based on his ability to achieve success and notoriety across numerous territories. Jon Moxley said, &quot;Jericho is really making a case for being the greatest of all time... he&#x27;s doing it again, he&#x27;s doing something completely new, and breaking new barriers still here in 2020.&quot; Matt Striker pointed to Jericho&#x27;s &quot;magnanimous&quot; nature as a contributing factor to his status as an all-time great; his willingness to impart knowledge was commended by James Ellsworth, who described Jericho as an &quot;outstanding human being&quot; and a childhood favorite. Kevin Owens stated that &quot;Jericho was always someone I looked up to&quot;, while The Miz affirmed that he was part of a generation of young wrestlers who sought to &quot;emulate&quot; Jericho.

WWE declared Jericho a &quot;marquee draw&quot; with a &quot;reputation as one of the best ever&quot;. As of 2019, he is one of the ten most prolific pay-per-view performers in company history.

After Jericho signed with All Elite Wrestling, it was said his role was similar to Terry Funk in ECW, as an experienced veteran bringing credibility to a younger promotion. Jericho was credited as one of the key attractions of AEW&#x27;s weekly television broadcasts, leading to him adopting the nickname &quot;The Demo God&quot; due to many of the segments he appeared in being some of the highest viewed in the key demographics. He was voted as the Best Box Office Draw by readers of the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; in 2019.

On March 15, 2023, prior to an &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot; broadcast from Winnipeg, Jericho was bestowed with a Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal by Premier of Manitoba Heather Stefanson, and it was announced that a portion of Winnipeg&#x27;s Wordsworth Way where he lived would be renamed &quot;Chris Jericho Way&quot;.

== Music career ==

Jericho is the lead singer for the heavy metal band Fozzy. Since their debut album in 2000, Fozzy have released seven studio albums; &quot;Fozzy&quot;, &quot;Happenstance&quot;, &quot;All That Remains&quot;, &quot;Chasing the Grail&quot;, &quot;Sin and Bones&quot;, &quot;Do You Wanna Start a War&quot;, &quot;Judas&quot;, and one live album, &quot;Remains Alive&quot;.

In 2005, Jericho performed vocals on a cover of &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; on the Iron Maiden tribute album, &quot;Numbers from the Beast.&quot; He made a guest appearance on Dream Theater&#x27;s album, &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot; on the song &quot;Repentance&quot;, as one of several musical guests recorded apologizing to important people in their lives for wrongdoings in the past.

In the mid-1990s, Jericho wrote a monthly column for &quot;Metal Edge&quot; magazine focused on the heavy metal scene. The column ran for about a year. He started his own weekly XM Satellite Radio show in March 2005 called &quot;The Rock of Jericho&quot;, which aired Sunday nights on XM 41 The Boneyard.

== Personal life ==

Irvine married Jessica Lockhart on July 30, 2000. They reside in Odessa, Florida, with their three children: son Ash Edward Irvine (born 2003) and identical twin daughters Sierra Loretta &quot;SiSi&quot; Irvine and Cheyenne Lee &quot;Chey&quot; Irvine (born 2006). All three have been guests on his podcast, &quot;Talk Is Jericho&quot;, with his son discussing fish and his daughters discussing literature. Irvine owns three cats. In October 2020, Irvine reportedly donated $3,000 to Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential re-election campaign.

Irvine is a Christian. He has a tattoo of his wife&#x27;s name on his ring finger. He has the letter F, representing Fozzy, on the back of his hand. Since 2012, he has gradually gotten a sleeve over his left arm. His tattoos include: the artwork of Fozzy&#x27;s album &quot;Sin and Bones&quot;, a Jack-o&#x27;-lantern (Avenged Sevenfold vocalist M. Shadows, who collaborated with Fozzy on the track &quot;Sandpaper&quot; from &quot;Sin and Bones&quot;, also got a matching tattoo), a lake monster, and himself from his WWF debut in 1999.

On January 27, 2010, Irvine and fellow wrestler Gregory Helms were arrested in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky after leaving a bar. A police report stated that Helms punched Irvine and the other passengers in the cab. Fellow wrestlers Christian and CM Punk later bailed them out.

Since January 2012, Irvine (along with former NFL Quarterback Tim Tebow, former NFL player Derrick Brooks, and former Atlanta Braves player Chipper Jones) has been the co-owner of a sports training facility in Tampa, a franchise site of D1 Sports Training and Therapy.

Irvine is a fan of Japanese convenience store chain Lawson, which Irvine would frequently shop at when he wrestled in Japan in the 1990s. Irvine still visits Lawson whenever he returns to Japan, whether to wrestle or if he is touring with Fozzy.

=== Charity work ===
Jericho has made philanthropic and charitable efforts. Alongside WWE superstars Kevin Owens and Tyler Breeze, he donated $2,500 to help victims of the Alberta forest fires.

<doc id="424779" wikidata="Q8034707" url="?curid=424779" title="Workers' Democracy (Poland)">
<text>Workers&#x27; Democracy () is a small Trotskyist group in Poland. Originally named &quot;Socialist Solidarity,&quot; it is affiliated with the International Socialist Tendency.

== Programme and ideology ==
Worker&#x27;s Democracy advocates for the abolishment of capitalism through an anticapitalist, socialist revolution and replacing the former system with workers&#x27; democracy. Their programme advocates for a system based on worker&#x27;s committees and worker&#x27;s councils established in the workplaces. WD&#x27;s supporters are against racism, fascism and antisemitism. The Movement is also progressive, adhering to feminism, and fighting against LGBT+ discrimination.

Worker&#x27;s Democracy claims that in Poland, Czechoslovakia and the USSR (from circa 1928 onwards) and other people&#x27;s democratic states established state capitalism, rather than socialism. The movement argues that the workers had no control over the economy and the state, and the power was held by a vanguard party, separate from the worker&#x27;s interests.

The movement also argues, in opposition to other trotskyist movements, that the Cuban and Chinese revolutions were not worker&#x27;s revolts, but a &quot;permanent revolution that has diverged from its course&quot;. Worker&#x27;s Democracy argues that these revolts are leading to state capitalism, rather than socialism, due to the revolutions being led by the middle-class, rather than the working class.

In the movement&#x27;s opinion, the lack of crisis of capitalism since World War II, comes from a &quot;permanent militarist economy&quot;, that has managed, up to the 1970&#x27;s, to avoid reaching the said crisis.

== Activity ==
Worker&#x27;s Democracy is organizing various debates, cultural events and film projections. Every year, the organization co-organizes an &quot;Anticapitalism Weekend&quot;, which has been attended by various guests, including Tadeusz Kowalik, Albert Garcia, Roman Kurkiewicz and Piotr Ikonowicz. The movement also is a part of a &quot;11th of November Coalition&quot;, that serves a purpose of blocking the Independence March, that happens annually in Warsaw.

The movement is one of the main founders of the anti-war movement in modern-day Poland. Worker&#x27;s Democracy has participated in protests against american interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, and is supportive of the Palestinian efforts against Israel, along with &quot;all other real national liberation movements&quot;.

== Electoral activity ==
Worker&#x27;s Democracy has not ran in any elections as a movement, however it has supported numerous left-wing candidates in many elections:

* The movement initially supported Maria Szyszkowska in 2005 presidential elections, however she could not gather a minimal amount of signatures in order to run for the office.
* Worker&#x27;s Democracy has supported, during 2005 Polish parliamentary elections, the movement has supported the list of the Polish Labour Party - August 80, and their preferred presidential candidate was Daniel Podrzycki. 
* Tragic death of Podrzycki led the WD to boycott both rounds of the presidential elections, however, two years later, the movement has again supported the Polish Labour Party. In 2010, it has supported Bogusław Ziętek
* In 2011 parliamentary elections, it refused to support any parliamentary list. Their support for the Labour Party came due to many candidates on the list coming from the nationalist background.
* During the 2014 European Parliamentary Elections, the WD supported the Green Party.
* In 2015 parliamentary elections, the movement announced its support for the Together Party.

<doc id="424780" wikidata="Q1576931" url="?curid=424780" title="List of French departments by population">
<text>This table lists the 101 French departments in descending order of population, area and population density.

==Data description==
The figures include:
* population without double counting for 1999;
* &quot;municipal population&quot; (legal population in 2008, with effect from 1 January 2011) published in decree No. 2010-1723 of 30 December 2010 as amended by Decree No. 2011-343 of 28 March 2011 which corresponds to data compiled as at 1 January 2008.
* &quot;municipal population&quot; (legal population in 2019 with effect from 1 January 2022)

The total population takes into account double counting.

==Evolution==
Between 1999 and 2006 all French departments had grown in population with the exception of the following seven departments: Allier and Cantal in Auvergne, Creuse in Limousin, Ardennes and Haute-Marne in Champagne-Ardenne, Nièvre in Burgundy, and Vosges in Lorraine. See population decline for more information.

In contrast the seven departments that have gained the most population in absolute value are Haute-Garonne, Gironde, Bouches-du-Rhône, Seine-Saint-Denis, Loire-Atlantique, Hauts-de Seine, and Hérault.

Guadeloupe has seemingly lost population between 1999 and 2008. However, this diminution of the legal population is due to the creation of the overseas communities of Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin. In the 1999 census, the population of Guadeloupe without the arrondissement of Saint-Martin-Saint-Barthélemy was 386,566 inhabitants. The department&#x27;s population has actually increased by more than 15,000 people over the period based on a constant territory.

<doc id="424785" wikidata="Q612448" url="?curid=424785" title="Chambers Dictionary">
<text>The Chambers Dictionary was first published by William and Robert Chambers as Chambers&#x27;s English Dictionary in 1872. It was an expanded version of &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Etymological Dictionary&quot; of 1867, compiled by James Donald. A second edition came out in 1898, and was followed in 1901 by a new compact edition called Chambers&#x27;s Twentieth Century Dictionary. 

The dictionary is widely used by British crossword solvers and setters, and by &quot;Scrabble&quot; players (though it is no longer the official &quot;Scrabble&quot; dictionary). It contains many more dialectal, archaic, unconventional and eccentric words than its rivals, and is noted for its occasional wryly humorous definitions. Examples of such definitions include those for &quot;éclair&quot; (&quot;a cake, long in shape but short in duration&quot;) and &quot;middle-aged&quot; (&quot;between youth and old age, variously reckoned to suit the reckoner&quot;). These jocular definitions were removed by the publisher in the 1970s, but many of them were reinstated in 1983 because of the affection in which they were held by readers.

The twelfth edition of &quot;The Chambers Dictionary&quot; was published in August 2011 by Chambers Harrap Publishers Ltd and runs to 1936 pages with 62,500 main entries. This edition is available for mobile use as an iPhone, iPad, or Android app. That has been followed by the thirteenth edition published in 2014. Also on sale is the smaller &quot;21st Century Dictionary&quot; of 1664 pages, where &quot;the focus is on the English that people use today, and definitions are given in straightforward, accessible language&quot;. This dictionary can be accessed for free online.

==&quot;Scrabble&quot;==

In an agreement with Mattel&#x27;s predecessor, J. W. Spear &amp; Sons, the &quot;Chambers Dictionary&quot; was, for several decades, the official source of words for the book &quot;Official Scrabble Words&quot; (OSW), a lexicon of all words and inflections playable in tournament &quot;Scrabble&quot; within the UK and other countries such as New Zealand and Australia. In 2005, Mattel changed the source dictionary to &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot;.

<doc id="424787" wikidata="Q7087783" url="?curid=424787" title="Oliver R. Smoot">
<text>Oliver Reed Smoot, Jr. (born August 24, 1940) is an MIT alumnus who was chairman of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) from 2001 to 2002 and president of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) from 2003 to 2004.

In 2011, &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; admitted his decapitalized surname, smoot, meaning a distance of , as one of the 10,000 new words added to their fifth edition. The term is named for Smoot from his undergraduate days when he was used as a unit of measurement on the Harvard Bridge at MIT during a fraternity pledge activity. The bridge measures 364.4 smoots.

==Early life and education==
Smoot was born August 24, 1940, in Bexar County, Texas. He attended MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity and obtained a Bachelor of Science in 1962. He then attended Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., where he obtained his JD. 

==Career==
From 2000–2005, he served as vice president for external voluntary standards relations of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI). Prior to that, he was ITI&#x27;s executive vice president for 23 years. 

Smoot gave a speech to a hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology&#x27;s Subcommittee on Technology on March 20, 2000, titled &quot;The Role of Technical Standards in Today&#x27;s Society and in the Future&quot;.

He returned to MIT on October 4, 2008, for a 50th anniversary celebration, including the installation of a plaque on the bridge. Smoot was also presented with an official unit of measurement: a smoot stick. On May 7, 2016, he served as the grand marshal of the parade marking the centenary of MIT&#x27;s moving from Boston&#x27;s Back Bay into Cambridge.

==Personal life==
Smoot lives in San Diego with his spouse Sandra Smoot. He is also a representative of the MIT Education Council. He has a son and daughter, both of whom also attended MIT. 

Smoot is a distant relative of Senator Reed Smoot and of Nobel Prize in Physics winner George Smoot.

<text>The Party for a Rule of Law Offensive, Rule of Law State Offensive Party, Party for the Promotion of the Rule of Law, Law and Order Offensive Party, or Party of Law and Order Offensive (), commonly known as the &quot;Schill party&quot; from 2000 to 2003, was a minor right-wing populist party in Germany, mainly active in the state of Hamburg, that ran on a platform of law and order. It was founded in July 2000 by the judge Ronald Schill and was temporarily very successful in Hamburg, winning 19.4% of the votes in the 2001 state election and joining a coalition government. After the centre-right coalition collapsed and Schill left the party in 2003, it quickly lost support. Attempts to expand to other states or the federal level were unsuccessful. It may therefore be considered a &quot;flash party&quot; or protest party.

== Name ==
Initially it used the acronym PRO but had to drop it after a judicial complaint by the Pro Deutsche Mitte (Pro DM) party, as it was considered too similar to the latter&#x27;s short name. Because of this, the official short name was &quot;Schill&quot;, derived from the informal, but commonly used epithet &quot;Schill-Partei&quot; (&quot;Schill party&quot;) from 2001 to 2004. After Schill&#x27;s resignation, the party had to choose yet another short name, now running as Offensive D, the &quot;D&quot; standing for &quot;Deutschland&quot; (&quot;Germany&quot;).

== History ==

=== Inception ===
Before his political career, Ronald Schill had been a criminal judge at the Hamburg district court. He was known in the local tabloid press for passing unusually severe sentences and advocating harsher penalties, especially for adolescent delinquents, winning the nickname of &quot;Judge Merciless&quot;. Schill supporters launched a political initiative in late 1999 and registered the Party for a Rule of Law Offensive in July 2000. The party platform and public appearance was strongly focused on the personality of its founder.

=== Schill era (2000–03) ===
In the 2001 Hamburg state parliament elections it instantly came third and received 19.4% of votes (only 7 points behind the major conservative CDU) and 25 of the 121 seats in the assembly. During the campaign, it had accused the state government of insufficient action against criminality, drugs, violence, demanding more police and tougher sanctions. It benefitted from a general feeling of insecurity that had spread after the September 11 attacks in the United States, especially given that three of the terrorists had lived and studied in Hamburg. After the election, the new party joined a centre-right coalition with the CDU and the liberal FDP. The Schill party had 3 out of 11 senators (equivalent to ministers), with Ronald Schill being deputy mayor and senator of the interior.

The party could not extend its success to other states: In the state elections of Sachsen-Anhalt 2002 and Bremen 2003, it won 4.4% and 4.5% of the votes respectively, but failed to surmount the 5% threshold for parliamentary representation. In other states it only polled around 1%. In the 2002 federal election, the Schill party won only 0.8% of the votes. In Spring 2003, Mario Mettbach was elected federal chairman of the party, while Schill continued to lead the Hamburg state branch. After a dispute about Schill&#x27;s state secretary, Hamburg&#x27;s first mayor Ole von Beust (CDU) removed Schill from his government office, accusing him of blackmail. Purportedly, Schill had threatened to accuse von Beust of granting undue advantages to the senator of justice, with whom Schill suspected von Beust of having a love affair.

In December 2003, the federal board of the party removed Schill from his position as chairman of the state party. Schill considered this illegal and ignored the decision, therefore the federal board decided to expel Schill from the party. Consequently, the party&#x27;s parliamentary group split, the supporters of Schill leaving the party&#x27;s group and founding a separate one. Von Beust canceled the coalition and called a snap election.

=== After Schill (2004–07) ===
In the 2004 Hamburg elections, the party under the new leader Mario Mettbach only reached 0.4% and lost all of its seats, while Schill ran on a joint ticket with the Pro DM party, winning 3.1% of the votes, but also failing to qualify for parliamentary representation. After the election, Mettbach and most of the other members left the party, some of them joining the CDU. The members who hadn&#x27;t left elected a new leader and changed their short name to &quot;Offensive D&quot;. Under that name, they came in last at the 2005 German federal election, polling 3,338 out of over 47 million votes (less than 0.01%).

The party dissolved due to poor election results and financial problems in September 2007, having lost several leading figures and entire state groups to other right-wing parties such as the Centre Party.

<text>Cultural history records and interprets past events involving human beings through the social, cultural, and political milieu of or relating to the arts and manners that a group favors. Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) helped found cultural history as a discipline. Cultural history studies and interprets the record of human societies by denoting the various distinctive ways of living built up by a group of people under consideration. Cultural history involves the aggregate of past cultural activity, such as ceremony, class in practices, and the interaction with locales. It combines the approaches of anthropology and history to examine popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. 

==Description==
Many current cultural historians claim it to be a new approach, but cultural history was already referred to by nineteenth-century historians, notably the Swiss scholar of Renaissance history Jacob Burckhardt.
Cultural history overlaps in its approaches with the French movements of &quot;histoire des mentalités&quot; (Philippe Poirrier, 2004) and the so-called new history, and in the U.S. it is closely associated with the field of American studies. As originally conceived and practiced in the 19th century by Burckhardt, in relation to the Italian Renaissance, cultural history was oriented to the study of a particular historical period in its entirety, with regard not only to its painting, sculpture, and architecture, but to the economic basis underpinning society, and to the social institutions of its daily life. Echoes of Burkhardt&#x27;s approach in the 20th century can be seen in Johan Huizinga&#x27;s &quot;The Waning of the Middle Ages&quot; (1919).

Most often the focus is on phenomena shared by non-elite groups in a society, such as: carnival, festival, and public rituals; performance traditions of tale, epic, and other verbal forms; cultural evolutions in human relations (ideas, sciences, arts, techniques); and cultural expressions of social movements such as nationalism. Cultural history also examines main historical concepts as power, ideology, class, culture, cultural identity, attitude, race, perception and new historical methods as narration of body. Many studies consider adaptations of traditional culture to mass media (television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, etc.), from print to film and, now, to the Internet (culture of capitalism). Its modern approaches come from art history, Annales, Marxist school, microhistory and new cultural history.

Common theoretical touchstones for recent cultural history have included: Jürgen Habermas&#x27;s formulation of the public sphere in &quot;The Structural Transformation of the Bourgeois Public Sphere&quot;; Clifford Geertz&#x27;s notion of &#x27;thick description&#x27; (expounded in &quot;The Interpretation of Cultures&quot;); and the idea of memory as a cultural-historical category, as discussed in Paul Connerton&#x27;s &quot;How Societies Remember&quot;.

===Historiography and the French Revolution===
The area where new-style cultural history is often pointed to as being almost a paradigm is the &quot;revisionist&quot; history of the French Revolution, dated somewhere since François Furet&#x27;s massively influential 1978 essay &quot;Interpreting the French Revolution&quot;. The &quot;revisionist interpretation&quot; is often characterized as replacing the allegedly dominant, allegedly Marxist, &quot;social interpretation&quot; which locates the causes of the Revolution in class dynamics. The revisionist approach has tended to put more emphasis on &quot;political culture&quot;. Reading ideas of political culture through Habermas&#x27; conception of the public sphere, historians of the Revolution in the past few decades have looked at the role and position of cultural themes such as gender, ritual, and ideology in the context of pre-revolutionary French political culture.

Historians who might be grouped under this umbrella are Roger Chartier, Robert Darnton, Patrice Higonnet, Lynn Hunt, Keith Baker, Joan Landes, Mona Ozouf, and Sarah Maza. Of course, these scholars all pursue fairly diverse interests, and perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the paradigmatic nature of the new history of the French Revolution. Colin Jones, for example, is no stranger to cultural history, Habermas, or Marxism, and has persistently argued that the Marxist interpretation is not dead, but can be revivified; after all, Habermas&#x27; logic was heavily indebted to a Marxist understanding. Meanwhile, Rebecca Spang has also recently argued that for all its emphasis on difference and newness, the &#x27;revisionist&#x27; approach retains the idea of the French Revolution as a watershed in the history of (so-called) modernity and that the problematic notion of modernity has itself attracted scant attention.

==Cultural studies==
&quot;Cultural studies&quot; is an academic discipline popular among a diverse group of scholars. It combines political economy, geography, sociology, social theory, literary theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, and art history/criticism to study cultural phenomena in various societies. Cultural studies researchers often concentrate on how a particular phenomenon relates to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender. The term was coined by Richard Hoggart in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies. It has since become strongly associated with Stuart Hall, who succeeded Hoggart as Director.

== Cultural history in popular culture ==

The BBC has produced and broadcast a number of educational television programmes on different aspects of human cultural history: in 1969 &quot;Civilisation&quot;, in 1973 &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot;, in 1985 &quot;The Triumph of the West&quot; and in 2012 &quot;Andrew Marr&#x27;s History of the World&quot;.

<text>Braga (; ) is a city and a municipality, capital of the northwestern Portuguese district of Braga and of the historical and cultural Minho Province. Braga Municipality had a resident population of 201,583 inhabitants (in 2023), representing the seventh largest municipality in Portugal by population. Its area is 183.40 km2. Its agglomerated urban area extends to the Cávado River and is the third most populated urban area in Portugal, behind Lisbon and Porto Metropolitan Areas.

It is host to the oldest Portuguese archdiocese, the Archdiocese of Braga of the Catholic Church and it is the seat of the Primacy of the Spains. During the Roman Empire, then known as Bracara Augusta, the settlement was the capital of the Roman province of Gallaecia and later would become the capital of the Kingdom of the Suebi that was one of the first territories to separate from the Roman Empire in the 5th century. Inside of the city there is also a castle tower that can be visited. Nowadays, Braga is among the most noted entrepreneurial and technological centers of the country, as well as a major hub for inland Northern Portugal, and it is an important stop on the Portuguese Way path of the Road of St James. The city hosted two games of the UEFA Euro 2004 and was the European Youth Capital in 2012.

== History ==


=== Pre-Roman ===

Human occupation of the region of Braga dates back thousands of years, documented by vestiges of monumental structures starting in the Megalithic era. During the Iron Age, the Castro culture extended into the northwest, characterized by Bracari peoples who occupied the high ground in strategically located fortified settlements (castrum).

The region became the domain of the &quot;Callaici Bracarii&quot;, a Celtic tribe who occupied what is now northern Portugal, Galicia and Asturias in the northwest of Iberia.

=== Roman rule ===
The Romans began their conquest of the region around 136 BC, and finished it, by conquering the northern regions, during the reign of Emperor Augustus. The civitas of Bracara Augusta was founded in 16 BC; in the context of the administrative reorganization of these Roman acquisitions, Bracara was rededicated to the Emperor taking on the name &quot;Bracara Augusta&quot;. The city of Bracara Augusta developed greatly during the 1st century and reached its maximum extension around the 2nd century.

Towards the end of the 3rd century, the Emperor Diocletian promoted the city to the status of capital of the administrative area Conventus bracarensis, the southwestern area of the newly founded Roman province of Gallaecia.

===Braga in Late Antiquity and Middle Ages===

The city was described as prosperous by the poet Ausonius, in the 4th century. Between 402 and 470 the Germanic Invasions of the Iberian Peninsula occurred, and the area was conquered by the Suebi, a Germanic people from Central Europe. According to records the city was protected by a wall, still in use since the 3rd century, and the old Roman amphitheatre was repurposed into a fortress. In 410, the Suebi established a Kingdom in northwest Iberia covering what is present-day&#x27;s Northern half of Portugal, Galicia and Asturias, which they maintained as &quot;Gallaecia&quot;, and had Bracara as their capital. This kingdom was founded by Hermeric and lasted for over 150 years. However, the departure of the Vandals and the arrival of the Visigoths brought a new instability to the region. Between 419 and 422, Braga was threatened by the Vandals so it prepared itself for a siege, closed its gates and refused to open them; this led to the destruction of the surrounding countryside. Nevertheless, between 429 and 455, the Suebi made a military comeback in Iberia reinforcing their hold in Galeicia and Lusitania. In 455, while the Visigothic king Theodoric II sacked Braga, utterly destroying many historical and archaeological records, the Suebi king Rechiar escaped the city, wounded, to Porto. However, records of a list of dioceses and parishes of Braga, made in 570 still exist. By about 584, the Visigoths took permanent control of Gallaecia from the Suebi, and Braga was made a provincial capital.

Because historians are still unsure of the dating of the Chapel of São Pedro de Balsemão, in Lamego, currently Braga hosts the oldest chapel in Portugal, the Chapel of São Frutuoso. The chapel was built by the Visigoths on top of a Roman temple to Asclepius and it was made to be a Royal Chapel. In 656 AD, it was consecrated by Saint Fructuosus to be used as his tomb.


Historical records show, so far, that the first known bishop of Braga was named &quot;Paternus&quot;, who famously renounced priscillianism at the First Council of Toledo, in September of 400 AD. We also have records of a bishop named &quot;Balconius&quot; (415-447), who was also recorded to be present when the Iberian clergy received, in 435, a German priest from Arabia accompanied by several Greeks with news from the Council of Ephesus (431). &quot;Balconius&quot; was also a contemporary and correspondent of Pope Leo I.

Tradition, however, states that Saint Peter of Rates was the first bishop of Braga, a Jew personally elevated to the role by Saint James. Another bishop, Saint Ovidius (d. 135 AD) is also sometimes considered one of the first bishops of this city.

Braga had an important role in the &quot;Christianization&quot; of the Iberian Peninsula. In the early 5th century, Paulus Orosius (a friend of Augustine of Hippo) wrote several theological works that expounded the Christian faith. While thanks to the work of Saint Martin of Braga the Suebi in Iberia renounced the Arian and Priscillianist heresies during two synods held here in the 6th century. It is also worth noting that Rechiar, the suebi king, was also the first Germanic king in Europe to convert to Chalcedonian Christianism, predating Clovis of the Franks. At the time, Martin also founded an important monastery in Dumio (&quot;Dume&quot;), and it was in Braga that the Archbishopric of Braga held their councils. There were also some attempts at further elevating the religious status of the city, such as Paulus Orosius and Avitus of Braga&#x27;s attempt at bringing relics of Saint Stephen, from the Holy Land to Braga. Originally, Avitus entrusted the delivery of the relics to Paulus Orosius. However, after arriving at Majorca, the theologian heard news of the invasion of the peninsula by the Vandals and halted his pilgrimage to return to North Africa. The relics never reached their destination and their fates are unknown.

As a consequence, the Archbishops of Braga later claimed the title of &quot;Primatus Totus Hispania&quot;, claiming supremacy over the entire Hispanic church. Yet, their authority was never accepted throughout Hispania, and today they only retain the title of Primate of Portugal. The bishop &quot;Balconius&quot;, who was later elevated to become the first Archbishop of Braga, and according to later sources, was also the first to be given said title.

The transition from Visigothic reigns to the Muslim conquest of Iberia was very obscure, representing a period of decline for the city. The Moors briefly captured Braga in 714–716, but were repelled by Christian forces under Alfonso I of Asturias in 741, (alongside Chaves, Porto and Lamego), with intermittent attacks until 868 when they were definitively ousted by Alfonso III of Asturias. The bishopric was restored in 1070 and elevated to new heights. The first new Archbishop, Peter of Braga (?-1096), immediately started rebuilding the Cathedral (which was modified many times during the following centuries). According to historical records and oral tradition, the Archbishop Diego Gelmírez of Santiago de Compostela, fearing the rise of the Cathedral of Braga, stole the relics of Braga&#x27;s saints in an attempt to diminish the religious importance of the city. The relics only returned to Braga in the 1990s.

When, after his death, Alfonso III the Great of the Kingdom of Asturias divided his kingdom among his sons in 908, he assigned the Kingdom of Galicia to Ordoño of Galicia, who established his capital in Braga. Between 1093 and 1147, Braga became the residential seat of the Portuguese court. In the early 12th century, Count Henry of Portugal and bishop Geraldo de Moissac reclaimed the archbishopric seat for Braga, with power over a large area in Iberia. The medieval city developed around the cathedral, with the maximum authority in the city retained by the archbishop.

===Braga in the Kingdom of Portugal===

Braga as the main center of Christianity in Iberia, during the Reconquista (until the emergence of Santiago de Compostela and, later, the conquest of Toledo from the Muslims, in 1085), held a prominent stage in medieval politics, being a major contributor to the Independence of Portugal with the intervention of the Archbishop D. Paio Mendes in the Vatican, with Pope Alexander III, which lead to the promulgation of the Bula Manifestis Probatum, in 1179, recognizing Portugal as an independent Kingdom under D. Afonso I Henriques. It is traditionally told that the future king was baptized by Saint Gerald of Braga, although the exact location is still being debated. Because of this support for D. Afonso Henriques, the new king gave large privileges to the city of Braga handing it over to direct control of the Church, basically making it a personal fiefdom of the Archbishop. This legal particularism continued all throughout history until the instauration of the Republic giving the city and its surrounding area the nickname of &quot;Paiz Bracarense&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;Country of Braga&quot;).

In the 16th century, due to its distance from the coast and provincial status, Braga did not profit from the adventures associated with the Age of Portuguese Discoveries (which favoured cities like Lisbon, Évora and Coimbra, new seats for the Portuguese court). Yet, Archbishop Diogo de Sousa, who sponsored several urban improvements in the city, including the enlargement of streets, the creation of public squares and the foundation of hospitals and new churches, managed to modernize the community. He expanded and remodelled the cathedral by adding a new chapel in the Manueline style, and generally turning the mediaeval town into a Renaissance city.

A similar period of rejuvenation occurred during the 18th century, when the archbishops of the House of Braganza contracted architects like André Soares and Carlos Amarante, to modernize and rejuvenate the city; they began a series of architectural transformations to churches and civic institutions in the Baroque style, including the municipal hall, public library, the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte and many urban palaces. D. Luís de Sousa was another main archbishop who, with other merits, ordered the Church of the Parish of Saint Victor to be rebuilt, ordered the Campo de S. Ana to be enlarged, to rebuild the Church of S. Vicente, to requalify the Chapel of S. Sebastian and the construction of the Igreja dos Congregados which would later be monumentalized into the current version of the Basilica of the Congregados. Likewise, under the auspices of this diplomatic archbishop, the canon of the Braga Chapter, João Meira Carrilho, ordered the construction of the Chapel of the Congregation of the Oratory that existed within the Campo de S. Ana (modern day &quot;Avenida Central&quot;). The old fortress built on top of the Roman amphitheatre still stood in the 18th century (a description of it was made during the reign of Queen D. Maria I), in the southern part of Maximinos.

In 1758, Braga, like many other places, was included in the census requested by the monarchy, under the 1st Marquis of Pombal. These records are known as the Parochial Memories (&quot;Memórias Paroquiais&quot;) which can be consulted through various sources.

In March 1809 it was the scene of the Battle of Braga, when French troops under Marshal Soult took the town from its Portuguese garrison. With the invasion of French troops, during the Peninsular Wars the city was relegated, once again, to a provincial status. But, by the second half of that century, with influence from Portuguese immigrants living in Brazil, new money and tastes resulted in improvements to architecture and infrastructures.

===Braga in the Republic===
The Castle of Braga, previously located in the city center, was destroyed in 1905 (to great popular fanfair), despite attempts to save it by several people such as archaeologist Albano Belino, who tried to change the location of his municipal museum to the building in an attempt to protect it. Belino, disgusted, suffered from a stroke, passing away the following year and ending up donating his estate to the &quot;Archaeological Museum of the Martins Sarmento de Guimarães Society&quot;. Albano Belino&#x27;s dream of creating a museum in Braga was only realized in 1918, with the founding of a museum directly precursor to the Dom Diogo de Sousa Regional Museum of Archaeology.

On May 28, 1926, General Gomes da Costa began his march from Braga to Lisbon starting the Revolution of May 28, where he abolished the First Republic and implementing the dictatorial government which would eventually become the Estado Novo. In the tenth anniversary of the Revolution, dictator António de Oliveira Salazar, visited the city prompting a large fair, a parade and a speech, which he gave on the balcony of the Town Hall. Afterwards, the dictator would return several times to the city in its anniversary, such as the 40º anniversary.

In the 20th century Braga faced similar periods of growth and decline; demographic and urban pressures, from urban-to-rural migration meant that the city&#x27;s infrastructures had to be improved in order to satisfy greater demands.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===

Situated in the heart of Minho, Braga is located in a transitional region between the east and west: between mountains, forests, grand valleys, plains and fields, constructing natural spaces, moulded by human intervention. Geographically, with an area of it is bordered in the north by the municipalities of Vila Verde and Amares, northeast and east by Póvoa de Lanhoso, south and southeast with Guimarães and Vila Nova de Famalicão and west by the municipality of Barcelos.

The topography in the municipality is characterized by irregular valleys, interspersed by mountainous spaces, fed by rivers running in parallel with the principal rivers. In the north it is limited by the Cávado River, in the south by terrain of the Serra dos Picos to a height of and towards the east by the Serra dos Carvalhos to a height of , opening to the municipalities of Vila Nova de Famalicão and Barcelos. The territory extends from the northeast to southwest, accompanying the valleys of the two rivers, fed by many of its tributaries, forming small platforms between and .

The municipality lies between and , with the urbanized centre located at approximately . In the north, where the municipality is marked by the Cavado, the terrain is semi-planar, the east is mountainous owing to the Serra do Carvalho , Serra dos Picos , Monte do Sameiro and Monte de Santa Marta . Between the Serra do Carvalho and Serra dos Picos is the River Este, forming the valley of Vale d’Este. Similarly, between the Serra dos Picos and Monte do Sameiro, there exists the plateau of Sobreposta-Pedralva. To the south and west, the terrain is a mix of mountains, plateaus and medium-size valleys, permitting the passage of the River Este, and giving birth to other confluences including the River Veiga, River Labriosca and various ravines.

===Climate===
Braga has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate similar to other cities in the northwest Iberian Peninsula except for having significantly hotter summer temperatures due to being some distance from the ocean: the absolute maximum is as much as higher than neighbouring A Coruña or Santiago de Compostela. The highest and lowest recorded temperatures are and respectively.
The climate is affected by the Atlantic Ocean which influences westerly winds that are channeled through the region&#x27;s valleys, transporting large humid air masses. Consequently, the climate tends to be pleasant with clearly defined seasons. The air masses have the effect of maintaining morning relative humidity around 80%: annual mean temperatures hover between and . Owing to nocturnal cooling, frost usually forms frequently between three and four months of the year (about 29 days of frost annually) and annually the region receives of precipitation, with the major intensity occurring between fall/winter and spring.

===Human geography===


The municipality is densely populated, with approximately 962 inhabitants per square kilometre, equivalent to 181,474 residents (2011); it is one of the more populous territories in Portugal, as well as one of the &quot;younger&quot; markets. The majority of the population concentrates in the urban area of Braga, itself, where densities are more than 10000 per square kilometre.

The Bracarense population consists of approximately 78954 male and 85238 female individuals, with 35% of the population less than 25 years of age, while seniors conform to 11% of the population; the working population of the municipality occupies 54% of this structure. Although largely native Portuguese, other segments of the population include Brazilians, Africans (principally from the former Portuguese colonies), Chinese and eastern European peoples, namely Ukrainians.

The urban structure includes approximately 70,268 residences (2001), even as the typical classic representation of family only includes 51,173 members in the municipality. The &quot;extra&quot; homes are primarily temporary residences, normally for students, migrant workers and professionals working in the city. There is, also, a great number of homes owned by Portuguese residents living overseas (who use the homes periodically while in Portugal) even as constant and development has attracted new growth in the population. Further, the difference in resident to transitory population means that, on average, the population of Braga hovers between 174,000 and 230,000 individuals annually.

Growth in the population, roughly 16.2% between 1991 and 2001, occurred mainly in the older suburban civil parishes, such as Nogueira (now abolished) (124.6%), Frossos (now abolished) (68.4%), Real (now abolished) (59.8%) and Lamaçães (now abolished) (50.9%).

There is no formal city government, only municipal government authority, with local administration handled by the individual &quot;juntas de freguesia&quot; or civil parish councils.

==Economy==
The major industries in the municipality are construction, metallurgy and mechanics, electrical and electronic equipment, software development and web design. The computer industry is significant. Braga hosts PRIMAVERA – Business Software Solutions SA (PRIMAVERA BSS) company headquarters, a Portuguese multinational software company best known for its leading enterprise project management software. The International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory (INL), a joint research center in nanotechnology established and funded by both the Portuguese and the Spanish governments, is also headquartered in Braga. The automotive industry has a long history in Braga. Aptiv operates a technical center for the development and production of automotive infotainment systems. This plant was previously owned by Grundig. Next to Aptiv, Robert Bosch GmbH operates a similar technical center, mainly for branches of infotainment and sensors. This plant was previously founded by Blaupunkt. Bosch has been working closely with the University of Minho in Portugal since 2012, producing one of the country&#x27;s largest university-corporate partnerships. In the process, many projects for the mobility of the future are being tackled. In 2018, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa were on site for the launch of a new technology campus. The university, headquartered in Braga, is also by itself a major driving force of the city&#x27;s economy.

==Transport==
The municipality has a small-sized airfield (Aerodromo de Braga) in Palmeira. The major international airport used by the people of Braga is the Sá Carneiro International Airport (also known as Porto Airport) located away, in Porto Metropolitan Area. Access to the international airport located near Porto is made by public transit from Braga city centre (roughly 40 minutes) or aerobus (50 minutes).

Braga is serviced by both regional and high-speed rail connection to major urban centres in the country and abroad.

It has an efficient bus network (TUB - Transportes Urbanos de Braga) with 76 lines in the urban area and over a 300 km network.

<text>The Pacific sleeper shark (Somniosus pacificus) is a sleeper shark of the family Somniosidae, measuring up to in length, although it could possibly reach lengths in excess of . It is found in the Pacific Ocean, usually in the northern hemisphere, but observations in recent years show it is also present in the southern hemisphere.

== Distribution ==
The Pacific sleeper shark is found in the North Pacific on continental shelves and slopes in Arctic and temperate waters between latitudes 70°N and 22°N and in at least two places in the western tropical Pacific near Palau and the Solomon Islands, from the surface to deep. The first evidence of the sharks in the western tropical Pacific emerged from a National Geographic video taken near the Solomon Islands in 2015. Video footage of it has also been recorded in the Tonga Trench in 2024.

==Feeding habits==

Pacific sleeper sharks, which are thought to be both predators and scavengers, can glide through the water with little body movement and little hydrodynamic noise, making them successful stealth predators. They feed by means of suction and cutting of their prey. They have large mouths that can essentially inhale prey and their teeth cut up any pieces that are too large to swallow. They show a characteristic rolling motion of the head when feeding. Only in Alaska has the shark&#x27;s diet been studied - most sharks&#x27; stomachs contain remains of giant Pacific octopus. They are also known to feed on bottom-dwelling teleost fishes, as well as soles, flounders, Alaska pollock, rockfishes, shrimps, hermit crabs, and even marine snails. Larger Pacific sleeper sharks are also found to feed on fast-swimming prey, such as squids, Pacific salmon, and harbor porpoises. The diet of the Pacific sleeper shark seems to broaden as they increase in size. For example, a 3.7-m female shark found off Trinidad, California, was found to have fed mostly on giant squid. Sleeper sharks found in Alaskan waters from seem to feed mostly on flounder, pollock, and cephalopods, while sleeper sharks long seem to consume teleosts and cephalopods, as well as marine mammals. A recent study in the Gulf of Alaska suggests that sleeper sharks may prey on juvenile Steller sea lions.

==Reproduction==
Very little is known about the early life of Pacific sleeper sharks. They are believed to produce eggs that hatch inside the female&#x27;s body (reproduction is ovoviviparous), but gestation time is unknown and litter sizes are thought to be about 10 pups. Its length at birth is about or less.

==Size==
The average mature size is and . The largest Pacific sleeper shark verified in size measured long and weighed , although it could possibly reach or more. In 1989, an enormous Pacific sleeper shark was attracted to a bait in deep water outside Tokyo Bay, Japan, and filmed. The shark was estimated by Eugenie Clark to be about long. A single unconfirmed account exists of an enormous Pacific sleeper shark that potentially measured more than long. If true, this would make the species the largest extant macro-predatory shark, and the third largest shark overall after the whale shark and the basking shark.

==Adaptations==
Due to living in frigid depths, the sleeper shark&#x27;s liver oil does not contain squalene, which would solidify into a dense, nonbuoyant mass. Instead, the low-density compounds in the sharks&#x27; liver are diacylglyceryl ethers and triacylglycerol, which maintain their fluidity even at the lowest temperatures. Also, they store very little urea in their skin (like many deep sea sharks), but like other elasmobranchs, have high concentrations of urea and trimethylamine oxide (nitrogenous waste products) in their tissues as osmoprotectants and to increase their buoyancy. Trimethylamine oxide also serves to counteract the protein-destabilizing tendencies of urea and pressure. Its presence in the tissues of both elasmobranch and teleost fish has been found to increase with depth.

Because food is relatively scarce on the deep sea floor, the sleeper shark is able to store food in its capacious stomach. The sleeper shark&#x27;s jaws are able to produce a powerful bite due to their short and transverse shape. The upper jaw teeth of the sleeper shark are spike-like, while the lower jaw teeth are oblique cusps and overlapping bases. This arrangement allows grasping and sawing of food too large to swallow. Pacific sleeper sharks have a short caudal fin, which allows them to store energy for fast and violent bursts of energy to catch prey.

In 2015 a pacific sleeper shark was filmed near the Solomon Islands underneath an active volcano.

== Known predators ==
Sleeper sharks are preyed on by the offshore ecotype of killer whale off British Columbia. In addition, like the Greenland shark, the parasitic copepod &quot;Ommatokoita elongata&quot; can often be observed consuming the shark&#x27;s corneal tissue.

<text>A Minister of State () in Ireland (also called a junior minister) is of non-cabinet rank attached to one or more Departments of State of the Government of Ireland and assists the Minister of the Government responsible for that Department.

==Appointment==
Unlike senior government ministers, which are appointed by the President of Ireland on the advice of the Taoiseach and the prior approval of Dáil Éireann, Ministers of State are appointed directly by the government, on the nomination of the Taoiseach. Members of either House of the Oireachtas (Dáil or Seanad) may be appointed to be a Minister of State at a Department of State; to date, the only Senator appointed as Minister of State has been Pippa Hackett, who was appointed in June 2020 to the 32nd government of Ireland. Ministers of State continue in office after the dissolution of the Dáil until the appointment of a new Taoiseach. If the Taoiseach resigns from office, a Minister of State is also deemed to have resigned from office.

Powers and duties of a Government Minister may be delegated to a Minister of State by a statutory instrument. If the Government Minister resigns, these powers must delegated again on the appointment of a new Government Minister. Some Ministers of State are department heads. In the 31st government, Leo Varadkar was the Minister for Defence as well as Taoiseach but the day-to-day running of the Department of Defence was administered by Paul Kehoe, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence.

==History==
The Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 allowed the Executive Council (from 1937, the government of Ireland) to appoint up to seven Parliamentary Secretaries to the Executive Council or to Executive Ministers, who held office during the duration of the government and while they were a member of the Oireachtas. This position was abolished by the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1977, which created the new position of Minister of State. This Act was commenced on 1 January 1978.

In the 1977 Act, the number of Ministers of State was limited to 10. In 1980 this was raised to 15, in 1995 it was raised to 17, and in 2007 it was raised to 20. On 21 April 2009, Brian Cowen asked all 20 Ministers of State to resign, and he re-appointed a reduced number of 15 ministers the following day, when the Dáil resumed after the Easter recess. In July 2020, the new government appointed 20 Ministers of State.

Máire Geoghegan-Quinn was the first woman to be appointed as a Parliamentary Secretary, when she was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce by Jack Lynch in 1977 (becoming Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy in 1978). In 1979, Geoghegan-Quinn would become the first women appointed to cabinet since 1921.

==Ministers of State attending cabinet==
The Government Chief Whip is a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and attends cabinet. The current Chief Whip is Mary Butler.

Since the Rainbow Coalition formed in 1994, several governments have appointed additional Ministers of State who regularly attend meetings of the government but without a vote. Ministers of State attending cabinet, other than the Government Chief Whip, are often described as super junior ministers or super juniors. Up to three Ministers of State attending cabinet may receive an allowance. Ministers of State attending cabinet in the 35th government of Ireland:
*Mary Butler – Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Government Chief Whip)
*Hildegarde Naughton – Minister of State at the Department of Children, Disability and Equality
*Seán Canney – Minister of State at the Department of Transport 
*Noel Grealish – Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and the Marine

<text>Santarém () is a Portuguese city and municipality located in the district of Santarém. The population of the historic Ribatejo capital in 2021 was 58,671, in an area of 552.54 km2. The population of the city proper was 29,929 in 2012.

The mayor is Ricardo Gonçalves (PSD). The municipal holiday is March 19, the day of Saint Joseph (&quot;São José&quot;). The city is on the Portuguese Way variant of the Way of Saint James.

== History ==
Since prehistory, the region of Santarém has been inhabited, first by the Lusitani people and then by the Greeks, Romans, Visigoths, Arabs and later Portuguese Christians. Of the various legends related to the foundation of Santarém, the most famous tells of the Visigoth Saint Iria (or Irene), who was martyred in Tomar (&quot;Nabantia&quot;) and whose uncorrupted body reached Santarém. In her honour, the name of the town (then known by its Latin name &quot;Scalabis&quot;) would later be changed to &quot;Sancta Irene&quot;, from which &quot;Santarém&quot; would eventually be derived.

The foundation of the city is attributed to the Romans, who occupied the region in the 2nd century BC and named the city &quot;Scalabis&quot;. During the Roman period Scalabis was an important commercial post in the mid-Tagus region and was the administrative capital of one of the regions (&quot;Conventus Scalabitanus&quot;) of Lusitania. Julius Caesar ordered the creation of a military camp in Santarém in 61 BC. The city takes at this time the designation of &quot;Scallabis Praesidium Iulium&quot;.

The 3rd century crisis and the decline of the Western Roman Empire affected the&quot; civitas&quot; and in the 5th century the town was conquered by Germanic tribes (Vandals and Alans). In 460, the Visigoths, led by Sunerico, conquered the city and expelled the Alans.

It was probably in the late period of Visigoth domination when the city took a new name after the local martyr Santa Irene, whose remains were credited to have been found near the Tagus. In any case, when the city was taken in the 8th century by the Arabs, they named it &quot;Shantarin&quot;, as a proof that the old Roman name had already been forgotten. Under the rule of the Arabs the city became an important cultural centre. Important Arab personalities born in Santarém include the poet and historian Ibn Bassam (died 1147) and the poet Ibn Sara (1043–1123).

The period of Arabic domination was finished in 1147 by the first King of Portugal, Afonso Henriques, who conquered the city on March 15. According to period chronicles, the King and a small army managed to take the city after some men climbed the walls during the night and opened the gates. The story of the conquest of Santarém is told in a heroic tone in the medieval chronicle &quot;De expugnatione Scalabis&quot;, which celebrates and justifies the power of the first Portuguese King. From a military point of view, the conquest of Santarém and, in that same year, of Lisbon were crucial steps in the Reconquista of Portugal.

The most notable Almohad ruler, Abu Yaqub Yusuf (patron of Averroes and Ibn Tufail), died in Santarém while trying to recapture it during the siege of 1184.

After the reconquest of Santarém, the city was frequently visited by the successive monarchs and many feudal parliaments (&quot;Cortes&quot;) were held in Santarém. King Fernando I, in particular, was very fond of the city and chose to be buried in the Convent of Saint Francis (&quot;Convento de São Francisco&quot;). His tomb is now in the Carmo Museum in Lisbon. The city was one of the most important in medieval Portugal, as attested by its large number of monasteries and its royal palace (no longer in existence but was located where the cathedral currently stands). There are still enough examples of Gothic buildings in the city for it to be known as the &quot;Capital of the Portuguese Gothic&quot;.

In the 15th century, during the period of Portuguese discoveries, expeditions like the conquest of Ceuta (1415) were planned in the royal palace of Santarém. Many important personalities related to this historical time are buried in the churches of Santarém. &quot;Pedro de Meneses&quot;, first governor of Ceuta (1415–1437) after the Portuguese conquest, is buried in a magnificent Gothic tomb in the Church of the Grace (&quot;Igreja da Graça&quot;). In the same church is also buried Pedro Álvares Cabral, the navigator that discovered Brazil in 1500.

The city was hit by earthquakes twice: one in 1531 and the other in 1755, which damaged the city and many historical monuments were lost. During the Napoleonic invasions in the early 19th century the city was invaded and pillaged.

In the second half of the 19th century many improvements reached Santarém, like running water, gas light, the building of a bridge over the Tagus and the railway in 1861. In the 20th century, the infrastructure of the city (education, housing, commerce) continued to improve and the economy of the city remained mainly dedicated to the production of agricultural goods.

* Grândola, Portugal
* Lubango, Angola
* Meknes, Morocco
* Santarém, Brazil

==Architecture==

Santarém city centre has several monuments, including the largest and most varied ensemble of gothic churches in Portugal. These include fine examples of transitional Romanesque–Gothic, mendicant (plain style derived from the mendicant orders) and late (flamboyant) Gothic. In addition, the city has nice examples of Manueline, Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque architecture.

*Old Castle of Santarém (&quot;Porta do Sol&quot;): Located on a high slope over the Tagus river and the surrounding landscape, the site of the old castle of Santarém is now a park. Part of the walls and towers of the castle are still preserved.
*Church of Saint John of Alporão (&quot;Igreja de São João de Alporão&quot;): Built between the 12th and the 13th centuries by the Knights Hospitallers, this church is an example of transitional architecture, with a Romanesque main portal and an early Gothic main chapel and vaulting. The arches of the ambulatory of the main chapel show Arabic (Mudéjar) influences. The church now houses a small Archaeological Museum. Its most important piece is the flamboyant Gothic tomb of &quot;Duarte de Meneses&quot; who disappeared in a battle in North Africa in 1465. His tomb is empty.
*Cabaças Tower (&quot;Torre das Cabaças&quot;): Ancient defensive tower of the mediaeval wall of the city. Houses the Time Museum with an exhibition about the measurement of time through the ages.
*Fountain of the Fig Trees (&quot;Fonte das Figueiras&quot;): Rare example of a 14th-century fountain in Portugal, decorated with merlons and coats-of-arms of Portugal and King Dinis I.
*Convent of Saint Claire (&quot;Convento de Santa Clara&quot;): 13th-century convent. Good example of Portuguese mendicant Gothic style. It also included a now lost altarpiece by the Mannerist artist Diogo de Contreiras.
*Convent of Saint Francis (&quot;Convento de São Francisco&quot;): Another 13th-century convent in medicant style. Has a nice Gothic cloister. King Ferdinand I was buried here.
*Church of Saint Stephen – Sanctuary of the Most Holy Miracle (&quot;Igreja de Santo Estevão – Santuário do Santíssimo Milagre&quot;): Home to the 13th-century Eucharistic Miracle of Santarém, a popular destination among Catholics worldwide.
*Church of the Grace (&quot;Igreja da Graça&quot;): Built between the 14th and 15th centuries in a mix of mendicant and flamboyant Gothic styles. Has a main portal and rose window (believed to be unique in the world, carved out of a single stone) that shows the influence of the Monastery of Batalha. The first governor of Ceuta &quot;Pedro de Meneses&quot; (died 1437) and his wife are buried here in a magnificent Gothic tomb with their recumbent figures holding each other&#x27;s hands. Pedro Álvares Cabral, discoverer of Brazil, and his wife are buried under a simple slab near the main chapel. The church was extensively renovated in the 1950s, eliminating all traces of development of the church later than 1500, so the current condition of the church provides a unique insight into a late 15th century church.
*Church of Marvila (&quot;Igreja de Marvila&quot;): This 16th-century church has a nice portal and main chapel in Manueline style. The nave and pulpit are in early Renaissance style. The interior walls are covered with 17th-century-multicoloured tiles with geometric patterns. It has one of the most outstanding tile-based interior decorations in Portugal.
*Cathedral of Santarém (&quot;Sé-Catedral&quot;): Built in the 17th century in mannerist style as the Jesuit church of the city, it became the Seminary church after the Jesuits were expelled from Portugal in the mid-18th century. The interior decoration is very rich, with altarpieces from various periods and styles (Mannerist and Baroque) and a ceiling with an illusionist painting. Since the 1970s it is the Cathedral of Santarém. The site of the church and seminary was previously occupied by the medieval royal palace of Santarém.

== Sport and leisure ==
The National Agricultural Fair has taken place since 1954. The annual event is held on the grounds of the CNEMA - National Exhibition Center and Agricultural Markets, south of the city. From 1999 to 2001 the main arena () was converted into a motorcycle speedway track and held a round of the 1999 European Club Champions&#x27; Cup and the 2000 Under-21 World Championship.

<text>, born (24 May 1923 – 13 February 2017), was a Japanese filmmaker, actor, and screenwriter. His films are known for their jarring visual style, irreverent humour, and entertainment-over-logic sensibility. He made 40 predominately B-movies for the Nikkatsu Company between 1956 and 1967, working most prolifically in the yakuza genre. His increasingly surreal style began to draw the ire of the studio in 1963 and culminated in his ultimate dismissal for what is now regarded as his magnum opus, &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; (1967), starring notable collaborator Joe Shishido. Suzuki successfully sued the studio for wrongful dismissal, but he was blacklisted for 10 years after that. As an independent filmmaker, he won critical acclaim and a Japanese Academy Award for his &quot;Taishō&quot; trilogy, &quot;Zigeunerweisen&quot; (1980), &quot;Kagero-za&quot; (1981) and &quot;Yumeji&quot; (1991).

His films remained widely unknown outside Japan until a series of theatrical retrospectives beginning in the mid-1980s, home video releases of key films such as &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Drifter&quot; in the late 1990s and tributes by such acclaimed filmmakers as Jim Jarmusch, Takeshi Kitano, Wong Kar-wai and Quentin Tarantino signaled his international discovery. Suzuki continued making films, albeit sporadically, until the early 2000s.
==Early life and career==
Suzuki was born during the Taishō period, and three months before the Great Kantō earthquake, in the Nihonbashi Ward (now the Chūō Special Ward) in Tokyo. His younger brother, Kenji Suzuki (now a retired NHK television announcer), was born six years his junior. His family was in the textile trade. After earning a degree at a Tokyo Trade School in 1941, Suzuki applied to the college of the Ministry of Agriculture, but failed the entrance exam due to poor marks in chemistry and physics. A year later he successfully enrolled in a Hirosaki college.

In 1943, he was recruited by the Imperial Japanese Army during the national student mobilization to serve in World War II. Sent to East Abiko, Chiba, he was assigned the rank of Private Second Class. He was shipwrecked twice throughout his military service; first the cargo ship that was to take him to the front was destroyed by an American submarine and he fled to the Philippines. Later, the freighter that took him to Taiwan sank after an attack by the American air force, and he spent 7 or 8 hours in the ocean before being rescued. In 1946, having attained the rank of Second Lieutenant in the Meteorological Corps, he returned to Hirosaki and completed his studies. About his time in the military Suzuki wrote:

He has also said that he often found the horrors of war comical, such as men being hoisted on board his ship with ropes and being battered black and blue against the hull, or the bugler blasting his trumpet every time a coffin was thrown into the sea. Ian Buruma writes, &quot;The humour of these situations might escape one who was not there. But Suzuki assures us that it was funny.&quot;

Next he applied to the prestigious University of Tokyo, but again failed the entrance exam. At the invitation of a friend, who had also failed the exam, Suzuki enrolled into the film department of the Kamakura Academy. In October 1948, he passed the Shochiku Company&#x27;s entrance exam and was hired as an assistant director in the company&#x27;s Ōfuna Studio. There he worked under directors Minora Shibuya, Yasushi Sasaki, Noboru Nakamura and Hideo Oniwa before joining the regular crew of Tsuruo Iwama.

==Rise and fall at Nikkatsu==
In 1954, the Nikkatsu Company reopened its doors after having ceased all film production at the onset of the war. It lured many assistant directors from the other major film studios with the promise of circumventing the usual long queue for promotion. Among these wayfarers was Suzuki, who took an assistant directing position there at approximately 3 times his previous salary. He worked under directors Hidesuke Takizawa, Kiyoshi Saeki, So Yamamura and Hiroshi Noguchi. His first screenplay to be filmed was &quot;Duel at Sunset&quot; (落日の決闘 &quot;Rakujitsu no ketto&quot;, 1955). It was directed by Hiroshi Noguchi. In 1956, he became a full-fledged director.

His directorial debut, credited to his real name, Seitarō Suzuki, was &quot;Victory Is Mine&quot;, a &quot;kayo eiga&quot;, or pop song film, part of a subgenre that functioned as a vehicle for hit pop records and singers. Impressed by the film&#x27;s quality Nikkatsu signed him to a longterm contract. Nearly all of the films that he made for Nikkatsu were program pictures, or B-movies, production-line genre films made on a tight schedule and shoestring budget that were meant to fill out the second half of a double feature. B-directors were expected to work fast, taking any and every script that was assigned to them, and they refused scripts only at the risk being dismissed. Suzuki maintained an impressive pace, averaging 3½ films per year, and claims to have turned down only 2 or 3 scripts during his years at the studio. He later said of his work schedule (and wrongful dismissal):

His third film and first yakuza action movie, &quot;Satan&#x27;s Town&quot;, linked him inexorably to the genre. &quot;Underworld Beauty&quot; (1958) marked his first CinemaScope film and was also the first to be credited to his pseudonym Seijun Suzuki.

Having enjoyed moderate success, his work began to draw more attention, especially among student audiences, with 1963&#x27;s &quot;Youth of the Beast&quot; which is considered his &quot;breakthrough&quot; by film scholars. Suzuki himself calls it his &quot;first truly original film.&quot; His style increasingly shirked genre conventions, favouring visual excess and visceral excitement over a coherent plot and injecting madcap humour into a normally solemn genre, developing into a distinctive &quot;voice&quot;. Tony Rayns explained, &quot;In his own eyes, the visual and structural qualities of his &#x27;60s genre films sprang from a mixture of boredom (&#x27;All company scripts were so similar; if I found a single line that was original, I could see room to do something with it&#x27;) and self-preservation (&#x27;Since all of us contract directors were working from identical scripts, it was important to find a way of standing out from the crowd&#x27;).&quot;

This development was furthered with the assistance of like-minded collaborators. Suzuki considered the production designer to be among the most important:

His fan base grew rapidly, but did not extend to studio president Kyusaku Hori. Beginning with &quot;Tattooed Life&quot;, the studio issued Suzuki his first warning for &quot;going too far&quot;. He responded with &quot;Carmen from Kawachi&quot; after which he was ordered to &quot;play it straight&quot; and had his budget slashed for his next film. The result was &quot;Tokyo Drifter&quot;, an &quot;ostensibly routine potboiler&quot; made into a &quot;jaw-dropping, eye-popping fantasia&quot;. Further reduced to filming in black-and-white Suzuki made his 40th film in his 12 years with the company, &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; (1967), considered an avant-garde masterpiece by critics, for which Hori promptly fired him.

==Suzuki v. Nikkatsu==

On 25 April 1968, Suzuki received a telephone call from a Nikkatsu secretary informing him that he would not be receiving his salary for that month. Two friends of Suzuki met with Hori the next day and were informed that &quot;Suzuki&#x27;s films were incomprehensible, that they did not make any money and that Suzuki might as well give up his career as a director as he would not be making films for any other companies.&quot; At that time the student-run film society Cine Club, headed by Kazuko Kawakita, was sponsoring a major retrospective of Suzuki&#x27;s films; meant to be the first in Japan to honour a Japanese director. It was scheduled to begin on 10 May, but Hori withdrew all of his films from distribution and refused to release them to the Cine Club. The students were told that &quot;Nikkatsu could not afford to cultivate a reputation for making films understood only by an exclusive audience and that showing incomprehensible and thus bad films would disgrace the company,&quot; adding that, &quot;Suzuki&#x27;s films would not be shown for some time in theaters or by the Cine Club.&quot;

Suzuki reported the illegal termination of his contract and the removal of his films from distribution to the Japanese Film Directors Association. Association chairman Heinosuke Gosho met with Hori on 2 May, but was unable to resolve the matter. Gosho then issued a public declaration condemning Nikkatsu for breach of contract and violation of Suzuki&#x27;s right to freedom of speech. On the day of the intended retrospective, the Cine Club met to discuss the situation. Two hundred people attended, much exceeding their expectations. A three-hour debate ensued as to whether they should negotiate the release of the films, or confront Nikkatsu directly. The former was agreed upon and it was decided that efforts had to be made to keep the public informed.

On 7 June, after repeated attempts to reason with Nikkatsu, Suzuki took the studio to court, suing for breach of contract and personal damages amounting to ¥7 380 000. He also demanded that Hori send letters of apology to the three major newspapers on account that Hori&#x27;s statements gave the impression that all of his films were bad. He then called a press conference with representatives of the Directors Guild of Japan, the Actors Guild, the Scriptwriters Guild, ATG and the Cine Club. Among the participates were directors Nagisa Oshima, Masahiro Shinoda and Kei Kumai. The only group not represented was the Nikkatsu Directors Association.

The Cine Club held a public demonstration on 12 June, which resulted in the formation of a joint committee supporting Suzuki against Nikkatsu. The committee was composed mostly of directors, actors, large student film groups and independent filmmakers. This also marked the first time the public became involved in a type of dispute normally confined to the industry. The Cine Club, and other similar groups, mobilized the public, holding panel discussions and leading mass demonstrations against the studio. The public support, garnered at the height of student movement, was based on a wide appreciation of Suzuki&#x27;s films and the idea that audiences should be able to see the types of films they wanted to see. This shook the film industry by the fact that the public was making demands rather than passively accepting their product.

Throughout the lawsuit, 19 witnesses were heard over a two and a half-year process including directors, newspaper reporters, film critics and two members of the film-going public. Kohshi Ueno writes of Suzuki&#x27;s own testimony on the making of &quot;Branded to Kill&quot;, &quot;A film scheduled for production was suddenly deemed inappropriate and Suzuki was called in at very short notice to fill the gap. The release date had already been set when Suzuki was asked to write the script. He suggested dropping the script when the head of the studio told him he had to read it twice before he understood it, but the company directed him to make the film. According to Suzuki, Nikkatsu was in no position to criticize him for a film that he made to help them out in an emergency.&quot; Suzuki had never before disclosed this information or discussed any internal company affairs and his testimony exposed the fact that the major studios assigned films to directors at random, improperly publicized them and expected directors to carry any blame.

It also came to light that, with the industry in decline since the early 1960s, by 1968 Nikkatsu was in the midst of a financial crisis. The studio had accumulated a ¥1 845 000 000 debt due to irresponsible management and was to undergo a massive restructuring. Film crew sizes were to be reduced, time cards introduced and advanced approval was required for all overtime. Hori, known as a totalitarian figure, unaccustomed to retracting statements or granting requests, had made an example of Suzuki apparently on the basis of his dislike of the film. In a New Year&#x27;s speech to the company he repeatedly emphasized that he wanted to make films that were &quot;easily understandable&quot;.

On 12 February 1971 testimony was completed and a verdict expected. However, in March the court advised a settlement, explaining appeals were extremely time-consuming. Negotiations began on 22 March and concluded on 24 December, three and a half years after the case had begun. Nikkatsu paid Suzuki　a fraction of his original claim, and Hori was forced to apologize for comments he made while serving as president. In a separate agreement Nikkatsu donated &quot;Fighting Elegy&quot; and &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; to the Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s Film Centre. At the time of settlement Suzuki expressed fears that if he had continued to fight he might not even be able to get an apology from the failing company. During the course of the litigation Nikkatsu was being slowly dismantled. Hori&#x27;s plans to restructure the company were unsuccessful and Nikkatsu was forced to liquidate studios and headquarter buildings. It released two final films in August 1971 and by November began producing &quot;roman porno&quot;, softcore romantic pornography. Despite Suzuki&#x27;s victory with wide support from the public and film world he was blacklisted by all major production companies and unable to make another film for 10 years.

==Late recognition==
To sustain himself during the trial and the blacklist years that followed, Suzuki published books of essays, and directed several television movies, series and commercials. The trial and protests had made him into a countercultural icon and his Nikkatsu films became quite popular at midnight screenings, playing to &quot;packed audiences who wildly applauded.&quot; He also began acting for other directors in small parts and cameos. His first credited screen role was a special appearance in Kazuki Omori&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait Until Dark!&quot; (1975). 
Shochiku, the company that started him as an assistant director, produced his return to film direction in 1977, &quot;A Tale of Sorrow and Sadness&quot;, a golf expose cum psychological thriller penned by sports-oriented manga illustrator Ikki Kajiwara. Joe Shishido appears in a brief cameo. The film was met poorly critically and popularly.

Suzuki collaborated with producer Genjiro Arato in 1980 and made the first part of what would become his &quot;Taishō&quot; trilogy, &quot;Zigeunerweisen&quot;, a psychological, period, ghost story, named after a gramophone record of gypsy violin music by Pablo de Sarasate featured prominently in the film. When exhibitors declined to show the film, Arato screened it himself in an inflatable mobile dome to great success. It won Honourable Mention at the 31st Berlin International Film Festival, was nominated for 9 Japanese Academy Awards and won four, including best director and best film, and was voted the no. 1 Japanese film of the 1980s by Japanese critics. He followed the film with &quot;Kagero-za&quot;, made the following year, and completed the trilogy ten years later with &quot;Yumeji&quot;. Suzuki commented on working outside of the studio system:

From 1978 to 1980, Suzuki served as a &quot;chief director&quot; (supervisor) on the popular anime series &quot;Lupin the Third Part II&quot;, itself influenced by his earlier films. He would return to the &quot;Lupin III&quot; franchise twice more, scripting the thirteenth episode of &quot;Lupin the 3rd Part III: The Pink Jacket Adventures&quot; and co-directing (with Shigetsugu Yoshida) its associated film, &quot;Legend of the Gold of Babylon&quot;, in 1985. According to &quot;Lupin III&quot; researcher Takeshi Ikemoto, Suzuki&#x27;s directorial credit on &quot;Legend of the Gold of Babylon&quot; was likely honorary, as there was a contemporary trend of crediting notable live-action directors on anime films to garner publicity, but it is also probable that his style did influence the production.

Italy hosted the first partial retrospective of his films outside Japan at the 1984 Pesaro International Film Festival. The 1994 touring retrospective &quot;Branded to Thrill: The Delirious Cinema of Suzuki Seijun&quot; showcased 14 of his films. In 2001, Nikkatsu hosted the &quot;Style to Kill&quot; retrospective featuring more than 20 of his films. In celebration of 50th anniversary of his directorial debut Nikkatsu again hosted the 2006 &quot;Suzuki Seijun 48 Film Challenge&quot; showcasing all of his films to date at the Tokyo International Film Festival.

He made a loose sequel to &quot;Branded to Kill&quot; with &quot;Pistol Opera&quot; (2001). Makiko Esumi replaced Joe Shishido as the number 3 killer. This was followed by &quot;Princess Raccoon&quot; (2005), starring Zhang Ziyi, a musical love story. In a 2006 interview, he said that he had no plans to direct any further films, citing health concerns. He had been diagnosed with pulmonary emphysema and was permanently hooked up to a portable respirator. However, he attended the 2008 Tokyo Project Gathering, a venue serving film financing and international co-productions, and pitched a film titled &quot;A Goldfish of the Flame&quot;.

==Death==
Seijun Suzuki died on 13 February 2017 at a Tokyo hospital. His death was announced by Nikkatsu. He died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

==Filmmaking technique==
As a contract B director at Nikkatsu, Suzuki&#x27;s films were made following a rigid structure. He was assigned a film and script, and could only refuse it at the risk of losing his job. He claims to have turned down only 2 or 3 scripts in his time with Nikkatsu but always modified the scripts both in preproduction and during shooting. Nikkatsu also assigned an actor for the lead, or leads, either a (usually 2nd-tier) star or one being groomed for stardom. The rest of the cast was not assigned but typically drawn from the studio&#x27;s pool of contract actors. Most studio A films had a set budget of ¥45 million where Suzuki&#x27;s black-and-white Bs ran 20 million and his colour films were provided an additional 3 million. His films were scheduled 10 days for pre-production, such as location scouting, set design and costumes, 25 days for shooting and 3 days for post-production, such as editing and dubbing. Within this framework he had a greater degree of control than the A directors as the cheaper B productions drew a less watchful eye from the head office.

<doc id="424796" wikidata="Q3308979" url="?curid=424796" title="Advice (constitutional law)">
<text>In a parliamentary system, advice is a formal and usually binding instruction given by one constitutional officer of state to another. Heads of state often act on the basis of advice issued by prime ministers or other government ministers. For example, in constitutional monarchies, the monarch usually appoints ministers of the Crown on the advice of their prime minister.

Among the most prominent forms of advice offered are, among other things:
* Advice to appoint and remove individual ministers.
* Advice to dissolve parliament.
* Advice to deliver formal statements, such as a speech from the throne.

In some states, the duty to accept advice is legally enforceable, either recognized as a binding obligation under &quot;jus cogens&quot; principles or established by constitution or statute. Under the Westminster system, advice may legally be rejected; for example, in several Commonwealth realms, the monarch is not legally obliged to accept the advice of his or her ministers. This lack of obligation forms part of the basis for the monarch&#x27;s reserve powers. Nevertheless, the convention that the head of state accept ministerial advice is so strong that in ordinary circumstances, refusal to do so would almost certainly provoke a constitutional crisis. 

Although most advice is binding, in comparatively rare instances it is not. For example, many heads of state may choose not to follow advice on a dissolution of parliament where the government has lost the confidence of that body. In some cases, whether the advice is mandatory or truly just advisory depends on the context and authority of the person offering it. Hence the president of Ireland ordinarily is obliged to dissolve &quot;Dáil Éireann&quot; (Assembly of Ireland) when advised to do so by the &quot;taoiseach&quot; (prime minister). However, if a &quot;taoiseach&quot; has (in the words of the Constitution of Ireland) &quot;ceased to retain the support of a majority in &quot;Dáil Éireann&quot;&quot; (i.e., lost the confidence of parliament) the president has the option of refusing to follow that advice, and thus force the &quot;taoiseach&quot; to resign.

<text>The Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU or KPU) is a banned political party in Ukraine. It was founded in 1993 and claimed to be the successor to the Soviet-era Communist Party of Ukraine, which had been banned in 1991. In 2002 it held a &quot;unification&quot; congress when both &quot;old and new&quot; parties merged. The party is a member of the Moscow-based Union of Communist Parties, an umbrella organisation for all communist parties of the former Soviet Union. The party has been led by Petro Symonenko since it was founded.

Communist parties have a long history in Ukraine. With the fall of the Soviet Union, members of the Soviet-era Communist Party of Ukraine formed the Socialist Party of Ukraine. After being revived in 1993, the Communist Party was represented in the Ukrainian parliament from 1994 until the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, which ended a period of parliamentary representation for communists stretching back to 1918. The Communist Party and its predecessor were the largest party in Ukrainian parliamentary elections for the first eight years of free and fair election, from 1990 until 1998.

According to Ukrainian sociologist Volodymyr Ishchenko, by the 2010s the party had &quot;degenerated into a conservative and pro-Russian rather than pro-working class grouping, gradually losing its voters and membership&quot;.

During the 2013–2014 Euromaidan protests, the party voted for anti-protest laws. However, it also voted to remove President Viktor Yanukovych from office in the Revolution of Dignity. During the Russian-Ukrainian conflict which followed, the Security Service of Ukraine said the party was actively helping pro-Russian separatists and Russian proxy forces, which it denied. Regional party cells formed the pro-separatist Communist Party of the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic. In May 2015, Ukraine banned Soviet communist symbols. Because of these laws, and the Communist Party&#x27;s support for Donbas separatists, the party was barred from standing in elections. In December 2015, the Communist Party was banned, for actions &quot;aimed at violating Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, collaboration with Russian proxy forces, and inciting ethnic hatred&quot;. The party appealed the ban to the European Court of Human Rights and various Ukrainian courts, and participated in some elections by joining umbrella groups and running candidates as independents. The Central Election Commission of Ukraine prohibited Symonenko&#x27;s candidacy for the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election.

Party officials reportedly supported the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. As a result, its ban was upheld and its assets were seized by the state in July 2022.

== History ==
===Early years and electoral successes===
The KPU considers itself to be the direct successor to the original Communist Party of Ukraine, a branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) which was founded on 5 July 1918 in Moscow. The original communist party existed until 30 August 1991, when the CPSU and its branch in Ukraine were banned. Between 1991 and 1993, several small communist organizations were created throughout Ukraine. &quot;Without clear legality&quot;, communists from all over Ukraine convened on 6 March 1993 for the All-Ukrainian Conference for Communists in an attempt to reestablish the KPU. In reaction, the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament) legalized the establishment of communist parties two months later. On 19 June 1993, the 1st Congress of the newly founded KPU was convened. Officially, it was designated as the 29th Congress to denote it as a direct successor to the Soviet KPU and it elected Petro Symonenko as First Secretary. 

In the 1994 presidential election, the KPU supported the candidacy of Oleksandr Moroz from the Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU). The relationship between the KPU and SPU was strong throughout the 1990s, with Moroz even speaking to the 22nd KPU Congress (held in 1999).

In the 1998 Ukrainian parliamentary election the party gained 24.65% of the vote and 123 seats, becoming the largest party in Parliament. The first ten members on the party list were Petro Symonenko (MP), Omelian Parubok (MP), Anatoliy Nalyvaiko (tunneler of the Karl Marks Mine (Yenakieve)), Borys Oliynyk (MP), Valeria Zaklunna-Myronenko (actress of the Lesya Ukrainka Theater (Kyiv)), Adam Martynyuk (the 2nd secretary of the Central Committee of CPU), Anatoliy Draholyuntsev (mechanic-electrician at Luhanskteplovoz), Vasyl Sirenko (Koretsky Institute of State and Law (NANU), unaffiliated), Borys Molchanov (tool craftsman at Dniproshyna) and Anatoliy Strohov (pensioner). The KPU won 121 seats, constituting 19.5% of the seats in the Verkhovna Rada.

The good result in the 1998 election led the KPU to field their own candidate in the 1999 presidential election as they nominated party leader Symonenko. Symonenko received 23.1 percent of the votes in the first round, trailing behind Leonid Kuchma who received 38,0 percent of the votes. In the second round Symonenko received 38,8 percent, losing to Kuchma who received 57,7 percent of the vote.

In 2000, two parties split from the party, namely the Communist Party of Ukraine (renewed) and the Communist Party of Workers and Peasants. The KPU argued that the creation of parties was encouraged by President Leonid Kuchma in order to syphon votes away from their party.

The Constitutional Court of Ukraine recognized in 2001 that the ban on the Communist Party of Ukraine violated the Constitution of Ukraine.

At the parliamentary election on 30 March 2002, the party won 19.98% of the popular vote and 66 out of 450 seats in the Verkhovna Rada. The first ten members on the party list were Petro Symonenko (MP), Omelian Parubok (MP), Ivan Herasymov (Head of the Veterans of Ukraine Organization, unaffiliated), Borys Oliynyk (MP), Valeria Zaklunna-Myronenko (MP), Adam Martynyuk (MP), Stanislav Hurenko (MP), Oleksandr Tkachenko (MP), Anatoliy Nalyvaiko (MP) and Oleh Blokhin (MP, unaffiliated).

===Electoral decline===
Symonenko&#x27;s support sharply declined at the time of the 2004 presidential election. Symonenko received 5% of the votes and came in fourth place, unable to get into the controversial runoff which caused the Orange Revolution.

Since then, the party lost much support, particularly after the Orange Revolution. In the 2006 parliamentary election, the party won 3.66% and 21 seats. The first ten members on the party list were Petro Symonenko (MP), Adam Martynyuk (MP), Ivan Herasymov (MP), Kateryna Samoilyk (MP), Omelian Parubok (MP), Valeria Zaklunna-Myronenko (MP), Oleksandr Holub (MP), Valentyn Matvyeyev (MP), Oleksandr Tkachenko (MP) and Petro Tsybenko (MP).

No later than 2006, the Communist Party office in Donetsk on regular basis provided material and logistical assistance to the separatist organization Donetsk Republic (banned in 2007) which with the assistance of the Communist Party was spreading printed information materials of separatist orientation in authorship of the ideologist of Donetsk internationalism Dmitriy Kornilov as well as by collecting signatures for &quot;independence of Donbass&quot; agitated for violation of territorial integrity of Ukraine through seceding several oblasts of Ukraine from Ukraine and uniting them into one quasi state formation based on Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson &quot;republics&quot;. Even after the Donetsk Republic Party was banned for separatism on 6 November 2007 by the Donetsk district administrative court on the suit of the Chief Justice Administration of Donetsk Oblast based on materials of the Security Service of Ukraine, the Donetsk branch of Communists did not cease to assist separatists with its tents and printing capabilities periodically conducting joint campaigns with them.

In the parliamentary election on 30 September 2007, the party won 5.39% of the popular vote and 27 out of 450 seats. The first ten members on the party list were Petro Symonenko (MP), Yevhen Volynets (tunneler of the Vasily Chapayev Mine (Shakhtarsk)), Maryna Perestenko (Head of the Mars farm (Simferopol Raion)), Ivan Herasymov (MP), Yuriy Haidayev (Minister of Healthcare, unaffiliated), Adam Martynyuk (1st deputy Chairman of parliament), Valeriy Bevz (Deputy Minister of Emergencies), Oleksandr Tkachenko (MP), Oleksandr Holub (MP) and Ihor Aleksyeyev (MP). The party participated in the 2010 presidential election as part of the Election bloc of left and central left political forces.

The party participated in the 2010 presidential election as part of the Election bloc of left and central left political forces.

The Communist Party was part of the parliamentary coalition called &quot;Stability and Reforms&quot; that supported the First Azarov government.

On 28 November 2006, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted the Law of Ukraine &quot;About the 1932–1933 Holodomor in Ukraine&quot;. The first article of the document states: &quot;The Holodomor is a genocide against the Ukrainian people&quot;. The second article states that the public denial of the Holodomor as a genocide is recognized as desecration of the memory of millions of victims, disparaging of Ukrainian people and is unlawful. On 13 January 2010, the Kyiv Appellate Court reviewed the criminal case on the fact of committing genocide (crime against humanity) and agreed with the conclusions of the investigation that the leadership of the Soviet Union, including Joseph Stalin and others, had purposely created such living conditions designed to physically eliminate a part of the Ukrainian national group. The court found Stalin and others guilty of indirectly committing the crime. Less than four months after the ruling, on 5 May 2010, the Communist Party branch office in Zaporizhzhia Oblast publicly unveiled a monument of Stalin in Zaporizhzhia. Members of the Communist Party were criticized for hindering journalist activity and cursing at protesters during the event. Three people also reportedly fainted from the heat during the unveiling ceremony, and one woman later died from a heatstroke. The Communist Party was criticized for a statement it later issued in memory of the woman who died, which said, &quot;She died a worthy death in front of Stalin.&quot;

In the 2010 local elections, the party scored between 5% and 12% of the votes in all Ukrainian Oblasts, except in Western Ukraine and Kyiv Oblast, where they almost had no voters.

In the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election, the party won 13.18% of the national votes and no constituencies (it had competed in 220 of the 225 constituencies) and thus 32 seats. The party did win about one and a half million more votes compared with the results of the previous election. Independent candidate Oksana Kaletnyk joined the Communist parliamentary faction on 12 December 2012. Importance of Kaletnyk joining the Communists was due to parliamentary regulations on obtaining its own parliamentary factions which required to have at least one deputy who came to parliament by winning a constituency. Oleh Tyahnybok tried to challenge the creation of Communist faction, but on 30 January 2013 the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine declined his petition. Kaletnyk left the faction (at her own request) on 29 May 2014. The first ten members on the party list were Petro Symonenko (MP), Petro Tsybenko (MP), Iryna Spirina (Head of Psychiatric Department (Dnipropetrovsk Medical Academy)), Spiridon Kilinkarov (MP), Oleksandr Prysyazhnyuk (unemployed), Ihor Aleksyeyev (MP), Ihor Kalyetnik (Head of the State Customs Service of Ukraine), Adam Martynyuk (1st deputy Chairman of parliament), Valentyn Matvyeyev (MP) and Yevhen Marmazov (MP). In 2007 and 2012, the electorate of the party was estimated to be very loyal to the party.

The party supported the vote of Mykola Azarov&#x27;s candidacy for the post of Prime Minister that created the Second Azarov government. Symonenko stated on 28 December 2012 that the Communist Party of Ukraine and Azarov&#x27;s (and President Viktor Yanukovych&#x27;s) Party of Regions had not concluded any agreements concerning the Communist support, but that his party had supported Azarov&#x27;s nomination because Azarov had told them his government was ready to implement the program on Ukraine&#x27;s accession to the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia. Symonenko added that should Azarov fail to fulfill the promise of Ukraine&#x27;s joining this customs union, the Communists would initiate his resignation. The government continued to negotiate with the European Union for Ukraine&#x27;s integration in the European Union while (according to President Yanukovych) it was also in negotiations with Russia to &quot;find the right model&quot; for cooperation with the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia.

===Ukrainian Revolution===

From November 2013 until February 2014, there were large protests throughout Ukraine. They were sparked by President Yanukovych&#x27;s sudden decision not to sign the political association and free trade agreement with the EU, instead choosing closer ties to Russia.

The Communist Party of Ukraine opposed the protests, but did not support Yanukovych. In January 2014 the party supported the draconian Anti-protest laws that severely restricted freedom of speech and the right to protest. In January and February 2014, clashes in Kyiv between protesters and Berkut special riot police resulted in the deaths of 108 protesters and 13 police officers.

On 22 February 2014, Ukraine&#x27;s parliament voted 328–0 (about 73% of the parliament&#x27;s 450 members) to remove Yanukovych from his post and to schedule an early presidential election for 25 May. The thirty deputies of the Communist Party voted for his removal.

In February 2014, the party came out in firm opposition to the violence and identified the protest movement as a &quot;coup&quot; to overthrow the elected government and replace it with a pro-NATO regime and in an open plea from the First Secretary called for all communist and left-wing movements around the world to condemn the events as such. However, the party did vote to remove Yanukovych.

===During the Russo-Ukrainian war===

Immediately after the revolution, pro-Russian, counter-revolutionary protests erupted in southern and eastern Ukraine. Russia occupied and then annexed Crimea, while armed pro-Russian separatists seized government buildings and proclaimed the independent states of Donetsk and Luhansk, sparking the Donbas war.

The Security Service of Ukraine gathered intelligence that the Communist Party of Ukraine had been helping the Russian proxy forces. In May 2014, Ukraine&#x27;s Acting President, Oleksandr Turchynov, asked the Ministry of Justice to examine whether the party was involved in actions aimed at violating Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to take steps to ban the party if this is proven.

On 11 April, there was a scuffle in the Verkhovna Rada between KPU leader Petro Symonenko and two MPs from the far-right &quot;Svoboda&quot; party, after Symonenko blamed them for the Russian annexation of Crimea and the pro-Russian unrest. After repeatedly calling for calm, the parliament chairman suspended the session for fifteen minutes. On 6 May, a majority of MPs voted to expel the Communist Party from the parliamentary session hall for making a pro-separatist declaration.

In the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, Symonenko initially again ran as a candidate of his party, but he withdrew from the race on 16 May. The Central Election Commission was unable to remove his name from the ballot because he withdrew from the race after the deadline of 1 May. In the election, he received 1.5% of the vote.

On 8 July, the Ministry of Justice asked Kyiv&#x27;s District Administrative Court to ban the activity of the party as a result of &quot;a large amount of evidence regarding illegal activities and illegal actions on the part of the Communist Party&quot; (according to Justice Minister Pavlo Petrenko). The Party of the European Left and the European United Left–Nordic Green Left grouping in the European Parliament condemned the possible ban and declared their solidarity with the KPU. Russia&#x27;s State Duma denounced the ban too and said it was &quot;an attempt by the new Kyiv authorities to force political and civil forces that do not agree with the path taken by the ultranationalist powers to shut up&quot;. The KPU also received solidarity from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) in Britain.

On 1 July, six MPs left the Communist Party faction in parliament, reducing it to 23 members. On 22 July, a vote supported by 232 MPs gave the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (the speaker of Ukraine&#x27;s parliament) the power to dissolve a faction that has lost some of its members compared to the number it had while it was formed during the first parliamentary session after the previous election, pending a signature from President Petro Poroshenko. Later that day, Poroshenko signed this bill, giving effect to this new parliamentary regulation. The next day, speaker and former Acting President Turchynov announced the party&#x27;s impending dissolution and added to MPs: &quot;We only have to tolerate this party for another day&quot;. The party&#x27;s faction in parliament was dissolved on 24 July by Turchynov. That same day, it was announced that 308 criminal proceedings had been opened against members of the party. Communist Party members were accused of openly supporting the Russian annexation of Crimea, supporting the breakaway Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic, and agitating for Russian annexation of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

On 4 September, the Kyiv District Administrative Court indefinitely postponed the hearing about the ban of the party.

The October 2014 parliamentary election further marginalized the party as it won no constituency seats and came 1.12% short of reaching the 5% election threshold. This meant that for the first time since 1918, Communists were not represented in Ukrainian national politics. The first ten members on the party list for the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election were Petro Symonenko (MP), Adam Martynyuk (MP), Kateryna Samoylyk (senior), Vasyl Sirenko (Koretsky Institute of State and Law, non-partisan), Petro Tsybenko (MP), Ihor Aleksyeyev (MP), Serhiy Hordiyenko (MP), Yevhen Marmazov (MP), Spiridon Kilinkarov (MP) and Serhiy Khrapov (unemployed).

In May 2015, laws that banned Soviet communist symbols (the so-called &quot;decommunization laws&quot;) came into effect in Ukraine, meaning that the party could not use communist symbols or sing the Soviet national hymn or &quot;The Internationale&quot;. In a 24 July decree based on these laws, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry stripped the party of its right to participate in elections and stated that it was continuing the court actions (which started in July 2014) to end the registration of Ukraine&#x27;s communist parties.

On 30 September, the District Administrative Court in Kyiv banned two smaller communist parties: the Communist Party of Workers and Peasants and the Communist Party of Ukraine (renewed). However, the Communist Party was not banned because it had filed an appeal against the Justice Ministry&#x27;s decree on its activity termination.

The party decided to take part in the October 2015 local elections as part of the umbrella party Left Opposition. According to the Interior Ministry, this was legal as long as the new party did not use communist symbols. Other party members took part in this election as Nova Derzhava. The political party Nova Derzhava was established in 2012. On 1 August, it elected a new leader Oleh Melnyk. Formally along with the Communist Party, it is also a member of the Left Opposition Association.

In late 2015, 19 local party leaders from the party&#x27;s South and East Ukraine organizations resigned from the central committee to protest against the repression of internal dissent they blamed on Symonenko.

====Banning====
On 16 December 2015, at the request of the Ministry of Justice, the District Administrative Court in Kyiv banned the Communist Party for actions aimed at violating Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, collaboration with Russian proxy forces, and inciting ethnic hatred. This ban was criticized by John Dalhuisen of Amnesty International, who said the ban was &quot;the same style of draconian measures used to stifle dissent&quot; in the Soviet Union. On 25 January 2016, the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine denied the party in the consideration of the cassation of the (16 December 2015) ban. The court suspended the appeal for the time being until the Constitutional Court determines the legitimacy of the law on decommunization. Nevertheless, the party appealed its ban at the European Court of Human Rights. The attempts to ban the party never did forbid individual members of the party to take part in elections as an independent candidate.

The party still sends in its required financial reports and is still listed on the website of the Ministry of Justice and the website of the Department of State Registration and Notary. In February 2019, the Central Election Commission of Ukraine refused to register the candidacy of Symonenko for the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election due to the fact that the statute, name and symbolism of the Communist Party did not comply with the 2015 decommunization laws.

According to a Kyiv Polytechnic professor, who published an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the party came into conflict with the Ukrainian government after the Revolution of Dignity due to prominent displays of support for ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych during the Euromaidan protests and alleged involvement with the separatist movement in Donbas as well as the party&#x27;s pro-Russian government agenda. However, the party did vote in favour of the impeachment of Yanukovych. Two days after the Ukrainian parliament changed its regulations regarding the required size of parliamentary groups, the Communist Party faction was dissolved on 24 July 2014.

According to political scientist Tadeusz A. Olszański, the party &quot;effectively supports the separatist rebellion&quot; during the Russo-Ukrainian War.

Explaining the withdrawal of the status of political party from the KPU and two of its satellites, the secretary of state security and defense Oleksandr Turchynov stated in July 2015 that the Communist Party took a treacherous position from the very first days of Russian aggression and acted as its Fifth Column.

====Seizure of assets====
On 6 July 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the KPU was again banned after a Lviv court ruling which turned over all its assets, including party buildings and funds, to the Ukrainian state. In a statement, the Eighth Administrative Appeal Court said that it had satisfied the claims of the Ministry of Justice and ordered the party&#x27;s banning. &quot;The activity of the Communist Party of Ukraine is prohibited; the property, funds and other assets of the party, its regional, city, district organisations, primary centres and other structural entities have been transferred to the state.&quot;

During the Russian invasion, the party was reported to have taken a pro-Russian stance, and the party&#x27;s leader Petro Symonenko in March had fled to Belarus with the assistance of Russian forces during the Kyiv offensive.

In October 2022, Symonenko took part in the International Meeting of Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties in Havana, Cuba. During the speech, he blamed the United States and the United Kingdom for the war, and said they wanted to &quot;use Ukraine against Russia and Taiwan against China&quot;.

In August 2023, the Security Service of Ukraine opened an investigation against him on the charges of sedition and treason.

== Ideology ==
In its statute, the Communist Party claims that &quot;on voluntary basis it unites citizens of Ukraine who are supporters of the Communist idea&quot;. The party considers itself a successor of the Communist Party of Ukraine of the Soviet Union and calls itself a &quot;battle detachment of RKP(b)–VKP(b)–KPSS&quot;. The party claims that prohibition of that party in August 1991 was unlawful, which was confirmed by the decision of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine on 27 December 2001. The party sets itself in an opposition to any government and seeks a full restoration of the socialist state in the country without any particular association with any other political parties.

=== Soviet legacy ===
The KPU was established as &quot;the inheritor of the ideas and traditions of the KPU, as it existed until its banning in August 1991&quot;. In general, the party has laid weight on nostalgia for the Soviet Union to gain votes. In contrast to many parts of the former Soviet Union where leftist conservatives have tried to win votes by promoting local nationalism, the KPU supports a form of Soviet nationalism, considering the establishment of an independent Ukraine as illegal. The party has remained loyal to the legacy of the Soviet Union. In 1998, to celebrate the would-be 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union it published &quot;Historical Thesis&quot;, a text which painted a rosy picture of the former state. The Soviet Union is barely criticized and controversial events such as the Great Purge and Holodomor are not mentioned in the party press. There are some who are favorable to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s legacy, giving the impression that things &quot;only began to go wrong with [Nikita] Khrushchev&#x27;s &#x27;adventurism&#x27;&quot;. Despite all this, when the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) is criticized at all, the favored line is that the party and state lost their belief in key Leninist principles. Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Union, &quot;is still considered sacrosanct&quot; by the party and official pronouncements talk of the &quot;Leninist Communist Party of Ukraine&quot; and more precisely that the KPU continues &quot;speaking in the words of Lenin&quot;.

Symonenko has criticized the label of conservative on the KPU, stating that the party is not willing to abandon its own history. He has referred to the dissolution of the Soviet Union as &quot;the tragic events of the recent past&quot;. Further, the KPU believes the Soviet Union &quot;was criminally destroyed&quot;. The party believes that Ukraine has been living off the legacy of the Soviet Union since its independence. However, certain concessions to the present have been made and at the 2nd KPU Congress it was stated that &quot;it would be utopian to try and revive a socio-economic system of different relations, which existed in different conditions, under different principles and different organizations of production and distribution, different social-class structures of society, a different level of consciousness&quot;.

=== Marxism ===
The party adheres and believes in the Marxian concepts of class struggle and historical materialism. Their ongoing belief in historical materialism cements their views that the socialist mode of production will still be the society of the future. It could be said that the party believed stronger than ever in the possibility of a socialist future since the &quot;careerists&quot;, symbolized by Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, were gone.

The KPU believes that since the West has developed into a post-industrial society, capitalism through globalization was actively &quot;de-modernizing&quot; Ukraine. This was in their favor since de-modernization would lead to the reestablishment of a dominant proletarian class. As Vasyl Tereshchuk, a former party theoretician expelled in 2005, noted: &quot;People are surviving on what they accumulated in the years of Soviet power: that is, they are not yet a classic proletariat as they still have much to lose (a flat, a car, a dacha, etc.). But their full proletarianization will come sooner or later&quot;. Secondly, the dissolution of the Soviet Union directly led to the reestablishment of class antagonism in society. This antagonism led to the exploitation of the proletariat by &quot;a comprador bourgeoisie ... behind which stands world imperialism headed by the USA&quot;. According to Symonenko, on this basis there was no chance for a social democratic movement ever to develop in Ukraine. The &quot;softening of class antagonism in the West&quot; which had led to the establishment of social democratic parties &quot;was only possible because the local working class, as part of the &#x27;golden billion&#x27;, lived &#x27;as parasites on the labour of the countries of the world periphery&#x27; to which Ukraine was rapidly being consigned. Ukraine could not expect any &#x27;lessening of class
antagonism, only the reverse&quot;. Symonenko appreciates the economical aid and partnership with China and calls to use the Chinese Communist Party as the example, giving the country back to the working people, and &quot;build our country into a strong country like China&quot;.

=== Views on nationalism ===
At least in the beginning, the party is best described as Soviet patriotic. As Yurii Solomatin, a member of parliament, noted in 2000, &quot;we are Soviet communists; we are Soviet people; we are Soviet patriots&quot;. The party continues speaking about the existence of a &quot;Soviet people&quot; and &quot;Soviet homeland&quot; and at the beginning no concessions were given to local Ukrainian nationalism. There has been no talk of establishing a national communism unique to Ukraine and the 1st KPU Congress even criticized the notion of establishing a unique &quot;Ukrainian communism&quot;. Instead, the KPU has opted promoting Ukraine as a &quot;bi-cultural state&quot;. At the 1st KPU Congress, Symonenko told the delegates that &quot;&#x27;the interests, rights and specific traits of one nation above those of other nations and nationalities&#x27;, and in which &#x27;the Ukrainian language&#x27; should not be &#x27;over&#x27;-privileged, but left alone to enjoy &#x27;its natural development, purged of the imposed language of the diaspora. The Russian language, as the native language of half the population of Ukraine, [should be given] the status of a state language alongside Ukrainian&quot;. Their views on patriotism is highly nostalgic. When the Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union (UCP–CPSU), a loose organization of post-Soviet parties was formed, it was met with open arms. However, when the Communist Party of the Russian Federation proposed in 1995 to transform the organization into a modern-day Comintern, the KPU opposed because of their Soviet patriotic views.

In recent years, their commitment to Soviet patriotism has been partially replaced with a vaguer Eurasianism. Wishing not to reestablish a union with Russia &quot;as a protectorate of the Russian bourgeoisie&quot;, &quot;the Ukrainian Communists have rediscovered the natural link from Soviet to East Slavic or Eurasian nationalism in the supposed common &#x27;economic civilization&#x27; and proclivity for collective labour of all the East Slavic peoples&quot;. As noted in the party journal &quot;Communist&quot;, the &quot;&#x27;Soviet man ... did not emerge from nothing before him stood the courageous Slavic-Rusich, the labour-loving Ukrainian peasant, the self-sacrificing Cossack&quot;. At the 4th KPU Congress, the party conceded that Ukraine would not join any particular union as long as it weakened the country&#x27;s sovereignty. At the same time, Petro Symonenko publicly backed Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the Eurasian Customs Union.

Symonenko has often been referred to as a Ukrainophobe. Symonenko made controversy in 2007 when he accused the Ukrainian nationalist figure Roman Shukhevych of receiving two Iron Crosses from Adolf Hitler. Shukhevych&#x27;s children submitted a lawsuit against Symonenko in response. The Pechersk District Court of Kyiv city declared that Symonenko failed to present any proof of his claim and obligated &quot;to refute the false information he spread about Roman Shukhevych at the next plenary session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine after the court&#x27;s decision enters into force&quot;.

== Criticism ==
Writing on &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Ukrainian sociologist Volodymyr Ishchenko described the KPU as a &quot;conservative and pro-Russian group&quot;, whose leaders &quot;became a part of the bourgeois elite and invited business support for their cause&quot;, pointing out that the richest deputy of the 7th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada (Oksana Kalietnik) was a member of the Communist faction. Thus, according to Ishchenko &quot;the only things the party has in common with the determined Bolshevik revolutionaries of the past who spared neither themselves nor others are devotion to the Soviet symbols and appeals to empty &#x27;Marxist-Leninist&#x27; phrases&quot;.

After the start of Euromaidan and the Revolution of Dignity, the party newspaper &quot;Komunist&quot; published an article comparing the protests to riots in Black ghettoes in the United States during the 1960s; the article, titled &quot;White on the outside, black on the inside&quot;, stated that &quot;at least in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco the police sometimes make raids on such places and simply kill a few rabid Negroes. [...] Even the dark-skinned vendors in Kyiv second hand shops seem a bit more civilized than our &#x27;light-skinned brothers&#x27; from the western regions of the country, who have gathered on the Maidan&quot;. The article was widely condemned as racist.

<text>The Ecological Democratic Party (, ÖDP) is a green conservative and ecologist minor party in Germany. The ÖDP was founded in 1982.

The strongest level of voting support for the ÖDP is in Bavaria, where in federal state elections they have remained stable with 1.6-2% of the votes since 1990, and at municipal level have increased their mandate count in 2014 from 320 to around 380. The ÖDP is a member of the World Ecological Parties.

==History==
The Ecological Democratic Party is a green party that is active throughout Germany and has its clear focus in Bavaria.

The party&#x27;s rise is closely linked to its founder, the politician and environmentalist Herbert Gruhl. Gruhl was Member of the Bundestag from 1969 to 1980 and member of CDU. The founding of ÖDP dates back on the ecological movement in the 1970s. Gruhl gained attention by publishing a best-seller in 1975: &quot;Ein Planet wird geplündert&quot; (A Planet is Being Plundered). In the book he criticized the growth-oriented economy of industrial society. He also attacked nuclear energy policy and thus represented a clear minority position among Christian Democrats, while an intensive discussion was already developing in the SPD about a possible nuclear phase-out. Gruhl left the CDU in 1978 but stayed as non-partisan member of the Bundestag until 1980. He founded the &quot;Grüne Aktion Zukunft&quot; (GAZ), which later became part of The Greens. Gruhl lost the election for party chairman. Gruhl had a more conservative consistent life ethic (&quot;Lebensschutzkonzeption&quot;), which addresses besides environmentalism also the rejection of abortion, euthanasia and the death penalty. Also his policy was referred as ethno-centric. Gruhl left the Greens and, in 1982, founded the ÖDP.

Though a minor party – it has not gained seats in a state parliament or in the Bundestag – the ÖDP became notable for its involvement in the opposition to a Czech nuclear reactor in Temelín, across the border from Bavaria. It led an initiative for a popular referendum to abolish the Bavarian Senate (that state&#x27;s upper house) which was successful. 

It brought a lawsuit against a law in North Rhine-Westphalia which requires parties to receive 5% of the vote in order to take their seats in local councils, as well as a national law which reserves state financing only for parties that got more than one percent of the vote in at least three state elections; both laws were overturned.

In the 1983 federal election, the party received 0.03% of the national vote (11,028 votes in total).

In the 1984 European parliament elections, the party received 0.3% of the national vote (77,026 votes in total).

In the 1987 federal election, the party received 0.3% of the national vote (109,152 votes in total).

In the 1989 European parliament elections, the party received 0.7% of the national vote (184,309 votes in total).

In the 1990 federal election, the party received 0.4% of the national vote (205,206 votes in total), its best result in a federal election.

In the 1994 European parliament elections, the party received 0.8% of the national vote (273,776 votes in total).

In the 1994 federal election, the party received 0.4% of the national vote (183,715 votes in total). 

In the 1998 federal election, the party received 0.2% of the national vote (98,257 votes in total).

In the 1999 European parliament elections, the party received 0.4% of the national vote (100,048 votes in total).

In the 2002 federal election, the party received 0.1% of the national vote (56,898 votes in total).

In the 2004 European parliament elections, the party received 0.6% of the national vote (145,537 votes in total).

The ÖDP did not participate in the 2005 federal election.

In the 2009 European parliament elections, the party received 0.5% of the national vote (134,893 votes in total).

In the 2009 federal election, the party received 0.3% of the national vote (132,249 votes in total).

In the 2013 federal election, the party received 0.3% of the national vote (127,088 votes in total).

==Ideology==

In its peak in the 1990s, the political position of the party was unclear. However, most political scientists considered the party to be nominally right of centre. German political scientist Jürgen Wüst called the party centre-right in 1993, cited the party&#x27;s ideological proximity to the Catholic philosopher Robert Spaemann. The party repositioned itself following the electoral collapse and loss of many members in early 2000s - the party lost two-thirds of its electorate in the 2002 German federal election, and did not participate in the 2005 German federal election at all. Afterwards, the party had undergone a &quot;profound shift to the left&quot;. From 2005 onwards, the party is considered centre-left by German political scientists such as Heinz-Siegfried Strelow.

Some commentators have said that the party has moved over the years in a more liberal direction regarding some issues since the mid-2000s. In many issues it emphasizes, such as the environment and trade, it is similar to the Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens. It differs from them by being less supportive of immigration and restrictions on state powers in criminal justice issues, not focusing on gay and lesbian rights as part of its platform, and having a differing view of feminism.

It was one of the earliest supporters (since 1989) of a green tax shift, an idea which later gained broader support and has been partially implemented in Germany since the Social Democratic Party and The Greens were elected to form the Federal government in 1998.

The party is predominantly Catholic - according to a 2008 survey, 70% of the party was composed of Catholics. A majority (55%) of the party members attend religious services at least monthly, which is higher than in Christian confessional parties like the CDU and CSU. The ÖDP is influenced by Catholicism in many of its programmatic stances - it strongly opposes restricting the right to asylum, harsher criminal punishment, and abortion. Additionally, the ÖDP strongly support an extension of the German welfare state and a complete nuclear phase-out. According to Uwe Kranenpohl, the ÖDP&#x27;s opposition to abortion is even stronger than in CDU/CSU; Kranenpohl writes: 
The party is said to follow Christian values, and the German political scientist Oliver Geden described the party as &quot;left-Catholic&quot;. It is also said to be morally conservative. Following the Catholic social teaching, a central principle of the party&#x27;s program is &quot;respect for life&quot;, which is considered &quot;sacred in all its forms&quot;. This results in demands for the protection of nature and the environment and a fundamental scepticism towards &quot;artificial&quot; interventions in nature. In this, the party includes abortion, euthanasia and medical interventions to prolong life. To this end, the party opposes abortion, euthanasia and death penalty.

The party&#x27;s focus in environmentalism, which is often combined with moral conservatism - for example, its 2009 &quot;for real non-smoking protection&quot; campaign that attracted national attention condemned smoking on both environmental and moral grounds. The party proposes more restrictions and harsher persecution of violence and pornography in the media.

Economically, the party is left-wing and committed to degrowth. It focuses on sustainable economics, and calls for Germany to have 100% of its energy from renewable sources, a comprehensive &quot;mobility transition&quot; that would reduce car traffic by at least 50%, a publicly-owned national water supply, and an introduction of universal basic income for parents to cover the material costs of children. The ÖDP also calls for the immediate shutdown of nuclear power plants, appropriate housing of animals in agriculture, efforts to reduce meat consumption and the ecological restructuring of agriculture.

==Controversy==
On 17 December 2014, a member of the Memmingen/Unterallgäu chapter of the ÖDP said at a meeting, that the proposed gender mainstreaming law was a &quot;state license to corrupt children&quot; and would give LGBT individuals &quot;too much influence over a passive majority&quot;, and that LGBT individuals should not be allowed to marry. Party secretary Pablo Ziller said that the party&#x27;s federal board was &quot;disappointed&quot; at the remarks and that the statements did not represent the party&#x27;s position. According to Ziller, the party believes in extending marriage rights to same-sex couples.

==Leaders==
The current leader of the party is Charlotte Schmid. She succeeded Christian Rechholz in October 2022.

<doc id="424801" wikidata="Q974724" url="?curid=424801" title="For United Ukraine!">
<text>For United Ukraine! () was a political alliance and an electoral bloc in Ukraine founded in December 2001 to participate in the parliamentary election held on 31 March 2002.

==History==
In the parliamentary election, the party was supportive of authoritarian, incumbent President Leonid Kuchma, and opposed to the pro-democratic Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc. It was described by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as a &quot;party of power&quot;, including oligarchs, bureaucrats, and pro-Kuchma politicians, as an attempt to further increase Kuchma&#x27;s power through constitutional and extra-constitutional means. At the election, the alliance won 11.77% of the popular vote and a total of 102 out of 450 seats, placing it in third behind Our Ukraine and the Communist Party of Ukraine. Final poll results had predicted 7-8% of the total votes. The alliance received many of its votes from Donetsk Oblast.

The alliance consisted of the 5 following members:
* Party of Regions (), led by Volodymyr Semynozhenko.
* Agrarian Party of Ukraine (), led by Governor of Lviv Oblast Mykhailo Hladiy.
* Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Ukraine (, PPPU), led by Anatoliy Kinakh.
* People&#x27;s Democratic Party (), led by former Prime Minister Valeriy Pustovoitenko.
* Labour Ukraine (), led by Serhiy Tyhypko.

Top-10 party list: Volodymyr Lytvyn (non-partisan), Anatoliy Kinakh (Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Ukraine), Kateryna Vashchuk (Agrarian Party of Ukraine), Volodymyr Boyko (Party of Regions), Viktor Skopenko (Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Ukraine), Valeriy Pustovoitenko (People&#x27;s Democratic Party), Serhiy Tihipko (Labour Ukraine), Volodymyr Semynozhenko (Party of Regions), Mykhailo Hladiy (Agrarian Party of Ukraine), Heorhiy Kirpa (non-partisan).

==Since the election==
The electoral bloc disintegrated in June 2002, following the 2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election.

<doc id="424806" wikidata="Q943044" url="?curid=424806" title="1995 Quebec referendum">
<text>The 1995 Quebec referendum was the second referendum to ask voters in the predominantly French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec whether Quebec should proclaim sovereignty and become an independent country, with the condition precedent of offering a political and economic agreement to Canada.

The culmination of multiple years of debate and planning after the failure of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown constitutional accords, the referendum was launched by the provincial Parti Québécois government of Jacques Parizeau. Despite initial predictions of a heavy sovereignist defeat, an eventful and complex campaign followed, with the &quot;Yes&quot; side flourishing after being taken over by Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard.

Voting took place on 30 October 1995, and featured the largest voter turnout in Quebec&#x27;s history (93.52%). The &quot;No&quot; option carried by a margin of 54,288 votes, receiving 50.58% of the votes cast. Parizeau, who announced his pending resignation as Quebec premier the following day, later stated that he would have quickly proceeded with a unilateral declaration of independence had the result been affirmative and negotiations failed or been refused, the latter of which was later revealed as the federal position in the event of a &quot;Yes&quot; victory.

Controversies over both the provincial vote counting and direct federal financial involvement in the final days of the campaign reverberated in Canadian politics for over a decade after the referendum took place. In the aftermath of the close result, the federal government, after unilaterally recognizing Quebec as a distinct society and amending the federal constitutional veto procedure, referred the issue to the Supreme Court of Canada, which stated that the unilateral secession contemplated in the referendum was illegal.

== Background ==
Quebec, a province in Canada since its foundation in 1867, has always been the sole majority French-speaking province. Long ruled by forces (such as the Union Nationale) that focused on affirmation of the province&#x27;s Francophone and Catholic identity within Canada, the Quiet Revolution of the early 1960s prompted a surge in civic and economic nationalism, as well as voices calling for the independence of the province and the establishment of a nation state. Among these was René Lévesque, who founded the with like-minded groups seeking independence from Canada. After winning power in 1976, the PQ government held a referendum in 1980 seeking a mandate to negotiate &quot;sovereignty-association&quot; with Canada, which was decisively defeated.

In response to the referendum result, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau said that he would seek to patriate the Canadian Constitution and institute what would eventually become the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. During tense negotiations in November 1981, an agreement was reached between Trudeau and nine of the ten provincial premiers by Trudeau, but not Lévesque. The Constitution Act of 1982 was enacted without the Quebec National Assembly&#x27;s approval, after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled against the Quebec government that its consent was not necessary for constitutional change.

New Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Quebec Liberal premier Robert Bourassa sought a series of constitutional amendments designed to address Quebec&#x27;s concerns. In the Meech Lake Accord, the federal government and all provincial premiers agreed to a series of amendments that decentralized some powers and recognized Quebec as a distinct society. The Accord, after fierce debate in English Canada, fell apart in dramatic fashion in the summer of 1990, as two provinces failed to ratify it within the three-year time limit required by the constitution. This prompted outrage among Quebec nationalists and a surge in support for sovereignty. While the Accord was collapsing, Lucien Bouchard, a cabinet minister in Mulroney&#x27;s government, led a coalition of six Progressive Conservative members of parliament and one Liberal MP from Quebec to form a new federal party devoted to Quebec sovereignty, the .

Following these events, Bourassa said that a referendum would be held in 1992, with either sovereignty or a new constitutional agreement as the subject. This prompted a national referendum on the Charlottetown Accord of 1992, a series of constitutional amendments that included the proposals of the Meech Lake Accord as well as other matters. The Accord was rejected by a majority of voters both in Quebec and English Canada.

In the 1993 federal election, the Liberals returned to power with a majority government under Jean Chrétien, who had been Minister of Justice during the 1980–81 constitutional discussions and the Bloc Québécois won 54 seats with 49.3% of Quebec&#x27;s vote. The result made the Bloc the second largest party in the House of Commons, giving it the role of Official Opposition and allowing Bouchard to confront Chrétien in Question Period on a daily basis.

In Quebec, the 1994 provincial election brought the back to power, led by Jacques Parizeau. The party&#x27;s platform promised to hold a referendum on sovereignty during the first year of its term in office. The PQ won a majority government with 44.75% of the popular vote, just ahead of the Liberals&#x27; 44.4%.

== Prelude ==

In preparation for the referendum, every household in Quebec was sent a draft of the &quot;Act Respecting the Future of Quebec&quot; (also referred to as the &quot;Sovereignty Bill&quot;), with the announcement of the National Commission on the Future of Quebec to commence in February 1995. The commission was boycotted by the Liberal Party of Quebec, the Liberal Party of Canada, and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

The primary issue of debate within the sovereignty movement became on what terms sovereignty would be put before the electorate. Parizeau, long identified with the &quot;independantiste&quot; wing of the party, was opposed to the PQ&#x27;s general historical preference for an economic relationship with the rest of Canada to be offered alongside sovereignty, as he thought this would encourage the Federal government to simply refuse to negotiate and cast the project as doomed, as had happened in 1980. As a practical matter, Parizeau believed that given the emotional circumstances of separation a special partnership was unlikely, and that given free trade agreements and other multilateral institutions it was unnecessary.

Parizeau&#x27;s stance created opposition in the sovereignty movement, which coalesced around Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard. A popular and charismatic figure, Bouchard had come close to death from necrotizing fasciitis and lost his left leg. His recovery, and subsequent public appearances on crutches, provided a rallying point for sovereigntists and the public at large. Bouchard thought a proposal lacking a partnership would doom the project among soft nationalists (such as himself) who worried about the economic consequences of separation.

As polls showed Parizeau&#x27;s approach as highly unlikely to even exceed 40% support in a referendum, leaders of the movement engaged in a heated public debate. After Parizeau moved the planned referendum date to the fall, Deputy Premier Bernard Landry aroused ire by stating he would not want to be involved in a &quot;charge of the light brigade.&quot; During the Bloc&#x27;s April conference, after a speech demanding a change in direction, Bouchard expressed ambivalence to a radio show about participating if a partnership proposal was not included. Mario Dumont, leader of the new Action démocratique du Québec, also stated that he would only consider participation in the referendum if a partnership was made part of the question.

The final findings of the National Commission, issued April 19, included a statement that the public generally desired an economic partnership with Canada. Fearing Bouchard and Dumont would further dilute their position as the referendum wore on, Parizeau agreed to negotiate a broader approach, and would agree to a statement that included partnership with Dumont and Bouchard on June 12, 1995. The Agreement contained details of the partnership negotiation process, and a general plan of seeking &quot;sovereignty&quot; while requiring an economic and social partnership offer be negotiated and presented to the rest of Canada. Most importantly for Parizeau, the agreement also allowed the government to declare immediate independence if negotiations were not successful or heard after a successful referendum.

=== &quot;Bertrand v. Quebec&quot; ===
The looming referendum prompted a number of actions in the Quebec Superior Court, which were consolidated under the application of prominent lawyer Guy Bertrand. Bertrand asked for interim and permanent injunctions against the holding of the referendum. The Federal Attorney General declined to intervene, and after failing in a motion to strike the application, the Quebec Attorney General unilaterally withdrew from the hearing. The Quebec government moved the September sitting of the National Assembly two days forward to be sure that parliamentary immunity would prevent MNAs from being summoned to testify.

Justice Lesage of the Court found that secession could only legally be performed by constitutional amendment pursuant to Section V of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, and that a unilateral declaration of independence would be &quot;manifestly illegal.&quot; Lesage refused to issue an injunction to stop the referendum, as he believed that to do so could paralyze the workings of government and cause more disorder than the referendum being held. The Court opted for declaratory relief, declaring that the &quot;Sovereignty Bill&quot; and the referendum constituted a serious threat to Bertrand&#x27;s Charter rights.

Parizeau denounced the decision as undemocratic, stated that the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; did not apply to Quebec, and refused to move the referendum timetable. Quebec Attorney General Paul Bégin stated that he believed an extra-constitutional referendum was legal pursuant to international law. Quebec Liberal leader and &quot;No&quot; campaign chairman Daniel Johnson announced the following day that the ruling would not change the strategy of the &quot;No&quot; campaign. Some Federal officials questioned if their level of government could be involved after the declaration, but ultimately the Federal government decided to participate.

=== Referendum question ===
In a dramatic reading at the Grand Théâtre de Québec on September 6, the final version of the &quot;Sovereignty Bill&quot; was unveiled. The bill would be tabled in the National Assembly awaiting the result of the referendum.

The question in the 1980 referendum, in an attempt to build a broad coalition, had sought only the authority to negotiate sovereignty with the Canadian government, and promised a second referendum to ratify the results of any negotiation. Parizeau believed a second referendum was unnecessary and would only encourage the remainder of Canada to use delaying tactics. The draft initial act featured a question only asking for the authority to declare Quebec sovereign.

Pursuant to the partnership agreement with Bouchard and Dumont, the referendum question was changed to incorporate the partnership agreement. It was presented on September 7, 1995, to be voted on October 30, 1995. In English, the question on the ballot asked: 

The question came under immediate fire from federalists, who had no input in the drafting. Daniel Johnson stated it was confusing and at the very least should have contained the word &quot;country.&quot; Prominent federalists argued that the referendum question should not have mentioned &quot;partnership&quot; proposals, because no Canadian political leaders outside Quebec had shown any interest in negotiating a possible partnership agreement with an independent Quebec, and arguably no entity capable of undertaking such negotiations actually existed.

Other federalists argued that the question erroneously implied an agreement had been reached between Canada and Quebec regarding a partnership on June 12, 1995. Parizeau would later express regret that the agreement had to be cited in the question, but noted that the June 12, 1995 agreement had been sent to every registered voter in the province.

== Campaign ==

=== Participants ===

Pursuant to Quebec&#x27;s &quot;Referendum Act&quot; (enacted by the National Assembly prior to the referendum of 1980), the campaign would be conducted as a provincially governed election campaign, and all campaign spending had to be authorized and accounted for under &quot;Yes&quot; (Le Comité national du OUI) or &quot;No&quot; (Comité des Québécoises et des Québécois pour le NON) umbrella committees. Each committee had an authorized budget of $5 million. Campaign spending by any person or group other than the official committees would be illegal after the official beginning of the referendum campaign.

After the agreement of June 12, the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign would be headed by Jacques Parizeau. The official &quot;No&quot; campaign would be chaired by Liberal leader Daniel Johnson Jr.

Making matters more complex, especially for the &quot;No&quot; camp, was the federal nature of Canada. The governing Liberal Party of Canada and its leader, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien were not strongly represented in the province outside of Montreal. Chrétien&#x27;s involvement in the 1982 negotiations and his stance against the Meech Lake Accord made him unpopular with moderate francophone federalists and sovereignists, who would be the swing voters in the referendum. Lucienne Robillard, a nationalist former Bourassa-era cabinet minister, would serve as the federal Liberal representative on the &quot;No&quot; committee. Jean Charest, leader of the Federal Progressive Conservative Party, would be prominently featured, as he and the PCs had closely and productively cooperated with the Quebec Liberals in the Meech Lake negotiations.

Fearing missteps by politicians not used to Quebec that had occurred during the Meech Lake and Charlottetown debates, Johnson and the campaign heavily controlled appearances by Federal politicians, including Chrétien. Johnson bluntly banned any appearance by the Reform Party or its leader, Preston Manning. This would go unchallenged by Ottawa for the majority of the campaign, but created much frustration within the governing Liberals in Ottawa. Prominent Chrétien adviser Eddie Goldenberg believed that the &quot;No&quot; campaign at some points was more focused on the future election position of the Quebec Liberals rather than the referendum itself.

=== Early days ===
The campaign officially began on October 2, 1995, with a televised address by both leaders. Parizeau emphasized that he believed this might be the last opportunity for sovereignty for the foreseeable future, while Johnson chose to forecast the uncertainty that a &quot;Yes&quot; vote could provoke.

Johnson&#x27;s campaign focused on the practical problems created by the sovereignty process, emphasizing that an independent Quebec would be in an uncertain position regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and not be able to control the Canadian dollar. Prominent business figures such as Power Corporation president Paul Desmarais and Bombardier Inc. head Laurent Beaudoin spoke that they believed a &quot;Yes&quot; victory could spell doom for their Quebec business interests.

The initial campaign for the &quot;Yes&quot; was led by Parizeau, with Dumont campaigning separately in rural areas. In addition to the traditional themes of the movement&#x27;s appeal to Quebec nationalism, the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign attempted to highlight the slim possibility of any future reform to Canada&#x27;s federal system. Parizeau bitterly attacked business leaders for intervening in the referendum, calling it a betrayal of their Quebec customers and workers. While Parizeau&#x27;s responses were highly popular with &quot;Yes&quot; stalwarts, it was generally seen that speeches against business leaders were only highlighting the economic uncertainty that worried swing voters.

Polls in the first week were highly disappointing for the &quot;Yes&quot; camp, as they showed them behind by 5–7 percentage points among decided voters, with an even larger gap if &quot;undecided&quot; voters were weighed toward the &quot;No&quot; side as would generally be expected. Parizeau, a general fixture in Quebec politics for decades whose strong views of sovereignty were well known among the populace, was under pressure to create a spark.

=== Appointment of Bouchard ===

In an unannounced ceremony on October 7 at the Université de Montréal, Parizeau made a surprise announcement: He appointed Bouchard as &quot;chief negotiator&quot; for the partnership talks following a &quot;Yes&quot; vote. The move came as a dramatic surprise to the campaign, promoting the popular Bouchard to the fore and simultaneously emphasizing the &quot;partnership&quot; aspect of the question.

Bouchard, already popular, became a sensation: in addition to his medical struggles and charisma, his more moderate approach and prominent involvement in the Meech Lake Accord while in Ottawa reminded undecided nationalist voters of federal missteps from years past. Politicians on both sides described his appeal as messianic and almost impossible to personally attack, in contrast to the well-worn figures on both sides of the referendum. &quot;No&quot; advisor John Parisella noted that at focus groups, when presented with statements Bouchard had made that they did not like, participants would refuse to believe he meant them. New polls eventually showed a majority of Quebecers intending to vote &quot;Yes&quot;.

&quot;No&quot; forces, including Johnson, were shocked by the development, which required wholesale changes in strategy three weeks before the vote. Unwilling to believe Parizeau had given up his leadership role voluntarily, most in the &quot;No&quot; camp and Ottawa had assumed a coup had taken place, though the manoeuvre had been planned and voluntary. The dramatic events prompted many federal politicians to lobby for similarly dramatic intervention from Ottawa and the federal government, which were refused by the &quot;No&quot; committee, who believed that with Bouchard&#x27;s introduction the margin for error was dramatically reduced. The &quot;No&quot; campaign continued to focus on the economic benefits of federation.

Bouchard&#x27;s speeches asked Quebecers to vote &quot;Yes&quot; to give a clear mandate for change, and that only the clarity of a &quot;Yes&quot; vote would provide a final solution to Canada&#x27;s long-standing constitutional issues and a new partnership with English Canada for the betterment of both. Bouchard&#x27;s popularity was such that his remarks that the Québécois were the &quot;white race&quot; with the lowest rate of reproduction, which threatened to cast the project as focused on ethnic nationalism, were traversed with ease. Bloc Québécois MP Suzanne Tremblay was less successful in this regard, and apologized after answering journalist Joyce Napier&#x27;s question of how minority francophones outside of Quebec would be helped by independence by stating that Napier&#x27;s last name and lack of a Québécois accent made her ignorant of the subject.

===Midcampaign===

Pursuant to the &quot;Referendum Act&quot;, both committees were required to contribute to a brochure sent to every voter describing their positions. The official &quot;No&quot; brochure, written by the Quebec Liberals, stated that Quebec was a distinct society, and that Quebec should enjoy full autonomy in areas of provincial jurisdiction. Parizeau, while speaking in Hull, challenged Chrétien to tell voters that, if &quot;No&quot; won, Ottawa would withdraw from all provincial jurisdictions, prompting a vague response from the &quot;No&quot; campaign.

On October 21 in Longueuil, Johnson, hoping to defuse the issue, ad-libbed a challenge to Chrétien to declare his position on distinct society recognition. When presented with the request, Chrétien, in New York for a United Nations meeting, responded, &quot;No. We&#x27;re not talking about the Constitution, we&#x27;re talking about the separation of Quebec from the rest of Canada.&quot; The remarks in direct contradiction to Johnson were portrayed in the press as a blunt refusal.

Chrétien&#x27;s position was far more difficult than Johnson&#x27;s: part of the 1993 Liberal election platform had been moving the country away from large-scale constitutional debates. Provincial governments were also far more hostile to the constitutional process than they had been in the decade prior, with even the federal government&#x27;s typical ally, Ontario, being firmly against any pursuit of constitutional accommodation.

French President Jacques Chirac, while answering a call from a viewer in Montreal on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, said that, if the &quot;Yes&quot; side were successful, the fact that the referendum had succeeded would be recognized by France.

At a federalist rally of about 12,500 people which was held at the Verdun Auditorium on October 24, Chrétien introduced a focus on Quebec&#x27;s emotional attachment to Canada, promised reforms to give Quebec more power, and in a more startling announcement, declared that he would support enshrinement of Quebec as a distinct society, and that he would support reforms to the Canadian constitution. The sudden reversal of Chrétien&#x27;s long-standing position on the issue, along with Chrétien&#x27;s wan complexion and atypically nervous appearance, sparked considerable comment. Charest further emphasized his commitment to constitutional reform if a &quot;No&quot; victory was achieved.

=== Indigenous activism ===
In response to the referendum, Indigenous peoples in Quebec strongly affirmed their own right to self-determination. First Nations chiefs said that forcing their peoples to join an independent Quebec without their consent would violate international law, violating their rights to self-determination. Indigenous groups also demanded to be full participants in any new constitutional negotiations resulting from the referendum.
First Nations communities contributed significantly to the tense debate on a hypothetical partition of Quebec.

The Grand Council of the Crees in Northern Quebec was particularly vocal and prominent in its resistance to the idea of being included in an independent Quebec. Grand Chief Matthew Coon Come issued a legal paper, titled &quot;Sovereign Injustice&quot;, which sought to affirm the Cree right to self-determination in keeping their territories in Canada. On October 24, 1995, the Cree organized their own referendum, asking the question: &quot;Do you consent, as a people, that the Government of Quebec separate the James Bay Crees and Cree traditional territory from Canada in the event of a Yes vote in the Quebec referendum?&quot; 96.3% of the 77% of Crees who cast ballots voted to stay in Canada.

The Inuit of Nunavik held a similar local vote, asking voters, &quot;Do you agree that Quebec should become sovereign?&quot;, with 96% voting No.

=== 25 October 1995: Three addresses ===

Five days before the vote, United States President Bill Clinton, in response to a question asked by CBC News reporter Henry Champ, while recognizing the referendum as an internal issue of Canada, gave a minute-long statement extolling the virtues of a united Canada, ending with &quot;Canada has been a great model for the rest of the world, and has been a great partner of the United States, and I hope that can continue.&quot; While the statement provided relief in sovereignist circles for not being a stronger endorsement of the &quot;No&quot; position, the implication of Clinton, who was popular in Quebec and the leader of the province&#x27;s most important trading partner, endorsing Canadian unity had strong reverberations in the electorate.

The same night, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien gave a televised address to the nation in English and French. Broadly similar in both languages, Chrétien promoted the virtues of Canadian federalism to Quebec, touched on the shared values of the country, warned that Parizeau would use the referendum result as a mandate to declare independence from Canada (while explicitly not stating the result would be accepted), and announced that Quebec would be recognized as a distinct society and that any future constitutional reform that impacted Quebec would be made with the province&#x27;s consent.

The &quot;Yes&quot; side was provided airtime for a rebuttal in English and French. Lucien Bouchard was given the task in both languages, with the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign stating that a federal politician should give the response. Bouchard&#x27;s French address recounted the previous animosities of the constitutional debate, specifically targeting Chrétien&#x27;s career and actions, including showing a newspaper headline from the aftermath of the 1982 Constitution that featured Trudeau and Chrétien laughing. Bouchard then focused on the details of the partnership aspect of the proposal. He used his English address to ask Canadians to understand the &quot;Yes&quot; side and to announce an intention to negotiate in good faith.

The next day, Montreal radio station CKOI broadcast a prank call by radio announcer Pierre Brassard, impersonating Chrétien, to Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, asking her to make a televised address championing national unity. The Queen appeared to reluctantly agree to the request and talked to Brassard for 17 minutes before her staff identified the hoax (after a delay due to a Chrétien aide wrongly speculating to Buckingham Palace staff that it could be a genuine call).

=== Unity Rally ===
Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin, expressing anxiety to his staff about the referendum the week before, was told about a small rally planned in Place du Canada in Montreal for businesspersons on October 27. Asked by Federal advisor John Rae, Pierre Claude Nolin agreed to allow Tobin to invite Canadians outside Quebec to the rally, provided Quebec&#x27;s referendum laws were adhered to. Tobin then encouraged fellow caucus members to send as many people as possible.

After gaining permission from the Prime Minister (over the objections of Quebec members of Cabinet), Tobin then appeared on the national English-language Canada AM, and while disavowing any connection with the &quot;No&quot; organization, announced that the &quot;No&quot; side would be holding a rally in Montreal on October 27, and implored Canadians from around the country to attend the rally to support the &quot;crusade for Canada.&quot; Tobin noted that committees were being formed in Ottawa and Toronto, charter aircraft were being ordered, and that Canadian Airlines had a 90% off &quot;unity&quot; sale. Tobin proceeded to call the chairman of Air Canada in his capacity as a private citizen and suggest planes be made available at the same rate, a request that was granted.

Tobin&#x27;s Canada AM appearance resulted in calls flooding MP&#x27;s offices in English Canada, and bus companies volunteered hundreds of vehicles to take Canadians from outside of Quebec to Montreal. The rally at Place du Canada was estimated to have between 50,000 and 125,000 attendees, with estimates varying wildly as the crowd grew and shrank throughout the day. Jean Chrétien, Jean Charest and Daniel Johnson spoke to the crowd for the occasion, which would become known as the &quot;Unity Rally&quot;. Images of the large crowd with an oversized Canadian flag became iconic. Charest felt the rally helped to keep momentum for the &quot;No&quot; campaign moving.

The federal government&#x27;s intervention in the rally attracted strident protests from the &quot;Yes&quot; side, who felt the discounts and coordination were an illegal intervention in the referendum. Bouchard publicly contrasted the rally with what he believed was the inattention of English Canada to the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord. Nolin regretted granting permission for the &quot;No&quot; committee once the scale became known, and Johnson felt the rally only exacerbated tensions with regard to English Canada. Opinions on whether the rally had an impact were divided and unable to be gauged, as the rally happened while the final polls for the Monday referendum were being produced.

=== Opinion polling ===
During the campaign, polls were reported by all pollsters and press outlets with a general guideline of having undecided voters split unevenly in favour of the &quot;No&quot; side: This ranged from 2/3 to 3/4 of the undecided vote.
== Result ==
93.52% of the 5,087,009 registered Quebecers voted in the referendum, a higher turnout than any provincial or federal election in Canada&#x27;s history. The proposal of June 12, 1995 was rejected by voters, with 50.58% voting &quot;No&quot; and 49.42% voting &quot;Yes&quot;. The margin was significantly smaller than the 1980 referendum. The &quot;Yes&quot; side was the choice of French speakers by an estimated majority of about 60%. Anglophones and allophones (those who do not have English or French as a first language) voted &quot;No&quot; by a margin of 95%.

There was a majority &quot;Yes&quot; vote in 80 out of 125 National Assembly ridings. The &quot;Yes&quot; side was strongest in Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, the Gaspé, the Centre-du-Québec, and generally the suburbs of Quebec City and Montreal. While there was disappointment in the results of Montreal and the Beauce, Quebec City&#x27;s soft support for &quot;Yes&quot; was the greatest surprise for the &quot;Yes&quot; side. This prompted speculation that provincial civil servants did not want the uncertainty a &quot;Yes&quot; would bring, especially after Parizeau had promised to integrate displaced Federal civil servants in a sovereign Quebec.

The largest support for the &quot;No&quot; vote was found in Montreal, the province&#x27;s largest city; ridings in the West Island, home to a large anglophone population, voted &quot;No&quot; by margins eclipsing 80%, with some polling stations recording no &quot;Yes&quot; votes at all. The far North, the Outaouais, the Beauce, and the Eastern Townships also generally voted &quot;No&quot;.

The riding with the highest &quot;Yes&quot; result was Saguenay along the northern shore with 73.3% voting yes; The riding with the highest &quot;No&quot; result was D&#x27;Arcy-McGee in western Montreal with 96.38% voting &quot;No&quot;; The riding with the closest result was Vimont in Laval, which the &quot;Yes&quot; won by 6 votes and the highest turnout was in Marguerite-D&#x27;Youville (96.52%).


===Results by National Assembly ridings===
== Immediate responses ==
&quot;No&quot; supporters gathered at Métropolis in Montreal, where Johnson expressed hope for reconciliation in Quebec and stated he expected the federal government to pursue constitutional changes. Prime Minister Chrétien echoed similar sentiments to Johnson, and stated that he &quot;extended his hand&quot; to Quebec&#x27;s premier and government.

&quot;Yes&quot; supporters met at the on referendum night. After the result became known, Dumont and Bouchard made speeches accepting the result as part of the movement&#x27;s democratic convictions and expressing hope that a subsequent referendum would bring a &quot;Yes&quot; victory.

Jacques Parizeau, who had not prepared a concession speech, rejected one prepared by Jean-François Lisée and spoke without notes. Noting that 60% of French-speakers had voted yes, he stated that he would address French-speaking Québécois as (&quot;we&quot;), and that they had spoken clearly in favour of the &quot;Yes.&quot; He then stated that the only thing that had stopped the &quot;Yes&quot; side was &quot;money and ethnic votes&quot; () and that the next referendum would be successful with only a few more percentage points of French speakers onside. The remarks, widely lambasted in the Canadian and international press as ethnocentric, sparked surprise and anger in the &quot;Yes&quot; camp, as the movement had gone to great lengths to disown ethnic nationalism.

Bernard Landry confronted Parizeau at a Cabinet meeting the next morning about the remarks, stating that the movement &quot;had to hide its head in shame.&quot; Parizeau, after canvassing opinions, then told his Cabinet that he would resign as premier and leader of the Parti Québécois. It was later revealed that he had declared he would retire anyway if the &quot;Yes&quot; side lost, in an embargoed interview with TVA taped days before the referendum.

Six days after the referendum, André Dallaire, a &quot;Yes&quot; supporter with schizophrenia, upset at the result, broke into Chrétien&#x27;s Ottawa residence armed with a knife. Dallaire attempted to find Chrétien and kill the prime minister in his bed before being discovered by Aline Chrétien, who barricaded the bedroom door. Chrétien was unharmed, and Dallaire was eventually found not criminally responsible by reason of mental defect.

== Contingency preparation for a &quot;Yes&quot; victory ==
=== Sovereignists ===
Sovereignists believed that a &quot;Yes&quot; vote of 50% plus one vote was a binding result pursuant to the &quot;Referendum Act&quot; and the &quot;Sovereignty Bill&quot;, as well as the general international law principle of self-determination. In the event of a &quot;Yes&quot; victory, Parizeau had said he intended to return to the National Assembly of Quebec within two days of the result and seek support for a motion recognizing the result of the referendum. In a speech he had prepared in the event of a &quot;Yes&quot; victory, he said a sovereign Quebec&#x27;s first move would be to &quot;extend a hand to its Canadian neighbour&quot; in partnership pursuant to the wording of the referendum.

Parizeau&#x27;s immediate plans after the referendum relied upon what he felt would be general pressure from economic markets and the business community in English Canada to stabilize the situation as quickly as possible, which he believed would mitigate any catastrophic initial events (such as blockades) and prepare for negotiations.

Despite the prominent placement of Bouchard in the referendum campaign, Parizeau planned to retain all authority with regard to negotiations, and to appoint most members of the negotiation team if they were to occur. Parizeau also believed federalist Quebecers such as Chrétien and Charest would be quickly disregarded and replaced at negotiations by representatives from the other nine provinces. If the Federal government refused to negotiate, or if negotiations were to exceed October 30, 1996, Parizeau stated that he would proceed with a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) for an independent Quebec pursuant to Section 26 of the &quot;Sovereignty Bill&quot;.

Parizeau&#x27;s hopes for international recognition, a practical requirement of statehood, rested with France and the Francophonie. He believed that if Quebec declared independence in these circumstances, President of the French National Assembly Philippe Séguin, a powerful Gaullist power broker who was sympathetic to the sovereignty movement, would pressure President Chirac to recognize the declaration. He counted on a French recognition to spread quickly to the Francophonie and bring the issue to a head. Benoit Bouchard, Canada&#x27;s ambassador at the time, believed that the plan was irrational as he doubted Séguin, who was supposed to be a neutral figure in his role, could bring sufficient pressure in the country&#x27;s semi-presidential system.

In interviews conducted in 2014, Bouchard and Dumont both believed that negotiations would have resulted had the &quot;Yes&quot; side won and that Quebec would have remained in Canada with a more autonomous status. Bouchard, while approving of Parizeau&#x27;s intention to unilaterally declare independence should negotiations be refused, implied that he and Dumont would have been able to control negotiations and offer a subsequent referendum on a new agreement. Dumont noted that international recognition would have been difficult had two of the three leaders of the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign been against a UDI, and that he and Bouchard were willing to slow the process down if necessary. For his part, Bernard Landry believed that nothing short of a seat at the United Nations would have been accomplished had the &quot;Yes&quot; won.

=== Federalists ===

==== Recognition ====
As the referendum was only of force and effect pursuant to a provincial law, neither the provincially sanctioned &quot;No&quot; committee nor the Federal government had any input on the question of the referendum. Federalists strongly differed on how or if a &quot;Yes&quot; referendum result would be recognized. &quot;No&quot; campaign head Daniel Johnson disputed the &quot;Yes&quot; side&#x27;s position that a simple majority was sufficient to declare independence, as he believed the question was too vague and gave negotiators too broad a mandate given the enormity of the issue and the uncertainty of negotiations.

Jean Chrétien refused to publicly comment or consider contingencies regarding a possible &quot;Yes&quot; victory, and at no point stated the referendum bound the Federal government to negotiations or permitted a unilateral declaration of independence. His wording of speeches during the referendum noted that Parizeau would interpret a &quot;Yes&quot; vote as a mandate to separate Quebec from Canada, but never offered recognition that this was legal or recognizable. A speech drafted for Chrétien in the event of a &quot;Yes&quot; vote stated that the question was too ambiguous to be binding and that only dissatisfaction with the status quo had been stated.

Reform party leader Preston Manning, a prominent proponent of direct democracy, would have recognized any result, with critics suspecting he preferred a &quot;Yes&quot; vote for electoral gain. Jean Charest recognized the referendum&#x27;s legitimacy, although a draft post-referendum speech had him interpreting a &quot;Yes&quot; vote as a call for drastic reform of Canadian federation instead of separation. The New Democratic Party&#x27;s official position was that the result had to be recognized.

==== Negotiations ====
Little planning was made for the possibility of a &quot;Yes&quot; vote by the Canadian federal government, with the general consensus being that the referendum would be easily won and that planning would spark panic or give the referendum undeserved legitimacy. Some members of the federal cabinet met to discuss several possible scenarios, including referring the issue of Quebec&#x27;s independence to the Supreme Court. Senior civil servants met to consider the impact of a vote for secession on issues such as territorial boundaries and the federal debt. A dispute arose as to whether Jean Chrétien and many prominent members of Cabinet who had been elected in Quebec ridings could represent Canada at a hypothetical partnership negotiation.

Manning intended to immediately call for Chrétien&#x27;s resignation and for a general election if the referendum were successful, even though the Liberals, independently of their Quebec seats, had a sizable majority in the House of Commons. There was also some doubt that Chrétien would be able to assure the governor general that he retained enough support within his party to remain the prime minister. Chrétien&#x27;s intention was, whatever the result, to stay in office. New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna later confirmed that he had been invited into a hypothetical &quot;national unity&quot; cabinet if the &quot;Yes&quot; side was victorious, with a general understanding that former Ontario Premier Bob Rae was to be included as well.

Premier of Saskatchewan Roy Romanow secretly formed a committee to study consequences if Quebec successfully seceded, including strengthening Saskatchewan&#x27;s relationships with other western provinces, also seceding from Canada, or joining the United States.

== Controversies post-referendum ==

=== Rejected ballots ===
When the counting was completed, approximately 86,000 ballots were rejected by Deputy Returning Officers, alleging that they had not been marked properly by the voter. Each polling station featured a Deputy Returning Officer (appointed by the &quot;Yes&quot;) who counted the ballots while a Poll Clerk (appointed by the &quot;No&quot;) recorded the result of the count.

Controversy arose over whether the Deputy Returning Officers of the Chomedey, Marguerite-Bourgeois and Laurier-Dorion ridings had improperly rejected ballots. In these ridings the &quot;No&quot; vote was dominant, and the proportion of rejected ballots was 12%, 5.5% and 3.6%. Thomas Mulcair, member of the Quebec National Assembly for Chomedey, told reporters that there was &quot;an orchestrated attempt to steal the vote&quot; in his riding. A study released months after the referendum by McGill University concluded that ridings with a greater number of &quot;No&quot; votes had a higher percentage of rejected ballots. Directeur général des élections du Québec (DGEQ), Pierre F. Cote, launched an inquiry into the alleged irregularities, supervised by the Chief Justice of the Quebec Superior Court, Alan B. Gold. All ballots of the three ridings plus a sample of ballots from other ridings were examined. The inquiry concluded that some ballots had been rejected without valid reasons, but the incidents were isolated. The majority of the rejected ballots were &quot;No&quot; votes, in proportion to the majority of the valid votes in those districts.

Two Deputy Returning Officers were charged by the DGEQ with violating elections laws, but in 1996 were found not guilty (a decision upheld by the Quebec Court of Appeal), after it was found that the ballots were not rejected in a fraudulent or irregular manner, and that there was no proof of conspiracy. A Quebec Court judge acquitted a Deputy Returning Officer charged with illegally rejecting 53% of the ballots cast at his Chomedey polling district.

In 2000, the Quebec Superior Court denied an application by Alliance Quebec that attempted to force the DGEQ to give access to all 5 million ballots, ruling that the only authority that could do so expired in 1996. The referendum ballots were shredded and recycled in 2008 after appeals were exhausted. In May 2005, former PQ Cabinet minister Richard Le Hir said that the PQ coordinated the ballot rejections, which PQ officials denied.

=== Citizenship and Immigration Canada ===
Citizenship Court judges from across Canada were sent into the province to ensure as many qualified immigrants living in Quebec as possible had Canadian citizenship before the referendum, and thus were able to vote. The goal was to have 10,000 to 20,000 outstanding citizenship applications processed for residents of Quebec by mid-October. 43,855 new Quebecers obtained their Canadian citizenship during 1995, with about one quarter of these (11,429) being granted during the month of October. When confronted about the issue by a Bloc Québécois MP who suggested shortcuts were being taken to hurry citizenship applications for immigrants who would most likely vote &quot;No&quot;, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Sergio Marchi responded that this was common before provincial election campaigns in other provinces.

=== Spending limits and Option Canada ===
The Canadian Unity Council incorporated a Montreal-based lobbying group called Option Canada with the mandate to promote federalism in Quebec. Option Canada received $1.6 million in funding from the Canadian Heritage Department in 1994, $3.35 million in 1995 and $1.1 million in 1996. The Montreal Gazette reported in March 1997 that the group also had other funds from undeclared sources. A Committee to Register Voters Outside Quebec was created to help citizens who had left Quebec before the 1995 vote register on the electoral list. The Committee handed out pamphlets during the referendum, including a form to be added to the list of voters. The pamphlet gave out a toll-free number as contact information, which was the same number as the one used by the Canadian Unity Council.

After the referendum, the DSEQ filed 20 criminal charges of illegal expenditures by Option Canada and others on behalf of the &quot;No&quot; side, which were dropped after the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;Libman vs. Quebec-Attorney General&quot; ruled sections of the &quot;Referendum Act&quot; restricting third-party expenditures were unconstitutionally restrictive under the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

Aurèle Gervais, communications director for the Liberal Party of Canada, as well as the students&#x27; association at Ottawa&#x27;s Algonquin College, were charged with infractions of Quebec&#x27;s Election Act after the referendum for illegally hiring buses to bring supporters to Montreal for the rally. Environment Minister Sergio Marchi told reporters that Gervais should wear [the charges against him] like a badge of honour.&quot; Two years later, the Quebec Superior Court dismissed the charges, stating that the actions took place outside of Quebec and so the Quebec Election Act did not apply.

The DSEQ asked retired Quebec court judge Bernard Grenier in 2006 to investigate Option Canada after the publication of Normand Lester and Robin Philpot&#x27;s &quot;The Secrets of Option Canada&quot;, which alleged over $5,000,000 had been spent helping the &quot;No&quot; campaign. Grenier determined that was illegally spent by the &quot;No&quot; side during the referendum, although he drew no conclusions over the &quot;Unity Rally.&quot; Grenier said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Jean Charest or that the rally was part of a plan to sabotage the sovereigntist movement. Grenier urged Quebecers in his report to move on. The Bloc Québécois called for a federal inquiry, which did not occur.

=== Responses ===
After the referendum, the ballot for Quebec elections was redesigned to reduce the size of the space where voters could indicate their choice and the rules on allowable markings were relaxed, so that Deputy Returning Officers would have fewer grounds for rejecting ballots. The Quebec government also changed the Electoral Act so that voters would need to show a Canadian passport, Quebec driver&#x27;s licence or Quebec provincial health care card at the polling station for identification purposes in future elections.

== Aftermath ==

=== Quebec ===
Parizeau&#x27;s resignation led to Bouchard becoming the leader of the PQ and premier unopposed. While Bouchard maintained a third referendum was forthcoming provided &quot;winning conditions&quot; occurred, his government&#x27;s chief priority became reform of the Quebec economy. Daniel Johnson would resign as leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec, and after significant pressure in English Canada, Charest resigned as national PC leader and was acclaimed as leader of the Quebec Liberals.

Observers expected Bouchard to announce another sovereignty referendum if his party won the 1998 Quebec general election. While he defeated Charest, Bouchard continued his government&#x27;s focus on Quebec&#x27;s economy. Bouchard retired in 2001 and was replaced by Bernard Landry who, despite promising a more robust stance on the sovereignty issue, was ousted in the 2003 Quebec general election by Charest, who would become premier.

=== Distinct society and veto ===
After the referendum, Chrétien attempted to pursue constitutional recognition of distinct society, but was stopped by the blunt refusal of Ontario Premier Mike Harris to discuss any constitutional matters due to his perception they had dominated the country&#x27;s debates for too long. Given the impossibility of any meaningful change without Ontario&#x27;s approval, Chrétien opted to pursue unilateral federal changes to fulfill his government&#x27;s referendum commitments. This included legislation which required permission from the provinces of Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia for federal approval to be granted to any constitutional amendment, granting Quebec a &quot;de facto&quot; veto. The Federal parliament also officially recognized Quebec as a distinct society. Both changes, not being constitutional amendments, are theoretically reversible by future parliaments.

=== &quot;Plan B&quot; ===
Chrétien also pursued what he called &quot;Plan B&quot; in hopes of convincing Quebec voters that economic and legal obstacles would follow if Quebec were to declare itself sovereign; its public face would become professor Stéphane Dion. This included a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada, which followed Federal intervention post-referendum into the &quot;Bertrand&quot; case: The 1998 &quot;Reference Re Secession of Quebec&quot; stated that unilateral secession was illegal, would require a constitutional amendment, and that only a clear majority on a clear question could bring about any sort of obligation on the federal and provincial governments to negotiate secession.

After the decision, the Liberal government passed the Clarity Act, which stated that any future referendum would have to be on a &quot;clear question&quot; and that it would have to represent a &quot;clear majority&quot; for the federal Parliament to recognize its validity. Section 1(4) of the act stated that questions that provided for only a mandate for negotiation or envisioned other partnerships with Canada would be considered unclear, and thus not recognized. The National Assembly of Quebec passed Bill 99, proclaiming the right of self-determination and the right of the National Assembly to set referendum questions pursuant to the &quot;Referendum Act&quot; and to declare the winning majority in a referendum as a simple majority of 50% plus 1 vote. Bill 99&#x27;s constitutionality was litigated for 25 years, until the Quebec Court of Appeal ruled in 2021 that the law, given its general wording, was constitutional when applied within provincial jurisdiction.

=== Sponsorship scandal ===
Following the narrow victory, the Chrétien government established a Federal government funded advertising campaign to promote national symbols and sponsor hunting, fishing and other recreational events to promote Canada within Quebec. The campaign to promote use of the Canadian flag generally prompted apathy and annoyance with the electorate, while it was revealed in an Auditor General&#x27;s report of November 2003 that the sponsorship program saw a large sum of money mismanaged and sent to politically connected firms for little or no work. This eventually led to the Gomery Commission&#x27;s investigation of the Sponsorship Scandal.

<text>[[Adi (title)|Adi]] Koila Mara Nailatikau is a Fijian lawyer, who has served as a diplomat and politician. She was also First Lady of Fiji from 2009 until 2015, as the wife of Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, the President of Fiji.

== Family background ==
Arieta Koila Josephine Mara was born in 1953. Her father, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara (1920–2004), was &quot;Tui Nayau&quot; (Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands) and served as Fiji&#x27;s first Prime Minister (1967–1992, apart from a very brief interruption in 1987) and later as President (1993–2000), and was regarded as modern Fiji&#x27;s founding father. Her mother, Ro Lady Lala Mara (1931–2004), held the title of &quot;Roko Tui Dreketi,&quot; or Paramount Chief of the Burebasaga Confederacy. In 1979, during her time as student at Somerville College, Adi Koila graduated from the Oxford University Foreign Service Programme.

In 1981, Adi Koila married Ratu Epeli Nailatikau. The scion of another chiefly family, Ratu Epeli (born 1941) was appointed President of Fiji by the Military-backed regime in 2009 after a distinguished career, serving variously as Commander of the Royal Fiji Military Forces in the 1980s, High Commissioner (equivalent to an ambassador in Commonwealth countries) to the United Kingdom in the 1990s, Deputy Prime Minister in 2000 and 2001, and finally as Speaker of the House of Representatives from 2001 to 2006; The Fijian Parliament is one of the few legislative bodies in the world in which a husband and wife have had simultaneous parliamentary careers.

Adi Koila and Ratu Epeli have two children: a son, Kamisese (named after Adi Koila&#x27;s father), and a daughter, Litia.

== Career ==
After a serving as a diplomat in the 1980s and 1990s, Adi Koila was elected to the House of Representatives in 1999 as a candidate of the Christian Democratic Alliance, representing the Lau Fijian communal constituency, which had earlier been held by both her father and her brother, Ratu Finau Mara. In the coalition Cabinet that was subsequently appointed, Adi Koila became Minister of Tourism.

Adi Koila&#x27;s cabinet career was brought to a sudden end on 19 May 2000, when George Speight, an extreme Fijian nationalist who objected to the presence of Indo-Fijians in the government, seized power, kidnapping Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and most of the Cabinet, including Adi Koila, and forcing her father to resign as president. Along with her fellow hostages, Adi Koila was held captive for 56 days, although she was briefly released on 1 June to attend a funeral, on condition that she immediately rejoin the other captives. A period of political turbulence the coup. Democracy was restored in 2001, and Adi Koila was chosen by the Lau Provincial Council, on behalf of the Great Council of Chiefs, to fill one of fourteen Senate seats reserved for Fijian chiefly representatives. She played an active role as chairperson of the Senate Privileges Committee, and as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In politics, Nailatikau took a strong stand against proposals to legalise prostitution. In a Senate debate on 30 May 2003, she warned called for a tough stand against sex tourism, saying that it was a form of sexual exploitation and that it led to increasing incidents of child molestation and paedophilia. &quot;While we advertise tourism, we should also educate our people in keeping a close vigil on what is happening as the side effect of tourism,&quot; she said. Nailatikau called for &quot;maximum sentences&quot; for those facilitating such offences. Lamenting the downgrading of the marriage commitment, parental authority, and relationships between grandparents and grandchildren, she blamed the breakdown of family values for the increasing crime rate.

On 7 December 2005, Nailatikau called for the establishment of a &quot;national youth service,&quot; under the auspices of the Military, to help reduce unemployment. Young people would learn self-discipline and would be trained for careers, such as engineering, that would enable them later to contribute to society through voluntary and paid employment, the Fiji Live news service quoted her as saying.

== Post-coup controversies ==
In the aftermath of the coup that deposed her father and the government in which she was a minister, Adi Koila was an outspoken critic of the Qarase government&#x27;s handling of the prosecution of persons implicated in the rebellion, accusing it of showing lenience to its perpetrators and insensitivity to its victims. She also criticised what she sees as government efforts to foster national &quot;reconciliation&quot; without fundamentally addressing the wrongs that were committed.

=== Fiji Week (2004) ===
On 25 September 2004, Adi Koila rejected the efforts of Speight and his accomplices Ratu Timoci Silatolu and Josefa Nata to offer an apology to the parliamentarians they had held hostage in the 2000 coup. Following a supposed &quot;religious conversion&quot; experience, Speight announced in mid-2004 that he had had a change of heart about the coup and the reasons for it. Saying that she was still grieving for her parents, who died within three months of each other in 2004, Adi Koila said it was too soon for her to consider any apology from the perpetrators of the coup which deposed her father. &quot;I feel that the rule of law must be upheld,&quot; she said. &quot;I simply will not accept any apology until justice is done.&quot; Adi Koila added that her refusal to accept any political attempts at reconciliation was motivated by her belief that the &quot;culture of coups&quot; must be discouraged.

In a speech from the floor of the Senate on 22 October 2004, Adi Koila explained refusal to participate in the Fiji Week reconciliation ceremonies, also known as Reconciliation Week, by quoting her late father&#x27;s words spoken at the Lau Provincial Council in October 2000: &quot;The reconciliation that has been undertaken today will be worthless if investigations into the coup do not reveal the truth behind the staging.&quot;

Adi Koila expressed anger that Simione Kaitani (whom she accused of making speeches against her father inside the parliamentary complex during the coup) and Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu (whom she accused of having ordered the burning of a property owned by her father, the Matailakeba Cane Farm in Seaqaqa, on 29 July 2000) both now held Cabinet positions, and that former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka and former Police Commissioner Isikia Savua, both of whom her late father had accused of involvement in the coup, now either occupied or had been nominated for senior diplomatic posts.

Adi Koila wondered aloud why the government had decided to organise the reconciliation ceremonies only after both of her parents had died. &quot;Why was the concept of reconciliation never done for the late Turaga Bale the Tui Nayau (Ratu Mara) or for that matter the late Marama Bale the Roko Tui Dreketi (Ro Adi Lala Mara)?&quot; she demanded. &quot;Was all this conjured overnight immediately after their demise?&quot; she questioned.

Adi Koila said she was baffled that in the reconciliation ceremonies, the apology was offered, not to the victims of the 2000 coup, but to President Iloilo and Prime Minister Qarase, who she said were the principal beneficiaries of the coup. &quot;&quot;Because if it were not for the coup they would not be in those positions as the Turaga Bale the Tui Nayau would still be the President and Mr Chaudhry Prime Minister. &quot;More so, if it were not for the coup my parents would still be alive today,&quot;&quot; she said. Ratu Mara&#x27;s health had deteriorated following his overthrow, leading to his death in May 2004; Adi Lala had died three months later.

Clarifying her remarks of a further Senate speech on 29 October, Adi Koila reiterated that the reconciliation ceremony was inappropriate because the person who received the whale&#x27;s tooth and forgave the people in the ceremony at Albert Park had not been a victim of the May 2000 coup.

Adi Koila repeated that there could be no genuine forgiveness until questions were answered about who was involved in organising and funding the 2000 coup. &quot;An individual will forgive when he or she is ready. There must be truth telling, as to why they participated and who gave the orders,&quot; Adi Koila said. &quot;Reconciliation cannot eventuate or materialise until the proper legal procedures have been followed, that is without interference from external forces.&quot;

Rejecting the criticism, the Prime Minister&#x27;s spokesman Joji Kotobalavu retaliated by accusing Adi Koila&#x27;s father, Ratu Mara, of having benefited from the 1987 coups. He went on to say that the Prime Minister had not benefited from the coup because he had quit a lucrative career in the private sector to &quot;rescue a Fiji in turmoil.&quot; He did not address Adi Koila&#x27;s charge that the present government is full of individuals who were involved in the 2000 coup. Simione Kaitani, one of those implicated, accused Adi Koila of &quot;crying over spilt milk,&quot; and insisted that there was &quot;no truth at all&quot; in her accusations against him. He added only God knew why her parents died.

=== Reconciliation and Unity Commission ===
Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase announced on 4 May 2005 that a Reconciliation and Unity Commission would be set up, empowered to recommend amnesty to persons convicted of coup-related offence, provided that their motive had been &quot;political&quot; rather than &quot;criminal,&quot; and to recommend compensation for &quot;deserving&quot; victims. On 7 May, Adi Koila joined Opposition Leader and former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, United Peoples Party leader Mick Beddoes, and National Alliance Party president Ratu Epeli Ganilau in opposing the commission and its purpose. She asserted that if her father were alive, he would have insisted on the rule of law, adding that there could be no reconciliation outside of the courts. Unless all of the perpetrators were put on trial, she said, &quot;Fiji cannot put to rest the ghosts of the coup.&quot;

She renewed her attack on both the legislation and the government promoting it on 20 July, saying it appeared that the government was incapable of functioning without the perpetrators of the coup, and that the legislation was biased in favour of coup perpetrators rather than victims. &quot;The Bill is slanted towards the perpetrators of the coup and not the victims ... This Bill is lenient towards the perpetrators while the victims get nothing,&quot; she said. She accused the government of neglecting what she saw as far more important issues, like squatters, unemployment, poverty, and road conditions, in favour of the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill.

In a further statement on behalf of the family on 24 July, she again condemned the bill, saying that it amounted to supporting the overthrow of her father. She said that her father had championed unity, tolerance, peaceful coexistence, and the rule of law, which this legislation undermined, going against everything he had believed in. &quot;I recall what the late Tui Nayau said at his last Lau Provincial Council meeting on Ono, Lau, in October 2000: &#x27;There can be no reconciliation or peace until the coup investigations are completed and the rule of law is upheld&#x27;,&quot; she said.

Nailatikau said that some government authorities, who she said were &quot;hell-bent&quot; on promoting the amnesty clauses of the legislation, were creating the impression that there was some connection between the coup perpetrators and themselves. She demanded to know what the connection was.

In the same statement, Nailatikau spoke highly of Military commander Frank Bainimarama (q.v.), a strident opponent of the legislation who threatened to depose the present government if the bill were to be passed. &quot;The commander is doing a wonderful job because he is not only speaking in his personal capacity as Commander. He is speaking as the Commander of the Fiji battalion in Fiji and those serving overseas, and he has the support of the silent majority,&quot; she said.

Following the decision of the Lau Provincial Council on 25 July to endorse the bill, Nailatikau was too disappointed to speak the media.

== 2006 candidate? ==
It was reported on 15 June 2005 that Nailatikau was considering giving up her Senate seat to run for her old Lau Fijian Communal Constituency. She confirmed that the chiefly Vuanirewa clan, of which her late father was Paramount Chief, had asked her to stand as their candidate, but said that she would not make a final decision till August, when a one-year period of mourning for her late mother was due to end. She said she would consult her brothers before announcing any decision. Nailatikau did not indicate which political party, if any, she intended to join. Her former party, the Christian Democratic Alliance, was by now defunct, and she had relatives and in-laws in a number of different parties.

As the election, which was held on 6–13 May 2006 drew close, she indicated a wish to contest the Lami Open Constituency for the National Alliance Party (NAPF), led by her brother-in-law, Ratu Epeli Ganilau, but withdrew in favour of Ben Padarath, who had already been selected. Ratu Jioji Uluinakauvadra offered to withdraw his candidacy for the Nasinu Urban Fijian Communal Constituency in her favour, but she declined the offer, the Fiji Live news service reported on 8 April. She continued to campaign for the NAPF, however. Following the election, the Lau Provincial Council and the Great Council of Chiefs reappointed her to the Senate. There was speculation in July 2006 that she might resign to join her husband, who had been offered a diplomatic post, but that did not eventuate.

<text>The Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc (, Russian: Блок Наша Украина – Народная Самооборона, &quot;Blok Nasha Ukraina – Narodnaya Samooborona,&quot; NUNS; until 2007 named Our Ukraine Bloc) was an electoral alliance active in Ukraine from 2001 until 2012, associated with former President Viktor Yushchenko. Since 2005, the bloc had been dominated by a core consisting of the People&#x27;s Union &quot;Our Ukraine&quot; party and five smaller partner parties. On 17 November 2011, the Ukrainian Parliament approved an election law that banned the participation of blocs of political parties in parliamentary elections. Since then several members of the Bloc have since merged with other parties.

The Our Ukraine Bloc was most closely associated with the Orange Revolution and continued to use orange as its political colour even after the Orange Revolution had ended. In July 2007, the old Our Ukraine bloc was reorganized into the Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc for the 2007 parliamentary election in September 2007.

==History==
The original Our Ukraine Bloc formed in Kyiv, Ukraine in 2001 in preparation for the 2002 parliamentary elections as the Electoral Bloc of Viktor Yushchenko &quot;Our Ukraine&quot;. At the time of its formation Viktor Yushchenko led the bloc. Over years the alliance changed its name, becoming:

* in 2002: Bloc of Viktor Yushchenko &quot;Our Ukraine&quot; (BVYNU)
* in 2006: the Our Ukraine Bloc (BNU)
* in 2007: the Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc (BNU-NS)

===Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2002===

At the 2002 legislative elections, won 23.6% of the popular vote and 112 out of 450 seats. It was the first time when Communists failed to take the first place in vote. Final poll results in 2002 had predicted the bloc to win 27-28% of the total votes.
The alliance included the following parties:
;Top 10 members
In September 2002, the bloc was negotiating with nine pro-presidential (Kuchma) factions to form a coalition, a draft of a coalition agreement prepared by Our Ukraine faction member Yuri Kostenko and Labor Ukraine leader Serhiy Tyhypko was received by all faction leaders on 20 September 2009 (except by the leaders of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, the Communist Party and the Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko). However the coalition never materialised.

Between 2002 and 2004, the parliamentary faction of the bloc gradually lost members and by September 2005 it had 44 members (in May 2002 this number had been 119).

===Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006===
During the election campaign some Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc members suspected Our Ukraine to be responsible for leaflets aimed against Yulia Tymoshenko, like fake invitations to celebrate her birthday at McDonald&#x27;s.

The &quot;Our Ukraine&quot; bloc was soundly defeated in the 2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election with only 13,95% of the recorded vote and came in third place behind the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc- 22% and 156 seats, and the Party of Regions-33% and 175 seats. It won 81 out of 450 seats.

The alliance included the following parties:

*People&#x27;s Union Our Ukraine (40)
*Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Ukraine (7)
*People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine (10)
*Christian Democratic Union (3)
*Ukrainian Republican Party Assembly (3)
*Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (3)
*Unaffiliated members (15)

Following the elections there has been calls for Ukraine&#x27;s President Viktor Yushchenko who was closely aligned and spokesperson for Our Ukraine during the March Parliamentary election to resign from Our Ukraine and to stand independent.

Initially the Our Ukraine Bloc intended to join the Alliance of National Unity coalition and five of its ministers where initially appointed into the Cabinet of Ministers; Justice Minister Roman Zvarych, Family and Sports Minister Yuriy Pavlenko, Emergency Situations Minister Viktor Baloha, Culture Minister Ihor Likhovyy, and Health Minister Yuriy Polyachenko. Only 30 of the 80 deputies from Our Ukraine Bloc voted for approval of this Cabinet on 10 August 2006. However Our Ukraine Bloc did not join the coalition and it wanted the Communist Party to leave the coalition before they would enter it. Meanwhile, several parties member of the Bloc announced they would go into opposition and would never join the coalition. By November 2006 the five Our Ukraine Bloc ministers where dismissed by parliament or withdrawn by Our Ukraine Bloc.

===Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007===

On 5 July 2007, 10 parties signed up to form the Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc for the 2007 parliamentary election in September 2007. The Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists refused to join the Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc in August 2007 and instead did not run in the elections.

In these elections the Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc came third, after the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc and the Party of Regions. Our Ukraine-People&#x27;s Self Defense bloc won 72 seats and received 14.16% of the vote, 236,964 fewer votes in 2007 than the Our Ukraine bloc received in 2006, representing an overall swing of +0.20%.

The alliance included the following parties:
On 15 October 2007, despite the Party of Regions gaining the most seats of all participating political parties, Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc agreed to form a majority coalition in the new parliament of the 6th convocation. On 29 November, a coalition was signed between the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc and Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc (representing 45% of the national vote). On 18 December 2007, Yulia Tymoshenko, with a margin of two votes, was elected Prime Minister.

The member parties had planned to merge into a single party in December 2007, but on 16 November 2007 People’s Self-Defense decided to end its participation in the process of forming a united party since then that process remained unclear.

===Disintegration and creation of United Centre===
In February 2008, several prominent members resigned from the party. Viktor Baloha, Head of the President&#x27;s Secretariat resigned on 15 February (to lift the issue of the correlation between the authorities as the President’s Chief of Staff and as a member of the OU-PSD presidium). Roman Bezsmertny, high ranked party official, along with people’s deputies, Mykhaylo Polyanchych, Ihor Kryl, Viktor Topolov, Oksana Bilozir and Vasyl Petevka resigned on 20 February, in a joint statement the declared that: &quot;some of the leaders of the party play their own game, coming from personal interests and it has nothing to do with responsibility, pluralism and norms of democracy.&quot; Some of them formed United Centre who wanted to participate in the next parliamentary election independently. One of the main goals at the time was: &quot;assisting President Viktor Yuschenko to realize its program of actions&quot;.

===2008 Ukrainian political crisis===

On 21 October 2008, the presidium of People’s Union Our Ukraine party decided not to team up with any other party for the upcoming snap parliamentary poll and called the idea of teaming up with United Center Party &quot;impossible&quot;. According to UNIAN the People’s Union Our Ukraine and United Centre parties will carry out a unifying congress on 17 January 2009. The People’s Democratic party may join the move.

On 23 October the Christian Democratic Union left the alliance and became part of the Leonid Chernovetskyi Bloc.

After a coalition was formed mid-December 2008 between Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc (OU-OSD), Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko (BYuT) and Lytvyn Bloc (LB) Yushchenko told journalists: &quot;The fact is that the so-called coalition was formed on basis of political corruption, this coalition will be able to work only if the Communist Party will join it. Speaking about such a type of coalition, it is even more shameful.&quot; Victor Yushchenko also stated that Yulia Tymoshenko&#x27;s desire to keep the Prime Minister&#x27;s job was the main motive for creating the coalition and that he wanted to expel the Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc lawmakers who supported the creating of the OU-PSD, BYuT and LB coalition from the list of members of parliament. According to the President Our Ukraine decided earlier at a party confession that it was impossible to resume its coalition with BYuT. Yuschenko described this as &quot;a positive process, a process of purification. I have long waited that our people decide on their political choice, on their place in the party. They have made their choice, and I respect it&quot;.

===Viktor Yanukovych presidency===
During the January 2010 presidential election some bloc members did not endorse the bloc leader Viktor Yushchenko: the Christian Democratic Union, the European Party of Ukraine, the Civil Movement &quot;People&#x27;s Self-Defense&quot; and Forward, Ukraine! endorsed Yulia Tymoshenko.

Early in March 2010, 37 (of the 55) Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc faction members had voted for the continuation of the Second Tymoshenko Government coalition. The faction did reserve the right to negotiate a possible majority coalition with other parliamentary factions apart from the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc; according to faction leader Mykola Martynenko the faction had offered to appoint its representative to the post of prime minister to prevent the concentration of power in one pair of hands and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc faction had flatly refused to surrender the post of prime minister.

On 11 March 2010 the Our Ukraine- People&#x27;s Self Defense faction officially announced that it would be in opposition to the newly formed coalition. Martynenko stated the faction &quot;did not intend &#x27;to play under a scenario,&#x27; which proposes changes to the law on the regulations amending a procedure for the creation of the coalition&quot;.

On 12 May 2010 the parliamentary faction officially went into opposition.

The Our Ukraine - People&#x27;s Self-Defense faction wanted to expel its seven members who backed ratification of the 2010 Ukrainian–Russian Naval Base for Natural Gas treaty in May 2010. In October 2010 one deputy of the Our Ukraine - People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc faction joined the Lytvyn Bloc faction.

Twelve parliamentarians were expelled from the fraction in September 2011 for joining the governing coalition and/or for voting for the 2010 Ukrainian–Russian Natural Gas treaty. However, since only one of those twelve left the faction when Oleksandr Omelchenko left voluntary. Also in September, faction leader Mykola Martynenko joined the Front of Changes.

===Dissolution===
On 17 November 2011 the Ukrainian Parliament approved an election law that banned the participation of blocs of political parties in parliamentary elections. Therefore, the bloc could not participate in the 2012 parliamentary election. Our Ukraine and Ukrainian People&#x27;s Party, Ukrainian Republican Party &quot;Sobor&quot; and People&#x27;s Self-Defense Political Party (formally Forward, Ukraine!) have since merged with other parties. The People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine campaigned on one single party list during the 2012 parliamentary elections with (among others) former members of the Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko - the All-Ukrainian Union &quot;Fatherland&quot; and the Reforms and Order Party.

The core party of the alliance, the People&#x27;s Union &quot;Our Ukraine&quot;, teamed up with the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists and with the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Party in the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election. Former leader of Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc Viktor Yushchenko headed this election list. In these election this combination won 1.11% of the national votes and no constituencies and thus failed to win parliamentary representation.

By late November 2012 the Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc faction consisted of 63 lawmakers of the original 72 elected in September 2007.

<text>The Bavaria Party (, BP) is an autonomist, regionalist and conservative political party in the state of Bavaria, Germany. The party was founded in 1946, describes itself as patriotic Bavarian and advocates Bavarian independence within the European Union. Together with the Christian Social Union (CSU), it can be seen as an heir to the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party (BVP) which existed prior to the Nazi takeover. The party is a member of the European Free Alliance.

== History ==
The party had some successes at the polls in the late 1940s and 1950s: 20.9% of the votes in Bavaria in 1949 and 17 seats in the German Bundestag and, in 1950, 17.9% and 39 seats in the Bavarian state parliament where in 1954 it formed a coalition with the Bavarian branches of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP). This forced the Christian Social Union (CSU) out of power for three years. 

Later, mainly caused by the casino affair, which was influenced by the CSU and its general secretary Friedrich Zimmermann, the Bavaria Party rapidly lost voters. It still exists but was last elected to the Bavarian state parliament in 1962.

In the 2008 local elections, however, the party won 50 seats (compared to 32 in 2002), mostly in Upper Bavaria, including one of the 80 seats in the City Council of Munich, the capital of Bavaria, after 42 years of absence there. The Bavaria Party won one seat in the District Parliament of Upper Bavaria.

== Chairman ==

The current chairman of the party is Florian Weber from Bad Aibling in Upper Bavaria.

== Elections ==
In the 2018 elections for the Bavarian Parliament the BP reached 1.7% of the voters&#x27; share. In 2013 they had gained 2.1%, the best result for the Bavaria Party since 1966.

After the elections of 2018, the Bavaria Party is represented in three administrative regions of Bavaria:

*Upper Bavaria: 2 seats (2013: 3)
*Lower Bavaria: 1 seat (2013: 1)
*Swabia (Bavaria): 1 seat (2013: 1)

<doc id="424819" wikidata="Q6956043" url="?curid=424819" title="New York Central Hudson">
<text>The New York Central Hudson was a popular 4-6-4 &quot;Hudson&quot; type steam locomotive built by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO), Baldwin Locomotive Works and the Lima Locomotive Works in three series from 1927 to 1938 for the New York Central Railroad. Named after the Hudson River, the 4-6-4 wheel arrangement came to be known as the &quot;Hudson&quot; type in the United States, as these locomotives were the first examples built and used in North America. Built for high-speed passenger train work, the Hudson locomotives were famously known for hauling the New York Central&#x27;s crack passenger trains, such as the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; and the &quot;Empire State Express&quot;. 

With the onset of diesel locomotives by the mid-20th Century, all Hudson locomotives were retired and subsequently scrapped by 1957, except for the tender from J-1d 5313, which is preserved at the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

==History==
===Background===
The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) was the first to design a 4-6-4 locomotive (naming them &quot;Baltics&quot;); however, they were not built until after the New York Central&#x27;s &quot;Hudsons&quot;. NYC President Patrick E. Crowley named the units &quot;Hudsons&quot; after the Hudson River, which divides New York State&#x27;s Hudson Valley and streams broadly past New York City.

The Hudson came into being because the existing 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot; power was not able to keep up with the demands of longer, heavier trains and higher speeds. Given NYC&#x27;s axle load limits, &quot;Pacifics&quot; could not be made any larger; a new locomotive type would be required to carry the larger boilers. Lima Locomotive Works&#x27; conception of superpower steam as realized in the 2-8-4 &quot;Berkshire&quot; type was the predecessor to the &quot;Hudson&quot;. The 2-8-4&#x27;s 4-wheel trailing truck permitted a huge firebox to be located after the boiler. The resulting greater steaming rate ensured that such a locomotive would never run out of power at speed, a common failing of older locomotives. Applying the ideas of the freight-minded Berkshire type to the &quot;Pacific&quot; resulted in a 4-6-4 locomotive.

NYC ordered prototype No. 5200 from Alco, and subjected it to intensive testing. A fleet of 205 J-1 class &quot;Hudsons&quot; were eventually built, including 30 each for the Michigan Central Railroad (MC road numbers 8200-8229) and the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Railway (&quot;Big Four&quot; - road numbers 6600-6629). In addition, NYC subsidiary Boston &amp; Albany Railroad ordered 20 J-2 class (B&amp;A road numbers 600-619), the latter 10 from Lima Locomotive Works (all other NYC Hudsons were built by Alco&#x27;s Schenectady works). A later development were 50 J-3a class &quot;Super Hudson&quot;s in 1937–1938, with many modern appliances and innovations. After the MC, Big 4, and B&amp;A locomotives were incorporated into the NYC numbering, the NYC Hudson locomotives had road numbers ranging from 5200 to 5474. The NYC J-1 road numbers were 5200-5344, the MC J-1s became NYC 5345-5374, the Big 4 J-1s became NYC 5375-5404, the J-2s (all from B&amp;A) became NYC road numbers 5455-5474, and the J-3 road numbers were 5405-5454. The J-2 numbers are last because they were transferred to the NYC after the J-3 deliveries.

===Streamlining===

The &quot;Hudsons&quot; were of excellent quality. In response to the styling sensation of the new diesel-powered &quot;Zephyr&quot; streamliner, Locomotive No. 5344 (the last J-1e) was fitted with an Art Deco streamlined shroud designed by Carl F. Kantola and was named &quot;Commodore Vanderbilt&quot; on December 27, 1934. The streamlining was later replaced to match the last ten J-3a &quot;Super Hudson&quot; locomotives (5445-5454) that had been built with streamlining designed by Henry Dreyfuss. J-1e Hudson #5344 stuck out from the rest of the roster, as it was the only J-1 to be streamlined, and was one of two locomotives ever to be streamlined twice (the other being a Baltimore and Ohio P-7, number 5304). Two more J-3a locomotives (5426 &amp; 5429) had a 3rd streamlining style fitted in 1941 for &quot;Empire State Express&quot; service. The streamlined locomotives featured prominently in NYC advertising.

The forte of all &quot;Hudsons&quot; was power at top speed. They were poor performers at low speed and the presence of a booster engine on the trailing truck was an absolute necessity for starting. For this reason, they were generally favored by railroads with flat terrain and straight routes. After the NYC, the Milwaukee Road was also fond of the &quot;Hudsons&quot;, acquiring 22 class F6 and six streamlined class F7s. The Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway also had 16, while the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad had 10 (#1400-1409) streamlined I-5 4-6-4s built by Baldwin in 1937 (nicknamed &quot;Shoreliners&quot;). Few railroads with hilly terrain acquired any.

A booster was prone to troubles, however, and gradually fell out of favor. Instead of a complicated booster, it was deemed preferential to have an extra pair of driving wheels, and thus better traction.

On September 7, 1943, No. 5450 suffered a boiler explosion in Canastota, New York, killing three enginemen and putting it out of service until the end of World War II due to a steel shortage.

Trials of later, dual-purpose 4-8-2 &quot;Mohawks&quot; sealed the &quot;Hudson&quot;″s fate. The L-3 and L-4 &quot;Mohawks&quot; were excellent, but they were still more suited to lower-speed hauling than high-speed power. In 1944, NYC received permission from the War Production Board to build a new, high-speed locomotive of the 4-8-4 type, combining all the advantages of the &quot;Hudson&quot; with those of the &quot;Mohawk&quot;. Many other railroads had taken to the 4-8-4 in the 1930s, generally calling them &quot;Northerns&quot; after the Northern Pacific Railway, which had first adopted them. By being a late adopter, the NYC had the chance to build on everyone else&#x27;s experience. That locomotive proved to be exceptional, and the type on the NYC was named the &quot;Niagara&quot;. Since only 27 were built, however, they only took over the heaviest and most-prestigious trains, and the last Niagara (No. 6015) was retired in July, 1956. Many &quot;Hudsons&quot; soldiered-on until the end of steam on NYC in 1957.

===Fate===
When the railroad dieselized, all of the &quot;Hudsons&quot; were scrapped; none were preserved. This was caused by the direct order of then-NYC president Alfred E. Perlman, albeit not completely due to opposing preservation. The financial situation of the New York Central was critical when Perlman became the chairman, and the scrap value of all the steam locomotives was enough to bring the railroad back from the brink. His decision to scrap the entirety of the NYC&#x27;s steam fleet (and later those of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western&#x27;s standard gauge) has earned him an infamous reputation as a steam hater and anti-preservationist. However, he &quot;did&quot; personally donate Mohawk-type #2933 and 4-4-0 #999.

Two J-1d class Hudsons, numbers 5311 and 5313, were sold to the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway in 1948 and were renumbered 501 and 502 respectively. Both locomotives were retired and scrapped in 1954 when the TH&amp;B dieselized. The tender from the 502 (formerly the 5313) was retained by the TH&amp;B and converted to a steam generator car for use on passenger trains. The generator car still survives today and is part of the Steamtown National Historic Site collection.

<doc id="424822" wikidata="Q5595619" url="?curid=424822" title="Granfalloon">
<text>A granfalloon, in the fictional religion of Bokononism (created by Kurt Vonnegut in his 1963 novel &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;), is defined as a &quot;false karass&quot;. That is, it is a group of people who affect a shared identity or purpose, but whose mutual association is meaningless.

As quoted in &quot;And So It Goes: Kurt Vonnegut: A Life&quot; (2011) by Charles J. Shields, Vonnegut writes in his introduction to his book &quot;Wampeters, Foma and Granfalloons&quot; (1974) that a &quot;granfalloon is a proud and meaningless collection of human beings&quot;; Shields also comments that in the same book, Vonnegut later cites the demonym of &#x27;Hoosiers&#x27; as &quot;one of [Vonnegut&#x27;s] favorite examples&quot; of what the term embodies. Another example of a granfalloon given in &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; is &#x27;alumni of Cornell University&#x27;. Kurt Vonnegut himself was born in Indiana and attended Cornell University.

==Examples==
The most commonly purported granfalloons are associations and societies based on a shared but ultimately fabricated premise. Examples from &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; include: &quot;the Communist Party, the Daughters of the American Revolution, the General Electric Company—and any nation, anytime, anywhere.&quot; A more general and oft-cited quote defines a granfalloon as &quot;a proud and meaningless association of human beings.&quot; Other examples of &quot;granfalloons&quot; cited in the novel include Hoosiers, which included the fictional narrator (and Vonnegut himself); and Cornellians (those who attended Cornell University)—which also included the fictional narrator and Vonnegut himself.
If you wish to examine a granfalloon, just remove the skin of a toy balloon. — Bokonon
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;My God,&quot; she said, &quot;are you a Hoosier?&quot;
I admitted I was.
&quot;I&#x27;m a Hoosier, too,&quot; she crowed. &quot;Nobody has to be ashamed of being a Hoosier.&quot;&quot;
&quot;I&#x27;m not,&quot; I said. &quot;I never knew anybody who was.&quot;
– Kurt Vonnegut, &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;His gaze lit on Newt again. &quot;You go to college?&quot;
&quot;Cornell,&quot; said Newt.
&quot;Cornell!&quot; cried Crosby gladly. &quot;My God, I went to Cornell.&quot;
&quot;So did he.&quot; Newt nodded at me.
&quot;Three Cornellians – all in the same plane!&quot; said Crosby, and we had another granfalloon festival on our hands.
– Kurt Vonnegut, &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
They had found a can of white paint, and on the front doors of the cab Frank had painted white stars, and on the roof he had painted the letters of a granfalloon: U.S.A.
– Kurt Vonnegut, &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;In the English translations of the several entries of the popular video game series &quot;Castlevania&quot;, the name Granfalloon has been used as an alternate name to represent the Judeo-Christian demon Legion. Particularly noted in &quot;&quot; as a mass of living corpses whom the protagonist Alucard, son of Dracula, fights against as one of the game&#x27;s many bosses. Series director Koji Igarashi (a.k.a. Iga) is a noted fan of Kurt Vonnegut and selected this alternate name for Legion, as he believed the Vonnegut concept to be a perfect representation for that boss.

==Granfalloon technique==

The granfalloon technique is a method of persuasion in which individuals are encouraged to identify with a particular granfalloon or social group. The pressure to identify with a group is meant as a method of securing the individual&#x27;s loyalty and commitment through adoption of the group&#x27;s symbols, rituals, and beliefs.

In social psychology, the concept stems from research by the Polish social psychologist Henri Tajfel, whose findings have come to be known as the minimal group paradigm. In his research, Tajfel found that strangers would form groups on the basis of completely inconsequential criteria.

In one study, Tajfel subjects were asked to watch a coin toss. They were then designated to a particular group based on whether the coin landed on heads or tails. The subjects placed in groups based on such meaningless associations between them have consistently been found to &quot;act as if those sharing the meaningless labels were kin or close friends.&quot;

Researchers since Tajfel have made strides into unraveling the mystery behind this phenomenon. Today it is broken down into two basic psychological processes, one cognitive and one motivational.

First, knowing that one is a part of this group is used to make sense of the world. When one associates with a particular group, those in the group focus on the similarities between the members. However, for people not in the group, or &quot;outsiders,&quot; differences are focused upon and often exaggerated. A problem with the granfalloon is that it often leads to in-group, out-group bias.

Second, social groups provide a source of self-esteem and pride, a form of reverse Groucho Marxism as in his famous remark &quot;I don&#x27;t care to belong to any club that would have me as a member.&quot;

The imagined communities of Benedict Anderson form a similar concept. Therapist Grant Devilly considers that granfalloons are one explanation for how pseudoscientific topics are promoted.

<doc id="424824" wikidata="Q843491" url="?curid=424824" title="Makiko Esumi">
<text>(born 18 December 1966 in Izumo, Shimane Prefecture, Japan) is a former Japanese model, actress, writer, essayist, and lyricist. Esumi is most well known for her role as Chinatsu Tsuboi in the Japanese television drama series &quot;Shomuni&quot;.

Esumi won the 1995 Rookie of the Year Award at both the 19th Annual Japan Academy Prize ceremonies and at the 38th Blue Ribbon Awards for her role in the 1995 film &quot;Maborosi&quot;. She was nominated in 2002 for the Best Actress Award at the 26th Annual Japan Academy Prize ceremonies for her role in &quot;Inochi&quot;.

In 2000, she released her single, &quot;One Way Drive&quot;, featuring guitar work and production by Tomoyasu Hotei, who also co-wrote the song with Esumi. She wrote a children&#x27;s book in 2005.

Esumi is married to Fuji TV director Shin Hirano and is distantly related to Koji Ezumi, a goalkeeper for Omiya Ardija. She was previously married to photographer Rowland Kirishima. She gave birth in 2005 to her first daughter, with her second due to be born in December 2009.

She is represented by the talent management firm Ken-On.

==Biography==
While a high school student, Esumi worked as a miko at Izumo-taisha. After graduating from high school, she signed with the Japan Tobacco Women&#x27;s Volleyball team (now the JT Marvelous in the V.League). She was injured in 1989 while playing and decided to pursue a career in show business after watching actress and singer Miki Imai on television while recovering in the hospital. She then focused on a career as a fashion model.

In 1995, Esumi made her acting debut as Yumiko in &quot;Maborosi&quot;, a film directed by Hirokazu Koreeda. Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave her acting high praise, describing it as &quot;extraordinary&quot; and stating she played the role with &quot;delicacy and physical grace&quot;. Esumi won the Rookie of the Year Award at both the 19th Annual Japan Academy Prize ceremonies and at the 38th Blue Ribbon Awards for her role in &quot;Maborosi&quot;. Esumi married photographer Rowland Kirishima in February 1996, though they divorced only nine months later.

She is probably best known for her leading role as the rebellious office lady Tsuboi Chinatsu in the &quot;Shomuni&quot; series of TV dramas, the first of which aired on Fuji TV from April to July 1998. A second series aired from April to June 2000, with a third airing from July to September 2002. Several specials were also produced. Esumi made her singing debut on 26 April 2000 with the release of her &quot;One Way Drive&quot; single. The title song was used as the ending theme to the second &quot;Shomuni&quot; series, with the lyrics by Esumi and the music by guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei.

Esumi was described as &quot;stunning&quot; in her lead role of Stray Cat in the 2001 &quot;Pistol Opera&quot;, one of Seijun Suzuki last films.

She was nominated in 2002 for the Best Actress Award at the 26th Annual Japan Academy Prize ceremonies for her role in &quot;Inochi&quot;.

Esumi and Fuji TV director Shin Hirano were married in 2003. That same year, she began appearing in Japanese government television and print advertisements encouraging the public to make their pension contributions, but started a small scandal in 2004 when it was reported that she was not making those same pension contributions herself. She stated that she thought she had been making the payments, and then corrected the issue by becoming current on her contributions. Esumi&#x27;s image was removed from the ads at the direction of the Social Insurance Agency after the scandal broke.

Her eldest daughter was born in February 2005, and a second daughter was announced in July 2009 as due to be born in December. Esumi wrote a personal note about this announcement which her talent agency subsequently published on their site.

In a 20 May 2007 article in the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;, Esumi revealed that her younger brother had died at the age of 36 the previous May of complications due to cancer.

<doc id="424825" wikidata="Q2479228" url="?curid=424825" title="English Democrats">
<text>The English Democrats are a right-wing-to-far-right, English nationalist political party active in England. A minor party, it currently has no elected representatives at any level of government.

The English Democrats were established in 2002 by members of the Campaign for an English Parliament pressure group. Following growing political devolution in the United Kingdom, which had seen the creation of the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly, the party&#x27;s founders called for a separate English Parliament. In the 2000s, it obtained a small number of local councillors. In 2009, the party&#x27;s candidate, Peter Davies, was elected Mayor of the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster, although he left the party in 2013 in protest at its admittance of former members of the fascist British National Party (BNP). As well as attracting many ex-BNP members, who then constituted a sizeable percentage of the English Democrats&#x27; electoral candidates, in 2015 the political party Veritas merged into it.

Ideologically committed to English nationalism, the party previously called for England to become an independent state, thus leaving the United Kingdom. Since 2016, it has instead called only for the creation of a devolved English Parliament within a federal UK. It has also called for a referendum on whether Monmouthshire, a county presently recognised as being in Wales, should instead be classified as part of England. The party is Eurosceptic, and supported the UK leaving the European Union.

== History ==
In 1998, in response to calls for the devolution of power to Scotland and Wales, Robin Tilbrook aimed at reforming the English National Party, which had ceased operating in 1981. This project included members of the Campaign for an English Parliament, a pressure group that lobbies for a devolved English Parliament. The party was relaunched as the &quot;English Democrats&quot; in September 2002, after merging with several other smaller political parties. In October 2004 the party merged with the Reform UK Party, which was a small splinter group from the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). The New England Party merged with the English Democrats in February 2007.

The English Democrats were co-founders of the English Constitutional Convention, now defunct.

In December 2004, it was rumoured that Robert Kilroy-Silk, the former UKIP MEP had entered into negotiation to join the English Democrats. However, Kilroy-Silk formed Veritas instead.

In 2007, the columnist and TV medical doctor Vernon Coleman announced he had joined the English Democrats.

The party&#x27;s most significant electoral success came when Peter Davies (a former UKIP and Reform UK member), its candidate for Mayor of Doncaster, was elected. Having received 16,961 votes in the first round, 189 votes behind the independent Michael Maye, Davies was returned in the second count on transfers of second preference votes, with 25,344 votes to 24,990. However, Davies announced his resignation from the party on 5 February 2013 citing &quot;a big influx of new members joining from the British National Party&quot;. One of its councillors, Mick Glynn, resigned the following day after the party&#x27;s chairman, Tilbrook, launched a personal attack on Davies, thus reducing its number of elected representatives to two. The English Democrats lost their remaining councillors in the 2015 local elections. On 18 September 2015, Veritas merged into the English Democrats.

The party claimed a total membership of 1,011 at the end of 2004, and 1,202 at the end of 2005.

In 2015, the party lost the vast majority of its general election minimum 5% of poll deposits, had a few councillors elected and gained some by defection and was regarded by some as a fringe party.

==Leaders==
== Election performances and campaigns ==

The first person to stand as a candidate for the English Democrats was Gary Cowd, who stood in West Heath Ward, Rushmoor, in North Hampshire in a council by-election in May 2003. Cowd was an active member of the English Democrats and a National Council member. He left the party in 2006.

===House of Commons===
=== Parliamentary elections ===
At the 2004 Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election the English Democrat candidate received 277 votes, or 1.4% of the votes cast.

The party&#x27;s slogan for the 2005 general election was &quot;The English Democrats – Putting England First!&quot; In total, the English Democrats fielded 25 candidates for the May 2005 general election, including Staffordshire South where the election was delayed until June due to the death of a candidate. The party withdrew its candidate in North Norfolk and endorsed the Conservative Party candidate, Iain Dale, as he had &quot;taken the issues of English discrimination seriously&quot;.

Garry Bushell, the former &quot;Sun&quot; journalist and current &quot;Daily Star Sunday&quot; TV critic, became the most high-profile candidate for the English Democrats, standing in the Greenwich and Woolwich constituency in London. Bushell&#x27;s 1,216 votes (3.4%) beat the UKIP candidate, Stan Gain, who secured 709 votes (2.0%); this was the party&#x27;s best result for the election though still a fifth-place performance.

In June 2005, Bushell also stood in Staffordshire South, where he received 643 votes (2.5%) coming fifth out of eight candidates. In 2011, Bushell announced that he would, in future, be supporting UKIP.

The English Democrats fielded Joanne Robinson as their candidate in the by-election forced by the resignation of former shadow home secretary David Davis from the House of Commons. Because of the issues raised by David Davis in the by-election, many parties other than the Conservatives, such as Labour, Liberal Democrats, United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and British National Party (BNP) chose not to stand. Joanne Robinson came third, with 1,714 votes (7.2%), 44 votes fewer than the Green candidate received in second place. Of the 26 candidates she was one of only three to win back her deposit. This result is both the highest place gained and the highest percentage of the votes won by any English Democrat candidate in a parliamentary election or parliamentary by-election.
The English Democrats stood 107 candidates in the 2010 general election. 106 is the minimum number required to qualify for a Party Election Broadcast. The English Democrats received 64,826 votes, or 0.3% of the vote in England, and 0.2% of the vote in the United Kingdom. No candidates were elected but the party saved one deposit in the Doncaster North constituency, where candidate Wayne Crawshaw picked up 5.2% of the vote.

In subsequent by-elections, the party contested Oldham East and Saddleworth (where Stephen Morris polled 144 (0.4%)), Barnsley Central (Kevin Riddiough polled 544 (2.2%) votes), Feltham and Heston (Roger Cooper polled 322 (1.4%)), Corby (David Wickham polled 432 (1.2%) votes) and Rotherham (David Wildgoose polled 703 (3.3%) votes).

At the 2015 general election, the party contested 32 seats, securing a total of 6,531 votes (0.02%).

In the 2016 Batley and Spen by-election, the English Democrats received 4.8% of the votes, coming second to Labour&#x27;s Tracy Brabin, when all of the other major parties did not stand out of respect for the murdered MP, Jo Cox.

=== European Parliament elections ===
==== 2004 ====
The English Democrats stood candidates for the 2004 European Parliament election in five of the nine regions of England. The party&#x27;s 2004 election canvassing leaflet featured the slogan, &quot;Not left, not right, just English&quot;. Its candidates received 130,056 votes in total.

==== 2009 ====
In June 2009, the English Democrats contested elections to the European Parliament. The party fielded a full slate of candidates across the nine English European parliament constituencies. On 18 May 2009, the English Democrats broadcast their first national Party Election Broadcast. They came seventh in the election in England (ninth in the UK as a whole) with 279,801 votes or 1.8%, a rise from the 0.7% they received at the previous elections in 2004. The English Democrats do not stand in Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales, and their vote across England in 2009 was 2.1%, an increase of 1.3% yet still did not keep their deposits except in Yorkshire and the Humber where they gained 2.6% of the vote. None of the English Democrats candidates were elected; the English Democrats were the highest-polling party across the UK not to have an MEP elected.

==== 2014 ====
The English Democrats began their 2014 EU election campaign in September 2013 with an extensive social media campaign. On 30 April 2014, they held a rally at Fobbing in Essex, the site of the 1381 Peasants&#x27; Revolt, and declared, &quot;let the English revolt begin.&quot; The party fielded a full slate of candidates across the nine English European parliament constituencies on 22 May 2014. On 13 February 2014, party chairman Robin Tilbrook appeared on the BBC &quot;Daily Politics&quot; with Nicola Sturgeon, the deputy leader of the Scottish National Party. The English Democrats performed poorly at the election, taking just 0.8% of the votes, down more than 1% on 2009. They again failed to win any seats.

==== 2019 ====
In May 2019, the English Democrats took part in the elections to the European Parliament, fielding candidates in only four out of nine English constituencies: East of England, North West England, South West England, and Yorkshire and the Humber. In total they received 39,938 votes, 0.2% of the 17,199,701 valid votes cast, being around 10,000 in each of the constituencies they contested. They again failed to win any seats.

=== Local councils ===
In November 2005, the party achieved its first electoral success when Paul Adams was elected to Crowborough Town Council, polling 120 votes, or 56.8% of the poll, on a turnout of 10%.

In the 2007 local elections, 78 candidates stood for election in boroughs and districts in 15 English counties, including 20 in Dartford and ten in Portsmouth. All were unsuccessful.

In 2008, the party fielded candidates in 12 district council elections. None was elected. The party&#x27;s best results were when it came second to the Conservatives: in the Finningley ward of Doncaster and in three wards in Rochford.

In the 2009 English local elections, the party fielded 84 county council and local authority candidates, with a particular focus in Bristol, Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Wiltshire and Lancashire. The party had an unexpected success when Peter Davies, its candidate for Mayor of Doncaster, was elected. Having received 16,961 votes in the first round, 189 votes behind the independent Michael Maye, Davies was returned in the second count on transfers of second preference votes, with 25,344 votes to 24,990.

In 2010, the party also stood in the local elections on 6 May, but did not publish a list of candidates. The two sitting English Democrat councillors on Calderdale and Blackburn with Darwen councils retired, and the party did not nominate any candidates to contest the seats.

In 2011, the EDP stood about 130 candidates in district level elections; two were elected. The Boston Borough Council elections on 5 May 2011, saw the election of the first two EDP councillors. David Owens and Elliott Fountain were elected in the Fenside Ward for a four-year term, thus becoming the only EDP members of a district council to be elected by public vote. A sitting EDP councillor on Peterborough council lost his seat.

The party fielded a candidate in the 3 March 2011 local by-election for the Walkden North ward of Salford City Council. Its candidate, Laurence Depares, polled 125 votes (7%) and came third, ahead of the British National Party and Liberal Democrats; in a by-election in the same city&#x27;s Swinton South ward on 7 January 2014 the party was fifth with 54 votes (3.7%).

In 2012, the party fielded 101 candidates in the local elections in England, including district council elections, mayoral contests and elections to the Greater London Assembly. None was elected, and the party suffered the loss of the two seats it was defending, one that it had gained from a former BNP member who had defected to the party and another from an ex-Tory. The English Democrats has come under fire from the anti-fascist groups Unite Against Fascism and Hope not Hate and from the trades unions NASUWT and Unite the Union over the number of former BNP members standing for election for the party. 43% of English Democrats candidates in the 2012 local elections were former BNP members.

The EDP contested the mayoral elections in Liverpool and Salford. In Liverpool, its candidate received 1.42% of the vote, finishing in ninth place, and in Salford 3.6% finishing in eighth place. The party chairman, Robin Tilbrook, declared that he was standing for Mayor of London and asked for donations through one of the party&#x27;s websites but his name did not appear on the ballot paper.

=== Welsh Assembly ===
In 2007, in line with the English Democrats stance on the status of Monmouthshire, 13 English Democrat candidates contested the Welsh Assembly elections in the South East Wales region, and the constituencies of Monmouth (fifth with 2.7%), Newport East (sixth, 2.2%) and Newport West (fifth, 2.7%). The party also received 0.9% of the vote on the regional list.

The party contested the 2016 Welsh Assembly election in Monmouth. Its candidate, Stephen Morris, received 146 votes, 0.5% of the votes cast.

=== London Mayoral elections ===
In July 2007, Garry Bushell was nominated as the English Democrats&#x27; Mayoral candidate for the 2008 London mayoral and Assembly elections with the campaign slogan &quot;Serious About London&quot;. In January 2008, he stepped down as candidate because of work commitments and Matt O&#x27;Connor, the founder of Fathers 4 Justice, was selected by the English Democrats in his place with his campaign expected to start on 14 February. His campaign web site was launched on 31 January 2008. A party political broadcast for O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s campaign was broadcast on 11 April.

One week before the election, on 25 April, O&#x27;Connor told Vanessa Feltz and the BBC that he was dropping out of the Mayoral race, giving as his reasons the lack of support within the English Democrats on St George&#x27;s Day and a lack of press coverage as well as the party&#x27;s co-operation with the far-right group England First. The English Democrats released a press statement on their website in response to his resignation voicing disappointment at his decision to quit the contest. O&#x27;Connor received 10,695 first preference votes (representing 0.44% of the votes cast) in the mayoral contest, ranking ninth out of ten candidates; he received 73,538 second preference votes (3.67%), ranking eighth.

In December 2015, Winston McKenzie announced that he had joined the English Democrats, along with confirmation that he had been selected as a London Mayoral Candidate for the 2016 London Elections. His nomination was deemed invalid and he did not contest the mayoral election.

=== Police commissioners ===
====2012====
English Democrats contested five of the 41 of the Police and Crime Commissioner elections in November 2012. Results were:
====2014====
David Allen also contested the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner by-election in October 2014.
====2021====
The English democrats contested two of the 39 of the 2021 England and Wales police and crime commissioner elections. Results were:

In November 2005, Paul Adams became the first elected English Democrats councillor at parish level for Crowborough Town Council in East Sussex, polling 120 votes of 211 cast; he was returned in 2007 in an uncontested election. In 2011, he was elected as an independent, so the English Democrats lost the seat. Later that year, Markyate Parish councillor Simon Deacon defected from the British National Party, to the English Democrats, having been elected unopposed. However, he resigned in October 2012. The English Democrats gained another parish council seat when Mick Glynn was elected for the Dunsville ward of Hatfield Town Council, Doncaster. Following the resignation of Peter Davies, Glynn resigned his seat and membership of the party in February 2013.

The party had two district councillors elected (the first above parish level) in the 2011 local elections and obtained a further county council seat through the defection of a BNP, later &quot;Independent Nationalist&quot;, councillor in Hertfordshire. However, the county councillor did not defend the seat in the May 2013 election, nor did the EDP put forward another candidate, losing them the seat.
The EDP lost one of its district councillors, Elliott Fountain, on 25 July 2013 after he failed to attend any meetings in six months. Following the 2015 local elections, the English Democrats have no representation on any local authorities.

== Electoral fraud ==
In March 2017, Steven Uncles, the former regional chairman and candidate for the Kent Police and Crime Commissioner election, was imprisoned for seven months after he had completed County Council nomination forms using fake names such as &quot;Anna Cleves&quot; and &quot;Rachelle Stevens&quot;, or real people who had not signed the relevant forms. He was subsequently expelled from the party for bringing it into disrepute.

== Party policies ==
It presents itself as an English equivalent to the Scottish National Party (SNP), although the SNP is generally considered to be a centre-left party whereas the English Democrats are on the right of the political spectrum. The English Democrats have accepted defectors from the far-right British National Party (BNP) into leadership roles and some former members of the party have criticised informal links with other far-right organisations, although party leader Robin Tilbrook has stated that party members are expected to pledge their opposition to racism.

=== An English Parliament, but no longer independence ===
The English Democrat leader frequently changes the party&#x27;s constitutional offering. Since 2016, they propose creating a unified, devolved English parliament, within a federal UK, not an independent sovereign state. An English executive and first minister with the same powers as Scottish ones, and a reformed second chamber at Westminster. It proposes fiscal devolution so that the English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish parliaments become responsible for financing their own expenditure.

In 2006, the party rejected suggestions that non-English MPs in the House of Commons should be barred from voting on England-specific matters, on the basis that this would lead to there being, in effect, two parliaments in the same building and that this would be problematic.

From March 2014 to the 2015 general election, the party chairman, Robin Tilbrook, had suggested England should become an independent country. Temporarily rekindling its roots, his 2015 general election campaign launch was moved on from Traitors Gate (Tower of London), to the nearby &quot;Hung, Drawn and Quartered&quot; pub. Tilbrook accused various political parties of being traitors to the English (Labour, the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru and Sinn Féin), and the United Kingdom Independence Party &quot;have no interest in England whatsoever&quot;. He said the party was &quot;consolidating our position as the English nationalist party&quot;.

=== Immigration ===
In the party&#x27;s 2019 general election manifesto, alongside campaigning for an independent England with an English parliament and English prime minister, the party also stated that immigration would come under the control of an English parliament. The party called for a points-style system based upon the Canadian and Australian models, and called for a withdrawal from the 1951 Refugee Convention.

=== Traditional counties ===
The party is supportive of historic counties. It has called for a referendum on whether Monmouthshire should be part of England rather than Wales.

It contested the constituency of Monmouth in the 2015 general election, receiving 100 votes (0.2% of votes cast).

== Nationalist connections ==
On 17 November 2011, the chairman of the English Democrats, Robin Tilbrook, met Sergey Yerzunov, a member of the executive committee of the Russian right-wing group Russky Obraz. Shortly afterwards, Obraz announced that it was in alliance with the English Democrats. Other members of this alliance include the Serbian Obraz, 1389 Movement, Golden Dawn, Danes&#x27; Party, Slovenska Pospolitost, Workers&#x27; Party and Noua Dreaptă.

Since 2010, a number of former members of the BNP have joined the project, with the party chairman quoted as saying, &quot;They will help us become an electorally credible party.&quot; In an April 2013 interview, Tilbrook said that about 200–300 of the party&#x27;s membership of 3,000 were former BNP members. He said it was &quot;perfectly fair&quot; that such people would &quot;change their minds&quot; and join a &quot;moderate, sensible English nationalist party&quot;.

===New England Party===
The New England Party was a local party in Dartford from March 2003 to February 2007, when it merged with the English Democrats. Its leader, nominating officer and treasurer was Michael Tibby while Sheila Tibby was its campaigns officer.

Michael Tibby and Austen Brooker were councillors on Dartford Borough Council between 2003 and 2007, representing Littlebrook and Newtown. Tibby came second in Littlebrook in the 2003 local elections, while Brooker was elected as one of three Labour councillors for Newtown, but left Labour soon after his election in May 2003, initially as an independent. Brooker stood down at the 2007 local elections and Tibby was unsuccessful in seeking re-election for the English Democrats, coming third.

Michael Tibby contested Dartford at the 2005 general election, receiving 1,224 votes (the elected Labour MP, Howard Stoate, received 19,909 votes). The party contested the Dartford Borough Council Heath ward by-election on 27 July 2006, polling 174 votes (9.6%). The candidate was Steven Uncles, who had been the English Democrats candidate in the 2006 Bromley and Chislehurst by-election.

The New England Party merged with the English Democrats in February 2007.

===Reform UK Party===

Reform UK Party was a small UKIP splinter group of those opposing Nigel Farage, led by Harold Green from 2000 to 2004, when it merged with the English Democrats. Green received 357 votes (0.9%) in Reigate in the 2001 general election standing for Reform UK Party.

<text>English National Party has been the name of various political parties of England, which have commonly called for a separate parliament for England.

==The original ENP==

===History===
The English National Party (ENP) was founded as the John Hampden New Freedom Party in 1966 by Frank Hansford-Miller. &quot;John Hampden&quot; was a reference to a leading parliamentarian from the English Civil War. In 1974, it was renamed the &quot;English Nationalist Party&quot;. It was defunct by 1981; by this time, Hansford-Miller had left, and he campaigned for the &quot;Abolition of Rates Coalition&quot; in the 1981 Greater London Council elections.

The party&#x27;s best known policy was advocating a devolved English parliament. Other policies included calling for the abolition of income tax, and an end to local authority housing. It was considered to be centre-right, and not racist.

===Performance===
The party contested the first 1974 general election as the John Hampden New Freedom Party; it contested the second 1974 and the 1979 general elections as the ENP. Its best performance was at the second 1974 general election, where it fielded two candidates and secured 1,115 votes. It achieved its greatest notability in April 1976, when it was joined by the Member of Parliament John Stonehouse, who had formerly represented the Labour Party and at the time was awaiting trial for fraud. However, Stonehouse was convicted and left Parliament in August of that year, and the party did not stand a candidate in the subsequent by-election.

==Other parties by the name==
According to the far-right magazine &quot;Spearhead&quot;, a group called the English National Party was one of the small far-right organisations that joined the National Front shortly after it was formed in 1967.

There have been several parties which have adopted the &quot;English National Party&quot; name. These include a far right organisation formed by Raymond Shenton which contested the 1984 Enfield Southgate by-election; a party founded in around 1995 by Christopher Nickerson, which aimed for England to secede from the United Kingdom to support a sense of English national identity; and a party founded by Robin Tilbrook and James Alden in 1999, with the aim of securing a devolved English Parliament, which was later renamed the English Democrats Party in 2002, and then just the English Democrats in 2004.

In April 1999, a group calling itself the &quot;English National Party&quot; was one of several different organisations which claimed responsibility for a nail-bomb attack in Brixton. David Copeland, who admitted to carrying out the bombing, said that the claims of responsibility were made by others to &quot;try to steal his glory.&quot;

<doc id="424828" wikidata="Q611845" url="?curid=424828" title="The Polyphonic Spree">
<text>The Polyphonic Spree is an American choral rock band from Dallas, Texas that was formed in 2000 by singer/songwriter Tim DeLaughter. The band&#x27;s pop and rock songs are augmented by a large vocal choir, and instruments such as flute, trumpet, french horn, trombone, violin, viola, cello, percussion, piano, guitars, bass, drums, electronic keyboards, and EWI.

==History==
DeLaughter&#x27;s previous group, Tripping Daisy, came to an abrupt end in 1999 when guitarist Wes Berggren died of a drug overdose. The Polyphonic Spree was formed, in part, in reaction to Berggren&#x27;s death.

In 2000, DeLaughter collaborated with 12 other musicians to put together a sound that reflected the music he grew up with. He wanted to explore the orchestral palette and pop sensibility of The Beatles, The Association, The 5th Dimension, Wings, Electric Light Orchestra and The Beach Boys and the vocal style of Ozzy Osbourne from Black Sabbath. Within two weeks, The Polyphonic Spree created a 30-minute set, donned their signature white choir robes and performed with Grandaddy and Bright Eyes.

Shortly after their first show, 12 more musicians joined the band, and they recorded &quot;The Beginning Stages of ... The Polyphonic Spree&quot;, which contained all nine songs (sections) written for their first show plus a tenth track (&quot;Section 10 – Long Day&quot;). The album was intended to serve as a demo recording for booking the band for live performances. As a result of the attention they received from the press and other industry pundits after performing at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas, the band was invited to perform at London&#x27;s Meltdown Festival curated by David Bowie in 2002. They opened for The Divine Comedy at the Royal Festival Hall the same year.

In early 2003, they were dropped by their record label, 679 Recordings, for &quot;lack of record sales&quot;. About this time, the band began to break into pop culture. The song &quot;Light and Day&quot; was used in a joint Volkswagen Beetle/iPod tie-in advertising campaign, appearing on television commercials nationwide in 2004. The same song was used in a tribute to Bill Walsh during an NFL football preseason special, in an episode of the TV series &quot;Scrubs&quot;, in &quot;Murderball&quot;, a documentary about the U.S. wheelchair rugby team, and as the end music for the first series of the BBC Radio 7 sci-fi comedy &quot;Undone&quot;; the song&#x27;s video was adapted for the movie &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (the DVD features a clip). Also during this time the band was invited to be an opening act for Bowie&#x27;s Reality Tour and again performed at South by Southwest.

In 2004, Hollywood Records released the Spree&#x27;s second album, &quot;Together We&#x27;re Heavy&quot;, in Japan on June 30, Europe on July 12, and North America on July 13, 2004. The band was featured on &quot;Scrubs&quot; on April 20, 2004, in the episode &quot;My Choosiest Choice of All&quot; (season 3, episode 19); and on the TV show &quot;Las Vegas&quot; on November 29, 2004, in the episode &quot;Silver Star&quot; (season 2, episode 10). In December 2004, the Polyphonic Spree performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert, honoring Wangari Maathai before a worldwide television audience.

2005 saw the release of &quot;Thumbsucker&quot;, a feature film by Mike Mills, with a score composed by Tim DeLaughter and performed by The Polyphonic Spree.

On June 19, 2007, the band released their third complete album, &quot;The Fragile Army&quot;, produced by John Congleton. On their 2007 tours The Polyphonic Spree replaced their robes with black army outfits while continuing to don the robes during encores. In July 2007, the song &quot;Running Away&quot; was featured on the Sci-Fi network in commercials for its upcoming season. In the autumn of 2007, Adidas commissioned artists to write theme songs for MLS teams as part of a campaign called &quot;MLS Represent&quot;, and the Polyphonic Spree was chosen to write a song for FC Dallas. The result was the song &quot;H-O-O-P-S Yes!&quot; In September 2007, the Polyphonic Spree performed three songs: &quot;Light and Day / Reach for the Sun&quot;, &quot;Soldier Girl&quot;, and &quot;Light to Follow&quot;, at Oscar de la Renta&#x27;s Spring 2008 Fashion Show for New York Fashion Week. They recorded the opening track to the Showtime series Weeds for season 2 (episode 9), and also contributed to the &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; and &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; tribute CDs. UK channel Sky Sports used &quot;Running Away&quot; to advertise their spring and summer cricket coverage. UK supermarket Sainsbury&#x27;s continues to use &quot;Light and Day / Reach for the Sun&quot; for its advertising campaign. It became the most-used song in advertising in the United Kingdom.

In 2009, the band wrote and performed the opening sequence to Showtime&#x27;s new show &quot;The United States of Tara&quot;, which stars Toni Collette as a woman with multiple personality disorder. They first performed the song live on their Australian tour, in Adelaide. &quot;Light and Day / Reach for the Sun&quot; was also featured on the &quot;Your UQ&quot; advertising campaign for the University of Queensland.

On July 11, 2011, the band released Bullseye, an interactive music video app for iOS devices featuring the first single from a collection of songs.

&quot;Light and Day / Reach for the Sun&quot; was featured in the movie trailer for the 2012 animated film &quot;The Lorax&quot;. On October 11, 2012, the band launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund their next studio album, tour, live album, and concert DVD. They reached their funding goal of $100,000 on November 28. The band&#x27;s &quot; &quot;was released in 2012, featuring an original introduction, outro and Polyphonic Spree cover versions of classic Christmas songs including &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; and &quot;Let it Snow&quot;.

On August 6, 2013, the band played a sold-out concert at London&#x27;s Village Underground to mark the release of their album &quot;Yes, It&#x27;s True&quot;. The performance was broadcast live on Vimeo. A US release show at the Granada Theater in Dallas followed on August 9, and the band toured in support of the album worldwide. A live DVD was released in October 2013, and the band played their famous Holiday Extravaganza in Dallas, Texas on December 21.

In 2014 the band released the studio album &quot;Psychphonic&quot;.

The Polyphonic Spree headlined the 2015 Big D NYE party, December 31, 2014, at Dallas&#x27;s Victory Park at the American Airlines Center. The free outdoor concert was attended by a crowd of over 40,000, who gathered for the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve event. Perhaps because of the 35 °F weather, the choir wore matching winter ponchos, while other musicians wore pajamas. DeLaughter&#x27;s headgear resembled a Fred Flintstone Grand Poobah lodge hat (tall fur with buffalo horns). Covers included Wings&#x27; &quot;Band on the Run&quot; and the Thunderclap Newman hit &quot;Something in the Air&quot;. The band occasionally paused to sync with television cues, as the concert was broadcast live to a regional television audience of over 12 million in Texas and surrounding states.

&quot;Afflatus&quot; was released on April 16, 2021. &quot;Afflatus&quot; is a cover album featuring songs by bands such as INXS, The Bee Gees, and Rush.

On November 17, 2023, The Polyphonic Spree released their eighth studio album, &quot;Salvage Enterprise.&quot;

<text>Maborosi, known in Japan as , is a 1995 Japanese drama film by director Hirokazu Kore-eda starring Makiko Esumi, Tadanobu Asano, and Takashi Naito. It is based on a novel by Teru Miyamoto.

&quot;Maborosi&quot; won a Golden Osella Award for Best Cinematography at the 1995 Venice Film Festival.

==Plot==
Yumiko (Esumi) and Ikuo (Asano) are a young Osaka couple who have a new baby. One day Ikuo is walking along the railway tracks and is hit and killed by a train. It seems that he may have done this deliberately yet there is no apparent motive. A few years pass. Yumiko agrees to an arranged marriage with a widower, Tamio (Naitō), and she and Yuichi (her son, now played by Gohki Kashima) move to Tamio&#x27;s house in a rustic village on the Sea of Japan coast.

A drunken spat over a bell Yumiko had given Ikuo just before he died causes Yumiko and Tamio to discuss their strong emotions for their lost loves. Shortly after, Yumiko follows a funeral procession and lingers at the crematorium, until Tamio arrives by car to pick her up, at which point she says she just wants to know why Ikuo killed himself. Tamio suggests that, like the will o&#x27; the wisps his father used to see, perhaps something just drew him away from life.

==Critical reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Maborosi&quot; has a perfect approval rating of based on reviews, with an average score of . On Metacritic, the film is scored 92 out of a 100, based on 8 reviews. It garnered a positive reaction from critics upon its American release, and received two thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert on the April 12, 1997 episode of their program. Ebert further praised the film in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, noting its &quot;astonishing beauty and sadness&quot; and the influence of Japanese filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu. It was later included on Siskel and Ebert&#x27;s &quot;Best Films of 1997&quot; episode in January 1998.

<text>Ieuan Wyn Jones (born 22 May 1949) is a Welsh politician who was the Deputy First Minister in the Welsh Government from 2007 to 2011. He was the Member of the National Assembly for Wales for the Ynys Môn constituency from 1999 to 2013, and he was also leader of Plaid Cymru from 2000 to 2012. Jones served as Member of Parliament for Ynys Môn constituency from 1987 to 2001, when he retired to focus on his work in the Welsh Assembly. In 2007, Jones was named Wales&#x27; &quot;Politician of the Year&quot; by the BBC Wales am.pm programme. He resigned from the Welsh Assembly on 20 June 2013. In 2017 he unsuccessfully sought to return to the House of Commons for his former constituency.

==Background and style==

===Family, education, and early career===

Ieuan Wyn Jones was born in Denbigh, Wales, and is a Welsh speaker. He has lived in both north and south Wales. Jones&#x27;s early education was at Pontardawe Grammar School and at Ysgol y Berwyn in Bala, Gwynedd. Jones&#x27;s brother Rhisiart said &quot;The time we spent living in Garnswllt (between Ammanford, in Carmarthenshire, and Pontarddulais, in Swansea) was a very happy time for us as a family,&quot; adding &quot;Many people think that Ieuan is just a &#x27;gog&#x27; but parts of south Wales are very close to his heart.&quot;

In England Jones studied law at Liverpool Polytechnic where he secured an external London University law degree. He qualified as a solicitor in 1973 with second class honours in his solicitors’ finals. Rhisiart Jones said his brother loves to travel and that after college Ieuan &quot;organised a &#x27;rite of passage&#x27; trip across Europe in his Hillman Imp.&quot;

He was married to Eirian Llwyd until her death in 2014. They had three children together. Jones&#x27;s hobbies include studying local history, walking, and sports. Jones, a minister&#x27;s son, is an elder in his local chapel and occasionally preaches. Before entering public service in 1987, Jones was a practising solicitor. Jones became a Member of the Eisteddfod&#x27;s Gorsedd in 2001.

===Personal style===

Ieuan Wyn Jones is known as a keen negotiator and a &quot;man of integrity, one who is reliable and &#x27;a good listener&#x27;&quot;. 
According to Lord Elis-Thomas, Jones assiduously &quot;talks to each (Plaid Cymru assembly) group member individually&quot; and &quot;will ensure the [One Wales] government achieves what it says it will.&quot;

Jones is generally seen as a pragmatist, steering a middle course between his party&#x27;s (predominately southern) socialists and the language-inspired activists of the party&#x27;s Anglesey and Gwynedd heartland.

==Political life==

Jones&#x27;s main political interest is health and education policy. Jones has held a number of positions both in Plaid Cymru and as a UK Member of Parliament and Welsh Assembly Member. He was Plaid Cymru party chairman between 1980–1982 and 1990–1992.

===UK Parliament 1987–2001===

Jones campaigned for public office for the first time in Denbigh at the October 1974 general election, and stood again in 1979. At the 1987 general election, he won the Ynys Môn (Anglesey) seat. He continued to represent Ynys Môn until the 2001 general election, when he stood down to concentrate on the Welsh Assembly. While a Member of Parliament, he piloted a private member&#x27;s bill to assist the hard of hearing in 1989 and was a member of the Welsh Affairs and Agriculture Select Committees. He was the joint chairman of the All-Party Older Persons Group and was appointed as a trustee of the Industry and Parliament Trust, a body promoting better understanding between parliamentarians and industrialists. He won an award as Politician of the Year from the Federation of Small Businesses.

Jones has been a governor of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, a body that assists in the development of democratic institutions in many parts of the world.

Jones stood down at the 2001 election to spend more time in the Assembly.

===First Welsh Assembly 1999–2003===

Jones was the Plaid Cymru campaign director during the first elections to the Welsh Assembly in 1999. The elections were seen as a breakthrough by the party, which gained seats in solid Labour areas such as in the Rhondda, Islwyn and Llanelli and achieved by far their highest share of the vote in any Wales-wide election, winning 17 of 60 seats in the Assembly. Plaid Cymru saw themselves as the natural beneficiary of devolution.

In 1999, Jones became the Assembly&#x27;s first Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee chairman, a post he retained until February 2000.

====Elected party president====

He was elected President (Leader) of Plaid Cymru on 4 August 2000 with 77% of the vote over Helen Mary Jones and Jill Evans.

Jones reshuffled the party leadership with Jocelyn Davies as Business Manager; Elin Jones as Chief Whip and Agriculture &amp; Rural Development spokeswoman; Phil Williams as Economic Development spokesman; and Helen Mary Jones as Environment, Transport and Planning and Equal Opportunities spokeswoman. Jones described his cabinet as &quot;strong... capable of taking on Labour in the Assembly as well as making a vital contribution in promoting a positive policy agenda.&quot;

====Language controversy====

Controversy erupted in mid-winter 2001 when Gwynedd councillor Seimon Glyn voiced concern over &quot;English immigrants&quot; moving into traditionally Welsh-speaking communities. Though some Plaid Cymru colleagues said he had been taken out of context, Jones issued &quot;strict instructions to Plaid Cymru party members that if they chose to speak on the same emotive issue in future, they should take care that their words were not misconstrued.&quot; Plaid Cymru refocused the argument back to one of locals being priced out of the housing market: nearly a third of all properties in Gwynedd are bought by people from out of that county. Jones&#x27;s centrist policies may have been helped further by the formation of Welsh language pressure group Cymuned and the Independent Wales Party.

====Llandudno party conference====

At the Plaid Cymru party conference of 2002 in Llandudno, Jones called for greater Assembly authority &quot;[on-parity] with Scotland&#x27;s parliament&quot;, and &quot;opposed any military conflict in Iraq, saying it would destabilise the Middle East.&quot; Jones also criticized health and public services policies and would end the &quot;endless revamping of structures and administration&quot;.

&quot;[Plaid Cymru] has been doing its homework&quot;, wrote BBC Wales political reporter Simon Morris, and is &quot;determined to produce a credible programme of public service reform&quot;.

===Second Welsh Assembly 2003–2007===

However, in the Assembly election of May 2003, Plaid Cymru lost five seats, and within a week there were accusations of a plot headed by Assembly Member Helen Mary Jones and four other Plaid Cymru Assembly Members manoeuvring for Jones&#x27;s removal. But Helen Mary Jones denied involvement. However, Jones resigned as both party president and leader of the assembly group. He admits this was a particularly difficult period.

But within three months he stood again for the position of assembly leader, having received support from both grassroots &quot;all over Wales&quot; and senior party members. The party was undergoing a reorganization and dividing its Cardiff Bay and Westminster responsibilities. This party constitutional change prompted new party elections. Jones was re-elected as Assembly group leader (he had been the party&#x27;s Business Manager in the Assembly since May). In addition, when leader of the opposition he was also a member of the Assembly&#x27;s European and External Affairs Committee and North Wales Regional Committee. Of early 2003 Jones said &quot;it has been a remarkable journey for me personally and something that I have great pride in, in a sense, that I have been able to lead the party through a very difficult period.

In 2006, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by the University of Wales, Bangor. That summer Jones hiked through Wales on a &quot;Wales Wide&quot; tour from Ynys Môn to Swansea, where he attended the National Eisteddfod. Jones said his conversations with the people he met along the way helped create a manifesto better geared to the real needs of people.

In February 2006, Plaid Cymru undertook changes to its party structure, including designating the leader of the party in the Assembly as its overall leader, with Jones taking the post once more. Additionally, the party unveiled a radical change of image, opting to use &quot;Plaid&quot; as the party&#x27;s name, although &quot;Plaid Cymru – The Party of Wales&quot; would remain the official title. The party&#x27;s colours were changed to yellow from the traditional green and red, while the party logo was changed from the &quot;triban&quot; (three peaks) used since 1933 to a yellow Welsh poppy (&quot;Meconopsis cambrica&quot;).

===Third Welsh Assembly 2007–2011===

Jones led Plaid Cymru through the Welsh Assembly election of 3 May 2007. Plaid Cymru increased its share of the vote to 22% and its number of seats from 12 to 15, regaining Llanelli, gaining one additional list seat and winning the newly created constituency of Aberconwy The 2007 election also saw Plaid Cymru&#x27;s Mohammad Asghar become the first ethnic minority candidate elected to the Welsh Assembly, though on 9 December 2009 he left and joined the Conservatives.

====Forming a government====

Jones&#x27;s initial attempts to form a three-party coalition with the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties failed when the Liberal Democrat leadership backed out of coalition talks. This &quot;Rainbow Coalition&quot; would have formed the first ever PC-led government. With the reappointment of Welsh Labour&#x27;s Rhodri Morgan as First Minister, the Liberal Democrat general party membership demanded that their leadership restart negotiations with Plaid and the Conservatives. However, by now Jones had entered into coalition talks with Labour in an attempt to form a stable government with Plaid&#x27;s AMs approving a deal with the Labour Party on 27 June 2007. Labour&#x27;s special party conference on 6 July 2007 approved the coalition; Plaid Cymru&#x27;s conference the next day sealed the arrangement.

During the coalition negotiations, Jones pressed for full law-making powers for the Assembly, similar to the Scottish Parliament. A referendum on the issue was promised &quot;as soon as practicable, at or before the end of the assembly term (in 2011)&quot;, with Welsh Labour committed to campaign for a &quot;yes&quot; vote. Other points Jones fought for included a first-time buyer&#x27;s credit, a reconfiguration of the Welsh National Health Care service, and a 3% annual reduction in carbon emissions by 2011 in areas of devolved competence. The result of the negotiations was the &quot;One Wales&quot; agreement.

Of Plaid Cymru&#x27;s entering into government for the first time, Jones said, &quot;The party&#x27;s role so far has been one of the opposition party which put pressure on the other parties to move things forward for the benefit of Wales,&quot; and &quot;From today we will be sharing the responsibility of directly operating on behalf of the people of Wales. I am looking forward to the challenge.&quot;

====Deputy First Minister of Wales====
Ieuan Wyn Jones became Deputy First Minister of Wales on 11 July 2007. First Minister and Labour leader Rhodri Morgan was hospitalized days after the parties entered into coalition. Lord Elis-Thomas said of the situation, &quot;I think [Jones] will be a very stable influence around the cabinet table in the difficult situation both parties are in now with the first minister&#x27;s illness.&quot; The next day, Ieuan Wyn Jones, with the Queen, represented Wales in Belgium at the 90th anniversary ceremony of the Third Battle of Ypres at Passchendaele (World War I). During the battle, celebrated Welsh poet Hedd Wyn died along with thousands of other Welshmen.

Jones also represented Wales at the British-Irish Council held in Stormont on 16 July, where he said holding the council in the Stormont Parliament for the first time was &quot;a historic occasion&quot;, and &quot;The restoration of devolution was achieved as a result of the coming together, in a spirit of service to all the people of Northern Ireland, of two very distinct political traditions.&quot;

On 19 July 2007 it was announced that Jones would also be Minister for the Economy and Transport.

===Fourth Welsh Assembly 2011–2013===
Jones led Plaid into the Welsh Assembly election of 5 May 2011. Plaid Cymru lost 4 seats and, with 11 seats, became the third largest party in the Assembly; behind Labour (30 seats) and the Conservatives (14). Jones announced on 13 May 2011, the day he ceased being Deputy First Minister, that he would resign as leader of Plaid Cymru within the first half of the Assembly term. Jones remained as an Assembly Member until his resignation on 20 June 2013, in order to take a post leading the new Menai Science Park.

===2017 United Kingdom general election===
In the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Jones contested the seat of Ynys Môn when he was unsuccessful.

==Books==

Jones has published three books, &quot;Europe: the Challenge for Wales&quot; (1996); &quot;Y Llinyn Arian&quot; (1998), a biography of the Welsh nineteenth century publisher, Thomas Gee, and Jones&#x27; own autobiography &quot;O&#x27;r Cyrion i&#x27;r Canol&quot; (2021).

<text>The Anarchistic Pogo Party of Germany (German: &quot;Anarchistische Pogo-Partei Deutschlands&quot;, or &#x27;APPD&#x27;) is the self-declared party of the &quot;Pöbel&quot; (mob) and &quot;social parasites&quot;. It was created in 1981 by two punks in Hannover and took part in the 1998 election to the Bundestag with the promise to pay the voters with free beer. The official communication organ is the paper &quot;Armes Deutschland&quot; (&quot;Poor Germany&quot;), formerly &quot;Asoziale Rundschau&quot; (&quot;Asocial Review&quot;). The name refers to the punk dance, the Pogo.

The party took part in the 2005 German federal election with their chancellor candidate Wolfgang Wendland, who is also the lead singer of the German punk-band &quot;Die Kassierer&quot; (&quot;The Cashiers&quot;). The party has also been barred from elections for formal reasons.

==Aims==
* Right to unemployment with full salary
* Youth pension instead of retirement pension
* Abolishment of compulsory education
* Creation of centers for physical love, so-called &quot;Mitfickzentralen&quot; (literally &quot;fuckpooling centers&quot;)
* Abolition of police
* Legalization of all drugs
* Abolition of the right to demonstrate &quot;with&quot; prior announcement (abolition of distinction between permitted and not permitted)
* &quot;Totale Rückverdummung&quot; (&quot;total restupidification&quot;) and balkanization of Germany
* Reconstitute the German borders from 1237 (a satire on the aim of some German extreme-right parties to restore the German borders during the time of Nazism and World War II, or World War I)

==History==

The party was founded in 1981 by two 17-year-olds with the nicknames &quot;Zewa&quot; (a leading paper towel brand) and &quot;Kotze&quot; (vomit). In the following years it was joined by many punks and organized many demonstrations, which were sometimes ended by the police, often leading to arrests. The party was dissolved in 1986, but was recreated in 1994 and soon chose to participate in elections. 
In the 1997 Hamburg city elections, the APPD received a stunning 5.3% of the votes in St. Pauli and thus became the fourth-strongest party in that district. In 1998, the APPD ran in the Bundestag election with Karl Nagel as its candidate for the chancellorship, and using slogans like &quot;Work is shit&quot; (&quot;Arbeit ist Scheiße&quot;) and &quot;Drinking! Drinking! Every day just drinking&quot; (&quot;Saufen! Saufen! Jeden Tag nur saufen&quot;). The APPD failed, however, to gain the 0.5% of the votes needed to pay to the voters in the form of a promised large party with free beer. With approximately 35,000, or 0.1%, of the votes, the APPD outperformed Lyndon LaRouche&#x27;s &quot;BüSo&quot; and also the German Communist Party DKP. Finally the party was dissolved in 1999. In December 2000, the APPD was reestablished in Munich, but did not participate in the Bundestag election of 2002. A sufficient number of signatures were collected for participation in the European election 2004; however, these did not arrive because the German Postal Service declined to forward them to party chairman Christoph Grossmann. In the following year, the APPD took part in the Bundestag election of 2005 with little success. As a result, the party split into two parties in 2006 - the APPD and the Pogo-Partei. The Pogo-Partei merged with others into the joke party Die Partei. The APPD elected a new chairman, Volker Stoi, and took part in Berlin elections 2011 with little success.

== Theory of pogo-anarchism ==

The concept of Balkanisation is introduced to split up the country into different parts:

*&quot;Asoziale Parasiten-Zonen&quot; (APZ, asocial parasite zone) for pogo-anarchists and other asocials, who prefer not to work and rather drink, use drugs and have sex.
*&quot;Sichere Beschäftigungs-Zonen&quot; (SBZ, safe employment zone) for strait-laced workaholics who will finance the good life of the people in the APZ. This is a pun, since the SBZ in West-German use (used until late into the Willy Brandt-era by the conservative press) meant the &quot;Sowjetisch besetzte Zone&quot; (Soviet Occupied Zone) or &quot;Sowjetische Besatzungszone&quot; (Soviet Occupation Zone), the predecessor of the GDR.
*&quot;Gewalt-Erlebnis-Parks&quot; (GEP, violence theme parks) for incurable violent offenders, cops and Nazis with special areas set aside as ethnic theme parks for cultural minorities (such as lederhosen-wearing Bavarians), to avoid too close contact between these pogo races lest the pursuit of what each considers necessary for happiness suffers. These parks will be surrounded by very high walls and are located in former East Germany.

The APPD propagated the idea of a &quot;youth pension&quot;, to replace the existing old-age pension. The idea was that people should enjoy life first, and work later.

They claim that pogo-anarchism has &quot;nothing to do&quot; with anarchism.

== Slogans ==

<text>The Camaldolese Hermits of Mount Corona (), commonly called Camaldolese, is a monastic order of Pontifical Right for men founded by Saint Romuald. Its name is derived from the Holy Hermitage () of Camaldoli, high in the mountains of central Italy, near the city of Arezzo. Its members add the nominal letters E.C.M.C. after their names to indicate their membership in the congregation. Apart from the Roman Catholic monasteries, in recent times ecumenical Christian hermitages with a Camaldolese spirituality have arisen as well.

==History==
The Camaldolese were established through the efforts of the Italian monk Saint Romuald (). His reform sought to renew and integrate the eremitical tradition of monastic life with that of the cenobium.

In his youth, Romuald became acquainted with the three major schools of Western monastic tradition. The monastery where he first entered monastic life, Sant&#x27; Apollinare in Classe, was a traditional Benedictine community under the influence of the Cluniac reforms. Romuald chose to be under a spiritual master, Marinus, who followed a much harsher ascetic and solitary lifestyle that was originally of Irish eremitical origins. Some years later, Marinus and Romuald settled near the Abbey of Saint Michael de Cuxa, where Abbot Guarinus was also beginning reforms but was building mainly upon the Iberian Christian tradition. Later, drawing on his various early experiences, Romuald was able to establish his own monastic pattern, though he himself never thought of it as a separate entity, seeing it as an integral part of the Benedictine tradition.

Romuald moved around central Italy, founding several colonies of hermits (or &quot;deserts&quot;). Around the year 1012, he made his chief foundation, the Sacred Hermitage of Camaldoli in the Tuscan hills. There the monks lived in individual cells, but also observed the common life, with liturgical celebrations daily in the community church and common meals in the refectory. The monks at Camaldoli adopted the distinctive white habit, later characteristic of their tradition, and there emerged in these early years the combination of the two cenobite and hermit branches that afterwards became so marked a feature of the order.

Romuald and the early Camaldolese exercised considerable influence on the religious movements of their time. The emperors Otto III and Henry II esteemed Romuald highly and sought his advice on religious questions.

In his old age Romuald started on a missionary expedition to Hungary with twenty-five of his monks, but he was unable to accomplish the journey, and he died in 1027.
The order was approved by Pope Alexander II in 1072.

There have been Camaldolese hermitages and monasteries at sites throughout Italy.

==Organization==

===Current congregations===

Currently two separate Camaldolese congregations exist: the Benedictine Camaldolese and the Camaldolese Hermits. Various unsuccessful attempts at reunion between them occurred over the centuries - the longest-lasting that of 1634–1667. In 1667, Pope Clement IX, recognizing the failure, issued a Bull establishing a definitive separation between the congregations.

====Benedictine Camaldolese====
The Benedictine Camaldolese (OSBCam.) are headquartered in the hamlet of Camaldoli in Tuscany. On the mountainside stands the 11th-century Holy Hermitage founded by St. Romuald. Its 16th-century monastery stands a few kilometers below.

The next community founded by the Camaldolese congregation was the Monastery of St. Mary of the Angels in Florence. By the 13th century, its scriptorium had become known throughout Europe as a major source of high-quality parchments, then much in demand. In this monastery the artist Lorenzo Monaco tentatively explored a vocation as a monk from 1390 onwards. Only the church of the monastery now remains in service.

Circa 1603 the Camaldolese Hermit Monastery in Kraków in Poland was established in the village of Bielany (now surrounded by Kraków). The priory consists of hermitages and the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption. Visitors are welcome for scheduled masses.

The New Camaldoli Hermitage on the coast road south of Big Sur, California, was founded in 1958 by the Holy Hermitage of Camaldoli, Italy. Officially named the &quot;Immaculate Heart Hermitage&quot;, it stands on a mountainside overlooking the Pacific Ocean. New Camaldoli has founded two daughter communities, Incarnation Monastery in Berkeley, California, near the GTU, north of U.C. Berkeley in 1979; and the Monastery of the Risen Christ in San Luis Obispo, California in 2014.

The order maintains a mix of monasteries and hermitages for men in countries on five continents. Perhaps most prominent is Saccidananda Ashram, founded in 1950 in the village of Tannirpalli in the Tiruchirapalli District of Tamil Nadu, India, on the bank of the River Kavery. Monasteries for women began in 1086; they are located now mostly in Italy and Poland, also in Tanzania and America. An oblate community started in Australia, which since the mid-1990s continues under the guidance of the Prior New Camaldoli, Big Sur.

====Camaldolese hermits====
The other congregation, known as the Camaldolese Hermits of Monte Corona (Er.Cam.), was established by the Renaissance reformer Paolo Giustiniani (1476-1528). This group lives solely in hermitages, usually with a very small number of monks comprising the community. There are three houses in Italy, two in Poland, and one each in Spain, the United States, and Colombia, as well as a newer foundation in Venezuela. Unlike the other congregation, it is not a member of the larger Benedictine Confederation.
* Eremo Di San Girolamo (Monte Cucco), founded in 1521, does not have the separate, solitary cells typical of the other Coronese Hermitages.
* Eremo SS. Annunziata Di Monte Rua, founded in 1537, served as the center of various Coronese Hermitages in the former Republic of Venice.
* Sacro Eremo Tuscolano, founded in 1607 at Frascati in the Alban Hills, ordinarily functions as the residence of the father major (superior general) and as the novitiate house for Italy.
* Eremo Di Monte Argentino, the &quot;Silver Mountain&quot;, was founded in 1609 in the outskirts of Cracow, Poland. Pope John Paul II visited it in August 2002.
* Eremo Cinque Martiri in Bieniszew in Poland was founded in 1663. In 1941 the hermitage was suppressed by the Nazis; three hermits died in concentration camps. It is presently the novitiate house for Poland.
* Yermo Camaldulense N.S. De Herrera, Burgos, Spain, was founded in 1925 on the site of an ancient Cistercian abbey. It is a novitiate house.
* Holy Family Hermitage in Bloomingdale, Ohio, was founded in the Diocese of Steubenville in 1959. Nine solitary cells stand, according to historical models, in a semicircle about the church. It is a novitiate house.
* Yermo Camaldulense de la Santa Cruz in Antioquia, Colombia, was founded in 1969. It is a novitiate house.
* Yermo Camaldulense Santa Maria de Los Angeles, Venezuela

The Camaldolese Crown (), designed by Bl. Michele Pina (1450–1522), is sometimes called the Crown of Our Lord (). It was officially approved by papal brief on 18 February 1516.

===Extinct congregations===

An early Benedictine Camaldolese site was founded in Florence, St. Mary of the Angels.

Previously there were three autonomous congregations, based in Turin (founded 1596), Venice (1474–1569) and France (founded 1526). The monasteries attached to Hermitage of Turin seem to have been absorbed by the Monte Corona congregation in the 18th century. The Venetian congregation, which was headed by an abbot, and the French one were eventually suppressed by the Holy See. The French monks became associated with Jansenism, due to which their congregation was suppressed in 1770 and the monks dispersed.

By the early 20th century, the Venetian congregation, which was entirely coenobitic, was felt by Rome to be too few in numbers for continued existence, and its members were offered the opportunity to seek admission with the Congregation of Camaldoli. It had contributed many of its members to the service of the Church, most notably Pope Gregory XVI. The noted cartographer Fra Mauro had been a member of the mother monastery of St.Michael of Murano. It was in this community that the German merchant Daniel became a monk. Eventually, he established a solitary hermitage in the woods, where he spent long periods in prayer. He was murdered in his cell by robbers in 1413 and is today venerated as Saint Daniel of Murano.

In the Kingdom of Hungary, four Camaldolese monasteries were established: Zobor Hill (1695), Lánzsér () (1701), Vöröskolostor (1710) and Majk (1733). In 1782 the Emperor Joseph II ordered the dissolution of every monastic order that, in his view, did not pursue useful activities. Thus the Camaldolese monasteries in that realm were secularized.

==Communities of nuns==

Soon after the various communities established by St. Romuald began to develop, communities of nuns desired to share in this reform. Beginning under the guidance of Blessed Rudolph II, third Prior General of Camaldoli, they were accepted into the life of the Congregation. He founded the Monastery of San Pietro di Luco in Mugello near Florence to establish the model of their &quot;Little Rule&quot; in 1086.

At their zenith, only ten monasteries of nuns were a part of the Order. There were many small monasteries, however, which followed the Camaldolese Rule but were subject to local bishops. Of those who form a part of the Congregation of the Holy Hermitage, their Motherhouse is the Abbey of St. Anthony the Abbot in Rome, where the abbess lives.

Over time the Camaldolese nuns came to be concentrated mostly in Italy and in Poland, in Złoczew. A few foundations, though, have been made in other countries. In France, a monastery of nuns was established by Polish nuns of the Order but it is on the verge of closure, with just one nun in residence. A monastery has been founded in Tanzania, which is currently flourishing.

Founded in 1979 by three Sisters, in Windsor, New York, Transfiguration Monastery became formally affiliated with the Camaldolese Benedictine Congregation in 1986. Sister Mary Donald Corcoran, O.S.B. Cam., has served as prioress since its foundation, which she made with two companions, Sisters Placid (a former recluse from France) and Jean Marie Pearse, a native of the region. For practical reasons, they have begun the process of changing their affiliation to an American Benedictine congregation, while still retaining Camaldolese traditions.

==Modern era==
The Benedictine Camaldolese order extended its presence to the United States in 1958 with the founding of Immaculate Heart Hermitage, more commonly called New Camaldoli Hermitage, in the Santa Lucia Mountains of Big Sur, California. New Camaldoli Hermitage later established a daughter house, Incarnation Monastery in Berkeley, California. Fr. Cyprian Consiglio is the current Prior at New Camadoli Hermitage of Big Sur.

The Camaldolese Hermits of Monte Corona established the Holy Family Hermitage in Bloomingdale, Ohio. For several years, there was also a small community, Epiphany Monastery, in New Boston, New Hampshire, which was closed in 1998.

There are Camaldolese communities in India, Brazil, and Tanzania, among others.

An ecumenical Christian community of Camaldolese hermits is present in various countries throughout the world and is known as the Community of Solitude (CoS). The Camaldolese Oblate Community of Australasia is another ecumenical community.

<text>Frances-Marie Uitti (born 1946) is an American cellist and composer known for her use of extended techniques and performance of contemporary classical music. Tom Service, music critic for the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper, has called her &quot;arguably the world&#x27;s most influentially experimental cellist.&quot;

Stephen Brookes wrote in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The spectacularly gifted cellist Frances-Marie Uitti has made a career out of demolishing musical boundaries. She has developed new techniques (most famously, playing with two bows simultaneously), collaborated with a who&#x27;s who of contemporary composers, and pushed the cello into realms of unexpected beauty and expression... Uitti showed why she might be the most interesting cellist on the planet.&quot;

==Music career==
Born in Chicago, Illinois to Finnish-American parents, Uitti graduated from Berkeley High School in 1964, where she played cello in the school orchestra. She studied classical music at Meadowmount with Ronald Leonard and Josef Gingold, Boston University with Leslie Parnas and University of Texas with George Neikrug. In Europe she worked at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana with André Navarra, winning their top award two years in a row.

Uitti invented a radically extended technique using two bows simultaneously in one hand, becoming the first to transform the cello into a four-part chordal instrument. This technique expands the harmonic and timbral possibilities of the instrument in extraordinary ways: for example, one can play simultaneously 4, 3, 2, and 1 string, with contrasting polyrhythmic articulations between the two bows. Non-adjacent strings can also be accessed. One bow can be played near the bridge while the other is near the fingerboard. She has used over 75 different tunings in her compositions using this technique, each producing new harmonic possibilities and exotic timbres plus a polyphony and independence of voices that her previous work with a single curved bow couldn&#x27;t obtain.

Early on, she combined singing with the cello and premiered Louis Andriessen&#x27;s &quot;La Voce&quot; which is dedicated to her. Other works featuring her voice include James Tenney&#x27;s concerto, &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Woman?&quot; with text by Sojourner Truth, David Dramm&#x27;s &quot;Crosshair&quot;, Rodney Sharman&#x27;s &quot;The Ecstasy of St. Teresa&quot;, Vinko Globokar&#x27;s &quot;Janus&quot;, and William Kirkpatrick&#x27;s &quot;Stations of the Cross&quot;.

Uitti has collaborated with and is the dedicatee of composers Luigi Nono, Louis Andriessen, James Tenney, Jonathan Harvey, John Cage, Karen Tanaka, Per Nørgård, Giacinto Scelsi, Elliott Sharp, György Kurtág, Richard Barrett, Guus Janssen, Jay Alan Yim, Vinko Globokar, Clarence Barlow, David Dramm, Geoffrey King, Martijn Padding, Horațiu Rădulescu, Calliope Tsoupaki, and Peter Nelson, among many others. She collaborates in duo with Mark Dresser, and with Evan Parker, Joel Ryan, Misha Mengelberg, David Wessel, and with DJ Low, Scanner, and Stansfield/Hooykaas, Marina Abramović, Steina Vasulka, Frank Scheffer.

While living in Rome, she worked closely with Giacinto Scelsi, not only as dedicatee of all the cello works, but also transcribing from his archive and improvising together from 1975 until his death in 1988. Uitti premiered his newly discovered cello concerto at the Angelica Festival, Teatro Comunale di Bologna in 2006.

She was guest professor at Oberlin Conservatory of Music for two years, and was awarded the Regents&#x27; Lectureship both at the University of California Berkeley and at University of California San Diego. She gives master classes worldwide for composers and string players at conservatories and universities including Yale, Princeton, Stanford, University of Illinois, as well as having the Fromm Foundation Fellowship to teach a residency at Harvard University.

In 2003, Uitti commissioned a custom-designed electric 6-string cello from Seattle luthier Eric Jensen, which she later enhanced ergonomically with sensors at Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT) (University of California, Berkeley) working with David Wessel and Adrian Freed and Michael Zbyszynski. She was to have returned to CNMAT in 2008 to design and construct a 12-stringless meta cello with Adrian Freed. She acquired an aluminum cello made in 1929 by the Pfretzner luthier family. She has recorded and performed on the Mongolian Morin Choor, a custom built Uzbeki Sato, and an original Stroh one-stringed cello.

As inventor Uitti has developed a difference-tone resonator that strongly amplifies the beating and subtle &quot;ghost tone&quot; produced by chordal playing. She has redesigned and built 5 prototype-bows under guidance of bowmaker Andreas Grutter to facilitate her work with two bows in one hand. At the request of Scelsi, she redesigned the metallic mutes used in the String Quartet #2 and Triphon for solo cello.

Uitti was Fellow at Civitella Ranieri in 2021 and produced 200 ceramic resonators and distortion enhancers at Cotto Etrusco for her work Stornelli Storti (working title).

She founded the Bhutan Music Foundation which supports traditional music from Bhutan, music education inside of Bhutan, and various outreach programs. The BMF awards 22 scholarships every year to children who otherwise couldn&#x27;t afford to study music. Recently the Prins Claus Foundation awarded a grant to further outreach programs in the local schools in Thimphu.

Uitti has recorded on ECM Records, Wergo, Hathut Records, CRI, and BvHaast, JdKproductions, Cryptogramophone Records, Sargasso, and Naxos.

<text>The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Loony Party was a minor political party in the United Kingdom.

Founded in 2000, the group split from the Official Monster Raving Loony Party after the death of Screaming Lord Sutch. Stephen Ingle claims that it was formed by Librarians. It was initially based in Cannock, at the Laughing Leopards pub, which was run by its joint deputy leader, while its leader was Chris &quot;Screwy&quot; Driver.

Driver was elected to Queenborough Town Council, on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, in 2000 as a Monster Raving Loony candidate, and then in his new party colours was voted in as Mayor of Queenborough in 2002. In elections to Swale Borough Council in 2003, one of the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Loony Party candidates polled more than a member of the Liberal Democrats.

At the 2005 General Election the party fielded one candidate, in Sittingbourne and Sheppey, who managed to poll more votes than the Veritas candidate. It was deregistered in August 2007.

The party&#x27;s main policies included free beer and sex for pensioners, and the construction of laughter clinics.

<doc id="424841" wikidata="Q2454891" url="?curid=424841" title="Water trough">
<text>A water trough (British terminology), or track pan (American terminology), is a device to enable a steam locomotive to replenish its water supply while in motion. It consists of a long trough filled with water, lying between the rails. When a steam locomotive passes over the trough, a water scoop can be lowered, and the speed of forward motion forces water into the scoop, up the scoop pipe and into the tanks or locomotive tender.

==Origin==

Steam locomotives consume a considerable amount of water, and the tender or side tanks need to be replenished at intervals. Traditionally the engine water was replenished during station stops, but if it was desired to run long distances without stopping, the requirement to take water was a significant limitation. &quot;The Railway Magazine&quot; reported a development by John Ramsbottom:

Ramsbottom arranged some experiments and showed that the forward motion of a scoop in a trough of water would force water up a connected pipe and into a tank. He calculated the quasi-static head produced by the forward motion:

The track is raised a little over a short distance each end of the trough, so that the engine, and the scoop which may already be lowered, descend into the trough:

The first installation was brought into use on 23 June 1860 at Mochdre, Conwy, on the London and North Western Railway&#x27;s (LNWR) North Wales Coast Line, midway between Chester and Holyhead.

The siting of the troughs requires a long enough length of straight and level track (although very large radius curves could be accommodated). For instance, the LNWR placed water troughs within the Standedge Tunnels, as they were the only sufficiently straight and level portion of the line between Huddersfield and Manchester. There must be a good water supply nearby. In hard water areas, water softening plant may have been considered necessary.

==Locomotive equipment==

A &quot;scoop&quot; was fitted to the underside of the locomotive&#x27;s tender (or the locomotive itself in the case of tank locomotives) in such a way that it could be raised or lowered, by a hand-operated screw or a power mechanism. The scoop fed into a vertical pipe that discharged into the water tank. The scoop was purposely made of light construction so that, should it strike an obstruction, it tore away, causing no serious damage to the locomotive or its trailing vehicles. 

Tender locomotives generally picked up in the forward direction only. Tank locomotives were not usually fitted with water scoops, but some larger tank locomotives, such as on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, were and in these cases they were equipped to pick up in either direction.

The scoop needed to be lowered at speed at the correct location – shortly before the start of the trough – and raised again when either the tank is full, or at the end of the trough. Failure to raise the scoop promptly when the tanks are full would resulted in large volumes of water being expelled from the vents, soaking the tender and footplate. The fireman therefore had to observe the water level indicator (a float in the tank, connected to an external pointer) carefully and be poised to retract the scoop as necessary. Lineside indicators were provided to assist engine crews in determining the location; in the UK it was a large white rectangular board with a black horizontal zigzag marking. On American railroads, illuminated trackside signals were employed for night-time usage, to indicate the start and approaching end of the track pan.

A 1934 report said that the LMS had carried out tests recently and introduced a deflector ahead of the scoop to pile water in the centre of the trough, thus reducing spillage out of the troughs by about 400 gallons (1,800 L) (about 20%) for each use.

Venting on the tender needed to be free to allow a high rate of release of expelled air from the tank.

==Operational considerations==
The LNWR quickly installed water troughs at other locations, but other companies were slow to adopt the new apparatus. The Great Western Railway (GWR) did so from 1895, and subsequently all the major railways in England, with the exception of the lines south of the River Thames, installed the equipment.

Taking water at speed results in considerable spray behind the scoop; this risks drenching passengers in the leading vehicles, and in Great Britain it was customary for the guard or other traincrew to warn passengers in the first coach to keep the windows closed. In one incident on the LMS railway in Britain, two streamlined trains with &quot;Coronation&quot; class locomotives happened to pass each other at a water trough when one of the trains was taking on water. The other train suffered broken windows due to lumps of tender coal scattered by the spray and the complaints from drenched passengers caused the management to retimetable the trains to ensure this could not happen again. Vaughan says that the Royal Train when conveying royalty was not permitted to be passed by another train in a section where there was a water trough.

Vaughan states that the GWR investigated the effectiveness of varying train speed, and found that was the optimum speed; but water could be picked up successfully as low as . At that speed could be picked up in , but Vaughan suggests that this is a low theoretical figure, and that it overlooks the bow wave effect which enables a greater take-up rate. There was a significant resistance to the forward motion of the engine during the process, enough to require special care by the driver to avoid problems on unfitted freight trains.

The considerable water spray made track maintenance difficult, and the physical trough equipment limited access for packing sleepers, exacerbating the problem. In very cold weather the water would freeze, preventing water pick-up, unless a heating apparatus was installed.

Track pans normally took a while to fill up after being used, so they could not be used immediately by a close-following train. They were also expensive to maintain, generally requiring a pumping station, a lot of plumbing, and an employee or two to maintain. They were thus only justified on a railroad with a high traffic volume. In the United States, several big eastern railroads used them, primarily the New York Central Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad.

They could be found on all main lines in Britain, except on the Southern Railway. They were removed as use of steam trains decreased. When the Aber troughs were removed in 1967, the only remaining troughs were in north-west England and Scotland.

==Use by diesel locomotives==
Diesel locomotives were introduced in the United Kingdom by British Railways in the 1950s, working alongside steam traction until 1968. Passenger vehicles were heated by steam from the locomotive boiler at that time, and the early diesel locomotives were provided with auxiliary boilers to provide the steam. Locomotives intended for long non-stop runs (such as the Class 40 and Class 55) were fitted with water scoops to allow them to replenish the steam generator&#x27;s water supply from troughs. The withdrawal of steam traction and the introduction of rolling stock with electric rather than steam heating removed the need for such equipment on later types and scoop-equipped locomotives had their scoops removed.

==Locations==
At its creation at the start of 1923, the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) inherited ten sets of water troughs from its constituents, and also became a co-owner (with the Great Western Railway) of one more.
A map showing the location of GWR troughs in the 1930s is reproduced in the book &#x27;The Great Western Railway&#x27;. They are typically at spacings of , but with some wide variations. There are a few instances of trough locations very close to major stopping points; for example Fox&#x27;s Wood, near St Annes Park, two miles from Bristol Temple Meads; however this was installed when trains to South Wales travelled via Bath and Filton, using these troughs; after the opening of the South Wales direct route via Badminton, numerous passenger and goods trains continued to use the route and required the troughs. The lengths are also given: they vary from 524 to 620 yards (480 to 570 metres).

The locations were (in 1936):

Similar 1934 maps showed troughs on the main East, Midland and West Coast routes from London to Scotland:



Other British troughs are mentioned in articles on Ipswich and Tivetshall railway stations (Norfolk).

==Continuous water trough supply==
The &quot;Railway Magazine&quot; writer, quoted above, contemplated nearly-continuous water troughs, avoiding the transport of large quantities of water in the train:

The question has been discussed as to whether it would be possible to have a continuous supply of water all along the lines, and so obviate the necessity for tenders. Some years ago a writer in the &quot;Engineer&quot; put it in this way; One ton of coal will last a heavy goods train 40 miles [64 km], and an express nearly 100 miles [160 km]; but from 6 to 8 or 9 tons of water are required for the same distance. If the tender were done away with, the coals, and a small tank with a capacity of forty or fifty gallons [180 or 230 L] to receive the water, and from which to supply the boiler, would have to be carried on the engine. After allowing for these, 15 or 20 tons of paying load might be added to the train, which would be an advantage additional to the primary object—the saving of time.

==Alternative techniques==

Railway companies were well aware of the cost of installing and maintaining this equipment, and the provision of tenders with a large water capacity was an alternative employed in some cases. The London and South Western Railway in England used large 8-wheel tenders nicknamed &quot;water carts&quot;.

<doc id="424843" wikidata="Q161545" url="?curid=424843" title="South Schleswig Voters' Association">
<text>The South Schleswig Voters&#x27; Association (, SSW; , SSV) is a regionalist political party in Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany. The party represents the Danish and Frisian minorities of the state.

As a party representing a national minority, the SSW declines to identify itself with a scale of left–right politics but models its policies on the Nordic model, which often means favouring a strong welfare state, while favouring a more free-market labour policy than the German social market economy model. In 2011 it was defined as socially liberal by multiple authors. The SSW is represented in the Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein and several regional and municipal councils. The party contested federal elections in Germany until 1961, before returning in 2021, where it obtained one seat, and in 2025, where it once again obtained a seat in the Bundestag.

As a party for the national Danish minority in Southern Schleswig, the SSW is not subject to the general requirement of passing a 5% vote threshold to gain proportional seats in either the state parliament (Landtag) or the federal German parliament (Bundestag). In the most recent 2022 state election, the SSW received 5.7% of the votes and four seats. In the 2021 federal elections, the SSW stood in a federal election for the first time since 1961; the official final result gave them one seat, making Stefan Seidler a Member of Parliament, their first such member since the 1953 federal elections.

==History==
In the 2005 state election, the SSW received 3.6% (two seats). This was enough for the SSW to hold the balance of power between the national parties of the left and right, and the SSW chose to support a coalition of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and The Greens, without joining the coalition itself. This resulted in criticism from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and from German national conservative circles, who asserted that since the SSW had been granted a special status, it was obliged to defend only minority interests, and that its status should be revoked if the SSW behaved like a &quot;regular&quot; party. The SSW representatives, however, insisted on the full value of their parliamentary seats and their equal rights as German citizens. One particular point was that the SSW had taken a strong position on educational principles in the state (abolishing the traditional German system of dividing pupils according to academic ability already after the 4th grade into different types of secondary schools). The CDU argued that since there were separate Danish-language schools, it was unreasonable for the SSW to involve itself in the affairs of the public schools.

As the planned SPD-Greens coalition did not make it into office after the 2009 state election, a centre-right coalition was formed between the CDU and Free Democratic Party (FDP), and the SSW joined the opposition.

In the 2012 state election, the SSW gained 4.6% of all votes and three seats in the state Landtag. A coalition of the SPD, Greens and SSW was concluded in June 2012, and the former parliamentary leader, Anke Spoorendonk, was appointed Minister for Culture, Justice and European Affairs. This was the first time in German history that a minority party had participated in a state government. The new coalition government had plenty of nicknames, for instance &quot;Dänen-Ampel&quot; (&quot;Dane-traffic light&quot;), &quot;Schleswig-Holstein-Ampel&quot;, &quot;rot-grün-blaue Koalition&quot; or &quot;rød-grøn-blå koalition&quot; (red–green–blue alliance), &quot;Küstenkoalition&quot; (Coastal alliance) and &quot;Nord-Ampel&quot; (North traffic light).

In the 2017 state election, the SSW backed to 3.3% of the votes, but retained three seats in the Landtag. However, since the government coalition parties lost their Landtag majority, a new government was formed without the SSW, which again joined the opposition. Exempt from the threshold of 5%, it won a seat in the 2021 German federal election with 0.1% of the vote nationwide, its first federal seat since the inaugural 1949 West German federal election. Though unlikely to change the balance of power in any way, Stefan Seidler sits as its Member of the German Bundestag.

In the 2022 state election, the SSW again ran with Lars Harms as its top candidate. With 5.7%, the SSW achieved more than five percent of the vote for the first time since the state election in 1950. At the end of 2024, Lars Harms resigned from his state parliament mandate and retired from politics. Michael Schunck took his place in the state parliament. Christian Dirschauer took over the parliamentary group chairmanship in the state parliament. For the 2025 federal election, the SSW aims to defend its seat in the Bundestag and hopes to gain a second seat. The party expects to need around 40,000 votes for the first seat and a total of 110,000 votes (6% of the second votes in Schleswig-Holstein) for the second seat.

In the 2025 German federal election they held their seat from the previous election, putting them in sixth place in terms of seats in the Bundestag.

<text>Dorchester was a coastal passenger steamship requisitioned and operated by the
War Shipping Administration (WSA) in January 1942 for wartime use as a troop ship allocated to United States Army requirements. The ship was operated for WSA by its agent Atlantic, Gulf &amp; West Indies Steamship Lines (Agwilines). The ship was in convoy SG 19 from New York to Greenland transiting the Labrador Sea when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat on February 3, 1943. The ship sank with loss of 674 of the 904 on board with one of the 230 survivors lost after rescue. The story of four Army chaplains, known as the &quot;Four Chaplains&quot; or the &quot;Immortal Chaplains,&quot; who all gave away their life jackets to save others before they died, gained fame and led to many memorials.

==Commercial service==
&quot;Dorchester&quot;, one of three identical ships, the first being (torpedoed and sunk August 27, 1942) and the last being , was built for the Merchants and Miners Transportation Company by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. Keel laying was September 10, 1925 with launching on March 20, 1926, and delivery on July 17, 1926. The ship was designed for the coastwise trade with a capacity for 302 first class and 12 steerage passengers for a total of 314 with a crew of 90 along the East coast between Miami and Boston. Propulsion was by a 3,000 horsepower, triple expansion steam engine supplied by four oil fired Scotch boilers with steam at 220 pounds pressure driving a single propeller for a speed of .

Passengers were provided three decks, two promenade decks and the boat deck, with four suites having private baths and thirty rooms with beds, ninety-eight with double berths and eight with single berths with most opening onto both the corridor and deck and all had &quot;European style&quot; telephones with receiver and transmitter in one handset. Public spaces included a dance pavilion and sun parlor in addition to the typical lounge and smoking rooms. Cargo of about 3,300 tons was all handled through side ports rather than deck hatches. Refrigerated spaces of for provisions, including ice cream storage, was provided to six compartments cooled by a 4-ton Brunswick compressor. A separate chilled pantry had of storage.

==World War II==
The ship was delivered by Merchants and Miners Transportation Company to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) at Baltimore on January 24, 1942, for operation by Atlantic, Gulf &amp; West Indies Steamship Lines (Agwilines) as agent for WSA and allocated to United States Army requirements. &quot;Dorchester&quot; was converted to a troopship by Agwilines in New York, and fitted with additional lifeboats and life rafts, as well as four 20 mm guns, a 3&quot;/50 caliber gun fore, and a 4&quot;/50 caliber gun aft.

&quot;Dorchester&quot; entered service in February 1942, crewed by many of her former officers, including her master initially, and a contingent of Navy Armed Guards to man the guns and to handle communications. The ship was neither owned nor bareboat chartered by the Army and thus not officially designated a United States Army Transport (USAT). The allocation to Army requirements, transport of Army personnel and presence of the Army administrative staff under the Transport Commander in command of embarked troops, led some to assume the ship was an Army transport.

===Loss===
On January 23, 1943, &quot;Dorchester&quot; left New York harbor, bound for the Army Command Base at Narsarsuaq in southern Greenland. SG-19 consisted of six ships: SS &quot;Dorchester&quot;, two merchant ships (SS &quot;Lutz&quot; and SS &quot;Biscaya&quot;) that were leased by the United States from the Norwegian government-in-exile, and their escorts, the small United States Coast Guard cutters , (both 165 feet), and (240 feet).

During the early morning hours of February 3, 1943, at 12:55, &quot;Dorchester&quot; was torpedoed by . The damage was severe, boiler power was lost, and there was inadequate steam to sound the full 6-whistle signal to abandon ship, and &quot;Dorchester&quot; sank by the bow in about 20 minutes. Loss of power prevented the crew from sending a radio distress signal, and no rockets or flares were launched to alert the escorts. A severe list prevented launch of some port side lifeboats, and some lifeboats capsized through overcrowding. Survivors in the water were so stiff from cold they could not even grasp the cargo nets on rescue vessels. The crew of &quot;Escanaba&quot; employed a new &quot;retriever&quot; rescue technique whereby swimmers clad in wet suits swam to victims in the water and secured a line to them so they could be hauled onto the ship. By this method, &quot;Escanaba&quot; saved 133 men (one died later) and &quot;Comanche&quot; saved 97 men of the 904 aboard &quot;Dorchester&quot;. The sinking of &quot;Dorchester&quot; was the worst single loss of American personnel of any American convoy during World War II.

Life jackets offered little protection from hypothermia, which killed most men in the water. Water temperature was and air temperature was . When additional rescue ships arrived on February 4 &quot;hundreds of dead bodies were seen floating on the water, kept up by their life jackets.&quot;

===The Four Chaplains===

&quot;Dorchester&quot; is best remembered today for the actions of four of the Army officers among the military personnel being transported overseas for duty: the Four Chaplains who died because they gave up their life jackets to save others. These chaplains included Methodist minister George L. Fox, Reformed Church in America minister Clark V. Poling, Catholic Church priest John P. Washington and Rabbi Alexander B. Goode. Congress established February 3 as &quot;Four Chaplains Day&quot; to commemorate this act of heroism, and on July 14, 1960, created the Chaplain&#x27;s Medal for Heroism, presented posthumously to the next of kin of each of the chaplains by Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker at Fort Myer, Virginia on January 18, 1961.

====Commemoration on US postage====

In 1948 the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative stamp in honor of the heroism and sacrifice of the chaplains. It was designed by Louis Schwimmer, the head of the Art Department of the New York branch of the Post Office. This stamp was highly unusual, because until 2011, U.S. stamps were not normally issued in honor of someone other than a President of the United States until at least ten years after his or her death.

The stamp went through three revisions before the final design was chosen. None of the names of the chaplains were included on the stamp, nor were their faiths (although the faiths had been listed on one of the earlier designs): instead, the words on the stamp were &quot;These Immortal Chaplains...Interfaith in Action.&quot; Another phrase included in an earlier design that was not part of the final stamp was &quot;died to save men of all faiths.&quot; By the omission of their names, the stamp commemorated the event, rather than the individuals &quot;per se&quot;, thus obfuscating the ten-year rule in the same way as later did stamps honoring Neil Armstrong in 1969 and Buzz Aldrin in 1994, both of whom were still alive.

===Notable passengers and crew===
The American writer Jack Kerouac served on &quot;Dorchester&quot;, where he befriended an African-American cook named &quot;Old Glory,&quot; who died when the ship sank after the torpedo attack. Kerouac would have also been on the ship during the attack, but for a telegram he received from coach Lou Little, asking him to return to Columbia University to play football.

<doc id="424847" wikidata="Q5475055" url="?curid=424847" title="Four Chaplains">
<text>The Four Chaplains, also referred to as the Immortal Chaplains or the &quot;Dorchester&quot; Chaplains, were four chaplains who died rescuing civilian and military personnel as the American troop ship sank on February 3, 1943, in what has been referred to as the one of the worst sea disasters of World War II.

The &quot;Dorchester,&quot; a civilian liner, had been converted for military service in World War II as a troop transport of the War Shipping Administration. The ship left New York on January 23, 1943, en route to Greenland, carrying approximately 900 as part of a convoy of three ships escorted by Coast Guard Cutters &quot;Tampa&quot;, &quot;Escanaba&quot;, and &quot;Comanche&quot;. During the early morning hours of February 3, the vessel was torpedoed by the off Newfoundland in the North Atlantic. The chaplains helped the other soldiers board lifeboats and gave up their own life jackets when the supply ran out. The chaplains joined arms, said prayers, and sang hymns as they went down with the ship.

The impact of the chaplains&#x27; story was deep, with many memorials and extensive coverage in the media. Each of the four chaplains was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Purple Heart. The chaplains were nominated for the Medal of Honor, but were ineligible as they had not engaged in combat with the enemy. Instead, Congress created a medal for them, with the same weight and importance as the Medal of Honor.

==The chaplains==
The relatively new chaplains all held the rank of first lieutenant. They included Methodist minister the Reverend George L. Fox, Reform Rabbi Alexander D. Goode (PhD), Catholic priest Father John P. Washington, and Reformed Church in America minister the Reverend Clark V. Poling. Their backgrounds, personalities, and denominations were different, although Goode, Poling and Washington had all served as leaders in the Boy Scouts of America. They met at the Army Chaplains School at Harvard University, where they prepared for assignments in the European theater, sailing on board &quot;Dorchester&quot; to report to their new assignments.

===George Lansing Fox===

George L. Fox was born March 15, 1900, in Lewistown, Pennsylvania, the eldest of eight children. When he was 17, he left school and lied about his age in order to join the Army to serve in World War I. He joined the ambulance corps in 1917, assigned to Camp Newton D. Baker in Texas. On December 3, 1917, George embarked from Camp Merritt, New Jersey, and boarded the USS &quot;Huron&quot; en route to France. As a medical corps assistant, he was highly decorated for bravery and was awarded the Silver Star, Purple Heart and the French Croix de Guerre.

Upon his discharge, he returned home to Altoona, where he completed high school. He entered Moody Bible Institute in Illinois in 1923. He and Isadora G. Hurlbut of Vermont were married in 1923, when he began his religious career as an itinerant preacher in the Methodist faith. He later graduated from Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, served as a student pupil in Rye, New Hampshire, and then studied at the Boston University School of Theology, where he was ordained a Methodist minister on June 10, 1934. He served parishes in Thetford, Union Village, and Gilman, Vermont, and was appointed state chaplain and historian for the American Legion in Vermont.

In 1942, Fox volunteered to serve as an Army chaplain, accepting his appointment July 24, 1942. He began active duty on August 8, 1942, the same day his son Wyatt enlisted in the Marine Corps. After Army Chaplains School at Harvard, he reported to the 411th Coast Artillery Battalion at Camp Davis. He was then reunited with Chaplains Goode, Poling and Washington at Camp Myles Standish in Taunton, Massachusetts, where they prepared to depart for Europe on board the &quot;Dorchester&quot;.

===Alexander David Goode===
Reform Rabbi Alexander D. Goode (PhD) was born in Brooklyn, New York, on May 10, 1911, the son of Rabbi Hyman Goodekowitz. He was raised in Washington, D.C., attending Eastern High School, eventually deciding to follow his father&#x27;s footsteps by studying for the rabbinate at Hebrew Union College (HUC), where he graduated with a B.H. degree in 1937. He later received his PhD from Johns Hopkins University in 1940. While studying for the rabbinate at HUC, he worked at the Washington Hebrew Congregation during summer breaks.

He originally applied to become a Navy chaplain in January 1941, but was not accepted. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, he applied to the Army, receiving his appointment as a chaplain on July 21, 1942. Chaplain Goode went on active duty on August 9, 1942, and was selected for the Chaplains School at Harvard. Chaplain Goode was then assigned to the 333rd Fighter Squadron in Goldsboro, North Carolina. In October 1942, he was transferred to Camp Myles Standish in Taunton, Massachusetts, and reunited with Chaplains Fox, Poling and Washington, who had been among his classmates at Harvard.

===Clark Vandersall Poling===

Clark V. Poling was born August 7, 1910, in Columbus, Ohio, the son of evangelical minister Daniel A. Poling, who was rebaptized in 1936 as a Baptist minister. Clark Poling studied at Yale University&#x27;s Divinity School in New Haven, Connecticut and graduated with his B.D. degree in 1936. He was ordained in the Reformed Church in America, and served first in the First Church of Christ, New London, Connecticut, and then as pastor of the First Reformed Church, in Schenectady, New York. He married Betty Jung.

With the outbreak of World War II, Poling decided to enter the Army, wanting to face the same danger as others. His father, who had served as a World War I chaplain, told him chaplains risk and give their lives, too—and with that knowledge, he applied to serve as an Army chaplain, accepting an appointment on June 10, 1942, as a chaplain with the 131st Quartermaster Truck Regiment, reporting to Camp Shelby, Hattiesburg, Mississippi, on June 25. Later he reported to Army Chaplains School at Harvard, where he met Chaplains Fox, Goode, and Washington. Clark V. Poling&#x27;s father, Daniel A. Poling was pastor of Grace Baptist Church of Philadelphia when the &quot;Dorchester&quot; was sunk. The church had been planning a memorial for its well-known pastor Russell Conwell but decided to put all efforts towards creating the Chapel of the Four Chaplains in the basement of the church instead.

===John Patrick Washington===

John P. Washington was born in Newark, New Jersey, on July 18, 1908. He studied at Seton Hall, in South Orange, New Jersey, to complete his high school and college courses in preparation for the Catholic priesthood. He graduated in 1931 with an A.B., entering Immaculate Conception Seminary in Darlington, New Jersey, where he received his minor orders on May 26, 1933. He served as a subdeacon at all the Solemn Masses and later became a deacon on December 25, 1934. He was elected prefect of his class and was ordained a priest on June 15, 1935.

Father Washington&#x27;s first parish was at St. Genevieve&#x27;s, in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He later served at St. Venantius for a year. In 1938, he was assigned to St. Stephen&#x27;s in Kearny, New Jersey. Shortly after the Pearl Harbor attack of December 7, 1941, he received his appointment as a chaplain in the United States Army, reporting for active duty on May 9, 1942. He was named chief of the Chaplains&#x27; Reserve Pool, in Ft. Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, and in June 1942, he was assigned to the 76th Infantry Division in Ft. George Meade, Maryland. In November 1942, he reported to Camp Myles Standish in Taunton, Massachusetts, and met Chaplains Fox, Goode and Poling at Chaplains School at Harvard.

==The ship and its sinking==
The &quot;Dorchester&quot; had been a 5,649 ton civilian liner, 368 feet long with a 52-foot beam and a single funnel, originally built in 1926 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, for the Merchants and Miners Line, operating ships from Baltimore to Florida, carrying both freight and passengers. It was the third of four liners being built for the Line.

The ship was converted for military service in World War II as a War Shipping Administration troop transport operated by Atlantic, Gulf &amp; West Indies Steamship Lines (Agwilines) allocated to United States Army requirements. The conversion was done in New York by the Atlantic, Gulf, and West Indies (AGWI) SS Company, and included additional lifeboats and liferafts; guns (a 3-inch gun forward, a 4-inch gun aft, and four 20 mm guns); and changes to the large windows in the pilot house so that they would be reduced to slits to afford more protection.

Designed for 314 civilian passengers and 90 crew, she was able to carry slightly more than 900 military passengers and crew.

&quot;Dorchester&quot; left New York on January 23, 1943, en route to Greenland, carrying the four chaplains and approximately 900 others, as part of a convoy of three ships (SG-19 convoy). Most of the military personnel were not told the ship&#x27;s ultimate destination. The convoy was escorted by Coast Guard Cutters &quot;Tampa&quot;, &quot;Escanaba&quot;, and &quot;Comanche&quot;.
The ship&#x27;s captain, Hans J. Danielsen, had been alerted that Coast Guard sonar had detected a submarine. Because German U-boats were monitoring sea lanes and had attacked and sunk ships earlier during the war, Captain Danielsen had the ship&#x27;s crew on a state of high alert even before he received that information, ordering the men to sleep in their clothing and keep their life jackets on. &quot;Many soldiers sleeping deep in the ship&#x27;s hold disregarded the order because of the engine&#x27;s heat. Others ignored it because the life jackets were uncomfortable.&quot;

During the early morning hours of February 3, 1943, at 12:55 am, the vessel was torpedoed by the off Newfoundland in the North Atlantic.

The torpedo knocked out the &quot;Dorchester&quot;″s electrical system, leaving the ship dark. Panic set in among the men on board, many of them trapped below decks. The chaplains sought to calm the men and organize an orderly evacuation of the ship, and helped guide wounded men to safety. As life jackets were passed out to the men, the supply ran out before each man had one. The chaplains removed their own life jackets and gave them to others. They helped as many men as they could into lifeboats, and then linked arms and, saying prayers and singing hymns, went down with the ship.

According to some reports, survivors could hear different languages mixed in the prayers of the chaplains, including Jewish prayers in Hebrew and Catholic prayers in Latin. Only 230 of the 904 men aboard the ship were rescued. Life jackets offered little protection from hypothermia, which killed most men in the water. The water temperature was and the air temperature was . By the time additional rescue ships arrived, &quot;hundreds of dead bodies were seen floating on the water, kept up by their life jackets.&quot;

==Cultural impact==

==Remembrance==
===Awards===

On December 19, 1944, all four chaplains were posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and the Distinguished Service Cross.

Additionally, members of Congress later authorized a special medal, the Four Chaplains&#x27; Medal, approved by a unanimous act of Congress on July 14, 1960, through Public Law 86-656. The medals were presented posthumously to the next of kin of each of the four chaplains by Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker at Fort Myer, Virginia, on January 18, 1961.

===Four Chaplains Day===

Ceremonies and services are held each year on or around the February 3 Four Chaplains Day by numerous military and civilian groups and organizations. In 1998, February 3 of that year was established by senate resolution 169–98 as Four Chaplains Day to commemorate the 55th anniversary of the sinking of United States Army transport &quot;Dorchester&quot; and subsequent heroism of these men. Some state or city officials commemorate the day with official proclamations, sometimes including the order that flags fly at half-mast in memory of the fallen chaplains. In some cases, official proclamations establish observances at other times: for example, North Dakota legislation requests that the governor issue an annual proclamation establishing the first Sunday in February as Four Chaplains Sunday.

Civitan International, a worldwide volunteer association of service clubs, holds an interfaith Clergy Appreciation Week every year. The event honors the sacrifice of the Four Chaplains by encouraging citizens to thank the clergy that serve their communities. The First Parish Church (Unitarian Universalist) in Dorchester, Massachusetts, hosts an ecumenical Service of the Four Chaplains each January. The American Legion commemorates the day through services and programs at many posts throughout the nation.

On February 14, 2002, as part of the annual award of the Immortal Chaplains Prize for Humanity, a special reconciliation meeting took place between survivors of both the American and German sides of the sinking of the &quot;Dorchester&quot;. Kurt Röser and Gerhard Buske, who had been part of the crew of the German U-boat that had torpedoed the &quot;Dorchester&quot; met with three &quot;Dorchester&quot; survivors, Ben Epstein, Walter Miller, and David Labadie, as well as Dick Swanson, who had been on board the Coast Guard Cutter &quot;Comanche&quot;, escorting the &quot;Dorchester&quot;″s convoy.

On February 3, 2011, the Library of Congress Veterans History Project and the United States Navy Memorial co-hosted a special program at the memorial, in Washington, D.C.

The Jewish Chaplains Monument at Arlington National Cemetery&#x27;s Chaplains&#x27; Hill was dedicated on October 24, 2011. The monument honors 14 Jewish chaplains who died during their military service. The monument is a granite upright with a bronze plaque, similar to the three other monuments at the site honoring Catholic, Protestant and World War I chaplains. Rabbi Goode&#x27;s name is the first listed on the plaque. The Jewish Chaplains Monument was approved by the United States Congress in May 2011, and the monument itself, designed by Debora Jackson of Long Island, New York, was reviewed and approved by the U.S. Fine Arts Commission on June 16, 2011. The dedication ceremony was held in Arlington&#x27;s Memorial Amphitheater. The ceremony was attended by Ernie Heaton, who survived the &quot;Dorchester&quot; sinking, and Richard Swanson who was on the Coast Guard rescue team.

===U.S. postage stamp===

The chaplains were honored with a commemorative stamp that was issued in 1948, and was designed by Louis Schwimmer, the head of the Art Department of the New York branch of the U.S. Post Office Department (now called the USPS). This stamp is highly unusual, because until 2011, U.S. stamps were not normally issued in honor of someone other than a president of the United States until at least ten years after his or her death.

The stamp went through three revisions before the final design was chosen. None of the names of the chaplains were included on the stamp, nor were their faiths (although the faiths had been listed on one of the earlier designs): instead, the words on the stamp were &quot;These Immortal Chaplains ... Interfaith in Action&quot;. Another phrase included in an earlier design that was not part of the final stamp was &quot;died to save men of all faiths&quot;. By the omission of their names, the stamp commemorated the event, rather than the individuals &quot;per se&quot;, thus obfuscating the ten-year rule in the same way as did later stamps honoring Neil Armstrong in 1969 and Buzz Aldrin in 1994.

===Chapel of Four Chaplains===
The Chapel of the Four Chaplains was dedicated on February 3, 1951, by President Harry S. Truman to honor these chaplains of different faiths in the basement of Grace Baptist Church of Philadelphia. In his dedication speech, the President said, &quot;This interfaith shrine ... will stand through long generations to teach Americans that as men can die heroically as brothers so should they live together in mutual faith and goodwill.&quot;

The chapel dedication included a reminder that the interfaith team represented by the Four Chaplains was unusual. Although the chapel was dedicated as an all-faiths chapel, no Catholic priest took part in the dedication ceremony, because, as Msgr. Thomas McCarthy of the National Catholic Welfare Conference explained to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;canon law forbids joint worship.&quot;

In addition to supporting work that exemplifies the idea of &quot;Interfaith in Action&quot;, recalling the story of the Four Chaplains, the chapel presents awards to individuals whose work reflects interfaith goals. 1984 was the first time that the award went to a military chaplain team composed of a rabbi, priest, and minister, recalling in a special way the four chaplains themselves, when the Rabbi Louis Parris Hall of Heroes Gold Medallion was presented to Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff; Catholic priest Fr. George Pucciarelli; and Protestant minister Danny Wheeler—the three chaplains present at the scene of the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing. The story of these three United States Navy chaplains was itself memorialized in a speech by President Ronald Reagan, on April 12, 1984.

In 1972, Grace Baptist Church moved to Blue Bell and sold the building to Temple University two years later. Temple University eventually decided to renovate the building as the Temple Performing Arts Center. In February 2001, the Chapel of the Four Chaplains moved to the chapel at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.

===Memorial foundations===
* The Four Chaplains Memorial Foundation, the only national 501(c)(3) charity related to the Four Chaplains&#x27; legacy, is housed at the former U.S. Naval Chapel located at the former South Philadelphia Navy Yard. Its official mission statement is &quot;to further the cause of &#x27;unity without uniformity&#x27; by encouraging goodwill and cooperation among all people. The organization achieves its mission by advocating for and honoring people whose deeds symbolize the legacy of the Four Chaplains aboard the U.S.A.T. &quot;Dorchester&quot; in 1943.&quot; In addition to its other goals and objectives, it supports memorial services that honor the memory of the chaplains and tell their story by publishing &quot;Guidelines for Four Chaplains Interfaith Memorial Services&quot;. Additionally, it sponsors an Emergency Chaplains Corps to provide support for first responders in disaster situations, and scholarship competitions for graduating high school seniors, focusing on the values of &quot;inclusion, cooperation, and unity&quot; exemplified by the Four Chaplains story. The competitions include a National Art Scholarship contest, a National Essay Scholarship contest, and a National Project Lifesaver Scholarship contest.
* The Four Chaplains Memorial of York County, Pennsylvania, was incorporated in 2018 after more than 25 years of annual remembrances of the Four Chaplains. The York County group came together due to the connection the community had with Rabbi Goode who served a congregation in York prior to his service on the &quot;Dorchester&quot;. The group holds an annual breakfast event that honors the Four Chaplains, presents legion of honor awards to deserving community members and raises scholarship funds for students from the Goode Middle School in York.
* The Immortal Chaplains Foundation was incorporated in October 1997 as a Minnesota non-profit corporation. The original concept for the foundation was from David Fox, nephew of Chaplain George Fox, and Rosalie Goode Fried, the daughter of Chaplain Alexander Goode. The organization&#x27;s goal is &quot;to honor individuals, both past and present, whose lives exemplify the compassion of the four &#x27;Immortal Chaplains&#x27; and who have risked all to protect others of different faith or ethnicity.&quot; The group presents an annual Prize for Humanity, &quot;to broaden national and international awareness of the legacy of the four &#x27;Immortal Chaplains, &quot;to inspire youth to the values of the four &#x27;Immortal Chaplains, and &quot;to find new partners and ways to tell this story and preserve the legacy&quot;. At the 1999 award ceremony, held in Minnesota, South African Bishop Desmond Tutu helped present Prizes for Humanity that included posthumous awards for Amy Biehl, an American Stanford University student and Fulbright scholar who was stabbed to death in South Africa while working to establish a legal education center; and Charles W. David, an African-American Coast Guardsman on board the Coast Guard Cutter &quot;Comanche&quot;, who rescued many of the &quot;Dorchester&quot; survivors, later dying from pneumonia as a result of his efforts. The establishment of the Immortal Chaplains Foundation included some controversy, when the Chapel of Four Chaplains sued Fox to prevent him and his new group from using the phrase &quot;The Four Chaplains&quot; or the image of them that appeared on the U.S. postage stamp.

===Chapels and sanctuaries===
* Immortal Chaplains Memorial Sanctuary – On the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in Long Beach, California, and operated by the Immortal Chaplains Foundation. The foundation was founded by the chaplains&#x27; families and survivors of the &quot;Dorchester&quot; tragedy, including three survivors of U-boat &quot;223&quot;, which sank the &quot;Dorchester&quot; on February 3, 1943. The &quot;Queen Mary&quot; transported these men to the US as POWs one year after the sinking of the &quot;Dorchester&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Dorchester&quot; (APB-46), was a &quot;Benewah&quot;-class barracks ship. Her hull classification symbol was initially to be LST-1112. She was first redesignated a General Stores Issue Ship (AKS-17) on 8 December 1944, then as a Self-propelled Barracks Ship (APB-46). Her keel was laid down by Missouri Valley Bridge and Iron Company of Evansville, Indiana. She was launched on 12 April 1945 sponsored by Mrs. J.A. Walsh, and commissioned on 15 June 1945.

==Service history==
Sailing from New Orleans 5 August 1945, &quot;Dorchester&quot; embarked troops at Pearl Harbor, then sailed to deliver cargo and receive more passengers at Eniwetok and Guam as she made her passage to Japan. On 15 October she reported for service as barracks ship at Wakayama and at Kobe from 11 February 1946 to 4 March. &quot;Dorchester&quot; then sailed for San Francisco, California, arriving 9 April.

She was placed out of commission in reserve at Vancouver, Washington on 16 October 1946. &quot;Dorchester&quot; remained in the reserve fleet until she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1973. She was sold on 1 August 1974 for conversion to commercial service. She was converted to a fish processing vessel under the name &quot;Pacific Pride&quot;. By 2002, she was owned by Trident Seafoods of Seattle, Washington, and was operating under the name &quot;Alaska Packer&quot;. She is still on their fleet listing as of February 2008.

<doc id="424851" wikidata="Q2067286" url="?curid=424851" title="Pegasos">
<text>Pegasos was sold by Genesi USA, Inc., and designed by their research and design partner bplan GmbH based in Frankfurt, Germany. It is a MicroATX motherboard powered by a PowerPC 750CXe or PowerPC 7447 microprocessor, featuring three PCI slots, one AGP slot, two Ethernet ports (10/100/1000 &amp; 10/100), USB, DDR, AC&#x27;97 sound, and FireWire. Like the PowerPC Macintosh counterparts, it boots via Open Firmware.

For hard disk drive booting the Open Firmware implementation called SmartFirmware requires an RDB boot partition that contains either an affs1 or ext2 partition. Note that any changes to the ext2 on-disc format may prevent booting. It is, however, possible to add some ext3 features so long as the volume can still be recognized as ext2.

There are two versions of the system: The Pegasos I and the Pegasos II.

== Pegasos I ==
The Pegasos I supports the IBM Microprocessor 750CXe CPU (G3), has 100 Mbit/s Ethernet onboard and uses registered 168-pin PC133 SDR-SDRAM. It was discontinued after a hardware bug in the MAI Logic ArticiaS northbridge was discovered. Later versions of the Pegasos I came with a hardware fix which was designated &quot;April&quot; (a pun on Mai meaning May in German). Further improvements were made in an &quot;April 2&quot; design which solved further problems. It has been replaced by the Pegasos II.

== Pegasos II ==
The Pegasos II uses a Marvell Discovery II MV64361 northbridge, removing the need for the &quot;April&quot; chipset fix on the previous model, and additionally offers integrated Gigabit LAN and DDR support, and the ability to use the Freescale &quot;G4&quot; processor line.

The 750CXe (G3) CPU boards do not require a cooling fan, and thus has been marketed as &quot;cool computing&quot;. The current G4 boards are based around the Freescale MPC7447 chip with a small fan. Passive cooling solutions are possible and sold with the &quot;Home Media and Communication System&quot;, which is based on Pegasos II G4.

Genesi discontinued production of the Pegasos II in 2006, as the result of new European Union legislation requiring the use of more expensive and lead-free solder under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS).

=== Open Desktop Workstation ===
The Open Desktop Workstation, or ODW, is a standardized version of the Pegasos II. It was the first open source based PowerPC computer and gave PowerPC a host/target development environment. Genesi has released the complete specifications (design and component listing) free of charge. The ODW-derived Home Media Center won the Best in Show award at the Freescale Technology Forum in 2005, have an ATI certification, and a &quot;Ready for IBM Technology&quot; certification.

== Operating system support ==
Several operating systems run on the Pegasos Platform. Genesi is very eager to support any efforts to port and optimize operating systems or applications for their computers.
* MorphOS is broadly compatible with legacy Commodore Amiga applications which profess to be &quot;OS friendly&quot; (meaning they do not access native Amiga hardware directly), as well as a growing number of native applications. Genesi is the primary sponsor for MorphOS.
* Amiga OS 4.1 support was announced by Hyperion on 31 January 2009.
* Linux distributions including Debian GNU/Linux, MontaVista Linux, openSUSE, Yellow Dog Linux, Gentoo Linux and Crux PPC are also available for the Pegasos. Support for the Pegasos as a platform device has been integrated into the Linux kernel mainline as of kernel version 2.6.13.
* Mac OS – It is possible to run the Classic Mac OS and Mac OS X on the Pegasos using Mac-on-Linux, although doing so is reportedly in violation of Apple&#x27;s EULA.
* NetBSD support introduced since release 5.0
* OpenBSD – Genesi hired a developer in 2002 to port OpenBSD to the Pegasos II. Both Pegasos I and Pegasos II boards were supported. The relationship ended poorly in 2004 with the developer not being paid for the work that he has done (due to Genesi&#x27;s cashflow problems), and due to lack of documentation from Genesi/bPlan, support was completely removed after one release cycle.
* OpenSolaris – Genesi/Freescale is initial supporter of the OpenSolaris port to PowerPC and the Pegasos II being used as the reference platform for development.
* QNX supports the Pegasos platform.
* Symobi is available as demo image.

<text>Sir Josiah John Guest, 1st Baronet (2 February 1785 – 26 November 1852), known as John Josiah Guest, was a British engineer, entrepreneur and politician.

==Early life==
Guest was born on 2 February 1785 in Dowlais, Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. He was the son of Thomas Guest, a partner in the Dowlais Iron Company, and Jemima Revel Phillips. Guest was educated at Bridgnorth Grammar School and Monmouth School.

==Career==
After attending school, he learned the trade of ironmaking in his father&#x27;s foundry at the hands of the works manager, John Evans. Guest was renowned for his ability to roll a bar of steel or cut a tram of coal as well as any of his father&#x27;s workmen. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1807, Guest inherited his father&#x27;s share of the company and developed the business, becoming sole owner of the works in 1815. By the time of his death in 1852, the Dowlais Iron Company had become the largest producer of iron in the world.

Guest was elected in 1825 as Member of Parliament for Honiton, Devon, holding the seat until the 1831 general election during the Reform Crisis. In 1832 he became the first MP for Merthyr Tydfil as a Whig, and in 1837 he launched the campaign to have the town incorporated.

In 1838, Guest was created a baronet, of Dowlais in the County of Glamorgan. After his death in 1852, Guest was succeeded by his eldest son, who was elevated to the peerage in 1880 as Baron Wimborne, of Canford Magna in the County of Dorset, on Disraeli&#x27;s initiative.

===Philanthropy===
His public works included a school at Dowlais, designed by Sir Charles Barry. Guest was a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He was the first chairman of the Taff Vale Railway.

Upon his purchase of Canford Manor in 1846, Guest set in motion the process of building new estate cottages for workers on the estate to improve living conditions. Although the first was built after his death, his wife, Charlotte Guest, and daughter-in-law oversaw the building of these &#x27;Lady Wimborne Cottages.&#x27;

===Freemasonry===
In August 1840, Guest was appointed Master of Loyal Cambrian Lodge, No. 110 in Merthyr Tydfil.

==Personal life==

On 11 March 1817, Guest married Maria Rankin but their marriage was short-lived, Maria dying just nine months later in January 1818. On 29 July 1833, he subsequently married Lady Charlotte Elizabeth Bertie, daughter of Albemarle Bertie, 9th Earl of Lindsey.

Together, they had five sons and five daughters, including:
* Charlotte Maria Guest (1834–1902), who married Richard Du Cane (d. 1904), brother of Edmund Frederick Du Cane.
* Ivor Bertie Guest (1835–1914), who married Lady Cornelia Henrietta Maria Spencer-Churchill (1847–1927), daughter of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough
* Katharine Gwladys Guest (1837–1926), who married the Reverend Frederick Cecil Alderson (d. 1907), son of Sir Edward Hall Alderson
* Thomas Merthyr Guest (1838–1904), who married the writer Lady Theodora Grosvenor (1840–1924), daughter of Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster
* Montague John Guest (1839–1909), a Liberal politician, who never married.
* Augustus Frederick Guest (1840–1862), who died aged 21.
* Arthur Edward Guest (1841–1898), a Conservative politician, who married Adeline Mary Chapman (d. 1931)
* Mary Enid Evelyn Guest (1843–1912), who married Sir Austen Henry Layard (1817–1894).
* Constance Rhiannon Guest (1844–1916), who married Hon. Charles George Cornwallis Eliot (1839–1901), youngest son of Edward Eliot, 3rd Earl of St Germans
* Blanche Vere Guest (1847–1919), who married Edward Ponsonby, 8th Earl of Bessborough (1851–1920).

Guest died in 1852 and was buried in an iron coffin under a red granite slab in the local St John&#x27;s Church, which had been built for him in 1827.

After his death, his widow married Charles Schreiber (1826–1884) in 1855. Schreiber was an academic who had been Ivor&#x27;s tutor in 1852. He was known for being a fine arts collector and Conservative Party politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1865 and 1884.

===Descendants===

Among his many grandchildren were: Edward Ponsonby, the 8th Earl of Bessborough, brothers Granville (1867–1942) and Montague Eliot (1870–1960), who became the 7th and 8th Earls of St Germans, respectively. There was also Frances Guest (1869–1957), known as Lady Chelmsford, who married Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford, who served as Viceroy of India, Ivor Churchill Guest (1873–1939), who became 1st Viscount Wimborne, Christian Henry Charles Guest (1874–1957), a Liberal Member of Parliament &quot;MP&quot;, Frederick &quot;Freddie&quot; Edward Guest (1875–1937), another Liberal MP, and Oscar Montague Guest (1888–1958), who was both a Liberal, and later, a Conservative MP.

<doc id="424854" wikidata="Q6942105" url="?curid=424854" title="Music of Guinea-Bissau">
<text>The [[music]] of [[Guinea-Bissau]] is most widely associated with the polyrhythmic genre of gumbe, the country&#x27;s primary musical export. Tina and tinga are other popular genres.

==National music==
Independence from Portugal was declared in 1973 after a long struggle. &quot;&quot;&quot; (&quot;This Is Our Beloved Country&quot;&quot;), composed by Xiao He with words by Amílcar Cabral, is the national anthem of Guinea-Bissau, as it was of Cape Verde until 1996.

In contrast to other Portuguese colonies like Brazil, Angola, Mozambique and Cape Verde, the fado style hardly penetrated Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s music. Popular song lyrics, however, are almost always in Guinea-Bissau Creole, a Portuguese-based creole language. They are often humorous and topical, revolving around current events and issues such as AIDS.

=== Social critique and censorship ===
Popular singers have had a stormy relationship with Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s government. José Carlos Schwarz (Zé Carlos), who criticized the administration, died in a plane crash in Havana under suspicious circumstances. Later Super Mama Djambo supported the PAIGC while mocking its perceived nepotism and corruption.

Some performers were banned by the government, including Zé Manel after he began singing &quot;Tustumunhus di aonti&quot; (&quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Testimony&quot;) in 1983, using lyrics written by Huco Monteiro, a poet. Justino Delgado, another popular singer, was arrested for criticizing President João Bernardo Vieira. Civil unrest and a small population have limited the wider influence of the country&#x27;s music.

==Traditional music==
Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s 1,596,677 people (July 2011 estimate) include Balanta (30%), Fula (20%), Manjack (14%), Mandinka (13%) and Papel (7%). The European and Mulatto population is less than 1% and there is a small Chinese population.

The word &quot;gumbe&quot; is sometimes used generically to refer to any music of the country, but it refers specifically to a unique style that fuses about ten of the country&#x27;s folk music traditions.

The Balanta play a gourd lute instrument called a &quot;kusunde&quot;, similar to the Jola &quot;akonting&quot; but with the short drone string (A#/B) at the bottom rather than the top. The top string is of middle length (open F#, stopped G#) while the middle string, the longest (open C#, stopped D#) is stopped by the top string and sounds the same.

Extent folk traditions include ceremonial music used in funerals, initiations and other rituals, as well as Balanta brosca and kussundé, Mandinga djambadon and the kundere sound of the Bijagos islands.

The calabash is a primary musical instrument of Guinea-Bissau, and is used in extremely swift and rhythmically complex dance music.

==Popular music==
Gumbe, the first popular song tradition to arise in the country after independence, had begun in 1973 with the recording of Ernesto Dabó&#x27;s &quot;M&#x27;Ba Bolama&quot; in Lisbon. Dabó&#x27;s record producer, Zé Carlos, had formed the popular Cobiana Djazz in 1972. The next popular band was Super Mama Djombo with their 1980 debut &quot;Cambança&quot;, followed by Africa Livre, Chifre Preto and Kapa Negra.

In the 1980s genres like kussundé began to become popular, led by Kaba Mané, whose &quot;Chefo Mae Mae&quot; used electric guitar and Balanta lyrics.

Angolan pop music, called kizomba, supports a number of artists singing in both English and Portuguese.

<doc id="424857" wikidata="Q6942358" url="?curid=424857" title="Music of the Comoros">
<text>The Comoros is a group of islands in the Indian Ocean, mostly an independent nation but also including the French territory of Mayotte. It is historically linked to both East Africa and France, and now has a strong Malagasy influence. Zanzibar&#x27;s taarab music, however, remains the most influential genre on the islands, and a Comorian version called &quot;twarab&quot; is popular. Leading twarab bands include Sambeco and Belle Lumière, as well as singers including Chamsia Sagaf and Mohammed Hassan. 

==Instruments==
Comorian instruments include the &#x27;oud and violin, the most frequent accompaniment for twarab, as well as gabusi (a type of lute) and ndzendze (a box zither), and the msondo drum. Sega music from nearby Mauritius and Réunion is also popular. The primitive oboe, the ndzumara, is now nearly extinct.

==Musicians==
Modern musicians include Abou Chihabi, who composed the Comorian national anthem and who is known for his reggae-tinged pan-African variety music, reggae/zouk/soukous fusionists like Maalesh and Salim Ali Amir, Nawal, Ali Saïd Achimo who resides in Paris, Diho, singer-songwriters and instrumentalists.

<doc id="424858" wikidata="Q6593123" url="?curid=424858" title="Music of Mauritius">
<text>Mauritius has 2 genres of music that originate from the Island. The traditional music of [[Mauritius]] which is known as sega music and also Seggae Music. Other genres like reggae, ragga, zouk, soukous and Indian music are also popular, but these genres do not originate from Mauritius, despite famous local singers such as Kaya, who successfully combined Reggae Music with sega music to create Mauritian Seggae. Well-known traditional sega singers from Mauritius include Ti Frére, Marlene Ravaton, Serge Lebrasse, Michel Legris and Fanfan.

Musicians in Mauritius are quite talented and through the years Mauritian music has evolved to international standards. There are many jazz and blues artists around the island. 

Sega, seggae and reggae remain the most popular produced music in Mauritius amongst Mauritian artists. Based on popular internet connection there are evolved artists performing R&amp;B, hip hop, soul, dubstep, club, techno and other popular music styles. 

The Sega is usually sung in Creole, the Mauritian mother tongue. Some singers planned to also publish an English version of their Sega songs but later abstained in order to preserve the uniqueness and cultural richness of the local music of Mauritius.

The original instruments - the “Ravanne”, “Triangle”, the “Maravanne” and the traditional guitar - are often replaced by more conventional orchestra instruments. However, all along the coastal fishing villages, the traditional instruments are still being used.

By 2015, some of the popular Mauritian sega artists were Alain Ramanisum, Desiré Francois and Ziakazom. Other top known Mauritian artists are Kaka Zulu and The Prophecy.

==Sega==
The sega is the most popular form of music and dance of Mauritius. The traditional instrumentation includes the ravanne, a goat-skin covered drum, the triangle, and the maravanne.

It is not clear when sega originated. Most claim that sega music and dance origins are found in the slavery epoch, most probably started in Mauritius at the end of 17th century to early 18th century during the French colonisation of the island, but research has not established the exact date. Nowadays, Mauritians sing sega as a form of self-expression. Rural forms of music include Mauritian Bhojpuri songs, kawals, that date from the epoch of indentured labour and remained popular in Mauritian villages but are now fast disappearing.

There have been many groups that have been formed that fuse these two as well as others that have a deeper connection to the roots of each genre. Cassiya is an example of a group that has become popular not only in Mauritius but also in the neighboring islands such as Reunion. Their single &quot;Mo fami Peser&quot; gives an idea of how life has evolved for the black indentured laborer post-slavery. It tells about how life as a fisherman becomes more difficult as the seas become more polluted and even though they tried to find a normal city job, they still prefer peaceful life of a fisherman.

==Asian music in Mauritius==
Indian immigrants have brought their own styles of music and dance, along with instruments like the sitar and tabla. Mauritian-based Bhojpuri music has also been popular with people of Indian-descent, but is now gaining mainstream appeal through the work of artists such as &#x27;Neeraj Gupta Mudhoo&#x27; or The Bhojpuri Boys. Their fusion of Bhojpuri lyrics, sega beats, and more traditional Indian as well as Bollywood-style music has gained popularity among Mauritians, &quot;Langaroo&quot; being one of their famous songs. Chinese immigrants have also infused Mauritian culture with elements from Chinese musical traditions.

==Rock music in Mauritius==
Rock music has recently become very popular in Mauritius, many bands have become famous, including XBreed Supersoul, Feedback, Skeptikal, Kelp, Reborn Orlean which is nearer to metal/hard rock. In 2018, with the advent of the yearly Maytal, Underground Rock Festival and Decibel Assault initiative, many other bands such as Cryptic Carnage, Apostrophe, Ryoshi, Devived, UnMind, Revolt and King of None have started to get mainstream recognition.

<text>[[Seychelles]], which is an independent island chain in the Indian Ocean, has a distinct kind of music. Folk music incorporates multiple influences in a syncretic fashion, including English contredanse, polka and mazurka, French folk and pop, sega from Mauritius and Réunion, taarab, zouk, soukous moutya and other pan-African genres, as well as Polynesian and Indian music. A complex form of percussion music called Kanmtole is popular, along with combinations of Sega and Reggae called Seggae and combinations of Moutya and Reggae called Mouggae, as is Montea, a fusion of native folk rhythms with Kenyan benga developed by Patrick Victor. Jean Marc Volcy is another famous Seychellois musician who has brought a modern touch to traditional music. He has several albums including Sove Lavi.

The growth of Seychelles music has since seen the adoption of a blend of contemporary reggae and mainstream, international popular music.
