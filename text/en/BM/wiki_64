<text>Gusev is a crater on the planet Mars and is located at and is in the Aeolis quadrangle. The crater is about 166 kilometers in diameter and formed approximately three to four billion years ago. It was named after Russian astronomer Matvey Gusev (1826–1866) in 1976.

Prior to the exploration of the crater by the Spirit Rover, the crater was postulated to be an ancient lakebed with Ma&#x27;adim Vallis draining into it, of volcaniclastic origin, or a combination of both. These interpretations were based on &quot;Viking&quot; orbiter imagery, MOC imagery, THEMIS thermal mapping, and MOLA elevation mapping. However, Spirit did not find any lacustrine deposits, instead Spirit found alkaline volcanic rocks, including olivine basalt, comminuted basaltic debris, lavas, and pyroclastic rocks, but no eruption centers.
More recently, satellite images showed the trails of dust devils on Gusev&#x27;s floor. The &quot;Spirit&quot; rover later photographed dust devils from the ground, and likely owes much of its longevity to dust devils cleaning its solar panels.

On January 3, 2004, Gusev was the landing site of the first of NASA&#x27;s two Mars Exploration Rovers, named &quot;Spirit&quot;. It was hoped that the numerous smaller and more recent craters in this region would have exposed sedimentary material from early eras, although at first the region proved disappointing in its lack of available bedrock for study on the flat lava plains of the crater. It eventually arrived at the Columbia Hills, however, and rocks examined in that region showed evidence of small amounts of briny (salty) water interacting with them in ancient times, although not nearly as much as at Meridiani Planum, the landing area for &quot;Spirit&quot;″s twin, &quot;Opportunity&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Spirit&quot; became stuck in the soil of the region, and in 2010 went offline after a harsh Martian winter. Gusev was also considered a potential landing site for the Mars 2020 &quot;Perseverance&quot; rover.

==&quot;Spirit&quot; Rover&#x27;s rocks and minerals discoveries on Mars==

The rocks on the plains of Gusev are a type of basalt. They contain the minerals olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, and magnetite, and they look like volcanic basalt as they are fine-grained with irregular holes (geologists would say they have vesicles and vugs).
Much of the soil on the plains came from the breakdown of the local rocks. Fairly high levels of nickel were found in some soils; probably from meteorites.
Analysis shows that the rocks have been slightly altered by tiny amounts of water. Outside coatings and cracks inside the rocks suggest water deposited minerals, maybe bromine compounds. All the rocks contain a fine coating of dust and one or more harder rinds of material. One type can be brushed off, while another needed to be ground off by the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT).

There are a variety of rocks in the Columbia Hills (Mars), some of which have been altered by water, but not by very much water.

The dust in Gusev Crater is the same as dust all around the planet. All the dust was found to be magnetic. Moreover, Spirit found the magnetism was caused by the mineral magnetite, especially magnetite that contained the element titanium. One magnet was able to completely divert all dust hence all Martian dust is thought to be magnetic. The spectra of the dust was similar to spectra of bright, low thermal inertia regions like Tharsis and Arabia that have been detected by orbiting satellites. A thin layer of dust, maybe less than one millimeter thick covers all surfaces. Something in it contains a small amount of chemically bound water.

===Plains===
Observations of rocks on the plains show they contain the minerals pyroxene, olivine, plagioclase, and magnetite. These rocks can be classified in different ways. The amounts and types of minerals make the rocks primitive basalts—also called picritic basalts. The rocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic komatiites. Rocks of the plains also resemble the basaltic shergottites, meteorites that came from Mars. One classification system compares the amount of alkali elements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains rocks lie near the junction of basalt, picrobasalt, and tephrite. The Irvine-Barager classification calls them basalts.
Plain&#x27;s rocks have been very slightly altered, probably by thin films of water because they are softer and contain veins of light-colored material that may be bromine compounds, as well as coatings or rinds. It is thought that small amounts of water may have gotten into cracks inducing mineralization processes. Coatings on the rocks may have occurred when rocks were buried and interacted with thin films of water and dust. It was noted that these rocks were easier to grind compared to their Earth counterparts.
===Columbia Hills===

Scientists found a variety of rock types in the Columbia Hills, and they placed them into six different categories. The six are: Clovis, Wishbone, Peace, Watchtower, Backstay, and Independence. They are named after a prominent rock in each group. Their chemical compositions, as measured by APXS, are significantly different from each other. Most importantly, all of the rocks in Columbia Hills show various degrees of alteration due to aqueous fluids. They are enriched in the elements phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and bromine—all of which can be carried around in water solutions. The Columbia Hills’ rocks contain basaltic glass, along with varying amounts of olivine and sulfates. The olivine abundance varies inversely with the amount of sulfates. This is exactly what is expected because water destroys olivine but helps to produce sulfates.

The Clovis group is especially interesting because the Mössbauer spectrometer(MB) detected goethite in it. Goethite forms only in the presence of water, so its discovery is the first direct evidence of past water in the Columbia Hills&#x27;s rocks. In addition, the MB spectra of rocks and outcrops displayed a strong decline in olivine presence, although the rocks probably once contained much olivine. Olivine is a marker for the lack of water because it easily decomposes in the presence of water. Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form. Wishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and anhydrate (a sulfate). Peace rocks showed sulfur and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.
One type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, phosphorus, calcium, and iron. Also, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe+++ form, which would happen if water had been present.

Towards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure silica were found in the soil. The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.

After &quot;Spirit&quot; stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or Mini-TES and confirmed the presence of large amounts of carbonate-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water. The carbonates were discovered in an outcrop of rocks called &quot;Comanche.&quot;

In summary, &quot;Spirit&quot; found evidence of slight weathering on the plains of Gusev, but no evidence that a lake was there. However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates which only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component which was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.

<text>Antelope squirrels or antelope ground squirrels of the genus &quot;Ammospermophilus&quot; are sciurids found in the desert and dry scrub areas of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are a type of ground squirrel and are able to resist hyperthermia and can survive body temperatures over .

== Common characteristics ==

All the antelope squirrels share a common white stripe along the lateral sides from the shoulder to the hip similar to chipmunks. However, unlike chipmunks, these characteristic white stripes do not extend onto the head of the animals. The tails of antelope squirrels are often arched forward over their back. In the United States, these ground squirrels are found in the dry, desert like regions of the southwest. The different members of the genus &quot;Ammospermophilus&quot; have unique adaptations that allow them to overcome the extreme heat of the day and the low temperatures of the night. All antelope squirrels burrow into the ground for shelter, however not all are social creatures. Each antelope squirrel has a white ventral surface with little variation.

== Species ==
The four unique species of the genus &quot;Ammospermophilus&quot; can be distinguished by some variations in size, weight, and appearance.
There are currently five recognized species:

All are somewhat similar in appearance and behavior. They are around in head-and-body length with a tail, and weigh . The tail is somewhat flattened. They have a single white stripe on both flanks and none on the face. They live in burrows, which they dig for themselves. They are diurnal, and do not hibernate (though they become less active during the winter), so they are fairly easily seen.
== Reproduction ==

The typical life span of a wild antelope squirrel is 2–4 years; although, in captivity they have been known to survive 11 years. Males and females are sexually mature by the end of their first year. The reproductive season last from February to March with typically one litter per year. Each litter contains between 5-14 young that will wean around 8 weeks and make their first appearance above ground. All antelope squirrels give birth to and nurse their young in burrows. However, they do vary in the way they dig the burrows. For example, the white-tailed squirrel digs shallow burrows under brush or will use the abandoned burrows of kangaroo rats. These squirrels are not monogamous and have been known to mate with multiple partners each breeding season.

== Habitat ==

Antelope squirrels are commonly found in dry, shrubby areas of the southern United States into Mexico. These areas are sandy with rocky areas that provide soil that can be burrowed into for shelter and to escape the heat of the day. The temperatures in these regions can exceed during the day and require special adaptations by the ground squirrels to survive. During the night, temperatures in these desert and dry areas may dip below freezing which again requires adaptations to survive. There is very limited free-standing water supply. These regions can experience long bouts of drought. &quot;A. harrisii&quot; does not require surface water within its range but will drink on occasion from basins and bird-baths.

== Diet ==

Ground Squirrels are important dispersers of seeds in the dry, shrubby deserts they live in. They participate in a behavior known as caching where seeds, fruits and vegetation are stored in burrows or hidden spots for consumption at a later time. The ground squirrels are omnivores and will feed on arthropods, insects, and carrion when these food sources are available. Their diets often rotate between green vegetation, fruits and seeds based on availability and season. All Antelope Squirrels carry their food in their cheek pouches for transport.

==Behavior==

&quot;A. leucurus&quot; have larger feet than other antelope squirrels, which allow them to quickly evade and escape predators. They remain cool during the hot desert days by retreating to their burrows and limiting the majority of activity to the early morning and late evening hours. Some white-tailed squirrels have been known to sound shrill alarm calls when predators are nearby to warn relatives of incoming danger.

&quot;A. nelsoni&quot; are able to function in temperatures up to and do not hibernate, however, they will lower their core temperature to within a few degrees of the ambient temperature of a burrow. Likewise, they will lower their activity level when food is scarce to preserve energy.

&quot;A. interpres&quot; live in very hot, arid climates and so have adapted to laying flat (to maximize heat distribution) in a shaded spot against the cool ground. This allows for the Texas squirrel to be active during the hottest part of the day when most predators are inactive.

&quot;A. harrisii&quot; are the only antelope squirrels who dig their own burrows instead of re-purposing burrows of other animals. They cool down by salivation and holding their tails above their heads to provide shade. They also flatten themselves on the ground to cool. During times of cold, they utilize cached seeds but also continue to forage.

<text>The golden-winged warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) is a New World warbler. It breeds in southeastern and south-central Canada and in the Appalachian Mountains in northeastern to north-central United States. The majority (~70%) of the global population breeds in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Manitoba. Golden-winged warbler populations are slowly expanding northwards, but are generally declining across its range, most likely as a result of habitat loss and competition/interbreeding with the very closely related blue-winged warbler, &quot;Vermivora cyanoptera&quot;. Populations are now restricted to two regions: the Great Lakes and the Appalachian Mountains. The Appalachian population has declined 98% since the 1960s and is significantly imperiled. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been petitioned to list the species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and is currently reviewing all information after issuing a positive finding. Upon review, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the petition to list the species as endangered or threatened presents &quot;substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that listing the golden-winged warbler may be warranted.&quot;

==Etymology==

The genus name &quot;Vermivora&quot; is from Latin &quot;vermis&quot; &quot;worm&quot;, and &quot;vorare&quot;, &quot;to devour&quot;, and the specific &quot;chrysoptera&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;khrusos&quot;, &quot;gold&quot;, and &quot;pteron&quot;, &quot;wing&quot;.

This is a small warbler, measuring long, weighing , and having a wingspan range 20 cm. The male has black throat, black ear patch bordered in white, and a yellow crown and wing patch. Females appear similar to males, with a light gray throat and light gray ear patches. 
In both sexes, extensive white on the tail is conspicuous from below. Underparts are grayish white and the bill is long and slender. Juvenile individuals appear similar to females, regardless of sex.



==Life history==

Golden-winged warblers are migratory, breeding in eastern North America and wintering in southern Central America and the neighboring regions in Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. They are very rare vagrants elsewhere.

Golden-winged warblers breed in open scrubby areas, wetlands, and mature forest adjacent to those habitats. Incubation of eggs, from laying to hatch, lasts 11–12 days. They lay 3–6 eggs (often 5) in a concealed cup nest on the ground or low in a bush.

Nestling golden-winged warblers feed almost entirely on caterpillars (especially leafrollers) delivered by their parents. Adult diets are less thoroughly described, but it is assumed they subsist heavily on caterpillars, and occasionally spiders. They have strong gaping (opening) musculature around their bill, allowing them to uncover hidden caterpillars.

Their song is variable, but is most often perceived as a trilled &quot;bzzzzzzz buzz buzz buzz&quot;. The call is a buzzy &quot;chip&quot; or &quot;zip&quot;.

Male Golden-winged warblers use their brilliant yellow crowns, black throats, and white tail feather patches to signal habitat quality. Birds with more ornate ornaments protect higher quality territories and are typically less aggressive than their less brilliantly-colored conspecifics. However, ornamentation has not been shown to be linked with overall reproductive success. This is likely because golden-winged warblers with less ornamentation likely compensate for this with increased aggression.

Five geotracked golden-winged warblers in Tennessee were observed migrating hundreds of miles south, presumably avoiding tornadic storms, in April 2014. Individuals left prior to the arrival of the storm, perhaps after detecting it due to infrasound.

== Habitat Selection ==
Golden-winged warblers are neotropical-nearctic migrants, and their habitat selectivity varies seasonally. Golden-winged warblers wintering in Costa Rica select premontane evergreen forest rather than tropical dry forest plant communities. Golden-winged warblers forage in hanging dead leaves, which are often a result of intermediate disturbances to the forest plant community.

During the breeding season, golden-winged warblers nest in shrubland and regenerating forest communities created and maintained by disturbance. This dependency on early-successional plant communities is part of the reason golden-winged warbler populations are declining.

==Hybridization==

This species forms two distinctive hybrids with blue-winged warblers where their ranges overlap in the Great Lakes and New England area. The more common, genetically dominant Brewster&#x27;s warbler is gray above and whitish (male) or yellow (female) below. It has a black eyestripe and two white wingbars.

The rarer recessive Lawrence&#x27;s warbler has a male plumage with green and yellow above and yellow below, with white wing bars and the same face pattern as male golden-winged. The female is gray above and whitish below with two yellow wing bars and the same face pattern as female golden-winged. 

An exceptionally rare triple-hybrid, the Burket&#x27;s warbler, was described in Pennsylvania in 2018 by researchers at Cornell University&#x27;s Lab of Ornithology. The Burket&#x27;s warbler was determined through genetic testing to be the offspring of a Brewster&#x27;s warbler and another closely related species, the chestnut-sided warbler. Brewster&#x27;s and Lawrence&#x27;s warblers can vary considerably in their physical features and sing songs of either blue-winged or golden-winged warblers. The colour of the throat patch reliably correlates with hybrid type, but colour of the underparts is highly variable between different hybrids. The only known Burket&#x27;s warbler sang a chestnut-sided warbler&#x27;s song.

Genetic introgression occurs across their range, producing cryptic hybrids (morphologically pure individuals with small amounts of blue-winged warbler DNA). These hybrids may be present in low numbers even on the edges of golden-winged warbler range, far from any populations of blue-winged warblers.

Hybridization between golden-winged warblers and blue-winged warblers is likely occurring at a much higher rate than initially thought. Genetic analysis has allowed scientists to more accurately quantify extra-pair copulation, and one study showed EPC was occurring in 55% of golden-winged warbler nests, resulting in phenotypic golden-winged warblers that were actually hybrids. 

== Interspecific interactions ==
In 2015, scientists observed a strange event. A female golden-winged warbler abandoned her two fledgling chicks 5 and 9 days after fledging. The two chicks were subsequently &quot;adopted&quot; by a male black-and-white warbler, which fed the fledglings for 23 days until they reached independence.

Golden-winged warbler nests are frequently parasitized by brown-headed cowbirds; up to 30% of golden-winged warbler nests may be parasitized in habitats they share with cowbirds.

<text>Alternative comics or independent comics cover a range of American comics that have appeared since the 1980s, following the underground comix movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Alternative comics present an alternative to mainstream superhero comics which in the past have dominated the American comic book industry. They span across a wide range of genres, artistic styles, and subjects.

Alternative comics are often published in small numbers with less regard for regular distribution schedules.

Many alternative comics have variously been labelled as post-underground comics, independent comics, indie comics, [[auteur]] comics, [[small press]] comics, new wave comics, creator-owned comics, art comics, or literary comics. Many self-published &quot;minicomics&quot; also fall under the &quot;alternative&quot; umbrella.

==From underground to alternative==
By the mid-1970s, artists within the underground comix scene felt that it had become less creative than it had been in the past. According to Art Spiegelman, &quot;What had seemed like a revolution simply deflated into a lifestyle. Underground comics were stereotyped as dealing only with sex, dope and cheap thrills. They got stuffed back into the closet, along with bong pipes and love beads, as things started to get uglier.&quot; In an attempt to address this, underground cartoonists moved to start magazines that anthologized new, artistically ambitious comics in the 1980s. &quot;RAW&quot;, a lavishly produced, large format anthology that was clearly intended to be seen as a work of art was founded by Spiegelman and his wife Françoise Mouly in 1980. Another magazine, &quot;Weirdo&quot;, was started by the leading figure in underground comix, Robert Crumb, in 1981.

These magazines reflected changes from the days of the underground comix. They had different formats from the old comix, and the selection of artists differed, too. &quot;RAW&quot; featured many European artists, &quot;Weirdo&quot; included photo-funnies and strange outsider art-type documents. &quot;Elfquest&quot; was based on a science fiction/fantasy theme with powerful female and male characters of varied races and cultures, and done in a bright and colourful manga-like style. The underground staples of sex, drugs and revolution were much less in evidence. More emphasis was placed on developing the craft of comics drawing and storytelling, with many artists aiming for work that was both subtler and more complex than was typical in the underground. This was true of much of the new work done by the established comix artists as well as the newcomers: Art Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Maus&quot;, much celebrated for bringing a new seriousness to comics, was serialized in &quot;RAW.&quot;

While fans debate the origins of self-publishing in the comics industry, many consider Dave Sim an early leader in this area. Starting in 1977, he primarily wrote, drew and published &quot;Cerebus the Aardvark,&quot; on his own under the &quot;Aardvark-Vanaheim Inc.&quot; imprint and announcing he would publish 300 issues of the series consecutively, something unheard of at the time for a self-published book. Sim is known for his activism in favor of creators&#x27; rights and his outspoken nature in regards to the industry. He often used the back of his comic to deliver &quot;messages from the President&quot;, which were sometimes editorials concerning the comics industry and self-publishing.

Wendy and Richard Pini founded WaRP Graphics, one of the early American independent comics publishers, in 1977 and released the first issues of their long-running series, &quot;Elfquest&quot;, in February 1978. They followed with titles such as &quot;MythAdventures&quot; and related titles by Robert Asprin; and &quot;Thunder Bunny&quot;, created by Martin Greim. WaRP was also the original publisher of &quot;A Distant Soil&quot; by Colleen Doran. As an alternative to most of the masculine-themed comics of its time – and even to this day – &quot;Elfquest&quot; became enormously popular among female comic book fans around the world, while also drawing a solid male fan base. WaRP Graphics paved the way for many independent and alternative comic book creators who came after them. At its peak in the mid-1980s, &quot;Elfquest&quot; was selling 100,000 copies per issue in the initial print run, attracting one of the largest followings of any direct-sale comic. Most issues up to No. 9 saw multiple printings. It was the visible success of &quot;Elfquest&quot; that inspired many other writers and artists to try their own hand at self-publishing.

Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, a series by Mirage Studios, was very influential on a new generation of creators and became a huge success story of self publishing.

Jeff Smith, a friend of Dave Sim, was also very influential in self-published comics, creating the highly popular and long-lived &quot;Bone&quot;. As with Sim with &quot;Cerebus&quot; and unlike mainstream comic books stories with their spontaneously generated and rambling narratives, Smith produced &quot;Bone&quot; as a story with a planned end.

The publishing house Fantagraphics published the work of a new generation of artists, notably &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; by the brothers Jaime, Gilbert and Mario Hernandez.

Dan DeBono published &quot;Indy – The Independent Comic Guide&quot;, a magazine covering only independent comics starting in 1994. It ran for 18 issues and featured covers by Daniel Clowes, Tim Vigil, Drew Hayes, William Tucci, Jeff Smith and Wendy and Richard Pini.

Alternative comics have increasingly established themselves within the larger culture, as evidenced by the success of the feature film &quot;Ghost World&quot; based on one of the best selling alternative titles, &quot;Eightball&quot;, by Daniel Clowes and the cross-genre success of the book &quot;Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth&quot;, by Chris Ware, a story that was serialized in Ware&#x27;s comic, Acme Novelty Library.

Image Comics and Dark Horse Comics publish many alternative comics. Notable examples include Stan Sakai&#x27;s &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;, Sergio Aragonés&#x27;s &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot;, and James O&#x27;Barr&#x27;s &quot;The Crow&quot;.

Oni Press used the term &quot;real mainstream,&quot; coined by Stephen L. Holland of the UK comic shop Page 45, to describe its output. Traditional American comic books regard superhero titles as &quot;mainstream&quot; and all other genres as &quot;non-mainstream&quot;, a reversal of the perception in other countries. Oni Press, therefore, adopted the &quot;real mainstream&quot; term to suggest that it publishes comic books and graphic novels whose subject matter is more in line with the popular genres of other media: thrillers, romances, realistic drama and so on. Oni Press avoids publishing superhero, fantasy and science fiction titles, unless interesting creators approach these concepts from an unusual angle.

Top Shelf Productions has published many notable alternative comics such as Craig Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Blankets&quot; and Alex Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Box Office Poison&quot;. In 2010 they branched out into unusual Japanese manga, with the release of &quot;AX:alternative manga&quot; (edited by Sean Michael Wilson). This 400-page collection received a high level of critical praise.

<text>The blue-winged warbler (Vermivora cyanoptera) is a fairly common New World warbler, long and weighing . It breeds in eastern North America in southern Ontario and the eastern United States. Its range is extending northwards, where it is replacing the very closely related golden-winged warbler (&quot;Vermivora chrysoptera)&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The common name &quot;blue-winged warbler&quot; refers to the bluish-gray color of the wings that contrast with the bright yellow body of the male. The name of the genus &quot;Vermivora&quot; means &quot;worm-eating&quot;. The genus used to include nine other new world warblers but now only includes this species, the golden-winged warbler and Bachman&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Vermivora bachmanii&quot;), which is believed to be extinct.

The blue-winged warbler was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th-century work, &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, though the scientific name has changed several times. The species epithet &quot;Pinus&quot; was given by Linnaeus in 1766 but was a mistake as the original description of the species was actually based on illustrations of &quot;pine creepers&quot; drawn by others. The drawings depicted two different species, what we now call a pine warbler and blue-winged warbler. In 2010 the blue-winged warbler&#x27;s scientific name was changed by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union to correct the error. Pine warblers retained the species name &quot;Pinus&quot; but the species epithet for blue-winged warbler was changed to &quot;cyanoptera&quot;.

=== Hybridization with golden-winged warbler ===

The blue-winged and golden-winged warblers are often compared to one another. Originally, the blue-winged warbler evolved on the interior of the continent, while the golden-winged species bred closer to the Atlantic coast. However, in the recent years, their habitats have drastically changed due to urbanization, deforestation, and other factors.

Golden-winged warblers are generally more susceptible to displacement from the blue-winged warblers. One example of this can be seen in the warbler population in central New York state. In the 1980s, the blue-winged warbler significantly increased in the area while the golden-winged warbler&#x27;s population decline. Because of the trend, it is often assumed that the blue-winged warbler somehow causes the local extinction of the golden-winged warbler; however, molecular studies confirm that the blue-winged warbler and golden-winged warbler are sister species that diverged sometime around 1.5 million years ago. Studies reveal that the two species are genetically 99.97% alike, and that their main differences are their general phenotypic appearances and singing tones.  

New studies also explain that the two warblers can coexist in their chosen habitat. The two species can also hybridize freely where their habitats overlap, producing two hybrid types: Lawrence&#x27;s warbler and Brewster&#x27;s warbler.

This species forms two distinctive hybrids with the golden-winged warbler where their ranges overlap in the Great Lakes and New England area. The more common and genetically dominant Brewster&#x27;s warbler is gray above and whitish (male) or yellow (female) below. It has a black eye stripe and two white wing bars. The rarer recessive Lawrence&#x27;s warbler has a male plumage which is green and yellow above and yellow below, with white wing bars and the same face pattern as male golden-winged. The female is gray above and whitish below with two yellow wing bars and the same face pattern as female golden-winged.

# Song - The four species have different Song I type patterns, but primarily consist of the A-B pattern, resulting in difficulty distinguishing from one another. Their Song II type are more distinguishable from each other.
# Morphology - The Brewster&#x27;s warblers tend to resemble the plumage of the golden-winged but has a blue wing face pattern and variable amounts of yellow. The Lawrence&#x27;s warblers look similar to blue-winged in terms of the plumage but exhibit a wing pattern similar to the golden-winged.
# Introgressed genotypes - Studies on the blue-winged and golden-winged warbler hybrids have indicated the presence of cryptic hybridization in the past for this species. This is done through DNA marker types, such as amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). This may indicate that there has been repeated backcrossing between the genes in both species and their hybrid offspring.

==Description==
The blue-winged warbler is a small warbler at long, with a wingspan of . The breeding plumage of the male consists of a bright yellow head, breast and underparts. There is no streaking of the underparts of the bird. It has a narrow black line though the eyes and light blueish gray with two white wing-bars, which are diagnostic field marks. The blue winged warblers are generally small in size with a well-proportioned body, and heavy pointed bill. They roughly measure 4.3 to 4.7 inches long with a wingspan of around 5.9 inches. An average Blue-Winged Warbler weighs around 0.3 oz.

The female is duller overall with less yellow on the crown. Immatures are olive green with wings similar to the adults.

The color of their plumage tends to vary depending on the sex of the species. For males, the feathers are of bright yellow and olive green. The males often have bluish-gray wings that come with white wing bars and a distinctive black eye lining, making their heads look pointier compared to other male warbler species.

Blue-winged warbler females exhibit a yellow plumage that looks a bit lighter in color. The females also have a much less prominent eye lining which mostly looks grey and light, rather than black as seen in the males.  

Immature or juvenile blue-winged warblers are smaller compared to adults and will show a pinkish bill and almost invisible wing bars.

The song is a series of buzzing notes. The call is a sharp &quot;chip&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Blue-winged warblers are migratory New World warblers. They winter in southern Central America and breed from east-central Nebraska in the west to southern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and southern Ontario in the north to central New York, southern Vermont, southern New Hampshire and New England to the east, south to western South Carolina, northern Georgia, northern Alabama, eastern Tennessee and southern Missouri. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe, with one bird wandering to Ireland.

The breeding habitat is open scrubby areas. The species is mostly found in abandoned fields with shrubs and trees and bordered by tall deciduous trees. Blue-winged warblers are generally found in areas located in higher elevation and high percentage of grass and canopy cover.

==Ecology==

===Diet===
Diet consists of insects and spiders. Blue-winged warblers primarily feed on insects found in various plants including apple trees, walnut trees, and water hemlock. Adults sometimes hang upside down to glean and probe leaves and gather insect larvae for their young. Some examples of larvae fed to juvenile blue-winged warblers include &quot;Aphis&quot; sp., and &quot;Corythucha&quot; sp. Often, researchers presume that the species&#x27;s diet and feeding methods tend to differ on each season and habitat, and may also change due to the availability of resources. This could be considered a relatively generalist species.

===Reproduction===
Blue-winged warblers nest on the ground or low in a bush, laying four to seven eggs in a cup nest. The females incubate the eggs for 10–11 days. The young are altricial and fledge in 8–10 days. The blue winged species communicate with others via singing. Hence, they have songs for fighting (descending bee-buzz), nesting, as well as breeding with other blue-winged warblers. During breeding season, the males arrive first in the location and wait for their possible mate. Usually, the females arrive one week after the males. While waiting for their mates, the males sing continuously. Once the females enter, the singing decreases and could possibly change in tune until they find a partner. After mating, the length of their song abruptly decreases.

<text>The foot-pound force (symbol: ft⋅lbf, ft⋅lbf, or ft⋅lb ) is a unit of work or energy in the engineering and gravitational systems in United States customary and imperial units of measure. It is the energy transferred upon applying a force of one pound-force (lbf) through a linear displacement of one foot. The corresponding SI unit is the joule, though in terms of energy, one joule is not equal to one foot-pound.

==Usage==
The term &quot;foot-pound&quot; is also used as a unit of torque (see &quot;pound-foot (torque)&quot;). In the United States this is often used to specify, for example, the tightness of a fastener (such as screws and nuts) or the output of an engine. Although they are dimensionally equivalent, energy (a scalar) and torque (a Euclidean vector) are distinct physical quantities. Both energy and torque can be expressed as a product of a force vector with a displacement vector (hence pounds and feet); energy is the scalar product of the two, and torque is the vector product.

Although calling the torque unit &quot;pound-foot&quot; has been academically suggested, both are still commonly called &quot;foot-pound&quot; in colloquial usage. To avoid confusion, it is not uncommon for people to specify each as &quot;foot-pound of energy&quot; or &quot;foot-pound of torque&quot; respectively.

In small arms ballistics and particularly in the United States, the foot-pound is often used to specify the muzzle energy of a bullet.

==Conversion factors==
===Energy===
1 foot pound-force is equivalent to:
* joules
* ergs
* about British thermal units
* calories
* eV = EeV = GeV

===Power===
1 foot pound-force per second is equivalent to:
* 1.3558179483314 watts
* horsepower

Related conversions:
* 1 watt ≈ ft⋅lbf/min = ft⋅lbf/s
* 1 horsepower (mechanical) = 33,000 ft⋅lbf/min = 550 ft⋅lbf/s

<doc id="420086" wikidata="Q740345" url="?curid=420086" title="John Kitzhaber">
<text>John Albert Kitzhaber (born March 5, 1947) is an American former politician and physician who served as the 35th and 37th governor of Oregon from 1995 to 2003 and again from 2011 to 2015. In February 2015, shortly after beginning his fourth term, Kitzhaber resigned from office and was replaced by Secretary of State Kate Brown. A member of the Democratic Party, Kitzhaber was the longest-serving governor in the state&#x27;s history.

A physician in Roseburg, Kitzhaber was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1978. After one term, he won an Oregon Senate seat in 1980, serving three terms, until 1993. He was Senate President from 1985 to 1993. In 1994, he was elected governor of Oregon, defeating his Republican opponent Denny Smith. He was reelected by a wide margin in 1998 and left office in January 2003. In 2010, Kitzhaber ran for governor again and narrowly defeated his Republican opponent Chris Dudley. He was reelected in 2014, to become Oregon&#x27;s longest serving governor.

Kitzhaber resigned from office only a month into his fourth term on February 18, 2015, as state and federal authorities were investigating criminal allegations against him and his fiancée Cylvia Hayes. In 2017, the federal government dropped its investigation against Kitzhaber without filing charges. The Oregon ethics commission found 10 instances when Kitzhaber used his political office for personal gain. He agreed to pay a settlement fine of $20,000.

== Early life and career ==
Kitzhaber was born on March 5, 1947, in Colfax, Washington, to Annabel Reed (&quot;née&quot; Wetzel) and Albert Raymond Kitzhaber. He graduated from South Eugene High School in 1965, Dartmouth College in 1969, and Oregon Health &amp; Science University with a medical degree in 1973. Kitzhaber practiced medicine from 1973 to 1986 in Roseburg, Oregon, as an emergency physician.

== Legislative career ==

Kitzhaber began his political career in 1978 when he won election to the Oregon House of Representatives, where he served for one term. In 1980, he was elected to the Oregon State Senate, where he served three terms from 1981 to 1993 and was the president of the Senate from 1985 to 1993. As Oregon Senate President, he was the chief author of the state&#x27;s government-funded health care plan, the Oregon Health Plan.

== Governorship ==
=== First term, 1995–1999 ===

In 1994, Kitzhaber won the Democratic nomination for governor when the sitting governor, Barbara Roberts (also a Democrat), withdrew from the race in January of that year. Roberts opted against a second term after voters refused to pass a sales tax to fund the Oregon Health Plan and she was forced to break her campaign promise not to cut spending.

Kitzhaber won the general election in November 1994 with 51% of the vote. The Republican candidate, former Rep. Denny Smith, won 42%. He was sworn into office on January 9, 1995.

During his first term, Kitzhaber introduced the Oregon Children&#x27;s Plan, which was designed to identify and assist at-risk children and their families. Despite being personally opposed to the death penalty, Kitzhaber allowed two executions to be carried out in his first term: Douglas Franklin Wright in 1996 and Harry Charles Moore in 1997. In a statement in 2011, Kitzhaber said &quot;They were the most agonizing and difficult decisions I have made as Governor... I have regretted those choices ever since.&quot;

=== Second term, 1999–2003 ===

Republican anti-tax activist Bill Sizemore challenged Kitzhaber in 1998. Sizemore had founded Oregon Taxpayers United, a political action committee that lobbied against tax increases and promoted ballot measures limiting the use of union dues in political campaigns, in 1993.

During the general election, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; newspaper reported Sizemore&#x27;s controversial business practices in his personal life, as well as in the operation of his political action committees and non-profit educational foundation.

Kitzhaber won 64% of the vote to 30% for Sizemore. Kitzhaber won 35 of 36 counties in Oregon, with only rural Malheur County on the Idaho border going for Sizemore

In his second term, Kitzhaber developed policy initiatives related to natural resources during his two terms as governor, including The Oregon Plan for Salmon and Watersheds aimed at restoring dwindling runs of threatened salmon species to Oregon&#x27;s rivers and streams. The plan was a collaborative effort that encouraged federal, state and local government agencies to work with private landowners to restore watershed health and recover threatened salmon runs. Kitzhaber also took a high profile and controversial stand in favor of breaching several Northwest dams to help restore salmon populations.

Managing growth, particularly in the Willamette Valley, was a priority of Kitzhaber and he was a staunch supporter of Oregon&#x27;s comprehensive land use system. He opposed attempts to weaken protection of farmland and enforcement of urban growth boundaries. Kitzhaber also created the Governor&#x27;s Growth Task Force and the Willamette Valley Livability Forum to help gather accurate information and outline integrated approaches for developing sustainable communities. His related Community Solutions program attempted to focus the efforts of numerous state agencies, other governments and interested groups in collaborative problem solving and coordination to manage various community development projects across Oregon.

Under Oregon&#x27;s constitution, Kitzhaber could not seek a third consecutive term in 2002. He was succeeded by Democrat Ted Kulongoski, who was elected governor in 2002 and 2006.

=== Interregnum, 2003-2011 ===
After his first tenure as governor, Kitzhaber became the director of the Center for Evidence Based Policy at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University, served as the executive chair and president at both the Foundation for Medical Excellence and the Estes Park Institute, and founded the health care advocacy group the Archimedes Movement.

=== Third term, 2011–2015 ===

In September 2009, Kitzhaber announced that he would run for a third term as governor. He won the Democratic primary in May 2010, defeating Roger Obrist and the former Secretary of State of Oregon Bill Bradbury.

In the general election, he ran against Republican Chris Dudley, a businessman and former NBA player. Kitzhaber won a close election, 49.29% to 47.77%, with minor party candidates receiving the additional fractions.

Kitzhaber was sworn into his third term as Governor of Oregon on January 10, 2011, succeeding the Democrat who had succeeded him, Gov. Ted Kulongoski.

The 2010 election was the first time Oregon used its new cross nomination system, a form of fusion voting. In this system, a candidate for partisan public office can be nominated by up to three political parties. Kitzhaber was nominated by the Independent Party of Oregon in addition to the Democratic Party.

On November 22, 2011, Kitzhaber announced that he might commute an upcoming death sentence scheduled to occur in the month ahead. Kitzhaber went on to announce that he would allow no executions to occur in Oregon while he is governor, calling the issuing of death sentences &quot;compromised and inequitable&quot;. The reprieved inmate, Gary Haugen, made headlines when he refused to be pardoned, wanting to be executed. Senior Judge Timothy P. Alexander, assigned to Marion County Circuit Court, ruled that Haugen could reject the governor&#x27;s reprieve of his execution and move forward in his efforts to die by lethal injection. Kitzhaber appealed the decision to the Oregon Supreme Court, which decided in the governor&#x27;s favor on June 20, 2013. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named Kitzhaber one of &quot;The Quiet Ones: 12 Leaders Who Get Things Done&quot;, citing his decision to halt all executions in Oregon as &quot;demonstrating just how effective government can be&quot;.

Kitzhaber presided over the failed launch of Cover Oregon, the state&#x27;s Affordable Care Act insurance exchange website. He was also disappointed in 2014 by the collapse of the Columbia River Crossing infrastructure megaproject, amid opposition from some urbanists in Portland and by Republicans in Washington&#x27;s state Senate and Clark County government.

A more personal scandal struck the governor&#x27;s office late in 2014 when the &quot;Willamette Week&quot; exposed a previously unknown marriage between First Lady Cylvia Hayes and an Ethiopian immigrant in 1997. Hayes admitted to the union, which was dissolved in the early 2000s, and said it was an illegal green card marriage into which she entered for money during a difficult period in her life. Kitzhaber was reportedly unaware of the marriage until the &quot;Willamette Week&quot;&#x27;s investigation. Just days later, local news stations reported that Hayes was involved in another criminal scheme in 1997 involving a marijuana grow operation in Washington, to which Hayes also admitted.

At the same time, Kitzhaber faced questions over Hayes&#x27; consulting business and whether the first lady improperly used her position and relationship to the governor. Kitzhaber asked for an ethics review into Hayes&#x27;s business activities, which the state commission declined to look into. Kitzhaber publicly defended Hayes against criticism, saying the state executive branch followed protocol with regard to her consulting work and calling her past marriage a &quot;personal issue&quot;, although he admitted at a debate that he was &quot;taken aback and hurt&quot; to learn of it.

=== Fourth term, 2015 ===

Kitzhaber ran for reelection in 2014. While he consistently led opponent Dennis Richardson, a conservative Republican state representative from Central Point, in public polling and defeated him by a margin of 5.6 percent, his campaign faced controversy over the failure of Cover Oregon and the activities of Kitzhaber&#x27;s fiancée, Cylvia Hayes, with Richardson charging that the Governor and the First Lady were corrupt. Kitzhaber was cross-nominated by the Working Families Party of Oregon.

Kitzhaber was sworn in for a historic fourth term as governor on January 12, 2015. At the start of his fourth term, he enjoyed the largest Democratic majorities in the Oregon Legislative Assembly he had seen in more than 12 years as governor. In his inaugural address, Kitzhaber indicated his fourth gubernatorial term would be the last one he would seek, saying it &quot;will complete the arc of my political career&quot;. He said he wanted to focus on socioeconomic inequality in Oregon during his last four years as governor of the state.

==Hayes influence peddling scandal and aftermath==

Despite his efforts to pivot toward policy, Kitzhaber continued to grapple with controversies related to his fiancée and her work as a consultant and for the state. At a press conference on January 30, 2015, he said Hayes would play no further role in his administration, although he confirmed the couple still plans to marry. &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, which endorsed him in his 2010 and 2014 campaigns, went so far as to call on him to resign, although Kitzhaber said he would not consider doing so. Major Democratic officeholders in the state, including Treasurer Ted Wheeler, Senate President Peter Courtney, and House Speaker Tina Kotek, all issued statements on February 12 urging Kitzhaber to resign. Also on February 12, the &quot;Willamette Week&quot; reported that Kitzhaber&#x27;s executive assistant had tried to have thousands of the governor&#x27;s emails deleted the previous week. The next day, February 13, Kitzhaber announced his resignation (effective February 18, 2015) amid the scandal.
In 2017, following 28 months of investigation, the federal government announced that it had dropped its investigation into allegations that Kitzhaber and his partner Cylvia Hayes had used their positions for personal gain. In a statement posted on his Facebook page, Kitzhaber said: 

In January 2019, Kitzhaber agreed to pay $20,000 in civil penalties to the Oregon Government Ethics Commission for conflicts of interest involving Hayes while he was governor. That month, Hayes also agreed to pay the Commission fines totaling &quot;$44,000 for ethics violations arising from her use of public office for personal profit.&quot;

== Activities outside governorship ==

Kitzhaber serves as the director of the Center for Evidence Based Policy at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland, Oregon. He holds an endowed chair on health care policy at The Foundation for Medical Excellence, an educational foundation that produces continuing-education programs for physicians. Kitzhaber also serves as the president of the Estes Park Institute, a continuing-education organization for community health care leaders and hospital executives.

On January 13, 2006, Kitzhaber announced the Archimedes Movement, an organization seeking to maximize the health of the population by creating a sustainable system which uses the public resources spent on health care to ensure that everyone has access to a defined set of effective health services. The goal is to create a vision for a more equitable and sustainable system as well as the political tension necessary for its realization. A legislative proposal that took input from many Oregon residents was introduced in the 2007 Oregon legislative session.

The Oregon Better Health Act failed to pass the 2007 Legislature after Kitzhaber was unable to overcome concerns raised by AARP about his inclusion of Medicare in his plan. Another health reform bill, a Senate proposal which was amended to include portions of the Archimedes Movement bill, passed instead.

With the withdrawal of Tom Daschle&#x27;s candidacy for United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, there was speculation Kitzhaber could be tapped for the position. However, Kitzhaber denied interest in the position and said that he was not being vetted.

On February 7, 2014, Kitzhaber endorsed fellow Democrat Donald Berwick for Governor of Massachusetts. On May 2, 2016, Kitzhaber announced his endorsement for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in his 2016 race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

==Personal life==

Kitzhaber is of German descent. He married Rosemary Linehan in 1971; they divorced in 1974. He married Sharon LaCroix in 1995 and had one son, Logan, who was born in October 1997. The couple sought a divorce in 2003, soon after the end of his second term as governor.

Kitzhaber lives with his fiancée Cylvia Hayes, founder of the environmental consulting firm 3EStrategies. In August 2014, the couple announced their engagement; no wedding date has been announced.

During his political career, Kitzhaber became famous for wearing blue jeans during speaking engagements. When he wore jeans to his inauguration in 1995, he created a minor stir. During his 2010 campaign for a third term as governor, Kitzhaber frequently avoided the necktie as well, preferring a button-down shirt and suit jacket with no tie.

Kitzhaber lives and works in Portland, and declined to use the official gubernatorial residence of Mahonia Hall in Salem during his service as governor.

<doc id="420088" wikidata="Q194417" url="?curid=420088" title="Social mobility">
<text>Social mobility is the movement of individuals, families, households or other categories of people within or between social strata in a society. It is a change in social status relative to one&#x27;s current social location within a given society. This movement occurs between layers or tiers in an open system of social stratification. Open stratification systems are those in which at least some value is given to achieved status characteristics in a society. The movement can be in a &quot;downward&quot; or &quot;upward&quot; direction. Markers for social mobility such as education and class, are used to predict, discuss and learn more about an individual or a group&#x27;s mobility in society.

==Typology==
Mobility is most often quantitatively measured in terms of change in economic mobility such as changes in income or wealth. Occupation is another measure used in researching mobility which usually involves both quantitative and qualitative analysis of data, but other studies may concentrate on social class. Mobility may be &quot;intragenerational&quot;, within the same generation or &quot;intergenerational&quot;, between different generations. Intragenerational mobility is less frequent, representing &quot;rags to riches&quot; cases in terms of upward mobility. Intergenerational upward mobility is more common where children or grandchildren are in economic circumstances better than those of their parents or grandparents. In the US, this type of mobility is described as one of the fundamental features of the &quot;American Dream&quot; even though there is less such mobility than almost all other OECD countries.

Mobility can also be defined in terms of relative or absolute mobility. Absolute mobility looks at a person&#x27;s progress in the areas of education, health, housing, income, job opportunities and other factors and compares it to some starting point, usually the previous generation. As technological advancements and economic development increase so do income levels and the conditions in which most people live. In absolute terms, people around the world, on average, are living better today than yesterday and in that sense, have experienced absolute mobility. 

Relative mobility looks at the mobility of a person in comparison to the mobility of others in the same cohort. In more advanced economies and OECD countries there is more space for absolute mobility than for relative mobility because a person from an average status background may remain average (thus no relative mobility) but still have a gradual increase in living standards due to a total social average increasing over time. 

There is also an idea of stickiness concerning mobility. This is when an individual is no longer experiencing relative mobility and it occurs mostly at the ends. At the bottom end of the socioeconomic ladder, parents cannot provide their children with the necessary resources or opportunity to enhance their lives. As a result, they remain on the same ladder rung as their parents. On the opposite side of the ladder, the high socioeconomic status parents have the necessary resources and opportunities to ensure their children also remain in same ladder rung as them. In East Asian countries this is exemplified by the concept of familial karma. 

===Social status and social class===

Social mobility is highly dependent on the overall structure of social statuses and occupations in a given society. The extent of differing social positions and the manner in which they fit together or overlap provides the overall social structure of such positions. Add to this the differing dimensions of status, such as Max Weber&#x27;s delineation of economic stature, prestige, and power and we see the potential for complexity in a given social stratification system. Such dimensions within a given society can be seen as independent variables that can explain differences in social mobility at different times and places in different stratification systems. The same variables that contribute as intervening variables to the valuation of income or wealth and that also affect social status, social class, and social inequality do affect social mobility. These include sex or gender, race or ethnicity, and age.

Education provides one of the most promising chances of upward social mobility and attaining a higher social status, regardless of current social standing. However, the stratification of social classes and high wealth inequality directly affects the educational opportunities and outcomes. In other words, social class and a family&#x27;s socioeconomic status directly affect a child&#x27;s chances for obtaining a quality education and succeeding in life. By age five, there are significant developmental differences between low, middle, and upper class children&#x27;s cognitive and noncognitive skills. 
Among older children, evidence suggests that the gap between high- and low-income primary- and secondary-school students has increased by almost 40 percent over the past thirty years. These differences persist and widen into young adulthood and beyond. Just as the gap in K–12 test scores between high- and low-income students is growing, the difference in college graduation rates between the rich and the poor is also growing. Although the college graduation rate among the poorest households increased by about 4 percentage points between those born in the early 1960s and those born in the early 1980s, over this same period, the graduation rate increased by almost 20 percentage points for the wealthiest households.

Average family income, and social status, have both seen a decrease for the bottom third of all children between 1975 and 2011. The 5th percentile of children and their families have seen up to a 60% decrease in average family income. The wealth gap between the rich and the poor, the upper and lower class, continues to increase as more middle-class people get poorer and the lower-class get even poorer. As the socioeconomic inequality continues to increase in the United States, being on either end of the spectrum makes a child more likely to remain there and never become socially mobile.
A child born to parents with income in the lowest quintile is more than ten times more likely to end up in the lowest quintile than the highest as an adult (43 percent versus 4 percent). And, a child born to parents in the highest quintile is five times more likely to end up in the highest quintile than the lowest (40 percent versus 8 percent).

This may be partly due to lower- and working-class parents, where neither is educated above high school diploma level, spending less time on average with their children in their earliest years of life and not being as involved in their children&#x27;s education and time out of school. This parenting style, known as &quot;accomplishment of natural growth&quot; differs from the style of middle-class and upper-class parents, with at least one parent having higher education, known as &quot;cultural cultivation&quot;. 

More affluent social classes are able to spend more time with their children at early ages, and children receive more exposure to interactions and activities that lead to cognitive and non-cognitive development: things like verbal communication, parent-child engagement and being read to daily. These children&#x27;s parents are much more involved in their academics and their free time; placing them in extracurricular activities which develop not only additional non-cognitive skills but also academic values, habits, and abilities to better communicate and interact with authority figures. Enrollment in so many activities can often lead to frenetic family lives organized around transporting children to their various activities. Lower class children often attend lower quality schools, receive less attention from teachers and ask for help much less than their higher class peers.

The chances for social mobility are primarily determined by the family a child is born into. Today, the gaps seen in both access to education and educational success (graduating from a higher institution) is even larger. Today, while college applicants from every socioeconomic class are equally qualified, 75% of all entering freshmen classes at top-tier American institutions belong to the uppermost socioeconomic quartile. A family&#x27;s class determines the amount of investment and involvement parents have in their children&#x27;s educational abilities and success from their earliest years of life, leaving low-income students with less chance for academic success and social mobility due to the effects that the common parenting style of the lower and working-class have on their outlook on and success in education.

===Class cultures and social networks===

These differing dimensions of social mobility can be classified in terms of differing types of capital that contribute to changes in mobility. Cultural capital, a term first coined by French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu distinguishes between the economic and cultural aspects of class. Bourdieu described three types of capital that place a person in a certain social category: economic capital; social capital; and cultural capital. Economic capital includes economic resources such as cash, credit, and other material assets. Social capital includes resources one achieves based on group membership, networks of influence, relationships and support from other people.

Cultural capital is any advantage a person has that gives them a higher status in society, such as education, skills, or any other form of knowledge. Usually, people with all three types of capital have a high status in society. Bourdieu found that the culture of the upper social class is oriented more toward formal reasoning and abstract thought. The lower social class is geared more towards matters of facts and the necessities of life. He also found that the environment in which a person develops has a large effect on the cultural resources that a person will have.

The cultural resources a person has obtained can heavily influence a child&#x27;s educational success. It has been shown that students raised under the concerted cultivation approach have &quot;an emerging sense of entitlement&quot; which leads to asking teachers more questions and being a more active student, causing teachers to favor students raised in this manner. This childrearing approach which creates positive interactions in the classroom environment is in contrast with the natural growth approach to childrearing. In this approach, which is more common amongst working-class families, parents do not focus on developing the special talents of their individual children, and they speak to their children in directives.

Due to this, it is rarer for a child raised in this manner to question or challenge adults and conflict arises between childrearing practices at home and school. Children raised in this manner are less inclined to participate in the classroom setting and are less likely to go out of their way to positively interact with teachers and form relationships. However, the greater freedom of working-class children gives them a broader range of local playmates, closer relationships with cousins and extended family, less sibling rivalry, fewer complaints to their parents of being bored, and fewer parent-child arguments.

In the United States, links between minority underperformance in schools have been made with a lacking in the cultural resources of cultural capital, social capital and economic capital, yet inconsistencies persist even when these variables are accounted for. &quot;Once admitted to institutions of higher education, African Americans and Latinos continued to underperform relative to their white and Asian counterparts, earning lower grades, progressing at a slower rate and dropping out at higher rates. More disturbing was the fact that these differentials persisted even after controlling for obvious factors such as SAT scores and family socioeconomic status&quot;.

The theory of capital deficiency is among the most recognized explanations for minority underperformance academically—that for whatever reason they simply lack the resources to find academic success. One of the largest factors for this, aside from the social, economic, and cultural capital mentioned earlier, is human capital. This form of capital, identified by social scientists only in recent years, has to do with the education and life preparation of children. &quot;Human capital refers to the skills, abilities and knowledge possessed by specific individuals&quot;. 

This allows college-educated parents who have large amounts of human capital to invest in their children in certain ways to maximize future success—from reading to them at night to possessing a better understanding of the school system which causes them to be less deferential to teachers and school authorities. Research also shows that well-educated black parents are less able to transmit human capital to their children when compared to their white counterparts, due to a legacy of racism and discrimination.

===Health===
The term &quot;social gradient&quot; in health refers to the idea that the inequalities in health are connected to the social status a person has. Two ideas concerning the relationship between health and social mobility are the social causation hypothesis and the health selection hypothesis. These hypotheses explore whether health dictates social mobility or whether social mobility dictates quality of health. The social causation hypothesis states that social factors, such as individual behavior and the environmental circumstances, determine an individual&#x27;s health. Conversely, the health selection hypothesis states that health determines what social stratum an individual will be in.

There has been a lot of research investigating the relationship between socioeconomic status and health and which has the greater influence on the other. A recent study has found that the social causation hypothesis is more empirically supported than the health selection hypothesis. Empirical analysis shows no support for the health selection hypothesis. Another study found support for either hypotheses depends on which lens the relationship between SES and health is being looked through. The health selection hypothesis is supported when people looking at SES and health through labor market lens. One possible reason for this is health dictates an individual&#x27;s productivity and to a certain extent if the individual is employed. While, the social causation hypothesis is supported when looking at health and socioeconomic status relationship through an education and income lenses.

===Education===
The systems of stratification that govern societies hinder or allow social mobility. Education can be a tool used by individuals to move from one stratum to another in stratified societies. Higher education policies have worked to establish and reinforce stratification. Greater gaps in education quality and investment in students among elite and standard universities account for the lower upward social mobility of the middle class and/or low class. Conversely, the upper class is known to be self-reproducing since they have the necessary resources and money to afford, and get into, an elite university. This class is self-reproducing because these same students can then give the same opportunities to their children. Another example of this is high and middle socioeconomic status parents are able to send their children to an early education program, enhancing their chances at academic success in the later years.

===Housing===
Mixed housing is the idea that people of different socioeconomic statuses can live in one area. There is not a lot of research on the effects of mixed housing. However, the general consensus is that mixed housing will allow individuals of low socioeconomic status to acquire the necessary resources and social connections to move up the social ladder. Other possible effects mixed housing can bring are positive behavioral changes and improved sanitation and safer living conditions for the low socioeconomic status residents. This is because higher socioeconomic status individuals are more likely to demand higher quality residencies, schools, and infrastructure. This type of housing is funded by profit, nonprofit and public organizations.

The existing research on mixed housing, however, shows that mixed housing does not promote or facilitate upward social mobility. Instead of developing complex relationships among each other, mixed housing residents of different socioeconomic statuses tend to engage in casual conversations and keep to themselves. If noticed and unaddressed for a long period of time, this can lead to the gentrification of a community.

Outside of mixed housing, individuals with a low socioeconomic status consider relationships to be more salient than the type of neighborhood they live to their prospects of moving up the social ladder. This is because their income is often not enough to cover their monthly expenses including rent. The strong relationships they have with others offers the support system they need in order for them to meet their monthly expenses. At times, low income families might decide to double up in a single residency to lessen the financial burden on each family. However, this type of support system, that low socioeconomic status individuals have, is still not enough to promote upward relative mobility.

===Income===
 Economic and social mobility are two separate entities. Economic mobility is used primarily by economists to evaluate income mobility. Conversely, social mobility is used by sociologists to evaluate primarily class mobility. How strongly economic and social mobility are related depends on the strength of the intergenerational relationship between class and income of parents and kids, and &quot;the covariance between parents&#x27; and children&#x27;s class position&quot;.

Economic and social mobility can also be thought of as following the Great Gatsby curve. This curve demonstrates that high levels of economic inequality fosters low rates of relative social mobility. The culprit behind this model is the Economic Despair idea, which states that as the gap between the bottom and middle of income distribution increases, those who are at the bottom are less likely to invest in their human capital, as they lose faith in their ability and fair chance to experience upward mobility. An example of this is seen in education, particularly in high school drop-outs. Low income status students who no longer see value in investing in their education, after continuously failing to upgrade their social status.

===Race===
Race as an influencer on social mobility stems from colonial times. There has been discussion as to whether race can still hinder an individual&#x27;s chances at upward mobility or whether class has a greater influence. A study performed on the Brazilian population found that racial inequality was only present for those who did not belong to the high-class status. Meaning race affects an individual&#x27;s chances at upward mobility if they do not begin at the upper-class population. Another theory concerning race and mobility is, as time progresses, racial inequality will be replaced by class inequality. However, other research has found that minorities, particularly African Americans, are still being policed and observed more at their jobs than their white counterparts. The constant policing has often led to the frequent firing of African Americans. In this case, African Americans experience racial inequality that stunts their upward social mobility.

===Gender===

A 2019 Indian study, found that Indian women, in comparison to men, experience less social mobility. One possible reason for this is the poor quality or lack of education that females receive. In countries like India it is common for educated women not use their education to move up the social ladder due to cultural and traditional customs. They are expected to become homemakers and leave the bread winning to the men. 

A 2017 study of Indian women found that women are denied an education, as their families may find it more economically beneficial to invest in the education and wellbeing of their males instead of their females. In the parent&#x27;s eyes the son will be the one who provides for them in their old age while the daughter will move away with her husband. The son will bring an income while the daughter might require a dowry to get married. 

When women enter the workforce, they are highly unlikely to earn the same pay as their male counterparts. Women can even differ in pay among each other due to race. To combat these gender disparities, the UN has made it one of their goals on the Millennium Development Goals reduce gender inequality. This goal is accused of being too broad and having no action plan.

==Patterns of mobility==

While it is generally accepted that some level of mobility in society is desirable, there is no consensus agreement upon &quot;how much&quot; social mobility is good for or bad for a society. There is no international benchmark of social mobility, though one can compare measures of mobility across regions or countries or within a given area over time. While cross-cultural studies comparing differing types of economies are possible, comparing economies of similar type usually yields more comparable data. Such comparisons typically look at intergenerational mobility, examining the extent to which children born into different families have different life chances and outcomes.

In a 2009 study, &quot;The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better&quot;, Wilkinson and Pickett conducted an exhaustive analysis of social mobility in developed countries. In addition to other correlations with negative social outcomes for societies having high inequality, they found a relationship between high social inequality and low social mobility. Of the eight countries studied—Canada, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany, the UK and the US, the US had both the highest economic inequality and lowest economic mobility. In this and other studies, the US had very low mobility at the lowest rungs of the socioeconomic ladder, with mobility increasing slightly as one goes up the ladder. At the top rung of the ladder, mobility again decreases.

A 2006 study comparing social mobility between developed countries found that the four countries with the lowest &quot;intergenerational income elasticity&quot;, i.e. the highest social mobility, were Denmark, Norway, Finland and Canada with less than 20% of advantages of having a high income parent passed on to their children.
A 2012 study found &quot;a clear negative relationship&quot; between income inequality and intergenerational mobility. Countries with low levels of inequality such as Denmark, Norway and Finland had some of the greatest mobility, while the two countries with the high level of inequality—Chile and Brazil—had some of the lowest mobility.

In Britain, much debate on social mobility has been generated by comparisons of the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS) and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study BCS70, which compare intergenerational mobility in earnings between the 1958 and the 1970 UK cohorts, and claim that intergenerational mobility decreased substantially in this 12-year period. These findings have been controversial, partly due to conflicting findings on social class mobility using the same datasets, and partly due to questions regarding the analytical sample and the treatment of missing data. UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has famously said that trends in social mobility &quot;are not as we would have liked&quot;.

Along with the aforementioned &quot;Do Poor Children Become Poor Adults?&quot; study, &quot;The Economist&quot; also stated that &quot;evidence from social scientists suggests that American society is much &#x27;stickier&#x27; than most Americans assume. Some researchers claim that social mobility is actually declining.&quot; A 2006 German study corroborates these results. 

In spite of this low social mobility, in 2008, Americans had the highest belief in meritocracy among middle- and high-income countries. A 2014 study of social mobility among the French corporate class found that social class influences who reaches the top in France, with those from the upper-middle classes tending to dominate, despite a longstanding emphasis on meritocracy.

In 2014, Thomas Piketty found that wealth-income ratios seem to be returning to very high levels in low economic growth countries, similar to what he calls the &quot;classic patrimonial&quot; wealth-based societies of the 19th century, where a minority lives off its wealth while the rest of the population works for subsistence living.

Social mobility can also be influenced by differences that exist within education. The contribution of education to social mobility often gets neglected in social mobility research, although it really has the potential to transform the relationship between people&#x27;s social origins and destinations. Recognizing the disparities between strictly location and its educational opportunities highlights how patterns of educational mobility are influencing the capacity for individuals to experience social mobility. There is some debate regarding how important educational attainment is for social mobility. A substantial literature argues that there is a direct effect of social origins (DESO) which cannot be explained by educational attainment. 

Other evidence suggests that, using a sufficiently fine-grained measure of educational attainment, taking on board such factors as university status and field of study, education fully mediates the link between social origins and access to top class jobs.

In the US, the patterns of educational mobility that exist between inner-city schools versus schools in the suburbs is transparent. Graduation rates supply a rich context to these patterns. In the 2013–14 school year, Detroit Public Schools had a graduation rate of 71%. Grosse Pointe High School, a whiter Detroit suburb, had an average graduation rate of 94%. 

In 2017, a similar phenomena was observed in Los Angeles, California as well as in New York City. Los Angeles Senior High School (inner city) observed a graduation rate of 58% and San Marino High School (suburb) observed a graduation rate of 96%. New York City Geographic District Number Two (inner city) observed a graduation rate of 69% and Westchester School District (suburb) observed a graduation rate of 85%. These patterns were observed across the country when assessing the differences between inner city graduation rates and suburban graduation rates.

The economic grievance thesis argues that economic factors, such as deindustrialisation, economic liberalisation, and deregulation, are causing the formation of a &#x27;left-behind&#x27; precariat with low job security, high inequality, and wage stagnation, who then support populism. Some theories only focus on the effect of economic crises, or inequality. Another objection for economic reasons is due to the globalization that is taking place in the world today. In addition to criticism of the widening inequality caused by the elite, the widening inequality among the general public caused by the influx of immigrants and other factors due to globalization is also a target of populist criticism.

The evidence of increasing economic disparity and volatility of family incomes is clear, particularly in the United States, as shown by the work of Thomas Piketty and others. Commentators such as Martin Wolf emphasize the importance of economics. They warn that such trends increase resentment and make people susceptible to populist rhetoric. Evidence for this is mixed. At the macro level, political scientists report that xenophobia, anti-immigrant ideas, and resentment towards out-groups tend to be higher during difficult economic times. Economic crises have been associated with gains by far-right political parties. However, there is little evidence at the micro- or individual level to link individual economic grievances and populist support. Populist politicians tend to put pressure on central bank independence.

==Influence of intelligence and education==

Social status attainment and therefore social mobility in adulthood are of interest to psychologists, sociologists, political scientists, economists, epidemiologists and many more. The reason behind the interest is because it indicates access to material goods, educational opportunities, healthy environments, and economic growth.

In Scotland, a long range study examined individuals in childhood and mid-adulthood. Most Scottish children born in 1921 participated in the Scottish Mental Survey 1932, conducted by the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE) It obtained the data of psychometric intelligence of Scottish pupils. The number of children who took the mental ability test (based on the Moray House tests) was 87,498. They were between age 10 and 11. The tests covered general, spatial and numerical reasoning.

At midlife period, a subset of the subjects participated in one of the studies, which were large health studies of adults and were carried out in Scotland in the 1960s and 1970s. The particular study they took part in was the collaborative study of 6022 men and 1006 women, conducted between 1970 and 1973 in Scotland. Participants completed a questionnaire (participant&#x27;s address, father&#x27;s occupation, the participant&#x27;s own first regular occupation, the age of finishing full-time education, number of siblings, and if the participant was a regular car driver) and attended a physical examination (measurement of height). Social class was coded according to the Registrar General&#x27;s Classification for the participant&#x27;s occupation at the time of screening, his first occupation and his father&#x27;s occupation. Researchers separated into six social classes were used.

A correlation and structural equation model analysis was conducted. In the structural equation models, social status in the 1970s was the main outcome variable. The main contributors to education (and first social class) were father&#x27;s social class and IQ at age 11, which was also found in a Scandinavian study. This effect was direct and also mediated via education and the participant&#x27;s first job.

Participants at midlife did not necessarily end up in the same social class as their fathers. There was social mobility in the sample: 45% of men were upwardly mobile, 14% were downward mobile and 41% were socially stable. IQ at age 11 had a graded relationship with participant&#x27;s social class. The same effect was seen for father&#x27;s occupation. Men at midlife social class I and II (the highest, more professional) also had the highest IQ at age 11. 

Height at midlife, years of education and childhood IQ were significantly positively related to upward social mobility, while number of siblings had no significant effect. For each standard deviation increase in IQ score at the age 11, the chances of upward social mobility increases by 69% (with a 95% confidence). After controlling the effect of independent variables, only IQ at age 11 was significantly inversely related to downward movement in social mobility. More years of education increase the chance that a father&#x27;s son will surpass his social class, whereas low IQ makes a father&#x27;s son prone to falling behind his father&#x27;s social class.
Higher IQ at age 11 was also significantly related to higher social class at midlife, higher likelihood car driving at midlife, higher first social class, higher father&#x27;s social class, fewer siblings, higher age of education, being taller and living in a less deprived neighbourhood at midlife. IQ was significantly more strongly related to the social class in midlife than the social class of the first job.

Height, education and IQ at age 11 were predictors of upward social mobility and only IQ at age 11 and height were significant predictors of downward social mobility. Number of siblings was not significant in either of the models.

Another research looked into the pivotal role of education in association between ability and social class attainment through three generations (fathers, participants and offspring) using the SMS1932 (Lothian Birth Cohort 1921) educational data, childhood ability and late life intellectual function data. It was proposed that social class of origin acts as a ballast restraining otherwise meritocratic social class movement, and that education is the primary means through which social class movement is both restrained and facilitated—therefore acting in a pivotal role.

It was found that social class of origin predicts educational attainment in both the participant&#x27;s and offspring generations. Father&#x27;s social class and participant&#x27;s social class held the same importance in predicting offspring educational attainment—effect across two generations. Educational attainment mediated the association of social class attainments across generations (father&#x27;s and participants social class, participant&#x27;s and offspring&#x27;s social class). There was no direct link between social classes across generations, but in each generation educational attainment was a predictor of social class, which is consistent with other studies. 

Participant&#x27;s childhood ability moderately predicted their educational and social class attainment (.31 and .38). Participant&#x27;s educational attainment was strongly linked with the odds of moving downward or upward on the social class ladder. For each SD increase in education, the odds of moving upward on the social class spectrum were 2.58 times greater. The downward ones were .26 times greater. Offspring&#x27;s educational attainment was also strongly linked with the odds of moving upward or downward on the social class ladder. For each SD increase in education, the odds of moving upward were 3.54 times greater. The downward ones were .40 times greater. In conclusion, education is very important, because it is the fundamental mechanism functioning both to hold individuals in their social class of origin and to make it possible for their movement upward or downward on the social class ladder.

In the Cohort 1936 it was found that regarding whole generations (not individuals) the social mobility between father&#x27;s and participant&#x27;s generation is: 50.7% of the participant generation have moved upward in relation to their fathers, 22.1% had moved downwards, and 27.2% had remained stable in their social class. There was a lack of social mobility in the offspring generation as a whole. However, there was definitely individual offspring movement on the social class ladder: 31.4% had higher social class attainment than their participant parents (grandparents), 33.7% moved downward, and 33.9% stayed stable. Participant&#x27;s childhood mental ability was linked to social class in all three generations. A very important pattern has also been confirmed: average years of education increased with social class and IQ.

There were some great contributors to social class attainment and social class mobility in the twentieth century: Both social class attainment and social mobility are influenced by pre-existing levels of mental ability, which was in consistence with other studies. So, the role of individual level mental ability in pursuit of educational attainment—professional positions require specific educational credentials. Educational attainment contributes to social class attainment through the contribution of mental ability to educational attainment. Mental ability can contribute to social class attainment independent of actual educational attainment, as in when the educational attainment is prevented, individuals with higher mental ability manage to make use of the mental ability to work their way up on the social ladder.

This study made clear that intergenerational transmission of educational attainment is one of the key ways in which social class was maintained within family, and there was also evidence that education attainment was increasing over time. Finally, the results suggest that social mobility (moving upward and downward) has increased in recent years in Britain. Which according to one researcher is important because an overall mobility of about 22% is needed to keep the distribution of intelligence relatively constant from one generation to the other within each occupational category.

In 2010, researchers looked into the effects elitist and non-elitist education systems have on social mobility. Education policies are often critiqued based on their impact on a single generation, but it is important to look at education policies and the effects they have on social mobility. In the research, elitist schools are defined as schools that focus on providing its best students with the tools to succeed, whereas an egalitarian school is one that predicates itself on giving equal opportunity to all its students to achieve academic success. When private education supplements were not considered, it was found that the greatest amount of social mobility was derived from a system with the least elitist public education system. It was also discovered that the system with the most elitist policies produced the greatest amount of utilitarian welfare. Logically, social mobility decreases with more elitist education systems and utilitarian welfare decreases with less elitist public education policies.

When private education supplements are introduced, it becomes clear that some elitist policies promote some social mobility and that an egalitarian system is the most successful at creating the maximum amount of welfare. These discoveries were justified from the reasoning that elitist education systems discourage skilled workers from supplementing their children&#x27;s educations with private expenditures.

The authors of the report showed that they can challenge conventional beliefs that elitist and regressive educational policy is the ideal system. This is explained as the researchers found that education has multiple benefits. It brings more productivity and has a value, which was a new thought for education. This shows that the arguments for the regressive model should not be without qualifications. Furthermore, in the elitist system, the effect of earnings distribution on growth is negatively impacted due to the polarizing social class structure with individuals at the top with all the capital and individuals at the bottom with nothing.

Education is very important in determining the outcome of one&#x27;s future. It is almost impossible to achieve upward mobility without education. Education is frequently seen as a strong driver of social mobility. The quality of one&#x27;s education varies depending on the social class that they are in. The higher the family income the better opportunities one is given to get a good education. The inequality in education makes it harder for low-income families to achieve social mobility. Research has indicated that inequality is connected to the deficiency of social mobility. In a period of growing inequality and low social mobility, fixing the quality of and access to education has the possibility to increase equality of opportunity for all Americans.

&quot;One significant consequence of growing income inequality is that, by historical standards, high-income households are spending much more on their children&#x27;s education than low-income households.&quot; With the lack of total income, low-income families cannot afford to spend money on their children&#x27;s education. Research has shown that over the past few years, families with high income has increased their spending on their children&#x27;s education. High income families were paying $3,500 per year and now it has increased up to nearly $9,000, which is seven times more than what low income families pay for their kids&#x27; education. The increase in money spent on education has caused an increase in college graduation rates for the families with high income. The increase in graduation rates is causing an even bigger gap between high income children and low-income children. Given the significance of a college degree in today&#x27;s labor market, rising differences in college completion signify rising differences in outcomes in the future.

Family income is one of the most important factors in determining the mental ability (intelligence) of their children. With such bad education that urban schools are offering, parents of high income are moving out of these areas to give their children a better opportunity to succeed. As urban school systems worsen, high income families move to rich suburbs because that is where they feel better education is; if they do stay in the city, they put their children to private schools. Low income families do not have a choice but to settle for the bad education because they cannot afford to relocate to rich suburbs. The more money and time parents invest in their child plays a huge role in determining their success in school. Research has shown that higher mobility levels are perceived for locations where there are better schools.

<text>William Gaston Caperton III (born February 21, 1940) is an American politician who served as the 31st governor of West Virginia from 1989 to 1997. He was president of the College Board, which administers the nationally recognized SAT and AP tests, from 1999 to 2012. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

==Pre-gubernatorial history==
Caperton was born in Charleston, West Virginia. He attended Dexter School (Brookline, Massachusetts), Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon.

After graduation, he returned to Charleston to manage a family-owned insurance firm. He soon became its principal owner and, under his watch, it became the tenth largest privately owned insurance brokerage firm in the nation. Caperton owned a bank and mortgage banking firm. Caperton was elected governor in his first attempt to seek public office in 1988.

==Gubernatorial history, 1988–1997==

===Elections===
In the 1988 gubernatorial election, Caperton, initially considered a long-shot for his party&#x27;s nomination, won a crowded primary in a narrow plurality over the 1984 nominee and Speaker of the State House Clyde M. See Jr., then in the general election, again as an underdog, upset the Republican incumbent, Arch A. Moore Jr.

In the 1992 election, Caperton was challenged by State Senator Charlotte Pritt and then-state Attorney General Mario Palumbo in the Democratic primary. Caperton won the primary over Pritt and then the general election, defeating West Virginia Secretary of Agriculture Cleve Benedict, the Republican nominee, and Pritt, who ran as a write-in candidate.

Caperton was constitutionally prohibited from running for a third consecutive term in 1996. He ended up supporting the Republican nominee, former Governor Cecil Underwood, against Pritt, which led to a party split and bad feelings among some in the state party.

===Financial policy===
During his first term as the state&#x27;s 31st governor, Caperton supported the passages of ethics, road-building, and education bills. He raised taxes in an effort to improve West Virginia&#x27;s finances, thereby reducing debts exceeding $500 million and creating a $100 million surplus. Because of the reforms, &quot;Financial World&quot; magazine called the state the most improved in the nation. Critics accused Caperton of failing to keep a campaign promise not to raise taxes, but defenders claimed that the previous governor had misstated the condition of the state&#x27;s finances and failed to disclose the need for tax increases.

===Education policy===
Publicly, Governor Caperton emphasized that education was his first priority. Caperton supported a school-building program that led to $800 million in investments for 58 new schools and 780 school renovations, directly benefiting two-thirds of West Virginia&#x27;s public school students. After a brief strike by the state&#x27;s public educators, Caperton raised teachers&#x27; salaries from 49th to 31st in the nation and trained more than 19,000 educators through a statewide Center for Professional Development with the goal of putting technology to its best use in West Virginia&#x27;s classrooms. He encouraged the use of computers and technology in West Virginia public schools, resulting in the West Virginia Basic Skills Computer Program, which began with kindergarten and extended through sixth grade. His common refrain for &quot;computers in every classroom&quot; since has been expanded to include grades 7–12. In 1996, West Virginia&#x27;s advances in education technology gained national recognition when Caperton received the Computerworld Smithsonian Award. Award sponsors called Caperton a &quot;visionary&quot; who &quot;fundamentally changed the education system in America&quot; by using technological innovations. Information about Caperton and his work is included in the Smithsonian&#x27;s Permanent Research Collection. In January 1997, the magazine Education Week, conducted a study of the nation&#x27;s education system and highlighted West Virginia for the state&#x27;s use of technology in education.

===Economic policy===
As governor, Caperton focused his efforts on economic development, modern roads and infrastructure, prisons and jails, a clean environment, health care, and government management. West Virginia&#x27;s economy improved during his eight-year tenure. Unemployment dropped from 9.8% to 6.2%, the result of creating approximately 86,000 new jobs. As part of his efforts to promote a clean environment, on August 13, 1992, Governor Gaston Caperton announced the creation of the West Virginia Streams Restoration Program, dedicated to treating acid drainage from coal mining.

===National leadership roles===
Near the end of his second term, Caperton was the 1996 chair of the Democratic Governors&#x27; Association, served on the National Governors&#x27; Association executive committee, and was a member of the Intergovernmental Policy Advisory Committee on U.S. Trade. He was chairman of the Appalachian Regional Commission, Southern Regional Education Board, and the Southern Growth Policy Board. Caperton has received numerous state and national awards and special recognition, including ten honorary doctoral degrees. 

===Tamarack===
Another product of Caperton&#x27;s tenure is the &quot;Tamarack, the Best of West Virginia&quot;. The facility is a museum, art gallery, and collection of studios for visiting artists that showcases products of West Virginia and organizes the state&#x27;s &quot;cottage industry.&quot; Tamarack is the center of an integrated distribution and marketing network for products by more than 1,200 West Virginia artists. The Rosen Group, publisher of Niche magazine, named Caperton the 1997 Humanitarian of the Year for creating a progressive market for the state&#x27;s cottage industry.

==Post-gubernatorial career==
After completing his second term, the former governor taught at Harvard University in the spring of 1997 as a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics. He founded the Institute on Education and Government at Columbia University.

Caperton became President and CEO of the College Board on July 1, 1999. The New York City based College Board is a nonprofit membership association of more than 4,200 schools, colleges and other educational institutions throughout America. The College Board is best known for its SAT college admissions exam and for its Advanced Placement Program, which offers high school students access to college-level course work. Since taking the helm of the College Board, Caperton has sought to enhance the standing and expand the reach of these two programs and to launch a series of initiatives. As a result of one of these initiatives, AP courses became more available to inner city and rural students.

Caperton expresses concern about unequal educational opportunity, and he led an effort to encourage students at middle schools to go to college, particularly the least advantaged. His efforts prompted &quot;USA Today&quot; to label him an &quot;education crusader&quot;. The publication also named him one of the most influential people in America in its feature, &quot;People to Watch: 2001.&quot;

In 2004, Caperton led a successful campaign to revise the SAT when the College Board&#x27;s trustees requested changes to the test. The College Board introduced a set of changes to the SAT that include a writing test, more critical reading, and advanced math. The goal of the new SAT was to more closely reflect the coursework of the nation&#x27;s high school students while maintaining what the Board describes as the test&#x27;s level of rigor and excellence. The new SAT Reasoning Test was administered for the first time in March 2005.

Under Caperton&#x27;s leadership, the College Board led an effort called &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Ed!&quot; that was designed to elevate education as an issue in the 2012 presidential campaign. As part of that effort, the College Board hosted a presidential candidate forum on October 27, 2011 called &quot;The Future of American Education.&quot;

In 2012, Caperton wrote &quot;The Achievable Dream: College Board Lessons on Creating Great Schools,&quot; a book that highlights specific lessons of educational success that can be replicated in schools across the country.

Caperton was reportedly among the top candidates to fill the remainder of the late Senator Robert Byrd&#x27;s term. The appointment ultimately went to Carte Goodwin.

He is now the Vice Chairman for Leeds Equity Partners, a New York-based Private Equity firm focused solely on education. Caperton has worked in this capacity since January, 2013.

==Personal life==
William Gaston Caperton III was born in Charleston, Kanawha County. After attending Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia, and the University of North Carolina, he returned to Charleston to manage a family-owned insurance firm.

Caperton has been married three times. He and his first wife, Ella Dee Caperton (born Ella Kessel, Miss West Virginia 1964) divorced in 1989 during his first term, and she later unsuccessfully ran for election for state treasurer. Caperton and Dee had two boys, William Gaston (&quot;Gat&quot;) Caperton IV and John Caperton. Dee died in France on September 1, 2000.

Caperton&#x27;s second wife was the musical director/conductor of the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra, Rachael Worby. They divorced in 1998.

In 2003, Caperton married his third wife, Israeli-American Idit Harel, an MIT PhD and Harvard EdM, education technology expert, mother of three, and founder and CEO of MaMaMedia and Globaloria. She and Caperton divorced in 2012.

<doc id="420105" wikidata="Q780398" url="?curid=420105" title="Bob Wise">
<text>Robert Ellsworth Wise Jr. (born January 6, 1948) is an American politician who served as the 33rd governor of West Virginia from 2001 to 2005. A member of the Democratic Party, Wise also served in the United States House of Representatives from 1983 until 2001. In 2005 Wise became the president of the Alliance for Excellent Education, a nonprofit organization that focuses on reforming the nation&#x27;s high schools. In 2015, North Carolina State University honored Wise with the William and Ida Friday Institute for Educational Innovation&#x27;s Friday Medal which recognizes significant, distinguished and enduring contributions to education through advocating innovation, advancing education and imparting inspiration.

==Early life, education, and legal career==
Wise was born on January 6, 1948. He was raised in the Kanawha Valley of Kanawha County, West Virginia, with his two sisters and attended George Washington High School in nearby Charleston. His father worked in insurance, for McDonough Caperton Group, for thirty years. Wise ran track and field in high school – the half-mile and mile – and was elected vice president of the student body. Wise has won every election he&#x27;s been in since then.

Wise enrolled at Duke University in 1966, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science four years later. After leaving Duke, Wise applied to law school, working as an aide in a California mental health facility until he was accepted at the University of Houston. Wise relocated to Texas for his studies, eventually transferring to the Tulane University School of Law. He waited tables in New Orleans, working nightshifts while he obtained his Juris Doctor.

Wise graduated from Tulane in 1975 and opened his first law practice in Charleston. In his early days as a lawyer Wise helped create West Virginians for a Fair and Equitable Assessment of Taxes (FEAT), a group interested in property tax reform. Wise also advocated for coal miners seeking workers compensation and supported community renewal efforts for the 1972 Buffalo Creek disaster victims. In 1978, he once more helped with redevelopment issues for those affected by the Mingo County Floods.

==West Virginia State Senate (1980–1982)==

Wise began his political career in 1980, running for public office against State Senate President William Brotherton in the County Democratic primary in Kanawha. With endorsement from the West Virginia Education Association and other West Virginian labor organizations, Wise defeated Brotherton in an upset primary election and went on to win the general election in November, gaining a seat in the West Virginia Senate.

In his early days on the political scene, Wise was noted for having a lively campaign style, especially at rallies, and was referred to as &quot;the Boy Wonder of West Virginia politics” by the Charleston Daily Mail in 1982.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1983–2001)==
In 1982, Bob Wise ran for the United States Congress. He came out of a highly competitive Democratic primary victorious and continued on to beat incumbent Republican congressman Mick Staton with 58 percent of the vote.

Wise&#x27;s win against Staton would be the first of nine consecutive elections to the U.S. House of Representatives. During his 18-year turn (1983 – 2001) in the House, Wise ran once unopposed, in 1990, and had majorities as high as 74 percent – in 1988, against Republican Paul Hart – and 64 percent – in 1994 against Republican Samuel Cravotta.

While he was a member of Congress, Wise held such posts as regional whip, at-large whip, and parliamentarian. He represented the Second Congressional District which reaches from Harpers Ferry to the Ohio River and is considered to be one of the largest Districts eastward of the Mississippi River. In this same period Wise joined the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which allowed him to obtain federal aid for road projects in West Virginia.

During his time in congress, Wise also served as a member on the House Committee on Education and Labor and on the Democratic Party Leadership team. Among his biggest achievements during this time were the Chemical Right to Know legislation, the Wise Amendment to the Clean Air Act, and the Federal Mental Health Parity legislation.

It was during Wise&#x27;s time in congress that another West Virginian, and at one time the longest-serving member of Congress, Robert C. Byrd, called Wise “a steam engine with britches,” referring to Wise&#x27;s tireless dedication and service to his constituents.

==Governor of West Virginia (2001–2005)==
=== Campaign and early days===

In 2000, after 18 years in congress, Bob Wise left his now secure seat and returned to West Virginia to win the Democratic Primary for governorship with 63 percent of the vote. Wise then went on to challenge Republican incumbent Cecil H. Underwood. Wise highlighted the economy, education, health care, and the energy industry in his campaign speeches. In the end, Wise got just over 50 percent of the vote while Underwood received 47.

Wise was sworn in as governor on January 15, 2001, by Circuit Judge Dan O&#x27;Hanlon. In his inauguration speech, Wise spoke once more of improving health care and education as well as turning the economy around. Shortly after taking the position of governor, Wise had to deal with widespread flooding in record amounts throughout southern West Virginia.

===Education and Promise Scholarship===

Given a wide berth by the legislature for his handling of the flooding, Wise was able to move forward with his education and health care agendas. In education, Wise pushed for the funding of his Promise (Providing Real Opportunities for Maximizing Instate Student Excellence) scholarships. The program was funded through video lottery revenue, and inspired by the HOPE scholarship program in Georgia.

The first Promise scholarships were awarded in 2002 and provided full tuition for students with at least a 3.0 grade point average in high school and a combined SAT Reasoning Test score of 1,000 to attend a state college, university, or in-state private college. By requiring students who&#x27;d received the scholarship to complete at least 30 credits per year in order to stay eligible; Promise improved four year graduation rates by 7 percent and the percentage of students leaving the state to pursue post-secondary degrees dropped to the lowest levels since the mid-1990s.

In recent years, the now decade-old scholarship has been threatened budget cuts from the state legislature. Formerly a means of paying full tuition, the scholarship now covers $4,750 in a state where the average tuition is upwards of $6,000. There are currently 10,000 students in West Virginia attending college through the Promise scholarship.

Wise was the first governor to propose full funding for the Higher Education Grant Program. Wise also set up the Governor&#x27;s Hotline for Safer Schools, and put forward legislation to bring a in pre-Kindergarten programs that would cover all the state&#x27;s four-year-olds.

===Other achievements as governor===

As governor, Wise was able to widen enrollment in the federal Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program. 
The CHIP Program allowed the children of families making less than $34,000 a year to be eligible for health insurance.

Wise faced continual budget pressures throughout his governorship. These included road work and construction costs, school expenses, the state&#x27;s operating budget and teacher salaries. Halfway through his first term as governor, recession hit the United States economy and Wise introduced spending cuts of 10 percent to deal with demands on state revenue while still attempting to make improvements to infrastructure and reduce long-term debt.

Wise also attempted to attract businesses through an extensive tax and infrastructure assistance program. In one instance, the state issued $215 million in grants to spur $1 billion investment in projects, such as the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute, Cabela&#x27;s, the Marshall University Biotechnology Development Center and the West Virginia High Technology Consortium. Wise also turned his attention to mountaintop removal practices and malpractice insurance costs during this period.

In December 2002, Wise was elected chairman of the Southern Governors Association during his gubernatorial term and the following year. Charleston hosted the governors&#x27; annual meeting for the first time in 40 years. Wise was also chaired the National Governors Association Committee on Natural Resources and the Southern States Energy Board.

===Extramarital affair===

In 2003, Wise admitted to an affair with a married woman and stated that he would not seek reelection in 2004. He went on to “apologize deeply to the people of our state for my actions. In my private life, I have let many people down.&quot; Philip Frye, the husband of Angela Mascia-Frye, 35, a state worker, filed for divorce April 7, 2003, claiming she&#x27;d had an affair with Governor Wise.

Wise&#x27;s successor as governor, Secretary of State Joe Manchin, had already announced that he would oppose Wise in the primary election before the infidelity came to light. Manchin easily won the nomination and then the general election. On August 4, 2003, in an interview on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; before Wise&#x27;s withdrawal, Phillip Frye told Rob Corddry that he was running for governor, despite being unqualified, to be a nuisance to Wise.

==Post-political career==

===Alliance for Excellent Education===

Since 2005, Wise has been president of Alliance for Excellent Education, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to ensuring that all students, particularly those who are traditionally underserved, graduate from high school ready for success in college, work, and citizenship. The Alliance was founded in 1999 by Gerard and Lilo Leeds and is based in Washington, DC. Under Wise&#x27;s leadership, the Alliance has been a leading advocate for major education policy issues such digital learning, adolescent literacy, increasing high school graduation rates and the Common Core State Standards.

The Alliance is committed to preparing all graduating high school students for success in college and beyond, but it is especially focused on helping the lowest achievement quartile, the nation&#x27;s most at-risk high school students – roughly six million - to graduate into a more gainful and constructive future. In May 2016, a report released by Civic Enterprises and the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University, in partnership with America&#x27;s Promise Alliance and the Alliance for Excellent Education, found that the high school graduation rate had risen to a record high 82.3 percent.

Working alongside policymakers, the Alliance helps put together recommendations at the state and federal level for effective secondary school reform and higher levels of secondary-school student achievement. It also works to promote awareness of the kinds of reform necessary by hosting seminars, educational events, and presentations of national and state-level date about the impact higher levels of academic achievement might make cross the country.

====Digital Learning Day====

The Alliance, in 2011, established the Center for Secondary School Digital Learning and Policy. The Center&#x27;s mission was to examine ways technology and, specifically digital learning, might provide at-risk students with resources for ensuring they&#x27;d be prepared for graduation and college-level success. 
In 2012, the Alliance had its first nationwide Digital Learning Day. Millions of students and over 26,000 teachers took part in the event, which was created with the mission of celebrating productive uses of digital learning throughout the nation&#x27;s schools and the teachers who&#x27;ve supported and provided innovative digital options for their students.

In 2016, Digital Learning Day focused on digital equity and expanding students&#x27; access to the Internet. Bob Wise and Federal Communications Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel discussed ways to bring broadband connectivity to students beyond the classroom including a program in Coachella Valley Unified School District that equips school buses with wireless routers, and then parks the buses in low-income communities allowing students to remain connected to the Internet in off-school hours.

====Digital Learning Playbook====

A digital Town Hall was held alongside the event in which U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and then FCC chairman Julius Genachowski introduced a new guide for k-12 educators called the Digital Learning Playbook. The Playbook was created to help schools find ways to help students with new opportunities in digital learning.

====Project 24/Future Ready Schools====

Project 24 was announced in 2013 as a tool to aid school districts in developing their digital learning projects and overall use of technology for improving college and employment readiness. It was intended to be used as a roadmap for educators and administrators to ensure they are making the best use of the digital learning resources available to them and their students. In 2014, Bob Wise and over 100 school district superintendents met with President Barack Obama at the White House and announced a series of summits and planning resources for district superintendents who take the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s &quot;Future Ready District Pledge&quot; to develop the human and technological capacity needed to personalize learning using digital tools. In 2015, Project 24 was succeeded by the Future Ready Schools initiative, and hosted thirteen regional summits serving 463 districts and more than 2,200 education leaders representing over 4 million students.

===National Board of Professional Teaching Standards===

From 2009 to 2015, Bob Wise served as the Chairman of the Board of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. The National Board is an organization that seeks to promote and establish standards of excellence in teaching nationwide. It grew out of a 1983 report from the National Commission on Excellence in Education entitled &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot;. The report detailed a strong decline in America&#x27;s educational standards and performance. The report concentrated on the need for a foundational overhaul of the education system in the United States.

In June 2012, Wise presided over the 25th anniversary celebration of the NBPTS in the Mansfield Room of the U.S. Capitol. The reception included remarks by former US Department of Education United States Department of Education Secretary Richard W. Riley Richard Riley and .

In November 2012, the Harvard University Center for Education Policy Research announced new data that confirmed National Board-certified teachers outperformed non-certified teachers in elementary math and English Language Arts.

In January 2013, the NBPTS declared publicly that there are now more than 100,000 National Board Certified Teachers in all 50 states.

===Other achievements in education===

Since his involvement with the AEE and NBPTS, Gov. Wise has become a much in-demand speaker on education issues. He serves in an advisory capacity to the U.S. Department of Education, White House, the U.S. Congress, and National High School Center.

In 2010, along with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Wise put together the Digital Learning Council. The Council was made up of leaders in the field of education from all over the United States. The group met for several months and then released the study “10 Elements of High Quality Digital Learning.” 

The following year, Wise was included in the Non Profit Time&#x27;s “Power &amp; Influence Top 50” list of executives in the nonprofit sector. Alongside the AEE and the NBPTS, the former governor also serves on the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation and Performance Reporting which puts together rigorous accreditation standards for teacher preparation, the Gordon Commission, a commission of experts formed to examine the future of education, and the Business Roundtable&#x27;s Springboard Project which makes policy recommendations for equipping Americans with the skills they need to make in today&#x27;s workforce.

Wise received the Corporation for Public Broadcasting&#x27;s Thought Leader Award in 2013. The award is given to U.S. leaders who “affirm the essential services that public media provides to citizens in areas of education, journalism, and the arts.” In 2012, he was given the Charles W. Eliot Award from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges for his initiatives in education policy and in 2011 he received the National Association of State Boards of Education&#x27;s Friend of Education Award. That same year he was inducted into Marshall University&#x27;s June Harless Hall of Fame for establishing the PROMISE scholarship.

===C-Change===

Bob Wise was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had surgery in 1999. As a survivor, the former governor has long been a participant in the fight against cancer. In 2007, Members of the American Cancer Society gave Wise a ribbon in honor of his fight for survival as well as for increases on outdated tobacco taxes. 
&quot;There is really no excuse,&quot; Wise said on that occasion, advocating for basic procedures to detect cancer. &quot;I am fascinated by all of the excuses we make for not doing it.&quot;

Wise presently chairs, along with Mike Krzyzewski of Duke University, the national Board of Directors of C-Change. C-Change is an organization fighting to eliminate cancer by utilizing the resources of its private, public, and not-for-profit membership. The organization&#x27;s Board of Directors has 22 members and operates in the style of a town hall meeting in which various leaders in the fight on the disease gather several times year to discuss cancer-related topics.

Wise also serves on the board of advisors for the Moffitt Cancer Center.

===Campaign finance reform===

Wise is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One, whose website describes it as &quot;...the largest bipartisan group of former members of Congress and governors ever assembled on behalf of money-in-politics reform.&quot;

==Personal life==
During his time in Congress, Bob Wise met and later married Sandra Casber Wise, who was serving as counsel to the House Ways and Means Committee at the time. The couple have a son, Robert, and a daughter, Alexandra. The former governor has a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. He and his wife live in Washington, DC.

<doc id="420107" wikidata="Q1699735" url="?curid=420107" title="John D. Rockefeller III">
<text>John Davison Rockefeller III (March 21, 1906 – July 10, 1978) was an American philanthropist. Rockefeller was the eldest son and second child of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller as well as a grandson of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller. He was engaged in a wide range of philanthropic projects, many of which his family had launched, as well as supporting organizations related to East Asian affairs. Rockefeller was also a major supporter of the Population Council, and the committee that created the Lincoln Center in Manhattan.

==Early life==
On March 21, 1906, John Davison Rockefeller III was born in New York City, New York. His parents were John Davison Rockefeller Jr. (1874–1960) and Abigail Greene &quot;Abby&quot; Aldrich (1874–1948), philanthropists. He had four younger brothers, Nelson, Winthrop, Laurance and David, and an elder sister, Abby. Through his father, he was a grandson of Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller Sr. and schoolteacher Laura Celestia &quot;Cettie&quot; Spelman. Through his mother, he was a grandson of Senator Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich and Abigail Pearce Truman &quot;Abby&quot; Chapman. He received his preparatory education at the Browning School in New York City and the Loomis Chaffee School, Windsor, Connecticut, in 1925. He went to Princeton University where he received high honors in economics and graduated in 1929 with the degree of Bachelor of Science, choosing industrial relations as the subject of his senior thesis. His interest in industrial relations stemmed from the family&#x27;s role in the Ludlow Massacre, in which strikebreakers and security guards killed women and children of miners striking against the Rockefeller-controlled Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. Rockefeller&#x27;s father worked to restore the family&#x27;s public reputation by championing industrial relations and the work of William Lyon Mackenzie King, a pioneer in the field.

Commencing a lifelong commitment to international relations, he undertook a world tour after graduating from college, which concluded with assignments for the Institute of Pacific Relations conference in Japan.

==Institutional positions/activities==
John III was the next Rockefeller manager for all family undertakings of social relevance. Since 1929, in total he sat on twenty boards of various institutions, most of which were family-related. The more notable of these were:
*Rockefeller University – then the &quot;Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research&quot; (established by Senior);
*Colonial Williamsburg (John Jr., Abby);
*Riverside Church (John Jr.);
*International House of New York (John Jr.);
*General Education Board – later the &quot;International Education Board&quot; (Senior);
*China Medical Board (John Sr., John Jr.);
*Bureau of Social Hygiene (John Jr.);
*Industrial Relations Counselors (John Jr.).

John III was at one time a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Foreign Policy Association and the Institute of Pacific Relations, as well as being on the board of directors of Princeton University. In late 1950, he accompanied secretary of state John Foster Dulles and Douglas MacArthur on a trip to Japan to conclude a peace treaty, during which time he consulted with many Japanese leaders in practically every important sphere of that country&#x27;s life.

He was a prominent third-generation family philanthropist in his own right and founder of the Asia Society, the major institution he established in 1956 to foster greater cooperation between Asia and the United States. He also founded the Population Council in 1952, and a reconstituted Japan Society. In addition, he set up the United Negro College Fund for the ongoing education of African Americans, carrying on the family tradition in this area with his grandfather&#x27;s funding of the education of black women at Spelman College in Atlanta.

He was on his father&#x27;s Advisory Committee in the family office, Room 5600. He was also president of the family&#x27;s principal philanthropy run by family members, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, from its inception in 1940 to 1956. In 1929, he joined the family&#x27;s renowned Rockefeller Foundation; elected to the board in 1931 he subsequently became chairman of this major philanthropic organization for twenty years and was responsible for changing the focus of the institution.

The principal philanthropic institution he created was the JDR III Fund in 1963, its major program being the Asian Cultural Program, created in 1967 to encourage East-West cultural exchange. The Fund was wound-up upon his death in 1979, but the Cultural Program continued as the Asian Cultural Council, which has provided grant assistance to more than 4,000 Asians and Americans in the area of the arts. Funding for its programs is derived from a combination of endowment income and contributions from individuals, foundations and corporations in the United States and Asia. 

In the mid-1950s, John III assumed the leadership of the Exploratory Committee for a Musical Arts Center, a committee of civic leaders who were working to create what would become Lincoln Center. He was the key figure in the fund-raising efforts and in forging a consensus among the civic leaders and others who were essential to its success. The Center itself was built over a period from 1959 to 1969. He was its second president, commencing in 1956, and he became its chairman in 1961. He was chairman until 1970 when he was duly elected honorary chairman.

In the late 1960s, Rockefeller III was responsible for the creation of the Commission on Foundations and Private Philanthropy (usually known as the Peterson Commission, headed by Peter G. Peterson) and the Commission on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs (usually known as the Filer Commission). He established the Rockefeller Public Service Awards in 1958. In 1959, he received The Hundred Year Association of New York&#x27;s Gold Medal Award &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York&quot;. In 1976, he received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards. 

Rockefeller III was chairman of the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future, which was created to provide recommendations to the United States government regarding population growth and its social consequences. The Commission was established by Congress in 1970 and submitted its final recommendations in 1972.

==Posthumous honors==
Rockefeller College at Princeton University was named in his honor in 1982.

The John D. Rockefeller III National Tournament of Elementary School State Champions, an annual national-championship chess tournament run by US Chess, was named in his honor in 2020.

==Personal life==
On November 11, 1932, he married the socially connected Blanchette Ferry Hooker (1909–1992), who was to serve as chairman of the Asian Cultural Council from 1980 to 1990, and who established the Blanchette H. Rockefeller Fellowship Fund, in Japan. They had one son and three daughters:

*John Davison &quot;Jay&quot; Rockefeller IV – a former U.S. Senator from West Virginia and a former two-term governor of that state
*Hope Aldrich Rockefeller
*Sandra Ferry Rockefeller
*Alida Ferry Rockefeller

===Death===
Rockefeller was killed in an automobile accident in Mount Pleasant, New York (near the Rockefeller family estate in Pocantico), on July 10, 1978, at the age of 72. He is buried at the Rockefeller Family Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

<doc id="420108" wikidata="Q2711419" url="?curid=420108" title="Hurricane Agnes">
<text>Hurricane Agnes was the costliest hurricane to hit the United States at the time, causing an estimated $2.1 billion in damage. The hurricane&#x27;s death toll was 128. The effects of Agnes were widespread, from the Caribbean to Canada, with much of the east coast of the United States affected. Damage was heaviest in Pennsylvania, where Agnes was the state&#x27;s wettest tropical cyclone. Due to the significant effects, the name &quot;Agnes&quot; was retired in the spring of 1973.

Agnes was the second tropical cyclone and first named storm of the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season. It developed as a tropical depression on June 14 from the interaction of a polar front and an upper trough over the Yucatán Peninsula. The storm emerged into the western Caribbean Sea on June 15, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Agnes the next day. Thereafter, Agnes slowly curved northward and passed just west of Cuba on June 17. Early on June 18, the storm intensified enough to be upgraded to Hurricane Agnes. Heading northward, the hurricane eventually made landfall near Panama City, Florida, late on June 19. After moving inland, Agnes rapidly weakened and was only a tropical depression when it entered Georgia. The weakening trend halted as the storm crossed over Georgia and into South Carolina. While over eastern North Carolina, Agnes re-strengthened into a tropical storm on June 21, as a result of baroclinic activity. Early the following day, the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean before re-curving northwestward and making landfall near New York City as a strong tropical storm. Agnes quickly became an extratropical cyclone on June 23, and tracked to the northwest of Great Britain, before being absorbed by another extratropical cyclone on July 6.

Though it moved slowly across the Yucatán Peninsula, the damage Agnes caused in Mexico is unknown. Although the storm bypassed the tip of Cuba, heavy rainfall occurred, killing seven people. In Florida, Agnes caused a significant tornado outbreak, with at least 26 confirmed twisters, two of which were spawned in Georgia. The tornadoes and two initially unconfirmed tornadoes in Florida alone resulted in over $4.5 million (1972 USD) in damage and six fatalities. At least 2,082 structures in Florida suffered either major damage or were destroyed. About 1,355 other dwellings experienced minor losses. Though Agnes made landfall as a hurricane, no hurricane-force winds were reported. Along the coast abnormally high tides resulted in extensive damage, especially between Apalachicola and Cedar Key. Light to moderate rainfall was reported in Florida, though no significant flooding occurred. In Georgia, damage was limited to two tornadoes, which caused approximately $275,000 in losses. Minimal effects were also recorded in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Tennessee; though one fatality was reported in Delaware. The most significant effects, by far, occurred in Pennsylvania, mostly due to intense flooding. The tropical storm severely flooded the Susquehanna River and the Lackawanna River, causing major damage to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton metropolitan area. In both Pennsylvania and New Jersey combined, about 43,594 structures were either destroyed or significantly damaged. In Canada, a mobile home was toppled, killing two people.

==Meteorological history==

In early-mid June 1972, atmospheric conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis in the Caribbean Sea. Banded convection developed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea by June 11, though the system did not significantly organize. After an upper trough moved east, wind shear decreased, causing lower atmospheric pressures observations in Cozumel, Quintana Roo, Mexico. It is estimated that a tropical depression developed by 1200 UTC on June 14, while centered over the Yucatán Peninsula, about southeast of Mérida, Yucatán. The depression tracked eastward and entered the western Caribbean Sea on June 15. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories on the depression until 1500 UTC on June 15. Early on June 16 at 0000 UTC, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Agnes. However, the depression was not operationally upgraded until sixteen hours later.

After becoming a tropical storm on June 16, Agnes slowly curved northward and approached the Yucatán Channel. Late on June 17, it was noted that projected path indicated the possibly of landfall in western Cuba. However, the storm remained offshore, though it closely brushed the western tip of Cuba. At 1200 UTC on June 18, Agnes intensified into a hurricane while in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Prematurely, the National Hurricane Center operationally upgraded Agnes to a hurricane at 0200 UTC on that day. Upon becoming a hurricane, Agnes attained its maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h), though it had not reached its minimum atmospheric pressure. Due to unfavorable conditions, Agnes leveled-off slightly in intensity and weakened to a minimal hurricane while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States. Shortly before 2200 UTC on June 19, Agnes made landfall near Cape San Blas, Florida with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h).
At 0000 UTC on June 20, only a few hours after moving inland, Agnes weakened to a tropical storm. After crossing the Florida/Alabama/Georgia stateline, Agnes rapidly weakened to a tropical depression. While over Georgia, the depression curved northeastward and eventually to the east-northeast after entering South Carolina. Though the storm had not dissipated, the National Hurricane Center issued its final bulletin on Agnes at 1600 UTC on June 20. By early on June 21, a large extratropical trough spawned a low pressure area, which resulted in baroclinic activity. As a result, Agnes restrengthened into a tropical storm at 1800 UTC on June 21, while centered over eastern North Carolina. Three hours later, the National Hurricane Center noted decreasing atmospheric pressures, and indicated that winds had reached gale-force winds and once again upgraded Agnes to a tropical storm. By early on June 22, Agnes emerged into the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, where it continued to re-intensify. At 1200 UTC, Agnes reached its minimum atmospheric pressure of , as reported by a reconnaissance aircraft. However, maximum sustained winds were at only 70 mph (110 km/h). Late on June 22, Agnes made its final landfall on Long Beach, New York, on Long Island, with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h).

Agnes changed into an extratropical cyclone once cold air invaded its circulation late on June 22, completing its extratropical transition on the next day. The system looped across south-central Pennsylvania on June 23 and then looped across southern Ontario on June 25. It spawned a tornado in Maniwaki, Québec, early that day, which killed two and injured 11 people. The cyclone sped east-northeast, reaching Cape Breton Island on June 27 before intensifying as it re-entered the North Atlantic. After moving as far north as the 61st parallel while crossing the 25th meridian west on the morning of June 29, Agnes turned southeastward. Its central pressure bottomed out near towards 0000 UTC on June 30. Between July 1 and July 3, the long-lived system looped between Ireland and Iceland while weakening once more. The system turned northeast, strengthening one more time while accelerating across the Hebrides on July 4 through 5. A stronger system moving in from the west finally absorbed Agnes on July 6, while located to the southeast of Iceland.

==Preparations==
By 2200 UTC on June 17, the National Weather Service issued gale warnings and a hurricane watch for the Straits of Florida and the Florida Keys from Key West to Dry Tortugas. On the following day at 1600 UTC, another hurricane watch was put into effective from Cedar Key to Pensacola. In addition, the gale warnings in the Florida Keys were extended to include areas from Fort Myers Beach to Clearwater. At 2200 UTC on June 18, a hurricane warning became effective from St. Marks to Panama City. The gale warnings which were in effect for the Florida Keys and Fort Myers Beach to Clearwater was discontinued at 1000 UTC on June 19. It is likely that the hurricane warning was discontinued after the National Hurricane Center downgraded Agnes to a tropical storm at 2200 UTC on June 20. Two hours later, all gale warnings along the West Coast of Florida were discontinued.

==Impact==
===United States===

In the United States, Agnes affected 15 states and the District of Columbia. Almost 110,000 houses were ruined by Agnes, 3,351 of which were destroyed. In addition, 5,211 mobile homes were either damaged or completely destroyed. Farm buildings and small businesses also suffered extensively, with 2,226 and 5,842 structures experiencing major losses or were destroyed. Of the 128 storm-related fatalities, 119 occurred in the United States. Agnes was, at the time, the costliest hurricane on record in U.S. history; losses far exceeded the combined losses from Hurricane Betsy (1965) and Hurricane Camille (1969).

====Florida====
Upon landfall, Agnes produced abnormally high tides along much of the Florida coastline. The highest tides reported were at Cedar Key, reaching above normal sea levels. The second largest waves were , recorded at Apalachicola. In contrast, few observations of high tides along the east coast of Florida exist; the highest reported was above average in Jacksonville. In Alligator Point, at least 16 homes were swept off their foundations. Six bridges connecting Cedar Key to the mainland areas of Florida were submerged. In addition, a bridge from Coquina Key to St. Petersburg was also underwater due to high tides. Tampa Bay had an unusually high tide flooding the low lying Shore Acres neighborhood in St. Petersburg. Nearly the entire state of Florida reported rainfall, though it was usually in the light to moderate range. Among the highest amounts of precipitation recorded were in Naples, in Big Pine Key, in the Everglades, and in Tallahassee. Near Okeechobee, larger amounts of rainfall may have occurred, though there were no specific observations in that vicinity.
Though Agnes made landfall as a hurricane, no reports of hurricane-force winds exist. However, several locations observed tropical storm force winds. The highest sustained winds and gusts were , both recorded at the Kennedy Space Center. Other reports of at least tropical storm force sustained winds were at in Crestview and Jacksonville, in Flamingo, in Key West, and two observations of in Panama City. Throughout the state, Agnes spawned at least 15 tornadoes, while several tornadoes were operationally unconfirmed. Initially referred to as a &quot;windstorm&quot;, one of those twisters destroyed 50 mobile homes and a fishing camp in Okeechobee, as well as caused six fatalities. Another significant tornado occurred in Cape Canaveral, which destroyed two homes and 30 trailers; it also damaged 20 houses and the Port Canaveral Coast Guard station. Overall, more than 100 people were left homeless and caused 23 injuries and over $500,000 in damage. The costliest tornado was also spawned in Brevard County and it destroyed 44 planes at the Merritt Island Airport and an apartment building. In addition, several houses in a nearby subdivision were also damaged. Losses from this tornado are estimated at $3 million.

Due to a combination of high tides, rainfall, winds, and tornadoes, 96 dwellings were destroyed, while about 1,802 suffered damage to some degree. The destruction of 177 mobile homes was reported and 374 others were significantly damaged. Furthermore, 988 small businesses in the state were either destroyed or had major damage. Eight counties in Florida reported at least $1 million in damage, including $12.1 million in Pinellas, $7.1 million in Sarasota, $4.1 million in Brevard, $3.1 million in Pasco, $2 million in Manatee, $1.4 million in Wakulla and Franklin, $1.3 million in Monroe, and $1 million in losses in Hillsborough Counties. Although the damage toll estimated by the National Hurricane Center was at $8.243 million, the National Climatic Data Center noted that at least $39 million in losses were reported. In addition, nine fatalities were reported in Florida.

====Southeastern United States====

In the states immediately to the north of Florida, impact was relatively minor. Rainfall was generally light in Georgia, though peaking at in Brunswick. Other locations that reported precipitations include in Albany, in Savannah, and in Macon. During the tornado outbreak, two of the tornadoes were spawned in Georgia. The tornado in Pierce County caused $25,000 in damage and one injury. Losses were more significant from the twister in Coffee County, reaching $250,000. One mobile home in Georgia suffered significant damage, though it is unknown if this was related to the tornadoes. Though the damage from both tornadoes combined was about $275,000, the National Hurricane Center notes only $205,000 in losses.

In Alabama, tides up to above normal were reported in the Mobile Bay area. Though rainfall only reached and in Dothan and Mobile, precipitation from the storm in the state of Alabama peaked at in Headland. Damage in the state was minor, though low-lying streets in the Gulf Shores were flooded.

In some areas of South Carolina, the storm dropped as much as of rain in less than 36 hours. As a result, several rivers flooded. Along the Pee Dee River, pastures, small grains, and soy bean crops near Cheraw suffered major damage; similar effects occurred along the Congaree River near Columbia, though damage was lesser. In Greenville, damage to basements, streets, and water systems occurred after the Reedy River overflowed. Damage in South Carolina was minor, totaling to only $50,000.

Effects were very minimal in Tennessee and limited to light rainfall in the eastern portions of the state, generally reaching no more than . The highest amount of precipitation recorded was in Unicoi.

====Virginia====

In Richmond, four people drowned after their car plunged into the swollen James River. A train bound for Washington D.C. stopped due to flooding in Richmond, which temporarily stranded 537 passengers. The Peak Creek in western Virginia overflowed its banks, flooding a low-income housing area of Pulaski with water up to rooftops. At the height of the flooding, over of highways were submerged, resulting in $14.8 million in damage to roads in the state. Severe damage also occurred to sewer and water facilities, totaling to $34.5 million. 95 houses were destroyed and 4,393 others were damaged, while 125 mobile homes were destroyed and another 450 were significantly affected. Additionally, 205 small businesses were either damaged or destroyed. The Interstate 95 (I-95) Purple Heart Bridge over northern Virginia&#x27;s Occoquan River was severely damaged and closed when rammed by a large barge carried by floodwaters. In the Washington DC suburbs, the Alexandria reservoir Lake Barcroft emptied when its dam was undermined and breached.

Overall, flooding was described as &quot;the worst in 50 years&quot;. In Virginia alone, 13 fatalities and $125.9 million in losses were reported.

====Maryland====
In Baltimore, a woman&#x27;s car was swept off a highway; firemen in rowboats were able to rescue her, but her three children drowned. In the state of Maryland, damage totaled to $110 million and 19 fatalities were reported.

The hardest hit area was the Patapsco River valley, with widespread destruction of buildings, roads, and railroads in the state park, at Daniels including its mill, at Ellicott City, and Oella. The flooding was first reported in the early morning hours of June 22 and water was reported as high as above normal. River Road along the Patapsco was almost completely washed out. More than 900 people were evacuated from their homes. National guard helicopters were used to rescue workmen from the roof of the Daniels&#x27; plant. In Elkridge, a family of six was forced from their home and they attempted to reach high ground in a small boat. It capsized and all six held onto the boat for several hours until it reached more shallow water.

In Howard County, a total of 704 county residents were left homeless. More than 80 homes in the Ellicott City area were damaged and 72 homes in Elkridge were affected. In Laurel, the 9th Street Bridge crossing the Patuxent River was washed away by flood waters. In Anne Arundel County, all roads linking the county with Baltimore city or county were closed (including the Baltimore Beltway) as were all roads &quot;near the Patuxent River&quot; including Waysons Corner where over 300 homes were evacuated. The Patapsco flooded residential homes in parts of the county&#x27;s North Linthicum, Pumphrey, and Belle Grove Road, Brooklyn Park neighborhoods.

The Gwynn Oak Amusement Park closed after suffering severe damage from flooding when Hurricane Agnes caused Gwynns Falls to overflow. In 1974, the park&#x27;s rides were auctioned off. The carousel was moved and is still in operation on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.

A popular footbridge in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park which led across a branch of the Potomac River to an overlook of Great Falls was washed away and not rebuilt until 1996.

As a result of Agnes&#x27; rains, Conowingo Dam, astride the Susquehanna River just north of the Chesapeake Bay, recorded its all-time highest flow rate and stream heights. Before the river crested, the water came within feet of overtopping the dam. As the dam&#x27;s normal flood control devices seemed unable to cope, engineers had placed charges to blow out a section of the dam to prevent a catastrophic failure. The towns along the Susquehanna below the canal, Port Deposit, Perryville, and Havre de Grace, were flooded as torrents of water rushed through streets. Late on June 23, a mandatory evacuation of Port Deposit&#x27;s nearly 1,000 residents was ordered as the river continued to rise, causing the fire department to bring evacuees out by boat during an eight-hour period as over four-feet of water filled Main Street.

====Pennsylvania====
In Pennsylvania, heavy rainfall was reported, with much of the state experiencing more than of precipitation. Furthermore, a large swath of rainfall exceeding was reported in the central part of the state. Overall, the rains peaked at in the western portions of Schuylkill County. As a result, Agnes is listed as the wettest tropical cyclone on record for the state of Pennsylvania. Overall, more than 100,000 people were forced to leave their homes due to flooding. The Allegheny River reached above flood stage at several low-lying locations and at some places rose about per hour during the height of the storm. Additionally, the Susquehanna River threatened to reach record crests along its course. Some buildings were under of water in Harrisburg. At the Governor&#x27;s Mansion, the first floor was submerged by flood waters. Governor Milton Shapp and his wife Muriel had to be evacuated by boat due to flooding. More than one hundred Harrisburg YMCA campers and staff were evacuated using two CH-47 Chinook helicopters flown by the National Guard at Camp Shikellimy located downstream of DeHart Dam in Middle Paxton Township.

Hundreds were trapped in their homes in Wilkes-Barre due to the overflowing Susquehanna River. At the historic cemetery in Forty Fort, 2,000 caskets were washed away, leaving body parts on porches, roofs, and in basements. In Luzerne County alone, 25,000 homes and businesses were either damaged or destroyed. Losses in that county totaled to $1 billion. A bridge collapsed in Danville, which caused two Penn Central diesel locomotives and several freight cars to fall into a swollen creek.

In Reading, the Schuylkill River reached a record flood of . Hundreds of people were evacuated and over a hundred homes destroyed. Floods reached as far inland as 3rd street in the heart of the city. In Chadds Ford Township in Delaware County, the Brandywine Creek crested at , sending flood waters into the city. Water poured into the first floor of the Brandywine River Museum of Art in Chadds Ford Township, which threatened at least $2.5 million in N.C. Wyeth paintings, though they were quickly moved to the upper floors. Additionally, 36 Girl Scouts were rescued by state police while at a camp in York.

Throughout the state of Pennsylvania, Agnes demolished more than 3,000 businesses and 68,000 homes, while damaging numerous others. Consequently, at least 220,000 people were left homeless. The damage and death toll was the highest in Pennsylvania, with 50 fatalities and $2.3 billion in losses in that state alone, including more than $1 billion in damage to businesses, $500 million to roadways, $120 million to crops, and around $40 million to school districts. Approximately 150 bridges either became impassable or were swept away. Following Agnes, three news correspondents and the pilot died in a helicopter crash in Harrisburg on June 26, 1972, while reporting on the flooding. The victims were Del Vaughn of CBS News and Sid Brenner and Louis Clark of WCAU in Philadelphia, and the pilot, Mike Sedio. The helicopter lost its rotor some above the Capital City Airport, crashed, and exploded on the runway.

====Upstate New York====

Olean, Elmira, and Corning, as well as many other Southern Tier towns, were severely flooded. Sections of the Erie Lackawanna Railroad main line between Hornell and Binghamton were severely damaged. It is mainly regarded as the death of the Erie Lackawanna Railroad since the costs of damages were high and put the final dagger into the company. Flooding in the upper Allegheny River basin was particularly exacerbated by the construction of the Kinzua Dam less than a decade prior; several towns in Cattaraugus County suffered extensive road and bridge damage that, four decades later, had yet to be repaired, with the state and local governments opting to abandon creek and river crossings instead of reconstruct them. The dam succeeded in preventing further damage downstream in western Pennsylvania, and much of the flood-prone areas in the Allegheny Reservoir region had already been cleared of residents in preparation for the dam&#x27;s construction.

In Elmira, porches and garages were ripped loose, the Walnut St. bridge was carried away, Maple Ave. to Notre Dame High School was &quot;underwater&quot;, and on S. Main St., Gerould&#x27;s Pharmacy at W. Hudson was engulfed by of water.

Hornell&#x27;s damage was minimal largely due to the protection of two dam systems installed after the devastating 1935 flood. Both the Arkport and Almond Dams saved Hornell from the level of damage found in neighboring communities. Three US Army Corps of Engineers were killed in Hornell when their helicopter came in contact with power lines over Crosby Creek.
The height of the floodwaters has been marked in the entrance to the Corning Museum of Glass, showing that much of the museum was under water to a height of about above the floor, causing substantial damage to the collection and archives. Parts of Corning were under more than of flood waters.
====West Virginia and Ohio====
Rainfall in West Virginia was generally light, though heavier in the Eastern and Northern Panhandles of the state. Precipitation peaked at in Berkeley Springs. 108 houses were destroyed and 1,558 others suffered damage. Furthermore, 118 mobile homes were destroyed and 91 were significantly affected. 10 farm buildings reported major losses, while 18 small businesses were either damaged or destroyed. In the state of West Virginia, no fatalities were reported and damage was slightly more than $7.7 million.

Although no reports of abnormally high winds or rainfall exists in Ohio, the storm caused minor damage to about 302 dwellings and severely affected at least three houses. In addition, at least 100 mobile homes suffered major damage. Northeasterly winds from the storm waves reaching a height of along the shore of Lake Erie and also caused the water level to rise by . Houses, cars, boats, buildings, ships, and docks in the vicinity of Lake Erie were damaged. Overall, losses in Ohio totaled to at least $4 million.

====Elsewhere in the United States====
While approaching Delaware, Agnes produced tides about above normal at the Indian River Inlet. High winds were also reported in the state, and at the Dover Air Force Base, a wind gust as high as was reported. Rainfall was generally light, peaking at in Middletown. Street flooding was reported and basements in low-lying area were flooded, though damage in Delaware was minimal. One fatality occurred in that state. In the Washington, D.C. area, moderate rainfall was reported, with precipitation amounts peaking at at the Washington Dulles International Airport. Significant flooding occurred and it was described as the worst in at least 44 years. In the Georgetown section, waterfront streets along the Potomac River were submerged in as much as of water. The Rock Creek also overflowed its banks, which sent about of water onto the Rock Creek Parkway. As a result, at least 100 cars were abandoned and several motorists required rescuing by police. No national monuments were affected by flood waters. However, about 350 dwellings in Washington, D.C. suffered minor damage. At the White House, reporters noted wet carpets in the press room of the basement floor.

In Connecticut, winds were well below tropical storm force, although a wind gust of was reported in Hartford. Rainfall in the state was light, peaking at , also recorded in Hartford. Along the coast of Connecticut, high tides and heavy rainfall flooded coastal roads and basements. High tides occurred along the coastline of Rhode Island, reaching above normal in Providence. In combination with rainfall and high tides, some coastal roads were flooded. Strong winds felled trees and numerous limbs in Massachusetts, causing power outages and property damage in the western and central portions of the state. One home in Great Barrington was struck by a tree; a similar incident occurred in Milford. High winds in southern and eastern Vermont knocked over trees and snapped off limbs, which resulted in scattered power outages, roads being blocked, and minor property damage. In Mendon, a tree fell on a house, while two cars were damaged after being struck by limbs. Similar conditions occurred in New Hampshire, albeit effects were lesser.

===Elsewhere===
As a precaution, more than 8,000 people in western Cuba, including on Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Pines), were evacuated. In western Cuba, Agnes dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at on Isla de la Juventud. At Cape San Antonio, the westernmost point in Cuba, precipitation reached . Due to high winds and flooding, at least 97 houses were destroyed and another 270 were damaged. In the Pinar del Río Province, the cities of Guane and Mantua were isolated by swollen rivers. It was also reported that extensive crop damage occurred in low-lying areas. Overall, seven fatalities occurred in Cuba, though the damage toll is unknown. However, some sources claim Agnes caused 16 fatalities and reported 24 people injured.

In Canada, Hurricane Agnes gave heavy rains and winds over southern Ontario and southern Quebec, causing numerous floodings around Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. In the town of Maniwaki, Quebec, the storm toppled a mobile home, killing two people.

==Aftermath==

Following the storm, President Richard Nixon declared 14 counties in Florida as a disaster area, including: Brevard County, Dixie County, Franklin County, Hendry County, Hillsborough County, Lee County, Levy County, Manatee County, Monroe County, Okeechobee County, Pasco County, Pinellas County, Sarasota County, and Wakulla County. In Panama City, Florida, where over 25,000 tourists evacuated, effects were not significant. As a result, the city lost millions of dollars from tourism, which led the officials of Panama City to file a $100 million lawsuit against the National Weather Service. Officials in that city believed that the National Weather Service and other media outlets made &quot;exaggerated and erroneous&quot; forecasts and reports on the storm. Nixon also declared the states of Florida, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York as disaster areas. Twenty of Maryland&#x27;s 24 counties were declared a disaster area.

Agnes had a devastating impact on the already-bankrupt railroads in the northeastern United States, as lines were washed out and shipments were delayed: 
*The Erie Lackawanna Railway (EL) estimated that damage between Binghamton and Salamanca, New York, amounted to $2 million. EL filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 
*The Penn Central Railroad sustained nearly $20 million in damages

The resulting cost of repairing the damage was one of the factors leading to the creation of the federally financed Conrail. Some Americans sardonically referred to the storm as &quot;Hurricane Agony&quot;.

The severe floods near Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania, were the catalyst for the construction of the Tioga Reservoir in 1973. The flooding in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and the adjacent town of Kingston led to the construction of a levee system that in 2006 successfully prevented massive flooding and, in the same year, was deemed very safe and protective by the Army Corps of Engineers. The levee also protected the area from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee and Hurricane Irene in 2011, with the water cresting just barely below the height of the structure. Conversely, the existing Kinzua Dam, built against the wishes of the Seneca Nation of New York, spared much of Western Pennsylvania from the worst flooding, by filling the Allegheny Reservoir to capacity.

Footage is included in the 1987 film &quot;Disasters-Anatomy of Destruction&quot;, hosted by George Kennedy.

===Retirement===

On account of the extensive damage and high death toll, the name &quot;Agnes&quot; was retired after the 1972 season. The name will never again be used for an Atlantic basin tropical cyclone.

<text>Cecil Harland Underwood (November 5, 1922 – November 24, 2008) was an American politician who served as the 25th and 32nd governor of West Virginia from 1957 to 1961, and again from 1997 to 2001. A member of the Republican Party, he was the youngest governor in the state&#x27;s history when first elected in 1956 at age 34 and later became the oldest when re-elected in 1996 at age 74. His career spanned more than five decades, including multiple gubernatorial bids, legislative service, and roles in academia and business. Underwood was known for his work in civil rights, economic development, and tax reform.

== Early life and education ==
Underwood was born in Josephs Mills, West Virginia, to Della N. (née Forrester) and Silas Henry Underwood. Growing up during the Great Depression, he worked on farms to support his family.[6]

He graduated from Tyler Consolidated High School in 1939 and later enrolled at Salem University in Harrison County, where he was student body president and a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1943.

During World War II, he served as an Army Reservist before returning to teach high school biology in St. Marys, West Virginia (1943–1946). He later pursued a master&#x27;s degree from West Virginia University, which he completed in 1965.

== Early political career ==
At just 22 years old, Underwood launched his political career by winning a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1944. He served six consecutive terms (1944–1956) and became House Minority Leader in 1949, 1951, 1953, and 1955.

In addition to his political work, he was a college professor and administrator, teaching at Marietta College (1946–1950) and later serving as vice president of Salem College (1950–1956).

== First term as governor (1957–1961) ==
Underwood&#x27;s 1956 election as Governor of West Virginia marked the first election of a Republican to the office since 1928. He had defeated Charleston Mayor John T. Copenhaver by only 7,200 votes in the primary, and enjoyed a decisive victory against Democratic U.S. Representative Robert Mollohan in the general election by 63,000 votes. Only a week prior to the election, it was discovered that Mollohan had received $20,000 and two cars from a coal operator on a strip mine at a male reformatory in Pruntytown while Mollohan was superintendent of the institution. Underwood had turned 34 years old only one day before the election, making him one of the youngest U.S. governors to have ever been elected.

Following the lead of Governor William C. Marland, the Democrat who preceded him in office, Underwood continued the desegregation of West Virginia schools without violent confrontation at all levels and was a supporter of civil rights legislation.

The previous governors since 1932 had all been Democrats. His first act as governor was to go on the new medium of television and inform every state employee that they were fired. He stated that this was the only way to destroy the corrupt &quot;machine&quot; system. He later advocated an organized civil service and retirement pension system, and provided temporary employment relief for low-income families.

Underwood was instrumental in the creation of the West Virginia Mental Health Department, and oversaw creation of the interstate highway in the state, He oversaw the last three executions in the state, all in 1959.

== Between governorships (1961–1996) ==
Because West Virginia&#x27;s constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms at that time, Underwood ran for the United States Senate in 1960, but was defeated by incumbent Democrat Jennings Randolph. He was nominated again for governor in 1964 but was defeated by Hulett C. Smith, and then lost the Republican primary for governor to Arch A. Moore Jr. in 1968. He was nominated again for governor in 1976, losing to Democrat Jay Rockefeller by 250,000 votes, which would become his largest defeat.

During the 1960s, he was named temporary chairman of the Republican National Convention and was once considered for the office of Vice President under Richard Nixon. Two weeks after losing the Senate race in 1960, Underwood went to work for the Island Creek Coal Company and Monsanto Chemical Company as well as forming his own land development company.

He was associated as well with the Software Valley Corporation in Morgantown, West Virginia. He continued his academic career by serving as President of Bethany College and instructor of political science at Marshall University. He also served as president of the National Association of State Councils on Vocational Education.

== Second term as governor (1997–2001) ==

Underwood was elected again to the office of Governor of West Virginia in 1996 under the banner &quot;Better Government, not Bigger Government&quot;, carrying 38 of the state&#x27;s 55 counties and defeating astronaut Jon McBride and future congressman David McKinley.

During his governorship, he enabled the &quot;Governor&#x27;s Commission of Fair Taxation&quot;, which was a thorough review of the state&#x27;s tax structure. The Commission made numerous recommendations for improvement. He streamlined administrative costs from education and other government sectors.

In October 1999, Underwood was selected by the governors of the Appalachian states to serve as West Virginia&#x27;s co-chairman for the Appalachian Regional Commission for 2000.

Underwood was the only sitting Republican governor defeated for re-election in 2000, narrowly losing to Democrat Bob Wise.

== Later Years and Death ==
After leaving office, Underwood largely withdrew from public life. His wife, Hovah, died in 2004 from complications of a stroke.

In March 2006, he suffered a minor stroke, followed by a major stroke in 2008, which left him unable to speak. He developed a severe blood infection later that year and was admitted to a nursing facility before returning home to Charleston.

On November 23, 2008, he was hospitalized with chest congestion and minor brain bleeding. He died the next day at Charleston Area Medical Center at age 86. His body was donated to Marshall University&#x27;s Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine.

== Personal Life ==
Underwood married Hovah Hall on July 25, 1948, at Knotts Methodist Church in Grantsville, West Virginia. The couple met while attending Salem College, where Hovah&#x27;s sisters were Underwood’s classmates.

They had one son, two daughters, and six grandchildren.

Underwood was a lifelong Methodist.

<text>Arch Alfred Moore Jr. (April 16, 1923 – January 7, 2015) was an American lawyer and Republican politician who served as the 28th and 30th governor of West Virginia. He held office from 1969 to 1977 and again from 1985 to 1989, making him the longest-serving governor in the state&#x27;s history with 12 years in office. Moore began his political career as a state legislator in 1952 and later became a prominent figure in West Virginia politics. He was the father of U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito and the grandfather of U.S. Representative Riley Moore.

Moore&#x27;s tenure was marked by significant infrastructure development and economic initiatives, but his political career ended in controversy. Amid allegations of corruption, he lost his 1988 reelection bid to Democrat Gaston Caperton. In 1990, he pleaded guilty to five felony charges, leading to a sentence of five years and ten months in federal prison, of which he served over three years. His conviction resulted in disbarment, the forfeiture of his state pension, and a $750,000 settlement paid to the state in 1995.

==Early life==
Moore was born in Moundsville, West Virginia, in the state&#x27;s industrial northern panhandle, the son of Genevieve (née Jones) and Archie Alfred Moore. He was born into a political family. His grandfather, Forest Taylor Moore (1859–1950), was a ten-term delegate and minority leader in the West Virginia House of Delegates and his uncle, Everett Franklin Moore (1885–1965), was also a politician. Moore excelled at basketball while attending Moundsville High School. Upon graduation, he worked in a factory and on an oil pipeline.

He briefly attended Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, before he was drafted for World War II service. He was in the Army Specialized Training Program training to be an engineer, but military manpower requirements changed and he was sent to the infantry. Assigned to the 334th Infantry Regiment, a unit of the 84th Infantry Division, he received a disfiguring wound in the jaw from enemy machine gun fire in Germany, November 1944. Moore was left for dead for two days in a German farmer&#x27;s beet field after 33 of the 36 members of his platoon died in battle. Following his wounding, he was transferred to Liege, Belgium, where he underwent facial reconstruction surgery. Because the bullet that had wounded him passed through his tongue, he was not able to speak for about a year after his wounding. Public speaking, a skill he would later exercise while holding public office, was part of his physical therapy. He would give &quot;lectures&quot; to troops on their way to the front lines. Sergeant Moore was decorated with the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, Combat Infantryman&#x27;s Badge and European Theater of Operations Ribbon with three battle stars.

He then entered West Virginia University graduating in 1948 and then from its law school in 1951. While at WVU, he was involved with student government and founded &quot;Mountaineer Week,&quot; a celebration of West Virginia culture in response to his perception that the growing number of out-of-state students at the school were changing its character. The event has become a permanent part of the school&#x27;s calendar. He was also a member of the Beta Psi chapter of Beta Theta Pi at West Virginia University and was a recipient of the fraternity&#x27;s Oxford Cup.

After graduating from law school, Moore returned to Moundsville to practice law with his uncle, Everett Moore.

==Congressional career, 1957–1969==
Moore was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1952. In 1954, Moore made his first run for the US Congress, challenging incumbent Democratic Congressman Bob Mollohan, but lost. In 1956, Moore was elected to the seat following Mollohan having vacated it to run for Governor of West Virginia, a race Mollohan eventually lost to Republican Cecil Underwood. In 1962, his district was merged with the 3rd District of longtime Democratic incumbent Cleveland M. Bailey; Moore won by just 762 votes. Moore was re-elected in 1964 and 1966, before seeking the governor&#x27;s office in 1968. He served a total of six terms in Congress, from 1957 through 1969.

His terms in the House were marked by strong support for public works projects and for civil rights. Moore voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Moore became the ranking Republican on the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Nationality in 1960.

==Governor of West Virginia, 1969–1977==
Moore was elected to his first term as governor in 1968, defeating Cecil H. Underwood in the Republican primary and Democrat James Marshall Sprouse in the general election. Just two days before the general election, on November 3, 1968, Moore was in a helicopter crash in Lincoln County. He and West Virginia Supreme Court candidate Dennis Knapp were on their way to the town of Hamlin to campaign when their pilot crash-landed the helicopter on the Hamlin High School football field in an attempt to avoid power lines. Moore sustained a ruptured leg muscle and two broken ribs in the crash, while Knapp suffered a broken collar bone. After winning the election, Moore told reporters he thought &quot;the Lord voted for me&quot; via the crash.

The state&#x27;s Constitution, which had formerly had a one-term term limit and provided for a weak governor system, was amended in 1968 to strengthen the powers of the governor and in 1970 to provide for a two-term limit. Moore became the first person re-elected governor in 1972, defeating Jay Rockefeller.

A notable event of Moore&#x27;s first term was the 1969 strike of the state&#x27;s highway workers. From March 3–11, over 2,600 of these workers struck in an attempt to get the state to recognize their union. Moore summarily fired those who had walked off the job, later citing this act as a matter of state safety. 530 of the highway workers who went on strike were able to reclaim their jobs after the strike was over, but more than 2,000 of them were permanently dismissed. Moore&#x27;s stance during this strike was markedly different from actions on labor that he took later in his Governorship. He would go on to advocate for insurance benefits of hospital workers and pay increases for teachers and other school staff. Furthermore, he pressured the West Virginia legislature to increase workers compensation benefits by 75% and helped to settle a national strike of coal miners.

Moore&#x27;s first two terms as governor are best remembered for improvements in the state&#x27;s highway system and for the Buffalo Creek Flood disaster. During Moore&#x27;s first two terms as governor, West Virginia built over of interstate highways through mountainous terrain and the New River Gorge Bridge, once the world&#x27;s longest steel arch bridge. This building was made possible by The Roads Development Amendment (1968), a $350 million bond amendment that gave the State of West Virginia the ability to match Federal highway funding to the state, as well as the Better Roads Amendment (1964), a $200 million bond issue. By the end of Moore&#x27;s tenure as governor, all of I-79, I-64, I-68, and the West Virginia Turnpike (I-77) were completed.

Moore was actively involved in the National Governors Association during his tenure as Governor of West Virginia. He was chair of this organization from 1971 to 1972.

===Corruption charges and trial===
In 1975 Moore and his 1972 campaign manager were accused by federal prosecutors of extorting $25,000 from the president of a holding company seeking a state charter for a new bank. Both were acquitted in 1976.

===Buffalo Creek settlement===
In the last week of his second term in 1977, Moore accepted a $1 million payment from Pittston Coal Company to settle accounts from the Buffalo Creek Disaster. The state had initially sued for $100 million, half of which was slated to cover cleanup and restoration expenses. The reduced settlement accepted by Moore did not come close to covering the $9.5 million cleanup costs expended by the federal government; in 1988, these costs were reimbursed by the State of West Virginia. The government had been warned as early as the late 1960s of the instability of the Buffalo Creek gob dams, yet the state failed to take measures to prevent the accident from occurring.

Moore is also remembered for several other incidents stemming from the Buffalo Creek Disaster. After the flood, the governor attempted to use disaster relief funds to build a limited access superhighway through the hollow to connect Logan County with Raleigh County. Several hundred properties were purchased via eminent domain by the state for the right-of-way and a two lane road was reconstructed back up the hollow. The highway, however, failed to materialize. Subsequently, in many cases, the state refused to sell the former owners back their land.

Moore had also made a promise to residents of Buffalo Creek Hollow to construct a community center as part of the rebuilding effort. However, in the end, the center promised by Moore and the State of West Virginia was never built. Arnold &amp; Porter, a Washington, D.C. law firm, handled a lawsuit filed by approximately 600 survivors, which resulted in a settlement of $13.5 million, or roughly $13,000.00 per person after legal fees. Arnold &amp; Porter took a portion of the legal fees paid to them and had the community center constructed in the hollow at their expense.

In a 2007 interview with West Virginia Public Broadcasting, Moore claimed that he had nothing to do with the state&#x27;s lawsuit against the Pittston Coal Company. Rather, it was the state&#x27;s attorney general, Chauncey H. Browning Jr. who handled the suit under the direction of laws passed by the state legislature. In Moore&#x27;s words, he was blamed by unfair newspaper reports for the inequitable settlement because his signature appeared on its final documents. Moore claims that the lawyers from the Pittston Coal Company insisted that he sign these documents, though he had nothing to do with their contents.

==U.S. Senate race, 1978==
In 1976 Moore was legally barred from seeking a third term and declined to challenge incumbent Robert C. Byrd for a seat in the United States Senate. Instead, he began a two-year campaign for the state&#x27;s other Senate seat, which was expected to be vacated by the aging Jennings Randolph in 1978. To the surprise of almost all observers, the obviously declining Randolph stood for re-election. His campaign was entirely financed by then-governor Jay Rockefeller, as Randolph&#x27;s six-year term as Senator and a theoretical second Rockefeller term as governor would both expire in 1984, permitting Rockefeller to run for an open seat. Moore was outspent by 5 to 1 in this election, and lost by 4,717 votes.

==Third term as Governor of West Virginia, 1985–1989==
In 1980 Moore sought his third term as Governor. He faced Rockefeller in a rematch of the 1972 election. Rockefeller outspent him by a figure of 20 to 1, and easily defeated Moore 54%-45%.

In 1984 Moore once again ran for governor when Rockefeller made a successful bid for the U.S. Senate. He defeated State House Speaker Clyde See to become the only West Virginia governor to be elected to three terms in office. He again turned his attention to highways, and saw the completion in 1988 of the last major section of interstate highway in the country, which had been left unbuilt during the Rockefeller terms. He was soundly defeated for reelection in 1988 by Gaston Caperton.

==Federal conviction==
In 1990, after an extensive federal investigation, Moore pleaded guilty to five felonies, including mail fraud, tax fraud, extortion, and obstruction of justice. He agreed to plead guilty after he was told that federal investigators had taped him conspiring with his former campaign manager, John Leaberry, to obstruct the investigation into his activities. Moore pleaded guilty to an indictment that said he accepted illegal payments from lobbyists during his 1984 and 1988 election campaigns, which he failed to report on his Federal income tax returns for 1984 and 1985. Furthermore, he also plead guilty to extorting more than $573,000 from Maben Energy Corporation, a coal company based in the town of Beckley, and obstructed the investigation of this activity. Moore had helped Maben receive a refund of $2 million from the state&#x27;s Black Lung Fund, an aid program for miners with the disease, in exchange for roughly 25% of this sum.

For these crimes, Moore was fined $3.2 million, though he paid only $750,000, after reaching a settlement. He was sentenced to five years and ten months in prison. Of this sentence, Moore served two years and eight months in federal prison in Alabama and Kentucky and four months of home confinement at his home in Glen Dale, Marshall County.

After his guilty plea, Moore tried repeatedly to withdraw it. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rebuffed his attempts to withdraw his plea in April 1991, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused his arguments in October 1995. For the remainder of his life, Moore continued to maintain his innocence. He later claimed that he made the plea based on bad advice. In an interview with West Virginia Public Broadcasting he said: &quot;I followed advice that I got, that advice was not the right advice.&quot;

As a result of his conviction, Moore was disbarred. In the last decades of his life he tried vehemently to get his law license reinstated. When asked why he wanted to be reinstated, Moore cited his childhood desire to become a lawyer. &quot;It&#x27;s something I always was and something I always wanted to be,&quot; he said in a 2007 interview. He was unsuccessful.

==Personal life==
Moore married Shelley Riley in 1949. The two had met while students at WVU. They have three children. His daughter Shelley Moore Capito is the current junior United States senator from West Virginia. Moore&#x27;s grandsons, Moore Capito and Riley Moore, are also politicians.

Moore died in Charleston on January 7, 2015, at the age of 91, one day after his daughter, Shelley Moore Capito, was sworn in to the United States Senate. When asked about his legacy, he said he was proud of his three terms as governor. &quot;You&#x27;ll run into Arch Moore stories for the rest of your life, and nine and a half out of ten will be positive,&quot; he told West Virginia Public Broadcasting in 2007. &quot;I&#x27;m still working on the other half.&quot;

In 2006 former West Virginia Tax Commissioner Brad Crouser, who served during Governor Moore&#x27;s third term, published the first biography of Moore, &quot;Arch: The Life of Governor Arch A. Moore Jr.&quot;

Moore&#x27;s political papers are housed at the West Virginia and Regional History Center at West Virginia University. This collection contains documents from his time as a Congressman and governor.

<doc id="420114" wikidata="Q1967566" url="?curid=420114" title="Trevor Joyce">
<text>Trevor Joyce (born 26 October 1947) is an Irish poet, born in Dublin.

He co-founded New Writers&#x27; Press (NWP) in Dublin in 1967 and was a founding editor of NWP&#x27;s &quot;The Lace Curtain; A Magazine of Poetry and Criticism&quot; in 1968.

Joyce was the Judith E. Wilson Visiting Poetry Fellow at the University of Cambridge in 2009/10 and he had residencies at Cill Rialaig, County Kerry, and at the University of Galway. He is also co-founder and director of the annual SoundEye Festival that is held in Cork City.

==Biography==
Born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1947, Joyce was brought up between Mary Street, in the city centre, and the Galway Gaeltacht. Galway is the ancestral home of both his mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s families, and Patrick Weston Joyce, historian, writer and collector of Irish music, and Robert Dwyer Joyce, poet, writer and fellow collector of music, are numbered among his great-granduncles. Recent poems such as &quot;Trem Neul&quot; see Joyce appropriate elements of the folk music gathered by Patrick Weston Joyce and engage ideas of lineage and transmission.

In Dublin and Oxford, in the early eighties, he conducted seminars and lectured on classical Chinese poetry. Having studied Philosophy and English at University College Dublin, he moved in 1984 to Cork, where he read Mathematical Sciences at University College Cork and he now resides in the city.

==Works==
Early books include &quot;Sole Glum Trek&quot; (1967), &quot;Watches&quot; (1969), &quot;Pentahedron&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Poems of Sweeny Peregrine: A Working of the Corrupt Irish Text&quot; (1976). The last of these is a version of the Middle-Irish &quot;Buile Shuibhne&quot;, well known from Seamus Heaney&#x27;s later translation in &quot;Sweeney Astray&quot; (1983).

After a near-total silence for 20 years, Joyce resumed publishing in 1995 with &quot;stone floods&quot;, followed by &quot;Syzygy&quot; and &quot;Without Asylum&quot; (1998). In 2001, &quot;with the first dream of fire they hunt the cold&quot; was published, which gathered all of the poet&#x27;s major work from 1966 to 2000. In 2007, &quot;What&#x27;s in Store: Poems 2000–2007&quot; appeared, and in 2009 he published &quot;Courts of Air and Earth&quot;. His work appears in many anthologies, including Keith Tuma&#x27;s &quot;Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry&quot; and Patrick Crotty&#x27;s &quot;The Penguin Book of Irish Poetry&quot;.

Joyce&#x27;s poetry employs a wide range of forms and techniques, ranging from traditional to modern experimentalism. He has published notable versions from Chinese and from middle-Irish, which he refers to as &quot;workings&quot; rather than &quot;translations&quot; to emphasise that they are poetic reimaginings in the tradition of Ezra Pound rather than &quot;straight&quot; translations.

A collection of poems up to 2000, including his &quot;workings&quot; from the Irish and Chinese, was published as &quot;with the first dream of fire they hunt the cold&quot; (2001). He has also experimented with web-based poetry projects such as the collaborative project &quot;OffSets&quot;. A collection of his post-&quot;with the first dream&quot; work, &quot;What&#x27;s in Store&quot;, was published in 2007. A separate collection of new and old translations from the Irish, entitled &quot;Courts of Air and Earth&quot;, was issued by Shearsman in 2009 and was shortlisted for the Corneliu M. Popescu Prize for European Poetry in Translation 2009.

He has also published several papers on contemporary poetics, and has lectured and given public readings of his work throughout Ireland, the UK and the USA.

==Awards==
Awarded a Literary Bursary by the Irish Arts Council (2001), Joyce was a Fulbright Scholar for the year 2002–03. In 2004 he was elected a member of Aosdána, the Irish Affiliation of Artists, and was the first writer to be awarded a fellowship by the Ballinglen Arts Foundation. He held the Judith E Wilson Fellowship for poetry to the University of Cambridge for 2009/10. In 2017 he was named by previous winner, the English poet Tom Raworth, as the latest recipient of the biennial N. C. Kaser prize for poetry.

<text>From November 1978 to December 1979, thousands of people put up &quot;big character posters&quot; on a long brick wall of Xidan Street, Xicheng District of Beijing, to protest about the political and social issues of China; the wall became known as the Democracy Wall of Xidan (). Under acquiescence of the Chinese government, other kinds of protest activities, such as unofficial journals, petitions, and demonstrations, were also soon spreading out in major cities of China. This movement can be seen as the beginning of the Chinese Democracy Movement. It is also known as the &quot;Democracy Wall Movement&quot;. This short period of political liberation was known as the &quot;Beijing Spring&quot;.
== Background ==

=== The Cultural Revolution ===

In 1966, when Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution, millions of middle school, high school, and college students answered Mao&#x27;s call, being organized as the &quot;Red Guards&quot; to rebel and root out the &quot;capitalist roaders&quot; from within the Chinese Communist Party. But, in 1969, after using students in restoring the social order, Mao launched the &quot;Down to the Countryside Movement&quot; to exile the student &quot;Red Guards&quot; to rural areas. This movement caused a lot of red guards to feel purposely abandoned by Mao. 
In 1971, Lin Biao&#x27;s attempted coup and death shattered the widespread belief in Mao&#x27;s infallibility and in the Cultural Revolution&#x27;s success. On November 19, 1974, Li Yizhe&#x27;s paper appeared on a wall in Guangdong Province. The 67 pages of the paper focused on: (1) Damage to the citizens caused by bureaucratic corruptions of the Chinese Communist Party during the Cultural Revolution; and (2) the need to practice democracy and a legal system in China. This big character poster proved that people started to re-evaluate the Cultural Revolution and political system of China.

The core of the Democracy Movement was composed of former Red Guards.

=== The Tiananmen Incident of 1976 ===

Premier Zhou Enlai, a widely respected senior CCP leader, died on January 8, 1976. On April 5, at the Qingming Festival, thousands of Beijing&#x27;s residents gathered in Tiananmen Square. They wrote poems and put up big character posters in Tiananmen Square to mourn for Zhou and express their anger towards the impious Gang of Four and the destructive Cultural Revolution. In response, Mao ordered the police and the PLA to disperse the people, and around four thousand were arrested. This incident was also called the April 5th Movement. Deng Xiaoping was announced as the &quot;black hand&quot; of the movement. On April 7, Mao Zedong proposed that the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CCP denounce Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s official positions and that Hua Guofeng would assume Deng&#x27;s positions as Prime Minister of the State Council and the Vice-Chairman of the CCP. The committee adopted both proposals.

=== The Discussion on Criteria of Truth ===
After Mao Zedong&#x27;s death occurred on September 9, 1976, with Hua Guofeng as Mao&#x27;s successor, he felt threatened by the politically domineering Gang of Four. On October 6, under the support of Ye Jianying, Li Xiannian, and other members of the Politburo, Hua Guofeng arrested the Gang of Four. On the following day, Hua was voted in as chairman of the CCP and chairman of the Central Military Committee by a joint meeting of the First Secretaries of the Provincial Party Committees and the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CCP. For proving his legitimacy, Hua instructed Wang Dongxing to let the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, &quot;People&#x27;s Liberation Army Daily&quot;, and &quot;Red Flag&quot; magazine to publish an editorial now known as the &quot;Two Whatevers&quot;. Hua claimed that they would honor Mao&#x27;s policy and his instruction to the full extent. On the other hand, on July 21, 1977, during the 3rd Plenary Session of the CCP&#x27;s 10th Central Committee, Deng Xiaoping resumed his positions as Prime Minister of the State Council and Vice-Chairman of the CCP. After Deng came back to work, he started to fix some political decisions of Mao&#x27;s era. During the spring of 1978, 130,000 victims of the Anti-Rightist Movement who had been removed from their positions in 1957, recovered their social statuses. Deng continued to challenge Hua&#x27;s legitimacy and fight for the domination in ideological field. For example, Deng wrote an essay on May 24, 1977 titled &quot;The &#x27;Two Whatever&#x27; Policy Does Not Accord With Marxism&quot;. Under the support of Deng Xiaoping, Hu Yaobang indicated a party journal, &quot;Theoretical Trends&quot; to publish the article &quot;Pragmatism is the Only Standard in Measuring Truth&quot; on May 10, 1978, which marked the key difference between Deng and Hua. This article was re-published in &quot;Guangming Daily&quot;, &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, and &quot;People&#x27;s Liberation Army Daily&quot; and soon caused a huge discussion movement in China, which was called The Discussion on Criteria of Truth .

== Ideologies ==
The Democracy Wall movement framed the key issue as the elimination of bureaucratism and the bureaucratic class. However, the movement lacked ideological cohesion. It involved many individuals and small groups with diverse political views and areas of concern. &quot;From an organizational standpoint, there was no single movement&quot; and ideological views were often sharply-divided. While Democracy Wall participants agreed that &quot;democracy&quot; was the means to resolve the conflict between the bureaucratic class and the people, the nature of the proposed democratic institutions was a major source of disagreement. A majority of participants in the movement viewed the movement as part of a struggle between correct and incorrect notions of Marxism. Many participants advocated classical Marxist views that drew on the Paris Commune for inspiration. The Democracy Wall movement also included non-Marxists and anti-Marxists, although these participants were a minority. 

Thus, demands for &quot;democracy&quot; were frequent but without an agreed-upon meaning. Participants in the movement variously associated the concept of democracy with socialism, communism, liberal democracy, capitalism, and Christianity. They drew on a diverse range of intellectual resources &quot;ranging from classical Marxist and socialist traditions to Enlightenment philosophers, [socialist] experiments in Yugoslavia, and Western liberal democracy.&quot;

Unofficial &quot;people&#x27;s journals&quot; published by activists were the ideological core of the movement. These journals likewise discussed a wide range of topics and ideological stances, including commentaries on socialism, democracy, Marxism, civil rights, and morality, socioeconomic conditions (including wage reform, inequality, and consumer and housing shortages) as well as artistic and literary matters.

Criticism of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution were the most common complaint by movement participants. Some participants, however, revived the Cultural Revolution-era “ultra-left” argument against China’s “bureaucratic class.”
== Wall posters ==
Under the influence of the official discussion, the general public also started to put up big character posters to cause a debate. On August 18, 1977, the 11th National Congress of the CCP recommended adding the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot; (Chinese: ) to Article 45 of the constitution. (&quot;Four Freedoms&quot; or &quot;Four Big&quot; was a political slogan during the Cultural Revolution, which means people have the rights to freedom of speech, freedom of debate, and freedom of putting up big character posters.) From June to July 1978, big character posters were widely spread on major universities of Beijing. The posters were initially encouraged to criticize the Gang of Four and previous failed government policies as part of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s struggle to gain political power. In September, foreign journalists reported that they were allowed free contact with the Chinese people. This report was reproduced in the CCP&#x27;s internal journal, &quot;Reference Information&quot;.

=== The beginning of the Democracy Wall ===
On October 1, 1978, the words &quot;to liberate thought, to provide the best service to the people are the duties of CCP members&quot;, a theme for the CCP Party, was posted on the Xidan Wall in Beijing by civilians. Since then, people were allowed to post their opinions and free-style literature on street walls throughout the country. On November 23, Lü Pu (Chinese: 吕朴) posted his writings on the Democracy Wall in Xidan. He critiqued Mao Zedong and pointed out that the real reasons behind the April 5 Movement were a backward economy, rigid thought control, and the poor living conditions of the people. This poster was called the &quot;Fire Lighter of Democracy Wall&quot;. On November 25, 1978, the Democracy Assembly Group was formed by Ren Wanding and eight other youths. Two days later they gathered at Xidan Democracy Wall and led a public march to Tiananmen Square. Over 10,000 participants demanded democracy and human rights for China. This date marks the beginning of the Democracy Wall.

=== Deng&#x27;s attitudes at the beginning ===

Until this period, most of the big character posters were criticizing the Gang of Four, Mao Zedong, and Hua Guofeng, rather than Deng Xiaoping. So, Deng was still supporting the Democracy Wall movement, during this time, as he remarked to several leaders. On November 26, he told the Japanese delegates of the Democratic Socialist Party that, according to the Constitution, the Democracy Wall activities were legal. However, he noted that some party comrades did not want to criticize Mao, and he agreed. Deng&#x27;s attitude caused more and more people gathering in Democracy Wall and put up poster to express their opinions and support Deng.

=== &quot;The Fifth Modernization&quot; ===

However, besides the pro-Deng group, there was also anti-Deng voice. On December 5, 1978, the most famous poster of the Democracy Wall, &quot;The Fifth Modernization: Democracy and Others&quot; written by writer and activist Wei Jingsheng, was posted on Democracy Wall. This long article strongly criticized the undemocratic practice of Mao and Deng. It also emphasized that (1) the history of Germany, Russia and China proved that anti-democracy was the cause of the poor living conditions of the people; and (2) the political system of Yugoslavia would be a good model for bringing economic wellbeing to the people.

=== Petitioners&#x27; wall poster ===

Besides the big character posters, that talk about the democracy, freedom, and human rights, there were also many posters written by petitioners detailing the suffering and persecution endured during the Cultural Revolution and bureaucratic corruption of local officials. They put up their posters on the same walls and tried to draw attention from the central government to solve their individual cases. However, because this kind of posters were written by less educated people, except for some articles which were re-published in unofficial journals, most of the petitioner&#x27;s posters were torn off afterwards.

== Unofficial journals ==
Academic Liu Sheng-chi writes that the journals of the Democracy Wall movement fall into three categories: (1) the radical left, (2) moderates, and (3) the radical right. The first two categories of journals strayed within the political tradition of Marxism, while the third challenged it. 

=== Original journals ===

Another format of the debate and demonstration was also rapidly developing in China: the &quot;unofficial journals&quot;, also known as &quot;people&#x27;s journals,&quot; &quot;independent journals,&quot; or &quot;underground journals&quot; (Chinese: 地下刊物). On November 26, 1978, &quot;Enlightenment&quot; (Chinese: 启蒙), the first unofficial publication, appeared in Guiyang. Later it was reprinted in Beijing in January 1979. On December 16, 1978, another very famous unofficial journal, &quot;The Forum of April Fifth&quot; (Chinese: 四五论坛) published its first issue. Soon, different groups of activities formed their own editorial organizations to express different political opinions. The arguments concerning political reforms could be divided into three general categories according to their attitudes towards Marxism: classical Marxism, eclectic Marxism, and anti-Marxism radicals. 

Throughout late 1978 and early 1979, crowds would gather to buy or exchange issues of these people&#x27;s journals.
=== Lists of unofficial journals ===

From the winter of 1978 to spring 1981, over 50 unofficial journals appeared in Beijing alone. The following list includes some famous journals during the movement:
=== Organizations ===

Since early 1979, unofficial journals became the backbone of the Democracy Wall Movement. The activities were also seeking to organize together to form a stronger concentrated structure. On January 15, 1979, six leading unofficial journals announced their intention to fight for the basic constitutional rights: freedom of speech and freedom of the press without retaliation. These freedoms were never realized. On January 28, the members of seven unofficial journals in Beijing organized a joint conference to counter the criticism against their literature on Democracy Wall. These members then met weekly to discuss recent public issues. However, this was still a very loose organization and their opinions varied to the point of not achieving their objectives.

=== Impact of the unofficial journals ===

The wall posters and the underground journals&#x27; connections were intimately linked. It was a common practice to print posters in the journals, as well as to post the printed pages on the Xidan Wall. The editors also sold their journals near the Democracy Wall. Printing and publishing journals was not an easy task due to the lack of technicians and funding. So, the journals&#x27; circulation was relatively small, usually from 200 to 500 copies per issue. As, for example, the editors of &quot;People&#x27;s Reference News&quot; (Chinese: 群众参考消息) calculated in May 1979, they had some 300-400 subscribers and had received almost 1000 letters from readers in two months. However, compared to wall posters, journals were more substantial than the numbers of subscribers, because people usually hand copy and re-send to other people, which caused the unofficial journal to be widely spread all over China. The most complete collection of the unofficial documents today is the 20-volume &quot;Collection of Underground Publications Circulated on Chinese Mainland&quot; (Chinese: 大陆地下刊物汇编), which was edited by the Taiwanese Institution for the Study of Chinese Communist Problems from 1980 to 1985.

<text>A surah (; ; ) is an Arabic word meaning &#x27;chapter&#x27; in the Quran. Its plural form in Arabic is suwar.

There are 114 &quot;suwar&quot; in the Quran, each divided into verses (). The &quot;suwar&quot; are of unequal length; the shortest &quot;surah&quot; (al-Kawthar) has only three verses, while the longest (al-Baqarah) contains 286 verses. The Qur&#x27;an consists of one short introductory chapter (Q1), eight very long chapters, making up one-third of the Qur&#x27;an (Q2‒9); 19 mid-length chapters, making up another one-third (Q10‒28); and 86 short and very short ones of the last one-third (Q29‒114).

Of the 114 &quot;suwar&quot; in the Quran, 86 are classified as Meccan (), as according to Islamic tradition they were revealed before Muhammad&#x27;s migration to Medina (&quot;hijrah&quot;), while 28 are Medinan (), as they were revealed after. This classification is only approximate in regard to the location of revelation; any &quot;surah&quot; revealed after the migration is termed Medinan and any revealed before it is termed Meccan, regardless of where the &quot;surah&quot; was revealed. However, some Meccan &quot;suwar&quot; contain Medinian verses (verses revealed after the migration) and vice versa. Whether a &quot;surah&quot; is Medinian or Meccan depends on if the beginning of the &quot;surah&quot; was revealed before or after the migration. 

The Meccan &quot;surah&quot; generally deal with faith and scenes of the Hereafter while the Medinan &quot;surah&quot; are more concerned with organizing the social life of the nascent Muslim community and leading Muslims to the ultimate goal of attaining &quot;dar al-Islam&quot; by showing strength towards the unbelievers. Except for Surah al-Tawbah, all &quot;suwar&quot; commence with &quot;In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful&quot; (). This formula is known as the &quot;basmalah&quot; () and denotes the boundaries between &quot;suwar. &quot;The &quot;suwar&quot; are arranged roughly in order of descending size; therefore the arrangement of the Qur&#x27;an is neither chronological nor thematic. &quot;Surah&quot; are recited during the standing portions () of Muslim prayers. Al-Fatihah, the first &quot;surah&quot; of the Qur&#x27;an, is recited in every unit of prayer, and some units of prayer also involve recitation of all or part of any other &quot;surah&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;surah&quot; was used at the time of Muhammad as a term with the meaning of a &quot;portion&quot; or a set of verses of the Qur&#x27;an. This is evidenced by the appearance of the word &quot;surah&quot; in multiple locations in the Quran such as verse : &quot;a &quot;sûrah&quot; which We have revealed and made ˹its rulings˺ obligatory, and revealed in it clear commandments so that you may be mindful.&quot; (see also verses , , , , , , and ). It is also mentioned in plural form in the Quran: &quot;Or do they say, “He has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Produce ten fabricated &quot;sûrahs&quot; like it and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!”&quot;

In 1938, Arthur Jeffery suggested that the name derived from the Syriac word &quot;surṭā&quot; meaning &#x27;writing&#x27;.

== Chronological order of chapters ==
Chapters in the Qur&#x27;an are not arranged in the chronological order of revelation, and the precise order has eluded scholars. According to hadith, Muhammad told his companions the traditional placement of every wahy () as was revealed to him, and Wm Theodore de Bary, an East Asian studies expert, describes that &quot;The final process of collection and codification of the Qur&#x27;an text was guided by one over-arching principle: God&#x27;s words must not in any way be distorted or sullied by human intervention. For this reason, no attempt was made to edit the numerous revelations, organize them into thematic units, or present them in chronological order...&quot;.

A common view is that &quot;surah&quot; of the Meccan period (i.e. pre-&quot;hijrah&quot;) are more related to themes such as resurrection, judgment, and stories from Judaism and Christianity. &quot;Suwar&quot; of the Medinian period (i.e. post-&quot;hijrah&quot;) focus more on laws for personal affairs, society, and the state.
=== Early attempts ===
A number of medieval Islamic writers attempted to compile a chronologically ordered list of the chapters, with differing results. As no transmitted reports dating back to the time of Muhammad or his companions exists, their works necessarily represent the opinions of scholars, and none originates before the first quarter of the 8th century. One version is given in a 15th-century work by Abd al-Kafi, and is included in the chronological order given by the standard Egyptian edition of the Qur&#x27;an (1924). Another list is mentioned by Abu Salih, while a significantly different version of Abu Salih&#x27;s is preserved in the book &#x27;Kitab Mabani&#x27;. Yet another, from the 10th century, is given by Ibn Nadim.

A number of verses are associated with particular events which helps date them. Muhammad&#x27;s first revelation was Chapter 96 and in the year 609. Verses 16:41 and 47:13 refer to migration of Muslims which took place in the year 622. Verses 8:1–7 and 3:120–175 refer to battles of Badr (624) and Uhud (625) respectively. Muhammad&#x27;s last pilgrimage () is mentioned in 5:3 which occurred in 632, a few months before he died. This method is of limited usefulness because the Qur&#x27;an narrates the life of Muhammad or the early history of the Muslim community only incidentally and not in detail. In fact, very few chapters contain clear references to events which took place in Muhammad&#x27;s life.

===Modern work ===

Theodor Nöldeke&#x27;s chronology is based on the assumption that the style of the Qur&#x27;an changes in one direction without reversals. Nöldeke studied the style and content of the chapters and assumed that first, later (Medinan) chapters and verses and are generally shorter than earlier (Meccan) ones, and second, that earlier Meccan verses have a distinct rhyming style while later verses are more prosaic (prose-like). According to Nöldeke, earlier chapters have common features: many of them open with oaths in which God swears by cosmic phenomena, they have common themes (including eschatology, creation, piety, authentication of Muhammad&#x27;s mission and refutation of the charges against Muhammad), and some Meccan chapters have a clear &#x27;tripartite&#x27; structure (for example chapters 45, 37, 26, 15, 21). Tripartite chapters open with a short warning, followed by one or more narratives about unbelievers, and finally address contemporaries of Muhammad and invite them to Islam. On the other hand, Madinan verses are longer and have a distinct style of rhyming and concern to provide legislation and guidance for the Muslim community.

Richard Bell took Nöldeke&#x27;s chronology as a starting point for his research, however, Bell did not believe that Nöldeke&#x27;s criteria of style were important. He saw a progressive change in Muhammad&#x27;s mission from a man who preached monotheism into an independent leader of a paramount religion. For Bell this transformation in Muhammad&#x27;s mission was more decisive compared with Nöldeke&#x27;s criteria of style. Bell argued that passages which mentioned Islam and Muslim or implied that Muhammad&#x27;s followers were a distinct community were revealed later. He classified the Qur&#x27;an into three main periods: the early period, the Qur&#x27;anic period, and the book period. Bell worked on the chronology of verses instead of chapters. Underlying Bell&#x27;s method for dating revelations is the assumption that the normal unit of revelation is the short passage and the passages have been extensively edited and rearranged.

Mehdi Bazargan divided the Qur&#x27;an into 194 independent passages preserving some chapters intact as single blocks while dividing others into two or more blocks. He then rearranged these blocks approximately in order of increasing average verse length. This order he proposes is the chronological order. Bazargan assumed that verse length tended to increase over time and he used this assumption to rearrange the passages.

Neal Robinson, a scholar of Islamic studies, is of the opinion that there is no evidence that the style of Qur&#x27;an has changed in a consistent way and therefore style may not always be a reliable indicator of when and where a chapter was revealed. According to Robinson, the problem of the chronology of authorship is still far from solved.

== Names of chapters in the Qur&#x27;an ==
The verses and chapters in the Qur&#x27;an did not originally have a title attached to them. Muhammad, as we find in some reports in &quot;hadith&quot;, used to refer to shorter chapters not by name, rather by their first verse. For example: Abu Hurairah quoted Muhammad as saying, &quot;&quot;Al-Hamdu Lillahi Rabb il-`Aalameen&quot; () is the Mother of the Qur&#x27;an, the Mother of the Book, and the seven oft-repeated verses of the Glorious Qur&#x27;an.&quot; We also find reports in which Muhammad used to refer to them by their name. For example, Abdullah bin Buraydah narrated from his father, &quot;I was sitting with the Prophet and I heard him say, &#x27;Learn Surat ul-Baqarah, because in learning it there is blessing, in ignoring it there is sorrow, and the sorceresses cannot memorize it.

Arab tradition, similar to other tribal cultures of that time, was to name things according to their unique characteristics. They used this same method to name Qur&#x27;anic chapters. Most chapter names are found in the ahadith. Some were named according to their central theme, such as &quot;Al-Fatiha&quot; (The Opening) and &quot;Yusuf&quot; (Joseph), and some were named for the first word at the beginning of the chapter, such as &quot;Qaf&quot;, &quot;Ya-Sin&quot;, and &quot;ar-Rahman&quot;. Some &quot;surahs&quot; were also named according to a unique word that occurs in the chapter, such as &quot;al-Baqarah&quot; (The Cow), &quot;An-Nur&quot; (The Light), al-Nahl (The Bee), &quot;Az-Zukhruf&quot; (The Ornaments of Gold), &quot;Al-Hadid&quot; (The Iron), and &quot;Al-Ma&#x27;un&quot; (The Small Kindness).

Most chapter names are still used to this day. Several are known by multiple names: &quot;Surah&quot; &quot;Al-Masadd&quot; (The Palm Fibre) is also known as &quot;Surah al-Lahab&quot; (The Flame). &quot;Surah&quot; &quot;Fussilat&quot; (Explained in Detail) is also known as &quot;Ha-Meem Sajda&quot; (&quot;...it is a chapter that begins with &quot;Ha Mim&quot; () and in which a verse requiring the performance of prostration () has occurred.&quot;)

== Coherence in the Qur&#x27;an ==
The idea of textual relation between the verses of a chapter has been discussed under various titles such as &quot;nazm&quot; () and &quot;munasabah&quot; () in literature of the Islamic sphere and &#x27;Coherence&#x27;, &#x27;text relations&#x27;, &#x27;intertextuality&#x27;, and &#x27;unity&#x27; in English literature. There are two points of view regarding the coherence of the verses of the Qur&#x27;an. In the first viewpoint, each chapter of the Qur&#x27;an has a central theme and its verses are related. The second viewpoint considers some chapters of the Qur&#x27;an as collections of passages which are not thematically related. Chapters deal with various subjects, for instance, chapter 99, which comprises only eight verses, is devoted exclusively to eschatology and chapter 12 narrates a story, while other chapters, in the same breath, speak of theological, historical, and ethico-legal matters. Chapters are known to consist of passages, not only verses. The borders between passages are arbitrary but are possible to determine. 

For example, chapter 54 may be divided into six passages:
* The Hour has drawn near...()
* Before them, the people of Noah denied...()
* ’Ȃd ˹also˺ rejected ˹the truth˺. Then how ˹dreadful˺ were My punishment and warnings!... ()
* Thamûd rejected the warnings ˹as well˺... ()
* The people of Lot ˹also˺ rejected the warnings... ()
* And indeed, the warnings ˹also˺ came to the people of Pharaoh... ()

The study of text relations in the Qur&#x27;an dates back to a relatively early stage in the history of Qur&#x27;anic studies. The earliest Qur&#x27;anic interpreter () known to have paid attention to this aspect of the Qur&#x27;an is Fakhruddin al-Razi (d.1209 ). Al-Razi believed that text relation is a meaning that links verses together or mentally associates them like cause-effect or reason-consequence. He linked to verse 1 of a chapter to verse 2, verse 2 to verse 3 and so on, and rejected traditionist interpretations if they contradicted interrelations between verses. Az-Zarkashi (d.1392), another medieval Qur&#x27;anic exegete, admitted that relationships of some verses to other verses in a chapter is sometimes hard to explain, in those cases he assigned stylistic and rhetorical functions to them such as parenthesis, parable, or intentional subject shift. Az-Zarkashi aimed at showing how important understanding the inter-verse relations is to understanding the Qur&#x27;an, however, he did not attempt to deal with one complete chapter to show its relations.

Contemporary scholars have studied the idea of coherence in the Qur&#x27;an more vigorously and are of widely divergent opinions. For example, Hamid Farrahi (d. 1930) and Richard Bell (d. 1952) have different opinions regarding coherence within chapters. Farrahi believed that the whole structure of the Qur&#x27;an is thematically coherent, which is to say, all verses of a chapter of the Qur&#x27;an are integrally related to each other to give rise to the major theme of the chapter and again all of the chapters are interconnected with each other to constitute the major theme of the Quran. According to Farrahi, each chapter has a central theme (&quot;umud&quot; or pillar) around which the verses revolve:
In contrast, Richard Bell describes the Qur&#x27;anic style as disjointed:
Arthur J. Arberry states that the chapters in many instances, as Muslims have been recognized from the earliest times, are of a &#x27;composite&#x27; character, holding embedded in them fragments received by Muhammad at widely differing dates. However he disregards this &#x27;fact&#x27; and views each chapter as an artistic whole. He believed that a repertory of familiar themes runs through the whole Qur&#x27;an and each chapter elaborates one of more, often many of, them.

Angelika Neuwirth is of the idea that verses in their chronological order are interrelated in a way that later verses explain earlier ones. She believes that Meccan chapters are coherent units.

Salwa El-Awa aims in her work to discuss the problem of textual relations in the Qur&#x27;an from a linguistic point of view and the way in which the verses of one chapter relate to each other and to the wider context of the total message of the Qur&#x27;an. El-Awa provides a detailed analysis in terms of coherence theory on chapters 33 and 75 and shows that these two chapters cohere and have a main contextual relationship.

Gheitury and Golfam believe that the permanent change of subject within a passage in the Qur&#x27;an, or what they call non-linearity, is a major linguistic feature of the Qur&#x27;an, a feature that puts the Qur&#x27;an beyond any specific &#x27;context&#x27; and &#x27;temporality&#x27;. According to Gheitury and Golfam for the Qur&#x27;an there is no preface, no introduction, no beginning, no end, a reader can start reading from anywhere in the text.

<text>The people&#x27;s commune () was the highest of three administrative levels in rural areas of the People&#x27;s Republic of China during the period from 1958 to 1983, until they were replaced by townships. Communes, the largest collective units, were divided in turn into production brigades and production teams. The people&#x27;s commune collectivized living and working practices. Many individual homes were abolished in favour of communal residences, with many houses taken apart and demolished. Regardless of age or relationship, many men and women lived separately, and often, multiple families were placed in the same communal homes. One&#x27;s land, tools, resources were pooled together, with working hours and farming practices completely dictated by the CCP.

The scale of the commune and its ability to extract income from the rural population enabled commune administrations to invest in large-scale mechanization, infrastructure, and industrial projects. The communes did not, however, meet many of their long-term goals, such as facilitating the construction of full Communism in the rural areas, fully liberating women from housework, and creating sustainable agriculture practices in the countryside. They also had governmental, political, and economic functions during the Cultural Revolution. They ranged in number from 50,000 to 90,000. 

==History==

=== Precedents and Collectivization in the Early PRC ===
Before the people&#x27;s communes were established, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had experimented with and promoted other, smaller forms of collectivized agriculture. Before 1949, landlords owned almost half of the land in rural China and leased it out to tenant farmers. Many farms were relatively small, family-operated enterprises. Farmers generally went through cycles of busyness during harvest season and relative idleness during off seasons. During the Civil War era and continuing into the early years of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the CCP implemented wide-ranging land reforms, attempted to identify and classify the rural population, and redistributed land from the landlords to the middle peasants and poor peasants to revolutionize the social structure of China. After the completion of the Land Reform, individual families owned the land they farmed, paid taxes as households, and sold grain at prices set by the state.

Rural collectivization began soon after the CCP announced its 1953 &quot;general line for the transition to socialism.&quot; Over the next six years, collectivization took several incrementally progressing forms: mutual aid groups, primitive cooperatives, and people&#x27;s communes.

With state coordination, many families—up to 68 million by 1954—joined Mutual Aid Teams. These Mutual Aid Teams helped farming families coordinate the sharing of labor, farming technology, and other resources. Some Mutual Aid Teams also formed, or were consolidated into, Agricultural Producer Cooperatives (APCs), larger institutions at the village or subvillage level that pooled resources and collectively managed land.

During 1954-1955, farmers in many areas began pooling their land, capital resources, and labor into beginning-level agricultural producers&#x27; cooperatives. In the complex system of beginning-level agricultural producers&#x27; cooperatives, farmers received a share of the harvest based on a combination of how much labor and how much land they contributed to the cooperative.

By June 1956, over 60% of rural households had been collectivized into higher-level agricultural producers&#x27; cooperatives, a structure that was similar to Soviet collective farmering via &quot;kolkhozy&quot;. In these cooperatives, tens of households pooled land and draft animals. Adult members of the cooperative were credited with work points based on how much labor they had provided at which tasks. At the end of the year, the collective deducted taxes and fixed-price sales to the state, and the cooperative retained seed for the next year as well as some investment and welfare funds. The collective then distributed to the households the remainder of the harvest and some of the money received from sales to the state. The distribution was based partly on work points accrued by the adult members of a household, and partly at a standard rate by age and sex. These cooperatives also lent small amounts of land back to households individually on which the households could grow crops to consume directly or sell at market. Apart from the large-scale communization during the Great Leap Forward, Higher-level Agricultural Producers&#x27; Collectives (HAPCs) were generally the dominant form of rural collectivization in China. These cooperatives also created new administrative and economic issues, but the CCP proceeded with the collectivizing process.

In 1958, in the aftermath of the Hundred Flowers Campaign and Anti-Rightist Campaign, Mao Zedong shifted course from emphasizing economic growth toward emphasizing the rapid establishment of communism. Achieving communism, for Mao, also required economic growth but had to, at the same time, involve further collectivization and the elimination of old (or feudal) ways of living. Party propaganda outlets publicized an enormous collective in Xushui, Hebei as a &quot;commune,&quot; in which &quot;peasant&quot; households had given way to communal living, and people did not have to worry about money or food. Mao visited Xushui and similar larger, purportedly very productive units in Henan province and declared, &quot;People&#x27;s communes are good.&quot; Mao and his allies in the CCP leadership continued to promote the communes both in propaganda and party meetings, and the construction of communes quickly became party line and a central pillar of the Great Leap Forward.

As the Great Leap Forward got underway, the state consolidated HAPCs into about 26,000 communes, each containing on average 4,500 hectares of land, 24,000 people, and 5,200 households. The sizes of different communes varied widely across different regions but they were consistently much larger than HAPCs had been, and the communes encompassed on average about thirty HAPCs and up to one hundred. The communes were supposed to be instrumental to the PRC&#x27;s goal of &quot;surpassing Britain and catching up to the US&quot; in steel production.

=== Ideological and economic motivations ===
Over the summer of 1958, agricultural producers&#x27; collectives were merged into much larger collectives which comprised tens of thousands of people, typically encompassing a market town and its surrounding villages. CCP leadership called these giant administrative and economic regions &quot;People&#x27;s Communes&quot; (人民公社), in line with the socialist and communist idea of the &quot;commune.&quot; This term “commune” traces back to Western Europe, originally referring to autonomous cities or towns. Under the influence of Robert Owen, Friedrich Engels used this term to refer to the basic unit of organization in a Communist society, and it was seen by Karl Marx as a form of proletariat governance. Influenced by both Marx and Engels, Mao envisioned the People&#x27;s Communes to be the basic unit of Chinese society made up of and ruled by the working class. 

For Mao, these communes were to be characterized by their size and publicity. He wrote, &quot;They&#x27;re called people&#x27;s communes, first, because they&#x27;re big and, second because they&#x27;re public. Lots of people, a vast area of land, large scale of production, and all their undertakings are done in a big way. They integrate government administration with commune management to establish public mess halls, and private plots are eliminated.&quot;In addition to this, the CCP&#x27;s communes were defined by three main factors, especially during the Great Leap Forward: first, an emphasis on industrialization and productivity; second, a militarization of society, in which commune members were mobilized through military-style campaigns and exhorted to act with rigid discipline, devotion, and selflessness; and third, an ideal of self-reliance or local autonomy, such that each commune would be able to produce most of the supplies and technology that it needed to function.

This emphasis on efficient, independent, organized production and industrialization was driven by the CCP’s desire to demonstrate the PRC’s superiority over foreign powers. In their earlier years of rule in 1955-56, the CCP was determined to “surpass Britain and catch up with the United States.” By 1958, this competitive mindset was also applied to the Soviet Union. Mao was optimistic that the PRC would reach the true Communist society before the Soviet Union did, by increasing their productivity through a change in their production system. The People&#x27;s Communes were a means to this end; the Central Committee of the CCP stating in the &#x27;Resolution on Setting up the People&#x27;s Communes in the Countryside&#x27; that China &quot;should actively apply the method of the People’s Communes in search of a practical way to make the transition to communism now.&quot;

As the CCP Politburo declared at the 1958 Beidahe Conference, the communes were meant to bring together all key occupations and professions into one unit and, by merging them, bring about &quot;socialist construction&quot;:
&quot;The establishment of people&#x27;s communes with all-round management of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side occupations, and fishery, where industry (the worker), agriculture (the peasant), exchange (the trader), culture and education (the student), and military affairs (the militiaman) merge into one, is the fundamental policy to guide the peasant to accelerate socialist construction, complete the building of socialism ahead of time, and carry out the gradual transition to communism.&quot;By &quot;socialist construction,&quot; the resolution referred to the process in which the PRC was supposed to build up its industry under the vanguard Communist Party and, through the process of industrialization, accumulate enough capital and power to advance toward full communism. This meant the completion of two transitions. First, the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. Second, from distribution according to ability or labor to distribution according to need, with the self-rule of the proletariat (see also: Primary stage of socialism). 

Mao hoped that the communes would create an &quot;industrial army&quot; out of the countryside, essentially turning the rural workforce into a well-disciplined engine of production. He thought this militarization would be the key to efficient production, given the supposed ease of management and control, and its potential to bolster the motivation of peasants and the working class to work.

Other members of the CCP leadership were more wary of Mao&#x27;s plan for rapid agricultural modernization, and they pointed out the potentially prohibitive costs of this process and resources that it would require (such as iron, steel, and petroleum), and they argued that agricultural modernization might lead to unemployment given that rural workers would not necessarily be able to find other jobs in the countryside and urban industry remained relatively small. Nevertheless, Mao&#x27;s faction won out.

These debates, and the communes themselves, were oriented toward a question facing the Chinese economy in the 1950s: how could the PRC grow its industrial base when most of the population remained tied to agricultural work and small-scale sideline production for subsistence? The communes would require a great deal of coordination and at times coercion but would also, in theory, address this basic issue. By forcing people to move into these large units, the commune leadership could coordinate larger infrastructural and industrial projects more effectively, extract income from the commune residents, and allocate this capital income to the larger projects, which would in turn make the commune more productive and efficient and free up labor for further development. Thus, one of the goal of the people&#x27;s commune was to improve agricultural productivity such that fewer people had to work in agriculture and could instead use their energy and resources for industrialization.

=== During the Great Leap Forward ===
In their first few years of existence, the communes created a wide range of economic, social, and administrative issues and exacerbated the Great Leap Forward famine. The CCP leadership then made major reforms to the commune structure after the Great Leap and again in the decades that followed in order to make them more stable, productive, and efficient. Regardless of the stated goals of the communes, however, the PRC economy at the time was not oriented toward the countryside. Most productive industry was already located in the cities, and urban residents—those with jobs in key enterprises and industries—were the best-paid and best-fed in the country. As a result, the communes existed, above all, to extract grain from the countryside to support both consumption and production in the cities, and to employ surplus population when the cities grew too large.

Communization proceeded on a largely voluntary basis, avoiding both the violence and sabotage that occurred during the Soviet collectivization. According to academic Lin Chun, China&#x27;s collectivization proceeded smoothly because, unlike the Soviet experience, a network of state institutions already existed in the countryside. Academic Ken Hammond attributes the comparatively non-contentious process of collectivization in China to its gradual process in which productivity gains appeared to be made at each step.

=== After the Great Leap Forward ===
The communes also changed shape considerably over time. To address some of the early shortcomings, the central leadership quickly adopted major reforms. During the Great Leap, the leadership revised the free supply system back into a labor-based system of distribution. In late 1960, the unit of accounting through which labor and income were allocated was devolved from the people&#x27;s commune to the production brigade. In many cases, these brigades corresponded to the high level agricultural producers&#x27; cooperatives that had preceded the people&#x27;s communes.

In 1961, the average size of the communes was reduced to one-third of the original, and the basic accounting unit (i.e., the unit at which productivity was measured and work points were allocated) devolved from the commune to the brigade to, in 1962, the production team. In the aftermath of the Great Leap Forward, as Mao Zedong retreated from guiding the economic course of the PRC, other members of the leadership enacted additional reforms to the commune. Particularly important was the reintroduction of the &quot;Three Freedoms&quot;: private household plots, sideline industries, and small-scale animal husbandry. These &quot;freedoms&quot; enabled commune residents to maintain some basic subsistence measures outside of their commune work, and, as the communes became more efficient, commune residents were increasingly able to spend more time developing their own projects. Newly built communes did not retain the collectivized living arrangements and allowed for separate family spaces, even if residents still lived in large, central complexes.

The production team remained the unit of account until agricultural was totally decollectivized between 1979 and 1982.

== Commune life ==

=== Layout and provision of services ===
People&#x27;s communes were much more communal than the collectives that had been merged into them. In their most ambitious Great-Leap form, the communes were supposed to make nearly all domestic labor (cooking, taking care of children, education, washing, etc.) communal. In the early stages of the Great Leap Forward, the communes supplied some goods and services for free, such that food in the communal dining halls would be available for whoever wanted it rather than allocated based on workpoints or one&#x27;s own household possessions. This system was known as &quot;free supply.&quot;

Mao also considered militias and military-style organization essential to the success of the communes, and he promoted communization as a process of &quot;militarization, combatization, and disciplinization.&quot; As Mao saw it, a spirit of militarized organization, sacrifice, dedication, and selflessness would enable the Chinese people to overcome production bottlenecks through sheer effort. Each commune had a &quot;people&#x27;s militia,&quot; a group of commune members who took on military-style roles, adopted military terminology, and were responsible for organizing the commune population, defending the commune, and ensuring that commune members followed directives and maintained appropriate political behavior. The height of militarized fervor subsided after the Great Leap Forward, but the &quot;people&#x27;s militias&quot; continued to shape commune life and organization thereafter, especially during the Cultural Revolution.

During the Great Leap Forward, the process of bringing people into the communes, or communization, successfully uprooted traditional ways of farming and living but often failed to replace them with viable or productive alternatives. People had to give up their personal belongings, including everyday items such as farming and kitchen tools to smelt in &quot;backyard steel furnaces.&quot; These items were supposed to be useless scrap materials, but cadres and other zealous commune members encouraged people to contribute more and more items, to the extent that some communities melted down all of their pots and pans. The resulting steel and iron was mostly useless, and people who had to make steel could not spend as much time working in the fields. When, for a variety of structural and environmental factors (see also: Great Leap Forward), a larger famine set in, this shift from agricultural work to unproductive industrial labor only worsened conditions in the communes.

Some communes, such as the Macheng commune in Hubei (which was held up as a &quot;model commune&quot; at the national level, see also: Macheng), also demolished tens of thousands of private residences in order to bring about collective living arrangements and improve production efficiency. Macheng commune leaders also destroyed gravesites in order to open up more land for cultivation. Such destruction, the relative lack of compensation, and the lack of actual production increases all made the communization process incredibly disruptive and even deadly. In Raoyang Village in Hebei Province, the communization process also alienated villagers as cadres ended the temple fair, destroyed temples, cut back on traditional opera, and forced the local market to mostly close, all of which prevented villagers from engaging in traditional rites and celebrations. In the process of enforcing these new regulations, some cadres also abused their power and assaulted or humiliated villagers.

Communes were supposed to rationalize the working lives of rural residents, for example by spacing out new residential areas evenly rather than adhering to traditional village boundaries. With these new spatial plans, commune administrations aimed to reduce the amount of walking time required for farmers to get to their fields. But, in the frenzied and militarized atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward, rural residents were organized into &quot;production armies&quot; and might spend most of their time walking around between work sites, as they were tasked with too many different non-agricultural projects at once.

Conditions varied widely from commune to commune. The most immediate constraint on communal &quot;free supply&quot; was the availability of resources and the commune members&#x27; willingness to participate in the new collective institutions. Commune members had a range of reasons to resist or express discontent with the communization process, largely due to either the inadequacies and inefficiencies of the commune system itself or the disruptive and destructive process by which the communes were first created. Some issues that arose for commune members included: overwork on non-agricultural projects (at the expense of subsistence-oriented farming), inefficient or counterproductive infrastructure projects (such as the backyard furnaces), lack of food at the communal dining halls, negligent educational and childcare services which created additional housework burdens for women, excessive and obligatory political study sessions, and confusing incentive structures for production. Additionally, because markets were closed and sideline industries were banned, people could not turn to some of the traditional methods of dealing with economic and agricultural hardship.

Despite these instances of resistance, there were no large-scale uprisings against the commune system as a whole. Scholars such as Joshua Eisenman write that this lack of massive resistance indicates that the commune system, with its post-Great Leap Forward adjustments, ended up serving the basic purposes of, first, feeding the countryside, and, second, extracting enough income from rural residents to fund modernizing projects and free up labor. Restrictions on individuals&#x27; mobility, however, would have made it extremely difficult for potential dissidents to coordinate resistance to the communes at a regional or provincial level, and the Anti-Rightist Movement had severely undermined people&#x27;s willingness to openly criticize the party.

The conditions on communes varied considerably by geographic location. Different provincial administrations were more or less zealous in pursuing communization. Different provinces also did not have the same resources at their disposal for communization, and the Great Leap famine&#x27;s severity depended on local weather, grain extraction for exports (or requisitioning for internal trade), and the response or lack thereof from local officials. At the commune level, variation might also depend on the local geography or the layout that the commune organizers preferred. For example, some communes such as the Panyu people&#x27;s commune in Guangdong province were organized around a central spatial axis such as a main road or a mountain range, and residences were built near the main production facilities. Other communes were built instead with a focus on public facilities such as canteens, performance spaces, and community centers. These differences in spatial organization could then affect the daily lives of commune residents, as they might spend more time working on industrial projects as opposed to in political or cultural meetings, or, depending on the layout of their commune, they might spend additional time transiting between the two.

=== Rural healthcare ===
For a number of years after the establishment of the people&#x27;s communes, healthcare stations were developed as fee-for-service hospitals to cover several large production brigades.

During the Cultural Revolution, Mao emphasized the need to improve medical care in rural China. The Rural Cooperative Medical System (RCMS) developed in the late 1960s. In this system, each large production brigade established a medical cooperative station staffed by barefoot doctors. The medical cooperative stations provided primary health care. For treatment of major diseases, rural people traveled to state-owned hospitals.

=== Urban communes ===
During the Great Leap Forward, the CPC central leadership also pushed cities to create communes of their own, modeled on the one set up in Zhengzhou, Henan. As with the rural communes, the urban communes were supposed to improve production and social cohesion by: collectivizing living arrangements and socializing domestic labor (i.e., making housework collective in order to free up female labor for other work); combining many different social, economic, cultural, and political institutions in the same space (i.e., the commune); and thereby pushing the PRC forward on the road to socialism. As the CCP Central Committee put it,The urban people&#x27;s commune will be the tool for transforming old cities into new socialist cities and the organizer of production, exchange, distribution and welfare in people&#x27;s lives, as well as the social organization which would combine industrial, agricultural, military, educational and trade circles and eventually merge government administration with commune management.Production and labor, especially female labor, were essential to these &quot;socialist cities,&quot; as the first Zhengzhou Commune statute made clear: the commune would &quot;[push] forward the elimination of private property and the complete liberation of productive forces, in particular women&#x27;s productive force.&quot; To view the communes as liberatory, the CCP leadership had to assume that the labor women already did inside and outside the home was not sufficiently or meaningfully productive, and that the act of working in factories or other industrial projects would free women from patriarchal household structures.

The urban communes did create new communal institutions and these institutions garnered some popularity, but the main outcome of the urban communes in the short run was—in addition to new services—disorder, inefficiency, and frustration. According to official statistics from 1960, the urban communes created: 53,000 public canteens, 50,000 nurseries, and 55,000 service centers that provided for other daily needs (such as laundry, repairing, and cleaning). The boundaries between workers and managers were loosened and the welfare benefits associated with a work unit (&quot;danwei&quot;) were extended to migrants and women through a large employment program. Such changes represented an enormous expansion of urban welfare benefits, in contrast with the relatively restricted welfare policy the PRC pursued before and after this period.

The communes, and the state as a whole, were not able to sustain such expansion either financially or organizationally. At the same time, the members of the communes, as in the countryside, were mobilized to achieve huge production quotas and other political and manual work. The urban communes were relatively productive, even with some waste and overproduction, but in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, people began to complain that the commune services were subpar or incompetent and the work was excessive (especially for women who often continued to have to do housework), and the expenditure on welfare made the communes unprofitable as a whole. By late 1961, many people in these cities had stopped using commune services, and the communes closed down some of their amenities. Ultimately, although the communes were economically unsustainable and socially disruptive, some city residents lamented their closure, as they had provided jobs or amenities that the existing, more limited welfare system did not.

In addition to the failure of the communes to provide the services they had intended to collectivize, the urban communes also ran up against economic issues surrounding housing and urban construction. Three developments were particularly important: first, during the Great Leap Forward, a large proportion of public funding was allocated for capital construction (e.g., factories, mines) rather than housing construction, and so cities had relatively little money with which to construct new, durable housing. Second, the construction of housing was especially pressing because the Great Leap Forward had freed up a great deal of the rural workforce to move into the cities to work in industry, leading to a shock of urbanization. And third, Great Leap-era plans for urban construction were highly ambitious, both in the scope of construction and the economizing techniques that builders were supposed to rely on, given that more resources were being directed to industrial projects. Thus, Great Leap Forward policies exacerbated demand for new urban housing but did not provide funding to meet that demand and instead pushed the construction projects to rely on non-industrial materials (such as bricks) and the recycling of materials, either from demolished buildings or leftover from other projects. The idea that urban communes would both promote production and reorganize living space within the same institutions ran up against an economic contradiction, namely that Great Leap policies provided resources for the former (production) but not the latter (living space). Hence, when the central leadership decided to address the economic crisis, one of the major steps they took to lessen the cost of welfare provision was to lay off urban workers and step up the process of &quot;ruralization,&quot; sending these workers to the countryside.

Unlike the rural communes, the urban ones did not last after the Great Leap Forward. The urban communes, however, still had lasting effects on urban planning, as, for example, with the Beijing city plan of 1958. This plan featured radical changes to the urban landscape, including an emphasis on communal construction and the destruction of walls, and, although the central leadership never officially approved this plan, urban planners continued relying on it up until the Cultural Revolution. The urban communes also represented the peak of the PRC&#x27;s urban welfare provision, and the economic untenability of this system led the CCP leadership to enact policies reinforcing and sharpening the rural-urban divide.

In the people&#x27;s commune, many things were shared. Private kitchens became redundant, and in some counties items in the private kitchen such as tables, chairs, cooking utensils and pans were contributed to the commune&#x27;s kitchen. Private cooking was discouraged and supplanted by communal dining.

== Impact ==
The rural cooperative movement replaced village power structures influenced by kinship and community elites with a formalized administrative system. The process linked families and individuals to national policies, creating what academic Cai Xiang describes as a new social space.

Collective labor created possibilities from women to leave the home and increase their personal and economic independence.

During the Great Leap Forward, the communes contributed to the widespread famine conditions, as the communes overworked their residents, confiscated necessary everyday items, and misallocated labor and resources on unproductive projects over basic foodstuffs. With the adjustments made to the communes after the Great Leap, however, they did contribute to the PRC&#x27;s relatively substantial growth in agricultural productivity over the remaining years before decollectivization. The work point system did not always provide clear incentive structures for commune workers but the value of the work points was calculated in such a way that the commune took roughly half the laborer&#x27;s income before they turned the work points into material goods. Using this extracted capital, the communes were able to invest in mechanization, infrastructure, irrigation, soil reclamation, and other large-scale projects that required large amounts of investment and labor. Moreover, the communes continued to provide some basic services such as education and health services, and the industrial projects built on some communes gave commune members technical skills they would not have gotten otherwise.

The communes also had lasting negative effects. The experiences associated with communization and the Great Leap Forward created lasting traumas for whole communities and especially the women who were responsible for taking on additional labor and were often the first in a family to go hungry. Destruction of gravesites made it difficult for families to continue forms of ancestor worship that they had been practicing for centuries, even after the Great Leap ended. Some of the land reclamation and irrigation projects successfully made agricultural land more productive, but the top-down nature of the commune structure often meant that commune or brigade leadership determined these projects without consulting the commune members on whether these projects were useful to them. Moreover, some of the projects that communes undertook to make their land more productive, such as the use of pesticides and chemical experiments, could also have had deleterious long-term effects on the environment and the local population.

During the years between the end of the Great Leap Forward and decollectivization in the early 1980s, the PRC&#x27;s agricultural productivity, rural school enrollment, infant mortality rates, and life expectancy all improved. Collectivization of land via the commune system also facilitated China&#x27;s rapid industrialization through the state&#x27;s control of food production and procurement. This allowed the state to accelerate the process of capital accumulation, ultimately laying the successful foundation of physical and human capital for the economic growth of China&#x27;s reform and opening up.

<doc id="420125" wikidata="Q745388" url="?curid=420125" title="Luis Miguel Dominguín">
<text>Luis Miguel González Lucas (9 November 1926 – 8 May 1996), better known as Luis Miguel Dominguín, was a bullfighter from Spain and the son of the noteworthy bullfighter, Domingo Dominguín. Dominguín adopted his father&#x27;s name to gain popularity.

== Early career ==
Dominguín made his first public appearance in the ring at the age of eleven. He became a matador in 1941. He enjoyed popularity during the 1940s and 1950s in Spain, Portugal, Colombia and other countries. He was on the card in Linares, Spain, on 28 August 1947 when his rival Manolete was fatally gored.

Dominguín was a socialite, having friends like Pablo Picasso and romantic relationships with the American actress Ava Gardner and the fashion model China Machado.
In 1955 he married actress Lucia Bosè, who gave birth to his son Miguel Bosé, a Grammy award-winning singer.
He also occasionally appeared in films, predominantly playing himself in cameo roles, in movies such as &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956) and &quot;Testament of Orpheus&quot; (1960).
In 1959, he and his brother-in-law, Antonio Ordóñez, engaged in a bullfighting rivalry that was chronicled in Peter Viertel’s novel &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot;, and later in Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s posthumous book &quot;The Dangerous Summer&quot;.

==Later career==
In 1971, at the age of 44, Dominguín returned to the bullring. That year he retired again, but returned to the ring in 1971, aged 45, when he attempted to fathom the sport&#x27;s continuing allure. His comeback was at Las Palmas, the Canary Islands, when he wore the costume known as the &quot;suit of lights&quot;, which had been designed for him by Picasso. In his Telegraph obituary, it states that he killed two bulls and won one ear, but was overshadowed by younger men; however, the actress Deborah Kerr, who was in the crowd, is quoted as insisting, &quot;He is still the greatest bull-fighter&quot;.

==Marriages and relationships==

===Miroslava Sternova===
In 1953, Dominguín met Miroslava Sternova in Cuba. Dominguín was half a year her junior, so they parted as friends until they met again in the United States in 1954. She went on to work abroad in Spain to meet up with friends and Dominguín. After her return to Mexico, Sternova was found dead from an overdose. In one hand, she clutched three farewell notes; in the other, a photograph showing her with Dominguín and his mother. It is rumored that she took her own life over the marriage of Dominguín and Bosè.

===Ava Gardner===
By 1954, Dominguín&#x27;s friendship with Ava Gardner was being widely reported. He considered her the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, but liked her more, he said, for her humor and understanding; he confessed himself unsure what he looked for in women. He is quoted as saying, &quot;Men fall in love with a woman&#x27;s faults rather than her qualities.&quot;

Ava had been previously associated with other bullfighters, though still married at the time to Frank Sinatra. It was said that on their first night of lovemaking, he got out of bed and she asked: &quot;Where are you going?&quot;. &quot;To go tell!&quot;, replied the bullfighter. Years later, he admitted to a friend he made up that anecdote.

Subsequently Ava divorced Sinatra, and Luis Miguel saw his chance to establish a more stable relationship. He wanted to get married and have children, but this was not in the Hollywood actress&#x27;s plans. The relationship ended in September 1954. Years later, he was recalling with affection: &quot;She was the prettiest and the most fierce. I had a very fierce wolf in a cage.&quot;

===Lucia Bosè===
Italian actress and former Miss Italy, Lucia Bosè flew to Madrid to shoot the film &quot;Muerte de un ciclista&quot; (&quot;Death of a Cyclist&quot;).

At the airport, she met the producer, Manuel Goyanes, and Luis Miguel, who introduced him to the Italian actress. At first, she thought he was just a blowhard bully, but in the end he inspired interest and won her over. They still had not yet kissed when he asked her to marry him. They were married in Las Vegas on 1 March 1955.

Lucia has confessed that their first year of marriage was not idyllic: &quot;It was a very hard experience. I did not speak Spanish and I do not know anything, he did not speak Italian. I think that&#x27;s how the passion was born, because we did not understand each other. When I began to understand who he was and he who I was, the crisis began.&quot;

But the matador knew well how to compensate: &quot;It never ceased to amaze me the incalculable force of his sexual incontinence&quot;, said the actress. Shortly after marrying, she became pregnant and was forced to marry through the church in order to quell the scandals. The ceremony took place on 19 October 1955.

Dominguín returned to the bullfighting arenas abroad and their first son, singer Miguel Bosé, was born in Panama on 3 April 1956. Later in life, Dominguín was notoriously disapproving of Bosé&#x27;s homosexuality. Their second child, Lucia, born in 1957, and Paola, born in 1960.

Dominguín and Bosé were married for years, but their differences were accentuated over time, especially her lack of interest for the bulls. She never became part of the &quot;Dominguín&quot; clan, and the Dominguines never liked her. On the other hand, the infidelities of the bullfighter also took their toll. &quot;In a matter of horns, I was a gold medal&quot;, Lucia asserted. 

===Rosario Primo de Rivera===
Dominguín divorced Bosè in 1968, and in 1987 married Rosario Primo de Rivera, niece of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, Spanish far-right politician and founder of the Falange Española fascist political party. In 1971, at the age of 44, he returned to the bullring, and retired for good in 1973.

==Death==
Dominguín died of heart failure in 1996, aged 69. He is buried in the cemetery Guadiaro, near Sotogrande (Cádiz).

==Filmography==
*&quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956) as Bullfighter 
*&quot;Testament of Orpheus&quot; (1960) as Un ami d&#x27;Orphée / Orphée&#x27;s Friend (uncredited)

<doc id="420126" wikidata="Q342774" url="?curid=420126" title="Frankie Laine">
<text>Frankie Laine (born Francesco Paolo LoVecchio; March 30, 1913 – February 6, 2007) was an American singer and songwriter whose career spanned nearly 75 years, from his first concerts in 1930 with a marathon dance company to his final performance of &quot;That&#x27;s My Desire&quot; in 2005. Often billed as &quot;America&#x27;s Number One Song Stylist&quot;, his other nicknames include &quot;Mr. Rhythm&quot;, &quot;Old Leather Lungs&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Steel Tonsils&quot;. His hits included &quot;That&#x27;s My Desire&quot;, &quot;That Lucky Old Sun&quot;, &quot;Mule Train&quot;, &quot;Jezebel&quot;, &quot;High Noon&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot;, &quot;Hey Joe!&quot;, &quot;The Kid&#x27;s Last Fight&quot;, &quot;Cool Water&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, and &quot;You Gave Me a Mountain&quot;.

He sang well known theme songs for many Western film soundtracks, including &quot;3:10 To Yuma&quot;, &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot;, and &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, although his recordings were not charted as country and western. Laine sang an eclectic variety of song styles and genres, stretching from big band crooning to pop, western-themed songs, gospel, rock, folk, jazz, and blues. He did not sing the soundtrack song for &quot;High Noon&quot;, which was sung by Tex Ritter, but his own version (with somewhat altered lyrics, omitting the name of the antagonist, Frank Miller) was the one that became a bigger hit. He also did not sing the theme to another show he is commonly associated with—&quot;Champion the Wonder Horse&quot; (sung by Mike Stewart)—but released his own, subsequently more popular, version.

Laine&#x27;s enduring popularity was illustrated in June 2011 when a TV-advertised compilation called &quot;Hits&quot; reached No. 16 on the UK Albums Chart. The accomplishment was achieved nearly 60 years after his debut on the U.K. chart, 64 years after his first major U.S. hit and four years after his death.

==Early life==
Frankie Laine was born Francesco Paolo LoVecchio on March 30, 1913, to Giovanni and Crescenzia LoVecchio (née Salerno). His Cook County, Illinois, birth certificate (No. 14436) was already Americanized at the time of his birth, with his name written as &quot;Frank Lovecchio&quot;, his mother as &quot;Anna Salerno&quot;, and his father as &quot;John Lovecchio&quot;, with the &quot;V&quot; lower case in each instance, except in the &quot;Reported by&quot; section with &quot;John Lo Vecchio (father)&quot; written in. His parents had emigrated from Monreale, Sicily, to Chicago&#x27;s Near West Side, in &quot;Little Italy&quot;, where his father worked at one time as the personal barber for gangster Al Capone. Laine&#x27;s family appears to have had several organized crime connections, and young Francesco was living with his grandfather when the latter was killed by rival gangsters.

The eldest of eight children, Laine grew up in the Old Town neighborhood (first at 1446 N. North Park Avenue and later at 331 W. Schiller Street) and had his first taste of singing as a member of the choir in the Church of the Immaculate Conception&#x27;s elementary school across the street from the North Park Avenue home. He later attended Lane Technical High School, where he helped to develop his lung power and breath control by joining the track and field and basketball teams. He realized he wanted to be a singer when he missed time in school to see Al Jolson&#x27;s current talking picture, &quot;The Singing Fool&quot;. Jolson would later visit Laine when both were filming pictures in 1949, and, at about this time, Jolson remarked that Laine was going to put all the other singers out of business.

==Early career and stylistic influences==

Even in the 1920s, his vocal abilities were enough to get him noticed by a slightly older &quot;in crowd&quot; at his school, who began inviting him to parties and to local dance clubs, including Chicago&#x27;s Merry Garden Ballroom. At 17, he sang before a crowd of 5,000 at The Merry Garden Ballroom to such applause that he ended up performing five encores on his first night. Laine was giving dance lessons for a charity ball at the Merry Garden when he was called to the bandstand to sing:

Soon I found myself on the main bandstand before this enormous crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing &#x27;Beside an Open Fireplace,&#x27; a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn&#x27;t see the audience. I thought that the people didn&#x27;t like me.

Some of his other early influences during this period included Enrico Caruso, Carlo Buti, and especially Bessie Smith—a record of whose somehow wound up in his parents&#x27; collection:

I can still close my eyes and visualize its blue and purple label. It was a Bessie Smith recording of &#x27;The Bleeding Hearted Blues,&#x27; with &#x27;Midnight Blues&#x27; on the other side. The first time I laid the needle down on that record I felt cold chills and an indescribable excitement. It was my first exposure to jazz and the blues, although I had no idea at the time what to call those magical sounds. I just knew I had to hear more of them! — Frankie Laine
Another singer who influenced him at this time was the singer-songwriter Gene Austin, generally considered the first “crooner.” Laine worked after school at a drugstore that was situated across the street from a record store that continually played hit records by Austin over their loudspeakers. He would swab down the windows in time to Austin&#x27;s songs. Many years later, Laine related the story to Austin when both were guests on the popular television variety show &quot;Shower of Stars&quot;. He would also co-star in a film, &quot;Rainbow &#x27;Round My Shoulder&quot;, with Austin&#x27;s daughter, Charlotte.

Shortly after graduating from high school, Laine signed on as a member of The Merry Garden&#x27;s marathon dance company and toured with them, working dance marathons during the Great Depression (setting the world record of 3,501 hours with partner Ruthie Smith at Atlantic City&#x27;s Million Dollar Pier in 1932). Still billed as Frank LoVecchio, he would entertain the spectators during the fifteen-minute breaks the dancers were given each hour. During his marathon days, he worked with several up-and-coming entertainers, including Rose Marie, Red Skelton, and a 14-year-old Anita O&#x27;Day, for whom he served as a mentor (as noted by Laine in a 1998 interview by David Miller).

Other artists whose styles began to influence Laine at this time were Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong (as a trumpet player), Billie Holiday, Mildred Bailey, and, later, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole. Laine befriended Cole in Los Angeles, when the latter&#x27;s career was just beginning to gain momentum. Cole recorded a song, &quot;It Only Happens Once&quot;, that fledgling songwriter Laine had composed. They remained close friends throughout the remainder of Cole&#x27;s life, and Laine was one of the pallbearers at Cole&#x27;s funeral.

In 1937, he replaced Perry Como in the Freddy Carlone band in Cleveland; Como made a call to Carlone about Laine. Como was another lifelong friend of Laine&#x27;s, who once lent him the money to travel to a possible gig.

Laine&#x27;s rhythmic style was ill-suited to the sweet sounds of the Carlone band, and the two soon parted company. Success continued to elude Laine, and he spent the next 10 years &quot;scuffling&quot;: alternating between singing at small jazz clubs on both coasts and a series of jobs, including those of a bouncer, dance instructor, used car salesman, agent, synthetic leather factory worker, and machinist at a defense plant. It was while working at the defense plant during the Second World War that he first began writing songs (&quot;It Only Happens Once&quot; was written at the plant). Often homeless during his &quot;scuffling&quot; phases, he hit the lowest point of his career, when he was sleeping on a bench in Central Park.
I would sneak into hotel rooms and sleep on the floor. In fact, I was bodily thrown out of 11 different New York hotels. I stayed in YMCAs and with anyone who would let me flop. Eventually I was down to my last four cents, and my bed became a roughened wooden bench in Central Park. I used my four pennies to buy four tiny Baby Ruth candy bars and rationed myself to one a day. — Frankie Laine

He changed his professional name to Frankie Laine in 1938, upon receiving a job singing for the New York City radio station WINS. The program director, Jack Coombs, thought that &quot;LoVecchio&quot; was &quot;too foreign sounding, and too much of a mouthful for the studio announcers,&quot; so he Americanized it to &quot;Lane&quot;, an homage to his high school. He added the &quot;i&quot; to avoid confusion with a girl singer at the station who went by the name of Frances Lane. It was at this time that Laine got unknown singer Helen O&#x27;Connell her job with the Jimmy Dorsey band. WINS, deciding that they no longer needed a jazz singer, dropped him. With the help of bandleader Jean Goldkette, he got a job with a sustainer (non-sponsored) radio show at NBC. As he was about to start, Germany attacked Poland, and all sustainer broadcasts were pulled off the air in deference to the needs of the military.

Laine next found employment in a munitions plant, at a salary of $150.00 a week. He quit singing for what was perhaps the fifth or sixth time of his already long career. While working at the plant, he met a trio of girl singers, and became engaged to the lead singer. The group had been noticed by Johnny Mercer&#x27;s Capitol Records, and convinced Laine to head out to Hollywood with them as their agent.

In 1943, he moved to California, where he sang in the background of several films, including &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot;, and dubbed the singing voice for an actor in the Danny Kaye comedy &quot;The Kid from Brooklyn&quot;. It was in Los Angeles in 1944 that he met and befriended disc jockey Al Jarvis and composer/pianist Carl T. Fischer, the latter of whom was to be his songwriting partner, musical director, and piano accompanist until his death in 1954. Their songwriting collaborations included &quot;I&#x27;d Give My Life,&quot; &quot;Baby, Just For Me,&quot; &quot;What Could Be Sweeter?,&quot; &quot;Forever More,&quot; and the jazz standard &quot;We&#x27;ll Be Together Again.&quot;

When the war ended, Laine soon found himself &quot;scuffling&quot; again, and was eventually given a place to stay by Jarvis. Jarvis also did his best to help promote the struggling singer&#x27;s career, and Laine soon had a small, regional following. In the meantime, Laine would make the rounds of the bigger jazz clubs, hoping that the featured band would call him up to perform a number with them. In late 1946, Hoagy Carmichael heard him singing at Billy Berg&#x27;s club in Los Angeles, and this was when success finally arrived. Not knowing that Carmichael was in the audience, Laine sang the Carmichael-penned standard &quot;Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot; when Slim Gaillard called him up to the stage to sing. This eventually led to a contract with the newly established Mercury records. Laine and Carmichael would later collaborate on a song, &quot;Put Yourself in My Place, Baby&quot;.

==First recordings==
Laine cut his first record in 1944, for a fledgling company called &quot;Bel-Tone Records.&quot; The sides were called &quot;In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning&quot;, (an uptempo number not to be confused with the Frank Sinatra recording of the same name) and a wartime propaganda tune entitled &quot;Brother, That&#x27;s Liberty&quot;, though the records failed to make much of an impression. The label soon folded, and Laine was picked up by Atlas Records, a &quot;race label&quot; that initially hired him to imitate his friend Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole. Cole would occasionally &quot;moonlight&quot; for other labels, under pseudonyms, while under contract to Capitol, and as he had previously recorded some sides for Atlas, they reasoned that fans would assume that &quot;Frankie Laine&quot; was yet another pseudonym for &quot;Cole&quot;.

Laine cut his first two numbers for Atlas in the King mode, backed by R&amp;B artist Johnny Moore&#x27;s group, The Three Blazers which featured Charles Brown and Cole&#x27;s guitarist (from &quot;The King Cole Trio&quot;), Oscar Moore. The ruse worked and the record sold moderately well, although limited to the &quot;race&quot; market. Laine cut the remainder of his songs for Atlas in his own style, including standards such as &quot;Roses of Picardy&quot; and &quot;Moonlight in Vermont&quot;.

It was also at this time that he recorded a single for Mercury Records: &quot;Pickle in the Middle with the Mustard on Top&quot; and &quot;I May Be Wrong (But I Think You&#x27;re Wonderful).&quot; He appears only as a character actor on the first side, which features the comedic singing of Artie Auerbach (a.k.a., &quot;Mr. Kitzel&quot;) who was a featured player on the Jack Benny radio show. In it, Laine plays a peanut vendor at a ball game and can be heard shouting out lines like &quot;It&#x27;s a munchy, crunchy bag of lunchy!&quot; The flip side features Laine, and is a jazzy version of an old standard done as a rhythm number. It was played by Laine&#x27;s friend, disc jockey Al Jarvis, and gained the singer a small West Coast following.

==First successes==
Even after his discovery by Carmichael, Laine still was considered only an intermission act at Billy Berg&#x27;s. He reached his first independent success when he dusted off a fifteen-year-old song that few people remembered in 1946, &quot;That&#x27;s My Desire&quot;. Laine had picked up the song from singer June Hart a half a dozen years earlier, when he sang at the College Inn in Cleveland. He introduced &quot;Desire&quot; as a &quot;new&quot; song—meaning new to his repertoire at Berg&#x27;s—but the audience mistook it for a new song that had just been written. He ended up singing it five times that night. After that, Laine quickly became the star attraction at Berg&#x27;s, and record company executives took note.

Laine soon had patrons lining up to hear him sing &quot;Desire&quot;; among them was R&amp;B artist Hadda Brooks, known for her boogie woogie piano playing. She listened to him every night, and eventually cut her own version of the song, which became a hit on the &quot;harlem&quot; charts. &quot;I liked the way he did it&quot; Brooks recalled; &quot;he sings with soul, he sings the way he feels.&quot;

He was soon recording for the fledgling Mercury label, and &quot;That&#x27;s My Desire&quot; was one of the songs cut in his first recording session there. It quickly took the No. 3 spot on the R&amp;B chart, and listeners initially thought Laine was black.

The record also made it to the No. 4 spot on the mainstream chart. Although it was quickly covered by many other artists, including Sammy Kaye who took it to the No. 2 spot, it was Laine&#x27;s version that became the standard.

&quot;Desire&quot; became Laine&#x27;s first gold record having sold over one million copies, and established him in the music world. He had been over $7,000 in debt, on the day before he recorded this song.&quot; His first paycheck for royalties was over five times this amount. Laine paid off all of his debts except one—fellow singer Perry Como refused to let Laine pay him back, and would kid him about the money owed for years to come. The loan to Laine during the time when both men were still struggling singers was one of the few secrets Como kept from his wife, Roselle, who learned of it many years later. A series of hit singles quickly followed, including &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, &quot;Mam&#x27;selle&quot;, &quot;Two Loves Have I&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot;, &quot;Monday Again&quot;, and many others.

==Style==
Originally a rhythm and blues-influenced jazz singer, Laine later branched out into a number of a genres, including popular standards, gospel, folk, country, western/Americana, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, and the occasional novelty number. He was also known as Mr. Rhythm for his driving jazzy style.

Laine was part of a new breed of singers who rose to prominence in the post–World War II era. This new, raw, emotionally charged style seemed at the time to signal the end of the previous era&#x27;s singing styles and was, indeed, a harbinger of the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music that was to come. As music historian Jonny Whiteside wrote:In the Hollywood clubs, a new breed of performers laid down a baffling hip array of new sounds...Most important of all these, though, was Frankie Laine, a big lad with &#x27;steel tonsils&#x27; who belted out torch blues while stomping his size twelve foot in joints like Billy Berg&#x27;s, Club Hangover and the Bandbox...Laine&#x27;s intense vocal style owed nothing to Crosby, Sinatra, or Dick Haymes. Instead he drew from Billy Eckstine, Big Joe Turner, Jimmy Rushing, and with it Laine had sown the seeds from which an entire new perception and audience would grow...Frank Sinatra represented perhaps the highest flowering of a quarter century tradition of crooning but suddenly found himself an anachronism. First Frankie Laine, then Tony Bennett, and now Johnnie (Ray), dubbed &#x27;the Belters&#x27; and &#x27;the Exciters,&#x27; came along with a brash vibrancy and vulgar beat that made the old bandstand routine which Frank meticulously perfected seem almost invalid.

In the words of Jazz critic Richard Grudens:

Frank&#x27;s style was very innovative, which was why he had such difficulty with early acceptance. He would bend notes and sing about the chordal context of a note rather than to sing the note directly, and he stressed each rhythmic downbeat, which was different from the smooth balladeer of his time.

His 1946 recording of &quot;That&#x27;s My Desire&quot; remains a landmark record signaling the end of both the dominance of the big bands and the crooning styles favored by contemporary Dick Haymes and others. Often called the first of the blue-eyed soul singers, Laine&#x27;s style cleared the way for many artists who arose in the late 1940s and early 1950s, including Kay Starr, Tony Bennett, and Johnnie Ray.

I think that Frank probably was one of the forerunner of...blues, of...rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. A lot of singers who sing with a passionate demeanor—Frank was and is definitely that. I always used to love to mimic him with &#x27;That&#x27;s...my...desire.&#x27; And then later Johnnie Ray came along that made all of those kind of movements, but Frank had already done them. – Patti Page

Throughout the 1950s, Laine enjoyed a second career singing the title songs over the opening credits of Hollywood films and television shows, including &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot;, &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot;, &quot;Bullwhip&quot;, and &quot;Rawhide&quot;. His rendition of the title song for Mel Brooks&#x27;s 1974 hit movie &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; won an Oscar nomination for Best Song, and on television, Laine&#x27;s featured recording of &quot;Rawhide&quot; for the series of the same name became a popular theme song.

You can&#x27;t categorize him. He&#x27;s one of those singers that&#x27;s not in one track. And yet and still I think that his records had more excitement and life into it. And I think that was his big selling point, that he was so full of energy. You know when you hear his records it was dynamite energy. — Herb Jeffries
==Late 1940s to early 1950s==
Laine was a jazz singer in the late 1940s. Accompanied by Carl Fischer and some of the best jazz men in the business, he was singing standards like &quot;By the River Sainte Marie&quot;, &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot;, &quot;West End Blues&quot;, &quot;At the End of the Road&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Just Like a Woman&quot;, &quot;That Ain&#x27;t Right&quot;, &quot;Exactly Like You&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot; and &quot;Sleepy Ol&#x27; River&quot; on the Mercury label.

He enjoyed his greatest success after impresario Mitch Miller, who became the A&amp;R man at Mercury in 1948, recognized a universal quality in his voice that led to a succession of chart-topping popular songs, often with a folk or western flavor. Laine and Miller became a formidable hit-making team whose first collaboration, &quot;That Lucky Old Sun&quot;, became the number one song in the country three weeks after its release. It was also Laine&#x27;s fifth Gold record. &quot;That Lucky Old Sun&quot; was something new to the musical scene in 1949: a folk spiritual which, as interpreted by Laine, became both an affirmation of faith and a working man&#x27;s wish to bring his earthly sufferings to an end.

The song was knocked down to the number two position by Laine and Miller&#x27;s second collaboration, &quot;Mule Train&quot;, which proved an even bigger hit, making Laine the first artist to hold the Number One and Two positions simultaneously. &quot;Mule Train&quot;, with its whip cracks and echo, has been cited as the first song to use an &quot;aural texture&quot; that &quot;set the pattern for virtually the entire first decade of rock.&quot;

&quot;Mule Train&quot; represents a second direction in which Laine&#x27;s music would be simultaneously heading under the guidance of Mitch Miller: as the voice of the great outdoors and the American West. &quot;Mule Train&quot; is a slice of life in the mid-19th century West in which the contents of the packages being delivered by the mule train provide a snapshot into frontier life: &quot;There&#x27;s some cotton, thread and needles for the folks a-way up yonder/A shovel for a miner who left his home to wander/Some rheumatism pills for the settlers in the hills.&quot;

The collaboration producing a run of top forty hits that lasted into the early years of the rock and roll era. Other hits included &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot;, &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;, &quot;The Cry of the Wild Goose&quot;, &quot;Swamp Girl&quot;, &quot;Satan Wears a Satin Gown&quot;, and &quot;Music, Maestro Please&quot;.

&quot;Shine&quot;, written in 1910 by Cecil Mack (R.C. McPherson), a ground-breaking African-American songwriter and publisher, was believed to be based on a real-life friend of vaudevillian George Walker, who was with him during the New York City race riots of 1900. The song takes what was then an ethnic slur, &quot;shine&quot;, and turns it into something to be proud of. It had been a hit for Laine&#x27;s idol Louis Armstrong, who would cover several of Laine&#x27;s hits as well.

&quot;Satan Wears a Satin Gown&quot; is the prototype of another recurring motif in Laine&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot;, the &quot;Lorelei&quot; or &quot;Jezebel&quot; song (both of which would be the titles of later Laine records). The song, which has a loosely structured melody that switches in tone and rhythm throughout, was pitched to Laine by a young song plugger, Tony Benedetto, who would later go on to achieve success as Tony Bennett. Laine recognized the younger singer&#x27;s talent, and gave him encouragement.
&quot;Swamp Girl&quot; is another entry with the &quot;Lorelei&quot;/&quot;Jezebel&quot; motif in the Laine songbook. In this decidedly gothic tale of a ghostly female spirit who inhabits a metaphorical &quot;swamp&quot;, the &quot;femme fatale&quot; attempts to lure the singer to his death, calling &quot;Come to the deep where your sleep is without a dream.&quot; The swamp girl is voiced (in an obligato) by coloratura Loulie Jean Norman, who would later go on to provide a similar vocal for the theme song of the television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The coloratura contrasts well with Laine&#x27;s rough, masculine voice, and disembodied female voices would continue to appear in the background of many of his records, to great effect.

&quot;The Cry of the Wild Goose&quot; would be Laine&#x27;s last number one hit on the American charts. It was written by folksinger Terry Gilkyson, of The Easy Riders fame. Gilkyson would write many more songs for Laine over the next decade, and he and The Easy Riders would back him on the hit single, &quot;Love Is a Golden Ring&quot;. &quot;The Cry of the Wild Goose&quot; falls into the &quot;voice of the great outdoors&quot; category of Laine songs, with the opening line of its chorus, &quot;My heart knows what the wild goose knows&quot;, becoming a part of the American lexicon.

Laine&#x27;s influence on today&#x27;s music can be clearly evidenced in his rendition of the Hoagy Carmichael standard, &quot;Georgia on My Mind.&quot; Laine&#x27;s slow, soulful version was a model for the iconic remake by Ray Charles a decade later. Charles would follow up &quot;Georgia&quot; with remakes of other Frankie Laine hits, including &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot;, and &quot;That Lucky Old Sun.&quot; (Elvis Presley also remade several of Laine&#x27;s hits, and his early influence on The Beatles has been well documented.)

In an interview, Mitch Miller described the basis of Laine&#x27;s appeal:

He was my kind of guy. He was very dramatic in his singing...and you must remember that in those days there were no videos so you had to depend on the image that the record made in the listener&#x27;s ears. And that&#x27;s why many fine artists were not good record sellers. For instance, Lena Horne. Fabulous artist but she never sold many records till that last album of hers. But she would always sell out the house no matter where she was. And there were others who sold a lot of records but couldn&#x27;t get to first base in personal appearances, but Frankie had it both. — Mitch Miller

But the biggest label of all was Columbia Records, and in 1950 Mitch Miller left Mercury to embark upon his phenomenally successful career as the A&amp;R man there. Laine&#x27;s contract at Mercury would be up for renewal the following year, and Miller soon brought Laine to Columbia as well. Laine&#x27;s contract with Columbia was the most lucrative in the industry until RCA bought Elvis Presley&#x27;s contract five years later.

==Starring with Columbia==
Laine began recording for Columbia Records in 1951, where he immediately scored a double-sided hit with the single &quot;Jezebel&quot; (#2)/&quot;Rose, Rose, I Love You&quot; (#3). Other Laine hits from this period include &quot;High Noon (Do Not Forsake Me)&quot; (#5), &quot;Jealousy (Jalousie)&quot; (#3), &quot;The Girl in the Wood&quot; (#23), &quot;When You&#x27;re in Love&quot; (#30), &quot;Way Down Yonder in New Orleans&quot; (with Jo Stafford) (#26), &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot; (#18), &quot;Granada&quot; (#17), &quot;Hey Joe!&quot; (#6), &quot;The Kid&#x27;s Last Fight&quot; (#20), &quot;Cool Water&quot;, &quot;Some Day&quot; (#14), &quot;A Woman in Love&quot; (#19), &quot;Love Is a Golden Ring&quot; (with The Easy Riders) (#10), and &quot;Moonlight Gambler&quot; (#3).

One of the signature songs of the early 1950s, &quot;Jezebel&quot; takes the &quot;Lorelei&quot; motif to its end, with Laine shouting &quot;Jezebel!&quot; at the woman who has destroyed him. In Laine&#x27;s words, the song uses &quot;flamenco rhythms to whip up an atmosphere of sexual frustration and hatred while a guy berated the woman who&#x27;d done him wrong.&quot;

&quot;High Noon&quot; was the theme song from the western motion picture starring Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly. It had been sung by cowboy star Tex Ritter in the film, but it was Laine&#x27;s recording that became the big hit. From this point on, Laine would sing the theme songs over the opening credits of many Hollywood and television westerns, becoming so identified with these title songs that Mel Brooks would hire him to sing the theme song for his classic cult film western spoof &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;.

At this time, Laine had become more popular in the United Kingdom than in the US, as many of his hit records in the UK were only minor hits in his native country. Songs like &quot;The Gandy Dancer&#x27;s Ball&quot;, &quot;The Rock of Gibraltar&quot;, and &quot;Answer Me, O Lord&quot; were much bigger hits for him abroad. &quot;Answer Me&quot; would later provide the inspiration for Paul McCartney&#x27;s composition &quot;Yesterday&quot;. It was also there that he broke attendance records when appearing at the Palladium, where he launched his first successful television series (with singer Connie Haines).

Mitch Miller teamed Laine with many of Mercury and Columbia&#x27;s biggest artists. He scored hits with Patti Page (&quot;I Love You for That&quot;) at Mercury, Doris Day (&quot;Sugarbush&quot;), Jo Stafford (&quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Gambella (The Gambling Lady)&quot;, &quot;Hambone&quot;, &quot;Floatin&#x27; Down to Cotton Town&quot;, &quot;Settin&#x27; the Woods on Fire&quot;, and many others), Jimmy Boyd (&quot;Tell Me a Story&quot;, &quot;The Little Boy and the Old Man&quot;), the Four Lads (&quot;Rain, Rain, Rain&quot;) and Johnnie Ray (&quot;Up Above My Head (I Hear Music in the Air)&quot;).

Laine scored a total of 39 hit records on the charts while at Columbia, and many of his songs from this period are most readily associated with him. His &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, released in 1957, has been a perennial best seller that has never gone out of print. His songs at Columbia included everything from pop and jazz standards, novelties, gospel, spirituals, R&amp;B numbers, country, western, folk, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, calypso, foreign language, children&#x27;s music, film and television themes, tangos, light operetta. His vocal style could range anywhere from shouting out lines to rhythm numbers to romantic ballads.

Both in collaboration with Jo Stafford and as a solo artist, Laine was one of the earliest, and most frequent, Columbia artists to bring country numbers into the mainstream. Late in his career, Laine would go on to record two straight country albums (&quot;A Country Laine&quot; and &quot;The Nashville Connection&quot;) that would fully demonstrate his ability to inflect multiple levels of emotional nuances into a line or word. Many of his pop-country hits from the early 1950s featured the steel guitar playing of Speedy West (who played a custom-built, three-neck, four-pedal model).

His duets with Doris Day were folk-pop adaptations of traditional South African folk songs, translated by folk singer Josef Marais. Marais would also provide Laine and Jo Stafford with a similar translation of a song which Stafford seems to have particularly disliked called &quot;Chow Willy&quot;. Although &quot;Sugarbush&quot; brought Laine &amp; Day a gold record, they would never team up again.

In 1953 he set two more records (this time on the UK charts): weeks at No 1 for a song (&quot;I Believe&quot;, which held the number one spot for 18 weeks), and weeks at No 1 for an artist in a single year (27 weeks), when &quot;Hey Joe!&quot; and &quot;Answer Me, O Lord&quot; became number one hits as well). In spite of the popularity of rock and roll artists such as Elvis Presley and The Beatles, fifty-plus years later, both of Laine&#x27;s records still hold.

In 1954, Laine gave a Royal Command Performance for Queen Elizabeth II which he cites as one of the highlights of his career. By the end of the decade, he remained far ahead of Elvis Presley as the most successful artist on the British charts. &quot;I Believe&quot; is listed as the second most popular song of all time on the British charts as well.

&quot;I Believe&quot; marked yet another direction for Laine&#x27;s music, that of the spiritual. A devout Roman Catholic from childhood, Laine would continue to record songs of faith and inspiration throughout his career; beginning with his rocking gospel album with the Four Lads, which, along with the hit song &quot;Rain, Rain, Rain&quot;, included renditions of such songs as &quot;Remember Me&quot;, &quot;Didn&#x27;t He Moan&quot;, &quot;I Feel Like My Time Ain&#x27;t Long&quot;, and &quot;I Hear the Angels Singing.&quot; Other Laine spirituals would include &quot;My Friend&quot;, &quot;In the Beginning&quot;, &quot;Make Me a Child Again&quot;, &quot;My God and I&quot;, and &quot;Hey! Hey! Jesus.&quot;

===Mr. Rhythm===

In 1953, Laine recorded his first long playing album that was released, domestically, solely as an album (prior to this his albums had been compiled from previously released singles). The album was titled &quot;Mr. Rhythm&quot;, as Laine was often known at that time, and featured many jazz-flavored, rhythm numbers similar in style to his work on the Mercury label. The album&#x27;s songlist was made up of &quot;Great American Songbook&quot; standards. The tracks were &quot;Some Day, Sweetheart&quot;, &quot;A Hundred Years from Today&quot;, &quot;Laughing at Life&quot;, &quot;Lullaby in Rhythm&quot;, &quot;Willow, Weep for Me&quot;, &quot;My Ohio Home&quot;, &quot;Judy&quot; and &quot;After You&#x27;ve Gone.&quot; The final number features a rare vocal duet with his accompanist/musical director, Carl Fischer. Paul Weston&#x27;s orchestra provided the music.

===Portrait of New Orleans===

Released as a 10&quot; in 1953, and a 12&quot; in 1954, this album features the talents of Laine, Jo Stafford and bandleader Paul Weston, a Tommy Dorsey alumnus who led one of the top bands of the 1950s, and was the husband of Stafford. The album was a mix of solo recordings and duets by the two stars, and of new and previously released material, including Stafford&#x27;s hits single, &quot;Make Love to Me&quot;, &quot;Shrimp Boats&quot;, and &quot;Jambalaya.&quot; Laine and Stafford duetted on &quot;Way Down Yonder in New Orleans&quot;, &quot;Floatin&#x27; Down to Cotton Town&quot;, and &quot;Basin Street Blues&quot;; and Laine soloed on &quot;New Orleans&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;New Orleans&quot; a.k.a. &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; which Laine later recorded), &quot;Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?&quot;, and &quot;When It&#x27;s Sleepy Time Down South&quot;, along with a pair of cuts taken from his &quot;Mr. Rhythm&quot; album.

===Jazz Spectacular===

This album featured not only jazz vocals by Laine, but jazz licks on trumpet by a former featured player in the Count Basie orchestra, Buck Clayton, and trombonists J. J. Johnson and Kai Winding, and piano by Sir Charles Thompson. The tracks included several songs that had long been a standard part of the Laine repertoire over the years: &quot;Sposin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Baby, Baby, All the Time&quot;, and &quot;Roses of Picardy&quot; along with standards such as &quot;Stars Fell on Alabama&quot;, &quot;That Old Feeling&quot;, and &quot;Taking a Chance on Love&quot;. The album proved popular with jazz and popular music fans, and was often cited by Laine as his personal favorite. An improvised tone is apparent throughout, with Laine at one point reminiscing with one of the musicians about the days they performed together at Billy Berg&#x27;s.

===Frankie Laine and the Four Lads===

The Four Lads (Bernie Toorish, Jimmy Arnold, Frank Busseri and Connie Codarini) were a Canadian-based group, who first gained fame as the backup singer on Johnnie Ray&#x27;s early chart-busters (&quot;Cry&quot;, &quot;The Little White Cloud that Cried&quot;), but garnered a following of their own with songs such as &quot;The Mocking Bird&quot;, and &quot;Istanbul (Not Constantinople)&quot;. The album produced one hit, &quot;Rain! Rain! Rain!&quot;, along with tracks such as &quot;Remember Me&quot;, &quot;I Feel That My Time Ain&#x27;t Long&quot;, and &quot;Didn&#x27;t He Moan&quot;. The last four tracks were recorded during a later session.

===Rockin&#x27;===

One of Laine&#x27;s most popular albums, this album reset several of his former hits in a driving, brassy orchestration by Paul Weston and his orchestra. Two of the remakes (&quot;That Lucky Old Sun&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;ll Be Together Again&quot;) have gone on to become the best-known versions of the songs (supplanting the original hit versions). Other songs on this album include: &quot;Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot;, &quot;By the River Sainte Marie&quot;, &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, &quot;Blue Turning Grey Over You&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot;, and &quot;West End Blues&quot;. The album&#x27;s title is less a reference to rock and roll than a reference to the Duke Ellington song of that same name. Unlike Mitch Miller, Laine liked the new musical form known as &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, and was anxious to try his hand at it.

===With Michel Legrand===

French composer/arranger Michel Legrand teamed up with Laine to record a pair of albums in 1958. The first, &quot;A Foreign Affair&quot;, was built around the concept of recording the tracks in different languages: English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. The album produced a pair of international hits: &quot;La Paloma&quot; in Argentina, and &quot;Não tem solucão&quot; in Brazil. Other tracks included &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, &quot;Mam&#x27;selle&quot;, &quot;Torna a Sorriento&quot;, &quot;Besame Mucho&quot;, and &quot;Autumn Leaves.&quot;

Laine and Legrand teamed up for a second album of jazz standards, titled &quot;Reunion in Rhythm&quot;, with the vocals limiting themselves to English (and an occasional segue into French). Laine sang the complete lyrics (including the rarely reprised introductions) to such favorites as &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, &quot;Lover, Come Back to Me&quot;, &quot;Marie&quot;, &quot;September in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; &quot;I Would Do Most Anything for You&quot;, &quot;Too Marvelous for Words&quot;, and &quot;I Forget the Time&quot;. André Previn was the studio pianist on &quot;I&#x27;m Confessin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Baby Just For Me,&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re Just The Kind,&quot; and &quot;I Forget The Time.&quot;

===With Frank Comstock===

Laine wrote the lyrics for the title song on another 1958 album, &quot;Torchin″&quot;, which was also his first recorded in stereo. He was backed by trombonist Frank Comstock&#x27;s orchestra, on a dozen classic torch songs including: &quot;A Cottage for Sale&quot;, &quot;I Cover the Waterfront&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Changed&quot;, &quot;These Foolish Things&quot;, &quot;I Got it Bad (And That Ain&#x27;t Good)&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s the Talk of the Town&quot;, and &quot;Body and Soul&quot;. As with his Legrand album, he sings the entire lyric for each song.

A second collaboration with Comstock, also recorded in 1958, focused on intimacy. Conceived as a love letter to his second wife, actress Nan Grey (who appears on the cover with him), &quot;You Are My Love&quot; is easily Laine&#x27;s most romantic work. His voice was once described (by a British disk jockey) as having &quot;the virility of a goat and the delicacy of a flower petal,&quot; and both these elements are well showcased here (particularly the delicate nuances). His recording of the wedding standard, &quot;Because&quot;, exemplifies the singer&#x27;s delicate mode at its most exquisite. He opens the song a cappella, after which a classical, acoustic guitar joins him, with the full orchestra gradually fading in and out before the guitar only climax. Also among the love ballads on this album are versions of: &quot;I Married an Angel&quot;, &quot;To My Wife&quot;, &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot;, &quot;Side by Side&quot;, and a version of &quot;The Touch of Your Lips&quot;.

===Balladeer===

Recorded in 1959, &quot;Balladeer&quot; was a folk-blues album. Laine had helped pioneer the folk music movement a full ten years earlier with his hit folk-pop records penned by Terry Gilkyson &quot;et al.&quot;. This album was orchestrated and arranged by Fred Katz (who had brought Laine &quot;Satan Wears a Satin Gown&quot;) and Frank DeVol. Laine and Katz collaborated on some of the new material, along with Lucy Drucker (who apparently inspired the &quot;Lucy D&quot; in one of the songs). Other songs are by folk, country and blues artists such as Brownie McGhee, James A. Bland, Huddie &quot;Leadbelly&quot; Ledbetter, and Hungarian composer Rudolf Friml. The closing track, &quot;And Doesn&#x27;t She Roll&quot; (co-written by Laine), with its rhythmic counter-chorus in the background foretells Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Graceland&quot; album two decades later.

Included are renditions of &quot;Rocks and Gravel&quot;, &quot;Careless Love&quot;, &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;, &quot;The Jelly Coal Man&quot;, &quot;On a Monday&quot;, &quot;Lucy D&quot; (a melody that sounds like the later Simon &amp; Garfunkel hit, &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;, but depicts the murder of a beautiful young woman by her unrequited lover), &quot;Carry Me Back to Old Virginny&quot;, &quot;Stack of Blues&quot;, &quot;Old Blue&quot;, &quot;Cherry Red&quot;, and &quot;New Orleans&quot; (better known as &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;), which would become a hit for the British rock group, The Animals a few years later.

===John Williams arrangements===
Laine&#x27;s last four albums at Columbia, &quot;Hell Bent for Leather!&quot;, &quot;Deuces Wild&quot;, &quot;Call of the Wild&quot;, and &quot;Wanderlust&quot;. were arranged by a young John Williams. Williams recently said the following words about Laine:

Frankie Laine was somebody that everybody knew. He was a kind of a household word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine was one of the great popular singers and stylists of that time...And his style...he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did. You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.
===Hell Bent for Leather!===

This album of western classics by Laine established him as &quot;a cowboy singer&quot; for many young fans who grew up in the 1960s. The album&#x27;s title is taken from a line in the popular television theme song Laine recorded for the popular Eric Fleming/Clint Eastwood western, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, which appears on the album. The tracks include stereo remakes of several of his biggest western/great outdoors hits: &quot;The Cry of the Wild Goose&quot;, &quot;Mule Train&quot;, &quot;Gunfight at O.K. Corral&quot;, and &quot;The 3:10 to Yuma&quot;, as well as new material, including the western rocker, &quot;Wanted Man&quot;, and a musical narrative, &quot;Bowie Knife&quot;.

===Deuces Wild===

Laine&#x27;s next album continued with the western theme (on several of the numbers), while following up on his last hit single, &quot;Moonlight Gambler&quot; (a stereo remake of which appears on the album). Most of the tracks of this album feature a gambling theme. &quot;The Hard Way&quot; is a story about a hard-luck case who is killed by a cannonball while fighting in the Civil War (for the Confederacy), only to wind up eternally shoveling coal in Hell. The second track is Stephen Foster&#x27;s &quot;Camptown Races&quot; Other songs on this album include: &quot;Luck Be a Lady&quot; (from the hit musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;), which Laine performed in an Off Broadway, touring company version of &quot;Get Rich Quick&quot;; &quot;Horses and Women&quot; (which Laine may have supplied the lyrics to); &quot;Deuces Wild&quot;, for which Laine provided the lyrics, and &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Hand.&quot;

===Call of the Wild===

This album continued to play up Chicago-born Laine&#x27;s western image with songs such as &quot;On the Trail&quot;, based on the composition by Ferde Grofé, and &quot;Tumbling Tumbleweeds&quot;, written by one of the founding members of The Sons of the Pioneers&quot;, Bob Nolan. The majority of its tracks focus more, however, on &quot;the great outdoors&quot;, with titles such as: &quot;Song of the Open Road&quot;, &quot;North to Alaska&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Blue Horizon&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;The New Frontier&quot;, which appears to show Laine&#x27;s support of President John F. Kennedy. The arrangements on many of these songs have an almost classical feel to them, reflecting the classical training of John Williams, who would go on to conduct the Boston Pops for many years.

===Wanderlust===

&quot;Wanderlust&quot; was Laine&#x27;s final album with Columbia Records. &quot;De Glory Road&quot; is one of both Laine&#x27;s personal favorites. Other songs on this album include (Ghost) &quot;Riders in the Sky&quot; and a swinging version of Sigmund Romberg&#x27;s Serenade, from the operetta, &quot;The Student Prince&quot;. Also included on this album is a version of &quot;I Let Her Go&quot;; an uncensored version of a song that figured prominently in his nightclub act, &quot;On the Road to Mandalay&quot;, based on the poem by Rudyard Kipling; and a classic version of &quot;Wagon Wheels&quot; which he&#x27;d been singing (though not recording) as far back as his days with the Merry Garden Ballroom marathon dance company in the early 1930s.

Laine had met with Columbia officials to renew his contract on the day that John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The meeting was canceled, and neither Laine nor Columbia pressed to reschedule it.

==At Capitol, ABC, and beyond==
In 1963 Laine left Columbia for Capitol Records, but during his two years there only produced one album and a handful of singles (mostly of an inspirational nature). He continued performing regularly at this time, including a South African tour.

After switching to ABC Records in the late 1960s, Laine found himself at the top of the charts again, beginning with the first song he recorded, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Care of Your Cares&quot;. Written as a waltz in the mid-1920s, &quot;Cares&quot; had become the unofficial theme song of the Las Vegas call girls, but was virtually unknown outside of the Strip. Laine recorded a swinging version that made it to number 39 on the national and number 2 on the adult contemporary charts. A string of hits followed including &quot;Making Memories&quot;, &quot;You Wanted Someone to Play With&quot;, &quot;Laura (What&#x27;s He Got That I Ain&#x27;t Got)&quot;, &quot;To Each His Own&quot;, &quot;I Found You&quot;, and &quot;Lord, You Gave Me A Mountain&quot; (which was written by Marty Robbins). The last song was a number one hit on the adult contemporary chart (#24 national), and proved that Laine was as big a hit-maker as ever. His last single to hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart (peaking at No. 86 national) was &quot;Dammit Isn&#x27;t God&#x27;s Last Name&quot;.

Seeking greater artistic freedom, Laine left ABC for the much smaller Amos Records, where he cut two albums in a modern, rock-influenced vein. The first album contained contemporary versions of his greatest hits, such as &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot;, &quot;That Lucky Old Sun&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot;, &quot;Jezebel&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot;, and &quot;Moonlight Gambler.&quot; A re-recorded single of &quot;On The Sunny Side Of The Street&quot; reached the Cashbox &quot;Looking Ahead&quot; chart in 1970. His second album for Amos was called &quot;A Brand New Day&quot; and, along with the title song, was original material including &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;, &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, &quot;Put Your Hand in the Hand&quot;, &quot;My God and I&quot;, and &quot;Talk About the Good Times&quot;. It is one of Frankie Laine&#x27;s personal favorites.

Amos, which was soon to fold from lack of funds, could not adequately promote them at the time. However, they are still available through CD re-releases. After Amos folded, Laine started his own label, Score Records, which is still producing albums today.

==Film and television==
Beginning in the late 1940s, Laine starred in over a half dozen backstage musicals, often playing himself; several of these were written and directed by a young Blake Edwards. The films were: &quot;Make Believe Ballroom&quot; – Columbia, 1949; &quot;When You&#x27;re Smiling&quot; – Columbia, 1950; &quot;Sunny Side Of The Street&quot; – Columbia, 1951; &quot;Rainbow &#x27;Round My Shoulder&quot; – Columbia, 1952; &quot;Bring Your Smile Along&quot; – Columbia, 1955; &quot;He Laughed Last&quot; – Columbia, 1956; and &quot;Meet Me in Las Vegas&quot; – MGM, 1956. The latter, a big budget MGM musical starring Cyd Charisse, features Laine performing &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot;.

Laine&#x27;s films were very popular in the United Kingdom, but this success failed to establish him as a movie star in the United States.

On television, he hosted three variety shows: &quot;The Frankie Laine Hour&quot; in 1950, &quot;The Frankie Laine Show&quot; (with Connie Haines) 1954–55, and &quot;Frankie Laine Time&quot; in 1955–56. The latter was a summer replacement for &quot;The Arthur Godfrey Show&quot; that received a Primetime Emmy for Best Male Singer. &quot;Frankie Laine Time&quot; featured such guest stars as Ella Fitzgerald, Johnnie Ray, Georgia Gibbs, The Four Lads, Cab Calloway, Patti Page, Eddie Heywood, Duke Ellington, Boris Karloff, Patti Andrews, Joni James, Shirley MacLaine, Gene Krupa, Teresa Brewer, Jack Teagarden and Polly Bergen.

He had a different sound, you know and he had such emotion and heart. And of course you recognized Frankie, just like Sinatra had that sound that you&#x27;d always recognize. That&#x27;s what made for hit records, as well as being a great singer. But you have to have a real special sound that never changes. He could do it all...but again, you always knew that it was Frankie Laine. — Connie Haines

Laine was a frequent guest star on various other shows of the time, including &quot;Shower of Stars&quot;, &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;, &quot;The Sinatra Show&quot;, &quot;The Walter Winchell Show&quot;, &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot;, &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Masquerade Party&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, and &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. He was the mystery guest on the April 12, 1959 episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;. Also in 1959 he made a guest appearance on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; in the title role as comedian Danny Ross in &quot;The Case of the Jaded Joker.&quot;

In the 1960s, Laine continued appearing on variety shows such as &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, but took on several serious guest-starring roles in shows like &quot;Rawhide&quot;, and &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;. His theme song for &quot;Rawhide&quot; proved to be popular and helped make the show, which starred Eric Fleming and launched the career of Clint Eastwood, a hit. Other TV series for which Laine sang the theme song included &quot;Gunslinger&quot;, &quot;The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo&quot;, and &quot;Rango&quot;. In the late 1960s, Laine sang the commercial jingle for the &quot;Manhandlers,&quot; a line of Campbell&#x27;s soups marketed specifically to men. In 1976, Laine recorded The Beatles song, &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer&quot; for the documentary &quot;All This and World War II&quot;.

Laine performed at three Academy Awards ceremonies: 1950 (&quot;Mule Train&quot;), 1960 (&quot;The Hanging Tree&quot;), and 1975 (&quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;). Only the last two of these ceremonies were televised. In 1981, he performed a medley of his hits on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;″s 30th Anniversary Special, where he received a standing ovation. Later appearances include &quot;Nashville Now&quot;, 1989 and &quot;My Music&quot;, 2006.

==Social activism==
Along with opening the door for many R&amp;B performers, Laine played a significant role in the civil rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s. When Nat King Cole&#x27;s television show was unable to get a sponsor, Laine crossed the color line, becoming the first white artist to appear as a guest (forgoing his usual salary of $10,000.00 as Cole&#x27;s show only paid scale). Many other top white singers followed suit, including Tony Bennett and Rosemary Clooney, but Cole&#x27;s show still could not get enough sponsors to continue.

In 1965, Laine joined several African American artists who gave a free concert for Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s supporters during their Selma to Montgomery marches.

Laine, who had a strong appreciation of African American music, went so far as to record at least two songs that have being black as their subject matter, &quot;Shine&quot; and Fats Waller&#x27;s &quot;Black and Blue&quot;. Both were recorded early in his career at Mercury, and helped to contribute to the initial confusion among fans about his race.

Laine was also active in many charities as well, including Meals on Wheels and The Salvation Army. Among his charitable works were a series of local benefit concerts and his having organized a nationwide drive to provide &quot;Shoes for the Homeless&quot;. He donated a large portion of his time and talent to many San Diego charities and homeless shelters, as well as the Salvation Army and St. Vincent de Paul Village. He was also an emeritus member of the board of directors for the Mercy Hospital Foundation.

==Personal life==

Laine married actress Nan Grey (June 1950 – July 1993) and adopted her daughters Pam and Jan from a previous marriage to jockey Jackie Westrope. Their 43-year marriage lasted until her death. Laine and Grey guest-starred on a November 18, 1960, episode of &quot;Rawhide&quot;: &quot;Incident on the Road to Yesterday.&quot; They played long-lost lovers. Following a three-year engagement to Anita Craighead, the 86-year-old singer married Marcia Ann Kline in June 1999. This marriage lasted for the remainder of his life.

==Later years==
Laine settled on a hilltop in the Point Loma neighborhood of San Diego, where he was a supporter of local events and charities. In 2000, the San Diego Chamber of Commerce dubbed him &quot;The Prince of Point Loma&quot;.

His career slowed down a little in the 1980s due to triple and quadruple heart bypass surgeries, but he continued cutting albums, including &quot;Wheels Of A Dream&quot; (1998), &quot;Old Man Jazz&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Nashville Connection&quot; (2004).

In 1986, he recorded the album &quot;Round Up&quot; with Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra, which made it to the classical charts. Laine was reportedly pleased and amused, having also placed songs on the rhythm &amp; blues and popular charts in his time.

He recorded his last song, &quot;Taps/My Buddy&quot;, shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attack on America. The song was dedicated to the New York City firefighters, and Laine stipulated that profits from the song were to be donated, in perpetuity, to the New York Fire Department.

On June 12, 1996, he was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 27th Annual Songwriters’ Hall of Fame awards ceremony at the New York Sheraton. On his 80th birthday, the United States Congress declared him to be a national treasure. Then, a decade later on March 30, 2003, Laine celebrated his 90th birthday, and several of his old friends, Herb Jeffries, Patti Page and Kay Starr, attended his birthday party in San Diego, helping him blow out the candles.

===Final appearance===
In 2006, he appeared on the PBS &quot;My Music&quot; special despite a recent stroke, performing &quot;That&#x27;s My Desire&quot;, and received a standing ovation. It was his last public performance.

Laine died of heart failure on February 6, 2007, at Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego. A memorial mass was held February 12, at the Immaculata parish church on the campus of the University of San Diego. The following day, his ashes, along with those of his late wife, Nan Grey, were scattered over the Pacific Ocean. He was remembered by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as, &quot;a singer who achieved enormous popularity in the 1940s and 50s with a robust voice and a string of hits including &#x27;That’s My Desire,&#x27; &#x27;Mule Train,&#x27; &#x27;Ghost Riders in the Sky&#x27; and &#x27;Jezebel.&#x27;&quot;

==Legacy==
While Laine&#x27;s influence on popular music, rock and roll and soul is rarely acknowledged by rock historians, his early crossover success as a singer of &quot;race music&quot; not only helped pave the way for other white artists who sang in the black style, like Kay Starr, Johnnie Ray and Elvis Presley, but also helped to increase public acceptance for African-American artists as well. Artists inspired and/or influenced by Laine include Ray Charles, Bobby Darin, Lou Rawls, The Kalin Twins, The Beatles, Tom Jones, James Brown, Billy Fury, and many others.

He was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2008.

In 2010, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

For his contributions to the music and television industry, Frankie Laine has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The music star is at the north side of the 1600 block on Hollywood Boulevard, the television star is at the west side of the 1600 block on Vine Street.

Eagle announced a leadership challenge to Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn on 11 July 2016, but eight days later she withdrew leaving Owen Smith to challenge Corbyn for the leadership.

==Early life and career==
Angela Eagle was born on 17 February 1961 in Bridlington, the daughter of Shirley (née Kirk), a factory worker, and André Eagle, a print worker. She was educated at St Peter&#x27;s C of E Primary School and Formby High School. In 1976, Eagle was joint winner of the British Girls&#x27; Under-18 chess championship. She studied philosophy, politics and economics at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, graduating from the university with a second-class Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983. While at Oxford, she was chairwoman of the Oxford University Fabian Society.

In 1984, after graduating from Oxford, Eagle worked in the economic directorate of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), before joining the Confederation of Health Service Employees (COHSE) trade union where she held a number of positions. She was elected secretary for the Constituency Labour Party in Peckham for two years from 1989.

==Political career==

===Parliamentary career===
Eagle was elected to Parliament as MP for Wallasey at the 1992 general election, winning with 48.9% of the vote and a majority of 3,809. Allegations were made about irregularities in her selection as parliamentary candidate, including the exclusion of a local favourite from the shortlist of candidates, and in the vote count itself.

She became a member of the Employment Select committee in 1994.

Eagle was re-elected as MP for Wallasey at the 1997 general election with an increased vote share of 64.6% and an increased majority of 19,074. She was again re-elected at the 2001 general election, with a decreased vote share of 60.8% and a decreased majority of 12,276.

As a backbencher, Eagle joined the Treasury Select Committee in January 2003. She voted in favour of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, and repeatedly against investigating it in 2003, 2006, and 2007.

At the 2005 general election, Eagle was again re-elected with a decreased vote share of 54.8% and a decreased majority of 9,109.

In April 2008 Eagle took part in a debate in Parliament on the UK economy in which the Liberal Democrats tabled a motion suggesting that the country was facing an &quot;extreme bubble in the housing market&quot; and the &quot;risk of recession&quot;. Eagle responded, &quot;Fortunately for all of us … that colourful and lurid fiction has no real bearing on the macro-economic reality.&quot; A year later Jeremy Browne, who led the original debate, said her comments &quot;summed up the Government&#x27;s delusional attitude&quot; towards warnings of financial crisis.

Eagle was again re-elected at the 2010 general election with a decreased vote share of 51.8% and a decreased majority of 8,507.

In April 2011, Eagle was put down in the House of Commons by Prime Minister David Cameron when he used Michael Winner&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Calm down, dear&quot;. Eagle&#x27;s colleague, deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman, said: &quot;Women in Britain in the 21st century do not expect to be told to &#x27;calm down, dear&#x27; by their Prime Minister&quot;, with Labour officials calling for an apology, suggesting the remark was patronising and sexist.

In May 2012, Eagle became chair of the Labour Party&#x27;s National Policy Forum and served as chair of the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee 2013–14.

In June 2012, Eagle criticised Take That singer Gary Barlow in the House of Commons following newspaper allegations of tax avoidance made against him. Eagle criticised his recent appointment as an OBE, and claimed in the House of Commons that Barlow had &quot;given a whole new meaning to the phrase &#x27;Take That&#x27;,&quot; as well as questioning why Prime Minister David Cameron had not criticised Barlow publicly in the same way he had criticised comedian Jimmy Carr for tax avoidance.

At the 2015 general election, Eagle was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 60.4% and an increased majority of 16,348. She was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election with an increased vote share of 71.5% and an increased majority of 23,320. At the 2019 general election, Eagle was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 64.3% and a decreased majority of 18,322. She was again re-elected at the 2024 general election with a decreased vote share of 57.7% and a decreased majority of 17,996.

In November 2024, Eagle voted in favour of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which proposes to legalise assisted suicide.

===Blair government ministry===
Eagle was promoted by Tony Blair in 1996 to the position of an Opposition Whip. 

Following the 1997 general election, Eagle was as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, moving to the Department of Social Security in 1998.

Following the 2001 general election, she succeeded Mike O&#x27;Brien as an Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office. However, she was sacked by Blair in 2002, reportedly in error, and replaced by Lord Filkin.

===Brown government ministry===
Eagle returned to the government under Gordon Brown on 29 June 2007 as Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, the most junior minister at HM Treasury. She was promoted to Minister of State at the Department for Work and Pensions in the June 2009 reshuffle.

===Miliband shadow ministry===
Following Ed Miliband&#x27;s accession to Leader of the Labour Party after the 2010 general election, Eagle was elected to his shadow cabinet and was subsequently appointed to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury briefing, shadowing Danny Alexander.

In the October 2011 reshuffle, Eagle became Shadow Leader of the House of Commons.

====Deputy leadership election====

Following the resignation of Miliband and deputy Harriet Harman following Labour&#x27;s defeat at the 2015 general election, Eagle stood in the Labour Party deputy leadership election.

Eagle was nominated by 32 Constituency Labour Parties and trade unions UNISON, CWU, TSSA, and UCATT and received joint support from Unite for her and fellow candidate Tom Watson. Eagle came fourth to eventual winner Tom Watson, with 16.2% in the first round, and was eliminated in the second round on 17.9% of the vote.

===Corbyn shadow cabinet===
Following the leadership election, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn appointed Eagle as Shadow First Secretary of State and Shadow Business Secretary in September 2015.

Angela Eagle resigned from these positions on 27 June 2016 in the mass resignation of the Shadow Cabinet in the wake of the vote for Leave in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. Eagle had campaigned for the Remain side in the referendum.

====Leadership challenge====

Following the 28 June 2016 vote of no confidence by Labour MPs in Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership, Eagle was reported as considering a challenge for the leadership of the Labour Party, and said she would do so if Corbyn did not resign. Eagle asserted that: &quot;I&#x27;m not a Blairite. I&#x27;m not a Brownite... I am my own woman, a strong Labour woman.&quot; George Eaton of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; reported that backers of the other potential challenger, Owen Smith, contended that Eagle&#x27;s 2003 vote in support for the Iraq War and her support for extending airstrikes against ISIS into Syria (in December 2015) might harm her bid against Corbyn, Gary Younge of &quot;The Guardian&quot; thought it was less clear what Eagle wanted in place of Corbyn&#x27;s politics. 

Eagle announced a leadership challenge to Corbyn on 11 July, saying that &quot;Jeremy Corbyn is unable to provide the leadership this huge task needs. I believe I can&quot;. On Tuesday 19 July 2016, Eagle announced she was withdrawing from the leadership election and would back the other candidate opposing Corbyn, Owen Smith, who had received about 20 more nominations from MPs and MEPs than she had. &quot;We need to have a strong and united party so we can be a good opposition, take the fight to the Conservative Government and heal our country. So I am announcing that I will be supporting Owen in that endeavour with all my enthusiasm and might,&quot; Eagle said in an interview.

Eagle&#x27;s Constituency Labour Party in Wallasey were in favour of Corbyn remaining party leader and called upon Eagle to support Corbyn as leader. Her local party in Wallasey declared their support for Jeremy Corbyn as party leader &quot;with an overwhelming majority&quot; and proposed a vote of no-confidence in Eagle. This did not take place as the NEC decided to suspend all Labour constituency party meetings during the leadership election. With the support of Eagle, Wallasey Constituency Labour Party was suspended on 20 July 2016 over claims of bullying. An internal Labour Party investigation concerning complaints about incidents in Eagle&#x27;s Constituency Labour Party and other events during her leadership campaign reported in October 2016. It confirmed that she had received homophobic abuse during a CLP annual general meeting earlier in the year. Pro-Corbyn activists strongly deny these accusations.

The day following her declaration a brick was thrown through a downstairs window at her constituency office address, and it was reported that her staff had stopped answering the telephones because of &quot;abusive&quot; calls. Eagle herself claimed to have received hundreds of abusive and homophobic messages at this time. It emerged on 21 July that the police had advised Eagle not to hold any open constituency surgeries over fears for her safety, advice which she has agreed to follow with regret. &quot;It&#x27;s highly likely that the brick thrown through the window of Angela Eagle&#x27;s office was related to her leadership challenge&quot;. According to an internal party report, &quot;[t]he position of the window made it very unlikely that this was&quot; an action of &quot;a random passerby&quot; and it &quot;was directly between two Labour offices&quot;. The claim &quot;that the building was occupied by many companies and the window was in an unrelated stairwell&quot; was judged to be misleading as &quot;the landlord had a number of companies registered there; in fact the only other occupant is the landlord on the upper floor&quot;.

==Personal life==
Eagle was joined in the House of Commons at the 1997 general election by her twin sister, Maria Eagle. The Eagles are one of two pairs of sisters in the Commons, as of 2017, the other being Rachel and Ellie Reeves. They are identical twins.

Angela Eagle is a lesbian, coming out in a newspaper interview in September 1997. She is the second openly lesbian MP, after Maureen Colquhoun in the 1970s. In September 2008, Eagle entered into a civil partnership with Maria Exall who is also involved in the Labour Party through the National Committee.

Eagle is an avid fan of new wave band The Pretenders, and got to know lead singer Chrissie Hynde by sneaking backstage at Pretenders gigs. She still attends their gigs regularly, and Hynde has noted that Eagle would probably know even the band&#x27;s most obscure songs.

Eagle was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2021 New Year Honours for parliamentary and political service. She is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society.

<text>The SKS () is a semi-automatic rifle designed by Soviet small arms designer Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov in the 1940s.

The SKS was first produced in the Soviet Union but was later widely exported and manufactured by various nations. Its distinguishing characteristics include a permanently attached folding bayonet and a hinged, fixed magazine. As the SKS lacked select-fire capability and its magazine was limited to ten rounds, it was rendered obsolete in the Soviet Armed Forces by the introduction of the AK-47 in the 1950s. Nevertheless, SKS carbines continued to see service with the Soviet Border Troops and second-line and reserve army units for decades.

The SKS was manufactured at Tula Arsenal from 1949 to 1958, and at the Izhevsk Arsenal from 1953 to 1954. Altogether, the Soviet Union produced 2.7 million SKS carbines. Throughout the Cold War, millions of additional SKS carbines and their derivatives were also manufactured under license in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, as well as a number of countries allied with the Eastern Bloc. The SKS was exported in vast quantities and found favour with insurgent forces around the world as a light, handy weapon which was adequate for guerrilla warfare despite its conventional limitations.

Beginning in 1988, millions have also been sold on the civilian market in North America, where they remain popular as hunting and sporting rifles.

== Design ==


The SKS is a gas-operated carbine with a conventional wooden stock and a fixed ten-round box magazine enclosed inside the receiver. It has a tilting bolt and a gas piston operating rod that works to unlock and cycle the action via gas pressure. When a round is discharged, some of the gases in the bore are diverted through the gas port and impinge on the head of the piston. The piston is driven rearwards and the tappet strikes the bolt carrier; a spring returns the tappet and piston to their forward position. The bolt carrier is driven rearwards, which causes it to lift and unlock the bolt and allowing it to be carried rearwards against the recoil spring. This allows the fired cartridge case to be ejected, and as the bolt is returned to its original position by the recoil spring it strips a new round from the magazine and chambers it. 

The SKS magazine can be loaded either by hand or from a stripper clip which seats in the bolt carrier. To load the rifle, the cocking handle on the right of the bolt is retracted, and if the magazine is empty the bolt will remain at the rear. When the magazine is fully loaded, the bolt is pulled slightly back then released, at which time it will chamber the first round. Cartridges stored in the magazine can be removed by pulling back on a latch located forward of the trigger guard (thus opening the &quot;floor&quot; of the magazine and allowing the rounds to fall out).

When the magazine is expended, a small stud engages the bolt and holds it to the rear, in effect functioning as a bolt hold open device. After the magazine platform is depressed by the insertion of ammunition, the stud continues to hold the bolt at the rear of the receiver until the bolt is pulled slightly back, at which time it drops into its normal position and releases the bolt to chamber the next round.

While early (1949–50) Soviet models had spring-loaded firing pins, which held the pin away from cartridge primers until struck by the action&#x27;s hammer, most variants of the SKS have a free-floating firing pin within the bolt. Because of this design, care must be taken during cleaning (especially after long storage packed in cosmoline) to ensure that the firing pin can freely move and does not stick in the forward position within the bolt. SKS firing pins that are stuck in the forward position have been known to cause accidental &quot;slamfires&quot; (the rifle firing on its own, without pulling the trigger and often without being fully locked). This behavior is less likely with the hard primer military-spec ammo for which the SKS was designed, but as with any rifle, users should properly maintain their firearms. For collectors, slamfires are more likely when the bolt still has remnants of cosmoline embedded in it that retard firing pin movement. As it is triangular in cross section with only one way to properly insert it (notches up), slamfires can also result if the firing pin is inserted in one of the other two orientations.

In most variants (Yugoslav models being the most notable exception), the barrel is chrome-lined for increased wear and heat tolerance from sustained fire and to resist corrosion from chlorate-primed corrosive ammunition, as well as to facilitate cleaning. Chrome bore lining is common in military rifles. Although it can diminish precision, its effect on practical accuracy in a rifle of this type is limited.

The front sight has a hooded post. The rear sight is an open notch type which is adjustable for elevation from . There is also an all-purpose &quot;battle&quot; setting on the sight ladder (marked &quot;П&quot;, for &quot;Прямой выстрел&quot;, meaning &quot;Straight shot&quot;), set for . This is attained by moving the elevation slide to the rear of the ladder as far as it will go. 

All military SKSs have a bayonet attached to the underside of the barrel, which is extended and retracted via a spring-loaded hinge. Both blade and spike bayonets were produced. Spike bayonets were used on the 1949 Tula Russian SKS-45, the Chinese Type 56 from mid 1964 onward, and the Albanian Model 561. The bayonet on the SKS in both the closed/deployed positions also serve to apply tension on the cleaning rod keep it firmly in place.

The SKS is easily field stripped and reassembled without specialized tools, and the trigger group and magazine can be removed with an unfired cartridge, or with the receiver cover. The rifle has a cleaning kit stored in a trapdoor in the buttstock, with a cleaning rod running under the barrel, in the same style as the AK-47. The cap for the cleaning kit also serves as a cleaning rod guide, to protect the crown from being damaged during cleaning. The body of the cleaning kit serves as the cleaning rod handle. In common with some other Soviet-era designs, it trades some accuracy for ruggedness, reliability, ease of maintenance, ease of use, and low manufacturing cost.

==Development history==

The Soviet Union utilized a number of semi-automatic as well as select-fire rifles during World War II, namely the AVS-36, SVT-38, and SVT-40. However, the primary service rifle of the Red Army remained the bolt-action Mosin–Nagant, which fired the powerful but heavy 7.62×54mmR round. Even prior to the war, the Red Army had recognized that these weapons were obsolete and initiated a program to modernize its existing small arms, although this was interrupted by the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Among the military development programs the Soviet Union had monitored in other countries were the Finnish, Swiss, and German developments in intermediate rifle cartridges. These had limited range and muzzle velocity compared to the 7.62×54mmR and other contemporary rifle rounds such as the 7.92×57mm Mauser and the .30-06 Springfield, but also possessed numerous advantages: they were cheaper to manufacture, permitted easier weapons handling due to their much-reduced recoil and muzzle blast, and enabled infantry to carry more due to their small size and light weight. They could also be fired from shorter and lighter rifles. The Red Army&#x27;s interest in an intermediate cartridge was piqued when stocks of 7.92×33mm Kurz ammunition were captured from the Wehrmacht, and by the end of 1943, Soviet technicians had developed a similar cartridge based closely on the German design, the 7.62×39mm M43. Early trials showed that the new round had the penetrative capacity to pierce three panels of plywood, each of 2.25 cm thickness, at a six hundred meter range. Red Army officials believed this was more than enough power to wound or kill a soldier at typical battlefield range. Limited production of the new ammunition type commenced in 1944.

Hurried efforts were made to introduce a rifle capable of firing the new cartridge, and the first prominent design was offered by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov. This was known as the &quot;Samozaryadny Karabin sistemy Simonova&quot; (SKS), or Simonov&#x27;s self-loading carbine system. Simonov had already been working on a semi-automatic carbine chambered for a lighter cartridge as early as 1941, owing to recent complaints about the effectiveness of the SVT-40. In fact, one of his earliest prototypes was chambered for the 7.62×25mm Tokarev pistol cartridge, which was also used in the PPSh-41 submachine gun. He also built at least one prototype chambered for the larger 7.62×54mmR cartridge. Unlike previous Soviet semi-automatic rifles, these utilized fixed five or ten-round magazines loaded from stripper clips. They were also distinguished by a large muzzle brake and a fixed gas system covered with a metal shroud. Simonov&#x27;s design was based on the operating mechanism of the PTRS-41 anti-tank rifle he&#x27;d previously developed for the Red Army the same year. On 1 July 1941, the Artillery Committee of the Red Army noted in its records that the Simonov&#x27;s self-loading carbine, designated SKS-41, satisfied its basic &quot;tactical and technical requirements&quot;. The Committee praised the SKS-41 for its light weight and the design of its fixed magazine; it recommended that 50 pre-production models with ten-round magazines be presented to the Red Army for trials. The SKS-41 was to be chambered for the 7.62×54mmR cartridge for logistical reasons, as the Soviet government wished to adapt its existing rifle barrel production lines for the new carbine.

Red Army evaluation of the SKS-41 prototypes was shelved due to the German invasion, and did not resume until Simonov rechambered his weapon to accommodate the 7.62×39mm cartridge in 1944. He also made a number of other detail improvements to his original carbine, omitting the large and unwieldy muzzle brake, adding a folding bayonet, and replacing the metal gas system shroud with a removable wooden upper handguard and gas tube which housed the gas piston. The gas tube and upper handguard could now be removed as needed to access the gas port and piston for cleaning. The appearance of a 7.62×39mm prototype revived interest in Simonov&#x27;s design, as only he and one other weapons designer, Alexey Sudayev, were able to produce rifles chambered for the new round on short notice. Sudayev&#x27;s prototype was a less conventional, more compact assault rifle which more closely resembled the later AK-47. A second 7.62×39mm semi-automatic carbine contender was later offered by Mikhail Kalashnikov; this was based on the operating system of the M1 Garand. Kalashnikov&#x27;s carbine appeared too late to participate in the Red Army&#x27;s initial evaluation, and was rejected as the decision had already been made to submit the SKS for field trials.

The SKS was light, simple, and considerably shorter than the Mosin–Nagant, which made it easier to handle in dense foliage and urban environments. Simonov deliberately designed the SKS with loose-fitting parts, making it less likely to jam when dirty, inadequately lubricated, or clogged with carbon residue. This was a notable departure from the relatively tight tolerances on the previous generation of Soviet semi-automatic rifles, and was also part of the design process of the AK-47. The SKS was officially designated as a carbine, although it did not fulfill the same role as the M1 carbine used in the United States Army at the time, and more resembled a traditional infantry rifle both in terms of design and envisaged role. Simonov&#x27;s early 7.62×39mm models were quickly pressed into service with troops of the 1st Belorussian Front during the final months of World War II. The SKS was still undergoing active field trials when Germany surrendered to the Allies in May 1945. At the war&#x27;s end, the trials commission in the 1st Belorussian Front recommended the carbine be accepted into general service as the SKS-45. Mass production was delayed while the SKS underwent minor technical changes and alterations as a result of its trial performance during the war. By the end of the 1940s, it finally superseded the various models of the Mosin–Nagant as the standard Soviet infantry rifle. 

The AK-47 assault rifle and the RPD machine gun, both firing the same 7.62×39mm cartridge, were introduced into Soviet service around the same time to complement the SKS. During the 1950s, the Soviet Army rapidly mechanized its existing infantry formations, shifting primarily from light infantry on foot to a much more mobile force deploying from armored vehicles. This fundamental shift in tactics called for large volumes of automatic fire to be delivered from moving vehicles, and the AK-47, with its select-fire capability, compact size, and larger detachable magazine, was more appropriate for this role than the SKS. As a result, the AK-47 gradually replaced the SKS as the standard service rifle of the Soviet Army throughout the 1950s. A US Army review of Soviet tactics and weapons found that &quot;the SKS was phased out of infantry use in the late 1950s, not because of any inherent faults, but because a radical change in Soviet tactics rendered it obsolete.&quot; However, even at the time of its introduction, Soviet military strategists had always desired an infantry rifle with more firepower than the SKS. They needed a weapon that better permitted the infantry to give massed automatic fire during an offensive. Military historian Edward Ezell suggested that the SKS was always intended to be an interim solution, and the Soviets simply pushed it into production because they wanted any rifle chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge in general service as soon as possible, while a select-fire assault rifle was still being perfected. Small arms expert John Walter concurs in his works, noting that the SKS was &quot;ordered into series production largely to gain experience with the new M43 intermediate ammunition and buy time while a true assault rifle was developed.&quot; There was a proposal that the SKS could be retained as a dedicated marksman rifle, but it failed to meet the accuracy requirements and this role was subsequently filled by a new weapon, the SVD.

In June 1955, the Soviet Union hosted a military and civilian delegation from the People&#x27;s Republic of China led by General Zhao Erlu. The Chinese delegation was given a tour of the Tula Arms Plant, where they observed the assembly of SKS carbines. General Erlu expressed an interest in acquiring the technology for the SKS, as China had previously only been granted a license to produce the Mosin–Nagant, which was by then a rather antiquated design. After negotiations between Mao Zedong and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet Union agreed to transfer the technology for the SKS, as well as the AK-47 and the 7.62×39mm cartridge. Parallel production lines for the SKS and the AK-47 were set up in China the following year. Chinese production of the SKS continued for decades after it ceased in the Soviet Union, and over nine million had been manufactured as the &quot;Type 56&quot; carbine in that country by the 1980s. Eighty Chinese factories eventually tooled up to produce the Type 56 carbine, although the primary production line was established at the Jianshe Machine Tool Factory, officially designated Factory 296. The Chinese carbines were mostly identical to the Soviet weapon, although their receivers were produced with carbon steel rather than the Soviet specified chrome-nickel alloy steel. Over the course of production, the Type 56 carbine was also manufactured with a greater percentage of stamped as opposed to machined parts. 

In terms of production numbers, the SKS was the ninth most produced self-loading rifle design in history. Nearly all the Warsaw Pact member states adopted the SKS at one time or another, and technical specifications to produce the carbine were shared with the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and Romania. With the assistance of Soviet or Chinese technicians and generous military grants, armaments factories producing SKS carbines were later established in North Vietnam, North Korea, Yugoslavia, and Albania as well.

While remaining far less ubiquitous than the AK, both original SKS carbines and foreign variants can still be found today in civilian hands as well as in the arsenals of insurgent groups and paramilitary forces around the world. The SKS has been circulated in up to 69 countries, both by national governments and non-state actors. In 2016, it was still being widely circulated among civilians and non-state actors in at least five of those countries and remained in the reserve and training inventories of over 50 national armies.

==Service history==
A few years after the SKS was brought into service in 1949, it was rendered obsolete for the Soviet military by the new AK-47, which was adopted in increasing numbers by Soviet front-line units throughout the 1950s. During the early 1950s, the typical Soviet rifle squad was organized on the basis of the SKS and the RPD light machine gun, which was chambered for the same 7.62×39mm ammunition. The RPD&#x27;s role was the designated squad automatic weapon, laying down suppressive fire in support of infantry armed with semi-automatic carbines. The Soviet Army wanted all members of the rifle squad to have the ability to use fully automatic fire as needed, which played a pivotal role in the AK gaining favor as the standard infantry weapon over the SKS. The SKS and RPD were also very different weapons with no interchangeable parts, and they required separate training and maintenance programs. As a result, a light machine gun more compatible with the rest of the rifle squad&#x27;s weapons was requested. This would result in the adoption of the RPK light machine gun. The RPK was derived directly from the AK and had an identical manual of arms. 

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) first noted the SKS replacing the Mosin–Nagant with front-line Soviet units in Europe in 1954, and began compiling detailed information about the new service rifle. The CIA observed that the AK-47 was being introduced at the same time to replace the PPSh-41 submachine gun. Two years later, the SKS was used by Soviet troops and Hungarian partisans alike during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Thereafter, while the SKS was retained for various auxiliary duties, it ceased to have any real military significance in the Soviet Union. Only a small number remained in active service, mostly with support units, until the 1980s. However, the SKS found a longer second life in the service of various Soviet-aligned nations, in particular the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Chinese state manufactured it for decades after production had ceased in the Soviet Union, mainly to arm its vast military reserves and militia forces. 

The SKS was in general issue with regular units of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) for thirty years as the Type 56 carbine. In the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the semi-automatic carbine gave the PLA a distinct advantage over the Indian infantry, then armed with bolt-action Lee–Enfield rifles. During the mid 1960s, China developed the Type 63 assault rifle to replace the Type 56, but it failed to meet the PLA&#x27;s standards and did not enter general service. In 1978, the typical PLA infantry battalion was still armed with 360 Type 56 carbines and 221 Type 56 assault rifles. PLA forces armed primarily with Type 56 carbines fought Soviet troops armed primarily with AK-47s during the Sino-Soviet border conflict. During the Sino-Vietnamese War, PLA infantry armed primarily with Type 56 carbines engaged Vietnamese infantry armed with the same weapon and its Soviet equivalent. The conflict was notable in that both sides commonly fielded the SKS/Type 56 carbine alongside AK-pattern automatic rifles, although the Vietnamese forces had largely transitioned to the latter while the PLA had not. The Type 56 carbine was retired from PLA service in the late 1980s, when it was replaced by the Type 81 assault rifle. Aside from ceremonial purposes, it remained in limited use as a training rifle for military cadets and members of the Chinese state militia during the 1990s and 2000s. 

The Polish People&#x27;s Republic and Socialist Republic of Romania received technical assistance from the Soviet Union to produce the SKS under license in 1956. However, later that year the Polish general staff belatedly rejected the SKS as a standard service rifle, choosing to retain the AK-47 for that role instead. The Polish government subsequently resold the technical data package and tooling equipment to the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1959. The East German National People&#x27;s Army (NVA) was rearmed with the SKS, designated the Karabiner-S, during the early 1960s. The first examples of the SKS directly acquired by the United States were three Karabiner-S carbines stolen by NVA soldiers near Potsdam in 1961. These weapons were sold to a visiting American military officer whose vehicle was not subject to search, enabling him to smuggle them into West Germany. One Karabiner-S was presented to General Garrison H. Davidson as a commemorative piece in 1962, while the other two were sent to the United States for further study in 1963. The NVA began to retire the Karabiner-S from front-line service during the late 1960s, at which time many had their official markings defaced to minimize their intelligence value and were exported overseas to other friendly socialist states such as North Vietnam. 

Before adopting domestic AK-47 derivatives, a number of non-aligned nations such as Egypt and Yugoslavia adopted the SKS as a standard service rifle. The Egyptian Army used the SKS extensively during the Suez Crisis, and a number were captured and evaluated by Western intelligence agencies in the aftermath of that conflict. Some Egyptian forces were still armed with the SKS as late as the Six Day War, which saw thousands of the carbines captured by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). During its own evaluation of the weapon, the IDF described the SKS as &quot;first rate in several respects&quot; but noted the difficulty of loading the fixed magazine quickly with stripper clips, especially during night fighting operations when visibility was poor. 

The Indonesian Army attempted to adopt the Type 56 carbine as its standard service rifle during the early 1960s, and ordered 100,000 from China following negotiations between Sukarno and Premier Zhou Enlai in 1962. However, deliveries of the carbines were interrupted by a political crisis in Indonesia during the mid 1960s, and only 25,000 actually reached the army. Many were also diverted to the Communist Party of Indonesia&#x27;s paramilitary forces by sympathetic Indonesian officials.

Beginning in the 1960s, vast quantities of SKS carbines from military reserve stocks were donated by the Soviet Union and China to left-wing guerrilla movements around the world. The increasing ubiquity of the SKS altered the dynamics of asymmetric warfare in developing nations and colonial territories, where most guerrillas had previously been armed with bolt-action rifles. For example, the SKS served as one of the primary arms of the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. The weapon type was encountered so frequently by the United States Armed Forces in Vietnam that captured examples were used by opposing force (OPFOR) units during training exercises designed to simulate battlefield conditions there as early as 1969. Captured SKS carbines were also prized as war trophies among individual US military personnel, and a number were brought back to the United States by returning veterans over the course of the Vietnam conflict. 

The SKS found particular favour in southern Africa, where it was used by a number of insurgent armies fighting to overthrow colonial rule in Angola, Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), and South West Africa (Namibia). After Angolan independence, the Soviet Union delivered up to 5,000 SKS carbines to support the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) during that country&#x27;s lengthy civil war. The MPLA&#x27;s primary opponent, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), commonly used Type 56 carbines supplied by China. The SKS was also used in large quantities by uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa. Between 1963 and 1990, the Soviet Union shipped 3,362 SKS carbines to MK through the guerrillas&#x27; external sanctuaries in Angola and Tanzania. SKS carbines captured from MK by the South African security forces were used to arm militias of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) during its internal power struggle with the ANC in the 1980s and 1990s.

East Germany and the Soviet Union both armed various factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) with SKS carbines from the 1950s through the 1970s; these were used against the IDF and in various internecine clashes during the Lebanese Civil War. The Soviet carbines were initially shipped to PLO training camps in Egypt, where the Egyptian Army provided instructors to train PLO fighters in their use.

Both Type 56 and Soviet SKS carbines were used by Simba forces during the Simba Rebellion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The rebels appreciated the carbine for its relatively compact size, light cartridge, and chrome-lined bore (which made it resistant to rust and corrosion in the tropical climate) over the much bulkier Western battle rifles used by Congolese security forces. The African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIG) favored the SKS as one of its primary small arms during the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence. Captured PAIG carbines were stored and later re-issued by Portugal to its local colonial units, primarily for garrison duties. A number of Type 56 carbines were acquired and used alongside the more ubiquitous AK-pattern rifles by the Provisional Irish Republican Army during the Troubles. China also supplied the Afghan mujahidin with Type 56 carbines during the early years of the Soviet–Afghan War. During the Dhofar Rebellion, SKS carbines were smuggled into Oman by sea, most likely by the Soviet Union, to arm Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman (PFLO) insurgents there. The Eritrean Liberation Front used large numbers of SKS carbines during the Eritrean War of Independence. The Communist Party of Thailand (CPT) used the SKS during its insurgency until the early 1980s, when it ceased militant operations. Cuban and Grenadian military forces used the SKS during the 1983 US invasion of Grenada. The US Army captured 4,074 SKS carbines during the invasion, mostly from arms depots.

By the early 1980s, the SKS had been almost entirely superseded in worldwide military service by the AK-47 and its derivatives. The increasing proliferation of cheap AK-pattern rifles in most asymmetric conflicts also ended the popularity of the SKS as a standard guerrilla arm. At that time, the majority of the remaining carbines still in active use were being issued to state-sponsored militias and other paramilitary formations for internal security duties. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, SKS carbines proliferated in various civil wars and regional conflicts throughout the former Soviet republics, including the War in Abkhazia, War of Dagestan, and the war in Donbas. Militant factions in the Balkans frequently used smuggled SKS and Type 56 carbines alongside the Yugoslavian M59/66 derivative during the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2016, the SKS remained in the reserve stockpiles of over 50 national armies, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and the former Soviet bloc.

==Variants==
After World War II, the SKS design was licensed or sold to a number of the Soviet Union&#x27;s allies, including China, Yugoslavia, Albania, North Korea, North Vietnam, East Germany, and Romania. Most of these nations produced nearly identical variants, with the most common modifications being differing styles of bayonets and the 22 mm rifle grenade launcher commonly seen on Yugoslavian models.

===Soviet and Russian===
Differences from the &quot;baseline&quot; late Russian Tula Armory/Izhevsk Armory SKS:

* Variations (1949–1958): Early spike-style bayonet (1949) instead of blade-style. Spring-return firing pin was present on early models, and they did not have chrome bores (1949 – early 1951). The gas block had three changes: The first production stage gas block, used from 1949 through early 1950, was squared-off at a 90-degree angle. The second gas block production stage was instead cut at a 45-degree angle, seen on late 1950 to 1951 rifles. The third and final gas block stage, from 1952 through to 1956, was curved inward slightly toward the action.
* Designated marksman rifle SKS: During the late 1950s, the Soviets expressed interest in adopting an SKS variant adapted for the designated marksman role. Some prototypes were produced with side-mounted scope rails to accept a PU scope. These failed to meet the army&#x27;s accuracy requirements, and the program was abandoned in favor of developing a new dedicated precision rifle.
* SKS M1950: An SKS modified for fully automatic fire. Prototype only.
* SKS M1951: An SKS with a detachable bayonet and detachable box magazine. Prototype only.
* SKS M1953: An SKS with select-fire fire capability, a new muzzle brake, detachable bayonet, and detachable box magazine. One prototype built before further development was canceled due to the decision to replace the SKS in general service with the AK.
*VPO-208: SKS carbine modified with a smoothbore barrel and rechambered for the .366 TKM cartridge for commercial sales.
*OP-SKS. SKS carbines converted into commercial hunting rifles by the &quot;Molot&quot; (&quot;Hammer&quot;) factory in Vyatskiye Polyany (Russian: Вятско-Полянский машиностроительный завод «Молот», English: &quot;Vyatskiye Polyany Machine-Building Plant&quot;). These were labeled OP (OP = охотничье-промысловый &gt; &quot;okhotnich&#x27;ye-promyslovyy&quot; &gt; &quot;commercial hunting (carbine)&quot;). The OP-SKS continued to be manufactured into the 2000s.

===Chinese===
* Type 56 carbine (1956–1980s): The earliest Type 56 carbines were assembled under the supervision of Soviet technicians, using parts and materials imported from the Soviet Union. Thereafter, minor tweaks were made from the original Soviet design, namely the transition to domestic carbon steel in production as opposed to the Soviet-specified nickel-chrome alloy steel. Early Type 56 carbines had blade bayonets, while those in later production had spike bayonets. Chinese production also introduced a larger proportion of stamped as opposed to machined parts, and the addition of a pressed and pinned barrel. 
* Stamped receiver Type 56: In 1970 and 1971, China produced a small number of Type 56 carbines with experimental stamped sheet metal receivers as a cost and weight saving measure. About 12,000 were manufactured before the program was canceled.
* Fiberglass stock Type 56: During the 1960s, China produced a number of Type 56 carbines with fiberglass stocks, known colloquially in Western literature as &quot;Vietnam stocks&quot; or &quot;jungle stocks&quot;. These were originally designed for export to North Vietnam and the Viet Cong, due to complaints about wooden stocks rotting or attracting termites while being cached in the tropical environment. 
* Type 56 Model 84: Short-barreled variant with a detachable magazine produced for overseas commercial sales. The Model 84 magazine resembled that of the AK-47/Type 56 assault rifle, and the two were theoretically interchangeable. However, standard Kalashnikov magazines needed modification to fit the Model 84.
* Type 56 Model D: Variant which could accept standard Kalashnikov magazines, produced for overseas commercial sales. 
* Type 56 Model M: Derivative of the Model D with the bayonet lug removed and fitted with a new stock to comply with US import laws.

===Other European===
* Romanian Puska M56: Produced between 1956 and 1960. Typically, they are identical or nearly identical to the late Soviet model. 
*Polish ksS: Refurbished Soviet rifles fitted with unique Polish laminated stocks. A few hundred SKS carbines were given to Poland by the Soviet Union around 1954. While Poland did import the technical data package and tooling equipment to produce the SKS under license, the Polish People&#x27;s Army belatedly rejected the weapon for general service in 1956 and the program was canceled. In Polish service the SKS was used only for ceremonial purposes and was designated as ksS which stands for &quot;karabin samopowtarzalny Simonowa&quot;, Simonov&#x27;s semi-automatic rifle. 
* Yugoslavian PAP M59: Manufactured by Zastava Arms between 1959 and 1966. Barrel is not chrome-lined. PAP stands for &quot;Polu-automatska puška&quot; (Semi-automatic rifle) and the rifle was nicknamed &quot;Papovka&quot;. Otherwise this rifle is nearly identical to the Soviet version. Many were converted to the M59/66 variant during refurbishment.
** Yugoslavian PAP M59/66: Produced between 1967 and 1989. Added 22 mm rifle grenade launcher which appears visually like a flash suppressor or muzzle brake on the end of the barrel. Front sight has a fold-up &quot;ladder&quot; for use in grenade sighting. To raise the grenade sight, the gas port must be manually blocked and the action must be manually cycled—rifle grenades must be fired with special blank cartridges, and this feature helps ensure that the gas pressure is not wasted on cycling the action. The gas port must be manually opened to again allow semi-automatic operation. Barrel was not chrome-lined. Both the grenade launcher and grenade sight are NATO spec. Stock is typically made from beech wood.
** Yugoslavian PAP M59/66A1: Same as above, except with the addition of flip up phosphorescent or tritium night sights.
* Albanian Type 56-1: Produced between 1967 and 1978. There were no rifles produced from 1972 to 1975. Produced by the UM GRAMSH factory located in Gramsh, Albania. Longer stock and handguard on the gas tube, and AK style charging handle. The magazine is slightly different in the shape visible from the outside. The stock has two compartments with two corresponding holes in the buttplate for cleaning implements instead of the single cleaning kit pocket. Like the Chinese Type 56 carbine, the Albanian version also features a spike bayonet fixed beneath the muzzle. The vast majority were scrapped during the late 1990s, although several thousand were sold on the commercial market in North America during the early 2000s. 
* East German Karabiner-S: Slot cut into back of stock for pull-through sling, similar to the slot in a Karabiner 98k. No storage area in back of stock or storage for cleaning rod under barrel. It is believed to have been produced at the J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn facility in Suhl.

===Other Asian===
* North Korean Type 63: Manufactured specifically for the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and other paramilitary forces. At least three separate models were made. One &quot;standard&quot; model with blade bayonet, and a second with a gas shutoff and a grenade launcher, similar to the M59/66. The North Korean grenade launcher was detachable from the muzzle and the gas shutoff was different from the Yugoslavian model, however. A third model appears to have side-swinging bayonet.
* Vietnamese Type 1: Nearly identical to both the Soviet and early Chinese SKS. These are identified by a small star on the receiver with a 1 in the center. The barrel is chromed, as are many of the internal parts. They were assembled in a small arms factory with Chinese assistance located 12 km north of Yên Bái with 6,000 SKS rifles made between 1962 and 1965 when the factory was closed to American bombing raids.
** Vietnamese clone: The Viet Cong manufactured somewhat rudimentary copies of the SKS, which are sometimes seen with crude finish and obvious tool markings.

==Commercial sales and sporting use==
===United States===
Initially, the SKS was a rarity in the US, with the only examples being souvenirs brought back by returning veterans of the Vietnam War. Beginning in 1988, thousands of surplus and newly manufactured Chinese Type 56 carbines were imported in the US. Russia also began exporting the SKS to the US during the early 1990s as well. 

Due to the high volume of initial imports, the SKS became one of the most affordable centerfire rifles available to American sports shooters, retailing for as little as $70 per weapon in the early 1990s. Dale Armstrong, a former firearms tracking analyst with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), commented on the volume of cheap surplus weapons, naming the SKS and Type 56 carbines specifically alongside Makarov and TT-33 type pistols: &quot;A firearm of that quality could not be made for the price it was being sold. The people selling these firearms in the former Soviet bloc countries assumed control of these stockpiles after the fall of communism ... [therefore] they had no manufacturing cost. These weapons were pure profit, so they could afford to sell them at a low price and in bulk.&quot; 

Between 1988 and 1998, several million SKS carbines exported from China and the former Soviet Union were sold on the commercial market in the US.

===Canada===
The SKS rifle is very popular in Canada, with some users referring to it as &quot;Canada&#x27;s rifle&quot;. While the SKS is imported for commercial sales in Canada, the magazines are affected by Canadian firearms legislation, which limits the magazines to 5 rounds.

Under Canadian law, the SKS is classified as a non-restricted firearm and can be owned with a firearms license. The classification of non-restricted permits it to be used in hunting and on rural crown land. When the Canadian government introduced an amendment to the pending Bill C-21 that would have expanded and changed the basis for classifying prohibited firearms under the law, the resulting ban on the SKS was a particular point of contention because it is widely used for hunting, notably by First Nations in Canada. The leadership of the Assembly of First Nations voted unanimously to express opposition to the amendment. The amendment was eventually withdrawn due to the widespread opposition.

===Russia===
Surplus SKS carbines are available in their original chambering for sale to any Russian citizen with a rifle purchase permit. The bayonet must be removed, and an additional pin added to the barrel, to modify the SKS sufficiently from its status as a military arm and render it legal for civilian sales. The carbines are relatively inexpensive in Russia, making them attractive to hunters on a budget. Examples of the SKS modified as smoothbore weapons and firing the unique .366 TKM cartridge are also available on the Russian commercial market. These weapons are legally classified as shotguns, and are favored by Russian sport shooters and hunters who possess the more easily obtainable shotgun purchase permit. The .366 TKM cartridge is a 7.62×39mm cartridge case necked out to accept a .366 caliber slug.

<text>The Robots of Dawn is a &quot;whodunit&quot; science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, first published in 1983. It is the third novel in Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; series.

== Plot summary ==
Detective Elijah Baley of Earth is training with his son and others to overcome their socially ingrained agoraphobia when he is told that the Spacer world of Aurora has requested him to investigate a crime: the destruction of the mind of R. Jander Panell, a humaniform robot identical to R. Daneel Olivaw, with a mental block. The robot&#x27;s inventor, Han Fastolfe, has admitted that he is the only person with the skill to have done this, but denies having done so. Fastolfe is also a prominent member of the Auroran political faction that favors Earth; therefore, it is politically expedient that he be exonerated. En route to Aurora, Baley again is partnered with R. Daneel Olivaw, and introduced to R. Giskard Reventlov, a robot of an earlier model.

On Aurora, he interviews Gladia Delmarre, R. Jander&#x27;s last owner, and discovers that Gladia had a sexual relationship with Jander, to the point of considering him husband in an emotional sense. Baley later interviews Fastolfe&#x27;s estranged daughter, Vasilia Fastolfe (alias &quot;Vasilia Aliena&quot;), who claims that her father would do anything necessary to advance psychohistory, including the incapacitation of Jander and Gladia&#x27;s heartbreak. Following that, Baley interviews Santirix Gremionis, an Auroran who, with both Gladia and Vasilia, committed the Auroran taboo of offering himself repeatedly (sexually) after rejection. Gremionis denies involvement in the murder, and says he has reported Baley to the Chairman (the executive of the Auroran Government) for slander; but realizes, upon questioning, that Vasilia arranged his infatuation with Gladia.

Next, Baley interviews Kelden Amadiro, Fastolfe&#x27;s chief political rival and head of the Robotics Institute, who explains the Institute&#x27;s political motivations: that they wish to see Aurora alone colonize the Galaxy, by means of humaniform robots which at present only Fastolfe can build. On the way from the interview with Amadiro, Baley&#x27;s airfoil (a personal hovercraft) is forced to stop. The air compressor has been sabotaged. Baley, suspecting Amadiro, orders Daneel and Giskard to flee. When several robots catch up with the car and question Baley, Baley tells them that he ordered Daneel back to the Robotics Institute, and they leave. Baley flees the car into the thunderstorm outside, where his agoraphobia renders him unconscious. He is recovered by Gladia and Giskard, and taken to Gladia&#x27;s house. At an earlier-arranged meeting with the Chairman, Fastolfe, and Amadiro, Baley accuses Amadiro of sabotaging the car so that he could keep him, helpless, in the Institute, and thus have a legitimate reason to have Daneel there as well, unsupervised. As Baley states, without Fastolfe&#x27;s cooperation, the only way to obtain knowledge about humaniform robots is to reverse engineer Daneel by thorough questioning, which would have allowed Amadiro to learn the details of his workings.

While logically consistent, Baley&#x27;s unsupported accusation cannot stand against a formal denial by an Auroran as prominent and respected as Amadiro. However, Baley then confronts Amadiro with the revelation that Amadiro knew of the relationship between Gladia and Jander, and moreover, of her considering him her husband; something quite unthinkable for a native Auroran. Amadiro says he may have heard it from someone, but cannot remember whom.

Baley then states that only one Auroran could have told Amadiro about the relationship: Jander himself. Then, he gives the solution to the mystery: that in Gladia&#x27;s absence, Amadiro questioned and tested Jander via trimensional viewing (telepresence). Daneel was part of Fastolfe&#x27;s establishment, and thus well guarded, but Jander was at the house of the much less skilled Gladia, thus questioning him for reverse engineering purposes was much easier. Gremionis was encouraged to court Gladia because they tended to take long walks together, allowing Amadiro more time for his testing. The sabotage to the car was intended to capture Daneel and complete the analysis.

When Baley states that these experiments might have accidentally led to Jander&#x27;s deactivation, Amadiro snaps and states the experiments were completely harmless. Thus, he effectively admits he was working with Jander, which makes his situation hopeless. As a result, he is forced to compromise with Fastolfe&#x27;s policies; Amadiro agrees with Earth&#x27;s right to share in the galactic colonization, while Fastolfe gives the Institute his data about humaniform robot design. Baley, however, confronts Giskard, who admits that Vasilia unknowingly gave him telepathic abilities during experiments when she was a child. Using knowledge derived from Han Fastolfe&#x27;s mind, Giskard shut down Jander, to thwart Amadiro&#x27;s attempt to build humaniform robots. Giskard allows Baley to retain knowledge of his abilities, but prevents him (with the help of his telepathic abilities) from revealing the secret.

==Characters==
Below is a list of all the major and minor characters in the book, in order of appearance, with plot detail.

* Elijah Baley: a Plainclothesman (police detective) who works on Earth. He is called to solve the case on Aurora.
* Jezebel &quot;Jessie&quot; Baley: Elijah’s wife (mentioned only).
* Bentley Baley: Elijah’s son.
* Gladia: a woman Baley met on Solaria, who is now living on Aurora. She borrowed from Fastolfe the now-destroyed Jander Panell.
* Wilson Roth: the new Commissioner and Baley&#x27;s boss ever since Julius Enderby&#x27;s resignation two and a half years before the book&#x27;s events.
* Lavinia Demachek: Undersecretary at the Terrestrial Department of Justice.
* Albert Minnim: superior of Lavinia (mentioned only).
* Han Fastolfe: a politician on Aurora who is accused by extremists of destroying a humaniform robot. As the leading theoretical roboticist on Aurora, he was the one who programmed Daneel, along with some 56 other robots who help around his house. He has two daughters, and is a Humanist (one who believes all human beings have the right to explore the Galaxy).
* R. Daneel Olivaw: ex-partner of Baley, he is the first successful humaniform creation of Fastolfe.
* R. Giskard Reventlov: a robot Baley meets on the way to Aurora. Constructed by Fastolfe, he is his creator’s right-hand robot.
* Jander Panell: the robot that was destroyed on Aurora. Originally owned by Fastolfe, he was lent to Gladia for use.
* Roj Nemennuh Sarton: the designer of Daneel. He was murdered on Earth (mentioned only).
* Fanya: the current wife of Fastolfe (mentioned only).
* Pandion: a robot serving Gladia.
* Borgraf: a robot serving Gladia.
* Vasilia Aliena: Fastolfe’s daughter, whom he raised himself against Auroran custom. She is a professional roboticist and is part of the Robotics Institute of Aurora against Fastolfe.
* Lumen: Fastolfe’s daughter with whom he has little contact. She is running for political office on a Globalist ticket, a party that believes Aurorans deserve the Galaxy. (mentioned only)
* Santirix Gremionis: an Auroran who repeatedly offered himself to Gladia. He is a hair and clothing designer, and was questioned by Baley.
* Brundij: a robot serving Gremionis.
* Kelden Amadiro: the head of the Robotics Institute of Aurora.
* Maloon Cicis: a roboticist with whom Baley spoke to get to Amadiro.
* Rutilan Horder: chairman of the Legislature of Aurora.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #53, and stated that &quot;It&#x27;s a cerebral book, with the intellectual pattern of the crime unravelling bit by bit in a skilled display of pacing and plotting, while the high point of physical excitement merely consists of Baley getting caught out in the rain (a quite effective scene, thanks to his agoraphobia).&quot;

It was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1984.

<doc id="420133" wikidata="Q17055238" url="?curid=420133" title="History of software configuration management">
<text>The history of software configuration management (SCM) can be traced back as early as the 1950s, when CM (configuration management), originally for hardware development and production control, was being applied to software development. Early software had a physical footprint, such as cards, tapes, and other media. The first software configuration management was a manual operation. With the advances in language and complexity, software engineering, involving configuration management and other methods, became a major concern due to issues like schedule, budget, and quality. Practical lessons, over the years, had led to the definition, and establishment, of procedures and tools. Eventually, the tools became systems to manage software changes. Industry-wide practices were offered as solutions, either in an open or proprietary manner (such as Revision Control System). With the growing use of computers, systems emerged that handled a broader scope, including requirements management, design alternatives, quality control, and more; later tools followed the guidelines of organizations, such as the Capability Maturity Model of the Software Engineering Institute.

==Timeline==
* Early 1960s or even late 1950s: CDC UPDATE and IBM IEB_UPDATE.
* Late 1960s into 1970s: The Librarian is released by Applied Data Research and provides an alternative to keeping programs on punched card decks for the IBM mainframe market.
* Late 1960s, early 1970s: Professor Leon Pressor at the University of California, Santa Barbara produced a thesis on change and configuration control. This concept was a response to a contract he was working on with a defense contractor who made aircraft engines for the US Navy.
* Early 1970s: Unix codice_1.
* By 1970 CDC update was an advanced product.
* Circa 1972: Bell Labs paper describing the original codice_2 algorithm.
* 1972, with an IEEE paper in 1975: source code control system, SCCS, Marc Rochkind Bell Labs. Originally programmed in SNOBOL for OS/360; subsequently rewritten in C for Unix (used diff for comparing files).
* 1970s: Lisle, Illinois-based Pansophic Systems offered PANVALET, which was an early source code control system for the mainframe market.
* 1975: Professor Pressor&#x27;s work eventually grew into a commercially available product called Change and Configuration Control (CCC) which was sold by the SoftTool corporation.
* Revision Control System (RCS, Walter Tichy).
* Early 1980s: codice_3 (around 1985, Larry Wall).
* 1984: Aide-de-Camp
* 1986: Concurrent Version System (CVS).
* 2000: Subversion initiated by CollabNet.
* Early 2000s (decade): distributed revision control systems like BitKeeper and GNU arch become viable.

==Background==
Until the 1980s, SCM could only be understood as &quot;CM&quot; applied to software development. Some basic concepts such as &quot;identification&quot; and &quot;baseline&quot; (well-defined point in the evolution of a project) were already clear, but what was at stake was a set of techniques oriented towards the &quot;control&quot; of the activity, and using formal processes, documents, request forms, control boards etc.

It is only after this date that the use of software &quot;tools&quot; applying directly to software &quot;artefacts&quot; representing the actual resources, has allowed SCM to grow as an autonomous entity (from traditional CM).

The use of different tools has actually led to very distinct emphases.

* traditional CM for Software, typically around Change Management (examples: Continuus, CVS or ClearCase UCM)
* line oriented management, based on patches or Change Sets
* focused on Derived Objects and Build Management (example: Base ClearCase/clearmake)

==Evolution==

===First generation===

SCCS (first released in 1973) and DSEE (considered a predecessor of Atria ClearCase), described in 1984, are two other notable VCS software tools. These tools, along with Revision Control System (RCS), are generally considered the first generation of VCS as automated software tools.

===Second generation===

After the first generation VCS, tools such as CVS and Subversion, which feature a locally centralized repository, could be considered as the second generation VCS. Specifically, CVS (Concurrent Versions System) was developed on top of RCS structure, improving scalability of the tool for larger groups, and later PRCS, a simpler CVS-like tool which also uses RCS-like files, but improves upon the delta compression by using Xdelta instead.

By 2006 or so, Subversion was considered to be the most popular and widely in use VCS tool from this generation and filled important weaknesses of CVS. Later SVK developed with the goal of remote contribution feature, but still the foundation of its design were similar to its predecessors.

===Third generation===

As Internet connectivity improved and geographically distributed software development became more common, tools emerged that did not rely on a shared central project repository. These allow users to maintain independent repositories (or forks) of a project and communicate revisions via changesets.
BitKeeper, Git, Monotone, darcs, Mercurial, and bzr
are some examples of third generation version control systems.

<text>Maria Eagle (born 17 February 1961) is a British Labour Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool Garston, previously Garston and Halewood, since 1997. She has served as Minister of State for Defence Procurement and Industry in the Ministry of Defence since July 2024. She served in the Shadow cabinets of Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn. 

The twin sister of Angela Eagle, also a Labour MP, Eagle was born in the East Riding of Yorkshire to a working-class family and raised in Merseyside. She studied Philosophy, politics and economics at Pembroke College, Oxford and Law at the College of Law, London. After graduating with her law degree, she worked as an articled clerk and solicitor in both London and Liverpool. After unsuccessfully contesting Crosby in 1992, she was elected as MP for Liverpool Garston at the 1997 general election.

Under Tony Blair, Eagle was a junior minister at the Department for Work and Pensions, Department for Education and Skills and Northern Ireland Office. She was Minister of State at the Ministry of Justice and Government Equalities Office under Gordon Brown. Following the 2010 general election, Eagle became Shadow Solicitor General for England and Wales. She served in the Shadow cabinet as Shadow Transport Secretary, Shadow Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary, Shadow Defence Secretary and finally Shadow Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She resigned from the Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet in June 2016. She returned to the frontbench as Shadow Minister for Procurement in 2023.

==Early life and career==
Maria Eagle was born on 17 February 1961 in Bridlington, the daughter of Shirley (&quot;&quot; Kirk), a factory worker, and André Eagle, a print worker. She was educated at St Peter&#x27;s Church of England School in Formby, Merseyside and Formby High School before attending Pembroke College, Oxford, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy, politics and economics in 1983.

Eagle worked in the voluntary sector from 1983 to 1990, and then went to the College of Law, London, where she took her law finals in 1990, before she joined Brian Thompson &amp; Partners in Liverpool as an articled clerk in 1990. In 1992 she became a solicitor with Goldsmith Williams in Liverpool, and later a Solicitor at Stephen Irving &amp; Co also in Liverpool, where she remained until her election to Westminster.

After joining the Labour Party, Eagle was elected the secretary of the Crosby Constituency Labour Party (CLP) for two years in 1983, and was also elected as the campaigns organiser with that CLP for three years in 1993.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1992 general election, Eagle stood as the Labour Party candidate in Crosby, coming second with 25.7% of the vote behind the incumbent Conservative MP Malcolm Thornton.

=== Backbencher ===
Prior to the 1997 general election, Eagle was selected through an all-women shortlist to stand as the Labour candidate in Liverpool Garston. Eagle was elected to Parliament as MP for Liverpool Garston with 61.3% of the vote and a majority of 18,417. She made her maiden speech on 17 June 1997.

She became a member of the Public Accounts Committee and in 1999 she was appointed the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, John Hutton. Her proposed ban on mink fur farming was defeated as a Private member&#x27;s bill but subsequently picked up by the government and enacted as the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Act 2000.

Eagle was re-elected as MP for Liverpool Garston at the 2001 general election with an increased vote share of 61.4% and a decreased majority of 12,494.

=== Government minister ===

Eagle was promoted to the Tony Blair government following the 2001 general election as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Work and Pensions.

At the 2005 general election, Eagle was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 54% and a decreased majority of 7,193. Following the election, she was the Minister for Children at the Department for Education and Skills, until the May 2006 reshuffle moved her to Northern Ireland, where she was minister for Employment and Learning.

Eagle was moved to the Ministry of Justice when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister in June 2007. In September 2008, she was nominated for Stonewall Politician of the Year for her work to support equality for lesbian, gay and bisexual people. As part of the government reshuffle in October 2008, she assumed additional responsibility for Equalities. In the June 2009 reshuffle, she was promoted to Minister of State.

===Expenses controversy===
On 17 May 2009, during the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; revealed that Eagle had claimed £3,500 for the refurbishment of the bathroom of her Liverpool home, then switched her second home designation to a different property four months later. Eagle voted in favour of legislation which would have kept MPs&#x27; expenses information secret.

=== In opposition ===

Prior to the 2010 general election, Eagle&#x27;s constituency of Liverpool Garston was abolished, and replaced with Garston and Halewood. At the 2010 general election, Eagle was elected to Parliament as MP for Garston and Halewood with 59.5% of the vote and a majority of 16,877.

Following the election, she served in interim Labour leader Harriet Harman&#x27;s frontbench as Shadow Solicitor General for England and Wales and Shadow Minister for Justice. In October 2010 Eagle was elected to the Shadow cabinet of new Labour Party leader Ed Miliband as Shadow Secretary of State for Transport in the Labour Party Shadow Cabinet election.

In February 2013, she voted in favour in the House of Commons Second Reading vote on marriage equality in Britain.

At the 2015 general election, Eagle was re-elected as MP for Garston and Halewood with an increased vote share of 69.1% and an increased majority of 27,146.

Eagle was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Defence in September 2015 by newly elected Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. She said she was surprised by her appointment as she had disagreed with Corbyn&#x27;s advocacy of unilateral nuclear disarmament and supported the renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons system. Tasked with leading Labour&#x27;s defence review, she said she would not rule out the possibility of it recommending unilateral disarmament. However, she described Corbyn commenting he would not countenance using a nuclear deterrent as &quot;unhelpful&quot; to the policy process.

In January 2016, Eagle was moved to the position of Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. She resigned from the shadow cabinet on 27 June 2016 in the mass resignation of the Shadow Cabinet following the Brexit referendum.

She supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

At the snap 2017 general election, Eagle was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 77.7% and an increased majority of 32,149. She was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 72.3% and a decreased majority of 31,624.

She is a supporter of Labour Friends of Israel.

On 15 February 2023, she was appointed as a member of the Privy Council.

In the 2023 British shadow cabinet reshuffle, she was appointed Shadow Minister for Procurement.

===Return to government===
Due to the 2023 review of Westminster constituencies, Eagle&#x27;s constituency of Garston and Halewood was abolished, and replaced with Liverpool Garston. At the 2024 general election, Eagle was elected to Parliament as MP for Liverpool Garston with 58.4% of the vote and a majority of 20,104. She was appointed as [[Minister of State for Defence Procurement and Industry] on 8 July.

In November 2024, Eagle voted in favour of the [[Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill]], which proposes to legalise [[Assisted suicide in the United Kingdom|assisted suicide]].

==Personal life==
Following her initial election, Eagle joined her twin sister [[Angela Eagle|Angela]] in Parliament. Maria describes herself as &quot;the straight one&quot;, while Angela is a lesbian.

<text>Clive Stanley Efford (born 10 July 1958) is a British Labour Party politician who has served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Eltham and Chislehurst, previously Eltham, since 1997.

==Early life==
Efford was born in London and educated at Walworth School and Southwark College. He worked in his family jewellery business, until he completed The Knowledge and qualified as London taxi driver in 1987. In 1986, he became an elected councillor in the London Borough of Greenwich, and continued in both these occupations until being elected to Parliament in 1997.

==Political career==
Efford was first elected to Greenwich Council in 1986 for the Eltham Well Hall Ward, becoming the Labour Group Chief Whip in 1990. After first contesting the seat of Eltham at the 1992 general election, he successfully won the seat five years later in 1997. He went on to win the seat at the ensuing general elections in 2001, 2005 and 2010, with his majority declining after each until the 2015 general election and increased further in 2017.

He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 25 June 1997. Almost as soon as he was elected, he was required to deal with the fallout from the family of murdered Eltham teenager Stephen Lawrence registering a formal complaint with the Police Complaints Authority, with the police officers in question facing allegations of racism.

In Parliament, he has served on a number of Select committees, most notably being a member of the Transport Select Committee from 2001 to 2008. In 2003, he was one of the Labour MPs who rebelled against the government and voted against UK involvement in the Iraq War. In 2005, Efford was responsible for the reformation of the previously defunct Tribune Group, though unlike its previous incarnation, membership was restricted to backbench Labour MPs. In 2008, he became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Housing Minister Margaret Beckett, later becoming the PPS to John Healey in the same role from 2009 to 2010.
He was one of the first MPs to declare his support for Ed Miliband, the successful candidate, in the 2010 Labour leadership election. Miliband subsequently appointed him to the Opposition Front Bench in 2011 as a Shadow Home Office Minister under new Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. In the reshuffle of October 2011, he became the Shadow Minister for Sport.

Clive Efford was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015 and he retained his position in Corbyn&#x27;s shadow cabinet. He resigned from Corbyn&#x27;s shadow cabinet following a large number of resignations from the Labour front bench on 28 June 2016. He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election.

Efford was shortlisted for the Grassroot Diplomat Initiative Award in 2015 for his work on National Health Service Bill, and he remains in the directory of the Grassroot Diplomat Who&#x27;s Who publication.

Efford relaunched the Tribune Group of MPs in April 2017, aiming to reconnect with traditional Labour voters while also appealing to the centre ground.

Efford endorsed Keir Starmer in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election.

In November 2024, Efford voted in favour of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which proposes to legalise assisted suicide.

<text>Dame Louise Joyce Ellman ( Rosenberg; born 14 November 1945) is a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool Riverside from 1997 to 2019. She is a member of the Labour Party.

Ellman was elected as a councillor on Lancashire County Council in 1970, becoming the Labour group leader in 1977 and serving as leader of the council from 1981 until her election to the House of Commons in 1997. She was Vice-Chair of Lancashire Enterprises and chaired the Transport Select Committee from 2008 to 2017.

Ellman has been actively involved in Jewish and pro-Israel organizations. She served as Chair of Labour Friends of Israel until February 2020 and was Honorary President of the Jewish Labour Movement. In 2016, she was appointed a Vice President of the Jewish Leadership Council. In October 2019, she resigned from the Labour Party over concerns about antisemitism in the party and a potential Jeremy Corbyn-led government but rejoined in 2021.

In recognition of her public service, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2018 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List.

==Early life and career==
Louise Joyce Rosenberg was born in Manchester to an observant Jewish family. Her father had a Lithuanian background. She was educated at the independent Manchester High School for Girls, before studying at the University of Hull where she received a BA in Sociology and History in 1967, and then studied Social Administration at the University of York where she was awarded a MPhil in 1972.
As a teenager, she was involved in the Labour Zionist movement, Habonim and, following university, spent a year in Israel at an Ulpan studying Hebrew, where she met her husband. From 1970 to 1976, she was worked in further education and at the Open University.

She was elected as a councillor on the Lancashire County Council in 1970, becoming the Labour group leader in 1977 and council leader from 1981 until her election to Parliament. She was Vice-Chair of Lancashire Enterprises.

She unsuccessfully contested the Darwen constituency at the 1979 general election.

==Parliamentary career==
She was elected to Parliament at the 1997 general election for the safe seat of Liverpool Riverside. She held the seat with a majority of 21,799 and has held the seat comfortably at successive general elections. When she was re-elected in 2001, the turnout was the lowest in the country at 34.1%.

===Positions and voting===
She was a member of the Transport Committee and its predecessor, Transport, Local Government and the Regions, since she was first elected. On 21 May 2008, she was selected to become the Chair of the Commons Transport Select Committee after the death of Gwyneth Dunwoody MP, being returned unopposed after the 2015 general election.

According to website Public Whip, Ellman repeatedly voted for the Iraq War, against an investigation into that war, and for renewal of Trident, Britain&#x27;s nuclear weapons programme. She very rarely voted against the Party line.

In the 2015 Labour Party leadership election, she nominated Liz Kendall.

She supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 leadership election.

===Israel===
Ellman was Chair of the Jewish Labour Movement from 2006 to 2016, after which she became its Honorary President. She was also Vice Chair of Labour Friends of Israel and succeeded Joan Ryan as Chair in August 2019. She said that she intended to remain a member of LFI following her resignation from the Labour Party. She was the chair of the All-Party Britain-Israel Parliamentary Group.

The &quot;Times of Israel&quot; called her &quot;tough-as-nails&quot; and &quot;an unabashed friend of Israel&quot;. According to one biographer in the &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Ellman can always be called on to defend Israel on the green benches&quot; (i.e. in Parliament). The &quot;Jewish Telegraph&quot; said &quot;Doughty Labour MP Louise Ellman is never scared to openly proclaim her Jewish identity and fight for Israel and against Islamic extremism at every Parliamentary opportunity&quot;. In September 2019, Ellman said she &quot;shared the fears&quot; of other Jews living in the UK about the prospect of a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn and understood why they &quot;would seriously consider leaving the country&quot;. In October 2019, she said &quot;I&#x27;m not absolutely convinced he will bring great danger to the Jewish community but I&#x27;m very concerned it is possible he could&quot;.

===Constituency party===
In 2016, Ellman said that a small number among the members who joined her constituency Labour party after Corbyn&#x27;s election as leader seemed &quot;obsessed on Middle East issues&quot;, that there had been a &quot;very unpleasant atmosphere&quot; in constituency meetings and that remarks which she considered were antisemitic had been made to her. She also alleged that the local Momentum group was acting as a &quot;party within a party&quot; and asked for her constituency party to be suspended and investigated. A leading local Momentum member rejected the allegations.

===2019 resignation from Labour Party===
In early October 2019, a motion of no confidence in Ellman, scheduled to take place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, was submitted for discussion at a branch of her constituency Labour Party. The timing of the motion was criticised by Ellman herself, who called it &quot;particularly insidious&quot;; and by Marie van der Zyl, President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, who said it meant that Ellman would have &quot;no opportunity even to respond&quot;. A Labour Party spokesperson said that no confidence motions &quot;had no formal standing&quot;, with another source intimating that the motion was unlikely to be taken to a vote. Two further motions of no confidence were later submitted for debate at other branches of the Liverpool Riverside CLP. The North-West Labour Party office later advised local branches that none of the motions should be discussed, citing the potential prejudicial effect that such discussion may have on the upcoming trigger ballot.

On 16 October 2019, Ellman resigned from the Labour Party, citing concerns that antisemitism had grown under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. She believed Jewish members faced bullying and abuse, while antisemitic views and conspiracy theories had spread. She also accused Corbyn of associating with antisemites and failing to challenge them. Labour responded by stating that both Corbyn and the party were committed to supporting the Jewish community and tackling antisemitism. Ellman’s Constituency Labour Party acknowledged her long service but noted her opposition to a Corbyn-led government made reselection unlikely. They cited political disagreements, including her support for the Iraq War and criticism of Corbyn, as reasons for the contest. While condemning antisemitism, they argued she misrepresented the local party and said many Jewish members did not share her views.

Ellman did not stand for re-election as an MP at the 2019 United Kingdom general election.

==Life after parliament==
On 27 September 2021, Ellman announced she was rejoining the Labour Party. She expressed her satisfaction with Keir Starmer&#x27;s leadership, saying he has “shown a willingness to confront both the anti-Jewish racists and the toxic culture which allowed antisemitism to flourish” in the party.

==Personal life and recognition==
Ellman has been married since 16 July 1967 to Geoffrey Ellman, a pharmacist. She lived in Leeds, then moved to Skelmersdale in 1969. The couple have a son, Sean, and a daughter, Yvonne, and five grandchildren.
(Her son Sean has repeatedly come to public attention for selling so-called &#x27;legal highs&#x27; in his chain of &#x27;head shops&#x27; across the northwest of England. In 2010 he was given an ASBO by a St Helens court to prevent such sales; in 2012 he was taken to court by authorities in Chester. Two years after his judge-directed acquittal on a legal technicality, the Sunday People newspaper exposed two more Ellman head shops in Manchester and Leeds, one for allegedly selling &quot;synthetic cocaine&quot;.)

She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2018 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for parliamentary and political services.

In 2019, the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; ranked her as the 23rd most influential Jew worldwide, calling her &#x27;Labour&#x27;s lady who opposes Corbyn&#x27; and noting that &#x27;she has been a strong advocate for Israel in the House of Commons&#x27;. She was the sole Briton on the 50-strong list.

She is a Vice President of the Jewish Leadership Council.

<text>Jeffrey Ennis (born 13 November 1952) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Barnsley East and Mexborough from 1996 to 2010, having been first elected at the Barnsley East by-election in 1996.

==Early life and education==

<text>The Dangerous Summer is a nonfiction book by Ernest Hemingway published posthumously in 1985 and written in 1959 and 1960. The book describes the rivalry between bullfighters Luis Miguel Dominguín and his brother-in-law, Antonio Ordóñez, during the &quot;dangerous summer&quot; of 1959. It is one of two books Hemingway wrote about bullfighting, the other being &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; (1932). &quot;The Dangerous Summer&quot; has been cited as the last book Hemingway wrote, although at the time of his death in 1961, he had several unfinished manuscripts which were later published by his family.

==Background==
&quot;The Dangerous Summer&quot; is an edited version of a 75,000-word manuscript Hemingway wrote between October 1959 and May 1960 as an assignment from &quot;Life&quot; magazine. Hemingway summoned his close friend Will Lang Jr. to come to Spain to deliver the story to &quot;Life&quot;. The book was edited from the original manuscript by his American publisher Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons. A 30,000-word extract from the script was published in three consecutive installments in &quot;Life&quot; in September 1960.

Author James Michener wrote the 33-page introduction which includes Michener&#x27;s personal knowledge of bullfights and famous matadors, a comprehensive glossary of terms related to each stage of a bullfight, and unvarnished personal anecdotes of Hemingway.

==Account of the season==

The book charts the rise of Antonio Ordóñez (the son of Cayetano Ordóñez, the bullfighter whose technique and ring exploits Hemingway fictionalized in his novel, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;) during a season of bullfights during 1959. During a fight on May 13, 1959, in Aranjuez, Ordóñez is badly gored but remains in the ring and kills the bull, a performance rewarded by trophies of both the bull&#x27;s ears, its tail, and a hoof.

By contrast, Luis Miguel Dominguín is already famous as a bullfighter and returns to the ring after several years of retirement. Less naturally gifted than Ordóñez, his pride and self-confidence draw him into an intense rivalry with the newcomer, and the two meet in the ring several times during the season. Starting the season supremely confident, Dominguín is slowly humbled by this competition. While Ordóñez displays breathtaking skill and artistry in his fights, performing highly dangerous, classical passés, Dominguín often resorts to what Hemingway describes as &quot;tricks&quot;, moves that look impressive to the crowd but that are actually much safer. Nevertheless, Dominguín is gored badly at a fight in Valencia, and Ordóñez is gored shortly afterwards. Less than a month later, the two bullfighters meet in the ring again for what Hemingway described as &quot;one of the greatest bullfights I have ever seen&quot;, &quot;an almost perfect bullfight unmarred by any tricks.&quot; From the six bulls which they fight, the pair win ten ears, four tails and two hooves as trophies, an extraordinary feat. Their final meeting takes place in Bilbao, with Dominguín receiving a near-fatal goring and Ordóñez demonstrating absolute mastery by performing the &quot;recibiendo&quot; kill, one of the oldest and most dangerous moves. Ordóñez&#x27;s &quot;recibiendo&quot; requires three attempts, displaying the fighter&#x27;s artistry and bravery that Hemingway likens to that of legendary bullfighter Pedro Romero.

<text>Nigel Martin Evans (born 10 November 1957) is a former British Conservative Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Ribble Valley in Lancashire from 1992 until 2024. He was Joint Executive Secretary of the 1922 Committee from 2017 to 2019. He served as First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means, one of the Speaker&#x27;s three deputies, from 2010 to 2013. He was elected as Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means in 2020.

Evans is a strong critic of the European Union and supported Brexit in the 2016 EU Referendum. He has since been supportive of Leave Means Leave, a Eurosceptic campaign group and backed Boris Johnson for Prime Minister. He thereafter refrained from campaigning on issues such as Brexit in order to fulfill his role as one of the deputy speakers, until he lost his seat in 2024.

==Early life and career==
Nigel Evans was born on 10 November 1957 in Swansea. He was educated at Dynevor School, and then went to Swansea University, where he gained a BA in politics in 1979. He was involved in the management of his family&#x27;s newsagent&#x27;s and convenience store in Swansea.

==Political career==
In 1985, Evans was elected as a councillor to the West Glamorgan County Council. In 1990, he became the deputy Conservative group leader, before standing down as a councillor in 1991. 

At the 1987 general election, Evans stood in Swansea West, coming second with 33% of the vote behind the incumbent Labour MP Alan Williams. 

Evans was selected to contest the 1989 Pontypridd by-election, following the death of Brynmor John. At the election, he came third with 13.5% of the vote behind the Labour candidate Kim Howells and the Plaid Cymru candidate Syd Morgan.

Evans also stood in the 1991 Ribble Valley by-election, caused by the resignation of David Waddington to become the Leader of the House of Lords in 1990. At the election, Evans came second with 38.5% of the vote behind the Liberal Democrat candidate Michael Carr.

== Parliamentary career ==
At the 1992 general election, Evans was elected to Parliament as MP for Ribble Valley with 52.4% of the vote and a majority of 6,542. He made his maiden speech on 20 May 1992.

Evans was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Secretary of State for Employment David Hunt in 1993, and remained Hunt&#x27;s PPS when he was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1994. In 1995, Evans became the PPS to Tony Baldry the Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1995, and in 1996, he became the PPS to the new Secretary of State for Wales William Hague.

At the 1997 general election, Evans was re-elected as MP for Ribble Valley with a decreased vote share of 46.7% and an increased majority of 6,640. After the election, Evans was drafted onto the frontbench by former prime minister John Major as a spokesman on Welsh Affairs. 

Evans was again re-elected at the 2001 general election, with an increased vote share of 51.5% and an increased majority of 11,238. He became a member of the Shadow Cabinet after the election under Iain Duncan Smith as the Shadow Secretary of State for Wales from 2001 to 2003. He had publicly criticised the government for not having a dedicated Secretary of State for Wales in a cabinet post, so when the new Conservative leader Michael Howard decided to take the role outside of the Shadow Cabinet, Evans chose to return to the backbenches.

He became a member of both the Trade and Industry and the Welsh Affairs Select committees in 2003. In November 2004, Evans was appointed a Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party, with specific responsibility for overseeing Conservatives Abroad and mobilising the Conservative vote overseas. 

At the 2005 general election, Evans was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 51.9% and an increased majority of 14,171.

He returned to the back benches on the election of David Cameron as party leader in 2005, deciding to dedicate more time to his work on the Council of Europe and Western European Union. He has been a member of the Culture Media and Sport Select Committee since 2005

In November 2009, Evans was ranked as the 570th most expensive MP out of the 646 MPs in the UK Parliament, based on his expenses claims. He was criticised for his £375 a month expense on phone bills, and his purchase of four digital cameras in 18 months. Evans later attracted criticism for saying that he struggled to live on his salary of over £64,000 per year. He responded by saying that the comments were made in jest.

Evans was again re-elected at the 2010 general election, with a decreased vote share of 50.3% and an increased majority of 14,769.

On 8 June 2010, Evans was elected First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means, and a Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. This was the first time the three Deputy Speakers had been elected by secret ballot of all MPs. 

At the 2015 general election, Evans was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 48.6% and a decreased majority of 13,606.

Evans supported Brexit in the 2016 European Union referendum.

Evans is a supporter of the proposal to make 23 June a public holiday in the United Kingdom, to be known as British Independence Day. Following a Parliamentary debate on the topic, the announcement from the UK government in October 2016 to not proceed with the holiday at present, he said it was &quot;a shame the government has made this decision, this is an absolute belter of an idea.&quot;

Evans was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election, with an increased vote share of 57.8% and a decreased majority of 13,199. At the 2019 general election, he was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 60.3% and an increased majority of 18,439.

On 8 January 2020, he was elected as Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means by the MPs.

Evans ran for re-election in the 2024 United Kingdom general election. He was defeated by Labour candidate Maya Ellis.

==Arrest and trial==
On 4 May 2013, Evans was arrested on suspicion of rape and sexual assault. His trial began on 10 March 2014. He was acquitted of all charges on 10 April 2014. In 2012, he had supported cuts to legal aid which became part of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO); after losing his life savings defending himself in 2014, Evans said in 2018 that the experience had shown him that &quot;It&#x27;s wrong, completely wrong, to remove people&#x27;s right to have expert legal representation ... We&#x27;re definitely talking about justice being denied as a result of LASPO.&quot; Hannah Quirk, a criminal law lecturer at King&#x27;s College London, referred to him as a victim of the so-called &#x27;innocence tax&#x27;.

==Personal life==
On 18 December 2010, following the death of his 86-year-old mother, Evans revealed to &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; that he was gay. He lives in Pendleton, Lancashire, a village in his constituency.

<text>The State and the Revolution: The Marxist Doctrine of the State and the Tasks of the Proletariat in the Revolution () is a book written by Vladimir Lenin and published in 1917 which describes his views on the role of the state in society, the necessity of proletarian revolution, and the theoretic inadequacies of social democracy in achieving revolution to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat.

== Background ==
Lenin began the composition of an early draft of &quot;The State and Revolution&quot; while in exile in Switzerland in 1916, under the title &quot;Marxism on the State&quot;.

&quot;Soviets&quot;, legislative bodies of workers and peasants, were the &quot;de facto&quot; governments of Petrograd and many smaller cities. The Russian public was deeply upset with the continuation of Russia&#x27;s involvement in World War I and the continued economic difficulties that it brought on. On November 7, the Congress of Soviets officially elected a coalition of Bolsheviks, Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks to govern. Through the Red Guards, paramilitary organizations of revolutionary workers, sailors, and soldiers, the Soviet government was able to storm the Winter Palace and officially abolish the Provisional Government. The revolution was not uniformly accepted among all Russians; resistance and disruption would occur routinely leading up to the Russian Civil War. A particular issue that Lenin covers in &quot;The State and Revolution&quot; was the right of nations to secession (&quot;the right to self-determination&quot;); during the composition of this book, the Mensheviks of Georgia declared independence soon after the Revolution, forming the Democratic Republic of Georgia.

By November 25, the 1917 Constitutional Assembly was elected with a majority of positions going to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which had made a right-ward turn after the revolution with most of the Left-SRs joining the Bolshevik party. In one of the most controversial actions of the early Soviet government, the constitutional convention was dissolved on January 20, 1918.

== Synopsis ==
&quot;The State and Revolution&quot; is considered to be Lenin&#x27;s most important work on the state and has been called by Lucio Colletti &quot;Lenin&#x27;s greatest contribution to political theory&quot;. According to the Marxologist David McLellan, &quot;the book had its origin in Lenin&#x27;s argument with Bukharin in the summer of 1916 over the existence of the state after a proletarian revolution. Bukharin had emphasised the &#x27;withering&#x27; aspect, whereas Lenin insisted on the necessity of the state machinery to expropriate the expropriators. In fact, it was Lenin who changed his mind, and many of the ideas of State and Revolution, composed in the summer of 1917 – particularly the anti-statist theme – were those of Bukharin&quot;.

Lenin&#x27;s direct and simple definition of the State is that &quot;the State is a special organisation of force: it is an organisation of violence for the suppression of some Social class.&quot; Hence his denigration even of parliamentary democracy, which was influenced by what Lenin saw as the recent increase of bureaucratic and military influences:

Citing Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx, Lenin investigates theoretical questions about the existence of the State after the proletarian revolution, addressing the arguments of anti-authoritarians, anarchists, social democrats, and reformists, in describing the progressive stages of societal change—the revolution, establishing “the lower stage of communist society” (the socialist commune), and the “higher stage of communist society” that will yield a stable society where personal freedom might be fully expressed.

Lenin especially defends Marx&#x27;s theory of communism, and Marxism generally; to wit, when old revolutionaries die, the bourgeoisie are not content with labelling them “enemies of the state”, because that would attract political radicals, so they attack the revolutionaries’ theoretic writings by ascribing to them an (anti-revolutionary) social-democratic mediocrity contrary to “the revolutionary nature of Marx”; such bourgeois intellectuals are the “revisionists” who transform a human being into an abstraction:

During the lifetime of great revolutionaries, the oppressing classes constantly hounded them, received their theories with the most savage malice, the most furious hatred, and the most unscrupulous campaigns of lies and slander. After their deaths, attempts are made to convert them into harmless icons, to canonize them, so to say, and to hallow their names, to a certain extent, for the ‘consolation’ of the oppressed classes, and with the object of duping the latter, while, at the same time, robbing the revolutionary theory of its substance, blunting its revolutionary edge, and vulgarizing it. Today, the bourgeoisie and the opportunists within the labour movement concur in this doctoring of Marxism. They omit, obscure, or distort the revolutionary side of this theory, its revolutionary soul. They push to the foreground and extol what is, or seems, acceptable to the bourgeoisie. All the social-chauvinists are now ‘Marxists’ (don’t laugh!). And more and more frequently, German bourgeois scholars, only yesterday specialists in the annihilation of Marxism, are speaking of the ‘national-German’ Marx, who, they claim, educated the labour unions, which are so splendidly organised for the purpose of waging a predatory war!

&quot;The State and Revolution&quot; describes the inherent nature of the State as a tool for class oppression, the creation of a social class&#x27;s desire to control the other social classes when politico-economic disputes cannot otherwise be peacefully resolved; whether a dictatorship or a democracy, the State remains the social-control means of the ruling class. Even in a democratic capitalist republic, the ruling class never relinquish political power, maintaining it via the “behind-the-scenes” control of universal suffrage—an excellent deception that maintains the idealistic concepts of “freedom and democracy”; hence, communist revolution is the sole remedy for such demagogy:

# The anarchists propose the State&#x27;s immediate abolishment; Lenin counter-proposes that such idealism is pragmatically impossible, because the proletariat would need to crush the bourgeois resistance through a mechanism, and that is the state.
# Were the State immediately abolished, without the “conditions leading to the arising of the State” being abolished as well, a new State would appear, and the socialist revolution would have been for naught.

In the event, the proletariat through the dictatorship of the proletariat would establish a communal State (per the 1871 Paris Commune model), then gradually suppress the dissenting bourgeoisie, in achieving the withering away of the State as its institutions begin to “lose their political character”.

Thus, following Marx&#x27;s conclusions on the Paris Commune, which Lenin took as his model. Lenin declared that the task of the Revolution was to smash the State. Although for a period under communism, &quot;there remains for a time not only bourgeois right but even the bourgeois State without the bourgeoisie,&quot; Lenin believed that after a successful proletarian revolution the state had not only begun to wither, but was in an advanced condition of decomposition. But Lenin also called the state &quot;the armed and ruling proletariat&quot; so McLellan asks whether this, too withers? Yes, according to McLellan, &quot;in so far as it was in any way a power separate from and opposed to, the masses&quot; Lenin had little to say of the institutional form of this transition period. There was a strong emphasis on the dictatorship of the proletariat: &quot;A Marxist is solely someone who extends the recognition of the class struggle to the recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is what constitutes the most profound distinction between the Marxist and the ordinary petty (as well as big) bourgeois. This is the touchstone on which the real understanding and recognition of Marxism is to be tested.&quot;

<text>Filiberto Ojeda Ríos (April 26, 1933 September 23, 2005) was a Puerto Rican independence activist who cofounded the Boricua Popular Army, also known as &quot;Los Macheteros,&quot; and its predecessor, the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña (FALN). In 1990, Ojeda Ríos became a fugitive of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), wanted for his role in the 1983 Águila Blanca heist, which netted more than million (equivalent to more than $million in ), as well as a bail bond default on September 23 of that year. On September 23, 2005, he was killed during an exchange of gunfire with FBI agents after they surrounded the house in Hormigueros, Puerto Rico.

The FBI operation in Hormigueros was questioned by local Puerto Rican authorities as well as international organizations. The killing of Ojeda Ríos resonated throughout the Puerto Rican community around the world. In response to questions raised in media accounts and by public officials in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, FBI director Robert Mueller requested an investigation by the United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General. The resulting report concluded that &quot;the FBI agents’ use of force in the Ojeda operation did not violate the Department of Justice Deadly Force Policy&quot; and that Ojeda Ríos had initiated the exchange of gunfire. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Civil Rights Commission subsequently conducted its own investigation of the incident and issued a report on 22 September 2011 wherein the Commission called Ojeda Ríos&#x27;s death an &quot;illegal killing&quot;.

Ojeda Ríos was born on April 26, 1933, in the barrio of Río Blanco in Naguabo, Puerto Rico to Inocencio Ojeda. Ojeda Ríos entered college when he was fifteen years old and was described as having an &quot;engaging intelligence&quot;. As a child, he played the trumpet and guitar. He joined La Sonora Ponceña, a salsa band from Ponce, Puerto Rico where he performed both instruments.

== Militant activities ==
In the 1960s, he founded the Armed Revolutionary Independence Movement, aka MIRA (&quot;Movimiento Independentista Revolucionario Armado&quot;).

The group was involved in the killing of a Puerto Rican policeman who refused to surrender his car.

The group was responsible for nearly 120 bombings in the United States between 1974 and 1983, including the 1975 bombing of the Fraunces Tavern in which four civilians were killed. On September 12, 1983, Los Macheteros stole more than million (equivalent to more than $million in ) from a Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford, Connecticut.

In 1989, a jury of 12 found Ojeda Ríos “innocent of all charges filed against him for shooting at FBI agents during his 1985 arrest.” He was released on bond after his attorneys successfully argued he had been denied a speedy trial, although the delay in bringing him to trial was largely the result of defense motions. On September 23, 1990, the anniversary of the Grito de Lares, Ojeda Ríos cut off the electronic tag that had been placed on his ankle as a condition of his release, and became a fugitive.

In July 1992, Ojeda Ríos was sentenced in absentia to 55 years in prison and fined $600,000 for his role in the Wells Fargo heist.

==Death==

On September 23, 2005, Ojeda Ríos was surrounded in his home in the outskirts of the town of Hormigueros, Puerto Rico by the FBI&#x27;s Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) and fatally shot. The HRT had recently received commando training in Iraq. 
The FBI recounted the incident in a press release where it emphasized the participation of the San Juan field office.

According to this document, the FBI was performing surveillance of the area driven by reports that Ojeda Ríos had been spotted in the home. The FBI determined its surveillance team had been detected, and decided to proceed with serving an arrest warrant against Ojeda Ríos. As the agents approached the home, Ojeda opened fire. One agent was wounded. The official report found &quot;this daylight assault was extremely dangerous and not the best option available to the FBI.&quot;

According to Ojeda Rios&#x27; wife, Elma Beatriz Rosado Barbosa, as well as neighbor Héctor Reyes, it was the FBI agents who initiated the shooting at 3:00 pm. The Office of the Inspector General&#x27;s report stated that an FBI agent detonated a non-lethal &quot;flash bang&quot; grenade outside the house as a diversionary tactic when the FBI approached the house, before any gunfire began, and that Rosado may have thought this explosion was gunfire initiated by the FBI. The FBI press release stated, &quot;as the FBI agents approached the front of the farm house at approximately 4:28 p.m., Ojeda Ríos opened the front door to the residence and opened fire on the FBI agents. In response to the gunfire from Ojeda Ríos, the FBI returned fire and established a defensive perimeter in order to contain the environment.&quot;

Rosado also alleged that Ojeda Ríos offered to turn himself in to journalist Jesús Dávila, but that his offer was rebuffed by the agents.

The Office of the Inspector General report concluded that &quot;although the FBI utilized a negotiator from its San Juan office during the standoff, the FBI did not comply with its own policies regarding the integration of negotiators into operations planning or the use of multiple negotiators.&quot;

The FBI did not enter the house until shortly after noon the next day, at which time the agents found Ojeda Ríos dead on the floor from a single bullet wound that had punctured his lung. The report by the U.S. Department of Justice stated, &quot;the forensic pathologist from the Puerto Rico Institute of Forensic Sciences who performed the autopsy estimated that Ojeda died from blood loss approximately 15 to 30 minutes after being shot, which would place the time of death between 6:23 p.m. and 6:38 p.m.&quot;. He was buried at Cementerio Municipal Barrio Rio Blanco in Naguabo, Puerto Rico.

== Aftermath ==

The report by the Puerto Rico Commission on Civil Rights states that Rodríguez Morales, one of the two forensic pathologists that performed the autopsy, declared that &quot;as a pathologist she cannot &#x27;say at what precise time&#x27; Ojeda Ríos died, what can be given is an estimate of the number of hours that he had been dead.&quot; She added she did not believe that a person of 72 years, who had had open heart surgery, could have survived an hour.

The FBI was criticized for failing to notify Commonwealth of Puerto Rico officials in advance of the Ojeda Ríos arrest operation by the Commission on Civil Rights, but the OIG report &quot;determined that the FBI made the decision not to notify Puerto Rico officials of the operation because of concerns about leaks that could compromise the operation, which was a reasonable consideration under the circumstances.&quot; The report found that the &quot;FBI missed opportunities to provide accurate information to the public and to Commonwealth officials regarding the reasons for the delay in entering Ojeda&#x27;s residence&quot; but that the delayed entry itself was justified.

Politicians across party lines in Puerto Rico criticized the handling of the event. Sitting governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá criticized the FBI assault as &quot;improper&quot; and &quot;highly irregular&quot; and demanded to know why his government was not informed beforehand. The FBI refused to release information beyond the official press release, citing security and agent privacy issues. Three Puerto Rican members of the U.S. Congress demanded the release of more specific, and more responsive, FBI information. Amnesty International demanded an independent investigation into the possibility of &quot;extra-judicial execution&quot; in the case. A United Nations General Assembly Special Committee resolution labeled the killing an &quot;assassination&quot;.

The Puerto Rico Department of Justice filed suit in federal court against the FBI and the US Attorney General, demanding information crucial to the Commonwealth&#x27;s own investigation of the incident. In late March 2006, the Department sued federal authorities, including Mueller and US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, seeking an injunction to force the federal government authorities to provide the Commonwealth government with information related to the operation in which Ojeda Ríos died, as well as another one in which the FBI searched the homes of independence supporters affiliated with Los Macheteros. A U.S. District Court judge ruled against the Puerto Rico Department of Justice. The case was subsequently appealed to a federal appeals court which ruled that &quot;disclosing information on the Ojeda raid &#x27;would reveal how the FBI goes about capturing a fugitive who is believed to be dangerous.&#x27;&quot; The Commonwealth Government then took the case to the United States Supreme Court but &quot;the Supreme Court...refused to consider [the] lawsuit by Puerto Rico seeking FBI files in the killing of Puerto Rican independence supporter Filiberto Ojeda Rios.&quot;

In response to questions raised in media accounts and by public officials in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, FBI Director Robert Mueller requested an investigation by the Office of the Inspector General of the United States Department of Justice. The resulting report concluded that &quot;the FBI agents’ use of force in the Ojeda operation did not violate the Department of Justice Deadly Force Policy&quot; and that Ojeda Ríos had initiated the exchange of gunfire. In clearing the FBI, the report found that Ojeda Ríos &quot;clearly posed a threat to the agents&quot; and was shot only after refusing to surrender when he was seen aiming a pistol at an agent.

==In popular culture==
The hip hop musical group Calle 13 wrote the song &quot;Querido FBI&quot; (&quot;Dear FBI&quot;), to protest the manner of Ojeda Ríos&#x27; death at the hands of the FBI. Singer-songwriter Mikie Rivera has composed two songs inspired by Ojeda Ríos: &quot;HF&quot; and &quot;Piedra y bala&quot;. In April 2018, a feature-length biographic documentary entitled &quot;Filiberto&quot; was made about him, directed by Freddie Marrero Alfonso.

<text>The is a high-speed shinkansen service between and in Japan, operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) since March 1997. It is the only shinkansen service that runs on the Akita Shinkansen, and uses E6 series trains. Between Tokyo Station and , it couples with Tōhoku Shinkansen E5 series &quot;Hayabusa&quot; and formerly E2 series for E3 series respectively. After Morioka, the &quot;Komachi&quot; service continues along standard gauge tracks that were converted from narrow gauge. Because it then runs on tracks that have grade crossings, its maximum speed from Morioka to Akita is , compared to on the Tohoku Shinkansen.

The &quot;Komachi&quot; service was named after a famous poet from the area, Ono no Komachi, whose name (小町) is also synonymous with &quot;belle&quot; or &quot;beauty&quot; in Japanese.

==Station stops==
&quot;Komachi&quot; services stop at the following stations on the Akita Shinkansen between Morioka and Akita. For details of station stops between Tokyo and Morioka, see the &quot;Hayabusa&quot; articles.

(*) Not served by all trains.

==Train formations==

Since 15 March 2014, most &quot;Komachi&quot; services have operated by seven-car E6 series trainsets with running at a maximum speed of on the Tohoku Shinkansen coupled to E5 series &quot;Hayabusa&quot; trainsets. Car 11, the &quot;Green&quot; (first class) car, is at the Tokyo end. All seats are reserved and no-smoking.

===E3 series===

&quot;Komachi&quot; services were also operated by five-car E3 series trainsets (later augmented to six cars). These sets were formed as shown below, with car 11, the &quot;Green&quot; (first class) car, at the Tokyo end. All seats were reserved and no-smoking.

==Accommodation==
==History==
&quot;Komachi&quot; services began on the newly opened Akita Shinkansen line from the start of the revised timetable on 22 March 1997 using a fleet of 16 new 5-car E3 series trains running at a maximum speed of on the Tohoku Shinkansen. The name &quot;Komachi&quot; was officially announced in July 1996. Services initially consisted of 13 return workings daily between Tokyo and Akita, and one return working between Sendai and Akita. Most trains ran coupled with 200 series &quot;Yamabiko&quot; trainsets between Tokyo and Morioka, but three return workings ran coupled with newly introduced E2 series sets, running at a maximum speed of between Utsunomiya and Morioka, and giving a fastest journey time of 3 hours 49 minutes between Tokyo and Akita (an average speed of 163.4 km/h). The train services proved popular, and from the December 1998 timetable revision, an addition return working was added, and the E3 series trains were lengthened to six cars each. From the December 1999 timetable, all &quot;Komachi&quot; services ran together with E2 series &quot;Yamabiko&quot; trains, allowing overall journey times to be reduced, with a typical journey time of 4 hours 4 minutes.

From 16 March 2013, new services started, using new E6 series trains running at a maximum speed of on the Tohoku Shinkansen. Initially, a fleet of four trains was used to operate four return services daily between Tokyo and Akita. The fastest journey time was reduced to 3 hours 45 minutes, 5 minutes faster than the fastest previous &quot;Komachi&quot; services. From the start of the revised timetable on 15 March 2014, all services were operated by E6 series trains, and the name was returned to simply &quot;Komachi&quot;. At the same time, the maximum speed on the Tohoku Shinkansen (on the section between Utsunomiya and Morioka) was further raised to .

<doc id="420157" wikidata="Q333474" url="?curid=420157" title="Quentin Davies">
<text>John Quentin Davies, Baron Davies of Stamford (29 May 1944 – 13 January 2025) was a British Labour politician and life peer who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Grantham and Stamford from 1987 to 2010. He served as a junior defence minister in the Brown ministry from 2008 to 2010.

A Conservative until his high-profile defection in 2007, Davies was a member of Iain Duncan Smith&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet from 2001 to 2003 as the Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary.

==Early life and education==
Quentin Davies was born in Oxford, the son of a doctor who had served in the Royal Air Force in the Second World War. 

He was educated: firstly at the Dragon School, a preparatory school in Oxford, and then at the Quaker Leighton Park School at Reading.

Davies then studied at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating with a first class Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1966. After graduating he became a Frank Knox Fellow at Harvard University.

==Career==
===Diplomat===
After his education, he joined the diplomatic service and was appointed Third Secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1967, and became a Second Secretary at HM Embassy Moscow in 1969, before returning to London as one of several First Secretaries at the Foreign Office in 1972.

===Merchant banker===
Davies left the diplomatic service in 1974 when he joined Morgan Grenfell. In turn he was an assistant director, the president of the firm in France in 1978, and a director of the international company in 1981, in which capacity he remained until his election to Parliament in 1987. He continued as a consultant to Morgan Grenfell until 1993.

===Politician===
Davies contested the 1977 Birmingham Ladywood by-election for the Conservatives. The by-election, caused by the resignation of Brian Walden, was won by Labour&#x27;s John Sever with a majority of 3,825. He was elected to the House of Commons ten years later at the 1987 General Election for the safe Conservative seat of Stamford and Spalding on the retirement of the sitting MP, Kenneth Lewis. Davies held the seat with a majority of 13,991 votes. The constituency was abolished in 1997, and he represented the redrawn seat of Grantham and Stamford until his retirement from the House of Commons at the 2010 General Election.

In Parliament, he was appointed the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science Angela Rumbold in 1988, and remained her PPS in her incarnation as the Minister at the Home Office. After the 1992 General Election he was a member of the Treasury Committee until he was promoted to the Opposition frontbench by William Hague in 1998 as a spokesman on social security, moving in 1999 to speak on Treasury matters, moving again in 2000 as a spokesman on defence. After the 2001 General Election he joined the Shadow Cabinet of Iain Duncan Smith, even though he had backed Kenneth Clarke&#x27;s leadership bid. Under Iain Duncan Smith, he became the Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, continuing until the election of Michael Howard in 2003, when he became a member of the International Development Committee, a role that he continued in until he joined the Labour Party in 2007.

Prior to becoming a Minister, Davies held many directorships and consultancies with several companies. He was awarded the &#x27;Parliamentarian of the Year Award&#x27; by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1996, the same year he was named &#x27;Backbencher of the Year&#x27; by BBC Radio 4. He was the Chairman of the Conservative Group for Europe from March 2006 until his defection to Labour in June 2007. In 1991, he was fined on two charges of animal cruelty, having been legally responsible for his farm employees’ failure to feed the sheep on his estate. Following his conviction and the immediate dismissal of the shepherd who had been left in charge, he was greeted by Labour MPs with calls of &#x27;Baaa!&#x27;

Davies announced in 2010 that he would not stand for re-election in the coming general election. At the general election of 6 May 2010, Nick Boles, a Conservative (later an independent Conservative), was elected in his place. On 28 May 2010 it was announced Davies would be made a life peer in the Dissolution Honours List and he was created Baron Davies of Stamford, &quot;of Stamford in the county of Lincolnshire&quot; on 7 July.

====Move from Conservative Party to Labour Party====
Davies left the Conservative Party to join the Labour Party benches on 26 June 2007, the night before Gordon Brown became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Davies made his decision public in a letter to the Conservative leader David Cameron in which he wrote: &quot;Under your leadership the Conservative Party appears to me to have ceased collectively to believe in anything, or to stand for anything. It has no bedrock. It exists on shifting sands. A sense of mission has been replaced by a PR agenda.&quot; He went on, &quot;I am looking forward to joining another party...which has just acquired a leader I have always greatly admired, who I believe is entirely straightforward, and who has a towering record, and a clear vision for the future of our country which I fully share.&quot; He accused Cameron of &quot;superficiality, unreliability and an apparent lack of any clear convictions.&quot; He said that these qualities ought to &quot;exclude you from the position of national leadership to which you aspire and which it is the presumed purpose of the Conservative Party to achieve.&quot;

Two years prior to his defection, in a speech in the House of Commons Davies described Gordon Brown as &quot;extraordinarily incompetent&quot;, &quot;imprudent&quot;, &quot;extraordinarily naïve&quot; and said in conclusion &quot;I trust and believe that something nasty will happen to the Chancellor in electoral terms before too long. He will have no one but himself to blame.&quot;

====Criticism of Ministry of Defence&#x27;s attitude to war equipment====
On 5 October 2008, Davies was promoted to the government, becoming a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence Equipment and Support at the Ministry of Defence. Davies replaced Lady Taylor as both Parliamentary Under-Secretary and Defence Procurement Minister. Davies came under fire less than a month after taking over the Defence Equipment brief when an SAS reservist commander in Afghanistan resigned because of what he described as a &#x27;chronic underinvestment&#x27; in troops&#x27; equipment and called the government&#x27;s attitude to the consideration of the lack of military equipment &#x27;cavalier at best, criminal at worst&#x27;.

Major Sebastien Morley resigned after four soldiers under his command were killed whilst serving in the Army&#x27;s Snatch Land Rovers which are lightly armoured and cannot withstand roadside bombs; the Snatches have been described as &#x27;mobile coffins&#x27; by the soldiers. The government subsequently ordered new armoured vehicles to the areas in an effort to increase the security of those serving in the warzone and indeed to prevent more troop fatalities.

Davies added it was not the attitude of the government to be dismissive of the lives of British soldiers and he said it was &#x27;very surprising and sad&#x27; to hear the claims of the former SAS commander and when on visiting troops in Afghanistan recently all those he spoke to were pleased with the equipment supplied. He said: &quot;Obviously, there may be occasions when, in retrospect, a commander chose the wrong piece of equipment, the wrong vehicle, for the particular threat that the patrol or whatever it was encountered and we had some casualties as a result.&quot; The comment drew much criticism from fellow MPs and family members of military personnel for the lack of sensitivity.

In 2009, during the row over parliamentary expenses, the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; stated that Davies claimed £10,000 for repairs to window frames at his &quot;second home&quot;, an 18th-century mansion, while staying at his &quot;main home&quot;, a flat in Westminster. In 2008, his Member&#x27;s Claim Form for Additional Costs Allowance was filled out with a figure of £20,700 relating to maintenance to a Bell Tower. The form was later amended to read £5,376. Davies&#x27; total expense claims were often higher than the average of all MPs.
==Personal life and death==
Davies married Chantal Tamplin (daughter of Lt.Col. Richard Tamplin) in 1983 at St Andrew&#x27;s church in Irnham, Lincolnshire; she was his Parliamentary Assistant and they have two sons (Alexander born May 1987 and Nicholas in August 1988). They lived at Frampton Hall (built in 1725 by Coney Tunnard) in Frampton, in the borough of Boston.

In January 2010, Quentin Davies&#x27;s niece, former model Jessica Davies, was found guilty of murder in Paris and sentenced to 15 years in jail after admitting to stabbing to death a man in her apartment. She was reportedly high on drink and drugs at the time of the murder.

Quentin Davies died on 13 January 2025, at the age of 80.

<doc id="420159" wikidata="Q1207340" url="?curid=420159" title="Item response theory">
<text>In psychometrics, item response theory (IRT, also known as latent trait theory, strong true score theory, or modern mental test theory) is a paradigm for the design, analysis, and scoring of tests, questionnaires, and similar instruments measuring abilities, attitudes, or other variables. It is a theory of testing based on the relationship between individuals&#x27; performances on a test item and the test takers&#x27; levels of performance on an overall measure of the ability that item was designed to measure. Several different statistical models are used to represent both item and test taker characteristics. Unlike simpler alternatives for creating scales and evaluating questionnaire responses, it does not assume that each item is equally difficult. This distinguishes IRT from, for instance, Likert scaling, in which &quot;&quot;&quot;All items are assumed to be replications of each other or in other words items are considered to be parallel instruments&quot;. By contrast, item response theory treats the difficulty of each item (the item characteristic curves, or ICCs) as information to be incorporated in scaling items.

It is based on the application of related mathematical models to testing data. Because it is often regarded as superior to classical test theory, it is the preferred method for developing scales in the United States, especially when optimal decisions are demanded, as in so-called high-stakes tests, e.g., the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT).

The name &quot;item response theory&quot; is due to the focus of the theory on the item, as opposed to the test-level focus of classical test theory. Thus IRT models the response of each examinee of a given ability to each item in the test. The term &quot;item&quot; is generic, covering all kinds of informative items. They might be multiple choice questions that have incorrect and correct responses, but are also commonly statements on questionnaires that allow respondents to indicate level of agreement (a rating or Likert scale), or patient symptoms scored as present/absent, or diagnostic information in complex systems.

IRT is based on the idea that the probability of a correct/keyed response to an item is a mathematical function of person and item parameters. (The expression &quot;a mathematical function of person and item parameters&quot; is analogous to Lewin&#x27;s equation, &quot;B = f(P, E)&quot;, which asserts that behavior is a function of the person in their environment.) The person parameter is construed as (usually) a single latent trait or dimension. Examples include general intelligence or the strength of an attitude. Parameters on which items are characterized include their difficulty (known as &quot;location&quot; for their location on the difficulty range); discrimination (slope or correlation), representing how steeply the rate of success of individuals varies with their ability; and a pseudoguessing parameter, characterising the (lower) asymptote at which even the least able persons will score due to guessing (for instance, 25% for a pure chance on a multiple choice item with four possible responses).

In the same manner, IRT can be used to measure human behavior in online social networks. The views expressed by different people can be aggregated to be studied using IRT. Its use in classifying information as misinformation or true information has also been evaluated.

==Overview==

The concept of the item response function was around before 1950. The pioneering work of IRT as a theory occurred during the 1950s and 1960s. Three of the pioneers were the Educational Testing Service psychometrician Frederic M. Lord, the Danish mathematician Georg Rasch, and Austrian sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld, who pursued parallel research independently. Key figures who furthered the progress of IRT include Benjamin Drake Wright and David Andrich. IRT did not become widely used until the late 1970s and 1980s, when practitioners were told the &quot;usefulness&quot; and &quot;advantages&quot; of IRT on the one hand, and personal computers gave many researchers access to the computing power necessary for IRT on the other. In the 1990&#x27;s Margaret Wu developed two item response software programs that analyse PISA and TIMSS data; ACER ConQuest (1998) and the R-package TAM (2010).

Among other things, the purpose of IRT is to provide a framework for evaluating how well assessments work, and how well individual items on assessments work. The most common application of IRT is in education, where psychometricians use it for developing and designing exams, maintaining banks of items for exams, and equating the difficulties of items for successive versions of exams (for example, to allow comparisons between results over time).

IRT models are often referred to as &quot;latent trait models&quot;. The term &quot;latent&quot; is used to emphasize that discrete item responses are taken to be &quot;observable manifestations&quot; of hypothesized traits, constructs, or attributes, not directly observed, but which must be inferred from the manifest responses. Latent trait models were developed in the field of sociology, but are virtually identical to IRT models.

IRT is generally claimed as an improvement over classical test theory (CTT). For tasks that can be accomplished using CTT, IRT generally brings greater flexibility and provides more sophisticated information. Some applications, such as computerized adaptive testing, are enabled by IRT and cannot reasonably be performed using only classical test theory. Another advantage of IRT over CTT is that the more sophisticated information IRT provides allows a researcher to improve the reliability of an assessment.

IRT entails three assumptions:

# A unidimensional trait denoted by formula_1 ;
# Local independence of items;
# The response of a person to an item can be modeled by a mathematical &quot;item response function&quot; (IRF).

The trait is further assumed to be measurable on a scale (the mere existence of a test assumes this), typically set to a standard scale with a mean of 0.0 and a standard deviation of 1.0. Unidimensionality should be interpreted as homogeneity, a quality that should be defined or empirically demonstrated in relation to a given purpose or use, but not a quantity that can be measured. &#x27;Local independence&#x27; means (a) that the chance of one item being used is not related to any other item(s) being used and (b) that response to an item is each and every test-taker&#x27;s independent decision, that is, there is no cheating or pair or group work. The topic of dimensionality is often investigated with factor analysis, while the IRF is the basic building block of IRT and is the center of much of the research and literature.

==The item response function==
The IRF gives the probability that a person with a given ability level will answer correctly. Persons with lower ability have less of a chance, while persons with high ability are very likely to answer correctly; for example, students with higher math ability are more likely to get a math item correct. The exact value of the probability depends, in addition to ability, on a set of &quot;item parameters&quot; for the IRF.

===Three parameter logistic model===

For example, in the three parameter logistic model (3PL), the probability of a correct response to a dichotomous item &quot;i&quot;, usually a multiple-choice question, is:

formula_2

where formula_1 indicates that the person&#x27;s abilities are modeled as a sample from a normal distribution for the purpose of estimating the item parameters. After the item parameters have been estimated, the abilities of individual people are estimated for reporting purposes. formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6 are the item parameters. The item parameters determine the shape of the IRF. Figure 1 depicts an ideal 3PL ICC.

The item parameters can be interpreted as changing the shape of the standard logistic function:
formula_7
In brief, the parameters are interpreted as follows (dropping subscripts for legibility); &quot;b&quot; is most basic, hence listed first:
* &quot;b&quot; – difficulty, item location: formula_8 the half-way point between formula_6 (min) and 1 (max), also where the slope is maximized.
* &quot;a&quot; – discrimination, scale, slope: the maximum slope formula_10
* &quot;c&quot; – pseudo-guessing, chance, asymptotic minimum formula_11
If formula_12 then these simplify to formula_13 and formula_14 meaning that &quot;b&quot; equals the 50% success level (difficulty), and &quot;a&quot; (divided by four) is the maximum slope (discrimination), which occurs at the 50% success level. Further, the logit (log odds) of a correct response is formula_15 (assuming formula_16): in particular if ability &quot;θ&quot; equals difficulty &quot;b,&quot; there are even odds (1:1, so logit 0) of a correct answer, the greater the ability is above (or below) the difficulty the more (or less) likely a correct response, with discrimination &quot;a&quot; determining how rapidly the odds increase or decrease with ability.

In other words, the standard logistic function has an asymptotic minimum of 0 (formula_16), is centered around 0 (formula_18, formula_19), and has maximum slope formula_20 The formula_21 parameter stretches the horizontal scale, the formula_22 parameter shifts the horizontal scale, and the formula_23 parameter compresses the vertical scale from formula_24 to formula_25 This is elaborated below.

The parameter formula_5 represents the item location which, in the case of attainment testing, is referred to as the item difficulty. It is the point on formula_1 where the IRF has its maximum slope, and where the value is half-way between the minimum value of formula_6 and the maximum value of 1. The example item is of medium difficulty since formula_5=0.0, which is near the center of the distribution. Note that this model scales the item&#x27;s difficulty and the person&#x27;s trait onto the same continuum. Thus, it is valid to talk about an item being about as hard as Person A&#x27;s trait level or of a person&#x27;s trait level being about the same as Item Y&#x27;s difficulty, in the sense that successful performance of the task involved with an item reflects a specific level of ability.

The item parameter formula_4 represents the discrimination of the item: that is, the degree to which the item discriminates between persons in different regions on the latent continuum. This parameter characterizes the slope of the IRF where the slope is at its maximum. The example item has formula_4=1.0, which discriminates fairly well; persons with low ability do indeed have a much smaller chance of correctly responding than persons of higher ability. This discrimination parameter corresponds to the weighting coefficient of the respective item or indicator in a standard weighted linear (Ordinary Least Squares, OLS) regression and hence can be used to create a weighted index of indicators for unsupervised measurement of an underlying latent concept.

For items such as multiple choice items, the parameter formula_6 is used in attempt to account for the effects of guessing on the probability of a correct response. It indicates the probability that very low ability individuals will get this item correct by chance, mathematically represented as a lower asymptote. A four-option multiple choice item might have an IRF like the example item; there is a 1/4 chance of an extremely low ability candidate guessing the correct answer, so the formula_6 would be approximately 0.25. This approach assumes that all options are equally plausible, because if one option made no sense, even the lowest ability person would be able to discard it, so IRT parameter estimation methods take this into account and estimate a formula_6 based on the observed data.

==IRT models==
Broadly speaking, IRT models can be divided into two families: unidimensional and multidimensional. Unidimensional models require a single trait (ability) dimension formula_1. Multidimensional IRT models model response data hypothesized to arise from multiple traits. However, because of the greatly increased complexity, the majority of IRT research and applications utilize a unidimensional model.

IRT models can also be categorized based on the number of scored responses. The typical multiple choice item is &quot;dichotomous&quot;; even though there may be four or five options, it is still scored only as correct/incorrect (right/wrong). Another class of models apply to &quot;polytomous&quot; outcomes, where each response has a different score value. A common example of this is Likert-type items, e.g., &quot;Rate on a scale of 1 to 5.&quot; Another example is partial-credit scoring, to which models like the Polytomous Rasch model may be applied.

===Number of IRT parameters===
Dichotomous IRT models are described by the number of parameters they make use of. The 3PL is named so because it employs three item parameters. The two-parameter model (2PL) assumes that the data have no guessing, but that items can vary in terms of location (formula_5) and discrimination (formula_4). The one-parameter model (1PL) assumes that guessing is a part of the ability and that all items that fit the model have equivalent discriminations, so that items are only described by a single parameter (formula_5). This results in one-parameter models having the property of specific objectivity, meaning that the rank of the item difficulty is the same for all respondents independent of ability, and that the rank of the person ability is the same for items independently of difficulty. Thus, 1 parameter models are sample independent, a property that does not hold for two-parameter and three-parameter models. Additionally, there is theoretically a four-parameter model (4PL), with an upper asymptote, denoted by formula_39 where formula_40 in the 3PL is replaced by formula_41. However, this is rarely used. Note that the alphabetical order of the item parameters does not match their practical or psychometric importance; the location/difficulty (formula_5) parameter is clearly most important because it is included in all three models. The 1PL uses only formula_5, the 2PL uses formula_5 and formula_4, the 3PL adds formula_6, and the 4PL adds formula_47.

The 2PL is equivalent to the 3PL model with formula_48, and is appropriate for testing items where guessing the correct answer is highly unlikely, such as fill-in-the-blank items (&quot;What is the square root of 121?&quot;), or where the concept of guessing does not apply, such as personality, attitude, or interest items (e.g., &quot;I like Broadway musicals. Agree/Disagree&quot;).

The 1PL assumes not only that guessing is not present (or irrelevant), but that all items are equivalent in terms of discrimination, analogous to a common factor analysis with identical loadings for all items. Individual items or individuals might have secondary factors but these are assumed to be mutually independent and collectively orthogonal.

===Logistic and normal IRT models===
An alternative formulation constructs IRFs based on the normal probability distribution; these are sometimes called &quot;normal ogive models&quot;. For example, the formula for a two-parameter normal-ogive IRF is:

formula_49

where Φ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

The normal-ogive model derives from the assumption of normally distributed measurement error and is theoretically appealing on that basis. Here formula_5 is, again, the difficulty parameter. The discrimination parameter is formula_51, the standard deviation of the measurement error for item &quot;i&quot;, and comparable to 1/&quot;formula_4.

One can estimate a normal-ogive latent trait model by factor-analyzing a matrix of tetrachoric correlations between items. This means it is technically possible to estimate a simple IRT model using general-purpose statistical software.

With rescaling of the ability parameter, it is possible to make the 2PL logistic model closely approximate the cumulative normal ogive. Typically, the 2PL logistic and normal-ogive IRFs differ in probability by no more than 0.01 across the range of the function. The difference is greatest in the distribution tails, however, which tend to have more influence on results.

The latent trait/IRT model was originally developed using normal ogives, but this was considered too computationally demanding for the computers at the time (1960s). The logistic model was proposed as a simpler alternative, and has enjoyed wide use since. More recently, however, it was demonstrated that, using standard polynomial approximations to the normal CDF&quot;,&quot; the normal-ogive model is no more computationally demanding than logistic models.

===The Rasch model===
The Rasch model is often considered to be the 1PL IRT model. However, proponents of Rasch modeling prefer to view it as a completely different approach to conceptualizing the relationship between data and theory. Like other statistical modeling approaches, IRT emphasizes the primacy of the fit of a model to observed data, while the Rasch model emphasizes the primacy of the requirements for fundamental measurement, with adequate data-model fit being an important but secondary requirement to be met before a test or research instrument can be claimed to measure a trait. Operationally, this means that the IRT approaches include additional model parameters to reflect the patterns observed in the data (e.g., allowing items to vary in their correlation with the latent trait), whereas in the Rasch approach, claims regarding the presence of a latent trait can only be considered valid when both (a) the data fit the Rasch model, and (b) test items and examinees conform to the model. Therefore, under Rasch models, misfitting responses require diagnosis of the reason for the misfit, and may be excluded from the data set if one can explain substantively why they do not address the latent trait. Thus, the Rasch approach can be seen to be a confirmatory approach, as opposed to exploratory approaches that attempt to model the observed data.

The presence or absence of a guessing or pseudo-chance parameter is a major and sometimes controversial distinction. The IRT approach includes a left asymptote parameter to account for guessing in multiple choice examinations, while the Rasch model does not because it is assumed that guessing adds randomly distributed noise to the data. As the noise is randomly distributed, it is assumed that, provided sufficient items are tested, the rank-ordering of persons along the latent trait by raw score will not change, but will simply undergo a linear rescaling. By contrast, three-parameter IRT achieves data-model fit by selecting a model that fits the data, at the expense of sacrificing specific objectivity.

In practice, the Rasch model has at least two principal advantages in comparison to the IRT approach. The first advantage is the primacy of Rasch&#x27;s specific requirements, which (when met) provides &quot;fundamental&quot; person-free measurement (where persons and items can be mapped onto the same invariant scale). Another advantage of the Rasch approach is that estimation of parameters is more straightforward in Rasch models due to the presence of sufficient statistics, which in this application means a one-to-one mapping of raw number-correct scores to Rasch formula_1 estimates.

==Analysis of model fit==

As with any use of mathematical models, it is important to assess the fit of the data to the model. If item misfit with any model is diagnosed as due to poor item quality, for example confusing distractors in a multiple-choice test, then the items may be removed from that test form and rewritten or replaced in future test forms. If, however, a large number of misfitting items occur with no apparent reason for the misfit, the construct validity of the test will need to be reconsidered and the test specifications may need to be rewritten. Thus, misfit provides invaluable diagnostic tools for test developers, allowing the hypotheses upon which test specifications are based to be empirically tested against data.

There are several methods for assessing fit, such as a Chi-square statistic, or a standardized version of it. Two and three-parameter IRT models adjust item discrimination, ensuring improved data-model fit, so fit statistics lack the confirmatory diagnostic value found in one-parameter models, where the idealized model is specified in advance.

Data should not be removed on the basis of misfitting the model, but rather because a construct relevant reason for the misfit has been diagnosed, such as a non-native speaker of English taking a science test written in English. Such a candidate can be argued to not belong to the same population of persons depending on the dimensionality of the test, and, although one parameter IRT measures are argued to be sample-independent, they are not population independent, so misfit such as this is construct relevant and does not invalidate the test or the model. Such an approach is an essential tool in instrument validation. In two and three-parameter models, where the psychometric model is adjusted to fit the data, future administrations of the test must be checked for fit to the same model used in the initial validation in order to confirm the hypothesis that scores from each administration generalize to other administrations. If a different model is specified for each administration in order to achieve data-model fit, then a different latent trait is being measured and test scores cannot be argued to be comparable between administrations.

==Information==
One of the major contributions of item response theory is the extension of the concept of reliability. Traditionally, reliability refers to the precision of measurement (i.e., the degree to which measurement is free of error). Traditionally, it is measured using a single index defined in various ways, such as the ratio of true and observed score variance. This index is helpful in characterizing a test&#x27;s average reliability, for example in order to compare two tests. But IRT makes it clear that precision is not uniform across the entire range of test scores. Scores at the edges of the test&#x27;s range, for example, generally have more error associated with them than scores closer to the middle of the range.

Item response theory advances the concept of item and test information to replace reliability. Information is also a &quot;function&quot; of the model parameters. For example, according to Fisher information theory, the item information supplied in the case of the 1PL for dichotomous response data is simply the probability of a correct response multiplied by the probability of an incorrect response, or,

formula_54

The standard error of estimation (SE) is the reciprocal of the test information of at a given trait level, is the

formula_55

Thus more information implies less error of measurement.

For other models, such as the two and three parameters models, the discrimination parameter plays an important role in the function. The item information function for the two parameter model is

formula_56

The item information function for the three parameter model is

formula_57

In general, item information functions tend to look bell-shaped. Highly discriminating items have tall, narrow information functions; they contribute greatly but over a narrow range. Less discriminating items provide less information but over a wider range.

Plots of item information can be used to see how much information an item contributes and to what portion of the scale score range. Because of local independence, item information functions are additive. Thus, the test information function is simply the sum of the information functions of the items on the exam. Using this property with a large item bank, test information functions can be shaped to control measurement error very precisely.

Characterizing the accuracy of test scores is perhaps the central issue in psychometric theory and is a chief difference between IRT and CTT. IRT findings reveal that the CTT concept of reliability is a simplification. In the place of reliability, IRT offers the test information function which shows the degree of precision at different values of theta, θ.

These results allow psychometricians to (potentially) carefully shape the level of reliability for different ranges of ability by including carefully chosen items. For example, in a certification situation in which a test can only be passed or failed, where there is only a single &quot;cutscore,&quot; and where the actual passing score is unimportant, a very efficient test can be developed by selecting only items that have high information near the cutscore. These items generally correspond to items whose difficulty is about the same as that of the cutscore.

==Scoring==
The person parameter formula_1 represents the magnitude of &quot;latent trait&quot; of the individual, which is the human capacity or attribute measured by the test. It might be a cognitive ability, physical ability, skill, knowledge, attitude, personality characteristic, etc.

The estimate of the person parameter - the &quot;score&quot; on a test with IRT - is computed and interpreted in a very different manner as compared to traditional scores like number or percent correct. The individual&#x27;s total number-correct score is not the actual score, but is rather based on the IRFs, leading to a weighted score when the model contains item discrimination parameters. It is actually obtained by multiplying the item response function for each item to obtain a &quot;likelihood function&quot;, the highest point of which is the &quot;maximum likelihood estimate&quot; of formula_1. This highest point is typically estimated with IRT software using the Newton–Raphson method. While scoring is much more sophisticated with IRT, for most tests, the correlation between the theta estimate and a traditional score is very high; often it is 0.95 or more. A graph of IRT scores against traditional scores shows an ogive shape implying that the IRT estimates separate individuals at the borders of the range more than in the middle.

An important difference between CTT and IRT is the treatment of measurement error, indexed by the standard error of measurement. All tests, questionnaires, and inventories are imprecise tools; we can never know a person&#x27;s &quot;true score&quot;, but rather only have an estimate, the &quot;observed score.&quot; There is some amount of random error which may push the observed score higher or lower than the true score. CTT assumes that the amount of error is the same for each examinee, but IRT allows it to vary.

Also, nothing about IRT refutes human development or improvement or assumes that a trait level is fixed. A person may learn skills, knowledge or even so called &quot;test-taking skills&quot; which may translate to a higher true-score. In fact, a portion of IRT research focuses on the measurement of change in trait level.

==A comparison of classical and item response theories==
Classical test theory (CTT) and IRT are largely concerned with the same problems but are different bodies of theory and entail different methods. Although the two paradigms are generally consistent and complementary, there are a number of points of difference:

*IRT makes stronger assumptions than CTT and in many cases provides correspondingly stronger findings; primarily, characterizations of error. Of course, these results only hold when the assumptions of the IRT models are actually met.
*Although CTT results have allowed important practical results, the model-based nature of IRT affords many advantages over analogous CTT findings.
*CTT test scoring procedures have the advantage of being simple to compute (and to explain) whereas IRT scoring generally requires relatively complex estimation procedures.
*IRT provides several improvements in scaling items and people. The specifics depend upon the IRT model, but most models scale the difficulty of items and the ability of people on the same metric. Thus the difficulty of an item and the ability of a person can be meaningfully compared.
*Another improvement provided by IRT is that the parameters of IRT models are generally not sample- or test-dependent whereas true-score is defined in CTT in the context of a specific test. Thus IRT provides significantly greater flexibility in situations where different samples or test forms are used. These IRT findings are foundational for computerized adaptive testing.

It is worth also mentioning some specific similarities between CTT and IRT which help to understand the correspondence between concepts. First, Lord showed that under the assumption that formula_60 is normally distributed, discrimination in the 2PL model is approximately a monotonic function of the point-biserial correlation. In particular:

formula_61

where formula_62 is the point biserial correlation of item &quot;i&quot;. Thus, if the assumption holds, where there is a higher discrimination there will generally be a higher point-biserial correlation.

Another similarity is that while IRT provides for a standard error of each estimate and an information function, it is also possible to obtain an index for a test as a whole which is directly analogous to Cronbach&#x27;s alpha, called the &quot;separation index&quot;. To do so, it is necessary to begin with a decomposition of an IRT estimate into a true location and error, analogous to decomposition of an observed score into a true score and error in CTT. Let

formula_63

where formula_60 is the true location, and formula_65 is the error association with an estimate. Then formula_66 is an estimate of the standard deviation of formula_65 for person with a given weighted score and the separation index is obtained as follows

formula_68

where the mean squared standard error of person estimate gives an estimate of the variance of the errors, formula_69, across persons. The standard errors are normally produced as a by-product of the estimation process. The separation index is typically very close in value to Cronbach&#x27;s alpha.

IRT is sometimes called &quot;strong true score theory&quot; or &quot;modern mental test theory&quot; because it is a more recent body of theory and makes more explicit the hypotheses that are implicit within CTT.

==Implementation==

Implementations of different variations of item response theory are available in many different statistical programs and languages, including the R programming language, and python.

<text>Margaret Morse Nice (December 6, 1883 – June 26, 1974) was an American ornithologist, ethologist, and child psychologist who made an extensive study of the life history of the song sparrow and was author of &quot;Studies in the Life History of the Song Sparrow&quot; (1937). She observed and recorded hierarchies in chicken about three decades ahead of Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe who coined the term &quot;pecking order&quot;. After her marriage, she made observations on language learning in her children and wrote numerous research papers.

==Early life==
Nice was born on December 6, 1883, in Amherst, Massachusetts. The daughter of Anson D. Morse, professor of history at Amherst College, and Margaret Duncan (Ely), she was the fourth child with two older brothers, Ely and William; an elder sister Sarah; a younger sister, Katherine; and two younger brothers, Harold and Edward.

As a child, she took an interest in nature; her mother, who had studied botany at Mount Holyoke College when it was Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, taught her the names of wildflowers. Her first book dealing with birds was &quot;Jenny and the Birds&quot; (1860) by Lucy Guernsey which was read out by her mother. She later came across was John B. Grant&#x27;s &quot;Our Common Birds and How to Know Them&quot; (1891)&quot;.&quot; In her autobiography &quot;Research Is a Passion With Me&quot; (1979), she wrote that &quot;the most cherished Christmas present of my life came in 1895. Mabel Osgood Wright&#x27;s &quot;Bird-Craft&quot;.&quot; This book had color illustrations of birds and it guided her to keep notes on local birds when she was twelve years old. With careful note-making she was even able to compare her notes taken when she was 13 years old and compare the rates of fledgling success of young American robins, chipping sparrows, and least flycatchers 61 years later.

She received her B.A. in psychology from Mount Holyoke College in 1906 and her M.A. in biology from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1915. At Clark University she was only one of two women graduate students. She was greatly influenced by G. Stanley Hall and Clifton Fremont Hodge. Hall would influence her later interest in child psychology while Hodge influenced her in conservation. Hodge had notably influenced Anthony R. Kuser to withdraw a $100 reward for passenger pigeon specimens and instead offer a $300 reward for allowing them to nest undisturbed. Hodge kept bobwhite quails at home and Margaret looked after them when Hodge was travelling. For her MA she produced the first comprehensive study on the diet of the northern bobwhite (&quot;Colinus virginianus&quot;).

==Later life==
At Clark University, Margaret met Leonard Blaine Nice (referred to by his middle name) and they married in 1908. Blaine served as an instructor in physiology for two years at Harvard Medical School following which the family moved to Norman, Oklahoma, where Blaine had accepted a faculty position in physiology and pharmacology at the university. They had five children, Constance, born 1911; Marjorie, 1912; Barbara, 1916; Eleanor, 1918; and Janet, born 1922. Eleanor died of pneumonia at age nine in Columbus, Ohio.

From 1913 to 1927 she studied the birds of Oklahoma which were published finally as the &quot;Birds of Oklahoma&quot; in 1931. During her time in Oklahoma, she also became very interested in child psychology on which she published 18 articles. Constance was the subject of her first study as part of her M.A. &quot;Development of a Child&#x27;s Vocabulary in Relation to Environment&quot; (1915). She studied her own children, their vocabulary, sentence length, and speech development. Nice published Marjorie and Eleanor&#x27;s vocabularies in the Proceedings of the Oklahoma Academy of Sciences (1927). She noted that 19 three-year-old children averaged vocabularies of 910 words and reaching 3000 by six years. This contradicted an old idea that a laborer had a vocabulary of less than 300 words. She also studied mourning doves and wrote about them in several parts. She attended meetings of the National Association of Audubon Societies and came to know many ornithologists in the region. Ornithologist Althea Sherman, 30 years older than Nice, served as a mentor for her early in Nice&#x27;s career.

In 1927 she moved to Columbus, Ohio, where Blaine had accepted a professorship at the Ohio State University. This move gave her an opportunity to meet more ornithologists in the vicinity. At an AOU meeting in 1927, she was greeted as &quot;Mrs Mourning Dove Nice&quot; by Florence Merriam Bailey. Here she carried out a study of song sparrows that established her as one of the leading ornithologists in the world, recording the behavior of individual birds over a long period of time. She studied two banded pairs of birds, named Uno and 4M, initially and later 69 banded pairs. Beginning in 1929, she spent eight years studying these birds and focused on interactions, breeding, territoriality, learning, instinct and song. In 1931 she met Ernst Mayr at a meeting of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union (AOU), and he was delighted to meet an American who was &quot;interested in more than faunistic records and pretty pictures&quot; and encouraged her to write and arranged the publishing the results of her studies. Following the publication Nice was elected the first woman president of the Wilson Club and became the fifth woman to receive membership in the AOU, followed by a fellowship in 1934.

In 1932 the family went to Europe to attend the International Physiological Congress in Rome. In 1938 she spent two months studying the habits of captive birds with Konrad Lorenz in Austria. after the family moved to Chicago in 1936, she later became the vice-president of the Chicago Ornithological Society and the director of the Illinois Audubon Society. She wrote two popular books on her studies, &quot;The Watcher at the Nest&quot; (1939) and &quot;The Behavior of the Song Sparrow&quot; (1943).

Towards the end of the Second World War, she worked along with Joseph Hickey and others to help European ornithologists. As a supporter of wildlife and conservation, Nice fought to preserve the Witchita Mountains Wildlife Refuge, the Dinosaur National Monument, and the California redwoods, among other projects.

Like her mentor Althea Sherman, most of Nice&#x27;s scientific endeavors were self-funded, which was important because of widespread gender discrimination in scientific circles at the time.

Margaret Morse Nice died in Chicago on June 26, 1974, from arteriosclerosis, two months after the death of her husband.

==Contributions to ornithology==

Nice worked on the life-histories of birds at a time when most of the focus was on collection, description and geographic listing. Her work on the song sparrow in particular is considered a landmark, and her work in general was considered &quot;so vast and difficult that the mind boggles at the time and patience required&quot;&quot;.&quot; Ernst Mayr wrote that Nice &quot;almost single-handedly initiated a new era in American ornithology and the only effective counter movement against the list-chasing movement.&quot; Her first research paper was published with the help of Mayr and Erwin Stresemann in the German &quot;Journal für Ornithologie&quot; in 1933 and 1934 because American journals would not accept such long articles.

Nice wrote nearly 250 papers on birds, 3,000 book reviews and several books including the &quot;Birds of Oklahoma&quot; (1924, 1931), &quot;The Watcher at the Nest&quot; (1939) and her autobiography. Her autobiography was published posthumously with a preface by Konrad Lorenz.

==Honors==
Nice was made an honorary member of the British, Finnish, German, Dutch, and Swiss ornithological societies. She received the AOU&#x27;s Brewster Medal in 1942 for her studies of the song sparrow, becoming the second woman to receive it after Florence Merriam Bailey. She received two honorary doctorates, one from Mount Holyoke College during a class reunion (1955) and another from Elmira College (1962). Dean Richard Bond of Elmira College said about her:

Ornithologist Robert Dickerman named a Mexican subspecies of song sparrow (&quot;Melospiza melodia niceae&quot;) after her.

In 1997 the Wilson Ornithological Society established the Margaret Morse Nice Medal for work in ornithology.

<doc id="420162" wikidata="Q19616" url="?curid=420162" title="RAI">
<text>&#x27; (), commercially styled as &#x27; since 2000 and known until 1954 as  (RAI), is the national public broadcasting company of Italy, owned by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. RAI operates many terrestrial and subscription television channels and radio stations. It is one of the biggest broadcasters in Europe, and the biggest in Italy competing with Mediaset and other minor radio and television networks. RAI has a relatively high television audience share of 35.9%.

RAI broadcasts are also received in surrounding countries, including Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, France, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, Slovenia, Switzerland, Serbia, Tunisia, and the Vatican City, and elsewhere on pay television and some channels FTA across Europe including UK on the Hotbird satellite. Half of RAI&#x27;s revenues come from the broadcast receiving licence fees, the remainder from the sale of advertising time. In 1950, RAI became one of the 23 founding members of the European Broadcasting Union.

==Structure==
RAI is 99% owned by the Italian Government Ministry of Economy and Finance and is the sole licencee () of the radio, television, and multimedia broadcasting public service. For this reason, the agreement with the Government prescribes a series of rules and guarantees that RAI must follow to ensure fair public service to the citizens.

Management and Board of Directors are elected by the ruling Parliament through the Parliamentary Commission for the General Direction and Supervision of Broadcasting Services (), every three years, in agreement with almost all parliamentary exponents, usually following the political side of the majority and leaving some space for minor roles to minority parties exponents.

RAI is formally a private joint-stock company (), although all stocks are state-owned; its company statute describes how the strict relationship with the Republic is also ruled by different national laws. The most recent one is the 2015 , &quot;Rai Reform&quot;, i.e. the 2015 law no. 220, including the (&#x27;Consolidated Law on Radio and Television&#x27;). RAI and broadcasting are supervised by the commission, which also rules economic budgets and main regulations, including public service&#x27;s electoral segments during electoral campaigns.

==History==

===1924===
 (URI) was formed in 1924 with the backing of the Marconi Company following a model adopted in other European countries. URI made its inaugural broadcast—a speech by Benito Mussolini (1883–1945) at Teatro Costanzi—on 5 October. Regular programming began the following evening, with a quartet performing Haydn&#x27;s Quartet No. 7 in A major from Palazzo Corradi. At 21.00 CET, Ines Donarelli Viviani announced for the first time: &quot; Rome station 1RO 425 metres wavelength. To all those who are listening our greetings, good evening.&quot; Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s () held 85% of URI shares and Western Electric&#x27;s (SIRAC) held the remaining 15%.

Under the provisions of Royal Decree No. 1067 of 8 February 1923, wireless broadcasting became a state monopoly under the control of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs; URI was commissioned to provide services for a minimum of six years pursuant to Royal Decree No. 2191 of 14 October 1924 . When URI&#x27;s contract expired in 1927, it was succeeded under Royal Decree Law No. 2207 of 17 November 1927 by the partially nationalised (EIAR), which became (RAI) with investment from (SIP) in 1944.

===1940s===
During the reconstruction following World War II, much of RAI&#x27;s early programming was influenced by the &quot;Reithian&quot; style of the BBC. The emphasis was on educational content. Programs such as and introduced people to what life was like in other parts of the country, at a time when most people could not afford to travel.

Over the following years, RAI made various changes to its services. It reorganised its radio stations in November 1946 into two national networks, and (&#x27;Red Network&#x27; and &#x27;Blue Network&#x27;). It added the culture-based in October 1950. On 1 January 1952, the became the (focusing on informational content) and the became the (with a greater emphasis on entertainment). The three radio channels eventually became today&#x27;s Rai Radio 1, Rai Radio 2, and Rai Radio 3.

===1950s===
In 1954, the state-owned holding company (IRI) became the sole shareholder and URI—now renamed to reflect its extended responsibilities—finally began a regular television service. On 3 January at 11:00 CET, the first RAI television announcer presented the day&#x27;s schedule, which was broadcast from the service&#x27;s Milan headquarters and relay stations in Turin and Rome. At 14:30, the first regular programme in Italian television history was broadcast: , hosted by Armando Pizzo and Mike Bongiorno. The evening&#x27;s entertainment was a theatre performance, , written by Carlo Goldoni. 23:15 saw the start of the day&#x27;s concluding programme, —the first edition of a weekly series which continues to this day.

===2000s===
RAI was originally the subsidiary of RAI Holding S.p.A. RAI Holding was absorbed into RAI as of 1 December 2004, per Article 21 of Law 112/04. RAI is governed by a nine-member Administrative Council. Seven of the members are elected by a committee of the Italian Parliament. The other two (one of which is the president) are nominated by the largest shareholder: the Ministry of Economic Development. The Council appoints the Director-General. The Director-General and the members of the Administrative Council are appointed for a renewable three-year term.

In 2005, the government of Silvio Berlusconi proposed partial privatisation of RAI by selling 20% of its ownership. This proposal was very controversial, in part because Berlusconi was the head of the leading private broadcaster Mediaset. Some critics stated that Mediaset could become the buyer and thus increase its dominant position. After the revelation that RAI would lose €80m ($96m, £54m) in 2006, the privatisation plan was suspended in October 2005.

===2010s===
On 18 May 2010, Raisat received a major upgrade and re-branded with a new logo and a new name. It and all of the sister channels dropped the &quot;sat&quot; part from the name and became Rai YoYo, Rai 5 (formerly known as Rai Extra), Rai Premium, and Rai Movie (formerly known as Raisat Cinema). On 11 June 2013, RAI was one of the few European broadcasters to condemn and criticise the closure of Greece&#x27;s state broadcaster ERT. RAI is 99% owned by the Italian Government Ministry of Economy and Finance, so it is said that it broadcasts content that may politically influence people.

===Corporate identity===
The Alberto Ribera logo was introduced in 1967, however, this did not have significant application except on studios and portable cameras. A second variation of the Carboni logo was introduced in 1977, which was not officially adopted but appeared in some graphics, including that of the time signal.

==Controversies==

===Political fairness and balance between public service and commercial TV market===
RAI&#x27;s broadcasts content and nominees are frequently accused of political bias, depending both on the management for each channel or programme, and on the lack of meritocracy in contracts with television hosts and also technicians, also concerting cachets and salaries. However, many people underline that RAI needs to balance political equity and public services with the market rules and competitors. All these issues are ongoing.

RAI&#x27;s main channels are considered slightly politically oriented: Rai 1 is liberal or centre-right, Rai 2 is usually more right-oriented, while Rai 3 typically has the majority of left oriented programmes and hosts Fabio Fazio and Bianca Berlinguer, or the journalistic deep investigation programme &quot;Report&quot;, famous for its investigations over far-right scandals. This issue in Italy is referred as and is yet to be solved.

===Political censorship and civil rights advocacy controversies===
RAI is frequently subjected to controversies and censorship accusations regarding political matters, especially civil rights and LGBT issues. The broadcaster was strongly accused in 2008 of cutting the gay love scene of the Oscar-winning movie &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;. RAI initially apologised for the cut, explaining that the cut was due to a pre-cut edition originally planned for the prime-time slot, and wasn&#x27;t corrected when airing was shifted to the late-night slot. Critics noticed that similar scenes of heterosexual lovers were never cut out before in prime-time and reinforcing the accusation of homophobic censorship. The company rescheduled a new uncut version of the movie, but this was aired again in an even later time slot, a choice seen as a confirmation of the accusation. Only two years later, the movie aired again with all homosexual sex and kisses cut off. RAI was forced again to apologise, accusing a problem&quot; with the pre-cut edition by the distribution company and a lack of fact-checking by the RAI employee.

In 2011, episode 125 of the German TV Soap &quot;Um Himmels Willen&quot; (&#x27;For Heaven&#x27;s Sake&#x27;), shown in Italy since 2004, was entitled &quot;Romeo and Romeo&quot; and due to screen on Rai 1 but was left out in order to &quot;avoid controversy&quot;, according to the broadcaster. In 2016, during the first clear broadcast of the show &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot;, on Rai 2, the gay kisses for one of the main characters (portrayed by Jack Falahee) were completely cut off. RAI apologised again, stating that the incident was &quot;merely the mistake of an overzealous editor&quot;. Criticism on the social media platforms was so strong that Falahee and showrunner Shonda Rhimes both tweeted against the network&#x27;s &quot;inexcusable&quot; censorship.

====Fedez controversy====
In 2021, another accusation was made against RAI by Italian rapper Fedez. During the 1 May , a traditional Italian TV broadcast concert in celebration of the International Workers&#x27; Day, the rapper was invited to perform and have a speech on the stage. The rapper honoured the entertainment workers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and spent half of his speech in support of legislation that would punish violence against women and LGBT people as hate crimes in Italy. During his speech, he recalled all the political exponents&#x27; hate speech (confirmed by videos or sentenced by court) during the late years, and accused Rai 3&#x27;s executive of trying censoring his speech by order of superiors as &quot;this is how it works&quot;. RAI immediately denied all accusations and Fedez leaked a recorded audio of the conversation between him and the executives, where managers and hosts (declaring their names and roles to him) tried to censor his speech, by &quot;asking you to adapt to a system that you probably don&#x27;t get&quot;.

After the video was reposted by all national media and web news sites, RAI sued the rapper, while a parliamentary investigation was opened. Fedez replied he was proud and ready to face the court, and he said he was available as a testimony for the RAI&#x27;s Superior Commission. Fedez&#x27;s accusation was one of the biggest media scandals of RAI, as not only all political parties took sides in the cause (centre and left in favour of the rapper, including ex-prime ministers Giuseppe Conte and Enrico Letta, while right and far-right parties in favour of RAI, including Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni&#x27;s colleagues). The scandal increased when the parliamentary commission denied a hearing with Fedez, only speaking with RAI&#x27;s executives. In the very much criticised email answer (which screenshot was published by Fedez on Instagram) the Office of the Commission stated that even if not prohibited by law, it was not custom to invite external people to the Commission investigation. Fedez replied to the email with only three clown emojis, a fact that further angered the far-right politicians.

In July, the new board of RAI was elected, including the CEO and executives; this led to RAI&#x27;s CEO Fuortes revealing not only the withdrawal of the action in court for failing all the required accusatory elements but also that no legal action was ever meant by the new management. Far-right exponents opened a parliamentary question over the withdrawal. After the CEO&#x27;s declaration, no other details were said about any apology or agreement with Fedez: nonetheless, the rapper was invited by Fabio Fazio to the first episode of the new season of his late show. Following the 2021 controversy, Fedez reinforced some controversy against RAI when he announced he was not invited to the 2022 Concertone for the first time.

====Editorial independence====
Shortly after the Meloni government took office in October 2022, influential managers were replaced, and well-known journalists and presenters such as Fabio Fazio, Bianca Berlinguer, and Lucia Annunziata left RAI. In 2023, Giorgia Meloni was accused of pressuring out the head of RAI for not supporting her political agenda. In 2024, Meloni called for her government&#x27;s ministers to be given more speaking time in the European election campaign. In doing so, she called on the RAI to violate the law &quot;par conditiono&quot;, according to which all parties must receive the same amount of broadcasting time. The resistance to this was massive, and the plans are off the table for the time being.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated RAI to be &quot;Captured Public or State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

====Accusing of censorship on Liberation Day 2024====
Antonio Scurati, a well-known Italian writer and expert of the history of fascism, was commissioned by the public broadcaster RAI to read a speech on the day of liberation from fascism (Italian: ) on 25 April. However, at short notice, Scurati was disinvited again and was no longer allowed to give his speech. The presenter of the show did not want to accept that and quickly decided to read out his words in front of the camera.

A passage from Scurati states, &quot;As long as those who govern us do not utter the word anti-fascism, the specter of fascism will continue to haunt the house of Italian democracy.&quot; It is a clear criticism of Prime Minister Meloni, because the leader of the Fratelli d&#x27;Italia party has not distanced herself from her party&#x27;s fascist beginnings.

He was turned down for ideological and political reasons, Scurati told the German public broadcaster ARD. &quot;I criticized the fact that, during the 19 months of Meloni&#x27;s government, the Prime Minister insisted on the reading of history that corresponds to her neo-fascist background, i.e. she shifted the blame for the slaughter and massacres onto the German Nazis, even though the fascists of Salò were accomplices and collaborators.&quot;

===Budget and unjustified expenses===
RAI was investigated and fined (with many executives arrested or fired) for unjustified expenses and suspicious gifts. It was noticed that, frequently, dinners, expensive watches and jewellery were all paid by RAI for unknown people outside the company. In 2022, a new scandal was investigated by the Guardia di Finanza surrounding corruption and bribes. At least 5 people in total were arrested, while the investigation is still ongoing.

==Rai Libri==

 is the print publishing arm of RAI. It primarily publish magazines and periodicals for news, entertainment, the broadcast industry, and since its inception, broadcast schedules. Since 1969, it has also published the &quot;&quot;, the largest Italian dictionary of its type.

===Publishing history===
RAI&#x27;s history in print with the Unione Radiofonica Italiana (URI)&#x27;s weekly magazine which debuted in January 1925 and became in 1930. Edizioni Radio Italiana (ERI) was founded in 1949 in Turin, formed entirely from RAI capital to build on &#x27;s success. In 1954 primary ownership was split between RAI and Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI). That same year became , which would continue to be published until RAI divested in 1995.

During the 50s and 60s the ERI published , &#x27; and &#x27;, and in 1969 the first edition of the . The 80s saw the premiere of the monthlies (1983) and &quot;King&quot; (1987), along with registering a new company name in 1987: Nuova Eri Edizioni Rai-Radiotelevisione Italiana S.p.A., or &quot;Nuova Eri&quot;.

Since the 1990s, RAI/ERI has increasingly focused on publishing books written by its own broadcast stars, both in news and entertainment. In 1995 Nuova ERI closed and reopened in 1997 as &quot;Rai Eri&quot;. On 15 October 2018, they renamed to &quot;Rai Libri&quot;. Rai Libri also edits technical publications: since 1946, since 1967, and since 1957. It produces its own reports on communications and media, with the second edition of the book-and-documentary released in 2004 in collaboration with Rai Teche.

RAI (originally URI) had printed its broadcast schedules nearly without interruption starting in 1925 as , then from 1930 as , then continuously from 1954 as , until RAI divested in 1995. The magazine was restarted under publisher with a print edition from 1999 to 2008, closing due to poor sales. It reopened in 2012 as an online-only publication, with a handful of special-occasion independent print runs in the intervening years, including 2005 (its 80th anniversary), 2010 (switchover to DTTV), and 2011 (150th anniversary of the unification of Italy). The Rai Ufficio Stampa website has published programming schedules and television blurbs online since 2011 under the magazine&#x27;s name. On 3 January 2014, Rai Teche published online the complete 1925–1995 archives of URI/RAI&#x27;s //&quot;TV&quot;.

<doc id="420166" wikidata="Q296689" url="?curid=420166" title="Ed Davey">
<text>Sir Edward Jonathan Davey (born 25 December 1965) is a British politician who has been the leader of the Liberal Democrats since 2020, having acted in the position from 2019 to 2020. He served in the Cameron–Clegg coalition as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change from 2012 to 2015 and as deputy leader to Jo Swinson in 2019. An &quot;Orange Book&quot; liberal who has often advocated for carers, Davey has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingston and Surbiton since 2017, previously holding the seat from 1997 to 2015.

Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. After both his parents died before he was 16, Davey was raised by his grandparents, and subsequently attended Nottingham High School. He then went on to study at Jesus College, Oxford, and Birkbeck, University of London. He was an economics researcher and financial analyst before being elected to the House of Commons. Davey served as a Liberal Democrat spokesperson to Charles Kennedy, Menzies Campbell and Nick Clegg from 2005 to 2010, in various portfolios including education and skills, trade and industry, and foreign and Commonwealth affairs.

In 2010, after the Liberal Democrats entered into a coalition government with the Conservative Party, Davey served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment Relations, Consumer and Postal Affairs from 2010 to 2012, and in David Cameron&#x27;s Cabinet as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change from 2012 to 2015, following Chris Huhne&#x27;s resignation. Davey focused on increasing competition in the energy market by removing barriers to entry for smaller companies, and streamlining the customer switching process. He also approved the construction of Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. As postal affairs minister, Davey did not investigate the details of the Post Office Horizon scandal that had led to the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters, but was the only Post Office minister to meet Alan Bates, the founder of the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance.

Davey lost his seat in the 2015 general election and was knighted in the 2016 New Year Honours for political and public service. He regained his seat in the 2017 general election, and served as the Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesperson from 2017 to 2019. After the retirement of Vince Cable, Davey unsuccessfully ran against Jo Swinson in the 2019 Liberal Democrats leadership election, and was later appointed Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson and elected unopposed as the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats. After Swinson lost her seat at the 2019 general election, Davey, while remaining deputy leader, served as acting leader alongside Liberal Democrat presidents Baroness Brinton and Mark Pack from December 2019 to August 2020.

Davey stood in the 2020 Liberal Democrats leadership election, in which he defeated Layla Moran with 63.5% of the vote. In his leadership bid he said he would prioritise defeating the Conservatives and ruled out working with them following the 2024 general election. Under Davey&#x27;s leadership, the Liberal Democrats have made gains in local elections alongside Labour, with both parties making gains in the 2024 local elections, where the Liberal Democrats finished second for the first time in a local election cycle since 2009. In the 2024 general election Davey led his party to both their highest ever number of seats and the highest number of seats for a third party since 1923, and was noted, with praise and criticism, for his campaign stunts.

==Early life and career==

Edward Davey was born on 25 December 1965 in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. His father John (1932 – March 1970), a solicitor, died when Davey was four years old in Mansfield General Hospital, three months after being diagnosed with cancer. His mother, Nina Davey (née Stanbrook), died 11 years later when Davey was 15, after which he was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring. Davey acted as a carer for his terminally ill mother before her death, and also cared for his grandmother.

Davey was in both the 90th Nottingham Scout group and the 17th Nottingham Air Scout group. He sang in the local church choir, St John&#x27;s. Like his two brothers, Davey received the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Gold Award, meeting Prince Philip on 2 March 1984 when the Prince visited his school, the private Nottingham High School, where Davey was head boy. He took A-levels in German, French and History. One of his two brothers attended Trent Polytechnic, becoming a solicitor. After leaving school, Davey attended Jesus College, Oxford, where he was awarded a first class BA degree in Philosophy, politics and economics in 1988. He was JCR President.

In 1989, he became an economics researcher for the Liberal Democrats, principally to Alan Beith, the party&#x27;s then-Treasury spokesman, whilst studying at Birkbeck College, London, for a master&#x27;s degree (MSc) in economics. He was closely involved in the development of Liberal Democrat policies such as an additional penny on income tax to fund education, and central bank independence, for the 1992 general election. From 1993 to 1997, he worked in business forecasting and market analysis for management consultancy firm Omega Partners.

==Parliamentary career (1997–2015)==
Davey was elected to the House of Commons, at his first attempt, in the 1997 general election, where he defeated Richard Tracey, the sitting Conservative MP for the former constituency of Surbiton, with a majority of just 56 votes, and remained the seat&#x27;s MP for 18 years. In his maiden speech, on 6 June 1997, he gave his support for the setting up of the London Assembly, but was against the idea of a directly elected Mayor of London; he also spoke of the effects governmental cuts were having on education delivery in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames.

In 1998, he was the primary sponsor of an early day motion supporting the repeal of the Greenwich judgment, which prevents local authorities from giving their own residents priority access to school places.

In 2001, he opposed government proposals for restrictions on gambling machines, which he described as a &quot;silly bit of nanny state politics&quot;.

In January 2003, Davey publicly backed local constituent and NHS whistleblower Ian Perkin, who alleged he had been sacked from his director of finance role for exposing statistics manipulation at St George&#x27;s NHS healthcare trust. Davey condemned the NHS bureaucracy as &quot;Stalinist&quot; and called for an inquiry into Perkin&#x27;s case, while personally meeting trust executives to discuss the case on behalf of Perkin.

In February 2003, Davey introduced the clause which repealed the prohibition of &quot;promotion of homosexuality&quot; under Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988. The legislation was repealed in March. He was one of the contributors to &quot;The Orange Book&quot; (2004).

In 2006, Davey was one of eight Liberal Democrat MPs, including Jeremy Browne and Mark Oaten, who opposed a total ban on smoking in clubs and pubs. He called the ban &quot;a bit too nanny state&quot;.

In an article for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in 2007, Davey and LSE economist Tim Leunig proposed a new system of community land auctions through sealed bids with a new tax, to take place before the land was given planning permission. They suggested that councils could take in tax the difference between the land owner&#x27;s asking price and the highest bidder&#x27;s offer, claiming this would stimulate development and the revenue then used to lower other taxation.

===Lib Dem spokesperson===

Following Davey&#x27;s election to parliament in 1997, he was appointed as the Lib Dem&#x27;s spokesman on Treasury Affairs. He added the post of whip in 1998, and as the spokesman on London from 2000.

Davey was re-elected in the 2001 general election, increasing his share of the vote from 36.7% to 60.2%. He increased his majority from just 56 to 15,676, beating former Conservative MP David Shaw. He joined the Liberal Democrat frontbench under Leader Charles Kennedy in the same year when he was appointed the party&#x27;s spokesperson for Treasury matters. In 2002, he became the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. He was appointed spokesperson for Education and Skills in 2005, before becoming spokesperson for Trade and Industry in March 2006. In December 2006, he succeeded Norman Lamb as Chief of Staff to Menzies Campbell, the new party leader. Davey was chair of the party&#x27;s Campaigns and Communications Committee. Following Nick Clegg&#x27;s election as Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Davey was awarded the Foreign Affairs brief, and continued to retain his chairmanship of the party&#x27;s Campaigns and Communications Committee.

On 26 February 2008, Davey was suspended from parliament for the day for ignoring a warning from the Deputy Speaker. He was protesting about the exclusion by the Speaker of a Liberal Democrat motion to debate and vote on whether the UK should have a referendum on staying in the EU.

At the 2009 Liberal Democrat conference, Davey caused controversy by calling for dialogue with the Taliban, through declaring that it was &quot;time for tea with the Taliban&quot;, a comment echoed by Malala Yousafzai four years later to the BBC.

==Ministerial career (2010–2015)==

===Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business (2010–2012)===

Following the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement, after the 2010 general election, Davey was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills with responsibility for Employment Relations, Consumer and Postal Affairs. In addition, he was appointed as the Minister of State for Trade Policy. As a Parliamentary Under Secretary, Davey led the establishment of an unofficial &#x27;like-minded group for growth&#x27; ginger group within the European Union, convening several economically liberal European governments behind an agenda of deregulation, free trade, liberalisation of services and a digital single market. He was involved in the provisional application phase of the Free Trade Agreement between the EU and South Korea.

In January 2011, he faced protests by postal workers in his Kingston and Surbiton constituency for his role in the privatisation of Royal Mail. Also in 2011, Davey announced several reforms to the labour market, mainly aimed at improving labour market flexibility. These reforms included cuts to red tape and easing dismissal laws, and were accompanied by reviews from the Institute of Economic Affairs into compensation payments and the TUPE. Davey also announced that the government would abolish the default retirement age.

As Minister for Postal Affairs, Davey did not investigate the details of the Horizon Post Office scandal that had led to the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters. He was, however, the only Post Office minister to meet Alan Bates, the founder of the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance, with this meeting taking place in October 2010. Following criticism in 2024, Davey expressed regret and said that he had been misled by Post Office officials. Following Paula Vennells&#x27;s decision to hand back her CBE over her role during the scandal, Davey came under pressure to return his knighthood because of his role during it. However, Davey said he was &quot;completely surprised&quot; as to why the Conservatives had awarded Vennells a CBE in 2019.

===Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (2012–2015)===

On 3 February 2012, following the resignation of Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Chris Huhne after his conviction of perverting the course of justice in relation to speeding offences, Davey was appointed Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, and was appointed to the Privy Council on 8 February. As Secretary of State, Davey also became a member of the National Security Council. In late 2012, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published an article questioning Davey&#x27;s loyalty to Clegg. Responding in an interview, Davey rejected the claims of the article, saying instead he thought Clegg was &quot;the best leader&quot; the Liberal Democrats had ever had and that he personally was a member of Clegg&#x27;s &quot;Praetorian Guard&quot;.

In 2013, Davey set up the Green Growth Group, bringing together environmental and climate ministers from across the European Union in an effort to promote growth, investment in renewable and nuclear energy, liberalisation of the European energy market, a global carbon market, trade in energy, carbon capture technology, energy efficiency, and competition. Domestically, Davey focused on increasing competition in the energy market by removing barriers to entry for smaller companies, and streamlining the customer switching process, declaring in 2013 that &quot;competition works&quot;. Abroad, Davey promoted investment in the British energy sector by foreign companies from countries such as Japan, South Korea, and China, making significant diplomatic trips to the latter two countries in order to highlight investment opportunities.

In October 2013, during a BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; segment on energy bills, Davey was asked by BBC presenter Jeremy Paxman whether or not he wore a jumper (to stay warm) at home, to which Davey replied that he did but stressed that competition and energy efficiency were the solutions to lowering energy bills. The following day, various media outlets reported that Davey had advised for people to wear jumpers at home to save on energy bills, although he had not. The controversy then spread when Prime Minister David Cameron&#x27;s official spokesman told a reporter that people may wish to &quot;consider&quot; advice by charities to wrap up warmly, leading to media outlets reporting that Number 10 was also suggesting wearing jumpers to cut energy bills, with the supposed suggestion being seized upon by the opposition Labour Party. Number 10 later issued a statement rebutting the media reports. In April 2014, Davey called for the G7 to begin reduction of dependency on Russian energy following the Revolution of Dignity and commencement of the Russo-Ukrainian War. Davey argued the benefits of investment in onshore wind energy from companies such as Siemens was a key part of the push to reduce dependence on Russian energy, while &quot;more diversified supplies of gas&quot; including from the US and domestic shale gas would also help. In May 2014 at a meeting in Rome, G7 energy ministers including Davey agreed formally to a process for reducing dependency on Russian energy; &quot;Putin has crossed a line&quot;, Davey declared.

Throughout and after the coalition, Davey&#x27;s ministerial career came under scrutiny from political figures and the media. On the right, Conservatives Nigel Lawson and Peter Lilley were critical of Davey&#x27;s environmental stances, and he was lampooned by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; sketch writer Michael Deacon. He was also criticised by left-wing figures such as Green MP for Brighton Pavilion Caroline Lucas over his support of fracking, and by the Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Labour Party Ed Miliband for Davey&#x27;s warning that Labour&#x27;s price control policy would cause blackouts. Luxembourgish MEP and environmentalist Claude Turmes alleged in his 2017 book &quot;Energy Transformation&quot; that Davey&#x27;s Green Growth Group was actually a front for British nuclear interests. Conversely, Davey&#x27;s promotion to the role of Energy Secretary was hailed by &quot;The Economist&quot;, which viewed him favourably as a &quot;pragmatic&quot; and &quot;free market liberal&quot;. In &quot;The Liberal Democrats and supply-side economics&quot;, published in an issue of the Institute of Economic Affairs&#x27; &quot;Economic Affairs&quot; journal, Davey was identified as the Liberal Democrat who had achieved the most in terms of supply-side reforms. Conservative MP and former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister of State for Government Policy Oliver Letwin credited Davey and his &quot;like-minded&quot; group of economically liberal governments as having helped to curb regulatory enthusiasm within the European Union.

Leading up to the 2015 general election, Davey was viewed by various sources as a potential successor to Clegg. Political commentator Gary Gibbon speculated that due to Davey&#x27;s association with the Orange Book wing of the party, the tenuousness of Danny Alexander&#x27;s parliamentary seat, and David Laws&#x27; unwillingness, the role of &quot;heir&quot; would naturally fall to Davey.

==Parliamentary career (2017–present)==
===2015 general election===
At the 2015 general election, Davey was defeated by Conservative candidate James Berry by 2,834 votes after the Liberal Democrat vote fell by more than 15 per cent in Kingston and Surbiton. This made him the first cabinet minister to lose their seat since Michael Portillo in 1997.

Davey later told reporters he was &quot;obviously disappointed&quot; with his defeat, but said it had not been a total shock. &quot;We knew it would be close – we had it written on our leaflets. But I don&#x27;t think the voters did&quot;, he said. &quot;When I was out canvassing today I had a man said to me: &#x27;You&#x27;ll be fine, Ed&#x27;. I wish I had a vote for all the people who told me I would be fine. The party is clearly paying some price for going into coalition with the Conservatives. We put the national interest above the party interest which was the right thing to do at the time. I have no regrets on that. I think we are seeing a national thing here. We have had a very bad night nationally.&quot;

At the end of 2015, he accepted a knighthood for &#x27;political and public service&#x27; which was announced in the 2016 New Year Honours list.

===Return to Parliament===

Davey regained Kingston and Surbiton for the Liberal Democrats at the 2017 general election, with a majority of 4,124 votes over Berry. Upon his return to Parliament, Davey was considered a possible candidate for the Liberal Democrat leadership election following the resignation of Tim Farron. However, he ruled out standing over family concerns, but called on the Liberal Democrats to be &quot;the party of reform&quot; and &quot;super-ambitious – just like radical centrists in Canada, France and the Netherlands&quot;. Davey was then the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, having previously served as Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesperson from 2017 to 2019.

==Leader of the Liberal Democrats (2019–present)==
===2019 leadership bid===
Following the 2019 European Parliament election, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable announced his intention &quot;to hand over a bigger, stronger party&quot; to a new leader, triggering a party leadership contest. Davey announced his candidacy for the role on 30 May, stating his belief that action must be taken in Parliament to prevent a &quot;no deal&quot; Brexit, and highlighting his support for stronger action to limit global warming. Davey lost this race to Jo Swinson, with 36.9% of the vote to Swinson&#x27;s 63.1%. On 3 September 2019, Davey was elected as Swinson&#x27;s deputy leader.

===2019 general election and acting co-leadership===
Following Jo Swinson&#x27;s resignation as a result of losing her seat in the 2019 general election, Davey became interim co-leader alongside the party president (at first Baroness Brinton, and then Mark Pack).

===2020 leadership bid===

In June 2020, whilst acting leader, Davey launched his bid to become leader saying that his &quot;experience as a carer can help rebuild Britain after the COVID-19 pandemic&quot;. He proposed the establishment of a basic income to support carers, and said that the Liberal Democrats should be &quot;the party of social care&quot;. Davey ruled out a formal electoral agreement with the Labour Party, but said that he would prioritise defeating the Conservatives, and ruled out working with the Conservatives following the next election. He proposed a plan to reduce carbon emissions from domestic flights to zero by 2030 through investment in research and technology. In a hustings event with Welsh members, he said that the 2021 Senedd election was a priority and he expected success for the Liberal Democrats.

Davey was one of two candidates running for leader in the Liberal Democrats leadership election, competing with Layla Moran. One recurring theme of the leadership campaign was Davey&#x27;s record in the Cameron-Clegg coalition government, and the policies that government had enacted. Moran is considered to be more left-wing than Davey and representing a break from the coalition years. Alongside Clegg and many of the Liberal Democrats who served in the governing Conservative-Lib Dem coalition of 2010–2015, Davey is associated with the party&#x27;s right-wing Orange Booker branch. The record of the coalition, which caused a decline in popularity of the Liberal Democrats after 2015, has been defended by Davey.

On 27 August, Davey won the leadership election with 42,756 votes, which translated to 63.5% of total votes. In his victory speech, Davey said that the Liberal Democrats must &quot;wake up and smell the coffee&quot; and &quot;start listening&quot; to ordinary people and those who &quot;don&#x27;t believe we share their values&quot;. He also stressed his experience in the coalition government, and his commitments to tackle climate change. Moran later congratulated Davey on Twitter, saying &quot;I look forward to working with him to campaign for a better future for Britain.&quot;

Under Davey&#x27;s leadership, the Liberal Democrats have made gains in local elections alongside Labour, with both parties making gains in the 2023 local elections and made further gains in the 2024 local elections, where the Liberal Democrats finished second for the first time in a local election cycle since 2009.

=== 2024 general election campaign stunts and seat victories ===
Davey led his party in the 2024 general election, and was noted, with praise and criticism, for his campaign stunts. When visiting Windermere, Davey fell off his paddleboard, whilst campaigning to highlight the political issue of sewage discharge in the United Kingdom. A couple of days later, Davey won high-profile media attention when going down a Slip &#x27;N Slide, whilst drawing attention to deteriorating mental health among children. When visiting Eastbourne, Davey did a bungee jump, asking people to &quot;take the plunge&quot; and vote Liberal Democrat. When asked about these stunts, Davey said: &quot;Politicians need to take the concerns and interests of voters seriously but I&#x27;m not sure they need to take themselves seriously all the time and I&#x27;m quite happy to have some fun&quot;.

Davey also spoke on his experience as a carer both for his mother when he was a child, and contemporarily for his son. This included an election broadcast focusing on his caring responsibilities, with Davey stating that the Liberal Democrat manifesto put health and care at the centre.

On 10 June 2024, Davey launched the Liberal Democrat manifesto, titled &quot;For a Fair Deal&quot;, in London. He stressed that the Lib Dems are a &quot;pro-European party&quot;; the manifesto includes a promise for the UK to rejoin the European single market. Midway through the campaign, opinion pollsters YouGov found that 35% of Liberal Democrat voters did not recognise a photograph of Davey. Amid the general election betting scandal, Davey, whilst admitting that he had previously bet on the outcome of elections, called for a review of gambling laws.

Davey led his party to both their highest ever number of seats and the highest number of seats for a third party since 1923, restoring the Liberal Democrats as the third largest party in the House of Commons. He celebrated by singing Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; at a Liberal Democrat party. This also makes Davey able to ask two questions to the prime minister each week at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, the first Liberal Democrat leader to do so since Nick Clegg in 2010. Davey said he was humbled by the results, and jokingly said: &quot;I&#x27;ve rather enjoyed this campaign&quot;. He retained Kingston and Surbiton for the Liberal Democrats at the election, with an increased majority.

Responding to Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves&#x27; first budget in October 2024, Davey described the government&#x27;s plans on social care as “a good start” but inadequate. He also said that he thought that the budget may not offer British people &quot;a sense of hope, urgency and the promise of a fair deal&quot; and that more could have been done to help the more vulnerable people in society.

==Political positions==

Davey identifies as a liberal politically, telling the &quot;Total Politics&quot; magazine: &quot;I personally think liberalism is the strongest political philosophy in the modern world. Socialism has failed. I think even social democracy, the watered down version which Labour sort of understand depending on which day of the week it is, is not very convincing, and I don&#x27;t really understand where the Conservatives are coming from because they have so many philosophies within one party. There&#x27;s no philosophy of the modern Conservative Party.&quot; He has said that he believes &quot;in the free market and in competition&quot;, and during a parliamentary public bill committee debate in November 2010 argued in defence of privatisation, deregulation, and the private sector against Labour MP Gregg McClymont.

Davey describes himself as &quot;an economist by trade.&quot; He was a supporter of the coalition government, writing in a 2011 column for London newspaper &quot;Get West London&quot; that the coalition would &quot;restore liberty to the people&quot; and that &quot;Labour&#x27;s nanny state will be cut back&quot; in reference to the coalition&#x27;s policies on civil liberties. In 2012, Davey predicted the coalition government would be more pro-European Union than Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour government, praising Conservative ministers and the then Prime Minister David Cameron for relations they had developed with European counterparts. Retrospectively, Davey said of the coalition in 2017: &quot;I think the coalition government, when history looks at it, will go down as actually a pretty good government.&quot;
In 2017, Davey warned against a Conservative Party proposal for fines on large internet companies who fail to remove extremist and terrorist material from their platforms within 24 hours, which he claimed could lead to censorship if companies are forced to rush to remove such material and pointed to Germany as an example of where this approach has the potential to lead to censorship. He thinks technology giants must not be treated as the &quot;enemy&quot; and accused the Conservatives of declaring an &quot;all-out war&quot; on the internet. Similarly he is critical of Conservative proposals to weaken encryption because, according to Davey, encryption is important for individual security and helping businesses to thrive.

In 2018, after the government&#x27;s Investigatory Powers Act mass surveillance law was declared to be in breach of EU law, Davey commented that UK surveillance needed a &quot;major overhaul&quot; which puts &quot;our freedoms and civil liberties at its very core&quot; Davey&#x27;s party opposes the mass surveillance law and had voted against it.

Davey is supportive of market solutions in the conventional energy sector, &quot;The Guardian&quot; describing him as a &#x27;zealot&#x27; for markets. He has been highly critical of price controls such as those proposed by former Labour leader Ed Miliband; he considers them to be detrimental to competition and lowering prices for consumers. He has promoted removal of barriers to entry to encourage new entrants into the energy market; &quot;We began with deregulation. This stimulated a doubling of smaller firms&quot; he wrote of his policy as Energy Secretary in 2014. Additionally, he welcomed the rise of consumer switching websites. He has, however, supported &quot;properly designed and carefully targeted&quot; short-term subsidies for some emerging green energy technologies in order to meet climate change targets.

When cutting green energy subsidies as Energy and Climate Change Secretary, Davey said he &quot;tended to try and marketise the reduction so people were competing for any remaining subsidies&quot; through Contracts for difference (CfDs). After leaving the office of Energy Secretary in 2015 he explained that he had planned to &quot;eliminate subsidies over the coming years&quot; and had previously stated, &quot;ultimately I don&#x27;t want the government—the Secretary of State—to decide what that low carbon mix is . . . I want the markets and technology development and innovation to decide what that mix is.&quot;

He has argued in favour of both nuclear power and fracking as potential energy sources, and natural gases as transitional fuels, though he has warned that there should not be an over-reliance on them.Davey has previously argued against nuclear power but in 2013 he urged fellow Liberal Democrat members to support nuclear power, stating, &quot;I&#x27;ve changed my mind because of climate change.&quot;

Davey does not support the United Kingdom rejoining the European Union in the short term, in 2020 stating that the idea that people would want to consider re-joining the EU in two or three years&#x27; time as &quot;being for the birds&quot;. In January 2021 he clarified this position, stating that he is &quot;determined the Liberal Democrats remain a pro-European party committed to the UK being members of the European Union again&quot;, adding that his party is &quot;practical&quot; about the matter.
Davey opposes a second Scottish independence referendum arguing in 2022, that it would be &quot;damaging to recovery.&quot;

Following the murder of Sarah Everard in March 2021, Davey said that &quot;Men have got to change&quot; and suggested that we &quot;educate boys and men to show more respect&quot;. In May 2021, alongside celebrities and other public figures, Davey was a signatory to an open letter from &quot;Stylist&quot; magazine which called on the government to address what it described as an &quot;epidemic of male violence&quot; by funding an &quot;ongoing, high-profile, expert-informed awareness campaign on men&#x27;s violence against women and girls&quot;.

A supporter of transgender rights, Davey believes that transgender women should be given the same rights as cisgender women, which he made clear in a series of interviews on the day that a report into violence against women, commissioned in the wake of the Everard&#x27;s murder, was published.

Davey criticised Boris Johnson after the 2021 North Shropshire by-election where a Lib Dem candidate, Helen Morgan overturned a Conservative majority of nearly 23,000 to win the seat. Davey said it was a &quot;watershed moment in our politics. Millions of people are fed up with Boris Johnson and his failure to provide leadership throughout the pandemic and last night the voters of North Shropshire spoke for all of them.&quot;

In October 2024, Davey said he was “very minded” to vote against the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill to legalise assisted dying for terminally ill adults, saying the UK should “do much better” on palliative care.

=== Foreign affairs ===
Since the 2000s, Davey has been vocal on the issue of detention without trial, in particular Guantanamo and Bagram, which he believed required transparency and formal investigation of torture allegations. He has opposed indefinite detention for illegal immigrants.

Davey has been in support of trade to import natural gas from countries including the United States and Qatar, and importation of green energy via new interconnectors from Norway and Ireland. Davey describes himself as a &quot;strong free-trader&quot;, rejecting reciprocity in trade tariffs as &quot;the classic protectionist argument&quot;. He believes Britain should be open to foreign investment, except for investment tainted by &quot;smells that you have from Putin.&quot; He dismisses worries over foreign ownership and investment in the British economy such as that of French and Chinese companies&#x27; involvement in the British energy market.

In November 2023, Davey expressed support for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip following the Israel–Hamas war, saying that &quot;it is increasingly clear that a military solution to eliminate Hamas is not possible. With a devastating humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, an ongoing hostage situation, and growing risk of regional escalation, we must urgently demand a different approach.&quot;

Following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, Davey said &quot;Political violence is wrong... We must all condemn this appalling attempt on Donald Trump&#x27;s life.&quot; However, after Trump won the 2024 United States presidential election, Davey said it was a “dark, dark day for people around the globe”, branded Trump a &quot;dangerous, destructive demagogue&quot;, and said that Trump &quot;actively undermines the rule of law, human rights, international trade, climate action and global security.&quot;

== Other ventures ==

=== Business appointments ===
Davey took up several business appointments after leaving his role as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change in May 2015.

Mongoose Energy appointed Davey as chairman in September 2015.

Davey set up an independent consultancy in September 2015 to provide advice on energy and climate change.

In January 2016 Davey was appointed as a part-time consultant to MHP Communications, the public relations and lobbying firm representing EDF Energy. Davey was criticised by press commentators for the potential conflict of interest between his previous role as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change and his role at MHP. As Secretary of State Davey awarded EDF the contract to build a new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset.

Davey&#x27;s appointment as Global Partner and non-Executive director of private equity investor Nord Engine Capital was announced in February 2016.

In July 2016 he became non-paid patron of the Sustainable Futures Foundation, a charity promoting environmental sustainability for the public benefit.

Until February 2021, Davey was on the advisory boards of the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills and of the fund manager NextEnergy Capital, which manages the listed company NextEnergy Solar Fund; he resigned both roles in the wake of the parliamentary second jobs controversy.

Davey is the Chair of the All-Party Britain-Republic of Korea Parliamentary Group (APPG). He is also the Chair of the APPG on Charity Retail, the Vice Chair of the APPG for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, and the Vice Chair of the APPG on Land Value Capture.

=== Christmas charity single ===
On 28 November 2024, Davey released the Christmas charity single &quot;Love is Enough&quot; featuring the Bath Philharmonia choir, entering the race to secure the Christmas number one. The song is &quot;a tribute to the caring responsibilities of young carers and the bond they share with the people they care for.&quot; His decision to do a Christmas song was inspired by his time as a chorister when he was a teenager. All money raised from downloads and streams of the song will go to the Carers Trust and Bath Philarmonia.

Davey said of the song: “I hope people listen to this song and download it and are as impressed as I am by the amazing talent of these young carers. I hope people take some time this Christmas to think about this amazing group of people who look after their loved ones from such an early age. This time of year is tough for all carers, particularly young ones – let&#x27;s put them in the spotlight.”

==Personal life==
In the summer of 2005 Davey married Emily Gasson, who was the Liberal Democrat candidate for North Dorset at the general election that year. Their first child, John, was born in December 2007. John has severe learning and physical disabilities due to an undiagnosed neurological condition, and requires round-the-clock care. This is provided for by Davey and his wife, as well as external carers, and is a key reason behind Davey&#x27;s advocacy for carers. Their son also has speech difficulties, spurring Davey&#x27;s interest in speech therapy. He and his wife have another child, a daughter named Ellie.

The family lives in Surbiton, London, where Davey lived before his election to Parliament in 1997. Emily fought the North Dorset seat again in the 2010 general election, and also had the number two position on the Lib Dem London-wide candidate list for the 2016 London Assembly elections, but was not elected. In the 2018 election, Emily stood for election as a councillor for the three-seat Norbiton Ward in 2018, part of the Royal Borough of Kingston Council, and topped the poll with 20% of the vote.

Davey speaks English, French, German and Spanish. He is a supporter of Notts County Football Club.

==Honours==
In 1995, Davey won a Royal Humane Society bravery award and commendation from the Chief constable of the British Transport Police for rescuing a woman who had fallen onto the railway line in the face of an oncoming train at Clapham Junction railway station.

In 2001 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA).

He was sworn in as a member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council on 8 February 2012, giving him the honorific prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.

Davey was knighted in the 2016 New Years Honours List for &#x27;political and public service&#x27;, enabling him to wear the Knight Bachelor neck decoration on occasions such as Remembrance Sunday.

<doc id="420173" wikidata="Q296866" url="?curid=420173" title="Geraint Davies (Labour politician)">
<text>Geraint Richard Davies (born 3 May 1960) is a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Swansea West from 2010 to 2024. He was elected as a member of the Labour and Co-operative Party, but was suspended from the party in 2023 and sat the remainder of his term as an independent. 

Previously, Davies was the Labour MP for Croydon Central from 1997 to 2005. He had also served as the Leader of Croydon London Borough Council.

== Early life and career ==
Geraint Davies was born on 3 May 1960 in Chester. His family comes from west Wales; his civil servant father is from Aberystwyth and his mother&#x27;s family are from Swansea. He was brought up in Cardiff where he attended Llanishen High School, before studying Mathematics then Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was Junior Common Room President. 

Davies joined Unilever as a Group Product Manager in 1982, and became Group Product Manager before joining Colgate-Palmolive as Marketing Manager. He then started his own companies including Pure Crete Ltd. and Equity Creative Ltd.

== Political career ==
Davies has been active in the Labour Party since 1982, being Assistant Secretary for Croydon North East Labour Party and Chair of Croydon Central Constituency Labour Party. He was a member of the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs, and later the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union. He has been a member of the Co-operative Party since 1984 and joined the GMB in 1985. Davies became Director of Pure Crete Ltd, described as a &#x27;Green tour operator&#x27;, in 1989.

Davies was elected to Croydon London Borough Council in 1986 representing New Addington ward, retaining the seat in 1990 and 1994. He became Chairman of the Housing Committee when Labour won control of Croydon London Borough Council in 1994.

He was elected Leader of the Council in 1996, resigning from the role and his council seat in 1997. He was also chair of the Housing Committee of the London Boroughs Association, the predecessor of London Councils, from 1996 to 1997.

== Parliamentary career ==
At the 1987 general election, Davies stood as the Labour Party candidate in Croydon South, coming third with 9.8% of the vote behind the incumbent Conservative MP William Clark and the Liberal Party candidate.

Davies stood in Croydon Central at the 1992 general election, coming second with 31.3% of the vote behind the Conservative candidate Paul Beresford. 

=== MP for Croydon Central ===
At the 1997 general election, Davies was elected to Parliament as MP for Croydon Central with 45.6% of the vote and a majority of 3,897. He was re-elected as MP for Croydon Central at the 2001 general election with an increased vote share of 47.2% and an increased majority of 3,984.

In February 2004, he was involved in a high-profile campaign for the release of British detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay, with Feroz Abbasi and Moazzam Begg finally released on 25 January 2005.

For the year 2004–05, Davies&#x27; MP costs, including staff and offices in Parliament and his constituency, were the highest in the country. Davies said &quot;this shows I was one of the most hard-working MPs in Britain.&quot; According to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; this included over £4,000 on a central London flat 12 miles from his constituency home and taxi expenses he should not have been entitled to claim because of his second home. He also spent £38,750 on postage which he claimed were the result of his constituency Croydon Central being virtually the biggest and, due to the Lunar House Home Office Immigration Department, arguably the busiest in the UK. &quot;Somebody has got to do the most work. I am proud it was me&quot;, he said. Davies repaid £156 used to post his annual report calendars by prepaid envelopes instead of stamps. Davies spent £2,285 on his kitchen and £1,500 on his living room at taxpayers&#x27; expense.

At the 2005 general election, Davies lost his seat to the Conservative candidate Andrew Pelling, coming second with 40.6% of the vote.

=== MP for Swansea West ===
Davies was elected to Parliament at the 2010 general election as MP for Swansea West with 34.7% of the vote and a majority of 504.

Following publicity of Davies&#x27; Bill in September 2014 to criminalise the distribution of sexually explicit images without consent on the internet (known as revenge porn), the offence of &quot;disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress&quot; was enacted as section 33 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015.

The WIkipedia article about Davies was one of a number edited ahead of the 2015 general election by computers inside Parliament, an act which the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported &quot;appears to be a deliberate attempt to hide embarrassing information from the electorate&quot;. In Davies&#x27;s case, the information deleted related to his expenses.

At the 2015 general election, Davies was re-elected as MP for Swansea West with an increased vote share of 42.6% and an increased majority of 7,036.

In December 2015, Davies published his Fracking (Measurement and Regulation of Impacts) (Air, Water and Greenhouse Gas Emissions) Bill, calling for strict limits on water contamination and fugitive methane emissions.

Sixty years after the Clean Air Act, Davies introduced the Clean Air Bill in September 2016 to curb emissions and develop sustainable transport systems by road, rail air and sea. This included air quality targets, vehicle testing reflecting on-road conditions, air pollution measurement and warnings, powers to restrict and ban diesel vehicles in urban centres, a national infrastructure of electric and hydrogen filling points and a fiscal strategy to incentivise consumers and producers towards cleaner vehicles. The latest version of Davies&#x27; Clean Air Bill was published in October, 2023.

At the snap 2017 general election, Davies was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 59.8% and an increased majority of 10,598.

Davies favoured a second referendum over Brexit. In August 2018, Davies wrote:

In the series of Parliamentary votes on Brexit in March 2019, Davies voted against the Labour Party whip and in favour of an amendment tabled by members of The Independent Group for a second public vote.

Davies was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 51.6% and a decreased majority of 8,116.

In November 2021, &quot;The Independent&quot; revealed that Davies is one of 16 MPs who claimed expenses to cover their residential rent payments despite letting out their own properties in London. In Davies&#x27; case, he claimed £67,000 in taxpayer funding to rent a home between November 2017 and April 2021 while collecting rental payments from a home he owns in the capital.

=== Party suspension ===
On 1 June 2023, Davies was suspended from the Labour Party after five women accused him of sexual harassment. &quot;Politico Europe&quot; reported, based on interviews with those who had worked with Davies, that he had a reputation of &quot;excessive drinking, sexual comments and unwanted touching&quot; toward &quot;younger women in the workplace&quot;. Two of his colleagues claimed Davies had &quot;boasted&quot; about bringing sex workers into parliament for drinks.

The next day, the Labour Party received a second formal complaint regarding Davies&#x27; conduct. On 5 June, a third formal complaint was made against Davies according to Sky News.

===Retirement===
On 28 May 2024, Davies announced that he would step down as an MP at the 2024 general election.

<text>Thomas Hilton Dawson (born 30 September 1953) is a British politician who was the Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Lancaster and Wyre from 1997 until 2005.

Dawson became the chairman of the North East Party in 2014, and was the party&#x27;s candidate in the 2021 Hartlepool by-election.

<text>Pachypodium lamerei is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is a stem succulent, photosynthesizing mainly through its trunk, and comes from the island of Madagascar, off the east coast of Africa. It has large thorns and leaves mostly just at the top of the plant, and large, fragrant flowers. The species has become one of the best known pachypodiums in cultivation, being relatively easy to propagate and grow. In cultivation it is often marketed as the Madagascar palm, despite its not being a palm at all. A variety called &quot;Ramosum&quot; has been described. It is distinguished mostly by a dwarf growth habit and its more rounded corolla lobe.

==Description==
&quot;Pachypodium lamerei&quot; has a tall, silvery-gray trunk covered with sharp 6.25 cm spines. Long, narrow leaves grow only at the top of the trunk, like a palm tree. It rarely branches. Plants grown outdoors will reach up to , but when grown indoors it will slowly reach tall.

Plants grown outdoors develop large, white, fragrant flowers at the top of the plant. They rarely flower indoors.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Pachypodium lamerei&quot; grows best in warm climates and full sun. It will not tolerate hard frosts, and will likely drop most of its leaves if exposed to even a light frost. It is easy to grow as a houseplant, if you can provide the sunlight it needs. Use a fast-draining potting mix, such as a cactus mix and pot in a container with drainage holes to prevent root rot.

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>Janet Elizabeth Ann Dean (&quot;née&quot; Gibson; born 28 January 1949) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Burton from 1997 to 2010.

== Early life ==
Born Janet Gibson in Crewe, she was educated at the Verdin Grammar School in Winsford. On leaving school in 1965 she became a clerk at Barclays Bank, before moving to Bass Charrington in 1969.

==Politics==
She was elected as a councillor to the Staffordshire County Council in 1981 and to the East Staffordshire District Council in 1991, becoming its mayor in 1996. She was also elected to the Uttoxeter Town Council in 1995. She stepped down from all three councils on her election to Parliament.

Dean was selected to stand for election for Labour through an all-women shortlist. She was elected to the House of Commons in the 1997 general election, winning Burton from the sitting Conservative MP, Ivan Lawrence, by 6,330 votes. She made her maiden speech on 30 July 1997. In Parliament, Dean was a member of the Catering Select committee from her election until 2005. Dean was a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee from 1999, and since the 2005 general election, she has also been a member of the Speaker&#x27;s Panel of Chairmen.

She was a loyal backbencher although rebelling against the privatisation of air traffic control in 2000, a local issue given the proximity of her constituency to the East Midlands Airport. She was the chairperson of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Lupus – an issue close to her heart, as both her mother and husband died from it. 

On 20 June 2007, Dean announced her intention to stand down at the next general election. Her seat was gained by Andrew Griffiths of the Conservative Party.

== Personal life ==
She married Alan Dean in 1968 and became a full-time mother in 1970 following the birth of the first of their two daughters. She was widowed in 1994.
