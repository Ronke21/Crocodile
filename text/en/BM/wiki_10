<text>Danone S.A. () is a French multinational food-products corporation based in Paris. It was founded in 1919 in Barcelona, Spain. It is listed on Euronext Paris, where it is a component of the CAC 40 stock market index. Some of the company&#x27;s products are branded Dannon in the United States.

As of 2018, Danone sold products in 120 markets, and, in 2018, had sales of €24.65 billion. In the first half of 2018, 29% of sales came from specialized nutritional preparations, 19% came from branded bottled water, and 52% came from dairy and plant-based products (including yogurt).

==History==
===Name===

Danone was founded by Isaac Carasso (born İzak Karasu), a Thessaloniki-born Sephardic Jewish physician from the Ottoman Empire, who began producing yogurt in Barcelona, Spain in 1919. The brand was named Danone, which translates to &quot;little Daniel&quot;, after his son Daniel Carasso.

In 1929, Isaac Carasso moved the company from Spain to France, opening a plant in Paris. In 1942, Daniel Carasso moved the company to New York. In the United States, Daniel Carasso partnered with the Swiss-born Spaniard Juan Metzger and changed the brand name to Dannon to sound more American.

In 1951, Daniel Carasso returned to Paris to manage the family&#x27;s businesses in France and Spain, and the American business was sold to Beatrice Foods in 1959; it was repurchased by Danone in 1981. In Europe in 1967, Danone merged with Gervais, the leading fresh cheese producer in France, and became Gervais Danone.

In 1973, the company merged with bottle maker Boussois-Souchon-Neuvesel (BSN), which was formed by the merger of Glaces de Boussois, France&#x27;s 2nd-largest producer of flat glass, with Lyon-based Verreries Souchon-Neuvesel, France&#x27;s top producer of bottles and jars. Souchon-Neuvesel, based in the Lyon region, produced bottles, industrial containers, flacons and table glassware (container glass). Glaces de Boussois, located in northern France, made windows for the building and automobile industries (plate glass). Three years earlier BSN had merged with Evian, Kronenbourg, Société Européenne de Brasseries and Blédina.

The company changed its name to Groupe Danone in 1983.

===Strategic reorientation (1970–2000)===
The acquisitions initially took the shape of vertical integration, with BSN acquiring Alsatian brewer Kronenbourg and Evian branded mineral water who were the glassmaker&#x27;s largest customers. This move provided content with which to fill the factory&#x27;s bottles. In 1973, the company merged with Gervais Danone and began to expand internationally, including a rebranding of the Dannon yogurt brand in the U.S. and a successful ad campaign In Soviet Georgia that started in October 1976. In 1979, the company abandoned glassmaking by disposing of Verreries Boussois. In 1987, Gervais Danone acquired European biscuit manufacturer Générale Biscuit, owners of the LU brand, and, in 1989, it bought out the European biscuit operations of Nabisco, The operation included UK manufacturers Huntley and Palmers, Peek Frean, and Jacob&#x27;s, which had previously merged to form Associated Biscuits Ltd.

In 1994, BSN changed its name to Groupe Danone, adopting the name of the group&#x27;s best-known international brand. Franck Riboud succeeded his father, Antoine, as the company&#x27;s chairman and chief executive officer in 1996 when Riboud senior retired. Under Riboud junior, the company continued to pursue its focus on three product groups (dairy, beverages, and cereals) and divested itself of several activities which had become non-core including Amora, Liebig, and Maille brands.
In 1999 and 2003, the group sold 56% and 44% respectively of its glass-containers business.

===21st century===
In 2000, the group also sold most of its European beer activities (the brand Kronenbourg and the brand 1664 were sold to Scottish &amp; Newcastle for £1.7 billion. Its Italian cheese and meat businesses (Egidio Galbani Spa) were sold in March 2002; as were its beer producing activities in China.

The company&#x27;s British (&quot;Jacob&#x27;s&quot;) and Irish biscuit operations were sold to United Biscuits in September 2004. In August 2005, the Group sold its sauces business in the United Kingdom and in the United States (HP Foods), in January 2006, its sauces business in Asia (Amoy Food) was sold to Ajinomoto. Despite these divestitures, Danone continues to expand internationally in its three core business units, emphasising health and well-being products.

In July 2007, it was announced that Danone had reached agreement with Kraft Foods Inc (now Mondelēz International) to sell most of its biscuits division, including the LU and Prince brands but excluding Latin American (Bagley) and Indian (Britannia Industries) units, for around €5.3 billion. Also in July 2007, a €12.3 billion cash offer by Danone for the Dutch baby food and clinical nutrition company Numico was agreed to by both boards, creating the world&#x27;s second-largest manufacturer of baby food.

===Dairy-focused business (2010–present)===
In 2009, the company changed its name from Groupe Danone to Danone.

In 2007 Danone spent 12.3 billion euros on the purchase of the baby and medical nutrition business of Dutch rival Numico.

In 2010 Danone plunged into the Russian market by acquiring OAO Unimilk&#x27;s companies. The share of Unimilk was 21% of the Russian market. Danone was to hold 57.5 percent of the capital; it funded the acquisition by writing put options for Unimilk share owners. In 2009 Unimilk sales revenue was 969 million euros. As of the merger, Unimilk had 28 facilities in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. The united Danone-Unimilk company had 18,000 employees in the Commonwealth of Independent States.

The Wockhardt group&#x27;s nutrition activities in India were acquired by Danone in 2012.

In mid-February 2013 Danone announced their intention to cut 900 jobs or about 3.3 percent of their 27,000 person European workforce.

Since 2013, Danone has grown on the African continent, notably with the acquisition of a controlling interest in Centrale Danone in Morocco and equity interests in Fan Milk in West Africa and Brookside in Kenya.

In 2014, Emmanuel Faber became CEO.

Danone was present in 130 markets and generated sales of US$25.7 billion in 2016, with more than half in developing countries. In 2015, fresh dairy products represented 50% of the group&#x27;s total sales, baby food 22%, branded water 21%, and medical nutrition 7%. In 2017, Franck Riboud became honorary chairman and Faber became chairman as well as retaining his CEO position.

In 2018, Danone rebranded its DanoneWave subsidiary, formed after the 2017 acquisition of WhiteWave Foods (Alpro), into Danone North America.

In 2020, Danone announced that It would cut up to 2,000 jobs as part of a reorganization. This amounted to about 2% of its workforce.

In late 2020, the entry of the London-based hedge fund Bluebell Capital as a shareholder of Danone put Faber’s position into question. In a letter sent to all shareholders in November 2020, they qualified Danone&#x27;s stock market performance under Faber of overall &quot;disappointing&quot;, arguing that &quot;the right balance between shareholder value creation and sustainability issues&quot; had not been struck under his tenure. After the publication of only slightly comforting 2020 results and disappointing first trimester turnover figures, Bluebell Capital&#x27;s activism paid off and Faber was ousted in mid-March 2021.

On May 16, 2021, the arrival of Antoine Bernard de Saint-Affrique as the next CEO of Danone was announced, to be effective on September 15.

In 2023, Danone Manifesto Ventures, the venture-capital arm of Danone invests in Israel cell-based dairy and infant-milk producer Wilk.

In July 2023 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine had put multinational businesses in a delicate position, Russia seized control of Danone Rossiye, putting it under &quot;temporary management&quot; of the state. In February 2024 it was rumoured that Ramzan Kadyrov or his nephew Yakub Zakriev would take over the unit, for under $200 million. On 13 March Vladimir Putin decreed the removal of the temporary management order; this opened the way for a sale of the unit.

In some areas, Danone has adopted a strategy of growth through joint ventures, particularly in fast-growing emerging markets which represent over 50% of its sales.

Danone signed joint ventures with Al Safi in Saudi Arabia (2001), Yakult in India (2005) and Vietnam (2006), Alquería in Colombia (2007), and Mengniu in China (2013–2014).

===Australia===
Danone Murray Goulburn is a joint Saputo Dairy Australia venture with French food company Danone – to market yoghurt and other fresh dairy products in Australia. Danone-MG dairy foods are produced at Kiewa in north east Victoria and are sold throughout Australia.

===Bangladesh===
In November 2005, Franck Riboud met Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank and later winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. The two men discussed at length their ideas on the development of poor countries and found that their areas of expertise were complementary. As a result, in 2006, the Grameen Bank and Danone formed a company called Grameen Danone Foods, a social business in Bangladesh.

Grameen Danone Foods Ltd. produces a yoghurt called Shokti Doi containing protein, vitamins, iron, calcium, zinc, and other micronutrients aimed to fill nutritional deficits of children in Bangladesh. Shokti Doi is sold for six euro cents, a price that studies found to be affordable for the poorest families. Its pursuit of profitability is based solely on criteria such as improving public health, creating jobs, reducing poverty and protecting the environment. Profits earned by the company are re-invested in expanding and running the business.

===India===
Danone started its nutrition business in India in 2012 through the acquisition of the nutrition portfolio from Wockhardt Group. Danone India offers a range of specialized products across life stages that includes pregnancy, infants, young children as well as adults, under Indian and global brands like Aptamil, Neocate, Farex, Protinex, Dexolac and Nusobee. Headquartered in Mumbai. In 2018, Danone reduced its product portfolio and discontinued some dairy SKUs to bring a sharper focus on its nutrition offerings.

=== Israel ===
In March 1996 Danone signed an agreement to purchase 20 percent of the Strauss Group, Israel&#x27;s second largest food manufacturer. Since the 1970s, Strauss Dairies had a series of partnership and knowledge agreements with Danone.

===Saudi Arabia===
In 2001, Al-Safi and Danone formed a partnership.

===China===
Danone has invested in China since 1987 with the joint venture with Fengxing Milk in Guangzhou. It is one of Danone&#x27;s top 5 markets.

====Bright Dairy====
In 2001, Danone acquired a 5% stake in Bright Dairy and, in March 2005, doubled its shareholding, and again, to 20%, in April 2006, becoming the third largest shareholder after Shanghai Milk Group and S.I. Food.

The parties announced in October 2007 that Danone would divest its stake by selling it to the other two main shareholders at a small profit. Bright Dairy said Danone would pay 330m yuan (€31m) to terminate the existing distribution and production agreement with it.

====Wahaha====

The Hangzhou Wahaha Group, the largest beverage producer in China, and Danone entered into a dairy products joint venture in 1996, in which Danone held 51%. It was hailed by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as a &quot;showcase&quot; joint venture.

Yet in 2005, Danone noted that alongside the 39 structures of the joint venture, 60 factories and distribution companies produce and sell beverages illegally under the Wahaha brand. Danone made several attempts to take a stake in the Wahaha companies external to the joint venture, but was rebuffed by Wahaha&#x27;s General Manager Zong Qinghou. Danone and Zong Qinghou had signed a deal in December 2006 allowing Danone to buy a majority stake in these non-JV operations. However, Zong had second thoughts about the deal and reneged, claiming the offer was underpriced and held out for a higher price from Danone.

The dispute took on the shape of a trademark dispute, and Danone filed for arbitration in Stockholm on 9 May 2007. On 4 June, Danone filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Ever Maple Trading and Hangzhou Hongsheng Beverage Co Ltd, companies controlled by Zong, his wife, and daughter.

In 2009, an agreement was reached between the two parties. Danone left the Danone–Wahaha joint venture and sold its shares (51%) to its former Chinese partner.

====Mengniu====
On 20 May 2013, Danone announced a strategic investment (4.0%) in Mengniu, the top dairy products company in China, through an agreement with COFCO (the state-owned largest food company in China a majority shareholder in Mengniu). Later on, Danone raised its interest in Mengniu from 4.0% to 9.9%. In 2016, Danone is Mengniu&#x27;s second shareholder.

In addition, in May 2013, a joint-venture was created between Danone and Mengniu to grow the fresh dairy product category.

On 31 October 2014, Danone, Mengniu and Yashili announced that they had signed an agreement allowing Danone to take part in a private placement by Yashili totalling €437 million, at a price of HK$3.70 per share. Upon completion of the subscription, Mengniu and Danone respectively held 51.0% and 25.0% equity interest in Yashili.

=== Russia ===
On 18 June 2010, Danone partnered with Unimilk, one of Russia&#x27;s main milk producers. Danone and Unimilk merged their fresh dairy products activities in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus. The joint-venture gave birth to the number one dairy products company in this region. Russia became one of the five most important markets for Danone.

In October 2022, Danone announced the start of the process of transferring its Russian segment to new owners. By this point, Russia provided about 5% of the company&#x27;s total revenue. The company considered about two dozen possible applicants for its assets, but as of July 2023, the &quot;successor&quot; has not been decided. In the meantime, Danone rebranded one of its top brands: Activia in the Russian market becoming Aktibio. The company said that this will allow renewed investment in the Russian dairy industry. In July 2023, the Russian government seized the shares in Danone Russia and placed it under the control of the Russian Federal Agency for State Property Management. On July 18, Ibragim Zakriev, the Minister of Agriculture of Chechnya and the nephew of its President Ramzan Kadyrov, was appointed General Director of the Russian Danone. As of 26 July 2023 Danone has provided €700 million for the loss of Russian business, plus €500 million exchange loss due to the fall in the ruble.

=== Africa ===
In June 2012, Danone raised its interest in Centrale Laitière (leader of the dairy products market in Morocco) to 67.0%. Centrale Laitière is Danone&#x27;s first franchise ever: the companies have worked together since 1953.

In October 2013, Danone teamed up with Abraaj Group to acquire FanMilk International, the leading manufacturer and distributor of frozen dairy products and juices in Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Benin and Ivory Coast.

In July 2014, Danone announced the acquisition of a 40% interest in Kenya&#x27;s Brookside, East Africa&#x27;s leading dairy products group.

=== Philippines ===
In October 2014, Danone partnered with Universal Robina to build a beverage production and distribution business in the Philippines.

== Danone Institute ==
The Danone Institute is a nonprofit organization established to promote research, information and education about nutrition, diet and public health. One of the organization&#x27;s main objectives was to increase nutrition knowledge amongst medical professionals, educators and parents.

The company set up its first Institute in 1991 in Paris, France, and officially launched as a private nonprofit organization in 1997.

The institute is led by nutrition experts and Danone company executives.

=== Danone Institutes around the world ===
By 2007, Danone had set up 18 institutes in countries around the world to develop programs that address local public health issues. The institutes are located in Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Spain, the United States, and Turkey.

They operate under the aegis of the Danone Institute International. The Danone Institute International is responsible for steering the network, and encouraging a continual exchange between the various countries.

Today, more than 200 experts in diet and nutrition are involved in this international network.

Each institute is composed of a board of directors and a scientific council. Each board includes 8 members. The board members are responsible for setting the strategic direction and budget for the organization. The scientific council that is composed of from 6 to 10 members, takes future programmatic decisions.

The institutes develop educational programs in their countries to deal with local health and nutrition issues. Each institute therefore develops its own program in order to be relevant in their environment. For instance, the Czech Danone Institute provides a fund to support research, development and education in nutrition, and scholarships abroad.

Each local Danone Institute develops specific programs including:
* Support research programs: scholarships, grants, awards, prizes
* Publications of research findings relating to health and nutrition
* Organization of scientific conferences
* Publication of newsletters and books for professionals (e.g., health care professionals, educators, journalists)
* Organization of workshops, training and educational sessions for professionals
* Production of pedagogic material, booklets, television and radio programs, PC games for parents, children...
* Spread the knowledge to the public

Throughout the world, the Danone Institutes continue to be nonprofit organizations.

The Danone Institutes gather internationally renowned scientists in diet and nutrition from independent organizations (e.g.: universities, research centers).

From 1991 to 2006, more than 40 prizes and awards have been attributed for more than €600,000. Over 140 events have gathered more than 30,000 health care professionals. And 75 publications have been published. More than 70 programs towards the public have been organized.

To date, Danone Institutes have funded more than 900 research projects. This represents a global budget of €16 million. They have set up dozens of educational programs. 100 symposia have been launched.

=== Danone Institute International ===
The Danone Institute International was established in 2004 to gather together the 18 Danone Institutes. Its goal is to develop large-scale international programs. It also aims at encouraging the sharing of the knowledge between the local institutes. It facilitates cooperation, collaboration and exchange between scientists.

Danone Institute International is a nonprofit organization originally established with funding from Danone. The association promotes the exchange of information related to the relationship between diet, nutrition and health.

The Danone Institute International comprises more than 220 scientific experts, and may be considered as a think tank. This international network gathers renowned scientists from various fields such as clinical nutrition, pediatric medicine, microbiology, gastroenterology, and psychology.

The Danone Institute International produces publications, supports research via grants, programs and a prize. The DII also organizes international academic conferences and symposia.

The Danone International Prize For Nutrition is a cornerstone in the work of the Danone Institute International.

=== Danone International Prize for Nutrition ===
The Danone International Prize for Nutrition is an award established in 1997 by the Danone Institute International, presented every two years to honour individuals or teams that have advanced the science of human nutrition.

The prize aims at encouraging nutrition research and promoting the public&#x27;s understanding of the importance of this field.

This award is one of the most respected awards within the field of nutritional research. Many leading scientists received this award, that recognizes their accomplishments.

The Danone International Prize for Nutrition is worth €120,000. The prize is awarded every two years by the Danone Institute International and organized with the support of the French organization Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale.

The Danone International Prize for Nutrition recognizes a single researcher or a research team as leading a major step in nutrition, developing novel concepts, including research fields with potential application for populations.

The jury consists of up to nine members, including one member of the Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale. 50% of the jury members come from the Danone Institute International or the Danone Institutes. The jury selects one winner by a secret vote. In case of a tie, the chair&#x27;s vote counts as two votes.

Danone Institute International selected in 2007 Friedman through a process involving more than 650 applicants worldwide. Candidates must be employed by a not-for-profit institution and actively involved in research. Laureates are chosen after an independent and international selection procedure.

This prize has been renamed the Danone International Prize for Alimentation in 2018.

=== Global summit on the health effects of yogurt ===
In 2012, the Danone Institute International in collaboration with the American Society for Nutrition (ASN) organized an international working group to examine the health effects of yogurt. They communicated their scientific conclusion to health care professionals and the public. One year later, the ASN and the Danone Institute International joined forces to launch the first global summit on the health effects of yogurt.

This event aims at evaluating the state of science as concerns yogurt consumption and public health.

The first summit took place in 2013 in Boston. It featured international experts in medicine and nutrition. Since that time, summits have been held every year.

=== Yogurt in Nutrition Initiative for a balanced diet ===
In 2013, the Danone Institute International, the American Society for Nutrition (ASN) and the Nutrition Society (NS) launched the Yogurt in Nutrition Initiative for a balanced diet. This program aims at examining the health effects of yogurt, encouraging research around yogurt as part of a healthy diet and communicating scientific information toward health care professionals and the public.

Through this project, the Danone Institute International plans to organize worldwide conferences to share researchers&#x27; findings. From 2013, the Yogurt in Nutrition Initiative for a balanced diet co-organizes every year Global Summit on the Health Effects of Yogurt.

The Danone Institute International in collaboration with the American Society for Nutrition and the International Osteoporosis Foundation also organizes the Yogurt in Nutrition Award. This prize is offered by the Yogurt in Nutrition Initiative for a balanced diet. This award, valued at US$30,000, supports projects focused on the role of yogurt in the prevention and management of diseases. It finances research programs for two years. It recognizes individuals or research teams from public organizations, universities or hospitals.

== Corporate social responsibility ==
Danone operates several funds including: danone.communities, created in 2007 to finance social business, the Danone Ecosystem Fund, created in 2009 to provide support to Danone partners including farmers, subcontractors, and vendors, and Livelihoods, created in 2011 in order to finance environment-related projects (such as peasant agriculture, deforestation, access to energy in emerging countries) and in return provide investors with carbon credits with strong social intensity.

Danone&#x27;s corporate social responsibility programs were influenced by former CEO, Antoine Riboud, and a speech he gave on 25 October 1972 known as the &quot;Marseilles speech&quot;.

In this speech, he stated that growth should not take place without corporate social responsibility. He was the first CEO to publicly state that human and environment aspects of a company should be taken into account. These ideas laid the ground to Danone&#x27;s dual project (economic and social).

==Controversies==

===2005–2006: the PepsiCo acquisition case===
Due to its narrow focus and relatively small size, Danone is potentially an attractive takeover target for its competitors, namely Nestlé and Kraft Foods. In mid-July 2005, the share price of Danone rose 20% within two weeks on rumours of a bid approach by PepsiCo, although this intention was denied. Upon realising that a takeover of a national treasure such as Danone by a foreign company was indeed possible in the capital markets, the &quot;economically patriotic&quot; French government stepped in by drafting a law to protect companies in &quot;strategic industries&quot; such as Danone from takeover. This has been dubbed the &quot;Danone Law&quot;.

Speculation was renewed once again in mid-2006, when PepsiCo declared its intention to grow significantly in France through a sizeable non-hostile acquisition, and Kraft was also reported in &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, a French daily newspaper, as not having ruled out an acquisition on French soil. The stock market apparently marked down the possibility of a bid by PepsiCo following Danone&#x27;s acquisition of Numico.

=== 2010–2013 ===
In the 2010s, reports indicated that Danone engaged in unethical marketing of infant formula in China, Indonesia, Turkey, and India.

==== India ====
In the early 2010s, Nutricia India (Danone) purchased Wockhardt, which thereby provided Danone with an entry to India&#x27;s infant nutrition market. Nutricia later ordered and scheduled an external audit of payments made and invoices received from March through August 2013 and found no payments to doctors. However, critics contended the company directed the course of the audit, and more importantly, scheduled the audit so that it did not cover the crucial handover period. In fact, it was scheduled nearly a year after the purchase. A policy director for Baby Milk Action stated that Nutricia &quot;seems to be using the audit as a cover&quot;.

India passed a law pertaining to Infant Milk Substitutes (IMS) in 1992 and strengthened this law in 2003. These prohibit any kind of advertisement of infant formula for children 0–2, as well as prohibit monetary benefits to doctors for recommending formula. Still, major companies including Danone have been criticized for sponsoring such things as nutritional conferences and web platforms for doctors. (Other companies include Nestle, Abbott, and Mead Johnson.)
Dexolac is the name of Danone&#x27;s infant milk substitute product. Overall in India, approximately 50% of infants under six months of age are exclusively breastfed, and 50% are not.

====China====
In October 2012, a Save the Children survey was conducted in the cities of Hohhot, Beijing, Jinan, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Shenzhen. Sixty mothers of infants 0–6 months were interviewed in each city. 40% of the mothers interviewed said they had received formula samples. Of these, 60% were provided by company representatives, and over one-third by healthcare workers. The mothers reported that samples were provided by (in order of frequency): Dumex (Danone, and since May 2016 Yashili), Enfamil (Mead Johnson), Wyeth, Abbott, Nestlé, Friso, Ausnutria and Bei-yin-mei. The overall 2013 Save the Children report which includes this 2012 survey states, &quot;If new mothers are given free samples to feed to their babies it can start a vicious circle that undermines their own ability to breastfeed. An infant satiated with formula may demand less breast milk, so the mother produces less, and that can result in her losing confidence in her ability to breastfeed.&quot;

==== Indonesia subsidiary ====
In February 2013 &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that up until 2011, Danone subsidiary Sari Husada had midwives sign contracts to receive financial payments for selling a certain number of boxes of baby formula. According to Danone, this no longer happens, and has been replaced by a scheme which runs training for midwives. However, the main difference appears to be a change from cash to merchandise such as televisions or laptops, and often including items which are needed in the midwives&#x27; practices, such as oxygen canisters, TENS machines, and nebulisers. &quot;The Guardian&quot; has seen a spreadsheet detailing the number of new mothers contacted, the amount of 0–6 months formula sold, and the proportion of their target this represents. Danone commented: &quot;That may still be happening, that&#x27;s something we need to address.&quot;

This same article reported that Sari Husada (Danone) had links throughout the Indonesian medical system. For example, Sari Husada sponsored professional associations, paid doctors for running seminars for midwives, and even sponsored midwifery awards which were then presented by the Indonesian Minister for Women&#x27;s Empowerment and the Protection of Children.

There are two potential harms to promoting infant formula in poorer communities: (1) the parents and families may not have dependable access to clean water, and (2) the ongoing cost is such a significant part of the family budget that parents are highly motivated to attempt to &quot;stretch&quot; the product, with risk of malnourishment to infant or child. An Indonesian paediatrician stated, &quot;Selling formula is like the killing fields, in my opinion. The babies will die of diarrhoea and they will die of malnutrition.&quot;

==== Turkey marketing campaign ====
In June 2013 the organisation was accused in Turkey of &quot;misleading mothers with a marketing campaign that warned they might not be providing enough breast milk to their babies [and suggesting] mothers use its powdered baby milk to make up any shortfall&quot;. Danone responded that it &quot;based its advice on WHO guidance&quot; and claimed that both the WHO and UNICEF &quot;endorsed the campaign.&quot; The WHO said Danone did not have permission to use its logo and asked Danone to remove its name from the company&#x27;s marketing materials within 14 days while Ayman Abulaban, the UNICEF representative for Turkey, said: &quot;The Unicef Turkey office has not endorsed this campaign.&quot; UNICEF also requested that their name be removed from marketing materials.

===Fonterra New Zealand alert===
Following a statement by the New Zealand government and Fonterra on 2 August 2013 warning that batches of ingredients supplied by Fonterra to four Danone plants in Asia-Pacific might be contaminated with &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; bacteria, Danone recalled selected infant formula products from sale in eight markets (New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand) as a precautionary measure.

The alert was lifted on 28 August when New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries concluded after several weeks of tests that there was no &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; in any of the batches concerned. None of the many tests conducted by Danone before and after this period showed any contamination.

On 8 January 2014, Danone announced its decision to terminate its existing supply contract with Fonterra and make any further collaboration contingent on a commitment by its supplier to full transparency and compliance with the food safety procedures applied to all products supplied to Danone. Danone won damages of €105 million from Fonterra.
===Price fixing===
In 2019 the Spanish regulator fined Danone 929,644 euros for forming a cartel with other dairy companies to avoid competition when buying milk from Spanish farmers between 2000 and 2013.
In February 2024, the Spanish annulled the fine as the statute of limitations have passed for Danone.

<text>The People&#x27;s Justice Party (; abbrev: PKR or KEADILAN), is a reformist political party in Malaysia formed on 3 August 2003 through a merger of the party&#x27;s predecessor, the National Justice Party, with the socialist Malaysian People&#x27;s Party. The party&#x27;s predecessor was founded by Wan Azizah Wan Ismail during the height of the Reformasi movement on 4 April 1999 after the arrest of her husband, former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. At the 2022 Malaysian general election, the PH coalition which the PKR was part of was returned to power again, albeit without a majority, leading it to form a unity government with political rivals. The party is one of main partners of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) ruling coalition in Malaysia.

In the first general elections contested by the party in 1999, the party won five seats in the Dewan Rakyat. A resurgence of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition in the 2004 general elections reduced the party to just one seat. However, an election wave in the 2008 general elections favoring the opposition increased the party&#x27;s parliamentary representation to 31 seats, as well as allowing them to form the government in 5 states. This triggered the resignation of Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and a lift on the five-year political ban imposed on Anwar Ibrahim on 14 April 2008. 

The Pakatan Harapan coalition defeated Barisan Nasional, which had ruled the country for 60 years since independence, in the 2018 general elections, allowing the coalition to form the government. However, defections from within PKR as well as the withdrawal of the Malaysian United Indigenous Party (BERSATU) from the coalition caused the collapse of the PH government after just 22 months in power, culminating in the 2020 Malaysian political crisis that resulted in the rise of the Perikatan Nasional government with ally-turned-enemy Muhyiddin Yassin at the helm. The PH coalition would return to power once again after the 2022 elections. The elections produced a hung parliament for the first time in the country&#x27;s history, but an alliance with other parties allowed Anwar Ibrahim to become the 10th Prime Minister of Malaysia through a unity government with his political rivals in Barisan Nasional as well as other political coalitions and parties to achieve a two-thirds majority in the Dewan Rakyat.

The party enjoys strong support from urban states such as Selangor, Penang, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Johor, as well as the capital city of Kuala Lumpur. It promotes an agenda with a strong emphasis on social justice and anti-corruption, as well as adopting a platform that seeks to abolish the New Economic Policy to replace it with an economic policy that takes a non-ethnic approach in poverty eradication and correcting economic imbalances.

== History ==
=== Early years ===

The economy of Malaysia was affected by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance at the time, Anwar Ibrahim has instituted a series of economic reforms and austerity measures in response. These actions were exacerbated when he tabled controversial amendments to the Anti-Corruption Act that sought to increase the powers of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC). The then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad disagreed with these measures and ultimately sacked Anwar from all his posts. This incident and the circumstances in which it happened led to a public outcry in what became known as the &quot;Reformasi&quot; movement, but it also resulted in the arrest and subsequent incarceration of Anwar on what many believed to be politically motivated charges of sexual misconduct and corruption.

The movement, which began while the country hosted the Commonwealth Games, initially demanded the resignation of Malaysia&#x27;s then-Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, and for the end of alleged corruption and cronyism within the Barisan Nasional-led (BN) government. It would go on to become a reformist movement demanding social equality and social justice in Malaysia. The movement consisted of civil disobedience, demonstrations, sit-ins, rioting, occupations and online activism.

===Foundation===
Once Anwar had been detained, the &quot;Reformasi movement&quot; continued to develop, with &quot;Justice for Anwar&quot; remaining a potent rallying call. Before his arrest, Anwar had designated his wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, as the successor of the movement. Wan Azizah developed an enormous following, attracting thousands to her speeches. For a time, these followers held massive weekend street demonstrations, mostly in Kuala Lumpur but also occasionally in Penang and other cities, for &quot;keadilan&quot; (justice) and against Mahathir.

Building on the momentum of &quot;Reformasi&quot;, a political movement called the Social Justice Movement (), also known as ADIL, was launched on 10 December 1998 and was led by Wan Azizah. However, facing difficulties in registering ADIL as a political party, the Reformasi movement instead merged with the Muslim Community Union of Malaysia (), a minor Islamic political party based in Terengganu, and relaunched it as the National Justice Party (), also known as PKN or KeADILan, on 4 April 1999. The registration was just in time for the new party to take part in the 1999 general elections. The launch of KeADILan put to rest months of speculation about whether Wan Azizah and Anwar would merely remain in ADIL, join PAS, or try to stage a coup against UMNO. Although Keadilan was multiracial, its primary target was middle-class, middle-of-the-road Malays, particularly from UMNO. The party has been noted as having rough similarities with the now-defunct multi-racial social democratic Parti Keadilan Masyarakat Malaysia. The party was joined by the Democratic Action Party (DAP), the Malaysian People&#x27;s Party (PRM) and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) in a big tent alliance of liberals, socialists, and Islamists known as Barisan Alternatif to take on the ruling BN coalition in the 1999 general elections.

====Arrests====
Between 27 and 30 September 1999, seven activists, including Keadilan leaders; Vice-President Tian Chua, Gobalakrishnan Nagapan, Youth leader Mohd Ezam Mohd Nor, Fairus Izuddin and Dr Badrul Amin Baharun; were arrested and as a result prevented from contesting in the elections. Further arrests were made on 10 April 2001 and those arrested were subsequently charged and incarcerated under the Internal Security Act. They became known as the Reformasi 10.

=== 1999 general election ===
The legislative elections of 29 November 1999 were convened in advance, the pretext being the start of Ramadan. As the outgoing Parliament was dissolved on 11 November, the campaign was very short, drawing strong criticism from the opposition. The party entered the campaign with many of its key leaders under arrest along with many disadvantages, as the short campaign was marked by the distribution of pornographic videocassettes implicating former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar in the villages, as well as the opposition having a lack of access to written and audiovisual media. As a result of the mounting disadvantages, the election saw the party winning only five parliamentary seats in the elections despite gaining 11.67% of the total votes cast. However, Wan Azizah was elected as the Member of Parliament for Permatang Pauh; the seat formerly held by her husband, Anwar Ibrahim, with a majority of 9,077 votes. The Barisan Alternatif as a whole gained 40.21% of the total votes cast with PAS winning 27 seats and DAP winning ten seats. The big opposition winner was PAS, which gained 20 seats as well as a majority in two Assemblies in the northern States of Kelantan and Terangganu. As for the BN coalition of Mahathir Mohamad, it however scored a two-thirds majority with 148 seats (despite losing 14 seats). Nevertheless, the BN coalition lost power in two of the thirteen states, along with four members of Mahathir&#x27;s Cabinet who also lost their seats. For the first time in Malaysia&#x27;s history, UMNO, the dominant Malay-based party which had ruled the country for 40 years since independence, received less than half of the total vote of ethnic Malays.

=== Merger with &quot;Parti Rakyat Malaysia&quot; ===
The post election period saw negotiations between KeADILan and &quot;Parti Rakyat Malaysia&quot; on a possible merger. Despite some opposition in both parties to the move, a 13-point Memorandum of Understanding was eventually signed by the two parties on 5 July 2002. On 3 August 2003, the new merged entity was officially launched and assumed its current name. Somehow, as PRM had yet to be de-registered by the authorities, the remained dissidents convened a National Congress in Johor Bahru and elected a new Executive Committee led by former PRM youth leader, Hassan Abdul Karim to resume political activities on 17 April 2005.
=== 2004 general election ===
As the new amendments to the party constitution had yet to be approved by the Registrar of Societies, candidates from PRM contested the 2004 general election using the symbol of the old National Justice Party. The party fared poorly in the elections and only managed to retain one parliamentary seat, Permatang Pauh which is held by Dr Wan Azizah, despite winning 9% of the popular vote. The poor showing was later attributed to malapportionment and gerrymandering in the delineation of constituencies, with one estimate suggesting that on average, a vote for the BN government was worth 28 times the vote of a Keadilan supporter.

=== Anwar Ibrahim freed ===
On 2 September 2004, in a decision by the Federal Court, Anwar Ibrahim&#x27;s sodomy conviction was overturned and he was freed. This unexpected turn of events came timely for KEADILAN which was facing flagging morale due to its dismal performance in the elections.

In December 2005 PKR organised its second national congress. Among the motions passed was the New Economic Agenda that envisioned a non-racial economic policy to replace the race-based New Economic Policy. PKR managed a breakthrough into Sarawak politics in May 2006. In Sarawak state elections, Dominique Ng, a lawyer and activist, won in the Padungan constituency in Kuching, a majority Chinese locale. KEADILAN lost narrowly in Saribas, a Malay-Melanau constituency by just 94 votes. Sarawak is a traditional BN stronghold. PKR has also pursued an aggressive strategy of getting key personalities from within and outside politics. In July 2006, Khalid Ibrahim, former CEO of Permodalan Nasional Berhad and Guthrie, was appointed as Treasurer of the PKR.

=== 2008 general election ===
In the 2008 elections, PKR won 31 seats in Parliament, with the DAP and PAS making substantial gains as well with 28 seats and 23 seats respectively. In total, the taking of 82 seats by the opposition to BN&#x27;s 140 seats made it the best performance in Malaysian history by the opposition, and denied BN the two-thirds majority required to make constitutional changes in the Dewan Rakyat.

PKR also successfully contested the state legislative elections which saw the loose coalition of PKR, DAP and PAS forming coalition governments in the states of Kelantan, Kedah, Penang, Perak and Selangor. The offices of the Menteri Besar of Selangor and the Deputy Chief Minister of Penang were held by KEADILAN elected representatives, Khalid Ibrahim and Mohd Fairus Khairuddin, respectively.

=== Anwar&#x27;s return to politics ===
On 14 April 2008, Anwar celebrated his official return to the political stage, as his ban from public office expired a decade after he was sacked as deputy prime minister. One of the main reasons the opposition seized a third of parliamentary seats and five states in the worst ever showing for the BN coalition that has ruled for half a century, was due to him leading at the helm. A gathering of more than 10,000 supporters greeted Anwar in a rally welcoming back his return to politics. In the midst of the rally, police interrupted Anwar after he had addressed the rally for nearly half an hour and forced him to stop the gathering.

Malaysia&#x27;s government intensified its efforts on 6 March to portray opposition figure Anwar Ibrahim as political turncoats, days ahead of Malaysian general election, 2008 on 8 March that would determine whether he posed a legitimate threat to the ruling coalition. Campaigning wrapped up 7 March for general elections that would see gains for Malaysia&#x27;s opposition amid anger over race and religion among minority Chinese and Indians. Malaysians voted on 8 March 2008 in parliamentary elections. Election results showed that the ruling government suffered a setback when it failed to obtain two-thirds majority in parliament, and five out of 12 state legislatures were won by the opposition parties. Reasons for the setback of the ruling party, which had retained power since the nation declared independence in 1957, were the rising inflation, crime and ethnic tensions.

=== Permatang Pauh by-election ===
Malaysia&#x27;s government and ruling coalition declared defeat in a landslide victory in the by-election by Anwar Ibrahim. Muhammad Muhammad Taib, information chief of the United Malays National Organisation which leads the BN coalition stated: &quot;Yes of course we have lost . . . we were the underdogs going into this race&quot;. Malaysia&#x27;s Election Commission officials announced Anwar won by an astounding majority against Arif Shah Omar Shah of National Front coalition and over Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi&#x27;s UMNO. Reuters reported that according to news website Malaysiakini, Anwar Ibrahim had won with a majority of 16,210 votes. He had won 26,646 votes, while BN&#x27;s Arif Omar won 10,436 votes. Anwar&#x27;s People&#x27;s Justice Party&#x27;s spokeswoman Ginie Lim told BBC: &quot;We won already. We are far ahead&quot;.

On 28 August 2008, Anwar, dressed in a dark blue traditional Malay outfit and black &quot;songkok&quot; hat, took the oath at the main chamber of Parliament house in Kuala Lumpur, as MP for Permatang Pauh at 10.03 am before Speaker Tan Sri Pandikar Amin Mulia. He formally declared Anwar the leader of the 3-party opposition alliance. With his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail and his daughter Nurul Izzah Anwar, also a parliamentarian, Anwar announced: &quot;I&#x27;m glad to be back after a decade. The prime minister has lost the mandate of the country and the nation&quot;. Anwar needed at least 30 government lawmakers especially from Sabah and Sarawak MPs&#x27; votes to defect to form a government.

=== Suara Keadilan publication license suspended ===
In June 2010, Suara Keadilan&#x27;s publication was suspended for publishing a report which claimed a government agency is bankrupt. Suara Keadilan is run by opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim&#x27;s PKR party. The Home Ministry, which oversees Malaysia&#x27;s newspapers, said it was not satisfied with the paper&#x27;s explanation for the allegedly inaccurate report.

=== Kajang Move ===

In 2014, the Party&#x27;s Strategy Director then Vice-President-cum-Secretary-General, Rafizi Ramli initiated the failed Kajang Move in a bid to topple the 14th Menteri Besar of Selangor, Abdul Khalid Ibrahim, and install the party&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader Anwar Ibrahim as his replacement. The political manoeuvre resulted in a nine-month political crisis within the state of Selangor and the Pakatan Rakyat coalition, that also involved the palace of Selangor, a by-election costing RM1.6 million in taxpayers’ money, the party losing one seat in Selangor&#x27;s assembly and Malaysian Parliament. PKR also ended up not getting the Menteri Besar that it wanted. The crisis concluded with the appointment of PKR&#x27;s Deputy President, Azmin Ali, as the 15th Menteri Besar of Selangor. Most analysts say that the Kajang Move was a great failure.

===PD Move===
On 12 September 2018, the incumbent Danyal Balagopal Abdullah resigned as Member of Parliament for Port Dickson to allow Anwar Ibrahim, who had been granted a royal pardon by the country&#x27;s monarch the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to re-enter parliament after a 3-year absence. The resignation caused the Port Dickson by-election, 2018 and was dubbed the &#x27;PD Move&#x27;. Anwar won the seat with an increased majority against six other candidates.

===Collapse of the Pakatan Harapan government===
The 2020 Malaysian political crisis culminated in the collapse of the Pakatan Harapan government. The political crisis began when several political forces, including then PKR deputy president Azmin Ali, attempted to depose the current government led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad by forming a new government without going through a general election. This was achieved through backroom deals popularly known as the Sheraton Move, which saw the withdrawal of BERSATU from the coalition as well as the exit of Azmin Ali along with 10 other PKR MPs. This deprived the coalition of its majority and paved the way for Muhyiddin Yassin, the President of BERSATU, to form a backdoor government positioning himself as Prime Minister with the support of the newly formed Perikatan Nasional coalition.

During the political crisis, in a Facebook Live broadcast of a night prayer session at Anwar Ibrahim&#x27;s residence, Anwar said that he had been informed of a &quot;treachery&quot; being committed that involved &quot;former friends from BERSATU and a small group from PKR&quot;. Azmin Ali, in a later statement, claimed that his action was to protect then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who was forced to choose a date for the transition of power during Pakatan Harapan&#x27;s presidential meeting on 21 February, and that the statutory declaration presented to the Agong was to cement support for Mahathir, not to elect a new prime minister. He further said that the real traitor was the faction that tried to usurp Mahathir.

On 24 February 2020, PKR held a press conference where its general secretary, Saifuddin Nasution Ismail, announced that Azmin and vice-president Zuraida Kamaruddin had been sacked by the party. Saifuddin explained that they were expelled due to their actions on 23 February which went against the party&#x27;s official line regarding the position of Prime Minister. Azmin later announced that he would be forming an independent bloc in parliament along with Zuraida and nine other Azmin-aligned PKR MPs who left the party following his expulsion. A large number of PKR grassroots members aligned with Azmin&#x27;s camp left the party once the political crisis began, including thousands of members across the country along with three Kelantan division chiefs who announced their resignation on 26 February.

On 4 March 2020, the Penang Exco of Agriculture, Agro-based Industries, Rural Development and Health, Afif Bahardin, resigned from his position in Penang State Executive Council. Aligned with Azmin Ali&#x27;s camp, he claimed to have been pressured by party leadership to resign from his post. He was replaced by Norlela Ariffin, the MLA for Penanti, who was appointed as the new state councillor and sworn in on 12 March. On the same day, Chong Fat Full, the Azmin-aligned MLA of Pemanis in Johor, announced his resignation from the party to become a Perikatan-aligned independent. This handed the alliance a marginal 29-27 majority in the state assembly and allowed the takeover of a key Harapan state.

The collapse of Harapan governments at the state level continued on 12 May in Kedah when two Azmin-aligned MLAs, Robert Ling Kui Ee of Sidam and Azman Nasrudin of Lunas, left the party to become Perikatan-aligned independents. Along with four of six BERSATU MLAs defecting, their withdrawal to Perikatan gave the coalition a 23-13 majority and allowed Kedah state opposition leader, Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor, to announce the formation of a new government with PAS at the helm, taking over from the previous BERSATU Chief Minister, Mukhriz Mahathir, who was aligned to Pakatan Harapan. Another departure followed on 17 May as Srikandi Keadilan Chief, Nurainie Haziqah Shafii, left the party claiming to have &quot;lost confidence in the struggle and the direction of PKR&quot;.

The month of June witnessed more departures of PKR members and representatives, beginning with MP for Lubok Antu, Jugah Muyang, resigning from the party on 5 June. He was previously elected as an independent before joining PKR after they formed the federal government, but left the party for BERSATU after it became the new ruling party, joining it along with the independent MP of Bukit Gantang, Syed Abu Hussin Hafiz, who was previously elected under UMNO. The departure of Azmin allies continued when Daroyah Alwi, the Deputy Speaker &amp; Exco of the Selangor state assembly as well as the Women&#x27;s Deputy Chief, announced her resignation from the party to became a Perikatan-aligned independent on 13 June, followed by Afif Bahardin, the former Youth Deputy Chief, on 24 June, Meanwhile, Haniza Talha, the PKR Women&#x27;s Chief, was sacked by the party on 29 June and was forced to resign as a State Exco member on 11 July. Haniza described PKR&#x27;s decision to sack her from the party as an “act of revenge”. On the same day, she was replaced by Kuantan MP, Fuziah Salleh, as the party&#x27;s new Women&#x27;s Chief.

Salleh Said Keruak, a prominent politician from UMNO, cancelled his application to join PKR on 30 June citing the party&#x27;s internal turmoil. He said the decision was made in April, and with the cancellation, remained an independent since leaving UMNO in 2018 before rejoining the party in September 2020. Previously, Salleh had applied to join PKR in October of the previous year.

The departures continued throughout July when Terengganu Women&#x27;s Chief, Sharifah Norhayati Syed Omar Alyahya, left PKR along with 131 other members on 1 July, claiming injustice in the party&#x27;s top leadership. This was followed by Penang MLA of Sungai Acheh, Zulkifli Ibrahim, who was sacked from PKR before joining BERSATU on 4 July. On the same day, two municipal councillors, Jess Choy of Selayang and Shoba Selvarajoo of Shah Alam, resigned from the party. This was followed Jempol division chief, Karip Mohd Salleh, who left the party with 25 other members for Perikatan Nasional on 15 July. On 30 July, MLA of Inanam &amp; Sabah&#x27;s Assistant Minister of Finance, Kenny Chua Teck Ho, was sacked for backing UMNO&#x27;s Musa Aman as Chief Minister of Sabah.

BERSATU&#x27;s Kuala Krau Division Chief, Mohamad Rafidee Hashim, left the party and joined PKR on 9 August, stating his action was because &quot;the party was more consistent and principled in its efforts to fight for reform&quot;.

The defections continued when two MPs, Steven Choong of Tebrau and Larry Sng of Julau became independents on 27 and 28 February 2021. They would go on to form the Parti Bangsa Malaysia (PBM) and declare their support for the ruling Perikatan Nasional coalition.
The exodus of MPs ended on 13 March 2021 when PKR vice-president Xavier Jayakumar of Kuala Langat announced his resignation as both vice-president and party member, citing his &#x27;frustrations&#x27; by the events of the past year and subsequently becoming a Perikatan-aligned independent MP.

== Ideology ==
A supporter of liberal democracy, PKR&#x27;s constitution has as one of their core principles, the establishment of &quot;a society that is just and a nation that is democratic, progressive and united&quot;. In practice, the party has primarily focused on promoting social justice, economic justice, eliminating political corruption and human rights issues within a non-ethnic framework.

<doc id="412213" wikidata="Q1774076" url="?curid=412213" title="Zhoushan Island">
<text>Zhoushan Island is the principal and namesake island in the Zhoushan Islands, formerly romanized as the ChusanIslands, an archipelago administered by Zhoushan Prefecture in Zhejiang Province in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is the province&#x27;s largest island and 3rd-largest in mainland China after Hainan and Chongming. The island is the district seat of both Dinghai and Putuo. The island was the site of the first and second capture of Chusan during the First Opium War.

When referred to as a port, the Port of Zhoushan (舟山市) refers to the prefecture-level &quot;city&quot; consisting of Zhoushan island as well as the other nearby outlying islands, in Zhejiang. The former name of Zhoushan was Dinghai (Chinese: 定海). The Port of Zhoushan is a popular port for bulk carriers.

==Name==
The name &quot;Zhoushan&quot; means &quot;Boat&quot; and refers to the shape of the island on a map.

The island has a varied range of landscape, with hill and dale, as well as watered with numerous small streams, of which the most considerable is the Dongjiang (East River), passing into the harbour of Dinghai. There are several hundred ports around the islands, separated into three areas: Dinghai Port Zone, Shen-jia-men Port Zone (沈家门港区), and Laotangshan Port Zone (老塘山港区). The tourism regions include the regions of Shen-jia-men and Dinghai.

== History and attractions ==
The island was the site of the first and second capture of Chusan during the First Opium War. A number of historical sites and monuments on the island are popular tourist attractions.

* The Well of Imperial Yuan Consort of the Prince of Lu (鲁王元妃宫井), where a Southern Ming queen leapt to her death as the fall of the Ming was imminent.

Other sites include:
* Zuyin Temple (祖印寺), a Chan Buddhist place of worship and meditation with a lineage dating back to 940, when a monastery on the nearby island of Qúshan (衢山) named the Haven of Penglai (蓬莱院) was founded. The monks moved to the current location in the 1230s.
* Sanmao Memorial Museum (三毛祖居纪念馆), dedicated to a popular Taiwanese author of Mainlander origin.

<doc id="412214" wikidata="Q242185" url="?curid=412214" title="Bill Russell">
<text>William Felton Russell (February 12, 1934 – July 31, 2022) was an American professional basketball player who played center for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1956 to 1969. He was the centerpiece of the Celtics dynasty that won 11 NBA championships during his 13-year career. Russell is widely considered to be one of the greatest basketball players of all time.

At the University of San Francisco, Russell led the San Francisco Dons to consecutive NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956. He was named NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player, and captained the gold medal-winning U.S. national basketball team at the 1956 Summer Olympics. These victories along with his NBA championships made Russell one of only eight players in the history of basketball to achieve the Triple Crown.

After being chosen by the St. Louis Hawks with the second overall pick in the 1956 NBA draft, Russell was traded to the Boston Celtics for Celtics center Ed Macauley and small forward Cliff Hagan. With Russell as their starting center and defensive anchor, the Celtics went on to win their first NBA championship in 1957 and won an NBA record eight consecutive championships from 1959 to 1966. A five-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) and a 12-time NBA All-Star, Russell&#x27;s rebounding, defense, and leadership made him one of the dominant players of his era. Standing at tall, with a arm span, his shot-blocking and man-to-man defense were major reasons for the Celtics&#x27; dominance during his career. Russell also led the NBA in rebounds four times, had a dozen consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds, and remains second all-time in both total rebounds and rebounds per game. Russell played in the wake of black pioneers Earl Lloyd, Chuck Cooper, and Sweetwater Clifton, and he was the first black player to achieve superstar status in the NBA. During the final three seasons of his career (1966–1969), he served as player-coach of the Celtics, becoming the first black NBA coach to win a championship. Russell ended his playing career and left his position as Celtics coach after helping the Celtics win the 1969 NBA championship.

Russell served as head coach and general manager of the Seattle SuperSonics from 1973 to 1977. He also coached the Sacramento Kings from 1987 to 1988. Russell also worked as a color commentator and authored several books.

Russell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975, was one of the founding inductees into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006 and was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007. He was selected into the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971 and the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1980, was named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 (being one of only four players to receive all three honors), and was selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. In 2009, the NBA renamed the NBA Finals MVP Award in his honor. In 2011, Barack Obama awarded Russell the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his accomplishments on the court and in the civil rights movement. In 2021, Russell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame a second time in recognition of his coaching career. Shortly after his death in 2022, the NBA retired Russell&#x27;s #6 jersey league-wide, making him the only player in NBA history to receive that honor, as well as the third person in North American major professional sports to have their jersey number retired league-wide, behind Jackie Robinson and Wayne Gretzky.

==Early life==
===Family===
William Felton Russell was born on February 12, 1934, to Charles Russell and Katie Russell in West Monroe, Louisiana. Like many Southern towns and cities of that time, Monroe was segregated and the Russells often struggled with racism in their daily lives. Russell&#x27;s father was once refused service at a gas station until the staff had taken care of all the white customers first. When he attempted to leave and find a different station, the attendant stuck a shotgun in his face and threatened to kill him if he did not stay and wait his turn. In another incident, Russell&#x27;s mother was walking outside in a fancy dress when a white policeman accosted her. He told her to go home and remove the dress, which he described as &quot;white woman&#x27;s clothing&quot;.

During World War II, the Second Great Migration began, with large numbers of Black people leaving the South to find jobs in the rest of the U.S. When Russell was eight years old, his father moved the family to Oakland, California. While there, they fell into poverty and Russell spent his childhood living in a series of public housing projects.

His father was said to be a &quot;stern, hard man&quot; who initially worked in a paper factory as a janitor, which was what sports journalist John Taylor called a typical &quot;Negro Job&quot;—low-paid and not intellectually challenging. When World War II broke out, the elder Russell became a truck driver. Russell was closer to his mother Katie than to his father, and he received a major emotional blow when she suddenly died when he was 12 years old. His father gave up his trucking job and became a steelworker in order to be closer to his children. Russell stated that his father became his childhood hero, later followed up by Minneapolis Lakers superstar George Mikan, whom he met when he was in high school. Of Russell the college basketball player, Mikan said: &quot;Let&#x27;s face it, he&#x27;s the best ever. He&#x27;s so good, he scares you.&quot;

Russell&#x27;s older brother was playwright Charlie L. Russell.

===Initial exposure to basketball===
During his early years Russell struggled to develop his skills as a basketball player. Although he was a good runner and jumper and had large hands, he did not understand the game and was cut from the team at Herbert Hoover Junior High School. As a freshman at McClymonds High School in Oakland, Russell was almost cut again; as he saw Russell&#x27;s raw athletic potential, coach George Powles encouraged him to work on his fundamentals. After Russell was cut from the junior varsity basketball team as a junior in high school, Powles gave him a spot on the varsity team and bought him a yearlong community center membership. Since Russell&#x27;s previous experiences with white authority figures were often negative, warm words from Powles reassured him. Frank Robinson, a future member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, was one of Russell&#x27;s high school basketball teammates.

Russell soon became noted for his unusual style of defense. He later recalled: &quot;To play good defense ... it was told back then that you had to stay flatfooted at all times to react quickly. When I started to jump to make defensive plays and to block shots, I was initially corrected, but I stuck with it, and it paid off.&quot; In an autobiographical account, Russell said that while on a California High School All-Stars tour, he became obsessed with studying and memorizing other players&#x27; moves, e.g., footwork such as which foot they moved first on which play, as preparation for defending against them, which included practicing in front of a mirror at night. Russell described himself as an avid reader of Dell Magazines&#x27; 1950s sports publications, which he used to scout opponents&#x27; moves for the purpose of defending against them.

Russell was ignored by college recruiters and did not receive an offer until recruiter Hal DeJulio from the University of San Francisco (USF) watched him play in a high school game. DeJulio was unimpressed by Russell&#x27;s meager scoring and &quot;atrocious fundamentals&quot;, but he sensed that the young Russell had an extraordinary instinct for the game, especially in the clutch. Russell eagerly accepted the offer. Sports journalist John Taylor described the scholarship offer as a watershed event in Russell&#x27;s life because Russell realized that basketball was his chance to escape poverty and racism, and he swore to make the best of it. Russell graduated from McClymonds in 1952.

==College career==
===University of San Francisco===
====Basketball====
Russell started college at USF in 1952. He averaged 20 points per game on the Dons&#x27; freshman basketball team, and made his varsity debut on December 1, 1953. He became the starting center for coach Phil Woolpert, who emphasized defense and deliberate half-court play, which favored Russell&#x27;s exceptional defensive skills. Woolpert&#x27;s choice of how to deploy his players was unaffected by their skin color. In 1954, he became the first coach of a major college basketball program to start three African-American players: K. C. Jones, Hal Perry, and Russell. In his USF years, Russell took advantage of his relative lack of bulk to guard other players than the opposing center: using his quickness and speed, he would double-up on forwards and aggressively challenge their shots. Russell played on USF&#x27;s varsity team from 1953 to 1956.

Combining the stature and shot-blocking skills of a center with the foot speed of a forward, Russell became the centerpiece of a USF team that soon became a force in college basketball. After USF kept Holy Cross Crusaders star Tom Heinsohn scoreless in an entire half, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote: &quot;If [Russell] ever learns to hit the basket, they&#x27;re going to have to rewrite the rules.&quot; The NCAA in fact did; the lane was widened for his junior year. After he graduated, the NCAA rules committee instituted a second new rule to counter the play of big men like Russell; basket interference was now prohibited. Russell became one of several big men who have brought about NCAA rule changes. The NCAA had previously prohibited goaltending in response to George Mikan (1945) and later banned the dunk shot due to Lew Alcindor (1967), although the latter rule was later repealed.
The games were often difficult for the USF squad, as Russell and his black teammates became targets of racist jeers, particularly on the road. In one incident, hotels in Oklahoma City refused to admit Russell and his black teammates while they were in town for the 1954 All-College Tournament. In protest, the whole team decided to fend for themselves in a closed college dorm, which was later called an important bonding experience for the group. Decades later, Russell explained that his experiences hardened him against abuse of all kinds, saying: &quot;I never permitted myself to be a victim.&quot;

Racism shaped his lifelong paradigm as a team player, about which Russell said: &quot;At that time it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen ... My junior year in college, I had what I thought was the one of the best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the MVP at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me know that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man.&quot; He is said to have made a conscious decision to put the team first and foremost, and not worry about individual achievements.

On the court, Russell&#x27;s experiences were far more pleasant. He led USF to NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956, including a string of 55 consecutive victories, and a 26-point, 27-rebound, 20-block performance in one game. He became known for his strong defense and shot-blocking skills, once denying 13 shots in a game. UCLA Bruins coach John Wooden called Russell &quot;the greatest defensive man I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. While at USF, he and Jones helped pioneer a play that later became known as the alley-oop. During his college career, Russell was the NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player in 1955, averaging 20.7 points per game and 20.3 rebounds per game.

====Track and field====
Besides basketball, Russell represented USF in track and field events. He was a standout in the high jump and according to &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; was ranked the seventh-best high-jumper in the world in 1956, his graduation year, despite not competing in Olympic high-jump competition. That year, Russell won high jump titles at the Central California Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) meet, the Pacific AAU meet, and the West Coast Relays (WCR). One of his highest jumps occurred at the WCR, where he achieved a mark of ; at the meet, Russell tied Charlie Dumas, who would later in the year win gold in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia for the United States and become the first person to high-jump . this was all before the Fosbury Flop was introduced, with which all high jump world records after 1978 have been set. Russell later stateside that &quot;In &#x27;56, I could have made the Olympics in high jump but turned it down to play basketball instead, we could only play one sport then&quot;. He also competed in the race, which he could complete in 49.6 seconds.

==1956 Summer Olympics==
Before his NBA rookie year, Russell was the captain of the 1956 U.S. men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team that competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics, which was held in November and December in Melbourne, Australia. Avery Brundage, head of the International Olympic Committee, argued that Russell had already signed a professional contract and was no longer an amateur (as nominally required at the time), but Russell prevailed. He had the option to skip the tournament and play a full season for the Celtics, but he was determined to play in the Olympics. He later commented that he would have participated in the high jump if he had been snubbed by the basketball team.

Under head coach Gerald Tucker, Russell helped the U.S. national basketball team win the gold medal in Melbourne, defeating the Soviet Union national basketball team 89–55 in the final game with an 8–0 undefeated run. The U.S. dominated the tournament, winning by an average of 53.5 points per game. Russell led the team in scoring, averaging 14.1 points per game for the competition. His former USF and future Celtics teammate K. C. Jones joined him on the Olympic squad and contributed 10.9 points per game, including a Russell–Jones combined 29 points in the finals.

==Professional career==
The Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to join their exhibition basketball squad, but Russell, who was sensitive to racial prejudice, was enraged by the fact that Globetrotters owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the matter with USF Coach Woolpert, and not Russell. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes, but he was livid after this snub and declined the offer. He reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart to speak with him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein. Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.

In the draft, Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach set his sights on Russell, thinking his defensive toughness and rebounding prowess were the missing pieces the Celtics needed. Auerbach&#x27;s thoughts were unorthodox, as in that period centers and forwards were defined by their offensive output, and their ability to play defense was secondary. Boston&#x27;s chances of getting Russell seemed slim because they had finished second in the previous season and the worst teams had the highest draft picks, and the Celtics had slipped too low in the draft order to pick Russell. In addition, Auerbach had already used his NBA territorial pick to acquire talented forward Tom Heinsohn. Auerbach knew that the Rochester Royals, who owned the first draft pick, already had a strong rebounder in Maurice Stokes, were looking for an outside shooting guard, and were unwilling to pay Russell the $25,000 signing bonus he requested. Celtics owner Walter A. Brown contacted Rochester owner Les Harrison and received an assurance that the Royals could not afford Russell, and they would draft Sihugo Green. Auerbach later said that Brown offered Harrison guaranteed performances of the Ice Capades if they did not draft Russell; it is difficult to verify or disprove this, but it is clear that the Royals underrated Russell.

The St. Louis Hawks, who owned the second pick, drafted Russell but were vying for Celtics center Ed Macauley, a six-time NBA All-Star who had roots in St. Louis. Auerbach agreed to trade Macauley, who had previously asked to be traded to St. Louis in order to be with his sick son, if the Hawks gave up Russell. The owner of the Hawks called Auerbach later and demanded more in the trade. In addition to Macauley, who was the Celtics&#x27; premier player at the time, he wanted Cliff Hagan, who had been serving in the military for three years and had not yet played for the Celtics. After much debate, Auerbach agreed to give up Hagan and the Hawks made the trade. During that same draft, Boston also drafted guard K. C. Jones, Russell&#x27;s former USF teammate; in total, the team drafted three future Basketball Hall of Famers in 1956: Russell, Jones, and Heinsohn. The Russell draft-day trade was later called one of the most important trades in the history of North American sports.

===Boston Celtics (1956–1969)===
====1956–1958: Rookie champion and early years====

Due to his Olympic commitment, Russell could not join the Celtics for the 1956–57 NBA season until December. The 1956–57 Boston Celtics season saw the debut of a starting lineup made up of five future Hall-of-Famers: center Russell, forwards Heinsohn and Frank Ramsey, and guards Bill Sharman and Bob Cousy. Russell&#x27;s first Celtics game came on December 22, 1956, against the St. Louis Hawks. Auerbach assigned him to shut down the Hawks&#x27; main scorer, Bob Pettit, and Russell impressed the Boston crowd with his man-to-man defense and shot-blocking. In previous years, the Celtics had been a high-scoring team but lacked the defensive presence needed to close out tight games. With the added defensive presence of Russell, the Celtics had laid the foundation for a dynasty, as the team utilized a strong defensive approach to the game, forcing opposing teams to commit many turnovers, which led to many easy points on fast breaks.

Russell was an elite help defender who allowed the Celtics to play the &quot;Hey, Bill&quot; defense: whenever a Celtic requested additional defensive help, he would shout &quot;Hey, Bill!&quot; Russell was so quick that he could run over for a quick double team and make it back in time if the opponents tried to find the open man. He also became famous for his shot-blocking skills and pundits called his blocks &quot;Wilsonburgers&quot;, referring to the Wilson NBA basketballs he &quot;shoved back into the faces of opposing shooters&quot;. This skill allowed the other Celtics to play their men aggressively; if they were beaten, they knew that Russell was guarding the basket.

Russell&#x27;s defense was called into question by Eddie Gottlieb, coach of the Philadelphia Warriors, after the Warriors–Celtics game on January 1, 1957, in which he recorded 17 points and 25 rebounds, plus an assist. Gottlieb protested the next day, saying that Russell played a one-man zone and goaltended numerous times, to only be called once. Auerbach replied that Gottlieb&#x27;s statements were &quot;absolutely ridiculous&quot; and said any controversy was &quot;a question of sour grapes&quot;.

Constantly provoked by New York Knicks center Ray Felix during a game, he complained to coach Auerbach, who told him to take matters into his own hands. After the next provocation, Russell pounded Felix to the point of unconsciousness, paid a modest $25 fine, and rarely was the target of cheap fouls thereafter.

At that time, Russell received much negative publicity as a player. He was notorious for his public surliness. Because Russell ignored virtually any well-wisher who approached him home or away, as well as the vast majority of media, his autograph was among the most difficult to secure of any professional athlete of his time. Russell had a cordial relationship with many of his teammates, with the notable exception of Heinsohn, his old rival and fellow rookie. Russell ignored Heinsohn&#x27;s request for an autograph on behalf of his cousin and openly said to Heinsohn that he deserved half of his $300 Rookie of the Year check. The relationship between the two was tenuous at best. Despite their different ethnic backgrounds and lack of common off-court interests, his relationship with Cousy was amicable.

Russell played 48 games, averaging 14.7 points per game and a league-high 19.6 rebounds per game. The Celtics finished the 1956–57 regular season with a 44–28 record, the team&#x27;s second-best record since beginning play in the 1946–47 BAA season, which guaranteed Russell his first NBA playoffs appearance, where the Celtics met with the Syracuse Nationals, a team led by Dolph Schayes, through the Eastern Division finals. In his first playoff game, Russell finished with 16 points and 31 rebounds, along with 7 reported blocks, which were not yet an officially registered statistic. After the Celtics&#x27; 108–89 victory, Schayes, who made Johnny Kerr come off the bench because he struggled against Russell in the regular season, quipped: &quot;How much does that guy make a year? It would be to our advantage if we paid him off for five years to get away from us in the rest of this series.&quot; The next day, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; read: &quot;Russell&#x27;s Reflexes Befuddles Visitors.&quot;

The Celtics swept the Nationals in three games to earn the franchise&#x27;s first NBA Finals appearance in the 1957 NBA Finals, where they met the St. Louis Hawks, led by Pettit and former Celtic Ed Macauley. As the teams split the first six games, the tension was so high that in Game 3 Celtics coach Auerbach punched his colleague Ben Kerner and received a $300 fine. In the highly-competitive Game 7, Russell tried his best to slow down Pettit, as Heinsohn scored 37 points and kept the Celtics alive; Russell contributed by completing the famous &quot;Coleman Play&quot;, as he ran down Hawks forward Jack Coleman, who had received an outlet pass at midcourt, and blocked his shot despite the fact that Russell had been standing at his own baseline when the ball was thrown to Coleman. The block preserved Boston&#x27;s slim 103–102 lead with 40-odd seconds left to play in regulation, saving the game for the Celtics. In the second overtime, both teams were in serious foul trouble: Heinsohn had fouled out, and the Hawks were so depleted that they had only seven players left. With the Celtics leading 125–123 with one second left, the Hawks had the ball at their own baseline. Reserve forward Alex Hannum threw a long alley-oop pass to Pettit and Pettit&#x27;s tip-in rolled indecisively on the rim for several seconds before rolling out again. The Celtics won, earning their first NBA championship.

At the start of the 1957–58 NBA season, the Celtics won fourteen straight games and continued to succeed. Russell averaged 16.6 points per game and a league-record average of 22.7 rebounds per game. The NBA reasoned that other centers were better all-round players than Russell but no player was more valuable to his team. He was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player but only named to the All-NBA Second Team, something that would occur repeatedly throughout his career, as players voted for the MVP award, something that would last until the 1979–80 NBA season, while the media has always voted for the All-NBA teams.

The Celtics won 49 games and made the first berth in the 1958 NBA playoffs, where they met in the 1958 NBA Finals with their familiar rivals, the St. Louis Hawks. The teams split the first two games, but Russell went down with a foot injury in Game 3 and only returned for Game 6. The Celtics won Game 4 in an upset, but the Hawks prevailed in Games 5 and 6, with Pettit scoring 50 points in the deciding Game 6. Many observers thought that Boston could have won had Russell not been injured, but Auerbach commented: &quot;You can always look for excuses ... We just got beat.&quot;

====1958–1966: Eight straight NBA championships====
In the 1958–59 NBA season, Russell averaged 16.7 points per game and 23.0 rebounds per game. The Celtics broke a league record by winning 52 games and Russell&#x27;s strong performance once again helped lead the Celtics through the 1959 NBA playoffs, as they returned to the NBA Finals. In the 1959 NBA Finals, the Celtics recaptured the NBA title, sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers 4–0. Lakers head coach John Kundla praised Russell, stating: &quot;We don&#x27;t fear the Celtics without Bill Russell. Take him out and we can beat them ... He&#x27;s the guy who whipped us psychologically.&quot;

In the 1959–60 NBA season, the NBA witnessed the debut of Philadelphia Warriors center Wilt Chamberlain, who averaged a record 37.6 points per game in his rookie year. On November 7, 1959, Russell&#x27;s Celtics hosted Chamberlain&#x27;s Warriors and pundits called the matchup between the best offensive and defensive centers &quot;The Big Collision&quot; and &quot;Battle of the Titans&quot;. Both men awed onlookers with &quot;nakedly awesome athleticism&quot;, and while Chamberlain outscored Russell 30 to 22, the Celtics won 115–106, and the match was called a &quot;new beginning of basketball&quot;. The matchup between Russell and Chamberlain became one of basketball&#x27;s greatest rivalries.

On February 5, 1960, Russell had 23 points, 51 rebounds, and 5 assists in a 124–100 win over the Syracuse Nationals. It was the record for most rebounds in a single game until November 24, 1960, when Chamberlain grabbed 55 rebounds against Russell, who led the Celtics to a 132–129 win over the Philadelphia Warriors with 18 points, 19 rebounds, and 5 assists. Boston won a then-record 59 regular-season games, including a then-record tying 17-game win streak. In the 1960 NBA playoffs, Russell&#x27;s Celtics met Chamberlain&#x27;s Warriors in the Eastern Division finals. Chamberlain outscored Russell by 81 points in the series, but the Celtics walked off with a 4–2 series win. In the 1960 NBA Finals, the Celtics outlasted the Hawks 4–3 in the series and won their third championship in four years. Russell scored 21 points and grabbed an NBA Finals-record 40 rebounds, plus an assist, in a Game 2 loss, and he added 22 points and 35 rebounds, along with 4 assists, in the deciding Game 7, a 122–103 victory for Boston.
In the 1960–61 NBA season, Russell averaged 16.9 points and 23.9 rebounds per game, leading his team to a regular season mark of 57–22. In the 1961 NBA playoffs, the Celtics defeated the Syracuse Nationals 4–1 in the Eastern Division finals. The Celtics made good use of the fact that the Los Angeles Lakers had exhausted the St. Louis Hawks in a long seven-game Western Conference finals, and Boston won the 1961 NBA Finals in five games.

In the 1961–62 NBA season, Russell scored a career-high 18.9 points per game, accompanied by 23.6 rebounds per game. While his rival had a record-breaking season of 50.4 points per game, including Chamberlain&#x27;s 100-point game, the Celtics became the first team to win 60 games in a season and Russell was voted as the league&#x27;s MVP. Both Cousy and Russell called it the greatest Celtics team of all time. In the Eastern Division championships of the 1962 NBA playoffs, the Celtics met the Philadelphia Warriors led by Chamberlain, who averaged 50 points per game that season, and Russell did his best to slow him down. In the pivotal Game 7, Russell managed to hold Chamberlain to 22 points, 28 points below his season average, while scoring 19 points. The game was tied with two seconds left when Sam Jones sank a clutch shot that won the Celtics the series.
In the 1962 NBA Finals, the Celtics met the Los Angeles Lakers of forward Elgin Baylor and guard Jerry West. The teams split the first six games. In Game 6, Russell recorded his first career triple-double with 19 points, 24 rebounds, and 10 assists as the Celtics won 119–105. At that time, he became the fourth player in Celtics history to have a triple-double, joining Macauley, Cousy, and K. C. Jones. Game 7 was tied one second before the end of regular time, when Lakers guard Rod Hundley faked a shot and passed out to Frank Selvy, who missed an open eight-foot last-second shot that would have won Los Angeles the title. As the game was tied, Russell had the daunting task of defending against Baylor with little frontline help: Loscutoff, Heinsohn, and Satch Sanders, the three best Celtics forwards, had fouled out. In overtime, Frank Ramsey, the fourth forward, fouled out trying to guard Baylor, so Russell was robbed of his usual four-men wing rotation; he and little-used fifth forward Gene Guarilia successfully pressured Baylor into missed shots. Russell finished with a clutch performance, scoring 30 points, along with 4 assists, and tying his own NBA Finals record with 40 rebounds in a 110–107 overtime win.

The Celtics lost Cousy to retirement after the 1962–63 NBA season, and they drafted John Havlicek and were powered by Russell, who averaged 16.8 points and 23.6 rebounds per game, won his fourth regular-season MVP award, and earned the NBA All-Star Game MVP honors at the 1963 NBA All-Star Game following his 19-point, 24-rebound performance for the Eastern Conference&#x27;s All-Star team. Before the January 31, 1963, 18-point, 22-rebound performance in a 128–125 win against the Cincinnati Royals at Cole Field House in College Park, Maryland, the Celtics were to tour the White House and Russell had a &quot;Do not disturb&quot; sign on his phone. Auerbach had informed his players to not endorse candidates or causes, as it would alienate fans; Cousy campaigned for Ted Kennedy in 1962. President John F. Kennedy posed for a picture with Auerbach and the nine Celtics but not Russell, who overslept because he thought it was just a tour of the White House and did not know President Kennedy would be meeting them. On February 10, 1963, Russell recorded his first regular season triple-double after putting up 17 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 129–123 win over the New York Knicks. The Celtics reached the 1963 NBA Finals, where they again defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, this time in six games. In Game 3, Russell had 21 points, 38 rebounds, and 6 assists.

In the 1963–64 NBA season, the Celtics posted a league-best 58–22 record in the regular season. Russell scored 15.0 points per game and grabbed a career-high 24.7 rebounds per game, leading the NBA in rebounds for the first time since Chamberlain entered the league. Boston defeated the Cincinnati Royals 4–1 to earn another NBA Finals appearance and then won against Chamberlain&#x27;s newly relocated San Francisco Warriors 4–1. It was their sixth consecutive and seventh title in Russell&#x27;s eight years with the team, a streak unreached in any U.S. professional sports league. Russell later called it the best team of his era and the best defense of all time.

In the 1964–65 NBA season, the Celtics won a league-record 62 games and Russell averaged 14.1 points and 24.1 rebounds per game, winning his second consecutive rebounding title and his fifth MVP award. On March 11, 1965, in a 112–100 win over the Detroit Pistons, Russell grabbed 49 rebounds, which tied for the third-most in a single game in NBA history, along with 27 points and 6 assists.

In the 1965 NBA playoffs, the Celtics played the Eastern Division finals against the Philadelphia 76ers, a team that had traded for Chamberlain. Russell held Chamberlain to a pair of field goals in the first three quarters of Game 3. In Game 5, Russell contributed with 12 points, 28 rebounds, and 7 assists, plus 10 blocks and 6 steals; blocks and steals became officially recorded statistics in the 1973–74 NBA season. Schayes, who had become the 76ers coach, said: &quot;The Celtics can thank the Good Lord for Bill Russell.&quot; That playoff series ended in a dramatic Game 7, when the Sixers were trailing 110–109 five seconds before the end, but Russell turned over the ball. When the Sixers&#x27; Hall-of-Fame guard Hal Greer inbounded, Havlicek stole the ball, causing Celtics commentator Johnny Most to scream: &quot;Havlicek stole the ball! It&#x27;s all over! Johnny Havlicek stole the ball!&quot; After the Division finals, the Celtics had an easier time in the NBA Finals, winning 4–1 against the Los Angeles Lakers.

In the 1965–66 NBA season, Russell contributed 12.9 points and 22.8 rebounds per game. This was the first time in seven years that he failed to average at least 23 rebounds a game. The Celtics won the 1966 NBA Finals and their eighth consecutive title. Russell&#x27;s team again beat Chamberlain&#x27;s Philadelphia 76ers 4–1 in the Eastern Division finals, proceeding to win the NBA Finals in a tight showdown against the Los Angeles Lakers, with Russell scoring 25 points and grabbing 32 rebounds, plus giving out an assist, in a 95–93 win in Game 7.

====1966–1969: Player-coach champion and final seasons====

Celtics coach Red Auerbach retired before the 1966–67 NBA season. To coach the Celtics, he had initially wanted his old player Frank Ramsey, who was too occupied running his three lucrative nursing homes. His second choice was Cousy, who declined the invitation, stating that he did not want to coach his former teammates. Third choice Tom Heinsohn also said no because he did not think he could handle the often surly Russell, whom he proposed as a player-coach. On April 16, 1966, Russell agreed to become head coach of the Celtics, and a public announcement was made two days later. Russell became the first black head coach in NBA history, and he commented to journalists: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t offered the job because I am a Negro, I was offered it because Red figured I could do it.&quot;

When he became player-coach, Russell bluntly said to his teammates that &quot;he intended to cut all personal ties to other players&quot; and seamlessly made the transition from their peer to their superior. At the time his additional role of coach was announced, Russell publicly stated he believed Red Auerbach&#x27;s impact as a coach confined every or almost every relationship with each Celtic player to a strictly professional one. Russell regarded Auerbach as &quot;the greatest of all coaches&quot;.

Boston&#x27;s championship streak ended at eight in his first full season as head coach when Chamberlain&#x27;s Philadelphia 76ers won a record-breaking 68 regular-season games and were the favorites heading into the 1967 NBA playoffs, where they beat the Celtics 4–1 in the Eastern Division finals. During the series, Russell said: &quot;Right now, he (Wilt) is playing like me [to win].&quot; The Sixers outpaced the Celtics when they shredded the famed Boston defense by scoring 140 points in the clinching Game 5 win. Russell acknowledged the first real loss of his career, as he had been injured when the Celtics lost the 1958 NBA Finals, by visiting Chamberlain in the locker room, shaking his hand, and saying: &quot;Great.&quot; The game still ended on a high note for Russell. After the loss, he led his grandfather through the Celtics locker rooms and the two saw the white Celtic Havlicek taking a shower next to his black teammate Sam Jones and discussing the game. Suddenly, his grandfather broke down crying. Asked by Russell what was wrong, his grandfather replied how proud he was of him, being coach of an organization in which blacks and whites coexisted in harmony.

In the 1967–68 NBA season, the 34-year-old Russell averaged 12.5 points per game and 18.6 rebounds per game, the latter of which was good enough for the third-highest average in the league. In the Eastern Division finals of the 1968 NBA playoffs, the Philadelphia 76ers had the better record than Boston and were the favorites. National tragedy struck on April 4, day of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. With eight of the ten starting players on Sixers and Celtics being black, both teams were in deep shock and there were calls to cancel the series. In a game called as &quot;unreal&quot; and &quot;devoid of emotion&quot;, the Sixers lost 127–118 on April 5. In Game 2, Philadelphia evened the series with a 115–106 win and then went on to win Games 3 and 4. As Chamberlain was often defended by Celtics backup center Wayne Embry, the press speculated that Russell was worn down. Prior to Game 5, no NBA team had ever come back from a 3–1 deficit. The Celtics rallied back, winning Game 5 122–104 and Game 6 114–106, powered by a spirited Havlicek and helped by a terrible Sixers shooting slump.

In Game 7, 15,202 Philadelphia fans witnessed a home-team 100–96 defeat, making it the first time in NBA history a team lost a series after leading 3–1. Russell limited Chamberlain to only two shot attempts in the second half. Despite this, the Celtics were leading only 97–95 with 34 seconds left when Russell closed out the game with several consecutive clutch plays. He made a free throw, blocked a shot by Sixers player Chet Walker, grabbed a rebound off a miss by Greer, and passed the ball to teammate Sam Jones, who scored to clinch the win. Boston then beat the Los Angeles Lakers 4–2 in the 1968 NBA Finals, giving Russell his tenth title in twelve years. For his efforts, Russell was named &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s Sportsman of the Year. After losing for the fifth straight time against Russell and the Celtics, Hall-of-Fame Lakers guard Jerry West stated: &quot;If I had a choice of any basketball player in the league, my No. 1 choice has to be Bill Russell. Bill Russell never ceases to amaze me.&quot;

Duiring the 1968–69 NBA season, Russell was shocked by the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, disillusioned by the Vietnam War, and weary from his increasingly stale marriage to his wife Rose; the couple later divorced. He was convinced that the U.S. was a corrupt nation and that he was wasting his time playing something as superficial as basketball. He was 15 pounds overweight, skipped mandatory NBA coach meetings, and was generally lacking energy; after a New York Knicks game, he complained of intense pain and was diagnosed with acute exhaustion. Russell pulled himself together and put up 9.9 points and 19.3 rebounds per game; the aging Celtics stumbled through the regular season. Their 48–34 record was the team&#x27;s worst since the 1955–56 NBA season and they entered the 1969 NBA playoffs as the fourth-seeded team in the East.

Russell and the Celtics achieved upsets over the 76ers and the Knicks to earn a meeting with the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1969 NBA Finals. The Lakers featured new recruit Chamberlain next to perennial stars Baylor and West, and were the favorites. In the first two games, Russell ordered his players not to double-team West, who used the freedom to score 53 and 41 points in the Game 1 and 2 Laker wins. Russell then reversed himself and ordered his team to double-team West and Boston won Game 3. In Game 4, the Celtics were trailing by one point with seven seconds left and the Lakers had the ball until Baylor stepped out of bounds. In the last play, Sam Jones used a triple screen by Bailey Howell, Larry Siegfried, and Havlicek to hit a buzzer beater that equalized the series. The teams split the next two games and it all came down to Game 7 in Los Angeles, where Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke angered and motivated the Celtics by putting &quot;proceedings of Lakers victory ceremony&quot; on the game leaflets. Russell used a copy as extra motivation and told his team to play a running game because in that case it was not the better but the more determined team that was going to win.

The Celtics were ahead by nine points with five minutes remaining; in addition, West was limping after a Game 5 thigh injury and Chamberlain had left the game with an injured leg. West then hit one basket after the other and cut the lead to one, and Chamberlain asked to return to the game. Lakers coach Bill van Breda Kolff kept him on the bench until the end of the game, saying later that he wanted to stay with the lineup responsible for the comeback. The Celtics held on for a 108–106 victory and Russell claimed his eleventh championship in thirteen years. At age 35, Russell contributed with 6 points, 21 rebounds, and 6 assists in his last NBA game. After the game, Russell went over to the distraught West, who had scored 42 points and was named the only NBA Finals MVP in history from the losing team, clasped his hand and tried to soothe him.

Days later, 30,000 Celtics fans cheered their returning heroes. Russell, who once said he owed the public nothing, was not there; he ended his career and cut all ties to the Celtics. It was so surprising that Auerbach was blindsided and made the mistake of drafting guard Jo Jo White instead of a center. Although White became a standout Celtics player, Boston lacked an All-Star center, went 34–48 in the 1969–70 NBA season, and failed to make it to the 1970 NBA playoffs, marking the first time since 1950 that they did not make the playoffs. In Boston, both fans and journalists felt betrayed because Russell left the Celtics without a coach and a center, and he sold his retirement story for $10,000 to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Russell was accused of selling out the future of the franchise for a month of his salary. Russell notified Auerbach that he was resigning to join a career in television and movies &quot;in order to find new sources of income for the future&quot;.

===Earnings===
During his playing career, Russell was one of the first big earners in NBA basketball. His 1956 rookie contract was worth $24,000 (), only fractionally smaller than the $25,000 of top earner and teammate Bob Cousy. Russell never had to work part-time. This was in contrast to other Celtics who had to work during the offseason to maintain their standard of living; Tom Heinsohn sold insurance, Gene Guarilia was a professional guitar player, Cousy ran a basketball camp, and Red Auerbach invested in plastics and a Chinese restaurant. When Wilt Chamberlain became the first NBA player to earn $100,000 in salary in 1965 (), Russell went to Auerbach and demanded a $100,001 salary, which he promptly received. For his promotion to coach, the Celtics paid Russell an annual salary of $25,000 which was in addition to his salary as a player. Although the salary was touted in the press as a record for an NBA coach, it is unclear whether Russell&#x27;s continued $100,001 salary as a player was included in the calculation. Russell also had a shoe designed by Bristol Manufacturing Corporation in 1966, the Bill Russell Professional Basketball Shoe.

===Russell–Chamberlain relations===

For most of his career, Russell and his perennial opponent Wilt Chamberlain were close friends. Chamberlain often invited Russell over for Thanksgiving dinner; at Russell&#x27;s place, conversation mostly concerned Russell&#x27;s electric trains. The close relationship ended after Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals, when Chamberlain injured his knee with six minutes left and was forced to leave the game. During a conversation with students, a reporter—unknown to Russell—heard Russell describe Chamberlain as a malingerer and accused him of &quot;copping out&quot; of the game when it seemed that the Lakers would lose. He was livid with Russell and saw him as a backstabber.

Chamberlain&#x27;s knee was injured so badly that he could not play the entire offseason and he ruptured it the next season. The two men did not speak to each other for more than twenty years until Russell met with Chamberlain and personally apologized. After that, the two were often seen together at various events and interviewed as friends. When Chamberlain died in 1999, Chamberlain&#x27;s nephew said that Russell was the second person he was told to call. In delivering a eulogy for Chamberlain, Russell stated that he did not consider them to be rivals, but rather to have a competition, and that the pair would &quot;be friends through eternity&quot;.

Chamberlain outscored Russell 30 to 14.2 and outrebounded him 28.2 to 22.9 in the regular season, and he also outscored him 25.7 to 14.9 and outrebounded him 28 to 24.7 in the playoffs. Russell&#x27;s Celtics went 57–37 in the regular season against Chamberlain&#x27;s teams and 29–20 in the playoffs, Chamberlain&#x27;s losing seven of the eight series.

===Racist abuse, controversy, and relationship with Boston fans===

Russell&#x27;s life was marked by an uphill battle against racism and controversial actions and statements in response to racism. As a child, he witnessed how his parents were victims of racial abuse, and the family eventually moved into government housing projects to escape the daily torrent of bigotry. When he later became a standout college player at USF, Russell recalled how he and his few fellow black teammates were jeered by white students.

Even after he became a star with the Celtics, Russell was the victim of racial abuse. When the NBA All-Stars toured the U.S. in the 1958 offseason, white hotel owners in segregated North Carolina denied rooms to Russell and his black teammates, causing him to later write in his 1966 memoir &quot;Go Up for Glory&quot;: &quot;It stood out, a wall which understanding cannot penetrate. You are a Negro. You are less. It covered every area. A living, smarting, hurting, smelling, greasy substance which covered you. A morass to fight from.&quot; Before the 1961–62 season, Russell&#x27;s team was scheduled to play in an exhibition game in Lexington, Kentucky, when Russell and his black teammates were refused service at a local restaurant. As part of the 1961 Celtics boycott, he and the other black teammates refused to play in the exhibition game and flew home, drawing a great deal of controversy and publicity.

As a consequence of his endured racist abuse, Russell was extremely sensitive to all racial prejudice. According to sportswriter Taylor, in a 2005 book, Russell often perceived insults even if others did not. He was active in the Black Power movement and was among the African-American athletes and the one political leader who came together at the 1967 Cleveland Summit to support Muhammad Ali and his decision to refuse to be drafted. He was often called Felton X, presumably in the tradition of the Nation of Islam&#x27;s practice of replacing a European slave name with an &quot;X&quot;, and purchased land in Liberia. Russell&#x27;s public statements became increasingly militant, and he was quoted as saying: &quot;I dislike most white people because they are people ... I like most blacks because I am black.&quot; Russell articulated these views with a measure of self-criticism, saying: &quot;I consider this a deficiency in myself—maybe. If I looked at it objectively, detached myself, it would be a deficiency.&quot; When his white Celtics teammate Frank Ramsey asked whether he hated him, Russell stated that he had been misquoted but few believed it. According to Taylor, Russell discounted the fact that his career was facilitated by white people who were proven anti-racists: his high school coach George Powles, who encouraged him to play basketball, his college coach Phil Woolpert, who integrated USF basketball, Celtics coach Red Auerbach, who made him the first black NBA coach and is regarded as an anti-racist pioneer for his no color barrier, and Celtics owner Walter A. Brown, who gave him a high $24,000 rookie contract, just $1,000 shy of the top-earning veteran Bob Cousy.

In a 1963 article by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Russell said he had &quot;never met a finer person [than George Powles] ... I owe so much to him it&#x27;s impossible to express.&quot; Years after Taylor&#x27;s book, Russell published the autobiographical account &quot;Red and Me&quot;, which chronicled his lifelong friendship with Auerbach. Of the book, Bill Bradley wrote for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; that &quot;Bill Russell is a private, complex man, but on the subject of his love of Red Auerbach and his Celtic teammates, he&#x27;s loud and clear.&quot; In the book, Russell wrote: &quot;Whenever I leave the Celtics locker room, even Heaven wouldn&#x27;t be good enough because anywhere else is a step down ... With Red [Auerbach] and Walter Brown, I was the freest athlete on the planet. I could always be myself with them and they were always there for me.&quot; Describing the Celtics organization, as distinguished from Boston sports fans in the 1950s and 1960s, as very progressive racially, Russell recalled in 2010 a list of the organization&#x27;s accomplishments on racial progress both in terms of objective milestones and his own subjective experience as a member of the organization. He said:
 
In 1966, Russell was promoted to head coach of the Celtics. During a press conference, Russell was asked: &quot;As the first Negro head coach in a major league sport, can you do the job impartially without any racial prejudice in reverse?&quot; He replied: &quot;Yes.&quot; When the reporter asked how, Russell responded: &quot;Because the most important factor is respect. And in basketball I respect a man for his ability, period.&quot; As a result of repeated racial bigotry, Russell refused to respond to fan acclaim or friendship from his neighbors, thinking it was insincere and hypocritical. This attitude contributed to his bad rapport with fans and journalists. He alienated Celtics fans by saying: &quot;You owe the public the same it owes you, nothing! I refuse to smile and be nice to the kiddies.&quot;

This supported the opinion of many white fans that Russell, who was by then the highest-paid Celtic, was egotistical, paranoid, and hypocritical. The already hostile atmosphere between Russell and Boston hit its apex when vandals broke into his house in Reading, Massachusetts, covered the walls with racist graffiti, damaged his trophies, and defecated in the beds. In response, Russell described Boston as a &quot;flea market of racism&quot;. He was quoted as saying: &quot;From my very first year I thought of myself as playing for the Celtics, not for Boston. The fans could do or think whatever they wanted.&quot; Referring to a time when the Celtics did not frequently sell out the Boston Garden, while the generally mediocre and all-white NHL Boston Bruins did, Russell recalled: &quot;We [the Celtics] did a survey about what we could do to improve attendance. Over 50 percent of responses said &#x27;There&#x27;s too many black players. In retirement, Russell described the Boston press as corrupt and racist; in response, Boston sports journalist Larry Claflin claimed that Russell himself was the real racist. The FBI maintained a file on Russell and described him in their file as &quot;an arrogant Negro who won&#x27;t sign autographs for white children&quot;.

Russell refused to attend the ceremony when his jersey No. 6 was retired in 1972; he also refused to attend his induction into the Hall of Fame in 1975. While Russell long had sore feelings towards Boston, there was something of a reconciliation, and he visited the city regularly in his later years, something he never did in the years immediately after his retirement. On November 15, 2019, Russell accepted the Hall of Fame ring in a private ceremony with family. When Russell originally retired, he demanded that his jersey be retired in an empty Boston Garden.

In 1995, the Celtics left the Boston Garden and moved into the FleetCenter, now known as the TD Garden; as the main festive act, the Celtics wanted to re-retire Russell&#x27;s jersey in front of a sellout audience. Perennially wary of what he long perceived as a racist city, Russell decided to make amends and gave his approval. On May 6, 1999, the Celtics re-retired Russell&#x27;s jersey in a ceremony attended by his on-court rival and friend Chamberlain, along with Celtics legend Larry Bird and Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The crowd gave Russell a prolonged standing ovation, which brought tears to his eyes. He thanked Chamberlain for taking him to the limit and &quot;making [him] a better player&quot;, and the crowd for &quot;allowing [him] to be a part of their lives.&quot; In December 2008, the We Are Boston Leadership Award was presented to Russell.

==Post-playing career and endeavors==

In 1971, Russell joined &quot;NBA on ABC&quot; to do commentary on the Game of the Week. His No. 6 jersey was retired by the Celtics on March 12, 1972, Russell had worn the same number 6 at the USF and for the 1956 U.S. Olympic team. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975. Russell, who had a difficult relationship with the media, did not attend either ceremony. He attended his 2021 induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach.

After retiring as a player, Russell had stints as head coach of the Seattle SuperSonics (1973–1977) and Sacramento Kings (1987–1988). His time as a non-playing coach was lackluster; he led the struggling SuperSonics into the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, but Russell&#x27;s defensive, team-oriented Celtics mindset did not mesh well with the team, and he left in 1977 with a 162–166 record. Russell&#x27;s stint with the Kings was considerably shorter, his last assignment ending when the Kings went 17–41 to begin the 1987–88 NBA season. He finished with a 341–290 regular season record and was 34–27 in the playoffs. Russell also served as general manager of the SuperSonics during his coaching tenure, and held the same position with the Kings during the 1988–89 season. In addition, Russell ran into financial trouble. He had invested $250,000 in a rubber plantation in Liberia, where he had wanted to spend his retirement, but it went bankrupt. The same fate awaited his Boston restaurant Slade&#x27;s, after which he had to default on a $90,000 government loan to purchase the outlet. The Internal Revenue Service discovered that Russell owed $34,430 in tax money and put a lien on his house.

Russell became a vegetarian, took up golf, and worked as a color commentator for CBS and TBS throughout the 1970s into the mid-1980s, but he was uncomfortable as a broadcaster. He later said: &quot;The most successful television is done in eight-second thoughts, and the things I know about basketball, motivation, and people go deeper than that.&quot; On November 3, 1979, Russell hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in which he appeared in several sports-related sketches. Russell also wrote books, usually written as a joint project with a professional writer, including 1979&#x27;s &quot;Second Wind&quot;, and played Judge Roger Ferguson in the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode &quot;The Fix&quot; (aired March 7, 1986). In 1985, former Celtic teammate Don Chaney, who was head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers, asked Russell to tutor Benoit Benjamin, the third overall draft pick from Creighton University, who left after his junior season; according to Chaney, Russell did not get paid for it.

Russell made few public appearances in the early 1990s, living as a near-recluse on Mercer Island, Washington, near Seattle. Following Chamberlain&#x27;s death in October 1999, Russell returned to prominence at the turn of the millennium. In 2001, Russell and David Falkner published &quot;Russell Rules: 11 Lessons on Leadership from the Twentieth Century&#x27;s Greatest Winner&quot;. Russell convinced Miami Heat superstar center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal to bury the hatchet with fellow NBA superstar and former Los Angeles Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant and end the Shaq–Kobe feud in January 2006. On November 17, the two-time NCAA champion Russell was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was one of five, along with James Naismith, Oscar Robertson, Dean Smith, and John Wooden, selected to represent the inaugural class. On May 20, 2007, Russell was awarded an honorary doctorate by Suffolk University, where he served as its commencement speaker. Russell also received honorary degrees from Harvard University on June 7, 2007, and from Dartmouth College on June 14, 2009. On June 18, 2007, Russell was inducted as a member of the founding class of the FIBA Hall of Fame. In 2008, Russell received the Golden Plate Award of the Academy of Achievement.

On February 14, 2009, NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award would be renamed the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his honor as an 11-time NBA champion. During halftime of the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, Celtics captains Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett, and Paul Pierce presented Russell a surprise birthday cake for his 75th birthday. Russell attended Game 5 of the 2009 NBA Finals to present Bryant the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player award. Russell was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2011. Russell and Bryant were spectators to a basketball game for Obama&#x27;s 50th birthday at the White House tennis court. The game featured Shane Battier, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Maya Moore, Alonzo Mourning, Joakim Noah, Chris Paul, Derrick Rose, and Obama&#x27;s friends from high school.

On September 26, 2017, Russell posted a photograph of himself to a previously unused Twitter account in which he was taking the knee in solidarity with the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests. Russell wore his Presidential Medal of Freedom and the image was captioned: &quot;Proud to take a knee, and to stand tall against social injustice.&quot; In an interview with ESPN, Russell said he wanted the NFL players to know they were not alone.

==Accomplishments and legacy==

Russell is one of the most successful and decorated athletes in North American sports history. His awards and achievements include eleven NBA championships with the Boston Celtics in thirteen seasons, two of which were won as player-coach, and he is credited with having raised defensive play in the NBA to a new level. By winning the 1956 NCAA championship with USF and the 1957 NBA title with the Celtics, Russell became the first of only five players in basketball history to win an NCAA championship and an NBA championship in back-to-back seasons, the others being Henry Bibby, Magic Johnson, Billy Thompson, and Christian Braun. He also won two state championships in high school. In the interim, Russell won an Olympic gold medal in 1956. Russell was one of only eight players in the history of basketball to achieve the Triple Crown — winning an NCAA championship, NBA championship, and Olympic gold medal. His stint as coach of the Celtics was also of historical significance, as he became the first black head coach in the NBA, when he succeeded Red Auerbach.

In his first NBA full season (1957–58), Russell became the first player in NBA history to average more than 20 rebounds per game for an entire season, a feat he accomplished ten times in his thirteen seasons. He is one of just two NBA players (the other being Wilt Chamberlain) to have grabbed more than 50 rebounds in a game. He still holds the NBA record for rebounds in one half with 32 (vs. Philadelphia, November 16, 1957). Career-wise in rebounds, Russell ranks second to Chamberlain in regular season total (21,620) and average per game (22.5), and he led the NBA in average rebounds per game four times. As of 2024, Russell is the leader for most career rebounds, most minutes per game (42.3), and most rebounds per game in Celtics franchise history. Russell is the all-time playoff leader in total (4,104) and average (24.9) rebounds per game, he grabbed 40 rebounds in three separate playoff games (twice in the NBA Finals), and he never failed to average at least 20 rebounds per game in any of his thirteen playoff campaigns. Russell also had seven regular-season games with 40 or more rebounds, the NBA Finals record for highest rebound per game average (29.5, 1959) and by a rookie (22.9, 1957). In addition, Russell holds the NBA Finals single-game record for most rebounds (40, March 29, 1960, vs. St. Louis, and April 18, 1962, vs. Los Angeles), most rebounds in a quarter (19, April 18, 1962, vs. Los Angeles), and most consecutive games with 20 or more rebounds (15 from April 9, 1960 – April 16, 1963). He also had 51 in one game, 49 in two others, and twelve straight seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds. Russell was known as one of the most clutch players in the NBA. He played in eleven deciding games (ten times in Game 7s, once in a Game 5) and ended with a 11–0 record. In these eleven games, Russell averaged 18.3 points and 29.4 rebounds.
Russell was considered the consummate defensive center, noted for his defensive intensity, basketball IQ, and will to win. He excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive rebounds. Chamberlain said Russell&#x27;s timing as a shot-blocker was unparalleled. In 2009, Russell&#x27;s erstwhile Knicks opponent Bill Bradley wrote in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; that Russell &quot;was the smartest player ever to play the game [of basketball]&quot;. He could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy fast-break points. He was also known as a fine passer and pick-and-roll setter, featured a decent left-handed hook shot, and finished strong on alley oops. On offense, Russell&#x27;s output was limited and his NBA career personal averages show him to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor free-throw shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his thirteen years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that he was never the focal point of the Celtics offense, who instead focused on his elite defense. He ranks No. 1 in NBA history for defensive win shares at 133.6, with Tim Duncan in second at 106.3. While blocked shots were not a recorded basketball statistic during Russell&#x27;s career, he averaged 8.1 blocks in 135 games, as Boston writers often attempted to tally his blocks. Bill Simmons has estimated that Russell had between 8 and 15 blocks per game in the playoffs.

Russell was driven by &quot;a neurotic need to win&quot;, as his Celtic teammate Tom Heinsohn observed. He was so tense before every game that he regularly vomited in the locker room; early in his career, it happened so frequently that his fellow Celtics were more worried when it did not happen than when it did. Later in Russell&#x27;s career, John Havlicek said of his teammate and coach that he threw up less often than early in his career, only doing so &quot;when it&#x27;s an important game or an important challenge for him—someone like Chamberlain, or someone coming up that everyone&#x27;s touting. [The sound of Russell throwing up] is a welcome sound, too, because it means he&#x27;s keyed up for the game, and around the locker room we grin and say, &#x27;Man, we&#x27;re going to be all right tonight. In a retrospective interview, Russell described the state of mind he felt he needed to enter in order to be able to play basketball: &quot;I had to almost be in a rage. Nothing went on outside the borders of the court. I could hear anything, I could see anything, and nothing mattered. And I could anticipate every move that every player made.&quot;

In his career, Russell won five NBA MVP awards (1959, 1961–63, 1965), which is tied with Michael Jordan for second all-time behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s six awards, and is at No. 6 for most regular season MVP–NBA Finals MVP awards, despite the latter being assigned only since 1969. He was selected three times to the All-NBA First Teams (1959, 1963, 1965) and eight Second Teams (1958, 1960–62, 1964, 1966–68), and was a 12-time NBA All-Star (1958–1969). Russell was elected to one NBA All-Defensive First Team. This took place during his last season (1969) and was the first season the NBA All-Defensive Teams were selected. In 1970, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named Russell the &quot;Athlete of the Decade&quot;. Russell is universally seen as one of the best NBA players ever, and he was declared &quot;Greatest Player in the History of the NBA&quot; by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America in 1980.
For his achievements, Russell was named &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1968. He is one of four players (along with Cousy, George Mikan, and Bob Pettit) to have made all four NBA anniversary teams: the NBA 25th Anniversary Team (1970), the NBA 35th Anniversary Team (1980), the NBA 50th Anniversary Team (1996), and the NBA 75th Anniversary Team (2021). Russell ranked No. 18 on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century&quot; list in 1999. In 2007, he was voted the third best center of all time by ESPN behind Abdul-Jabbar and Chamberlain. In 2009, &quot;Slam&quot; named him the third best player of all-time behind Jordan and Chamberlain. In 2020, he was ranked No. 4 in ESPN&#x27;s list of the top 74 NBA players of all time, the second best center behind Abdul-Jabbar and ahead of Chamberlain. In 2022, he was ranked No. 6 in ESPN&#x27;s NBA 75th Anniversary Team list, and No. 4 in a similar list by &quot;The Athletic&quot;.

Of Russell, former NBA player and head coach Don Nelson said: &quot;There are two types of superstars. One makes himself look good at the expense of the other guys on the floor. But there&#x27;s another type who makes the players around him look better than they are, and that&#x27;s the type Russell was.&quot; In 2000, his longtime teammate Tom Heinsohn described both Russell&#x27;s stature and his uneasy relationship with Boston more earthily, saying: &quot;Look, all I know is the guy ... came to Boston and won 11 championships in 13 years, and they named a bleeping tunnel after Ted Williams.&quot; During the NBA All-Star Weekend on February 14, 2009, NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the NBA Finals MVP award would be named after Russell. He was named as a 2010 recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. On June 15, 2017, Russell was announced as the inaugural recipient of the NBA Lifetime Achievement Award. In October 2021, Russell was honored as one of the league&#x27;s 75 greatest players of all time.

On August 11, 2022, it was announced that Russell&#x27;s No. 6 jersey would be retired throughout the National Basketball Association, the first time a jersey had been retired league-wide in NBA history, and joining Jackie Robinson and Wayne Gretzky in the honor among the four major American sports leagues. However, the NBA players who wore the number 6 jersey at that time, such as LeBron James, may keep the number under the grandfather clause until they voluntarily change it or retire, similar to what MLB players did with Robinson&#x27;s No. 42.

In October 2024, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and other officials announced that the city would rename the new North Washington Street Bridge (located near TD Garden) in honor of Russell. At the time of the renaming, the &quot;William Felton &#x27;Bill&#x27; Russell Bridge&quot; was under construction as the replacement of a bridge known locally as the Charlestown Bridge.

===Statue===
In 2013, Boston honored Russell by erecting a statue of him on City Hall Plaza. He is depicted in-game, surrounded by 11 plinths representing the 11 championships he helped the Celtics win. Each plinth features a key word and related quote to illustrate Russell&#x27;s multiple accomplishments. The Bill Russell Legacy Foundation, established by the Boston Celtics Shamrock Foundation, funded the project. The art is by Ann Hirsch of Somerville, Massachusetts, in collaboration with Pressley Associates Landscape Architects of Boston. The statue was unveiled on November 1, 2013, with Russell in attendance. During the spring of 2015, two statues of children were added, honoring Russell&#x27;s commitment to working with children. These statues were modeled by a local boy from Somerville and multiple girls from the surrounding area.

===West Coast Conference&#x27;s Russell Rule===
On August 2, 2020, the West Coast Conference (WCC), which has been home to Russell&#x27;s alma mater of USF since the league&#x27;s formation in 1952, became the first NCAA Division I conference to adopt a conference-wide diversity hiring commitment, announcing the Russell Rule, named after Russell and based on the National Football League&#x27;s Rooney Rule. In its announcement, the WCC stated: &quot;The &#x27;Russell Rule&#x27; requires each member institution to include a member of a traditionally underrepresented community in the pool of final candidates for every athletic director, senior administrator, head coach and full-time assistant coach position in the athletic department.&quot;

==Personal life and death==

Russell was a resident of Mercer Island, Washington, for nearly five decades.

In 1959, Russell became the first NBA player to visit Africa.

Russell was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, having been initiated into its Gamma Alpha chapter while a student at University of San Francisco.

On October 16, 2013, Russell was arrested for bringing his registered, loaded .38-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson handgun to the Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. He was issued a citation and released, and the Transportation Security Administration indicated it would levy a civil penalty, which would be between $3,000 and $7,500.

===Marriages and children===
Russell was married to his college sweetheart Rose Swisher from 1956 to 1973. They had three children: daughter Karen Russell, a television pundit and lawyer, and sons William Jr. and Jacob. The couple grew emotionally distant and divorced. In 1977, he married Dorothy Anstett, Miss USA of 1968; they divorced in 1980. In 1996, Russell married his third wife, Marilyn Nault; their marriage lasted until her death in January 2009. Russell was married to Jeannine Russell at the time of his death.

===Personality===
In 1966, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Russell&#x27;s main characteristics are pride, intelligence, an active and appreciative sense of humor, a preoccupation with dignity, a capacity for consideration once his friendship or sympathy has been aroused, and an unwillingness to compromise whatever truths he has accepted.&quot; In 2009, Russell wrote his paternal grandfather&#x27;s motto, passed down to his father and then to him: &quot;A man has to draw a line inside himself that he won&#x27;t allow any man to cross.&quot; Russell said he was &quot;proud of my grandfather&#x27;s heroic dignity against forces more powerful than him ... he would not allow himself to be oppressed or intimidated by anyone.&quot; He wrote these words after recounting how grandfather Jake Russell had stood up to the Ku Klux Klan and other whites who attempted to thwart his efforts to build a schoolhouse for black children; his grandfather was the first person in Russell&#x27;s patrilineal line born free in North America and was himself illiterate. Russell&#x27;s motto became: &quot;If you disrespect that line, you disrespect me.&quot;

Russell was known for his distinctive high-pitched laugh, of which Red Auerbach quipped: &quot;There are only two things that could make me quit coaching. My wife and Russell&#x27;s laugh.&quot; To teammates and friends, Russell was open and amicable; he was extremely distrusting and cold towards anyone else. Journalists were often treated to the &quot;Russell Glower&quot;, described as an &quot;icily contemptuous stare accompanied by a long silence&quot;. Russell was also notorious for his refusal to give autographs or acknowledge the Celtics fans, and was called &quot;the most selfish, surly and uncooperative athlete&quot; by one pundit.

===Death===
Russell died at his Mercer Island, Washington, home on July 31, 2022, at the age of 88. The news was announced in a Twitter post by his family. In a statement, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said that Russell was &quot;the greatest champion in all of team sports&quot;.

<doc id="412215" wikidata="Q461754" url="?curid=412215" title="Julia Carson">
<text>Julia May Carson (née Porter; July 8, 1938 – December 15, 2007) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for from 1997 until she died in 2007 (numbered as the 10th District from 1997 to 2003). Carson was the first woman and first African American to represent Indianapolis in the U.S. Congress. She was also the second African American woman elected to Congress from Indiana, after Katie Hall, and her grandson André Carson succeeded to her seat following her death.

==Early life and education==
Carson was born in Louisville, Kentucky. Her mother, Velma V. Porter, was an unmarried teenager. Velma and Julia moved to Indianapolis, while Julia was still a girl. Velma worked as a domestic worker to support them. To help her family, Julia took on various part-time jobs, including waiting tables, delivering newspapers, and harvesting crops. She graduated from Crispus Attucks High School in 1955. She continued in part-time work while attending Martin University in Indianapolis and Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis. She was a member of Zeta Phi Beta sorority.

==Career==
In 1965, while a single mother and working as a secretary at UAW Local 550, Carson was hired away by newly elected congressman Andrew Jacobs Jr., a Democrat, to do casework in his Indianapolis office. When his electoral prospects looked dim in 1972 (which turned out to be a Republican landslide), Jacobs encouraged Carson to run for the Indiana House of Representatives, which she did. She won election from the central Indianapolis district in 1972, and re-election. She served as a delegate for four years and rose to become assistant minority caucus chair. The legislature was a part-time position, and Carson also worked as the human resources director at an electric company from 1973 to 1996. She also once operated a clothing store, which failed and saddled her with debt for several years.

In 1976, at the urging of fellow Democrats, Carson arranged for prominent local businessman and fellow Democrat Joseph W. Summers to run for her house seat, as she successfully ran for the Indiana Senate. She won re-election and ultimately served in the Indiana Senate for 14 years, sitting on its finance committee and eventually holding the minority whip position before retiring in 1990. Carson and Katie Hall (a fellow Democrat but from Lake County who also won an election that year) became the first African American women to win election to the Indiana Senate; the first African American to sit in that body had been Virginia-born civil rights attorney Robert Lee Brokenburr, a Republican who had died in 1974 and who represented part of Marion County for most of the period 1941–1964.

In 1990, Carson won election as the Trustee for Center Township (downtown Indianapolis), seemingly a step down from her legislative post, but with a considerable budget and administrative responsibilities. Carson assumed responsibility for running welfare in central Indianapolis and instituted a workfare program. During Carson&#x27;s six years as the Center Township Trustee, she created a $6 million surplus and erased the office&#x27;s $20 million debt. The county&#x27;s auditor (a Republican) noted Carson &quot;wrestled that monster to the ground.&quot; Jacobs proclaimed Carson &quot;not only took cheats off the welfare rolls, she sued them to get the money.&quot;

==Congressional elections==
When Jacobs retired in 1996, Carson ran as his replacement in the 10th Congressional District, winning the Democratic Party&#x27;s endorsement, 49 percent to 31 percent, despite being heavily outspent in the primary by party chairman Ann DeLaney.

In the general election, Carson faced Republican Virginia Murphy Blankenbaker, a state senator and stockbroker who, like Carson, was a grandmother with liberal views on abortion and the death penalty. Although the district was 68% white and conservative-leaning, each raised similar sums of money, but Carson won, with 53 percent of the vote versus 45 percent for Blankenbaker. Soon after that, Carson underwent double heart bypass surgery on January 4, 1997, which years later produced complications. Carson was sworn into office from her hospital bed on January 9, 1997, and could not travel to Washington, D.C., until early March.

Carson won reelection with little difficulty in 1998 and 2000. Her 2000 campaign attracted President Bill Clinton &#x27;s personal appearance, drawing thousands to the Indiana State Fairgrounds. In 2003, Carson helped win $11 million in federal funding for transportation initiatives in Indianapolis, including highway expansion, street improvements, and improved public transportation. In 2005, Carson sponsored the $40 billion Amtrak–re-authorization bill (the National Defense Rail Act), which provided for new rail lines, including high–speed rail corridors. In 2006, Carson traveled from Washington, D.C., to Indianapolis aboard Air Force One with President George W. Bush to appear at the Indiana Black Expo.

Her health (including asthma, hypertension, and diabetes) became an issue in tighter-than-expected races beginning in 2002. After Indiana lost a Congressional district following the 2000 census, her district was renumbered as the 7th District and included slightly more registered Republicans than its predecessor. In a heated campaign that led to Carson leaving the stage in protest in the final pre-election debate with Republican public affairs specialist Brose McVey, she won re-election 53 percent to 44 percent. Carson won re-election by about 11 points in 2004, defeating Republican Andrew Horning and Libertarian Barry Campbell.

Carson defeated Eric Dickerson in the 2006 election 54 percent to 46 percent, a narrow 8-point margin in a year when most incumbent Democrats skated to victory. In the same election, Democratic challengers toppled Republican incumbents in three Indiana districts much more conservative than Carson&#x27;s. Carson was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. She was one of the 31 who voted in the House not to count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election. Notably Carson never lost an election throughout her entire career in both state and federal politics.

==House record==
Carson won re-election numerous times, although redistricting added 100,000 people, many of them Republicans, to her district. She focused on issues that affected working-class Americans, many of which she experienced, and on constituent service. She won re-election rather handily during the next four elections. However, some criticized her for being somewhat unpredictable, particularly in votes for anti-terrorism bills and normal trade relations with China. Carson was one of the last representatives to support trade normalization with China in 2000 (because of its human rights record) and opposed the Iraq War resolution in 2002.

During the 105th Congress (1997–1999), Carson received posts on the Banking and Financial Services Committee (later renamed Financial Services) and the Veterans Affairs Committee and continued in those positions during the 106th and 107th Congresses. The Roudebush VA Medical Center was in her district, and she often visited recuperating veterans and could identify with many of their health problems. In the 108th Congress (2003–2005), Carson left Veterans Affairs to accept the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee assignment. Amtrak&#x27;s largest repair facility was near Indianapolis, and she would sponsor Amtrak&#x27;s largest reauthorization bill in 2005. Carson helped create the Indiana Mortgage and Foreclosure Hotline to counsel homeowners and potential buyers about the mortgage process, noting that although Indiana had one of the country&#x27;s highest homeownership rates in 2001, it experienced a record number of foreclosures in 2004. She also regularly sponsored children&#x27;s safety, health, and nutrition legislation, including comprehensive gun safety legislation (protecting children by requiring safety locks on handguns) in 1999.

Carson&#x27;s legislative record included leading Congress to award Rosa Parks the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999 and 2005, allowing the civil rights icon to become the first woman to lie in state in the U.S. Capital Rotunda. Carson also cosponsored, with (Republican) Sen. Richard Lugar, the removal of bureaucratic bottlenecks on child health insurance; and commemorating author Kurt Vonnegut (H.RES.324). Other Congressional accomplishments included critical funding to revitalize Indianapolis&#x27;s Fall Creek Neighborhood (which today includes some of the finest examples of reclaimed urban landscape in the U.S.). Carson also supported the new terminal for the Indianapolis International Airport, which opened on November 12, 2008. She was the first recipient of the Frank O&#x27;Bannon Award from Indiana Stonewall Democrats. Carson also co-sponsored the Equal Employment Non-Discrimination Act and was a member of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Equality Caucus in the U.S. House led by U.S. Representative Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts.

==Illness and death==
On September 29, 2007, the &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot; reported that Carson had been an in-patient at Indianapolis&#x27;s Methodist Hospital for eight days. She was being treated for an infection in her leg near the area where a vein was removed in 1996 during double bypass heart surgery. Year-to-date, Carson had participated in 87 percent of the House votes, but had missed 42 of 77 votes during the month. Carson had battled lung cancer before. Still, it had gone into remission before being re-diagnosed during the leg vein treatment, as the &quot;Star&quot; announced on November 25. She died on December 15, at the age of 69; her death was announced by her friend, former U.S. Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr.

On December 21, Carson&#x27;s casket was taken to the Indiana Statehouse in downtown Indianapolis by horse-drawn military caisson. She became the ninth Hoosier to lie in repose at the Statehouse Rotunda. An early-morning service was held in the statehouse, with remarks by Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels and Carson&#x27;s grandson, Councilman André Carson. Thousands of Hoosiers paid last respects, visiting the casket and attending an evening ceremony in the Statehouse. Celebrants included Jacobs, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson (D), U.S. Representative Brad Ellsworth (D-Ind.), U.S. Representative Baron Hill (D-Ind.), U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), U.S. Representative Diane Watson (D-Calif.) and former Gary, Indiana mayor Richard Hatcher. Rudolph M. Clay, the then-incumbent mayor of Gary, presented a key to the city to the Carson family.

Carson&#x27;s funeral was held at Eastern Star Baptist Church on December 22. Speakers at included Governor Daniels (R), both U.S. Senator Richard Lugar ( R-Ind.) and Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), former U.S. Senator Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), U.S. Representative Pete Visclosky (D-Ind.), U.S. Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones (D-Ohio), Indiana House Speaker B. Patrick Bauer (D-South Bend), Indianapolis Mayor Peterson, radio host and Hoosier native Tavis Smiley, and Minister Louis Farrakhan. Carson was buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis; the graveside ceremony included a three-volley salute.

== Personal life ==
She married after graduating and had two children, Sam and Tonya. She later divorced.

== Legacy ==
During her life, Carson was named the Indianapolis Star Woman of the Year in 1974 and 1991 and was inducted into the Indiana Public Schools Hall of Fame in 2006. A commemorative bust honoring her was unveiled in the Indiana statehouse in 2014, and she was also remembered during Indiana&#x27;s celebration of Women&#x27;s History month in 2015. Indianapolis named its local government center to honor Carson in 1997 and its transit center to honor her in 2016. Ivy Tech Community College named its new library and community space in Indianapolis to honor Carson in 2011. Julia Carson&#x27;s papers are held in the library of Indiana University in Indianapolis. Indianapolis also wanted to award landmark status to her former home.

A special election was held on March 11, 2008, to determine Carson&#x27;s replacement in Congress. Although he had won his first elective office (as an Indianapolis city councilman) only weeks before Carson&#x27;s death, her grandson André Carson won the election, defeating Republican state representative Jon Elrod and Libertarian Sean Shepard. André Carson won the May 2008 Democratic Primary for Congress against six opponents. U.S. Senator Barack Obama (D-Illinois) had endorsed Carson before his primary victory.

<text>Thame is a market town and civil parish in Oxfordshire, about east of the city of Oxford and southwest of Aylesbury. It derives its name from the River Thame which flows along the north side of the town and forms part of the county border with Buckinghamshire. The parish includes the hamlet of Moreton south of the town. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 11,561. Thame was founded in the Anglo-Saxon era and was in the kingdom of Wessex.

==History==
===Abbey, parish church and prebendal===

Thame Abbey was founded in 1138 for the Cistercian Order: the abbey church was consecrated in 1145. In the 16th century Dissolution of the Monasteries the abbey was suppressed and the church demolished. Thame Park (the house) was built on the site, incorporating parts of the abbey including the early-16th century abbot&#x27;s house. Its interior is one of the earliest examples of the Italian Renaissance in England. A Georgian west wing was added in the 18th century. In about 1840 parts of the foundations of the abbey church were excavated: it was long and wide, with a Lady Chapel extending a further at the east end.

The earliest feature of the Church of England parish church of Mary the Virgin is the 12th century base of the font. The font&#x27;s octagonal bowl was re-cut in the 13th century. The present church is a cruciform building that was built in the 13th century. The chancel is Early English Gothic and was built in about 1220, with six lancet windows in its north wall and presumably a similar arrangement in the south wall. It was twice altered in the next few decades: a three-light plate tracery window was inserted in its north wall in the mid-13th century and the five-light east window with geometrical tracery was inserted in about 1280. Whatever lancet windows may have been in the chancel south wall were replaced with three two-light Decorated Gothic windows with reticulated tracery, and a double piscina was added at the same time.

The transepts and tower arches are also early 13th century. The nave has five-bay north and south aisles whose arcades were built in about 1260. The aisles were widened in the 14th century, when they acquired their Decorated Gothic windows and doors. The Decorated Gothic south porch has two storeys and a two-bay quadripartite vault.

The Perpendicular Gothic clerestory is 14th or early 15th century. In the 15th century the tower piers were strengthened and the two upper stages of the tower were built. In 1442 the north transept was rebuilt with five-light Perpendicular Gothic north and east windows with panel tracery. At about the same time the south transept acquired similar windows and was extended eastwards to form a chapel with a 15th-century piscina. The Perpendicular Gothic nave west window was inserted in 1672–73, making it an example of Gothic survival. In 1838 the north aisle north wall was rebuilt under the direction of George Wilkinson. The tower has a ring of eight bells, all cast by Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1876.

The Prebendal House is known to have existed by 1234, The Early English Gothic chapel was built in about 1250. The solar is also 13th century but was enlarged in the 14th, when the present crown-post roof was added. The rest of the Prebendal House is dated from the 15th century. The hall is 14th century in plan but was later divided, and one part now has a fine 15th century roof. In 1661 the antiquary Anthony Wood reported that the house was ruinous, and early in the 19th century the remains were in use as a farmhouse and barns. It was restored in 1836. The prebendal houses and the Church of St. Mary were both attacked repeatedly in the early 1290s during a violent conflict between the bishop of Lincoln, Oliver Sutton, and a knight of King Edward I, Sir John St. John. The Prebendal House was the home of singer/songwriter Robin Gibb and his wife Dwina from 1984, and Gibb is buried in St Mary&#x27;s parish churchyard.

===Social and economic history===

In 1550 the courtier John Williams, 1st Baron Williams of Thame built the almshouses in Church Lane. He died in 1559, and his will established the local grammar school. Its original building, completed in 1569, stands next to the almshouses. In 1880 the school moved to its current premises in Oxford Road. In 1971 it became a comprehensive school under the name Lord Williams&#x27;s School.

The Civil War in the 1640s saw Thame occupied in turn by Royalists and by Parliamentarians. After the Battle of Chalgrove Field in 1643, Colonel John Hampden, who had been educated at the grammar school, died of his wounds at the house of Ezekiel Browne, later to become the Greyhound Inn.

The champion bare-knuckle boxer James Figg was born in Thame in the late 17th century and had his early prize-fights at the Greyhound Inn. In the 21st century the Greyhound Inn was renamed the James Figg and in April 2011 the Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board unveiled a blue plaque there to commemorate him.
In the 18th century many of the buildings in the boat-shaped High Street were re-faced with modern facades built of locally produced salt glazed bricks. Late in the 18th century John Wesley preached in Thame. The congregation on that occasion was so large that the floor of the building gave way, and the crowd fell to the lower floor.

By 1813 Thame had a workhouse in Wellington Street. In 1826 John Boddington, a miller who had been the proprietor of Thame Mill, became master of the workhouse. In 1831 his son, also John Boddington, became a clerk at Strangeways Brewery in Manchester. A younger son, Henry Boddington, who had been born at Thame Mill in 1813, followed his brother and joined the same brewery in 1832. Henry became a partner in the business in 1847 and sole proprietor in 1853, after which its beers were called Boddingtons. In April 2011 the Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board unveiled a blue plaque at the address of the former workhouse commemorating its association with Henry Boddington.

Thame Poor Law Union was established in 1835 and the following year a new workhouse designed by George Wilkinson was built on Oxford Road. In the 20th century the building became the premises of Rycotewood College of further education. In 2003 with two other colleges of further education to form Oxford and Cherwell College, now City of Oxford College.

Thame railway station was opened in 1862 as the temporary terminus of an extension of the Wycombe Railway from . The extension was completed in 1864 when it reached . In 1963 British Railways withdrew passenger services between and Oxford and closed Thame station, leaving Princes Risborough (7 miles) as the nearest passenger station until 1987 (see below) BR dismantled the track between Thame and , but kept the line between Thame and Princes Risborough open for goods traffic to and from an oil depot in Thame.

Thame Town Hall was designed by the architect HJ Tollit in Jacobethan style and built in 1888.

In 1940 Willocks McKenzie, a local lorry driver, found a small hoard of late Medieval coins and rings beside the River Thame. The coins were ten groats and the rings were five ornate examples ranging from the 14th to the 16th centuries. The county Coroner declared them to be treasure trove and therefore Crown property. The Crown placed the hoard on permanent loan to the Ashmolean Museum. The most ornate ring was an ecclesiastical one incorporating a small reliquary. Its lid is decorated with a distinctive cross with two horizontal sections, similar to the Cross of Lorraine. Thame Town Council incorporated this cross into its town emblem.

In 1974 the M40 motorway was extended from High Wycombe to Chilworth Farm at Great Milton. Junction 7 at Milton Common is about southwest of Thame, giving the town a fast road link to London. In 1990 the M40 extension was completed, giving Thame a fast road link to Birmingham.

In 1987 British Rail opened station at Haddenham, about northeast of Thame, on the Chiltern Main Line. Chiltern Railways now provides passenger services linking the railway station to High Wycombe, , and . The station has a large car park, a taxi office, and regular buses into Thame.

In 1991 Thame oil depot closed, and BR dismantled the railway between Thame and Princes Risborough. Sustrans was allowed to re-use the former trackbed to create the Phoenix Trail which is part of National Cycle Network route 57. Reopening the rail line through Thame was an option considered by Chiltern Railways in their plan to open a direct rail route from London Marylebone to Oxford via Princes Risborough in 2015. The cost of reinstating bridges was considered prohibitive.

Bentley Productions used Thame many times as a location for the &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; drama series, representing the fictional town of Causton.

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Thame, at civil parish (town), district and county level: Thame Town Council, South Oxfordshire District Council, and Oxfordshire County Council. The town council is based at Thame Town Hall in the High Street.

===Administrative history===
Thame was an ancient parish. The parish historically included the chapelries of Sydenham, Tetsworth, and Towersey, each of which had become separate parishes by the early nineteenth century.

In 1871, the parish of Thame was made a local government district, administered by an elected local board. Thame Town Hall was completed in 1888 to serve as the meeting place and offices of the local board, as well as providing a public hall for the town. It was funded by public subscriptions to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. Local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

Thame Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. District-level functions passed to the new South Oxfordshire District Council. A successor parish called Thame was created covering the area of the abolished urban district, with its parish council taking the name Thame Town Council.

==Economy==
The town&#x27;s two largest employers, CPM Group and Travelodge, both have their head offices on the edge of the town. W. Lucy &amp; Co. moved its base from Oxford to Thame in 2005.

They include route 110 operated by Redline Buses and routes 111, 112 and 113 run by Z&amp;S Transport.

The 121 bus service route is a circular route that goes hourly around Thame. Until the end of April 2023, Redline Buses operated the route.

<doc id="412228" wikidata="Q3127990" url="?curid=412228" title="Hartwell House, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Hartwell House is a country house in the parish of Hartwell in Buckinghamshire, Southern England. The house is owned by the Ernest Cook Trust, has been a Historic House Hotel since 1989, and in 2008 was leased to the National Trust. The Grade I listed house is Jacobean with a Georgian front and Rococo interiors, set in a picturesque landscaped park, and is most famous as the home of exiled French king Louis XVIII in the early 19th century.

==Location==
The house is in the village of Stone along the A418, about from the centre of Aylesbury, the nearest large town, which is about from the centre of London via the A41.

==History==
The property was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 and belonged to William Peverel.

The core of the present house was constructed in the early 17th century for the Hampden family and then the Lee family. The Lees, an old Buckinghamshire family, acquired Hartwell c.1650 by marriage into the Hampdens.

===Bourbon Court===
Between 1809 and 1814 the owner of the house, Sir Charles Lee, let the mansion to the French prince Louis Stanislas Xavier, Count of Provence, the future King Louis XVIII. The arrival of the impoverished prince and his court at Hartwell was not a happy experience for the mansion, with once grand and imperious courtiers farming chickens and assorted small livestock on the lead roofs. Louis&#x27;s wife, Marie Joséphine of Savoy died at Hartwell in 1810. After her death, her body was carried first to Westminster Abbey, and one year later to Sardinia, where the Savoy King of Sardinia had withdrawn during Napoleonic occupation of Turin and Piedmont; she is buried in Cagliari Cathedral. Prince Louis signed the document accepting the French crown in the library of the house, following the defeat of Napoleon.

===Scientific hub===
In 1827, Dr John Lee, an astronomer, inherited the house from the unmarried Revd Sir George Lee. During his ownership, the British Meteorological Society, now the Royal Meteorological Society, was founded in the library in 1850.

====The Hartwell Observatory====
William Henry Smyth, one of Lee&#x27;s regular scientist guests invited to discuss theories &quot;year after year&quot; at Hartwell, who had helped with the design of the telescope and cupola that Lee had installed, described the house and the Hartwell Observatory established there, in &quot;Ædes Hartwellianæ: Or, Notices of the Manor and Mansion of Hartwell&quot; (Printed for private circulation, by J.B. Nichols and Son, London, 1851). Many of the illustrations in the book are by Smyth&#x27;s wife Annarella and by his son-in-law, Rev. Prof. Baden Powell.

===Subsequent use===
Revd Nicholas Lee inherited the house when his brother, Dr John, died on 25 February 1866 at Hartwell.
The house remained a private residence until 1938, when, at risk of demolition, the estate was acquired by the philanthropist Ernest Cook and the contents sold off by public auction. The estate passed to the Ernest Cook Trust when it was founded in 1952.

In the 1960s the house became a girls&#x27; finishing school, then was let in the 1980s to be run as a hotel. The house was converted and became part of the Historic House Hotels group. Its proximity to Chequers means that it has frequently been the host of international and government summits and meetings. A speciality of the house restaurant is the local Aylesbury Duck.

==Architectural description==

The Jacobean north front of the house is constructed of ashlar and has a projecting porch with a bow window above. At each end of this facade are two flanking canted bays, each with a double height oriel window. Immediately on each side of the porch are two large windows of the hall inside. Hiding the roofscape is a parapet with vases erected in 1740.

Between 1759 and 1761, architect Henry Keene substantially enlarged and &quot;Georgianised&quot; the house, and built the east front with its canted bay windows and a central porch in the Tuscan style. Inside, the great hall has stucco panels, and three reception rooms with rococo chimneypieces.

The 1980s conversion to a hotel was overseen by the architect Eric Throssell who created a new dining room in the style of Sir John Soane, by enclosing the former 18th-century open arcaded porch. The former semi-circular galleried entrance vestibule became an inner hall. Throssel was also responsible for the design and recreation of the cupola crowning the roof.

==Gardens==
The of gardens at Hartwell were laid out by Capability Brown c.1750. The North Avenue is a grand vista through trees planted in 1830, sadly today terminated by the ever encroaching town of Aylesbury. The gardens are reminiscent of nearby Stowe, with statues, an obelisk and ornamental bridge.
The Hartwell Estate currently covers of farmland surrounding Hartwell House.

Hartwell&#x27;s Egyptian Spring is a folly built in 1850 by Joseph Bonomi the Younger, an Egyptologist. It is an alcove seat on the western side of Lower Hartwell opposite a small spring. The stone pylon bears the Greek inscription &quot;ΑΡΙΣΤοΝ ΜΕΝ ΥΔΩΡ&quot;, translated as &quot;Water is Best&quot;, attributed to Thales.

==Acquisition by the National Trust==
In September 2008 the National Trust acquired a long lease of the house from the Ernest Cook Trust (until 2111). The gift had been under discussion for almost 30 years and in 1997 the National Trust accepted restrictive covenants over all three properties. The house and grounds were gifted the Trust by the directors of Historic House Hotels (HHH). The house continues its present use as a hotel under the existing HHH management. Three National Trust directors joined the HHH board and all profits will go to Trust funds to provide for the long-term care of the three houses.

==Public access==
It is envisaged that arrangements will be put in place for the gardens and grounds of the hall to be open to visitors, along with tours of the ground floor rooms.

<text>In the U.S. education system, magnet schools are public schools with specialized courses or curricula. Normally, a student will attend an elementary school, and this also determines the middle school and high school they attend unless they move. &quot;Magnet&quot; refers to how magnet schools accept students from different areas, pulling students out of the normal progression of schools. Attending them is voluntary.

There are magnet schools at the elementary, middle, and high school levels. In the United States, where education is decentralized, some magnet schools are established by school districts and draw only from the district, while others are set up by state governments and may draw from multiple districts. Other magnet programs are within comprehensive schools, as is the case with several &quot;schools within a school&quot;. In large urban areas, several magnet schools with different specializations may be combined into a single &quot;center,&quot; such as Skyline High School in Dallas.

Other countries have similar types of schools, such as specialist schools in the United Kingdom. Most of these are academically selective. Other schools are built around elite sporting programs or teach agricultural skills such as farming or animal husbandry.

In 1965, then Vice President Hubert Humphrey came to John Bartram High School in Southwest Philadelphia to declare it the first magnet school in the country. Bartram&#x27;s curriculum was concentrated in the commercial field, offering commercial and business training to students from all over Philadelphia.

==History==
In the United States, the term &quot;magnet school&quot; refers to public schools with enrichment programs that are designed to attract and serve certain targeted subgroups of potential students and their families. There are two major categories of public magnet school structures in the United States, and although there is some overlap, their origins and missions remain largely distinct. The first type of magnet school is the fully competitive admissions magnet school. These schools use competitive admissions, usually rely on a standardized assessment score, and are structured to serve and support populations that are 100% gifted and/or talented students. Schools in this group generally rank among the top 100 public high schools in the United States. Examples of this type of school and program include the Maine School of Science and Mathematics, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Virginia, The School Without Walls in the District of Columbia, and nine schools that all use competitive admissions and are overseen by the New York City Department of Education (which still uses the older term &quot;specialized school&quot; instead of &quot;magnet school&quot; to refer to them). In addition, Chicago Public Schools uses the term &quot;selective enrollment&quot; instead of &quot;magnet school&quot;. Another type of &quot;magnet school&quot; or &quot;magnet program&quot; emerged in the United States in the 1970s as one means of remedying racial segregation in public schools, and they were written into law in Section 5301 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Authorization. Demographic trends following the 1954 &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; US Supreme Court decision revealed a pattern later characterized as white flight, the hypersegregation of blacks and whites, as the latter moved to the suburbs. The first charter school, McCarver Elementary School, opened in Tacoma, Washington, in 1968. This second type of magnet can often take the form of &quot;a school within a school,&quot; meaning that the school may have no competitive admissions for the majority of the school population, and even the magnet program itself may not have fully competitive admissions. This is consistent with the equity-based objectives of such programs.

With the magnets designed to increase equity, at first school districts tried using involuntary plans which involved court-ordered attendance, the busing of children far from their homes, and building closer schools to achieve the required balance. Later, voluntary school integration plans were developed. One approach that educators within the public school system came up with was open schools. During the Open Schools movement of the 1970s, several ideas designed to influence public education were put into practice, including Schools without Walls, Schools within a School, Multicultural Schools, Continuation Schools, Learning Centers, Fundamental Schools, and Magnet Schools. &quot;These schools were characterized by parent, student, and teacher choice, autonomy in learning and pace, non-competitive evaluation, and a child centered approach.&quot; Magnet schools have been the most successful of the ideas that originated from the Open Schools movement. It was expounded in 1971 by educator Nolan Estes, superintendent of Dallas Independent School District. The Magnet Schools Assistance Program was developed in the early 1980s as a way to encourage schools to address &quot;de facto&quot; racial segregation. Funds were given to school districts that implemented voluntary desegregation plans or court orders to reduce racial isolation.

From 1985 to 1999, a US district court judge required the state of Missouri to fund the creation of magnet schools in the Kansas City Public Schools to reverse the white flight that had afflicted the school district since the 1960s. The district&#x27;s annual budget more than tripled in the process. The expenditure per pupil and the student-teacher ratio were the best of any major school district in the nation. Many high schools were given college-level facilities. Still, test scores in the magnet schools did not rise; the black-white gap did not diminish; and there was less, not greater, integration.
Finally, on September 20, 2011, The Missouri Board of Education voted unanimously to withdraw the district&#x27;s educational accreditation status from January 1, 2012.

Districts started embracing the magnet school models in the hope that their geographically open admissions would end racial segregation in &quot;good&quot; schools and decrease &quot;de facto&quot; segregation of schools in poorer areas. To encourage the voluntary desegregation, districts started developing magnet schools to draw students to specialized schools all across their districts. Each magnet school would have a specialized curriculum that would draw students based on their interests. One of the goals of magnet schools is to eliminate, reduce, and prevent minority group isolation while providing the students with a stronger knowledge of academic subjects and vocational skills. Magnet schools still continue to be models for school improvement plans and provide students with opportunities to succeed in a diverse learning environment.

Within a few years, in locations such as Richmond, Virginia, additional magnet school programs for children with special talents were developed at facilities in locations that parents would have otherwise found undesirable. That effort to both attract voluntary enrollment and achieve the desired racial balance met with considerable success and helped improve the acceptance of farther distances, hardships with transportation for extracurricular activities, and the separation of siblings. Even as districts such as Richmond were released from desegregation court orders, the parental selection of magnet school programs has continued to create more racially diverse schools than would have otherwise been possible. With a wide range of magnet schools available, a suitable program could be found for more children than only the &quot;bright&quot; ones for whom the earliest efforts were directed.

Some 21st-century magnet schools have de-emphasized the racial integration aspects, such as Capital Prep Magnet School, a high school in Hartford, Connecticut. Capital Prep, a year-round school where more than 80% of its students are black and Latino, boasts a near-0% dropout rate; 100% of its 2009 senior class was sent to a four-year college. According to the school&#x27;s principal, the goal is to prepare all of its students for college.

Since coming into fruition, the number of magnet schools has risen dramatically. Over 232 school districts housed magnet school programs in the early 1990s. By the end of the decade, nearly 1,400 magnet schools were operating across the country.

Traditionally, these magnet schools are found in neighborhoods with large minority populations. They advertise their unique educational curricula in order to attract white students who do not live in the surrounding area. In this way, the schools act as a &quot;magnet&quot; pulling out-of-neighborhood students that would otherwise go to a school in their traditional attendance zone.

==Enrollment and curriculum==
Some magnet schools have a competitive entrance process, requiring an entrance examination, interview, or audition. Other magnet schools either select all students who apply, or use a lottery system among students who apply, while others combine elements of competitive entrance and a lottery among applicants.

Most magnet schools concentrate on a particular discipline or area of study, while others (such as International Baccalaureate schools) have a more general focus. Magnet programs may focus on academics (mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering; humanities; social sciences; fine or performing arts) or may focus on technical/vocational/agricultural education.

Access to free transportation is a key component in facilitating racial diversity in magnet schools. According to a survey distributed at the Magnet Schools of America&#x27;s (MSA) 2008 annual meeting, in magnet schools with free transportation services, non-white students comprise almost 33% of the student body, which is higher than the 23% found in magnet schools without such services. Moreover, 11.9% of magnet schools that do not provide transportation are largely one-race, while only 6.4% of magnet schools with the provision of transportation are characterized as one-race schools. Such services are integral in ensuring that potential out-of-neighborhood students have access to these schools of choice. Ultimately, the presence of free transportation contributes to more integrated magnet environments.

Across the country, magnet school application forms assume that its readers are proficient in reading and writing in English, understand the school&#x27;s curriculum, and recognize what kinds of resources are offered to students at that respective school. In diverse urban contexts especially, these assumptions privilege some families over others. Parents who seek out magnet schools tend to be Asian, educated, middle-class, and English-fluent. Thus, in order to break down the racial disparities these schools were intended to dismantle, magnet school programs have to be intentional in not only their outreach efforts, but also how they create the application text itself.

<text>USS &quot;Amberjack&quot; (SS-219) was a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, the first United States Navy ship named for the amberjack.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Amberjack&quot;′s keel was laid by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut, on 15 May 1941. She was launched on 6 March 1942 (sponsored by Mrs. Randall Jacobs), and commissioned on 19 June 1942.

==Service history==
After shakedown training in waters off New London, Connecticut and Newport, Rhode Island, &quot;Amberjack&quot; got underway on 20 July, bound for the Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal in mid-August and reached Pearl Harbor on 20 August. Following training exercises, &quot;Amberjack&quot; got underway for her first war patrol on 3 September. Two days later, she touched at Johnston Island to refuel and, later that day, resumed her voyage to her patrol area between the northeast coast of New Ireland and Bougainville, Solomon Islands.

On 15 September, &quot;Amberjack&quot; was patrolling off Kavieng, New Ireland. Three days later, she made contact with a large Japanese transport escorted by a destroyer, and fired a spread of four torpedoes at the vessels, but none hit. While patrolling in Bougainville Strait on 19 September, the submarine launched two torpedoes at an enemy freighter. The first hit under the target&#x27;s bridge, and the second broke her keel in two. &quot;Amberjack&quot; was credited with having sunk &quot;Shirogane Maru&quot;.

&quot;Amberjack&quot; made her next contact with Japanese shipping on 25 September, spotting a large cruiser escorted by a destroyer. However, before the submarine could get into position for an attack, the destroyer headed toward her and forced her to go deep. Several depth charges were dropped on the submarine, but they inflicted no damage. During the next few days, &quot;Amberjack&quot; reconnoitered Taʻū, Kilinailau, Kapingamarangi, and Ocean Island.

The submarine spotted a Japanese cruiser on the morning of 30 September and launched four torpedoes from her bow tubes. None hit, so she fired another two forward tubes shortly thereafter. These also went wide of the mark, and the cruiser escaped damage. One week later, the submarine was patrolling off Kavieng when she spotted smoke on the horizon. After a Japanese cargo ship sailed into view, &quot;Amberjack&quot; launched two torpedoes. One missed forward and the other hit the target&#x27;s hull forward. The enemy ship was still able to continue under her own power and &quot;Amberjack&quot; took up the pursuit. About one hour later, both sides opened fire with their deck guns but neither was within the range of the other and they broke off the fire. After two more hours of the chase, the submarine fired a slow speed torpedo which hit its target five minutes later. The cargo vessel, later identified as &quot;Senkai Maru&quot;, swung left and seemed to stop. Its bow swung up in the air, the ship took a vertical position, and sank from sight shortly thereafter. Lifeboats carrying the cargo ship&#x27;s survivors were later spotted as the submarine headed for Kavieng.

While patrolling off Kavieng Harbor on 10 October, &quot;Amberjack&quot; spotted Japanese ships in the harbor and launched four torpedoes into the anchorage. One damaged a freighter and another damaged &quot;Tonan Maru II&quot;, (19,262 tons) which was being used to ferry airplanes. The vessel sank in shallow water, but was later salvaged, towed to Japan for repairs, and was returned to service. On 16 October, the submarine headed for Espiritu Santo for repairs to her ballast tanks and arrived there on 19 October. While undergoing repairs, she was assigned the task of hauling aviation gas, bombs, and personnel to Guadalcanal. While en route to the Solomons, her destination was changed to Tulagi. She arrived there on 25 October and unloaded her embarked troops and cargo under the cover of darkness. The next day, she set course for Brisbane, Australia, and reached that port on 30 October.

After a refit alongside and a series of training exercises, &quot;Amberjack&quot; began her second war patrol on 21 November. On the morning of 27 November, the submarine encountered two enemy destroyers which were probably carrying supplies for Japanese forces on Guadalcanal. While launching four torpedoes from her stern tubes, the submarine heard the screws of a third ship crossing ahead of her bow. None of the torpedoes hit their target, and the submarine began to take action to avoid depth charges. Approximately two hours later, all sounds had faded away, and the submarine rose to the surface to look for signs of damage. She spotted nothing so she assumed a new station at the southern end of the eastern entrance to Shortland Harbor.

On 29 November, while on patrol ten miles (16 km) east of the Treasury Islands, &quot;Amberjack&quot; spotted a surfaced Japanese submarine. Before she could set up an attack, however, the enemy vessel rapidly drew away. She again saw a Japanese submarine on 3 December proceeding toward the entrance to Shortland harbor and sent four torpedoes toward the fleeing enemy, but all failed to hit. During the next one and one-half weeks, she made numerous ship contacts but carried out no attacks. On 15 December, the submarine sighted a convoy consisting of four or five ships on a course for Rabaul and launched two torpedoes at a large freighter, one at a small tanker, and one more at a small freighter. However, she apparently inflicted no damage on any of the targets.

Her next contact occurred on 20 December. While patrolling submerged, &quot;Amberjack&quot; began hearing a series of explosions which drew closer and closer. She surfaced and saw two Japanese destroyer escorts, which soon thereafter began raining depth charges on the submarine. Within the space of one minute, six exploded close aboard, shook the vessel considerably, and caused numerous broken light bulbs forward. Some fittings mounted on the overhead were broken off, and several valves were sprung open. However, the submarine suffered no crippling damage and moved on to continue her patrol off the northeast coast of New Ireland.

She spotted another Japanese ship on 3 January 1943, a destroyer which apparently was waiting to rendezvous with a convoy from the Palau Islands. The submarine was unable to attack the ship and, two days later, set a course for Brisbane, Queensland. She reached that port on 11 January and safely concluded her patrol.

Following this patrol, the submarine&#x27;s period of the refit was cut to 12 days due to the urgent need for submarines to patrol enemy-infested waters. She got underway on 24 January but was forced to return to Brisbane for repair of minor leaks which developed during a deep dive. Again departing Brisbane on 26 January, &quot;Amberjack&quot; started her third war patrol in the Solomons area. On 29 January she was directed to pass close to Tetipari Island and then proceed to the northwest and patrol the approaches to Shortland Basin. Orders were radioed on 1 February for her to move north and patrol the western approaches to Buka Passage. Having complied with these orders, &quot;Amberjack&quot; made her first miles southeast of Treasury Island on 1 February, and of sinking a two-masted schooner by gunfire from Buka the afternoon of 3 February 1943. At this time she was ordered to move south along the Buka-Shortland traffic lane and patrol east of Vella Lavella Island.

In a second radio transmission on 4 February, &quot;Amberjack&quot; reported having sunk a 5,000-ton freighter laden with explosives in a two-hour night surface attack that date in which five torpedoes were fired. During this engagement, an officer was slightly wounded in the hand by machine gun fire. Chief Pharmacist&#x27;s Mate Arthur C. Beeman, went to the bridge to assist the officer and was killed by machine gun fire. On 8 February, &quot;Amberjack&quot; was ordered to move to the west side of Ganongga Island and on 10 February, she was directed to keep south of latitude 7°30&#x27;S and to cover the traffic routes from Rabaul and Buka Island to Shortland Basin. On 13 February, &quot;Amberjack&quot; was assigned the entire Rabaul-Buka-Shortland Sea area and told to hunt for traffic.

The last radio transmission received from &quot;Amberjack&quot; was made on 14 February. She related having been forced down the night before by two destroyers, and that she had recovered from the water and taken prisoner an enemy aviator on 13 February. She was ordered north of latitude 6°30&#x27;S, and told to keep hunting for Rabaul traffic.

All further messages to &quot;Amberjack&quot; remained unanswered, and when, by 10 March, she had failed to make her routine report estimating the time of her arrival at base, she was ordered to do so. No reply was received, and she was reported as presumed lost on 22 March 1943.

Reports received from the enemy after the war record an attack which probably sank &quot;Amberjack&quot;. On 16 February 1943, Japanese torpedo boat &quot;Hiyodori&quot; and &quot;Sub Chaser Number 18&quot; attacked a U.S. submarine with nine depth charges at about . An escorting patrol plane had previously attacked the submarine. A large amount of heavy oil and &quot;parts of the hull&quot; came to the surface. This attack is believed to have sunk &quot;Amberjack&quot;. However, no final conclusions can be drawn, since was lost in the same area at about the same time. From the evidence available, it is considered most likely that the attack of 16 February sank &quot;Amberjack&quot;, but if she did survive this attack, any one of the attacks and sightings thought to have been made on &quot;Grampus&quot; might have been made on &quot;Amberjack&quot;.

==Awards==
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with three battle stars for World War II service

&quot;Amberjack&quot; received credit for sinking three ships totaling of 28,600 tons and damaging two ships totaling 14,000 tons.

==Legacy==
The enlisted men&#x27;s recreation center at Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor, is named for Chief Pharmacist&#x27;s Mate Arthur C. Beeman, who was killed in the gun battle of 4 February 1943.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Amberjack&quot; appears in the Harry Turtledove alternate history novel &quot;Days of Infamy&quot;, surfacing briefly during a deployment around Japanese-occupied Hawaii.

<text>USS &quot;Amberjack&quot; (SS-522), a WWII-era &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the second submarine of the United States Navy named for the amberjack, a vigorous sport fish found in the western Atlantic from New England to Brazil.

== Commissioning ==
Her keel was laid down by the Boston Naval Shipyard of Boston, Massachusetts, on 8 February 1944. She was launched on 15 December 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Walter E. Lang, Jr., and commissioned on 4 March 1946.

== Shakedown and first conversion ==
Following shakedown training in the West Indies and in the Gulf of Mexico, &quot;Amberjack&quot; reported on 17 June for duty with SubRon8. Operating out of the Submarine Base, New London, Connecticut, she conducted training missions in the North Atlantic, and, in November 1946, made a cruise above the Arctic Circle. In January 1947, the submarine entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for extensive modifications and thereafter spent about a year undergoing a Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) conversion during which her hull and sail were streamlined and additional batteries and a snorkel were installed to increase her submerged speed endurance, and maneuverability. In January 1948, she reported for duty with SubRon4 based at Key West, Florida. She operated along the east coast and in the West Indies for a little more than 11 years. Her schedule included the development of tactics and independent ship exercises, type training, periodic overhauls, and fleet exercises. During this period, she also visited numerous Caribbean Sea ports. In July 1952, &quot;Amberjack&quot; was transferred to the newly established SubRon12, though she remained based at Key West and her employment continued as before.

== European and NATO exercises ==
Early in August 1959, after more than 11 years of operations out of Key West, the submarine&#x27;s home port was changed to Charleston, South Carolina. She arrived there on 8 August and reported for duty with her former squadron, SubRon4. While working out of her new home port, &quot;Amberjack&quot;&#x27;s operations remained much as they had been before with one significant difference: she began making deployments to European waters. In August, September and October 1960, the submarine participated in a NATO exercise before making a week-long port visit to Portsmouth, England. She returned to Charleston late in October and resumed her normal duties. Between May and September 1961, the warship deployed to the Mediterranean Sea for duty in the Sixth Fleet. After a three-year interlude operating along the east coast and in the West Indies, &quot;Amberjack&quot; made another Mediterranean cruise between 7 July and 1 November 1964. She spent the ensuing 29 months working out of Charleston. In 1967, the submarine made a three-month deployment to the Mediterranean between 23 April and 24 July. On 2 September 1969, following another 25 months of operations along the US east coast and in the West Indies, she embarked upon her last deployment from Charleston in European waters during which she participated in another NATO exercise with units of the British, Canadian, and Dutch navies. At the conclusion of the exercise, &quot;Amberjack&quot; visited a number of ports in northern Europe before returning to Charleston on 12 December 1969.

===USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident===

There is speculation amongst survivors of the 1967 Israeli attack on the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; and their supporters that a U.S. Navy submarine observed and filmed the attack through their periscope. The working theory is that the submarine was either the &quot;Amberjack&quot; or the USS &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot;. Seeing how the &quot;Amberjack&quot; was on a 3-month deployment to the eastern Mediterranean Sea to reconnoiter Egypt, this would mean she could, in theory, have been in the vicinity of the attack when it occurred. There is no confirmation of this theory and it remains speculative.

In 1988, the LBJ Presidential Library declassified and released a document from the &quot;Liberty&quot; archive with the “Top Secret—Eyes Only” security caveat (Document #12C sanitized and released 21DEC88 under review case 86–199). This “Memorandum for the Record” dated April 10, 1967 reported a briefing of the “303 Committee” by General Ralph D. Steakley. According to the memo, General Steakley “briefed the committee on a sensitive DOD project known as FRONTLET 615,” which is identified in a handwritten note on the original memorandum as “submarine within U.A.R. waters.” Further Freedom of Information Act requests returned no information on any project called “FRONTLET 615.” This has lent credence to the theory that a U.S. Navy submarine was present during the attack.

In February 1997, a senior member of the crew of the &quot;Amberjack&quot; told &quot;Liberty&quot; survivor James Ennes that he had watched the attack through the periscope and took pictures. When contacted, 4 crewmen stated that they were so close to the &quot;Liberty&quot; when it came under attack that some of the crew believed that the &quot;Amberjack&quot; herself was under attack by depth charges. Captain August Hubal, the commanding officer of the &quot;Amberjack&quot; at the time of the attack, insisted that the vessel was 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the &quot;Liberty&quot;. When told the crew believed they were closer, he replied “They must be mistaken.” On July 2, 2003, as a result of a lawsuit by Joel Leyden (on behalf of the Israel News Agency) using the Freedom of Information Act to request any evidence relating to the attack that the &quot;Amberjack&quot; may have gathered by means of its periscope, the National Security Agency stated that there had been “no radio intercepts made by the U.S. submarine &quot;Amberjack&quot;.” James Ennes believes that if the submarine photography does exist, it should show that the &quot;Liberty’s&quot; flag was clearly visible to the attacking aircraft and torpedo boats, which would directly contradict the Israeli narrative of the attack.

== End of Service ==
On 9 July 1970, &quot;Amberjack&quot; arrived in her new home port, Key West, Florida, her base for the remainder of her service in the United States Navy. She made her last deployment to the Mediterranean between 27 November 1972, and 30 March 1973. On 17 October 1973, &quot;Amberjack&quot; was decommissioned at Key West, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, was transferred to the Brazilian Navy, and was commissioned as &quot;Ceará&quot; (S-14).

<text>Eyjafjörður (, &quot;Island Fjord&quot;) is one of the longest fjords in Iceland. It is located in the central north of the country. Situated by the fjord is the country&#x27;s fourth most populous municipality, Akureyri.

==Physical geography==
The fjord is long and narrow and measures 60 km from its head to its mouth. Its greatest width is 15 km between Ólafsfjörður and Gjögurtá at the fjord&#x27;s mouth, but for the greater part of its length it is mostly between 5–10 km wide.

The fjord is surrounded by hills and mountains on both sides; the mountains are taller on the west side, in the mountain range of the Tröllaskagi peninsula. In the outer part of the fjord there are no lowlands along the coast as the steep hills roll directly into the sea. Further south in the fjord there are strips of lowland along both coasts; these are wider on the west side.

Several valleys lead from Eyjafjörður: most of them to the west, where the two most significant are Hörgárdalur and Svarfaðardalur. Dalsmynni is the only valley on the east side. However the largest valley in the area is Eyjafjarðardalur, which runs directly south from the fjord itself. It is about 50 km long, and is home to one of Iceland&#x27;s largest agricultural regions.

Several rivers flow into Eyjafjörður: the most significant are the Eyjafjarðará, Hörgá (whose valleys are named above), and Fnjóská (which flows into the fjord via Dalsmynni).

The island of Hrísey in the middle of Eyjafjörður is the second largest island off the coast of Iceland and often referred to as &quot;The Pearl of Eyjafjörður&quot;.

Eyjafjörður contains a number of hydrothermal vents in shallow (20 to 65 metres) water, namely the Strýtan vent field, with cones rising up to 20 metres below the water surface. As they are not visible on the surface, when the Icelandic Coast Guard did not detect the vent chimneys, they declared the vents non-existent in 1987. In 1997 divers Erlendur Bogason and Árni Halldósson and German research submersible HOV &quot;JAGO&quot; separately explored them and identified them as a real geologic feature. The vent field was designated as an Icelandic protected preserve in 2001.

==Settlements==
The largest town by far is Akureyri; other settlements in the region are: Dalvík (the only other settlement with over 1,000 inhabitants), Ólafsfjörður, Hrísey, Árskógssandur, Hauganes, Hjalteyri, Hrafnagil, Svalbarðseyri and Grenivík. Most of these settlements base their livelihood on fisheries and agriculture, but Akureyri is also a service center and the site of a growing university.

<doc id="412255" wikidata="Q481347" url="?curid=412255" title="Wilhelm Hieronymus Pachelbel">
<text>Wilhelm Hieronymus Pachelbel (baptized – 6 June 1764) was a German composer and organist, the elder son of Johann Pachelbel.

== Life ==
He was born in Erfurt and spent the first four years of his life there. The Pachelbel family moved to Stuttgart in 1690, then, fleeing from the War of the Grand Alliance, to Gotha in 1692, and finally to Nuremberg in 1695. Wilhelm Hieronymus almost certainly received his first music education from his father. By age 14 he was proficient enough on the keyboard to receive special commendation from the town council of Nuremberg. After leaving Nuremberg, he worked as organist at Fürth and his native Erfurt&#x27;s Predigerkirche, before returning and taking the position at St. Jakob in 1706, shortly before his father&#x27;s death. That same year J.S. Richter succeeded Johann Pachelbel at the city&#x27;s largest church, Sebalduskirche; Wilhelm Hieronymus took Richter&#x27;s former position at St. Egidienkirche. He remained in Nuremberg for the rest of his life, working at St. Egidien until 1719, when Richter died and Wilhelm Hieronymus was chosen to succeed him at Sebalduskirche.

Only seven pieces by Wilhelm Hieronymus survive, all of them for keyboard. While three show the influence of his father (the &quot;Toccata in G major&quot;, the chorale partita on &quot;O Lamm Gottes, unschuldig&quot;, and the fugal prelude to &quot;Fantasia super Meine Seele, lass es gehen&quot;), in the remaining works Pachelbel shows a preference for technique that is harmonically and contrapuntally simpler, influenced by the emerging Classical style. Two such pieces were published by Pachelbel himself.

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Dudley is a metropolitan borough of West Midlands, England. It was created in 1974 following the Local Government Act 1972, through a merger of the existing Dudley County Borough with the municipal boroughs of Stourbridge and Halesowen. 

The borough&#x27;s main settlement is Dudley but it also includes the outlying towns of Brierley Hill, Halesowen, Kingswinford, Lye, Netherton, Sedgley, and Stourbridge.

The borough borders Sandwell to the east, the city of Birmingham to the south east, Bromsgrove to the south in Worcestershire, South Staffordshire District to the west, and the city of Wolverhampton to the north.

==History==
The Metropolitan Borough of Dudley was created in 1974 from the existing boroughs of Dudley, the Municipal Borough of Stourbridge and the Municipal Borough of Halesowen. This followed an earlier reorganisation in 1966, as per the provisions of the Local Government Act 1958, which saw an expansion of the three boroughs from the abolition of the surrounding urban districts of Amblecote, Brierley Hill, Coseley, and Sedgley; and the municipal boroughs of Tipton, Oldbury, and Rowley Regis.

Initially the borough had a two-tier system of local government, with the borough council sharing power with the West Midlands County Council. In 1986 metropolitan county councils were abolished under the Local Government Act 1985, and Dudley effectively became a unitary authority.

==Government==
Dudley Council has its main offices in Dudley town centre (where Dudley Council House is located), along with additional smaller offices throughout the borough. The council is made up of 72 councillors representing 24 wards.

On its formation in 1974, the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley was controlled by the Labour Party. Since then the controlling party has frequently changed, sometimes with no political party having a clear majority.

Following the local elections in May 2024 the council returned to no overall control. 

=== Mayor ===
The Mayor of the Borough acts as the Borough&#x27;s first citizen attending many civic and ceremonial functions to represent the Council. They are elected at the Annual Meeting of the Council and serves for the whole of the Municipal Year until the next Annual Meeting. 

As part of the West Midlands Combined Authority, Dudley is also served by the Mayor of the West Midlands. 

===Wards===
The 24 wards of the Dudley Borough are each represented by 3 councillors. 
=== Demography ===
At the 2021 Census, the total population of Dudley Metropolitan Borough was 323,488, an increase of 10,563 from the 2011 Census. The population density was 3,320.4 residents per square km compared to the West Midlands region population density was 457.8 residents per square km.

84.9% of Dudley&#x27;s population identified as White, with 82.4% identifying as White British, 0.3% as White Irish, and 2.1% as Other White. The second largest ethnic group was Asian and British Asian, making up 8.4% of the population (an increase from 2011 where the figure was 6.1%). Black and Black British people comprised 2.5% of the population of the borough (an increase from 2011 where the figure was 1.5%). 

Statistics on religious beliefs show that 49.3% of the population identify as Christian (65.3% in 2011), with the second largest religious group being Muslim, at 6.2% (4.1% in 2011). 36% identified as having no religion.

Unemployment amongst those aged 16 and over in the borough stood at 3.8%, slightly higher than the national average of 3.5%. 41.1% of those aged 16 and over were economically inactive, consisting of 24.3% retired, 5.2% looking after homes or family, 4.5% long-term sick or disabled, 4.2% students and 3.0% other economically inactive.

==Economy==
A part of the Black Country, Dudley traditionally has been an industrial centre of manufacturing, quarrying, and mining, although this has declined in more recent years, with a shift in focus towards the service sector (accounting for 79.1% of employment) and tourism. Despite this, there are still numerous large industrial sites around the borough, such as the Pensnett Trading Estate, with the manufacturing industries making up 15.3% of employment.

Tourism is of increasing importance to the local economy, with approximately 6,600 people employed within the sector. Attractions such as the Black Country Living Museum and Dudley Zoo bring in hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.The Merry Hill Shopping Centre in Brierley Hill is one of the largest shopping centres in the UK and is the main retail centre of the borough, with an average of 23.5 million visitors a year, and houses branches of several large retailers including Primark, Marks &amp; Spencer, and Next.

Other large employers in the borough include JCDecaux UK, which has its Birmingham area office in Halesowen, Rentokil Initial, and Midtherm Engineering.

== Tourism and visitor economy ==
Dudley borough has an increasing tourism offer, with attractions such as the Black Country Geopark being recognised in 2020 and the Stourbridge Glass Museum due to open in 2022. Tourism and the visitor economy is an important sector to the borough, supporting approximately 8,000 jobs.

Many of the borough&#x27;s tourist attractions draw on the industrial heritage of the area. For example, the Red House Glass Cone is an original structure from the 18th Century glass making industry in Stourbridge. The site includes designer-maker studios, galleries and hot glass studio. The Stourbridge Glass Quarter locality is also home to The Lace Guild, Glasshouse Heritage Centre and hosts the International Festival of Glass every 2 years, most recently in 2019 with the 2021 festival postponed to 2022 due to the covid-19 pandemic.  

The Caste Hill area of Dudley is also a hub of visitor attractions including the Black Country Living Museum and the Canal and Tunnel Trust. Dudley Zoological Gardens, which is also in this area, is the second most visited paid visitor attraction in the West Midlands. The Archives and Local History Centre is now also the home of the council run Dudley Museum. The museum is also the headquarters of the Black Country Geopark.

Along with sites recognised as part of the Geopark, the borough has seven nature reserves and many parks contributing to its green spaces. In 2021, the Green Flag award was obtained by seven of the boroughs sites (Buffery Park, Huntingtree Park, Mary Stevens Park, Priory Park, The Leasowes, Wrens Nest National Nature Reserve and Saltwells National Nature Reserve). Mary Stevens Park and Priory Park were also awarded Green Heritage Site status, with Abbey Road Allotments recognised with a Green Flag Community Award.

Despite not being in the bounds of Dudley borough, Himley Hall and Park is owned and run by Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council. In addition to the 180 acres of ‘Capability’ Brown landscaped parkland, the Hall has a gallery exhibition space and is a wedding venue.

==Regeneration==
Large public and private sector developments have taken place in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley since its creation in 1974.

The closure of Round Oak Steelworks in December 1982 paved the way for the creation of the Merry Hill Shopping Centre on nearby farmland between 1985 and 1989. The Waterfront leisure and commercial complex was developed on the site of the steelworks itself between 1989 and 1995.

Pensnett Trading Estate in Kingswinford has been developed since the 1960s for mostly light industry and services.

A major redevelopment of Halesowen town centre took place in 2007/08, when the bus station was rebuilt and a section of the 1960s shopping area demolished to make way for a new Asda superstore.

A similar redevelopment of Stourbridge town centre in 2011/12 saw most of the Crown Centre completely rebuilt to incorporate a new Tesco superstore.

There are currently several major regeneration projects throughout the borough. Significant infrastructure projects include the new Dudley Transport Interchange and the Wednesbury to Brierley Hill West Midlands Metro extension.  The 11km metro extension will connect Dudley, Merry Hill and Brierley Hill with the metro network and so to the proposed HS2 line. The first phase to Dudley town centre is expected to open for passenger services in 2024. The second phase will then extend to Brierley Hill, terminating in Cottage Street in the town centre following an additional £60million funding from central government. 

Regeneration projects around the Castle Hill area are combining innovation and education. The Black Country and Marches Institute of Technology opened in September 2021 and focuses delivery on higher level courses in manufacturing and engineering, medical engineering, modern construction methodologies and digital technologies. The Very Light Rail (VLR) National Innovation Centre will provide a research facility for the development of VLR technologies and projects. The centre will redevelop the former Dudley Railway Station and reconnect the town with the National Rail Network.

The DY5 Business and Innovation Enterprise Zone was launched in 2017 with the ambition to create 7,000 new jobs over 25 years. The zone is centred around the Brierley Hill area.

The Dudley Townscape Heritage programme is on ongoing programme of work improving historical buildings in Dudley town centre. Phase 1 ran from 2008-2015, phase 2 from 2017-2023. Phase 2 started following a National Lottery Heritage Fund grant of £1.2 million. As part of the programme historic buildings were identified, repaired or restored. Heritage trails and open days were also developed. In addition, further development of the former Dudley Museum and Art Gallery site has been proposed as part of a £4million scheme. The former Sessions Court in the same complext of buildings been converted into Brookes Bistro restaurant. Named for Brooke Robinson who was a former MP and coroner for Dudley and left a bequest which led to the building for the former Museum and Art Gallery, Town Hall and Coroners Court.

== Housing ==
Relatively little new council housing has been built in the borough since the early 1980s, with almost all of the new social housing developments since then being built by housing associations. Most of the older private housing in the borough has been renovated rather than demolished during this time. However, there have been a number of redevelopment programmes involving 20th century council housing. In July 1999, four of the borough&#x27;s tower blocks (two at Eve Hill in Dudley and two at Tanhouse in Halesowen) were demolished on consecutive weekends in controlled explosions. Two years later, two more tower blocks at Queens Cross in Dudley were demolished using the same method. Four tower blocks in Netherton are scheduled for demolition in 2017/18. In 2009, 266 homes on the predominantly 1930s Priory Estate in Dudley were demolished and the land later redeveloped with new housing. In the mid-1990s, the neighbouring Wren&#x27;s Nest Estate underwent extensive refurbishment as well as improved community facilities in a multimillion-pound project funded by the European Single Budget. Four blocks of low-rise flats on the estate were demolished as part of the regeneration.

Since 2017 small developments of council housing have been built, including bungalows, housing and low-rise flats. Some properties have been designed to accommodate those with specific physical needs or those in need of supported living. The homes have been built across the borough (Brierley Hill, Coseley, Dudley, Halesowen, Kingswinford, Lower Gornal, Sedgley and Stourbridge). During this period Dudley Council have also built a number of homes for private sale.

In November 2021 Dudley Council was named homebuilder of the year (organisations with 16,000 homes or more category) at the Inside Housing UK Housing Awards. 

==Education==
===Tertiary education===
There are two further education colleges in the Dudley Borough: Dudley College of Technology, Halesowen College. The borough is also home to the King Edward VI sixth form college in Stourbridge, originally a grammar school established in 1552, converting to a sixth form centre in 1976. A small number of secondary schools in the borough offer sixth form facilities, while several others did so until the beginning of the 1990s when the local authority decided to concentrate post-16 education in further education colleges.

In March 2011 Eton College and Star Academies announced their intention to open one of three sixth form colleges in Dudley, subject to funding through the Department for Education’s Free Schools Programme.

Since the University of Wolverhampton closed its Dudley campus in 2002, the metropolitan borough is the largest district in the UK without its own university. Several projects in the Castle Hill area of the Dudley are now linking with local universities. The Black Country &amp; Marches Institute of Technology opened in September 2021, with a focus on higher level engineering courses, it partners Dudley College of Technology, University of Wolverhampton, University of Worcester, In-Comm Training Services Limited and Avensys UK Limited. A Higher Education Centre for Health &amp; Care is proposed as a partnership between Dudley College of Technology and University of Worcester and expected to be open for Autumn 2024.

===Primary and secondary education===
There are 104 Dudley Council schools: 78 Primary, 40 of which include a Nursery Unit (24 Primary Academy); 19 Secondary (of which 15 are Secondary Academy Schools) and 7 Special Schools. Pupils transfer to secondary school at the age of 11, although between 1972 and 1990 pupils in the north of borough transferred to secondary school at the age of 12, and from 1972 to 1982 there was a three-tier education system in Halesowen where pupils entered first school at 5, middle school at 9 and secondary school at 13.

The borough had well over 30 secondary schools on its creation, although this was quickly reduced as a result of the introduction of the comprehensive system a year later, which resulted in a number of schools being merged or closed.

By September 1990, however, the number of secondary schools in the borough had fallen to 22 as a result of the closure of Gilbert Claughton and Mons Hill Schools and the merger of High Park and Longlands Schools in Stourbridge to form Ridgewood High. A year earlier, Castle High had been formed in the town centre of Dudley from a merger of The Dudley School and Blue Coat School; this new school also took in some of the former Gilbert Claughton and Mons Hill pupils. The 1980s had also seen the closure of some the borough&#x27;s less popular and smaller primary schools, with the older buildings mostly being demolished and the more modern ones being converted for community use.

The closure of Cradley High School in Halesowen in July 2008 saw the number of secondary schools in the borough fall to 21, dropping to 20 with the closure of Pensnett High School in July 2012, and to 19 when the Coseley School closed five years later.

When the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley was formed, many primary schools were existed as separate infant and junior or first and middle schools, but by 1990 virtually all of the separate schools had been merged to create full circle primary schools, the last separate infant and junior schools to merge being Red Hall in Lower Gornal in January 1997.

There are no grammar schools in the borough, with all state schools being comprehensive, a system which has been universal in the borough since the mid-1970s. The former grammar schools in the borough were Dudley&#x27;s Boys Grammar and Girls High Schools (merged with Park Secondary Modern School in 1975 to form The Dudley School, which in turn merged with The Blue Coat School to form Castle High in 1989), Sir Gilbert Claughton Grammar School in Dudley (which adopted comprehensive status in 1975 before closing in 1990), Brierley Hill Grammar School (actually situated in Kingswinford; it has been known as the Crestwood School since adopting comprehensive status), King Edward VI Boys Grammar School in Stourbridge (which is now a mixed sixth form college), Stourbridge Girls High School (which merged with the Boys Grammar School and Valley Road Secondary Modern School to form Redhill School), Halesowen Grammar School (which merged with Halesowen Technical School to form Earls High School) and High Arcal Grammar School in Sedgley (which survived as a comprehensive school).

The sole independent school in the borough is the Elmfield Rudolf Steiner School in Stourbridge, which follows the Steiner Waldorf curriculum.

The Old Swinford Hospital school in Stourbridge is one of only 34 state-funded boarding schools in England, with education being funded by the local education authority (LEA).

==Healthcare==
The main NHS hospital serving the borough is Russells Hall Hospital, situated to the south of Dudley town centre. Following a major expansion of the hospital in 2005, all inpatient services were transferred to the site from smaller hospitals around the borough, resulting in the closure of Wordsley Hospital, and the downgrading of the Guest Hospital and Corbett hospitals into outpatient centres.

Psychiatric care is offered at the Bushey Fields Hospital, located adjacent to Russells Hall Hospital.

<text>In the mathematical field of differential geometry, a Cartan connection is a flexible generalization of the notion of an affine connection. It may also be regarded as a specialization of the general concept of a principal connection, in which the geometry of the principal bundle is tied to the geometry of the base manifold using a solder form. Cartan connections describe the geometry of manifolds modelled on homogeneous spaces.

The theory of Cartan connections was developed by Élie Cartan, as part of (and a way of formulating) his method of moving frames (repère mobile). The main idea is to develop a suitable notion of the connection forms and curvature using moving frames adapted to the particular geometrical problem at hand. In relativity or Riemannian geometry, orthonormal frames are used to obtain a description of the Levi-Civita connection as a Cartan connection. For Lie groups, Maurer–Cartan frames are used to view the Maurer–Cartan form of the group as a Cartan connection.

Cartan reformulated the differential geometry of (pseudo) Riemannian geometry, as well as the differential geometry of manifolds equipped with some non-metric structure, including Lie groups and homogeneous spaces. The term &#x27;Cartan connection&#x27; most often refers to Cartan&#x27;s formulation of a (pseudo-)Riemannian, affine, projective, or conformal connection. Although these are the most commonly used Cartan connections, they are special cases of a more general concept.

Cartan&#x27;s approach seems at first to be coordinate dependent because of the choice of frames it involves. However, it is not, and the notion can be described precisely using the language of principal bundles. Cartan connections induce covariant derivatives and other differential operators on certain associated bundles, hence a notion of parallel transport. They have many applications in geometry and physics: see the method of moving frames, Cartan formalism and Einstein–Cartan theory for some examples.

==Introduction==

At its roots, geometry consists of a notion of &quot;congruence&quot; between different objects in a space. In the late 19th century, notions of congruence were typically supplied by the action of a Lie group on space. Lie groups generally act quite rigidly, and so a Cartan geometry is a generalization of this notion of congruence to allow for curvature to be present. The &quot;flat&quot; Cartan geometries—those with zero curvature—are locally equivalent to homogeneous spaces, hence geometries in the sense of Klein.

A Klein geometry consists of a Lie group &quot;G&quot; together with a Lie subgroup &quot;H&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. Together &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; determine a homogeneous space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;, on which the group &quot;G&quot; acts by left-translation. Klein&#x27;s aim was then to study objects living on the homogeneous space which were &quot;congruent&quot; by the action of &quot;G&quot;. A Cartan geometry extends the notion of a Klein geometry by attaching to each point of a manifold a copy of a Klein geometry, and to regard this copy as &quot;tangent&quot; to the manifold. Thus the geometry of the manifold is &quot;infinitesimally&quot; identical to that of the Klein geometry, but globally can be quite different. In particular, Cartan geometries no longer have a well-defined action of &quot;G&quot; on them. However, a Cartan connection supplies a way of connecting the infinitesimal model spaces within the manifold by means of parallel transport.

===Motivation===

Consider a smooth surface &quot;S&quot; in 3-dimensional Euclidean space R3. Near to any point, &quot;S&quot; can be approximated by its tangent plane at that point, which is an affine subspace of Euclidean space. The affine subspaces are &quot;model&quot; surfaces—they are the simplest surfaces in R3, and are homogeneous under the Euclidean group of the plane, hence they are &quot;Klein geometries&quot; in the sense of Felix Klein&#x27;s Erlangen programme. Every smooth surface &quot;S&quot; has a unique affine plane tangent to it at each point. The family of all such planes in R3, one attached to each point of &quot;S&quot;, is called the congruence of tangent planes. A tangent plane can be &quot;rolled&quot; along &quot;S&quot;, and as it does so the point of contact traces out a curve on &quot;S&quot;. Conversely, given a curve on &quot;S&quot;, the tangent plane can be rolled along that curve. This provides a way to identify the tangent planes at different points along the curve by affine (in fact Euclidean) transformations, and is an example of a Cartan connection called an affine connection.

Another example is obtained by replacing the planes, as model surfaces, by spheres, which are homogeneous under the Möbius group of conformal transformations. There is no longer a unique sphere tangent to a smooth surface &quot;S&quot; at each point, since the radius of the sphere is undetermined. This can be fixed by supposing that the sphere has the same mean curvature as &quot;S&quot; at the point of contact. Such spheres can again be rolled along curves on &quot;S&quot;, and this equips &quot;S&quot; with another type of Cartan connection called a conformal connection.

Differential geometers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were very interested in using model families such as planes or spheres to describe the geometry of surfaces. A family of model spaces attached to each point of a surface &quot;S&quot; is called a congruence: in the previous examples there is a canonical choice of such a congruence. A Cartan connection provides an identification between the model spaces in the congruence along any curve in &quot;S&quot;. An important feature of these identifications is that the point of contact of the model space with &quot;S&quot; &quot;always moves&quot; with the curve. This generic condition is characteristic of Cartan connections.

In the modern treatment of affine connections, the point of contact is viewed as the &quot;origin&quot; in the tangent plane (which is then a vector space), and the movement of the origin is corrected by a translation, and so Cartan connections are not needed. However, there is no canonical way to do this in general: in particular for the conformal connection of a sphere congruence, it is not possible to separate the motion of the point of contact from the rest of the motion in a natural way.

In both of these examples the model space is a homogeneous space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;.
* In the first case, &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; is the affine plane, with &quot;G&quot; = Aff(R2) the affine group of the plane, and &quot;H&quot; = GL(2) the corresponding general linear group.
* In the second case, &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; is the conformal (or celestial) sphere, with &quot;G&quot; = O&quot;+&quot;(3,1) the (orthochronous) Lorentz group, and &quot;H&quot; the stabilizer of a null line in R3,1.
The Cartan geometry of &quot;S&quot; consists of a copy of the model space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; at each point of &quot;S&quot; (with a marked point of contact) together with a notion of &quot;parallel transport&quot; along curves which identifies these copies using elements of &quot;G&quot;. This notion of parallel transport is generic in the intuitive sense that the point of contact always moves along the curve.

In general, let &quot;G&quot; be a group with a subgroup &quot;H&quot;, and &quot;M&quot; a manifold of the same dimension as &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;. Then, roughly speaking, a Cartan connection on &quot;M&quot; is a &quot;G&quot;-connection which is generic with respect to a reduction to &quot;H&quot;.

===Affine connections===

An affine connection on a manifold &quot;M&quot; is a connection on the frame bundle (principal bundle) of &quot;M&quot; (or equivalently, a connection on the tangent bundle (vector bundle) of &quot;M&quot;). A key aspect of the Cartan connection point of view is to elaborate this notion in the context of principal bundles (which could be called the &quot;general or abstract theory of frames&quot;).

Let &quot;H&quot; be a Lie group, formula_1 its Lie algebra. Then a principal &quot;H&quot;-bundle is a fiber bundle &quot;P&quot; over &quot;M&quot; with a smooth action of &quot;H&quot; on &quot;P&quot; which is free and transitive on the fibers. Thus &quot;P&quot; is a smooth manifold with a smooth map &quot;π&quot;: &quot;P&quot; → &quot;M&quot; which looks &quot;locally&quot; like the trivial bundle &quot;M&quot; × &quot;H&quot; → &quot;M&quot;. The frame bundle of &quot;M&quot; is a principal GL(&quot;n&quot;)-bundle, while if &quot;M&quot; is a Riemannian manifold, then the orthonormal frame bundle is a principal O(&quot;n&quot;)-bundle.

Let &quot;R&quot;&quot;h&quot; denote the (right) action of &quot;h&quot; ∈ H on &quot;P&quot;. The derivative of this action defines a vertical vector field on &quot;P&quot; for each element &quot;ξ&quot; of formula_1: if &quot;h&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is a 1-parameter subgroup with &quot;h&quot;(0)=&quot;e&quot; (the identity element) and &quot;h&quot; &#x27;(&quot;0&quot;)=&quot;ξ&quot;, then the corresponding vertical vector field is
:formula_3

A principal &quot;H&quot;-connection on &quot;P&quot; is a 1-form formula_4 on &quot;P&quot;,
with values in the Lie algebra formula_1 of &quot;H&quot;, such that
# formula_6
# for any formula_7, &quot;ω&quot;(&quot;X&quot;&quot;ξ&quot;) = &quot;ξ&quot; (identically on &quot;P&quot;).

The intuitive idea is that &quot;ω&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) provides a &quot;vertical component&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, using the isomorphism of the fibers of &quot;π&quot; with &quot;H&quot; to identify vertical vectors with elements of formula_1.

Frame bundles have additional structure called the solder form, which can be used to extend a principal connection on &quot;P&quot; to a trivialization of the tangent bundle of &quot;P&quot; called an absolute parallelism.

In general, suppose that &quot;M&quot; has dimension &quot;n&quot; and &quot;H&quot; acts on R&quot;n&quot; (this could be any &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real vector space). A solder form on a principal &quot;H&quot;-bundle &quot;P&quot; over &quot;M&quot; is an R&quot;n&quot;-valued 1-form &quot;θ&quot;: T&quot;P&quot; → R&quot;n&quot; which is horizontal and equivariant so that it induces a bundle homomorphism from T&quot;M&quot; to the associated bundle &quot;P&quot; ×&quot;H&quot; R&quot;n&quot;. This is furthermore required to be a bundle isomorphism. Frame bundles have a (canonical or tautological) solder form which sends a tangent vector &quot;X&quot; ∈ T&quot;p&quot;&quot;P&quot; to the coordinates of d&quot;π&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) ∈ T&quot;π&quot;(&quot;p&quot;)&quot;M&quot; with respect to the frame &quot;p&quot;.

The pair (&quot;ω&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;) (a principal connection and a solder form) defines a 1-form &quot;η&quot; on &quot;P&quot;, with values in the Lie algebra formula_9 of the semidirect product &quot;G&quot; of &quot;H&quot; with R&quot;n&quot;, which provides an isomorphism of each tangent space T&quot;p&quot;&quot;P&quot; with formula_9. It induces a principal connection &quot;α&quot; on the associated principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle &quot;P&quot; ×&quot;H&quot; &quot;G&quot;. This is a Cartan connection.

Cartan connections generalize affine connections in two ways.
* The action of &quot;H&quot; on R&quot;n&quot; need not be effective. This allows, for example, the theory to include spin connections, in which &quot;H&quot; is the spin group Spin(&quot;n&quot;) rather than the orthogonal group O(&quot;n&quot;).
* The group &quot;G&quot; need not be a semidirect product of &quot;H&quot; with R&quot;n&quot;.

===Klein geometries as model spaces===

Klein&#x27;s Erlangen programme suggested that geometry could be regarded as a study of homogeneous spaces: in particular, it is the study of the many geometries of interest to geometers of 19th century (and earlier). A Klein geometry consisted of a space, along with a law for motion within the space (analogous to the Euclidean transformations of classical Euclidean geometry) expressed as a Lie group of transformations. These generalized spaces turn out to be homogeneous smooth manifolds diffeomorphic to the quotient space of a Lie group by a Lie subgroup. The extra differential structure that these homogeneous spaces possess allows one to study and generalize their geometry using calculus.

The general approach of Cartan is to begin with such a &quot;smooth Klein geometry&quot;, given by a Lie group &quot;G&quot; and a Lie subgroup &quot;H&quot;, with associated Lie algebras formula_9 and formula_1, respectively. Let &quot;P&quot; be the underlying principal homogeneous space of &quot;G&quot;. A Klein geometry is the homogeneous space given by the quotient &quot;P&quot;/&quot;H&quot; of &quot;P&quot; by the right action of &quot;H&quot;. There is a right &quot;H&quot;-action on the fibres of the canonical projection
:&quot;π&quot;: &quot;P&quot; → &quot;P&quot;/&quot;H&quot;
given by &quot;R&quot;&quot;h&quot;&quot;g&quot; = &quot;gh&quot;. Moreover, each fibre of &quot;π&quot; is a copy of &quot;H&quot;. &quot;P&quot; has the structure of a principal &quot;H&quot;-bundle over &quot;P&quot;/&quot;H&quot;.

A vector field &quot;X&quot; on &quot;P&quot; is &quot;vertical&quot; if d&quot;π&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = 0. Any &quot;ξ&quot; ∈ formula_13 gives rise to a canonical vertical vector field &quot;X&quot;&quot;ξ&quot; by taking the derivative of the right action of the 1-parameter subgroup of &quot;H&quot; associated to ξ. The Maurer-Cartan form &quot;η&quot; of &quot;P&quot; is the formula_9-valued one-form on &quot;P&quot; which identifies each tangent space with the Lie algebra. It has the following properties:

# Ad(&quot;h&quot;) &quot;R&quot;&quot;h&quot;*&quot;η&quot; = &quot;η&quot; for all &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;
# &quot;η&quot;(&quot;X&quot;&quot;ξ&quot;) = &quot;ξ&quot; for all &quot;ξ&quot; in formula_1
# for all &quot;g&quot;∈&quot;P&quot;, &quot;η&quot; restricts a linear isomorphism of T&quot;g&quot;&quot;P&quot; with formula_9 (η is an absolute parallelism on &quot;P&quot;).

In addition to these properties, &quot;η&quot; satisfies the structure (or structural) equation
: formula_17

Conversely, one can show that given a manifold &quot;M&quot; and a principal &quot;H&quot;-bundle &quot;P&quot; over &quot;M&quot;, and a 1-form &quot;η&quot; with these properties, then &quot;P&quot; is locally isomorphic as an &quot;H&quot;-bundle to the principal homogeneous bundle &quot;G&quot;→&quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;. The structure equation is the integrability condition for the existence of such a local isomorphism.

A Cartan geometry is a generalization of a smooth Klein geometry, in which the structure equation is not assumed, but is instead used to define a notion of curvature. Thus the Klein geometries are said to be the flat models for Cartan geometries.

== Pseudogroups ==
Cartan connections are closely related to pseudogroup structures on a manifold. Each is thought of as &quot;modelled on&quot; a Klein geometry &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;, in a manner similar to the way in which Riemannian geometry is modelled on Euclidean space. On a manifold &quot;M&quot;, one imagines attaching to each point of &quot;M&quot; a copy of the model space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;. The symmetry of the model space is then built into the Cartan geometry or pseudogroup structure by positing that the model spaces of nearby points are related by a transformation in &quot;G&quot;. The fundamental difference between a Cartan geometry and pseudogroup geometry is that the symmetry for a Cartan geometry relates &quot;infinitesimally&quot; close points by an &quot;infinitesimal&quot; transformation in &quot;G&quot; (i.e., an element of the Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot;) and the analogous notion of symmetry for a pseudogroup structure applies for points that are physically separated within the manifold.

The process of attaching spaces to points, and the attendant symmetries, can be concretely realized by using special coordinate systems. To each point &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;, a neighborhood &quot;U&quot;p of &quot;p&quot; is given along with a mapping φp : &quot;U&quot;p → &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;. In this way, the model space is attached to each point of &quot;M&quot; by realizing &quot;M&quot; locally at each point as an open subset of &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;. We think of this as a family of coordinate systems on &quot;M&quot;, parametrized by the points of &quot;M&quot;. Two such parametrized coordinate systems φ and φ′ are &quot;H&quot;-related if there is an element &quot;h&quot;p ∈ &quot;H&quot;, parametrized by &quot;p&quot;, such that
: φ′p = &quot;h&quot;p φp.
This freedom corresponds roughly to the physicists&#x27; notion of a gauge.

Nearby points are related by joining them with a curve. Suppose that &quot;p&quot; and &quot;p&quot;′ are two points in &quot;M&quot; joined by a curve &quot;p&quot;t. Then &quot;p&quot;t supplies a notion of transport of the model space along the curve. Let τt : &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; → &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; be the (locally defined) composite map
:τt = φpt o φp0−1.
Intuitively, τt is the transport map. A pseudogroup structure requires that τt be a &quot;symmetry of the model space&quot; for each &quot;t&quot;: τt ∈ &quot;G&quot;. A Cartan connection requires only that the derivative of τt be a symmetry of the model space: τ′0 ∈ g, the Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot;.

Typical of Cartan, one motivation for introducing the notion of a Cartan connection was to study the properties of pseudogroups from an infinitesimal point of view. A Cartan connection defines a pseudogroup precisely when the derivative of the transport map τ′ can be integrated, thus recovering a true (&quot;G&quot;-valued) transport map between the coordinate systems. There is thus an integrability condition at work, and Cartan&#x27;s method for realizing integrability conditions was to introduce a differential form.

In this case, τ′0 defines a differential form at the point &quot;p&quot; as follows. For a curve γ(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;p&quot;t in &quot;M&quot; starting at &quot;p&quot;, we can associate the tangent vector &quot;X&quot;, as well as a transport map τtγ. Taking the derivative determines a linear map
: formula_18
So θ defines a g-valued differential 1-form on &quot;M&quot;.

This form, however, is dependent on the choice of parametrized coordinate system. If &quot;h&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → &quot;H&quot; is an &quot;H&quot;-relation between two parametrized coordinate systems φ and φ′, then the corresponding values of θ are also related by
:formula_19
where ωH is the Maurer-Cartan form of &quot;H&quot;.

==Formal definition==

A Cartan geometry modelled on a homogeneous space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; can be viewed as a &quot;deformation&quot; of this geometry which allows for the presence of &quot;curvature&quot;. For example:
* a Riemannian manifold can be seen as a deformation of Euclidean space;
* a Lorentzian manifold can be seen as a deformation of Minkowski space;
* a conformal manifold can be seen as a deformation of the conformal sphere;
* a manifold equipped with an affine connection can be seen as a deformation of an affine space.

There are two main approaches to the definition. In both approaches, &quot;M&quot; is a smooth manifold of dimension &quot;n&quot;, &quot;H&quot; is a Lie group of dimension &quot;m&quot;, with Lie algebra formula_1, and &quot;G&quot; is a Lie group of dimension &quot;n&quot;+&quot;m&quot;, with Lie algebra formula_9, containing &quot;H&quot; as a subgroup.

===Definition via gauge transitions===
A Cartan connection consists of a coordinate atlas of open sets &quot;U&quot; in &quot;M&quot;, along with a formula_9-valued 1-form θU defined on each chart such that
# θU : T&quot;U&quot; → formula_9.
# θU mod formula_1 : Tu&quot;U&quot; → formula_25 is a linear isomorphism for every &quot;u&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot;.
#For any pair of charts &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; in the atlas, there is a smooth mapping &quot;h&quot; : &quot;U&quot; ∩ &quot;V&quot; → &quot;H&quot; such that
::formula_26
:where ωH is the Maurer-Cartan form of &quot;H&quot;.
By analogy with the case when the θU came from coordinate systems, condition 3 means that φU is related to φV by &quot;h&quot;.

The curvature of a Cartan connection consists of a system of 2-forms defined on the charts, given by
:formula_27
ΩU satisfy the compatibility condition:
:If the forms θU and θV are related by a function &quot;h&quot; : &quot;U&quot; ∩ &quot;V&quot; → &quot;H&quot;, as above, then ΩV = Ad(&quot;h&quot;−1) ΩU

The definition can be made independent of the coordinate systems by forming the quotient space 
:formula_28
of the disjoint union over all &quot;U&quot; in the atlas. The equivalence relation ~ is defined on pairs (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;h&quot;1) ∈ &quot;U&quot;1 × &quot;H&quot; and (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;h&quot;2) ∈ &quot;U&quot;2 × &quot;H&quot;, by
:(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;h&quot;1) ~ (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;h&quot;2) if and only if &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot;1 ∩ &quot;U&quot;2, θ&quot;U&quot;1 is related to θ&quot;U&quot;2 by &quot;h&quot;, and &quot;h&quot;2 = &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)−1 &quot;h&quot;1.
Then &quot;P&quot; is a principal &quot;H&quot;-bundle on &quot;M&quot;, and the compatibility condition on the connection forms θU implies that they lift to a formula_9-valued 1-form η defined on &quot;P&quot; (see below).

===Definition via absolute parallelism===

Let &quot;P&quot; be a principal &quot;H&quot; bundle over &quot;M&quot;. Then a Cartan connection is a formula_9-valued 1-form &quot;η&quot; on &quot;P&quot; such that

# for all &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;, Ad(&quot;h&quot;)&quot;R&quot;&quot;h&quot;*&quot;η&quot; = &quot;η&quot;
# for all &quot;ξ&quot; in formula_1, &quot;η&quot;(&quot;X&quot;&quot;ξ&quot;) = &quot;ξ&quot;
# for all &quot;p&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, the restriction of &quot;η&quot; defines a linear isomorphism from the tangent space T&quot;p&quot;&quot;P&quot; to formula_9.

The last condition is sometimes called the Cartan condition: it means that &quot;η&quot; defines an absolute parallelism on &quot;P&quot;. The second condition implies that &quot;η&quot; is already injective on vertical vectors and that the 1-form &quot;η&quot; mod formula_1, with values in formula_25, is horizontal. The vector space formula_25 is a representation of &quot;H&quot; using the adjoint representation of &quot;H&quot; on formula_9, and the first condition implies that &quot;η&quot; mod formula_1 is equivariant. Hence it defines a bundle homomorphism from T&quot;M&quot; to the associated bundle formula_38.
The Cartan condition is equivalent to this bundle homomorphism being an isomorphism, so that &quot;η&quot; mod formula_1 is a solder form.

The curvature of a Cartan connection is the formula_9-valued 2-form &quot;Ω&quot; defined by
:formula_41

Note that this definition of a Cartan connection looks very similar to that of a principal connection. There are several important differences, however. First, the 1-form η takes values in formula_9, but is only equivariant under the action of &quot;H&quot;. Indeed, it cannot be equivariant under the full group &quot;G&quot; because there is no &quot;G&quot; bundle and no &quot;G&quot; action. Secondly, the 1-form is an absolute parallelism, which intuitively means that η yields information about the behavior of additional directions in the principal bundle (rather than simply being a projection operator onto the vertical space). Concretely, the existence of a solder form binds (or solders) the Cartan connection to the underlying differential topology of the manifold.
An intuitive interpretation of the Cartan connection in this form is that it determines a &quot;fracturing&quot; of the tautological principal bundle associated to a Klein geometry. Thus Cartan geometries are deformed analogues of Klein geometries. This deformation is roughly a prescription for attaching a copy of the model space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; to each point of &quot;M&quot; and thinking of that model space as being &quot;tangent&quot; to (and &quot;infinitesimally identical&quot; with) the manifold at a point of contact. The fibre of the tautological bundle &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; of the Klein geometry at the point of contact is then identified with the fibre of the bundle &quot;P&quot;. Each such fibre (in &quot;G&quot;) carries a Maurer-Cartan form for &quot;G&quot;, and the Cartan connection is a way of assembling these Maurer-Cartan forms gathered from the points of contact into a coherent 1-form η defined on the whole bundle. The fact that only elements of &quot;H&quot; contribute to the Maurer-Cartan equation Ad(&quot;h&quot;)&quot;R&quot;&quot;h&quot;*&quot;η&quot; = &quot;η&quot; has the intuitive interpretation that any other elements of &quot;G&quot; would move the model space away from the point of contact, and so no longer be tangent to the manifold.

From the Cartan connection, defined in these terms, one can recover a Cartan connection as a system of 1-forms on the manifold (as in the gauge definition) by taking a collection of local trivializations of &quot;P&quot; given as sections &quot;s&quot;U : &quot;U&quot; → &quot;P&quot; and letting θU = &quot;s&quot;*η be the pullbacks of the Cartan connection along the sections.

===As principal connections===

Another way in which to define a Cartan connection is as a principal connection on a certain principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle. From this perspective, a Cartan connection consists of
* a principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle &quot;Q&quot; over &quot;M&quot;
* a principal &quot;G&quot;-connection &quot;α&quot; on &quot;Q&quot; (the Cartan connection)
* a principal &quot;H&quot;-subbundle &quot;P&quot; of &quot;Q&quot; (i.e., a reduction of structure group)
such that the pullback &quot;η&quot; of &quot;α&quot; to &quot;P&quot; satisfies the Cartan condition.

The principal connection &quot;α&quot; on &quot;Q&quot; can be recovered from the form &quot;η&quot; by taking &quot;Q&quot; to be the associated bundle &quot;P&quot; ×&quot;H&quot; &quot;G&quot;. Conversely, the form η can be recovered from α by pulling back along the inclusion &quot;P&quot; ⊂ &quot;Q&quot;.

Since &quot;α&quot; is a principal connection, it induces a connection on any associated bundle to &quot;Q&quot;. In particular, the bundle &quot;Q&quot; ×&quot;G&quot; &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; of homogeneous spaces over &quot;M&quot;, whose fibers are copies of the model space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;, has a connection. The reduction of structure group to &quot;H&quot; is equivalently given by a section &quot;s&quot; of &quot;E&quot; = &quot;Q&quot; ×&quot;G&quot; &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;. The fiber of formula_43 over &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot; may be viewed as the tangent space at &quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) to the fiber of &quot;Q&quot; ×&quot;G&quot; &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; over &quot;x&quot;. Hence the Cartan condition has the intuitive interpretation that the model spaces are tangent to &quot;M&quot; along the section &quot;s&quot;. Since this identification of tangent spaces is induced by the connection, the marked points given by &quot;s&quot; always move under parallel transport.

=== Definition by an Ehresmann connection ===
Yet another way to define a Cartan connection is with an Ehresmann connection on the bundle &quot;E&quot; = &quot;Q&quot; ×&quot;G&quot; &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; of the preceding section. A Cartan connection then consists of
*A fiber bundle π : &quot;E&quot; → &quot;M&quot; with fibre &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; and vertical space V&quot;E&quot; ⊂ T&quot;E&quot;.
*A section &quot;s&quot; : &quot;M&quot; → &quot;E&quot;.
*A G-connection θ : T&quot;E&quot; → V&quot;E&quot; such that
::&quot;s&quot;*θx : Tx&quot;M&quot; → V&quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;E&quot; is a linear isomorphism of vector spaces for all &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;.
This definition makes rigorous the intuitive ideas presented in the introduction. First, the preferred section &quot;s&quot; can be thought of as identifying a point of contact between the manifold and the tangent space. The last condition, in particular, means that the tangent space of &quot;M&quot; at &quot;x&quot; is isomorphic to the tangent space of the model space at the point of contact. So the model spaces are, in this way, tangent to the manifold.
This definition also brings prominently into focus the idea of development. If &quot;x&quot;t is a curve in &quot;M&quot;, then the Ehresmann connection on &quot;E&quot; supplies an associated parallel transport map τt : &quot;E&quot;xt → &quot;E&quot;x0 from the fibre over the endpoint of the curve to the fibre over the initial point. In particular, since &quot;E&quot; is equipped with a preferred section &quot;s&quot;, the points &quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;t) transport back to the fibre over &quot;x&quot;0 and trace out a curve in &quot;E&quot;x0. This curve is then called the &quot;development&quot; of the curve &quot;x&quot;t.

To show that this definition is equivalent to the others above, one must introduce a suitable notion of a moving frame for the bundle &quot;E&quot;. In general, this is possible for any &quot;G&quot;-connection on a fibre bundle with structure group &quot;G&quot;. See Ehresmann connection#Associated bundles for more details.

== Special Cartan connections ==

=== Reductive Cartan connections ===
Let &quot;P&quot; be a principal &quot;H&quot;-bundle on &quot;M&quot;, equipped with a Cartan connection η : T&quot;P&quot; → formula_9. If formula_9 is a reductive module for &quot;H&quot;, meaning that formula_9 admits an Ad(&quot;H&quot;)-invariant splitting of vector spaces formula_47, then the formula_48-component of η generalizes the solder form for an affine connection.
In detail, η splits into formula_1 and formula_48 components: 
:η = ηformula_1 + ηformula_48.
Note that the 1-form ηformula_1 is a principal &quot;H&quot;-connection on the original Cartan bundle &quot;P&quot;. Moreover, the 1-form ηformula_48 satisfies:
:ηformula_48(&quot;X&quot;) = 0 for every vertical vector &quot;X&quot; ∈ T&quot;P&quot;. (ηformula_48 is &quot;horizontal&quot;.)
:Rh*ηformula_48 = Ad(&quot;h&quot;−1)ηformula_48 for every &quot;h&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot;. (ηformula_48 is &quot;equivariant&quot; under the right &quot;H&quot;-action.)
In other words, η is a solder form for the bundle &quot;P&quot;.

Hence, &quot;P&quot; equipped with the form ηformula_48 defines a (first order) &quot;H&quot;-structure on &quot;M&quot;. The form ηformula_1 defines a connection on the &quot;H&quot;-structure.

=== Parabolic Cartan connections ===
If formula_9 is a semisimple Lie algebra with parabolic subalgebra formula_63 (i.e., formula_63 contains a maximal solvable subalgebra of formula_9) and &quot;G&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are associated Lie groups, then a Cartan connection modelled on (&quot;G&quot;,&quot;P&quot;,formula_9,formula_63) is called a parabolic Cartan geometry, or simply a parabolic geometry. A distinguishing feature of parabolic geometries is a Lie algebra structure on its cotangent spaces: this arises because the perpendicular subspace formula_63⊥ of formula_63 in formula_9 with respect to the Killing form of formula_9 is a subalgebra of formula_63, and the Killing form induces a natural duality between formula_63⊥ and formula_74. Thus the bundle associated to formula_63⊥ is isomorphic to the cotangent bundle.

Parabolic geometries include many of those of interest in research and applications of Cartan connections, such as the following examples:
* Conformal connections: Here &quot;G&quot; = &quot;SO&quot;(&quot;p&quot;+1,&quot;q&quot;+1), and &quot;P&quot; is the stabilizer of a null ray in Rn+2.
* Projective connections: Here &quot;G&quot; = &quot;PGL&quot;(n+1) and &quot;P&quot; is the stabilizer of a point in RPn.
* CR structures and Cartan-Chern-Tanaka connections: &quot;G&quot; = &quot;PSU&quot;(&quot;p&quot;+1,&quot;q&quot;+1), &quot;P&quot; = stabilizer of a point on the projective null hyperquadric.
* Contact projective connections: Here &quot;G&quot; = &quot;SP&quot;(2n+2) and &quot;P&quot; is the stabilizer of the ray generated by the first standard basis vector in Rn+2.
* Generic rank 2 distributions on 5-manifolds: Here &quot;G&quot; = &quot;Aut&quot;(Os) is the automorphism group of the algebra Os of split octonions, a closed subgroup of &quot;SO&quot;(3,4), and &quot;P&quot; is the intersection of G with the stabilizer of the isotropic line spanned by the first standard basis vector in R7 viewed as the purely imaginary split octonions (orthogonal complement of the unit element in Os).

==Associated differential operators==

===Covariant differentiation===

Suppose that &quot;M&quot; is a Cartan geometry modelled on &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;, and let (&quot;Q&quot;,&quot;α&quot;) be the principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle with connection, and (&quot;P&quot;,&quot;η&quot;) the corresponding reduction to &quot;H&quot; with &quot;η&quot; equal to the pullback of &quot;α&quot;. Let &quot;V&quot; a representation of &quot;G&quot;, and form the vector bundle V = &quot;Q&quot; ×&quot;G&quot; &quot;V&quot; over &quot;M&quot;. Then the principal &quot;G&quot;-connection &quot;α&quot; on &quot;Q&quot; induces a covariant derivative on V, which is a first order linear differential operator
:formula_76
where formula_77 denotes the space of &quot;k&quot;-forms on &quot;M&quot; with values in V so that
formula_78 is the space of sections of V and formula_79 is the space of sections of
Hom(T&quot;M&quot;,V). For any section &quot;v&quot; of V, the contraction of the covariant derivative ∇&quot;v&quot; with a vector field &quot;X&quot; on &quot;M&quot; is denoted ∇&quot;X&quot;&quot;v&quot; and satisfies the following Leibniz rule:
:formula_80
for any smooth function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;M&quot;.

The covariant derivative can also be constructed from the Cartan connection &quot;η&quot; on &quot;P&quot;. In fact, constructing it in this way is slightly more general in that &quot;V&quot; need not be a fully fledged representation of &quot;G&quot;. Suppose instead that &quot;V&quot; is a (formula_9, &quot;H&quot;)-module: a representation of the group &quot;H&quot; with a compatible representation of the Lie algebra formula_82. Recall that a section &quot;v&quot; of the induced vector bundle V over &quot;M&quot; can be thought of as an &quot;H&quot;-equivariant map &quot;P&quot; → &quot;V&quot;. This is the point of view we shall adopt. Let &quot;X&quot; be a vector field on &quot;M&quot;. Choose any right-invariant lift formula_83 to the tangent bundle of &quot;P&quot;. Define
:formula_84.

In order to show that ∇&quot;v&quot; is well defined, it must:
# be independent of the chosen lift formula_83
# be equivariant, so that it descends to a section of the bundle V.

For (1), the ambiguity in selecting a right-invariant lift of &quot;X&quot; is a transformation of the form formula_86 where formula_87 is the right-invariant vertical vector field induced from formula_88. So, calculating the covariant derivative in terms of the new lift formula_89, one has

:formula_90
:formula_91
:formula_92

since formula_93 by taking the differential of the equivariance property formula_94 at &quot;h&quot; equal to the identity element.

For (2), observe that since &quot;v&quot; is equivariant and formula_83 is right-invariant, formula_96 is equivariant. On the other hand, since &quot;η&quot; is also equivariant, it follows that formula_97 is equivariant as well.

===The fundamental or universal derivative===

Suppose that &quot;V&quot; is only a representation of the subgroup &quot;H&quot; and not necessarily the larger group &quot;G&quot;. Let formula_98 be the space of &quot;V&quot;-valued differential &quot;k&quot;-forms on &quot;P&quot;. In the presence of a Cartan connection, there is a canonical isomorphism
:formula_99
given by
formula_100 where formula_101 and formula_102.

For each &quot;k&quot;, the exterior derivative is a first order operator differential operator
:formula_103
and so, for &quot;k&quot;=0, it defines a differential operator
:formula_104
Because &quot;η&quot; is equivariant, if &quot;v&quot; is equivariant, so is &quot;Dv&quot; := &quot;φ&quot;(d&quot;v&quot;). It follows that this composite descends to a first order differential operator &quot;D&quot; from sections of V=&quot;P&quot;×&quot;H&quot;&quot;V&quot; to sections of the bundle formula_105. This is called the fundamental or universal derivative, or fundamental D-operator.

<text>John Underhill (c. 1608/09 – 21 July 1672) was an early English settler and soldier in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Province of New Hampshire, where he also served as governor; the New Haven Colony, New Netherland, and later the Province of New York, settling on Long Island. Hired to train militia in New England, he is most noted for leading colonial militia in the Pequot War (1636–1637) and Kieft&#x27;s War which the colonists mounted against two different groups of Native Americans. He also published an account of the Pequot War.

==Biography==

===Early life, military, and marriage===
John Underhill was one of three children of John Underhill (1574–1608) and Leonora Honor Pawley. His great-grandfather Sir Hugh Underhill was Keeper of the Wardrobe for Queen Elizabeth at Greenwich, and his grandfather Thomas Underhill held the same position at Kenilworth Castle for Elizabeth&#x27;s favorite, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester.

John Underhill was born in ca 1608/09 in the Netherlands. His family had escaped to the Netherlands after a failed plot by the Earl of Essex to overthrow the Queen. There they stayed in Bergen op Zoom, a heavily fortified city. John Underhill was sergeant in the company of Captain Roger Orme. He died there in October 1608 and is buried in the Church of St. Gertrude.

Following his father&#x27;s death, John Underhill and his siblings lived with their mother and a group of Puritan exiles in the Netherlands. While there he received military training as a cadet in the service of Philip William, the Prince of Orange. He also married a Dutch girl, Helena (&quot;Heylken&quot;) de Hooch on 12 December 1628 in the Kloosterkerk, The Hague, Holland. They had one child born in the Netherlands before emigrating, Deborah Underhill, and two other children after emigrating: Elizabeth (born 1635) and John Underhill (1642–1692).

===Massachusetts Bay Colony===
In 1630, Underhill was hired by the Massachusetts Bay Colony with the rank of captain and asked to help train the colony&#x27;s militia. He and his Dutch wife emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony on the Arbella that year. In May 1634 he was appointed to the General Court, and in July was elected a selectman for Boston. He started the first construction of the fortification on Castle Island at Boston.

Early in 1636 he was sent to Salem to arrest Roger Williams, considered a heretic by the Puritans. But, Williams had already fled to Rhode Island. In August 1636 Underhill led an expedition to Block Island.

===Pequot War===
Using the Narragansett killing of a Plymouth Colony-exile and the mistaken killing of an English pirate by the Pequot people as a pretext, the English colonists decided to go to war against the Pequots who controlled the regional wampum trade and coastal lands desired by the Puritans. In September 1637 Underhill headed the militia as it undertook the Pequot War. They first went to the fort at Saybrook, in present-day Connecticut. Joining with Mohegan allies and Connecticut militia under Captain John Mason, they attacked the fortified Pequot village near modern Mystic. They set fire to the village, killing any who attempted to flee. About 400 Pequot died in what came to be called the Mystic massacre.

Underhill led other expeditions that joined in hunting down the surviving Pequot. He published an account of his service as &quot;Newes from America; Or, A New and Experimentall Discoverie of New England; Containing, A True Relation of Their War-like Proceedings These Two Yeares Last Past, with a Figure of the Indian Fort, or Palizado&quot; (London, 1638).

===Wandering years===
Within a year of these exploits, Underhill suffered from the Puritan drive for conformity. He had signed the Boston petition supporting minister John Wheelwright, who had been censured for a sermon. Underhill was removed from office and disfranchised in 1637, banished along with Anne Hutchinson in 1638, and excommunicated in 1640. After a fruitless trip to England in search of employment, Underhill returned to Boston. He sold his house and land and joined Wheelwright, who had settled in Dover, New Hampshire. Underhill&#x27;s mother and her second husband Morris also left Boston, moving to nearby Exeter. In Dover, Underhill soon rose to the position of Governor, although Governor John Winthrop had written letters to citizens of that community denouncing him.

In June 1641 Underhill&#x27;s banishment was repealed. In September of that year he was acquitted of a charge of adultery. Still finding no gainful employment in Boston, following the baptism of his son John III in April 1642, he leased a tobacco plantation in Flatlands, Long Island, in New Netherland. He never occupied that land.

Underhill moved to Stamford, Connecticut, where he was named a Freeman in 1642, a Deputy to the General Court of the New Haven Colony in 1643, and Justice of the Stamford Court. Following Indian raids in 1643, he was hired by the New Netherland Board of Eight Selectmen to attack Lenape settlements.

In February 1644, working for the Dutch, Underhill slaughtered an estimated 500 to 700 Lenape, thought to be of the Siwanoy and Wechquaesgeek bands of the Wappinger Confederacy. The killings occurred at a winter village of the natives, the site of which has not been identified with certainty. Some researchers believe it may have been located at what are now the sites of Pound Ridge or Bedford, New York.

===Service in New Netherland===
In May 1644, Underhill took up residence in New Amsterdam. His plot of land at the southern end of the island was later developed as the site of Trinity Church in Manhattan. Later that year he led New Amsterdam&#x27;s forces in a reprise of his attack during the Pequot War. The Indians on Long Island built a fort called Fort Neck in what is now Massapequa. Underhill attacked and burned the Massapequan fort, killing about 120 Indians. The war started because the leader of the Indians, Tackapausha, claimed he sold the Dutch use to the land, but not the land itself. This was related to differing cultural ideas about land and its use and ownership.

Upon returning to Manhattan, in 1645, Underhill was elected a Selectman to the Council of New Amsterdam. That same year he was named one of Eight Men to adopt measures against the Indians. While preparing to occupy Bergen Island, he was assigned to Flushing by Governor Peter Stuyvesant. He was appointed sheriff of Flushing in 1648 and magistrate from 1651 to 1653.

In 1653, Underill turned against Stuyvesant, accusing him of being a tyrant. As Flushing&#x27;s leader, Underhill issued a proclamation calling for the overthrow of the government: &quot;We declare that it is right and proper to defend ourselves and our rights, which belong to a free people, against the abuses of the above named government.&quot; Just as many of his descendants would enumerate George III&#x27;s wrongdoings, so he described Stuyvesant&#x27;s; he had, for example, imposed magistrates on the people of Flushing &quot;without election or voting.&quot; In conclusion, Underhill declared, &quot;This great autocracy and tyranny is too grievous for any brave Englishman and good Christian any longer to tolerate Accept and submit ye, then, to the Parliament of England.&quot; This was a precursor to the Flushing Remonstrance of 1657, that questioned and challenged Dutch authority.

===Return to English service===
After being imprisoned by the Dutch for a brief time, Underhill was released. Upon hearing of Dutch plans to ally with some tribes to attack the English settlements, Underhill brought word of this to the colonies in Connecticut. The General Assembly of Rhode Island named him Commander-in-Chief and authorized him to seize a Dutch settlement named the House of Hope at Hartford, Connecticut. Fearing an attack by troops led by Underhill, Stuyvesant ordered that a high stockade and a small breastwork be constructed across the northern border of New Amsterdam. Thus Wall Street was built. When the First Anglo-Dutch War was finally resolved in 1654, Underhill returned to Long Island.

He lived in Southold, Setauket, and finally settled in the Town of Oyster Bay, where he lived out the remainder of his years. This place was on the eastern edge of New Netherland and far enough out of reach of Massachusetts Bay and other colonies to give Underhill a respite from war, conflict, and religious intolerance.

===Retirement to Oyster Bay===
Underhill eventually retired to a large estate (Kenilworth or Killingworth) at Oyster Bay on Long Island. He served as the Delegate of Oyster Bay to the Hempstead Convention in 1665. Delegates from all the towns on Long Island were asked to send two representatives. There they sought to establish laws. Underhill agreed on passage of a law that settlers could make no land purchases from the Lenape in the future without the government&#x27;s consent. At the close of the convention, Underhill was named High Constable and Surveyor-General. The following year as Chief Advisor to the Matinecock Indians (a Lenape band named by the English for their location), Underhill presented a petition to the Council of Assizes in 1666. The Matinecock conveyed of land in Oyster Bay to Underhill.

Following the death of his first wife and his mother in 1658, Underhill married his second wife Elizabeth Feake on 2 December 1658, in Oyster Bay. Feake was a Quaker and converted John to Quakerism before he died.

Elizabeth Feake and her family, much like Underhill, had an important role in the shaping of colonial America. She was the daughter of Elizabeth Fones and her second husband Robert Feake. Her mother was known to have married her third husband William Hallet while her second husband Robert Feake was still alive. Robert Feake had abandoned Elizabeth, and was considered mentally ill, but the couple had not obtained a divorce.

Hannah Feake, the second daughter of Robert Feake and Elizabeth Fones and sister of Elizabeth Feake, became an important figure in the fight for religious freedom in colonial America. Governor Peter Stuyvesant banned the rights of Quakers to assemble and worship. On 27 December 1657, thirty townspeople of Flushing signed the Flushing Remonstrance protesting this ban. The ban was later tested when Hannah, a Quaker minister herself, held services in her own home. Her husband John Bowne was arrested and returned to England, only to be released and allowed to return. The events contributed to the principles codified a century later in the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights, granting religious and political freedom to all citizens.

Captain John Underhill and Elizabeth Feake had five children: Deborah (1659–1697), Nathaniel (1663–1710), Hannah (1666–1757), Elizabeth (1669–1704), and David (1672–1708). Son Nathaniel Underhill settled in Westchester County, New York, where he became a prominent citizen and the progenitor of a large number of descendants. Several streets in Nassau County (Locust Valley and Syosset), and Westchester County are named for Underhill and his descendants.

Captain John Underhill died on 21 July 1672 and is buried in the Underhill Burying Ground in Locust Valley, New York.

Some of John Underhill&#x27;s many descendants formed the Underhill Society of America.

&quot;Matthews&#x27; American Armoury and Blue Book&quot;, published in 1907, describes the arms of Captain John Underhill as follows:
Captain John Underhill, 1597–1672, of Boston, 1630, Governor of Piscataqua Plantation. He had previously served in the British Army in the Netherlands, in Ireland, and at Cadiz. Arms - Argent, on a chevron Sable, between three trefoils slipped Vert, as many bezants. Crest - On a mount vert a hind lodged Or.
==Writings==
Underhill wrote numerous accounts; his most notable was &quot;Newes from America; Or, A New and Experimentall Discoverie of New England; Containing, A True Relation of Their War-like Proceedings These Two Yeares Last Past, with a Figure of the Indian Fort, or Palizado&quot;, considered the most complete contemporary account of the Pequot War of 1636–1637.

An excerpt of a letter from Captain Underhill to Hanserd Knollys appears in &quot;The Algerine Captive&quot; by Royall Tyler published in 1970 by Rowman &amp; Littlefield.

==Modern interpretations==
John Underhill has been the subject of a recent trend toward historically revised accounts of the Pequot War. (&quot;See: Pequot War#Historical accounts and controversies&quot;). He has been described as a mercenary in service to the English and the Dutch. He was a professional soldier who was paid for his service. He served in the army of the Prince of Orange before coming to New England and was married to a Dutch woman. Ultimately he rejected these affiliations with the Netherlands and strongly asserted his patriotic commitment to England and English claims to North America.

<text>Aguascalientes, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Aguascalientes, is one of the 32 states which comprise the Federal Entities of Mexico. At 22°N and with an average altitude of above sea level it is predominantly of semi-arid climate (Bhs and Bhk). The state is located in the northern part of the Bajío region, which is in the north-central part of the country, bordered by Zacatecas to the north, east and west, and by Jalisco to the south.

As of the 2020 census, Aguascalientes has a population of 1,425,607 inhabitants, most of whom live in its capital city, also named Aguascalientes. Its name means &quot;hot waters&quot; and originated from the abundance of hot springs originally found in the area. The demonym for the state&#x27;s inhabitants is &quot;hidrocálido&quot; or &quot;aguascalentense&quot;.

Aguascalientes is one of the smallest states of Mexico, either by population or land, being the 27th most populated state and the 29th biggest state by area; nonetheless, it is the 4th state by population density, and its economic development in recent years have located it as the 7th state by Human Development Index and the 8th with highest GDP per capita.

Aguascalientes was historically known for its former railroad and textile industry, as well as wine making, an industry that remains today. During the 2010s Aguascalientes became the fastest-growing state in the country for the whole decade. Aguascalientes is also well known for its San Marcos Fair (Feria Nacional de San Marcos), the largest fair in Mexico and one of the largest in Latin America.

==History==
Pre-Columbian era arrowheads, potshards, and rock paintings in the caverns of the Sierra del Laurel and near the present village of Las Negritas testify to the presence of humans in this territory for more than 20,000 years. Later in the colonial times, Pedro Almíndez Chirino was the first Spaniard who entered the territory, perhaps by the end of 1530 or the beginning of 1531, following the instructions given by Nuño de Guzmán.

Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the territory of what is now the State of Aguascalientes was inhabited by Chichimecas, who made the territory difficult to access. In fact, the total occupation of the lands of El Bajío was a task that would take about two centuries. With respect to this, Viceroy Luís de Velasco offered municipal benefits to those who established settlements to confront the Chichimeca. And for his part, Viceroy Gastón de Peralta decided to confront them directly, which did not end with good results.

It was in order to be in the territory that is presently the state inhabited by Chichimecas, the so-called Guachichiles, that the conquistadors built several forts or presidios.

This was a system devised by Martín Enríquez de Almanza following the strategy that had been developing in Spain throughout the Reconquista period. Therefore, in order to protect the Camino de la Plata, which stretched between Zacatecas and Mexico City, three presidios [garrisoned fortifications] founded by the Indian fighter Juan Domínguez, were to be created, which were: the presidio at Las Bocas, later called Las Bocas de Gallardo, situated on the border of Aguascalientes, in what was the jurisdiction of the mayor of Teocaltiche, presently the border of Aguascalientes and Zacatecas; the presidio at Palmillas, which was located near what is now Tepezalá; and the Ciénega Grande presidio, established around 1570. The latter was located on what are now Moctezuma and Victoria Streets, although some historians place it on the Calle 5 de Mayo (once the Camino Real) at Moctezuma, just in front of the Plaza de Armas. This was a fortress whose purpose was the protection of the Valle de los Romero and the road to Zacatecas, entering this way to secure the passage of convoys loaded with silver and other metals.
The founding of Aguascalientes as a town came from the order that King Felipe II gave the judge of the court of Nueva Galicia, Don Gerónimo de Orozco, in which he stated that he should look for a rich man to settle in the territory with the purpose of expelling the Chichimecas and of assuring safe passage. Gerónimo de Orozco, following that order, looked for someone who would accept the king&#x27;s order and found a man named Juan de Montoro in the city of Santa María de los Lagos. He accepted the assignment and, accompanied by eleven other people, headed to the territory and thus founded the town of Aguas Calientes on October 22, 1575. It has been noted that it was called San Marcos originally, changing its name on August 18, 1611, to the Villa of Our Lady of the Assumption of Aguas Calientes. And finally, from June 2, 1875, it was called the Villa of Our Lady of the Assumption of Aguas Calientes; later changing to the city of Aguascalientes, which remains its name today.

In the act of its establishment, the Villa de San Marcos (Aguascalientes) was awarded the highest mayoral jurisdiction under the Kingdom of New Galicia. As of December 4, 1786, on the occasion of the issuance of the &quot;Ordinance of Mayors&quot;, it became a quartermaster sub-delegation.

On April 24, 1789, by order of the Superior Board of Royal Property, the sub-delegation of Aguascalientes became a dependency of Zacatecas.

In the Mexican War of Independence, in the territory which is today the state of Aguascalientes, the fires of independence were stoked by illustrious and courageous men such as Valentin Gómez Farías, Rafael Iriarte, Rafael Vázquez, and Pedro Parga.Confusion has arisen regarding the exact date when Aguascalientes formally separated from the territory of Zacatecas. By virtue of having, de facto, defeated the liberal government of Zacatecas by rising against the central government, president Antonio López de Santa Anna passed through Aguascalientes, where he was well received by the people who had wanted to separate from Zacatecas for some time. Taking advantage of the independent souls of the Aguascalentenses, and by way of punishing Zacatecas for supporting the Revolution against them, by Federal Decree of General López de Santa Anna dated May 23, 1835, in the third article; ordered that Aguascalientes to be separated from Zacatecas territory, without granting the territory any specific category, reinstating the appointment of the political boss, Pedro Garcia Rojas. With respect to this, it must be mentioned that said order was not made official as it did not meet the legal requirements to take effect, since it was necessary that two thirds of each house, both Senators and Representatives, approved the order; furthermore it would be required that two thirds of the legislatures of the states also approved it. The second requirement not being completed, the constitutional congress convened again to develop the centralized constitution that would be known later as the Seven Laws. The constitution did not acknowledge Aguascalientes in the rank of department, but it saw fit to eliminate the states, together with the federal regime, replacing the states with departments, and because of this it continued to belong to Zacatecas. What can be said, since in the local constitution of Zacatecas of 1825, Aguascalientes was contemplated as a member of said state.

It was general José Mariano Salas who, on August 5, 1846, announced the reestablishment of federalism, convening a constitutional congress that declared current the constitution of 1824, but still didn&#x27;t consider Aguascalientes as a state. Subsequently, on May 18, 1847, amendments were approved to the Constitution of 1824, but neither granted to Aguascalientes the status of a state. That brought about a war between Aguascalientes and Zacatecas, and as a consequence Zacatecas would strengthen the partitions, now municipalities, of Cavillo and Rincón de Romos. In July 1848, Aguascalientes accepted the peaceful annexation to Zacatecas; but continued making efforts to separate through Miguel García Rojas. It was not until December 10, 1853, that López de Santa Anna, using his extraordinary powers, issued a decree declaring Aguascalientes a department, based on the decrees of December 30, 1836, and June 30, 1838, without ever referring to the one from March 23, 1835. Finally, in the project that would be the Constitution of 1857, that was presented on June 16, 1856, Aguascalientes was included as a state in Article 43; it was passed unanimously by the 79 deputies present, ensuring the establishment of the state of Aguascalientes on December 10, 1856. On September 16, 1857, on the strength of said constitution, Lic. Jesús Terán Peredo reclaimed his post as constitutional governor of the state.

In the independent state, hidrocálidos (people of Aguascalientes) Jesús R. Macías, Manuel Rangel, Augustín Orona, José María Arellano and many other anonymous heroes distinguished themselves in the War of Reform.

Silvestre Dorador, Román Morales, Pedro Vital, Alfonso Guerrero Aguilera and Alberto Fuentes Dávila were forerunners of the Revolution. The explosion of the Maderist movement embraced the cause in the company of some other compatriots, and the rebel action of the town and the region stayed formalized.

==Geography==

The state is located about from Mexico City in the macroregion of El Bajío, specifically the Bajío Occidental (western Bajío).

It covers , or 0.3% of the area of the country, and has a little more than one million inhabitants. Most of its inhabitants live in the densely populated metropolitan area of its capital city.

The state as it is now was created on October 27, 1857, when it was separated from Zacatecas after the tale says that the wife of the governor of the state promised to give a kiss to the President of the time, in exchange for the separation of Aguascalientes from Zacatecas, which explains the shape of a kiss the state has.

==Government and politics==

===Government===
Aguascalientes is subdivided into 11 &quot;municipios&quot; (&quot;municipalities&quot;).

==Economy and industry==

This state originated around the times of colonial Spanish influence. It is located in the middle of the country and is now beginning to make a name for itself as an industrial power within Mexico. The state was once a major silver miner and a major source of railroad transportation, the latter due to its strategic location, midway between the three most populous areas, namely Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey.

Today, Mexico&#x27;s fast growing car industry is especially important in this state. There are two Nissan factories in Aguascalientes which together produce more than half a million cars per year. Infiniti may build a plant to make vehicles like the QX30.

In the rural area, Aguascalientes was once the largest national producer of grapes and wines. This tradition ceased gradually due to the Spanish Royalty&#x27;s wishes that grape and wine production be limited to the mother country. Thanks to the influx of immigrants into Mexico, the wineries and vineyards remain and flourish. Guavas are also produced in the state, specifically in the municipality of Calvillo. This county is one of the richest counties in Aguascalientes.

There are several projects for economic development such as: the Financial District Río San Pedro, a monorail, a suburban train, the construction of the newest and most modern WTC in Mexico, over four shopping malls, two theme parks, two Executive Hotels and one whose qualification is five stars, eight bridges for the next five years, a Financial District around the Airport, A Texas Instruments Assembly-Test Plant, A Nissan Assembly plant, a Toyota assembly plant and several others projects place Aguascalientes as the third most competitive state in Mexico with more than US$12,000,000 in foreign direct investment per year (around 8 percent of Mexico&#x27;s FDI) even though its population is just about 1.03 percent of the country.

However, recently it has also benefited from heavier tourism, since the capital city has gained prestige and status as a national destination for its colonial beauty and cleanliness. In addition, the haciendas and baths around the state have historic and recreational importance.

==Tourism==

Although this state is not often billed as a tourist center, international visitors, as well as citizens from all over Mexico, are attracted to San Marcos Fair, which is considered the national fair of Mexico and contributes much to Mexico&#x27;s economy.

Recently, its capital city has gained the reputation as a great destination for its superb colonial architecture visible in the colonial center, as well as the modernity and dynamism in the outskirts.

The city is home to Lic. Jesús Terán Peredo International Airport, where 9 flights per day depart to Mexico City, Tijuana, Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston.

The city also hosts many conventions every year. It benefits from its excellent central location. The city is also famed for its environment of relaxation, and for its safety and cleanliness, as it is often described by people when traveling to this part of the country for conventions or tourism.

Most tourists go to the capital. A few tourists explore the former mining towns in the north of the state (in the municipalities of Asientos and Tepezalá), which are now almost ghost cities. The haciendas, hot springs, and baths scattered around the state are also of historical and recreational relevance.

The municipality of Calvillo has a humid subtropical climate, The largest producer of guavas in Mexico, it attracts some fans of watersports to its reservoirs.
The state has a Natural Protected Reserve in the higher mountains called Sierra Fría. Located at a height of above sea level, it comprises oak and pine forests. Its attractions include observing exuberant landscape and wide ravines, in which, there are pumas, lynxes, boar, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, raccoons and many other animals. There are steep-sided cycle paths, camping and picnic areas as well as several hunting clubs. It is the mountain climate and fauna that attracts locals for camping activities. In winter, the temperature sometimes falls to when the weather is poor. Usually, Sierra Fría is the only part of the state that gets snow during winter.

In the city of Aguascalientes one of the best sunsets in the world can be seen in Cerro del Muerto; the hill resembles the shape of a man lying down. The city of Aguascalientes is called &quot;el corazón&quot; which means &quot;the heart&quot; of Mexico because it lies in the middle of the country. This city is often considered, by its locals, to be one of the safest and cleanest in Mexico. Also, the city of Aguascalientes is known as &quot;the land of the good people&quot;.

==Sports==

Club de Fútbol Gallos Hidrocálidos de Aguascalientes was a football club from Aguascalientes, Mexico.

The club was founded in 1994, when Salvador López Monroy, a restaurant business owner from Los Angeles, bought a second division franchise which he relocated to Aguascalientes where there was no professional football club.

The club played its last tournament in 2000-2001 when the Governor of Aguascalientes bought first division club Necaxa, with its national following, and relocated it from Mexico City. Gallos de Aguascalientes was then sold to Chivas, which changed its name to F.C. Tapatio de Guadalajara, affiliated to Chivas.

The city is home to the soccer team Club Necaxa, which plays in Mexican first division. The club left Mexico City and relocated to Aguascalientes following the 2003 opening of Estadio Victoria, which is now the club&#x27;s home venue and one of the best stadiums in the country.

The state has one football team in the Mexican Premiere League, Club Necaxa, one professional baseball team in the Mexican League, Rieleros de Aguascalientes (The railroad men), and one professional basketball team, Panteras de Aguascalientes (Aguascalientes Panthers)

In December 2009, Necaxa was represented on the field and played their final 2009 match within the Primera División (First Division) tier in the 2009 season after losing 1-0 vs Club América. Under the rules of regulation, Necaxa would not be able to participate in the First Division competition play in the fall 2009 and spring 2010 year.
Necaxa&#x27;s closing spring 2010 league performance had some accomplishments. They had an undefeated record at home throughout the fall 2009. In the spring 2010 campaign, Necaxa&#x27;s only loss in the season came against F.C León, Necaxa faced this other soccer team on May 8, 2010, for the second leg of the Bicentennial Closing Spring Tournament of 2010. Necaxa won 4–2 on aggregate. Necaxa abandoned the Liga de Ascenso and returned to First Division fall 2010 season. As a result of this match Necaxa won the bi-championship in the Liga de Ascenso and First Promotion title in their franchise history.

On April 16, 2011, after a draw 1–1 with Atlante F.C., the club&#x27;s first key game in 2011, Necaxa could not cumulate enough points in order to evade relegation. For a second time, Club Necaxa was relegated to the Liga de Ascenso, the second tier, for the 2011–2012 season.

<text>The José Cabrera Nuclear Power Station (also known as Zorita) was a nuclear power station in Almonacid de Zorita, east of Madrid, Spain.

The power plant consisted of one single-loop PWR of 160 MWe, built by Zachry Construction Corporation for the Westinghouse Electric Company. It was operated by Unión Fenosa.

==History==
Construction of the power station started in 1964. It was commissioned in 1968 to Zachry Construction Corporation, and it operated from 1968 until 2006. In 2006, it was closed by ministerial order.

On 11 February 2010, Unión Fenosa transferred the site&#x27;s ownership to Enresa, a Spanish company responsible for decommissioning the power station. Enresa planned to clear the site by the end of 2015.

In 2010, Westinghouse won a contract to dismantle the reactor internals, and another contract in 2013 to dismantle the reactor pressure vessel. In November 2019, dismantling of the containment building began, and by June 2022 the turbine building was also dismantled. By September 2023, the containment building void was filled with of soil. A final phase of site clean-up and testing will be carried out before declaration of the end of decommissioning.

==2003 incident==
The Spanish Nuclear Safety Council has investigated the plant&#x27;s deficient safety system and a missing screw that prevented the reactor from resuming operations after a month-long refueling operation in December 2003.

<text>Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks (June 7, 1917 – December 3, 2000) was an American poet, author, and teacher. Her work often dealt with the personal celebrations and struggles of ordinary people in her community. She won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry on May 1, 1950, for &quot;Annie Allen&quot;, making her the first African American to receive a Pulitzer Prize.

Throughout her prolific writing career, Brooks received many more honors. A lifelong resident of Chicago, she was appointed Poet Laureate of Illinois in 1968, a position she held until her death 32 years later. She was also named the U.S. Poet Laureate for the 1985–86 term. In 1976, she became the first African-American woman inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

== Early life ==
Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks was born on June 7, 1917, in Topeka, Kansas, and was raised on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois. She was the first child of David Anderson Brooks and Keziah (Wims) Brooks. Her father, a janitor for a music company, had hoped to pursue a career as a doctor but sacrificed that aspiration to support getting married and raising a family. Her mother was a school teacher as well as a concert pianist trained in classical music. Brooks&#x27; mother had taught at the Topeka school that later became involved in the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; racial desegregation case. Family lore held that Brooks&#x27; paternal grandfather had escaped slavery to join the Union forces during the American Civil War.

When Brooks was six weeks old, her family moved to Chicago during the Great Migration, and from then on, Chicago remained her home. She would closely identify with Chicago for the rest of her life. In a 1994 interview, she remarked:

Living in the city, I wrote differently than I would have if I had been raised in Topeka, KS ... I am an organic Chicagoan. Living there has given me a multiplicity of characters to aspire for. I hope to live there the rest of my days. That&#x27;s my headquarters.

Brooks started her formal education at Forestville Elementary School on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. She then attended a prestigious integrated high school in the city with a predominantly white student body, Hyde Park High School; transferred to the all-black Wendell Phillips High School; and finished her schooling at integrated Englewood High School.

According to biographer Kenny Jackson Williams, due to the social dynamics of the various schools, in conjunction with the era in which she attended them, Brooks faced much racial injustice. Over time, this experience helped her understand the prejudice and bias in established systems and dominant institutions, not only in her own surroundings but in every relevant American mindset.

Brooks began writing at an early age and her mother encouraged her, saying: &quot;You are going to be the lady Paul Laurence Dunbar.&quot; During her teenage years, she began filling books with &quot;careful rhymes&quot; and &quot;lofty meditations&quot;, as well as submitting poems to various publications. Her first poem was published in &quot;American Childhood&quot; when she was 13. By the time she had graduated from high school in 1935, she was already a regular contributor to &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;.

After her early educational experiences, Brooks did not pursue a four-year college degree because she knew she wanted to be a writer and considered it unnecessary. &quot;I am not a scholar,&quot; she later said. &quot;I&#x27;m just a writer who loves to write and will always write.&quot; She graduated in 1936 from a two-year program at Wilson Junior College, now known as Kennedy-King College, and at first worked as a typist to support herself while she pursued her career.

==Career==
===Writing===
Brooks published her first poem, &quot;Eventide&quot;, in a children&#x27;s magazine, &quot;American Childhood&quot;, when she was 13 years old. By the age of 16, she had already written and published approximately 75 poems. At 17, she started submitting her work to &quot;Lights and Shadows&quot;, the poetry column of the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot;, an African-American newspaper. Her poems, many published while she attended Wilson Junior College, ranged in style from traditional ballads and sonnets to poems using blues rhythms in free verse. In her early years, she received commendations on her poetic work and encouragement from James Weldon Johnson, Richard Wright and Langston Hughes. James Weldon Johnson sent her the first critique of her poems when she was only 16 years old.

Her characters were often drawn from the inner-city life that Brooks knew well. She said, &quot;I lived in a small second-floor apartment at the corner, and I could look first on one side and then the other. There was my material.&quot;

By 1941, Brooks was taking part in poetry workshops. A particularly influential one was organized by Inez Cunningham Stark, an affluent white woman with a strong literary background. Stark offered writing workshops at the new South Side Community Art Center, which Brooks attended. It was here she gained momentum in finding her voice and a deeper knowledge of the techniques of her predecessors. Renowned poet Langston Hughes stopped by the workshop and heard her read &quot;The Ballad of Pearl May Lee&quot;. In 1944, she achieved a goal she had been pursuing through continued unsolicited submissions since she was 14 years old: two of her poems were published in &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine&#x27;s November issue. In the autobiographical information she provided to the magazine, she described her occupation as a &quot;housewife&quot;.

Brooks&#x27; published her first book of poetry, &quot;A Street in Bronzeville&quot; (1945), with Harper &amp; Brothers, after a strong show of support to the publisher from author Richard Wright. It consists of a series of poems related the lives of African Americans in the Chicago neighborhood. Wright said to the editors who solicited his opinion on Brooks&#x27; work:

There is no self-pity here, not a striving for effects. She takes hold of reality as it is and renders it faithfully. ... She easily catches the pathos of petty destinies; the whimper of the wounded; the tiny accidents that plague the lives of the desperately poor, and the problem of color prejudice among Negroes.
The book earned instant critical acclaim for its authentic and textured portraits of life in Bronzeville. Brooks later said it was a glowing review by Paul Engle in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that &quot;initiated My Reputation&quot;. Engle stated that Brooks&#x27; poems were no more &quot;Negro poetry&quot; than Robert Frost&#x27;s work was &quot;white poetry&quot;. Brooks received her first Guggenheim Fellowship in 1946 and was included as one of the &quot;Ten Young Women of the Year&quot; in &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; magazine.

Brooks&#x27; second book of poetry, &quot;Annie Allen&quot; (1949), focused on the life and experiences of a young Black girl growing into womanhood in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. The book was awarded the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for poetry, and was also awarded &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine&#x27;s Eunice Tietjens Prize.

In 1953, Brooks published her first and only narrative book, a novella titled &quot;Maud Martha,&quot; which is a series of 34 vignettes about the experience of black women entering adulthood, consistent with the themes of her previous works. &quot;Maud Martha&quot; follows the life of a black woman named Maud Martha Brown as she moves about life from childhood to adulthood. It tells the story of &quot;a woman with doubts about herself and where and how she fits into the world. Maud&#x27;s concern is not so much that she is inferior but that she is perceived as being ugly,&quot; states author Harry B. Shaw in his book &quot;Gwendolyn Brooks.&quot; Maud suffers prejudice and discrimination not only from white individuals but also from black individuals who have lighter skin tones than hers, something that is a direct reference to Brooks&#x27; personal experience. Eventually, Maud stands up for herself by turning her back on a patronizing and racist store clerk. &quot;The book is ... about the triumph of the lowly,&quot; Shaw comments. In contrast, literary scholar Mary Helen Washington emphasizes Brooks&#x27;s critique of racism and sexism, calling &quot;Maud Martha&quot; &quot;a novel about bitterness, rage, self-hatred, and the silence that results from suppressed anger&quot;.

In 1967, the year of Langston Hughes&#x27;s death, Brooks attended the Second Black Writers&#x27; Conference at Nashville&#x27;s Fisk University. Here, according to one version of events, she met activists and artists such as Imamu Amiri Baraka, Don L. Lee and others who exposed her to new black cultural nationalism. Recent studies argue that she had been involved in leftist politics in Chicago for many years and, under the pressures of McCarthyism, adopted a black nationalist posture as a means of distancing herself from her prior political connections. Brooks&#x27;s experience at the conference inspired many of her subsequent literary activities. She taught creative writing to some of Chicago&#x27;s Blackstone Rangers, otherwise a violent criminal gang. In 1968, she published one of her most famous works, &quot;In the Mecca&quot;, a long poem about a mother&#x27;s search for her lost child in a Chicago apartment building. The poem was nominated for the National Book Award for poetry.

Her autobiographical &quot;Report From Part One&quot;, including reminiscences, interviews, photographs and vignettes, came out in 1972, and &quot;Report From Part Two&quot; was published in 1995, when she was almost 80. Her other works include &quot;Primer for Blacks&quot; (1980), &quot;Young Poet’s Primer&quot; (1980), &quot;To Disembark&quot; (1981), &quot;The Near-Johannesburg Boy, and Other Poems&quot; (1986), &quot;Blacks&quot; (1987), &quot;Winnie&quot; (1988), and &quot;Children Coming Home&quot; (1991).

===Teaching===
Brooks said her first teaching experience was at the University of Chicago when she was invited by author Frank London Brown to teach a course in American literature. It was the beginning of her lifelong commitment to sharing poetry and teaching writing. Brooks taught extensively around the country and held posts at Columbia College Chicago, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago State University, Elmhurst College, Columbia University, and the City College of New York.

===Archives===
The Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library of the University of Illinois acquired Brooks&#x27;s archives from her daughter Nora Blakely. In addition, the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley has a collection of her personal papers, especially from 1950 to 1989.

==Family life==
In 1939, Brooks married Henry Lowington Blakely, Jr., whom she met after joining Chicago&#x27;s NAACP Youth Council. They had two children: Henry Lowington Blakely III, and Nora Brooks Blakely. Brooks&#x27; husband died in 1996.

From mid-1961 to late 1964, Henry III served in the U.S. Marine Corps, first at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego and then at Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay. During this time, Brooks mentored her son&#x27;s fiancée, Kathleen Hardiman, in writing poetry. Upon his return, Blakely and Hardiman married in 1965. Brooks had so enjoyed the mentoring relationship that she began to engage more frequently in that role with the new generation of young black poets.

Gwendolyn Brooks died at her Chicago home on December 3, 2000, aged 83. She is buried in Lincoln Cemetery.

<text>Contrabass (from ) refers to several musical instruments of very low pitch—generally one octave below bass register instruments. While the term most commonly refers to the double bass (which is the bass instrument in the orchestral string family, tuned lower than the cello), many other instruments in the contrabass register exist.

The term &quot;contrabass&quot; is relative, usually denoting a very low-pitched instrument of its type, rather than one in a particular range. For example, the contrabass flute&#x27;s lowest note is approximately an octave higher than that of the contrabass clarinet. Instruments tuned below contrabass instruments, such as the double contrabass flute or subcontrabass saxophone, may be referred to as &quot;double contrabass,&quot; &quot;triple contrabass,&quot; &quot;subcontrabass,&quot; or &quot;octocontrabass&quot; instruments. On the other hand, the &quot;contrabass&quot; classification often includes such instruments.

<doc id="412285" wikidata="Q629118" url="?curid=412285" title="Fitness function">
<text>A fitness function is a particular type of objective or cost function that is used to summarize, as a single figure of merit, how close a given candidate solution is to achieving the set aims. It is an important component of evolutionary algorithms (EA), such as genetic programming, evolution strategies or genetic algorithms. An EA is a metaheuristic that reproduces the basic principles of biological evolution as a computer algorithm in order to solve challenging optimization or planning tasks, at least approximately. For this purpose, many candidate solutions are generated, which are evaluated using a fitness function in order to guide the evolutionary development towards the desired goal. Similar quality functions are also used in other metaheuristics, such as ant colony optimization or particle swarm optimization.

In the field of EAs, each candidate solution, also called an &quot;individual&quot;, is commonly represented as a string of numbers (referred to as a chromosome). After each round of testing or simulation the idea is to delete the &quot;n&quot; worst individuals, and to breed &quot;n&quot; new ones from the best solutions. Each individual must therefore to be assigned a quality number indicating how close it has come to the overall specification, and this is generated by applying the fitness function to the test or simulation results obtained from that candidate solution.

Two main classes of fitness functions exist: one where the fitness function does not change, as in optimizing a fixed function or testing with a fixed set of test cases; and one where the fitness function is mutable, as in niche differentiation or co-evolving the set of test cases. Another way of looking at fitness functions is in terms of a fitness landscape, which shows the fitness for each possible chromosome. In the following, it is assumed that the fitness is determined based on an evaluation that remains unchanged during an optimization run.

A fitness function does not necessarily have to be able to calculate an absolute value, as it is sometimes sufficient to compare candidates in order to select the better one. A relative indication of fitness (candidate a is better than b) is sufficient in some cases, such as tournament selection or Pareto optimization.

== Requirements of evaluation and fitness function ==
The quality of the evaluation and calculation of a fitness function is fundamental to the success of an EA optimisation. It implements Darwin&#x27;s principle of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. Without fitness-based selection mechanisms for mate selection and offspring acceptance, EA search would be blind and hardly distinguishable from the Monte Carlo method. When setting up a fitness function, one must always be aware that it is about more than just describing the desired target state. Rather, the evolutionary search on the way to the optimum should also be supported as much as possible (see also section on auxiliary objectives), if and insofar as this is not already done by the fitness function alone. If the fitness function is designed badly, the algorithm will either converge on an inappropriate solution, or will have difficulty converging at all.

Definition of the fitness function is not straightforward in many cases and often is performed iteratively if the fittest solutions produced by an EA is not what is desired. Interactive genetic algorithms address this difficulty by outsourcing evaluation to external agents which are normally humans.

==Computational efficiency==
The fitness function should not only correlate closely with the designer&#x27;s goal, but it also should be computationally efficient. Speed of execution is very important, as a typical evolutionary algorithm must be iterated many times in order to produce a usable result for a non-trivial problem.

Fitness approximation may be appropriate, especially in the following cases: 
* Fitness computation time of a single solution is extremely high 
* Precise model for fitness computation is missing
* The fitness function is uncertain or noisy.
Alternatively or also in addition to the fitness approximation, the fitness calculations can also be distributed to a parallel computer in order to reduce the execution times. Depending on the population model of the EA used, both the EA itself and the fitness calculations of all offspring of one generation can be executed in parallel.

== Multi-objective optimization ==
Practical applications usually aim at optimizing multiple and at least partially conflicting objectives. Two fundamentally different approaches are often used for this purpose, Pareto optimization and optimization based on fitness calculated using the weighted sum.

=== Weighted sum and penalty functions ===
When optimizing with the weighted sum, the single values of the formula_1 objectives are first normalized so that they can be compared. This can be done with the help of costs or by specifying target values and determining the current value as the degree of fulfillment. Costs or degrees of fulfillment can then be compared with each other and, if required, can also be mapped to a uniform fitness scale. Without loss of generality, fitness is assumed to represent a value to be maximized. Each objective formula_2 is assigned a weight formula_3 in the form of a percentage value so that the overall raw fitness formula_4 can be calculated as a weighted sum: formula_5 A violation of formula_6 restrictions formula_7 can be included in the fitness determined in this way in the form of penalty functions. For this purpose, a function formula_8 can be defined for each restriction which returns a value between formula_9 and formula_10 depending on the degree of violation, with the result being formula_10 if there is no violation. The previously determined raw fitness is multiplied by the penalty function(s) and the result is then the final fitness formula_12: formula_13 This approach is simple and has the advantage of being able to combine any number of objectives and restrictions. The disadvantage is that different objectives can compensate each other and that the weights have to be defined before the optimization. This means that the compromise lines must be defined before optimization, which is why optimization with the weighted sum is also referred to as the a priori method. In addition, certain solutions may not be obtained, see the section on the &quot;comparison of both types of optimization&quot;.

=== Pareto optimization ===
A solution is called Pareto-optimal if the improvement of one objective is only possible with a deterioration of at least one other objective. The set of all Pareto-optimal solutions, also called Pareto set, represents the set of all optimal compromises between the objectives. The figure below on the right shows an example of the Pareto set of two objectives formula_14 and formula_15 to be maximized. The elements of the set form the Pareto front (green line). From this set, a human decision maker must subsequently select the desired compromise solution. Constraints are included in Pareto optimization in that solutions without constraint violations are per se better than those with violations. If two solutions to be compared each have constraint violations, the respective extent of the violations decides.

It was recognized early on that EAs with their simultaneously considered solution set are well suited to finding solutions in one run that cover the Pareto front sufficiently well. They are therefore well suited as a-posteriori methods for multi-objective optimization, in which the final decision is made by a human decision maker after optimization and determination of the Pareto front. Besides the SPEA2, the NSGA-II and NSGA-III have established themselves as standard methods.

The advantage of Pareto optimization is that, in contrast to the weighted sum, it provides all alternatives that are equivalent in terms of the objectives as an overall solution. The disadvantage is that a visualization of the alternatives becomes problematic or even impossible from four objectives on. Furthermore, the effort increases exponentially with the number of objectives. If there are more than three or four objectives, some have to be combined using the weighted sum or other aggregation methods.

=== Comparison of both types of assessment ===
With the help of the weighted sum, the total Pareto front can be obtained by a suitable choice of weights, provided that it is convex. This is illustrated by the adjacent picture on the left. The point formula_16 on the green Pareto front is reached by the weights formula_17 and formula_18, provided that the EA converges to the optimum. The direction with the largest fitness gain in the solution set formula_19 is shown by the drawn arrows.

In case of a non-convex front, however, non-convex front sections are not reachable by the weighted sum. In the adjacent image on the right, this is the section between points formula_20 and formula_21. This can be remedied to a limited extent by using an extension of the weighted sum, the &quot;cascaded weighted sum&quot;.

Comparing both assessment approaches, the use of Pareto optimization is certainly advantageous when little is known about the possible solutions of a task and when the number of optimization objectives can be narrowed down to three, at most four. However, in the case of repeated optimization of variations of one and the same task, the desired lines of compromise are usually known and the effort to determine the entire Pareto front is no longer justified. This is also true when no human decision is desired or possible after optimization, such as in automated decision processes.

== Auxiliary objectives ==

In addition to the primary objectives resulting from the task itself, it may be necessary to include auxiliary objectives in the assessment to support the achievement of one or more primary objectives. An example of a scheduling task is used for illustration purposes. The optimization goals include not only a general fast processing of all orders but also the compliance with a latest completion time. The latter is especially necessary for the scheduling of rush orders. The second goal is not achieved by the exemplary initial schedule, as shown in the adjacent figure. A following mutation does not change this, but schedules the work step d earlier, which is a necessary intermediate step for an earlier start of the last work step e of the order. As long as only the latest completion time is evaluated, however, the fitness of the mutated schedule remains unchanged, even though it represents a relevant step towards the objective of a timely completion of the order. This can be remedied, for example, by an additional evaluation of the delay of work steps. The new objective is an auxiliary one, since it was introduced in addition to the actual optimization objectives to support their achievement. A more detailed description of this approach and another example can be found in.

<text>MoveOn (formerly known as MoveOn.org) is a progressive public policy advocacy group and political action committee. Formed in 1998 around one of the first massively viral email petitions, MoveOn has since grown into one of the largest and most impactful grassroots progressive campaigning communities in the United States, with a membership of millions. MoveOn did not endorse a candidate during the 2020 presidential primary campaign; it then endorsed and actively supported Joe Biden in the general election. MoveOn endorsed Kamala Harris, the then-current Vice President of the United States, as the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2024 presidential election. Rahna Epting has been Executive Director of MoveOn Civic Action and MoveOn Political Action since 2019.

== Structure ==

MoveOn comprises two legal entities, organized under different sections of U.S. tax and election laws. MoveOn.org Civic Action is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit corporation, and was formerly called &quot;MoveOn.org&quot;. It focuses on education and advocacy on national issues. MoveOn.org Political Action is a federal political action committee, and was formerly known as &quot;MoveOn PAC&quot;. It conducts a wide range of activities directly, and also contributes to the campaigns of many candidates across the country. MoveOn describes the legal structure of the Civic Action as that of &quot;a California nonprofit public-benefit corporation&quot; and the structure of MoveOn.org Political Action as that of &quot;a California nonprofit mutual benefit corporation,&quot; and refers to both corporations collectively as &quot;MoveOn&quot;.

On January 17, 2019, MoveOn announced that executive directors Anna Galland and Ilya Sheyman were departing in 2019 after 6 years of serving as co-executive directors from 2013 to 2019. On May 29, 2019, MoveOn further announced that its next executive director would be Rahna Epting. Her appointment took effect during the week of October 14, 2019. The president of MoveOn Civic Action&#x27;s board is former executive director Anna Galland. Past board members include co-founders Joan Blades, Wes Boyd, former executive director Eli Pariser, former executive director Justin Ruben, and former Chief Operating Officer Carrie Olson.

== History ==
MoveOn started in 1998 as an e-mail group, MoveOn.org, created by software entrepreneurs Joan Blades and Wes Boyd, the married cofounders of Berkeley Systems. They started by passing around a petition asking Congress to &quot;Censure President Clinton and Move On to Pressing Issues Facing the Nation&quot;, as opposed to impeaching him. The one-sentence petition, passed around by email, gathered half a million signatures, making it one of the first &quot;viral&quot; email-based petitions. It did not manage to dissuade the House of Representatives from impeaching the President. The couple went on to start similar campaigns calling for arms inspections rather than an invasion of Iraq, and campaign finance reform.

===Opposing Clinton&#x27;s impeachment===
The MoveOn.org domain name was registered on September 18, 1998, following the September 11, 1998, release of the Independent Counsel Starr Report. The MoveOn website was launched initially to oppose the Republican-led effort to impeach Clinton. Initially called &quot;Censure and Move On&quot;, it invited visitors to add their names to an online petition stating that &quot;Congress must Immediately Censure President Clinton and Move On to pressing issues facing the country.&quot;

The founders were computer entrepreneurs Joan Blades and Wes Boyd, the married cofounders of Berkeley Systems, an entertainment software company known for the flying toaster screen saver and the popular video game series &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot;. After selling the company in 1997, Blades and Boyd became concerned about the level of &quot;partisan warfare in Washington&quot; following revelations of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s affair with Monica Lewinsky.

At the time of MoveOn&#x27;s public launch on September 24, it appeared likely that its petition would be dwarfed by the effort to oust Clinton. A reporter who interviewed Blades on the day after the launch wrote, &quot;A quick search on Yahoo turns up no sites for &#x27;censure Clinton&#x27; but 20 sites for &#x27;impeach Clinton, adding that Scott Lauf&#x27;s impeachclinton.org website had already delivered 60,000 petitions to Congress. Google Groups Salon.com reported that Arianna Huffington, then a right-wing commentator, had collected 13,303 names on her website, resignation.com, which called on Clinton to resign.

Within a week, support for MoveOn had grown. Blades called herself an &quot;accidental activist&quot; and said: &quot;We put together a one-sentence petition. ... We sent it to under a hundred of our friends and family, and within a week we had a hundred thousand people sign the petition. At that point, we thought it was going to be a flash campaign, that we would help everyone connect with leadership in all the ways we could figure out, and then get back to our regular lives. A half a million people ultimately signed and we somehow never got back to our regular lives.&quot; MoveOn also recruited 2,000 volunteers to deliver the petitions in person to members of the House of Representatives in 219 districts across America, and directed 30,000 phone calls to district offices.

According to Blades, &quot;Then two weeks after the November 1998 election, Congress went ahead and voted to impeach. When you become active in the system and communicate to your representatives, and they don&#x27;t vote in accordance with your values, your next responsibility is to support candidates who will. All of a sudden we were signed up until 2000.&quot; In response to the impeachment vote, MoveOn launched a &quot;We will remember&quot; campaign, asking its members to sign a pledge that &quot;we will work to defeat Members of Congress who voted for impeachment or removal. To give substance to this pledge, we are also pledging, today, our maximum possible dollar contribution to opposing candidates in the year 2000.&quot;

In early 1999, MoveOn continued to pursue a bipartisan appeal, recruiting GOP moderate Larry Rockefeller, a New York environmental attorney and heir to the Rockefeller fortune, as the public face of a &quot;Republican Move On&quot; aimed at mobilizing anti-impeachment Republicans. As the 2000 elections neared, however, the organization gravitated toward the Democratic Party. 1999 also marked MoveOn&#x27;s first foray into issues other than Clinton&#x27;s impeachment. Following the shootings at Columbine High School near Littleton, Colorado, Blades and Boyd launched a &quot;Gun Safety First&quot; petition to promote the &quot;common sense regulation of firearms&quot;, such as child safety standards for gun manufacturers and laws forcing gun-show operators to enact more-stringent background checks on buyers.

===Creation of MoveOn PAC===
In June 1999, MoveOn established its own political action committee, the MoveOn PAC, with the ability to accept contributions online via credit card. It was not the first organization to fundraise online for political candidates, but its success was unprecedented, raising $250,000 in its first five days of operation and $2 million over the course of the 2000 election to help elect four new Senators and five new House members. &quot;That may not seem like a lot of money to most people, but it was a revolution in fundraising for campaigns from average citizens,&quot; Blades said. According to Michael Cornfield, director of the Democracy On Line Project at George Washington University, MoveOn&#x27;s achievement created &quot;a change in attitude&quot; in the political fundraising community. &quot;It is like a bell has gone off,&quot; he said. &quot;The race is on. &#x27;Let&#x27;s raise money online.&#x27;&quot; He compared MoveOn&#x27;s achievement with the pioneering of direct-mail fundraising in the 1970s by conservative fundraisers such as Richard Viguerie.

The most significant innovation was MoveOn&#x27;s success at raising funds from small donors, with an average contribution size of $35. Prior to the Internet, small-donor fundraising was prohibitively expensive, as costs of printing and postage ate up most of the money raised. By comparison, MoveOn&#x27;s fundraising costs were minimal, with credit card transaction fees constituting their biggest expense. &quot;If candidates can use the Internet to raise significant funds through small donations and attract and organize volunteers at relatively little cost and labor, it could radically alter the balance of power in politics,&quot; observed political reporter Joan Loawy. &quot;Suddenly candidates with fewer resources are more viable and the clout of moneyed special interests is diminished.&quot;

The $2 million that MoveOn raised, however, was substantially less than the $13 million that its members had pledged they would give to defeat Republicans when passions were running high over the Clinton impeachment. According to Mike Fraioli, a Washington-based fundraiser for Democratic candidates, MoveOn missed an opportunity by waiting until the impeachment hearings were over before it began trying to collect campaign contributions. &quot;Never let your pledges hang out there,&quot; Fraoli said. &quot;Things change, the world changes. All the emotion that existed a year ago no longer exists today.&quot;

The 2000 elections also saw MoveOn&#x27;s first effort at web-based voter registration with the launch of votepledge.org. It also weighted in regarding the 2000 presidential election, warning its members that voting for Ralph Nader could throw the election to George W. Bush. &quot;Many (Nader supporters) say they never got into the race to play the spoiler,&quot; said an email message from Wes Boyd. &quot;What was positioned as a safe protest vote has now become a kind of kamikaze vote.&quot;

===Development of ActionForum.com===
In January 2000, MoveOn rolled out ActionForum.com, an Internet discussion forum designed to solicit public involvement in policymaking. &quot;Unlike most chat rooms, in which the loudest voices often rule, the site allows members to rank the comments they respect,&quot; explained the &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot;. &quot;Those with the highest rankings move to the top. ... ActionForum aims to be an Internet chat room with accountability. In a typical chat room, users sign on anonymously. On ActionForum, users are required to address their letters with their real names, as well as their profession and city of residence.&quot; As a test subject for the new chat form, Blades and Boyd chose one of the most controversial issues for 2000 in their hometown of Berkeley, California: a draft revision of the Berkeley General Plan, a document that aims to set the city&#x27;s goals for everything from zoning laws to transportation, housing and community safety. The forum was initially greeted with enthusiasm by city government officials as an online means of soliciting community feedback. Blades and Boyd also supported the Berkeley Party, which attempted to build a political platform for the city centered around the ActionForum, with &quot;no back room deals, no insiders,&quot; making it &quot;unlike another political party in the world.&quot; The ActionForum.com never really caught on with Berkeley residents, and efforts to use it for municipal purposes were abandoned in 2001. In the meantime, however, it became an important vehicle through which MoveOn received advice and suggestions from its own members.

In March 2001, MoveOn joined forces with the nonprofit advocacy site Generation Net, an online advocacy organization headed by Peter Schurman. He became MoveOn&#x27;s first full-time, salaried executive director, taking on administrative tasks that until then had been performed on a volunteer basis by Blades and Boyd. Issues prioritized by MoveOn in 2001 included support for the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance reform bill, environmental protection and opposition to the Bush administration&#x27;s proposal to abolish estate taxes for the wealthy. MoveOn also responded to electrical blackouts and skyrocketing energy costs in California by calling for cost controls on electricity utility companies, organizing a nationwide &quot;roll your own energy blackout&quot; - a voluntary, three-hour electricity-free evening on June 21, in which more than 10,000 participants turned out lights and unplugged TVs and other appliances to protest Bush&#x27;s energy plan.

===Anti-war organizing===
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, MoveOn launched an online campaign calling for &quot;justice, not escalating violence.&quot; It collected 30,000 signers for a statement that argued: &quot;To combat terrorism, we must act in accordance with a high standard that does not disregard the lives of people in other countries. If we retaliate by bombing Kabul and kill people oppressed by the Taliban dictatorship who have no part in deciding whether terrorists are harbored, we become like the terrorists we oppose. We perpetuate the cycle of retribution and recruit more terrorists by creating martyrs.&quot; Eventually, this led to them working on behalf of Eli Pariser&#x27;s similar 9-11peace.org petition. Pariser later joined MoveOn as its executive director. This led to a period of substantial growth and increased visibility for the organization.

During the buildup to the invasion of Iraq, MoveOn began running a multi-front campaign opposing the war. Activities included anti-war petitions calling for &quot;No War on Iraq&quot;. In July 2002, Executive Director Eli Pariser urged its members to oppose the war by sending letters to the editor of their local newspapers, offering sample form letters that members could use. Several of these form-based letters were printed in newspapers including the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;, the &quot;Claremont Courier&quot;, and the &quot;Times Herald-Record&quot; of Middletown, NY.

On August 17, 2002, MoveOn launched an online petition against the war, collecting 220,000 signatures in two months. As it had done with the petition against Clinton&#x27;s impeachment, it organized volunteers who hand-delivered the signatures to senators and representatives before the congressional vote on the war powers resolution. In October 2002, a MoveOn fundraising appeal raised $1 million in two days&#x27; time for what it called four &quot;heroes of the anti-war effort&quot; in Congress who opposed the Iraq resolution: Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, representatives Rick Larsen and Jay Inslee of Washington, and Representative Rush D. Holt Jr. of New Jersey. However, MoveOn also worked to raise money for Democratic candidates who supported the Iraq resolution, some of whom were locked in tight races in moderate or conservative states, including Senator Jean Carnahan of Missouri, and Senate candidates Ron Kirk in Texas, Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, Tim Johnson in South Dakota and Mark Pryor in Arkansas. All told, it raised $3.5 million for the 2002 election cycle.

In September 2002, it issued a bulletin by Susan Thompson, &quot;Selling the War on Iraq&quot;, offering &quot;lessons in PR from previous wars&quot; and warning that &quot;the costs of regime change&quot; would &quot;cost a whopping $200 billion&quot;. MoveOn predicted that &quot;regular people will probably have to foot the bill&quot; while anyone with ties to the oil companies will probably profit immensely.&quot;

MoveOn also joined with 14 other organization to form the Win Without War coalition, which also included the National Council of Churches, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the National Organization for Women. Win Without War in turn helped organize Artists United to Win Without War, a group of more than 100 anti-war actors, producers and directors from Hollywood. In December 2002, MoveOn launched another petition, titled &quot;Let the Inspections Work&quot;, with the goal of raising $40,000 to pay for a full-page anti-war appeal in the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Instead, its members sent in nearly $400,000. With the additional funds, it sponsored anti-war radio spots and TV ads in 13 major cities. Modeled after the famous &quot;Daisy&quot; ad from Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign against Barry Goldwater, the TV ads warned that war with Iraq could spark nuclear armageddon. According to an account in the Los Angeles Times, &quot;To generate buzz - essentially free advertising - for its own antiwar television spot, MoveOn.org hired Fenton Communications, the same company that promoted Arianna Huffington&#x27;s recent anti-SUV ads. ... A week after its TV ad first appeared on the news, MoveOn.org reported that its membership had grown by 100,000. The ad was covered on virtually every major network. It was shown and discussed on news programs in Australia, Pakistan, Russia and Japan. The tally is ongoing, but the ad generated at least 110 television news stories and dozens in print, according to an Interim Media Coverage Report by Fenton Communications.&quot; It also attempted to place anti-war advertisements on the sides of buildings, billboards and buses but was thwarted when Viacom, which owns the largest outdoor-advertising entity in North America, refused to run the ads.

By early 2003, MoveOn boasted more than 750,000 members in the United States and hundreds of thousands more overseas. As war in Iraq neared, its member base grew and the pace of its activities accelerated. Whereas the Nexis/Lexis news database recorded 155 mentions of MoveOn in 2002, in 2003 there were 2,226 mentions. In January 2003, more than 9,000 of its members, organized into small delegations, visited more than 400 home offices of U.S. senators and representatives across the nation to present the petitions in person. In February 2003, MoveOn teamed up with Win Without War to sponsor a &quot;virtual march on Washington&quot; that generated more than 1 million phone calls and faxes to politicians opposing the invasion.

In June 2003, two months after the Pentagon declared an end to &quot;major combat operations in Iraq,&quot; MoveOn teamed up again with Win Without War to purchase a full-page ad in the &quot;New York Times&quot; that labeled Bush a &quot;misleader&quot; and demanded an independent commission to determine the truth about US intelligence on Iraq, declaring, &quot;It would be a tragedy if young men and women were sent to die for a lie.&quot;

In 2007, MoveOn organized the anti-war lobbying coalition Americans Against Escalation in Iraq.

===Virtual primary for the 2004 presidential election===
In June 2003, MoveOn held what it called &quot;the first online primary of the modern age&quot;, and Howard Dean won a plurality of 44 percent of the vote, with 139,360 votes. The methodology of the primary, however, attracted criticism from a staff member of the Richard A. &quot;Dick&quot; Gephardt campaign, who complained of &quot;vote-rigging&quot; because only three of the Democratic primary candidates—Dean, John Kerry, and Dennis Kucinich—had been invited to send detailed messages to MoveOn members in advance of the online voting. MoveOn called the Gephardt charge &quot;absurd&quot;, stating that Dean, Kerry and Kucinich &quot;were chosen by MoveOn members&quot; and that their candidate emails included &quot;links to the sites of ALL the other 6 candidates. ... The Gephardt campaign, and all others, were made fully aware of this process from the beginning, and chose to participate. The process was not changed. 96% of MoveOn respondents voted to endorse the selection process.&quot;

An opinion piece for the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that MoveOn&#x27;s &quot;effort is more extensive than most—enthusiasts clicked on for the two-day primary that drew more than 300,000 voters. The virtual tally—results of which were not expected until today [Friday, June 27, 2003, at noon]—would top the combined turnouts in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina in 2000.

There were complaints about some of MoveOn&#x27;s electioneering strictures. After coming into being with an internet petition against President Bill Clinton&#x27;s impeachment, MoveOn has become an electronic precinct machine, steadily attracting more than one million enrolled members with criticisms of the George W. Bush administration and quietly raising more than $7 million for Democratic candidates. If a contender can draw at least 50 percent in the elbow-throwing field, the result will mean a formal endorsement with money and volunteers to follow.

===Take Back the White House Campaign===
In April 2004, MoveOn organized a “Take Back the White House&quot; campaign, which included 1,100 bake sales across the U.S., rallied 500,000 volunteers, and raised $750,000 for ads targeting Bush&#x27;s military record.

===&quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;===
In June 2004, MoveOn organized a response to criticism of Michael Moore&#x27;s controversial film, &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, calling on its members to send supportive emails to movie theaters. More than 110,000 MoveOn members pledged to go see the film once it opened. According to MoveOn&#x27;s Eli Pariser, its influence on moviegoer turnout may be even larger than that number suggests. &quot;When I went to Waterville, Maine and asked how many people from MoveOn were there, probably three-quarters of the people there said yes,&quot; Pariser told &quot;Variety&quot;.

MoveOn also organized nearly 3,000 &quot;Turn Up the Heat&quot; house parties on the Monday following its first weekend in theaters. Attendees listened via Internet hookup and participated via a live online map-based town hall application in a 30-minute talk by Moore and MoveOn organizers, and then signed up to participate in voter-registration drives and other activities aimed at unseating Bush and other Republicans in the November 2004 U.S. elections.

=== 2006 &quot;Call for Change&quot; Campaign ===
In preparation for the 2006 midterm elections, MoveOn created a new system for soliciting potential voters named Call for Change. As part of the Call for Change effort, MoveOn reported that it placed over seven million phone calls to registered voters.

===Facebook and Beacon===
In November 2007, a drive spearheaded by MoveOn caused Facebook to change its controversial new Beacon program, which notified Facebook users about purchases by people on their friends list. The Facebook group &quot;Petition: Facebook, stop invading my privacy!&quot; had over 54,000 members at the time the announcement was made that Facebook was changing Beacon to an opt-in system.

===2008 presidential endorsement===
On February 1, 2008, MoveOn announced it had endorsed Senator Barack Obama, rather than Senator Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, in the 2008 presidential election. MoveOn said it had never endorsed a presidential candidate before. MoveOn also launched a television advertisement critical of John McCain, Obama&#x27;s Republican opponent for the presidency. The ad was titled &quot;Not Alex&quot; and featured a young mother telling McCain that she would not allow her young son to be sent to Iraq.

=== 2016 election efforts ===
==== Run Warren Run ====
In December 2014, MoveOn.org began their campaign to get Senator Elizabeth Warren to run to be the 45th president of the United States. MoveOn.org&#x27;s plan to get Warren to run for office included getting their large base of supporters to sign a petition urging Warren to run, spending roughly a million dollars on television advertisements in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that kicked off the presidential nomination process, and creating a website called &quot;Run Warren Run&quot;. When asked about the &quot;Run Warren Run&quot; campaign, Ilya Sheyman, MoveOn.org&#x27;s executive director, made it clear that the mindset behind the campaign was to show Warren that there was a path for her to the presidency and that there was a substantial amount of grass-roots energy in key states that would support her if she chose to do so. By the end of the campaign, MoveOn.org got 365,000 signatures showing support for Warren and had planned, organized, and executed over 400 events. In the end, Warren did not run for the 2016 presidency.

==== Support for Bernie Sanders ====
After failing to get Senator Warren to run for the presidency, MoveOn.org chose to back Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) after 78% of its membership voted in favor of him rather than Hillary Clinton or Martin O&#x27;Malley. Ilya Sheyman claimed that Bernie Sanders&#x27; consistent fortitude in regards to standing up to big money and corporate interests really resonated with their members.

Democratic candidates were invited to participate in an online forum, which involved the candidates answering questions submitted by MoveOn members via video. Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O&#x27;Malley agreed.

MoveOn endorsed Senator Sanders for President of the United States after holding online elections in which 340,665 members reportedly cast their ballot. 78.6% of these supported the Junior Senator from Vermont, while 14.6% and 0.9% threw themselves behind Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Former Maryland Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley, respectively.

==== United Against Hate ====
In response to the rhetoric of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election, MoveOn ran a general-election campaign in 2016 under the headline &quot;United Against Hate&quot; which hired dozens of organizers in key battleground states and utilized volunteer-to-voter contact, digital advertising, video production, and cultural organizing to try to affect the outcome of the election. Celebrity supporters of this effort included Shonda Rhimes, Kerry Washington, Julianne Moore, Macklemore, and Neil Patrick Harris. It has taken credit for helping to promote the 2016 Donald Trump Chicago rally protest, and for paying for printing protest signs and a banner. The goal of the campaign was to stop Trump, whom MoveOn viewed as a &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;divisive&quot; leader. Trump went on to win the 2016 presidential election.

===Organizing as part of the Anti-Trump Resistance ===
MoveOn organized its first protest of the Trump era on the day after the election in 2016, when it called for protests of &quot;solidarity, resilience, and resolve,&quot; resulting in protests organized in under 24 hours in a number of cities. It was active in leading protests against the Trump agenda and Trump&#x27;s rhetoric for all four years of his presidency, including pushing for his impeachment, working to block legislative priorities like the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and defending the functions of democracy, including serving as one of the organizations most active in the Nobody Is Above The Law coalition, which organized grassroots events to press for the release of the Mueller report. MoveOn helped organize a range of grassroots mobilizations pushing back on Trump&#x27;s actions, including the 2019 Presidents Day protest. MoveOn was one of the most active organizations in the anti-Trump movement.

====2018 &quot;Families Belong Together&quot; Mobilization ====
MoveOn was one of the leading organizations that called for and supported protests around the country in summer 2018 to respond to the Trump Administration&#x27;s introduction of immigrant family separation at the US–Mexico border. In over 750 cities, ranging from very large cities to much smaller towns and rural areas, hundreds of thousands of people marched to protest the Trump Administration policy.

====2018 Midterm Election Program ====
MoveOn ran a major grassroots and digital campaign to influence the outcome of the 2018 midterms, and to help elect Democrats and defeat Republicans in order to flip the House. One signature program was Real Voter Voices, an effort aimed at persuading voters to cast their ballots for Democrats by collecting and distributing selfie videos made by MoveOn members all over the country. MoveOn was one of the top spenders on Facebook ads in the weeks running up to the 2018 election.

===2019 campaign to impeach Donald Trump===
Following the April 2019 release of the Mueller report, the MoveOn website launched an initiative to support the Democrat-led effort to impeach Trump, saying &quot;censure does not go far enough. It doesn&#x27;t have any teeth to it.&quot; This position was notable because MoveOn was created to encourage congress to &quot;move on&quot; during the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal and not impeach President Clinton.

===2019 leadership change===
On January 17, 2019, MoveOn announced that executive directors Anna Galland and Ilya Sheyman would depart in 2019 after 6 years of leadership.

On May 29, 2019, MoveOn further announced that its next executive director would be Rahna Epting, the first person of color to lead the organization. Born to African-American and Iranian parents, she has held senior roles in organizations including Service Employees International Union, Every Voice, Wellstone Action, and the Alliance For Youth Organizing. At MoveOn she held a number of senior roles in the 2 years leading to this appointment. On October 17, 2019, MoveOn announced that Epting has assumed the role of executive director.

=== 2020 election campaign ===
MoveOn&#x27;s 2020 election campaign aimed to &quot;Mobilize, Inspire, and Protect&quot; the vote.

== Communication methods ==
MoveOn uses a wide range of methods to communicate with, organize, and mobilize its millions of members, including email, SMS messages, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, videos distributed through various online platforms, and field organizing strategies including leadership training.

MoveOn has advertised in new and traditional media formats, with publicity strategies including billboards, digital ads, bus signs, and bumper stickers.

MoveOn has collaborated with groups in organizing street demonstrations, bake sales, house parties, and other opportunities.

Changes in federal election laws have impacted groups like MoveOn. The McCain–Feingold campaign finance reform legislation, which went into effect in 2002, allows political parties to raise larger amounts of &quot;hard money&quot; contributions, but bans unlimited &quot;soft money&quot; contributions to the national political parties and prohibits federal officeholders from soliciting soft money. MoveOn, like many other political organizations which sought to influence the 2004 election, was able to circumvent this legislation using a 527 group, which became inactive in 2005 and closed in 2008.

On May 16, 2011, MoveOn.org debuted SignOn.org, a non-profit hosting service for Internet petitions, and in 2013, SignOn.org became MoveOn Petitions.

== Model ==
=== Internationalization of the MoveOn model ===
From the start, MoveOn.org&#x27;s model was able to combine net activism with meaningful political activism. As MoveOn.org developed its presence within politics into the one that it has today, the model and structure that they developed became desirable to other organizations who face similar challenges. One person who aided in the internationalization of the MoveOn Model is MoveOn.org&#x27;s former advocacy director, Ben Brandzel. In 2007 after leaving MoveOn to work on John Edwards presidential campaign, Brandzel headed to Australia to help a young Internet driven group called GetUp! According to their website, GetUp! is &quot;an independent movement to build a progressive Australia and bring participation back into [their] democracy.&quot; When Brandzel arrived in Australia to help GetUp!, he realized that GetUp! was facing similar opportunities and challenges to MoveOn.org. Brandzel then helped GetUp! implement similar structure and campaigns as MoveOn.org and they were able to achieve results at a rate that he says were &quot;three times the pace of MoveOn in the U.S.&quot; From this, he concluded that the success MoveOn.org achieved was not a fluke, rather it was a model that could be applied to different scenarios and could help other organizations achieve similar results in regards to net and political activism. MoveOn.org&#x27;s model helped shape and mold GetUp!&#x27;s organizational leadership in online campaigning, the communication within the organization, and their theory on how to create concrete political change.

== Criticism ==
MoveOn was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League, among others, when a member-submitted advertisement which drew parallels between President George W. Bush and Adolf Hitler was submitted to their online ad contest &quot;Bush in 30 Seconds&quot;. The ad was part of an online MoveOn-sponsored contest during the 2004 presidential election in which members were invited to create and submit political ads challenging President Bush and his administration. The ad was quickly pulled off the website.

Fox News criticized the organization after it successfully encouraged the 2008 Democratic presidential candidates not to attend two debates sponsored by the network. Fox News advisor David Rhodes and the network&#x27;s commentators Sean Hannity and Bill O&#x27;Reilly have also made accusations that MoveOn.org &quot;owns&quot; the Democratic Party and George Soros &quot;owns&quot; MoveOn.org.

Google and MoveOn have been accused of selective adherence to trademark law for removing ads from Google AdWords for Senator Susan Collins, citing infringement of MoveOn trademarks. &quot;Wired&quot; stated on October 15, 2007, that the &quot;left-leaning political advocacy group, MoveOn.org, is backing down&quot; and will allow Google to show the ads. MoveOn.org communications director Jennifer Lindenauer said: &quot;We don&#x27;t want to support a policy that denies people freedom of expression.&quot;

On June 17, 2008, MoveOn emailed its members stating that it had produced &quot;the most effective TV ad we&#x27;ve ever created.&quot; The ad depicts a mother telling Republican senator and presumptive nominee John McCain that she will not let him use her infant son, Alex, as a soldier in the war in Iraq. Subsequent to the ad&#x27;s release, Jon Stewart, host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, &quot;praised&quot; MoveOn for &quot;10 years of making even people who agree with you cringe.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; op-ed contributor Bill Kristol criticized the ad in an essay, including pointing out that the &quot;United States has an all-volunteer Army. Alex won&#x27;t be drafted, and his mommy can&#x27;t enlist him. He can decide when he&#x27;s an adult whether he wants to serve.&quot;

In 2020, several MoveOn staffers contributed to an article titled &quot;Disinformation creep: ADOS and the strategic weaponization of breaking news&quot; which incorrectly alleged that the subjects criticized in the article acted in ways that were &quot;anti-Black&quot;, dismissive of the impact of COVID-19 on Black Americans, were tied to Russian disinformation efforts, and that they discouraged Black Americans from voting for Democratic candidates. The article was originally published in Harvard University&#x27;s &quot;The Misinformation Review&quot;, but was retracted nearly a year later, after internal and external reviews found the article to have extensive misrepresentation of data and failure &quot;to meet professional standards of validity and reliability&quot;. 

=== David Petraeus advertising controversy ===

In 2007, MoveOn received bipartisan criticism for running a print ad in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that questioned the personal integrity of General David Petraeus, with headlines such as &quot;General Petraeus or General Betray Us?&quot; and &quot;Cooking the Books for the White House&quot;. On September 20, 2007, the Senate passed an amendment by Republican John Cornyn of Texas designed to &quot;strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus&quot;. All 49 Republican senators, as well as 22 Democratic senators, voted in support. The House passed a similar resolution by a 341–79 vote on September 26, 2007.

On September 20, 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated: &quot;Democrats blamed the group Moveon.org for giving moderate Republicans a ready excuse for staying with Bush and for giving Bush and his supporters a way to divert attention away from the war.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; public editor Clark Hoyt later stated in an op-ed that MoveOn was mistakenly charged US$77,000 less for the ad than it should have been under &quot;Times&quot; policies, and MoveOn announced that it would pay &quot;The New York Times&quot; the difference in price.

MoveOn.org ran more ads using a &quot;betrayal&quot; theme, with TV spots targeting former President Bush and former Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani ran his own full-page ad in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on September 14, 2007. Giuliani asked for and received a similar reduced fee as MoveOn.org, paying US$65,000.

==Fundraising==
Since 1998, MoveOn has raised millions of dollars for many Democratic candidates. Once becoming the executive director, Rahna Epting stated MoveOn would spend $20 million &quot;to defeat Donald Trump, end Republican control of the Senate, and help Democrats hold the majority in the House of Representatives.&quot; In a statement released by the organization, Epting said the funds would be used to &quot;drive creative and cultural interventions&quot; and combat &quot;digital voter suppression online.&quot;

<text>The Pequot War was an armed conflict that took place in 1636 and ended in 1638 in New England, between the Pequot tribe and an alliance of the colonists from the Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Saybrook colonies and their allies from the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes. The war concluded with the decisive defeat of the Pequot. At the end, about 700 Pequots had been killed or taken into captivity. Hundreds of prisoners were sold into slavery to colonists in Bermuda or the West Indies; other survivors were dispersed as captives to the victorious tribes.

The result was the elimination of the Pequot tribe as a viable polity in southern New England, and the colonial authorities classified them as extinct. Survivors who remained in the area were absorbed into other local tribes.

==Origin==
The Pequot and the Mohegan people were at one time a single sociopolitical entity. Anthropologists and historians contend that they split into the two competing groups sometime before contact with the Puritan English colonists. The earliest historians of the Pequot War speculated that the Pequot people migrated from the upper Hudson River Valley toward central and eastern Connecticut sometime around 1500. These claims are disputed by the evidence of modern archaeology and anthropology finds.

In the 1630s, the Connecticut River Valley was in turmoil. The Pequot aggressively extended their area of control at the expense of the Wampanoag to the north, the Narragansett to the east, the Connecticut River Valley Algonquian tribes and the Mohegan to the west, and the Lenape Algonquian people of Long Island to the south. The tribes contended for political dominance and control of the European fur trade. A series of epidemics over the course of the previous three decades had severely reduced the Indian populations, and there was a power vacuum in the area as a result.

The Dutch and the English from Western Europe were also striving to extend the reach of their trade into the North American interior to achieve dominance in the lush, fertile region. The colonies were new at the time, as the original settlements had been founded in the 1620s. By 1636, the Dutch had fortified their trading post, and the English had built a trading fort at Saybrook. English Puritans from the Massachusetts Bay, along with the Pilgrims from Plymouth Colony, settled at the recently established river towns of Windsor (1632), Wethersfield (1633), Hartford (1635), and Springfield (1636). The Pilgrims had been allied with the Wampanoag since 1621.

==Causes for war==

Beginning in the early 1630s, a series of contributing factors increased the tensions between English colonists and the tribes of southeastern New England. Efforts to control fur trade access resulted in a series of escalating incidents and attacks that increased tensions on both sides. Political divisions widened between the Pequots and Mohegans as they aligned with different trade sources, the Mohegans with the English colonists and the Pequots with the Dutch colonists. The peace ended between the Dutch and Pequots when the Pequots assaulted a tribe of Indians who had tried to trade in the area of Hartford. Tensions grew as the Massachusetts Bay Colony became a stronghold for wampum production, which the Narragansetts and Pequots had controlled until the mid-1630s.

Adding to the tensions, John Stone and seven of his crew were murdered in 1634 by the Niantics, western tributary clients of the Pequots. Stone was from the West Indies and had been banished from Boston for malfeasance, including drunkenness, adultery, and piracy. He had abducted two Western Niantic men, forcing them to show him the way up the Connecticut River. Soon after, his crew and he were attacked and killed by a larger group of Western Niantics. The initial reactions in Boston varied from indifference to outright joy at Stone&#x27;s death, but the colonial officials still felt compelled to protest the killing. According to the Pequots&#x27; later explanations, he was killed in reprisal for the Dutch murdering the principal Pequot &quot;sachem&quot; Tatobem, and they claimed to be unaware that Stone was English and not Dutch. (Contemporaneous accounts claim that the Pequots knew Stone to be English.) In the earlier incident, Tatobem had boarded a Dutch vessel to trade. Instead of conducting trade, the Dutch abducted him and demanded a substantial amount of ransom for his safe return. The Pequots quickly sent bushels of wampum to the Dutch, but received only Tatobem&#x27;s dead body in return. But the colonial officials in Boston did not accept the Pequots&#x27; excuses that they had been unaware of Stone&#x27;s nationality. Pequot &quot;sachem&quot; Sassacus sent the colonists some wampum to atone for the killing, but he refused the colonists&#x27; demands that the warriors responsible for Stone&#x27;s death be turned over to them for trial and punishment.

The Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635 also placed a great deal of pressure on the harvests of that year, according to historian Katherine Grandjean, increasing competition for winter food supplies for several years afterwards throughout much of coastal Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. This, in turn, precipitated even greater tensions between the Pequots and English colonists, who were ill-prepared to face periods of famine.

A more proximate cause of the war was the killing of a trader named John Oldham, who was attacked on a voyage to Block Island on July 20, 1636. Several of his crew and he were killed and his ship was looted by Narragansett-allied Indians, who sought to discourage settlers from trading with their Pequot rivals. Oldham had a reputation as a troublemaker and had been exiled from Plymouth Colony shortly before the incident on Block Island. In the weeks that followed, officials from Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, and Connecticut assumed that the Narragansetts were the likely culprits. They knew that the Indians of Block Island were allies of the Eastern Niantics, who were allied with the Narragansetts, and they became suspicious of the Narragansetts. The murderers, meanwhile, escaped and were given sanctuary with the Pequots.

==Battles==

News of Oldham&#x27;s death became the subject of sermons in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In August, Governor Vane sent John Endecott to exact revenge on the Indians of Block Island. Endecott&#x27;s party of roughly 90 men sailed to Block Island and attacked two apparently abandoned Niantic villages. Most of the Niantic escaped, while two of Endecott&#x27;s men were injured. The English claimed to have killed 14, but later Narragansett reports claimed that only one Indian was killed on the island. The Massachusetts Bay militia burned the villages to the ground. They carried away crops that the Niantic had stored for winter and destroyed what they could not carry. Endecott went on to Fort Saybrook.

The English at Saybrook were unhappy about the raid, but agreed that some of them would accompany Endecott as guides. Endecott sailed along the coast to a Pequot village, where he repeated the previous year&#x27;s demand for those responsible for the death of Stone, and now also for those who murdered Oldham. After some discussion, Endecott concluded that the Pequots were stalling and attacked, but most escaped into the woods. Endecott had his forces burn down the village and crops before sailing home.

===Pequot raids===
In the aftermath, the English of Connecticut Colony had to deal with the anger of the Pequots. The Pequots attempted to get their allies to join their cause, some 36 tributary villages, but were only partly effective. The Western Niantic (Nehantic) joined them, but the Eastern Niantic remained neutral. The traditional enemies of the Pequot, the Mohegan and the Narragansett, openly sided with the English. The Narragansetts had warred with and lost territory to the Pequots in 1622. Now, their friend Roger Williams urged the Narragansetts to side with the English against the Pequots.

Through the autumn and winter, Fort Saybrook was effectively besieged. People who ventured outside were killed. As spring arrived in 1637, the Pequots stepped up their raids on Connecticut towns. On April 23, Wangunk chief Sequin attacked Wethersfield with Pequot help. They killed six men and three women and a number of cattle and horses, and took two young girls captive. (They were daughters of William Swaine and were later ransomed by Dutch traders.) In all, the towns lost about 30 settlers.

In May, leaders of Connecticut River towns met in Hartford, raised a militia, and placed Captain John Mason in command. Mason set out with 90 militia and 70 Mohegan warriors under Uncas; their orders were to directly attack the Pequot at their fort. At Fort Saybrook, Captain Mason was joined by John Underhill with another 20 men. Underhill and Mason then sailed from Fort Saybrook to Narragansett Bay, a tactic intended to mislead Pequot spies along the shoreline into thinking that the English were not intending an attack. After gaining the support of 200 Narragansetts, Mason and Underhill marched their forces with Uncas and Wequash Cooke about 20 miles towards Mistick Fort (present-day Mystic). They briefly camped at Porter&#x27;s Rocks near the head of the Mystic River before mounting a surprise attack just before dawn.

===The Mystic massacre===
The Mystic Massacre started in the predawn hours of May 26, 1637, when colonial forces led by Captains John Mason and John Underhill, along with their allies from the Mohegan and Narragansett tribes, surrounded one of two main fortified Pequot villages at Mistick. Only 20 soldiers breached the palisade&#x27;s gate and they were quickly overwhelmed, to the point that they used fire to create chaos and facilitate their escape. The ensuing conflagration trapped the majority of the Pequots; those who managed to escape the fire were slain by the soldiers and warriors who surrounded the fort.

Mason later declared that the attack against the Pequots was the act of a God who &quot;laughed his Enemies and the Enemies of his People to scorn&quot;, making the Pequot fort &quot;as a fiery Oven&quot;, and &quot;thus did the Lord judge among the Heathen.&quot; Of the estimated 500 Pequots in the fort, seven were taken prisoner and another seven escaped to the woods.

The Narragansetts and Mohegans with Mason and Underhill&#x27;s colonial militia were horrified by the actions and &quot;manner of the Englishmen&#x27;s fight… because it is too furious, and slays too many men.&quot; The Narragansetts attempted to leave and return home, but were cut off by the Pequots from the other village of Weinshauks and had to be rescued by Underhill&#x27;s men—after which they reluctantly rejoined the colonists for protection and were used to carry the wounded, thereby freeing up more soldiers to fend off the numerous attacks along the withdrawal route.

===War&#x27;s end===
The destruction of people and the village at Mistick Fort and losing even more warriors during the withdrawal pursuit broke the Pequot spirit, and they decided to abandon their villages and flee westward to seek refuge with the Mohawk tribe. Sassacus led roughly 400 warriors along the coast; when they crossed the Connecticut River, the Pequots killed three men whom they encountered near Fort Saybrook.

In mid-June, John Mason set out from Saybrook with 160 men and 40 Mohegan scouts led by Uncas. They caught up with the refugees at Sasqua, a Mattabesic village near present-day Fairfield, Connecticut. The colonists memorialized this event as the Fairfield Swamp Fight (not to be confused with the Great Swamp Fight during King Philip&#x27;s War). The English surrounded the swamp and allowed several hundred to surrender, mostly women and children, but Sassacus slipped out before dawn with perhaps 80 warriors, and continued west.

Sassacus and his followers had hoped to gain refuge among the Mohawk in present-day New York. However, the Mohawk instead murdered his bodyguard and him, afterwards sending his head and hands to Hartford (for reasons which were never made clear). This essentially ended the Pequot War; colonial officials continued to call for hunting down what remained of the Pequots after war&#x27;s end, but they granted asylum to any who went to live with the Narragansetts or Mohegans.

==Aftermath==

In September, the Mohegans and Narragansetts met at the General Court of Connecticut and agreed on the disposition of the Pequot survivors. The agreement, known as the first Treaty of Hartford, was signed on September 21, 1638. About 200 Pequots survived the war; they finally gave up and submitted themselves under the authority of the &quot;sachem&quot; of the Mohegans or Narragansetts.

Other Pequots were enslaved and shipped to Bermuda or the West Indies, or were forced to become household slaves in English households in Connecticut and Massachusetts Bay. The Colonies essentially declared the Pequots extinct by prohibiting them from using the name any longer.

The colonists attributed their victory over the hostile Pequot tribe to an act of God:
This was the first instance wherein Algonquian peoples of southern New England encountered European-style warfare. After the Pequot War, no significant battles occurred between Indians and southern New England colonists for about 38 years. This long period of peace came to an end in 1675 with King Philip&#x27;s War. According to historian Andrew Lipman, the Pequot War introduced the practice of colonists and Indians taking body parts as trophies of battle. Honor and monetary reimbursement was given to those who brought back heads and scalps of Pequots.

==Historical accounts and controversies==
The earliest accounts of the Pequot War were written within one year of the war. Later histories recounted events from a similar perspective, restating arguments first used by military leaders such as John Underhill and John Mason, as well as Puritans Increase Mather and his son Cotton Mather.

Recent historians and others have reviewed these accounts. In 2004, an artist and archaeologist (Jack Dempsey and David R. Wagner) teamed up to evaluate the sequence of events in the Pequot War. Their popular history took issue with events and whether John Mason and John Underhill wrote the accounts that appeared under their names. The authors have been adopted as honorary members of the Lenape Pequots.

Most modern historians do not debate questions of the outcome of the battle or its chronology, such as Alfred A. Cave, a specialist in the ethnohistory of colonial America. However, Cave contends that Mason and Underhill&#x27;s eyewitness accounts, as well as the contemporaneous histories of Mather and Hubbard, were more &quot;polemical than substantive.&quot; Alden T. Vaughan writes that the Pequots were not &quot;solely or even primarily responsible&quot; for the war. &quot;The Bay colony&#x27;s gross escalation of violence… made all-out war unavoidable; until then, negotiation was at least conceivable.&quot;

<doc id="412297" wikidata="Q46686" url="?curid=412297" title="Reredos">
<text>A reredos ( , , ) is a large altarpiece, a screen, or decoration placed behind the altar in a church. It often includes religious images.

The term &quot;reredos&quot; may also be used for similar structures, if elaborate, in secular architecture, for example very grand carved chimneypieces. It also refers to a simple, low stone wall placed behind a hearth.

==Description==
A reredos can be made of stone, wood, metal, ivory, or a combination of materials. The images may be painted, carved, gilded, composed of mosaics, and/or embedded with niches for statues. Sometimes a tapestry or another fabric such as silk or velvet is used.

==Derivation and history of the term==
&quot;Reredos&quot; is derived through Middle English from the 14th-century Anglo-Norman &quot;areredos&quot;, which in turn is from&quot;arere&quot; &#x27;behind&#x27; +&quot;dos&quot; &#x27;back&#x27;, from Latin . (Despite its appearance, the first part of the word is not formed by doubling the prefix &quot;re-&quot;, but by an archaic spelling of &quot;rear&quot;.) In the 14th and 15th centuries the term referred generally to an open hearth of a fireplace or to a screen placed behind a table, then became nearly obsolete until it was revived in the 19th century.

==&quot;Reredos&quot; vs &quot;retable&quot;==
The term &quot;reredos&quot; is sometimes confused with the term &quot;retable&quot;. While a &quot;reredos&quot; generally forms or covers the wall behind an altar, a &quot;retable&quot; is placed either on the altar or immediately behind and attached to the altar. &quot;Many altars have both a reredos and a retable.&quot; But this distinction may not always be observed. The retable may have become part of the reredos when an altar was moved away from the wall. For altars that are against the wall, the retable often sits on top of the altar, at the back, particularly when there is no reredos (in which case a dossal curtain or something similar is used instead of a reredos). The retable may hold flowers and candlesticks.

In French (and sometimes in English by confusing the terms), a reredos is called a ; in Spanish a , etc.

<doc id="412307" wikidata="Q80908" url="?curid=412307" title="Campeche">
<text>Campeche, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Campeche, is one of the 31 states which, with Mexico City, make up the 32 federal entities of Mexico. Located in southeast Mexico, it is bordered by the states of Tabasco to the southwest, Yucatán to the northeast, Quintana Roo to the east, by the Petén department of Guatemala to the south, and by the Orange Walk District of Belize to the southeast. It has a coastline to the west with the Gulf of Mexico. The state capital, also called Campeche, was declared a World Heritage Site in 1997. The formation of the state began with the city, which was founded in 1540 as the Spanish began the conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula. The city was a rich and important port during the colonial period, but declined after Mexico&#x27;s independence. Campeche was part of the province of Yucatán, but split off in the mid-19th century, mostly due to political friction with the city of Mérida. Much of the state&#x27;s recent economic revival is due to the discovery of petroleum offshore in the 1970s, which has made the coastal cities of Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen important economic centers. The state has important Mayan and colonial sites; however, these are not as well-known or visited as much as others in the Yucatán.

The state&#x27;s executive power rests in the governor of Campeche and the legislative power rests in the Congress of Campeche, which is a unicameral legislature composed of 35 deputies.

==Etymology==
The name Campeche is derived from Can Pech, the Maya name of a chiefdom of the southwestern Yucatán Peninsula that existed at the time of the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the sixteenth century. The capital city of the chiefdom of Can Pech was called &quot;Ah-Kin-Pech&quot;, where the city of Campeche is now. When the Spanish first arrived to the area in 1517, they called it Lazaro, since &quot;the day of our landing was St. Lazarus&#x27; Sunday&quot;. The native name means &quot;place of snakes and ticks&quot;.

==Geography==
Campeche is a relatively flat area of Mexico with of shoreline on the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the surface is of sedimentary rock, much of it of marine origin. The area with the highest elevations is near the borders with Guatemala and Quintana Roo. Notable elevations include Cerro Champerico, Cerro los Chinos, Cerro El Ramonal, Cerro El Doce, and Cerro El Gavilán. However, these hills are separated by large expanses of lower flat land. In the south of the municipality of Champotón begin a series of rolling hills known as the Sierra Alta or Puuc, which extend northeast to Bolonchen and then into the state of Yucatán. These have only an average altitude of between with some reaching . Other areas of these rolling hills lie near the city of Campeche, the main ones known as Maxtum, Boxol and El Morro. Another set is called the Sierra Seybaplaya in the center of the state.

Rainforest areas subdivide into a number of types which include perennial tall tree rainforest, semi perennial tall tree rainforest, deciduous medium height tree rainforest, semi-deciduous medium height tree rainforest, deciduous low height tree rainforest and semi-perennial low height tree rainforest. Away from the coast, these rainforests are interspersed with savannah areas and along the coast are accompanied by areas with sand dunes, mangrove wetlands and estuaries. Species that can be found in the various rainforests include Spanish cedar (&quot;Cedrela odorata&quot;), oxhorn bucida (&quot;Bucida buceras&quot;), Campeche logwood (&quot;Haematoxylum campechianum&quot;), and wild tamarind (&quot;Lysiloma latisiliquum&quot;). It also includes a number of precious tropical hardwoods such as red cedar (&quot;Toona ciliata&quot;) Honduran mahogany (&quot;Swietenia macrophylla&quot;), ziricote (&quot;Cordia dodecandra&quot;) and Hollywood (&quot;Guaiacum sanctum&quot;). Along the coastal areas, palms dominate such as the coconut tree (&quot;Cocos nucifera&quot;) and royal palm (&quot;Roystonea regia&quot;). The main wildlife species in the state are the jaguar, ocelot, puma, deer, collared peccary, raccoon, hare, ring-tailed cat and Yucatan spider monkey. There are many bird species including the plain chachalaca, quail, pelican, and toucan. Reptiles include rattlesnakes, coral snakes, boa constrictors, various species of sea and land turtles, iguanas, and crocodiles. While still rich in wildlife, much has been decimated because of agriculture and exploitation of forest resources destroying habitat as well as uncontrolled hunting. Most of the state&#x27;s aquatic life — including many species of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks — is found in the Bay of Campeche. Many of these are exploited commercially.

Most of the state&#x27;s surface freshwater is in the south and southwest, with rivers, small lakes and estuaries. These diminish in the north where rainfall rapidly filtrates into the subsoil. The rivers in the south and southwest belong to various basins, with the largest being the Grijalva to which the Candelaria, Chumpán and Mamantal Rivers belong. The -Usumacinta also flows in the state but it tends to change course frequently and occasionally divides into branches. The east branch of this river is also called the Palizada River, which has the largest volume although it is narrow. The San Pedro River is another branch of the Usumacinta, which passes by Jonuta Municipality in Tabasco before emptying in the Gulf of Mexico. The Chumpán River is an isolated river formed by the union of various streams. It runs north–south and empties in the Laguna de Terminos. The Candelaria River forms in Petén, Guatemala and runs north–south and empties into the Laguna de Pargos. The Mamantel River empties into the Laguna de Panlau. The Champotón River is in the center of the state and empties into the Gulf of Mexico. The rest of the state&#x27;s streams flow only in the rainy season.

The Laguna de Términos lagoon is located in the southwest of the state, near the border with Tabasco. It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico only by the Isla del Carmen. It receives freshwater from most of Campeche&#x27;s rivers as well as saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico. In these brackish waters have developed a number of aquatic species such as sea bass, small sharks, crabs, oysters, turtles, and storks. The lagoon is ringed by smaller lakes and forms the most important lake-lagoon system in the country. These lakes include Atasta, Pom, Puerto Rico, El Este, Del Vapor, Del Corte, Pargos and Panlau. This system formed about five thousand years ago by the accumulation of sediment carried by surrounding rivers. This system connects to the Sabancuy estuary to the northeast.

Campeche is in the tropics; it has a humid climate, with a defined rainy season, and a relatively dry season from late winter to early spring. Average annual rainfall varies between . The hottest and most humid areas of the state are along the coast between the Laguna de Términos and the northern border. Average annual temperature is with highs up to in the summer and lows of in the winter. Prevailing winds are from the northwest from November to March, from the north between September and October, from the southeast from June to August and from the south in April and May. In the winter, storms from the north called &quot;nortes&quot; can bring colder dry air from the area of the United States. In the late summer, there are sometimes hurricanes.

The state has a number of ecosystems, from rainforest, to savanna to coast and sea. Environmentally, the state is divided into four major regions. The coastal region consists of the entire coastline of the state and a strip of shallow water just offshore called the Sonda de Campeche with coral reefs and low islands called cays. The region has large expanses of mangroves that dominate the swamps. Non-swamp areas are dominated by palm trees. Wildlife is dominated by bird and reptile species such as storks, pelicans, ducks, seagulls, lizards, turtles and water snakes. The mountain region is in the north and east of the state consisting of two chains of low hills called the Dzibalchen and Sierra Alta. It also includes the savannah area and an area called Los Chenes, where natural wells (called &quot;cenotes&quot;) are common. This area is noted for its tropical hardwoods and the chicle or gum tree. Wildlife includes deer, armadillos, rabbits, quail, and woodpeckers. The rainforest region is located on the center and south of the state with a wide variety of trees including tropical hardwoods such as mahogany. Many of the plants used in the state&#x27;s cuisine such as &quot;achiote&quot; and tropical fruits are from here. The river region is located in the southwest of the state, named after the various rivers that flow here, mostly emptying into the Laguna de Términos. It has the hottest and most humid climate in Campeche with wildlife and vegetation similar to that found in both the Rainforest and Coast regions.

===Environment and protected areas===
Campeche has four protected areas: the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, the Laguna de Términos Reserve, Ría Celestún Biosphere Reserve, and the Los Petenes Biosphere Reserve. The Calakmul Reserve was created in 1989 over . It consists of Yucatán and Tehuantepec moist forests, containing high and medium growth semi-deciduous forests and seasonally flooded low height semi-deciduous forests. There is also aquatic vegetation. The Laguna de Términos Reserve includes the lagoon and the area surrounding it with an area of . It was established in 1994. Los Petenes is a natural reserve consisting of isolated pockets of rainforest with mangrove areas in between. The wildlife is dependent on a varied and complex system of fresh and brackish water. The reserve extends over in the municipalities of Campeche, Tenabo, Hecelchakán and Calkiní.

==History==

The first people to dominate the area were the Maya, who arrived to Campeche from Guatemala, Honduras and Chiapas. The main Mayan cities in Campeche were Edzná, Xtampak, and later Calakmul and Becán. The Maya civilization reached its height between 600 AD and 900 AD. From 1000 AD on, the Maya cities collapsed and were abandoned for unknown reasons. This led to the establishment of smaller settlements and a mixing of the Maya and Chontal people in the south of the state, which had commercial ties to the central highland cultures of Mexico. From the 11th century to the 16th century, Campeche was divided into smaller dominions.

The first Spaniards in the area were Francisco Hernández de Córdoba and Antón de Alaminos in 1517, who landed at a settlement called Can-Pech, part of the Sol Garrapata dominion. He renamed it San Lázaro. He moved onto the territory of Chakanputon (today Champotón) where he and his men were attacked by the warriors of this dominion. Hernandez de Cordoba died of his wounds from this battle, prompting the Spanish to call this bay the &quot;Bahía de Mala Pelea&quot; (Bay of the Bad Fight). The conquest of Campeche and the rest of the Yucatán Peninsula began in earnest in 1540, under Francisco de Montejos, senior and junior.

The Spanish introduced sugar cane and other crops in the area, starting in the 1540s, but the main value of the area was the port of Campeche, established in 1540 where the old Maya village used to be. During the colonial era, it was a commercial port equal to Havana and Cartagena even though piracy was a constant threat. It shipped valuable exports such as agricultural goods, tropical hardwoods and dyewood, then a widely used textile dye in Europe. It also handled gold and silver from other areas in Mexico going to Spain. Imported items to the port included luxury items such as Italian marble and crystal chandeliers from Austria. The Spanish built a European-based colonial city here and as it became rich, it was filled with large mansions. However, to survive in the hot and humid environment, the Europeans also adapted a number of Maya products such as hammocks for sleeping and storing drinking water in hollow gourds. They also built with the area&#x27;s local red cedar, mahogany and &quot;sahcab&quot; a local limestone. The shipping in these waters attracted pirates such as John Hawkins, Francis Drake, Diego the Mulatto, Henry Morgan, Cornelis Jol, Bartolomeu Português, Lewis Scot and Roche Braziliano. Most of the attacks were at the port of Campeche, but Champontón also suffered significant attacks in 1644 and 1672. Fortification of the city of Campeche began as early as 1610, but these structures were insufficient. The worst pirate attack occurred in 1685, when Laurens de Graaf sacked the city of Campeche and the surrounding haciendas for over thirty days, killing about a third of the area&#x27;s population. This prompted far more extensive fortification with numerous forts and a wall around the city that measured in an irregular polygon shape. Most of the forts survived but only of the original wall remains. These fortifications cut the threat of pirate attacks but it remained walled until 1890. Campeche was officially recognized as a city in 1774 (the first in southeast Mexico) and in 1784 was declared a minor port. In 1804, the port was closed due to the war between Spain and England. This caused discontentment in the city and fomented insurgent tendencies.

Campeche remained a wealthy and important port until the early 19th century, when a number of events brought on the decline. In 1811, the port of Sisal was opened in what is now the State of Yucatán, taking much of the city&#x27;s business. Another issue was that Independence brought the abolition of slavery, cutting agricultural production. The lack of shipping made the city relatively isolated from Mexico City. From the 19th century until the latter 20th, the state&#x27;s economy was dependent on agriculture, fishing, logging and salt mining.

In September 1821, the city of Campeche proclaimed its adherence to the Plan of Iguala and the new Independent government of Mexico, forcing out its last Spanish governor a month later. At Independence, Campeche was one of the two most important cities on the Yucatán Peninsula, along with Mérida. There was political friction between the two. Campeche was the more liberal of the two, and supported the 1824 Mexican Constitution which established the Federal Republic. In 1824, Campeche&#x27;s representative proposed that the peninsula be divided into two states: Mérida and Campeche but this was not accepted. Political divisions intensified along with the nationwide struggle between Liberals and Conservatives.

Despite Campeche&#x27;s and Mérida&#x27;s differences, both were involved in an insurrection against Mexico City headed by Jerónimo López de Llergo in 1839 with the aim of creating an independent state of Yucatán. After initial victories, López de Llergo proclaimed the peninsula independent and in 1841, the Constitution of the Yucatán was promulgated on federalist principles. Yucatán independence did not solve the peninsula&#x27;s internal political problems. Mérida&#x27;s trade with Havana continued but Campeche&#x27;s trade with Mexico City was cut off. Campeche wanted to rejoin Mexico for this reason and Andrés Quintana Roo tried to work out a settlement between the two cities. Mexican president Antonio López de Santa Anna then sent an expedition to force the Yucatán back into Mexico. More fighting came with the outbreak of the Caste War, in 1847, an indigenous rebellion that took place in Campeche and the rest of the Yucatán. This and foreign pressure to pay debts forced the Yucatan to formally reintegrate into Mexico in 1849.

The Constitution of 1857 completely broke the schism between Campeche and Mérida with various rebellions breaking out. During one of these 150 men took over one of the main forts of Campeche and demanded a political union consisting of it, Champotón and Isla del Carmen. Other settlements in the west of the peninsula expressed their desire to be partitioned with these areas as a new state. In 1858, representatives from Campeche and Mérida signed an agreement to divide the peninsula, which was ratified to make the division official.

During the French Intervention in Mexico, forces under Felipe Navarrete took Campeche and forced the state to rejoin the rest of the Yucatán. In 1864, insurgents defeated the imperial army in Hecelchakán and in 1867, they retook Campeche to regain the state&#x27;s independence.

During the Mexican Revolution, Manuel Castilla Brito took up arms in Campeche in support of Francisco I. Madero. However, the insurgents were defeated by General Manuel Rivera, a Victoriano Huerta supporter in 1913. Forces loyal to Venustiano Carranza entered Campeche in 1914. Slavery and serfdom was abolished on the haciendas. In 1917, Campeche wrote its current constitution.

There was some improvement in the state&#x27;s economy starting in the 1950s when fishing and timber industries became more developed and there was better communication between the state and Mexico City. In 1955, the University of Campeche was founded and a state system of middle schools was begun.
However, Campeche&#x27;s main economic change come with the discovery of oil off its shores in a shallow water region called the Sonda de Campeche. This oil was discovered by a fisherman named Rudesindo Cantarell in 1971, who reported an oil slick. In 1975, the first oil platform, called Chac Number One began operations. The first set of offshore platforms were completed by 1979. The find has made the state the top producer of petroleum in Mexico, providing 70% of all oil pumped in the country. The economic boom tripled the population of the city of Campeche in ten years, and nearly doubled that of Ciudad del Carmen, which before was only a small fishing village. However, the production of oil has brought environmental problems to the area, especially fishing yields, as well as internal strife between locals and newcomers.

In the mid-1980s, about 25,000 Guatemalan refugees had fled into the state to escape civil war there.

The oil money allowed for the revitalization of the city of Campeche starting in the 1980s. The State Office of Cultural Heritage Sites and Monuments bought abandoned properties to restore them for use as museums, schools, theaters and a library. More than a thousand facades and monuments have been refurbished in the historic center and the oldest residential areas.

In the 1990s, a number of textile mills of the &quot;maquiladora&quot; type were opened in the state. The capital was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

The most recently created municipality is Candelaria in 1998.

In 2017, the territorial dispute with Quintana Roo was archived by the Supreme Court, basically giving Campeche 10,500 sq km.

==Economy==
Total: Campeche contributes 1.83% of Mexico&#x27;s total GDP. The average salary per year in the state is $141,088 pesos in comparison to the national average of $99,114. However, there is a very large discrepancy between highly paid oil workers, mostly coming from out of state, and locals who do not work for PEMEX. Most land is owned as community property under the ejido system (61%). Twenty nine percent is privately owned and the rest is under state or federal control. Three out of four residences are in urban areas, which generally have basic services. Most of these have cement foundations, with cinderblock walls and brick or cement roofs. Rural residences are usually constructed from local materials which may have roofs of laminate, palm fronds or even cardboard, walls made of laminate or wood, with foundations generally of cement or packed earth. Overall in the state, running water, garbage collection and electricity are available in over 80% of homes, but sewage in only a third. Over sixty five percent of the territory is exploited for forestry products, with over 25% used for grazing, with only 3.3% used for agriculture and about 5.5% used for other purposes such as human settlements.

Only 3.3% of the state&#x27;s land is used for raising crops due to the soil composition. Over ninety percent of cropland is used for seasonal crops such as corn with the rest used for perennials such as fruit trees. The most important crop is corn, followed by rice and sorghum. Other important crops include jalapeño chili peppers, watermelon, sugar cane and various tropical and non-tropical fruit-bearing trees, especially citrus and mango. Most cattle are raised in the center and south of the state for both meat and milk products and account for the most product by volume. In the north, most commercially raised livestock is domestic fowl mostly chickens and turkeys, but domestic fowl is raised in most rural homes all over the state. Sheep and goats are raised sparsely all over the state, depending on local vegetation. Forestry, including the extraction of precious tropical hardwoods, remains an important economic activity despite the degradation of many of the state&#x27;s forests. Commercial fishing is mostly done along the coast, with shrimp being the most valuable catch, followed by crustaceans and mollusks. This is mostly done in the coast reason, where most of the economy outside of oil production relies on fishing and the building and repair of fishing boats.

The secondary sector of the economy (mining, construction and industry) is almost entirely concentrated in the coastal area of the state in the municipalities of Campeche, Carmen and Champotón. Mining, mostly oil production, accounts for 52.8% of the state&#x27;s GDP. This oil lies off the coast of the state, in a shallow water section of the Gulf of Mexico called the Sonda de Campeche. Campeche oil and gas production accounts for 37% of Mexico&#x27;s total with crude oil alone accounting for 76% in absolute numbers. Campeche does not have metal deposits but it does have deposits of building stone, such as sandstone, marble and limestone, sand, gravel, lime, clay and other minerals. Most deposits are located in the municipalities of Hopelchén, Champotón and Calakmul. In the far north of the coast region, there are important deposits of salt. Construction and manufacturing account for 6.7% of the state&#x27;s GDP. The most common type of industry relates to food and food processing including seafood, soft drinks, cookies, flour, sugar and honey. Another common industry is that of building materials such as cinderblock, wood products and the processing of building stone. Most industries are small with little financing for technology and growth. Since the 1990s, factories of the &quot;maquiladora&quot; type have opened in the state, such as the Calkiní Shirt Company in Tepacan, Calkiní, Textiles Blazer in Lerma, Campeche, Quality Textil de Campeche in Becal, Calkiní and Karims Textile and Apparel México in the city of Campeche.

Commerce and services account for 33.2% of the state&#x27;s GDP. The commerce sector of the economy is mostly traditional with small establishments catering to local or regional needs. In the larger cities, supermarkets and malls can be found. Most commerce with entities outside of Campeche is in seafood, agricultural and forestry products. The state has thirty-four traditional public markets. All petroleum products are marketed by the national oil company PEMEX. The state has about five hundred businesses dedicated to tourism, about half of which are restaurants, a little less than a quarter bars and a similar number of handcraft shops. There are 126 major hotels, mostly in the municipalities of Campeche, Ciudad del Carmen and Champotón.

==Culture==
The state has two main government-sponsored cultural festivals, the Festival del Centro Histórico and the Festival de Jazz. Campeche has a Festival del Centro Histórico in November and December, which attracts over 5,000 artists, intellectuals and academics to over 800 events such as concerts, theater, dance, book presentations, and workshops. The Festival de Jazz was begun in 1999 and has had the participation of figures such as Mike Stern, Caribbean Jazz Project, Yazzkin, Chano Domínguez, Eugenio Toussaint, David Gilmore and Scott Henderson. One notable economic fair outside the city is the &quot;Jipi&quot; Sombrero Festival in Bécal in April and May.

The largest religious festival in the state is Carnival in the city of Campeche. Carnival was introduced in 1582. By 1688, the annual event featured orchestras and in 1815, formal dances called &quot;saraos&quot; were organized which originally were held only in the homes of the elite. Later in the 19th century, events in the streets for the masses became popular, with the various neighborhoods of the city organizing their own events. Eventually, these merged into a citywide celebration featuring various traditional dances such as Baile del Pavo, Son de la Cucaracha, the fandango, fandanguillo and various forms of tropical jaranas. They also include more risqué dances such as those called la Culebra, Los Papagayos and la Contradanza de los Palitos which have Afro-Caribbean influence. Other important religious festivals include Candlemas (Candelaria) in Hool, Champotón and Campeche, feast day of Our Lady of Mount Carmen in Ciudad del Carmen, feast day of Saint Joachim in Palizada, and the feast day of Saint Roman in Campeche, the feast of San Isidro Labrador in Calkiní in May, the feast of the Cristo Negro in San Román, Day of the Dead in all of the state, feast of the Holy Cross in Sabancuy, Carmen in May, feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmen in Ciudad del Carmen in July and the feast of the Señor de la Salud in Hecelchakán in April. During these festivals is when the state&#x27;s most traditional music, called jarana, and traditional dances can be heard and seen.

As a Mayan region, Campeche has had corn as its staple since the pre-Hispanic period, accompanied by beans, vegetables, tropical fruits and seafood, with some meat. There are two main types of cuisine: &quot;mestizo&quot; is mostly of Spanish origin with some indigenous additions, while Maya is almost purely indigenous. Some foods have been reinvented. One is papak&#x27;sul, or papadzul, which was made with beans and chili peppers. Today it is a torilla filled with cooked egg and squash seed salsa. Common seasonings are a mix of indigenous and those which came from Europe such as salt, oregano, pepper, habanero chili peppers, achiote, cloves and vinegar. Regional dishes include cochinita pibil, beans with pork, pork with , shark tacos, pickled vines, seafood such as many species of fish, shrimp, octopus and crustaceans. Similar to cochinita pibil, pibipollos are chickens roasted in underground pits, most often prepared for Day of the Dead. There is also a large number of seafood-based dishes such as pan de cazón. One notable shrimp dish is made with giant prawns and called &quot;siete barbas&quot;. Tamales are filled with ground pork or chicken seasoned with achiote, pibil or sweet corn. The staple bread is the corn tortilla. The town of Pomuch in the municipality of Hecelchakán is known for its bread and has a type named after it.(turimsoenc) Cheese was mostly likely influenced by pirates with queso de bola related to Dutch cheese-making traditions.

==Education==
The average number of years of schooling for those over age 15 is 8.5, which means that most finish middle school. This is slightly under the national average of 8.6. Over 55% finish primary school and over 35% finish a level over high school, either in technical training or university. The state has over 1800 schools from preschool to university level. These include seventeen teachers&#x27; colleges and twenty eight other institutions of higher education.

The first educational institution in the state was located in the former monastery of San José in the city of Campeche, founded by the Jesuits in 1756 called the Colegio Clerical de San José. In 1823, its name was changed to the Colegio Clerical de San Miguel de Estrada. After the Reform Laws closed the monastery, The Instituto Campechano was established in 1859 by then-governor Pablo Garcia in the same building. The Institute operated until the mid-20th century when it was replaced by the University of Campeche, which was initially housed at the institute.

The Universidad Autónoma de Campeche was founded in 1957 by the state to systematize higher education in the state as its first major university. The institution operated out of several buildings until the mid-1960s, when the Ciudad Universitaria campus was built, and named the Universidad del Sudeste. This name was changed to the current one in 1989. The university offers twenty three bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and eight graduate degrees.

The Instituto Tecnológico de Campeche was founded in 1976 as the Instituto Tecnológico Regional de Campeche as part of a nationwide system of technical colleges with only two majors. The college gained its own campus in 1978 and its current name was adopted in the 1980s.

==Demographics==

As of 2015, the state has a total population of 899,931. Seventy-five percent live in urban areas along the coast and twenty-five percent live in rural areas. The most populated municipality is Campeche. Most of the state&#x27;s population growth has occurred since 1970 when the population then was only 215,600.

The most commonly spoken indigenous language spoken in the state is Yucatec Maya, with 71,852 speakers. This is followed by Chol, with 10,412, Tzeltal with 1,900 and Q&#x27;anjob&#x27;al with 1,557. There are a total of 91,094 speakers of an indigenous language in the state, which is about 12% of the total population. This is up from just under 90,000 in 2005. Fourteen percent of these speakers do not speak Spanish. There are about 7,000 Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites of German descent in the State of Campeche, mostly around Hopelchen and Hecelchakán. These Menonnites came in the 1980s from the Mennonite settlements which were founded in 1922 and 1924 in the states of Chihuahua and Durango, partly via Zacatecas. According to the 2020 Census, 2.08% of Campeche&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.

Sixty three percent of the population profess the Catholic faith as of 2010. Most those who are non Catholic belong to Evangelical or Protestant churches. The National Presbyterian Church in Mexico has a large percentage of followers in Tabasco State.

==Municipalities==

The state of Campeche is located in southeast Mexico, on the west side of the Yucatan Peninsula. The territory comprises , which is 2.6% of Mexico&#x27;s total. It borders the states of Yucatán, Quintana Roo and Tabasco, with the country of Guatemala to the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the west. Politically, it is divided into thirteen municipalities: Calakmul, Calkiní, Campeche, Candelaria, Carmen, Champotón, Dzitbalché, Escárcega, Hecelchakán, Hopelchén, Palizada, Seybaplaya, and Tenabo.

Newspapers of Campeche include: &quot;Crónica de Campeche&quot;, &quot;El Sur de Campeche&quot;, &quot;Expreso de Campeche&quot;, &quot;La Ira Noticias para Mí Campeche&quot;, &quot;Novedades de Campeche&quot;, and &quot;Tribuna (Campeche)&quot;. Telephone service is still mostly landline, but cellular infrastructure is growing.

===Transport===
The state has of highway, about a third of which is federal, connecting urban areas. There are eight nine main bridges, most of which are just to the south of the city of Campeche and near Ciudad del Carmen. The two largest are the Puente de la Unidad and Zacatal, which connect Ciudad del Carmen with the mainland. Other important bridges exist in Champotón, Candelaria and Palizada. Federal Highway 180 is the main thoroughfare in the state, running along the coast from the Tabasco state border connecting Ciudad del Carmen and Campeche with Mérida in Yucatán state. There are of rail line and two main airports in Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen. The latter also has a heliport and there are twenty five over air strips in other parts of the state. The shoreline has thirty-seven commercial and military docks. The presence of PEMEX is the main force behind the building and maintenance of port infrastructure. The most developed public transportation is in the city of Campeche, although buses, taxis and other public transportation are available in most towns.

The Campeche airport, officially named Ing. Alberto Acuña Ongay, serves the city and port of Campeche with domestic service, mostly to Mexico City. Opened in 1965, it served about 100,000 passengers in 2009.

==Tourism==

The city Campeche (formally known as San Francisco de Campeche) is one of the least known and most overlooked colonial cities in Mexico, mostly bypassed by those visiting more famous destinations in the Yucatan peninsula. The city&#x27;s historic buildings are protected by decree to keep them from being destroyed or altered by the growth of the city. Campeche was one of the most important ports in New Spain. It suffered more than 21 major pirate attacks in the colonial era. After 1685, the city&#x27;s main fortifications were begun taking 24 years to complete. They succeeded in stopping major pirate attacks, with only one, Barbillas, finding a way to enter the city in 1708. The fortifications consisted of a formidable wall with four main gates, three opening to land and one to the sea. It also included a number of forts such as San Carlos, Santa Rosa, San Juan and San Francisco. Stories persist that many of the mansions had tunnels to escape pirates, but these have never been found.

The state has a number of colonial-era churches. The Asunción church in Dzitbalché was constructed in the 18th century, with a pointed arch doorway, choral window and bell-gable. The Guadalupe Church in Bécal, Calkiní was built in the 18th century. The San Diego Apóstol Church in Nunkiní, Calkiní was built in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The church and former monastery of San Luis Obispo is located in Calkiní, built in the 17th century of stone, wood and metal over a former Mayan temple. The facade is simple with a bell-gable and there remains only one of its original Baroque altarpieces, which was made in the 16th century. The Catedral de Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción is from the 16th century. Its façade is of worked stone with two levels marked off by two grooved pilasters. The San Francisco Church in Campeche was established in the 16th century although the current building dates from the 17th. The church marks the spot where the first mass was held on mainland America. Most of the state&#x27;s colonial era churches are located in and near the city of Campeche, with some in Ciudad del Carmen. The Nuestra Señora del Carmen Church in Ciudad del Carmen was built in the 18th century. The Sagrado Corazón de Jesús Church was built in the 18th century in Sabancuy, Carmen. The church and former monastery of San Francisco de Asís was begun in the 16th century by the Franciscans in Hecelchakán.

Outside of the city Campeche, much of the notable civil architecture in the state is found on the various former haciendas. Many of these haciendas have been turned into hotels, spas and other tourist attractions. Hacienda Blanca Flor is located in Hecelchakán outside Campeche. This hacienda was a site of one of the bloodiest battles of the Caste War. Hacienda Santa Cruz is between Campeche and Calkiní in the Nunkiní community. It is dated to the middle of the 18th century established to raise cattle. It continued operating until the Mexican Revolution. Hacienda San José Carpizo is in the Champotón municipality, founded in 1871 by José María Carpizo Sánchez and was one of the most important on the Yucatán Peninsula, raising cattle. It survived the Mexican Revolution until its workers abandoned it in the 1940s. Hacienda San Luis Carpizo is located in Champotón and belonged to José María Carpizo, dedicated to agriculture. This hacienda was restored by the Mexican Army to house the Marine Infantry School in 1999. Hacienda Uayamón is near the city of Campeche with origins in the 16th century. It was attacked and its owner killed in the raid by Laurens de Graaf in 1685. It continued to operate until the Mexican Revolution and today it is home to the Hotel de Gran Turismo. Hacienda Tankuché was dedicated to raising dyewood (&quot;palo de tinte&quot;) but changed later to henequen. Despite losing most of its land in the Revolution, its henequen mill continued to operate until the 1980s.
Notable museums in the state include the Del Carmen Archeological Museum, the Museo de las Estelas Mayas in Ciudad del Carmen and the Camino Real Archeological Museum in Hecelchakán. The Museo Fuerte de San Miguel is located on one of the Campeche&#x27;s old forts. The museum is dedicated to the state&#x27;s history. Opened in 2000, it is the newest and most modern of Campeche&#x27;s museums.

Most of the beaches frequented by visitors are in the municipalities of Campeche, Champotón and Ciudad del Carmen. In Campeche, these beaches include Mar Azul, San Lorenzo and Playa Bonita. In Ciudad del Carmen, they include La Maniagua, Bahamita, Sabancuy, Playa Caracol and Playa Norte, Isla de Pájaros. In Champotón, they are Acapulquito, Costa Blanca, Payucán and Sihoplaya. In the interior of the state, there are a number of water parks such as El Remate in Tankuché and San Vicente Chuc-Say on a former hacienda of the same name. These generally take advantage of the local rivers, springs and cenotes. Ecotourism includes caves such as Xculhoc, Chuncedro and Xtacumbilxuna&#x27;an or Mujer Escondida.

===Archaeological sites in Campeche===
Much of Campeche&#x27;s territory is filled with various archeological sites, almost all of which are Mayan. Maya sites in Campeche include Acanmul, Balamkú, Becán, Bolonchén, Calakmul, Chactún, Chicanná, Chunlimón, Edzná, Isla de Jaina, Lagunita, the Petén Basin, Río Bec, Isla Uaymil, Xculoc, Xpuhil, and Xtampak. These sites are less visited than sites to the east such as Chichen Itza, and Tulum. An early important site is Edzna, located near the city of Campeche in a region known as los Chenes. It was one of the most important ceremonial centers in the pre-Classic Maya period (300–900 CE). Its building show Petén, Chenes and Puuc influence, with a large acropolis surrounded by various temples, the most important of which is the Pyramid of the Five Floors. It was discovered in the 1920s and excavated in the 1940s. It is located away from other Mayan settlements on the peninsula and was probably a collection center for the agriculture products grown in the area, reaching its height between 600 and 900. These were sent to the city of Tikal in exchange for ritualistic adornment for the site. Its most important building is the Pyramid of the Five Stories, built as its name implies. Another important find came in the 1990s. During the planting season in early May, archeologist Antonio Benavides noticed that the setting sun illuminates a stucco mask hanging one of the pyramid&#x27;s rooms. The effect also happens in August, during harvest and it is believed to be related to the asking and receiving of abundant crops.

The largest archeological site in the state is Calakmul, which means &quot;twin heaps&quot; in the Mayan language. It is located in the Petén region built in the late Classic period (500–900 CE). Calakmal is estimated to have been populated around 1000 BCE with its height at around 600 In 695 CE, Calakmul was conquered by Tikal and the city fell into decline. Calakmul is located in the interior rainforest of the state in a biosphere named after it near the Guatemala border. The site extends over and was one of the largest cities of Mesoamerica. Its temples were mostly dedicated to ancestor worship encircling the palaces of the elite in the center. There are an estimated 6,000 structures at the site with only half a dozen restored. The two most important structures are the twin pyramids of Temple II and Temple VII, similar to structures found at Tikal. Temple II is tallest at high. The site has been heavily looted by grave robbers.

While most sites are in the interior rainforest of the state, there are 55 archeological sites on the coast alone, mostly remnants of small villages. The Isla de Jaina is one of the best preserved archeological sites in the state because of its location on an island on the coast, surrounded by estuaries and mangroves. It requires special permission to visit. Unlike others on the coast, it was a true city. Other sites include Can-mayab-mul in Nunkiní, Xculhoc in Hecelchakán, Chunan-tunich, Xtampak, Hochob, Pak-chén and Dzebilnocac in Hopelchén, El Tigre in Candelaria, La Xoch and Chun Cedro in Tenabo and Becán in Calakmul.

<text>Drowning by Numbers is a British-Dutch crime comedy-drama 1988 film directed by Peter Greenaway. It won the award for Best Artistic Contribution at the Cannes Film Festival of 1988.

==Plot==

The film opens with a little girl jumping rope and counting stars to &quot;a hundred&quot;.
The film&#x27;s plot centres on three married women — a grandmother, her daughter, and her niece — each named Cissie Colpitts. As the story progresses, each woman successively drowns her husband. The three Cissie Colpittses are played by Joan Plowright, Juliet Stevenson and Joely Richardson, while Bernard Hill plays the coroner, Madgett, who is cajoled into covering up the three crimes.

The structure, with similar stories repeated three times, is reminiscent of a fairy tale, most specifically &#x27;The Billy Goats Gruff&#x27;, because Madgett is constantly promised greater rewards as he tries his luck with each of the Cissies in turn. The link to folklore is further established by Madgett&#x27;s son Smut, who recites the rules of various unusual games played by the characters as if they were ancient traditions. Many of these games are invented for the film, including:

*Bees in the Trees
*Dawn Card Castles
*Deadman&#x27;s Catch
*Flights of Fancy (or Reverse Strip Jump)
*The Great Death Game
*Hangman&#x27;s Cricket
*The Hare and Hounds
*Sheep and Tides

In &quot;Drowning by Numbers&quot;, number-counting, the rules of games and the repetitions of the plot are all devices which emphasise structure. Through the course of the film each of the numbers 1 to 100 appear, the large majority in sequence, often seen in the background, sometimes printed on cattle, sometimes spoken by the characters.

The repetitive, obsessive motif of the film echoes that of the soundtrack by Michael Nyman.

The film is set and was shot in and around Southwold, Suffolk, England, with key landmarks such as the Victorian water tower, Southwold Lighthouse, and the estuary of the River Blyth clearly identifiable.

==Cast==
==Music==
On Greenaway&#x27;s specific instructions, the film&#x27;s musical score by Michael Nyman is entirely based on themes from the slow movement of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia Concertante&quot; in E flat, bars 58 to 61 of which are heard in their original form immediately after each drowning. Greenaway alerted Nyman to the potential of this piece in the late 1970s and had previously used it as material for part of the score of his &quot;The Falls&quot; and for &quot;&quot;The Masterwork&quot; Award Winning Fish-Knife&quot; and &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. &quot;Trysting Fields&quot; is the most complicated use of the material: every appoggiatura from the movement, and no other material from the piece, is used.

The album is the tenth by Nyman and the seventh to feature the Michael Nyman Band.

===Track listing===
#&quot;Trysting Fields&quot;
#&quot;Sheep and Tides&quot;
#&quot;Great Death Game&quot;
#&quot;Drowning by Number 3&quot;
#&quot;Wheelbarrow Walk&quot;
#&quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Catch&quot;
#&quot;Drowning by Number 2&quot;
#&quot;Bees in Trees&quot;
#&quot;Fish Beach&quot;
#&quot;Wedding Tango&quot;
#&quot;Crematorium Conspiracy&quot;
#&quot;Knowing the Ropes&quot;
#&quot;Endgame&quot;

The back cover of the album booklet has a large number &quot;58&quot;. Fred Ritzel has pointed out that the Skipping Girl (played by Natalie Morse) reaches number 58 in her counting game. These are subtle ways of drawing attention to the key bars of the Mozart piece.

==Reception==
Reviews for &quot;Drowning by Numbers&quot; were mostly favourable. Roger Ebert, however, gave the work two stars, praising its landscapes as beautifully photographed but also concluding, &quot;When the movie was over, I was not sure why Greenaway made it.&quot;

===Box Office===
It made £220,000.

==In popular culture==
* Émilie Gillet, designer of the Mutable Instruments range of electronic musical instruments and synthesizer modules, named alternative firmware for her &quot;Tides&quot; synthesiser module &quot;Sheep&quot;, in reference to the game featured in the film. Subsequently, alternative firmware called &quot;Bees-in-the-Trees&quot;, for the Mutable Instrument Braids synthesiser module, and &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Catch&quot;, for the Mutable Instrument Peaks module, have been published.
* Ambient electronic musician Yuri Tománek, who composed the music for the Netflix documentary series &quot;Cheer&quot; and &quot;Last Chance U&quot; releases recordings under the name Drowning by Numbers.
* The film helped to inspire Black metal band Farsot&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Fail-Lure&quot;.
* The &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; episode &quot;Bad News&quot; uses a numbering device inspired by the film. Numbers count down to the titular &quot;Bad News&quot;, when character Marshall learns that his father has died.
* &quot;J.M. DeMatteis&quot; referenced the film in Marc Spector:&quot;Moon Knight&quot; #29.

<text>The Peerage of Great Britain comprises all extant peerages created in the Kingdom of Great Britain between the Acts of Union 1707 and the Acts of Union 1800. It replaced the Peerage of England and the Peerage of Scotland, but was itself replaced by the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1801.

The ranks of the Peerage of Great Britain are Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount and Baron. Until the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, all peers of Great Britain could sit in the House of Lords.

Some peerages of Great Britain were created for peers in the Peerage of Scotland and Peerage of Ireland as they did not have an automatic seat in the House of Lords until the Peerage Act 1963 which gave Scottish Peers an automatic right to sit in the Lords.

In the following table of peers of Great Britain, holders of higher or equal titles in the other peerages are listed. Those peers who are known by a higher title in one of the other peerages are listed in &quot;italics&quot;.

== Ranks ==
The ranks of the peerage are Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, and Baron.

== Titles ==

Marquesses, earls, viscounts and barons are all addressed as &#x27;Lord X&#x27;, where &#x27;X&#x27; represents either their territory or surname pertaining to their title. Marchionesses, countesses, viscountesses and baronesses are all addressed as &#x27;Lady X&#x27;. Dukes and duchesses are addressed just as &#x27;Duke&#x27; or &#x27;Duchess&#x27; or, in a non-social context, &#x27;Your Grace&#x27;.

== Creation of peers ==
The last non-royal dukedom of Great Britain was created in 1766, and the last marquessate of Great Britain was created in 1796. Creation of the remaining ranks ceased when the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was formed; subsequent creations of peers were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The last 8 (6 non-royal and two royal) people who were created hereditary peers (from 1798 to 1800) were:

<doc id="412326" wikidata="Q1186378" url="?curid=412326" title="Democratic peace theory">
<text>Proponents of democratic peace theory argue that both electoral and republican forms of democracy are hesitant to engage in armed conflict with other identified democracies. Different advocates of this theory suggest that several factors are responsible for motivating peace between democratic states. Individual theorists maintain &quot;monadic&quot; forms of this theory (democracies are in general more peaceful in their international relations); &quot;dyadic&quot; forms of this theory (democracies do not go to war with other democracies); and &quot;systemic&quot; forms of this theory (more democratic states in the international system makes the international system more peaceful).

In terms of norms and identities, it is hypothesized that democratic publics are more dovish in their interactions with other democracies, and that democratically elected leaders are more likely to resort to peaceful resolution in disputes (both in domestic politics and international politics). In terms of structural or institutional constraints, it is hypothesized that institutional checks and balances, accountability of leaders to the public, and larger winning coalitions make it harder for democratic leaders to go to war unless there are clearly favorable ratio of benefits to costs.

These structural constraints, along with the transparent nature of democratic politics, make it harder for democratic leaders to mobilize for war and initiate surprise attacks, which reduces fear and inadvertent escalation to war. The transparent nature of democratic political systems, as well as deliberative debates (involving opposition parties, the media, experts, and bureaucrats), make it easier for democratic states to credibly signal their intentions. The concept of audience costs entails that threats issued by democratic leaders are taken more seriously because democratic leaders will be electorally punished by their publics from backing down from threats, which reduces the risk of misperception and miscalculation by states.

The connection between peace and democracy has long been recognized, but theorists disagree about the direction of causality. The democratic peace theory posits that democracy causes peace, while the territorial peace theory makes the opposite claim that peace causes democracy. Other theories argue that omitted variables explain the correlation better than democratic peace theory. Alternative explanations for the correlation of peace among democracies include arguments revolving around institutions, commerce, interdependence, alliances, US world dominance and political stability.

==History==
Though the democratic peace theory was not rigorously or scientifically studied until the 1960s, the basic principles of the concept had been argued as early as the 18th century in the works of philosopher Immanuel Kant and political theorist Thomas Paine. Kant foreshadowed the theory in his essay &quot;Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch&quot; written in 1795, although he thought that a world with only constitutional republics was only one of several necessary conditions for a perpetual peace. In earlier but less cited works, Thomas Paine made similar or stronger claims about the peaceful nature of republics. Paine wrote in &quot;Common Sense&quot; in 1776: &quot;The Republics of Europe are all (and we may say always) in peace.&quot; Paine argued that kings would go to war out of pride in situations where republics would not. French historian and social scientist Alexis de Tocqueville also argued, in &quot;Democracy in America&quot; (1835–1840), that democratic nations were less likely to wage war. Herbert Spencer also argued for a relationship between democracy and peace.

Dean Babst, a criminologist, was the first to do statistical research on this topic. His academic paper supporting the theory was published in 1964 in &quot;Wisconsin Sociologist&quot;; he published a slightly more popularized version, in 1972, in the trade journal &quot;Industrial Research&quot;. Both versions initially received little attention.

Melvin Small and J. David Singer responded; they found an absence of wars between democratic states with two &quot;marginal exceptions&quot;, but denied that this pattern had statistical significance. This paper was published in the &quot;Jerusalem Journal of International Relations&quot; which finally brought more widespread attention to the theory, and started the academic debate. A 1983 paper by political scientist Michael W. Doyle contributed further to popularizing the theory. 

Maoz and Abdolali extended the research to lesser conflicts than wars. Bremer, Maoz and Russett found the correlation between democracy and peacefulness remained significant after controlling for many possible confounding variables. This moved the theory into the mainstream of social science. Supporters of realism in international relations and others responded by raising many new objections. Other researchers attempted more systematic explanations of how democracy might cause peace, and of how democracy might also affect other aspects of foreign relations such as alliances and collaboration.

There have been numerous further studies in the field since these pioneering works. Most studies have found some form of democratic peace exists, although neither methodological disputes nor doubtful cases are entirely resolved.

==Definitions==

Research on the democratic peace theory has to define &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;peace&quot; (or, more often, &quot;war&quot;).

===Defining democracy===
Democracies have been defined differently by different theorists and researchers; this accounts for some of the variations in their findings. Some examples:

Small and Singer define democracy as a nation that (1) holds periodic elections in which the opposition parties are as free to run as government parties, (2) allows at least 10% of the adult population to vote, and (3) has a parliament that either controls or enjoys parity with the executive branch of the government.

Doyle requires (1) that &quot;liberal regimes&quot; have market or private property economics, (2) they have policies that are internally sovereign, (3) they have citizens with juridical rights, and (4) they have representative governments. Either 30% of the adult males were able to vote or it was possible for every man to acquire voting rights as by attaining enough property. He allows greater power to hereditary monarchs than other researchers; for example, he counts the rule of Louis-Philippe of France as a liberal regime.

Ray requires that at least 50% of the adult population is allowed to vote and that there has been at least one peaceful, constitutional transfer of executive power from one independent political party to another by means of an election. This definition excludes long periods often viewed as democratic. For example, the United States until 1800, India from independence until 1979, and Japan until 1993 were all under a dominant-party system, and thus would not be counted under this definition.

Rummel states that &quot;By democracy is meant liberal democracy, where those who hold power are elected in competitive elections with a secret ballot and wide franchise (loosely understood as including at least 2/3 of adult males); where there is freedom of speech, religion, and organization; and a constitutional framework of law to which the government is subordinate and that guarantees equal rights.&quot;

====Non-binary classifications====
The above definitions are binary, classifying nations into either democracies or non-democracies. Many researchers have instead used more finely grained scales. One example is the Polity data series which scores each state on two scales, one for democracy and one for autocracy, for each year since 1800; as well as several others. The use of the Polity Data has varied. Some researchers have done correlations between the democracy scale and belligerence; others have treated it as a binary classification by (as its maker does) calling all states with a high democracy score and a low autocracy score democracies; yet others have used the difference of the two scores, sometimes again making this into a binary classification.

====Young democracies====
Several researchers have observed that many of the possible exceptions to the democratic peace have occurred when at least one of the involved democracies was very young. Many of them have therefore added a qualifier, typically stating that the peacefulness apply to democracies older than three years. Rummel argues that this is enough time for &quot;democratic procedures to be accepted, and democratic culture to settle in.&quot; Additionally, this may allow for other states to actually come to the recognition of the state as a democracy.

Mansfield and Snyder, while agreeing that there have been no wars between mature liberal democracies, state that countries in transition to democracy are especially likely to be involved in wars. They find that democratizing countries are even more warlike than stable democracies, stable autocracies or even countries in transition towards autocracy. So, they suggest caution in eliminating these wars from the analysis, because this might hide a negative aspect of the process of democratization. A reanalysis of the earlier study&#x27;s statistical results emphasizes that the above relationship between democratization and war can only be said to hold for those democratizing countries where the executive lacks sufficient power, independence, and institutional strength. A review cites several other studies finding that the increase in the risk of war in democratizing countries happens only if many or most of the surrounding nations are undemocratic. If wars between young democracies are included in the analysis, several studies and reviews still find enough evidence supporting the stronger claim that all democracies, whether young or established, go into war with one another less frequently; while some do not.

===Defining war===
Quantitative research on international wars usually defines war as a military conflict with more than 1000 killed in battle in one year. This is the definition used in the Correlates of War Project which has also supplied the data for many studies on war. It turns out that most of the military conflicts in question fall clearly above or below this threshold.

Some researchers have used different definitions. For example, Weart defines war as more than 200 battle deaths. Russett, when looking at Ancient Greece, only requires some real battle engagement, involving on both sides forces under state authorization.

Militarized Interstate Disputes (MIDs), in the Correlates of War Project classification, are lesser conflicts than wars. Such a conflict may be no more than military display of force with no battle deaths. MIDs and wars together are &quot;militarized interstate conflicts&quot; or MICs. MIDs include the conflicts that precede a war; so the difference between MIDs and MICs may be less than it appears.

Statistical analysis and concerns about degrees of freedom are the primary reasons for using MID&#x27;s instead of actual wars. Wars are relatively rare. An average ratio of 30 MIDs to one war provides a richer statistical environment for analysis.

===Monadic vs. dyadic peace===
Most research is regarding the &quot;dyadic&quot; peace, that democracies do not fight one another. Very few researchers have supported the &quot;monadic&quot; peace, that democracies are more peaceful in general. There are some recent papers that find a slight monadic effect. Müller and Wolff, in listing them, agree &quot;that democracies on average might be slightly, but not strongly, less warlike than other states,&quot; but general &quot;monadic explanations are neither necessary nor convincing.&quot; They note that democracies have varied greatly in their belligerence against non-democracies.

==Possible exceptions==

Some scholars support the democratic peace on probabilistic grounds: since many wars have been fought since democracies first arose, we might expect a proportionate number of wars to have occurred between democracies, if democracies fought each other as freely as other pairs of states; but proponents of democratic peace theory claim that the number is much less than might be expected. However, opponents of the theory argue this is mistaken and claim there are numerous examples of wars between democracies.

Historically, troublesome cases for the Democratic peace theory include the Sicilian Expedition, the War of 1812, the U.S. Civil War, the Fashoda Crisis, conflicts between Ecuador and Peru, the Cod Wars, the Spanish–American War, and the Kargil War. Doyle cites the Paquisha War and the Lebanese air force&#x27;s intervention in the Six-Day War. The total number of cases suggested in the literature is at least 50. The data set Bremer was using showed one exception, the French-Thai War of 1940; Gleditsch sees the state of war between Finland and United Kingdom during World War II, as a special case, which should probably be treated separately: an incidental state of war between democracies during large and complex war with hundreds of belligerents and the constant shifting of geopolitical and diplomatic boundaries. However, the British did conduct a few military actions of minor scope against the Finns, more to demonstrate their alliance with the Soviets than to actually engage in war with Finland. Page Fortna discusses the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus and the Kargil War as exceptions, finding the latter to be the most significant.

==Conflict initiation==
According to a 2017 review study, &quot;there is enough evidence to conclude that democracy does cause peace at least between democracies, that the observed correlation between democracy and peace is not spurious&quot;.

Most studies have looked only at who is involved in the conflicts and ignored the question of who initiated the conflict. In many conflicts both sides argue that the other side was the initiator. Several researchers have argued that studying conflict initiation is of limited value, because existing data about conflict initiation may be especially unreliable. Even so, several studies have examined this. Reitner and Stam argue that autocracies initiate conflicts against democracies more frequently than democracies do against autocracies. Quackenbush and Rudy, while confirming Reiter and Stam&#x27;s results, find that democracies initiate wars against non-democracies more frequently than non-democracies do to each other. Several following studies have studied how different types of autocracies with different institutions vary regarding conflict initiation. Personalistic and military dictatorships may be particularly prone to conflict initiation, as compared to other types of autocracy such as one-party states, but also more likely to be targeted in a war having other initiators.

One 2017 study found that democracies are no more likely to settle border disputes peacefully than non-democracies.

==Internal violence and genocide==

Most of this article discusses research on relations between states. However, there is also evidence that democracies have less internal systematic violence. For instance, one study finds that the most democratic and the most authoritarian states have few civil wars, and intermediate regimes the most. The probability for a civil war is also increased by political change, regardless whether toward greater democracy or greater autocracy. Intermediate regimes continue to be the most prone to civil war, regardless of the time since the political change. In the long run, since intermediate regimes are less stable than autocracies, which in turn are less stable than democracies, durable democracy is the most probable end-point of the process of democratization. Abadie&#x27;s study finds that the most democratic nations have the least terrorism. Harff finds that genocide and politicide are rare in democracies. Rummel finds that the more democratic a regime, the less its democide. He finds that democide has killed six times as many people as battles.

Davenport and Armstrong II list several other studies and states: &quot;Repeatedly, democratic political systems have been found to decrease political bans, censorship, torture, disappearances and mass killing, doing so in a linear fashion across diverse measurements, methodologies, time periods, countries, and contexts.&quot; It concludes: &quot;Across measures and methodological techniques, it is found that below a certain level, democracy has no impact on human rights violations, but above this level democracy influences repression in a negative and roughly linear manner.&quot; They also state that thirty years worth of statistical research has revealed that only two variables decrease human rights violations: political democracy and economic development.

Abulof and Goldman add a caveat, focusing on the contemporary Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Statistically, a MENA democracy makes a country more prone to both the onset and incidence of civil war, and the more democratic a MENA state is, the more likely it is to experience violent intrastate strife. Moreover, anocracies do not seem to be predisposed to civil war, either worldwide or in MENA. Looking for causality beyond correlation, they suggest that democracy&#x27;s pacifying effect is partly mediated through societal subscription to self-determination and popular sovereignty. This may turn “democratizing nationalism” to a long-term prerequisite, not just an immediate hindrance, to peace and democracy.

==Explanations==
These theories have traditionally been categorized into two groups: explanations that focus on democratic norms and explanations that focus on democratic political structures. They usually are meant to be explanations for little violence between democracies, not for a low level of internal violence in democracies.

Several of these mechanisms may also apply to countries of similar systems. The book &quot;Never at War&quot; finds evidence that the oligarchic republics common in ancient Greece and medieval and early modern Europe hardly ever made war on one another. One example is the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in which the Sejm resisted and vetoed most royal proposals for war, like those of Władysław IV Vasa.

A study by V-Dem Institute found both interbranch constraint on the executive and civil society activism as the mechanism for democratic peace but found accountability provided directly by elections not as crucial.

===Democratic norms===
One example from the first group is that liberal democratic culture may make the leaders accustomed to negotiation and compromise. Policy makers who have built their careers within a political culture of non-violent accommodations with domestic rivals, unlike autocrats who typically hold power through the threat of coercion, will be inclined toward non-violent methods abroad. Another that a belief in human rights may make people in democracies reluctant to go to war, especially against other democracies. The decline in colonialism, also by democracies, may be related to a change in perception of non-European peoples and their rights.

Bruce Russett also argues that the democratic culture affects the way leaders resolve conflicts. In addition, he holds that a social norm emerged toward the end of the nineteenth century; that democracies should not fight each other, which strengthened when the democratic culture and the degree of democracy increased, for example by widening the franchise. Increasing democratic stability allowed partners in foreign affairs to perceive a nation as reliably democratic. The alliances between democracies during the two World Wars and the Cold War also strengthened the norms. He sees less effective traces of this norm in Greek antiquity.

Hans Köchler relates the question of transnational democracy to empowering the individual citizen by involving him, through procedures of direct democracy, in a country&#x27;s international affairs, and he calls for the restructuring of the United Nations Organization according to democratic norms. He refers in particular to the Swiss practice of participatory democracy.

Mousseau argues that it is market-oriented development that creates the norms and values that explain both democracy and the peace. In less developed countries individuals often depend on social networks that impose conformity to in-group norms and beliefs, and loyalty to group leaders. When jobs are plentiful on the market, in contrast, as in market-oriented developed countries, individuals depend on a strong state that enforces contracts equally. Cognitive routines emerge of abiding by state law rather than group leaders, and, as in contracts, tolerating differences among individuals. Voters in marketplace democracies thus accept only impartial ‘liberal’ governments, and constrain leaders to pursue their interests in securing equal access to global markets and in resisting those who distort such access with force. Marketplace democracies thus share common foreign policy interests in the supremacy—and predictability—of international law over brute power politics, and equal and open global trade over closed trade and imperial preferences. When disputes do originate between marketplace democracies, they are less likely than others to escalate to violence because both states, even the stronger one, perceive greater long-term interests in the supremacy of law over power politics.

Braumoeller argues that liberal norms of conflict resolution vary because liberalism takes many forms. By examining survey results from the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, the author demonstrates that liberalism in that region bears a stronger resemblance to 19th-century liberal nationalism than to the sort of universalist, Wilsonian liberalism described by democratic peace theorists, and that, as a result, liberals in the region are &quot;more&quot;, not less, aggressive than non-liberals.

A 2013 study by Jessica Weeks and Michael Tomz found through survey experiments that the public was less supportive of war in cases involving fellow democracies.

===Democratic political structures===
The case for institutional constraints goes back to Immanuel Kant, who wrote:
Democracy thus gives influence to those most likely to be killed or wounded in wars, and their relatives and friends (and to those who pay the bulk of the war taxes.) This monadic theory must, however, explain why democracies do attack non-democratic states. One explanation is that these democracies were threatened or otherwise were provoked by the non-democratic states. Doyle argued that the absence of a monadic peace is only to be expected: the same ideologies that cause liberal states to be at peace with each other inspire idealistic wars with the illiberal, whether to defend oppressed foreign minorities or avenge countrymen settled abroad. Doyle also notes liberal states do conduct covert operations against each other; the covert nature of the operation, however, prevents the publicity otherwise characteristic of a free state from applying to the question.

Charles Lipson argues that four factors common in democracies give them a &quot;contracting advantage&quot; that leads to a dyadic democratic peace: (1) Greater transparency, (2) Greater continuity, (3) Electoral incentives for leaders to keep promises, and (4) Constitutional governance.

Studies show that democratic states are more likely than autocratic states to win the wars that they start. One explanation is that democracies, for internal political and economic reasons, have greater resources. This might mean that democratic leaders are unlikely to select other democratic states as targets because they perceive them to be particularly formidable opponents. One study finds that interstate wars have important impacts on the fate of political regimes, and that the probability that a political leader will fall from power in the wake of a lost war is particularly high in democratic states.

As described by Gelpi and Griesdorf, several studies have argued that liberal leaders face institutionalized constraints that impede their capacity to mobilize the state&#x27;s resources for war without the consent of a broad spectrum of interests. Survey results that compare the attitudes of citizens and elites in the Soviet successor states are consistent with this argument. Moreover, these constraints are readily apparent to other states and cannot be manipulated by leaders. Thus, democracies send credible signals to other states of an aversion to using force. These signals allow democratic states to avoid conflicts with one another, but they may attract aggression from non-democratic states. Democracies may be pressured to respond to such aggression—perhaps even preemptively—through the use of force. Also as described by Gelpi and Griesdorf, studies have argued that when democratic leaders do choose to escalate international crises, their threats are taken as highly credible, since there must be a relatively large public opinion for these actions. In disputes between liberal states, the credibility of their bargaining signals allows them to negotiate a peaceful settlement before mobilization. A 2017 study by Jeff Carter found evidence that democratic states are slower to mobilize for war.

An explanation based on game theory similar to the last two above is that the participation of the public and the open debate send clear and reliable information regarding the intentions of democracies to other states. In contrast, it is difficult to know the intentions of non-democratic leaders, what effect concessions will have, and if promises will be kept. Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a non-democracy.

The risk factors for certain types of state have, however, changed since Kant&#x27;s time. In the quote above, Kant points to the lack of popular support for war – first that the populace will directly or indirectly suffer in the event of war – as a reason why republics will not tend to go to war. The number of American troops killed or maimed versus the number of Iraqi soldiers and civilians maimed and killed in the American-Iraqi conflict is indicative. This may explain the relatively great willingness of democratic states to attack weak opponents: the Iraq war was, initially at least, highly popular in the United States. The case of the Vietnam War might, nonetheless, indicate a tipping point where publics may no longer accept continuing attrition of their soldiers (even while remaining relatively indifferent to the much higher loss of life on the part of the populations attacked).

Coleman uses economic cost-benefit analysis to reach conclusions similar to Kant&#x27;s. Coleman examines the polar cases of autocracy and liberal democracy. In both cases, the costs of war are assumed to be borne by the people. In autocracy, the autocrat receives the entire benefits of war, while in a liberal democracy the benefits are dispersed among the people. Since the net benefit to an autocrat exceeds the net benefit to a citizen of a liberal democracy, the autocrat is more likely to go to war. The disparity of benefits and costs can be so high that an autocrat can launch a welfare-destroying war when his net benefit exceeds the total cost of war. Contrarily, the net benefit of the same war to an individual in a liberal democracy can be negative so that he would not choose to go to war. This disincentive to war is increased between liberal democracies through their establishment of linkages, political and economic, that further raise the costs of war between them. Therefore, liberal democracies are less likely to go war, especially against each other. Coleman further distinguishes between offensive and defensive wars and finds that liberal democracies are less likely to fight defensive wars that may have already begun due to excessive discounting of future costs.

Brad LeVeck and Neil Narang argue that democratic states are less likely to produce decision-making errors in crises due to a larger and more diverse set of actors who are involved in the foreign policy decision-making process.

Using selectorate theory, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, James D. Morrow, Randolph M. Siverson and Alastair Smith argue that the democratic peace stems in part from the fact that democratic leaders sustain their power through large winning coalitions, which means that democratic leaders devote more resources to war, have an advantage in war, and choose wars that they are highly likely to win. These leads democratic states to avoid one another, but war with weak non-democratic states.

===Audience costs===
A prominent rational choice argument for the democratic peace is that democracies carry greater audience costs than authoritarian states, which makes them better at signaling their intentions in interstate disputes. Arguments regarding the credibility of democratic states in disputes has been subject to debate among international relations scholars. Two studies from 2001, using the MID and ICB datasets, provided empirical support for the notion that democracies were more likely to issue effective threats. However, a 2012 study by Alexander B. Downes and Todd S. Sechser found that existing datasets were not suitable to draw any conclusions as to whether democratic states issued more effective threats. They constructed their own dataset specifically for interstate military threats and outcomes, which found no relationship between regime type and effective threats. A 2017 study which recoded flaws in the MID dataset ultimately conclude, &quot;that there are no regime-based differences in dispute reciprocation, and prior findings may be based largely on poorly coded data.&quot; Other scholars have disputed the democratic credibility argument, questioning its causal logic and empirical validity. Research by Jessica Weeks argued that some authoritarian regime types have similar audience costs as in democratic states.

A 2021 study found that Americans perceived democracies to be more likely to back down in crises, which contradicts the expectations of the audience costs literature.

===Democracy differences===
One general criticism motivating research of different explanations is that actually the theory cannot claim that &quot;democracy causes peace&quot;, because the evidence for democracies being, in general, more peaceful is very slight or nonexistent; it only can support the claim that &quot;&quot;joint&quot; democracy causes peace&quot;. According to Rosato, this casts doubts on whether democracy is actually the cause because, if so, a monadic effect would be expected.

Perhaps the simplest explanation to such perceived anomaly (but not the one the Realist Rosato prefers, see the section on Realist explanations below) is that democracies are not peaceful to each other because they are democratic, but rather because they are similar in democratic scores. This line of thought started with several independent observations of an &quot;Autocratic Peace&quot; effect, a reduced probability of war (obviously no author claims its absence) between states which are both non-democratic, or both highly so. This has led to the hypothesis that democratic peace emerges as a particular case when analyzing a subset of states which are, in fact, similar. Or, that similarity in general does not solely affect the probability of war, but only coherence of strong political regimes such as full democracies and stark autocracies.

Autocratic peace and the explanation based on democratic similarity. is a relatively recent development, and opinions about its value are varied. Henderson builds a model considering political similarity, geographic distance and economic interdependence as its main variables, and concludes that democratic peace is a statistical artifact which disappears when the above variables are taken into account. Werner finds a conflict reducing effect from political similarity in general, but with democratic dyads being particularly peaceful, and noting some differences in behavior between democratic and autocratic dyads with respect to alliances and power evaluation. Beck, King, and Zeng use neural networks to show two distinct low probability zones, corresponding to high democracy and high autocracy. Petersen uses a different statistical model and finds that autocratic peace is not statistically significant, and that the effect attributed to similarity is mostly driven by the pacifying effect of joint democracy. Ray similarly disputes the weight of the argument on logical grounds, claiming that statistical analysis on &quot;political similarity&quot; uses a main variable which is an extension of &quot;joint democracy&quot; by linguistic redefinition, and so it is expected that the war reducing effects are carried on in the new analysis. Bennett builds a direct statistical model based on a triadic classification of states into &quot;democratic&quot;, &quot;autocratic&quot; and &quot;mixed&quot;. He finds that autocratic dyads have a 35% reduced chance of going into any type of armed conflict with respect to a reference mixed dyad. Democratic dyads have a 55% reduced chance. This effect gets stronger when looking at more severe conflicts; for wars (more than 1000 battle deaths), he estimates democratic dyads to have an 82% lower risk than autocratic dyads. He concludes that autocratic peace exists, but democratic peace is clearly stronger. However, he finds no relevant pacifying effect of political similarity, except at the extremes of the scale.

To summarize a rather complex picture, there are no less than four possible stances on the value of this criticism:
#Political similarity, plus some complementary variables, explains everything. Democratic peace is a statistical artifact. Henderson subscribes to this view.
#Political similarity has a pacifying effect, but democracy makes it stronger. Werner would probably subscribe to this view.
#Political similarity in general has little or no effect, except at the extremes of the democracy-autocracy scale: a democratic peace and an autocratic peace exist separately, with the first one being stronger, and may have different explanations. Bennett holds this view, and Kinsella mentions this as a possibility
#Political similarity has little or no effect and there is no evidence for autocratic peace. Petersen and Ray are among defendants of this view.

====Interactive model of democratic peace====
The interactive model of democratic peace is a combination of democratic similarity with the traditional model of democratic peace theory demonstrated on V-Dem Democracy Indices.

==Criticism==
There are several logically distinguishable classes of criticism. They usually apply to no wars or few MIDs between democracies, not to little systematic violence in established democracies. In addition, there have been a number of wars between democracies. The 1987–1989 JVP insurrection in Sri Lanka is an example in which politicide was committed by a democratic regime, resulting in the deaths of at least 13,000 and 30,000 suspected JVP members or alleged supporters.

===Statistical significance===
One study has argued that there have been as many wars between democracies as one would expect between any other couple of states. Its authors conclude that the argument for democratic peace &quot;rests in an ambiguity&quot;, since empirical evidence not confirm neither deny democratic pacifism, and strongly relies upon what degree of democracy makes a government democratic; according to them &quot;because perfect democracy is infeasible, one can always sidestep counter-evidence by raising the bar of democracy&quot;.

Others state that, although there may be some evidence for democratic peace, the data sample or the time span may be too small to assess any definitive conclusions. For example, Gowa finds evidence for democratic peace to be insignificant before 1939, because of the too small number of democracies, and offers an alternate realist explanation for the following period. Gowa&#x27;s use of statistics has been criticized, with several other studies and reviews finding different or opposing results. However, this can be seen as the longest-lasting criticism to the theory; as noted earlier, also some supporters agree that the statistical sample for assessing its validity is limited or scarce, at least if only full-scale wars are considered.

According to one study, which uses a rather restrictive definition of democracy and war, there were no wars between jointly democratic couples of states in the period from 1816 to 1992. Assuming a purely random distribution of wars between states, regardless of their democratic character, the predicted number of conflicts between democracies would be around ten. So, Ray argues that the evidence is statistically significant, but that it is still conceivable that, in the future, even a small number of inter-democratic wars would cancel out such evidence.

===Peace comes before democracy===

The territorial peace theory argues that peace leads to democracy more than democracy leads to peace. This argument is supported by historical studies showing that peace almost always comes before democracy and that states do not develop democracy until all border disputes have been settled. These studies indicate that there is strong evidence that peace causes democracy but little evidence that democracy causes peace.

The hypothesis that peace causes democracy is supported by psychological and cultural theories. Christian Welzel&#x27;s human empowerment theory posits that existential security leads to emancipative cultural values and support for a democratic political organization. This also follows from the so-called regality theory based on evolutionary psychology.

The territorial peace theory explains why countries in conflict with their neighbor countries are unlikely to develop democracy. The democratic peace theory is more relevant for peace between non-neighbor countries and for relations between countries that are already at peace with each other.

===Third factors causing both democracy and peace===
Several other theories argue that omitted variables explain both peace and democracy. 
Variables that may explain both democracy and peace include institutions, commerce, interdependence, alliances, US world dominance and political stability.

These theories are further explained under Other explanations.

===Wars against non-democracies===
Critics of Democratic Peace theory note that liberal states often engage in conflicts with non-liberal states they deem &quot;rogue,&quot; &quot;failed,&quot; or &quot;evil.&quot; Several studies fail to confirm that democracies are less likely to wage war than autocracies if wars against non-democracies are included.

===Signalling===
The notion that democracies can signal intentions more credibly has been disputed.

===Criticism of definitions, methodology and data===
Some authors criticize the definition of democracy by arguing that states continually reinterpret other states&#x27; regime types as a consequence of their own objective interests and motives, such as economic and security concerns. For example, one study reports that Germany was considered a democratic state by Western opinion leaders at the end of the 19th century; yet in the years preceding World War I, when its relations with the United States, France and Britain started deteriorating, Germany was gradually reinterpreted as an autocratic state, in absence of any actual regime change. Shimmin moves a similar criticism regarding the western perception of Milosevic&#x27;s Serbia between 1989 and 1999. Rummel replies to this criticism by stating that, in general, studies on democratic peace do not focus on other countries&#x27; perceptions of democracy; and in the specific case of Serbia, by arguing that the limited credit accorded by western democracies to Milosevic in the early 1990s did not amount to a recognition of democracy, but only to the perception that possible alternative leaders could be even worse.

Some democratic peace researchers have been criticized for &quot;post hoc&quot; reclassifying some specific conflicts as non-wars or political systems as non-democracies without checking and correcting the whole data set used similarly. Supporters and opponents of the democratic peace agree that this is bad use of statistics, even if a plausible case can be made for the correction. A military affairs columnist of the newspaper &quot;Asia Times&quot; has summarized the above criticism in a journalist&#x27;s fashion describing the theory as subject to the no true Scotsman problem: exceptions are explained away as not being between &quot;real&quot; democracies or &quot;real&quot; wars.

Some democratic peace researchers require that the executive result from a substantively contested election. This may be a restrictive definition: For example, the National Archives of the United States notes that &quot;For all intents and purposes, George Washington was unopposed for election as President, both in 1789 and 1792&quot;. (Under the original provisions for the Electoral College, there was no distinction between votes for president and Vice-president: each elector was required to vote for two distinct candidates, with the runner-up to be vice-president. Every elector cast one of his votes for Washington, John Adams received a majority of the other votes; there were several other candidates: so the election for vice president was contested.)

Spiro made several other criticisms of the statistical methods used. Russett and a series of papers described by Ray responded to this, for example with different methodology.

Sometimes the datasets used have also been criticized. For example, some authors have criticized the Correlates of War data for not including civilian deaths in the battle deaths count, especially in civil wars. Cohen and Weeks argue that most fishing disputes, which include no deaths and generally very limited threats of violence, should be excluded even from the list of military disputes. Gleditsch made several criticisms to the Correlates of War data set, and produced a revised set of data. Maoz and Russett made several criticisms to the Polity I and II data sets, which have mostly been addressed in later versions.

The most comprehensive critique points out that &quot;democracy&quot; is rarely defined, never refers to substantive democracy, is unclear about causation, has been refuted in more than 100 studies, fails to account for some 200 deviant cases, and has been promoted ideologically to justify one country seeking to expand democracy abroad. Most studies treat the complex concept of &quot;democracy&quot; as a bivariate variable rather than attempting to dimensionalize the concept. Studies also fail to take into account the fact that there are dozens of types of democracy, so the results are meaningless unless articulated to a particular type of democracy or claimed to be true for all types, such as consociational or economic democracy, with disparate datasets.

===Microfoundations===
Recent work into the democratic norms explanations shows that the microfoundations on which this explanation rest do not find empirical support. Within most earlier studies, the presence of liberal norms in democratic societies and their subsequent influence on the willingness to wage war was merely assumed, never measured. Moreover, it was never investigated whether or not these norms are absent within other regime-types. Two recent studies measured the presence of liberal norms and investigated the assumed effect of these norms on the willingness to wage war. The results of both studies show that liberal democratic norms are not only present within liberal democracies, but also within other regime-types. Moreover, these norms are not of influence on the willingness to attack another state during an interstate conflict at the brink of war.

Sebastian Rosato argues that democratic peace theory makes several false assumptions. Firstly, it assumes that democratic populaces will react negatively to the costs of war upon them. However, in modern wars casualties tend to be fairly low and soldiers are largely volunteers, meaning they accept the risks of fighting, so their families and friends, whom the cost of their death falls on heaviest, are less likely to criticise the government than the families and friends of conscripted soldiers. Secondly, democratic peace theory ignores the role of nationalism; democratic populaces are just as likely to be influenced by nationalist sentiment as anyone else and if a democratic populace believes that a war is necessary for their nation, the populace will support it. Lastly, democratic leaders are as likely to guide public opinion as they are to follow it. Democratic leaders are often aware of the power of nationalist sentiment and thus seek to encourage it when it comes to war, arguing that war is necessary to defend or spread the nation&#x27;s way of life. Democratic leaders may even have an advatange over authoritarians in this regard, as they can be seen as more legitimately representative. Rosato argues that this does not just apply to wars of defence but also aggression; democratic populaces can be roused by nationalist feelings to support aggressive wars if they are seen as in the national interest.

Rosato also argues that authoritarian leaders have a reduced incentive to go to war because civilian control over the military is less guaranteed in autocracies; there is always the risk the military could subvert civilian leadership and a war which results in defeat could swiftly result in a coup. Even military dictators run the risk of internal dissent within the armed forces. Autocratic leaders in general also risk unleashing political and social turmoil that could destroy them if they go to war. Conversely, bellicose democratic leaders can rely on the acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the democratic process, as pacifist actors in democracies will need to respect the legitimacy of a democratically elected government. If pro-war groups can capture the organs of the state in a democracy legitimately, then anti-war groups will have little means of opposing them outside of extra-constitutional means, which would likely backfire and cause the anti-war groups to lose legitimacy.

A 2017 study found that public opinion in China showed the same reluctance in going to war as publics in democratic states, which suggests that publics in democratic states are not generally more opposed to war than publics in authoritarian states.

===Limited consequences===
The peacefulness may have various limitations and qualifiers and may not actually mean very much in the real world.

Democratic peace researchers do in general not count as wars conflicts which do not kill a thousand on the battlefield; thus they exclude for example the bloodless Cod Wars. However, research has also found a peacefulness between democracies when looking at lesser conflicts.

Liberal democracies have less of these wars than other states after 1945. This might be related to changes in the perception of non-European peoples, as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Related to this is the human rights violations committed against native people, sometimes by liberal democracies. One response is that many of the worst crimes were committed by non-democracies, like in the European colonies before the nineteenth century, in King Leopold II of Belgium&#x27;s privately owned Congo Free State, and in Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union. The United Kingdom abolished slavery in British territory in 1833, immediately after the Reform Act 1832 had significantly enlarged the franchise. (Of course, the abolition of the slave trade had been enacted in 1807; and many DPT supporters would deny that the UK was a liberal democracy in 1833 when examining interstate wars.)

Hermann and Kegley Jr. argue that interventions between democracies are more likely to happen than projected by an expected model. They further argue that democracies are more likely to intervene in other liberal states than against countries that are non-democracies. Finally, they argue that these interventions between democracies have been increasing over time and that the world can expect more of these interventions in the future. The methodology used has been criticized and more recent studies have found opposing results.

Rummel argues that the continuing increase in democracy worldwide will soon lead to an end to wars and democide, possibly around or even before the middle of this century. The fall of Communism and the increase in the number of democratic states were accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in total warfare, interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, and the number of refugees and displaced persons. One report claims that the two main causes of this decline in warfare are the end of the Cold War itself and decolonization; but also claims that the three Kantian factors have contributed materially.

===Historical periods===
Economic historians Joel Mokyr and Hans-Joachim Voth argue that democratic states may have been more vulnerable to conquest because the rulers in those states were too heavily constrained. Absolutist rulers in other states could, however, operate more freely.

===Covert operations and proxy wars===
Critics of the democratic peace theory have pointed to covert operations and military interventions between democracies, and argued that these interventions indicate that democracies do not necessarily trust and respect each other. Alexander B. Downes and Lary Lauren Lilley argue that covert operations conducted by democratic states has different implications depending on which version of democratic peace theory one adheres to. They argue that covert operations are inconsistent with variants of democratic peace theory that emphasize norms and checks-and-balances, but that covert operations may be more consistent with versions of democratic peace theory that rely on selectorate theory&#x27;s notion of large versus small winning coalitions.

A 2015 study by Michael Poznansky reconciles findings that democracies engage in covert interventions against one another by arguing that democracies do so when they expect another state&#x27;s democratic character to break down or decay.

A 2022 study found that democracies rarely wage proxy wars against fellow democracies: &quot;strong democratic institutions prevent elected leaders from engaging in proxy war against sister regimes, and embargo violations tend to occur when democratic institutions are weak.&quot;

===Information manipulation===
Chaim Kaufmann argues that the lead-up to the Iraq War demonstrates that constraints on war in democracies may hinge on whether democratic governments can control and manipulate information, and suppress intelligence findings that run counter to administration rhetoric, as well as whether there is a strong opposition party and powerful media.

===Coup by provoking a war===
Many democracies become non-democratic by war, as being aggressed or as aggressor (quickly after a coup), sometimes the coup leader worked to provoke that war.

Carl Schmitt wrote on how to overrule a Constitution: &quot;Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.&quot; Schmitt, again on the need for internal (and foreign) enemies because they are useful to persuade the people not to trust anyone more than the Leader: &quot;As long as the state is a political entity this requirement for internal peace compels it in critical situations to decide also upon the domestic enemy. Every state provides, therefore, some kind of formula for the declaration of an internal enemy.&quot; Whatever opposition will be pictured and intended as the actual foreign enemy&#x27;s puppet.

==Other explanations==
===Economic factors===
The capitalist peace, or capitalist peace theory, posits that according to given criteria for economic development (capitalism), developed economies have not engaged in war with each other, and rarely enter into low-level disputes. These theories have been proposed as an explanation for democratic peace by accounting for both democracy and the peace among democratic nations. The exact nature of the causality depends upon both the proposed variable and the measure of the indicator for the concept used.

A majority of researchers on the determinants of democracy agree that economic development is a primary factor which allows the formation of a stable and healthy democracy. Thus, some researchers have argued that economic development also plays a factor in the establishment of peace.

Mousseau argues that a culture of contracting in advanced market-oriented economies may cause both democracy and peace. These studies indicate that democracy, alone, is an unlikely cause of the democratic peace. A low level of market-oriented economic development may hinder development of liberal institutions and values. Hegre and Souva confirmed these expectations. Mousseau finds that democracy is a significant factor only when both democracies have levels of economic development well above the global median. In fact, the poorest 21% of the democracies studied, and the poorest 4–5% of current democracies, are significantly likely than other kinds of countries to fight each other. Mousseau, Hegre, and Oneal confirm that if at least one of the democracies involved has a very low level of economic development, democracy is ineffective in preventing war; however, they find that when also controlling for trade, 91% of all the democratic pairs had high enough development for the pacifying effect of democracy to be important during the 1885–1992 period and all in 1992. The difference in results of these two studies may be due to sampling: Mousseau&#x27;s 2005 study observed only neighboring states where poor countries actually can fight each other. In fact, fully 89% of militarized conflicts between less developed countries from 1920 and 2000 were among directly contiguous neighbors. He argues that it is not likely that the results can be explained by trade: Because developed states have large economies, they do not have high levels of trade interdependence. In fact, the correlation of developed democracy with trade interdependence is a scant 0.06 (Pearson&#x27;s &quot;r&quot; – considered substantively no correlation by statisticians.)

Both World Wars were fought between countries which can be considered economically developed. Mousseau argues that both Germany and Japan – like the USSR during the Cold War and Saudi Arabia today – had state-managed economies and thus lacked his market norms. Hegre finds that democracy is correlated with civil peace only for developed countries, and for countries with high levels of literacy. Conversely, the risk of civil war decreases with development only for democratic countries.

Gartzke argues that economic freedom (a quite different concept from Mousseau&#x27;s market norms) or financial dependence explains the developed democratic peace, and these countries may be weak on these dimensions too. Rummel criticizes Gartzke&#x27;s methodology and argues that his results are invalid.

Allan Dafoe, John R. Oneal, and Bruce Russett have challenged Gartzke and Mousseau&#x27;s research.

Several studies find that democracy, more trade causing greater economic interdependence, and membership in more intergovernmental organizations reduce the risk of war. This is often called the Kantian peace theory since it is similar to Kant&#x27;s earlier theory about a perpetual peace; it is often also called &quot;liberal peace&quot; theory, especially when one focuses on the effects of trade and democracy. (The theory that free trade can cause peace is quite old and referred to as Cobdenism.) Many researchers agree that these variables positively affect each other but each has a separate pacifying effect. For example, in countries exchanging a substantial amount of trade, economic interest groups may exist that oppose a reciprocal disruptive war, but in democracy such groups may have more power, and the political leaders be more likely to accept their requests. Weede argues that the pacifying effect of free trade and economic interdependence may be more important than that of democracy, because the former affects peace both directly and indirectly, by producing economic development and ultimately, democracy. Weede also lists some other authors supporting this view. However, some recent studies find no effect from trade but only from democracy.

None of the authors listed argues that free trade alone causes peace. Even so, the issue of whether free trade or democracy is more important in maintaining peace may have potentially significant practical consequences, for example on evaluating the effectiveness of applying economic sanctions and restrictions to autocratic countries.

It was Michael Doyle who reintroduced Kant&#x27;s three articles into democratic peace theory. He argued that a pacific union of liberal states has been growing for the past two centuries. He denies that a pair of states will be peaceful simply because they are both liberal democracies; if that were enough, liberal states would not be aggressive towards weak non-liberal states (as the history of American relations with Mexico shows they are). Rather, liberal democracy is a necessary condition for international organization and hospitality (which are Kant&#x27;s other two articles)—and all three are sufficient to produce peace. Other Kantians have not repeated Doyle&#x27;s argument that all three in the triad must be present, instead stating that all three reduce the risk of war.

Immanuel Wallerstein has argued that it is the global capitalist system that creates shared interests among the dominant parties, thus inhibiting potentially harmful belligerence.

Toni Negri and Michael Hardt take a similar stance, arguing that the intertwined network of interests in the global capitalism leads to the decline of individual nation states, and the rise of a global &quot;Empire&quot; which has no outside, and no external enemies. As a result, they write, &quot;The era of imperialist, interimperialist, and anti-imperialist wars is over. (...) we have entered the era of minor and internal conflicts. Every imperial war is a civil war, a police action&quot;.

===Other explanations===
Many studies supporting the theory have controlled for many possible alternative causes of the peace. Examples of factors controlled for are geographic distance, geographic contiguity, power status, alliance ties, militarization, economic wealth and economic growth, power ratio, and political stability. These studies have often found very different results depending on methodology and included variables, which has caused criticism. DPT does not state democracy is the only thing affecting the risk of military conflict. Many of the mentioned studies have found that other factors are also important.

Several studies have also controlled for the possibility of reverse causality from peace to democracy. For example, one study supports the theory of simultaneous causation, finding that dyads involved in wars are likely to experience a decrease in joint democracy, which in turn increases the probability of further war. So they argue that disputes between democratizing or democratic states should be resolved externally at a very early stage, in order to stabilize the system. Another study finds that peace does not spread democracy, but spreading democracy is likely to spread peace. A different kind of reverse causation lies in the suggestion that impending war could destroy or decrease democracy, because the preparation for war might include political restrictions, which may be the cause for the findings of democratic peace. However, this hypothesis has been statistically tested in a study whose authors find, depending on the definition of the pre-war period, no such effect or a very slight one. So, they find this explanation unlikely. This explanation would predict a monadic effect, although weaker than the dyadic one.

Weart argues that the peacefulness appears and disappears rapidly when democracy appears and disappears. This in his view makes it unlikely that variables that change more slowly are the explanation. Weart, however, has been criticized for not offering any quantitative analysis supporting his claims.

Wars tend very strongly to be between neighboring states. Gleditsch showed that the average distance between democracies is about 8000 miles, the same as the average distance between all states. He believes that the effect of distance in preventing war, modified by the democratic peace, explains the incidence of war as fully as it can be explained.

A 2020 study in &quot;International Organization&quot; found that it was not democracy per se that reduces the prospects for conflict, but whether women&#x27;s suffrage was ensured. The study argued, &quot;women&#x27;s more pacific preferences generate a dyadic democratic peace (i.e., between democracies), as well as a monadic peace.&quot;

According to Azar Gat&#x27;s &quot;War in Human Civilization&quot;, there are several related and independent factors that contribute to democratic societies being more peaceful than other forms of governments:
#Wealth and comfort: Increased prosperity in democratic societies has been associated with peace because civilians are less willing to endure hardship of war and military service due to a more luxurious life at home than in pre-modern times. Increased wealth has worked to decrease war through comfort.
#Metropolitan service society: The majority of army recruits come from the countryside or factory workers. Many believe that these types of people are suited for war. But as technology progressed the army turned more towards advanced services in information that rely more on computerized data which urbanized people are recruited more for this service.
#Sexual revolution: The availability of sex due to the pill and women joining the labor market could be another factor that has led to less enthusiasm for men to go to war. Young men are more reluctant leave behind the pleasures of life for the rigors and chastity of the army.
#Fewer young males: There is greater life expectancy which leads to fewer young males. Young males are the most aggressive and the ones that join the army the most. With fewer younger males in developed societies could help explain more pacificity.
#Fewer children per family (lower fertility rate): During pre modern times it was always hard for families to lose a child but in modern times it has become more difficult due to more families having only one or two children. It has become even harder for parents to risk the loss of a child in war. However, Gat recognizes that this argument is a difficult one because during pre modern times the life expectancy was not high for children and bigger families were necessary.
#Women&#x27;s franchise: Women are less overtly aggressive than men. Therefore, women are less inclined to serious violence and do not support it as much as men do. In liberal democracies women have been able to influence the government by getting elected. Electing more women could have an effect on whether liberal democracies take a more aggressive approach on certain issues.
#Nuclear weapons: Nuclear weapons could be the reason for not having a great power war. Many believe that a nuclear war would result in mutually assured destruction (MAD) which means that both countries involved in a nuclear war have the ability to strike the other until both sides are wiped out. This results in countries not wanting to strike the other for fear of being wiped out.

===Realist explanations===
Supporters of realism in international relations in general argue that not democracy or its absence, but considerations and evaluations of power, cause peace or war. Specifically, many realist critics claim that the effect ascribed to democratic, or liberal, peace, is in fact due to alliance ties between democratic states which in turn are caused, one way or another, by realist factors.

For example, Farber and Gowa find evidence for peace between democracies to be statistically significant only in the period from 1945 on, and consider such peace an artifact of the Cold War, when the threat from the communist states forced democracies to ally with one another. Mearsheimer offers a similar analysis of the Anglo-American peace before 1945, caused by the German threat. Spiro finds several instances of wars between democracies, arguing that evidence in favor of the theory might be not so vast as other authors report, and claims that the remaining evidence consists of peace between allied states with shared objectives. He acknowledges that democratic states might have a somewhat greater tendency to ally with one another, and regards this as the only real effect of democratic peace. Rosato argues that most of the significant evidence for democratic peace has been observed after World War II; and that it has happened within a broad alliance, which can be identified with NATO and its satellite nations, imposed and maintained by American dominance as part of &quot;Pax Americana&quot;. One of the main points in Rosato&#x27;s argument is that, although never engaged in open war with another liberal democracy during the Cold War, the United States intervened openly or covertly in the political affairs of democratic states several times, for example in the Chilean coup of 1973, the Operation Ajax (1953 coup in Iran) and Operation PBSuccess (1954 coup in Guatemala); in Rosato&#x27;s view, these interventions show the United States&#x27; determination to maintain an &quot;imperial peace&quot;.

The most direct counter arguments to such criticisms have been studies finding peace between democracies to be significant even when controlling for &quot;common interests&quot; as reflected in alliance ties. Regarding specific issues, Ray objects that explanations based on the Cold War should predict that the Communist bloc would be at peace within itself also, but exceptions include the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, the Cambodian-Vietnamese War, and the Sino-Vietnamese War. Ray also argues that the external threat did not prevent conflicts in the Western bloc when at least one of the involved states was a non-democracy, such as the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus (against Greek Junta supported Cypriot Greeks), the Falklands War, and the Football War. Also, one study notes that the explanation &quot;goes increasingly stale as the post-Cold War world accumulates an increasing number of peaceful dyad-years between democracies&quot;. Rosato&#x27;s argument about American dominance has also been criticized for not giving supporting statistical evidence.

Some realist authors also criticize in detail the explanations first by supporters of democratic peace, pointing to supposed inconsistencies or weaknesses.

Rosato criticizes most explanations to how democracy might cause peace. Arguments based on normative constraints, he argues, are not consistent with the fact that democracies do go to war no less than other states, thus violating norms preventing war; for the same reason he refutes arguments based on the importance of public opinion. Regarding explanations based on greater accountability of leaders, he finds that historically autocratic leaders have been removed or punished more often than democratic leaders when they get involved in costly wars. Finally, he also criticizes the arguments that democracies treat each other with trust and respect even during crises; and that democracy might be slow to mobilize its composite and diverse groups and opinions, hindering the start of a war, drawing support from other authors. Another realist, Layne, analyzes the crises and brinkmanship that took place between non-allied democratic great powers, during the relatively brief period when such existed. He finds no evidence either of institutional or cultural constraints against war; indeed, there was popular sentiment in favor of war on both sides. Instead, in all cases, one side concluded that it could not afford to risk that war at that time, and made the necessary concessions.

Rosato&#x27;s objections have been criticized for claimed logical and methodological errors, and for being contradicted by existing statistical research. Russett replies to Layne by re-examining some of the crises studied in his article, and reaching different conclusions; Russett argues that perceptions of democracy prevented escalation, or played a major role in doing so. Also, a recent study finds that, while in general the outcome of international disputes is highly influenced by the contenders&#x27; relative military strength, this is not true if both contenders are democratic states; in this case the authors find the outcome of the crisis to be independent of the military capabilities of contenders, which is contrary to realist expectations. Finally, both the realist criticisms here described ignore new possible explanations, like the game-theoretic one discussed below.

===Nuclear deterrent===
A different kind of realist criticism stresses the role of nuclear weapons in maintaining peace. In realist terms, this means that, in the case of disputes between nuclear powers, respective evaluation of power might be irrelevant because of Mutual assured destruction preventing both sides from foreseeing what could be reasonably called a &quot;victory&quot;. The 1999 Kargil War between India and Pakistan has been cited as a counterexample to this argument, though this was a small, regional conflict and the threat of WMDs being used contributed to its de-escalation.

Some supporters of the democratic peace do not deny that realist factors are also important. Research supporting the theory has also shown that factors such as alliance ties and major power status influence interstate conflict behavior.

==Statistical difficulties due to newness of democracy==
One problem with the research on wars is that, as the Realist John Mearsheimer put it, &quot;democracies have been few in number over the past two centuries, and thus there have been few opportunities where democracies were in a position to fight one another&quot;. Democracies have been very rare until recently. Even looser definitions of democracy, such as Doyle&#x27;s, find only a dozen democracies before the late nineteenth century, and many of them short-lived or with limited franchise. Freedom House finds no independent state with universal suffrage in 1900.

Wayman, a supporter of the theory, states that &quot;If we rely solely on whether there has been an inter-democratic war, it is going to take many more decades of peace to build our confidence in the stability of the democratic peace&quot;.

===Studying lesser conflicts===
Many researchers have reacted to this limitation by studying lesser conflicts instead, since they have been far more common. There have been many more MIDs than wars; the Correlates of War Project counts several thousand during the last two centuries. A review lists many studies that have reported that democratic pairs of states are less likely to be involved in MIDs than other pairs of states.

Another study finds that after both states have become democratic, there is a decreasing probability for MIDs within a year and this decreases almost to zero within five years.

When examining the inter-liberal MIDs in more detail, one study finds that they are less likely to involve third parties, and that the target of the hostility is less likely to reciprocate, if the target reciprocates the response is usually proportional to the provocation, and the disputes are less likely to cause any loss of life. The most common action was &quot;Seizure of Material or Personnel&quot;.

Studies find that the probability that disputes between states will be resolved peacefully is positively affected by the degree of democracy exhibited by the lesser democratic state involved in that dispute. Disputes between democratic states are significantly shorter than disputes involving at least one undemocratic state. Democratic states are more likely to be amenable to third party mediation when they are involved in disputes with each other.

In international crises that include the threat or use of military force, one study finds that if the parties are democracies, then relative military strength has no effect on who wins. This is different from when non-democracies are involved. These results are the same also if the conflicting parties are formal allies. Similarly, a study of the behavior of states that joined ongoing militarized disputes reports that power is important only to autocracies: democracies do not seem to base their alignment on the power of the sides in the dispute.

==Academic relevance and derived studies==
Democratic peace theory is a well established research field with more than a hundred authors having published articles about it. Several peer-reviewed studies mention in their introduction that most researchers accept the theory as an empirical fact. According to a 2021 study by Kosuke Imai and James Lo, &quot;overturning the negative association between democracy and conflict would require a confounder that is forty-seven times more prevalent in democratic dyads than in other dyads. To put this number in context, the relationship between democracy and peace is at least five times as robust as that between smoking and lung cancer. To explain away the democratic peace, therefore, scholars would have to find far more powerful confounders than those already identified in the literature.&quot;

Imre Lakatos suggested that what he called a &quot;progressive research program&quot; is better than a &quot;degenerative&quot; one when it can explain the same phenomena as the &quot;degenerative&quot; one, but is also characterized by growth of its research field and the discovery of important novel facts. In contrast, the supporters of the &quot;degenerative&quot; program do not make important new empirical discoveries, but instead mostly apply adjustments to their theory in order to defend it from competitors. Some researchers argue that democratic peace theory is now the &quot;progressive&quot; program in international relations. According to these authors, the theory can explain the empirical phenomena previously explained by the earlier dominant research program, realism in international relations; in addition, the initial statement that democracies do not, or rarely, wage war on one another, has been followed by a rapidly growing literature on novel empirical regularities.

Other examples are several studies finding that democracies are more likely to ally with one another than with other states, forming alliances which are likely to last longer than alliances involving non-democracies; several studies showing that democracies conduct diplomacy differently and in a more conciliatory way compared to non-democracies; one study finding that democracies with proportional representation are in general more peaceful regardless of the nature of the other party involved in a relationship; and another study reporting that proportional representation system and decentralized territorial autonomy is positively associated with lasting peace in postconflict societies.

==Influence==
The democratic peace theory has been extremely divisive among political scientists. It is rooted in the idealist and classical liberalist traditions and is opposed to the dominant theory of realism.

In the United States, presidents from both major parties have expressed support for the theory. In his 1994 State of the Union address, then-President Bill Clinton, a member of the Democratic Party, said: &quot;Ultimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don&#x27;t attack each other&quot;. In a 2004 press conference, then-President George W. Bush, a member of the Republican Party, said: &quot;And the reason why I&#x27;m so strong on democracy is democracies don&#x27;t go to war with each other. And the reason why is the people of most societies don&#x27;t like war, and they understand what war means... I&#x27;ve got great faith in democracies to promote peace. And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m such a strong believer that the way forward in the Middle East, the broader Middle East, is to promote democracy.&quot;

In a 1999 speech, Chris Patten, the then-European Commissioner for External Relations, said: &quot;Inevitable because the EU was formed partly to protect liberal values, so it is hardly surprising that we should think it appropriate to speak out. But it is also sensible for strategic reasons. Free societies tend not to fight one another or to be bad neighbours&quot;. The &quot;A Secure Europe in a Better World, European Security Strategy&quot; states: &quot;The best protection for our security is a world of well-governed democratic states.&quot; Tony Blair has also claimed the theory is correct.

===As justification for initiating war===
Some fear that the democratic peace theory may be used to justify wars against non-democracies in order to bring lasting peace, in a &quot;democratic crusade&quot;. Woodrow Wilson in 1917 asked Congress to declare war against Imperial Germany, citing Germany&#x27;s sinking of American ships due to unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmermann telegram, but also stating that &quot;A steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of democratic nations&quot; and &quot;The world must be made safe for democracy.&quot; R. J. Rummel was a notable proponent of war for the purpose of spreading democracy, based on this theory.

Some point out that the democratic peace theory has been used to justify the 2003 Iraq War, others argue that this justification was used only after the war had already started. Furthermore, Weede has argued that the justification is extremely weak, because forcibly democratizing a country completely surrounded by non-democracies, most of which are full autocracies, as Iraq was, is at least as likely to increase the risk of war as it is to decrease it (some studies show that dyads formed by one democracy and one autocracy are the most warlike, and several find that the risk of war is greatly increased in democratizing countries surrounded by non-democracies). According to Weede, if the United States and its allies wanted to adopt a rationale strategy of forced democratization based on democratic peace, which he still does not recommend, it would be best to start intervening in countries which border with at least one or two stable democracies, and expand gradually. Also, research shows that attempts to create democracies by using external force has often failed. Gleditsch, Christiansen, and Hegre argue that forced democratization by interventionism may initially have partial success, but often create an unstable democratizing country, which can have dangerous consequences in the long run. Those attempts which had a permanent and stable success, like democratization in Austria, West Germany and Japan after World War II, mostly involved countries which had an advanced economic and social structure already, and implied a drastic change of the whole political culture. Supporting internal democratic movements and using diplomacy may be far more successful and less costly. Thus, the theory and related research, if they were correctly understood, may actually be an argument against a democratic crusade.

Michael Haas has written perhaps the most trenchant critique of a hidden normative agenda. Among the points raised: Due to sampling manipulation, the research creates the impression that democracies can justifiably fight non-democracies, snuff out budding democracies, or even impose democracy. And due to sloppy definitions, there is no concern that democracies continue undemocratic practices yet remain in the sample as if pristine democracies.

This criticism is confirmed by David Keen who finds that almost all historical attempts to impose democracy by violent means have failed.

==Related theories==
===Republican liberalism===
Republican liberalism is a variation of Democratic Peace Theory which claims that liberal and republican democracies will rarely go to war with each other. It argues that these governments are more peaceful than non-democracies and will avoid conflict when possible. According to Micheal Doyle, there are three main reasons for this: Democracies tend to have similar domestic political cultures, they share common morals, and their economic systems are interdependent. Liberal democracies (republics) that trade with each other, are economically dependent on one another and therefore, will always attempt to maintain diplomatic relations as to not disrupt their economies.

Liberalism, as an overarching theory, holds that diplomacy and cooperation is the most effective way to avoid war and maintain peace. This is contrasting to the theory of realism, which states that conflict will always be recurrent in the international system, whether due to human nature or the anarchic international system.

The concept of Republican liberalism is thought to have initially originated from Immanuel Kant&#x27;s book &quot;Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch&quot; (1795). The term &quot;Perpetual Peace&quot; refers to the permanent establishment of peace, and was made notorious by the book. Democratic peace, commercial peace and institutional peace were all advanced in the book as well. It takes a rather utopian view, that humanities&#x27; desire for peace will out compete humanities&#x27; desire for war.

===Kantian liberalism===
Kant and the liberal school of thought view international co-operation as a more rational option for states than resorting to war. However, the neo-liberal approach concedes to the realist school of thought, that when states cooperate it is simply because it is in their best interest. Kant insisted that a world with only peace was possible, and he offered three definitive articles that would create the pathway for it. Each went on to become a dominant strain of post–World War II liberal international relations theory.

I: &quot;The Civil Constitution of Every State should be Republican&quot;

Kant believed that every state should have Republican style form of government. As in, a state where &quot;supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives.&quot; Kant saw this in Ancient Rome, where they began to move away from Athenian democracy (direct democracy) and towards a representative democracy. Kant believed giving the citizens the right to vote and decide for themselves would lead to shorter wars and less wars. He also thought it was important to &quot;check the power of monarchs&quot;, to establish a system of checks and balances where no one person holds absolute power. Peace is always dependent on the internal character of governments. Republics, with a legislative body that will be able to hold the executive leader in check and maintain the peace.

II: &quot;The Law of Nations shall be founded on a Federation of Free States&quot;

Kant argues nations, like individuals can be tempted to harm each other at any given moment. So, rule of law should be established internationally. Without international laws and courts of judgement, then force would be the only way to settle disputes. States ought to instead develop international organisations and rules that facilitate cooperation. In any case, some kind of federation is necessary in order to maintain peace between nations. Contemporary examples include the United Nations and the European Union, which try to maintain peace and encourage cooperation among nations.

III: &quot;The Law of World Citizenship shall be Limited to Conditions of Universal Hospitality&quot;

Kant is referring to &quot;the right of the stranger to not to be treated as an enemy when he arrives in the land of another.&quot;. So long &quot;stranger&quot; is peaceful, he should not be treated with hostility. However, this is not the right to be a &quot;permanent visitor&quot;, simply as a temporary stay. This is applicable in the contemporary world when a country is receiving a world leader. The host country usually holds a state welcoming ceremony which strengthens diplomatic relations.

===European peace===
There is significant debate over whether the lack of any major European general wars since 1945 is due to cooperation and integration of liberal-democratic European states themselves (as in the European Union or Franco-German cooperation), an enforced peace due to the intervention of the Soviet Union and the United States until 1989 and the United States alone thereafter, or a combination of both. The debate over this theory was thrust in the public eye when the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the European Union for its role in creating peace in Europe. Notable major wars in Europe after 1945 are Yugoslav Wars and Russian invasion of Ukraine, which follows the prediction of the interactive model of democratic peace.

<text>Melchor Díaz (1505 – January 1541) was a Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; who was Governor of Culiacan. He is best known for leading a 25-man auxiliary party during the 1540 Coronado expedition. In December 1540 Díaz crossed the Colorado River which he named the Rio de Tizon (River of Embers), making him the first European in the modern state of California to set foot and explore west of the Colorado River, reaching mudpots near Cerro Prieto, and in the Imperial Valley.

During his Colorado River exploration Díaz was intending to find a route to the &quot;Southern Sea&quot; however low supplies combined with a freak accident on Díaz forced the party back to Corazon Valley in Sonora, New Spain.

Díaz was part of the Spanish explorers and conquistadors who began the first phase of the Spanish colonization of California.

==Personal life==
Díaz was described by historical writer George Parker Winship as &quot;a hard worker and skillful organizer and leader&quot;, who &quot;inspired confidence in his companions and followers, and always maintained the best of order and of diligence among those who were under his charge&quot;.

==1539 expedition==
He was placed in charge of the town of San Miguel de Culiacán by Nuño de Guzmán. When in 1539, Fray Marcos de Niza returned from Pimería Alta reporting he had seen the fabled cities of Cibola, Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza sent Díaz as the leader of a small expedition preliminarily to determine if reports by Fray Marcos were true. The information he gained was to benefit Coronado&#x27;s planned and much larger expedition. He departed on November 17, 1539.

==Coronado 1540 expedition==
When Díaz failed to return at the expected time, Coronado embarked without him in February 1540. Díaz and Coronado met en route, and Díaz joined Coronado&#x27;s group. Coronado then sent him on his second expedition to locate and investigate some villages reported in the area. He found the villages and reported they did not live up to the grand descriptions that had been given. Díaz was then sent ahead by Coronado to secure feed for the expedition&#x27;s livestock.

In July 1540, Díaz was sent to take the now-mistrusted and hated Fray Marcos back to Mexico and (say some reports) to take over leadership of the outpost at San Geronimo (or Hieronimo) in the valley of Corazones, now Ures, Sonora, and from there to attempt contact with the fleet of Hernando de Alarcón, which was to be the maritime arm of Coronado&#x27;s expedition. In September 1540, he began his third expedition, traveling overland to the head of the Gulf of California. Near the confluence of what is now the Colorado and Gila Rivers he learned from the natives that Alarcon had departed, but had left a cache of supplies and correspondence, which he located. The message basically stated that Díaz crossed the Colorado River, becoming the first European to do so, and named it Rio del Tizon (&quot;River of Embers&quot; or &quot;Firebrand River&quot;) from the practice of the natives for keeping themselves warm. He was impressed with the physical strength of the natives of the area. He explored for four days west of the Colorado, perhaps as far as the Imperial Valley.

==Death and legacy==
While on this expedition (reports vary, some saying it ended further exploration, others saying it occurred while on the return) Díaz accidentally suffered a mortal wound. He threw a lance at a dog that was attacking their sheep. The lance stuck into the ground and before he could stop, Díaz&#x27;s momentum impaled his groin on the back end of the lance. He lingered for twenty days but died en route in January 1541. The rest of the expedition arrived on 18 January 1541, in San Jeronimo de los Corazones, Sonora.

Because of his untimely death, we do not have the kind of memoirs commonly written by other Spanish explorers. The reports that he made in the course of his expeditions, however, were quite detailed and contributed much to the knowledge of the area and the times for both contemporary and later readers. His name for the Colorado River was the accepted name for almost two centuries. He reported details of Native American culture. He discovered and reported geothermal hot springs, probably the ones near Calexico.

<text>Adolph Coors III (January 12, 1915 – February 9, 1960) was the grandson of Adolph Coors and heir to the Coors Brewing Company empire.

==Life and career==

Coors was born on January 12, 1915, the son of Alice May (née Kistler; 1885–1970) and Adolph Coors Jr. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire. Like his father and his youngest brother Joseph Coors, Adolph graduated from Cornell University, where he was president of the Quill and Dagger society and a member of the Kappa Alpha Society. Coors was also a semiprofessional baseball player. At the time of his death, he was CEO and chairman of the board of the Coors Brewing Company in Golden, Colorado. Coors married Mary Urquhart Grant in November 1940. The couple had four children together.

== Kidnapping ==
On February 9, 1960, while on his way to work, Coors was murdered in a failed kidnapping attempt by escaped murderer Joseph Corbett Jr. on Turkey Creek Bridge near Morrison, Colorado.

On the morning of February 9, a milkman discovered Coors&#x27; International Travelall on the bridge, empty of occupants and with the radio on. Police identified the vehicle as belonging to Coors, and began a search of the area that turned up Coors&#x27; hat, glasses, and a blood stain. The following day, his wife Mary received a ransom note in the mail requesting $500,000 for his safe release. The hunt for Coors and his assailant was the largest FBI effort since the Lindbergh baby kidnapping.

On September 11, 1960, a hiker by the name of Edward Lee Greene Jr. stumbled upon a pair of discarded trousers in the Rocky Mountains, and found in the pocket a penknife bearing the initials &#x27;ACIII&#x27;. Then on September 15, 1960, a shirt belonging to Coors, and his skull, were found in a remote area near Pikes Peak.

A witness turned up that revealed he had seen a yellow 1951 Mercury with the letters &quot;AT&quot; and numerals &quot;62&quot; somewhere in the license plate combination on the bridge around the time of Coors&#x27; disappearance. A car matching the description was found torched in a dump in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Investigators traced the car back to a Colorado resident named Walter Osborne, who suspiciously moved out of his Denver apartment the day after the kidnapping. The name &quot;Walter Osborne&quot; was revealed to be an alias for Corbett. Due to international obsession with the case, including a picture of Corbett in an issue of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, he was recognized by two neighbors in Vancouver, BC, and was arrested.
As no witnesses were found, prosecutors built their case against Corbett through circumstantial and forensic evidence. Corbett&#x27;s coworkers overheard him talking about a plan that would earn him over $1 million and the ransom note typeface was traced back to Corbett&#x27;s typewriter. The biggest piece of evidence, however, was the soil found in the undercarriage of the yellow Mercury. Investigators were able to trace the car&#x27;s path by noting the rare pink feldspar and granite minerals found in the area Coors&#x27; body was discovered. Corbett was convicted of first-degree murder on March 29, 1961, and sentenced to life in state prison. He was released on parole in 1980 for good behavior and drove a truck for the Salvation Army until he retired. He died by suicide at the age of 80 in August 2009. He lived and died just 10 miles from where he killed Coors and always maintained his innocence.

The kidnapping was featured in the &quot;Forensic Files&quot; episode &quot;Bitter Brew&quot;. The 2017 true crime book &quot;The Death of an Heir: Adolph Coors III and the Murder That Rocked an American Brewing Dynasty&quot; by Phillip Jett details the kidnapping.

==Legacy==
An avid skier, Coors was inducted into the Colorado Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame in 1998.

<text>Accompaniment is the musical part which provides the rhythmic and/or harmonic support for the melody or main themes of a song or instrumental piece. There are many different styles and types of accompaniment in different genres and styles of music. In homophonic music, the main accompaniment approach used in popular music, a clear vocal melody is supported by subordinate chords. In popular music and traditional music, the accompaniment parts typically provide the &quot;beat&quot; for the music and outline the chord progression of the song or instrumental piece. 

The accompaniment for a vocal melody or instrumental solo can be played by a single musician playing an instrument such as piano, pipe organ, or guitar. While any instrument can in theory be used as an accompaniment instrument, keyboard and guitar-family instruments tend to be used if there is only a single instrument, as these instruments can play chords and basslines simultaneously (chords and a bassline are easier to play simultaneously on keyboard instruments, but a fingerpicking guitarist can play chords and a bassline simultaneously on guitar). A solo singer can accompany themself by playing guitar or piano while they sing, and in some rare cases, a solo singer can even accompany themself just using their voice and body (e.g., Bobby McFerrin).

Alternatively, the accompaniment to a vocal melody or instrumental solo can be provided by a musical ensemble, ranging in size from a duo (e.g., cello and piano; guitar and double bass; synthesizer and percussion); a trio (e.g., a rock power trio of electric guitar, electric bass and drum kit; an organ trio); a quartet (e.g., a string quartet in Classical music can accompany a solo singer; a rock band or rhythm section in rock and pop; a jazz quartet in jazz); all the way to larger ensembles, such as concert bands, Big Bands (in jazz), pit orchestras in musical theatre; and orchestras, which, in addition to playing symphonies, can also provide accompaniment to a concerto solo instrumentalist or to solo singers in opera. With choral music, the accompaniment to a vocal solo can be provided by other singers in the choir, who sing harmony parts or countermelodies. 

Accompaniment parts range from so simple that a beginner can play them (e.g., simple three-note triad chords in a traditional folk song) to so complex that only an advanced player or singer can perform them (e.g., the piano parts in Schubert&#x27;s Lieder art songs from the 19th century or vocal parts from a Renaissance music motet).

==Definition==

An accompanist is a musician who plays an accompaniment part. Accompanists often play keyboard instruments (e.g., piano, pipe organ, synthesizer) or, in folk music and traditional styles, a guitar. While sight-reading (the ability to play a notated piece of music without preparing it) is important for many types of musicians, it is essential for professional accompanists. In auditions for musical theater and orchestras, an accompanist will often have to sight read music.

A number of classical pianists have found success as accompanists rather than soloists; arguably the best known example is Gerald Moore, well known as a Lieder accompanist. In some American schools, the term collaborative piano is used, and hence, the title &quot;collaborative pianist&quot; (or collaborative artist) is replacing the title accompanist, because in many art songs and contemporary classical music songs, the piano part is complex and demands an advanced level of musicianship and technique. The term &quot;accompanist&quot; also refers to a musician (typically a pianist) who plays for singers, dancers, and other performers at an audition or rehearsal—but who does not necessarily participate in the ensemble that plays for the final performance (which might be an orchestra or a big band).

===Accompaniment figure===
An accompaniment figure is a musical gesture used repeatedly in an accompaniment, such as:
* Alberti bass and other arpeggio figures
* Ostinati figures (repeated lines) or, in popular music, riffs

Notated accompaniment may be indicated obbligato (obliged) or ad libitum (at one&#x27;s pleasure).

===Dialogue accompaniment===
Dialogue accompaniment is a form of call and response in which the lead and accompaniment alternate, the accompaniment playing during the rests of the lead and providing a drone or silence during the main melody or vocal.

==Notation and improvisation==
The accompaniment instrumentalists and/or singers can be provided with a fully notated accompaniment part written or printed on sheet music. This is the norm in Classical music and in most large ensemble writing (e.g., orchestra, pit orchestra, choir). In popular music and traditional music, the accompaniment instrumentalists often improvise their accompaniment, either based on a lead sheet or chord chart which indicates the chords used in the song or piece (e.g., C Major, d minor, G7, or Nashville Numbers or Roman numerals, such as I, ii, V7, etc.) or by &quot;playing by ear&quot;. To achieve a stylistic correct sound the accompaniment pattern should remind or imitate the original version using similar rhythms and patterns. 

Chord-playing musicians (e.g., those playing guitar, piano, Hammond organ, etc.) can improvise chords, &quot;fill-in&quot; melodic lines and solos from the chord chart. It is rare for chords to be fully written out in music notation in pop and traditional music. Some guitarists, bassists and other stringed instrumentalists read accompaniment parts using tabulature (or &quot;tab&quot;), a notation system which shows the musician where on the instrument to play the notes. Drummers can play accompaniment by following the lead sheet, a sheet music part in music notation, or by playing by ear. 

In pop and traditional music, bass players, which may be upright bass or electric bass, or another instrument, such as bass synth, depending on the style of music, are usually expected to be able to improvise a bassline from a chord chart or learn the song from a recording. In some cases, an arranger or composer may give a bassist a bass part that is fully written out in music notation. In. some arranged music parts, there is a mix of written-out accompaniment and improvisation. For example, in a big band bass part, the introduction and melody (&quot;head&quot;) to a tune may have a fully notated bassline, but then for the improvised solos, the arranger may just write out chord symbols (e.g., Bb G7/c min F7), with the expectation that the bassist improvise her own walking bass part.

<text>Afghanistan is divided into 34 provinces ( &quot;wilāyat&quot;). The provinces of Afghanistan are the primary administrative divisions. Each province encompasses a number of districts or usually over 1,000 villages.

Provincial governors played a critical role in the reconstruction of the Afghan state following the creation of the new government under Hamid Karzai. According to international security scholar Dipali Mukhopadhyay, many of the provincial governors of the western-backed government were former warlords who were incorporated into the political system.

<doc id="412344" wikidata="Q3857162" url="?curid=412344" title="Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist(s) Performance (with orchestra)">
<text>The [[Grammy Award]] for Best Instrumental Soloist(s) Performance (with orchestra) was awarded from 1959 to 2011. From 1967 to 1971, and in 1987, the award was combined with the award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra) and awarded as the Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (with or without orchestra). 

The award has had several minor name changes:
* In 1959 the award was known as Best Classical Performance – Instrumentalist (with concerto scale accompaniment)
* In 1960 it was awarded as Best Classical Performance – Concerto or Instrumental Soloist (with full orchestral accompaniment)
* In 1961 it was awarded as Best Classical Performance – Concerto or Instrumental Soloist
* In 1962 it was awarded as Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist (with orchestra)
* From 1963 to 1964 it was awarded as Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (with orchestra)
* In 1965 it was awarded as Best Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (with orchestra)
* From 1966 to 1991 and in 1994 it was awarded as Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (with orchestra) (or a very similar equivalent)
* In 1992 it was awarded as Best Instrumental Soloist With Orchestra 
* In 1993 it was awarded as Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Solo With Orchestra
* From 1995 to 2011 it was awarded as Best Instrumental Soloist(s) Performance (with orchestra) 

In 2012, the award was discontinued in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. The category was merged with the Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra) category to form the new [[Best Classical Instrumental Solo]] category, similar to the award from 1967 to 1971.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.

<doc id="412348" wikidata="Q123266" url="?curid=412348" title="Districts of Albania">
<text>Districts ( or ) were first and second-level administrative divisions of Albania from 19132000. Their number, size, and status changed over time. From 1991 to 2000, the 36 districts were organized into 12 counties. Pursuant to the 1998 Constitution and Law No. 8653, the districts were abolished and replaced with the larger counties and smaller municipalities.

==History==
After its Declaration of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, Albania was divided into districts until the year 2000. During the 1920s and 1930s, there were 39 districts. These were consolidated into 26 in 1939. They were reorganized in 1959. In 1978, Ersekë District was renamed to Kolonjë. In 1991 ten more districts were added: Bulqizë (previously under Dibër), Delvinë (Sarandë), Devoll (Korçë), Has (Kukës), Kavajë (Durrës), Kuçovë (Berat), Kurbin (Krujë), Malësi e Madhe (Shkodër), Mallakastër (Fier) and Peqin (Elbasan). From 1991 to 2000, the 36 districts were organized into 12 counties. The 1998 constitutional reforms came into effect as Law No. 8653 on 31 July 2000, abolishing the districts and replacing them with 12 counties as the first-level administrative division and urban and rural municipalities as the second-level division.
