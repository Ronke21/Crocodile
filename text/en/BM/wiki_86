<text>Francisco Gómez de Sandoval y Rojas, 1st Duke of Lerma, 5th Marquess of Denia, 1st Count of Ampudia (1552/1553 – 17 May 1625), was a favourite of Philip III of Spain, the first of the &quot;validos&quot; (&#x27;most worthy&#x27;) through whom the later Habsburg monarchs ruled. His administration was marked by costly wars, including the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce with the Dutch Republic, financial mismanagement, and the controversial expulsion of the Moriscos. Eventually, he was deposed in 1618 under a palace intrigue orchestrated by his son and political rival, Cristóbal de Sandoval. Lerma retired as a cardinal and was succeeded by the Count-Duke of Olivares but faced financial penalties and died in 1625 at Valladolid.

==Biography==

Believed to have been born in 1552, Francisco de Sandoval was the son of Francisco de Rojas de Sandoval, Count of Lerma and Marquis of Denia. His mother was Isabelle de Borgia, daughter of Saint Francis Borgia, Duke of Gandía and General of the Jesuit Order.

=== Influence ===
The family of Sandoval was ancient and powerful. The future duke of Lerma was born and raised at Tordesillas. As long as Philip II lived, the nobles had little effective share in the government, with the exception of a few who were appointed viceroys or commanded armies abroad. Lerma passed his time as a courtier, and made himself a favourite with the young prince Philip, heir to the Spanish throne. The dying King Philip II foresaw that Lerma was one of those nobles who were likely to mislead the new sovereign. The old king&#x27;s fears were, it is claimed by some, fully justified after his death. Others however, claim that Lerma was a fully capable favourite, as he led Castile and the Habsburg dominions on a more modest and economically viable course of peace than both Phillip II and Olivares during the reign of Philip IV – both figures that have received far more positive recognition by historians.

According to Friar Juan Fernández de Medrano in 1601, Lerma was viewed by his contemporaries as the singular soul and guiding force of the Spanish monarchy, a leader whose virtues illuminated the kingdom like the Sun governing the heavens. He was seen as &quot;a natural and divinely appointed leader, uniquely capable of maintaining unity and harmony within the state.&quot; Admired as the &quot;universal father of the republic,&quot; Lerma was regarded as a figure who embodied the principles of religion, obedience, and justice, nurturing them as cultivated virtues. His leadership inspired loyalty and gratitude, seen as &quot;a continuation of divine favor bestowed upon the monarchy, with his qualities likened to the greatness of Augustus.&quot;

=== Valido (favourite) ===
No sooner was Philip III king than he entrusted all authority to his favourite, who amassed power unprecedented for a &quot;privado&quot; or favourite and became the &quot;king&#x27;s shadow&quot;, the filter through whom all information passed, as he was appointed Sumiller de Corps and Caballerizo mayor to the King. Philip III, preoccupied with piety and indolence, soon created him Duke of Lerma (1599), pressured the papacy to make his uncle Bernardo a Cardinal and delegated to him governorship of certain public offices and management responsibility of particular lands, authorized by the King and Queen, of the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon.

=== Tributes ===
Gifts poured in from outside the royal court. From the Medici in Florence in 1601 came an over-lifesize marble of &quot;Samson Slaying a Philistine&quot; by Giambologna, presented as a diplomatic gift. It had been made for a Medici garden, and though it had recently been in storage, it was a princely gift (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London). Lerma assembled a vast collection of paintings. Duke Mario Farnese sent over a Fra Angelico &quot;Annunciation&quot; (it was a little old-fashioned), which Lerma passed on to the Dominicans of Valladolid and is now at the Prado, Madrid.

The political treatise &quot;República Mista&quot; (1602) by Tomás Fernández de Medrano, Lord of Valdeosera, was dedicated to Lerma by Juan Fernández de Medrano y Sandoval, Medrano&#x27;s son, relative of the Duke of Lerma himself.

=== Foreign policy ===

As chief minister Lerma&#x27;s ideas of foreign policy were firmly grounded in feudal ideas about royal patrimony. He cemented Spanish rule by many marriage alliances with the Austrian Habsburgs and then with the French Bourbons. Lerma&#x27;s administration began by making peace with France, in the 1598 Treaty of Vervins in 1598, but he persisted in costly and useless hostilities with England till 1604, when Spain was forced by exhaustion to make peace. Lerma used all his influence against a recognition of the independence of the Low Countries.

Though in 1607 the monarchy declared itself bankrupt, Lerma carried out the ruinous measures for the expulsion of the Moriscos, Moors who had converted to Christianity, from 1609–14, a decision affecting over 300,000 people. A policy motivated by religious and political considerations, in which no economic consideration played a part, the expulsion secured him the admiration of the clergy and was popular with the masses of people. It also provided a short-term boost to the royal treasury from the impounded property of the Moors, but would ruin the economy of Valencia for generations. Lerma&#x27;s financial horizons remained medieval: his only resources as a finance minister were the debasing of the coinage and edicts against luxury and the making of silver plate.

Bankrupt or not, the war with the Dutch dragged on till 1609, when the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce was signed with them. There was constant anti-Spanish agitation in Portugal, which had been dynastically joined to Spain since 1580.

=== Deposition ===
In the end, Lerma was deposed by a palace intrigue carried out by his own son, Cristóbal de Sandoval, Duke of Uceda, manipulated by Olivares. It is probable that he would never have lost the confidence of Philip III, who divided his life between festivals and prayers, if not for the domestic treachery of his son, who allied himself with the King&#x27;s confessor, Luis de Aliaga Martínez, whom Lerma had introduced. After a long intrigue in which the King remained silent and passive, Lerma was at last compelled to leave the court, on 4 October 1618.

As a protection, and as a means of retaining some measure of power in case he fell from favour, he had persuaded Pope Paul V to create him cardinal, the previous March (1618). He retired to the Ducal Palace of Lerma, and then to Valladolid, where it was reported that he celebrated Mass every day &quot;with great devotion and tears&quot;. When the dying Philip III was presented with a list of prisoners and exiles to be forgiven, he granted grace to all except the cardinal-duke of Lerma. When Lerma learned the news, he started from Valladolid to Madrid but was intercepted on the road and commanded by Olivares, favorite of the heir to the throne, who professed an implacable hatred for the cardinal, to return to Valladolid. The Cardinal was in Villacastín and remained there until he learned of the death of the King. Then he went back to Valladolid to celebrate the requiem in the church of San Pablo. He was ordered by the count of Olivares to reside in Tordesillas but he did not obey and appealed to Pope Gregory XV and the College of Cardinals defended him, considering his banishment an attempt against ecclesiastical freedom and the prestige of the cardinalate.

Under the reign of Philip IV, which began in 1621, Lerma was despoiled of part of his wealth. The Cardinal was sentenced, on 3 August 1624, to return to the state over a million ducats. Lerma died in 1625 at Valladolid.

==Marriage and issue==
The Duke of Lerma married in 1576 Catalina de la Cerda y Portugal (1551–1603), daughter of Juan de la Cerda, 4th Duke of Medinaceli. They had 5 children:
* Cristóbal de Sandoval, Duke of Uceda (1577–1624), his successor.
* Diego de Sandoval (died 1632), married Luisa de Mendoza, VII Condesa de Saldaña.
* Juana de Sandoval (died 1624), married Manuel Pérez de Guzmán y Silva, 8th Duke of Medina Sidonia.
** Luisa de Guzmán (1613–1666), married John II, 8th Duke of Braganza, later crowned King John IV of Portugal.
* Catalina de Sandoval (died 1648), married Pedro Fernández de Castro, 7th count of Lemos.
* Francisca de Sandoval (died 1663), married Diego López de Zúñiga Avellaneda, 2nd Duke of Peñaranda de Duero.

==Domestic policy==
When Lerma fell from power in 1618, his status as cardinal (which he had acquired for exactly this purpose 6 months earlier) gave him immunity from prosecution by his numerous enemies, who instead turned on Lerma&#x27;s trusted and unscrupulous secretary, Rodrigo Calderón, Count of Oliva (d. 1621), who as Lerma&#x27;s agent was made a scapegoat. Calderón was tortured and executed on trumped up charges of witchcraft and other crimes, which demonstrated what would likely have been Lerma&#x27;s fate, if a cardinal&#x27;s hat hadn&#x27;t protected his head.

Lerma was also responsible for the appointment of Don Pedro Franqueza to reform royal finances, but who instead managed to embezzle enough funds to purchase the title of Count of Villalonga. He was placed on trial and forfeited his riches.

At a time when the state was practically bankrupt, he encouraged the King in extravagance, and accumulated for himself a fortune estimated by contemporaries at forty-four million ducats.

On the hilltop overlooking the village of Lerma in Old Castile that provided his grand title, the duke built a palace (1606–1617, by Francisco de Mora) capped with corner towers, on the site of a fortification, ranged round a double-arcaded courtyard facing an arcaded square and linked to the rebuilt church of San Pedro with a private passageway. Lerma was pious, spending lavishly on religious houses.

==In fiction==
* Lerma is mentioned in the early 18th-century picaresque novel &quot;Gil Blas&quot; (Chapter IV) by Alain-Rene Lesage.
* A young Mikhail Lermontov associated his surname with Lerma&#x27;s title, which is an obvious fiction; even the family legend traced back the name to Thomas Learmonth the Rhymer from Scotland, but not to Lerma. The poet painted an imaginary portrait of the &quot;Duke of Lerma&quot; and created some other works featuring Spaniards.
* Anachronistically, a &quot;Duke of Lerma&quot; features as one of the minor characters in the 1867 opera &quot;Don Carlos&quot; by Giuseppe Verdi.
* A fictionalized, more treasonous version of Lerma, renamed the &quot;Duke of Lorca,&quot; is the villain of the 1948 film &quot;Adventures of Don Juan&quot; played by Errol Flynn.

<text>Ostrów Island () is a river island, located in the delta of the Vistula river, within the city limits of Gdańsk in northern Poland. Administratively, it is located within the district of Młyniska.

The northern border of the island is formed by the waters of Port Channel (Gdańsk), while the southern border is a rather moribund branch of the Vistula called Martwa Wisła, literally meaning dead Vistula.

Ostrow Island belongs to Gdańska Stocznia Remontowa, a prosperous industrial enterprise, and Stocznia Gdańsk, a group of Stocznia Gdynia.

During World War II, Nazi Germany operated a subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp on the island from October 1944 to March 1945, in which they subjected around 100 Jewish women to forced labour.

<text>Cardiac muscle (also called heart muscle or myocardium) is one of three types of vertebrate muscle tissues, the others being skeletal muscle and smooth muscle. It is an involuntary, striated muscle that constitutes the main tissue of the wall of the heart. The cardiac muscle (myocardium) forms a thick middle layer between the outer layer of the heart wall (the pericardium) and the inner layer (the endocardium), with blood supplied via the coronary circulation. It is composed of individual cardiac muscle cells joined by intercalated discs, and encased by collagen fibers and other substances that form the extracellular matrix.
Cardiac muscle contracts in a similar manner to skeletal muscle, although with some important differences. Electrical stimulation in the form of a cardiac action potential triggers the release of calcium from the cell&#x27;s internal calcium store, the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The rise in calcium causes the cell&#x27;s myofilaments to slide past each other in a process called excitation-contraction coupling.

Diseases of the heart muscle known as cardiomyopathies are of major importance. These include ischemic conditions caused by a restricted blood supply to the muscle such as angina, and myocardial infarction.

== Structure ==
=== Gross anatomy ===


Cardiac muscle tissue or myocardium forms the bulk of the heart. The heart wall is a three-layered structure with a thick layer of myocardium sandwiched between the inner endocardium and the outer epicardium (also known as the visceral pericardium). The inner endocardium lines the cardiac chambers, covers the cardiac valves, and joins with the endothelium that lines the blood vessels that connect to the heart. On the outer aspect of the myocardium is the epicardium which forms part of the pericardial sac that surrounds, protects, and lubricates the heart.

Within the myocardium, there are several sheets of cardiac muscle cells or cardiomyocytes. The sheets of muscle that wrap around the left ventricle closest to the endocardium are oriented perpendicularly to those closest to the epicardium. When these sheets contract in a coordinated manner they allow the ventricle to squeeze in several directions simultaneously – longitudinally (becoming shorter from apex to base), radially (becoming narrower from side to side), and with a twisting motion (similar to wringing out a damp cloth) to squeeze the maximum possible amount of blood out of the heart with each heartbeat.

Contracting heart muscle uses a lot of energy, and therefore requires a constant flow of blood to provide oxygen and nutrients. Blood is brought to the myocardium by the coronary arteries. These originate from the aortic root and lie on the outer or epicardial surface of the heart. Blood is then drained away by the coronary veins into the right atrium.

=== Microanatomy ===
Cardiac muscle cells (also called cardiomyocytes) are the contractile myocytes of the cardiac muscle. The cells are surrounded by an extracellular matrix produced by supporting fibroblast cells. Specialised modified cardiomyocytes known as pacemaker cells, set the rhythm of the heart contractions. The pacemaker cells are only weakly contractile without sarcomeres, and are connected to neighboring contractile cells via gap junctions. They are located in the sinoatrial node (the primary pacemaker) positioned on the wall of the right atrium, near the entrance of the superior vena cava. Other pacemaker cells are found in the atrioventricular node (secondary pacemaker).

Pacemaker cells carry the impulses that are responsible for the beating of the heart. They are distributed throughout the heart and are responsible for several functions. First, they are responsible for being able to spontaneously generate and send out electrical impulses. They also must be able to receive and respond to electrical impulses from the brain. Lastly, they must be able to transfer electrical impulses from cell to cell. Pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, and atrioventricular node are smaller and conduct at a relatively slow rate between the cells. Specialized conductive cells in the bundle of His, and the Purkinje fibers are larger in diameter and conduct signals at a fast rate.

The Purkinje fibers rapidly conduct electrical signals; coronary arteries to bring nutrients to the muscle cells, and veins and a capillary network to take away waste products.

Cardiac muscle cells are the contracting cells that allow the heart to pump. Each cardiomyocyte needs to contract in coordination with its neighboring cells - known as a functional syncytium - working to efficiently pump blood from the heart, and if this coordination breaks down then – despite individual cells contracting – the heart may not pump at all, such as may occur during abnormal heart rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation.

Viewed through a microscope, cardiac muscle cells are roughly rectangular, measuring 100–150μm by 30–40μm. Individual cardiac muscle cells are joined at their ends by intercalated discs to form long fibers. Each cell contains myofibrils, specialized protein contractile fibers of actin and myosin that slide past each other. These are organized into sarcomeres, the fundamental contractile units of muscle cells. The regular organization of myofibrils into sarcomeres gives cardiac muscle cells a striped or striated appearance when looked at through a microscope, similar to skeletal muscle. These striations are caused by lighter I bands composed mainly of actin, and darker A bands composed mainly of myosin. 

Cardiomyocytes contain T-tubules, pouches of cell membrane that run from the cell surface to the cell&#x27;s interior which help to improve the efficiency of contraction. The majority of these cells contain only one nucleus (some may have two central nuclei), unlike skeletal muscle cells which contain many nuclei. Cardiac muscle cells contain many mitochondria which provide the energy needed for the cell in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), making them highly resistant to fatigue.

==== T-tubules ====

T-tubules are microscopic tubes that run from the cell surface to deep within the cell. They are continuous with the cell membrane, are composed of the same phospholipid bilayer, and are open at the cell surface to the extracellular fluid that surrounds the cell. T-tubules in cardiac muscle are bigger and wider than those in skeletal muscle, but fewer in number. In the centre of the cell they join, running into and along the cell as a transverse-axial network. Inside the cell they lie close to the cell&#x27;s internal calcium store, the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Here, a single tubule pairs with part of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, called a terminal cisterna, in a combination known as a diad.

The functions of T-tubules include rapidly transmitting electrical impulses known as action potentials from the cell surface to the cell&#x27;s core, and helping to regulate the concentration of calcium within the cell in a process known as excitation-contraction coupling. They are also involved in mechano-electric feedback, as evident from cell contraction induced T-tubular content exchange (advection-assisted diffusion), which was confirmed by confocal and 3D electron tomography observations.

==== Intercalated discs ====

The cardiac syncytium is a network of cardiomyocytes connected by intercalated discs that enable the rapid transmission of electrical impulses through the network, enabling the syncytium to act in a coordinated contraction of the myocardium. There is an atrial syncytium and a ventricular syncytium that are connected by cardiac connection fibres. Electrical resistance through intercalated discs is very low, thus allowing free diffusion of ions. The ease of ion movement along cardiac muscle fibers axes is such that action potentials are able to travel from one cardiac muscle cell to the next, facing only slight resistance. Each syncytium obeys the all or none law.

Intercalated discs are complex adhering structures that connect the single cardiomyocytes to an electrochemical syncytium (in contrast to the skeletal muscle, which becomes a multicellular syncytium during embryonic development). The discs are responsible mainly for force transmission during muscle contraction. Intercalated discs consist of three different types of cell-cell junctions: the actin filament anchoring fascia adherens junctions, the intermediate filament anchoring desmosomes, and gap junctions. They allow action potentials to spread between cardiac cells by permitting the passage of ions between cells, producing depolarization of the heart muscle. The three types of junction act together as a single area composita.

Under light microscopy, intercalated discs appear as thin, typically dark-staining lines dividing adjacent cardiac muscle cells. The intercalated discs run perpendicular to the direction of muscle fibers. Under electron microscopy, an intercalated disc&#x27;s path appears more complex. At low magnification, this may appear as a convoluted electron dense structure overlying the location of the obscured Z-line. At high magnification, the intercalated disc&#x27;s path appears even more convoluted, with both longitudinal and transverse areas appearing in longitudinal section.

==== Fibroblasts ====

Cardiac fibroblasts are vital supporting cells within cardiac muscle. They are unable to provide forceful contractions like cardiomyocytes, but instead are largely responsible for creating and maintaining the extracellular matrix which surrounds the cardiomyocytes. Fibroblasts play a crucial role in responding to injury, such as a myocardial infarction. Following injury, fibroblasts can become activated and turn into myofibroblasts – cells which exhibit behaviour somewhere between a fibroblast (generating extracellular matrix) and a smooth muscle cell (ability to contract). In this capacity, fibroblasts can repair an injury by creating collagen while gently contracting to pull the edges of the injured area together.

Fibroblasts are smaller but more numerous than cardiomyocytes, and several fibroblasts can be attached to a cardiomyocyte at once. When attached to a cardiomyocyte they can influence the electrical currents passing across the muscle cell&#x27;s surface membrane, and in the context are referred to as being electrically coupled, as originally shown in vitro in the 1960s, and ultimately confirmed in native cardiac tissue with the help of optogenetic techniques. Other potential roles for fibroblasts include electrical insulation of the cardiac conduction system, and the ability to transform into other cell types including cardiomyocytes and adipocytes.

==== Extracellular matrix ====
The extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounds the cardiomyocyte and fibroblasts. The ECM is composed of proteins including collagen and elastin along with polysaccharides (sugar chains) known as glycosaminoglycans. Together, these substances give support and strength to the muscle cells, create elasticity in cardiac muscle, and keep the muscle cells hydrated by binding water molecules.

The matrix in immediate contact with the muscle cells is referred to as the basement membrane, mainly composed of type IV collagen and laminin. Cardiomyocytes are linked to the basement membrane via specialised glycoproteins called integrins.

== Development ==
Humans are born with a set number of heart muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, which increase in size as the heart grows larger during childhood development. Evidence suggests that cardiomyocytes are slowly turned over during aging, but less than 50% of the cardiomyocytes present at birth are replaced during a normal life span. The growth of individual cardiomyocytes not only occurs during normal heart development, it also occurs in response to extensive exercise (athletic heart syndrome), heart disease, or heart muscle injury such as after a myocardial infarction. A healthy adult cardiomyocyte has a cylindrical shape that is approximately 100μm long and 10–25μm in diameter. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy occurs through sarcomerogenesis, the creation of new sarcomere units in the cell. During heart volume overload, cardiomyocytes grow through eccentric hypertrophy. The cardiomyocytes extend lengthwise but have the same diameter, resulting in ventricular dilation. During heart pressure overload, cardiomyocytes grow through concentric hypertrophy. The cardiomyocytes grow larger in diameter but have the same length, resulting in heart wall thickening.

== Physiology ==
The physiology of cardiac muscle shares many similarities with that of skeletal muscle. The primary function of both muscle types is to contract, and in both cases, a contraction begins with a characteristic flow of ions across the cell membrane known as an action potential. The cardiac action potential subsequently triggers muscle contraction by increasing the concentration of calcium within the cytosol.

=== Cardiac cycle ===
The cardiac cycle is the performance of the human heart from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. It consists of two periods: one during which the heart muscle relaxes and refills with blood, called diastole, following a period of robust contraction and pumping of blood, dubbed systole. After emptying, the heart immediately relaxes and expands to receive another influx of blood returning from the lungs and other systems of the body, before again contracting to pump blood to the lungs and those systems. A normally performing heart must be fully expanded before it can efficiently pump again.

The rest phase is considered polarized. The resting potential during this phase of the beat separates the ions such as sodium, potassium, and calcium. Myocardial cells possess the property of automaticity or spontaneous depolarization. This is the direct result of a membrane which allows sodium ions to slowly enter the cell until the threshold is reached for depolarization. Calcium ions follow and extend the depolarization even further. Once calcium stops moving inward, potassium ions move out slowly to produce repolarization. The very slow repolarization of the CMC membrane is responsible for the long refractory period.

However, the mechanism by which calcium concentrations within the cytosol rise differ between skeletal and cardiac muscle. In cardiac muscle, the action potential comprises an inward flow of both sodium and calcium ions. The flow of sodium ions is rapid but very short-lived, while the flow of calcium is sustained and gives the plateau phase characteristic of cardiac muscle action potentials. The comparatively small flow of calcium through the L-type calcium channels triggers a much larger release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in a phenomenon known as calcium-induced calcium release. In contrast, in skeletal muscle, minimal calcium flows into the cell during action potential and instead the sarcoplasmic reticulum in these cells is directly coupled to the surface membrane. This difference can be illustrated by the observation that cardiac muscle fibers require calcium to be present in the solution surrounding the cell to contract, while skeletal muscle fibers will contract without extracellular calcium.

During contraction of a cardiac muscle cell, the long protein myofilaments oriented along the length of the cell slide over each other in what is known as the sliding filament theory. There are two kinds of myofilaments, thick filaments composed of the protein myosin, and thin filaments composed of the proteins actin, troponin and tropomyosin. As the thick and thin filaments slide past each other the cell becomes shorter and fatter. In a mechanism known as cross-bridge cycling, calcium ions bind to the protein troponin, which along with tropomyosin then uncover key binding sites on actin. Myosin, in the thick filament, can then bind to actin, pulling the thick filaments along the thin filaments. When the concentration of calcium within the cell falls, troponin and tropomyosin once again cover the binding sites on actin, causing the cell to relax.

=== Regeneration ===

It was commonly believed that cardiac muscle cells could not be regenerated. However, this was contradicted by a report published in 2009. Olaf Bergmann and his colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm tested samples of heart muscle from people born before 1955 who had very little cardiac muscle around their heart, many showing with disabilities from this abnormality. By using DNA samples from many hearts, the researchers estimated that a 4-year-old renews about 20% of heart muscle cells per year, and about 69% of the heart muscle cells of a 50-year-old were generated after they were born.

One way that cardiomyocyte regeneration occurs is through the division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes during the normal aging process.

In the 2000s, the discovery of adult endogenous cardiac stem cells was reported, and studies were published that claimed that various stem cell lineages, including bone marrow stem cells were able to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, and could be used to treat heart failure.
However, other teams were unable to replicate these findings, and many of the original studies were later retracted for scientific fraud.

=== Differences between atria and ventricles ===
Cardiac muscle forms both the atria and the ventricles of the heart. Although this muscle tissue is very similar between cardiac chambers, some differences exist. The myocardium found in the ventricles is thick to allow forceful contractions, while the myocardium in the atria is much thinner. The individual myocytes that make up the myocardium also differ between cardiac chambers. Ventricular cardiomyocytes are longer and wider, with a denser T-tubule network. Although the fundamental mechanisms of calcium handling are similar between ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes, the calcium transient is smaller and decays more rapidly in atrial myocytes, with a corresponding increase in calcium buffering capacity. The complement of ion channels differs between chambers, leading to longer action potential durations and effective refractory periods in the ventricles. Certain ion currents such as &quot;I&quot;K(UR) are highly specific to atrial cardiomyocytes, making them a potential target for treatments for atrial fibrillation.

== Clinical significance ==

Diseases affecting cardiac muscle, known as cardiomyopathies, are the leading cause of death in developed countries. The most common condition is coronary artery disease, in which the blood supply to the heart is reduced. The coronary arteries become narrowed by the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. If these narrowings become severe enough to partially restrict blood flow, the syndrome of angina pectoris may occur. This typically causes chest pain during exertion that is relieved by rest. If a coronary artery suddenly becomes very narrowed or completely blocked, interrupting or severely reducing blood flow through the vessel, a myocardial infarction or heart attack occurs. If the blockage is not relieved promptly by medication, percutaneous coronary intervention, or surgery, then a heart muscle region may become permanently scarred and damaged. Specific cardiomyopathies include: increased left ventricular mass (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), abnormally large (dilated cardiomyopathy), or abnormally stiff (restrictive cardiomyopathy). Some of these conditions are caused by genetic mutations and can be inherited.

Heart muscle can also become damaged despite a normal blood supply. The heart muscle may become inflamed in a condition called myocarditis, most commonly caused by a viral infection but sometimes caused by the body&#x27;s own immune system. Heart muscle can also be damaged by drugs such as alcohol, long standing high blood pressure or hypertension, or persistent abnormal heart racing.
Many of these conditions, if severe enough, can damage the heart so much that the pumping function of the heart is reduced. If the heart is no longer able to pump enough blood to meet the body&#x27;s needs, this is described as heart failure.

Significant damage to cardiac muscle cells is referred to as myocytolysis which is considered a type of cellular necrosis defined as either coagulative or colliquative.

<text>Morgan Motor Company Limited is a British motor car manufacturer owned by a British investment group Investindustrial. Morgan was founded in 1910 by Henry Frederick Stanley Morgan. Morgan is itself based in Malvern Link, an area of Malvern, and employs approximately 220 people. Morgan produce 850 cars per year, all assembled by hand. The waiting list for a car is approximately six months, but it has sometimes been as long as ten years.

Morgan cars are unusual in that wood has been used in their construction for a century, and is still used in the 21st century for framing the body shell. A visitor centre and museum have exhibits about the company&#x27;s history from Edwardian times until the present day, developments in automobile technology, and a display of automobiles. There are also guided tours of the factory.

== Company history ==
H.F.S. Morgan quit the Great Western Railway in 1904 and co-founded a motor sales and servicing garage in Malvern Link. In 1909 he designed and built a car for his own use. Previously he developed the first independent front suspension in the engineering shop of Malvern College. He began production a year later and the company prospered. Production of three-wheelers approached 1000 by World War I and quickly resumed with both racing and touring models. Morgan&#x27;s first four-wheeler came in 1935 with three-wheelers phased out in 1952. Morgan continued to run it until he died at age 77 in 1959.

In 1990, the company was subject of a critique by Sir John Harvey-Jones for his television programme &quot;Troubleshooter&quot;. Harvey-Jones recommended modernizing production and clearing the order backlog. The company rejected the advice, arguing that traditional techniques were part of the appeal of the company, and that a waiting list helped the company deal with recessions and preserved their exclusivity. Sales increased as a result of the programme and the company prospered. Sir John said he was very pleased to have been proven wrong in Morgan&#x27;s case.

Peter Morgan, son of HFS, ran the company until a few years before his death in 2003. He was replaced as chairman by Alan Garnett, a non-family director, from 2003 to 2006. After Garnett&#x27;s resignation, a four-man management team was established.

This team was made up of Charles Morgan (son of Peter), Matthew Parkin, Tim Whitworth and Steve Morris, and in 2010, after Parkin&#x27;s resignation, Charles Morgan was named managing director. In 2010, the MMC became dormant and all assets were sold to a new company called Morgan Technologies for an unpaid 15 million and which took over all the former assets of the Morgan Motor Company, Aero Racing, the Morgan M3W Company and all other companies bearing the Morgan name. This cured the negative equity that had occurred over the Charles Morgan tenure. UK Company House

In January, 2013, Morgan was removed as managing director, replaced by Morris, but continued as strategy director until October 2013 when he was removed both as an employee and member of the board of directors.

At the end of 2013, the shareholders appointed Andrew Duncan, a local solicitor and very close friend of the late Peter Morgan, as chairman. In 2016, he resigned as chairman and company director and was replaced as chairman by a new director, Dominic Riley.

In January 2016, the company was once again UK government funded by a £6 million grant by the British Government after a series of visits from UK politicians and Royals. In August 2018, the name of Morgan Technologies, was allowed to change its name back to The Morgan Motor Company while the original company, founded by HFS Morgan in 1957, had its name changed to a numbered company and accordingly registered at UK Companies House.

For most of its history, the company was owned by the Morgan family. A press release dated 5 March 2019 announced the acquisition of a majority stake in Morgan Motor Company Ltd by the Italian investment group Investindustrial. Though it was announced that as a part of Investindustrial&#x27;s investment, management and staff were rewarded with shares in the company, this appears nowhere in the information registered at Companies House. And though it was also announced that the Morgan family retained a minority shareholding and would continue to be involved in the company this does not appear on any statement filed with Companies House. The price of sale was approximately the amount of the 2016 government grant which was used, at the time, to purchase back the land and buildings on Pickersleigh Road, that had been sold in 2005/6 to fund the company.
== Early cars: three-wheelers and 4/4s ==
The early cars were two-seat or four-seat three-wheelers, and are therefore considered to be cyclecars. Three-wheeled vehicles avoided the British tax on cars by being classified as motorcycles. Competition from small cars like the Austin 7 and the original Morris Minor, with comparable economy and price and better comfort, made cyclecars less attractive.

=== V-Twin three-wheelers (1911–1939) ===

H.F.S. Morgan&#x27;s first car design was a single-seat three-wheeled runabout, which was fabricated for his personal use in 1908, with help from William Stephenson-Peach, the father of friends, and the engineering master at Malvern College. Powered by a Peugeot twin-cylinder engine (from an abandoned motorcycle project), the car had a backbone chassis, an idea retained for all following Morgan three-wheelers, and used as little material and labour as Morgan could manage. A single-seat three-wheeler with coil-spring independent front suspension, unusual at the time, the driveshaft ran through the backbone tube to a two-speed transmission (with no reverse), and chain drive to each of the rear wheels. The steering was by tiller, and it had band brakes. It also had no body.

With financial help from his father and his wife, the car went into production at premises in Pickersleigh Road, Malvern Link. Three single-seater cars were exhibited at the 1910 Motor Show at Olympia in London. In spite of great interest being shown, only a few orders were taken, and Morgan decided a two-seater was needed to meet market demand. This was built in 1911, adding a bonnet, windscreen, wheel steering, and crank starting; it was displayed at the 1911 Motor Cycle Show. An agency was taken up by the Harrods department store in London, with a selling price of £65. The Morgan became the only car ever to appear in a shop window at Harrods.

Interest in his runabout led him to patent his design and begin production. While he initially showed single-seat and two-seat versions of his runabout at the 1911 Olympia Motor Exhibition, he was convinced at the exhibition that there would be greater demand for a two-seat model. The Morgan Motor Company was registered as a private limited company only in 1912 with H.F.S. Morgan as managing director and his father, who had invested in his son&#x27;s business, as its first chairman.

In 1912, Morgan set out to win the trophy offered by &quot;The Light Car &amp; Cyclecar&quot; for greatest distance covered in an hour, at Brooklands. The single-seater covered , only to be narrowly beaten by a GWK; Morgan returned later the same year, reaching nearly .

Morgan established its reputation via competition such as winning the 1913 Cyclecar Grand Prix at Amiens in France, driven by W. G. McMinnies, with an average speed of for the distance. This became the basis for the &#x27;Grand Prix&#x27; model of 1913 to 1926, from which evolved the &#x27;Aero&#x27;, and &#x27;Sports&#x27; models. Morgan himself won the &quot;very tough&quot; ACU Six Days&#x27; Trial in 1913, in the sidecar class. The same year, the company entered the MCC reliability trial, which it continued to do until 1975.

Racing success led to demand the company proved unable to meet.

These models used air-cooled or liquid-cooled variations of motorcycle engines. The engine was placed ahead of the axis of the front wheels in a chassis made of steel tubes brazed into cast lugs.

After the First World War, the company introduced an easily changed rear wheel, which customers had been seeking for several years. The 1921 Popular, powered by an JAP and bodied in poplar, sold for £150. It was a sales success, the price dropping to £128, and the name changing to Standard, by 1923, when a Blackburne engine was also available. The Grand Prix was priced £155, and the Family (with two notional child seats behind the front bench, setting a standard 2+2s would follow for generations) was £148 with air-cooled engine, or £158 with water-cooled engine. The Anzani-powered Aero was also available, for £148. MAG engines were also optional.

Morgan&#x27;s racing efforts suffered a blow in 1924, when E. B. Ware&#x27;s JAP-engined car rolled at the JCC at Brooklands; Ware was seriously hurt, leading to a ban on three-wheelers competing as cars.

Electric headlamps were made available in 1924, at an £8 cost. The Popular, powered by a engine, sold for £110, the Aero for £148, and the one-seater £160.

Like motorcycles, Morgans had hand throttles, Bowden-wire control mechanisms, and drip lubrication.

Racing Morgans included Harold Beart&#x27;s Blackburne-engined special, with 3.33:1 top gear and a streamlined body, which covered in a one-hour trial at Brooklands, with a peak speed of over .

In 1925, the Standard&#x27;s price had dropped to £95, and the Aero £130, compared to £149 for an Austin Chummy. Electric lighting by dynamo became standard that year.

Front-wheel brakes and electric start (a £10 option) became available in 1927, while the Standard&#x27;s price fell to £89, complete with a double-thickness windscreen and &quot;electric hooter&quot;. By year&#x27;s end, the Standard was even cheaper, £85, while the new Super Sports debuted, with an overhead valve JAP 10/40 water-cooled vee-twin, priced £155. The 10/40 engine was also available in the Aero, at £132, while a more sedate air-cooled JAP-powered Aero went for £119. The Family was priced at £102 (air-cooled) or £112 (water-cooled). These new, lower prices persisted through 1928. They would be lower still in 1929: the Standard and Family at £87 10s, the Aero £110, and the Super Sports £145. In 1933, the Family was priced at only £80.

Morgan&#x27;s racing programme in 1927 earned the marque eleven gold medals and three silvers from fourteen entrants at MCC&#x27;s London-Edinburgh Trials alone. The team was joined by Clive Lones and C. T. Jay, who won the 1929 Cyclecar &quot;Grand Prix&quot; at Brooklands, driving a Morgan-JAP, with an average speed of . And in 1930, Gwenda Stewart turned in a speed of in a race-tuned Super Sports.

Morgan three-wheelers benefitted from an annual tax of just £4, half the tax on the Austin 7, provided they remained under 8 cwt.

Morgans were also licence-built in France by Darmont.

By 1930, however, inexpensive four-wheeled cars were proliferating, led by the £100 Ford Popular. Morgan, and partner George Goodall, countered by putting the and Ford engine in their own cars.

Morgan&#x27;s last vee-twins were powered by Matchless engines displacing ; they were delivered to Australia after the Second World War.

The vee-twin models were not returned to production after World War II.

The Morgan Three Wheeler Club was formed in 1945.

=== F-Series three-wheelers (1932–1952) ===

The Morgan F-4 was introduced in 1933 at the Olympia Motor Cycle Show. The F-4 had a new pressed-steel chassis the four-cylinder Ford Sidevalve engine used in the Model Y, and a four-seat body. The F-4 was supplemented by the two-seat F-2 in 1935 and the more sporting F Super, with cycle-type wings and louvred bonnet tops, in 1937. Production of the Ford-engined three-wheelers continued until 1952.

=== 4/4 ===
Morgan&#x27;s first four-wheeler, designated by the factory as the 4/4 because it had a four-cylinder engine and four wheels, was released to the public in 1936. Powered by a Coventry Climax engine, and carrying a pair of rear-mounted spare wheels, the new two-seater 4/4 sold for 185 guineas (£194 5s). It proved popular, and a four-place model was added in 1937, joined by a £236 drophead in 1938.

Coventry Climax eventually ceased making engines available, so Morgan switched to a tuned Standard Motor Company Ten, producing .

In 1938, a 4/4 was entered at Le Mans. This led to production of factory replicas, with fold-down windscreen, cycle fenders (mudguards), smaller-displacement engine, and single spare wheels, with a price of £250.
== Post-war cars ==

=== Morgan +4 ===

The Morgan +4 was introduced in 1950 as a larger-engined (&quot;plus&quot;) car than the 4/4. The +4 initially used the Standard Vanguard engine and at introduction sold for £625 (two-seater) or £723 (coupé).

The +4 used Triumph TR2 (in 1953), TR3 (1956), or TR4A engines (until 1969). Plus 4 production was suspended in 1969 but brought back in 1985 with a Fiat engine (1985–1988) and then a 4-cylinder Rover engine (1988–2000). Production was again suspended and the Plus 4 returned once more in 2004 with a Ford 4-cylinder.

From October 1965 to April 1967 Morgan produced the two-seat +4 Competition, of which only 42 were built, about 11 of which survive.

A limited edition Plus 4 was re-introduced in 2014 as the Plus 4 Super Sports. Only 60 cars were made available, all right-hand-drive.

==== Morgan +4+ ====

A version of the +4, the +4+, was made from 1964 to 1967 with a fibreglass coupé body. The light weight and reduced drag improved the performance of the +4+ over the standard +4 in every aspect. However, traditional Morgan enthusiasts did not embrace this departure from Morgan custom, and mainstream enthusiasts did not embrace the seemingly archaic +4 chassis. Fifty were planned, but only 26 were built.

=== Morgan 4/4 ===


Production of the 4/4 was halted during World War II but resumed afterwards. Production halted again in 1950 when the Standard engine ceased to be available but resumed in 1955 when a suitable replacement, the side-valve 1,172 cc Ford 100E engine was found and has continued ever since.

The 4/4 now uses the +8 chassis and a Ford engine.

=== Morgan +8 ===

Faced with the decreasing availability of large four-cylinder engines for use in their +4 models, Morgan began to install the recently available Rover V8 engine in their cars in 1968, giving these cars the model designation &quot;+8&quot;.

The engine displacement jumped from the 2.1 litres of the Triumph TR4 engine to 3.5, then 3.9 (1990), 4.0 (1998–2004), and with an optional 4.6-litre engine (1996–2000) all based on the same Land Rover block. However, this V8 was no heavier than the Triumph engine. These features made the +8 accelerate much more quickly than the early +4 and also improved its road-holding capability.

Horsepower (143–204 bhp), weight and performance varied with emission and structural laws through its history. Thus powered, the car could accelerate from 0–60 mph in 5.6 seconds. In its final form, the GEMS Land Rover V8 produced .

=== Roadster ===

In 2004, Morgan came out with a traditional styled model to replace the departing Plus 8. The Mk I Roadsters with the Ford UK Mondeo V6 produced 223 bhp (166 kW, 226 PS) at 6150 rev/min. It had a Getrag gearbox with direct drive in 5th with a 3.08 axle ratio. Later Marks had a Ford gearbox with direct drive in 4th with a 3.73 axle ratio. The overall gearing is virtually the same. The later Roadsters were powered by a Ford UK Mondeo V6 producing . In 2007, the Mondeo engine was replaced by a US-specification version of the same engine in the Roadster II. In 2011–12, the engine was replaced by the 3.7 Duratec Cyclone engine and output increased to . The company calls this latest model the Roadster 3.7.

=== Morgan Aero 8 (Series I-V) ===
In 2000, the Morgan Aero 8 was introduced and, as always, the wooden body substructure was ash. (Contrary to popular myth, however, the chassis is metal; aluminium for the Aero 8.) The Aero 8, with a BMW V8 engine in a car weighing less than a BMW Z4 and considerably less than a BMW M3, (though more than traditional Morgans) is even faster than the Plus 8, delivering what &quot;Autoweek&quot; magazine termed supercar performance. The newest Aero 8 (series V), presented in March 2015, puts out at 6100 rpm with the company suggesting a top speed of over . Due to the Aero 8&#x27;s light weight it can do 0–62 mph (100 km/h) in 4.5 seconds.

During its customer production lifetime (2002–2009), the Aero was configured in five official versions, (I, II, III, IV, the Aero America and V) with mild variations in styling, engines, transmissions, braking and suspension. The company cancelled the model in 2009 but relaunched it in 2015 for 2016 deliveries. The year of highest production for any Aero variation was 2002.

=== Morgan AeroMax ===
The Aero was followed by the Aeromax, a limited edition of 100 units produced between 2008 and early 2010. The Aeromax was a coupé variation of the Aero 8. Customers have included Richard Hammond, Rowan Atkinson and Paul O&#x27;Grady.

=== Morgan Aero SuperSports ===

The Morgan Aero SuperSports is a targa-roofed version of the AeroMax, sharing its bonded aluminium chassis and lower bodywork with the coupe. It was launched at the 2009 Pebble Beach car show in California. Its cancellation was announced in March 2015.

=== Morgan Aero Coupé ===

The Morgan Aero Coupé is a hard top version of the Aero SuperSports, sharing its bonded aluminium chassis, bodywork, suspension and engine. It was launched at the end of 2011. It is not available in the United States. Its cancellation was announced in March 2015.

=== Morgan Plus 8 ===
The new Morgan Plus 8 is a classic body version of the Aero SuperSports and Aero Coupé, sharing their bonded aluminium chassis, bodywork, suspension and engine. It was launched at the end of 2011. It is not available in the United States. In 2019, Morgan announced its cancellation.

=== Morgan Plus E ===

The Morgan Plus E is an electric version of a classical Morgan, a joint project of Morgan with Zytek and Radshape (Radshape Sheet Metal Ltd.), funded by the UK government. It was displayed at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. It has never been produced and the project was abandoned.

=== Morgan Eva GT ===

Based on the same chassis as the Aero Supersports, the Eva GT would have been a 2+2 grand tourer, and as such it would be longer in the body. The Eva GT would use BMW N54 twin-turbo straight-6 producing 302 bhp, Euro-6 emissions compliant. Shown at Pebble Beach in clay in 2010 and expected to go on sale in 2012, deposits have been taken since 2010. At the end of 2011, Morgan announced that it would use new magnesium technology for the body and therefore it would not be represented until 2014 with deliveries after that. In 2013 dealers confirmed that the EvaGT had been cancelled.

=== Morgan 3-Wheeler ===

The Morgan Motor Company announced that they would launch the &quot;3 Wheeler&quot; in 2011 at the Geneva Motor Show. The 3 Wheeler was initially said to have a Harley-Davidson &quot;Screaming Eagle&quot; V-twin engine and a Mazda 5-speed manual transmission, and was estimated to deliver at the rear wheel. However, the prototype that was shown at Geneva had an S&amp;S engine. Production three-wheelers turned out to have S&amp;S engines. The kerb weight was originally estimated to be less than , but the final weight was tested at . The acceleration from zero to was estimated by Morgan as 4.5 seconds, with an (estimated) top speed of . The three-wheeler is to be homologated as a motorcycle in the United States. The company states that 850 deposits have been taken since the announcement in 2011. Customer deliveries began in Europe in February 2012. US deliveries were not expected before June 2012, when the first imported three-wheeler was displayed in New York City and at the Greenwich Concours d&#x27;Elegance. The Morgan 3 Wheeler was featured in a Series 18 episode of UK motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot; where presenter Richard Hammond selected the Morgan 3 Wheeler in a comparison of track-day cars. The 3 Wheeler won the &quot;Not-A-Car of the Year 2011&quot; in &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine.
=== Morgan SP1 ===

In September 2014, Morgan introduced the Morgan SP1 as well as its newly formed Special Projects division. The one-off coupe uses the same Ford 3.7L V6 as in the Morgan Roadster. The exterior is inspired by Morgan&#x27;s LIFEcar concept and its egg-crate wooden frame is made of ash and African Bubinga red hardwood.

=== Morgan Plus Six ===

The Morgan Plus Six was announced in March 2019 at the Geneva Motor Show. Instead of the traditional Morgan ladder frame and sliding-pillar suspension, it has a new bonded aluminium chassis and all-independent suspension design, with double wishbones at the front and a multi-link system for the rear. The Plus Six is powered by a BMW B58 turbocharged in-line six-cylinder petrol engine, producing 335 bhp, coupled to an eight-speed ZF automatic transmission.

=== Morgan Plus Four ===

The Morgan Plus Four was revealed online in March 2020. Like the Plus Six, it uses a &quot;CX-Generation&quot; bonded aluminium chassis and all-independent suspension design. The Plus Four is powered by a BMW B48 turbocharged in-line four-cylinder petrol engine producing 255 bhp, with either a six-speed manual transmission or an eight-speed automatic transmission.

== Availability in the United States ==

For part of the 1950s and 1960s, the United States provided the company with its largest market worldwide, taking up to 85% of all production. This ended with the first wave of US safety and emission regulations in 1971. For many years (1974 to 1992), all Morgans imported into the United States were converted to run on propane as fuel to pass the US emissions regulations. However, this conversion, along with bringing the cars into compliance with US vehicle safety legislation, was carried out by the dealership, and not by the factory, making the cars grey market vehicles.

However, when the Rover Group re-certified their V8 engine for use in the Range Rover 4x4 sold in the US, Morgan was able to use the same engine for a fully US-compliant stock Morgan from 1992 to 1996, and again from 1998 to 2004. In 2005, the engine was replaced with the US-version of another traditionally shaped model (with a V6), called the Roadster.

In 2002, Morgan centralised its international compliancy development and regulatory interaction in-house. In 2005, its right to import its classic models ceased when supplies of its necessary airbag were exhausted and no replacement was developed. In 2006, a request for an airbag exemption to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was refused, and the import of classic Morgans ceased.

In 2005, the new Morgan Aero 8 model (versions 2 and 3) received a three-year exemption from rear impact non-compliance, along with a separate exemption for compliance with &quot;advanced airbag requirements&quot;. The rear-impact exemption lapsed in May 2008 without further application. Morgan has indicated to its US dealers that it plans to re-apply for US certification for some model at as yet an undetermined date in the future.

In April 2012, the new Morgan 3-Wheeler was showcased at the New York International Auto Show, at the Jacob Javits Center, by Bobby Singh and Gideon Lang-Laddie of Manhattan Motorsports. This was the first time in 10 years that Morgan had had a presence at the largest of the American car shows and was the first US specification Morgan 3-Wheeler in the United States. The Morgan 3 Wheeler was voted one of the &quot;Hottest Cars Of The Show&quot; by G4TV.

In May 2012, Manhattan Motorsports took delivery of Charles Morgan&#x27;s Superdry edition Morgan 3-Wheeler and prepared it for its first major American trial. This vehicle was driven across the States, from New York to Los Angeles by Charles Morgan and his wife, covering 3000 miles, in the Gumball 3000. At the end of the seven-day drive, the Morgan 3 Wheeler was awarded the &quot;Spirit of Gumball&quot; prize.

== General characteristics ==

In spite of their traditional design, Morgans have always had sporting or &quot;sports car&quot; performance, due to their extremely low weight.

Among their Australian enthusiasts, Morgans are affectionately known as &quot;Moggies&quot;.

=== Suspension ===
H.F.S. Morgan&#x27;s 1909 runabout used sliding pillar suspension, an independent front suspension system with each front wheel mounted on a stub axle able to slide up and down a fixed pillar that also acts as the kingpin and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tyre and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an &#x27;inverted&#x27; sliding pillar, as the pillar is fixed and the hub carrier slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, sliding through a bush on the axle.

Morgan used developments of this suspension system throughout its existence, and it is still used on Morgan&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; line, although not on the Aero 8 or its derivatives. It has been cancelled, along with all the Morgan Classic line, in 2019. However, some &quot;classics&quot;, shipped in parts to avoid the need for normal compliancy, will be shipped to the US, and assembled there for an indefinite period.

== Motorsports ==
Morgan cars can be found in many areas of motorsport, from club and historic racing to more prominent examples, including the Le Mans 24hr race. A notable Morgan racecar was the Aero 8 GT car that campaigned in 2008 Britcar races and the 2008 Britcar 24hrs at Silverstone, prepared and run by Mark Bailey Racing.

Pescarolo Sport rebranded its Le Mans Prototype as a Morgan for the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans, partly to mark the 50th anniversary of a class victory for a Morgan Plus Four Super Sports at Le Mans.

<text>The genus Sayornis is a small group of medium-sized insect-eating birds, known as phoebes, in the tyrant flycatcher family Tyrannidae.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Sayornis&quot; that was introduced by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854 with black phoebe (&quot;Sayornis nigricans&quot;) as the type species. The genus name is constructed from the specific part of Bonaparte&#x27;s name for Say&#x27;s phoebe, &quot;Muscicapa saya&quot;, and Ancient Greek &quot;ornis&quot; meaning &quot;bird&quot;. The English &quot;Phoebe&quot; is a name for the Roman moon-goddess Diana.

==Description and ecology==
They are native to North and South America.

They prefer semi-open or open areas near water. These birds wait on a perch and then catch insects, usually in pairs. Their nest is an open cup sometimes placed on man-made structures. They aren&#x27;t fond of dense forests, and prefer low perches.

They often slowly lower and raise their tails while perched.

===Species===
The genus contains three species:

<doc id="424362" wikidata="Q757829" url="?curid=424362" title="XForms">
<text>XForms is an XML format used for collecting inputs from web forms. XForms was designed to be the next generation of HTML / XHTML forms, but is generic enough that it can also be used in a standalone manner or with presentation languages other than XHTML to describe a user interface and a set of common data manipulation tasks.

XForms 1.0 (Third Edition) was published on 29 October 2007. The original XForms specification became an official W3C Recommendation on 14 October 2003, while XForms 1.1, which introduced a number of improvements, reached the same status on 20 October 2009.

==Differences from web forms==
In contrast to the original web forms (originally defined in HTML), the creators of XForms used a model–view–controller (MVC) approach. The model consists of one or more XForms models describing form data, constraints upon that data, and submissions. The view describes what controls appear in the form, how they are grouped together, and what data they are bound to. CSS can be used to describe a form&#x27;s appearance.

An XForms document can be as simple as a web form (by only specifying the submission element in the model section, and placing the controls in the body), but XForms includes many advanced features. For example, new data can be requested and used to update the form while it is running, much like using XMLHttpRequest/AJAX except without scripting. The form author can validate user data against XML Schema data types, require certain data, disable input controls or change sections of the form depending on circumstances, enforce particular relationships between data, input variable length arrays of data, output calculated values derived from form data, prefill entries using an XML document, respond to actions in real time (versus at submission time), and modify the style of each control depending on the device they are displayed on (desktop browser versus mobile versus text only, etc.). There is often no need for any scripting with languages such as JavaScript. However, XForms does include an event model and actions for implementing more complex form behaviors. Actions and event handling are specified using the XForms XML dialect rather than more common scripting languages like JavaScript.

Like web forms, XForms can use various non-XML submission protocols (multipart/form-data, application/x-www-form-urlencoded), but a new feature is that XForms can send data to a server in XML format. XML documents can also be used to prefill data in the form. Because XML is a standard, many tools exist that can parse and modify data upon submission. Similar tools for legacy forms also exist. XForms is itself an XML dialect, and therefore can create and be created from other XML documents using XSLT. Using transformations, XForms can be automatically created from XML schemas, and XForms can be converted to XHTML forms.

==Software support==
At the time of this writing, no widely used web browser supports XForms natively. However, various browser plugins, client-side extensions and server/client solutions exist. The following lists some implementations:
* The Firefox XForms extension was part of the Mozilla Project. XForms 1.0 SE support is not complete but covers most of the specification with a notable exception of attribute-based repeating used in HTML tables. The extension was available for both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3, but is not upgraded to support Firefox 4 and higher. In July 2011 the lead developer wrote that XForms support would no longer get updated. Support for XForms was eventually deprecated in Firefox 19.
* IBM Lotus Forms supports development and deployment of XForms-based pure XML forms. Trial downloads are available of an Eclipse-based visual design environment and a client-side viewer that can run XForms-based forms both in the web browser and as a standalone desktop application.
* OpenOffice.org versions 2.0 and greater and LibreOffice support XForms.

==Implementation technologies compared==
FormFaces, AJAXForms, XSLTForms, betterFORM, Chiba, Orbeon and Smartsite Forms are based on Ajax technology. The amount of server-side and client-side processing varies between these implementations. For example, Ubiquity XForms, FormFaces and XSLTForms provide 100% XForms client-side processing and data model updates via pure Ajax processing on the XForms standard. The others use server-side Java/.NET XForms processing transcoding to Ajax markup prior to delivering the content to the browser. Both techniques can work across browsers. Each implementation is significantly different with respect to dependencies, scalability, performance, licensing, maturity, network traffic, offline capability, and cross browser compatibility. System architects should evaluate these constraints against their needs to determine potential risks and objectives.

Plugins like FormsPlayer and other client-side technology can have some benefits as well: because they integrate themselves into the browser, they will work with existing server architectures, can be more responsive, and require fewer server fetches.

The tradeoff between server-side and client plug-in solutions is where the software is maintained; either each client must install the required plug-in, or the server architecture must change to accommodate the XForms transcoder engine language technology. It is in theory possible to mix both of these solutions, for instance testing the browser for a client-side XForms implementation and serving native XForms in that case, and defaulting to a server solution in other cases.

Ubiquity XForms, FormFaces and XSLTForms provide a &quot;zero software&quot; solution on either the client or server: no new software needs to be installed on the client and the solution can be used in conjunction with any server-side architecture. This is possible because FormFaces and Ubiquity XForms are written 100% in Ajax and because XSLTForms is written in XSLT and in Ajax. The tradeoff is that compared to other solutions, more code is initially downloaded to the client (code can be cached on the client), and FormFaces does not yet support XML Schema validation. Furthermore, XForms submissions with replace &quot;all&quot; behaviour will typically not result in true page replacements and therefore break the normal back button behaviour.

==XRX application architecture==
Because XForms makes it easy to edit complex XML data there are many advantages to using XForms with native XML databases that frequently leverage REST interfaces. The combination of three technologies (XForms on the client, REST interfaces and XQuery on the server) is collectively known as XRX application development. XRX is known for its simple architecture that uses XML both on the client and in the database and avoids the transformations to object or relational data structures. See &quot;XRX:Simple, Elegant, Disruptive&quot;.

==XForms for mobile devices==
===Benefits===
XForms provides specific benefits when used on mobile devices:
* User interfaces using XForms require fewer round trips with the server and are in that sense more self-contained than user interfaces using HTML 4 forms.
* Capabilities of mobile devices vary greatly; consequently the amount of the work involved in generating different user interfaces for different devices is of particular concern in the mobile world. XForms has been designed from the ground up to allow forms to be described independently of the device, which reduces the amount of work required to target multiple devices.
* XForms reduces the need for JavaScript, which is particularly interesting as JavaScript support varies greatly on mobile devices and cannot be widely relied upon. This also allows systems on which JavaScript is disabled for security concerns to continue to operate flawlessly.

===Implementations===

====ODK ====
ODK is an open-source mobile data collection platform that uses a subset of W3C XForms 1.0 called ODK XForms. ODK provides ODK XForms processing libraries in Java (JavaRosa) and JavaScript (enketo-core).

====Xfolite====
Xfolite is a light-weight XForms client for the J2ME platform. It was originally created at Nokia Research Center, and it includes a DOM and XPath 1.0 implementation as well as an XForms engine that implements the XForms 1.1 specification almost completely. XFolite was released as beta software and should not be considered ready for production use as such. However, it does contain a mature XForms engine that has been designed to work with different UI implementations. XML Schemas and CSS are outside project scope, however. Xfolite is open source and licensed under the LGPL license, but is not being actively developed further.

<text>Dingane ka Senzangakhona Zulu (–29 January 1840), commonly referred to as Dingane or Dingaan, was a Zulu prince who became king of the Zulu Kingdom in 1828, after assassinating his half-brother Shaka Zulu. He set up his royal capital, uMgungundlovu, and one of numerous military encampments, or kraals, in the eMakhosini Valley just south of the White Umfolozi River, on the slope of Lion Hill (&quot;Singonyama&quot;).

==Rise to power==
Dingane came to power in 1828 after assassinating his half-brother Shaka with the help of another brother, Umhlangana, as well as Mbopa, Shaka&#x27;s bodyguard. They were traditionally said to have killed Shaka because of his increasingly brutal behaviour after the death of his mother, Nandi. The assassination took place at present-day KwaDukuza.

==Governance and reverence==

Captain Allen Gardiner related that Dingane was revered as the &quot;great idol&quot; of the Zulu nation, while a missionary, Rev. Francis Owen, who observed his rule at close quarters while stationed at Umgungundlovu, highlighted several aspects of his despotic governance. 

Dingane&#x27;s subjects applied god-like attributes to him, not admitting for instance that his reign might have had a beginning. He was deemed immortal, one who was neither born, nor would ever die. When asked when his reign started, his subjects replied &quot;hundreds and hundreds of years ago.&quot; At their morning and evening meals, after receiving the distributed meat, they rose and exclaimed with raised hands: &quot;Thou that art greater than the heavens.&quot;

The habit of Dingane&#x27;s ministers, concubines and servants was not to think, act or speak, except at Dingane&#x27;s suggestion or command. Owen observed that even Dingane&#x27;s prime minister, Ndlela kaSompisi, refused to pay him a visit, when such a visit was not expressly ordered by the king. Nor would anyone grind Owen even a small amount of corn or sit down with him for prayer unless ordered to do so.

Dingane kept his 500 or so concubines in severe bondage. He referred to them as his sisters or children, and placed them in various ranks. They could leave the royal enclosure only with his permission, and when doing so were not allowed to cast an eye on any man or boy. Owen observed them a few times outside the palace, once when brought out to sing, and also when they were instructed to bring him thatch for his hut. Some would run away when the opportunity availed, only to be apprehended and executed.

Though Dingane allowed Owen to reside just outside his capital, he considered the Christian faith a fiction of the English, which was of no use to him or his subjects. On a particular Sunday, he did allow Owen to expound the main precepts of Christianity before an assembly of almost 1,000 Zulu men. These were assembled at the center of the Umgungundhlovu enclosure, supplied with beer and seated in a semi-circle, a few rows deep. Dingane reacted with some irritation to the message, proclaiming that it was old news to them, and incompatible with their views: &quot;I and my people believe there is only one God – I am that God. ... I am the Great Chief – the God of the living; Umatiwane [whom I killed] is the Great Chief of the wicked.&quot;

==Royal enclosure (&quot;isigodlo&quot;) at UmGungundlovu==

Dingane built his capital city of umGungundlovu in 1829 and enlarged it five years later. UmGungundlovu was built according to the characteristic layout of a Zulu military settlement (singular: &quot;ikhanda&quot;, plural: &quot;amakhanda&quot;). The &quot;ikhanda&quot; consisted of a large, central circular parade ground (&quot;isibaya esikhulu&quot;), surrounded by warriors&#x27; barracks (&quot;uhlangoti&quot;) and storage huts for their shields. The &quot;isibaya&quot; was entered from the north.

The royal enclosure (&quot;isigodlo&quot;) was on the southern side of the complex, directly opposite the main entrance. The king, his mistresses and female attendants (Dingane never married officially), a total of at least 500 people, resided here. The women were divided into two groups: the black &quot;isigodlo&quot; and the white &quot;isigodlo&quot;. The black &quot;isigodlo&quot; comprised about 100 privileged women, and within that group was another elite, the &quot;bheje&quot;, a smaller number of girls favoured by the king as his mistresses. A small settlement was built for them behind the main complex, where they could enjoy some privacy. The remainder of the king&#x27;s women were the white &quot;isigodlo&quot;. They were mainly girls presented to the king by his important subjects. He also selected other girls at the annual first fruit ceremony (&quot;umkhosi wokweshwama&quot;).

A huge half-moon shaped area was included in the black &quot;isigodlo&quot;; here the women and the king sang and danced. The huts in the black &quot;isigodlo&quot; were divided into compartments of about three huts each, enclosed by a two-metre-high hedge of intertwined withes, which created a network of passages.

The king&#x27;s private hut (&quot;ilawu&quot;) was located in one such triangular compartment and had three or four entrances. His hut was very large and was kept very neat by attendants; it could easily accommodate 50 people. Modern archaeological excavations have revealed that the floor of this large hut was approximately 10 metres in diameter. Archaeologists found evidence inside the hut of 22 large supporting posts completely covered in glass beads. These had been noted in historical accounts by Piet Retief, leader of the Voortrekkers, and the British missionaries George Champion and Francis Owen.

On the south side, just behind the main complex, were three separate enclosed groups of huts. The centre group was used by the &quot;uBheje&quot; women of the black &quot;isigodlo&quot;. In this area, they initiated chosen young girls into the service of the king.

==Rebellion==
Dingane lacked Shaka&#x27;s military and leadership skills; rebel chiefs broke away from his rule. Chiefs who fell out of favour with Dingane fled the country, including Signabani. 

The subjects of Signabani who were unable to flee with him were rounded up in their refuges and massacred. The dissension was exacerbated by armed conflict with the newly arrived Voortrekkers.

==Conflict with Voortrekkers==
In November 1837 Dingane met with Piet Retief, leader of the Voortrekkers. In return for their recovering some stolen cattle, Dingane signed a deed of cession of lands (written in English) to the Voortrekkers. It is generally believed that Dingane knew what he was signing although he could not have had any formal education, have read the contents of the document or have understood the concept of permanent land ownership since it was not a custom of the Zulus to assign land to individuals permanently. On 6 February 1838, after two days of feasting, the chief had Retief and his diplomatic party killed. 

They had been told to leave their firearms outside the royal kraal. Suddenly, when the dancing had reached a frenzied climax, Dingane leapt to his feet and shouted &quot;Bulalani abathakathi!&quot;

The men were overpowered and dragged away to the hill kwaMatiwane, named after a chief who had been killed there. Retief and his men were killed. It is alleged by some that they were killed because they withheld some of the cattle recovered from Chief Sekonyela. The general opinion is that Dingane did not wish to yield the land ceded to them in the treaty and mistrusted the presence of the Voortrekkers.

At the same time, Dingane&#x27;s forces killed Retief&#x27;s undefended trek party, about 500 Boers and native servants, including women and children. The Boers called it the Weenen massacre. The nearby present-day town of Weenen (Dutch for &quot;weeping&quot;) was named by early settlers in memory of the massacre.

Dingane ordered his army to seek and kill the group of Voortrekkers under Andries Pretorius. The Zulu impis attacked the Voortrekker encampment, but they were defeated in the ensuing Battle of Blood River. An estimated 3,000 Zulus were killed. Dingane&#x27;s commander at the battle was Ndlela kaSompisi.

==Overthrow and death==
In January 1840, Pretorius and a force of 400 Boers helped Mpande in his revolt against his half-brother Dingane, which resulted in the latter&#x27;s overthrow and death. Mpande succeeded Dingane. At the Battle of Maqongqo, many of Dingane&#x27;s own men deserted to Mpande&#x27;s army. Dingane had his general, Ndlela kaSompisi, executed, and with a few followers, he sought refuge in Nayawo territory on the Lubombo mountains. A group of Nyawo and Swazi assassinated him in Hlatikhulu Forest.

Dingane&#x27;s grave is near Ingwavuma in the Hlatikulu Forest, an hour&#x27;s drive from Tembe elephant park.

<text>Martin Lee Chu-ming (; born 8 June 1938) is a Hong Kong politician and barrister. He is the founding chairman of the United Democrats of Hong Kong and its successor, the Democratic Party, Hong Kong&#x27;s flagship pro-democracy party. He was also a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong from 1985 to 1997 and from 1998 to 2008. Nicknamed the &quot;Father of Democracy&quot; in Hong Kong, he is recognised as one of the most prominent advocates for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong and China.

A barrister by profession, Lee served as the chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association from 1980 to 1983. In 1985 he was elected to the Legislative Council, where he advocated strongly for the protection of human rights and democratic reform. He became involved in discussions over Hong Kong&#x27;s handover to China, and in 1985 he joined the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee to assist in the drafting of Hong Kong&#x27;s Basic Law, the city&#x27;s mini-constitution post-handover. He was, however, expelled from the body in 1989 in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen square crackdown, due to his condemnation of the Beijing government&#x27;s role in the incident and his vocal support for the student protestors. 

In 1990, he became the founding chairman of the first pro-democracy party in Hong Kong, the United Democrats of Hong Kong, and later its successor, the Democratic Party. Under his leadership, the party won two landslide victories in the direct elections of 1991 and 1995, and emerged as one of the largest political parties in Hong Kong. He worked closely with the last Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten in an attempt to push forward constitutional reform in relation to democratic elections, attracting strong criticism from the Beijing government. In June 1997, he was forced to step down from his office when the colonial legislature was dissolved, alongside a number of other legislators; they later won back their seats in the Legislative Council in 1998.

He resigned as the chairman of the Democratic Party in December 2002, and in 2008 he retired as a member of the Legislative Council. Prior to July 2020 he remained active in advocating and lobbying for the democratic cause both locally and internationally. This ended with the passage of the Hong Kong National Security Law on 1 July 2020.

==Early life, education and legal career==
A son of Kuomintang Lieutenant General Lee Yin-wo, Lee was born in Hong Kong on 8 June 1938, his mother having journeyed to the British colony on a vacation. His father fought against the Empire of Japan during World War II. In 1949, the family moved to Hong Kong after the Communist takeover of China. Lee&#x27;s father taught at Wah Yan College, a Jesuit school in Kowloon, for nine years, and then taught part time at the Institute of Chinese Studies. His father maintained a good relationship with the Communist leadership, notably Premier Zhou Enlai, who repeatedly invited him back to the Mainland. Lee Yin-wo&#x27;s funeral in 1989 was attended by people from both sides of the political spectrum.

Martin Lee studied at Wah Yan College, Kowloon and read English Literature and Philosophy at the University of Hong Kong, sponsored by his mentor, the renowned barrister Dr. Patrick Yu. After graduating in 1960, Lee taught for three years before training as a barrister at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in England. He was called to the bar and began practising law in Hong Kong in 1966. During the 1967 Hong Kong riots, Lee defended the pro-Beijing Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions at court, thus laying the foundations of his future relationship with the Chinese Communist Party. In 1979, he was made Queen&#x27;s Counsel. From 1980 to 1983, he was the chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association.

== Political career ==

=== Entry into politics ===
Lee began his involvement in politics when the British and Chinese governments began their negotiations over Hong Kong&#x27;s sovereignty in the early 1980s. Lee was in the delegation consisting of Hong Kong&#x27;s young professionals led by Allen Lee, a member of the Executive and the Legislative Councils of Hong Kong in Beijing in May 1983. The delegation sought to maintain the status quo in Hong Kong and extend British rule by an additional 15 to 30 years. Their requests were turned down by Beijing officials.

Lee was concerned about the maintenance of judicial independence under Chinese rule and called for the preservation of Hong Kong&#x27;s legal system. He also suggested the creation of an independent Court of Final Appeal in place of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council after 1997. In December 1984, he was invited as one of the attendees at the signing ceremony of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. In 1985, he was among the 23 Hong Kong representatives invited by Beijing to sit on the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee to draft the mini-constitution of post-1997 Hong Kong, the Basic Law of Hong Kong, where he met another outspoken democrat Szeto Wah. Lee and Szeto became the two lone dissidents in the heavily Beijing-influenced Drafting Committee. Lee&#x27;s father warned him that the Chinese Communists liked to use people and then get rid of them. Lee said he told his father that &quot;I know the chances of implementing this policy &#x27;One Country, Two Systems&#x27; and Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong are not great. But then I know if I don&#x27;t even try, the chances are zero.&quot;

In September 1985, Martin Lee ran in the Legislative Council elections when the Hong Kong government decided to introduce a handful of indirectly elected seats. His surprise victory over another prominent barrister Henry Litton and lawyer Edmund Chow in a three-way contest in the Legal functional constituency, elected by all the lawyers in Hong Kong, catapulted him to the political stage. He retained his seat in the 1988 re-election unopposed. He became the most recognisable and consistent voice pressing for rapid democratic reform. In the debate on the 1988 Green Paper on the Further Development of Representative Government, Lee was at the forefront of a campaign to introduce direct elections in the 1988 election with Szeto Wah, who won a seat in 1985 through the Teaching constituency. He and other liberals formed the Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government in 1986, which consisted of about 190 organisations who rallied support for direct elections, including the collection of 220,000 signatures (incl. names and identity card numbers). However, the government concluded in the White Paper that direct elections should not be introduced in 1988 based on public opinion. Lee condemned the government for mishandling the consultative exercise, accusing them of backing down on direct elections in the face of Beijing&#x27;s pressure.

He also campaigned against the construction of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in 1986 in which the Chernobyl disaster sparked fears over safety among the Hong Kong public. Lee actively sought for public support through meetings and a signature campaign, which collected over one million signatures. He criticised the government for not disclosing information about the project and attempted to force the government to disclose information under the Legislative Council Power and Privilege Ordinance. He again rallied public support against the amendment of the Public Order Ordinance in 1987 in which the government sought to criminalise the &quot;publishing of false news likely to cause public alarm.&quot; Lee worked diligently against the provision, moving the amendment &quot;that any prosecution could only be made upon official proof that a report is false and reckless and that the defendant knew that the facts are false or failed to prove the validity of the facts out of rash&quot; but failed. The case was submitted before the United Nations Human Rights Committee in November 1988 and was eventually repealed in January 1989.

From 1988 to 1991, he was appointed chairman of the Hong Kong Consumer Council. He also served as legal adviser to the Hong Kong Journalists Association, the Scout Association of Hong Kong and numerous professional bodies.

=== Tiananmen Square protests and democracy movements ===
In the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee, Lee also actively lobbied for a democratic post-1997 political system with Szeto Wah. He and the liberals proposed the &quot;Group of 190&quot; proposal which demanded a directly elected government set up as soon as possible. Their view was countered bya number of conservatives in the Drafting and Consultative Committees who rallied under the name of the &quot;Group of 89&quot; backed by big-business interests.

During the Tiananmen protests May and June 1989, Martin Lee was an outspoken supporter of the student movement for more democracy and freedom in China. He, Szeto Wah and other liberals formed the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China in May of which he was the vice-chairman, organising multiple rallies in support of the students in Hong Kong which attracted hundreds of thousands of attendees. After the military crackdown, Lee led the Hong Kong demonstration against the Beijing authorities. He told BBC&#x27;s Jonathan Dimbleby that &quot;handing over 5.5 million people to China who are deemed counter-revolutionary is like handing over 5.5 million Jews to Nazi Germany during the Second World War, when they were born in a British territory.&quot; He also said that it could not be presumed that &quot;the Joint Declaration is as inviolable as the Bible. Britain and China should restart talks to reach a better agreement for Hong Kong than the declaration decided in 1984.&quot; He also testified before the United States Congress Committee on human rights and aired support to imposing economic sanctions against for the massacre.

In July 1989, he and Szeto Wah were labelled as &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; by the state-owned &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;. The duo&#x27;s membership in the Drafting Committee was subsequently stripped by the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee after they were barred from attending any meetings due to their &quot;anti-China stance&quot;. He was then barred from entering Mainland China, with the only exception of a brief visit in Guangdong in 2005 as a Legislative Council member, in which he responded: &quot;As a Chinese citizen, I am not allowed back to my own country even though I&#x27;m welcome in every country in the world.&quot; The strained relationship between Lee and the Communist Party also led to the constant attacks from the pro-Beijing media.
In response to the worsening crisis of confidence in Hong Kong, he joined hands with many politicians from different spectrum to advocating the granting of the right of abode in Britain to Hong Kong people as a &quot;safety exit&quot;. He also called for the rapid introduction of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and a fully democratically elected Legislative Council before 1997. He also began to lobby the United States to develop a specific policy on Hong Kong&#x27;s democracy development. However he opposed the US idea of withdrawing &quot;most favoured nation&quot; status from Beijing. Martin Lee&#x27;s efforts resulted in the adoption of the United States–Hong Kong Policy Act in 1992.

Martin Lee has increasingly been seen as the spokesman for Hong Kong democracy on the international stage. In June 1995, &quot;Asiaweek&quot; magazine named Lee one of Twenty Great Asians &quot;who have changed the region over the past two decades.&quot; In September 1995, ABC TV named Martin Lee its &quot;Person of the Week&quot; for leading Hong Kong&#x27;s pro-democracy forces to electoral success. Lee was also awarded by a number of international organisations, including the &quot;1995 International Human Rights Award&quot; by the American Bar Association, the Prize For Freedom by the Liberal International in 1996, the &quot;Democracy Award&quot; by the US National Endowment for Democracy in 1997, and the &quot;Schuman Medal&quot; in 2000 which Lee was the first non-European to receive from the European Peoples Party and European Democrats. In November 2004 he was awarded by Rutgers College with the Brennan Human Rights Award.

In preparation for the first direct elections of the Legislative Council in 1991, the liberals gathered themselves on the basis of the Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government to form a first major political party in Hong Kong, the United Democrats of Hong Kong in April 1990. Martin Lee was elected the party&#x27;s founding chairman. Under Lee&#x27;s leadership, the United Democrats won a landslide victory in the election, pocketing 12 of the 18 directly elected seats, out of the total number of 60 seats in the Legislative Council. Martin Lee himself was elected through the Hong Kong Island East constituency, receiving the most votes in the election. After the election, the United Democrats became the largest party in the legislature.

In response to the election, the British government decided to appoint Chris Patten to become the last Hong Kong Governor. Chris Patten announced the constitutional reform package which largely expanded the electorates of the nine newly created functional constituencies. The package was strongly opposed by the Beijing government and alienated the pro-government Liberal Party led by Allen Lee who now became Beijing&#x27;s allies in the legislature. The United Democrats generally supported the Chris Patten&#x27;s package and eventually helped it to get passed in the Legislative Council. In response to Patten&#x27;s proposal, the Beijing government decided to dismantle the &quot;through train&quot; agreement, which allowed the 1995 elected legislature to transition beyond 1997, and replace it with the Provisional Legislative Council in which Lee deemed &quot;an illegal and unconstitutional body&quot;.

In preparation for the 1995 three-tier elections, the pro-democracy camp further consolidated themselves by merging the United Democrats and another moderate pro-democracy party Meeting Point into the Democratic Party in 1994 in which Martin Lee was elected the founding chairman. In the 1995 Legislative Council election in which all seats were elected, the Democratic Party scored another landslide victory, winning 12 seats of the 20 directly elected seats and 19 seats out of the total 60 seats, almost double than the second party Liberal Party. With other pro-democracy parties and individuals, the pro-democracy camp commanded about half of the seats in the legislature in the last two years of the colonial rule. On 30 June 1997 the eve of the handover of Hong Kong, the pro-democrats were forced to step down from the Legislative Council as the &quot;through train&quot; was dissolved.

On the eve of the handover of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, Lee travelled to Europe, Australia and the United States to express his concerns to officials, politicians and business leaders. He met in April with US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and later with President Bill Clinton, who had openly voiced out his support in democracy and human rights in China and Hong Kong. However he was dissatisfied with the Clinton administration&#x27;s unwillingness to take a tough line on the Beijing&#x27;s policy of Provisional Legislative Council. He met with Clinton again in 1998 during his visit to Hong Kong.

It was widely speculated that whether Martin Lee would become &quot;Martyr Lee&quot;, a nickname given by some in the business community, after 1997 given his high-profile pro-democracy and anti-Beijing stance which was seen as &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; and &quot;subversive&quot; by Beijing. Lee said he would never leave Hong Kong and stressed that he was not anti-China but only opposed the regime in Beijing.

=== Lee under Chinese rule ===
Martin Lee and the Democratic Party was elected back to the Legislative Council in the 1998 first election. Despite winning the most votes, the party seats decreased to 13, as their advantage was undermined by the proportional representation system installed by the Beijing-controlled Provisional Legislative Council. He went on getting re-elected for two more terms in 2000 and 2004.

A major concern about Hong Kong&#x27;s legal and political autonomy was raised in January 1999 when the government sought to the interpretation of the Basic Law by the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee after it was defeated in the Court of Final Appeal over the legal challenges over the right of abode of a person with at least one parent was a Hong Kong resident, as the Provisional Legislative Council passed ordinances restricting the right. The Basic Law interpretation sparked outcry from various sectors. Martin Lee accused the government of &quot;giving away&quot; Hong Kong&#x27;s autonomy and condemned this move as &quot;a dagger striking at the heart of the rule of law&quot; and in symbolic protest walked out of the Legislative Council with 18 other members, all dressed in black, while 600 lawyers dressed in black held a silent protest against the interpretation.
Martin Lee&#x27;s Democratic Party chairmanship was also embattled with the intra-party factional struggles, in which he failed to resolve the ideological differences between the party members. The radical &quot;Young Turks&quot; faction launched a coup d&#x27;état in the 2000 leadership election by challenging the vice-chairman post held by Anthony Cheung from the moderate faction and eventually ousted Cheung from the vice-chairman post. The factional struggles intensified the &quot;Young Turk&quot; leader Andrew To proposed to put the minimum wage legislation on the 2000 Legislative Council election platform which caused a fierce debate within the party and resulted in great disunity that led to the exodus of the &quot;Young Turks&quot; from the party and created a bad image in front of the public. Martin Lee&#x27;s decision to support former Bar Association chairman and barrister Audrey Eu over his Democratic Party member in the 2000 Hong Kong Island by-election also received criticism within the party. In 2002, Martin Lee decided to step down as party chairman and was succeeded by Yeung Sum.

In 2002 and 2003, Martin Lee and the Democratic Party opposed the proposed national security legislation on the basis of the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 which they feared would undermine the Hong Kong people&#x27;s civil liberties. Martin Lee traveled to the West to rally for international support. Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa bashed Lee for &quot;bad mouthing&quot; the Special Administrative Region in front of the international audience for six years. Lee replied by saying that they were merely bad-mouthing a law that would be &quot;thoroughly bad for Hong Kong&quot;. The protest against the Article 23 legislation eventually drew more than 500,000 people on 1 July 2003 and the government announced to shelve the bill indefinitely knowing that it could not get enough votes in the legislature. In March 2004 when Martin Lee went to Washington to testify on Hong Kong&#x27;s democracy development at a US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Beijing officials took rounds to attack Lee for inviting foreign power meddling in Hong Kong&#x27;s internal affairs. Lee was called &quot;traitor&quot; upon his return to Hong Kong by pro-Beijing media and supporters.

In the 2004 Legislative Council election, the pro-democracy camp filled two tickets in the Hong Kong Island geographical constituency, the Democratic Party&#x27;s Yeung Sum and Martin Lee and independent–Frontier joint ticket of Audrey Eu and Cyd Ho in hope of taking four seats out of six seats with the slogan &quot;1+1=4&quot;. However the pre-election polls showed that the Eu-Ho ticket had far more support and Lee was in danger of losing, causing the Democratic Party to request all supporters to vote instead for their ticket. As a result, the Yeung-Lee ticket drew too many votes from the Eu-Ho ticket, causing the defeat of Cyd Ho by Choy So-yuk of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, by a slim margin of 815 votes. When the results were announced in the morning of the following day, Martin Lee said in tears before cameras &quot;I&#x27;d rather lose with dignity than win like this&quot;, on the &quot;unexpected&quot; defeat of Cyd Ho. It also caused disaffection from the pro-democracy supporters.

In October 2007, Lee published an article named &quot;China&#x27;s Olympic Opportunity&quot; in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; criticising Beijing for not living up to its promise to improve its human rights status during the Summer Olympic bid. Lee urged the West, particularly the United States, not to boycott the 2008 Olympic games but to instead take the opportunity while China is opening itself up to the world to &quot;engage&quot; China directly to bring China closer to the international community in terms of its human rights. His article received rounds of criticism from the pro-Beijing media for asking the West to &quot;intervene&quot; China&#x27;s internal affairs. Some media even claimed that Lee asked United States to boycott the games. That immediately stirred backlash from Beijing loyalists, who virtually accused Lee of being a &quot;hanjian&quot;, traitor of the Han people. On 27 October, the Democratic Party issued an announcement to newspapers setting out the party&#x27;s position regarding the article Lee published. Chairman Albert Ho reiterated, &quot;It is not an apology, but a clear declaration of what we stand for.&quot;

After being a member of the Legislative Council for 23 years, Lee announced on 27 March 2008 that he would not seek re-election when his term ended in September of that year.

==After Legislative Council==

Martin Lee remained active in commenting politics and his legal practise after his retirement from the Legislative Council, especially taking cases of defending the pro-democracy activists who were charged for obstructing public order among other offences.

In 2009, he was marginalised by his party when he held different stance on the &quot;Five Constituencies Referendum&quot; proposed by the radical League of Social Democrats to press the government to implement the universal suffrage of the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council in 2012 by launching a territory-wide by-election after five pro-democracy Legislative Councillor resigned from their offices at the same time, while the majority wing of the party led by Szeto Wah openly opposed the plan who criticised Lee for &quot;not quite understanding politics&quot;. Lee attended the rally in support of the five resigned Legislative Councillors. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party began to negotiate with the Beijing authorities and reached an agreement with the government. After the agreement, Lee expressed his disappointment and his consideration of quitting the party.
Martin Lee actively lobbied in the West with former Chief Secretary for Administration and Hong Kong 2020 convenor Anson Chan for the support in the Hong Kong&#x27;s democracy movement during the debate on the 2017/2020 electoral reform in 2014. The duo went to the United States and met Joe Biden, US vice-president, Nancy Pelosi, minority leader of the House of Representatives, and members of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China and spoke out against Beijing increasing control over Hong Kong and their fear of only candidates picked by Beijing would be allowed to take part in the 2017 Chief Executive election. In July 2014, Martin Lee and Anson Chan visited the United Kingdom and met with Deputy Prime Minister and the leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg and attended a Foreign Affairs Select Committee hearing, speaking out that they were &quot;concerned that neither of the two signatories to the Joint Declaration – that is, China and Britain – is adequately fulfilling their respective responsibilities on the terms of this internationally binding treaty.&quot; Liu Xiaoming, Chinese ambassador to Britain, described Martin Lee and Anson Chan as &quot;bent on undermining the stability of Hong Kong&quot;.

In the massive pro-democracy Occupy protests from October to December 2014, he was among the pro-democracy activists staging a final sit-in and arrested, putting an end to a 75-day street occupation.

=== Small House Policy ===
In December 2018, Lee represented Kwok Cheuk-kin and Hendrick Lui Chi-hang in an attempt to repeal the Small House Policy, a policy which Lee said discriminates against the majority of people in Hong Kong by discriminating based on descent and gender.

In his arguments, Lee said that Qing dynasty laws did not forbid women or outsiders to buy land in the New Territories. Lee mentioned that the policy for villagers to build homes without paying land fees was only implemented after the British began to rule the New Territories in 1898, and that before then, there was no mention of such a policy under Qing dynasty rule. Therefore, Lee said that the right for male villagers to build homes without paying land fees are based on British policies and were never part of the indigenous traditions that the Basic Law protects under Article 40, which does not specifically mention small houses and only says &quot;The lawful traditional rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants of the &#x27;New Territories&#x27; shall be protected by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.&quot;

Finally, Lee also argued that the policy is based on a person&#x27;s descent and sex (women are excluded), which is &quot;unconstitutional&quot; as it was against Basic Law Article 25, which states &quot;All Hong Kong residents shall be equal before the law.&quot;

In response, Kenneth Lau Ip-keung of the Heung Yee Kuk, an organization that supports the small house policy, said that villagers &quot;firmly believe&quot; that the small house policy is protected under Article 40.

===Short arrest===
On 18 April 2020, Martin Lee was arrested as one of 15 Hong Kong high-profile democracy figures, on suspicion of organizing, publicizing or taking part in several unauthorized assemblies between August and October 2019 in the course of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. Following protocol, the police statement did not disclose the names of the accused. He was freed the same day on bail. After, Martin Lee said that he was arrested for the first time in his life but has no regrets and is proud of his democratic work: &quot;Over the months and years, I&#x27;ve felt bad to see so many outstanding youngsters being arrested and prosecuted, but I was not charged. Now I&#x27;ve finally become a defendant. I feel proud that I have a chance to walk this path of democracy together with them.&quot;

On 1 April 2021, district judge Amanda Jane Woodcock (胡雅文) convicted Martin Lee of &quot;holding an unauthorised assembly&quot;. On 16 April, Lee received a sentence of 11 months in jail, suspended for 24 months, for his part in the 2019 unauthorised assemblies. 

On 12 April 2024 Martin Lee (then aged 86) received from the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal a suspended sentence following conviction for taking part in an unauthorised procession in August 2019. The appeal generated considerable adverse publicity for Lord Neuberger (former President of the UK Supreme Court) for his participation in the decision.

On 27 December 2024, the Hong Kong Government stripped Lee of his title as a Justice of the Peace.

===National Security Law===
Lee stopped his public activism as a result of the Hong Kong National Security Law which went into effect on 1 July 2020. He stopped granting interviews to media organisations.

==Recognition==

Lee was nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by multiple Norwegian members of parliament.

==Personal life==
Lee is a devoted Roman Catholic and a close friend with Cardinal Joseph Zen. Lee&#x27;s wife is Amelia Lee Fong Yee-ngor (方綺娥). They have one son, Joseph Lee, also a barrister.

<text>National archives are central archives maintained by countries or nation states. This article contains a list of [[national archives]]. In some countries, national libraries serve the same purpose as national archives - or have archival departments.

Among their more important tasks is ensuring the accessibility and preservation of the information produced by governments, both analogically and digitally, for the government itself, researchers and the public.

Some national archives collections are large, holding millions of items spanning several centuries, while others have been created more recently and have modest collections. Many national archives are effectively dispersed, especially in post-colonial countries, and often have smaller local collections due to cultural imperialism and the theft of cultural and national documents and artifacts. There are ongoing international efforts to repatriate these materials to their communities of origin, in particular Indigenous cultural and intellectual property.

In the last decade, digitization projects have made possible to browse records and contents online.

<text>Daniël François Malan (; 22 May 1874 – 7 February 1959) was a South African politician who served as the fourth prime minister of South Africa from 1948 to 1954. The National Party implemented the system of apartheid, which enforced racial segregation laws, during his tenure as prime minister.

==Early life==

Daniël François Malan was born on 22 May 1874 in Riebeek-West in the Cape Colony. His father, who bore the same name, was a wealthy farmer and clergyman. His mother was Ana Magdalena du Toit. He was the fifth of nine children, four of whom did not survive childhood.

The progenitor of the Malan name in the South African region was a French Huguenot refugee named Jacques Malan from Provence (Mérindol), France, who arrived at the Cape before 1689. The Malan name is one of a number of Afrikaans names of French origin which have retained their original spelling. Malan&#x27;s older sister, Cinie, later became a missionary and linguist.

Malan obtained a B.A. in Music and Science from Victoria College, Stellenbosch, whereafter he entered the Stellenbosch seminary in order to train as a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. Along with his studies in theology, he obtained a M.A. in Philosophy from Victoria College, later to be the University of Stellenbosch. Malan left South Africa in 1900 to study towards a Doctorate in Divinity at the University of Utrecht, which he obtained in 1905.

==Career==

===Dutch Reformed Church minister===

Malan returned to South Africa, where he was ordained as a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church and served for six months as an assistant-minister in Heidelberg, Transvaal. He was an ardent fighter for the acceptance of Afrikaans, which was an emerging language fighting against Dutch and English, and was a founding member of the Afrikaanse Taal- en Kultuurvereniging (ATKV, &#x27;The Afrikaans Language and Cultural Society&#x27;), which was established in 1930. He was stationed in Montagu from 1906 to 1912 and thereafter in Graaff-Reinet until 1915. He also undertook a journey on behalf of the Dutch Reformed Church, visiting religious Afrikaners living in the Belgian Congo, Northern Rhodesia, and Southern Rhodesia.

===Political career===

Malan&#x27;s involvement in National Party politics began shortly after the NP&#x27;s formation in 1914. In those years, political parties had affiliated newspapers that served as their mouthpiece. However, Nationalist-minded Afrikaners in the Cape had no such outlet and therefore, in 1915, decided to found &quot;De Burger&quot;, which later became known as &quot;Die Burger.&quot; They persuaded Malan to become the editor of the new newspaper and he used it as a springboard for entry into parliament. As he was worried about the Afrikaners&#x27; political position in the aftermath of the 1914 Rebellion, he relinquished his position as a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church to accept the position. The Cape branch of the National Party was founded in 1915 and Malan was elected as its provincial leader. In 1918, he was elected to Parliament for the first time as MP for the seat of Calvinia in the House of Assembly. He held that seat until 1938 when he became the MP for Piketberg.

When the National Party came to power for the first time in 1924 under Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog, Malan was given the post of Minister of the Interior, Education and Public Health, which he held until 1933. In 1925, he was at the forefront of a campaign to replace Dutch with Afrikaans in the constitution and provide South Africa with a new national flag.

After the 1933 election, the United Party was formed out of the fusion of Hertzog&#x27;s National Party and the rival South African Party of Jan Smuts. Malan strongly opposed this merger and, in 1934, he and 19 other MPs defected to form the Purified National Party, which he led for the next 14 years as the opposition.

Malan opposed South African participation in World War II. South Africa&#x27;s participation in the conflict was unpopular among the Afrikaner population, and in 1939 that led to a split in the governing United Party. The defectors united with the National Party, dramatically strengthening Malan&#x27;s political position, and he consequently defeated Smuts and the United Party in the 1948 general election.

During Malan&#x27;s tenure as prime minister, South Africans lost the right of appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London under the terms of the Privy Council Appeals Act, 1950.

The foundations of apartheid were firmly laid during Malan&#x27;s six-and-a-half years as prime minister. On 24 February 1953, Malan was granted dictatorial powers to oppose black and Indian anti-apartheid movements. Malan resigned in 1954 at the age of 80 with the hopes of Nicolaas Havenga being appointed as the prime minister. However, Havenga was defeated by J. G. Strijdom.

==Death==

Malan died on 7 February 1959 at Môrewag, his home in Stellenbosch, aged 84. His book, &quot;Afrikaner Volkseenheid en my ervaringe op die pad daarheen&quot; (&quot;Afrikaner nationalism and my experiences on the road to it&quot;), was published in the same year by &quot;Nasionale Boekhandel&quot;. A collection of his writings and documents is housed in the Document Centre at the University of Stellenbosch&#x27;s J.S. Gericke Library. He is positioned 81st on the SABC3&#x27;s Great South Africans list.

<text>The National Archives Building, known informally as Archives I, is the headquarters of the United States National Archives and Records Administration. It is located north of the National Mall at 700 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. in Washington, D.C. The rotunda entrance is on Constitution Avenue, and the research entrance is on Pennsylvania Avenue. A second larger facility, Archives II, also known as A2, is located in College Park, Maryland.

Built in the 1930s, in December 2023, the National Archives Building was designated a National Historic Landmark. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and is a contributing property to the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site.

==Exhibits==
The National Archives building holds original copies of the three main formative documents of the United States and its government: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. These are on display for the public in the main chamber&#x27;s rotunda, known as Charters of Freedom, at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. The Emancipation Proclamation will be added to the permanent display in 2026.

The building hosts additional important American historical items, including the Continental Association, the Articles of Confederation, the Louisiana Purchase Treaty, and collections of photography and other historically and culturally significant American and international artifacts, including an original version of the 1297 Magna Carta confirmed by Edward I.

Between 2003 and 2004 the National Archives also held special exhibits to the public for the Gettysburg Address and Emancipation Proclamation.

Inside the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom, there are no lines to see the individual documents and visitors are allowed to walk from document to document as they wish. Photography with natural light is permitted in research rooms.

==History==
===Before the National Archives Building===
From its founding, the U.S. federal government has documented its policies and decisions, but for almost 150 years it had virtually no method or place to safeguard historically important records. During those years, officials occasionally decried federal neglect, or too often, fires destroyed important documents, reinforcing the need for an archives. By the end of the 19th century, a few architects had even submitted plans to the government for an archives or a hall of records. By the early 20th century an organized effort aimed at creating the National Archives began, but not until 1926 did Congress finally approve the National Archives Building.

===Planning stages===
That year, Congress authorized construction of the National Archives Building as part of a massive public buildings program designed to beautify the center of Washington, DC, and provide office space for the growing federal bureaucracy. This program led to the design and construction of buildings within the Federal Triangle. Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon gave the responsibility for designing the Triangle grouping to a Board of Architectural Consultants. Louis A. Simon, an architect of the Office of the Supervising Architect for the U.S. Treasury, drafted a preliminary design for the Archives, placing it along Pennsylvania Avenue between 9th and 10th Streets, NW. (This was prior to Simon&#x27;s appointment as Supervising Architect in 1933.)

In late 1927, preliminary drawings of the individual Triangle buildings were incorporated into a formal presentation of the entire project. The drawings became the basis for a three-dimensional scale model that was publicly unveiled in April 1929. The next month, after examining the model, the Commission of Fine Arts was highly critical of Simon&#x27;s design for an archives. Commissioners suggested that the noted architect John Russell Pope be added to the Board of Architectural Consultants and that he design the National Archives. Pope was asked to join when the death of a board member created a vacancy.

Pope&#x27;s architectural vision transformed both the location and design of the National Archives Building. He successfully proposed relocating the Archives to the block between Seventh and Eighth Streets, a site he believed demanded a monumental building such as the National Archives. In place of Simon&#x27;s design, Pope&#x27;s National Archives was to be a neoclassical temple befitting an institution dedicated to American history. The site was already occupied by a prominent landmark, the Center Market. The building was demolished to make way for the archives building.

===Breaking ground===
Ground was broken for the National Archives on September 5, 1931, by the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Ferry K. Heath. By the time President Herbert Hoover laid the cornerstone of the building in February 1933, significant problems had arisen. Because the massive structure was to be constructed above an underground stream, the Tiber Creek, 8,575 piles had been driven into the unstable soil, before pouring a huge concrete bowl as a foundation. Another difficulty arose over the choice of building materials. Both limestone and granite were authorized as acceptable, but construction began during the darkest days of the Great Depression, and suppliers of each material lobbied fiercely to have the government use their stone. Ultimately, as in the other Federal Triangle buildings, limestone was used for the exterior superstructure and granite for the base. The limestone was provided by Ingalls Stone Company of Bedford, Indiana.

===Construction===
Constructing the National Archives was a monumental task. Not only was the building the most ornate structure on the Federal Triangle, but it also called for installation of specialized air-handling systems and filters, reinforced flooring, and thousands of feet of shelving to meet the building&#x27;s archival storage requirements. The building&#x27;s exterior took more than 4 years to finish and required a host of workers ranging from sculptors and model makers to air-conditioning contractors and structural-steel workers.

===Completion===
In November 1935, 120 National Archives staff members moved into their uncompleted building. Most of the exterior work was complete, but many stack areas, where records would be stored, had no shelving for incoming records. Work also continued on the Rotunda and other public spaces. More significantly, earlier estimates about the need for future stack space proved to be quite insufficient. Almost as soon as Pope&#x27;s original design was complete, a project to fill the Archives&#x27; interior courtyard began, doubling storage space from to more than .

John Russell Pope&#x27;s vision of the Archives as a temple of history has been preserved through maintenance and periodic restoration work on the building since the mid-1930s. Over the years, however, more records filled the building and even the courtyard expansion proved to be inadequate. By the late 1960s, the building reached its storage capacity of and the agency began renting large amounts of storage and administrative space. The 1993 completion of a second National Archives building in College Park, Maryland, added to the National Archives, providing the nation with the most modern archives facility in the world.

===Reencasement and renovation===
The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights have been displayed to the public in the Rotunda of the National Archives Building since 1952. That year National Bureau of Standards placed the documents into hermetically sealed encasements filled with inert helium gas, which the Bureau believed would preserve the Charters well into the next century. Since the 1952 installation, National Archives conservators have conducted regular visual inspections of the encased documents. Since 1987, these inspections have been greatly enhanced through the use of an electronic imaging monitoring system developed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.

In an electronic inspection of the documents in 1995, conservators noticed changes in the glass encasements of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. Glass experts from Libby-Owens-Ford (the original manufacturer of the encasement glass) and the Corning Glass Museum determined that the case glass components were showing signs of deterioration. Both the glass experts and the National Archives Advisory Committee on Preservation recommended that the Charters be reencased within seven years (by 2002) to ensure the continued safety and preservation of the documents.

In July 2001, the Charters were taken off display in the Rotunda to be removed from their deteriorating cases. National Archives conservators removed the documents from their cases and analyzed their condition. Appropriate conservation measures were taken on each document and they have been installed in the new encasements, returning to public display in September 2003.

== Statues ==

Outside of the National Archives building stands four statues, carved from 1934–1935. The sculptors were most likely chosen by the designer of the National Archives building, Pope and the Commission on Fine Arts. They were carved from large slabs of limestone, shipped to DC from Indiana on specifically designed flatcars. Two are on the south side of the building and two are on the north at the two main entrances of the building. These statues weigh 65-tons each and measure tall, with the pedestals. 

The statues to the north are of an old man, titled &quot;Past&quot;, and a young woman, titled &quot;Future&quot; or &quot;Present&quot; by Robert Aiken, assisted by Attilio Piccirilli. The man&#x27;s pedestals is inscribed with &quot;Study the Past,&quot; quoting Confucius, and the woman&#x27;s with &quot;What is Past is Prologue,&quot; from &quot;The Tempest&quot;. At the base of the woman&#x27;s feet are symbols representing &quot;arts and sciences&quot; and at the man&#x27;s feet, &quot;symbols of strength and unity,&quot; according to a historian who works for the National Archives. The statues guarding the south entrance of the building are named &quot;Heritage&quot; and &quot;Guardianship&quot;. These were carved by James Earl Fraser, assisted by David Rubins, Sidney Waugh and carver Gino A. Ratti. &quot;Heritage&quot; depicts a woman with a child, a bundle of wheat, and an urn in her arms. These &quot;[symbolize] the government&#x27;s role in preserving the home.&quot; Inscribed in her pedestal is &quot;The heritage of the past is the seed that brings forth the harvest of the future,&quot; a quote from Wendell Phillips, around which are symbols that represent &quot;the importance of home.&quot; &quot;Guardianship&quot; is of a muscular man who holds a sword and a plumed helmet in the Roman style. His pedestal says, &quot;Eternal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty,” which comes from Thomas Jefferson, around which are different symbols of war.

There are additional sculptures in the pediments of the building showing figures that represent history, inspiration, destiny, and guardianship.

==Warren Commission==
Investigating the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Warren Commission met formally for the first time on December 5, 1963 in a hearing room on the second floor of the National Archives Building.

==In popular culture==

*A section of the 2004 film &quot;National Treasure&quot; takes place in the National Archives Building, where the Declaration of Independence is featured being stolen from.
*The building appears in the 2008 videogame &quot;Fallout 3&quot;. Inside it, a powdered wig-wearing robot, believing itself to be the Founding Father Button Gwinnett, can be found guarding the Declaration of Independence.

<doc id="424377" wikidata="Q125527791" url="?curid=424377" title="Collapse!">
<text>Collapse! is a series of tile-matching video games by Seattle-based GameHouse. In 2007, &quot;Super Collapse! 3&quot; became the first game to win the Game of the Year at the inaugural Zeebys. The series has been discontinued since 2015 due to RealNetworks shutting down its internal games studio.

In 2006, a spin-off series called Super Collapse Puzzle Gallery! was developed into 5 games.

==Gameplay==
The classic &quot;Collapse!&quot; game is played on a board of twelve columns by fifteen rows. Randomly colored blocks fill the board, rising from below. By clicking on a group of 3 or more blocks of the same color, the whole group disappears in a collapse and any blocks stacked above fall down to fill in the vacant spaces. If a whole column is cleared, the elements slide to the center of the field. If one or more blocks rise beyond the top row of the board, the game is lost. If the player manages to survive a specified number of lines without losing, they win the level and are awarded points for successful completion.

A level usually begins with a few rows of blocks using a starting set of colors (typically red, green, blue, white, and yellow). One after the other, new blocks are added to a &quot;feed&quot; row below the board. When the feeder row has filled, all of its blocks are moved up, to the active board, shifting the field of remaining blocks higher. During the course of a level, the rate of new blocks entering the feed increases. New colors may also be introduced, making it more challenging for the player to find groups that are large enough to be collapsed.

In higher levels of the game, &quot;bombs&quot; appear, mixed among the blocks. The bombs are black (in which case clicking on them causes the surrounding blocks to disappear), or are the color of one of the groups of bricks (in which case clicking on the bomb eliminates all bricks on the board that are the same color). Black bombs have the additional quality of serving as a bridge between bricks of the same color; if two or more bricks of the same color are touching a bomb, then clicking one of those bricks has the same effect of clicking on a group of three or more bricks of the same color. In &quot;Super Collapse 3!&quot;, this rule is changed to allow colored bombs to act as a bridge between matching groups. On higher levels, grey blocks with an &quot;X&quot; on it appear. They cannot be clicked even if they form a group of three, and therefore can only be removed by bombs.

When a player completes a certain number of &quot;even-numbered&quot; levels (i.e., from level 2, 4, 8, 10, 14 and 16), a bonus level is played. Here, the player has 15 seconds to completely clear a screenful of bricks and earn extra points.

==Games==
===Web &amp; &quot;Super Collapse!&quot;===

In late 1998, Ben Exworthy and Garr Godfrey worked together to release the original &quot;Collapse!&quot; as a browser-based game.

In 2001, GameHouse developed and released &quot;Super Collapse!&quot;, a standalone download for Microsoft Windows. This new version adds enhanced graphical resolution, animations, sounds and music. Afterwards, GameHouse continued to use the word &quot;super&quot; in the titles of its download games, to distinguish them from the web-based versions.

===&quot;Super Collapse! II&quot;===
In 2002, one year after the release of &quot;Super Collapse!&quot;, GameHouse would create the first true sequel in the series, &quot;Super Collapse! II&quot;. In addition to the classic gameplay, &quot;Super Collapse II&quot; would offer Relapse, Strategy, and Puzzle modes.

===&quot;Super Collapse! 3&quot;===
&quot;Super Collapse! 3&quot; continued expanding the work of previous &quot;Collapse!&quot; games. In addition to three new modes (Slider, Continuous, Countdown), &quot;Super Collapse! 3&quot; introduced a &quot;quest&quot; mode where players progressed through a whimsical world, unlocking new levels as they go. Sound effects and music for &quot;Collapse! 3&quot; were created and composed by Jesse Holt.

In 2006, it received a Zeeby award and was named the Best Casual Game of the Year.

===&quot;Collapse!&quot; (2009)===

In late 2009, GameHouse released all new versions of the game dubbed &quot;COLLAPSE!&quot; across several platforms including Windows, Mac, Facebook, and mobile. While each version is uniquely designed for each major platform, players can earn special codes to unlock bonuses in the PC, Mac, and Facebook versions.

====Facebook app====
The first of these new games was a Facebook application, released in October. Players compete with friends in weekly tournaments, with a new game variation unlocked each day. During any given week, players can play and replay any previous day&#x27;s challenge (for example, to maximize a score) but, at the end of the week, the scores are locked, combined into weekly totals, and winners declared.

====iPhone and mobile====
In December 2009, the iPhone and iPod Touch version of &quot;COLLAPSE!&quot; was released to the iTunes Store. Like &quot;Super Collapse 3&quot;, this version featured a quest mode where the player would advance through a world, unlocking new levels. Unlike &quot;Collapse 3&quot;, this version introduced player and enemy characters as well as a name for its fictional world: &quot;Blocktopia&quot;.

According to RealNetworks, this new mobile game used a proprietary development platform, Emerge, and is capable of being ported to eight mobile operating systems, 130 cell phone carriers and distributors. A version for Android as well as BlackBerry and other devices was released a few weeks later.

====Windows and Mac====
Released in December 2009, the PC and Mac version of &quot;COLLAPSE!&quot; continued to evolve the game in the direction set out by &quot;Super Collapse 3&quot;.

The &quot;Quest&quot; mode from &quot;Super Collapse 3&quot; has been renamed &quot;Adventure&quot; in &quot;COLLAPSE!&quot; and updated to feature not only a more detailed world (&quot;Blocktopia&quot;) but also a story and a customizable avatar to take through it. Each land within Blocktopia is plagued with a unique catastrophe that must be repaired one level at a time. At the end of each land, players battle against a comic boss who uses special powers and techniques to vary the gameplay and challenge the player.

Completing levels rewards players with coins that can be used to purchase power-ups, avatar clothing, and additional game features in shops located throughout the world. There are also casinos where players can play games of chance to win even more coins if they run into difficulty.

While much of the classic gameplay is unchanged, one significant variation is the addition of double boards. These modes place a second game board alongside the first and players must switch attention between the two.

<doc id="424379" wikidata="Q99327" url="?curid=424379" title="Falkirk Wheel">
<text>The Falkirk Wheel (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Cuibhle na h-Eaglaise Brice&quot;) is a rotating boat lift in Tamfourhill, Falkirk, in central Scotland, connecting the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal. It opened in 2002 as part of the Millennium Link project, reconnecting the two canals for the first time since the 1930s.

The plan to regenerate central Scotland&#x27;s canals and reconnect Glasgow with Edinburgh was led by British Waterways with support and funding from seven local authorities, the Scottish Enterprise Network, the European Regional Development Fund, and the Millennium Commission. Planners decided early to create a dramatic 21st-century landmark structure to reconnect the canals, instead of simply recreating the historic lock flight.

The wheel raises boats by , but the Union Canal is still higher than the aqueduct which meets the wheel. Boats must also pass through a pair of locks between the top of the wheel and the Union Canal. The Falkirk Wheel is the only rotating boat lift of its kind in the world, and one of two working boat lifts in the United Kingdom, the other being the Anderton Boat Lift.

==History==

===Pre-1933 link===

The two canals served by the wheel were previously connected by a series of 11 locks. With a difference in height, it required of water per run and took most of a day to pass through the flight.

By the 1930s these had fallen into disuse, and the locks were dismantled in 1933. The Forth and Clyde Canal closed at the end of 1962, and by the mid-1970s the Union Canal was filled in at both ends, rendered impassable by culverts in two places and run in pipes under a housing estate. The British Waterways Board (BWB) came into existence on 1 January 1963, the day the Forth and Clyde Canal was closed, with the objective of finding a broad strategy for the future of canals in the United Kingdom.

In 1976, the BWB decided after a meeting with local councils that the Forth and Clyde Canal, fragmented by various developments, was to have its remaining navigability preserved by building new bridges with sufficient headroom for boats and continuing to maintain the existing locks. Restoration of sea-to-sea navigation was deemed too expensive at the time, but there were to be no further restrictions on its use. A 1979 survey report documented 69 obstructions to navigation, and sought the opinions of twenty interested parties to present the Forth and Clyde Local (Subject) Plan in 1980.

===Proposal===
The Lotteries Act 1993 resulted in the creation of the Millennium Commission to disseminate funds raised by the sale of lottery tickets for selected &quot;good causes&quot;. In 1996, when sufficient funds had been accumulated, the Commission invited applications to &quot;do anything they thought desirable ... to support worthwhile causes which would mark the year 2000 and the start of the new millennium.&quot; The conditions were that the Commission would fund no more than half of the project, with the remaining balance being covered by project backers.

The BWB had made an earlier plan for the reopening of the canal link, which comprehensively covered the necessary work. In 1994, the BWB announced its plan to bid for funding, which was submitted in 1995 on behalf of the Millennium Link Partnership. The plans called for the canals to be opened to their original operating dimensions, with of headroom above the water. The whole project had a budget of £78 million.

On 14 February 1997, the Commission announced it would support the Link with £32 million of funding, 42% of the project cost. The Wheel and its associated basin was priced at £17 million, more than a fifth of the total budget. Another £46 million had to be raised in the next two years before construction could commence, with contributions from BWB, seven local councils, Scottish Enterprise, and private donations being augmented by £8.6 million from the European Regional Development Fund.

===Design===
The Morrison–Bachy Soletanche Joint Venture Team submitted their original design, which resembled a Ferris wheel with four gondolas, in 1999. It was agreed by all parties that the design was functional, but not the showpiece the BWB were looking for. After being asked to reconsider, a 20-strong team of architects and engineers was assembled by British Waterways. Under the leadership of Tony Kettle from architects RMJM, the initial concepts and images were created with the mechanical concepts proposed by the design team from Butterley and M G Bennetts. This was an intense period of work, with the final design concept completed in a three-week period during the summer of 1999. The final design was a co-operative effort between the British Waterways Board, engineering consultants Arup, Butterley Engineering and RMJM.

Diagrams of gear systems that had been proposed in the very first concepts were modelled by Kettle using his 8-year-old daughter&#x27;s Lego. Drawings and artist impressions were shown to clients and funders. The visitor centre was designed by another RMJM architect, Paul Stallan.

Inspirations for the design include a double-headed Celtic axe (a bearded axe), the propeller of a ship and the ribcage of a whale. Kettle described the Wheel as &quot;a beautiful, organic flowing thing, like the spine of a fish,&quot; and the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland described it as &quot;a form of contemporary sculpture.&quot;

Models and renderings of the Falkirk Wheel were displayed in a 2012 exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Since 2007, the Falkirk Wheel has been featured on the obverse of the new series of £50 notes issued by the Bank of Scotland. The series of notes commemorates Scottish engineering achievements with illustrations of bridges in Scotland such as the Glenfinnan Viaduct and the Forth Bridge.

===Construction===

In March 1999 Donald Dewar, the Secretary of State for Scotland, cut the first sod of turf to begin work at lock 31 on the Forth and Clyde Canal. Over 1000 people were employed in the construction of the wheel, which was designed to last for at least 120 years.

The wheel was fully constructed and assembled at the Butterley Engineering plant in Ripley, Derbyshire. The structure was then dismantled in the summer of 2001, and transported on 35 lorry loads to Falkirk, before being reassembled into five sections on the ground and lifted into place. Construction of the canal required of excavation, a canal tunnel of diameter, aqueducts of and , three sets of locks and a number of bridges, as well as of access roads. The Rough Castle Tunnel was driven in three stages, with the two upper quarters being drilled with a standard excavator before the lower half was dug using a modified road planer in layers. This technique was 15% cheaper and reduced the build time of the tunnel by two weeks.

===Technical considerations===

The ground on which the wheel is built was previously used as an open cast fire clay mine, a coal mine, and a tar works, resulting in contamination of the canal with tar and mercury. of loosely packed backfill from the mining operations containing large sandstone boulders was not considered adequately solid foundation for the size of the structure, so deep foundations with thirty concrete piles socketed onto the bedrock were used.

Due to the changing load as the wheel rotates in alternating directions, some sections experience total stress reversals. In order to avoid fatigue that could lead to cracks, sections were bolted rather than welded, using over 14,000 bolts and 45,000 bolt holes.

The aqueduct, engineered by Arup, was originally described as &quot;unbuildable&quot;, but was eventually realised using rebar. The original plans also showed the canal being built straight through the Antonine Wall, but this was changed after a petition in favour of two locks and a tunnel under the wall.

===Opening ceremony===

On 24 May 2002, Queen Elizabeth II opened the Falkirk Wheel as part of her Golden Jubilee celebrations. The opening was delayed a month due to flooding caused by vandals who forced open the wheel&#x27;s gates. The damage, which cost £350,000 to repair, resulted in the dry well being flooded, damaging electrical and hydraulic equipment.

==Operation==

===Structure===

The wheel has an overall diameter of and consists of two opposing arms extending beyond the central axle and taking the shape of a Celtic-inspired double-headed axe. Two sets of these axe-shaped arms are connected to a diameter central axle of length . Two diametrically opposed water-filled caissons, each with a capacity of , are fitted between the ends of the arms.

The caissons, or gondolas, always carry a combined weight of of water and boats, with the gondolas themselves each weighing . Care is taken to maintain the water levels on each side, thus balancing the weight on each arm. According to Archimedes&#x27; principle, floating objects displace their own weight in water, so when the boat enters, the amount of water leaving the caisson weighs exactly the same as the boat. Site-wide computer control system maintain the water levels on each side to within a difference of with water level sensors, automated sluices and pumps. It takes to power ten hydraulic motors, which consume per half-turn, roughly the same as boiling eight kettles of water.

Each of the two caissons is wide and long. Each can hold up to four canal boats. The wheel raises or lowers boats a total of , and two subsequent locks raise or lower boats another .

===Watertight doors===
Watertight doors at each end match doors located on the upper structure and lower dock pit. Due to space concerns, where a normal hinged door would dramatically reduce the useful length of the caisson, vertically rising hinged doors were chosen. The doors are raised from a recess in the base of the caisson and powered by a hydraulic lance when docked.

After the wheel arms are moved into the vertical position, the locking mechanisms are activated. These include securing pins that are protruded into the caisson bases, and hydraulic clamps that are raised to hold the caissons in place. Additionally, a set of larger securing pins at the lower structure is used to hold the wheel. Although the door of the upper caisson and the door that holds the water at the upper aqueduct are aligned, there is a gap between them. The upper aqueduct door has a U-shape watertight frame which can be extended to push against the caisson door to seal the gap. The water is pumped into the gap to fill to the water level. Once the water in the gap is equalized, the door on the aqueduct side is lowered, followed by the door on the caisson side, allowing the boat to pass. On the reverse direction, when the boat is in the caisson, the caisson door is raised, followed by the upper aqueduct door. The water is pumped out of the gap. Then the U-shape watertight seal is recessed back closer to the upper aqueduct door. Finally, the locking mechanisms are removed before the wheel is turned. This process is similar for the door at the lower canal basin as well.

===Engine room===
The area housing the machinery to drive the wheel is located in the final pillar of the aqueduct, and contains seven chambers connected by ladders. Access is by a door located at ground level or an entrance halfway up the tower, with a gantry crane to facilitate the installation of equipment.

The ground floor houses the transformers for powering the wheel. When the wheel was flooded by vandals in April 2002, this room was filled to within of the 11-kV busbars. On the first floor is a standby generator and switchgear should the mains supply to the wheel fail. The second floor houses a pair of hydraulic pumps that drive the hydraulic motors in the chamber above. Power is supplied directly to the axle with 10 hydraulic motors, which also double as brakes. Connected to each motor is a 100:1 gear system to reduce the rotation speed.

===Mechanism===

The caissons are required to turn with the wheel in order to remain level. Whilst the weight of the caissons on the bearings is generally sufficient to rotate them, a gearing mechanism using three large identically sized gears connected by two smaller ones ensures that they turn at precisely the correct speed and remain correctly balanced.

Each end of each caisson is supported on small wheels, which run on rails on the inside face of the diameter holes at the ends of the arms. The rotation is controlled by a train of gears: an alternating pattern of three diameter ring gears and two smaller idler gears, all with external teeth, as shown in the picture. The large central gear is fitted loosely over the axle at its machine-room end and fixed in place to prevent it from rotating. The two smaller gears are fixed to each of the arms of the wheel at its machine-room end. When the motors rotate the central axle, the arms swing and the small gears engage the central gear, which results in the smaller gears rotating at a higher speed than the wheel but in the same direction. The smaller gears engage the large ring gears at the end of the caissons, driving them at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction. This cancels the rotation due to the arms and keeps the caissons stable and perfectly level.

===Docking pit===
The docking pit is a drydock-like port isolated from the lower canal basin by watertight gates and kept dry by water pumps. When the wheel stops with its arms in the vertical position it is possible for boats to enter and exit the lower caisson when the gates are open without flooding the docking pit. The space below the caisson is empty.

Without the docking pit, the caissons and extremities of the arms of the wheel would be immersed in water at the lower canal basin each time the wheel rotated. The buoyancy of the lower caisson would make it more difficult to turn the wheel.

===Visitor centre===
A visitor centre is located on the east side of the lower basin. Boat trips on the wheel depart approximately once an hour. Since the wheel opened, around 5.5 million people have visited and 1.3 million have taken a boat trip, with around 400,000 people visiting the wheel annually.

<doc id="424381" wikidata="Q1411939" url="?curid=424381" title="Server Side Includes">
<text>Server Side Includes (SSI) is a simple interpreted server-side scripting language used almost exclusively for the World Wide Web. It is most useful for including the contents of one or more files into a web page on a web server (see below), using its codice_1 directive. This could commonly be a common piece of code throughout a site, such as a page header, a page footer and a navigation menu. SSI also contains control directives for conditional features and directives for calling external programs. It is supported by Apache, LiteSpeed, nginx, IIS as well as W3C&#x27;s Jigsaw. It has its roots in NCSA HTTPd.

In order for a web server to recognize an SSI-enabled HTML file and therefore carry out these instructions, either the filename should end with a special extension, by default codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, or, if the server is configured to allow this, set the execution bit of the file.

== Design ==
As a simple programming language, SSI supports only one type: text. Its control flow is rather simple, choice is supported, but loops are not natively supported and can only be done by recursion using include or using HTTP redirect. The simple design of the language makes it easier to learn and use than most server-side scripting languages, while complicated server-side processing is often done with one of the more feature-rich programming languages. SSI is Turing complete.

SSI has a simple syntax: codice_5. Directives are placed in HTML comments so that if SSI is not enabled, users will not see the SSI directives on the page, unless they look at its source. Note that the syntax does not allow spaces between the leading &quot;&lt;!--&quot; and the directive. Apache tutorial on SSI stipulates the format requires a space character before the &quot;--&gt;&quot; that closes the element.

== Examples ==
A web page containing a daily quotation could include the quotation by placing the following code into the file of the web page:

&lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;../quote.txt&quot; --&gt;

With one change of the codice_6 file, all pages that include the file will display the latest daily quotation. The inclusion is not limited to files, and may also be the text output from a program, or the value of a system variable such as the current time.

== Directives ==
=== Common ===
The following are SSI directives from the times of NCSA HTTPd (the 1990s). Some implementations do not support all of them.
=== Control directives ===
Control directives are later added to SSI. They include the ubiquitous if-elif-else-endif flow control and variable writing as well as more exotic features like loops only found in some implementations.

<doc id="424386" wikidata="Q359536" url="?curid=424386" title="J. G. Strijdom">
<text>Johannes Gerhardus Strijdom (also spelled Strydom in accordance with Afrikaans spelling; 14 July 1893 – 24 August 1958), also known as Hans Strijdom and nicknamed the Lion of the North or the Lion of Waterberg, was a South African politician and the fifth prime minister of South Africa from 30 November 1954 to his death on 24 August 1958. He was an uncompromising Afrikaner nationalist and a member of the largest, &quot;baasskap&quot; (white supremacist) faction of the National Party (NP), who further accentuated the NP&#x27;s apartheid policies and break with the Union of South Africa in favour of a republic during his rule.

==Early life==

He was born on the family farm of Klipfontein near Willowmore in the Cape Colony and trained as a lawyer at Victoria College (which later became the University of Stellenbosch) and the University of Pretoria.

His father Petrus Strijdom was a very well-known farmer and innovator in the Baviaanskloof where Strijdom was born. He owned three farms in the kloof of which the main farm was Zandvlakte on which the local school, church and shop was sited. He owned businesses and shops right down to the Gamtoos valley (birthplace of the well-known Khoi woman Saartjie Baartman). He also sold baboon fur and manufactured shoes and soap amongst other products.

Strijdom served in the German South West Africa campaign during World War I, as a member of the South African Medical Corps and, later, of Helgaardt&#x27;s Scouts, where he reached the rank of corporal.

Strijdom later settled in Nylstroom, Transvaal. He identified strongly with this area and its people and became a local community leader amongst the Afrikaners. In 1929, Strijdom was elected to the House of Assembly as MP for Waterberg, representing the National Party (NP) headed by General J.B.M. Hertzog. Strijdom was also leader of the NP in Transvaal, by far the most important province of South Africa, and as such had a strong power base.

After the National Party of J.B.M. Hertzog merged with the South African Party of General Jan Smuts and formed the United Party (UP) during the World Economic Crisis in 1932, Strijdom was part of the break-away faction of the National Party, named the &quot;Gesuiwerde Nasionale Party&quot; (Purified National Party). Later, after the United Party was formed, the GNP became known as the (Reunited) National Party under the leadership of D. F. Malan. Malan, Strijdom and their followers distrusted Smuts and opposed his pro-British policy. Most of the National Party&#x27;s MPs stayed with Hertzog, and as Strijdom was loyal to Malan, he was the only MP from Transvaal to support Malan&#x27;s ideals.

Strijdom favoured the establishment of a republic, allegedly with himself as the first President of South Africa, but due to political controversy this step was not achieved until 1961, after his death, and then only with Governor-General Charles Swart assuming the position of symbolic State President over a Westminster system, as opposed to the executive presidency of the Boer Republics.

==Apartheid era==

After the surprising victory of the National Party in 1948, won on a programme of implementing apartheid involving strict ethnic segregation and White minority rule, Malan became Prime Minister of South Africa and Strijdom became Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation. Although it was not one of the classic portfolios, it was apparently Strijdom&#x27;s choice since he had a keen interest in agriculture and was a part-time farmer. Malan gave him the portfolio because his young wife disliked Strijdom. Malan tried his best to ensure the more moderate Nicolaas Havenga succeeded him as prime minister, rather than Strijdom.

===Prime minister===

On 30 November 1954, Strijdom was elected leader of the National Party and thus the Prime Minister of South Africa after the resignation of Malan and against the latter&#x27;s will; Malan had preferred the more moderate Havenga, Minister of Finance, as his successor. However, Strijdom was popular among NP party members and people trusted him to push things smoothly forward towards a republic, something Malan was considered to be only lukewarm about as it would enrage the United Kingdom and jeopardise South Africa&#x27;s international standing. During Strijdom&#x27;s term as prime minister, he began moves to sever ties with the British monarchy, and deepened the Afrikaner ascendency in South Africa, while strengthening the policy of apartheid, including through the Group Areas Development Act.

With regard to racial policies, he believed strongly in the perpetuation of White minority and thus Afrikaner rule through the removal of Cape Coloured voters from the common voters roll and put on a separate Coloured voters roll electing separate (White) representatives, which Malan initiated but could not push through, and was only accomplished in 1960, under Strijdom&#x27;s successor. Strijdom was an open proponent of crude &quot;baasskap&quot; (white supremacy or white domination). The extended Treason Trial of 156 activists (including Nelson Mandela) involved in the Freedom Charter, happened during Strijdom&#x27;s term in office. He also managed to further extend the NP&#x27;s parliamentary seats during the general election in 1958. Strijdom&#x27;s government also severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The Suez Crisis gave a geopolitical victory, as closure of the passage through the war-ridden Suez Canal made Western oil transports dependent upon the Cape of Good Hope and thus the goodwill of the South African Navy, making the question of the regime&#x27;s survival less precarious.

During his last year in office, Strijdom&#x27;s weak health led to long terms of absence. He died on 24 August 1958 in Cape Town and was succeeded by Hendrik Verwoerd as head of the NP, securing the radical faction&#x27;s drive towards a complete break with Britain and abolition of the Union in 1961. Strijdom is interred in the Heroes&#x27; Acre, a cemetery in Pretoria.

==Personal life==
Strijdom was nicknamed &quot;The Lion of the North&quot;, because of his aggression and forthrightness.

Strijdom married the actress Margaretha van Hulsteyn in 1924, but they divorced within a year. His second wife was Susan de Klerk, aunt of future president F W de Klerk. She bore Strijdom two children: Johannes and Estelle. His widow Susan died in 1999 and daughter Estelle (Crowson), in 2009.

==Legacy==

There are still various monuments dedicated to Strijdom in South Africa. One monument in central Pretoria, which featured his bust, collapsed in 2001 injuring two people. In 2012, the city of Pretoria renamed 27 streets, which included renaming a street named after Strijdom (the M10) to a new name in honor of Solomon Mahlangu. His house in Modimolle (formerly Nylstroom) is now a museum, which holds parts of the collapsed bust.

In Johannesburg, there is a suburb and a street named after Strijdom, although the spelling &quot;Strydom&quot; is also used, even if a couple have already been renamed, one being Malibongwe Drive. In Weltevredenpark, a suburb of Roodepoort, there is a street named JG Strydom Road. Randburg also has a business district called Strijdompark named after him.

The Hillbrow Tower in Johannesburg was officially named the J.G. Strijdom Tower until 1995, when, shortly after the end of apartheid, it was renamed the Telkom Hillbrow Tower.

In Windhoek, then in South West Africa, the main airport was named J.G. Strijdom Airport following its opening in 1965. Following the country&#x27;s independence as Namibia in 1990, it was renamed Hosea Kutako International Airport. And next to Hoedspruit there is a tunnel named after him called J.G Strijdom Tunnel next to the village called Leboeng.

<text>The year 1820 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events, listed below.
==Astronomy==
* March 10 – Astronomical Society of London is founded.
* October 20 – Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, is founded.

==Biology==
* Christian Friedrich Nasse formulates Nasse&#x27;s law: hemophilia occurs only in males and is transmitted by asymptomatic females.
* Ground is set aside for establishment of the United States Botanic Garden in Washington, D.C.

==Chemistry==
* May – John Herapath draws up a partial account of the kinetic theory of gases.
* Joseph Bienaimé Caventou and Pierre Joseph Pelletier isolate the alkaloids cinchonine and quinine from &quot;Cinchona&quot; bark.
* Solanine is first isolated from the berries of the European black nightshade (&quot;Solanum nigrum&quot;).
* Friedrich Accum&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons&quot; is published in London.

==Computing==
* Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar makes his &quot;Arithmometer&quot;, the first mass-produced calculator.

==Exploration==
* January 27 (NS) – The Antarctic ice sheet is sighted for the first time by Imperial Russian Navy captain Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen.
* January 30 – Antarctica is sighted for the second time by Irish-born British Royal Navy captain Edward Bransfield in the &quot;Williams&quot;.
* July – Botanist Edwin James becomes the first recorded person to reach the summit of Pikes Peak in Colorado.
* November 17 – Antarctica is sighted for the third time by United States seal hunter Nathaniel Palmer.

==Geology==
* May – The Geological Society publishes a &quot;Geological Map of England &amp; Wales&quot; by G. B. Greenough (dated 1819) as an alternative to William Smith&#x27;s famous geological map of 1815. Greenough&#x27;s map is produced from a collaborative effort that is skilfully edited and generally acknowledged to be more accurate than Smith&#x27;s.

==Physics==
* April – Hans Christian Ørsted discovers the relationship between electricity and magnetism.
* Laws of electrodynamics are established by André-Marie Ampère.
* Jean-Baptiste Biot and Félix Savart demonstrate the Biot–Savart law in electromagnetism.

==Technology==
* July 26 – Opening of Union Chain Bridge across the River Tweed between England and Scotland, designed by Captain Samuel Brown. Its span of 449 ft (137 metres) is the longest in the Western world at this time, and it is the first wrought iron vehicular suspension bridge of its type in Britain.
* English inventor Thomas Hancock patents the production of fastenings using rubberized fabrics and invents the &quot;pickling machine&quot; (masticator) for recycling rubber scraps.
* French engineer Jean-Victor Poncelet develops an inward-flow water turbine.

==Awards==
* Copley Medal – Hans Christian Ørsted

==Births==

<doc id="424391" wikidata="Q653518" url="?curid=424391" title="Stardust Memories">
<text>Stardust Memories is a 1980 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Woody Allen, who stars alongside Charlotte Rampling, Jessica Harper, Marie-Christine Barrault, and Tony Roberts. Sharon Stone has a brief role, in her film debut. It follows a filmmaker who recalls his life and his loves—the inspirations for his films—while attending a retrospective of his work. The film is shot in black and white and is reminiscent of Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; (1963), which it parodies.

&quot;Stardust Memories&quot; was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screenplay, but was not warmly received by critics on its original release, and is not among the most renowned works in Allen&#x27;s filmography. The film has nonetheless been re-evaluated to some extent, with modern reception more often positive than negative. Allen, who denies that the work is autobiographical and has expressed regret that audiences interpreted it as such, has cited &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; as one of his own favorite films.

==Plot==
Sandy Bates is a director of comedy films. His latest film ends with a surreal sequence in which a character (played by Sandy) is trapped on a train carriage surrounded by grotesque and unhappy figures. The character looks out the carriage window and sees another train filled with beautiful and happy people. Convinced he is on the wrong train, he tries unsuccessfully to get off the train before it speeds away. In the next scene, all the characters from the train wander aimlessly through an immense garbage dump. Sandy&#x27;s character sees that the passengers from the other train have also ended up at the dump. Studio executives, having watched Sandy&#x27;s film, complain that it is uncommercial and depressing. When this is conveyed to Sandy, he insists that he no longer wants to make shallow comedy films, as this no longer feels honest to him.

Sandy&#x27;s managers remind him that he is scheduled to appear at a weekend-long retrospective of his films at the Stardust Hotel on the Jersey Shore. He is reluctant but agrees to attend. Through the weekend, Sandy is haunted by memories of Dorrie, a former lover with mental illness issues. He recalls his first meeting with Dorrie on the set of one of his films, the blossoming of their relationship, and its later deterioration through a combination of her insecurities and his philandering. His last meeting with Dorrie takes place in a psychiatric hospital, where she is depressed and heavily medicated.

Arriving at the Stardust Hotel, Sandy is swamped by fans, who often make bizarre or comical requests from him. He attends screenings of his films, and then submits to question and answer sessions. After the first session, he is invited to a nearby club by a young couple, Jack and Daisy, and he eagerly agrees. At the nightclub, Sandy uses an instance of Jack&#x27;s absence to openly flirt with Daisy.

The following day, Sandy&#x27;s current lover Isobel, a married mother of two, arrives at the hotel to join him. She announces that she has left her husband. Sandy responds ambivalently to this news, but considers taking their relationship to the next level. Sandy also meets with executives from his film studio, who have reshot the ending of his film, with the characters ending up in &quot;jazz heaven&quot;, instead of the garbage dump. Sandy declares the idea to be idiotic, and refuses to accept it.

While talking with his agent on a public phone, Sandy overhears Daisy talking about her sexual ambivalence towards Jack. Later, Sandy organizes an outing alone with Daisy. While the two are together, Sandy&#x27;s car breaks down and they are forced to continue on foot. They arrive at a large field, where they encounter a congregation of locals awaiting the appearance of flying saucers. During this encounter, Sandy begins losing touch with reality, imagining or hallucinating various figures from his life and films, as well as a group of extraterrestrials (who advise him to continue making comedies). He finally imagines a psychotic fan who shoots him dead.

Actually having fainted in a panic attack, Sandy fantasizes that he is given a posthumous award for his life&#x27;s work. He accepts the award in person, and tells the audience that the one moment in his life where he felt truly happy and fulfilled was on a sunny morning in his Manhattan apartment, passing the time with Dorrie, reading and listening to Louis Armstrong&#x27;s version of &quot;Stardust&quot;. As Sandy awakes from his fainting spell, he speaks Dorrie&#x27;s name, which angers Isobel, who has been waiting by his bedside. She attempts to break up with him, prompting him to abandon the retrospective and follow her onto her train. He passionately persuades her to forgive him, and they kiss as the train departs.

These events are observed by a film audience, which includes many figures who appear as characters in the film itself. As this film ends, they discuss its merits and flaws, and share their experiences of making it. As the audience departs the theater, a figure resembling Sandy enters, retrieves his iconic sunglasses from a seat, and then exits.

==Cast==
==Themes==
Allen has asserted that &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; is not an autobiographical work. &quot;[Critics] thought that the lead character was &quot;me&quot;!&quot;, the director is quoted as saying in &quot;Woody Allen on Woody Allen&quot;. &quot;Not a fictional character, but me, and that I was expressing hostility toward my audience. ... [T]hat was in no way the point of the film. It was about a character who is obviously having a sort of nervous breakdown and in spite of success has come to a point in his life where he is having a bad time.&quot;

The conflict between the maternal, nurturing woman and the earnest, usually younger one, is a recurring theme in Allen&#x27;s films. Like many of Allen&#x27;s films, &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; incorporates several jazz recordings including those by such notables as Louis Armstrong, Django Reinhardt, and Chick Webb. The film&#x27;s title alludes to the famous take of &quot;Stardust&quot; recorded in 1931 by Armstrong, wherein the trumpeter sings &quot;oh, memory&quot; three times in succession. However, it is the master take that plays in the movie during the sequence where Sandy is remembering the best moment of his life: looking at Dorrie while listening to Armstrong&#x27;s recording of the song.

The film deals with issues regarding religion, God, and philosophy; especially existentialism, psychology, symbolism, wars and politics. It is also about realism, relationships, and death. It refers to many questions about the meaning of life. It also ruminates on the role that luck plays in life, a theme Allen would revisit in &quot;Match Point&quot;.

==Production==
Filming locations include:
* Asbury Park, New Jersey
* Bradley Beach, New Jersey
* Ocean Grove, New Jersey

From the sleeve notes of MGM&#x27;s 2000 DVD release: &quot;Shot on location in the fall of 1979, &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; may look as though it takes place in a Victorian-style seaside hotel, but it was actually shot at the Ocean Grove Great Auditorium and the Methodist Episcopal Conference Center and Concert Hall in New Jersey. Most of the interiors, including the bedroom scenes, were shot in a vacant Sears Roebuck building, but the crew also recreated a vintage train at Filmways Studio in Harlem. To reproduce the movement of a rail car, the whole train was mounted on jacks and gently jostled back and forth.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Stardust Memories&quot; opened in North America on September 26, 1980. On its opening weekend, the film grossed $326,779 from 29 theaters, averaging $11,268 per screen. It grossed $10,389,003 in the United States and Canada by the end of its run, against a production budget of $10 million.

===Critical response===
In Diane Jacobs&#x27; &quot;But We Need the Eggs: The Magic of Woody Allen&quot;, the director is quoted as saying: &quot;[S]hortly after &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; opened, John Lennon was shot by the very guy who had asked him for his autograph earlier in the day. ... This is what happens with celebrities—one day people love you, the next day they want to kill you.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 66% based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Woody Allen throws himself a pity party with all the surrealistic trimmings of Federico Fellini in &quot;Stardust Memories&quot;, a scabrous self-portrait that rankles as often as it impresses stylisticly.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the work &quot;is [Allen&#x27;s] most provocative film thus far and perhaps his most revealing&quot; and certainly &quot;the one that will inspire the most heated debate&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two stars out of four and called it &quot;a disappointment. It needs some larger idea, some sort of organizing force, to pull together all these scenes of bitching and moaning, and make them lead somewhere.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and suggested that Allen &quot;seems to have run out of creative gas. The film doesn&#x27;t have much of a premise.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;has no dramatic shape or resonance, and the incidental laughs are few and far between.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was positive, calling the film &quot;both extremely funny and extremely affecting ... Allen&#x27;s growth as an actor and as a filmmaker in confident command of his medium is one of the several remarkable readouts from this film.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;In &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; we get more of the same thoughts over and over—it&#x27;s like watching a loop. The material is fractured and the scenes are very short, but there was not a single one that I was sorry to see end. &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem like a movie, or even like a filmed essay; it&#x27;s nothing.&quot;

In a joint article, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; film critics Robbie Collin and Tim Robey listed it as Allen&#x27;s 10th greatest film and wrote; &quot;slammed at the time, it&#x27;s a retrospective knock-out, thanks to its ambitious structure, vinegary gags and the searing monochrome photography, courtesy of Gordon Willis&quot;. Sam Fragoso of IndieWire also ranked it among Allen&#x27;s best works, lauding it as &quot;an extraordinarily realized portrait of artistic stagnation&quot;. The film was listed 16th among Allen&#x27;s efforts in a poll of &quot;Time Out&quot; contributors, with editor Joshua Rothkopf praising it as &quot;a piece of self-referential hilarity in its own right.&quot;

In October 2013, &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; was voted by &quot;The Guardian&quot; readers as the eighth best film directed by Allen.

<doc id="424398" wikidata="Q60208" url="?curid=424398" title="Karl Korsch">
<text>Karl Korsch (; August 15, 1886 – October 21, 1961) was a German Marxist theoretician and political philosopher. He is recognized as one of the &quot;dissidents&quot; that challenged the Marxism of the Second International of Karl Kautsky, Georgi Plekhanov and Lenin. Along with György Lukács, Korsch is considered to be one of the major figures responsible for laying the groundwork for Western Marxism in the 1920s.

==Early years==
Karl Korsch was born in the small rural village of Tostedt (near Hamburg) to Lutheran parents, Carl August Korsch and his wife Therese (&quot;née&quot; Raikowski) on August 15, 1886. Although Karl&#x27;s father worked as a secretary in a city hall bureau, he was deeply devoted to studying the philosophy of Leibniz in his private life. He wrote an unpublished book covering the development of Leibnitz&#x27;s theories of the monads. Longing for a more urban and intellectual life, Carl August made the decision to relocate his family west, to a village just outside Meiningen in the Thuringen region, when Karl was eleven years old. The move not only allowed the elder Korsch to obtain employment at a local bank (where he eventually rose to the position of vice president), it also gave his children the opportunity to receive a better education. Karl, who showed great intellectual promise at a young age, excelled as a student during his years of schooling at Meiningen.

Beginning in 1906, Korsch successively attended universities in Munich, Geneva, and Berlin, studying various subjects such as philosophy and humanities in preparation for a more concentrated study in the field of law. Korsch then entered the University of Jena (incidentally, the same university that awarded Karl Marx his doctorate in philosophy in 1841) to begin working on his law degree in 1908. When he was not occupied with his studies, Korsch was extremely active in the &quot;Freie Studenten&quot;, a left-of-center student group which pushed for further liberalization of the school&#x27;s code of behavior. Korsch also found time to become editor of the student newspaper, to which he also contributed articles. In addition, Korsch organized and participated in lectures that featured prominent socialist speakers such as Eduard Bernstein and Karl Liebknecht. The extent of his extracurricular activities did not seem to have the slightest detrimental effect on Korsch&#x27;s academic performance since he managed to earn his doctor of law from the University of Jena&#x27;s in 1910. His thesis title was &quot;Die Anwendung der Beweislastregeln im Zivilprozess und das qualifizierte Geständnis&quot; (The application of the burden of proof in civil cases and the qualified confession). It was around this time that Korsch met Hedda Gagliardi, whom he would eventually marry in 1913.

==First World War==
Korsch received a grant in 1912 to travel to England and work on translating and writing a commentary to a legal text by Sir Ernest Schuster. During this time, Korsch became a member of the Fabian Society, a reformist socialist organization. In 1913 he married Hedda Gagliardi, who came from a bourgeois family. She was a grandchild of feminist Hedwig Dohm, who would be closely involved in his theoretical work. Hedda Korsch from 1916 was a teacher at the Wickersdorf Free School Community. Korsch&#x27;s stay in England came to an end in the summer of 1914 when he received orders to report to his military regiment at Meiningen for maneuvers. Despite being opposed to a war that he knew was on the horizon, Korsch nevertheless made the decision to return to his native country because in the words of his wife: “He wanted to be with the masses, and they would be in the army.” At the start of the war, Korsch initially held the rank of lieutenant but was quickly demoted to sergeant for daring to voice his objections to the German Army&#x27;s invasion of neutral Belgium. However, these disciplinary measures did little to shake Korsch of his pacifist convictions; throughout the war, he refused to carry any sort of weapon into battle. According to Hedda Korsch, Karl&#x27;s rationale for going into combat unarmed was “that it made no difference, since you were just as safe with or without a weapon: the point was that you were safe neither way.” Instead of fighting, Korsch made it his personal mission to save as many lives as he could. As the conflict wore on, Korsch was decorated several times and was even re-promoted to the rank of captain. He was awarded the Iron Cross twice for his bravery under fire. More important than these official accolades, Korsch&#x27;s strong moral character and reputation for bravery under fire helped him garner the respect of many of the men in his company. An account cited that he had to change his North German accent to be understood by the soldiers and the common people.

In 1917, he joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), which had broken away from the Social Democratic Party of Germany over the later&#x27;s support for the war. When widespread unrest began to sweep through the German military in 1917, this company established a soldiers&#x27; soviet with Korsch being elected by his fellow soldiers to serve as one of this soviet&#x27;s delegates. This &quot;red company&quot; was one of the last to be demobilized, a process which occurred in January 1919.

==Political activism in Germany, 1917–1933==
Korsch&#x27;s wartime experiences in Germany had radicalised him, especially the ferment within the leftwing parties of Germany following the Russian Revolution. Korsch focused his studies and writings on working-out a replacement economic system for workers&#x27; councils to implement across Germany, published under the title &quot;What is Socialization?&quot; in March 1919. Korsch was part of the USPD faction which joined the Communist Party of Germany in 1920. This was despite his misgivings about the twenty-one Conditions required for adherence to the Comintern. After an SPD-KPD coalition government was formed in Free State of Thuringia in October 1923, Korsch was appointed Minister of Justice. He served in the Second Frölich Cabinet for 27 days during the German October until President Friedrich Ebert issued a &quot;Reichsexekution&quot;, sending the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; to forcibly dissolve the government. Because he had called for the formation of Proletarian Hundreds, Korsch was forced to temporarily go into hiding.

In February 1924, Korsch was elected to the Landtag of Thuringia, and in July he was elected to the Reichstag in a by-election triggered by the resignation of fellow Communist Hermann Schubert. He was re-elected in December 1924, serving until 1928.

On April 30, 1926, Korsch was expelled from the KPD. Earlier that year, he and Ernst Schwarz had formed the Entschiedene Linke (Determined Left), an opposition faction within the party that had initially attracted 7,000 members. Still retaining his Reichstag seat, he formed the Group of International Communists with two other expelled legislators before joining the Left Communists in November and the Communist Workers Party of Germany in June 1927.

Korsch attributed the failure of the German revolution to the lack of ideological preparation and leadership of the working class. Accordingly, he turned his focus to developing workers&#x27; organisations into bodies subjectively capable of realizing revolutionary opportunities. In contrast to what seemed to him a materialist fatalism, he thought it would be possible to galvanize workers&#x27; organisations into bolder political action if more effort was put into educating workers in the deeper theory of Marxism.

==Exile==

Having been active in left-wing politics in Germany from 1917 to 1933, he left his country of birth on 27 February 1933, the night of the Reichstag fire. At first he stayed in England and Denmark.

===The deaths of Dora Fabian and Mathilde Wurm===
The bodies of Dora Fabian and Mathilde Wurm were found in a locked bedroom in London on 4 April 1935. In the subsequent coroner&#x27;s inquest Korsch was to play a significant role. Fabian had been working with Dr. (Anton) Roy Ganz of the Swiss Police to investigate the activities of Hans Wesemann, a former Social Democrat journalist who had become a Nazi agent. In fact Korsch had attended an interview with Ganz at which Inspector Jempson of the Special Branch had been present, but without Korsch being aware of his identity. Korsch later claimed that Ganz had encouraged him to reveal his revolutionary sentiments in front of the policeman and suggested that this was a factor in the expulsion of Korsch from Britain a few months later.

===Life in the United States===
In 1936, he settled in the United States with his wife, teaching at Tulane University, New Orleans, and working at the International Institute for Social Research, New York City. Korsch died in Belmont, Massachusetts, on October 21, 1961.

In his later work, he rejected orthodox Marxism as historically outmoded, wanted to adapt Marxism to a new historical situation, and wrote in his &quot;Ten Theses&quot; (1950) that &quot;the first step in re-establishing a revolutionary theory and practice consists in breaking with that Marxism which claims to monopolize revolutionary initiative as well as theoretical and practical direction&quot; and that &quot;today, all attempts to re-establish the Marxist doctrine as a whole in its original function as a theory of the working classes social revolution are reactionary utopias.&quot;

==Philosophical work==
Korsch was especially concerned that Marxist theory was losing its precision and validity – in the words of the day, becoming &quot;vulgarized&quot; – within the upper echelons of the various socialist organizations. His masterwork, &quot;Marxism and Philosophy&quot;, is an attempt to re-establish the historic character of Marxism as the heir to Hegel. It commences with a quote from Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s &quot;On the Significance of Militant Materialism&quot;: &quot;We must organize a systematic study of the Hegelian dialectic from a materialist standpoint.&quot; Korsch&#x27;s critique of the traditional bourgeois concept of progress in his work &quot;Karl Marx&quot; stressed that the development of material productive sources is not a natural result or a result of independent economic evolution and can be changed by man. He maintained that the revolutionary transformation of the mode of production and labor is essential to realize a proletarian revolution.

In Korsch&#x27;s formulation, Hegel represented at the level of ideas the real, material progressiveness of the bourgeoisie. Alongside the extinction of &#x27;Hegelianism&#x27; around 1848, the bourgeoisie lost its claim to that progressive role in society, ceasing to be the universal class. Marx, in taking Hegel and transforming that philosophy into something new, in which the workers would be the progressive class, himself represented the moment at which the revolutionary baton materially passed from bourgeoisie to workers. To Korsch, the central idea of Marxian theory was what he termed &quot;the principle of historical specification&quot;. This means to &quot;comprehend all things social in terms of a definite historical epoch&quot;. (Korsch, &quot;Karl Marx&quot;, p. 24) He emphasizes that Marx &quot;deals with all categories of his economic and socio-historical research in that specific form and in that specific connection in which they appear in modern bourgeois society. He does not treat them as eternal categories.&quot; (op. cit., p. 29f.) He was also noted for claiming that socialism must not confine itself to the &quot;socialization of the means of production&quot; and, instead, construct useful formula for the socialistic organization of the national economy.

Korsch&#x27;s stance had ramifications which were unpalatable to the official Communist Party structure – not least, casting the Party&#x27;s own ideological weaknesses as the only material explanation for the failure of the revolution. Published in 1923, &quot;Marxism and Philosophy&quot; was strongly opposed by Party faithful and other left-wing figures, including Karl Kautsky and Grigory Zinoviev. Zinoviev famously said of Korsch and his fellow critic Lukács, &quot;If we get a few more of these Professors spinning out their theories, we shall be lost.&quot; Over the subsequent five years, the German Communist Party gradually purged all such dissenting voices. Korsch survived within a current known as the Resolute Lefts, until his expulsion in April 1926. He remained a communist deputy to the Reichstag.

==Influence==
Korsch is an oft-neglected figure within twentieth century political theory. While his critique was not accepted into the official Marxist–Leninist doctrine of the Third International, it remained influential amongst communist dissenters and academics for several decades. Within those currents, particularly in Germany, Britain, Hungary and Italy, his influence varies from group to group, but became more significant with the brief revival of revolutionary politics in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Korsch taught and befriended Bertolt Brecht, the Marxian playwright, who said he picked Korsch to instruct him in Marxism due to his independence from the Communist Party. It was through Brecht, moreover, that Korsch made the acquaintance of Walter Benjamin, who had also been active in the &quot;Freie Studenten&quot; and who had attended the Wickersdorf Free School Community, where Korsch&#x27;s wife, Hedda Gagliardi, had been a teacher. Korsch&#x27;s book, &quot;Karl Marx&quot;, which Benjamin read in manuscript form, is cited extensively in the convolute devoted to Marx in the &quot;Arcades Project&quot;. According to Howard Eiland and Michael W. Jennings, the text was “one of Benjamin’s main sources [on]… Marxism,” introduced him “to an advanced understanding of Marxism.

Korsch also instructed Felix Weil, the founder of the Institute for Social Research, from which the highly influential Frankfurt School was to emerge. He also influenced the German Marxist historian Arthur Rosenberg. Indirect disciples include Franz Jakubowski and Nildo Viana. Sidney Hook attended Korsch lectures in Berlin in 1928.

<text>The Aotearoa Music Awards (previously called the New Zealand Music Awards), conferred annually by Recorded Music NZ, honour outstanding artistic and technical achievements in the recording industry. The awards are among the most significant that a group or artist can receive in New Zealand music, and have been presented annually since 1965. The awards show is presented by Recorded Music NZ. A range of award sponsors and media partners support the event each year.

==History and overview==
The first awards for New Zealand recorded music were the Loxene Golden Disc awards, launched in 1965. The awards were created by soap powder manufacturer Reckitt &amp; Colman&#x27;s advertising agency, with support from the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC), the New Zealand Federation of Phonographic Industries and the Australasian Performing Rights Society (APRA), with the awards named after Reckitt &amp; Colman&#x27;s anti-dandruff shampoo, Loxene.

While initially only one prize was given, other awards were added, including categories for record cover, recording artist of the year, and a producer award. From 1970, two awards were given - one to a solo artist, the other to a group however there was still just one supreme award, selected from these two.

The Loxene Golden Disc awards continued until 1972 when the New Zealand Federation of Phonographic Industry decided to institute its own system; these awards became known as the Recording Arts Talent Awards (RATA). From 1978 the awards became known as the RIANZ Awards after the NZFPI changed its name to the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ).

In 1996 and 1997 the awards were merged with the Entertainer of the Year Awards and were known as the Clear Music and Entertainment Awards, sponsored by Clear Communications. From 1998 the awards reverted to music only, with the name going back to the New Zealand Music Awards and the award trophy nicknamed the Tui. Also in 1999 Coca-Cola New Zealand became the naming rights sponsor of the awards, known as the Coca-Cola New Zealand Music Awards for one year only.

Since 2004, the show&#x27;s principal sponsor has been Vodafone New Zealand. With Vodafone&#x27;s sponsorship, the awards became known as the Vodafone New Zealand Music Awards (VNZMA&#x27;s).

In 2008 the awards ceremony moved to Vector Arena in Auckland, New Zealand. Prior to this move the event was primarily invitation only, and the increased size of the Vector Arena enabled the event to be attended both by invitation and by the public through sale tickets. While the Loxene Golden Disc award was televised in the 1970s, broadcasting of the contemporary award ceremony started in 2004.

In 2020, the awards were renamed the Aotearoa Music Awards; its acronym doubly serves to mean a waka&#x27;s outrigger (&quot;ama&quot;) reflecting the award&#x27;s goal of supporting the local music industry.

==New Zealand Music Hall of Fame==

Created in 2007 in conjunction with the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame pays tribute to those who have &quot;shaped, influenced and advanced popular music in New Zealand.&quot; Two musicians or groups are inducted into the hall each year, one at the APRA Silver Scroll Awards, decided by APRA, and the other is the winner of the Legacy Award at the Aotearoa Music Awards, selected by Recorded Music NZ.

==Critics Choice award==

Awarded from 2010 until 2016, the Critics&#x27; Choice Prize was given to artists who were expected to be successful in the music industry in the future. To be eligible for the award, an artist must have neither released a studio album nor have been nominated for a New Zealand Music Award in the past.

<doc id="424400" wikidata="Q23423" url="?curid=424400" title="Battlement">
<text>A battlement, in defensive architecture, such as that of city walls or castles, comprises a parapet (a defensive low wall between chest-height and head-height), in which gaps or indentations, which are often rectangular, occur at intervals to allow for the launch of arrows or other projectiles from within the defences. These gaps are termed [[embrasures]], also called crenels or crenelles, and a wall or building with them is described as ; alternative older terms are and . The act of adding crenels to a previously unbroken parapet is termed crenellation. 

The function of battlements in war is to protect the defenders by giving them part of the parapet to hide behind, from which they can quickly expose themselves to launch projectiles, then retreat behind the parapet. A defensive building might be designed and built with battlements, or a manor house might be fortified by adding battlements, where no parapet previously existed, or cutting crenellations into its existing parapet wall. A distinctive feature of late medieval English church architecture is to crenellate the tops of church towers, and often the tops of lower walls. These are essentially decorative rather than functional, as are many examples on secular buildings.

The solid widths between the crenels are called merlons. Battlements on walls have protected walkways, termed chemin de ronde behind them. On tower or building tops, the often flat roof is used as a protected fighting platform.

==Etymology==
The term originated in about the 14th century from the Old French word &#x27;, &quot;to fortify with &quot;batailles&quot;&quot; (fixed or movable turrets of defence). The word &quot;crenel&quot; derives from the ancient French &#x27; (modern French &#x27;), Latin &#x27;, meaning a notch, mortice or other gap cut out often to receive another element or fixing; see also crenation. The modern French word for crenel is &quot;&quot;, also used to describe a gap of any kind, for example a parking space at the side of the road between two cars, interval between groups of marching troops or a timeslot in a broadcast.

==Licence to crenellate==

In medieval England and Wales a licence to crenellate granted the holder permission to fortify their property. Such licences were granted by the king, and by the rulers of the counties palatine within their jurisdictions, e.g. by the Bishops of Durham and the Earls of Chester and after 1351 by the Dukes of Lancaster. The castles in England vastly outnumbered the licences to crenellate. Royal pardons were obtainable on the payment of an arbitrarily-determined fine by a person who had fortified without licence. The surviving records of such licences, generally issued by letters patent, provide valuable evidence for the dating of ancient buildings. A list of licences issued by the English Crown between the 12th and the 16th centuries was compiled by Turner &amp; Parker and expanded and corrected by Philip Davis and published in &quot;The Castle Studies Group Journal&quot;.

There has been academic debate over the purpose of licensing. The view of military-focused historians is that licensing restricted the number of fortifications that could be used against a royal army. The modern view, proposed notably by Charles Coulson, is that battlements became an architectural status-symbol much sought after by the socially ambitious, in Coulson&#x27;s words: &quot;Licences to crenellate were mainly symbolic representations of lordly status: castellation was the architectural expression of noble rank&quot;. They indicated to the observer that the grantee had obtained &quot;royal recognition, acknowledgment and compliment&quot;. They could, however, provide a basic deterrent against wandering bands of thieves, and it is suggested that the function of battlements was comparable to the modern practice of householders fitting highly visible CC
TV and burglar alarms, often merely dummies. The crown usually did not charge for the granting of such licences, but occasionally charged a fee of about half a mark.

==Machicolations==

Battlements may be stepped out to overhang the wall below, and may have openings at their bases between the supporting corbels, through which stones or burning objects could be dropped onto attackers or besiegers; these are known as machicolations.

==History==

Battlements have been used for thousands of years; the earliest known example is in the fortress at Buhen in Egypt. Battlements were used in the walls surrounding Assyrian towns, as shown on &quot;bas reliefs&quot; from Nimrud and elsewhere. Traces of them remain at Mycenae in Greece, and some ancient Greek vases suggest the existence of battlements. The Great Wall of China has battlements.

==Development==

In the European battlements of the Middle Ages the crenel comprised one-third of the width of the merlon: the latter, in addition, could be provided with arrow-loops of various shapes (from simply round to cruciform), depending on the weapon being utilized. Late merlons permitted fire from the first firearms. From the 13th century, the merlons could be connected with wooden shutters (mantlets) that provided added protection when closed. The shutters were designed to be opened to allow shooters to fire against the attackers, and closed during reloading.

==Ancient Rome==
The Romans used low wooden pinnacles for their first &quot;aggeres&quot; (terrepleins). In the battlements of Pompeii, additional protection derived from small internal buttresses or spur walls, against which the defender might stand so as to gain complete protection on one side.

==Italy==

Loop-holes were frequent in Italian battlements, where the merlon has much greater height and a distinctive cap. Italian military architects used the so-called Ghibelline or &quot;swallowtail&quot; battlement, with V-shaped notches in the tops of the merlon, giving a horn-like effect. This would allow the defender to be protected whilst shooting standing fully upright. The normal rectangular merlons were later nicknamed Guelph.

==Indian subcontinent==

Many South Asian battlements are made up of parapets with peculiarly shaped merlons and complicated systems of loopholes, which differ substantially from rest of the world. Typical Indian merlons were semicircular and pointed at the top, although they could sometimes be fake: the parapet may be solid and the merlons shown in relief on the outside, as is the case in Chittorgarh. Loopholes could be made both in the merlons themselves, and under the crenels. They could either look forward (to command distant approaches) or downward (to command the foot of the wall). Sometimes a merlon was pierced with two or three loopholes, but typically, only one loophole was divided into two or three slits by horizontal or vertical partitions. The shape of loopholes, as well as the shape of merlons, need not have been the same everywhere in the castle, as shown by Kumbhalgarh.

==Middle East and Africa==
In Muslim and African fortifications, the merlons often were rounded. The battlements of the Arabs had a more decorative and varied character, and were continued from the 13th century onwards not so much for defensive purposes as for a crowning feature to the walls. They serve a function similar to the cresting found in the Spanish Renaissance architecture.

==Ireland==
&quot;Irish&quot; crenellations are a distinctive form that appeared in Ireland between the 14th and 17th centuries. These were battlements of a &quot;stepped&quot; form, with each merlon shaped like an inverted &#x27;T&#x27;.

==Decorative element==

European architects persistently used battlements as a purely decorative feature throughout the Decorated and Perpendicular periods of Gothic architecture. They not only occur on parapets but on the transoms of windows and on the tie-beams of roofs and on screens, and even on Tudor chimney-pots. A further decorative treatment appears in the elaborate paneling of the merlons and that portion of the parapet walls rising above the cornice, by the introduction of quatrefoils and other conventional forms filled with foliage and shield.

<text>Free-market environmentalism argues that the free market, property rights, and tort law provide the best means of preserving the environment, internalizing pollution costs, and conserving resources.

Free-market environmentalists therefore argue that the best way to protect the environment is to clarify and protect property rights. This allows parties to negotiate improvements in environmental quality. It also allows them to use torts to stop environmental harm. If affected parties can compel polluters to compensate them they will reduce or eliminate the externality. Market proponents advocate changes to the legal system that empower affected parties to obtain such compensation. They further claim that governments have limited affected parties&#x27; ability to do so by complicating the tort system to benefit producers over others.

==Tenets==
While environmental problems may be viewed as market failures, free market environmentalists argue that environmental problems arise because:

# The state encodes, provides and enforces laws which override or obscure property rights and thus fail to protect them adequately.
# Given the technological and legal context in which people operate, transaction costs are too high to allow parties to negotiate to a solution better for the environment.
# Laws governing class or individual tort claims provide polluters with immunity from tort claims, or interfere with those claims in such a way as to make it difficult to legally sustain them.

Though many environmentalists blame markets for many of today&#x27;s environmental problems, free-market environmentalists blame many of these problems on distortions of the market and the lack of markets. Government actions are blamed for a number of environmental detriments.
* A misunderstanding of the tragedy of the commons, which is seen as a fundamental problem for the environment. When land is held in common, anybody may use it. Since resources are consumable, this creates the incentive for entrepreneurs to use common resources before somebody else does. Many environmental resources are held by the government or in common, such as air, water, forests. A claimed problem with regulation is that it puts property into a political commons, where individuals try to appropriate public resources for their own gain, a phenomenon called rent-seeking.
* Tenure – Renters do not benefit from value accrued during their tenure and thus face an incentive to extract as much value as possible without conservation.
* Political allocation – Political information does not have the incentives that markets do to seek superior information (profit and loss). Though many participants provide input to governments, they can only make one decision. This means that governments create rules that are not well crafted for local situations. The government&#x27;s strategy is that of anticipation, to hide from danger through regulations. A healthier society would use resilience, facing and overcoming risks.
* Perverse subsidies – Governments offer cross subsidies that distort price systems. This means that underconsumers and overconsumers are paying the same rates, so the underconsumer is overpaying and the overconsumer is underpaying. The incentive leads to more overconsumers and fewer underconsumers.
* Increased transaction costs – Governments may create rules that make it difficult to transfer rights in ways that benefit the environment. For example, in the western United States, many states have laws over water rights that make it difficult for environmental groups to purchase in-stream flows from farmers.

==Market tools==
Markets are not perfect, and free-market environmentalists assert that market-based solutions will have their mistakes. Through strong feedback mechanisms such as risk, profit and loss, market-driven have strong incentives to learn from mistakes.
* Individual choice – Consumers have the incentive to maximize their satisfaction and try to find low cost, high value options. Markets allocate resources to the highest bidder. Producers make purchases on behalf of the consumer. Due to many actors in the market, there is no one-size-fits-all solution and entrepreneurs will seek to fulfill many values of society, including conservation.
* Entrepreneurship – Entrepreneurs seek value, problem-solve, and coordinate resources.
* Price system – When resources become scarce, prices rise. Rising prices incentivize entrepreneurs to find substitutions for these resources. These resources are often conserved. E.g. as prices for coal rise, consumers will use less and higher prices will drive substitution for different energy sources.
* Property rights – Owners face a strong incentive to take care of and protect their property. They must decide how much to use today and how much to use tomorrow. Everybody is trying to grow value. Corporate value and share price is based on their anticipated future profits. Owners with the possibility of transferring their property, either to an heir or through sale want their property to grow in value. Property rights encourage conservation and defend resources against depletion, since there is a strong incentive to maximize the value of the resource for the future.
* Common law – In order to have working property rights, you need a good system to defend them. When rights are weak, people will violate them. By creating a strong system, where common resources can be homesteaded, transferred, and defended against harm, resources can be protected, managed, allocated with the results that aggregate and balance humanity&#x27;s needs and wants.

The market is a non-political allocation device. Many environmentalists proposals call to return resources from markets to become political problems.

==Issues==

===Coasian bargaining===

Some economists argue that, if industries internalized the costs of negative externalities, they would face an incentive to reduce them, perhaps even becoming enthusiastic about taking advantage of opportunities to improve profitability through lower costs. Moreover, economists claim this would lead to the optimal balance between the marginal benefits of pursuing an activity and the marginal cost of its environmental consequences. One well-known means of internalizing a negative consequence is to establish a property right over some phenomenon formerly in the public domain.

The Coase theorem is one extreme version of this logic. If property rights are well defined and if there are no transaction costs, then market participants can negotiate to a solution that internalizes the externality. Moreover, this solution will not depend on who is allocated the property right. For example, a paper mill and a resort might be on the same lake. Suppose the benefits to the resort of a clean lake outweigh the benefits to the mill of being able to pollute. If the mill has the right to pollute, the resort will pay it not to. If the resort has the right to a pollution-free lake, it will keep that right, as the mill will be unable to compensate it for its pollution. However, critics have charged that the &quot;theorem&quot; attributed to Coase is of extremely limited practicability because of its assumptions, including no transaction costs, and is ill-suited to real world externalities which have high bargaining costs due to many factors.

More generally, free-market environmentalists argue that transaction costs &quot;count&quot; as real costs. If the cost of re-allocating property rights exceeds the benefits of doing so, then it is actually optimal to stay in the status quo. This means the initial allocation of property rights is not neutral and also that it has important implications for efficiency. Nevertheless, given the existing property rights regime, costly changes to it are not necessarily efficient, even if in hindsight an alternative regime would have been better. But if there are opportunities for property rights to evolve, entrepreneurs can find them to create new wealth.

===Geolibertarianism===

Libertarian Georgists (or Geolibertarians) maintain a strong essential commitment to free markets but reject the Coasian solution in favor of land value taxation, wherein the economic rent of land is collected by the community and either equally distributed to adult residents in the form of universal basic income, called the &quot;citizen&#x27;s dividend&quot;, or used to fund necessary functions of a minimal government. Under the LVT system, only landholders are taxed and on the basis of the market value of the earth in its unimproved state, that is to say, apart from the value of any structures or products of human labor. Geolibertarians regard the LVT as just compensation for a legal land title granting exclusive access to that which logically precedes and generates private capital, whose supply is inelastic, which properly belongs to all, and to which all have an equal right because it is vital to human existence and economic activity—the ground itself—and thus consider land value capture both morally imperative and a natural source of revenue.

Taxation of land values has been advocated by many classical economists and theorists of classical liberalism, but this approach was popularized as the &quot;Single Tax&quot; by political economist and public intellectual Henry George in the late 19th century. Geolibertarians generally also support Pigouvian taxes on pollution and fees as compensation for natural resource extraction, negative externalities which adversely affect land values in particular. Many argue the monopolization of land promotes idle land speculation, real estate bubbles, urban sprawl and artificially severe wealth inequality, while violating the Lockean proviso and denying others rightful access to the earth.

===Anarcho-capitalism===

Rothbardian anarcho-capitalists also reject the proposed Coasian solution as making invalid assumptions about the purely subjective notion of costs being measurable in monetary terms, and also of making unexamined and invalid value judgments (i.e., ethical judgments). (Wayback Machine ) The Rothbardians&#x27; solution is to recognize individuals&#x27; Lockean property rights, of which the Rothbardians maintain that &quot;Wertfreiheit&quot; (i.e., value-free) economic analysis demonstrates that this arrangement necessarily maximizes social utility. (Toward a Reconstruction of Utility and Welfare Economics )

Murray Rothbard himself believed the term &quot;free-market environmentalism&quot; to be oxymoronic. On his view the unimproved natural environment, undeveloped and unowned, can in no sense be considered property until it is transformed via Lockean homesteading. Unlike geolibertarians and many classical liberals, however, Rothbard emphatically rejected Locke&#x27;s proviso as inconsistent with his theory of property acquisition. Against environmentalism Rothbard said: &quot;The problem is that environmentalists are not interested in efficiency or preserving private property...The environmentalists are acolytes and prisoners of a monstrous literally anti-human philosophy. They despise and condemn the human race, which by its very nature and in contrast to other creatures, changes and transforms the environment instead of being passively subjected to it...I have come to the conclusion that a &#x27;free-market environmentalist&#x27; is an oxymoron. Scratch one and you get...an environmentalist.&quot;

=== Markets and ecosystems as spontaneous orders ===
Recent arguments in the academic literature have used Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s concept of a spontaneous order to defend a broadly non-interventionist environmental policy. Hayek originally used the concept of a spontaneous order to argue against government intervention in the market. Like the market, ecosystems contain complex networks of information, involve an ongoing dynamic process, contain orders within orders, and the entire system operates without being directed by a conscious mind. On this analysis, species takes the place of price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements. Human ignorance about the countless interactions between the organisms of an ecosystem limits our ability to manipulate nature. Since humans rely on the ecosystem to sustain themselves, it is argued that we have an obligation to not disrupt such systems. This analysis of ecosystems as spontaneous orders does not rely on markets qualifying as spontaneous orders. As such, one need not endorse Hayek&#x27;s analysis of markets to endorse ecosystems as spontaneous orders.

===Others===

Proponents of free-market environmentalism use the example of the recent destruction of the once prosperous Grand Banks fishery off Newfoundland. Once one of the world&#x27;s most abundant fisheries, it has been almost completely depleted of fish. Those primarily responsible were large &quot;factory-fishing&quot; enterprises driven by the imperative to realize profits in a competitive global market. It is contended that if the fishery had been owned by a single entity, the owner would have had an interest in keeping a renewable supply of fish to maintain profits over the long term. The owner would thus have charged high fees to fish in the area, sharply reducing how many fish were caught. The owner also would have closely enforced rules on not catching young fish. Instead commercial ships from around the world raced to get the fish out of the water before competitors could, including catching fish that had not yet reproduced.

Another example is in the 19th century early gold miners in California developed a trade in rights to draw from water courses based on the doctrine of prior appropriation. This was curtailed in 1902 by the Newlands Reclamation Act which introduced subsidies for irrigation projects. This had the effect of sending a signal to farmers that water was inexpensive and abundant, leading to uneconomic use of a scarce resource. Increasing difficulties in meeting demand for water in the western United States have been blamed on the continuing establishment of governmental control and a return to tradable property rights has been proposed.

==Notable free-market environmentalists==
* Terry L. Anderson
* Jonathan H. Adler
* John Baden
* Ralph Borsodi
* Bolton Hall
* Laura Jones (Fraser Institute)
* Gary Libecap
* Preston Manning
* Bruce Yandle

==Notable free-market environmentalist groups==
Organizations support free-market environmentalism:
* Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) (United States)

==Criticisms==
Critics argue that free-market environmentalists have no method of dealing with collective problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of collective regulation and control. They see natural resources as too difficult to privatize (e.g. water), as well as legal responsibility for pollution and degrading biodiversity as too hard to trace.

<text>Tyrannus is a genus of small passerine birds in the tyrant flycatcher family Tyrannidae that are native to the Americas. The majority are named as kingbirds.

==Description==
They prefer semi-open or open areas. These birds wait on an exposed perch and then catch insects in flight. They have long pointed wings and large broad bills. These birds tend to defend their breeding territories aggressively, often chasing away much larger birds. A kingbird was photographed in 2009 defending its young by landing on and sinking its talons into the back of a red-tailed hawk and pecking its skull until the red-tailed hawk gave up and flew away.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was introduced in 1799 by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède with the eastern kingbird (&quot;Tyrannus tyrannus&quot;) as the type species. The genus name is the Latin word for &#x27;tyrant&#x27;.

===Species===
The genus contains 13 species:

<text>The General Services Administration (GSA) is an independent agency of the United States government established in 1949 to help manage and support the basic functioning of federal agencies. GSA supplies products and communications for U.S. government offices, provides transportation and office space to federal employees, and develops government-wide cost-minimizing policies and other management tasks.

GSA employs about 12,000 federal workers. It has an annual operating budget of roughly $33 billion and oversees $66 billion of procurement annually. It contributes to the management of about $500 billion in U.S. federal property, divided chiefly among 8,397 owned and leased buildings (with a total of 363 million square feet of space) as well as a 215,000 vehicle motor pool. Among the real estate assets it manages are the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, D.C., which is the largest U.S. federal building after the Pentagon.

GSA&#x27;s business lines include the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) and the Public Buildings Service (PBS), as well as several Staff Offices including the Office of Government-wide Policy, the Office of Small Business Utilization, and the Office of Mission Assurance. As part of FAS, GSA&#x27;s Technology Transformation Services (TTS) helps federal agencies improve the delivery of information and services to the public. Initiatives include the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, 18F, Login.gov, Cloud.gov, FedRAMP, the USAGov platform (USA.gov, GobiernoUSA.gov), Data.gov, Challenge.gov, the U.S. Web Design System, and I.T. Modernization Centers of Excellence.

GSA is a member of the Procurement G6, an informal group leading the use of framework agreements and e-procurement instruments in public procurement.

==History==
In 1947, President Harry Truman asked former president Herbert Hoover to lead what became known as the Hoover Commission to make recommendations to reorganize the operations of the federal government. One of the commission&#x27;s recommendations was the establishment of an &quot;Office of the General Services&quot;, to combine the responsibilities of the following organizations:
*United States Department of the Treasury&#x27;s Bureau of Federal Supply
*U.S. Treasury Department&#x27;s Office of Contract Settlement
*National Archives Establishment
*All functions of the Federal Works Agency, including the Public Buildings Administration and the Public Roads Administration
*War Assets Administration

GSA became an independent agency on July 1, 1949, after the passage of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act. General Jess Larson, administrator of the War Assets Administration, was named GSA&#x27;s first administrator.

The first job awaiting Administrator Larson and the newly formed GSA was a complete renovation of the White House. The structure had fallen into such a state of disrepair by 1949 that one inspector said it was standing &quot;purely from habit&quot;. Larson later explained the total renovation in depth by saying, &quot;In order to make the White House structurally sound, it was necessary to completely dismantle, and I mean completely dismantle, everything from the White House except the four walls, which were constructed of stone. Everything, except the four walls without a roof, was finally stripped down, and that&#x27;s where the work started.&quot; GSA worked closely with President Truman and First Lady Bess Truman to ensure that the new agency&#x27;s first major project would be a success. GSA completed the renovation in 1952.

In 1960, GSA created the Federal Telecommunications System, a government-wide intercity telephone system. In 1962 the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal Office Space created a new building program to address obsolete office buildings in Washington, D.C., resulting in the construction of many of the offices that now line Independence Avenue.

In 1970, the Nixon administration created the Consumer Product Information Coordinating Center, now part of USAGov. In 1974 the Federal Buildings Fund was initiated, allowing GSA to issue rent bills to federal agencies. In 1972 GSA established the Automated Data and Telecommunications Service, which later became the Office of Information Resources Management. In 1973 GSA created the Office of Federal Management Policy. GSA&#x27;s Office of Acquisition Policy centralized procurement policy in 1978. GSA was initially responsible for emergency preparedness and stockpiling strategic materials to be used in wartime until those functions were transferred to the newly created Federal Emergency Management Agency in 1979.

In 1984, GSA introduced the federal government to the use of charge cards, known as the GSA SmartPay system. The National Archives and Records Administration was spun off into an independent agency in 1985. The same year, GSA began providing government-wide policy oversight and guidance for federal real property management as a result of an executive order signed by President Ronald Reagan.

In 1986, GSA headquarters, U.S. General Services Administration Building, located at Eighteenth and F Streets, NW, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, at the time serving as Interior Department offices.

In 2003, the Federal Protective Service, which secures GSA-managed (and other) buildings, was moved to the United States Department of Homeland Security. In 2005, GSA reorganized to merge the Federal Supply Service (FSS) and Federal Technology Service (FTS) business lines into the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS).&lt;ref name=&quot;GSA Releases Draft FTS/FSS Reorganization Plan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Martha N. Johnson to serve as GSA Administrator. After a nine-month delay, the United States Senate confirmed her nomination on February 4, 2010. On April 2, 2012, Johnson resigned in the wake of a management-deficiency report that detailed improper payments for a 2010 &quot;Western Regions&quot; training conference held by the Public Buildings Service in Las Vegas.

In 2013, a result of the Open Government Initiative&#x27;s instruction for federal agencies to open their activities to the public, GSA developed Data.gov to foster transparency and information sharing. In the same year, GSA also launched the Total Workplace initiative to modernize the workplace of federal agencies and increase efficiency, alongside the Presidential Innovation Fellows and the 18F programs. In 2016, the Acquisition Gateway and Making It Easier programs were launched to assist buyers from federal agencies in acquisitions, and to assist new companies in doing business with the government. Improvements were also made in the deliverance of digital government services with the creation of the Technology Transformation Services.

After the election of President Donald Trump in January 2025, GSA became one of the US federal entities targeted by Elon Musk. Members of the Department of Government Efficiency accessed GSA laptops and internal GSA infrastructure. An employee of Elon Musk&#x27;s company Tesla, Thomas Shedd, was appointed to lead &quot;Technology Transformation Services&quot; within the GSA.

===Controversies===
====Ted Weiss Federal Building controversy====
In July 1991, GSA contractors began the excavation of what is now the Ted Weiss Federal Building in New York City. The planning for that building did not take into account the possibility of encountering the historic cemetery for colonial-era African New Yorkers located beneath the footprint of the $276 million office building. When initial excavation disturbed burials, destroying skeletons and artifacts, GSA sent archaeologists to excavate—but hid their findings from the public. Revelation of the discoveries led to 18 months of activism by African-descendant community members, public officials, academics, and concerned citizens. Ultimately, GSA made public amends by funding extensive scientific research under the auspices of Michael Blakey; creating a new subagency, the Office of Public Education and Interpretation; truncating the building plan; and funding public reports on the story of the African Burial Ground. The efforts led to the creation of a new unit of the National Park Service, the African Burial Ground National Monument, at the facility. GSA fully funded that portion of the National Park Service until 2010, when GSA&#x27;s formal involvement with the African Burial Ground ceased.

====Lurita Doan controversy====
During President George W. Bush&#x27;s Administration GSA Administrator, Lurita Doan, was forced to resign after GSA had awarded a sole source contract for $20,000 to her friend. Doan appeared to have violated the Hatch Act and was criticized for political activity while on the job. The investigating team recommended she be punished to the fullest extent, and she resigned soon after.

====Western Regions Training Conference controversy====
In 2012, U.S. representative John Mica, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, called for a congressional investigation into the misuse of federal money by GSA. Lawmakers accused GSA of &quot;lavish spending&quot; following the 2010 Western Regions Training Conference at the M Resort in Las Vegas.

GSA spent $823,000 in taxpayer money toward the October 2010 convention, including $100,405.37 spent on employee travel costs for a total of eight pre-planning meetings, scouting trips, and a &quot;dry run&quot;. The report also found excessive spending for event planners, gifts for participants, and lavish meals.

The conference had been the most recent in a series of similar lavish conferences organized by regions of GSA&#x27;s Public Buildings Service (PBS, not to be confused with the public broadcaster of the same name). In May 2010 GSA treated 120 interns to a five-day conference at a Palm Springs, California, resort. An additional investigation led by Inspector General Brian D. Miller found 115 missing Apple iPods meant for an employee rewards program.

GSA administrator Martha N. Johnson resigned in the wake of the controversy, after firing Public Buildings Service head Robert Peck and senior advisor Stephen Leeds. Four regional commissioners of the Service, who had been responsible for planning the conference, were placed on administrative leave.

====Trump–Biden presidential transition controversy====

After Joe Biden was called by media outlets as the president-elect of the United States – defeating Donald Trump in the November 2020 election – Emily W. Murphy, the chief executive of the General Services Administration, initially refused to sign a letter authorizing Biden&#x27;s transition team to begin work and access federal agencies and transition funds, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. This came as Trump refused to concede Biden&#x27;s presumptive – but not yet certified – victory and follow the norm of facilitating a peaceful transition of power to the presumptive winner. There are no firm rules on how the GSA determines the president-elect. Typically, the GSA chief might decide after reliable news organizations have declared the winner or following a concession by the loser. On November 23, 2020, Murphy issued the letter of ascertainment that meant the Trump administration was ready to begin the formal transition.

====Login.gov Digital Identity Standards controversy====
In April 2022, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office of Inspections, initiated an evaluation of the GSA&#x27;s Login.gov services. OIG initiated this evaluation based on a notification received from GSA&#x27;s Office of General Counsel identifying potential misconduct within Login.gov, a component of GSA&#x27;s Technology Transformation Services (TTS) under the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS). OIG&#x27;s evaluation found that GSA misled their customer agencies when GSA failed to communicate Login.gov&#x27;s known noncompliance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines.

Notwithstanding GSA officials&#x27; assertions that Login.gov met SP 800-63-3 Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) requirements, Login.gov has never included a physical or biometric comparison for its customer agencies. Further, GSA continued to mislead customer agencies even after GSA suspended efforts to meet SP 800-63-3.
GSA knowingly billed IAL2 customer agencies over $10 million for services, including alleged IAL2 services that did not meet IAL2 standards. Furthermore, GSA used misleading language to secure additional funds for Login.gov. Finally, the GSA lacked adequate controls over the Login.gov program and allowed it to operate under a hands-off culture. OIG found that because of its failure to exercise management oversight and internal controls over Login.gov, FAS shares responsibility for the misrepresentations to GSA&#x27;s customers. In response to OIG&#x27;s report, GSA management agreed with the findings and recommendations.

==Organization==

===Structure===
The administrator is a presidential political appointee and the chief executive of the General Services Administration. On April 12, 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Robin Carnahan to serve as administrator. She was confirmed by the US Senate on June 23, 2021.

GSA consists of two major services: the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), and the Public Buildings Service (PBS). In addition to these two major services, the agency also consists of twelve staff offices and two independent offices. The FAS provides both strategic and operational support for the acquisition of goods and services for other federal departments.

These regional offices are located in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Fort Worth, Kansas City (Missouri), New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle (Auburn), and Washington, D.C.

==Operations==
===Procurement and the GSA Schedule===
The Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) provides products and services available to federal agencies across the U.S. government. GSA assists with procurement work for other government agencies. As part of this effort, it maintains the GSA Schedule Program, which other agencies can use to buy goods and services. The GSA Schedule can be thought of as a collection of pre-negotiated contracts. Procurement managers from government agencies can view these agreements and make purchases from the GSA Schedule by following the appropriate procedures prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, Subpart 8.4.

The GSA Schedule is awarded as a prime contract entered into by the federal government and a vendor that has submitted an acceptable proposal. At the core of the GSA Schedule contract lie two key concepts: 1) Basis of Award customer or group of customers and 2) Price Reduction Clause. The two concepts are applied in concert to achieve the government&#x27;s pricing objectives for the GSA Schedule program. Namely, the government wants to ensure that when the vendor experiences competitive pressures to reduce its pricing, then the government can benefit from these and be extended reduced pricing as well.

The Basis of Award customer or group of customers represents the customer or group of customers whose sales are affected on the same terms and conditions as those with GSA, and whose pricing is used: 1) as the baseline during negotiations to establish discounts offered to GSA, and 2) as a price floor that, when breached, constitutes additional discounting that triggers the Price Reduction Clause.

The Price Reduction Clause ensures that vendor discounting practices and GSA Schedule prices maintain a fixed relationship. The vendor specifies in its GSA proposal, and during negotiations of GSA Schedule contract prices, the discounts to be given to Basis of Award customer(s). If the vendor then provides a larger discount to a Basis of Award customer than what was agreed upon in the GSA Schedule contract (i.e., if the price floor is breached), then the vendor&#x27;s GSA price will be reduced proportionately and retroactively.

Effective Price Reduction Clause compliance procedures will protect vendors if their discounting practices are fully and accurately disclosed in their original proposals to GSA and then are used as a basis for compliance over the term of the contract. Although not ideal, a compliance system implemented after a contract has been awarded can bring a contract into compliance, although sometimes at the expense of profits. If implementing a system in the middle of a contract period, inaccuracies that turn up should be corrected immediately, and the GSA contracting officer should be made aware of them. Price Reduction Clause compliance systems and procedures can range from simple to complex. A simple, manual system would be appropriate for a service contractor with standard labor rates that are not discounted. A complex system would be required for a reseller with thousands of products and discounting policies that differ among product groups.

In response to increased mandates and standards required by the Federal Government of its agencies and in a push to plan for federal sustainability, GSA offers online tools to aid in the building and management of government offices that are subject to these requirements.

GSA has delegated authority to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to procure medical supplies under the VA Federal Supply Schedules Program.

In 2018, GSA awarded federal government debt collection services to IC System.

===Federal property and buildings===
The Public Buildings Service (PBS) acquires and manages thousands of federal properties. In accordance with Title 40 of the United States Code, GSA is charged with promulgating regulations governing the acquisition, use, and disposal of real property (real estate and land) and personal property (essentially all other property). This activity is centered in GSA&#x27;s Office of Governmentwide Policy. Policies promulgated by GSA are developed in collaboration with federal agencies and are typically published for public comment in the Federal Register before publication as a Final Rule.

The Public Buildings Service provides offices for its customers (I.e., federal agencies) and provides United States courthouses at good economies to the American taxpayer. PBS is funded primarily through the Federal Buildings Fund, which is supported by the rent from federal customer agencies.

The Office of Property Disposal of the PBS manages the disposal of surplus real property. The Office is responsible for land, office buildings, warehouses, former post offices, farms, family residences, commercial facilities, and airfields located in the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Territories. Surplus property is made available to both government and private bidders and, in some cases, land sold for public purposes (such as parks or welfare) may be discounted by up to 100% of FMV.

Twenty-four GSA green buildings have earned LEED ratings. Some green offerings include green roofs, underfloor air distribution, use of renewable power from utility companies, and light shelves (located outside of the building that reduce the amount of heat radiating into the building from the sun while increasing the amount of natural light and high ceilings that help direct daylight deep into the work environment). The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 made available not less than $4.5 billion for measures necessary to convert GSA facilities to High-Performance Green Buildings, as defined in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-140).

The Department of Energy&#x27;s Federal Energy Management Program facilitates GSA’s implementation under the Act through project transaction services, applied technology services, and decision support services, deploying renewable energy technologies and cultivating change to embrace energy efficiency.

In 2004, GSA was presented with the Honor Award from the National Building Museum for &quot;success in creating and maintaining innovative environments for the federal community as well as providing a positive federal presence for the public&quot;.

===Federal vehicle fleet management===
GSA contributes to the management of U.S. Federal property, including a 215,000 vehicle motor pool.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (stimulus bill) included $300 million to acquire energy-efficient motor vehicles for the federal fleet. President Barack Obama announced that GSA was to support the U.S. auto industry with orders for about 17,600 new fuel-efficient vehicles by June 1, 2009, on an accelerated schedule, with money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. GSA was to pay $285 million to General Motors Corporation, Chrysler LLC, and Ford Motor Company. It was to include 2,500 hybrid sedans—the largest one-time purchase yet of hybrid vehicles for the federal government—and each new vehicle was claimed to yield at least a 10% fuel economy improvement over its predecessor. GSA was to spend $15 million more that year on a pilot fleet of advanced-technology vehicles, including all-electric vehicles and hybrid buses.

Hybrids accounted for about 10 percent of the 145,473 vehicles the U.S. General Services Administration bought during the fiscal years 2009 and 2010, after making up less than 1 percent of government vehicle purchases in 2008. As for specific models, Obama took a buy-American stance. The U.S. government bought about two-thirds of the Chevrolet Malibu Hybrids sold during the past two years, and almost a third of the Ford Fusion Hybrids, but only 17 Toyota Prius hybrids and five Honda Civic Hybrids. Ground Force One, so designated when transporting the POTUS, is one of two armored buses procured in 2010 for the transportation of dignitaries under protection of the Secret Service, at a cost of $1.1 million each. The coaches were assembled in Tennessee on frames made in Canada.

===Interagency Resources Management Conference===
The Interagency Resources Management Conference (IRMCO) was a federal executive conference of the General Services Administration, held annually between 1961 and 2011 as a multi-day offsite event. It gave awards to federal government teams that improved government operations or communications with the public. Its attendees included Senior Executive Service members from a range of agencies, along with members of industry. After IRMCO 2011, GSA announced that it was discontinuing IRMCO because it no longer had a purpose. Instead, in 2012 GSA held a one-day Acquisition Excellence event focused on efficiency.

===Technology Transformation Services===

GSA established the Federal Citizen Information Center in 1970 (now USAGov) to connect the public to government information and services. In 2009, GSA created the Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies (now the Office of Products and Programs) to expand the effort to serve the public through technology.

In 2014, GSA began managing the Presidential Innovation Fellows program and launched 18F with a team focused on improving the federal government&#x27;s digital services. Between 2014 and 2024, 18F worked with 34 agencies on 455 projects, such as improving online permitting and complaint submission processes. 18F helped the Federal Election Commission move its website to the Cloud.gov platform, which FEC projected would save it $1.2 million annually.

GSA established the IT Modernization Centers of Excellence in 2017 to accelerate the modernization of IT infrastructure and reduce legacy IT spending across the government. The Centers of Excellence are a fee-for-service consulting service. For example, they helped the Agriculture Department avoid $42 million in costs by closing data centers.

GSA consolidated those offices into the Technology Transformation Service (TTS) in 2016, which became a sub-unit of the Federal Acquisition Service in 2017. Its mission is to improve the lives of the public and public servants by transforming how the government uses technology. TTS aims to meet the government&#x27;s technology needs: acquisition, omnichannel experience, intelligent process automation, infrastructure optimization and cloud, accelerators and innovation, data and analytics, and identity management.

TTS offices and programs include:
* United States Digital Corps: Fellowship program for early-career technologists to launch impactful careers in public service and create a more effective, equitable government.
* TTS Solutions: Products and services that help agencies improve the delivery of information and services to the public, such as Login.gov.
* Data.gov

===Section 1122 Program===
Section 1122 of the 1994 National Defense Authorization Act enabled state and local government agencies to purchase defense and other federal equipment to support drug enforcement activity. In 2009, the reauthorization bill expanded the program to purchases for use in homeland security and emergency response operations. The program is owned and managed by the Department of Defense (DOD), and equipment is made available by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and GSA, as is also done under the 1033 program.

<doc id="424409" wikidata="Q3118797" url="?curid=424409" title="Henry Huttleston Rogers">
<text>Henry Huttleston Rogers (January 29, 1840 – May 19, 1909) was an American industrialist and financier. He made his fortune in the oil refining business, becoming a leader at Standard Oil. He also played a major role in numerous corporations and business enterprises in the gas industry, copper, and railroads. He became a close friend of Mark Twain.

Rogers&#x27; success in the oil industry began with Charles Pratt in 1866, when he invented an improved process by which naphtha was separated from crude oil during oil refining. John D. Rockefeller bought his and Pratt&#x27;s business in 1874, and Rogers rose rapidly in Standard Oil. He designed the idea of a very long pipeline for transporting oil, as opposed to using railway cars. In the 1880s, he broadened his interests beyond oil to include copper, steel, banking, and railroads, as well as the Consolidated Gas Company that provided coal gas to major cities. By the 1890s, as Rockefeller was withdrawing from the oil business, Rogers was a dominant figure at Standard Oil. In 1899, Rogers set up the Amalgamated Copper trust, based in Butte, Montana, that dominated an industry in high demand as the nation needed wire to build its electric networks. His last major enterprise was building the Virginian Railway to service the West Virginia coal fields. After 1890, he became a prominent philanthropist, as well as a friend and supporter of Mark Twain and Booker T. Washington.

==Early life and education==
Rogers was born in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, on January 29, 1840. He was the elder son of Rowland Rogers (a former ship captain, bookkeeper and grocer) and his wife, Mary Eldredge Huttleston. Both parents were Yankees and were descended from the Pilgrims who arrived in 1620 aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. His mother&#x27;s family had earlier used the spelling &quot;Huddleston&quot; rather than &quot;Huttleston&quot;. (Consequently, Rogers&#x27; name is often misspelled.)

Except for a brief move to Mattapoisett, Massachusetts, during Rogers&#x27; early childhood, the family lived in Fairhaven, a fishing village across the Acushnet River from the whaling port of New Bedford. Fairhaven is a small seaside town on the south coast, bordering the Acushnet River to the west and Buzzards Bay to the south. In the mid-1850s, whaling was already an industry in decline in New England. Whale oil was soon replaced by kerosene and natural gas. Henry Rogers&#x27; father was one of the many men of New England who changed from a life on the sea to other work to provide for their families.

Rogers was an average student, and he was in the first graduating class of the local high school in 1856. Continuing to live with his parents, he was hired on with the Fairhaven Branch Railroad, an early precursor of the Old Colony Railroad, as an expressman and brakeman. He worked there for three to four years, while carefully saving his earnings.

==Marriages and family==
While vacationing in Fairhaven in 1862, Rogers married his childhood sweetheart, Abbie Palmer Gifford, who was also of &quot;Mayflower&quot; lineage. She returned with him to the oil fields where they lived in a one-room shack along Oil Creek, where her young husband and Ellis worked the Wamsutta Oil Refinery. While they lived in Pennsylvania, their first daughter, Anne Engle Rogers, was born in 1865. They had five surviving children together, four girls and a boy. Another son died at birth.

After the family moved to New York in 1866, Cara Leland Rogers was born in Fairhaven in 1867, Millicent Gifford Rogers was born in 1873, followed by Mary Huttleston Rogers (known as &quot;Mai&quot;) in 1875.

Their son, Henry Huttleston Rogers Jr., was born in 1879 and was known as Harry. He lived in New York City and became a colonel in the New York Militia. He served on the Mexican border in 1916, and with the U.S. Army in France from 1917 to 1919 as a lieutenant colonel in the Field Artillery during the First World War. He was also a member of the Rhode Island Society of the Cincinnati.

Abbie Palmer Gifford Rogers died unexpectedly on May 21, 1894. Her childhood home, a two-story, gable-end frame house built in the Greek Revival style, has been preserved. It is made available for tours of Fairhaven, Massachusetts, where she and her husband grew up.

In 1896, Rogers remarried to Emelie Augusta Randel Hart, a divorcée and New York socialite. They had no children.

==Career==

In 1861, 21-year-old Henry pooled his savings of approximately US$600 with a friend, Charles P. Ellis. They set out to western Pennsylvania and its newly discovered oil fields. Borrowing another US$600, the young partners began a small refinery at McClintocksville near Oil City. They named their new enterprise Wamsutta Oil Refinery. Rogers and Ellis and their refinery made US$30,000 during their first year. This amount was more than the earnings of three whaling ship trips during an average voyage of more than a year&#x27;s duration. When Rogers returned home to Fairhaven for a short vacation the next year, he was greeted as a success.

In Pennsylvania, Rogers was introduced to Charles Pratt (1830–91). Born in Watertown, Massachusetts, Pratt had been one of eleven children. His father, Asa Pratt, was a carpenter. Of modest means, he spent three winters as a student at Wesleyan Academy, and is said to have lived on a dollar a week at times. In nearby Boston, Massachusetts, Pratt joined a company specializing in paints and whale oil products. In 1850 or 1851, he came to New York City, where he worked for a similar company handling paint and oil.

Pratt was a pioneer of the natural oil industry, and established his kerosene refinery Astral Oil Works in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, New York. Pratt&#x27;s product later gave rise to the slogan, &quot;The holy lamps of Tibet are primed with Astral Oil&quot;. He also later founded the Pratt Institute.

When Pratt met Rogers at McClintocksville on a business trip, he already knew Charles Ellis, having earlier bought whale oil from him back east in Fairhaven. Although Ellis and Rogers had no wells and were dependent upon purchasing crude oil to refine and sell to Pratt, the two young men agreed to sell the entire output of their small Wamsutta refinery to Pratt&#x27;s company at a fixed price. This worked well at first. Then, a few months later, crude oil prices suddenly increased due to manipulation by speculators. The young entrepreneurs struggled to try to live up to their contract with Pratt, but soon their surplus was wiped out. Before long, they were heavily in debt to Pratt.

Charles Ellis gave up, but in 1866, Henry Rogers went to Pratt in New York and told him he would take personal responsibility for the entire debt. This so impressed Pratt that he immediately hired him for his own organization.

===New York, oil refining===
Pratt made Rogers foreman of his Brooklyn refinery, with a promise of a partnership if sales ran over $50,000 a year. The Rogers&#x27; family moved to Brooklyn. Rogers moved steadily from foreman to manager, and then superintendent of Pratt&#x27;s Astral Oil Refinery. He accomplished and exceeded the substantial sales increase goal which Pratt had set when recruiting him. As promised, Pratt gave Rogers an interest in the business. In 1867, with Henry Rogers as a partner, he established the firm of Charles Pratt and Company. In the next few years, Rogers became, in the words of Elbert Hubbard, Pratt&#x27;s &quot;hands and feet and eyes and ears&quot; (&quot;Little Journeys to the Homes&quot;, 1909). As their family grew, Henry and Abbie continued to live in New York City, but vacationed frequently at Fairhaven.

While working with Pratt, Rogers invented an improved way of separating naphtha, a mixture of hydrocarbon compounds produced during the distillation of crude oil, from the oil. He was granted U.S. Patent # 120,539 on October 31, 1871.

====Fighting Rockefeller====
In the early 1871–1872, Pratt and Company and other refiners became involved in a conflict with John D. Rockefeller, Samuel Andrews, and Henry M. Flagler (of Rockefeller, Andrews &amp; Flagler, a Cleveland-based refining company) and the South Improvement Company. In developing what would become Standard Oil, Rockefeller, a manager of extraordinary abilities, and Flagler, an exceptional marketer, recognized that the costs and control of the shipment of crude oil would be key elements in competition with other refiners. With its combination of clever market manipulation, and hard-nosed dealings with the powerful Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), the South Improvement scheme was an example of the type of business tactics which Rockefeller and his associates used to become successful. Although Rockefeller became the target of many who decried Standard Oil&#x27;s ruthlessness in subsequent years, the South Improvement rebate scheme was Flagler&#x27;s idea.

South Improvement was basically a mechanism to obtain secret favorable net rates from Tom Scott of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and other railroads through secret rebates from the common carrier. A &quot;common carrier&quot; is somewhat like a utility, inasmuch as it often has certain rights, powers and monopolies on its services beyond those normally afforded regular business enterprises. A common carrier was expected to serve the public good and treat its customers uniformly. Rates in that era were promulgated and published in what was called &quot;tariffs&quot; and were public information. The rebate scheme was done outside of that process. As an opposite effect, normally afforded &quot;tariffs&quot; were increased and charged to customers not privy to the scheme.

Newspapers were quick to publicize the issue. The injustice of the South Improvement scheme outraged many independent oil producers and owners of refineries. Rogers led the opposition among the New York refiners. The New York interests formed an association, and about the middle of March 1872 sent a committee of three, with Rogers as head, to Oil City to consult with the Oil Producers&#x27; Union. Working with the Pennsylvania independents, Rogers and the New York delegation managed to forge an agreement with the railroads, whose leaders eventually agreed to open their rates to all and promised to end their shady dealings with South Improvement.

Rockefeller and his associates quickly started another approach, which frequently included buying up opposing interests. Their dominance of the growing industry and the squeezing out of smaller competitors continued and expanded. But, the South Improvement incident prompted growing public sentiment to support governmental oversight and regulation of large businesses, including the railroads. Congress passed new antitrust laws, the administration created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), and the courts eventually ordered the breakup of the Standard Oil Trust in the early 20th century.

====Combining forces: joining Standard Oil====
In 1874, Rockefeller approached Pratt with a plan to cooperate and consolidate their businesses. Pratt discussed it with Rogers, and they decided that the combination would benefit them. Rogers formulated terms, which guaranteed financial security and jobs for Pratt and himself. Rockefeller had apparently learned a lot about Rogers&#x27; talents and negotiating skills during the South Improvement conflict. He quietly accepted the offer on the exact terms Rogers had laid out. In this manner, Charles Pratt and Company (including Astral Oil) became one of the important independent refiners to join the Standard Oil Trust.

By this date, Charles Pratt was reaching an age to consider retirement, and he subsequently devoted much of his time and interests to activities such as founding the Pratt Institute. However, Pratt&#x27;s son, Charles Millard Pratt (1858 to 1913), became Corporate Secretary of Standard Oil. As a part owner of Pratt and Company, Rogers, who was about 35 years old, now owned a share of Standard Oil himself. In the deal, Rockefeller had also added Henry Rogers to his team. He undoubtedly placed a high value on Rogers&#x27; potential. History does not tell us if he foresaw that the promising young man was destined to become one of his major partners.

====Building Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller====

Standard Oil was an oil refining conglomerate. Its successors continued to be among the world&#x27;s biggest corporations over 140 years later. John D. Rockefeller, long regarded as the principal founder, was of a modest background and education. Born in New York in 1839, he moved with his family to Cleveland in 1855. His first job was as an assistant bookkeeper for a produce company. He delighted, as he later recalled, in &quot;all the methods and systems of the office&quot;. He became particularly well skilled at calculating transportation costs, a skill which would later serve him well. He worked in variety of small business enterprises during the next few years, owning interests in several.

During this time, Rockefeller became friends with Henry Morrison Flagler. The two men had much in common, as they were both conservative, hard-working, energetic, and driven to make money. Their backgrounds included working separately for a number of years in various retail enterprises, including the grain business. Although they were teetotalers personally, distilled spirits were a byproduct of the handling of corn, and both embraced the business opportunity that they presented; making money was clearly paramount.

In their separate forays into business, financial results for the two had been mixed. Flagler, nine years senior to Rockefeller, had been completely wiped out financially in a venture into salt. Only a loan from a relative, Stephen V. Harkness, allowed him to keep creditors at bay and stay out of total ruin.

In the second half of the 19th century, the United States began a transition from use of whale oil to petroleum for heating and lighting. Discovery of oil fields in western Pennsylvania in the late 1850s and the promise of increased industrial activity and economic growth after the end of the American Civil War combined to make the refining of crude oil seem an attractive business to Rockefeller. He and Flagler enlisted chemist Samuel Andrews and with his brother, William Rockefeller, Jabez Bostwick, and Flagler&#x27;s relative and silent partner, Stephen V. Harkness, went into the refining business in Cleveland as Rockefeller, Andrews &amp; Flagler.

By all accounts, Rockefeller was an extraordinarily talented manager and financial planner, Flagler was an exceptional marketer, and Andrews had the know-how to oversee refining aspects. It was to be a very successful combination. As the demand for kerosene and a new byproduct, gasoline, grew in the United States, by 1868, what was to become Standard Oil was the world&#x27;s largest oil refinery.

In 1870, Rockefeller formed Standard Oil Company of Ohio and started his strategy of buying up the competition and consolidating all oil refining under one company. It was during this period that the Pratt interests and Henry Rogers were brought into the fold. By 1878 Standard Oil held about 90% of the refining capacity in the United States.

Flagler&#x27;s wife was in failing health due to what was later determined to be tuberculosis. On advice of her physician, he took her to Florida for the winter months beginning in 1877, and she did seem to improve with the gentle winter and cool ocean breezes there. While in Florida, Flagler was struck with the lack of good rail transportation south of Jacksonville, the equally poor availability of good lodging, and the potential the impoverished state held as a vacation destination for northerners. Sensing a major business opportunity, he began to invest and become a major developer of Florida&#x27;s east coast in what many regard as his &quot;second career.&quot; However, his ventures in Florida marked the beginning of his gradual reduction in management participation at Standard Oil.

In 1881 the company was reorganized as the Standard Oil Trust. In 1885, the headquarters were relocated from Cleveland to New York City. By this time, the three main men of Standard Oil Trust had become John D. Rockefeller, his brother William, and Henry Rogers, who had emerged as a key financial strategist. By 1890, Rogers was a vice president of Standard Oil and chairman of the organization&#x27;s operating committee.

====Oil and gas pipelines====
Petroleum pipelines were first developed in Pennsylvania in the 1860s to replace transport in wooden barrels loaded on wagons drawn by mules and driven by teamsters. This mule-drawn transportation was expensive and fraught with difficulties: leaking barrels, muddy trails, wagon breakdowns and mule/driver problems.

The first successful metal pipeline was completed in 1865, when Samuel Van Syckel built a four-mile (6 km) pipeline from Pithole, Pennsylvania, to the nearest railroad. This initial success led to the construction of pipelines to connect crude oil production, increasingly moving west as new fields were discovered and Pennsylvania fields declined, to refineries located near major demand centers in the Northeast. Biographer Z. James Varanini writes, &quot;the completion of these pipelines represented a move towards a new type of interconnectivity of previously isolated states.&quot;

When Rockefeller observed this, he began to acquire many of the new pipelines. Soon, his Standard Oil companies owned a majority of the lines, which provided cheap, efficient transportation for oil. Cleveland, Ohio, became a center of the refining industry principally because of its transportation systems.

Rogers conceived the idea of long pipelines for transporting oil and natural gas. In 1881, the National Transit Company was formed by Standard Oil to own and operate Standard&#x27;s pipelines. The National Transit Company remained one of Rogers&#x27; favorite projects throughout the rest of his life.

East Ohio Gas Company (EOG) was incorporated on September 8, 1898, as a marketing company for the National Transit Company, the natural gas arm of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. The company launched its business by selling to consumers in northeast Ohio gas produced by another National Transit subsidiary, Hope Natural Gas Company.

Rubber-manufacturing city Akron, Ohio, was the first to take advantage of the lower prices for natural gas. It granted the East Ohio Gas Company a franchise in September 1898, the same month that the company was founded. During the winter of 1898–99, the National Transit Company built a 10-inch wrought iron pipeline that stretched from the Pipe Creek on the Ohio River to Akron, with branches to Canton, Massillon, Dover, New Philadelphia, Uhrichsville, and Dennison. The first gas from the pipeline burned in Akron on May 10, 1899.

====Steel====
Andrew Carnegie, long the leading steel magnate of Pittsburgh, retired at the turn of the 20th century, and refocused his interests on philanthropy. His steel holdings were consolidated into the new United States Steel Corporation. Standard Oil&#x27;s interest in steel properties led to Rogers becoming one of the directors when it was organized in 1901.

====Regulating Standard Oil====
In 1890 the U.S. Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act. This act is the source of all American anti-monopoly laws. The law forbids every contract, scheme, deal, conspiracy to restrain trade. It also forbids inspirations to secure monopoly of a given industry. The Standard Oil Trust attracted attention from antitrust authorities. The Ohio Attorney General filed and won an antitrust suit in 1892.

Ida M. Tarbell, an American author and journalist, who was known as one of the leading muckrakers, criticized Standard Oil practices. Tarbell met Rogers, by then the most senior and powerful director of Standard Oil, through his friend, Mark Twain. They began to meet in January 1902 and continued for the next two years. As Tarbell brought up case histories, Rogers provided an explanation, documents and figures concerning the case. Rogers may have believed Tarbell intended a complimentary work, as he was apparently candid. Her interviews with him were the basis of her negative exposé of Standard Oil&#x27;s questionable business practices. Tarbell&#x27;s investigations of Standard Oil for &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, ran in 19 parts from November 1902 to October 1904. They were collected and published as &quot;The History of the Standard Oil Company&quot; in 1904.

Although public opposition to Rockefeller and Standard Oil existed prior to Tarbell&#x27;s investigation, there had been general opposition to Standard Oil and trusts. Her book is widely credited with hastening the 1911 breakup of Standard Oil by the United States Supreme Court. &quot;They had never played fair, and that ruined their greatness for me&quot;, Tarbell wrote about the company.

Tarbell blasted Standard Oil for dubious business practices, including subduing competitors and engaging in illegal transportation deals with the railroad companies to undercut competitors&#x27; prices.

===Natural gas===
Rogers joined in the organization of holding companies aimed at controlling natural gas production and distribution. In 1884, with associates, Rogers formed the Consolidated Gas Company, and thereafter for several years he was instrumental in gaining control of great city plants, fighting terrific battles with rivals for some of them, as in the case of Boston. Almost the whole story of his natural gas interests was one of business warfare.

===Copper===
During the 1890s, Rogers became interested in Anaconda and other copper properties in the western United States. In 1899, with William Rockefeller, and Thomas W. Lawson, he formed the first $75,000,000 section of the gigantic trust, Amalgamated Copper Mining Company, which was the subject of much acrid criticism then and for years afterward. In the building of this great trust, some of the most ruthless strokes in modern business history were dealt: the $38,000,000 &quot;watering&quot; of the stock of the first corporation, its subsequent manipulation, the seizure of the copper property of the Butte &amp; Boston Consolidated Mining Company, the using of the latter as a weapon against the Boston &amp; Montana Consolidated Copper and Silver Mining Company, the guerrilla warfare against certain private interests, and the wrecking of the Globe Bank of Boston.

A holding company aimed at controlling copper production and distribution, Amalgamated Copper controlled the copper mines of Butte, Montana and later became Anaconda Copper Company, a revert to its original name.

===Transit: Staten Island===
On July 1, 1892, Staten Island, New York&#x27;s first trolley line opened, running between Port Richmond and Meiers Corners. Trolleys, which cost only a nickel a ride through most of their existence, help facilitate mass transit across the Island by reaching communities not serviced by trains. Henry H. Rogers was long-known as the Staten Island transit magnate, and was also involved with the Staten Island-Manhattan Ferry Service and the Richmond Power and Light Company.

===Railroads===
Rogers was also close associate of E. H. Harriman in the latter&#x27;s extensive railroad operations. He was a director of the Santa Fe, St. Paul, Erie, Lackawanna, Union Pacific, and several other large railroads. However, he also involved himself in at least three West Virginia short-line railroad projects, one of which would grow much larger than he probably anticipated.

====Ohio River Railroad====
In mid-1890s, Rogers became president of the Ohio River Railroad, founded by Johnson Newlon Camden, a United States senator from West Virginia who was also secretly involved with Standard Oil. Charles M. Pratt and Rogers were two of the largest owners and the Ohio River Railroad&#x27;s General Manager was C.M. Burt. Its General Solicitor was former West Virginia governor William A. MacCorkle. The owners wished to sell the railroad, which was losing money.

Under Rogers&#x27; leadership, they formed a subsidiary, West Virginia Short Line Railroad, to build a new line between New Martinsville and Clarksburg to reach new coal mining areas, into territory already planned for expansion by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O). The expansion plans had the desired effect of essentially forcing B&amp;O to purchase the Ohio River Railroad to block the competition in the new coal areas. The Ohio River Railroad was sold to B&amp;O in 1898.

====Kanawha and Pocahontas Railroad Company====
The Kanawha and Pocahontas Railroad Company was incorporated in West Virginia in 1898 by either a son of Charles Pratt or the estate of Charles Pratt. Its line ran from the Kanawha River up a tributary called Paint Creek. Once again, new coal mining territory was involved. Rogers, acting on behalf of Charles Pratt and Company negotiated its lease to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) in 1901 and its sale to a newly formed C&amp;O subsidiary, Kanawha and Paint Creek Railway Company, in 1902. (I have never seen any documentation that involves Rogers in this railroad, and comments by Gov. MacCorkle in his book suggest that Rogers was not involved with this deal.) TWS

====Virginian Railway====
His final achievement, working with consulting engineer William Nelson Page, was the building of the Virginian Railway (VGN), which eventually extended from the coal fields of southern West Virginia to port near Norfolk at Sewell&#x27;s Point, Virginia in the harbor of Hampton Roads. 

Initially, Rogers&#x27; involvement in the project began in 1902 with Page&#x27;s Deepwater Railway, planned as an short line to reach untapped coal reserves in a very rugged portion of southern West Virginia, and interchange its traffic with the C&amp;O and/or the N&amp;W. Some speculate that the Deepwater Railway was probably intended for resale in the manner of the earlier two West Virginia short lines. However, if so, the ploy was foiled by collusion of the bigger railroads, who were both controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad and agreed with each other to neither purchase it or grant favorable interchange rates.

Page was the &quot;front man&quot; for the Deepwater project, and it is likely the leaders of the big railroads were unaware that their foe was backed by the wealthy Rogers, who did not give up a good fight easily. Instead of abandoning the project, Page and Rogers secretly developed a plan to extend their new railroad all the way across West Virginia and Virginia to port at Hampton Roads. They modified the Deepwater Railway charter to reach the Virginia-state line. A Rogers coal property attorney in Staunton, Virginia formed another intrastate railroad in Virginia, the Tidewater Railway.

The battle for the Tidewater Railway&#x27;s rights-of-way displayed Rogers at his most crafty and ingenious. He was able to persuade the leading citizens of Roanoke and Norfolk, both strongholds of the rival Norfolk and Western, that his new railroad would be a boon to both communities, secretly securing crucial rights-of-way in the process. In 1907, the name of the Tidewater Railway was changed to The Virginian Railway Company, and it acquired the Deepwater Railway to form the needed West Virginia-Virginia link.

Financed almost entirely from Rogers&#x27; own resources, and completed in 1909, instead of interchanging, the new Virginian Railway competed with the much larger Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and Norfolk and Western Railway for coal traffic. Built following his policy of investing in the best route and equipment on initial selection and purchase to save operating expenses, the VGN enjoyed a more modern pathway built to the highest standards, and provided major competition to its larger neighboring railroads, each of whom tried several times unsuccessfully to acquire it after they realized it could not be blocked from completion.

However, the time and enormous effort Rogers expended on the project continued to undermine his already declining health, not only because of his Herculean work but also because of the uncertain economy of the period, exacerbated by the financial Panic of 1907 which began in March of that year. To obtain the needed financing, he was forced to pour many of his own assets into the railroad. Management of the funding Rogers was providing was handled by Boston financier Godfrey M. Hyams, with whom he had also worked on the Anaconda Company, and many other natural resource projects.

On July 22, 1907, he suffered a debilitating stroke. Over a period of about five months, he gradually recovered. In 1908, he put the remaining financing in place needed to see his railroad to completion. When completed the following year, the Virginian Railway was called by the newspapers &quot;the biggest little railway in the world&quot; and proved both viable and profitable.

Many historians consider the Virginian Railway to be one of Henry Rogers&#x27; greatest legacies. The Virginian Railway (VGN) followed his philosophy regarding investing in the best equipment and paying its employees and vendors well throughout its profitable history. It operated some of the largest and most powerful steam, electric, and diesel locomotives throughout its 50-year history. Chronicled by rail historian and rail photographer H. Reid in &quot;The Virginian Railway&quot; (Kalmbach, 1961), the VGN gained a following of railway enthusiasts which continues to the present day.

The VGN was merged into the Norfolk &amp; Western in 1959. However, almost all of the former VGN mainline trackage in West Virginia and about 50% of that in Virginia is still in use in 2006 as the preferred route for eastbound coal trains for Norfolk Southern Corporation due to the more favorable gradients while crossing the Allegheny Mountains&#x27; continental divide and the Blue Ridge Mountains east of Roanoke, while most westbound traffic of empty coal cars uses the original Norfolk and Western main line.

===Banking and trading===
When the newly formed Mutual Alliance Trust Company opened for business in New York on the Tuesday after June 29, 1902, there were 13 directors, including Emanuel Lehman, William Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and Rogers.

By 1907, Rogers was a member of the Consolidated Stock Exchange of New York, one of around 13,000.

==Business summary: &quot;Hell Hound&quot;==
Rogers was an energetic man, and exhibited ruthlessness, and iron determination. In the financial and business world he could be grasping and greedy, and operated under a flexible moral code that often stretched the rules of both honesty and fair play. On Wall Street in New York City, he became known as &quot;Hell Hound Rogers&quot; and &quot;The Brains of the Standard Oil Trust.&quot; He was considered one of the last and great &quot;robber barons&quot; of his day, as times were changing. Nevertheless, Rogers amassed a great fortune, estimated at over $100 million. He invested heavily in various industries, including copper, steel, mining, and railways.

Much of what we know about Rogers and his style in business dealings was recorded by others. His behavior in public Court Proceedings provide some of the better examples and some insight. Rogers&#x27; business style extended to his testimony in many court settings. Before the Hepburn Committee of 1879, investigating the railroads of New York, he fine-tuned his circumlocutory, ambiguous, and haughty responses. His most intractable performance was later in a 1906 lawsuit by the state of Missouri, which claimed that two companies in that state registered as independents were actually subsidiaries of Standard Oil, a secret ownership Rogers finally acknowledged.

In &quot;Marquis Who&#x27;s Who for 1908&quot;, Rogers listed more than twenty corporations of which he was either president and director or vice president and director.

At his death he held assets later estimated to be worth $100 million, but a 2012 critical examination of his wealth considers a closer estimate.

==Philanthropy in Fairhaven==
Rogers was a modest man, and some of his generosity became known only after his death. Examples are found in writings by Helen Keller, Mark Twain, and Booker T. Washington. Beginning in 1885, he began to donate buildings to his hometown of Fairhaven, Massachusetts. These included a grammar school, Rogers School, built in 1885. The Millicent Library was completed in 1893 and was a gift to the Town by the Rogers children in memory of their sister Millicent, who had died in 1890 at the age of 17.

Abbie Palmer (née Gifford) Rogers presented the new Town Hall in 1894. The George H. Taber Masonic Lodge building, named for Rogers&#x27; &quot;uncle&quot; and boyhood mentor, was completed in 1901. The Unitarian Memorial Church was dedicated in 1904 to the memory of Rogers&#x27; mother, Mary Huttleston (née Eldredge) Rogers. He had the Tabitha Inn built in 1905, and a new Fairhaven High School, called &quot;Castle on the Hill,&quot; was completed in 1906. Rogers funded the draining of the mill pond to create a park, installed the town&#x27;s public water and sewer systems, and served as superintendent of streets for his hometown. Years later, Henry H. Rogers&#x27; daughter, Cara Leland Rogers Broughton (Lady Fairhaven), purchased the site of Fort Phoenix, and donated it to the Town of Fairhaven in her father&#x27;s memory.

After Abbie&#x27;s death, Rogers developed close friendships with two other notable Americans: Mark Twain and Booker T. Washington. He was instrumental in the education of Helen Keller. Urged on by Twain, Rogers and his second wife financed her college education.

In 1899, Rogers had a luxury steam yacht built by a shipyard in the Bronx. The &quot;Kanawha&quot;, at 471-tons, was long and manned by a crew of 39. For the final ten years of his life, Rogers entertained friends as they sailed on cruises mostly along the East Coast of the United States, north to Maine and Canada, and south to Virginia. With Mark Twain among his frequent guests, the movements of the &quot;Kanawha&quot; attracted great attention from the newspapers, the major public media of the era.

==Death==

On May 19, 1909, Rogers died suddenly of a stroke. It was less than six weeks before full operations were scheduled to begin on his Virginian Railway. After a funeral at the First Unitarian Church in Manhattan, his body was transported to Fairhaven by a New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad train. He was interred beside Abbie in Fairhaven&#x27;s Riverside Cemetery.

==Friendships and philanthropy==

===Mark Twain===

In 1893, a mutual friend introduced Rogers to humorist Mark Twain. Rogers reorganized Twain&#x27;s tangled finances, and the two became close friends for the rest of Rogers&#x27; life. By the 1890s, Twain&#x27;s fortunes began to decline; in his later life, Twain suffered from depression. He lost three of his four children, and his wife, Olivia Langdon, before his death in 1910.

Twain had some very bad times with his businesses. His publishing company ended up going bankrupt, and he lost thousands of dollars on a typesetting machine that was never quite perfected for commercial use. He also lost a great deal of revenue on royalties from his books being plagiarized before he had a chance to publish them himself.

Rogers and Twain enjoyed a more than 16-year friendship. Rogers&#x27; family became Twain&#x27;s surrogate family, and he was a frequent guest at the Rogers townhouse in New York City. Earl J. Dias described the relationship in these words: &quot;Rogers and Twain were kindred spirits—fond of poker, billiards, the theater, practical jokes, mild profanity, the good-natured spoof. Their friendship, in short, was based on a community of interests and on the fact that each, in some way, needed the other.&quot; Their letters were published as &quot;Mark Twain&#x27;s Correspondence with Henry Huttleston Rogers, 1893–1909&quot;, They had a standing joke that Twain was inclined to pilfer items from the Rogers household whenever he spent the night there as a guest. Two letters provide an illustration. Twain wrote to Anne Rogers that he had packed:

some articles that was laying around...two books, Mr. Rogers&#x27; brown slippers, and a ham. I thought it was one of ourn. It looked like one we used to have, but it shan&#x27;t occur again, and don&#x27;t you worry. He will temper the wind to the shorn lamb, and I will send some of the things back if there is some that won&#x27;t keep. Yores in Jesus, S.L.C.

Rogers responded on October 31, 1906, with the following:

Before I forget it, let me remind you that I shall want the trunk and the things you took away from my house as soon as possible. I learn that instead of taking old things, you took my best. Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. I am going to Fairhaven this afternoon. I hope you will not be there. By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don&#x27;t seem to be much of an attraction.

In April 1907, they traveled together on the &quot;Kanawha&quot; to the Jamestown Exposition in celebration of the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Jamestown Colony. Twain returned to Norfolk, Virginia with Rogers in April 1909, and was the guest speaker at the dedication dinner held for the newly completed Virginian Railway, a &quot;Mountains to Sea&quot; engineering marvel of the day. The construction of the new railroad had been solely financed by industrialist Rogers.

===Helen Keller&#x27;s education===
In May 1896, at the home in New York City of editor-essayist Laurence Hutton, Rogers and Mark Twain first saw Helen Keller, then sixteen years old. Although she had been made blind and deaf by illness as a young child, she had been reached by her teacher-companion, Anne Sullivan. When she was 20, Keller passed with distinction the entrance examination to Radcliffe College. Twain praised &quot;this marvelous child&quot; and hoped that Helen would not be forced to retire from her studies because of poverty. He urged the Rogerses to aid Keller and to solicit other Standard Oil chiefs to help her. Rogers helped pay for her education at Radcliffe and arranged a monthly stipend.

Keller dedicated her book, &quot;The World I Live In&quot;, &quot;To Henry H. Rogers, my Dear Friend of Many Years.&quot; On the fly leaf of Rogers&#x27;s copy, she wrote: 

&quot;To Mrs Rogers The best of the world I live in is the kindness of friends like you and Mr Rogers&quot;

===Booker T. Washington===
Around 1894, Rogers attended one of Booker T. Washington&#x27;s speeches at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The next day, Rogers contacted the educator and invited him to his offices. They had common ground in relatively humble beginnings and became strong friends. Washington became a frequent visitor to Rogers&#x27; office, his 85-room mansion in Fairhaven, and the yacht.

Although Rogers had died suddenly a few weeks earlier, in June 1909 Dr. Washington went on a previously arranged speaking tour along the newly completed Virginian Railway. He rode in Rogers&#x27; personal rail car, &quot;Dixie&quot;, making speeches at many locations over a seven-day period. Washington said Rogers had urged the trip to explore how to improve race relations and economic conditions for African Americans along the route of the new railway. It connected many previously isolated rural communities in the southern portions of Virginia and West Virginia.

Washington told about Rogers&#x27; philanthropy: &quot;funding the operation of at least 65 small country schools for the education and betterment of African Americans in Virginia and other portions of the South, all unknown to the recipients.&quot; Rogers had also generously provided support to Tuskegee Institute and Hampton Institute. Rogers supported projects with at least partial matching funds, in order to achieve more work, and to ensure recipients were also stakeholders.

==Legacy==

In Fairhaven, the Rogers family gifts are located throughout the town. These include Rogers School, Town Hall, Millicent Library, Unitarian Memorial Church, and Fairhaven High School. A granite shaft on the High School lawn is dedicated to Rogers. In Riverside Cemetery, the Henry Huttleston Rogers Mausoleum is patterned after the Temple of Minerva in Athens, Greece. Henry, his first wife Abbie, and several family members are interred there.

In 1916, Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company launched the SS &quot;H.H. Rogers&quot;, a &quot;Pratt&quot;-class tanker of 8,807 tons with a capacity of of oil. It was operated by Panama Transport Co., a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey. During World War II, on February 21, 1943, it was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in the North Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland while en route from Liverpool, England to the United States. All 73 persons aboard were saved.

In Virginia and West Virginia, former employees, area residents, and enthusiasts of the Virginian Railway consider the entire railroad to have been a memorial to him. Almost 50 years after it was merged into a competitor, Rogers&#x27; railroad has a remarkable following. One of the most active Yahoo! railway enthusiasts groups has more than 800 members. A passenger station has been restored in Suffolk, Virginia, a replica built and museum established in Princeton, West Virginia, and work is underway on a larger former VGN station in Roanoke.

In 2004, volunteers engraved Rogers&#x27; initials (and those of VGN co-founder William Nelson Page) into new rail laid in Victoria, Virginia. It carries a VGN Class 10-A caboose, built by the company and restored by members of the National Railway Historical Society (NRHS) chapter in Roanoke. Fully equipped, it offers an interpretive display of the business conducted in a caboose along the historic right-of-way.

<text>Rudolph Arthur Marcus (born July 21, 1923) is a Canadian-born American chemist who received the 1992 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his contributions to the theory of electron transfer reactions in chemical systems&quot;. Marcus theory, named after him, provides a thermodynamic and kinetic framework for describing one electron outer-sphere electron transfer. He is a professor at Caltech, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science.

== Education and early life ==
Marcus was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Esther (born Cohen) and Myer Marcus. His father was born in New York and his mother was born in England. His family background is from Ukmergė (Lithuania). He is Jewish and grew up mostly in a Jewish neighborhood in Montreal but also spent some of his childhood in Detroit, United States. His interest in the sciences began at a young age. He excelled at mathematics at Baron Byng High School. He then studied at McGill University under Carl A. Winkler, who had studied under Cyril Hinshelwood at the University of Oxford. At McGill, Marcus took more math courses than an average chemistry student, which would later aid him in creating his theory on electron transfer.

Marcus earned a B.Sc. in 1943 and a Ph.D. in 1946, both from McGill University. In 1958, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

== Career and research ==
After graduating, in 1946, he took postdoctoral positions first at the National Research Council (Canada), followed by the University of North Carolina. He received his first faculty appointment at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. In 1952, at the University of North Carolina, he developed Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) theory by combining the former RRK theory with the transition state theory. In 1964, he taught at the University of Illinois. His approach to solving a problem is to &quot;go full tilt.&quot; Marcus moved to the California Institute of Technology in 1978.

=== Marcus theory of electron transfer ===
Electron transfer is one of the simplest forms of a chemical reaction. It consists of one outer-sphere electron transfer between substances of the same atomic structure likewise to Marcus’s studies between divalent and trivalent iron ions. Electron transfer may be one of the most basic forms of chemical reaction but without it life cannot exist. Electron transfer is used in all respiratory functions as well as photosynthesis. In the process of oxidizing food molecules, two hydrogen ions, two electrons, and half an oxygen molecule react to make an exothermic reaction as well as a water molecule: 

: 2 H+ + 2 e− + ½ O2 → H2O + heat

Because electron transfer is such a broad, common, and essential reaction within nature, Marcus&#x27;s theory has become vital within the field of chemistry and biochemistry.

A type of chemical reaction linked to his many studies of electron transfer would be the transfer of an electron between metal ions in different states of oxidation. An example of this type of chemical reaction would be one between a divalent and a trivalent iron ion in an aqueous solution. In Marcus&#x27;s time chemists were astonished at the slow rate in which this specific reaction took place. This attracted many chemists in the 1950s and is also what began Marcus&#x27;s interests in electron transfer. Marcus made many studies based on the principles that were found within this chemical reaction, and through his studies was able to elaborate his electron transfer theory. His approach gave way to new experimental programs that contributed to all branches within chemistry and biochemistry.

As of his 100th birthday, he is still active doing research.

== Honors and awards ==
Marcus was awarded honorary degrees from the University of Chicago in 1983, the University of Goteborg in 1986, the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1987, McGill University in 1988, Queen&#x27;s University in 1993, the University of New Brunswick in 1993, the University of Oxford in 1995, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1996, the Yokohama National University in 1996, the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1997, the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in 1998, the Technical University of Valencia in 1999, Northwestern University in 2000, the University of Waterloo in 2002, the Nanyang Technological University in 2010, the Tumkur University in 2012, the University of Hyderabad in 2012, and the University of Calgary in 2013. In addition, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Santiago, Chile in 2018.

Among the awards he received before the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1992, Marcus received the Irving Langmuir Prize in Chemical Physics in 1978, the Robinson Award of the Faraday Division of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1982, Columbia University&#x27;s Chandler Award in 1983, the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 1984-1985, the Centenary Prize, the Willard Gibbs Award and the Peter Debye Award in 1988, the National Medal of Science in 1989, Ohio State&#x27;s William Lloyd Evans Award in 1990, the Theodore William Richards Award (NESACS) in 1990, the Pauling Medal, the Remsen Award and the Edgar Fahs Smith Lecturer in 1991, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement and the Hirschfelder Prize in Theoretical Chemistry in 1993.

He also received a professorial fellowship at University College, Oxford, from 1975 to 1976.

He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1970, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1973, the American Philosophical Society in 1990, received honorary membership in the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1991, and in the Royal Society of Canada in 1993. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1987.

In 2019, he was awarded with the Fray International Sustainability award at SIPS 2019 by FLOGEN Star Outreach.

<doc id="424412" wikidata="Q238306" url="?curid=424412" title="White tea">
<text>White tea may refer to one of several styles of tea which generally feature young or minimally processed leaves of the &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; plant.

Currently there is no generally accepted definition of white tea and very little international agreement on how it can be defined. Some sources use the term to refer tea that is merely dried with no additional processing. Therefore, white tea is very close to the natural state of the tea plant. Other sources use the term to refer to tea made from the buds and immature tea leaves picked shortly before the buds have fully opened and allowed to wither and dry under the sun, while others include tea buds and very young leaves which have been steamed or fired before drying. Most definitions agree, however, that white tea is not rolled or oxidized, resulting in a flavor characterized as &quot;lighter&quot; than most green or traditional black teas.

In spite of its name, brewed white tea is pale yellow. Its name derives from the fine silvery-white hairs on the unopened buds of the tea plant, which give the plant a whitish appearance. The unopened buds are used for some types of white tea.

It is harvested primarily in China, mostly in the Fujian province, but more recently produced in Taiwan, Eastern Nepal, Thailand, Galle (Southern Sri Lanka) and northeast India.

== History ==
What is today known as white tea may have come into creation in the last two centuries; scholars and tea merchants generally disagree as to when the first production of white tea (as it is understood in China today) began. White tea may have first appeared in English publication in 1876, where it was categorized as a black tea, because the leaves are not steamed first as in the making of green tea in order to denature intrinsic oxidative enzymes.

White tea is often sold as &quot;Silvery Tip Pekoe&quot; in the style of the tea leaf grading system, as well as under the simple designations &quot;China White&quot; and &quot;Fujian White&quot;.

Some tea from the related wild &quot;Camellia taliensis&quot; in Yunnan is made using white tea processing techniques.

== Composition ==
White tea, like black and green tea, is made from the &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; plant and contains polyphenols, a set of phytonutrients that are thought to be responsible for the health effects of tea. Different white teas have different amounts of catechins, a category of polyphenols, and the overall range of concentrations overlaps with that of green tea, meaning that some white teas have the same concentration of polyphenols as some green teas. This may be due to the variety of the tea plant from which the tea was picked, the cultivation technique, and the way in which the tea was processed.

=== Caffeine content ===
White tea generally contains less caffeine than green or black tea. However, the exact amount can vary depending on several factors such as the type of tea, how it&#x27;s brewed, and the brand. Here&#x27;s a general comparison:

White Tea: The caffeine content in white tea can range from 6 to 55 mg per cup (250 mL)

Green Tea: A 250mL cup of green tea contains around 30 mg of caffeine

Black Tea: The caffeine content in black tea is around 50 mg per cup (250 mL)

== Manufacturing ==
The base process for manufacturing white tea is as follows:
:Fresh tea leaf → withering → drying (air drying, solar drying or mechanical drying) → white tea

White tea belongs to the group of tea that does not require panning, rolling or shaking. However, the selection of raw material in white tea manufacture is extremely stringent; only the plucking of young tea leaves with much fine hair can produce good-quality white tea of a high pekoe (grading) value.

=== Plucking Style ===
Four primary plucking styles exist for Chinese white teas. The first, and highest quality, Baihao Yinzhen, is just the bud of the tea plant. Bai Mudan white tea is typically composed of one bud and two leaves. Gongmei white tea is similar to Bai Mudan, but includes three to four leaves. The lowest grade of white tea, Shoumei, has many leaves and few buds.

== Popular types of white tea ==
* Bai Mudan (white peony) 
* Shou Mei tea
* Silver Needle tea

<doc id="424417" wikidata="Q171397" url="?curid=424417" title="Eddie Irvine">
<text>Edmund &quot;Eddie&quot; Irvine Jr. (; born 10 November 1965) is a former racing driver from Northern Ireland, who competed under the British flag in Formula One from to . Irvine was runner-up in the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Ferrari, and won four Grands Prix across 10 seasons.

Irvine began his career at the age of seventeen when he entered Formula Ford, achieving early success, before progressing to the Formula Three and Formula 3000 Championships. He made his Formula One debut in 1993 with Jordan Grand Prix, where he achieved early notoriety for his involvement in incidents on and off the track. He scored his first podium in with Jordan, before moving to Ferrari in . His most successful season was in 1999 when he took four victories and finished second in the World Championship, two points behind McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen. In his four years with Ferrari he also finished fourth overall in and scored 22 podiums. He moved to Jaguar Racing in , scoring the team&#x27;s first podium in and his final podium in 2002. Irvine retired from competitive motorsport at the end of the 2002 season. , Irvine jointly holds the record with four drivers (Lando Norris, Mika Häkkinen, Jean Alesi and Patrick Depailler) for scoring the most podiums before winning a Grand Prix (15).

Since retiring, Irvine became a media personality in Great Britain. He was linked with the takeover of the Jordan and Minardi Formula One teams in 2005, but talks came to nothing. Irvine also expanded his interests in the property market, having built up an investment portfolio during his racing career.

==Early life and career==
Irvine was born on 10 November 1965 in Newtownards, County Down in Northern Ireland, to Edmund Sr. and Kathleen. He grew up in the village of Conlig and was educated at Regent House Grammar School in Newtownards. He has one older sister, Sonia, who acted as Irvine&#x27;s physiotherapist until 1999. Irvine&#x27;s first taste of motorsport came when his family spent their holidays attending the British Grand Prix. His father also raced in single-seaters for fun. His childhood hero was countryman John Watson.

Irvine began to compete with racing cars in 1983. He was initially interested in motorcycle racing, but his parents thought the sport too dangerous and was encouraged by his father to race in Formula Ford. Irvine worked unpaid in his father&#x27;s scrapyard, in return for which, his father funded his racing hobby. He won his first race at Brands Hatch in 1984, and an award for best driver. In 1987 he joined the Van Diemen team and won the Esso Formula Ford series, the RAC Formula Ford series, and the Formula Ford Festival.

In the winter of 1987, Marlboro organised a test in which the fastest driver would be offered a drive for the following British Formula 3 season. Irvine was that driver and joined West Surrey Racing for 1988. It was a season without any success and Irvine ended it in fifth place. He raced at the Macau Grand Prix for the first time and started the race from pole position, but failed to finish. In 1989 Irvine competed in the International Formula 3000 Championship with Pacific Racing. Irvine finished the season in ninth place, ahead of teammate JJ Lehto in thirteenth, who was then considered to be a promising young driver.

In 1990 he joined the Jordan Formula 3000 team. He won in Germany and ended the season in third place, beating his teammates Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Emanuele Naspetti. Irvine finished on the podium at both the Macau Grand Prix and the Fuji F3 Cup. At the end of the season Irvine moved to Japan to compete in that country&#x27;s Formula 3000 championship. In 1991 he raced for Cerumo Racing and won one race and amassed 14 points to finish seventh in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Irvine&#x27;s first race at the 24 Hours of Le Mans was in 1992 driving a SARD Toyota Group C car alongside Roland Ratzenberger and Eje Elgh. The team finished ninth overall and came second in the Group C class.

==Formula One career==

===Jordan (1993–1995)===

====1993====
Irvine made his Formula One debut in the penultimate race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix, partnering Rubens Barrichello at the Jordan Grand Prix team. He made an immediate impact, not only by scoring a point with sixth place, but by unlapping himself against race leader, and subsequent winner, Ayrton Senna. After the race, Senna, angry at what he perceived to be &quot;unprofessional&quot; driving, approached Irvine in the Jordan hospitality unit, and following an altercation, threw a punch at Irvine, for which he received a suspended two-race ban. Irvine retired from the final race in Australia with accident damage. After two races, Irvine finished 22nd in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with his sole point.

Irvine raced at the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the second time, driving a Toyota Group C car alongside Toshio Suzuki and Masanori Sekiya. The team finished fourth overall.

====1994====

Irvine remained at Jordan for 1994 and was again partnered by Barrichello. At the opening round in Brazil, Irvine was involved in a four car crash. He later received a one-race ban and a $10,000 fine by the race stewards. Irvine appealed to the FIA against the decision, but his appeal was rejected on 6 April, and the penalty increased to a three-race ban. His seat was filled by Aguri Suzuki for the following Pacific Grand Prix, and Andrea de Cesaris for the races in San Marino and Monaco.

Irvine returned for the Spanish Grand Prix where he scored his first points of the season with sixth place. Five consecutive retirements followed, and he was unable to finish the Belgian Grand Prix due to an alternator failure, although he was classified 13th due to having completed over 90% of the race distance. Irvine retired from the Italian Grand Prix due to an engine failure and was later given a one-race ban, suspended for three races, for an incident with Team Lotus driver Johnny Herbert on the opening lap.

Irvine garnered further controversy during the first qualifying session of the Portuguese Grand Prix when he clipped Williams driver Damon Hill. Hill&#x27;s car flipped upside down, but he escaped unhurt. Irvine was warned a similar incident would see his Super Licence revoked. He took consecutive points scoring finishes in the next two races—fourth at the European Grand Prix and fifth at the Japanese Grand Prix. Irvine retired from the season closing race in Australia when he spun off. He finished the year 16th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 6 points.

Outside of Formula One, Irvine participated in his third consecutive 24 Hours of Le Mans as a substitute for the late Roland Ratzenberger, who died after crashing in qualifying for the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, driving for SARD alongside Mauro Martini and Jeff Krosnoff. The team were leading with 90 minutes to go when a gearbox issue forced the car to slow, costing them victory. They finished second overall and first in the LMP1/C90 class.

====1995====

Irvine remained at Jordan for and was again partnered by Barrichello. It was a bad start: Irvine was forced into retirement at the opening race, in Brazil, due to a gearbox actuator problem. In the following race in Argentina he was involved in a first-lap collision with McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen, and retired with an engine failure after only six laps. He finished eighth at the San Marino Grand Prix, and scored points with a fifth-place finish in Spain. Irvine secured the first podium of his Formula One career with third place in Canada. At the Belgian Grand Prix, his car caught fire during a pitstop as the fuel valve was jammed open, and although uninjured, he was forced to retire from the race.

In the week before the European Grand Prix, Jordan announced that Irvine would be retained on a two-year contract. However, Ferrari then announced that it had bought out Irvine&#x27;s contract, and that he would be partnering Michael Schumacher at the team for 1996. He fared well in the race by finishing sixth, although he finished outside the points in the Pacific Grand Prix. Irvine scored his final points of the season with a fifth in Japan, and finished the season with a retirement in Australia, due to pneumatic pressure. He finished the year 12th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 10 points.

===Ferrari (1996–1999)===

====1996====

At the season opener in Australia, Irvine finished in third place, where he started, after out-qualifying new teammate, and then double World Champion, Michael Schumacher. At the following race in Brazil he finished outside the points in seventh position, and took fifth in Argentina. At the European Grand Prix he was involved in an incident with Olivier Panis, resulting in both drivers retiring from the race. Fourth place in the San Marino Grand Prix preceded eight consecutive retirements, due to unreliability or being involved in racing incidents. Irvine finished the Portuguese Grand Prix in fifth, but retired again from the final race of the season at Suzuka. Irvine finished tenth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 11 points.

====1997====
The first race of the season in Australia saw Irvine involved in a race ending first lap crash with Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve. Two races later, he finished a career high second place in Argentina, where Irvine challenged Villeneuve for the lead, who was suffering with a stomach ailment, and his car with brake problems. The result ended demands in the Italian press for Irvine to be sacked. Two consecutive third places in San Marino and Monaco, gave Irvine his best string of finishes to date. At the Spanish Grand Prix Irvine finished only twelfth and was given a 10-second stop-go penalty, after he held up Olivier Panis and Jean Alesi when running a lap down.

At the Canadian Grand Prix Irvine was involved in another first lap incident, this time with McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen. He was back on the podium with third place at the French Grand Prix, before a run of seven races where he was either out of the points or out of the race. During the summer, it was announced that Irvine would remain at Ferrari for 1998. His run of poor results ended with a third-place finish at the Japanese Grand Prix, and he concluded the season with a fifth place at the European Grand Prix. Irvine finished seventh in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 24 points.

====1998====
Irvine remained at Ferrari for and was again partnered with Schumacher. Irvine&#x27;s fitness level was placed in doubt when he suffered from back pain. To combat the issue, a new seat was installed in his car. Irvine had very little running in the new Ferrari F300 during pre-season testing, and was concerned with the tyre war between Goodyear, Ferrari&#x27;s tyre supplier, and Bridgestone, but was nevertheless confident about his chances over the coming season. At the first race of the season in Australia Irvine finished in fourth, and in the following race in Brazil, outside the points in eighth place. Irvine finished on the podium six times in the next seven races, including a second-place finish in France, behind teammate Schumacher.

In July, it was announced Irvine had signed a two-year extension to his contract. The contract stipulated that Irvine was permitted to choose his own strategy and setup, although he would remain in a supporting role to Schumacher. After two retirements in the next three races, Irvine finished the season with three points scoring finishes, including two second places in Italy and Japan. Irvine finished the season fourth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 47 points.

====1999====

For 1999, Irvine was confident heading into the season, saying: &quot;After last year&#x27;s results where I got my best ever championship finish with fourth place overall, now, for this year, I want to do even better&quot;. His season got off to a good start: after 81 Grand Prix, Irvine scored his maiden Formula One victory at the season opening round in Australia, giving him the lead of the World Drivers&#x27; Championship for the first time. In the following race in Brazil an unscheduled pitstop, due to blocked radiators, cost Irvine a podium finish, and he ultimately finished fifth. Three weeks later in the San Marino Grand Prix, Irvine would miss out on another podium finish, after his car suffered an engine failure on lap 47 (of 62) while in a comfortable third place, losing him the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship to teammate Schumacher. Irvine finished second at Monaco and set the fastest lap (his career one and only) and survived a collision with McLaren driver David Coulthard on the way to a third-place finish in Canada.

On the first lap of the British Grand Prix, which Irvine finished in second place, Schumacher broke his right leg in a crash at the high-speed Stowe Corner when his car&#x27;s rear brakes failed. Irvine assumed the role of team leader and was partnered by Finnish driver Mika Salo for the next six races. Irvine won the next race in Austria and was gifted the win by Mika Salo a week later in Germany, helping him to regain the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship. A further podium finish in Hungary followed, where he struggled with oversteer. In September it was announced that Irvine would move to the Jaguar team, which had purchased Stewart Grand Prix in June, and would be partnered by Johnny Herbert. Irvine finished out of the points in seventh place at the European Grand Prix after enduring an embarrassing 48-second pitstop while his mechanics searched for a missing tyre as they only had three ready for him when he came in.

Schumacher returned from injury at the penultimate race of the season, in Malaysia, and in a remarkable display, helped Irvine to win his fourth race of the season and head another Ferrari one-two, ahead of Häkkinen. Both Ferraris were later disqualified as it was discovered their car&#x27;s bargeboards did not comply with Formula One&#x27;s technical regulations. Ferrari appealed to the FIA, and it was held five days after the race, on 22 October. The following day, it was announced that the Court of Appeal overturned the decision, ensuring a Championship showdown at Suzuka. At the final race of the season in Japan, Irvine struggled in qualifying and crashed heavily, managing only fifth place; in the race he finished third, over a minute and a half behind Schumacher in second, and race winner Häkkinen. Irvine lost the Drivers&#x27; Championship to Häkkinen by just 2 points, but Irvine&#x27;s efforts during the season helped Ferrari to clinch their first World Constructors&#x27; Championship in 16 years.

Irvine was awarded the Hawthorn Memorial Trophy, an annual award given to the most successful British or Commonwealth driver in Formula One over the course of one season. He was also named &quot;Autosport&quot; British Competition Driver of the Year for 1999.

===Jaguar (2000–2002)===

====2000====

Former British racing driver Stirling Moss aired doubts over Irvine&#x27;s hopes to be a championship contender at Jaguar over the coming season. Former British World Drivers&#x27; Champion Jackie Stewart, said: &quot;He really has come together. He&#x27;s been in the shadow of a number one driver at Ferrari. I think it was time that he shed that shadow and went on to race for himself.&quot; Irvine endured a torrid start: At the opening two races held in Australia and Brazil, Irvine suffered consecutive retirements due to spinning out. However, he later managed to finish in the next three races, albeit outside of the points scoring positions. He retired from the European Grand Prix from a collision with Williams driver Ralf Schumacher after spinning from being overtaken by Arrows driver Jos Verstappen. At the next race in Monaco, Irvine scored Jaguar&#x27;s first points with fourth place.

He was forced to withdraw from the Austrian Grand Prix due to abdominal pains caused by a bout of appendicitis although he participated in the event&#x27;s first free practice session. He was replaced by the team&#x27;s test driver Luciano Burti. Irvine was passed fit for the German Grand Prix, where he secured tenth position despite a spin. He was unable to score further points in the next five races, which included a retirement in Italy when he collided with Salo on the first lap. He finished off the season by finishing the final three races which included a sixth-place points scoring finish at the season closing Malaysian Grand Prix. Irvine finished the season 13th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship and scored four points. Outside of Formula One, Irvine took part in the Belfast City Open and Direct Millennium Motorsport Festival driving a Jaguar sportscar to celebrate the marque&#x27;s participation in the Tourist Trophy.

====2001====

Irvine remained at Jaguar for 2001 and was partnered by Luciano Burti. Despite his vocal frustrations, Jaguar team principal Bobby Rahal backed Irvine for the upcoming season, although Irvine was not confident citing his uncertainty about his team becoming competitive which he has made vocal. Rahal became concerned over Irvine&#x27;s attitude when the team&#x27;s car, the Jaguar R2, was underperforming during pre-season testing. Irvine supported the view of being sacked at the end of the season if his performances did not satisfy the team. Irvine clinched 11th place in the first round in Australia and failed to finish in the next four consecutive races. Before the Spanish Grand Prix, Burti left Jaguar to join the Prost team so Irvine was partnered with Pedro de la Rosa. Irvine took Jaguar&#x27;s first podium finish with third place in the following round in Monaco. In June, it was confirmed that Irvine and de la Rosa would be retained by Jaguar for 2002.

Despite this success, Irvine failed to finish five of the next eight races. He suffered from a neck strain at a test session at Silverstone and took time resting during the summer break. During this period, Rahal attempted to sell Irvine to the Jordan team with an additional $10 million to Irvine&#x27;s salary. Irvine rejected the contract as he wanted to help Jaguar become more competitive. The contract, originally mooted by Rahal as a joke, led to his sacking and he was replaced by Austrian World Champion Niki Lauda. At the Belgian Grand Prix, Irvine was involved in a collision with Burti who was trying to overtake him. Burti crashed at over 240 km/h and absolved any blame placed upon Irvine. Irvine managed to clinch his final points of the season with fifth in the United States and ended the season by retiring from the Japanese Grand Prix from a failure of his car&#x27;s power generators on the fuel rig. Irvine finished the season 12th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship having scored six points.

====2002====

Irvine remained at Jaguar for 2002 and was again partnered by de la Rosa. In preparation for the upcoming season, Irvine undertook a fitness examination and recorded a high score. However, he was cautious about his team&#x27;s prospects going into the year, saying: &quot;We&#x27;ve just got to wait and see what happens with this car, that&#x27;s the question mark&quot;. At the opening round in Australia, Irvine finished fourth; and in the following race in Malaysia, he was forced to retire with an hydraulics problem. Irvine later managed to clinch seventh place in the Brazilian Grand Prix, before he suffered consecutive retirements in the next three races. He later finished the Monaco Grand Prix in ninth position, which was followed up with further consecutive retirements in the seven races. However, this marked a turning point as Irvine managed to finish in all of the remaining races. He was in the points scoring positions twice in this period—a sixth-place finish in Belgium and took his final career podium with third in Italy. He finished the season ninth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with eight points.

During the season, friction developed between Irvine and his team due to his vocal frustration at the lack of development of his car. He considered a return to his former team Jordan for the 2003 season, with no agreement reached due to the team&#x27;s financial problems. Irvine also denied rumours that he would move into either the CART World Series or the IndyCar Series.

==Post-Formula One (2003–present)==

In 2002, Irvine successfully sued TalkSport Radio for passing off his image in a print advertisement, as if he had personally endorsed the station. The case, the first UK legal decision in which a passing-off action had succeeded in a false endorsement case, was resolved in the Court of Appeal in 2003. Eight years later, Irvine fronted a half-hour programme on the station, the LG Grand Prix Show, alongside regular Sunday evening presenter Andy Goldstein.

On 24 July 2003, Irvine was arrested after being caught driving a scooter over 30 mph through Hyde Park without a licence or insurance. He was to be sentenced at Bow Street Magistrates but did not attend. An arrest warrant with bail was issued.

Irvine played himself in the 2004 comedy &quot;The Prince &amp; Me&quot;, which starred Julia Stiles. He was executive producer of a film produced about Paddy Mayne. In late 2006 he launched a new television programme on the Sky One channel called &quot;The Race&quot;, in which two teams of celebrity racing drivers competed against each other. David Coulthard was captain and coach of the &quot;girls&quot; team, and Irvine of the &quot;boys&quot;.

In May 2005, Irvine was rumoured to be heading a consortium to buy the Jordan Grand Prix team, and stated his interest in running the team. He was later linked to a possible sale of the Minardi team and held talks with team principal Paul Stoddart.

Irvine was a millionaire through property investment before reaching Formula One. He has a multi-million pound property portfolio, owning around forty properties throughout the world. According to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List, published in April 2006, Irvine was the fifth richest person of Northern Ireland at that time, having increased his personal fortune to approximately £160 million. He is also the owner of &quot;Eddie Irvine Sports&quot;, a snooker, pool, kart racing, paintballing, and football facility in Bangor, close to his native Conlig.

Before pulling out because of a leg injury, Irvine was due to be one of the celebrities taking part in the 2006 ITV &quot;Soccer Aid&quot;. In aid of UNICEF, this television show featured an England vs the rest of the world football match, with teams made up of a mix of celebrities and ex-professionals.

On 9 January 2014, Irvine was sentenced to six months in prison in Italy after being found guilty of &quot;mutual injury&quot; following a brawl in a night club in Milan, Italy with Gabriele Moratti, son of former mayor of Milan Letizia Moratti. Moratti&#x27;s lawyer Vincenzo Saponara told the media that the sentence was likely to be suspended and that neither man would go to jail.

==Nationality==
By virtue of being from Northern Ireland, a constituent country of the United Kingdom, Irvine was a British citizen throughout his career. He also held a racing licence issued by the National Sporting Authority of the Republic of Ireland (drivers are not compelled to obtain their licence from their home country). The FIA&#x27;s International Sporting Regulations state that drivers competing in FIA World Championships shall compete under the nationality of their passport, rather than that of the National Sporting Authority that issued their racing licence, as is the case in other racing series. Relating to Irvine&#x27;s nationality, the FIA repeatedly mistakenly issued official entry lists that claimed Irvine was competing under the Irish nationality (e.g. entry list for the 1995 and 1996 season).

This situation created some confusion as to Irvine&#x27;s nationality when he appeared at podium ceremonies in the Formula One World Championship. During some of his early podium appearances (at the 1995 Canadian Grand Prix, 1996 Australian Grand Prix, 1997 Argentine Grand Prix and 1997 Monaco Grand Prix), an Irish Tricolour was mistakenly flown by the race organisers. After the 1997 Argentine Grand Prix his family received threatening phone calls. Irvine then requested that at subsequent races, a politically neutral shamrock flag be flown, and the non-sectarian &quot;Londonderry Air&quot; be played to mark a victory.

Irvine has self-identified as being Irish:
==Personal life==

Irvine named his biggest influence as his former girlfriend Maria Drummond, whom he met at the Macau Grand Prix in 1988. The pair remained friends for a year, staying in regular contact, until the relationship became deeper when Drummond split up from her boyfriend. From the relationship Irvine has a daughter, Zoe. He said that the birth of his daughter was the best moment of his life, despite not being a natural lover of babies.

Irvine is seen by many as a playboy in the mould of James Hunt, in contrast to the sport&#x27;s modern stars, most of whom are seen as staid and less flamboyant. Irvine is also remembered for his tendency to speak his mind, often to the irritation of some. Despite this, Irvine does not consider himself to be a playboy stating his life is &quot;90% work&quot;. He was nicknamed &quot;Irv the Swerve&quot; and later &quot;Fast Eddie&quot;.

<text>Accelerator physics is a branch of applied physics, concerned with designing, building and operating particle accelerators. As such, it can be described as the study of motion, manipulation and observation of relativistic charged particle beams and their interaction with accelerator structures by electromagnetic fields.

It is also related to other fields:
*Microwave engineering (for acceleration/deflection structures in the radio frequency range).
*Optics with an emphasis on geometrical optics (beam focusing and bending) and laser physics (laser-particle interaction).
*Computer technology with an emphasis on digital signal processing; e.g., for automated manipulation of the particle beam.
*Plasma physics, for the description of intense beams.

The experiments conducted with particle accelerators are not regarded as part of accelerator physics, but belong (according to the objectives of the experiments) to, e.g., particle physics, nuclear physics, condensed matter physics or materials physics. The types of experiments done at a particular accelerator facility are determined by characteristics of the generated particle beam such as average energy, particle type, intensity, and dimensions.

==Acceleration and interaction of particles with RF structures==


While it is possible to accelerate charged particles using electrostatic fields, like in a Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier, this method has limits given by electrical breakdown at high voltages. Furthermore, due to electrostatic fields being conservative, the maximum voltage limits the kinetic energy that is applicable to the particles.

To circumvent this problem, linear particle accelerators operate using time-varying fields. To control this fields using hollow macroscopic structures through which the particles are passing (wavelength restrictions), the frequency of such acceleration fields is located in the radio frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The space around a particle beam is evacuated to prevent scattering with gas atoms, requiring it to be enclosed in a vacuum chamber (or &quot;beam pipe&quot;). Due to the strong electromagnetic fields that follow the beam, it is possible for it to interact with any electrical impedance in the walls of the beam pipe. This may be in the form of a resistive impedance (i.e., the finite resistivity of the beam pipe material) or an inductive/capacitive impedance (due to the geometric changes in the beam pipe&#x27;s cross section).

These impedances will induce &quot;wakefields&quot; (a strong warping of the electromagnetic field of the beam) that can interact with later particles. Since this interaction may have negative effects, it is studied to determine its magnitude, and to determine any actions that may be taken to mitigate it.

==Beam dynamics==
Due to the high velocity of the particles, and the resulting Lorentz force for magnetic fields, adjustments to the beam direction are mainly controlled by magnetostatic fields that deflect particles. In most accelerator concepts (excluding compact structures like the cyclotron or betatron), these are applied by dedicated electromagnets with different properties and functions. An important step in the development of these types of accelerators was the understanding of strong focusing. Dipole magnets are used to guide the beam through the structure, while quadrupole magnets are used for beam focusing, and sextupole magnets are used for correction of dispersion effects.

A particle on the exact design trajectory (or design &quot;orbit&quot;) of the accelerator only experiences dipole field components, while particles with transverse position deviation formula_1 are re-focused to the design orbit. For preliminary calculations, neglecting all fields components higher than quadrupolar, an inhomogenic Hill differential equation

:formula_2

can be used as an approximation, with
:a non-constant focusing force formula_3, including strong focusing and weak focusing effects
:the relative deviation from the design beam impulse formula_4
:the trajectory radius of curvature formula_5, and
:the design path length formula_6,
thus identifying the system as a parametric oscillator. Beam parameters for the accelerator can then be calculated using Ray transfer matrix analysis; e.g., a quadrupolar field is analogous to a lens in geometrical optics, having similar properties regarding beam focusing (but obeying Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem).

The general equations of motion originate from relativistic Hamiltonian mechanics, in almost all cases using the Paraxial approximation. Even in the cases of strongly nonlinear magnetic fields, and without the paraxial approximation, a Lie transform may be used to construct an integrator with a high degree of accuracy.

==Modeling Codes==

There are many different software packages available for modeling the different aspects of accelerator physics.
One must model the elements that create the electric and magnetic fields, and then one must model the charged particle evolution within those fields.

==Beam diagnostics==
A vital component of any accelerator are the diagnostic devices that allow various properties of the particle bunches to be measured.

A typical machine may use many different types of measurement device in order to measure different properties. These include (but are not limited to) Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) to measure the position of the bunch, screens (fluorescent screens, Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) devices) to image the profile of the bunch, wire-scanners to measure its cross-section, and toroids or ICTs to measure the bunch charge (i.e., the number of particles per bunch).

While many of these devices rely on well understood technology, designing a device capable of measuring a beam for a particular machine is a complex task requiring much expertise. Not only is a full understanding of the physics of the operation of the device necessary, but it is also necessary to ensure that the device is capable of measuring the expected parameters of the machine under consideration.

Success of the full range of beam diagnostics often underpins the success of the machine as a whole.

==Machine tolerances==
Errors in the alignment of components, field strength, etc., are inevitable in machines of this scale, so it is important to consider the tolerances under which a machine may operate.

Engineers will provide the physicists with expected tolerances for the alignment and manufacture of each component to allow full physics simulations of the expected behaviour of the machine under these conditions. In many cases it will be found that the performance is degraded to an unacceptable level, requiring either re-engineering of the components, or the invention of algorithms that allow the machine performance to be &#x27;tuned&#x27; back to the design level.

This may require many simulations of different error conditions in order to determine the relative success of each tuning algorithm, and to allow recommendations for the collection of algorithms to be deployed on the real machine.

<text>The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), abbreviated as 160th SOAR(A), is a special operations force of the United States Army that provides helicopter aviation support for special operations forces. Its missions have included attack, assault, and reconnaissance, and these missions are usually conducted at night, at high speeds, low altitudes, and on short notice.

Nicknamed the Night Stalkers and called Task Force Brown within the JSOC, the 160th SOAR(A) is headquartered at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

== Overview ==
The 160th SOAR(A) consists of some of the Army&#x27;s best-qualified aviators, crew chiefs, and support soldiers. Officers are all volunteers; enlisted soldiers volunteer or are assigned by the U.S. Army Human Resources Command. Until 2013, only men were allowed to be pilots in the 160th.

Upon joining the 160th, all soldiers are assigned to &quot;Green Platoon&quot;, in which they receive intensive training in &quot;advanced methods of the five basic combat skills: first responder, land navigation, combatives, weapons and teamwork&quot;. The weapons training includes firing thousands of rounds with AK-47/AK-74 rifles, Beretta M9 pistols, M4/M4A1 carbines, and SIG Sauer M17/M18 pistols. Soldiers who fail to pass the course the first time may retake it, but there is no guarantee that anyone assigned to Green Platoon will pass and continue on with the 160th. The basic Night Stalker course for enlisted soldiers lasts five weeks; the officer course lasts 20 to 28 weeks.

A new Night Stalker pilot arrives at a unit as Basic Mission Qualified (BMQ). After a series of skills test qualifications, experience, leadership, and oral review boards lasting up to three years, the Night Stalker is designated Fully Mission Qualified (FMQ). After three to five years as an FMQ, the Night Stalker may try out for flight lead qualification.

SOAR flight medics can qualify as special operations combat medics by completing the 36-week long Special Operations Combat Medic (SOCM) course at Fort Bragg.

== History ==
=== 1980s and 1990s ===
After the April 1980 Operation Eagle Claw attempt to rescue American hostages held in Tehran, Iran, failed, President Jimmy Carter ordered former Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James L. Holloway III to figure out how the U.S. military could best mount another attempt. At the time there were no U.S. helicopter units trained in this kind of stealthy, short-notice Special Operations mission.

The Army looked to the 101st Aviation Group, the air arm of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), which had the most diverse operating experience of the service&#x27;s helicopter units, and selected elements of the 158th Aviation Battalion, 101st Aviation Battalion, 229th Aviation Battalion, and the 159th Aviation Battalion. The chosen pilots immediately entered intensive training in night flying.

This provisional unit was dubbed Task Force 158, since most of its pilots were Black Hawk aviators detached from the 158th. Their distinctive 101st &quot;Screaming Eagle&quot; patches remained on their uniforms. The Black Hawks and Chinooks continued to operate around Campbell Army Airfield at the north of post, and Saber Army Heliport at the south. The OH-6 Cayuses, aircraft that had vanished from the division&#x27;s regular inventory after Vietnam, were hidden on base in an ammunition holding area still known as the &quot;SHOC Pad&quot;, for &quot;Special Helicopter Operations Company&quot;.

As the first batch of pilots completed training in the fall of 1980, a second attempt to rescue the hostages was planned for early 1981. Dubbed Operation Honey Badger, it was called off when the hostages were released on the morning of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s inauguration.

Task Force 158 was the Army&#x27;s only special operations aviation unit, and its members had already become recognized as the Army&#x27;s premier aviation night fighters. Their capability was judged too useful to lose, and so instead of returning to the 101st, the pilots and modified aircraft became a new unit. (Original members of the Night Stalkers refer to it as &quot;the day the Eagles came off&quot;.)

Originally created as Task Force 160 when the 101st Airborne Division was commanded by Jack V. Mackmull from June 1980 to August 1981. When the command was formally organized as a regiment, Mackmull was chosen to serve as its honorary colonel.

The unit was officially established on 16 October 1981, when it was designated as the 160th Aviation Battalion.

The 160th first saw combat during 1983&#x27;s Operation Urgent Fury, the U.S. invasion of Grenada.

In 1986, it was renamed the 160th Aviation Group (Airborne); and in May 1990, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne). As demand for highly trained special operations aviation assets bloomed, the regiment activated three battalions, a separate detachment, and incorporated one Army National Guard unit, the 1st Battalion, 245th Aviation (OK ARNG).

In 1987 and 1988, its pilots took part in Operation Earnest Will, the protection of re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf during the Iran–Iraq War. They flew from US Navy warships and leased oil barges in a secret sub-part called Operation Prime Chance, and became the first helicopter pilots to use night vision goggles and forward looking infrared (FLIR) devices in night combat.
In June 1988, the unit received a short-notice directive to recover a Soviet made Mi-25 Hind (Mi-24 Hind export version) attack helicopter from a remote location in Chad. The Hind was abandoned by the Libyans after 15 years of fighting, and was of great intelligence value to the U.S. In April 1988, two CH-47 Chinooks, a U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy, and 75 maintenance personnel and crew flew to White Sands AFB, New Mexico to rehearse the mission. In late May of that year an advance team went to Ndjamena, Chad, to await their aircraft. Two weeks later two Chinooks and 76 crew members and maintenance personnel arrived by C-5. At midnight on 11 June 1988, two MH-47s flew 490 miles at night without outside navigational aids to the target location, the Ouadi Doum Airfield in northern Chad. The first Chinook landed and configured the Hind, while the second hovered overhead and sling loaded it for return to Ndjamena. A surprise sandstorm slowed the return trip, but less than 67 hours after the arrival of the C-5 in Chad, the ground crew had the Hind and Chinooks aboard and ready for return to the U.S.

The Night Stalkers spearheaded Operation Just Cause, the 1989 invasion of Panama, and they were also used in Operation Desert Storm in 1991.
In October 1993 in Somalia, Night Stalkers became involved in the Battle of Mogadishu, which later became the subject of the book &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, and its film adaptation. Two Night Stalker Black Hawks, Super 6-1 (piloted by Cliff Wolcott), and Super 6-4 (piloted by Mike Durant), were shot down in the battle. Five of the eighteen men killed (not counting a nineteenth post-operation casualty) in the Battle of Mogadishu were members of the Night Stalkers team, who were lost along with the two Black Hawks.

=== Global War on Terrorism ===
==== 2001–2005 ====

During the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, the Night Stalkers from 2nd Battalion supported two task forces established in early October 2001: Dagger and Sword. (Their unit in TF Sword was designated Task Force Brown.) In the evening of 18 October into 19 October 2001, two SOAR MH-47E helicopters, escorted by MH-60L (Direct Action Penetrators) (DAPs), airlifted U.S. troops from the Karshi-Khanabad Air Base in Uzbekistan more than across the Hindu Kush mountains into Afghanistan.

The pilots of the Chinooks, flying in zero-visibility conditions, were refueled in flight three times during the 11-hour mission, establishing a new world record for combat rotorcraft. The troops—two 12-man Green Beret teams from the 5th Special Forces Group dubbed Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 555 and 595 plus four Air Force Combat Controllers—linked up with the CIA and Northern Alliance. Within a few weeks, the Northern Alliance, assisted by U.S. ground and air forces, captured several key cities from the Taliban.

In November 2001, Night Stalker AH-6J Little Birds took part in Objective Wolverine and Raptor missions and Operation Relentless Strike.
In December 2001, Night Stalker crews resupplied more than 150 Delta Force, British Special Boat Service, and CIA Special Activities Division operatives as they hunted for Osama bin Laden in the Tora Bora mountain complex.

On 21 February 2002, while scouting Islamist terrorists on Basilan Island as part of Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines and seeking to rescue a nurse and an American missionary couple, a MH-47 crashed at sea in the southern Philippines&#x27; Bohol Strait, killing 10 servicemen (eight from E company, 160th SOAR and two from the 353rd Special Operations Group).

In March 2002, Night Stalkers from B Company, 2nd Battalion, 160th SOAR supported coalition troops during Operation Anaconda, particularly at the Battle of Takur Ghar on 4 March, where one of their MH-47Es, callsign Razor 03, was damaged by rocket-propelled grenades and crash-landed carrying Mako 30. A second MH-47E, callsign Razor 01, responded to the shoot down with a Quick Reaction Force; it was damaged by small arms and rocket-propelled grenades, and crash-landed. One Night Stalker was killed in the battle.

On 21 June 2002 in the Philippines, Night Stalker MH-47Es were involved in the operation that killed Abu Sabaya, a senior leader in Abu Sayyef. A U.S. Predator drone marked the person with an infrared laser as he tried to escape in a smuggler&#x27;s boat. The MH-47Es trained searchlights on the boat while operators from the Philippine Naval Special Operations Group opened fire, killing the terrorist leader and capturing four other terrorists with him.

Later in 2002, in Afghanistan, Task Force 11 (previously known as Task Force Sword but renamed in January 2002) was composed of DEVGRU, and a company of Rangers, and was supported by a company of helicopters from the 160th SOAR.
During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, 3rd Battalion, 160th SOAR, deployed as the Joint Special Operations Air Detachment-West under CJSOTF-West (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-West/Task Force Dagger). It was equipped with eight MH-47E Chinooks, four MH-60L DAPs, and two MH-60L Black Hawks. At 9 p.m. on 19 March 2003, the first strike of Operation Iraqi Freedom was carried out by members of the 160th SOAR, on Iraqi visual observation posts along the southern and western borders of Iraq. The strike groups included one flight of MH-60L DAPs and four &quot;Black Swarm&quot; flights, each consisting of a pair of AH-6M Little Birds; a FLIR-equipped, target-spotting MH-6M; and a pair of U.S. Air Force A-10As.
In seven hours, more than 70 sites were destroyed, effectively depriving the Iraqi military of any early warning of the coming invasion. As the sites were eliminated the first heliborne SOF teams launched from H-5 airbase in Jordan, including vehicle-mounted patrols from the British and Australian special forces, who were transported by the MH-47Es of the 160th SOAR. Night Stalkers from 1st Battalion 160th SOAR were tasked with supporting Task Force 20 with its MH-60L/K Black Hawks, MH-60L DAPs, MH-6M transport and AH-6M Little Birds; they were based at Ar&#x27;Ar. On 26 March, the 160th SOAR took part in the Objective Beaver mission, a raid by DEVGRU on a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre that was suspected to have stocks of chemical and biological weapons.
On 1 April 2003, the 160th SOAR took part in the rescue mission of PFC Jessica Lynch who was taken prisoner during the Battle of Nasiriyah. On 2 April, a Delta Force squadron operating in Iraq was ambushed by a half-dozen armed technicals from an anti-special forces Fedayeen. Two MH-60K Black Hawks carrying a parajumper medical team and two MH-60L DAPs of the 160th SOAR responded and engaged the Iraqis, which allowed the Delta operators to move their two casualties to an emergency HLZ. However, one Delta Force operator succumbed to his wounds.

On the evening of 13 December 2003, Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S. forces in Operation Red Dawn, he was exfiltrated by a MH-6 Little Bird from the 160th SOAR and he was taken into custody at Baghdad International Airport.
In 2004 they took part in the rescue of three Italian contractors and one Polish businessman held for ransom by Iraqi insurgents.

In Afghanistan in 2005: Eight Night Stalkers (four from HHC and four from Bravo company of 3rd Battalion) were killed along with eight Navy SEALs on a rescue mission for Marcus Luttrell, after their MH-47 Chinook helicopter was hit by an RPG (rocket propelled grenade). They were sent out to look for Luttrell after Operation Red Wings, in which he was involved with three other SEALs, was compromised and Luttrell&#x27;s teammates killed.

==== 2006–2009 ====
In March 2006, SEALs from DEVGRU and Rangers were flown by the 160th SOAR into in North Waziristan, Pakistan, to assault an al-Qaeda training camp, allegedly under the codename: Operation Vigilant Harvest, the assaulters killed as many as 30 terrorists including the camps commandant.

On 14 May 2006, helicopters from the 160th SOAR brought operators from Delta Force&#x27;s B Squadron to Yusufiyah, Iraq, to fight al-Qaeda fighters in several buildings. As the operators disembarked their helicopters, they came under fire from a nearby house, and more al-Qaeda fighters soon joined the firefight. The door gunners of the 160th&#x27;s Black Hawks fired at the insurgents; a pair of AH-6M Little Birds carried out strafing runs. One Little Bird from the 160th&#x27;s 1st Battalion, B Company, was shot down. An estimated 25 al-Qaeda fighters were killed.
In July 2006, a pair of MH-47Es from 160th SOAR attempted to insert a combined strike element of DEVGRU, Rangers, and Afghan commandos in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, to attack a compound. With some troops on the ground, a large insurgent force ambushed them. Both helicopters were struck by small arms fire. One MH-47E pilot put his aircraft in the line of fire to protect the other MH-47E as its assault team disembarked. An RPG hit the shielding MH-47E, whose pilot crash-landed with no serious injuries to operators or aircrew. The Ranger commander and an attached 2nd Commando Regiment operator organised an all-round defence while the other MH-47E held back the advancing insurgents until its miniguns ran out of ammunition. An AC-130 Spectre joined the battle and kept the down crew and passengers safe until a British Immediate Response Team helicopter recovered them. The AC-130 then destroyed the MH-47E wreck, denying it to the Taliban.

Elements of 3rd Battalion 160th SOAR have conducted episodic deployments in support of Operation Enduring Freedom—Caribbean and Central America, begun in 2008. Night Stalker helicopters were present during the 2008 SOCOM counter-terror exercises in Denver. On 24 April 2008, Company D, 3rd Battalion, 160th SOAR was inactivated at a ceremony conducted at Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia, as part of a regimental transformation plan. The 160th SOAR also took part in the 2008 Abu Kamal raid.
On 19 August 2009, four Night Stalkers from D Company, 1st Battalion, 160th SOAR lost their lives in a MH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crash in Leadville, Colorado, during mountain and environmental training. On 9 September 2009 in Afghanistan, Night Stalkers inserted the British SBS and SFSG into Kunduz Province to rescue &quot;Times&quot; journalist Stephen Farrell after he and his Afghan interpreter were captured by the Taliban. On 19 September 2009 in Somalia, the Night Stalkers took part in Operation Celestial Balance, whose target was a senior terrorist leader connected to al-Qaeda affiliated organizations. The assault force (4 AH-6M Little Birds and 4 MH-60L Black Hawks) carried in DEVGRU operators to kill or capture the leader. AH-6Ms strafed the two-vehicle convoy, killing the leader along with three other al-Shabaab terrorists, then carried out an overwatch while DEVGRU cleared the vehicles and recovered the body.

On 22 October 2009, a 3rd Battalion helicopter crashed into the USNS &quot;Arctic&quot; during a joint training exercise involving fast roping about 20 miles off Fort Story, Virginia. The crash killed a soldier, Sergeant First Class James R. Stright, 29, and injured eight others, three seriously.

=== 2010–2020 ===
In May 2011, the Night Stalkers took part in the raid on Osama bin Laden&#x27;s compound. The operation involved flying covertly into Abbottabad, Pakistan in a pair of MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, specially modified for stealth and piloted by the 160th SOAR, to take a team of Navy SEALs directly to bin Laden&#x27;s compound. While one of the helicopters crash landed on arrival, all on board survived. The SEALs were successfully inserted onto the property while the crew was able to extract themselves, provide cover for the SEALs and then leave on the other helicopter. The mission was overall considered a success. The dramatic nighttime raid was &quot;painstakingly recreated&quot; in the film &quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot;, which covers the CIA&#x27;s efforts to track down bin Laden, from just after the September 11th attacks to the daring raid ten years later.

On 28 May 2012, Operation Jubilee took place: Black Hawks from the 160th SOAR flew in teams from the British 22 SAS and DEVGRU into Badakhshan Province, Afghanistan so they could rescue a British aid worker, a Kenyan NGO worker and 2 Afghans who were taken hostage by Bandits in the province. The rescue was a success.
On 15 January 2014, a MH-60M Black Hawk of the 160th performed a hard landing at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia. One soldier, CPT Clayton Carpenter of NY (posthumously promoted to MAJ), was killed with another two injured. On 4 July 2014, during Operation Inherent Resolve, the Night Stalkers inserted Delta Force operators into Syria to rescue James Foley and other US hostages. One American was wounded, no hostages were found, but a substantial number of terrorists were killed. CENTCOM mistakenly posted a video on the internet of a flight of four MH-60Ms of the 160th SOAR conducting a mid-air refueling over Iraq in October 2014, the video was hastily taken down. On 26 November 2014, MH-60s flown by Nightstalkers took part in the first raid in the 2014 hostage rescue operations in Yemen.

The Night Stalkers continue to be deployed to Afghanistan as part of NATO&#x27;s Resolute Support Mission after Operation Enduring Freedom-Afghanistan ended in late 2014 and was replaced with Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel. Throughout that night of 5 December 2015, a group of Rangers engaged in a firefight with enemy troops near the Afghan-Pakistan border; after about 5 a.m. their commander called for an extraction after they learned of a larger enemy group approaching. A helicopter from the 160th SOAR arrived and began receiving heavy fire from the enemy, with an AH-64 Apache helicopter from the 1st Battalion 101st Aviation Regiment escorting the helicopter, put their Apache directly between the U.S. troops, the helicopter and the enemy forces to draw the fire. As a result, the extraction was a success.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that 160th SOAR took part in the Yakla raid in Yemen on 29 January 2017, distinguishing itself when its helicopters flew repeatedly into heavy enemy fire to support U.S. Navy SEALs pinned down on the ground. On 25 August 2017, a Black Hawk helicopter flown by the 160th SOAR crashed off the coast of Yemen while conducting hoist training when it lost power and crashed into the sea, six servicemen survived, one US service member remained missing. &quot;CNN&quot; reported that on 27 October 2017, a US helicopter from 4th Battalion 160th SOAR crashed in Logar province, Afghanistan, killing one and injuring six more US service members; the crash was not a result of enemy action.

On 20 August 2018, CW3 Taylor Galvin died from injuries resulting from an MH-60M crash while conducting a partnered counter-terrorism mission in support of the Operation Inherent Resolve.

=== 2021–present ===
On the morning of September 18, 2021, &quot;according to what appears to be a military incident report shared on Instagram and Reddit&quot;, a katana-wielding man attacked several SOAR soldiers at a California airport, forcing over twenty of them to &quot;hunker down&quot; in a hangar at Inyokern Airport, resulting in wounds to two soldiers that required stitches. &quot;The soldiers&#x27; names were redacted in the photo shared on social media—but one was identified as a staff sergeant and the other as a captain.&quot;

On November 12, 2023, details emerged about a UH-60 Black Hawk crash landing in the Mediterranean Sea 30 miles off the coast of Cyprus during a training exercise, which the Department of Defense later confirmed and released the names of the 5 crew members killed, also stating that the events leading to the crash were under investigation.

<doc id="424428" wikidata="Q1431758" url="?curid=424428" title="San Francisco Renaissance">
<text>The term San Francisco Renaissance is used as a global designation for a range of poetic activity centered on San Francisco, which brought it to prominence as a hub of the American poetry avant-garde in the 1950s. However, others (e.g., Alan Watts, Ralph J. Gleason) felt this renaissance was a broader phenomenon and should be seen as also encompassing the visual and performing arts, philosophy, cross-cultural interests (particularly those that involved Asian cultures), and new social sensibilities.

==Founding==
Kenneth Rexroth—poet, translator, critic, and author—is the founding father of the renaissance. Rexroth was a prominent second generation modernist poet who corresponded with Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams and was published in the &quot;Objectivist Anthology&quot;. He was amongst the first American poets to explore Japanese poetry traditions such as haiku and was also heavily influenced by jazz. If Rexroth was the founding father, Madeline Gleason was the founding mother. During the 1940s, both she and Rexroth befriended a group of younger Berkeley poets consisting of Robert Duncan, and William Everson; Jack Spicer and Robin Blaser became involved in the late 40s. Gleason and Duncan were particularly close and read and criticized each other&#x27;s work.

==Movement ==
In April 1947, Gleason organized the First Festival of Modern Poetry at Marcelle Labaudt&#x27;s Lucien Labaudt Gallery, 1407 Gough Street, San Francisco. Over the space of two evenings, she brought twelve poets, including Rexroth, Robert Duncan and Spicer, to an audience of young poets and poetry lovers. This was the first public recognition of the range of experimental poetic practice that was current in the city.

During the 1950s, Duncan and Robert Creeley both taught at Black Mountain College and acted as links between the San Francisco poets and the Black Mountain poets. Many of the San Francisco writers began to publish in Cid Corman&#x27;s &quot;Origin&quot; and in the &quot;Black Mountain Review&quot;, the house journals of the Black Mountain group. Spicer&#x27;s interest in the &quot;cante jondo&quot; also led to links with the deep image poets. In 1957, Spicer ran his seminar &quot;Poetry as Magic&quot; at San Francisco State College with Duncan as a participant.

===Impact of &quot;New American Poetry&quot;===
Perhaps the crucial cultural document here was (and is) Donald Allen&#x27;s anthology &quot;The New American Poetry 1945–1960&quot;. In this assemblage, Allen grouped some of the poets as &quot;San Francisco Renaissance&quot;, and as Marjorie Perloff observes:

The Allen anthology was central to defining both the poetics and broader cultural dynamics of a particular historical moment now referred to as the San Francisco Renaissance. Though a particular &quot;generation&quot; had now been named (in large part because of the Allen anthology), today the debate continues as to the viability or use of the term &quot;San Francisco Renaissance&quot; as a &quot;label&quot; to define an entire era or generation.

Those who believe the term is accurate will argue on the one hand that indeed a &quot;group&quot; did forge a &quot;renaissance&quot;: the impact on our historical consciousness was (and is) measurable. Therefore, for them, the use of the term is still verifiable. On the other hand, there are those who argue that the label &quot;San Francisco Renaissance&quot; is just that: a label. As a label, therefore, it exists as a convenient and arbitrary &quot;grouping&quot; of something which remains (and even must remain) &quot;unverifiable&quot;. Since the impact of such a broad phenomenon on our consciousness cannot be measured, such an impact has not even been recognized or articulated yet, much less addressed as problematic in itself.

Beyond defining itself as itself (For example, defining some &quot;measurable&quot; impact on consciousness or on ourselves as human beings), critics of the term &quot;San Francisco Renaissance&quot; argue that beyond that particular use as a label (even if it helps to signal the arrival of a &quot;new&quot; phenomenon not accounted for on our consciousness), a word itself, as such, cannot act for us as an organizing principle. In other words, we are misguided if we do not recognize how this label fails us (beyond a certain usefulness as a label or &quot;grouping&quot;) when it comes to truly measuring (much less accounting for) the impact of multiple, broad and dynamic social, political, and artistic changes in our consciousness.

Among those critical of terminology and among those who dare to question &quot;how&quot; and why it &quot;can&quot; impact consciousness, asking what that proposes for a definition of the &quot;human&quot;, perhaps Ron Silliman has been most articulate: 

==Beat generation==
Around the same time that Duncan, Spicer and Blaser were at Berkeley, Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen and Lew Welch were attending Reed College in Portland, Oregon. All three stemmed initially from Rexroth and his curriculum and in the early 50s gravitated to the San Francisco area, where Spicer exercised an influence over Whalen and Welch. Although later associated by outsiders and publicists with the Beats, their primary sources are West Coast. Kirby Doyle, a native San Franciscan, and Bob Kaufman, originally from New Orleans, were with more reason associated in later accounts with the Beats.

Lawrence Ferlinghetti had been studying for a doctorate at the Sorbonne and, while in Paris, met Kenneth Rexroth, who later persuaded him to go to San Francisco to experience the growing literary scene there. Between 1951 and 1953, Ferlinghetti taught French, wrote literary criticism, and painted. In 1953, he and a business partner established the City Lights Bookstore and started publishing as City Lights Press two years later.

Snyder and Whalen, along with Michael McClure, were among the poets who performed at the famous Six Gallery poetry reading that Kenneth Rexroth organized in San Francisco on October 7, 1955. This reading signaled the full emergence of the San Francisco Renaissance into the public consciousness and helped establish the city&#x27;s reputation as a center for countercultural activity that came to full flower during the hippie years of the 1960s. A short fictional account of this event forms the second chapter of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s 1958 novel &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot;. In the account, he describes Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s famous reading of his poem &quot;Howl&quot;. Kerouac and Ginsberg had attended the reading with some of their poet friends.

==Legacy==
The Bay Area-based philosopher and writer Alan Watts, in his autobiography, mentioned that by around 1960 or so &quot;... something else was on the way, in religion, in music, in ethics and sexuality, in our attitudes to nature, and in our whole style of life&quot;, and described characteristics of a &quot;Clear School&quot; of poetry on whose roll he included &quot;Alice Meynell, Walter de la Mare, Emily Dickinson, Kenneth Rexroth, Karl Shapiro, Jean Burden, and Eric Barker (to name but a few).&quot; Watts asserted that these poets employ traditional rhythms and &quot;say what they have to say with an easy, natural clarity which avoids both clichés and obscure allusions or bizarre, far-fetched images.&quot;

Some of the songwriters of the upcoming rock-music generation of the mid-1960s and later read and appreciated writers like Kerouac, Snyder, McClure, Ferlinghetti, and Ginsberg (e.g., Bob Dylan, for one, has talked about this). Hence, given that much of the late-&#x27;60s wave of groundbreaking rock music developed within rock&#x27;s famous San Francisco Sound, it seems very likely that the writers of the San Francisco Renaissance had an influence on the lyrics, both artistically and in terms of attitudes to living.

The &quot;underground press&quot; that developed in America and elsewhere in the 1960s had one of its most interesting and colorful examples in the &quot;San Francisco Oracle&quot; which reflected the hippie culture and other aspects of the counterculture. The &quot;Oracle&quot; gave much space to writings by Gary Snyder, Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Michael McClure, and other Beat writers, along with emerging younger writers.

Both Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Michael McClure were featured on-stage in the rock-star jammed &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, a 1978 documentary and concert film made by Martin Scorsese about The Band (who had an immense following in the late 1960s to mid 1970s), a large number of their musical friends, and the 1976 concert of the same name.

<text>Weakness is a symptom of many different medical conditions. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis.

==Pathophysiology==

Muscle cells work by detecting a flow of electrical impulses from the brain, which signals them to contract through the release of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Fatigue (reduced ability to generate force) may occur due to the nerve, or within the muscle cells themselves. New research from scientists at Columbia University suggests that muscle fatigue is caused by calcium leaking out of the muscle cell. This makes less calcium available for the muscle cell. In addition, the Columbia researchers propose that an enzyme activated by this released calcium eats away at muscle fibers.

Substrates within the muscle generally serve to power muscular contractions. They include molecules such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glycogen and creatine phosphate. ATP binds to the myosin head and causes the &#x27;ratchetting&#x27; that results in contraction according to the sliding filament model. Creatine phosphate stores energy so ATP can be rapidly regenerated within the muscle cells from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ions, allowing for sustained powerful contractions that last between 5–7 seconds. Glycogen is the intramuscular storage form of glucose, used to generate energy quickly once intramuscular creatine stores are exhausted, producing lactic acid as a metabolic byproduct. Contrary to common belief, lactic acid accumulation doesn&#x27;t actually cause the burning sensation felt when people exhaust their oxygen and oxidative metabolism, but in actuality, lactic acid in presence of oxygen recycles to produce pyruvate in the liver, which is known as the Cori cycle.

Substrates produce metabolic fatigue by being depleted during exercise, resulting in a lack of intracellular energy sources to fuel contractions. In essence, the muscle stops contracting because it lacks the energy to do so.

==Differential diagnosis==

===True vs. perceived weakness===
* True weakness (or neuromuscular) describes a condition where the force exerted by the muscles is less than would be expected, for example muscular dystrophy.
* Perceived weakness (or non-neuromuscular) describes a condition where a person feels more effort than normal is required to exert a given amount of force but actual muscle strength is normal, for example.

In some conditions, such as myasthenia gravis, muscle strength is normal when resting, but &quot;true weakness&quot; occurs after the muscle has been subjected to exercise. This is also true for some cases of Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, where objective post-exertion muscle weakness with delayed recovery time has been measured and is a feature of some of the published definitions.

===Asthenia vs. myasthenia===
Asthenia or asthaenia (, literally &quot;lack of strength&quot; but also &quot;disease&quot;) is a medical term referring to a condition in which the body lacks or has lost strength either as a whole or in any of its parts. It is a poorly defined condition that can include true or primary muscle weakness or perceived muscle weakness. For perceived muscle weakness, asthenia has been described as the feeling of weak or tired muscles in the absence of muscle weakness, that is the muscle can generate a normal amount of force but it is perceived as requiring more effort.

General asthenia occurs in many chronic wasting diseases (such as tuberculosis and cancer), sleep disorders or chronic disorders of the heart, lungs or kidneys, and is probably most marked in diseases of the adrenal gland. Asthenia may be limited to certain organs or systems of organs, as in asthenopia, characterized by ready fatiguability. Asthenia is also a side effect of some medications and treatments, such as Ritonavir (a protease inhibitor used in HIV treatment). 

Differentiating psychogenic (perceived) asthenia and true asthenia from myasthenia is often difficult, and in time apparent psychogenic asthenia accompanying many chronic disorders is seen to progress into a primary weakness.

Myasthenia or myasthaenia (my- from meaning &quot;muscle&quot; + -asthenia [&quot;&quot;] meaning &quot;weakness&quot;), or simply muscle weakness, is a lack of muscle strength. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have either true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular diseases, such as myasthenia gravis. Perceived muscle weakness occurs in diseases such as sleep disorders, and depression.

===Types===
Muscle fatigue can be central, neuromuscular, or peripheral muscular. Central muscle fatigue manifests as an overall sense of energy deprivation, and peripheral muscle weakness manifests as a local, muscle-specific inability to do work. Neuromuscular fatigue can be either central or peripheral.

====Central fatigue====
The central fatigue is generally described in terms of a reduction in the neural drive or nerve-based motor command to working muscles that results in a decline in the force output. It has been suggested that the reduced neural drive during exercise may be a protective mechanism to prevent organ failure if the work was continued at the same intensity. The exact mechanisms of central fatigue are unknown, though there has been considerable interest in the role of serotonergic pathways.

====Neuromuscular fatigue====
Nerves control the contraction of muscles by determining the number, sequence, and force of muscular contraction. When a nerve experiences synaptic fatigue it becomes unable to stimulate the muscle that it innervates. Most movements require a force far below what a muscle could potentially generate, and barring pathology, neuromuscular fatigue is seldom an issue.

For extremely powerful contractions that are close to the upper limit of a muscle&#x27;s ability to generate force, neuromuscular fatigue can become a limiting factor in untrained individuals. In novice strength trainers, the muscle&#x27;s ability to generate force is most strongly limited by nerve&#x27;s ability to sustain a high-frequency signal. After an extended period of maximum contraction, the nerve&#x27;s signal reduces in frequency and the force generated by the contraction diminishes. There is no sensation of pain or discomfort, the muscle appears to simply &#x27;stop listening&#x27; and gradually cease to move, often lengthening. As there is insufficient stress on the muscles and tendons, there will often be no delayed onset muscle soreness following the workout. Part of the process of strength training is increasing the nerve&#x27;s ability to generate sustained, high frequency signals which allow a muscle to contract with their greatest force. It is this &quot;neural training&quot; that causes several weeks worth of rapid gains in strength, which level off once the nerve is generating maximum contractions and the muscle reaches its physiological limit. Past this point, training effects increase muscular strength through myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and metabolic fatigue becomes the factor limiting contractile force.

====Peripheral muscle fatigue====
Peripheral muscle fatigue during physical work is considered an inability for the body to supply sufficient energy or other metabolites to the contracting muscles to meet the increased energy demand. This is the most common case of physical fatigue—affecting a national average of 72% of adults in the work force in 2002. This causes contractile dysfunction that manifests in the eventual reduction or lack of ability of a single muscle or local group of muscles to do work. The insufficiency of energy, i.e. sub-optimal aerobic metabolism, generally results in the accumulation of lactic acid and other acidic anaerobic metabolic by-products in the muscle, causing the stereotypical burning sensation of local muscle fatigue, though recent studies have indicated otherwise, actually finding that lactic acid is a source of energy.

The fundamental difference between the peripheral and central theories of muscle fatigue is that the peripheral model of muscle fatigue assumes failure at one or more sites in the chain that initiates muscle contraction. Peripheral regulation therefore depends on the localized metabolic chemical conditions of the local muscle affected, whereas the central model of muscle fatigue is an integrated mechanism that works to preserve the integrity of the system by initiating muscle fatigue through muscle derecruitment, based on collective feedback from the periphery, before cellular or organ failure occurs. Therefore, the feedback that is read by this central regulator could include chemical and mechanical as well as cognitive cues. The significance of each of these factors will depend on the nature of the fatigue-inducing work that is being performed.

Though not universally used, &quot;metabolic fatigue&quot; is a common alternative term for peripheral muscle weakness, because of the reduction in contractile force due to the direct or indirect effects of the reduction of substrates or accumulation of metabolites within the myocytes. This can occur through a simple lack of energy to fuel contraction, or through interference with the ability of Ca2+ to stimulate actin and myosin to contract.

<text>Carlton is a small rural parish located east of the River Sence in Leicestershire, England, around 2.2 miles north of Market Bosworth. According to the 2011 census, Carlton has a population of 305 However, from 2014 it is estimated that there are around 330 people living there with a total of 283 registered electors. There are four roads in Carlton:
*Main Street (where most of the population is centred)
*Barton Road (at the east end of the village leading south to Market Bosworth and north to Barton-in-the-Beans)
*Congerstone Lane (at the west end of the village)
*Shackerstone Walk (formerly Occupation Road).

== Village life ==
The village has a strong community spirit, and there are regular fundraising events for causes such as the church. There is an Investment Club which meets in members&#x27; houses once a month. The local fox hunt often meets in one of the farms on Shackerstone Walk. The Community also gets involved in other events such as the spring clean litter pick which has been going on annually since 1992. the day involves the clearing of all roads and verges leading up to the village to welcome spring. Most recently a total of 30 local people took part. 

== Facilities ==
The village has one pub, The Gate Hangs Well, situated at the eastern end of Carlton. This pub now features a cafe and restaurant called Seasons, and is privately owned. The village is in Leicestershire, but the post office mail is delivered from Nuneaton, so Carlton&#x27;s Post office address is Carlton, Nuneaton, CV13. The Parish is also crossed by the Leicestershire round circular paths, a 100-mile circular walk around the county connecting many places of historical and geographical interest. Therefore, the parish council works closely with the Carlton footpath group and the county council.

== St Andrews Church ==
St Andrews today is a small pretty church situated in the centre of Carlton restored after it was burnt down in 1764 with a mixture of both stone and brick and was dedicated to St Michael Then in 1867 another restoration took place undertaken buy Goddard and Son. The restoration involved both altering the windows and adding a saddleback top to the tower.. The building was Gothicised and its dedication was then changed to St Andrew. In the Northern Wall of the nave there is a stained glass window picturing the angels Michael and Gabriel created in the 1920s by Theadora Salusbury. In 1937 the clock tower was bought through the efforts of the rector&#x27;s daughter selling needle work door to door, and this needlework continues as some of the villagers produced some commemorative pieces in order to celebrate the Millennium.

== History of Carlton ==
The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;farm/settlement of the free peasants&#x27;.

There is no mention of the parish in the doomsday book so it is likely a Norman settlement However the first Civil registration occurred in 1837, with the parish being registered in the Market Bosworth Sub-District. and from then Carlton was described as a chapelry in Market-Bosworth parish, Leicester; on the Ashby-de-la-Zouch canal.

In 1847, saw the Carltons first Public elementary school to be built, intending to educate 49 children other facilities were also built or revived including the St Andrews church, a Manor house in 1881 and the diamond jubilee orchard.

The population itself according to recent Census data has stayed relatively the same apart from dropping below 200 between 1901s data and 1961, and hitting a lowest of 170 in 1921, with the number of Males dropping to 84. Memorials of those who died in the war can be seen in St Andrew&#x27;s church.

== Local Businesses ==

Apart from one pub, the main businesses are based in Market Bosworth, and other areas of Nuneaton which are still accessible from the Parish. There is a small commercial estate located behind Church Cottage, which includes businesses such as AR Demolition.

== Transport ==
Arriva Midlands operate service 153 at hourly intervals through the village with journeys terminating in nearby Market Bosworth and continuing into Leicester. The nearest train station is Leicester railway station which is nearly 20 miles away

<doc id="424440" wikidata="Q899853" url="?curid=424440" title="H-theorem">
<text>In classical statistical mechanics, the &quot;H&quot;-theorem, introduced by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872, describes the tendency of the quantity &quot;H&quot; (defined below) to decrease in a nearly-ideal gas of molecules. As this quantity &quot;H&quot; was meant to represent the entropy of thermodynamics, the &quot;H&quot;-theorem was an early demonstration of the power of statistical mechanics as it claimed to derive the second law of thermodynamics—a statement about fundamentally irreversible processes—from reversible microscopic mechanics. It is thought to prove the second law of thermodynamics, albeit under the assumption of low-entropy initial conditions.

The &quot;H&quot;-theorem is a natural consequence of the kinetic equation derived by Boltzmann that has come to be known as Boltzmann&#x27;s equation. The &quot;H&quot;-theorem has led to considerable discussion about its actual implications, with major themes being:
* What is entropy? In what sense does Boltzmann&#x27;s quantity &quot;H&quot; correspond to the thermodynamic entropy?
* Are the assumptions (especially the assumption of molecular chaos) behind Boltzmann&#x27;s equation too strong? When are these assumptions violated?

== Name and pronunciation ==
Boltzmann in his original publication writes the symbol &quot;E&quot; (as in entropy) for its statistical function&quot;.&quot; Years later, Samuel Hawksley Burbury, one of the critics of the theorem, wrote the function with the symbol &quot;H,&quot; a notation that was subsequently adopted by Boltzmann when referring to his &quot;&quot;H-&quot;theorem&quot;. The notation has led to some confusion regarding the name of the theorem. Even though the statement is usually referred to as the &quot;&quot;Aitch&quot; theorem&quot;&quot;, sometimes it is instead called the &quot;Eta&quot; theorem&quot;, as the capital Greek letter &quot;Eta&quot; (&quot;Η&quot;) is indistinguishable from the capital version of Latin letter &quot;h&quot; (&quot;H&quot;)&quot;.&quot; Discussions have been raised on how the symbol should be understood, but it remains unclear due to the lack of written sources from the time of the theorem. Studies of the typography and the work of J.W. Gibbs seem to favour the interpretation of &quot;H&quot; as &quot;Eta&quot;.

== Definition and meaning of Boltzmann&#x27;s &quot;H&quot; ==

The &quot;H&quot; value is determined from the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) &quot;dE&quot;, which is the energy distribution function of molecules at time &quot;t&quot;. The value &quot;f&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) &quot;dE&quot; is the number of molecules that have kinetic energy between &quot;E&quot; and &quot;E&quot; + &quot;dE&quot;. &quot;H&quot; itself is defined as

:formula_1

For an isolated ideal gas (with fixed total energy and fixed total number of particles), the function &quot;H&quot; is at a minimum when the particles have a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution; if the molecules of the ideal gas are distributed in some other way (say, all having the same kinetic energy), then the value of &quot;H&quot; will be higher. Boltzmann&#x27;s &quot;H&quot;-theorem, described in the next section, shows that when collisions between molecules are allowed, such distributions are unstable and tend to irreversibly seek towards the minimum value of &quot;H&quot; (towards the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution).

(Note on notation: Boltzmann originally used the letter &quot;E&quot; for quantity &quot;H&quot;; most of the literature after Boltzmann uses the letter &quot;H&quot; as here. Boltzmann also used the symbol &quot;x&quot; to refer to the kinetic energy of a particle.)

== Boltzmann&#x27;s &quot;H&quot; theorem ==

Boltzmann considered what happens during the collision between two particles. It is a basic fact of mechanics that in the elastic collision between two particles (such as hard spheres), the energy transferred between the particles varies depending on initial conditions (angle of collision, etc.).

Boltzmann made a key assumption known as the &quot;Stosszahlansatz&quot; (molecular chaos assumption), that during any collision event in the gas, the two particles participating in the collision have 1) independently chosen kinetic energies from the distribution, 2) independent velocity directions, 3) independent starting points. Under these assumptions, and given the mechanics of energy transfer, the energies of the particles after the collision will obey a certain new random distribution that can be computed.

Considering repeated uncorrelated collisions, between any and all of the molecules in the gas, Boltzmann constructed his kinetic equation (Boltzmann&#x27;s equation). From this kinetic equation, a natural outcome is that the continual process of collision causes the quantity &quot;H&quot; to decrease until it has reached a minimum.

== Impact ==

Although Boltzmann&#x27;s &quot;H&quot;-theorem turned out not to be the absolute proof of the second law of thermodynamics as originally claimed (see Criticisms below), the &quot;H&quot;-theorem led Boltzmann in the last years of the 19th century to more and more probabilistic arguments about the nature of thermodynamics. The probabilistic view of thermodynamics culminated in 1902 with Josiah Willard Gibbs&#x27;s statistical mechanics for fully general systems (not just gases), and the introduction of generalized statistical ensembles.

The kinetic equation and in particular Boltzmann&#x27;s molecular chaos assumption inspired a whole family of Boltzmann equations that are still used today to model the motions of particles, such as the electrons in a semiconductor. In many cases the molecular chaos assumption is highly accurate, and the ability to discard complex correlations between particles makes calculations much simpler.

The process of thermalisation can be described using the H-theorem or the relaxation theorem.

== Criticism and exceptions ==

There are several notable reasons described below why the &quot;H&quot;-theorem, at least in its original 1871 form, is not completely rigorous. As Boltzmann would eventually go on to admit, the arrow of time in the &quot;H&quot;-theorem is not in fact purely mechanical, but really a consequence of assumptions about initial conditions.

=== Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox ===

Soon after Boltzmann published his &quot;H&quot; theorem, Johann Josef Loschmidt objected that it should not be possible to deduce an irreversible process from time-symmetric dynamics and a time-symmetric formalism. If the &quot;H&quot; decreases over time in one state, then there must be a matching reversed state where &quot;H&quot; increases over time (Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox). The explanation is that Boltzmann&#x27;s equation is based on the assumption of &quot;molecular chaos&quot;, i.e., that it follows from, or at least is consistent with, the underlying kinetic model that the particles be considered independent and uncorrelated. It turns out that this assumption breaks time reversal symmetry in a subtle sense, and therefore begs the question. Once the particles are allowed to collide, their velocity directions and positions in fact &quot;do&quot; become correlated (however, these correlations are encoded in an extremely complex manner). This shows that an (ongoing) assumption of independence is not consistent with the underlying particle model.

Boltzmann&#x27;s reply to Loschmidt was to concede the possibility of these states, but noting that these sorts of states were so rare and unusual as to be impossible in practice. Boltzmann would go on to sharpen this notion of the &quot;rarity&quot; of states, resulting in his entropy formula of 1877.

=== Spin echo ===

As a demonstration of Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox, a modern counterexample (not to Boltzmann&#x27;s original gas-related &quot;H&quot;-theorem, but to a closely related analogue) is the phenomenon of spin echo. In the spin echo effect, it is physically possible to induce time reversal in an interacting system of spins.

An analogue to Boltzmann&#x27;s &quot;H&quot; for the spin system can be defined in terms of the distribution of spin states in the system. In the experiment, the spin system is initially perturbed into a non-equilibrium state (high &quot;H&quot;), and, as predicted by the &quot;H&quot; theorem the quantity &quot;H&quot; soon decreases to the equilibrium value. At some point, a carefully constructed electromagnetic pulse is applied that reverses the motions of all the spins. The spins then undo the time evolution from before the pulse, and after some time the &quot;H&quot; actually &quot;increases&quot; away from equilibrium (once the evolution has completely unwound, the &quot;H&quot; decreases once again to the minimum value). In some sense, the time reversed states noted by Loschmidt turned out to be not completely impractical.

=== Poincaré recurrence ===

In 1896, Ernst Zermelo noted a further problem with the &quot;H&quot; theorem, which was that if the system&#x27;s &quot;H&quot; is at any time not a minimum, then by Poincaré recurrence, the non-minimal &quot;H&quot; must recur (though after some extremely long time). Boltzmann admitted that these recurring rises in &quot;H&quot; technically would occur, but pointed out that, over long times, the system spends only a tiny fraction of its time in one of these recurring states.

The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system always increases to a maximum equilibrium value. This is strictly true only in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of particles. For a finite number of particles, there will always be entropy fluctuations. For example, in the fixed volume of the isolated system, the maximum entropy is obtained when half the particles are in one half of the volume, half in the other, but sometimes there will be temporarily a few more particles on one side than the other, and this will constitute a very small reduction in entropy. These entropy fluctuations are such that the longer one waits, the larger an entropy fluctuation one will probably see during that time, and the time one must wait for a given entropy fluctuation is always finite, even for a fluctuation to its minimum possible value. For example, one might have an extremely low entropy condition of all particles being in one half of the container. The gas will quickly attain its equilibrium value of entropy, but given enough time, this same situation will happen again. For practical systems, e.g. a gas in a 1-liter container at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, this time is truly enormous, many multiples of the age of the universe, and, practically speaking, one can ignore the possibility.

=== Fluctuations of &quot;H&quot; in small systems ===

Since &quot;H&quot; is a mechanically defined variable that is not conserved, then like any other such variable (pressure, etc.) it will show thermal fluctuations. This means that &quot;H&quot; regularly shows spontaneous increases from the minimum value. Technically this is not an exception to the &quot;H&quot; theorem, since the &quot;H&quot; theorem was only intended to apply for a gas with a very large number of particles. These fluctuations are only perceptible when the system is small and the time interval over which it is observed is not enormously large.

If &quot;H&quot; is interpreted as entropy as Boltzmann intended, then this can be seen as a manifestation of the fluctuation theorem.

== Connection to information theory ==

&quot;H&quot; is a forerunner of Shannon&#x27;s information entropy. Claude Shannon denoted his measure of information entropy &quot;H&quot; after the H-theorem. The article on Shannon&#x27;s information entropy contains an
explanation of the discrete counterpart of the quantity &quot;H&quot;, known as the information entropy or information uncertainty (with a minus sign). By extending the discrete information entropy to the continuous information entropy, also called differential entropy, one obtains the expression in the equation from the section above, Definition and Meaning of Boltzmann&#x27;s H, and thus a better feel for the meaning of &quot;H&quot;.

The &quot;H&quot;-theorem&#x27;s connection between information and entropy plays a central role in a recent controversy called the Black hole information paradox.

== Tolman&#x27;s &quot;H&quot;-theorem ==

Richard C. Tolman&#x27;s 1938 book &quot;The Principles of Statistical Mechanics&quot; dedicates a whole chapter to the study of Boltzmann&#x27;s &quot;H&quot; theorem, and its extension in the generalized classical statistical mechanics of Gibbs. A further chapter is devoted to the quantum mechanical version of the &quot;H&quot;-theorem.

=== Classical mechanical ===

We let and be our generalized canonical coordinates for a set of formula_2 particles. Then we consider a function formula_3 that returns the probability density of particles, over the states in phase space. Note how this can be multiplied by a small region in phase space, denoted by formula_4, to yield the (average) expected number of particles in that region.

:formula_5

Tolman offers the following equations for the definition of the quantity &quot;H&quot; in Boltzmann&#x27;s original &quot;H&quot; theorem.

: formula_6

Here we sum over the regions into which phase space is divided, indexed by formula_7. And in the limit for an infinitesimal phase space volume formula_8, we can write the sum as an integral.

: formula_9

&quot;H&quot; can also be written in terms of the number of molecules present in each of the cells.
: formula_10

An additional way to calculate the quantity &quot;H&quot; is:

: formula_11

where &quot;P&quot; is the probability of finding a system chosen at random from the specified microcanonical ensemble. It can finally be written as:

: formula_12

where &quot;G&quot; is the number of classical states.

The quantity &quot;H&quot; can also be defined as the integral over velocity space :
where &quot;P&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) is the probability distribution.

Using the Boltzmann equation one can prove that &quot;H&quot; can only decrease.

For a system of &quot;N&quot; statistically independent particles, &quot;H&quot; is related to the thermodynamic entropy &quot;S&quot; through:

:formula_13 

So, according to the &quot;H&quot;-theorem, &quot;S&quot; can only increase.

=== Quantum mechanical ===

In quantum statistical mechanics (which is the quantum version of classical statistical mechanics), the H-function is the function:
: formula_14
where summation runs over all possible distinct states of the system, and &quot;pi&quot; is the probability that the system could be found in the &quot;i&quot;-th state.

This is closely related to the entropy formula of Gibbs,
:formula_15
and we shall (following e.g., Waldram (1985), p. 39) proceed using &quot;S&quot; rather than &quot;H&quot;.

First, differentiating with respect to time gives

:formula_16

(using the fact that Σ &quot;dp&quot;&quot;i&quot;/&quot;dt&quot; = 0, since Σ &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; = 1, so the second term vanishes. We will see later that it will be useful to break this into two sums.)

Now Fermi&#x27;s golden rule gives a master equation for the average rate of quantum jumps from state α to β; and from state β to α. (Of course, Fermi&#x27;s golden rule itself makes certain approximations, and the introduction of this rule is what introduces irreversibility. It is essentially the quantum version of Boltzmann&#x27;s &quot;Stosszahlansatz&quot;.) For an isolated system the jumps will make contributions
:formula_17
where the reversibility of the dynamics ensures that the same transition constant &quot;ν&quot;&quot;αβ&quot; appears in both expressions.

So

:formula_18

The two differences terms in the summation always have the same sign. For example:
:formula_19

then 

:formula_20

so overall the two negative signs will cancel. 

Therefore,

:formula_21

for an isolated system.

The same mathematics is sometimes used to show that relative entropy is a Lyapunov function of a Markov process in detailed balance, and other chemistry contexts.

== Gibbs&#x27; &quot;H&quot;-theorem ==

Josiah Willard Gibbs described another way in which the entropy of a microscopic system would tend to increase over time. Later writers have called this &quot;Gibbs&#x27; &quot;H&quot;-theorem&quot; as its conclusion resembles that of Boltzmann&#x27;s. Gibbs himself never called it an &quot;H&quot;-theorem, and in fact his definition of entropy—and mechanism of increase—are very different from Boltzmann&#x27;s. This section is included for historical completeness.

The setting of Gibbs&#x27; entropy production theorem is in ensemble statistical mechanics, and the entropy quantity is the Gibbs entropy (information entropy) defined in terms of the probability distribution for the entire state of the system. This is in contrast to Boltzmann&#x27;s &quot;H&quot; defined in terms of the distribution of states of individual molecules, within a specific state of the system.

Gibbs considered the motion of an ensemble which initially starts out confined to a small region of phase space, meaning that the state of the system is known with fair precision though not quite exactly (low Gibbs entropy). The evolution of this ensemble over time proceeds according to Liouville&#x27;s equation. For almost any kind of realistic system, the Liouville evolution tends to &quot;stir&quot; the ensemble over phase space, a process analogous to the mixing of a dye in an incompressible fluid. After some time, the ensemble appears to be spread out over phase space, although it is actually a finely striped pattern, with the total volume of the ensemble (and its Gibbs entropy) conserved. Liouville&#x27;s equation is guaranteed to conserve Gibbs entropy since there is no random process acting on the system; in principle, the original ensemble can be recovered at any time by reversing the motion.

The critical point of the theorem is thus: If the fine structure in the stirred-up ensemble is very slightly blurred, for any reason, then the Gibbs entropy increases, and the ensemble becomes an equilibrium ensemble. As to why this blurring should occur in reality, there are a variety of suggested mechanisms. For example, one suggested mechanism is that the phase space is coarse-grained for some reason (analogous to the pixelization in the simulation of phase space shown in the figure). For any required finite degree of fineness the ensemble becomes &quot;sensibly uniform&quot; after a finite time. Or, if the system experiences a tiny uncontrolled interaction with its environment, the sharp coherence of the ensemble will be lost. Edwin Thompson Jaynes argued that the blurring is subjective in nature, simply corresponding to a loss of knowledge about the state of the system. In any case, however it occurs, the Gibbs entropy increase is irreversible provided the blurring cannot be reversed.
The exactly evolving entropy, which does not increase, is known as &quot;fine-grained entropy&quot;. The blurred entropy is known as &quot;coarse-grained entropy&quot;.
Leonard Susskind analogizes this distinction to the notion of the volume of a fibrous ball of cotton: On one hand the volume of the fibers themselves is constant, but in another sense there is a larger coarse-grained volume, corresponding to the outline of the ball.

Gibbs&#x27; entropy increase mechanism solves some of the technical difficulties found in Boltzmann&#x27;s &quot;H&quot;-theorem: The Gibbs entropy does not fluctuate nor does it exhibit Poincare recurrence, and so the increase in Gibbs entropy, when it occurs, is therefore irreversible as expected from thermodynamics. The Gibbs mechanism also applies equally well to systems with very few degrees of freedom, such as the single-particle system shown in the figure. To the extent that one accepts that the ensemble becomes blurred, then, Gibbs&#x27; approach is a cleaner proof of the second law of thermodynamics.

Unfortunately, as pointed out early on in the development of quantum statistical mechanics by John von Neumann and others, this kind of argument does not carry over to quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, the ensemble cannot support an ever-finer mixing process, because of the finite dimensionality of the relevant portion of Hilbert space. Instead of converging closer and closer to the equilibrium ensemble (time-averaged ensemble) as in the classical case, the density matrix of the quantum system will constantly show evolution, even showing recurrences. Developing a quantum version of the &quot;H&quot;-theorem without appeal to the &quot;Stosszahlansatz&quot; is thus significantly more complicated.

<doc id="424442" wikidata="Q1231580" url="?curid=424442" title="John Brinkley (astronomer)">
<text>John Mortimer Brinkley (born 1763 or 1766died 14 September 1835) was the first Royal Astronomer of Ireland and later Bishop of Cloyne. He was President of the Royal Irish Academy (1822–35), President of the Royal Astronomical Society (1831–33). He was awarded the Cunningham Medal in 1818, and the Copley Medal in 1824.

==Early years==
Brinkley was born in Woodbridge, Suffolk and was baptised there on 31 January 1763, the illegitimate son of Sarah Brinkley, a butcher&#x27;s daughter.

On being admitted to Cambridge, he was recorded as being the son of John Toler Brinkley, a vintner, but it is strongly suggested that his real father was John Toler, 1st Earl of Norbury, Chief Justice of the Irish Court of Common Pleas.

His exact date of birth is unknown; he has often been assigned the birth year 1763, as at least one obituary gives his age at death in 1835 as 72. However, his memorial at Trinity College Dublin states that he died aged 70; also, he was recorded as being 17 upon matriculation at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in August 1783, both of which imply a slightly later birth year.

==Career==

===Scientific===

He graduated Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1788 as Senior Wrangler and Smith&#x27;s Prizeman, was elected a fellow of the college and was awarded Cambridge Master of Arts (MA Cantab) in 1791. He was ordained at Lincoln Cathedral in the same year.

In 1792 he became the second Andrews Professor of Astronomy at Trinity College Dublin, which carried the new title of Royal Astronomer of Ireland. He was the director at the Dunsink Observatory from 1790 to 1827. Together with John Law, Bishop of Elphin, he drafted the chapter on &quot;Astronomy&quot; in William Paley&#x27;s &quot;Natural Theology.&quot; His main work concerned stellar astronomy and he published his &quot;Elements of Plane Astronomy&quot; in 1808.

In 1818 he was awarded the prestigious Cunningham Medal of the Royal Irish Academy and in 1822 was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society in 1824.

Brinkley&#x27;s observations that several stars shifted their apparent place in the sky in the course of a year were disproved at Greenwich by his contemporary John Pond, the Astronomer Royal. In 1826, he was appointed Bishop of Cloyne in County Cork, a position he held for the remaining nine years of his life. Brinkley was elected President of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1831, serving in that position for two years.

He was also an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HFRSE).

===Clerical===

On May 24 May 1806 he was appointed a prebendary of Elphin Cathedral; and on 5 June 1806 he became Rector of Derrybrusk. Later that year Trinity College Dublin awarded him the degree of Doctor of Divinity. He was appointed the Archdeacon of Clogher in 1808; and collated to the Vicarage of Laracor. There is a memorial to him in Cloyne Cathedral.

==Family==
Brinkley married Esther, daughter of Matthew Weld of Molesworth Street, Sheriff of Dublin City, by his wife Elizabeth Kane, daughter of Nathaniel Kane (d. 1757) of Drumreaske, County Monaghan; Sheriff (1720) and Lord Mayor of Dublin (1734); co-founder of the Bank of Kane &amp; Latouche. Brinkley and his wife were the parents of two sons and a daughter: John (1793–1847), Rector of Glanworth, Diocese of Cloyne, who married Anna, second daughter and co-heir of Walter Stephens, of Hybla, County Kildare; Sarah Jane (1801–1827), second wife of Dr. Robert Graves, who died giving birth to a daughter; and Matthew (1797–1855) J.P., of Parsonstown House, County Meath, who married Harriet, a daughter of Richard Graves and with her was the father of Francis Brinkley.

==Death==
Brinkley died in 1835 at Leeson Street, Dublin and was buried in Trinity College chapel. He was succeeded at Dunsink Observatory by William Rowan Hamilton.

<text>is a large artificial island in Tokyo Bay, Japan, across the Rainbow Bridge from central Tokyo. Odaiba was initially built for defensive purposes in the 1850s. The land was dramatically expanded during the late 20th century as a seaport district, and was redeveloped in the 1990s into a major commercial, residential and leisure area. Odaiba, along with Minato Mirai 21 in Yokohama, is one of the few manmade seashores in Tokyo Bay where the waterfront is accessible and not blocked by industry and harbor areas.

The majority of the island is located in Tokyo&#x27;s Kōtō ward, with the north and northwest of the island in Minato and Shinagawa wards. formally refers to one district of the island located in Minato. Governor Shintaro Ishihara used &quot;Odaiba&quot; to refer to the entire , which includes the Ariake and Aomi districts of Kōtō Ward and the Higashi-Yashio district of Shinagawa Ward.

== History ==
=== Battery islands ===

The name &quot;Odaiba&quot; alludes to , which formed small islands nearby. They were constructed in 1853 by Egawa Hidetatsu for the Tokugawa shogunate in order to protect Edo from attack by sea, the primary threat being Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s Black Ships, which had arrived in the same year. In 1928, the was refurbished and opened to the public as the Metropolitan Daiba Park.
Of the originally planned 11 batteries, seven construction projects started, but only six were ever finished. No. 1 to No. 3 Batteries were completed in eight months in 1853. Construction on Nos. 4 to 7 started in 1854, but only Nos. 5 and 6 were finished by the year&#x27;s end. Nos. 4 and 7 were abandoned, with 30% and 70% unfinished (respectively), and an alternative land-based battery near Gotenyama was built instead. However, they resumed construction on No. 4 in 1862 and completed it the following year.

Until the mid-1960s, all except two batteries (Nos. 3 and 6) were either removed to facilitate ship navigation or incorporated into Shinagawa port and Tennōzu. In 1979, the &quot;landfill no. 13&quot; (now Minato-ku Daiba, Shinagawa-ku Higashi-Yashio and Kōtō-ku Aomi districts) was finished and connected to the park that was No. 3 Battery. On the other hand, No. 6 was left to nature (access prohibited).

=== Redevelopment ===

The modern island of Odaiba began to take shape when the Port of Tokyo opened in 1941.

Tokyo governor Shunichi Suzuki began a major development plan in the early 1990s to redevelop Odaiba as Tokyo Teleport Town, a showcase for futuristic living, with new residential and commercial development housing a population of over 100,000. The redevelopment was scheduled to be complete in time for a planned &quot;International Urban Exposition&quot; in spring 1996.

Suzuki&#x27;s successor Yukio Aoshima halted the plan in 1995, by which point over JPY 1 trillion had been spent on the project, and Odaiba was still underpopulated and full of vacant lots. Many of the special companies set up to develop the island became practically bankrupt. The collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble was a major factor, as it frustrated commercial development in Tokyo generally. The area was also viewed as inconvenient for business, as its physical connections to Tokyo—the Rainbow Bridge and the Yurikamome rapid transit line—made travel to and from central Tokyo relatively time-consuming and costly.

The area started coming back to life in the late 1990s as a tourist and leisure zone, with several large hotels and shopping malls. Several large companies including Fuji Television moved their headquarters to the island, and transportation links improved with the connection of the Rinkai Line into the JR East railway network in 2002 and the eastward extension of the Yurikamome to Toyosu in 2006. Tokyo Big Sight, the convention center originally built to house Governor Suzuki&#x27;s planned intercity convention, also became a major venue for international expositions.

The D1 Grand Prix motorsport series hosted drifting events at Odaiba from 2004 to 2018.

Odaiba was one of the venues for the 2020 Summer Olympics. A temporary arena was built at Shiokaze Park for beach volleyball, and temporary stands were built for the Odaiba Marine Park to hold triathlon and marathon swimming.

== Transport ==

Two Shuto Expressway lines access Odaiba: Route 11 enters from central Tokyo crossing the Rainbow Bridge, while the Bayshore Route enters from Shinagawa Ward through the Tokyo Port Tunnel and from the bayfront areas of Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture to the east.

By public transport, Odaiba is accessible via the automated Yurikamome transit system from Shimbashi and Toyosu. The privately operated Rinkai Line runs between Shin-kiba and Osaki, but many trains connect directly to Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Ikebukuro. City buses provide cheaper if slower access. Ferries connect Odaiba with Asakusa running along the Sumida River and the Kasai Rinkai Park in eastern Tokyo.
The Tokyo Cruise Ship is a water bus operator in Tokyo that offers services including public lines as well as event cruises and chartered ships. Such as from Asakusa → Odaiba Seaside Park → Toyosu → Asakusa.

== Cultural references ==
Odaiba, the Rainbow Bridge, and other parts of the surrounding area are a major setting of the &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; franchise. The area is noted in many major areas of the plot.

Odaiba serves as the main setting for the multimedia project &quot;Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club&quot;, in which the Tokyo Big Sight building serves as the Nijigasaki High School ((虹ヶ咲学園, &quot;Nijigasaki Gakuen).&quot; Diver City, Sega Joypolis and the Rainbow Bridge can be seen as settings in the animation.

Odaiba may be referenced in the game &quot;Slow Damage&quot; by NITRO CHiRAL. The plot takes place in a city called Shinkoumi, referenced to previously being part of the Tokyo Waterfront. 

Battery No. 6 is used as a key location in the short story &quot;Solitary Isle&quot; by Japanese writer Koji Suzuki included in the Dark Water (short story collection)

<doc id="424447" wikidata="Q4860230" url="?curid=424447" title="Bardu Ali">
<text>Bardu (born Bahadour) Ali (September 23, 1906 – October 29, 1981) was an American jazz and R&amp;B singer, guitarist, and promoter.

==Biography==
It has been reported that Ali was born September 23, 1910, or 1906, in Mississippi. His sister and older brothers born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Ella Blackman, a new Orleans native, and Moksad Ali, an immigrant from Hooghly, in the Indian state of Bengal. There were several children born to this union. A profile of Ali in the Baltimore &quot;Afro-American&quot; in 1926 described Ali as &quot;the son of Makrad Ali, a Turkish silk importer who came to America many years ago... [who married] Elizabeth Ali, a Creole girl of [New Orleans].&quot; While both of these characterizations are incorrect, Ali and his family carried many identities and lived in a multitude of U.S. cities. Two of the older sons moved to Galveston, Texas, but Ella moved to the Bronx, New York, with her other children and her sister Fanny. He got involved with black cinema in the late 1920s and 1930s.

He moved to New York City in the 1920s and became leader of the Napoleon Zyas band. He was master of ceremonies for this band and for the bands of Leroy Tibbs and Chick Webb. He is credited with persuading Webb to hire singer Ella Fitzgerald. He went on tour in England with Lew Leslie&#x27;s &quot;Blackbirds&quot; revue. Returning to the US, he replaced Webb in 1935 as bandleader after Webb died. In 1940, he moved to California, where he became a business partner of Johnny Otis, performed as a singer in Otis&#x27;s band, and opened The Barrelhouse club with him in 1947. He played an important role in the early career of Charles Brown and was Redd Foxx&#x27;s business manager.

<doc id="424449" wikidata="Q332578" url="?curid=424449" title="Deioces">
<text>Deioces () was the founder and the first King of the Median kingdom, an ancient polity in western Asia. His name has been mentioned in different forms in various sources, including the Ancient Greek historian Herodotus.

The exact date of the era of Deioces&#x27; rule is not clear and probably covered most of the first half of the 7th century BC. According to Herodotus, Deioces was the first Median king to have gained independence from the Neo-Assyrian Empire and governed for 53 years. After Deioces&#x27; death, his son, Phraortes, succeeded him.

== Etymology ==
Deioces&#x27; name has been mentioned in various forms in different sources. The Greek historian Herodotus has stated his name as Δηϊόκης (&quot;Dēiokēs&quot;). In Assyrian texts, he has been mentioned as &quot;Da-a-a-uk-ku;&quot; and in Elamite ones, as &quot;Da-a-(hi-)(ú-)uk-ka&quot; and &quot;Da-a-ya-u(k)-ka.&quot;

Deioces&#x27; name is derived from the Iranian &quot;Dahyu-ka,&quot; and is the junior noun of the word &quot;dahyu-,&quot; meaning &quot;the land&quot;. The old Iranian name Deioces was not uncommon even in later times. In the Achaemenid period, the Old Persian form of Deioces has been mentioned in several Elamite inscriptions of the mud plates of Persepolis. Those mentions apparently referred to different persons in separate government regions; and one of them was an individual assigned to the food rationing of the horses.

Friedrich von Spiegel believes that &quot;Dahayuku&quot; means &quot;resident and headman of the village&quot; and is in fact the older form of the word &quot;dehghan&quot; &quot;farmer&quot;. Also following Spiegel&#x27;s theory, Ferdinand Justi believes that Deioces&#x27; name is his title and a shortened form of &quot;dahyaupati&quot; in Old Persian and &quot;danhupaiti&quot; in Avestan having acquired the suffix &quot;-ka&quot;. The name of Deioces may also be related to the modern Kurdish name &quot;Diyako&quot;.

== Dating ==
The era of Deioces&#x27; reign is subject to controversy. Herodotus says that Deioces ruled for 53 years and thus some assumptions have been made about the era of his reign; but it seems that Herodotus&#x27;s report is based on a verbal narrative. Based on Herodotus&#x27;s report, the researchers have concluded that Deioces was the founder of the Median kingdom and also the first Median king having gained independence from the Assyrians. But Herodotus&#x27;s report is a mixture of Greek and Oriental legends and is not historically reliable. Also, it is assumed that the Median king whom Herodotus&#x27;s reports are about is the same Deioces, Phraortes&#x27; father; thus, it is not possible to clarify the exact date of the period of his rule; but it can be said that it probably covered most of the first half of the 7th century BC. Igor Diakonoff says: &quot;The state of the era of Deioces&#x27; reign in Herodotus&#x27;s writings is so different from the picture of that time (745-675 BC) described by the Assyrian sources that some historians have rejected Herodotus&#x27;s statement.&quot;

In Assyrian sources, 674 BC, there are mentions of the actions of a person called Kashthrita, whom some researchers believe to be the same Phraortes. Therefore, the year 674 BC can be considered the end of Deioces&#x27; rule; and by reckoning his fifty-three-year old reign, the beginning of the era of Deioces&#x27; rule should be around 728 BC. Below is a list of the era of Deioces&#x27; reign based on the historians&#x27; views:
== History ==
=== Historicity ===
Herodotus&#x27;s Deioces is sometimes associated with a provincial governor (&quot;šaknu&quot;) named Daiukku, mentioned several times in Neo-Assyrian texts from the time of Sargon II. Daiukku governed somewhat independently a district on the border between the Mannaeans and the Assyrian kingdoms. He allied with the king of Urartu against the Mannaen ruler but was captured by Sargon II, who exiled him and his family to Syria in 715 BC, where he apparently died. However, this association is highly unlikely, as the events mentioned would be located around Lake Urmia and not in Median territory. His namesake might have been one of the many chiefs of free Median districts outside Assyrian control. According to Herodotus, Deioces lived in the late 8th century BC, around the same time as the Median chief Daiku of Saparda. However, the identification would be more justifiable if Daiku were the chief of Hagabta, not Saparda. Hagbata is the only Median settlement mentioned in Assyrian sources whose name is similar to that of Ecbatana, the place chosen by Herodotus&#x27;s Deioces to become the capital of the Median kingdom.

What is known from the Assyrian texts is that from the 9th to 7th century BC, the Medes had not been able to thrive enough to cause the convergence and alliance and organization of the scattered Median tribes and clans around a superior and single leader and lord who could be called the king of all the Median lands. During their several invasions on the Median settled territories, the Assyrian kings always encountered a large number of &quot;local shahs&quot; and not a single king ruling all of the Median lands. After the death of Sargon II in 705 BC, the Assyrians diverted their attention to another spot far from Iran. The opportunity, along with the everlasting fear of the Assyrian invasion, caused the formation of a union of Median princes and monarchs.

According to Herodotus, the Medes were the first people to break free from Assyrian dominance. The Medes were living in small villages with independent rulers, when a certain Deioces embarked on an elaborate scheme to make himself king. In the anarchistic era of the Medes, Deioces tried to enforce justice in his own village and gained a credit and reputation as a neutral judge. Thus, the territory of his activity expanded and the peoples of other villages resorted to him until he eventually announced that the requests of the people are too much and the post is troublesome and difficult for him and he is not ready to continue the work. Following the resignation, theft and chaos increased; and the Medes gathered and chose him as the king in order to settle the disagreements. Deioces thus rose from a commoner to a despot, who united the Median tribes. Under his rule, he established a spearmen guard, and constructed a new capital, Ecbatana, with strong fortifications and a royal palace.

Deioces held a ceremony for the first time; Herodotus states that Deioces stayed in his palace; and his connection was by sending to and receiving messages from the outside; and no one was able to contact the king directly; and the petitions and messages were performed only by the messengers; the limitation was in order to make a sense of fear and respect among the people. Besides, it was forbidden to laugh or expectorate in the king&#x27;s presence. Of his other actions was creating a group called &quot;The King&#x27;s Eyes and Ears&quot;, which consisted of people assigned to spy for the king himself; this organization and group existed during the Achaemenid era.

Diakonoff believes that Deioces could not have been the king of the whole Medes, and was not even the ruler of a large region, and was just one of the small and numerous Median lords; but the illustrious history of the successors shined on his face and gave him fame in history. After Deioces, his son, Phraortes, succeeded him and ruled for 22 years; though some researchers believe that he ruled for fifty-three years (678-625 BC).

=== Ecbatana ===

After his coronation, Deioces&#x27; first action was to appoint guards for himself and also construct a capital. The city which Deioces chose for it was called &quot;Hagmatāna&quot; in Old Persian and Ecbatana in Greek language, believed to be Hamadan today. Ecbatana means &quot;the gathering place&quot; or &quot;a city for everyone&quot; and indicates the gathering of Median clans, which had been disunited before. In the late 8th century BC, he had a fortified castle constructed on a hill in the city to run all the military, government and treasury affairs within.

Herodotus described that the royal complex was made of seven concentric walls, with each internal one higher than the external one. Each of the seven walls were decorated with a specific color: the first (external) wall was white, second wall black, third one high red, fourth blue, fifth low red, sixth wall copper, and the seventh and innermost wall gold. Such a coloring was the symbol of the seven planets in Babylon, but was an imitation of Babylon in Ecbatana. The king&#x27;s palace was situated within the last wall along with its treasures.

However, this narrative of Herodotus&#x27;s is not corroborated by what is written in Assyrian sources, which imply the existence of various masters in the Medes until years after Deioces, and the foundation of an independent royal body and constructing several large royal complexes was not something that the Assyrians could easily remain silent against; thus these words from Herodotus seem exaggerative, or depict an adapted and modified picture of the periods after Deioces&#x27; reign. Nevertheless, Polybius, a famous Greek historian, mentioned this palace in his book and his description of Hamadan, stating the long age of this palace.

According to some historians and archaeologists, the hill that is currently situated in the city and known as the Ecbatana Hill, was the true place of the ancient city of Ecbatana.

Some historians, including Henry Rawlinson, believe that the Ecbatana mentioned in Herodotus&#x27;s writings is not the current Hamadan; and the olden Median capital should be searched in Takht-e Soleymān and in the vicinity of Lake Urmia to the south east. But some researchers, like Jacques de Morgan, believe that Herodotus&#x27;s Ecbatana is the same Hamadan today; and the places of the seven castles of Fort Ecbatana could be identified by the projections on the land and hills.

== In narrative Iranian history ==
Some Iranologists believe Deioces to be the Hushang in Shahnameh due to the features Herodotus states for him and consider the title &quot;Paradat&quot; or &quot;Pishdadian&quot; equal to &quot;the first legislator&quot;. The religious tradition considers Hushang the first person to establish kingship in Iran.

Among Herodotus&#x27;s reports about Deioces and those of Avesta and Middle Persian, Arabic and New Persian texts about Hushang, there are some common features about the identities of Hushang and Deioces; the most important of them can be summarized in three points:
# According to Herodotus, Deioces was the headman of the village during the time; and the name or title &quot;Deioces&quot; meaning &quot;farmer&quot; must have been given to him because of this; and Hushang, according to Arabic and Persian texts, made innovations in agriculture; and thus he probably acquired the title &quot;farmer.&quot;
# Deioces and Hushang were the first legislator and the first king; and thus, Hushang was given the title &quot;Paradat&quot; or &quot;Pishdad&quot; or &quot;Bishdad&quot; and &quot;Fishdad&quot; (Arabic), which was probably an imitation of the name and title of the Assyrian king Sargon of Akkad, meaning &quot;the lawful king&quot;.
# Deioces and Hushang developed housing and urban lifestyle and thus Hushang acquired the name or title &quot;Heoshingeh&quot; or &quot;Hushang&quot; or &quot;Ushhanj&quot; (Arabic).

<text>The East of Scotland Football League (EoSFL) is a senior football league based in the east and south-east of Scotland. The league sits at levels 6–9 on the Scottish football league system, acting as a feeder to the Lowland Football League.

Founded in 1923, it is currently composed of 58 member clubs competing in four divisions. Traditionally clubs were located in Edinburgh, Lothians and the Scottish Borders however the league has now expanded and also includes clubs from Clackmannanshire, Falkirk, Fife, Stirling, and Perth.

Since 2014–15 it has featured in the senior pyramid system. The winners take part in an end of season promotion play-off with the South of Scotland Football League and West of Scotland Football League champions, subject to clubs meeting the required licensing criteria.

==History==

===Original EoSFL===
An earlier East of Scotland League existed between 1896 and 1906, when the supplementary Edinburgh Football League changed its name, after accepting Dundee as a member. There is no connection between the two incarnations of the league.

===Eastern League, 1921-22===
The forerunner of the EOSL was the amateur Eastern League, one of two such leagues this season that had the name, the other being professional and based in the North-East of Scotland. 
The membership would include subsequent EOSL members; Gala Fairydean, Peebles Rovers, Vale of Leithen, Edinburgh Civil Service, Selkirk and Civil Service Strollers. 
Gala were league champions with 17 points from their 10 matches.

===21st century===
The EoSFL was traditionally one of Scotland&#x27;s three &quot;senior&quot; non-leagues which sat outside the Scottish Football League (SFL), the other two being the Highland Football League and the South of Scotland Football League (SoSFL). It was generally viewed as being weaker than the Highland League (with fewer of their club sides defeating SFL sides in the Scottish Cup competition as opposed to the HFL), but was still regarded as being stronger than the South of Scotland League.

Some SoSFL clubs opted to join the EoSFL, including Annan Athletic before they were elected to the SFL in 2008. Dalbeattie Star and Threave Rovers also joined however both subsequently left to rejoin the SoSFL and then later the Lowland League.

A number of the sides in the EoSFL have applied to join the SFL in the past, with Annan Athletic applying in (2000, successfully in 2008), Edinburgh City (2002, 2008), Gala Fairydean (1994, 2000, 2002), Preston Athletic (2000, 2002, 2008) and The Spartans (2008).

In 2004, Threave Rovers pulled out of the league to concentrate their efforts on the South of Scotland Football League. This left the league with an uneven number of clubs, and they were expected to fill the vacancy in the summer of 2005, with Gala Rovers widely touted as likely candidates. However, this did not happen. The only change that happened at that year&#x27;s AGM of the league, was that Tollcross United announced that they would be competing as Tynecastle from the 2005–06 season.

In 2006, Peebles Rovers merged with several local amateur sides to become Peebles, who took Rovers&#x27; place in the league. At the 2007 AGM, agreement was reached to admit the reserve side of Berwick Rangers as the twelfth member of the First Division. They also entered the League Cup, but no other cups during the 2007–08 season. However, the reserves lasted only one season following Berwick Rangers&#x27; relegation to the fourth tier of Scottish football. They were replaced by Stirling University, but returned for the 2010–11 season.

Gretna 2008 entered the league in 2008, formed in the wake of the financial disaster that befell Gretna&#x27;s former club, Gretna F.C. They initially had to play home matches in the nearby town of Annan, the club that took their place in the SFL.

The admission of Duns prior to the 2011–12 season, and then Burntisland Shipyard in 2012–13 brought the number of sides in the EoSFL to 26, the highest it had ever been up to that point.

===Lowland League and decline===
In 2013, the Lowland Football League was formed to act as a direct feeder to the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL), covering an area of Scotland south of the Tay Road Bridge. Nine EoSFL clubs gained entry to the Lowland League, reducing the EoSFL to 20 teams. Hibernian entered a reserve team into the league at the start of the 2013–14 season, but withdrew after one season due to their first team being relegated. Further departures saw the league merged into a single division of 16 teams in 2015–16, which was then reduced to just 11 teams during 2016–17 as more clubs moved to the Lowland League, back to the Juniors or resigned.

===Influx of Junior clubs===
Beginning in 2017 the league experienced a resurgence with SJFA East Superleague champions Kelty Hearts joining from the Juniors. In April 2018, thirteen clubs—most of them from the East Juniors—were accepted into the league for the 2018–19 season, doubling the league&#x27;s membership. When the window for applications was extended to the league&#x27;s AGM in June, even more clubs quit the Junior grade, bringing the total membership up to 39 clubs, split over three conferences. The following season Glenrothes made the same switch. In 2020 a further ten clubs, including the return of Eyemouth United after a year out, boosted the league&#x27;s membership to 49 clubs ahead of the 2020–21 season. The remaining East Region junior clubs south of Tayport (most from West Lothian) joined the league for 2021–22, giving the league a total of 59 members.

==East of Scotland Football Association==
While the EoSFL oversees the leagues and League Cup competitions; the East of Scotland Football Association (EoSFA) is a technically independent body, which organises all of the other cups. It was founded in 1875 as the &quot;Eastern Branch of the Scottish FA&quot;, a title that was vetoed by the Scottish FA. Taking the title Edinburgh FA, it was renamed the East of Scotland FA in 1889. Most of the officials sit on both bodies, and the Executive Committee is a joint organisation. The current President of the EoSFA is Andy McDonald (of Edinburgh City), while the President of the EoSFL is John Greenhorn (of Ormiston).

There are 71 members of the East of Scotland Football Association (EoSFA).

* Six members play in the SPFL:
**Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic ()
**Edinburgh City ()
**Heart of Midlothian ()
**Hibernian ()
**Kelty Hearts ()
**The Spartans ()
*8 members play in the Lowland League:
**Berwick Rangers, Bo&#x27;ness United, Broxburn Athletic, Civil Service Strollers, Gala Fairydean Rovers, Linlithgow Rose, Tranent Juniors, and University of Stirling.

The first teams of the members in the SPFL have little involvement in EoSFA competitions. Youth teams of Hearts and Hibernian formerly contested the East of Scotland Shield, while Bonnyrigg Rose, Edinburgh City, Kelty Hearts and The Spartans participate in the East of Scotland (City) Cup. Berwick Rangers, Hibernian, and The Spartans have all previously fielded reserve teams in the EoSFL.

The EoSFL and EoSFA are full members of the Scottish Football Association.

==Member clubs==

The EoSFL&#x27;s two-tier format, which began in 1987–88, was abolished for the 2015–16 season due to dwindling numbers and replaced with a single division. To cope with the influx of new members in 2018–19, the league consisted of three conferences running in parallel. For 2019–20, the EoSFL was reorganised back into a two-tier setup, with a 16-team Premier Division and two First Division conferences. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no relegation took place in 2020 meaning the Premier Division was temporarily increased to 18 clubs. It reverted back to 16 clubs following the 2021–22 season while the top 7 in the two First Division conferences formed a First and Second Division, with Conference X being renamed the Third Division below.

Listed below are the 58 clubs in the EoSFL for the 2024–25 season. Since 2022–23 the EoSFL setup has featured Premier, First, Second, and Third Divisions, with three clubs promoted and relegated between each division.

<text>Linezolid is an antibiotic used for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. Linezolid is active against most Gram-positive bacteria that cause disease, including streptococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA). The main uses are infections of the skin and pneumonia although it may be used for a variety of other infections including drug-resistant tuberculosis. It is used either by injection into a vein or by mouth.
When given for short periods, linezolid is a relatively safe antibiotic. It can be used in people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common side effects with short-term use include headache, diarrhea, rash, and nausea. Serious side effects may include serotonin syndrome, bone marrow suppression, and high blood lactate levels, particularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for longer periods it may cause nerve damage, including optic nerve damage, which may be irreversible.
As a protein synthesis inhibitor, linezolid works by suppressing bacterial protein production. This either stops growth or results in bacterial death. Although many antibiotics work this way, the exact mechanism of action of linezolid appears to be unique in that it blocks the initiation of protein production, rather than one of the later steps. As of 2014, bacterial resistance to linezolid has remained low. Linezolid is a member of the oxazolidinone class of medications.
Linezolid was discovered in the mid-1990s, and was approved for commercial use in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies linezolid as critically important for human medicine. Linezolid is available as a generic medication. 
==Medical uses==
The main use of linezolid is the treatment of severe infections caused by aerobic Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics; it should not be used against bacteria that are sensitive to drugs with a narrower spectrum of activity, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. In both the popular press and the scientific literature, linezolid has been called a &quot;reserve antibiotic&quot;—one that should be used sparingly so that it will remain effective as a drug of last resort against potentially intractable infections.

In the United States, the indications for linezolid use approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are the treatment of vancomycin-resistant &quot;Enterococcus&quot; &quot;faecium&quot; infections, with or without bacterial invasion of the bloodstream; nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired) and community-acquired pneumonia caused by &quot;S. aureus&quot; or &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;; complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible bacteria, including diabetic foot infection, unless complicated by osteomyelitis (infection of the bone and bone marrow); and &quot;uncomplicated&quot; skin and soft tissue infections caused by &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; or &quot;S. aureus&quot;. The manufacturer advises against the use of linezolid for community-acquired pneumonia or &quot;uncomplicated&quot; skin and soft tissue infections caused by MRSA. In the United Kingdom, pneumonia and cSSSIs are the only indications noted in the product labeling.

Linezolid appears to be as safe and effective for use in children and newborns as it is in adults.

===Skin and soft tissue infections===
A large meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found linezolid to be more effective than glycopeptide antibiotics (such as vancomycin and teicoplanin) and beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and smaller studies appear to confirm its superiority over teicoplanin in the treatment of all serious Gram-positive infections.

In the treatment of diabetic foot infections, linezolid appears to be cheaper and more effective than vancomycin. In a 2004 open-label study, it was as effective as ampicillin/sulbactam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and far superior in patients with foot ulcers and no osteomyelitis, but with significantly higher rates of adverse effects. A 2008 meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials, however, found that linezolid treatment failed as often as other antibiotics, regardless of whether patients had osteomyelitis.

Some authors have recommended that combinations of cheaper or more cost-effective drugs (such as co-trimoxazole with rifampicin or clindamycin) be tried before linezolid in the treatment of SSTIs when susceptibility of the causative organism allows it.

===Pneumonia===
No significant difference appears in treatment success rates between linezolid, glycopeptides, or appropriate beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of pneumonia. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that linezolid be reserved for cases in which MRSA has been confirmed as the causative organism, or when MRSA infection is suspected based on the clinical presentation. The guidelines of the British Thoracic Society do not recommend it as first-line treatment, but rather as an alternative to vancomycin. Linezolid is also an acceptable second-line treatment for community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia when penicillin resistance is present.

U.S. guidelines recommend either linezolid or vancomycin as the first-line treatment for hospital-acquired (nosocomial) MRSA pneumonia. Some studies have suggested that linezolid is better than vancomycin against nosocomial pneumonia, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by MRSA, perhaps because the penetration of linezolid into bronchial fluids is much higher than that of vancomycin. Several issues in study design have been raised, however, calling into question results that suggest the superiority of linezolid. Regardless, linezolid&#x27;s advantages include its high oral bioavailability—which allows easy switching to oral therapy—and the fact that poor kidney function is not an obstacle to use. In contrast, achieving the correct dosage of vancomycin in patients with kidney failure is very difficult.

===Other===
It is traditionally believed that so-called &quot;deep&quot; infections—such as osteomyelitis or infective endocarditis—should be treated with bactericidal antibiotics, not bacteriostatic ones. Nevertheless, preclinical studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of linezolid for these infections, and the drug has been used successfully to treat them in clinical practice. Linezolid appears to be a reasonable therapeutic option for infective endocarditis caused by multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, despite a lack of high-quality evidence to support this use. Results in the treatment of enterococcal endocarditis have varied, with some cases treated successfully and others not responding to therapy. Low- to medium-quality evidence is also mounting for its use in bone and joint infections, including chronic osteomyelitis, although adverse effects are a significant concern when long-term use is necessary.

In combination with other drugs, linezolid has been used to treat tuberculosis. The optimal dose for this purpose has not been established. In adults, daily and twice-daily dosing have been used to good effect. Many months of treatment are often required, and the rate of adverse effects is high regardless of dosage. There is not enough reliable evidence of efficacy and safety to support this indication as a routine use.

Linezolid has been studied as an alternative to vancomycin in the treatment of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients when Gram-positive infection is suspected. It is also one of few antibiotics that diffuse into the vitreous humor, and may therefore be effective in treating endophthalmitis (inflammation of the inner linings and cavities of the eye) caused by susceptible bacteria. Again, there is little evidence for its use in this setting, as infectious endophthalmitis is treated widely and effectively with vancomycin injected directly into the eye.

====Infections of the central nervous system====
In animal studies of meningitis caused by &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, linezolid was found to penetrate well into cerebrospinal fluid, but its effectiveness was inferior to that of other antibiotics. There does not appear to be enough high-quality evidence to support the routine use of linezolid to treat bacterial meningitis. Nonetheless, it has been used successfully in many cases of central nervous system infection—including meningitis—caused by susceptible bacteria, and has also been suggested as a reasonable choice for this indication when treatment options are limited or when other antibiotics have failed. The guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend linezolid as the first-line drug of choice for VRE meningitis, and as an alternative to vancomycin for MRSA meningitis. Linezolid appears superior to vancomycin in treating community-acquired MRSA infections of the central nervous system, although very few cases of such infections have been published ().

====Catheter-related infections====
In March 2007, the FDA reported the results of a randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial comparing linezolid to vancomycin in the treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Patients treated with vancomycin could be switched to oxacillin or dicloxacillin if the bacteria that caused their infection was found to be susceptible, and patients in both groups (linezolid and vancomycin) could receive specific treatment against Gram-negative bacteria if necessary. The study itself was published in January 2009.

Linezolid was associated with significantly greater mortality than the comparator antibiotics. When data from all participants were pooled, the study found that 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The difference was found to be due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as vancomycin. In light of these results, the FDA issued an alert reminding healthcare professionals that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed or suspected.

===Specific populations===
In adults and children over the age of 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.

Linezolid is in U.S. pregnancy category C, meaning there have been no adequate studies of its safety when used by pregnant women, and although animal studies have shown mild toxicity to the fetus, the benefits of using the drug may outweigh its risks. It also passes into breast milk, although the clinical significance of this (if any) is unknown.

===Spectrum of activity===

Linezolid is effective against all clinically important Gram-positive bacteria—those whose cell wall contains a thick layer of peptidoglycan and no outer membrane—notably &quot;Enterococcus faecium&quot; and &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot; (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci), &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (including methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, MRSA), &quot;Streptococcus agalactiae&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, the &quot;viridans&quot; group streptococci, &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, and &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; species (the latter being among the most susceptible to linezolid, with minimum inhibitory concentrations routinely below 0.5 mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active &quot;in vitro&quot; against several mycobacteria. It appears to be very effective against &quot;Nocardia&quot;, but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment.

Linezolid is considered bacteriostatic against most organisms—that is, it stops their growth and reproduction without actually killing them—but has some bactericidal (killing) activity against streptococci. Some authors have noted that, despite its bacteriostatic effect &quot;in vitro&quot;, linezolid &quot;behaves&quot; as a bactericidal antibiotic &quot;in vivo&quot; because it inhibits the production of toxins by staphylococci and streptococci. It also has a post-antibiotic effect lasting one to four hours for most bacteria, meaning that bacterial growth is temporarily suppressed even after the drug is discontinued.

====Gram-negative bacteria====
Linezolid has no clinically significant effect on most Gram-negative bacteria. &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; and the Enterobacteriaceae, for instance, are not susceptible. &quot;In vitro&quot;, it is active against &quot;Pasteurella multocida&quot;, &quot;Fusobacterium&quot;, &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot;, &quot;Legionella&quot;, &quot;Bordetella&quot;, and &quot;Elizabethkingia meningoseptica&quot;, and moderately active (having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains of 8 mg/L) against &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;. It has also been used to great effect as a second-line treatment for &quot;Capnocytophaga&quot; infections.

====Comparable antibiotics====
Linezolid&#x27;s spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria is similar to that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin, which has long been the standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared. Other comparable antibiotics include glycopeptide antibiotics such as teicoplanin (trade name Targocid), dalbavancin (Dalvance), oritavancin (Orbactiv), and telavancin (Vibativ); quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid, a combination of two streptogramins, not active against &quot;E. faecalis&quot;); daptomycin (Cubicin, a lipopeptide); and ceftobiprole (Zevtera, a 5th-generation cephalosporin). Linezolid is the only one that can be taken by mouth for the treatment of systemic infections.

==Adverse effects==
When used for short periods, linezolid is a relatively safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). It has also been known to cause thrombocytopenia. Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which may be a sign of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.

Like nearly all antibiotics, linezolid has been associated with &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis, although the latter is uncommon, occurring in about one in two thousand patients in clinical trials. &quot;C. difficile&quot; appears to be susceptible to linezolid &quot;in vitro&quot;, and linezolid was even considered as a possible treatment for CDAD.

===Long-term use===
Bone marrow suppression, characterized particularly by thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; it appears to be the only adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.

Long-term use of linezolid has also been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the &quot;vinca&quot; alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed by a team of researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.

The adverse effects of long-term linezolid therapy were first identified during postmarketing surveillance. Bone marrow suppression was not identified during Phase III trials, in which treatment did not exceed 21 days. Although some participants of early trials did experience thrombocytopenia, it was found to be reversible and did not occur significantly more frequently than in controls (participants not taking linezolid). There have also been postmarketing reports of seizures, and, , a single case each of Bell&#x27;s palsy (paralysis of the facial nerve) and kidney toxicity. Evidence of protein synthesis inhibition in mammalian cells by linezolid has been published.

==Interactions==
Linezolid is a weak, non-selective, reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), and should not be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or serotonergic drugs. There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as paroxetine and sertraline. It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of sympathomimetic drugs such as pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine. It should also not be given in combination with pethidine (meperidine) under any circumstance due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.

Linezolid does not inhibit or induce the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, which is responsible for the metabolism of many commonly used drugs, and therefore does not have any CYP-related interactions.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

Linezolid, like other oxazolidinones, is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor and a weak, non-selective, reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor. As a protein synthesis inhibitor, linezolid stops the growth and reproduction of bacteria by disrupting translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins in bacterial ribosomes. Linezolid inhibits translation at the first step of protein synthesis, &quot;initiation&quot;, unlike most other protein synthesis inhibitors, which inhibit &quot;elongation&quot;. It does so by preventing the formation of the initiation complex, composed of the 30S and 50S subunits of the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA. Linezolid binds to the 23S portion of the 50S subunit (the center of peptidyl transferase activity), close to the binding sites of chloramphenicol, lincomycin, and other antibiotics. Due to this unique mechanism of action, cross-resistance between linezolid and other protein synthesis inhibitors is highly infrequent or nonexistent.

In 2008, the crystal structure of linezolid bound to the 50S subunit of a ribosome from the archaean &quot;Haloarcula marismortui&quot; was elucidated by a team of scientists from Yale University and deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Another team in 2008 determined the structure of linezolid bound to a 50S subunit of &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot;. The authors proposed a refined model for the mechanism of action of oxazolidinones, finding that linezolid occupies the A site of the 50S ribosomal subunit, inducing a conformational change that prevents tRNA from entering the site and ultimately forcing tRNA to separate from the ribosome.

===Pharmacokinetics===
One of the advantages of linezolid is that it has an absolute oral bioavailability of 100% due to its rapid and complete absorption after oral administration; in other words, the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, as if it had been given intravenously. This means that people receiving intravenous linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously.
Taking linezolid with food somewhat slows its absorption, but the area under the curve is not affected.

Linezolid&#x27;s plasma protein binding is approximately 31% (range ) and its volume of distribution at steady state averages  liters in healthy adult volunteers. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached one to two hours after administration of the drug. Linezolid is readily distributed to all tissues in the body apart from bone matrix and white adipose tissue. Notably, the concentration of linezolid in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the lower respiratory tract is at least equal to, and often higher than, that achieved in serum (some authors have reported bronchial fluid concentrations up to four times higher than serum concentrations), which may account for its efficacy in treating pneumonia. However, a meta-analysis of clinical trials found that linezolid was not superior to vancomycin, which achieves lower concentrations in the ELF. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations vary; peak CSF concentrations are lower than serum ones, due to slow diffusion across the blood–brain barrier, and trough concentrations in the CSF are higher for the same reason. The average half-life is three hours in children, four hours in teenagers, and five hours in adults.

Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by oxidation of the morpholine ring, without involvement of the cytochrome P450 system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which accounts for more than 1% of an excreted dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men. There is a strong correlation between linezolid clearance and creatinine clearance.

==Chemistry==
At physiological pH (7.4), linezolid exists in an uncharged state. It is moderately water-soluble (approximately 3 mg/mL), with a log&quot;P&quot; of 0.55.

The oxazolidinone pharmacophore—the chemical &quot;template&quot; essential for antimicrobial activity—consists of a 1,3-oxazolidin-2-one moiety with an aryl group at position 3 and an &quot;S&quot;-methyl group, with another substituent attached to it, at position 5 (the &quot;R&quot;-enantiomers of all oxazolidinones are devoid of antibiotic properties). In addition to this essential core, linezolid also contains several structural characteristics that improve its effectiveness and safety. An acetamide substituent on the 5-methyl group is the best choice in terms of antibacterial efficacy, and is used in all of the more active oxazolidinones developed thus far; in fact, straying too far from an acetamide group at this position makes the drug lose its antimicrobial power, although weak to moderate activity is maintained when some isosteric groups are used. A fluorine atom at the 3′ position practically doubles &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; activity, and the electron-donating nitrogen atom in the morpholine ring helps maintain high antibiotic potency and an acceptable safety profile.

The anticoagulant rivaroxaban (Xarelto) bears a striking structural similarity to linezolid; both drugs share the oxazolidinone pharmacophore, differing in only three areas (an extra ketone and chlorothiophene, and missing the fluorine atom). However this similarity appears to carry no clinical significance.

===Synthesis===
Linezolid is a completely synthetic drug: it does not occur in nature (unlike erythromycin and many other antibiotics) and was not developed by building upon a naturally occurring skeleton (unlike most beta-lactams, which are semisynthetic). Many approaches are available for oxazolidinone synthesis, and several routes for the synthesis of linezolid have been reported in the chemistry literature. Despite good yields, the original method (developed by Upjohn for pilot plant-scale production of linezolid and eperezolid) is lengthy, requires the use of expensive chemicals—such as palladium on carbon and the highly sensitive reagents methanesulfonyl chloride and &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium—and needs low-temperature conditions. Much of the high cost of linezolid has been attributed to the expense of its synthesis. A somewhat more concise and cost-effective route better suited to large-scale production was patented by Upjohn in 1998.

Later syntheses have included an &quot;atom-economical&quot; method starting from -mannitol, developed by Indian pharmaceutical company Dr. Reddy&#x27;s and reported in 1999, and a route starting from (&quot;S&quot;)-glyceraldehyde acetonide (prepared from ascorbic acid), developed by a team of researchers from Hunan Normal University in Changsha, Hunan, China. On 25 June 2008, during the 12th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference in New York, Pfizer reported the development of their &quot;second-generation&quot; synthesis of linezolid: a convergent, green synthesis starting from (&quot;S&quot;)-epichlorohydrin, with higher yield and a 56% reduction in total waste.

==Resistance==
Acquired resistance to linezolid was reported as early as 1999, in two patients with severe, multidrug-resistant &quot;Enterococcus faecium&quot; infection who received the drug through a compassionate use program. Linezolid-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; was first isolated in 2001.

In the United States, resistance to linezolid has been monitored and tracked since 2004 through a program named LEADER, which () was conducted in 60 medical institutions throughout the country. Resistance has remained stable and extremely low—less than one-half of one percent of s overall, and less than one-tenth of one percent of &quot;S. aureus&quot; samples. A similar, worldwide program—the &quot;Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Study&quot;, or ZAAPS—has been conducted since 2002. , overall resistance to linezolid in 23 countries was less than 0.2%, and nonexistent among streptococci. Resistance was only found in Brazil, China, Ireland, and Italy, among coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.28% of samples resistant), enterococci (0.11%), and &quot;S. aureus&quot; (0.03%). In the United Kingdom and Ireland, no resistance was found in staphylococci collected from bacteremia cases between 2001 and 2006, although resistance in enterococci has been reported. Some authors have predicted that resistance in &quot;E. faecium&quot; will increase if linezolid use continues at current levels or increases. Nevertheless, linezolid continues to be an important antimicrobial agent with near-complete activity (0.05% resistance).

===Mechanism===
The &quot;intrinsic&quot; resistance of most Gram-negative bacteria to linezolid is due to the activity of efflux pumps, which actively &quot;pump&quot; linezolid out of the cell faster than it can accumulate.

Gram-positive bacteria usually develop resistance to linezolid as the result of a point mutation known as &quot;G2576T&quot;, in which a guanine base is replaced with thymine in base pair 2576 of the genes coding for 23S ribosomal RNA. This is the most common mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of &quot;E. faecium&quot;. Other mechanisms have been identified in &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; (including mutations in an RNA methyltransferase that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased expression of ABC transporter genes) and in &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;.

==History==
The oxazolidinones have been known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors since the late 1950s. Their antimicrobial properties were discovered by researchers at E.I. duPont de Nemours in the 1970s. In 1978, DuPont patented a series of oxazolidinone derivatives as being effective in the treatment of bacterial and fungal plant diseases, and in 1984, another patent described their usefulness in treating bacterial infections in mammals. In 1987, DuPont scientists presented a detailed description of the oxazolidinones as a new class of antibiotics with a novel mechanism of action. Early compounds were found to produce liver toxicity, however, and development was discontinued.

Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) started its own oxazolidinone research program in the 1990s. Studies of the compounds&#x27; structure–activity relationships led to the development of several subclasses of oxazolidinone derivatives, with varying safety profiles and antimicrobial activity. Two compounds were considered drug candidates: eperezolid (codenamed &quot;PNU-100592&quot;) and linezolid (&quot;PNU-100766&quot;). In the preclinical stages of development, they were similar in safety and antibacterial activity, so they were taken to Phase I clinical trials to identify any difference in pharmacokinetics. Linezolid was found to have a pharmacokinetic advantage—requiring only twice-daily dosage, while eperezolid needed to be given three times a day to achieve similar exposure—and therefore proceeded to further trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved linezolid on 18 April 2000. Approval followed in Brazil (June 2000), the United Kingdom (January 2001), Japan and Canada (April 2001), Europe (throughout 2001), and other countries in Latin America and Asia.

, linezolid was the only oxazolidinone antibiotic available. Other members of this class have entered development, such as posizolid (AZD2563), ranbezolid (RBx 7644), and radezolid (RX-1741). In 2014, the FDA approved tedizolid phosphate, a second-generation oxazolidinone derivative, for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection.

==Society and culture==

===Economics===
Linezolid was quite expensive in 2009; a course of treatment may cost one or two thousand U.S. dollars for the drug alone, not to mention other costs (such as those associated with hospital stay). With the medication becoming generic the price has decreased. In India as of 2015 a month of linezolid, as would be used to treat tuberculosis cost about US$60.

However, because intravenous linezolid may be switched to an oral formulation (tablets or oral solution) without jeopardizing efficacy, people may be discharged from hospital relatively early and continue treatment at home, whereas home treatment with injectable antibiotics may be impractical. Reducing the length of hospital stay reduces the overall cost of treatment, even though linezolid may have a higher acquisition cost—that is, it may be more expensive—than comparable antibiotics.

Studies have been conducted in several countries with different health care system models to assess the cost-effectiveness of linezolid compared to glycopeptides such as vancomycin or teicoplanin. In most countries, linezolid was more cost-effective than comparable antibiotics for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections, either due to higher cure and survival rates or lower overall treatment costs.

In 2009, Pfizer paid $2.3 billion and entered a corporate integrity agreement to settle charges that it had misbranded and illegally promoted four drugs, and caused false claims to be submitted to government healthcare programs for uses that had not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. $1.3 billion was paid to settle criminal charges of illegally marketing the anti-inflammatory valdecoxib, while $1 billion was paid in civil fines regarding illegal marketing of three other drugs, including Zyvox.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Disco Recording was an award presented at the 22nd Grammy Awards in 1980. The Grammy Awards, an annual ceremony that was established in and originally called the Gramophone Awards, are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Gloria Gaynor and producers Dino Fekaris and Freddie Perren won the Best Disco Recording award for the song &quot;I Will Survive&quot;. However, because of a backlash against disco, the Academy discontinued the category before the 23rd Grammy Awards. In 1998, a similar category, Best Dance Recording, began being awarded to honor vocal or instrumental dance tracks, though there were concerns that the genre would be short-lived much like the disco category.

==Background==
Disco is a genre of dance music that emerged in the United States during the 1970s. The experimental mixing of records, combined with the newly acquired ability to play longer tracks, resulted in a genre well-suited for dance parties. During 1973–74, MFSB&#x27;s &quot;Love Is the Message&quot; displayed &quot;early rumblings of the disco sound&quot;, and shortly afterward the songs &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot; by Gloria Gaynor, &quot;The Hustle&quot; by Van McCoy, and &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; by Donna Summer emerged. In 1977, the opening of Studio 54 in Manhattan, and the success of the disco-focused feature film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (which featured John Travolta and music by the Bee Gees), added to the popularity of the disco genre. 

The following year, Paradise Garage opened in Manhattan&#x27;s West Village, the New York radio station WKTU became &quot;all-disco&quot;, and the number of discothèques in the nation reached nearly 20,000. At the 21st Grammy Awards in 1979, &quot;Saturday Night Fever: The Original Movie Sound Track&quot;, was named Album of the Year and the Bee Gees received the award for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for their contributions to the soundtrack album. By the end of 1979, the disco industry was estimated to be worth more than $4 billion, &quot;more ... than the industries of movies, television or professional sport&quot;.
However, the disco fad soon began to decline. On July 12, 1979, just a few months after &quot;Newsweek&quot; had reported on the &quot;[take] over&quot; of disco music, a &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; promotional event known as Disco Demolition Night was held at Chicago&#x27;s Comiskey Park baseball stadium. During a doubleheader intermission, disc jockey Steve Dahl set ablaze a bin full of disco records, causing a riot within the stadium and gaining international attention. Approximately 10,000 disco records were destroyed, and around 50,000 rioters participated in the event, staying on the field, forcing the Chicago White Sox to forfeit the second game. 

Nationally, a &quot;backlash&quot; took hold, as public support for disco music faded. According to author Craig Werner, as quoted in the British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot;, the &quot;anti-disco movement represented an unholy alliance of funkateers and feminists, progressives and puritans, rockers and reactionaries. None the less, the attacks on disco gave respectable voice to the ugliest kinds of unacknowledged racism, sexism and homophobia.&quot; By 1980 &quot;mainstream disco&quot; had ended, by 1985 WKTU had returned to playing rock music, and by the end of the decade the famous dance venues Studio 54, Paradise Garage, and Clubhouse had all closed.

==Award==


In 1979, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences decided to add a Best Disco Recording category for the 22nd Grammy Awards, just as disco was &quot;preparing to die&quot;. Nominated works for the award included &quot;Boogie Wonderland&quot; by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, &quot;I Will Survive&quot; by Gloria Gaynor, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop &#x27;Til You Get Enough&quot; by Michael Jackson, &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; by Rod Stewart, and &quot;Bad Girls&quot; by Donna Summer. On February 27, 1980, during a live telecast from Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, Gaynor was presented the award for Best Disco Recording. Dino Fekaris and Freddie Perren also received awards as the producers of the track. 

However, because of the decreasing popularity of disco, the Academy eliminated the award category before the 1981 ceremony was to be held. According to the organization, disco was &quot;no longer a readily definable separate music form&quot;, although its influence had &quot;permeated all types of pop music&quot;. Despite the award&#x27;s short span, the award helped solidify Gaynor as one of the best-known female disco artists from the 1970s and the song &quot;I Will Survive&quot; as one of the most recognized and top-selling songs from the genre.

Another dance category did not emerge until 1998 when the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording began to honor vocal or instrumental dance tracks, though there were concerns that the award would be short-lived much like the disco category. In 2003, the Academy moved the category from the &quot;Pop&quot; field into a new &quot;Dance&quot; field, which currently contains the category Best Dance/Electronic Album as well.

<doc id="424477" wikidata="Q1075998" url="?curid=424477" title="Ski mountaineering">
<text>Ski mountaineering (abbreviated to skimo) is a skiing discipline that involves climbing mountains either on skis or carrying them, depending on the steepness of the ascent, and then descending on skis. There are two major categories of equipment used: free-heel Telemark skis and skis based on Alpine skis, where the heel is free for ascents, but is fixed during descent. The discipline may be practiced recreationally or as a competitive sport.

Competitive ski mountaineering is typically a timed racing event that follows an established trail through challenging winter alpine terrain while passing through a series of checkpoints. Racers climb and descend under their own power using backcountry skiing equipment and techniques. More generally, ski mountaineering is an activity that variously combines ski touring, Telemark, backcountry skiing, and mountaineering.

Ski mountaineering is set to make its debut as an Olympic Games event in the 2026 Winter Olympics.

== History ==

Military patrol was an official event at the 1924 Winter Olympics, followed by demonstration events at the 1928 Winter Olympics, in 1936 and in 1948. Military patrol is considered to be a predecessor of the biathlon.

From 1992 to 2009, the Comité International du Ski-Alpinisme de Compétition (CISAC), founded by the skiing associations of France, Italy, Slovakia, Andorra, and Switzerland, sanctioned the European Championship. Then the CISAC merged with the International Council for Ski Mountaineering Competitions in 1999, which in 2008 became the International Ski Mountaineering Federation (ISMF).

Outside Europe, international championships started with the 2007 South American Ski Mountaineering Championship and the 2007 Asian Championship of Ski Mountaineering. The 2012 North American Ski Mountaineering Championship was the first edition of a North American Championship of Ski Mountaineering, sanctioned by the United States Ski Mountaineering Association.

In July 2021, the International Olympic Committee announced that Ski Mountaineering had been added as an optional sport at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan Cortina, following a successful debut of the sport at the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics. In October 2021, The Organizing Committee of the 2026 Winter Olympic Games announced that the competition venue chosen for the event was the resort of Bormio. In addition, the sport is scheduled as an optional event during the 2025 Winter World University Games, to be held in Turin, Italy.

== Competition ==

International competition is sanctioned by the International Ski Mountaineering Federation, holding the ISMF Ski Mountaineering World Cup. National bodies sanction national competitions: for example, the United States Ski Mountaineering Association (USSMA), Ski Mountaineering Competition Canada (SMCC), and the Schweizer Alpen Club (Switzerland).

Three important races are the Italian Mezzalama Trophy, the Swiss Patrouille des Glaciers, and the French Pierra Menta.

== Equipment ==
* Bindings: Should be reliable, light, and durable.
* Boots: Should be light and flexible.
* Skis: Width: 60-90 mm to balance performance and weight. Skinnier skis lack performance in softer snow but are lighter while wider skis lack performance in firmer snow and are heavier. Lightweight skis make ascent easier. Length depends on a person&#x27;s height but going shorter than your normal length will be lighter and will be easier on steep terrain.
* Ski skins: Attached to bottoms of skis, used for walking up slopes.
* Rope: Are not always used in ski mountaineering, but if the approach to the summit or drop-in is treacherous, having a rope can help mitigate risk. When choosing a rope, one needs to make sure it is a proper climbing rope, paracord and ropes found in gas stations are not suitable. Some popular climbing rope companies are Sterling, Mammut and Black Diamond.
* Crampons: Are used to help walk and climb on hard packed snow and ice. They usually have 10 or 12 spikes and are secured to your boot using three different methods. The first method is strap-on crampons which are attached by stepping into a basket and then securing with webbing and these fit with any type of boot. The second is hybrid or semi-automatic crampons. These use the welt on the back of your boot along with a basket in the front to hold onto your boot, and also use webbing to help secure them; these are made to work with a certain type of boot. The final type of crampon is an automatic or step-in crampon. These use both the back and front welt on a person&#x27;s boot with webbing to secure them to the boot. These types of crampons are the most secure, but also the most specialized crampon and need specific boots to have them work.
* Touring Bindings: Lightweight alpine touring or telemark bindings. For AT, the pin style toes are the lightest and tour the best.
* Avalanche search and rescue equipment: Beacon (transceiver) – digital transceiver, Probe – at least 2 meters in length, Shovel – any snow shovel works but collapsible shovels are more lightweight and packable, Snow kit- used to help examine snow and snow quality.
* Ice Axe: Used to assist safety in steep snow and ice. No longer than 60 cm, 50-55 cm is preferred.

== Safety ==
* Avalanche Education: Is education in how to safely travel in avalanche terrain and how to rescue others in case of an avalanche. Knowing how to identify and react in avalanche conditions is vital to being safe while ski mountaineering. Most areas with backcountry skiing and ski mountaineering have organizations who teach these courses. Two popular ones are AIARE and AAA.
* Wilderness medicine: When recreating in the outdoors it&#x27;s crucial to possess medical skills and equipment. The importance of medical skills is even more pertinent when you&#x27;re deep in the backcountry. There are multiple companies who teach wilderness specific medical skills, the main few being NOLS and SOLO. They offer certifications ranging from Wildernesses First Aid to Wilderness EMT. With these skills a person should also be carrying a first aid kit with all the necessities for a particular location and terrain.

<doc id="424481" wikidata="Q63930" url="?curid=424481" title="Countess Palatine Hedwig Elisabeth of Neuburg">
<text>Hedwig Elisabeth of Neuburg (Polish: &quot;Jadwiga Elżbieta Amalia Sobieska&quot;; 18 July 1673 – 10 August 1722) was a Polish princess by marriage to James Louis Sobieski. She was the daughter of Philip William, Duke of Neuburg and Landgravine Elisabeth Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt.

She was the grandmother of Charles Edward Stuart, the &quot;Young Pretender&quot; also known as ”Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;.

==Life==
Born at the Stadtschloss in Düsseldorf, she was the fifteenth of seventeen children. Her sisters included Eleonor Magdalene, Holy Roman Empress, Maria Sofia, Queen of Portugal, Maria Anna, Queen of Spain and Dorothea Sophie, Duchess of Parma and mother of queen Elisabeth Farnese. She was raised with her sisters Maria Sophia, Maria Anna and Dorothea Sophie. The sisters were schooled by private tutors in German, Latin, French, Italian, music and dance. Her elder sister Eleonor Magdalene acted as the benefactor of her sisters at the Imperial court.

===Marriage===
In 1689, she was suggested to marry Prince James Louis Henry Sobieski, son of King John III Sobieski of Poland. 
The marriage was arranged in order to secure an alliance between John III Sobieski and the Emperor within the Holy League, as Hedwig Elisabeth was the sister of Empress Eleonor Magdalene, and secure Habsburg support in the future election of Prince James as the next Polish king. From the part of her family, the marriage was arranged with the presumption that Prince James would have a good chance to be elected king of Poland after the death of his father. 

In the negotiations, it was specified that Hedwig Elisabeth would be secured a dowry of 100 000 thaler, and granted lands by the emperor in Silesia with an official residence in Oława, where the couple could settle comfortably under Imperial protection in the case Prince James would not be elected king after his father&#x27;s death. 

The wedding took place on 8 February 1691, and the couple settled in an apartment in the Royal Palace in Warsaw - they would share their place of residence in the Kazimierzowski Palace in Warsaw during the winters, and their property in Oława in Silesia during the summers, where she stayed during the Moldau campaign.

===Poland===
Hedwig Elisabeth was friendly received by her mother-in-law, queen Maria Kazimiera, who actively wanted to win her trust and affection and thus treated her with consideration and charm and gave her several valuable gifts. She did, however, dislike Hedwig Elisabeth&#x27;s German household retinue, as she considered them an obstacle for her daughter-in-law to acclimatize to Poland, and doubted that the Habsburg and Neuburg dynasties would support her son as future king. 

The relationship between Hedwig Elisabeth and Prince James has been given contradictory accounts. Prince James reportedly placed too high demands on everybody around him, including his wife, but he affectionately referred to her as &quot;Little Liesl&quot; and did sometimes listen to her advice. Hedwig Elisabeth was described as a devoted spouse who made great efforts to work for his benefit and give him useful advice to curb unwise actions. In her capacity as a relative of the emperor, she was expected to play the part of a channel and mediator between the Emperor and her in-laws, a task she was asked to perform on several occasions. 

From the beginning, Hedwig Elisabeth was put under pressure to produce a male heir to strengthen her husband&#x27;s future candidacy to the throne. Already in 1691, she had a miscarriage, and the following year, her mother-in-law is known to have recommended her medicine to prevent another miscarriage. In the spring of 1693, she welcomed her mother on a visit to Oława. On 30 May 1693, she gave birth to her first living child, Maria Leopoldyna, in Warsaw in the presence of her parents-in-law and the royal senators. 

In 1696, her father-in-law died, and in the following election of 1696-97, the courts of Vienna and Dusseldorf did support Prince James as candidate for the Polish throne. Hedwig Elisabeth reportedly actively participated in the work to raise funds for the election: she negotiated with the burghers of Wrocław to secure loans for her husband&#x27;s campaign, and she personally received money and jewels from the imperial court of Vienna to use as security for the campaign loans. Despite the efforts, however, the Sobieski Party lost the election. 

===Later life===
The couple retired to their lands in Silesia where they lived under Imperial protection. The failure to produce a living son was still a pressure upon Hedwig Elisabeth, but her mother-in-law commented that a son could sometimes be the cause of a family&#x27;s ruin as well as a blessing, while a daughter could be a blessing, as Hedwig Elisabeth&#x27;s sister the empress had been for her family. She continued to give birth until 1717, the last birth nearly killing her. 

In 1704, during the imprisonment of her spouse and brother-in-law, Hedwig Elisabeth visited the Imperial court in Vienna to use her influence as a relation of the emperor in their favor and negotiate their release. She performed the task despite being heavily pregnant, which caused her a miscarriage. When Peter the Great offered to place James on the Polish throne, he sent his envoy to Hedwig Elisabeth rather than James to make the offer, expecting her to persuade her husband, but she refused.

When her daughter Maria Clementina married James Stuart against the consent of the emperor in 1719, prince James as well as Hedvig Elisabeth herself was held in house arrest in Innsbruck, and was only released and allowed to return to Oława after the mediation of her sisters, Empress Eleonora and Duchess Dorothea Sofia: her husband, however, was exiled from Silesia. The last years of her life she suffered from ill health. On her deathbed, she successfully asked the emperor to allow her spouse to return home and to see to the welfare of her daughters, and her husband was allowed home to attend to her deathbed.

Hedwig Elisabeth was the maternal grandmother of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and the great aunt of Maria Theresa of Austria.

<text>Methicillin (USAN), also known as meticillin (INN), is a narrow-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic of the penicillin class.

Methicillin was discovered in 1960.

== Medical uses ==

Compared to other penicillins that face antimicrobial resistance due to β-lactamase, it is less active, can be administered only parenterally, and has a higher frequency of interstitial nephritis, an otherwise-rare adverse effect of penicillins. However, selection of methicillin depended on the outcome of susceptibility testing of the sampled infection, and since it is no longer produced, it is also not routinely tested for any more. It also served a purpose in the laboratory to determine the antibiotic sensitivity of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; to other penicillins facing β-lactam resistance; this role has now been passed on to other penicillins, namely &quot;cloxacillin&quot;, as well as genetic testing for the presence of &quot;mecA&quot; gene by &quot;PCR&quot;.

=== Spectrum of activity ===
At one time, methicillin was used to treat infections caused by certain gram-positive bacteria including &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, and &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;. Methicillin is only effective against &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; 50% of the time.

Resistance to methicillin is conferred by activation of a new bacterial penicillin binding protein (PBP) &quot;mecA gene&quot;. This encodes protein PBP2a. PBP2a works in a similar manner to other PBPs, but it binds β-lactams with very low affinity, meaning they do not compete efficiently with the natural substrate of the enzyme and will not inhibit cell wall biosynthesis. Expression of &quot;PBPA2&quot; confers resistance to all β-lactams.

These susceptibility data are given on a few medically significant bacteria:
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;: 0.125 – &gt;100 μg/ml
* Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): 15.6 – &gt;1000 μg/ml
* &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;: 0.39 μg/ml

== Mechanism of action ==

Like other beta-lactam antibiotics, methicillin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. It does this by binding to and competitively inhibiting the transpeptidase enzyme (also known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)). These PBPs crosslink glycopeptides (&quot;-alanyl-alanine&quot;), forming the peptidoglycan cell wall. Methicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics are structural analogs of -alanyl-alanine, and the transpeptidase enzymes that bind to them are sometimes called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).

Methicillin is actually a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotic. Penicillinase is a bacterial enzyme produced by bacteria resistant to other β-lactam antibiotics which hydrolyses the antibiotic, rendering it non-functional. Methicillin is not bound and hydrolysed by penicillinase, meaning it can kill the bacteria, even if this enzyme is present.

== Medicinal chemistry ==

Methicillin is resistant to beta-lactamases, which are enzymes secreted by many beta-lactam antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The presence of the directly attached to the side-chain carbonyl group of the penicillin nucleus facilitates the β-lactamase resistance, since those enzymes are relatively intolerant of side-chain steric hindrance. Thus, it is able to bind to PBPs and inhibit peptidoglycan crosslinking, but it is not bound by nor inactivated by β-lactamases.

==History==
Methicillin was developed by Beecham in 1959. It was previously used to treat infections caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria, in particular, penicillinase-producing organisms such as &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; that would otherwise be resistant to most penicillins.

Its role in therapy has been largely replaced by oxacillin (used for clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing), flucloxacillin and dicloxacillin, but the term methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) continues to be used to describe &quot;S. aureus&quot; strains resistant to all penicillins.

<text>Muhūrta () is a Hindu unit of time along with &quot;nimiṣa&quot;, &quot;kāṣṭhā&quot;, and &quot;kalā&quot; in the Hindu calendar.

In the &quot;Brāhmaṇas&quot;, &quot;muhūrta&quot; denotes a division of time: 1/30 of a day, or a period of 48 minutes. An alternative meaning of &quot;moment&quot; is also common in the &quot;Brāhmanạs&quot;. In the &quot;Rigveda&quot; &quot;muhūrta&quot; exclusively means, &quot;moment&quot;.

Each muhūrta is further divided into 30 &quot;kalā&quot;, (1 &quot;kalā&quot; = 1.6 minutes or 96 seconds). Each &quot;kalā&quot; is further divided into 30 &quot;kāṣṭhā&quot; (1 kāṣṭhā ≈ 3.2 seconds). 

==Etymology==
&quot;Muhurta&quot; is a combination of the Sanskrit root words &quot;muhu&quot; (moment/immediate) and &quot;ṛta&quot; (order). The Ṛg Ved III.33.5 accordingly mentions this descriptive term. &quot;Ṛta&quot; refers to the natural, yearly order of the seasons, so &quot;muhūrta&quot; refers to the daily reflection of these. Also, cf., &quot;Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa&quot; X.4.2.18, as below.

==Annual calibration==
The Muhūrtas are traditionally calculated by assuming sunrise at 06:00 am on the vernal equinox, which is the Vedic New Year. Not all of the constellations cross the zenith, so that it is not in every case clear which constellation presides over the Muhūrta. Yet it is clear that one or more prominent features of the correlate constellations, from which the later Muhūrtas draw their respective names, falls within the celestial longitude of the same, drawn from the polar axis.

==Literature==
The term appears as early as the Ṛg Veda, where, according to Monier Williams, it means &quot;a moment&quot;, but does not evidence any specification of an exact periodicity there as received in later works, such as the &quot;Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa&quot;, &quot;The One Hundred Path Riddle&quot; or the &quot;Taittirīya-Brāhmaṇa&quot;, &quot;The Partridge&#x27;s Riddle&quot;.

Pt. Vijay Shrikrishna Jakatdar points to two specific Ṛg Veda passages that employ the term, III.33.5, and III.53.8:

and

Taittirīya-Brāhmaṇa mentions the names of 15 muhūrtas as follows:

# saṁjñānaṁ 
# vijñānaṁ 
# prajñānaṁ 
# jānad 
# abhijānat
# saṁkalpamānaṁ 
# prakalpamānam 
# upakalpamānam 
# upakḷptaṁ 
# kḷptam
# śreyo 
# vasīya 
# āyat 
# saṁbhūtaṁ 
# bhūtam |

Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa describes a muhūrta as 1/15th portion of a day:

It is stated in &quot;Manusmṛti&quot; that 18 &quot;nimeṣas&quot; (&quot;twinklings of the eye&quot;) are 1 &quot;kāṣṭhā&quot;, 30 &quot;kāṣṭhās&quot; are 1 &quot;kāla&quot;, 30 &quot;kālas&quot; are one &quot;muhūrta&quot;, and 30 &quot;muhūrtas&quot; are one day and night.

==Significance (version 1) ==
It is a common practice in Hinduism to perform or avoid activities like important religious ceremonies on the basis of the quality of a particular Muhūrta. One or more Muhūrtas are recommended by the Vedic scriptures when performing rituals and other ceremonies. This is demonstrated in the way &quot;Muhūrt&quot; is used in present-day South Asia for calculating the most auspicious moment for a Vedic-Hindu Wedding ceremony. Astrologers are often hired to calculate a moment for the wedding so that any possible divinely-sourced problems can be averted. Jakatdar suggests a shift in the contemporary temperament regarding the traditional approach to calculating such events, to accommodate the ever increasing complexity of modern life. The muhūrt has the same utility in the marriage rites in Hinduism.

Another example is the so-called Brahma Muhūrta, which is about one and a half hours before sunrise. This particular time, which is associated with the constellations during the Vernal Equinox, is said to be auspicious for practicing yoga. There is also the case of &quot;samayik&quot;, which is part of the initiation rite for the &quot;Svetambar&quot; mendicants or those who pursue a perpetual state of heightened meditative awareness. They take the &quot;samayik,&quot; a vow for life taken for short periods, preferably one or two muhūrts, where one muhūrt constitutes forty minutes.

==Significance (version 2)==
Traditionally, it is common practice amongst Hindus to start or avoid starting significant tasks like religious ceremonies, etc. on the basis of the quality of a particular Muhūrta. The Vedic scriptures also generally recommend one or more Muhūrtas to perform rituals and practices. The most widely known example of this practice:

Brahma Muhūrta, approximately one and a half hours before sunrise or more precisely is 1Hr 36 Mins. i.e. 96 Minutes = 2 Muhūrta or 4 Ghaṭīkā, is recommended in all practices of yoga is traditionally considered most apt for meditation. However, it is clear from the associations of the names with specific constellations that the present Brahma-Muhūrta starts just before 6:00 am during the Vernal Equinox. At present, Jīva-Amṛta and Viṣṇu comprise the two twilight muhūrtas prior to sunrise.

<doc id="424487" wikidata="Q2920781" url="?curid=424487" title="Compressive stress">
<text>Compressive stresses are generated in objects when they are subjected to forces that push inward, causing the material to shorten or compress. These stresses occur when an object is squeezed or pressed from opposite directions. In everyday life, compressive stresses are common in many structures and materials. For instance, the weight of a building creates compressive stresses in its walls and foundations. Similarly, when a person stands, the bones in their legs experience compressive stresses due to the weight of the body pushing down. Compressive stresses can lead to deformation if they are strong enough, potentially causing the object to change shape or, in extreme cases, to break. The ability of a material to withstand compressive stresses without failing is known as its compressive strength.

When an object is subjected to a force in a single direction (referred to as a uniaxial compression), the compressive stress is determined by dividing the applied force by the cross-sectional area of the object. Consequently, compressive stress is expressed in units of force per unit area.

Thus, the formula for compressive stress is,formula_1Where: 

σ is the compressive stress, 

F is the force applied on the object, and 

A is its cross-sectional area. 

As shown in the formula above, compressive stress is typically represented by negative values to indicate that there is compression of an object, however, in geotechnical engineering compressive stress is conventionally represented by positive values. 

Failure of a loaded object occurs when the compressive stress reaches or exceeds its compressive strength. However, in long slender elements, such as columns or truss bars, it can occur at a lower stress because of buckling.

<text>Thomas Johnson (July 11, 1802 – January 2, 1865) was an American missionary in Kansas who founded the Shawnee Methodist Mission in 1830. It was intended to serve and convert the Shawnee, several hundred of whom had been relocated to Indian Territory (which became Kansas) from east of the Mississippi River.

Johnson was a Kansas slave holder and sided strongly with the pro-slavery faction during a period known as Bleeding Kansas. Residents on either side of the slavery question recruited newcomers and fought violently prior to voting as to whether slavery would be allowed in the Kansas Territory. Johnson was elected as a member of the Kansas Territorial Legislature, which temporarily designated Shawnee Mission as the state capital from 1855 to 1856. Johnson was pro-Southern in sympathy but signed a Unionist pledge at the time of the American Civil War.

Johnson County, Kansas is named for him.

==Death==
Johnson was murdered at his home on January 2, 1865, in the last year of the Civil War. It is unknown whether he was killed during a robbery or whether it was a political assassination. Some historians have suggested that his murderers were outraged at his apparent betrayal of the Southern cause.

<text>Thomas Ryder Johnson (17 May 1872 – 17 January 1963) was an Irish Labour Party politician and trade unionist who served as Leader of the Opposition from 1922 to 1927 and Leader of the Labour Party from 1914 to 1927. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for Dublin County from 1922 to 1927. He was a Senator for the Labour Panel from 1928 to 1934.

==Early life==
Born in Liverpool, Johnson worked on the docks for an Irish fish merchant, spending much of his time in Dunmore East and Kinsale. It was this way that he picked up ideas about socialism and Irish nationalism, joining in 1893 a Liverpool branch of the Independent Labour Party. In 1900 he started work as a commercial traveller, then moved in 1903 with his family to Belfast where he became involved in trade union and labour politics.

==Labour activist==
In 1907 Johnson helped James Larkin organise a strike in the port, but had to watch in dismay as the strike, which began with remarkable solidarity between labour, Orange, and nationalist supporters, collapsed in sectarian rioting. 
At various times he was the president, treasurer and secretary of the Irish Trades Union Congress (ITUC) which was, at that time, also the Labour Party in Ireland, until officially founded in 1912 by James Connolly and James Larkin. Johnson became vice-president of ITUC in 1913, and president in 1914.

Johnson sympathized with the Irish Volunteers, many of whom were sacked from their jobs, for illegal activities. During the Easter Rising, he noted in his diary that people in Ireland paid little heed to the fate of the defeated revolutionaries. He succeeded as leader of the Labour Party from 1917, when the party did not contest the 1918 general election. When the British government tried to enforce conscription in Ireland in 1918, Johnson led a successful strike in conjunction with other members of the Irish anti-conscription movement.

==Politician==

He was later elected a TD for Dublin County to the Third Dáil at the 1922 general election and remained leader of the Labour Party until 1927. As such, he was Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil of the Irish Free State, as the anti-treaty faction of Sinn Féin refused to recognise the Dáil as constituted. He issued a statement of support for the Government of the 4th Dáil when the Army Mutiny threatened civilian control in March 1924.

==Later life==
Johnson is the only Leader of the Labour Party who served as Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil. He lost his Dáil seat at the September 1927 general election, and the following year he was elected to Seanad Éireann, where he served until the Seanad&#x27;s abolition in 1936.

In 1896 he met Marie Tregay, then a teacher in St. Multose&#x27;s National school, outside Kinsale. They married in 1898 in Liverpool. Their only son born in 1899, Frederick Johnson, became a well-known actor. Thomas Johnson died on 17 January 1963 at 49 Mount Prospect Avenue, Clontarf, Dublin.

Each summer, Labour Youth holds the &quot;Tom Johnson Summer School&quot; to host panel discussions, debates and workshops.

<text>Gdańsk Bay or the Gulf of Gdańsk is a southeastern bay of the Baltic Sea. It is named after the adjacent port city of Gdańsk in Poland.

==Geography==

The western part of Gulf of Gdańsk is formed by the shallow waters of the Bay of Puck. The southeastern part is the Vistula Lagoon, separated by the Vistula Spit and connected to the open sea by the Strait of Baltiysk.

The bay is enclosed by a large curve of the shores of Gdańsk Pomerania in Poland (Cape Rozewie, Hel Peninsula) and the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia (Sambian Peninsula). The coast of the bay features two very long sandspits, the Hel peninsula and the Vistula Spit. The former defines the Bay of Puck, the latter defines the Vistula Lagoon.

The maximum depth is 120 metres and it has a salinity of 0.7%.

The major ports and coastal cities are Gdańsk, Gdynia, Puck, Sopot, Hel, Kaliningrad, Primorsk and Baltiysk. The main rivers of Gdańsk Bay are the Vistula and the Pregolya. The bay receives the waters of the Vistula direct via three branches—the Leniwka, the Śmiała Wisła and the Martwa Wisła—and indirectly via the Vistula Lagoon with two branches, the Nogat and the Szkarpawa.

==Nautic definition==
By nautic definition, the &quot;Gulf of Gdańsk&quot; is much larger, including also the area of the Baltic Sea in front of the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and the Lithuanian coast.

==History==
The bayshore was the setting of a naval bombardment during the invasion of Poland, the first combat action of World War II.

The bay plays a pivotal role in the American animated television series &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;.

===Kursenieki===

Today the Kursenieki, also known as Kuršininkai, are a nearly extinct Baltic ethnic group living along the Curonian Spit. In 1649 Kuršininkai settlement spanned from Memel (Klaipėda) to Danzig (Gdańsk). The Kuršininkai were eventually assimilated by the Germans, except along the Curonian Spit where some still live. The Kuršininkai were considered Latvians until after World War I when Latvia gained independence from the Russian Empire, a consideration based on linguistic arguments. This was the rationale for Latvian claims over the Curonian Spit, Memel, and other territories of East Prussia which would be later dropped.

<doc id="424499" wikidata="Q1240869" url="?curid=424499" title="Douay–Rheims Bible">
<text>The Douay–Rheims Bible (, ), also known as the Douay–Rheims Version, Rheims–Douai Bible or Douai Bible, and abbreviated as D–R, DRB, and DRV, is a translation of the Bible from the Latin Vulgate into English made by members of the English College, Douai, in the service of the Catholic Church. The New Testament portion was published in Reims, France, in 1582, in one volume with extensive commentary and notes. The Old Testament portion was published in two volumes twenty-seven years later in 1609 and 1610 by the University of Douai. The first volume, covering Genesis to Job, was published in 1609; the second, covering the Book of Psalms to 2 Maccabees (spelt &quot;Machabees&quot;) plus the three apocryphal books of the Vulgate appendix following the Old Testament (Prayer of Manasseh, 3 Esdras, and 4 Esdras), was published in 1610. Marginal notes took up the bulk of the volumes and offered insights on issues of translation, and on the Hebrew and Greek source texts of the Vulgate.

The purpose of the version, both the text and notes, was to uphold Catholic tradition in the face of the Protestant Reformation which up until the time of its publication had dominated Elizabethan religion and academic debate. As such it was an effort by English Catholics to support the Counter-Reformation. The New Testament was reprinted in 1600, 1621 and 1633. The Old Testament volumes were reprinted in 1635 but neither thereafter for another hundred years. In 1589, William Fulke collated the complete Rheims text and notes in parallel columns with those of the Bishops&#x27; Bible. This work sold widely in England, being re-issued in three further editions to 1633. It was predominantly through Fulke&#x27;s editions that the Rheims New Testament came to exercise a significant influence on the development of 17th-century English.

Much of the first edition employed a densely Latinate vocabulary, making it extremely difficult to read the text in places. Consequently, this translation was replaced by a revision undertaken by Bishop Richard Challoner; the New Testament in three editions of 1749, 1750, and 1752; the Old Testament (minus the Vulgate apocrypha), in 1750. Subsequent editions of the Challoner revision, of which there have been very many, reproduce his Old Testament of 1750 with very few changes. Challoner&#x27;s New Testament was, however, extensively revised by Bernard MacMahon in a series of Dublin editions from 1783 to 1810. These Dublin versions are the source of some Challoner bibles printed in the United States in the 19th century. Subsequent editions of the Challoner Bible printed in England most often follow Challoner&#x27;s earlier New Testament texts of 1749 and 1750, as do most 20th-century printings and online versions of the Douay–Rheims bible circulating on the internet.

Although the Jerusalem Bible, New American Bible Revised Edition, Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition, and New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition are the most commonly used Bibles in English-speaking Catholic churches, the Challoner revision of the Douay–Rheims often remains the Bible of choice of more traditional English-speaking Catholics.

==Origin==

Following the English Reformation of the later 16th century, under the monarchs of the House of Tudor, some Roman Catholics went in exile to the European continental mainland. The centre of English Catholicism was the English College at Douai (University of Douai, Kingdom of France) founded in 1568 by Bishop William Allen (1532-1594), formerly of Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, and Canon of York, and subsequently made cardinal, for the purpose of training presbyter / priests to convert the English back again to traditional Catholicism. And it was here where the Roman Catholic translation of the Bible into the English language was produced.

A run of a few hundred or more of the New Testament, in quarto form (not large folio), was published in the last months of 1582 (Herbert #177), during a temporary migration of the college to Rheims; consequently, it has been commonly known as the Rheims New Testament. Though he died in the same year as its publication, this translation was principally the work of Gregory Martin, formerly Fellow of St. John&#x27;s College, Oxford, close friend of Edmund Campion. He was assisted by others at Douai, notably Allen, Richard Bristow, William Reynolds and Thomas Worthington, who proofed and provided notes and annotations. The Old Testament is stated to have been ready at the same time but, for want of funds, it could not be printed until later, after the college had returned to Douai. It is commonly known as the Douay Old Testament. It was issued as two quarto volumes dated 1609 and 1610 (Herbert #300). These first New Testament and Old Testament editions followed the Geneva Bible not only in their quarto format but also in the use of Roman type.
As a recent translation, the Rheims New Testament had an influence on the translators of the King James Version. Afterwards it ceased to be of interest to the Anglican church. Although the cities are now commonly spelled as Douai and as Reims, the Bible continues to be published as the &quot;Douay–Rheims Bible&quot; and has formed the basis of some later Catholic Bibles in English.

The title page runs: &quot;The Holy Bible, faithfully translated into English out of the authentic Latin. Diligently conferred with the Hebrew, Greek and other Editions&quot;. The cause of the delay was &quot;our poor state of banishment&quot;, but there was also the matter of reconciling the Latin to the other editions. William Allen went to Rome and worked, with others, on the revision of the Vulgate. The Sixtine Vulgate edition was published in 1590. The definitive Clementine text followed in 1592. Worthington, responsible for many of the annotations for the 1609 and 1610 volumes, states in the preface: &quot;we have again conferred this English translation and conformed it to the most perfect Latin Edition.&quot;

==Style ==
The Douay–Rheims Bible is a translation of the Latin Vulgate, which is itself a translation of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts. The Vulgate was largely created due to the efforts of Saint Jerome (345–420), whose translation was declared to be the authentic Latin version of the Bible by the Council of Trent. While the Catholic scholars &quot;conferred&quot; with the Hebrew and Greek originals, as well as with &quot;other editions in diverse languages&quot;, their avowed purpose was to translate after a strongly literal manner from the Latin Vulgate, for reasons of accuracy as stated in their Preface and which tended to produce, in places, stilted syntax and Latinisms. The following short passage (&quot;Ephesians 3:6–12&quot;), is a fair example, admittedly without updating the spelling conventions then in use:

Other than when rendering the particular readings of the Vulgate Latin, the English wording of the Rheims New Testament follows more or less closely the Protestant version first produced by William Tyndale in 1525, an important source for the Rheims translators having been identified as that of the revision of Tyndale found in an English and Latin diglot New Testament, published by Miles Coverdale in Paris in 1538. Furthermore, the translators are especially accurate in their rendition of the definite article from Greek to English, and in their recognition of subtle distinctions of the Greek past tense, neither of which is capable of being represented in Latin. Consequently, the Rheims New Testament is much less of a new version, and owes rather more to the original languages, than the translators admit in their preface. Where the Rheims translators depart from the Coverdale text, they frequently adopt readings found in the Protestant Geneva Bible or those of the Wycliffe Bible, as this latter version had been translated from the Vulgate, and had been widely used by English Catholic churchmen unaware of its Lollard origins.

Nevertheless, it was a translation of a translation of the Bible. Many highly regarded translations of the Bible routinely consult Vulgate readings, especially in certain difficult Old Testament passages; but nearly all modern Bible versions, Protestant and Catholic, go directly to original-language Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek biblical texts as their translation base, and not to a secondary version like the Vulgate. The translators justified their preference for the Vulgate in their Preface, pointing to accumulated corruptions within the original language manuscripts available in that era, and asserting that Jerome would have had access to better manuscripts in the original tongues that had not survived. Moreover, they could point to the Council of Trent&#x27;s decree that the Vulgate was, for Catholics, free of doctrinal error.

In their decision consistently to apply Latinate language, rather than everyday English, to render religious terminology, the Rheims–Douay translators continued a tradition established by Thomas More and Stephen Gardiner in their criticisms of the biblical translations of William Tyndale. Gardiner indeed had himself applied these principles in 1535 to produce a heavily revised version, which has not survived, of Tyndale&#x27;s translations of the Gospels of Luke and John. More and Gardiner had argued that Latin terms were more precise in meaning than their English equivalents, and consequently should be retained in Englished form to avoid ambiguity. However, David Norton observes that the Rheims–Douay version extends the principle much further. In the preface to the Rheims New Testament the translators criticise the Geneva Bible for their policy of striving always for clear and unambiguous readings; the Rheims translators proposed rather a rendering of the English biblical text that is faithful to the Latin text, whether or not such a word-for-word translation results in hard to understand English, or transmits ambiguity from the Latin phrasings:

This adds to More and Gardiner the opposite argument, that previous versions in standard English had improperly imputed clear meanings for obscure passages in the Greek source text where the Latin Vulgate had often tended to rather render the Greek literally, even to the extent of generating improper Latin constructions. In effect, the Rheims translators argue that, where the source text is ambiguous or obscure, then a faithful English translation should also be ambiguous or obscure, with the options for understanding the text discussed in a marginal note:

The translation was prepared with a definite polemical purpose in opposition to Protestant translations (which also had polemical motives). Prior to the Douay-Rheims, the only printed English language Bibles available had been Protestant translations. The Tridentine–Florentine Biblical canon was naturally used, with the Deuterocanonical books incorporated into the Douay–Rheims Old Testament, and only 3 Esdras, 4 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasses in the Apocrypha section.

The translators excluded the apocryphal Psalm 151, this unusual oversight given the otherwise &quot;complete&quot; nature of the book is explained in passing by the annotations to Psalm 150 that &quot;S. Augustin in the conclusion of his ... Sermons upon the Psalms, explicateth a mysterie in the number of an hundred and fieftie[.]&quot;

==Influence==
In England the Protestant William Fulke unintentionally popularized the Rheims New Testament through his collation of the Rheims text and annotations in parallel columns alongside the 1572 Protestant Bishops&#x27; Bible. Fulke&#x27;s original intention through his first combined edition of the Rheims New Testament with the so-called Bishops&#x27; Bible was to prove that the Catholic-inspired text was inferior to the Protestant-influenced Bishops&#x27; Bible, then the official Bible of the Church of England. Fulke&#x27;s work was first published in 1589; and as a consequence the Rheims text and notes became easily available without fear of criminal sanctions.

The translators of the Rheims appended a list of these unfamiliar words; examples include &quot;acquisition&quot;, &quot;adulterate&quot;, &quot;advent&quot;, &quot;allegory&quot;, &quot;verity&quot;, &quot;calumniate&quot;, &quot;character&quot;, &quot;cooperate&quot;, &quot;prescience&quot;, &quot;resuscitate&quot;, &quot;victim&quot;, and &quot;evangelise&quot;. In addition the editors chose to transliterate rather than translate a number of technical Greek or Hebrew terms, such as &quot;azymes&quot; for unleavened bread, and &quot;pasch&quot; for Passover.

== Challoner Revision ==

===Translation===
The original Douay–Rheims Bible was published during a time when Catholics were being persecuted in Britain and Ireland and possession of the Douay–Rheims Bible was a crime. By the time possession was not a crime the English of the Douay–Rheims Bible was a hundred years out-of-date. It was thus substantially &quot;revised&quot; between 1749 and 1777 by Richard Challoner, the Vicar Apostolic of London. Bishop Challoner was assisted by Father Francis Blyth, a Carmelite Friar. Challoner&#x27;s revisions borrowed heavily from the King James Version (being a convert from Protestantism to Catholicism and thus familiar with its style). The use of the Rheims New Testament by the translators of the King James Version is discussed below. Challoner not only addressed the odd prose and much of the Latinisms, but produced a version which, while still called the Douay–Rheims, was little like it, notably removing most of the lengthy annotations and marginal notes of the original translators, the lectionary table of gospel and epistle readings for the Mass. He retained the full 73 books of the Vulgate proper, aside from Psalm 151. At the same time he aimed for improved readability and comprehensibility, rephrasing obscure and obsolete terms and constructions and, in the process, consistently removing ambiguities of meaning that the original Rheims–Douay version had intentionally striven to retain.

This is &quot;Ephesians 3:6–12&quot; in the original 1582 Douay-Rheims New Testament:

The same passage in Challoner&#x27;s revision gives a hint of the thorough stylistic editing he did of the text:

For comparison, the same passage of Ephesians in the King James Version and the 1534 Tyndale Version, which influenced the King James Version:

===Publication===
Challoner issued a New Testament edition in 1749. He followed this with an edition of the whole bible in 1750, making some 200 further changes to the New Testament. He issued a further version of the New Testament in 1752, which differed in about 2,000 readings from the 1750 edition, and which remained the base text for further editions of the bible in Challoner&#x27;s lifetime. In all three editions the extensive notes and commentary of the 1582/1610 original were drastically reduced, resulting in a compact one-volume edition of the Bible, which contributed greatly to its popularity. Gone also was the longer paragraph formatting of the text; instead, the text was broken up so that each verse was its own paragraph. The three apocrypha, which had been placed in an appendix to the second volume of the Old Testament, were dropped. Subsequent editions of the Challoner revision, of which there have been very many, reproduce his Old Testament of 1750 with very few changes.

Challoner&#x27;s 1752 New Testament was extensively further revised by Bernard MacMahon in a series of Dublin editions from 1783 to 1810, for the most part adjusting the text away from agreement with that of the King James Version, and these various Dublin versions are the source of many, but not all, Challoner versions printed in the United States in the 19th century. Editions of the Challoner Bible printed in England sometimes follow one or another of the revised Dublin New Testament texts, but more often tend to follow Challoner&#x27;s earlier editions of 1749 and 1750 (as do most 20th-century printings, and on-line versions of the Douay–Rheims bible circulating on the internet). An edition of the Challoner-MacMahon revision with commentary by George Leo Haydock and Benedict Rayment was completed in 1814, and a reprint of Haydock by F. C. Husenbeth in 1850 was approved by Bishop Wareing. A reprint of an approved 1859 edition with Haydock&#x27;s unabridged notes was published in 2014 by Loreto Publications.

The Challoner version, officially approved by the Church, remained the Bible of the majority of English-speaking Catholics well into the 20th century. It was first published in America in 1790 by Mathew Carey of Philadelphia. Several American editions followed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, prominent among them an edition published in 1899 by the John Murphy Company of Baltimore, with the &quot;imprimatur&quot; of James Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore. This edition included a chronology that was consistent with young-earth creationism (specifically, one based on James Ussher&#x27;s calculation of the year of creation as 4004 BC). In 1914, the John Murphy Company published a new edition with a modified chronology consistent with new findings in Catholic scholarship; in this edition, no attempt was made to attach precise dates to the events of the first eleven chapters of Genesis, and many of the dates calculated in the 1899 edition were wholly revised. This edition received the approval of John Cardinal Farley and William Cardinal O&#x27;Connell and was subsequently reprinted, with new type, by P. J. Kenedy &amp; Sons. Yet another edition was published in the United States by the Douay Bible House in 1941 with the &quot;imprimatur&quot; of Francis Cardinal Spellman, Archbishop of New York. In 1941 the New Testament and Psalms of the Douay–Rheims Bible were again heavily revised to produce the New Testament (and in some editions, the Psalms) of the Confraternity Bible. However, so extensive were these changes that it was no longer identified as the Douay–Rheims.

In the wake of the 1943 promulgation of Pope Pius XII&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Divino afflante Spiritu&quot;, which authorized the creation of vernacular translations of the Catholic Bible based upon the original Hebrew and Greek, the Douay-Rheims/Challoner Bible was supplanted by subsequent Catholic English translations. The Challoner revision ultimately fell out of print by the late 1960s, only coming back into circulation when TAN Books reprinted the 1899 Murphy edition in 1971.

==Names of books==
The names, numbers, and chapters of the Douay–Rheims Bible and the Challoner revision follow that of the Vulgate and therefore differ from those of the King James Version and its modern successors, making direct comparison of versions tricky in some places. For instance, the books called Ezra and Nehemiah in the King James Version are called 1 and 2 Esdras in the Douay–Rheims Bible. The books called 1 and 2 Esdras in the King James Version are called 3 and 4 Esdras in the Douay, and were classed as apocrypha. A table illustrating the differences can be found here.

The names, numbers, and order of the books in the Douay–Rheims Bible follow those of the Vulgate except that the three apocryphal books are placed after the Old Testament in the Douay–Rheims Bible; in the Clementine Vulgate they come after the New Testament. These three apocrypha are omitted entirely in the Challoner revision.

The Psalms of the Douay–Rheims Bible follow the numbering of the Vulgate and the Septuagint, whereas those in the KJV follow that of Masoretic Text. For details of the differences see the article on the Psalms. A summary list is shown below:
==Influence on the King James Version==

The Old Testament &quot;Douay&quot; translation of the Latin Vulgate arrived too late on the scene to have played any part in influencing the King James Version. The Rheims New Testament had, however, been available for over twenty years. In the form of William Fulke&#x27;s parallel version, it was readily accessible. Nevertheless, the official instructions to the King James Version translators omitted the Rheims version from the list of previous English translations that should be consulted, probably deliberately.

The degree to which the King James Version drew on the Rheims version has, therefore, been the subject of considerable debate; with James G Carleton in his book &quot;The Part of Rheims in the Making of the English Bible&quot; arguing for a very extensive influence, while Charles C Butterworth proposed that the actual influence was small, relative to those of the Bishops&#x27; Bible and the Geneva Bible.

Much of this debate was resolved in 1969, when Ward Allen published a partial transcript of the minutes made by John Bois of the proceedings of the General Committee of Review for the King James Version (i.e., the supervisory committee which met in 1610 to review the work of each of the separate translation &#x27;companies&#x27;). Bois records the policy of the review committee in relation to a discussion of &quot;1 Peter 1:7&quot; &quot;we have not thought the indefinite sense ought to be defined&quot;; which reflects the strictures expressed by the Rheims translators against concealing ambiguities in the original text. Allen shows that in several places, notably in the reading &quot;manner of time&quot; at &quot;Revelation 13:8&quot;, the reviewers incorporated a reading from the Rheims text specifically in accordance with this principle. More usually, however, the King James Version handles obscurity in the source text by supplementing their preferred clear English formulation with a literal translation as a marginal note. Bois shows that many of these marginal translations are derived, more or less modified, from the text or notes of the Rheims New Testament; indeed Rheims is explicitly stated as the source for the marginal reading at &quot;Colossians 2:18&quot;.

In 1995, Ward Allen in collaboration with Edward Jacobs further published a collation, for the four Gospels, of the marginal amendments made to a copy of the Bishops&#x27; Bible (now conserved in the Bodleian Library), which transpired to be the formal record of the textual changes being proposed by several of the companies of King James Version translators. They found around a quarter of the proposed amendments to be original to the translators; but that three-quarters had been taken over from other English versions. Overall, about one-fourth of the proposed amendments adopted the text of the Rheims New Testament. &quot;And the debts of the [KJV] translators to earlier English Bibles are substantial. The translators, for example, in revising the text of the synoptic Gospels in the Bishops&#x27; Bible, owe about one-fourth of their revisions, each, to the Geneva and Rheims New Testaments. Another fourth of their work can be traced to the work of Tyndale and Coverdale. And the final fourth of their revisions is original to the translators themselves&quot;.

Otherwise the English text of the King James New Testament can often be demonstrated as adopting latinate terminology also found in the Rheims version of the same text. In the majority of cases, these Latinisms could also have been derived directly from the versions of Miles Coverdale or the Wyclif Bible (i.e., the source texts for the Rheims translators), but they would have been most readily accessible to the King James translators in Fulke&#x27;s parallel editions. This also explains the incorporation into the King James Version from the Rheims New Testament of a number of striking English phrases, such as &quot;publish and blaze abroad&quot; at &quot;Mark 1:45&quot;.

==Douay-Rheims Only movement==
Much like the case with the King James Version, the Douay–Rheims has a number of devotees who believe that it is a superiorly authentic translation in the English language, or, more broadly, that the Douay is to be preferred over all other English translations of Scripture. Apologist Jimmy Akin opposes this view, arguing that while the Douay is an important translation in Catholic history, it is not to be elevated to such status, as new manuscript discoveries and scholarship have challenged that view.

==Modern Harvard-Dumbarton Oaks Vulgate==

Harvard University Press, and Swift Edgar and Angela Kinney at Dumbarton Oaks Library have used a version of Challoner&#x27;s Douay–Rheims Bible as both the basis for the English text in a dual Latin-English Bible (The Vulgate Bible, six volumes) and, unusually, they have also used the English text of the Douay-Rheims in combination with the modern &quot;Biblia Sacra Vulgata&quot; to reconstruct (in part) the pre-Clementine Vulgate that was the basis for the Douay-Rheims for the Latin text. This is possible only because the Douay-Rheims, alone among English Bibles, and even in the Challoner revision, attempted a word-for-word translation of the underlying Vulgate. A noted example of the literalness of the translation is the differing versions of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, which has two versions in the Douay-Rheims: the Luke version uses &#x27;daily bread&#x27; (translating the Vulgate &quot;quotidianum&quot;) and the version in Matthew reads &quot;supersubstantial bread&quot; (translating from the Vulgate &quot;supersubstantialem&quot;). Every other English Bible translation uses &quot;daily&quot; in both places; the underlying Greek word is the same in both places, and Jerome translated the word in two different ways because then, as now, the actual meaning of the Greek word &quot;epiousion&quot; was unclear.

The Harvard–Dumbarton Oaks editors have been criticized in the &quot;Medieval Review&quot; for being &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; in their approach; their decision to use Challoner&#x27;s 18th-century revision of the Douay-Rheims, especially in places where it imitates the King James Version, rather than producing a fresh translation into contemporary English from the Latin, despite the Challoner edition being &quot;not relevant to the Middle Ages&quot;; and the &quot;artificial&quot; nature of their Latin text which &quot;is neither a medieval text nor a critical edition of one.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Grampus&quot; (SS-523), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the seventh ship of the United States Navy to be named for two members of the dolphin family (Delphinidae): &quot;Grampus griseus&quot;, also known as Risso&#x27;s dolphin, and the orca, also known as the killer whale.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Grampus&quot;′s keel was laid down on 8 February 1944 at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts. She was launched on 16 December 1944, but World War II ended before she was completed, and she sat idle until construction resumed in 1948. On 26 October 1949, she was both christened — by her sponsor, Charlotte Linné Woodward, wife of Vice Admiral Clark H. Woodward, who also sponsored the previous USS &quot;Grampus&quot; (SS-207) and commissioned.

==Operational history==

===1949-1966===
With her new snorkeling equipment, which permitted her to remain submerged for periods far longer than the World War II fleet submarines, &quot;Grampus&quot; served as a prototype for the GUPPY submarines and also incorporated many features to appear later in nuclear submarines. Attached to SubDiv 61 at Norfolk, Virginia, she participated in a variety of exercises along the East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea, including torpedo and attack exercises, snorkeling tests and demonstrations, and antisubmarine training. &quot;Grampus&quot; also did a great deal of work with the early HUK (Hunter-Killer) antisubmarine patrols, now a vital part of American defenses, to whose development she greatly contributed.

From 5 January to 2 April 1955 &quot;Grampus&quot; proceeded independently to the Mediterranean Sea, where she &quot;showed the flag&quot; at Algiers, Naples, Barcelona, Malta, Beirut, Monaco, and Gibraltar before returning to Norfolk and her routine of exercises and tests, spaced with regular overhauls at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the late 1950s and early 1960s &quot;Grampus&quot; operated out of Norfolk in the North Atlantic.

Under the command of Lieutenant Commander D.A. Kilmer, &quot;Grampus&quot; sailed with Task Force &quot;Alfa&quot; for six weeks prior to 13 February 1964. On 3 April, she deployed with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea until 3 August.

She operated out of the Virginia Capes until entering Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in mid-April 1965 for overhaul. After refresher training and shakedown in the fall, &quot;Grampus&quot; operated along the East Coast engaging primarily in ASW exercises.

She departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 13 May 1966 for the eastern Atlantic and Northern European countries to participate in NATO ASW exercises. Back in Norfolk on 30 August, she resumed operations in the Virginia Capes area and Caribbean Sea until sailing 29 December to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for repairs in the naval shipyard. Shipshape again, she resumed operations with the Atlantic Fleet.

===1967-1981 (Decommissioning and service for Brazil)===

&quot;Grampus&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 May 1972, and sold under the Security Assistance Program to Brazil, where was renamed &quot;Rio Grande do Sul&quot; (S-11). (She replaced the previous &quot;Rio Grande do Sul&quot; (S-11), ex-&quot;Sand Lance&quot;.) After six years of service, she was decommissioned on 16 November 1978 and scrapped on 18 June 1981.

<text>USS &quot;Grampus&quot; (SS-207) was the eighth &quot;Tambor&quot;-class submarine to be commissioned in the United States Navy in the years leading up to the country&#x27;s December 1941 entry into World War II. She was the sixth ship of the United States Navy to be named for &quot;Grampus griseus&quot;, also known as Risso&#x27;s dolphin, a member of the dolphin family Delphinidae. Her World War II service was in the Pacific Ocean. She completed five war patrols in the following 14 months, and is credited with sinking over 45,000 tons of Japanese merchant shipping and warships. She was declared lost with all hands in March 1943; of the twelve &quot;Tambor&quot;-class submarines, only five survived the war. She received three battle stars for her World War II service.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Grampus&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 23 December 1940, sponsored by Mrs. Clark H. Woodward, and commissioned on 23 May 1941 at New London, Connecticut.

==Operational history==

===Pacific===

After shakedown in Long Island Sound, &quot;Grampus&quot; sailed to the Caribbean Sea with on 8 September to conduct a modified war patrol, returning to New London, Connecticut, on 28 September. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor found &quot;Grampus&quot; undergoing post-shakedown overhaul at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, but soon ready for war on 22 December, she sailed for the Pacific, reaching Pearl Harbor on 1 February 1942, via the Panama Canal and Mare Island.

On her first war patrol from 8 February to 4 April 1942, &quot;Grampus&quot; sank an 8636-ton tanker Kaijo Maru No.2 4 March 1942, the only kill of her short career, and reconnoitered Kwajalein and Wotje atolls, later the scene of bloody but successful landings. &quot;Grampus&quot;&#x27; second patrol en route to Fremantle, Australia, and her third patrol from that base were marred by a heavy number of antisubmarine patrol craft off Truk Lagoon and poor visibility as heavy rains haunted her path along the Luzon and Mindoro coasts.

Taking aboard four coast watchers, &quot;Grampus&quot; sailed from Fremantle on 2 October 1942 for her fourth war patrol. Despite the presence of Japanese destroyers, she landed the coast watchers on Vella Lavella and Choiseul islands while conducting her patrol. This patrol, during the height of the Guadalcanal campaign, took &quot;Grampus&quot; into waters teeming with Japanese men-of-war. She sighted a total of four enemy cruisers and 79 destroyers in five different convoys. Although she conducted a series of aggressive attacks on the Japanese ships, receiving 104 depth charges for her work, &quot;Grampus&quot; was not credited with sinking any ships. On 18 October 1942 &quot;Grampus&quot; even scored a direct hit on the &quot;Yura&quot;, but the torpedo failed to explode. She returned to Australia on 23 November.

&quot;Grampus&quot;&#x27; fifth war patrol, from 14 December 1942 to 19 January 1943, took her across access lanes frequented by Japanese submarines and other ships. Air and water patrol in this area was extremely heavy and although she conducted several daring attacks on the 41 contacts she sighted, &quot;Grampus&quot; again was denied a kill.

==Sinking==

In company with &quot;Grayback&quot;, &quot;Grampus&quot; departed Brisbane on 11 February 1943 for her sixth war patrol, from which she failed to return; the manner of her loss still remains a mystery. Japanese seaplanes reported sinking a submarine on 18 February in &quot;Grampus&quot;′s patrol area, but &quot;Grayback&quot; reported seeing &quot;Grampus&quot; in that same area on 4 March. &quot;Grampus&quot; is believed to have damaged the Japanese merchant ship &quot;Keiyo Maru&quot; (6,442 GRT) on 19 February and the Japanese minesweeper on 27 February 1943. On 5 March 1943, the Japanese destroyers and conducted an antisubmarine attack near Kolombangara island. A heavy oil slick was sighted there the following day, indicating that &quot;Grampus&quot; may have been lost there in a night attack or gun battle against the destroyers. The Japanese destroyers had by then already been sunk in the Battle of Blackett Strait, a night action with U.S. light cruisers and destroyers.

When repeated attempts failed to contact &quot;Grampus&quot;, the submarine was declared missing and presumed lost with all hands. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 June 1943.

<text>USS &quot;Grampus&quot; (SS-4), a &quot;Plunger&quot;-class submarine later named A-3, was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for a member of the dolphin family, &quot;Grampus griseus&quot;.

Her keel was laid down on 10 December 1900 at San Francisco, California, by Union Iron Works, a subcontractor for the Holland Torpedo Boat Company of New York City. She was launched on 31 July 1902 sponsored by Mrs. Marley F. Hay, wife of the Superintendent of Construction at Union Iron Works. She was tested at the Holland Torpedo Boat Station.

Her christening was marred by a failure of the ribbon from which the champagne was hung, leading some sailors to believe she was cursed.

The boat was commissioned at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 28 May 1903 with Lieutenant Arthur MacArthur III (brother of General Douglas MacArthur) in command.

Over the next three and a half years, &quot;Grampus&quot; operated out of the San Francisco, California, area, principally in training and experimental work. On 18 April 1906, men from her crew participated in relief efforts after the devastating San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Decommissioned at Mare Island on 28 November, &quot;Grampus&quot; remained inactive until recommissioned on 13 June 1908. Subsequently assigned to the First Submarine Division, Pacific Torpedo Flotilla, in January 1910, and to the Pacific Fleet in March 1911, the submarine torpedo boat operated locally off the California coast until assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet on 28 June 1912. Toward the end of her active service, on 17 November 1911, &quot;Grampus&quot; was renamed &quot;A-3&quot;.

&quot;A-3&quot; remained inactive, at the Puget Sound Navy Yard into 1915. On 16 February 1915, she was hoisted onto the collier , which sailed soon thereafter for the Philippines with &quot;A-3&quot; and her sister ship, &quot;A-5&quot; (ex-), as deck cargo. &quot;Hector&quot; arrived at Olongapo, site of the Subic Bay Naval Base, on 26 March, and returned &quot;A-3&quot; to the water 10 April.

Commissioned at Olongapo a week later, on 17 April, &quot;A-3&quot; was assigned to the First Submarine Division, Torpedo Flotilla, Asiatic Fleet, and remained in active service with that unit until decommissioned at Cavite on 25 July 1921. During World War I, &quot;A-3&quot; patrolled the waters off the entrance to Manila Bay. On 17 July 1920, &quot;A-3&quot; was given the hull number SS-4.

Dismantled and used as a target by ships of the Asiatic Fleet, &quot;A-3&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 January 1922.

<text>The second USS &quot;Grampus&quot; was a side-wheel steamer in the United States Navy. She was named for a member of the dolphin family (Delphinidae): &quot;Grampus griseus&quot;, also known as Risso&#x27;s dolphin.

Originally named &quot;Ion&quot;, she was purchased by Rear Admiral David D. Porter for the U.S. Navy on 22 July 1863, at Cincinnati, Ohio, for US$9750. She was stationed at Cincinnati, Ohio, and used as a receiving ship for the Mississippi Squadron. By 14 November 1863, with Acting Master Elijah Sells in command, she was recognized as a &quot;nice little receiving vessel in first-rate order,&quot; but contained no furnishings or weapons other than ten cutlasses and revolvers.

With Acting Ensign C.W. Litherbury in command, &quot;Grampus&quot; remained at Cincinnati, Ohio, assisting in stripping of ships for conversion to gunboats, and effecting their delivery to fleet staging points for the Mississippi Squadron, principally Cairo, Illinois, and Mound City, Illinois.

&quot;Grampus&quot; was sold to D.D. Holliday &amp; Brothers on 1 September 1868 at Mound City, Illinois.

<text>USS &quot;Grampus&quot; was a schooner in the United States Navy. She was the first U.S. Navy ship to be named for the &quot;Grampus griseus&quot;, also known as Risso&#x27;s dolphin.

&quot;Grampus&quot; was built at the Washington Navy Yard under the supervision of naval constructor William Doughty, based on a design by Henry Eckford. Her keel was laid down in 1820. She was launched in early August 1821. The need to suppress piracy and to maintain ships to catch slavers led to the building of five such schooners, the largest of which was &quot;Grampus&quot;. This was the first building program undertaken by the Navy since the War of 1812.

==Service history==
Lieutenant Francis Gregory commanded &quot;Grampus&quot; on her first cruise as part of the West Indies Squadron, which took her to the Antilles in pursuit of pirates. In the company of , , , , and , &quot;Grampus&quot; engaged in convoying merchant vessels throughout 1821, the presence of the squadron having a marked effect on piratical activity among the islands.

On 16 August 1822, &quot;Grampus&quot; fought a brig flying Spanish colors, but which Lt. Gregory suspected was a pirate. When he called upon her commander to surrender, he was met with cannon and small arms fire. &quot;Grampus&quot; answered in turn, and reduced the bogus Spaniard to a floating wreck in minutes. The brig struck her colors and Lt. Gregory discovered that she was &quot;Palmyra&quot;, a Puerto Rico-based pirate carrying the papers of a privateer as a subterfuge. &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; named the privateer as &quot;Panchetta&quot;, of 18 guns and 92 men. The privateer had suffered 11 men killed.

In 1825, Captain John D. Sloat — commander of &quot;Grampus&quot; — engaged another Puerto Rican pirate, Roberto Cofresí, in battle. Cofresí was captured along with eleven members of his crew, and they were turned over to the Spanish government. Cofresí was jailed in El Castillo del Morro in San Juan.

&quot;Grampus&quot; had a small part in the &quot;Amistad&quot; trials: in November–December 1839, the U.S. government had &quot;Grampus&quot; standing by in New Haven Harbor, so that if the court ruled in favor of the slaves&#x27; Spanish &quot;owners,&quot; they could deport the Africans to Cuba before they could file an appeal. However, the district judge ruled that the Africans had been illegally enslaved and must be returned to Africa. It was the government that appealed on behalf of the slaveholders, and &quot;Grampus&quot; was not needed.

&quot;Grampus&quot; continued her duties in the protection of shipping in the Caribbean Sea and in the South Atlantic Ocean until August 1841, when she was detached from the Africa Squadron while lying at Boston Navy Yard and attached to the Home Squadron at Norfolk, Virginia on 23 January 1843.

&quot;Grampus&quot; was last spoken to by off St. Augustine, Florida on 15 March 1843. She is presumed to have foundered in a gale off Charleston, South Carolina with all hands.

==Fictional namesake==

Author Herman Melville created a fictional whaling ship in his novel Moby-Dick by the name of &quot;Grampus&quot;, its crew briefly mentioned in Chapter 3 as they enter the Spouter Inn after a three years voyage. Although no connection to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s &quot;Grampus&quot; seems to be intended, nor is it even remotely implied, it is still interesting to note that the real &quot;Grampus&quot; disappeared while Melville was serving in the Navy aboard the , the topic of its loss possibly a subject among Melville&#x27;s shipmates. The enigmatic character of Bulkington disappears from the Spouter Inn in the midst of the &quot;Grampus&quot; crew&#x27;s revelries, his shipmates pursuing him into the night with cries of &quot;Where&#x27;s Bulkington?&quot; Later in the book Bulkington turns up as a crewman on board the Pequod, the narrator Ishmael noting it would be Bulkington&#x27;s fate to die at sea, but never mentioning him again in the book.
