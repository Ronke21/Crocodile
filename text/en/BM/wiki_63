<text>The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is a government agency directly under the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is the main regulator of the securities industry in China.

==History==
Indicative of the role of the CSRC, China&#x27;s highest court, the Supreme People&#x27;s Court–at least as of 2004–has declined to handle securities-related litigation directly, instead deferring such judgments to the CSRC.

In November 2022, it stated its role to build &quot;a capital market with Chinese characteristics&quot;.

In 2023, the CSRC was upgraded to a government agency directly under the State Council. Additionally, it was granted responsibility auditing corporate bond issuances from the National Development and Reform Commission.

In late 2023 and early 2024, the CSRC instructed some institutional investors not to sell stocks in order to stabilize share prices.

== Functions ==
China&#x27;s first Securities Law was passed December 1998, and became effective July 1, 1999. The nation&#x27;s first comprehensive securities legislation, it grants CSRC &quot;authority to implement a centralized and unified regulation of the nationwide securities market in order to ensure their lawful operation&quot;. The CSRC oversees China&#x27;s nationwide centralized securities supervisory system, with the power to regulate and supervise securities issuers, as well as to investigate, and impose penalties for &quot;illegal activities related to securities and futures&quot;. The CSRC is empowered to issue opinions or &quot;Guideline Opinions&quot;, which are not legally binding, as guidelines for publicly traded corporations.

==Affiliated bodies==

A number of Chinese financial sector bodies, including all mainland national stock exchanges and futures exchanges and several self-regulatory organizations, are placed under the direct authority of the CSRC:
* Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE)
* Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE), including ChiNext
* National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), including the Beijing Stock Exchange (BSE)
* Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE)
* Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE)
* Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE)
* China Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX)
* Securities Association of China (SAC)
* China Futures Association (CFA)
* Asset Management Association of China (ACAM)
* China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation (CSDC)
* China Securities Investor Protection Fund (SIPF)
* China Securities Finance (CSF)
* China Futures Market Monitoring Center (CFMMC)
* China Market Statistics &amp; Monitoring Center (CMSMC)
* China Institute of Finance and Capital Markets (CIFCM)
* China Securities Information Technology Service (CSITS)
* China Minority Investors Service Center (CSISC)

For example, the CSRC appoints the chairperson and CEO of the exchanges.

<doc id="419773" wikidata="Q890117" url="?curid=419773" title="Bodysurfing">
<text>Bodysurfing is the sport of riding a wave without the assistance of any buoyant device such as a surfboard or bodyboard. Bodysurfers often equip themselves with a pair of swimfins that aid propulsion and help the bodysurfer catch, ride, and kick out of waves. Some bodysurfers also use a wooden or foam handplane, which helps to get one&#x27;s chest out of the water to reduce drag, this is known as handplaning and is an offshoot of bodysurfing.

Some of the best waves for bodysurfing are steep, fast, tubing beachbreak waves that are often unsuitable for boardsurfing; two of the best known are Sandy Beach and Makapuu on the east shore of Oahu in Hawaii. The Wedge, in Newport Beach, California, a ferocious sand-pounding peak wave aptly described by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1971 as &quot;a great big screaming shorebreak,&quot; has for decades been bodysurfing&#x27;s most fearsome and famous break. Other regions with world-class bodysurfing waves include Hossegor (France), Puerto Escondido (Mexico), and Nazaré (Portugal).

Distinguished bodysurfers include Buffalo Keaulana and Sean Enoka of Hawaii; Californians Bud Browne, Candy Calhoun, Larry Lunbeck, and Mickey Muñoz; Wedge riders Fred Simpson, Terry Wade, Kevin &#x27;Mel&#x27; Thoman and Thomas VanMelum; and Australians Don McCredie, Tony Hubbard, Max Watt, and Michael Fay. Hawaiian lifeguard Mark Cunningham, a sublimely smooth master at the board-dominated Pipeline, was unanimously regarded as the world&#x27;s premier bodysurfer from the mid-1970s to the early &#x27;90s; nine-time bodyboarding world champion Mike Stewart then become the sport&#x27;s dominant presence, and was the first to do a barrel roll at Pipeline.

==History==
Bodysurfing predates board-surfing, which itself, University of Hawaii anthropologist Ben Finney suggests, may date as far back as 2000 B.C. Recorded bodysurfing history, however, begins after that of board-surfing. In 1899, Australian Fred Williams was taught to bodysurf by Tommy Tanna, a Polynesian islander brought to Sydney to work as a gardener; Williams in turn taught local &quot;surf-bathers&quot; how to ride waves.

Bodysurfing was first popularized in the United States during the mid-1920s by Olympic swimmer Wally O&#x27;Conner of Los Angeles, who visited local beaches and drew audiences by diving underwater while facing an incoming wave, do a push-turn off the sand, then burst out of the shore-bound white water. (USC football player Marion Morrison, an early California bodysurfer, tore ligaments in his shoulder while riding the surf near Balboa Pier in 1926; finished with organized sports, Morrison made his way to Hollywood and was renamed John Wayne).

In 1931, Los Angeles bodysurfer Ron Drummond published &quot;The Art of Wave-Riding&quot;, a 26-page primer on bodysurfing basics, and the first book of any kind on surfing. California surfer Owen Churchill visited Hawaii the following year and noticed that locals were able to increase the power of their kick stroke—and therefore catch waves easier—after fixing palm fronds to their feet with tar. Churchill kept the idea in the back of his mind, and in 1940 introduced what would become a bodysurfing equipment standard: the Churchill &quot;Duck Feet&quot; swim fin. In another breakthrough, around the same time, Santa Monica lifeguard Cal Porter taught himself how to ride at an angle across the wave face rather than straight to the beach.

Tens of thousands of coast-dwelling Americans had by that time taken to waves. A bodysurfing article published in 1940 by &quot;Life&quot; magazine, &quot;Surf-Riding is a Favorite Summertime Sport,&quot; noted that &quot;almost every boy and girl [in California] is an expert surf-rider.&quot; Board-surfing, mat-riding, and bodyboarding would all become popular in the years and decades to come — and gain far more attention — but bodysurfing, practiced mostly by tourists and day visitors during the warmer months, has always remained the most popular form of wave-riding.

==Contests==
Bodysurfing has no organized contest circuits or leagues, or a definitive world championship. A limited number of individual contests, however, have long been attended by a small international cadre of full-time bodysurfers. Two of the biggest events, both founded in 1977, are the Oceanside World Bodysurfing Championship, held in midsummer, and the Pipeline Bodysurfing Classic, usually held in January. The Pipeline Classic, long regarded as the sport&#x27;s most prestigious contest, became the first professional bodysurfing contest in 1980, but soon returned to amateur status after organizers were unable to find sponsors.

The Pipeline Bodysurfing Classic competition runs at the Banzai Pipeline. The Pipeline Bodysurfing Classic first ran in February 1971.

In the 1988 and 1989 ocean city competition, the first ever back-to-back competitor Greg Carll won both competitions by a landslide. His plaque used to be placed at the far end of the beach till it was taken down to let new comers have the spot. More recently team bodysurfing events have become popular like the Australian Bodysurfing Classic held in Sydney, Australia.

== Hazards ==
Bodysurfing produces frequent spinal injuries and fatalities, as practitioners ride head-first, often in plunging near-shore waves breaking into shallow water.

==In popular culture==

Included among the small number of bodysurfing video titles are &quot;Primal Surf&quot; (2000), &quot;Pure Blue&quot; (2001), and &quot;Come Hell or High Water&quot; (2011). Bodysurfing has also been featured in more than a dozen surf movies and videos, including &quot;Barefoot Adventure&quot; (1960), &quot;Gun Ho!&quot; (1963), &quot;The Endless Summer&quot; (1966), &quot;Going Surfin&quot;&#x27; (1973), and &quot;We Got Surf&quot; (1981). &quot;The Art of Bodysurfing&quot;, a paperback book offering both history and instruction, was published in 1972.

<doc id="419777" wikidata="Q1892581" url="?curid=419777" title="Battle of Cumae">
<text>The Battle of Cumae is the name given to at least two battles between Cumae and the Etruscans:

* In 524 BC an invading army of Umbrians, Daunians, Etruscans, and others were defeated by the Greeks of Cumae. 

* The naval battle in 474 BC was between the combined navies of Syracuse and Cumae against the Etruscans.

The Greek-colonised city of Cumae in southern Italy was founded in 8th century BC in an area towards the southern Etruscan border. 

By 504 the southern Etruscans were defeated by the Cumaeans, but they still maintained a powerful force. In 474 they were able to raise a fleet to launch a direct attack on Cumae.

In the naval battle, after he was called on for military assistance, Hiero I of Syracuse allied with naval forces from the maritime Greek cities of southern Italy to defend against Etruscan expansion into southern Italy. In 474, they met and defeated the Etruscan fleet at Cumae in the Bay of Naples. After their defeat, the Etruscans lost much of their political influence in Italy. They lost control of the sea and their territories were eventually taken over by the Romans, Samnites, and Gauls. The Syracusans dedicated a captured Etruscan helmet at the great panhellenic sanctuary at Olympia, a piece of armour found in the German excavations there. The Etruscans would later join the failed Athenian expedition against Syracuse in 415 BC, which contributed even further to their decline.

The battle was later honored in Pindar&#x27;s first Pythian Ode.

<text>Gandalf Airlines was a regional airline based at Orio al Serio Airport near Milan, Italy, which was operational from 1998 to 2004.

The airline operated a fleet of Dornier 328 aircraft in both jet and turboprop versions to a number of European destinations: Barcelona, Bari, Brescia, Brussels, Catania, Florence, Madrid, Milan, Paris (Charles de Gaulle), Paris (Orly), Pisa, Rome, Stuttgart, Trieste and Verona. Gandalf also had an agreement with Air France to feed the French carrier&#x27;s international flights at de Gaulle.

By November 2003, Gandalf Airlines had cut most of its routes due to financial difficulties. In February 2004 it filed for bankruptcy and suspended all operations. It was later reported that former CEO, Francesco Gaetano Intrieri, who held the position for five months, was accused of financial misconduct involving approximately €480,000,000 to pay personal debts. In 2017, Intrieri conviction of fraudulent bankruptcy was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Cassation. In April 2004 it was reported that Alitalia had acquired the bankrupt airline to gain additional slots at several European airports, mainly in Milan-Linate and Paris (Charles De Gaulle).

<doc id="419786" wikidata="Q164714" url="?curid=419786" title="Danes">
<text>Danes (, ), or Danish people, are an ethnic group and nationality native to Denmark and a modern nation identified with the country of Denmark. This connection may be ancestral, legal, historical, or cultural.

==History==
===Early history===
Denmark has been inhabited by various Germanic peoples since ancient times, including the Angles, Cimbri, Jutes, Herules, Teutones and others.
A 2025 study in &quot;Nature&quot; found genetic evidence of an influx of central European population after about 500 ce into the region later ruled by the Danes.

===Viking Age===

The first mention of Danes within Denmark is on the Jelling Rune Stone, which mentions the conversion of the Danes to Christianity by Harald Bluetooth in the 10th century. Between and the early 980s, Bluetooth established a kingdom in the lands of the Danes, stretching from Jutland to Scania. Around the same time, he received a visit from a German missionary who, by surviving an ordeal by fire according to legend, convinced Harold to convert to Christianity.

The following years saw the Danish Viking expansion, which incorporated Norway and England into the Danish North Sea Empire. After the death of Canute the Great in 1035, England broke away from Danish control. Canute&#x27;s nephew Sweyn Estridson (1020–74) re-established strong royal Danish authority and built a good relationship with the archbishop of Bremen, at that time the archbishop of all Scandinavia. Over the next centuries, the Danish empire expanded throughout the southern Baltic coast. Under the 14th century king Olaf II, Denmark acquired control of the Kingdom of Norway, which included the territories of Norway, Iceland and the Faroese Islands. Olaf&#x27;s mother, Margrethe I, united Norway, Sweden and Denmark into the Kalmar Union.

===Denmark–Norway===

In 1523, Sweden won its independence, leading to the dismantling of the Kalmar Union and the establishment of Denmark–Norway. Denmark–Norway grew wealthy during the 16th century, largely because of the increased traffic through the Øresund. The Crown of Denmark could tax the traffic, because it controlled both sides of the Sound at the time.

The Reformation, which originated in the German lands in the early 16th century from the ideas of Martin Luther (1483–1546), had a considerable impact on Denmark. The Danish Reformation started in the mid-1520s. Some Danes wanted access to the Bible in their own language. In 1524, Hans Mikkelsen and Christiern Pedersen translated the New Testament into Danish; it became an instant best-seller. Those who had traveled to Wittenberg in Saxony and come under the influence of the teachings of Luther and his associates included Hans Tausen, a Danish monk in the Order of St John Hospitallers.

In the 17th century Denmark–Norway colonized Greenland.

After a failed war with the Swedish Empire, the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658 removed the areas of the Scandinavian peninsula from Danish control, thus establishing the boundaries between Norway, Denmark, and Sweden that exist to this day. In the centuries after this loss of territory, the populations of the Scanian lands, who had previously been considered Danish, came to be fully integrated as Swedes.

In the early 19th century, Denmark suffered a defeat in the Napoleonic Wars; Denmark lost control over Norway and territories in what is now northern Germany. The political and economic defeat ironically sparked what is known as the Danish Golden Age during which a Danish national identity first came to be fully formed. The Danish liberal and national movements gained momentum in the 1830s, and after the European revolutions of 1848 Denmark became a constitutional monarchy on 5 June 1849. The growing bourgeoisie had demanded a share in government, and in an attempt to avert the sort of bloody revolution occurring elsewhere in Europe, Frederick VII gave in to the demands of the citizens. A new constitution emerged, separating the powers and granting the franchise to all adult males, as well as freedom of the press, religion, and association. The king became head of the executive branch.

==Identity==

Danishness (&quot;danskhed&quot;) is the concept on which contemporary Danish national and ethnic identity is based. It is a set of values formed through the historic trajectory of the formation of the Danish nation. The ideology of Danishness emphasizes the notion of historical connection between the population and the territory of Denmark and the relation between the thousand-year-old Danish monarchy and the modern Danish state, the 19th-century national romantic idea of &quot;the people&quot; (&quot;folk&quot;), a view of Danish society as homogeneous and socially egalitarian as well as strong cultural ties to other Scandinavian nations.

As a concept, &quot;det danske folk&quot; (the Danish people) played an important role in 19th-century ethnic nationalism and refers to self-identification rather than a legal status. Use of the term is most often restricted to a historical context; the historic German-Danish struggle regarding the status of the Duchy of Schleswig &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; a Danish nation-state. It describes people of Danish nationality, both in Denmark and elsewhere–most importantly, ethnic Danes in both Denmark proper and the former Danish Duchy of Schleswig. Excluded from this definition are people from the formerly Norway, Faroe Islands, and Greenland; members of the German minority; and members of other ethnic minorities.

Importantly, since its formulation, Danish identity has not been linked to a particular racial or biological heritage, as many other ethno-national identities have. N. F. S. Grundtvig, for example, emphasized the Danish language and the emotional relation to and identification with the nation of Denmark as the defining criteria of Danishness. This cultural definition of ethnicity has been suggested to be one of the reasons that Denmark was able to integrate their earliest ethnic minorities of Jewish and Polish origins into the Danish ethnic group with much more success than neighboring Germany. Jewishness was not seen as being incompatible with a Danish ethnic identity, as long as the most important cultural practices and values were shared. This inclusive ethnicity has in turn been described as the background for the relative lack of virulent antisemitism in Denmark and the rescue of the Danish Jews, saving 99% of Denmark&#x27;s Jewish population from the Holocaust.

Modern Danish cultural identity is rooted in the birth of the Danish national state during the 19th century. In this regard, Danish national identity was built on a basis of peasant culture and Lutheran theology, with Grundtvig and his popular movement playing a prominent part in the process. Two defining cultural criteria of being Danish were speaking the Danish language and identifying Denmark as a homeland.

The ideology of Danishness has been politically important in the formulation of Danish political relations with the EU, which has been met with considerable resistance in the Danish population, and in recent reactions in the Danish public to the increasing influence of immigration.

==Diaspora==
The Danish diaspora consists of emigrants and their descendants, especially those who maintain some of the customs of their Danish culture. A minority of approximately fifty thousand Danish-identifying German citizens live in the former Danish territory of Southern Schleswig (&quot;Sydslesvig)&quot;, now located within the borders of Germany, forming around ten percent of the local population. In Denmark, the latter group is often referred to as &quot;Danes south of the border&quot; (), the &quot;Danish-minded&quot; (), or simply &quot;South Schleswigers&quot;. Due to immigration there are considerable populations with Danish roots outside Denmark in countries such as the United States, Brazil, Canada, Greenland and Argentina.

Danish Americans () are Americans of Danish descent. There are approximately 1,500,000 Americans of Danish origin or descent. Most Danish-Americans live in the Western United States or the Midwestern United States. California has the largest population of people of Danish descent in the United States. Notable Danish communities in the United States are located in Solvang, California, and Racine, Wisconsin, but these populations are not considered to be Danes for official purposes by the Danish government, and heritage alone can not be used to claim Danish citizenship, as it can in some European nations.

According to the 2006 Census, there were 200,035 Canadians with Danish background, 17,650 of whom were born in Denmark. Canada became an important destination for the Danes during the post war period. At one point, a Canadian immigration office was to be set up in Copenhagen.

In Greenland, a self-governing territory under Danish sovereignty, there are approximately 6,348 Danish Greenlanders making up roughly 11% of the territory&#x27;s population.

== Genetics ==
The most common Y-DNA haplogroups among Danes are R1b (37.3 %) and I1 (32.8 %).

<text>Jaba Ioseliani (Georgian ჯაბა იოსელიანი; 10 July 1926 – 4 March 2003) was a Georgian politician, member of Parliament of Georgia, writer, thief-in-law and leader of the paramilitary organisation Mkhedrioni.

Born in Khashuri, Georgia, Ioseliani majored in Oriental studies at Leningrad University but did not graduate. He staged a bank robbery in Leningrad in 1948, for which he served 17 years in a Soviet jail. Released in 1965, he later served another sentence for manslaughter. He eventually returned to his native Georgia and graduated from the Georgian Institute of Theater Arts, where he became a professor. He wrote a number of popular plays.

Ioseliani rose to prominence as the leader of the Mkhedrioni, a heavily armed paramilitary group which he founded in 1989. He attempted to take control of large areas of Abkhazia and South Ossetia with the goal of defeating regional separatist elements. In February 1991, his organisation was outlawed by President Zviad Gamsakhurdia and he was imprisoned along with other Mkhedrioni members. In response, Ioseliani accused Gamsakhurdia of trying to take control of state media and silence rivals.

In December 1991, Ioseliani escaped from prison and joined forces with rebel members of the Georgian National Guard to launch a violent coup d&#x27;état that forced President Zviad Gamsakhurdia out of office in January 1992. He was one of the three leaders of the &quot;Military Council&quot; that ruled Georgia from January–March 1992. He subsequently became a powerful figure in the government of President Eduard Shevardnadze, who was forced to rely heavily on Mkhedrioni militiamen because of the weakness of the state security forces. Ioseliani made it clear who he thought was the senior partner: his office in the Georgian Parliament building was located directly above Shevardnadze&#x27;s and he was constantly surrounded with armed followers wherever he went. His actions earned him many enemies: on 13 June 1992, there was a failed assassination attempt against Ioseliani with a car bomb, resulting in the death of 5 people.

Ioseliani played a major role in the War in Abkhazia, which ended in a crushing defeat for government and Mkhedrioni forces in September 1993. Despite this, he was given a formal government position in September 1993 to enforce a national state of emergency in the Western Georgia amidst the Georgian Civil War. This gave him almost unlimited powers to detain people. He used these powers enthusiastically, imposing a severely repressive regime that was widely criticised by international human rights organisations. Supporters of the ousted Gamsakhurdia were vigorously targeted, especially in the pro-Gamsakhurdia region of Samegrelo, where the Mkhedrioni were accused of carrying out a number of extrajudicial killings. There were also widespread allegations that Ioseliani and his supporters were systematically &quot;taxing&quot; businesses and individuals in areas under their control.

On 29 August 1995, Shevardnadze narrowly escaped assassination in a bomb attack. The attack was blamed on a shadowy coalition of &quot;mafia forces&quot; including Ioseliani and others. Ioseliani was detained on 15 November 1995 and held for three years pending trial, then on 10 November 1998 sentenced to 11 years for banditry, terrorism, and conspiring to kill Shevardnadze. He denied the charges and was eventually released in the spring of 2000 in a general amnesty of convicts. He suffered a heart attack on 26 February 2003 and died in a Tbilisi hospital a week later. He is buried in the Pantheon of Didube, Tbilisi.

<text>LATAM Airlines Chile, formerly known as LAN Chile and LAN Airlines, is a Chilean multinational airline based in Santiago and one of the founding companies of the LATAM Airlines Group, the largest airline holding company in Latin America. Its main hubs are in the Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport in Santiago, Guarulhos International Airport in São Paulo and Jorge Chávez International Airport in Lima, with secondary hubs in Bogotá, Quito, Guayaquil and Asunción.

LAN was the flag carrier of Chile until its privatization in the 1990s; it is the predominant airline in Chile, Ecuador, and Peru, the largest carrier in Brazil, and the second-largest airline in Colombia, through its local subsidiaries. LATAM is the largest airline in Latin America, serving Latin America, North America, the Caribbean, Oceania, Asia, and Europe. The carrier was a member of the Oneworld airline alliance from 2000 until 2020.

LATAM Airlines Group was formed after the takeover by LAN of Brazilian airline TAM Linhas Aéreas, which was completed on June 22, 2012. In August 2015, it was announced that both airlines would rebrand as LATAM, with one livery to be applied on all aircraft by 2018. Currently, LATAM Chile and LATAM Brasil continue to work as separate companies, under LATAM Airlines Group acting as the parent company. LATAM Airlines Group is currently the largest airline corporation in Latin America.

==History==
===Early years===
The airline was founded by Chilean Air Force Commodore Arturo Merino Benítez (after whom Santiago International Airport is named), and began operations on March 5, 1929, as &quot;Línea Aeropostal Santiago-Arica&quot; (English: &quot;Postal Air Line Santiago-Arica&quot;), under the government of President Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. In 1932 It was rebranded as &quot;Línea Aérea Nacional de Chile&quot; (English: &quot;National Air Line of Chile&quot;), using the acronym LAN Chile as its commercial name. LAN Chile&#x27;s first fleet consisted of de Havilland Moth planes.

Merino Benitez was a strong defender of Chilean carriers&#x27; exclusivity on domestic routes, differing from most Latin American countries which easily granted authorization on domestic flights to US-based Panagra, influenced by the propaganda made by Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s Atlantic crossing. Also because of this reason, US-built airplanes became more difficult to incorporate to LAN&#x27;s fleet until the beginning of WWII. In 1936, 2 French Potez 560 airplanes were purchased while in 1938, 4 German Junkers Ju 86Bs were incorporated into the fleet. During that same year, a cooperation agreement was established with Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano and the Peruvian carrier Faucett. Another agreement with Lufthansa was signed for flights to and from Europe and America&#x27;s Atlantic coast.


In 1940, given the restrictions imposed during WWII on access to spare parts for the Junker&#x27;s BMW engines, LAN Chile had to replace them with Lockheed Model 10A Electras, adding in 1941 further Lockheed Lodestar C-60 and Douglas DC-3 in 1945.

===Post-war and international service expansion===
On August 23, 1945, LAN Chile became a member of the newly formed IATA. In October 1946, it started international service to Buenos Aires at Morón Airport and in 1947 to Punta Arenas, Chile&#x27;s most distant continental destination.

In December 1954, LAN Chile made its first commercial flight to Lima, Perú. On December 22, 1956, a LAN Chile Douglas DC-6B made the world&#x27;s first commercial flight over Antarctica. Since then, all of LAN&#x27;s DC-6 fleet had painted on their fuselage &quot;Primeros sobre la Antártica&quot; (&quot;The first over Antarctica&quot;), using this same aircraft type for its first commercial service to Miami International Airport in 1958.

LAN Chile entered the jet era in 1963, purchasing three French Sud Aviation Caravelle VI-R, which initially flew to Miami, Guayaquil, Lima, Panama City and within Chile to Punta Arenas, Puerto Montt and Antofagasta.

In 1966, LAN Chile purchased its first Boeing 707 from Lufthansa, in exchange for flying rights in the Lima-Santiago route. With this aircraft model, the company developed new long-haul routes to the US, Oceania, and Europe. LAN-Chile started on April 15, 1967, the route Santiago-John F. Kennedy International Airport and Santiago-Easter Island on April 8. In October 1967 a LAN Chile Sud Aviation Caravelle made the first ILS landing in South America at Lima&#x27;s Jorge Chávez International Airport. On January 16, 1968, the Santiago-Easter Island flight was extended to Papeete-Faa&#x27;a International Airport, in Tahiti, French Polynesia using a Douglas DC-6B. The airline then introduced Boeing 707 jet service on the Santiago – Easter Island –Papeete, Tahiti route in April 1970. On September 4, 1974, this route was extended to Fiji.

In 1969, LAN Chile expanded its destinations to Rio de Janeiro, Asunción and Cali with new Boeing 727s. In 1970, with Boeing 707s, LAN Chile opened its first transatlantic routes to Madrid–Barajas Airport, Frankfurt Airport and Paris-Orly.

Since its inception and until 1970, the airline had its headquarters, main hub, and maintenance center at Los Cerrillos Airport, in southwest Santiago. The restrictions imposed by the growing metropolitan area of Santiago and the need for modern, jet-era airport facilities that could safely accommodate both domestic and intercontinental flights, drove the need to relocate the Chilean capital&#x27;s principal airport from Los Cerrillos to the denser southwest metropolitan region of Santiago to the more rural northwest metropolitan area. For this reason, Santiago International Airport in Pudahuel was built between 1961 and 1967, fully moving LAN Chile&#x27;s flights to this new airport in 1970.

On February 10, 1974, a LAN-Chile Boeing 707 flown by captain Jorge Jarpa Reyes made the world&#x27;s first transpolar non-stop flight between South America (Punta Arenas Airport) and Australia (Sydney Kingsford-Smith Airport).

In 1980, the company replaced its Boeing 727s with the Boeing 737-200 on its domestic routes. Also, McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30s, LAN Chile&#x27;s first wide-body jets, were added for use on routes to Los Angeles, Miami, and New York. That same year, the maintenance facilities were relocated from Los Cerrillos to Arturo Merino Benítez Airport.

In 1985, LAN-Chile implemented a program of flights around the world called &quot;Cruceros del Aire&quot; (&quot;Air Cruises&quot;), pioneers and unique in Latin America. The initial version included two flights per year (April 26 and September 26) on a Boeing 707 named &quot;Three Oceans&quot; because it crossed the Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific oceans, visiting 18 different places. The aircraft was specially prepared for these flights. It had 80 seats in first class, thus providing passengers with ample room for their comfort. Eighty tourists were selected for a 31-day tour that included visits to the main cities of Africa, Asia and Oceania. Such flights were made until 1989, marketed according to their route under various names such as &quot;Around the World&quot;, &quot;Three Oceans&quot;, &quot;Three Continents&quot;, &quot;Mediterranean&quot;,&quot;East-West China&quot;, etc.

In June 1986, Boeing 767-200ERs replaced the DC-10 fleet, with a new route to Montréal–Mirabel International Airport.

In 1988, LAN Chile started construction of its maintenance center at Santiago Airport and added a Boeing 747-100 on lease from Aer Lingus to its fleet during the summer season for its US flights.

===Privatization and internationalization===
In September 1989, the Chilean government privatized the carrier, selling a majority stake in the company to Icarosan and Scandinavian Airlines (49%), which subsequently sold its stake a few years later to local investors. Since 1994, major shareholders have been the Cueto Family and businessman Sebastián Piñera (until 2010), who sold his shares when taking office as President of the Republic of Chile.

The approval from the Chilean Anti-Trust Authority resulted in the acquisition of the country&#x27;s second-largest airline Ladeco on August 11, 1995. In October 1998, LAN-Chile merged its cargo subsidiary Fast Air Carrier with Ladeco, forming LAN Express.

In 1998, LAN established a joint venture with Lufthansa called LLTT (&quot;Lufthansa-LAN Technical Training S.A.&quot;) with the aim of satisfying the needs for aircraft maintenance training in Latin America. LLTT was based at LAN&#x27;s hangars in Arturo Merino Benítez Airport. LLTT was the only A320 Maintenance Simulator (CMOS) training provider in Latin America.

In 2000, LAN Cargo opened up a major operations base at Miami International Airport and currently operates one of its largest cargo facilities there.

In 2002, LAN Chile started its internationalization process through LAN Perú and LAN Ecuador.

In March 2004, LAN-Chile and its subsidiaries, LAN Perú, LAN Ecuador, LAN Dominicana and LAN Express, became unified under the unique LAN brand and livery, eliminating each airline country name on the brands. On June 17, 2004, LAN-Chile changed its formal name to LAN Airlines (which was said to mean &quot;Latin American Network Airlines&quot;, even though the airline says LAN is no longer an acronym) as part of this re-branding and internationalization process; although, when founded in 1929, LAN originally meant &quot;Línea Aérea Nacional&quot; (National Airline).

In March 2005, LAN opened its subsidiary LAN Argentina in Argentina and operates national and international flights from Buenos Aires, and is the third-largest local operator behind Aerolíneas Argentinas and Austral. This subsidiary is also under the LAN brand.

As of August 1, 2006, LAN merged first and business classes of service into a single class, named &quot;Premium Business&quot;.

On October 28, 2010, LAN acquired 98% of the shares of AIRES, the second-largest air carrier in Colombia. On December 3, 2011, AIRES started operating as LAN Colombia under the unified &quot;LAN&quot; livery.

Since May 5, 2016, LAN has been operating as LATAM Airlines. The airline opened many routes during 2017, one of them being the longest flight in their history: Santiago to Melbourne, which started operating October 5 of that year.

===LATAM Airlines Group===

On August 13, 2010, LAN Airlines signed a non-binding agreement with Brazilian Airline TAM Linhas Aéreas for the purchase of LAN from TAM Linhas Aéreas to form the LATAM Airlines Group. The purchase was completed on June 22, 2012. The Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (&quot;CADE&quot;) and the Court for the Defense of Free Competition (&quot;TDLC&quot;) approved the purchase subject to mitigation measures. The airlines have to relinquish four daily slot pairs from São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport to other airlines willing to fly the Santiago-São Paulo route, waive membership in Star Alliance (of which TAM Linhas Aéreas was a member) or Oneworld, and interline agreements with other airlines operating selected routes, among other provisions. It still continued to use its &quot;LAN CHILE&quot; call sign, as well as its post-merger IATA and ICAO identities for its LATAM-operated flights.

During the first half of 2018, the airline experienced problems due to the Rolls-Royce engines on its Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet, having grounded at least six of them since February 2018. In April 2018, its domestic subsidiary LATAM Express suffered a major workers&#x27; strike. This caused several economic losses for the airline. Later that year they began to recover from this and were expected to resume 787 deliveries for 2019, which resumed with CC-BGO in November of that year.

==Corporate affairs==

The airline has its headquarters on the 20th floor of the 5711 Avenida Presidente Riesco Building in Las Condes, Santiago Province. Previously its headquarters were in Estado 10 in downtown Santiago de Chile.

==Destinations==
LATAM flies to 30 international destinations in 16 countries along with 17 domestic destinations in Chile. LATAM Chile was a popular choice for surfers traveling to South America because of their policy of not charging extra baggage fees. However, starting on December 19, 2016, they changed their policy and now charge US$200 per way for a surfboard bag of up to three boards.

On October 5, 2017, LATAM inaugurated their direct route between Santiago and Melbourne, a 15-hour (westbound) and flight. It is currently the southernmost commercial point-to-point flight. The flight&#x27;s great circle passes south of the Antarctic Circle, at a distance of about 800 km from the Antarctic mainland.

In November 2017, the company announced the opening of a direct air route to Asia. The route operated with a flight departing from Santiago, Chile with a stop in São Paulo, Brazil, and from there it proceeded directly to Tel Aviv, Israel. The flights were operated three times a week starting from December 2018 until 2020, using the company&#x27;s Boeing 787. This was the second air route operated by a South American company from South America to Asia.

===Fleet development===
LAN was the launch customer for the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW6000 engine on the Airbus A318. Its Airbus A319s and Airbus A320s are equipped with the IAE V2500s or CFM56s engines. LATAM overhauled its Boeing 767s, adding amenities like flatbed seats in Premium Business class, which offers 180 degrees of recline, and new touchscreen personal TVs with on-demand content.

In May 2008, LAN Chile retired its last 737 from service and was replaced by the Airbus A320s. In addition to its A320 family aircraft and Boeing 767, LATAM purchased the Boeing 787 for its long-haul routes to Auckland, Sydney, and selected European routes, replacing its Airbus A340-300s that left the fleet in April 2015. In 2011, LAN Chile ordered 10 A318s but sold them to Avianca Brasil, in order to purchase another 128 jets from the A320 family and one more A340-300. That year the airline placed orders for more Airbus A320 and brand new Airbus A321 aircraft. LATAM Chile is the American launch customer for the Sharklets for its A320 fleet.

In 2012, LAN Chile became the launch customer in the Americas of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. On November 23, 2014, the airline received their first Airbus A321. This has been the domestic flagship of the airline ever since. On April 17, 2015, the airline officially retired the Airbus A340-300 from their fleet, the last one being CC-CQA. In December 2017 the airline received their first Airbus A320neo. However, months later these were grounded due to an issue with the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1000G engines. LATAM faced many problems caused by both groundings of the A320neo and Boeing 787 aircraft in 2018. Later that year, they started recovering from that.

In 2021, LATAM acquired four Boeing 787-9 aircraft that used to fly for Norwegian Air Shuttle, which entered service in late 2022.

===Former===
LATAM has formerly operated the following aircraft;

LATAM Pass is the airline&#x27;s frequent flyer program to reward customer loyalty. There are currently over four million members. Members earn miles every time they fly with LATAM Chile, an affiliated airline, or by using the services of any LATAM Pass-associated business around the world.

The LATAM Pass program has five membership categories:

*Gold 
*Gold Plus 
*Platinum

The newly renovated LATAM lounges were designed by Chilean architects Mathias Klotz and Olivia Putman.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On April 3, 1961, LAN Chile Flight 621, a Douglas C-47A registered as CC-CLD, on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Temuco Airport (now Maquehue Airport, later La Araucania Airport) to Santiago, crashed into a hillside due to inclement weather near La Gotera Hill, Chile. On board were many members of the Chilean association football club C.D. Green Cross. All four crew members and all twenty passengers on board were killed.
* On February 6, 1965, a Douglas DC-6, operating LAN Chile Flight 107 from Santiago to Ezeiza, Argentina, flew into a mountain near the San José Volcano in the Las Melosas area of the Andes shortly after takeoff. All of the 87 passengers and crew on board died in what is as of 2012 the worst aircraft accident in Chile.
* On April 28, 1969 LAN Chile Flight 160 crashed short of runway at Colina, Chile. None of the 60 passengers and crew were injured in the accident.
* On December 5, 1969, a Douglas C-47A registration CC-CBY, crashed shortly after takeoff from El Tepual Airport, Puerto Montt. The aircraft was operating a cargo flight; all three people on board survived.
* On May 25, 1972, Lan Chile Flight 154, a Boeing 727-100 registration CC-CAG, made an emergency landing at Sir Donald Sangster International Airport after a pipe bomb exploded on board. The aircraft was operating a passenger flight from Tocumen International Airport to Miami International Airport; there were no fatalities or injuries.
* On August 3, 1978, a Boeing 707 registered as CC-CCX was approaching Ministro Pistarini International Airport in thick fog when it struck trees in a gentle descent, some 2500 meters short of the runway threshold and 300 meters out of line with the runway centreline. All 63 people on board the aircraft survived the accident.
* On August 4, 1987, a Boeing 737-200, while on the approach at El Loa Airport, landed short of the displaced threshold of runway 27. The nosegear collapsed and the aircraft broke in two. A fire broke out 30 minutes later and destroyed the aircraft. The threshold was displaced by 880m due to construction work. There was one fatality.
* On February 19, 1991, a chartered BAe 146–200 operating LAN Chile Flight 1069, overran the runway on landing at Puerto Williams in southern Chile and sank in the nearby waters. Of the 73 people aboard, 20 perished.
* On May 18, 2013, an Airbus A340 departing for Sydney from Auckland Airport lined up on what was thought to be the center line of the runway. Instead, it was actually the lights on the edge of the runway and the crew took off without noticing it. The damage wasn&#x27;t discovered until a runway inspection was made.
*On 26 October 2022, LATAM Chile Flight 1325, an Airbus A320-214, was on approach to Silvio Pettirossi International Airport when the aircraft encountered a hail storm. The aircraft lost most of its nose radome, suffered damage to its windshield, and lost both engines which led to the Ram air turbine being deployed. The aircraft made an emergency landing at Asunción with no injuries aboard.
*On 18 November 2022, LATAM Perú Flight 2213, an Airbus A320-271N operated by LATAM Chile, struck a fire truck during its rejected takeoff roll at runway 16 of Jorge Chávez International Airport. The right main landing gear of the aircraft collapsed and the right-hand engine separated from the collision, which started a fire. Everyone aboard the aircraft survived with 24 people sustaining injuries, however, both firefighters aboard the fire truck were killed.
*On 14 August 2023, LATAM Chile Flight 505, a Boeing 787–9 Dreamliner, was cruising 120 miles north of Panama City when the captain became incapacitated and collapsed in the restroom. The relief captain and first officer diverted the aircraft to Panama City&#x27;s Tocumen International Airport. The captain was pronounced dead by medical crews on landing.
*On 11 March 2024, LATAM Airlines Flight 800, a Boeing 787–9 on its way to Auckland, New Zealand, from Sydney, Australia experienced what was described as a technical event during the flight which caused strong movement before landing at Auckland Airport. As a result, 50 people on board were injured, of which 12 were hospitalized and one received possible serious injuries.

<doc id="419801" wikidata="Q6421885" url="?curid=419801" title="Kneeboarding (surfsport)">
<text>Kneeboarding is a discipline of surfing where the rider paddles on his or her belly into a wave on a &quot;kneeboard&quot;, then rides the wave face typically on both knees. The typical kneeboard is between in length, with a wide round nose and constructed of Glassfibre over a polyurethane foam core. Kneeboard designers however are known for their wild experimental excess and so most modern materials including various aerospace elements such as Titanium alloys (for fins), carbon fibre and kevlar in epoxy matrices are not unusual. 
Modern kneeboards may have a rubber pad for the rider&#x27;s knees, preventing undue wear of the knees, also preventing slipping to help the rider maintain control. Kneeboarders also typically use swimfins and an ankle surfleash.

Kneeboarding popularity increased markedly with the release of the surf movie &quot;Crystal Voyager&quot; by the most prominent of kneeboard riders, Californian, George Greenough. The music of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Meddle&quot; combined with spectacular slow-motion images by Mr. Greenough, filming inside the tube whilst surfing a &quot;spoon&quot; kneeboard, changed surfing&#x27;s direction, influenced board and fin design and earned him a Palme d&#x27;Or for short film at the Cannes film festival in the late 1960s.

The advantage of kneeboarding is the ability it gives the rider to deal with tube rides that might require too quick of a take off for a standup surfer or bodyboarder to get into and might get too tight or steep for a stand-up board surfer to deal with. Being closer to the Face of the wave, the feeling of speed is more enhanced, with a resulting increase in excitement. It seems that kneeboarding is where the best of the skill sets unique to each of the surfing disciplines &quot;comes together&quot;.

<doc id="419802" wikidata="Q161432" url="?curid=419802" title="Nuevo Continente">
<text>Nuevo Continente was a passenger airline based in Lima, Peru, operating scheduled domestic and international flights out of Jorge Chavez International Airport.

== History ==
The airline was founded by Fernando Zevallos in 1992 as &quot;Aero Continente&quot;. Flight operations were launched on 25 May of that year, initially on regional chartered routes on behalf of Occidental Petroleum, a US-based oil and gas company. Scheduled domestic passenger services commenced on 20 July 1993, using a fleet of just two aircraft: a Boeing 727-100 and a Boeing 737-200. At that time, the Peruvian airline market was dominated by Faucett and Aeroperú. Aero Continente competed with these airlines by offering extremely low ticket fares.

When Faucett and Aéroperu both went bankrupt in 1999 due to financial difficulties, Aero Continente acquired a monopoly position as the only airline operating on domestic routes in the country. By that time, the fleet size had been increased to approximately 30 aircraft, mainly of the 737 type, though larger aircraft like the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar were also used. During that period, international routes were launched, the first ones connecting Lima with Panama City and Santiago de Chile. This coincided with the foundation of &quot;Aero Continente Chile&quot;, a wholly owned subsidiary aiming at the Chile domestic market using a fleet of five Boeing 737-200 aircraft handed down from its parent.

During the 1990s, the safety reputation of the Peruvian airline industry became a public concern after a series of high-profile accidents; especially Faucett&#x27;s crash in Arequipa and Aeroperú Flight 603, both in 1996. In August of that year, the US Embassy in Lima issued a ban on their employees from flying in Aero Continente due to reported issues with their engines, and advised caution to US citizens flying in Peru&#x27;s airlines, to the point of providing a hotline and a web portal to help tourists know if a certain airline was considered unsafe.

In late 1999, Aero Continente was granted approval to operate on the prestigious Lima to Miami route. For this purpose, a Boeing 757-200 had been leased from Air 2000. After half a year, the leasing contract was terminated. The Miami route was henceforth offered by Aero Continente Chile from Santiago with a stopover at Lima with a Boeing 767-200 aircraft. By 2001, the combined international network of the Lima and Santiago based companies had grown to include Buenos Aires, Bogotá, La Paz, Caracas, Guayaquil and Santa Cruz de la Sierra.

In 2002, the company suffered a setback when Chilean authorities arrested several staff members of Aero Continente Chile over drug trafficking allegations, which forced the airline to cease all flight operations. As a consequence, the Chilean subsidiary was re-integrated into mainline Aero Continente, which claimed the grounding had been rather motivated by concerns that the company had become too strong a competitor for LAN Airlines, the Chilean flag carrier.

&quot;Aero Continente Dominicana&quot;, a second wholly owned subsidiary based in Santo Domingo, had been founded in late 2001. This short-lived business adventure lasted only roughly one year, operating a limited number of flights from the Dominican Republic to Miami. In 2003, after the Dominican subsidiary had failed, Aero Continente itself opened a small base Santo Domingo Airport, offering VFR flights to the Hispanic population centers in New York City, Los Angeles and Madrid.

In 2004, though, Aero Continente had its approval to operate into the United States withdrawn by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Treasury, as its founder and key person, Fernando Zervallos, had been included in a list of the ten most wanted crime bosses of the illegal drug trade (Specially Designated Nationals). Thus, Aero Continente lost its insurance protection, as Global Aerospace, a partly US-based company that was responsible for this matter, was forced to cease its involvement with the airline. It was also unable to buy spare parts for its mostly US-built fleet. Consequently, all flight operations were ceased on 12 July of that year.

In a comeback effort, the company reacted by changing its ownership structure and adopting the new name &quot;Nuevo Continente&quot;, but could not get rid of the allegations that it was involved in criminal activities. In 2005, Nuevo Continente had its airline licence revoked by the Peruvian authorities, officially due to safety concerns.

== Accidents and incidents ==
*In 1996, the airline became the center of a scandal after it became known that two teenagers rode in the cockpit of a flight from Lima to Tarapoto, after being instructed to do so by the flight attendants due to overbooking. This act was a flagrant violation of international air safety standards.
*On 13 December 2003 at 22:48 local time, the Boeing 737-200 (registered OB-1544-P) operating Aero Continente Flight 341 from Caracas to Lima belly-landed at Jorge Chavez International Airport because the pilots had forgotten about lowering the landing gear since they had to cope with a problem concerning the flaps. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair, but all 94 passengers and six crew on board survived the accident.

<text>Anglicisation or anglicization is a form of cultural assimilation whereby something non-English becomes assimilated into or influenced by the culture of England. It can be sociocultural, in which a non-English or place adopts the English language or culture; institutional, in which institutions are influenced by those of England or the United Kingdom; or linguistic, in which a non-English term or name is altered due to the cultural influence of the English language. It can also refer to the influence of English soft power, which includes media, cuisine, popular culture, technology, business practices, laws and political systems.

Anglicisation first occurred in the British Isles, when Celts under the sovereignty of the king of England underwent a process of anglicisation. The Celtic language decline in England was mostly complete by 1000 AD, but continued in Cornwall and other regions until the 18th century. In Scotland, the decline of Scottish Gaelic began during the reign of Malcolm III of Scotland to the point where by the mid-14th century the Scots language was the dominant national language among the Scottish people. In Wales, however, the Welsh language has continued to be spoken by a large part of the country&#x27;s population due to language revival measures aimed at countering historical anglicisation measures such as the Welsh not.

==History and examples==
=== Europe ===

===Channel Islands===
In the early parts of the 19th century, mostly due to increased immigration from the rest of the British Isles, the town of St Helier in the Channel Islands became a predominantly English-speaking place, though bilingualism was still common. This created a divided linguistic geography, as the people of the countryside continued to use forms of Norman French, and many did not even know English. English became seen in the Channel Islands as &quot;the language of commercial success and moral and intellectual achievement&quot;. The growth of English and the decline of French brought about the adoption of more values and social structures from Victorian era England. Eventually, this led to the Channel Islands&#x27;s culture becoming mostly anglicised, which supplanted the traditional Norman-based culture of the Islands.

From 1912, the educational system of the Channel Islands was delivered solely in English, following the norms of the English educational system. Anglicisation was supported by the British government, and it was suggested that anglicisation would not only encourage loyalty and congeniality between the Channel Islands and Britain, but also provide economic prosperity and improved &quot;general happiness&quot;. During the 19th century, there was concern over the practise of sending young Channel Islanders to France for education, as they might have brought back French culture and viewpoints back to the Islands. The upper class in the Channel Islands supported anglicising the Islands, due to the social and economic benefits it would bring. Anglophiles such as John Le Couteur strove to introduce English culture to Jersey.

===British Isles===

Anglicisation was an essential element in the development of British society and of the development of a unified British polity. Within the British Isles, anglicisation can be defined as influence of English culture in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Until the 19th century, most significant period for anglicisation in those regions was the High Middle Ages. Between 1000 and 1300, the British Isles became increasingly anglicised. Firstly, the ruling classes of England, who were of Norman origin after the Norman Conquest of 1066, became anglicised as their separate Norman identity, different from the identity of the native Anglo-Saxons, became replaced with a single English national identity.

Secondly, English communities in Wales and Ireland emphasised their English identities, which became established through the settlement of various parts of Wales and Ireland between the 11th and 17th centuries under the guidance of successive English kings. In Wales, this primarily occurred during the conquest of Wales by Edward I, which involved English and Flemish settlers being &quot;planted&quot; in various newly established settlements in Welsh territory. English settlers in Ireland mostly resided in the Pale, a small area concentrated around Dublin. However, much of the land the English settled was not intensively used or densely populated. The culture of settling English populations in Wales and Ireland remained heavy influenced by that of England. These communities were also socially and culturally segregated from the native Irish and Welsh, a distinction which was reinforced by government legislation such as the Statutes of Kilkenny.

==== Ireland ====
====Wales====

During the Middle Ages, Wales was gradually conquered by the English. The institutional anglicisation of Wales was finalised with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542, which fully incorporated Wales into the Kingdom of England. This not only institutionally anglicised Wales, but brought about the anglicisation of the Welsh culture and language. Motives for anglicising Wales included securing Protestant England against incursions from Catholic powers in Continental Europe and promoting the power of the Welsh Tudor dynasty in the rest of England.

Scholars have argued that industrialisation prevented Wales from being anglicised to the extent of Ireland and Scotland, as the majority of the Welsh people did not move abroad in search of employment during the early modern era, and thus did not have to learn to speak English. Furthermore, migration patterns created a cultural division of labour, with national migrants tending to work in coalfields or remain in rural villages, while non-national migrants were attracted to coastal towns and cities. This preserved monocultural Welsh communities, ensuring the continued prominence of the Welsh language and customs within them. However, other scholars argue that industrialisation and urbanisation led to economic decline in rural Wales, and given that the country&#x27;s large towns and cities were anglicised, this led to an overall anglicisation of the nation.

The Elementary Education Act 1870 and the Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889 introduced compulsory English-language education into the Welsh educational system. English &quot;was perceived as the language of progress, equality, prosperity, mass entertainment and pleasure&quot;. This and other administrative reforms resulted in the institutional and cultural dominance of English and marginalisation of Welsh, especially in the more urban south and north-east of Wales. In 2022, the Commission for Welsh-speaking Communities warned that the emigration of Anglophones to Welsh-speaking villages and towns was putting the Welsh language at risk.

==== Modern non-British Isles diasporas ====
Jewish refugees in Britain at the turn of the 20th century were encouraged to Anglicise themselves by playing British sports. Such assimilation was desired by both the immigrants and the local Anglo-Jewish elite, as it would preempt antisemitic and xenophobic prejudices.

=== Continental Europe ===

==== Germany ====
Philosophically, England&#x27;s political ideals and strength were inspirational for Prussia in the 19th century. British art has also had a significant influence on Germany.

=== Americas ===

=== Anglo-America ===
==== Canada ====

The term Anglicisation started being used around the time that the question of Anglicising white populations outside of the British Isles first presented itself in the late 18th century, when the British Empire had to decide how to conciliate French Canadians to its rule. Anglicisation was also expected of immigrants, particularly at the time that the country envisioned itself as part of a global British imperial community, until the cultural mosaic model took root in the late 20th century.

==== Caribbean ====
==== United States ====

The United States was the first major British colony to become independent. Early into the American Revolution, the majority of the colonists still felt loyal to Britain and preferred reconciliation over independence. Close cultural relations eased the resumption of post-Revolution ties between the two nations and later aided their cooperation during World War II, giving rise to what became known as the Special Relationship. Both nations&#x27; cultural legacies and rising global stature led them to consider themselves as successors in certain ways to the Roman Empire, and American hegemony was able to peacefully succeed the British Empire&#x27;s dominance in part due to the widely shared heritage.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, there was a nationwide effort in the United States to anglicise all immigrants to the US. This was carried out through methods including (but not limited to) mandating the teaching of American English and having all immigrants change their first names to English-sounding names. This movement was known as Americanization and is considered a subset of Anglicization due to English being the dominant language in the United States.

=== Latin America ===
==== Mexico ====
Cornish miners introduced some of their cuisine in the 19th century. Mexico&#x27;s proximity to the United States has also furthered its uptake of the English language, particularly in the border regions.

=== Africa ===
=== East Africa ===
In Kenya, Christian missionaries played a significant role in advancing British culture. Though initially the colonial education system allowed for a more localised pedagogy, in the aftermath of the Mau Mau rebellion the curriculum was revised to feature a greater emphasis on British culture and positive involvement in the region.

=== Southern Africa ===

==== South Africa ====
Anglicisation came into greater effect after the Anglo-Boer War, when the British decided to inculcate Afrikaner children in the English language and culture, contesting prior Dutch societal influences.

=== West Africa ===
=== Asia ===

=== East Asia ===

==== China ====
=== South Asia ===
==== Bangladesh ====
==== India ====

Two centuries of imperial British influence saw India become the subject of intense discussions around the merit of Westernisation and modernisation on an ancient, unchanging culture. In the decades after India&#x27;s 1947 independence, Anglicisation actually became more apparent in some respects: more people had learned English, which now was more significant in its capacity as a world language, and cricket was greatly popularised. Universal adult suffrage and higher levels of college attendance were also achieved.

=== Southeast Asia ===

==== Singapore ====
Malay was Singapore&#x27;s lingua franca late into the colonial era until English started to predominate; after Singapore became independent from British rule, it decided to keep English as its main language to maximise economic efficiency. Various politicians associated with Singapore&#x27;s founding postcolonial period have measuredly praised British influences that they claim laid the foundation for the city to become more successful.

=== West Asia ===
During the late colonial era, British planners were preoccupied with combating growing anti-Western sentiments among Arabs; the instrumentalisation of the British Council was seen as the best way to create stronger cultural ties.

=== Oceania ===

==== Australia ====

Australians had very significant ties to the United Kingdom until the mid-20th century, with racial and historical ties cited as reasons to keep the relationship strong. The breakup of the British Empire then reoriented Australia towards American influences.

== Language ==

=== Linguistic anglicisation ===
Linguistic anglicisation is the practice of modifying foreign words, names, and phrases to make them easier to spell, pronounce or understand in English. The term commonly refers to the respelling of foreign words, often to a more drastic degree than that implied in, for example, romanisation.

Non-English words may be anglicised by changing their form and/or pronunciation to something more familiar to English speakers. Some foreign place names are commonly anglicised in English. Examples include the Danish city København (Copenhagen), the Russian city of Moskva (Moscow), the Swedish city of Göteborg (Gothenburg), the Dutch city of Den Haag (The Hague), the Spanish city of Sevilla (Seville), the Egyptian city of Al-Qāhira (Cairo), and the Italian city of Firenze (Florence). The Indian city of Kolkata was once anglicised as Calcutta, until the city chose to change its official name back to Kolkata in 2001. Anglicisation of words and names from indigenous languages occurred across the English-speaking world in former parts of the British Empire. Toponyms in particular have been affected by this process.

In the past, the names of people from other language areas were anglicised to a higher extent than today. This was the general rule for names of Latin or (classical) Greek origin. Today, the anglicised name forms are often retained for the more well-known persons, like Aristotle for Aristoteles, and Adrian (or later Hadrian) for Hadrianus. During the time in which there were large influxes of immigrants from Europe to the United States and United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries, the names of many immigrants were never changed by immigration officials but only by personal choice.

=== Dominance of Anglo-/British English ===
Britishisms (terms unique to British English) have entered American English over the centuries and continuing to this day, despite the modern global predominance of American English. Globalisation and the increasing role of British journalists are cited as factors for this in the present day.

=== Englishisation ===
== Sports ==
=== Indirect influence ===
English pastimes and ideas influenced early American sporting practices significantly. For example, Mark Dyreson has argued that American attempts to improve the world through sport took inspiration from British imperial models. The England-originated philosophy of Muscular Christianity also played a role in shaping American attitudes towards sport and its global role by the turn of the 20th century.

<text>LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation (LXI) is a standard which defines the communication protocols for instrumentation and data acquisition systems using Ethernet.

== Overview ==
Proposed in 2005 by Keysight and VTI Instruments, the LXI standard adapts the Ethernet and World Wide Web standards to test and measurement applications. The standard defines how existing standards should be used in instrumentation applications to provide a consistent feel and ensure compatibility between equipment.

The LXI standard does not define a mechanical format. LXI products can be modular, rack mounted, bench mounted or take any other physical form. LXI products may have no front panel or display, or they may include embedded displays and keyboards.

Use of Ethernet allows instrument systems to be spread over large distances. An optional Extended Function based on IEEE 1588 Precision Timing Protocol allows instruments to communicate on a time basis, initiating events at specified times or intervals and time stamping events to indicate when these events occurred.

== Interoperability and IVI ==
LXI devices can coexist with Ethernet devices that are not themselves LXI compliant. They can also be present in test systems which include products based on the GPIB, VXI, and PXI standards.

The standard mandates that every LXI instrument must have an Interchangeable Virtual Instrument (IVI) driver. The IVI Foundation defines a standard driver application programming interface (API) for programmable instruments. IVI driver formats can be IVI-COM for working with COM-based development environments and IVI-C for working in traditional programming languages for use in a .NET Framework.

Most LXI instruments can be programmed with methods other than IVI, so it is not mandatory to work with an IVI driver. Developers can use other driver technologies or work directly with SCPI commands.

== Standardization ==
The LXI Standard has three major elements:
# A standardized LAN interface that provides a framework for web-based interfacing and programmatic control. The LAN interface can include wireless connectivity, as well as physically connected interfaces. The interface supports peer-to-peer operation, as well as master/slave operation. Devices can optionally support IPv6.
# An optional trigger facility based on the IEEE 1588 Precision Timing Protocol that enables modules to have a sense of time, which allows modules to time stamp actions and initiate triggered events over the LAN interface.
# An optional physical wired trigger system based on a Multipoint Low-Voltage Differential Signaling (M-LVDS) electrical interface that tightly synchronizes the operation of multiple LXI instruments.

The specification is organized into a set of documents which describe:
* The LXI Device Core Specification which contains the requirements for the LAN interface which all LXI Devices must adhere to
* A set of optional Extended Functions which LXI devices can adhere to. If a device claims conformance it must have been tested under the LXI Consortium Conformance regime. As of March 2016, there are 7 Extended Functions specified
** HiSLIP
** IPv6
** LXI Wired Trigger Bus
** LXI Event Messaging
** LXI Clock Synchronization (based on IEEE1588)
** LXI Time Stamped Data
** LXI Event Log

== Specification History ==
In 2005, the LXI Consortium released Version 1.0 of the LXI Standard. Version 1.1 followed with minor corrections and clarifications. In 2007, the Consortium adopted Version 1.2; its major focus was discovery mechanisms. Specifically, LXI 1.2 included enhancements to support mDNS discovery of LXI devices. Version 1.3 incorporates the 2008 version of IEEE 1588 for synchronizing time among instruments. As of November 2016, the standard is at Revision 1.5.

== Conformance testing ==
The LXI Consortium requires LXI Devices to go through standard testing.

To support this compliance regime an LXI Test Suite is available. After a vendor joins the LXI Consortium they can gain access to the Consortium&#x27;s Conformance Test Suite software, which they can use as a pre-test before submitting the product to the Consortium for compliance testing. Once a product is ready to submit, a vendor can choose to have their product tested at a PlugFest or an approved test house. A Technical Justification route allows vendors to certify compliance of derivative products by submitting test results to the Consortium to show that the device has been tested on the LXI Test Suite. The consortium provides guidance on when the Technical Justification route can be used and when a new formal test is required.

<text>Gupta () is a common surname of Indian origin, meaning &quot;guardian&quot; or &quot;protector&quot;.

==Origins and distribution==
The name is based on the Sanskrit word &quot;goptṛ&quot;, which means &quot;guardian&quot; or &quot;protector&quot;. 

According to historian R. C. Majumdar, the surname &quot;Gupta&quot; was adopted by several different communities in northern and eastern India at different times. 

The Rāmpāl plate of the Chandra dynasty ruler Srichandra mentions a line of Brahmins who had Gupta as their surname. In Bengal region, the surname is found among Baidyas (mainly) as well as Kayasthas.

According to Tej Ram Sharma, the name &quot;Sri Gupta&quot;, &quot;Sri&quot; serves as an honorific title, similar to its usage for other Gupta emperors mentioned in inscriptions. If the first ruler&#x27;s name had indeed been &quot;Sri Gupta&quot;, it would likely have been recorded as &quot;Sri Sri Gupta&quot;, as seen in the Deo-Barnark inscription of Jivitagupta II, where the name &quot;Srimati&quot; appears in a similar format. Therefore, if &quot;Gupta&quot; is accepted as the personal name of the dynasty&#x27;s founder, it would indicate that the Gupta suffix did not function as a surname during that period.

The Gupta surname is also used by Banias and Jains in the northern part of India.

<text>English folklore consists of the myths and legends of England, including the region&#x27;s mythical creatures, traditional recipes, urban legends, proverbs, superstitions, dance, balladry, and folktales that have been passed down through generations, reflecting the cultural heritage of the country. This body of folklore includes a diverse array of characters, such as heroic figures like Beowulf or Robin Hood, legendary kings like Arthur, and mythical creatures like the Green Man and Black Shuck. These tales and traditions have been shaped by the historical experiences of the English people, influenced by the various cultures that have settled in England over centuries, including Celtic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Norse, and Norman elements.

The stories within English folklore often convey themes of justice, loyalty, bravery, and the supernatural, and often contain a moral imperative stemming from Christian values. They frequently explore the relationship between humans and the natural world, as seen in the legends of the Green Man or Herne the Hunter, or the consequences of human actions, as illustrated in tales like the Lambton Worm.

Additionally, English folklore has been influenced by historical events, such as the witch trials of the early modern period, which are reflected in stories like that of the Pendle witches. During the Renaissance in the 16th century, England looked to more European texts to develop a national identity. English folklore has continued to differ according to region, although there are shared elements across the country. The folktales, characters and creatures are often derived from aspects of English experience, such as topography, architecture, real people, or real events.

English folklore has had a lasting impact on English culture, literature, and identity. Many of these traditional stories have been retold in various forms, from medieval manuscripts to modern films and literature. To this day, traditional folk festivals such as May Day, Plough Monday, Bonfire Night, Allhallowtide, and Harvest festival continue to be practised. Morris dancing, Mummers&#x27; plays, and Maypole dancing remain popular forms of folk traditions, often depicting or echoing themes or stories from English folklore.

== History ==

Before England was founded in the year 927, Wessex and its surrounding areas&#x27; cultures were transformed by the invasion of the Danish King Guthrum between 865 and 878. The king of Wessex, King Alfred, prevailed against King Guthrum&#x27;s troops in 878 and King Guthrum was baptised and became the ruler of East Anglia. This continued the process of the assimilation of Norse words into the English language. Eventually English folklore melded with Norse traditions such as in their iconography, which became more Greek, and in their clothing and folktales which adopted more Nordic elements. The folklore of the people of England continued to be passed down through oral tradition.

During the Renaissance, artists captured these customs in the written word; such as Shakespearean plays&#x27; reflections of English folklore through their witches, fairies, folk medicine, marriage and funeral customs, superstitions, and religious beliefs.

The Grimm brothers&#x27; publications such as &quot;German Legends&quot; and &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot; were translated from their original German and distributed across Europe in 1816. Their stories inspired publishers such as William Thoms to compile legends from within English folklore and without to compose an English identity. The stories that the Grimm brothers collected were integrated into the English school curriculum throughout the 19th century as educators of morality.

== Characteristics ==
Although English folklore has many influences, its largest are Christian, Celtic and Germanic. Non-Christian influences also defined English folklore up to the eleventh century, such as in their folksongs, celebrations and folktales. An example is the 305 ballads collected by Francis James Child published during the English revival in the 19th century. During the English folksong revival, English artists scrambled to compose a national identity consisting of England&#x27;s past folksongs and their contemporary musical influences. Authors such as Francis James Child, Arthur Hugh Clough, and Chaucer made English folksong supranational due to the willingness to import other languages&#x27; words, pronunciations, and metres. Other examples of non-Christian influences include the Wild Hunt which originates from wider Europe, and Herne the Hunter which relates to the Germanic deity Woden. The Abbots Bromley Horn Dance may represent a pre-Christian festival and the practice of Well dressing in the Peak District, which may date back to Anglo-Saxon or even Celtic times. May Day celebrations such as the Maypole survive across much of England and Northern Europe. Christmas practices such as decorating trees, the significance of holly, and Christmas carolling were born from the desire to escape from the harshness of winter around Europe.

These combine to form a folklore which teaches that, through an upright and virtuous character, a person can achieve a successful life. Lullabies, songs, dances, games, folktales, and superstitions all imparted a religious and moral education, and form a person&#x27;s sense of justice and Christianity. Children&#x27;s games would often contain counting songs or gamifications of manners to ensure that a child was happy, healthy, and good.English folklore also included beliefs of the supernatural, including premonitions, curses, and magic, and was common across all social classes. It was not regarded with the same validity as scientific discoveries, but was made to be trusted by the repeated accounts of a magician or priest&#x27;s clients who saw the ritual&#x27;s spectacle and so believed in its efficacy. Even when such rituals failed, such as a 15th-century physician using a golden artifact to heal his patients, their failures were attributed to the fickleness of magic.

As for English folktales, some such as Weber argue that they were passed down for the purpose of reflecting the grim realities of a child&#x27;s life and hence instilled valued English morals and aesthetics. Others such as Tatar would counter that these folktales&#x27; fantasies were so removed from reality that they were a form of escapism, imaginative expression, and linguistic appreciation. Most folklorists would agree that the purpose of English folklore is to protect, entertain, and instruct on how to participate in a just and fair society.

== Folktales ==
Folklorists have developed frameworks such as the Aarne–Thompson-Uther index which categorise folktales first by types of folktales and then by consistent motifs. While these stories and characters have differences according to the region of their origin, these motifs are such that there is a national identity of folktales through which these regions have interacted.

There are likely many characters and stories that have never been recorded and hence were forgotten, but these folktales and their evolutions were often a product of contemporary figures, places, or events local to specific regions. The below are only a small fraction of examples from the folktale types of English folklore.

=== Creatures ===
Dragons are giant winged reptiles that breathe fire, poison and acid. They are usually associated with treasure rooms, waterfalls, and hollowed out tree stumps.

A Wyvern is a smaller relative of dragons with two legs rather than four. It also has smaller wings and cannot breathe fire.

The black dog is a creature which foreshadows calamity or causes it. It is a combination of Odysseus&#x27; Argos and Hades&#x27; Cerberus from Greek mythology, and Fenrir from Norse mythology. The first collection of sightings of the black dog around Great Britain, Ethel Rudkin&#x27;s 1938 article reports that the dog has black fur, abnormally large eyes, and a huge body. The black dog is a common motif in folklore and appears in many traditional English stories and tales. They often denote death and misfortune close at hand and appear and disappear into thin air.

A boggart is, depending on local or regional tradition, a malevolent &quot;genius loci&quot; inhabiting fields, marshes or other topographical features. The household boggart causes objects to disappear, milk to sour, and dogs to go lame. They can possess small animals, fields, churches, or houses so they can play tricks on the civilians with their chilling laugh. Always malevolent, the boggart will follow its family wherever they flee. In Northern England, at least, there was the belief that the boggart should never be named, for when the boggart was given a name, it could not be reasoned with nor persuaded, but would become uncontrollable and destructive.

A brownie is a type of hob (household spirit), similar to a hobgoblin. Brownies are said to inhabit houses and aid in tasks around the house. However, they do not like to be seen and will only work at night, traditionally in exchange for small gifts or food. Among food, they especially enjoy porridge and honey. They usually abandon the house if their gifts are called payments, or if the owners of the house misuse them. Brownies make their homes in an unused part of the house.

A dwarf is a human-shaped entity that dwells in mountains and in the earth, and is associated with wisdom, smithing, mining, and crafting. The term had only started to be used in the 19th century as a translation for the German, French, and Scandinavian words which describe dwarfs.

Ogres are usually tall, strong, violent, greedy, and remarkably dull monsters and they originate from French culture. In folktales they are likely to be defeated by being outsmarted.

The Will-o&#x27;-the-wisp is a folk explanation of strange, flickering lights seen around marshes and bogs. Some perceive them as souls of unbaptized infants which lead travellers off the forest path and into danger, while others perceive them as trickster fairies or sprites.

=== Characters and personifications ===

King Arthur is the legendary king of the Britons, the Once and Future King and True Born King of England. The origins of King Arthur and his exploits are vague due to the many reproductions of his character. The and the reference many battles of an Arthur, also referencing Mordred, a rival, and Merlin, a wise mentor. Although these sources have been used as proof for Arthur&#x27;s origins, their credibility has been disputed as mythology rather than history. As English folklore has progressed, King Arthur&#x27;s retellings have been classified into romances such as Malory&#x27;s , chronicles such as Geoffrey&#x27;s , and fantasies such as (whose author is unknown).

Robin Hood was a vicious outlaw who expressed the working-class&#x27; disenchantment with the status quo. Through Robin Hood, the forest (called the &quot;greenwood&quot; by folklorists) transformed from the dangerous, mystical battleground of Arthur to a site of sanctuary, comradery, and lawlessness. Rather than a philanthropic thief of the rich, Robin Hood&#x27;s tales began in the 15th century as a brutal outlaw, ballads revelling in his violent retaliation to threats. Robin Hood fought to protect himself and his group the Merry Men, regardless the class, age, or gender of their enemy. In stories such as &#x27;Robin Hood and the Widow&#x27;s Three Sons&#x27; and &#x27;The Tale of Gamelyn&#x27;, the joyful ending is in the hanging of the sheriff and the officials; in &#x27;Robin Hood and the Monk&quot;&#x27;,&quot; Robin Hood kills a monk and his young helper. Paradoxical to English values of strict adherence to the law and honour, Robin Hood was glorified in ballads and stories for his banishment from society.

Robin Goodfellow, or Puck, is a shape-changing fairy known for his tricks. Since some English superstition suspected that fairies were demons, 17th century publications such as &#x27;Robin Good-Fellow, his Mad Prankes and Merry Jests&#x27; and &#x27;The Anatomy of Melancholy&#x27; portrayed him as a demon.

Lob, also called loby, looby, lubbard, lubber, or lubberkin, is the name given to a fairy with a dark raincloud as a body. It has a mischievous character and can describe any fairy-like creature from British folklore. It can be confused with Lob Lie-By-The-Fire, a strong, hairy giant which helps humans.

=== Stories ===

Beowulf is an anonymous Old English historical epic of 3182 lines which describes the adventures of its titular character, prince Beowulf of Geats. The story goes that Beowulf slays Grendel, a monster who has tormented the hall of Hrothgar King of the Danes for twelve years. Grendel&#x27;s mother seeks to gain revenge and Beowulf slays her also, after which Beowulf becomes king of the Danes himself. After 50 years, Beowulf&#x27;s people are tormented by a dragon and Beowulf dies while slaying her. Original speculation was that Beowulf was a Scandinavian epic translated to English, theorised due to the story&#x27;s Scandinavian settings. However, Beowulf was cemented as an Old English epic through the study that heroes of folklore are not ordinarily natives of the country they save.

The Brown Lady of Raynham is a story of the ghost of a woman of Norfolk, Lady Dorothy Walpole. After her adultery was discovered, she was confined to her chambers until death and roamed the halls of Raynham, named after the brown brocade she wears. Differing versions of the story attest that she was locked in by her husband, Lord Townsend, or by the Countess of Wharton.

The Legend of the Mistletoe Bough is a ghost story which has been associated with many mansions and stately homes in England. The tale describes how a new bride, playing a game of hide-and-seek during her wedding breakfast, hid in a chest in an attic and was unable to escape. She was not discovered by her family and friends, and suffocated. The body was allegedly found many years later in the locked chest.

=== Beliefs and motifs ===
Standing stones are man-made stone structures made to stand up. Some small standing stones can also be arranged in groups to form miniliths. Similar to these geological artefacts are hill figures. These are figures drawn into the countryside by digging into the ground and sometimes filling it in with a mineral of a contrasting colour. Examples are the Cerne Abbas Giant, the Uffington White Horse, and the Long Man of Wilmington and are the focus for folktales and beliefs.

The Green Man is a description originating in 1939 which describes the engraved sculpture of a face with leaves growing from it in English architecture. His presence symbolises nature, but he is depicted differently according to where he is engraved and who carves him; on a church he may symbolise either inspiration or lust, or he may symbolise an ancient protector of travellers in a forest. The phrase originated from &#x27;whifflers&#x27; who dressed in leaves or hair to make way for processions during pageants from the 15th to 18th centuries.

There was a belief that those born at the chime hours could see ghosts. The time differed according to region, usually based around the times of monk&#x27;s prayer which were sometimes marked by a chime.

Crop circles are formations of flattened cereal. While they have been speculated to have mysterious and often extraterrestrial origins, most crop circles have been proven to be hoaxes. Those made by Doug Bower and Dave Chorley across England in 1991 have since started chains of copycats around the world.

Cunning folk was a term used to refer to male and female healers, magicians, conjurers, fortune-tellers, potion-makers, exorcists, or thieves. Such people were respected, feared and sometimes hunted for their breadth of knowledge which was suspected as supernatural.

The wild hunt was a description of a menacing group of huntsmen which either rode across the sky or on lonely roads. Their presence was a hallmark of the perception of the countryside as a wild and mystical place.

=== Practices ===

On May Day, the first day of May, a tall, decorated pole is put up as a symbol of fertility called a maypole. The maypole may represents a phallic object impregnating the earth at the end of spring to ensure a bountiful summer, but this association is very late. The maypoles were decorated originally with flowers and carved from the branches of trees about to bloom to symbolise the birth of new life. Eventually the flowers were replaced with ribbons and May day became a day for celebration and dancing in which a May queen and sometimes a May king would be crowned to also symbolise fertility.

A parish ale is a type of party in the parish usually held to fundraise money for a particular purpose.

Plough Monday was a custom in which, on the first Monday after Christmas, men visited people&#x27;s doorsteps at night and asked for a token for the holiday. They carried whips and a makeshift plough and dug up the house&#x27;s doorstep or scraper if the house refused to give them an item.

Corn dollies are a form of straw work made as part of harvest customs of Europe before the First World War. Their use varied according to region: it may have been decorative, an image of pride for the harvest, or a way to mock nearby farms which had not yet collected their harvest. There has been a recent resurgence in their creation led by Minnie Lambeth in the 1950s and 1960s through her book &quot;A Golden Dolly: The Art, Mystery, and History of Corn Dollies&quot;.

A superstition among children was that, if the first word uttered in the month was &quot;Rabbit!&quot;, then that person would have good luck for the rest of the month. Variants include: &quot;rabbit, rabbit, rabbit!&quot;, &quot;rabbit, rabbit, white rabbit!&quot;, and &quot;white rabbit!&quot;.

After a person died, a poor person was hired to take on their sins by eating before or after the funeral over their body- a sin-eater. The sin-eater would hence ensure that the recently deceased would be taken to heaven.

=== Items ===
Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s Drum is a legend about the drum of an English admiral who raided Spanish treasure fleets and Spanish ports. He was believed to have white magic which enabled him to turn into a dragon (as hinted by his name, Drake meaning dragon in Latin). When he died, the drum which he brought on his voyage around the world was sung about- that in England&#x27;s peril, they could strike it and he would come to their aid. Eventually the legend evolved to be that the drum would strike itself in England&#x27;s peril, and it has been heard struck since.

A hagstone, also called a holed stone or adder stone, is a type of stone, usually glassy, with a naturally occurring hole through it. Such stones have been discovered by archaeologists in both Britain and Egypt. In England it was used as a counter-charm for sleep paralysis, called hag-riding by tradition.

A petrifying well is a well which, when items are placed into it, they appear to be covered in stone. Items also acquire a stony texture when left in the well for an extended period of time. Examples in England include Mother Shipton&#x27;s Cave in Knaresborough and Matlock Bath in Derbyshire.

<doc id="419841" wikidata="Q7663776" url="?curid=419841" title="Systematic ideology">
<text>Systematic ideology is a study of ideologies founded in the late 1930s in and around London, England by Harold Walsby, George Walford and others. It seeks to understand the origin and development of ideologies, how ideologies and ideological groups work together and the possibilities of guiding the development of ideologies on a global scale. The basic premise of systematic ideology is that ideology is the central motivator in human affairs; that the characteristics that make up the major ideologies come in sets; that those sets of characteristics form a series; and that the ideological series forms a system.

== History ==

The group that formed around Harold Walsby and his ideas was a breakaway from the Socialist Party of Great Britain /SPGB). During the Second World War, this group developed a fascination with perceived impediments to mass socialist consciousness among the working class. The theory they developed was expressed by Walsby himself in his 1947 book &quot;The Domain of Ideologies&quot; and those involved in the group set up an organisation to propagate their views called the Social Science Association (SSA) which existed from 1944 until 1956, attracting a number of new recruits during the Turner Controversy. It was later succeeded by the Walsby Society and the journal which emerged from it called &quot;Ideological Commentary&quot;.

From the 1980s onwards, George Walford, editor of &quot;Ideological Commentary&quot; and former secretary of the SSA, watered down some of the theory&#x27;s more obviously elitist elements and even left the SPGB money at the time of his death. He did this on the grounds that although in his view the party would never help achieve socialism, it did perform a valuable function by demonstrating through its application of critical analysis, logical thought and theory the limitations of other political groups that valued these less highly (a perspective which had informed Harold Walsby&#x27;s decision in 1950 to surreptitiously rejoin the party through its postal branch and write articles for the &quot;Socialist Standard&quot; under the pseudonym H. W. S. Bee).

&quot;Ideological Commentary&quot; survived until the death of Walford in 1994. , barely a handful of systematic ideology&#x27;s exponents remain.

Walsby, Walford and their group produced a large number of leaflets, pamphlets and other literature over time, a fair chunk of it dealing with the SPGB. The most readable expressions of systematic ideology are Walford&#x27;s book &quot;Beyond Politics&quot;, published in 1990; and the pamphlet &quot;Socialist Understanding&quot;, published ten years earlier.

== Theory ==
The theory of the group developed over time and was re-christened systematic ideology by Walford in 1976. Its basic premise was that people&#x27;s assumptions and identifications (the factors making up their ideology) are not explicable in terms of material conditions in general and their relationship to the means of production in particular—and are never likely to be. Instead, there are persistent and distinct ideological groups in society, cutting across social classes and forming a series, with the largest groups being most typically guided in their thoughts and actions by a preference for family, authority, familiarity and tradition. Politically, these preferences find predominant expression in the ideas of the large number of so-called non-politicals in society and in conservatism and then liberalism (the strength of these preferences gradually weakening through the series).

As the series progresses further, the next, progressively smaller, ideological groups seek to repress these identifications and preferences in favor of dynamism, social change, logical thought and the pursuit of theory as a guide to decision-making, these being expressed politically in labourism, more overtly still in communism and then in an ultimate and extreme form in anarchism (or anarcho-socialism, the purist variety of it allegedly expounded by the SPGB). The more an ideology represses the preferences for family, tradition and so on in favour of social change, dynamism and the pursuit of theory as a guide to action, the fewer in number its adherents are likely to be, with anarchists (or anarcho-socialists) being the smallest of all. Those seeking radical social change, so the theory contends, will always be hampered and restrained by the enduring preferences of the largest ideological groups.

=== George Walford ===
In his book &quot;Beyond Politics&quot;, George Walford seeks to analyse ideologies on the basis of its adherents&#x27; surface behaviors, their underlying sentiments and assumptions (&quot;ethos&quot;) and underlying cognitions (&quot;eidos&quot;). Of particular interest to him are a single group, the non-politicals; and five major political ideologies (conservatism, liberalism, socialism, communism and anarchism) which can be listed as a series, with each seeking to repress its predecessor. He forms a series of hypotheses about the nature of those six ideologies, observing that they may be gauged upon different dimensions. According to relative size and political influence of its adherents, their relative reliance upon theory over practice and the degree to which they sought change. He postulates that the non-politicals have the greatest influence and least interest in theory while anarchists exhibit the least influence and greatest interest in theory, with the rest having mixed degrees of those properties.

He also formulates that each is relative to certain ideological ethos: a) (short-term) expediency; b) (traditional) principles; c) precision; d) (fundamental) reform; e) revolution; and e) repudiation. By his formulations, historical change, development of technology and development of more complicated social relations can be explained as occurring in stages along this series:

# For Walford, all societies historically begin in a state where a mass of individuals engage in expediency at the hunter-gatherer level. This state of affairs is characterized by short-term individual economic behavior and collective political action.
# Societies grow to have more advanced and secure political systems at the same time that they make better use of agricultural technology with more long-term goals in mind. In the process, economic behavior becomes more and more collectivistic. From then on, the societies engage in wars and conquer. Empires grow and create obedience with the mask of traditional principles.
# Finally, societies enter a stage where principles espoused actually begin to be followed, enacted, and made more precise. Similarly, economic production becomes more bureaucratic and rationally goal-oriented.
# The remaining three forms of ethos—reform, revolution, and repudiation—when taken together are seen to compose the envisioned fourth stage in historical development.

While some other philosophers have expressed the opinion that political liberalism is the peak or end-stage of historical development (see Francis Fukuyama&#x27;s &quot;End of History&quot; thesis), Walford claims the opposite, saying: &quot;More than ever before, our world is a boiling, bounding, bubbling ferment of ideological novelty, and the rate of change is accelerating. If the ideological system has reached completion it is only in the sense that a newborn child is complete&quot;.

== Criticism ==
Historically, systematic ideology has been unable to produce a falsifiable and causal model for what it is that influences some people and not others to gravitate towards a particular ideology.

Walsby&#x27;s early version of the theory was clearly hierarchical (with those understanding the theory being the smallest group of all, metaphorically positioned at the apex of a pyramid, just above the SPGB) and it lent itself to criticism on the grounds that it was merely a particularly convoluted type of human nature argument. This was essentially the response outlined in the &quot;Socialist Standard&quot;’s April 1949 review of Walsby&#x27;s book called &quot;The Domain of Sterilities&quot;.

Twin studies have shown that genetics have a strong effect on both attitude formation, and receptivity to ideological affiliation. This may provide some answer to the criticism that systematic ideology lacks a causal model. According to one study:
:We found that political attitudes are influenced much more heavily by genetics than by parental socialization. For the overall index of political conservatism, genetics accounts for approximately half the variance in ideology while shared environment (including parental socialization) accounts for only 11 percent.

<text>Moral character or character (derived from ) is an analysis of an individual&#x27;s steady moral qualities. The concept of &quot;character&quot; can express a variety of attributes, including the presence or lack of virtues such as empathy, courage, fortitude, honesty, and loyalty, or of good behaviors or habits; these attributes are also a part of one&#x27;s soft skills.

Moral character refers to a collection of qualities that differentiate one individual from anotheralthough on a cultural level, the group of moral behaviors to which a social group adheres can be said to unite and define it culturally as distinct from others.

Psychologist Lawrence Pervin defines moral character as &quot;a disposition to express behavior in consistent patterns of functions across a range of situations&quot;. The philosopher Marie I. George refers to moral character as the &quot;sum of one’s moral habits and dispositions&quot;. Aristotle said, &quot;we must take as a sign of states of character the pleasure or pain that ensues on acts.&quot;

==Overview==
The word &quot;character&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek word &quot;&quot;, referring to a mark impressed upon a coin. Later it came to mean a point by which one thing was told apart from others. There are two approaches when dealing with moral character: Normative ethics involve moral standards that exhibit right and wrong conduct. It is a test of proper behavior and determining what is right and wrong. Applied ethics involve specific and controversial issues along with a moral choice, and tend to involve situations where people are either for or against the issue.

In 1982 Campbell &amp; Bond proposed the following as major sources in influencing character and moral development: heredity, early childhood experience, modeling by important adults and older youth, peer influence, the general physical and social environment, the communications media, the teachings of schools and other institutions, and specific situations and roles that elicit corresponding behavior.

In the military field, character is considered particularly relevant in the leadership development area. Military leaders should not only &quot;know&quot; theoretically the moral values but they must embody these values. Military leaders are expected to lead by example. They demonstrate values and behaviors that they expect their subordinates to follow. Military leaders face ethical and morally challenging issues. Strong moral character is crucial for making these decisions, especially when the consequences of these decisions affect the lives of those under their command.

==History==

The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; provides a historical account of some important developments in philosophical approaches to moral character. A lot of attention is given to Plato, Aristotle, and Karl Marx&#x27;s views, since they all follow the idea of moral character after the Greeks. Marx accepts Aristotle&#x27;s insight that virtue and good character are based on a sense of self-esteem and self-confidence.

Plato believed that the soul is divided into three parts of desire: Rational, Appetitive, and Spirited. In order to have moral character, we must understand what contributes to our overall good and have our spirited and appetitive desires educated properly, so that they can agree with the guidance provided by the rational part of the soul. According to Plato, Moral Character is directly linked to and understanding contributions to the overall good. Associating reason and wisdom allows for individuals to discern the true nature of what is good.

Aristotle tells us that there are people who exhibit excellences – excellences of thought and excellences of character. His phrase for excellences of character – – we usually translate as moral virtue or moral excellence. When we speak of a moral virtue or an excellence of character, the emphasis is on the combination of qualities that make an individual the sort of ethically admirable person that he is. Aristotle defines virtuous character in Book II of the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;: &quot;Excellence of character, then, is a state concerned with choice, lying in a mean relative to us, this being determined by reason and in the way in which the man of practical wisdom would determine it. Now it is a mean between two vices, that which depends on and that which depends on &quot;. In Aristotle&#x27;s view, good character is based on two naturally occurring psychological responses that most people experience without difficulty: our tendency to take pleasure from self-realizing activity and our tendency to form friendly feelings toward others under specific circumstances. Based on his view, virtually everyone is capable of becoming better and is responsible for actions that express (or could express) their character.

Abraham Lincoln once said that character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow. &quot;The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing.&quot;

In 1919, Albert Einstein wrote in a letter to his friend, Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz, about his disillusionment concerning the inhumane consequences of World War I. He noted “We must remember that, on the average, men’s moral qualities do not greatly vary from country to country”.

==Religious views==

Christian character is also defined as presenting the &quot;Fruit of the Holy Spirit&quot;: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Doctrines of grace and total depravity assert that – due to original sin – mankind, entirely or in part, was unable to be good without God&#x27;s intervention; otherwise at best, one could only ape good behavior for selfish reasons.

The Islamic religion is highly concerned with moral character which is presented in many of their teachings. There are strong beliefs that society as a whole has the potential to grow in the values of virtue. Certain writing states that all Muslims have the obligation to bring truth to light as well as to prevent evil. The ideology that to be a morally correct individual, there must be a belief in God is represented in many teachings.

Religion and morality are interconnected; however, are not synonymous. While religion depends on morality, the relationship between the two can vary across cultures, systematic beliefs, and individuals. There are many religions such as Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism that provide their followers with moral guidelines, emphasizing those found within their sacred texts. However it is important to realize that individual beliefs can vary from religious beliefs, contributing to the complexity of moral character.

==Scientific experiments==
There have been a number of experiments to try to empirically examine moral character.

In one experiment that was done in the United States in 1985, a moral decision made by people was influenced by whether or not they had found a dime in a public phone booth. The findings were that 87% of subjects who found a dime in a phone booth mailed a sealed and addressed envelope that was left at the booth in an apparent mistake by someone else, while only 4% of those who did not find a dime helped. This suggested that transient chance factors may matter more than fixed moral character in someone&#x27;s choice whether to help others. John M. Doris raises the issue of ecological validity – do experimental findings reflect phenomena found in natural contexts. He recognizes that these results are counterintuitive to the way most of us think about morally relevant behavior.

Another experiment asked college students at Cornell University to predict how they would behave when faced with one of several moral dilemmas, and to make the same predictions for their peers. Again and again, people predicted that they would be more generous and kind than others. Yet when put into the moral dilemma, the subjects did not behave as generously or as kindly as they had predicted. In psychological terms, the experimental subjects were successfully anticipating the base rate of moral behavior and accurately predicting how often others, in general, would be self-sacrificing.

A study conducted by Philip Zimbardo in the 1970&#x27;s titled &#x27;The Stanford Prison Experiment&#x27; can be used to shed light on the workings of moral character related to roles of power. College students were randomly assigned roles of either a powerless prisoner or a guard in a position of authority. From there participants were told to be completely immersed in their assigned roles. Guard were given few regulations and were allowed to create many of their own rules. The experiment was cut short due to signs of abuse from the guards as well as psychological distress from the prisoners. The study showed how roles of power can tie detrimental behavior to every day individuals thus affecting their moral character.

<text>Swimfins, swim fins, diving fins, or flippers are finlike accessories worn on the feet, legs or hands and made from rubber, plastic, carbon fiber or combinations of these materials, to aid movement through the water in water sports activities such as swimming, bodyboarding, bodysurfing, float-tube fishing, kneeboarding, riverboarding, scuba diving, snorkeling, spearfishing, underwater hockey, underwater rugby and various other types of underwater diving.

Swimfins help the wearer to move through water more efficiently, as human feet are too small and inappropriately shaped to provide much thrust, especially when the wearer is carrying equipment that increases hydrodynamic drag. Very long fins and monofins used by freedivers as a means of underwater propulsion do not require high-frequency leg movement. This improves efficiency and helps to minimize oxygen consumption. Short, stiff-bladed fins are effective for short bursts of acceleration and maneuvering, and are useful for bodysurfing.

==History==
Early inventors, including Leonardo da Vinci and Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, toyed with the concept of swimfins, taking their inspiration from ducks&#x27; feet. Benjamin Franklin made a pair of early swimfins (for hands) when he was a young boy living in Boston, Massachusetts near the Charles River; they were two thin pieces of wood, about the shape of an artist&#x27;s palette, which allowed him to move faster than he usually did in the water.
Modern swimfins are an invention by the Frenchman Louis de Corlieu, &quot;capitaine de corvette&quot; (Lieutenant Commander) in the French Navy. In 1914 Corlieu made a practical demonstration of his first prototype for a group of navy officers, Yves le Prieur among them who, years later in 1926, invented an early model of scuba set. Corlieu left the French Navy in 1924 to fully devote himself to his invention. In April 1933 he registered a patent (number 767013, which in addition to two fins for the feet included two spoon-shaped fins for the hands) and called this equipment &quot;propulseurs de natation et de sauvetage&quot; (which can be translated literally as &quot;swimming and rescue propulsion device&quot;).
After struggling for years, even producing his fins in his own flat in Paris, Louis de Corlieu finally started mass production of his invention in France in 1939. The same year he issued a licence to Owen Churchill for mass production in the United States. To sell his fins in the U.S., Owen Churchill changed the French Corlieu&#x27;s name (&quot;propulseurs&quot;) to &quot;swimfins&quot;, which is still the common English name. Churchill presented his fins to the US Navy, which decided to acquire them for its Underwater Demolition Team (UDT). American UDT and British COPP frogmen (COPP: Combined Operations Pilotage Parties) used the &quot;Churchill fins&quot; during all prior underwater deminings, thus enabling in 1944 the Normandy landings. During the years after World War II had ended, De Corlieu spent time and efforts struggling in civil procedures, suing others for patent infringement.

In Britain, Dunlop made frogman&#x27;s fins for World War II, but after the war saw no market for them in peacetime, and, after the first supply of war-surplus frogman&#x27;s kit was used up, the British public had no access to swimfins (except for home-made attempts such as gluing marine plywood to plimsolls), until Oscar Gugen began importing swimfins and swimming goggles from France.

In 1946 Lillywhites imported about 1,100 pairs of swimfins; they all sold in under 3 months.

In 1948 Luigi Ferraro, collaborating with the Italian diving equipment company Cressi-sub, designed the first full-foot fin, the Rondine, named after the Italian word for swallow. A distinctive feature of Cressi&#x27;s continuing Rondine full-foot fin line is the embossed outline of the bird on the foot pockets and the blades.

After The Amphibians Club, the UK&#x27;s first post-war sport diving club, was founded by Ivor Howitt and friends in 1948 in Aberdeenshire, &quot;swim fins were made by wiring stiff rubber piping each side of a flap of inner tube rubber. Very uncomfortable, but they worked. As secretary of The Amphibians, (Howitt) wrote to the Dunlop Rubber Company in February 1949, as they had made the naval frogmen&#x27;s fins during the war. Incredibly, they replied that they could see no commercial market for swim fins in peacetime. This response reflected the virtual non-existence of sport diving in the UK at that time.&quot;

Seven military, national and international standards relating to swimfins are known to exist: US military standard MIL-S-82258:1965; USSR and CIS standard GOST 22469—77 (Active); German standard DIN 7876:1980; Polish Industry Standard BN-82/8444-17.02. (Active). Austrian standard ÖNORM S 4224:1988; Malaysian standards MS 974:1985; MS 974:2002 (Active); and European standard EN 16804:2015 (Active).

== Types ==

Types of fins have evolved to address the requirements of each community using them. Recreational snorkellers generally use lightweight flexible fins. Free divers favour extremely long fins for efficiency of energy use. Scuba divers need large wide fins to overcome the water resistance caused by their diving equipment, and short enough to allow acceptable maneuvering. Ocean swimmers, bodysurfers, and lifeguards favour smaller designs that stay on their feet when moving through large surf and that make walking on the beach less awkward. Participants in the sports of underwater hockey or underwater rugby use either full-foot or open-heel fins, and the chosen fin style is usually a compromise in performance between straight-line power and turning flexibility - carbon fibre blades are popular at higher levels of competition, but the over-riding requirement is that the fins must not have sharp or unprotected edges or points, nor buckles, which could injure other competitors. Structurally, a swimfin comprises a blade for propulsion and a means of attaching the blade to the wearer&#x27;s foot.

===Fins vs monofins===
The vast majority of fins come as a pair, one fin is worn on each foot. This arrangement is also called bifins, to distinguish it from monofins. A monofin is typically used in finswimming and free-diving and it consists of a single fin blade attached to twin foot pockets for both the diver&#x27;s feet. Monofins and long bifin blades can be made of glass fibre or carbon fibre composites. The diver&#x27;s muscle power and swimming style, and the type of activity the fins are used for, determine the choice of size, stiffness, and materials.

===Full-foot vs open-heel===
Full-foot or closed-heel fins fit like a shoe and are designed to be worn over bare feet or soft neoprene socks; they are sometimes called &quot;slipper&quot; fins. Most fins with complete foot coverage have toe openings for comfort and for ease of water drainage inside the foot pocket. If a larger size is chosen, however, full-foot fins can also be worn over thicker neoprene socks or thin-soled booties. They are commonly used for surface swimming, and come in non-adjustable sizes.

Open-heel fins have a foot pocket with an open heel area, and the fin is held to the foot by springs or straps which are usually adjustable and so will fit a limited range of foot sizes. They can be worn over boots and are common in diving, in particular where a diver has to walk into the water from a shore and requires foot protection. Some manufacturers produce fins with the same blade architecture but a choice of heel type.

=== Paddle vs split ===

Paddle fins have simple plastic, composite, or rubber blades that work as extensions of the feet while kicking. Some paddle fins have channels and grooves claimed to improve power and efficiency though it has been shown that the desired effect does not usually occur. Relatively stiff paddle fins are widely believed to be the most versatile and have improved swimming economy in men. Tests in women showed a more flexible fin to be more economical, most likely due to lower leg power. Stiff paddle fins are required for certain types of kicks — such as back kicks and helicopter turns — performed by scuba divers trained in cave diving and wreck diving to avoid stirring up sediment.

Some swimfins have a split along the centreline of the blade. The manufacturers claim that split fins operate similarly to a propeller, by creating lift forces to move the swimmer forwards. The claim is that water flowing toward the center of the fin&#x27;s &quot;paddle&quot; portion also gains speed as it focuses, creating a &quot;suction&quot; force. A 2003 study by Pendergast &quot;et al&quot; called this into question by showing that there was no significant change in performance for a particular split fin design when the split was taped over. The technology used in most commercial split fin designs is patented by the industrial design firm Nature&#x27;s Wing, and is used under license.

===Paddle variations===

====Vented====
Vented fins were first designed in 1964 by Georges Beuchat and commercialised as Jetfins. The Jetfin tradename and design were sold to Scubapro in the 1970s. Vented fins are generally stiff paddle fins that have vents at the base of the foot pocket. The vents are intended to allow for the passage of water during the recovery stroke, but prevent passage during power strokes due to the blade angle, attempting to lessen effort during recovery and improve kick efficiency. A review and study by Pendergast &quot;et al&quot; in 2003 concluded that vented fins did not improve economy, implying that water does not pass through the vents. The study is only partially significant because it only considers the flutter kick, whereas the jetfin is mostly used with frog kick in the technical diving community. There is a risk of objects snagging in the vents.

====Freediving====
These are very similar to paddle fins, except they are far longer, and designed to work with slow stiff-legged kicks that are claimed to conserve oxygen and energy. The vast majority are made in the &quot;full-foot&quot; design with very rigid footpockets, which serves to reduce weight and maximize power transfer from the leg into the fin. Freediving fin blades are commonly made of plastic, but are also often made from composite materials using fibreglass or carbon fibre reinforcement. The composite blades are more resilient and absorb less energy when flexing, but are relatively fragile and more easily damaged.
====Swimming training====
The value of fins as an active aid in the teaching, learning and practice of swimming has long been recognised. In the US, as early as 1947, they were used experimentally to build the confidence of reluctant beginners in swimming, while a 1950 YMCA lifesaving and water safety manual reminded swimming instructors how &quot;flippers can be used to great advantage for treading water, surface diving, towing, underwater searching and supporting a tired swimmer&quot;. In 1967, research was conducted on fin use in teaching the crawl stroke. During the 1970s, the so-called &quot;flipper-float&quot; method came into vogue in Europe with the aim of helping beginners learn to swim faster and more safely, while the deployment of fins to assist competitive swimmers in building sprint swimming speed skills also came under scrutiny. By 1990, ready-made short-bladed fins such as Marty Hull&#x27;s &quot;Zoomers&quot; and cut-down longer-bladed fins became popular for lap swimming as swim workouts grew to be more nuanced and less regimented. Training fins, as they are now called, continue to be popular tools in an aquatic athlete&#x27;s swimbag well into the new millennium, for recreational reasons as well as skill-building purposes.

====Bodysurfing====

Fins intended for bodyboarding or bodysurfing are usually relatively short with a stiff-blade, designed to produce a short burst of power and assist in catching a wave. Some versions have blades which are shorter at the inside edge. They are often made with an integral strap but an open heel, allowing sand to wash out more easily. 

==Attachment==
Open heel fins are secured to the foot by a strap which passes around the back of the ankle. These are usually elastic and may be adjustable. Early fins used rubber straps connected to the fin by a wire buckle, and were not readily adjustable. Later versions incorporated swivels, buckles, quick release connectors and adjustable tension, but the increased complexity and decreased reliability, and tendency of the loose strap ends to hook on things triggered a return by some manufacturers and aftermarket accessory manufacturers to simpler systems. These include stainless steel spring straps and bungee straps, which once set up, are not adjustable, and which reduce the number of potential failure points and places where the fin can snag on obstructions like net, line and seaweed. Some heel straps have a loop for better grip with wet hands or gloves.
Some fins designed for surf use have integral straps which can neither be replaced nor adjusted, but are simple and have no projections which can snag or scratch the swimmer&#x27;s legs. They are much like full foot pocket fins without the back part of the sole, but do not trap as much sand when used in the surf.

===Fin retainers===

A full-foot swimming fin is designed to be secured on the foot by the elasticity of the fin&#x27;s heelpiece. If this fin has a slightly oversized foot pocket, it may fall off when the user is swimming in choppy waters, but a pair of fin grips can help avert this mishap. &quot;Fixe-palmes&quot;, fin retainers, or fin grips, were invented and patented in 1959 by the French diving equipment company Beuchat in Marseilles. Widely copied during the 1970s, they are simple flat rings with three loops or straps made from thin high stretch rubber. These Y-shaped anchor straps are worn over the arch, the heel and the instep of each foot in order to secure strapless shoe-fitting (full foot) swim fins (see Figure 3). Although they are not designed to hold open-heel and strap models on, some swimmers and divers use them for this purpose. One loop is pulled over the foot above the ankle and the swim fin fitted to the foot. The second loop is pulled under the heel of the fin, leaving the remaining loop at the back of the heel. This procedure is illustrated in Figures 4–7.
==Use==

===Techniques===

The use of swimfins for propulsion can be divided into propulsion and maneuvering aspects.

====Propulsion====

Three basic modes of propulsive finning can be distinguished:
* Scissor or flutter kick involves alternate motion of the fins parallel to the sagittal plane of the swimmer. As the one leg thrusts in the ventral direction in the power stroke, the other performs the return stroke, which provides some thrust, but is significantly less powerful in most cases as the ankle tends to feather the blade. The blade must bend during the power stroke to thrust water away from the diver and thereby provide propulsion along the centreline. Efficient propulsion requires a low drag attitude in the water, and thrust along the direction of movement.
* Frog kick involves the simultaneous and laterally mirrored motion of both legs together, mostly parallel to the frontal plane. The power stroke is provided by thrusting the fins distally and towards the centreline by extending hips, knees and ankles, while rotating the fins to maximise thrust. The recovery stroke pulls the feathered fins towards the centre of mass and apart by flexing the hips, knees and ankles.
* Dolphin kick uses both legs together in a parallel motion. The movements are similar to those of flutter kick, but both legs perform the power and recovery strokes together. There is more use of the back and abdominal muscles, and considerable power can be exerted, but this requires equivalent effort, and can be stressful on people with lower back problems. Dolphin kick can be used with all fin types, and is the only option available when using a monofin.

Modified styles of flutter and frog kick can be used to reduce down-flow of water which can disturb silt and reduce visibility, and are used when finning close to silty surfaces, such as inside caves and wrecks, or near the bottom of quarries, dams, lakes and some harbours.

====Maneuvering====

Turning on the spot and reversing are possible with suitable fins and skills. 
* The back kick is used to provide thrust along the length of the body, but in the opposite direction to normal propulsion. Back kick reversing is considered maneuvering rather than propulsion as it is relatively very inefficient and only used when necessary.
* A helicopter turn is the rotation of the horizontal swimmer around a vertical axis through the body, by paddling movements of one or both fins, using mostly lower leg and ankle movement. The use of a separate fin on each foot allows far more freedom of motion for manoeuvering, as they can be used independently, in parallel or in opposition to produce thrust in a wide variety of directions. Manoeuverability with a monofin is relatively restricted.

=== Training ===
Divers are initially taught to fin with legs straight, without excess bending of the knee, the action coming from the hips; a leg action with much upper leg flexion with bent knees like riding a bicycle is inefficient and is a common fault with divers who have not learned properly how to fin swim. This leg action feels easier because it is actually producing less thrust. Fins with differing characteristics (e.g. stiffness) may be preferred, depending on the application, and divers may have to learn a modified finning style to match.

=== Power ===
The upper sustainable limit of a diver&#x27;s fin-kick thrust force using a stationary-swimming was shown to be . The maximum thrust averaged over 20 seconds against a strain gauge has been measured as high as . Resistive respiratory muscle training improves and maintains endurance fin swimming performance in divers.

=== Ergonomics ===
Experimental work suggests that larger fin blades are more efficient in converting diver effort to thrust, and are more economical in breathing gas for similar propulsive effect. Larger fins were perceived to be less fatiguing than smaller fins.

<text>In elections in the United States, political drafts are used to encourage or pressure a certain person to enter a political race, by demonstrating a significant groundswell of support for the candidate.

==History==
=== 20th century ===
Movements to draft five-star general Dwight D. Eisenhower to run as a candidate for President of the United States appeared in both the Democratic and Republican parties in 1948 and again during 1951. Eisenhower did his best to ignore them, but Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. entered Eisenhower in the 1952 New Hampshire Republican primary without the general&#x27;s authorization. Eisenhower won all the Republican delegates and defeated Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, who had campaigned intensively in the state, by a vote of 50% to 38%. Eisenhower told a reporter, &quot;Any American who would have that many other Americans pay him that compliment would be proud or he would not be an American&quot;, and announced his candidacy the next day. He defeated Adlai Stevenson — himself drafted as the Democratic nominee — in November 1952.

In the early 1960s, two volunteers started a movement to draft Barry Goldwater, an unlikely and unwilling candidate back then. Goldwater initially gave such remarks as &quot;I&#x27;m not a candidate. And I&#x27;m not going to be. I have no intention of running for the Presidency&quot;, and &quot;&#x27;Draft&#x27; nothing. I told you I&#x27;m not going to run.&quot; However, the effort eventually convinced Goldwater and won him the Republican nomination in 1964 in the face of the self-financed campaign of Nelson Rockefeller, the ridicule of the national press, and the refusal by Goldwater to run.

=== 21st century ===
The candidacy of General Wesley Clark was the result of a draft. Clark, who had recently retired from the military and taken a job as a CNN military analyst, had no intention of running until multiple &quot;Draft Clark&quot; sites appeared on the web urging Clark to run. Over an approximate two-month period the draft became a nationwide effort due to TV coverage and the use of the internet. In September 2003, Clark said he would make up his mind on whether to accept the draft or not in the near future. Soon after that statement, Clark announced his candidacy in his hometown of Little Rock, Arkansas, citing that he was pulled in by the people to run for the presidency.

There was a draft campaign for former Vice President Al Gore prior to the 2008 election. Gore, who had won the Nobel Prize while out of office, repeatedly ruled out running for president in the 2008 election. Gore eventually endorsed Senator Barack Obama after he became the presumptive nominee.

Prior to the 2008 election, a group of people tried to draft Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice for the presidency. The group went so far as to buy television and radio time in Iowa, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Florida, and even roadside billboards. Though Rice had publicly declined to run, the groundswell of support for this cause continued to gain notoriety in national and international media. The most prominent &quot;Draft Rice&quot; group was called Americans for Rice.

In the fall of 2008, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; reported on a campaign to draft Joe Wurzelbacher to run against Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio&#x27;s 9th congressional district. The draft campaign began with the website &quot;joewurzelbacher2010.com&quot;, created by Trevor Lair, presently the chairman of the Massachusetts College Republicans. From the beginning of the draft campaign Wurzelbacher stated he was interested in running in the 2010 election for Ohio&#x27;s 9th congressional district; when asked by Laura Ingraham in October 2008 if he would run against Rep. Marcy Kaptur, Wurzelbacher responded he had considered doing so and would be &quot;up for it.&quot;
From 2013 to 2014, polls were conducted by media sources such as The Washington Post which suggested that if the 2012 US Presidential election were held then, incumbent Barack Obama would lose to challenger Mitt Romney. Later on, from the middle of 2014 to 2015, polls that included Romney showed an overwhelming double-digit lead over even Jeb Bush,⁣ who was considered to be a front-runner of the party. This data combined helped to spark a movement to draft Mitt Romney into the race, the most notable example being found in the Draft Mitt Campaign. Romney would initially deny the possibility of a third run, eventually did end up flirting with the idea, but in late January 2015 confirmed he would definitely not be making another campaign for the Presidency, stating &quot;I&#x27;ve decided it is best to give other leaders in the Party the opportunity to become our next nominee”.

In 2015, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that MoveOn.org and Democracy for America said they would support efforts to draft Elizabeth Warren into the 2016 US Presidential race. The two groups created and ran the website . Some Republicans saw her as potentially weakening Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign, whilst Democrats hoped that the threat of Warren would push Clinton towards more populist stances on issues. Libertarians share Warren&#x27;s disdain for the bank bailout, but for different reasons. In Iowa, where she was then largely unknown, an October 2014 poll showed that 44% of likely Democratic caucus goers had a favorable opinion of her, though more felt favorably about Clinton. In a January 2015 interview with Fortune Magazine, Warren denied interest in running. Warren ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential election.

<doc id="419859" wikidata="Q389391" url="?curid=419859" title="Classical test theory">
<text>Classical test theory (CTT) is a body of related psychometric theory that predicts outcomes of psychological testing such as the difficulty of items or the ability of test-takers. It is a theory of testing based on the idea that a person&#x27;s observed or obtained score on a test is the sum of a true score (error-free score) and an error score. Generally speaking, the aim of classical test theory is to understand and improve the reliability of psychological tests.

&quot;Classical test theory&quot; may be regarded as roughly synonymous with &quot;true score theory&quot;. The term &quot;classical&quot; refers not only to the chronology of these models but also contrasts with the more recent psychometric theories, generally referred to collectively as item response theory, which sometimes bear the appellation &quot;modern&quot; as in &quot;modern latent trait theory&quot;.

Classical test theory as we know it today was codified by and described in classic texts such as and . The description of classical test theory below follows these seminal publications.

==History==
Classical test theory was born only after the following three achievements or ideas were conceptualized: 

# a recognition of the presence of errors in measurements, 
# a conception of that error as a random variable, 
# a conception of correlation and how to index it. 

In 1904, Charles Spearman was responsible for figuring out how to correct a correlation coefficient for attenuation due to measurement error and how to obtain the index of reliability needed in making the correction. Spearman&#x27;s finding is thought to be the beginning of Classical Test Theory by some . Others who had an influence in the Classical Test Theory&#x27;s framework include: George Udny Yule, Truman Lee Kelley, Fritz Kuder &amp; Marion Richardson involved in making the Kuder–Richardson Formulas, Louis Guttman, and, most recently, Melvin Novick, not to mention others over the next quarter century after Spearman&#x27;s initial findings.

==Definitions==
Classical test theory assumes that each person has a &quot;true score&quot;,&quot;T&quot;, that would be obtained if there were no errors in measurement. A person&#x27;s true score is defined as the expected number-correct score over an infinite number of independent administrations of the test. Unfortunately, test users never observe a person&#x27;s true score, only an &quot;observed score&quot;, &quot;X&quot;. It is assumed that &quot;observed score&quot; = &quot;true score&quot; plus some &quot;error&quot;:
 X = T + E
 observed score true score error

Classical test theory is concerned with the relations between the three variables formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 in the population. These relations are used to say something about the quality of test scores. In this regard, the most important concept is that of &quot;reliability&quot;. The reliability of the observed test scores formula_1, which is denoted as formula_5, is defined as the ratio of true score variance formula_6 to the observed score variance formula_7:

: formula_8

Because the variance of the observed scores can be shown to equal the sum of the variance of true scores and the variance of error scores, this is equivalent to

: formula_9

This equation, which formulates a signal-to-noise ratio, has intuitive appeal: The reliability of test scores becomes higher as the proportion of error variance in the test scores becomes lower and vice versa. The reliability is equal to the proportion of the variance in the test scores that we could explain if we knew the true scores. The square root of the reliability is the absolute value of the correlation between true and observed scores.

==Evaluating tests and scores: Reliability==
Reliability cannot be estimated directly since that would require one to know the true scores, which according to classical test theory is impossible. However, estimates of reliability can be acquired by diverse means. One way of estimating reliability is by constructing a so-called &quot;parallel test&quot;. The fundamental property of a parallel test is that it yields the same true score and the same observed score variance as the original test for every individual. If we have parallel tests x and x&#x27;, then this means that

: formula_10

and

: formula_11

Under these assumptions, it follows that the correlation between parallel test scores is equal to reliability (see , for a proof).

: formula_12

Using parallel tests to estimate reliability is cumbersome because parallel tests are very hard to come by. In practice the method is rarely used. Instead, researchers use a measure of internal consistency known as Cronbach&#x27;s formula_13. Consider a test consisting of formula_14 items formula_15, formula_16. The total test score is defined as the sum of the individual item scores, so that for individual formula_17

: formula_18

Then Cronbach&#x27;s alpha equals

: formula_19

Cronbach&#x27;s formula_13 can be shown to provide a lower bound for reliability under rather mild assumptions. Thus, the reliability of test scores in a population is always higher than the value of Cronbach&#x27;s formula_13 in that population. Thus, this method is empirically feasible and, as a result, it is very popular among researchers. Calculation of Cronbach&#x27;s formula_13 is included in many standard statistical packages such as SPSS and SAS.

As has been noted above, the entire exercise of classical test theory is done to arrive at a suitable definition of reliability. Reliability is supposed to say something about the general quality of the test scores in question. The general idea is that, the higher reliability is, the better. Classical test theory does not say how high reliability is supposed to be. Too high a value for formula_13, say over .9, indicates redundancy of items. Around .8 is recommended for personality research, while .9+ is desirable for individual high-stakes testing. These &#x27;criteria&#x27; are not based on formal arguments, but rather are the result of convention and professional practice. The extent to which they can be mapped to formal principles of statistical inference is unclear.

==Evaluating items: P and item-total correlations==
Reliability provides a convenient index of test quality in a single number, reliability. However, it does not provide any information for evaluating single items. Item analysis within the classical approach often relies on two statistics: the P-value (proportion) and the item-total correlation (point-biserial correlation coefficient). The P-value represents the proportion of examinees responding in the keyed direction, and is typically referred to as &quot;item difficulty&quot;. The item-total correlation provides an index of the discrimination or differentiating power of the item, and is typically referred to as &quot;item discrimination&quot;. In addition, these statistics are calculated for each response of the oft-used multiple choice item, which are used to evaluate items and diagnose possible issues, such as a confusing distractor. Such valuable analysis is provided by specially-designed psychometric software.

==Alternatives==
Classical test theory is an influential theory of test scores in the social sciences. In psychometrics, the theory has been superseded by the more sophisticated models in item response theory (IRT) and generalizability theory (G-theory). However, IRT is not included in standard statistical packages like SPSS, but SAS can estimate IRT models via PROC IRT and PROC MCMC and there are IRT packages for the open source statistical programming language R (e.g., CTT). While commercial packages routinely provide estimates of Cronbach&#x27;s formula_13, specialized psychometric software may be preferred for IRT or G-theory. However, general statistical packages often do not provide a complete classical analysis (Cronbach&#x27;s formula_13 is only one of many important statistics), and in many cases, specialized software for classical analysis is also necessary.

==Shortcomings==
One of the most important or well-known shortcomings of classical test theory is that examinee characteristics and test characteristics cannot be separated: each can only be interpreted in the context of the other. Another shortcoming lies in the definition of reliability that exists in classical test theory, which states that reliability is &quot;the correlation between test scores on parallel forms of a test&quot;. The problem with this is that there are differing opinions of what parallel tests are. Various reliability coefficients provide either lower bound estimates of reliability or reliability estimates with unknown biases. A third shortcoming involves the standard error of measurement. The problem here is that, according to classical test theory, the standard error of measurement is assumed to be the same for all examinees. However, as Hambleton explains in his book, scores on any test are unequally precise measures for examinees of different ability, thus making the assumption of equal errors of measurement for all examinees implausible . A fourth, and final shortcoming of the classical test theory is that it is test oriented, rather than item oriented. In other words, classical test theory cannot help us make predictions of how well an individual or even a group of examinees might do on a test item.

<doc id="419864" wikidata="Q5790068" url="?curid=419864" title="Lewis Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt">
<text>Lewis Vernon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt (born Reginald Vernon Harcourt; 31 January 1863 – 24 February 1922), was a British Liberal Party politician who held the Cabinet post of Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1910 to 1915. Lord Harcourt&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Loulou&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Harcourt was born at Nuneham Courtenay, Oxfordshire, the only surviving son of politician Sir William Vernon Harcourt and his first wife, Maria Theresa Lister. He was originally christened with the name Reginald, in honour of his father&#x27;s university friend Reginald Cholmondeley, but when George Cornewall Lewis died just over two months after, he was rechristened with the name Lewis. He was educated at Eton. He studied Doctor of Civil Law at University of Oxford.

He inherited the lordships of the manors of Stanton Harcourt, Nuneham Courtenay, North Hinksey, Cogges, Northmoor and Shifford in Oxfordshire.

==Political career==
Harcourt was private secretary to his father, Sir William, as Home Secretary from 1880 to 1885; and again when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1886, and 1892–95. He was Liberal Member of Parliament for Rossendale, Lancashire, from 1904 to 1916 and served as First Commissioner of Works in Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s 1905 ministry (appointed to Cabinet in 1907) and to H. H. Asquith&#x27;s Cabinet between 1908 and 1910 and again between 1915 and 1916. In this role he authorised the placement in Kensington Gardens of the Peter Pan statue, sculpted by George Frampton, erected on 1 May 1912, and the plans for the rebuilding of Piccadilly Circus in 1915 (eventually executed in 1923).

Between 1910 and 1915, he was Secretary of State for the Colonies under Asquith. In 1911 his home in Berkeley Square had windows smashed by suffragettes, including Ada Wright who were imprisoned for two weeks. Harcourt was raised to the peerage as &quot;Viscount Harcourt, of Stanton Harcourt in the County of Oxford&quot;, in 1917.

During the debate over Chancellor David Lloyd George&#x27;s proposed &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot; Harcourt was amongst its foremost critics, with Malcolm Thomson, Lloyd George&#x27;s official biographer, writing that he was &quot;the most inveterate in obstructing his proposals, while posing all the time as an ardent Radical&quot;.

==Public appointments and other interests==
Harcourt acted as a Trustee of the British Museum, Wallace Collection, the London Museum, and the National Portrait Gallery, which has a portrait of him.

Harcourt was interested in natural history and sought to protect birds, fish and other creatures from extinction. He received an Honorary DCL from Oxford University and was also an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.

==Port Harcourt==
Port Harcourt, capital of Rivers State in southern Nigeria, is named after him. When the port was established in 1912, there was much controversy about the name it should receive. In August 1913, the Governor-General of Nigeria, Sir Frederick Lugard wrote to Harcourt, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, that &quot;in the absence of any convenient local name, I would respectfully ask your permission to call this Port Harcourt&quot;. The Secretary of State replied, &quot;It gives me pleasure to accede to your suggestion that my name should be associated with the new Port&quot;.

==Queen Victoria==
Harcourt&#x27;s diaries contain a report that one of Queen Victoria&#x27;s chaplains, Revd Norman Macleod, made a deathbed confession repenting of his action in presiding over Queen Victoria&#x27;s marriage to her servant, John Brown.

==Marriage and children==

On 1 July 1899, Harcourt married Mary Ethel Burns, daughter of American banker Walter Hayes Burns and his wife, Mary Lyman (&quot;née&quot; Morgan), a sister of J. P. Morgan. Through her, the family acquired the famous &quot;Harcourt emeralds&quot;.

Mary, Viscountess Harcourt, was appointed a Lady of Grace of the Order of St John and then Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1918; she died 7 January 1961.

Lord and Lady Harcourt had four children:
* Hon. Doris Mary Thérèse Harcourt (30 March 1900 – 9 May 1981); married Alexander Baring, 6th Baron Ashburton: their elder son John succeeded as 7th Baron Ashburton.
* Hon. Olivia Vernon Harcourt (5 April 1902 – 2 August 1984); married The Hon. (Godfrey) John Mulholland, younger son of 2nd Baron Dunleath (d. 1948); with 1 son and 2 daughters. She served as Woman of the Bedchamber to HM Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother 1951–1961.
* Hon. Barbara Vernon Harcourt (28 April 1905 – 19 May 1961); married Robert Jenkinson (1900–1970), a great-great grandson of Col. John Jenkinson, brother of the 1st Earl of Liverpool, in 1927 (later divorced); with 1 son and 2 daughters. She remarried, in 1937, William James Baird (9 November 1893 – 2 February 1961). She died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound a few months after her husband&#x27;s death.
* William Edward Harcourt, 2nd Viscount Harcourt (5 October 1908 – 3 January 1979), succeeded as Viscount Harcourt at age 13.

==Sexual misconduct==

Harcourt was known in London society as a sexual predator of the young of both genders. He attempted to sexually assault Dorothy Brett, the daughter of Viscount Esher (allegedly a fellow paedophile), when she was about 15. Brett wrote of him that &quot;It is so tiresome that Loulou is such an old &quot;roué&quot;. He is as bad with boys as with girls... he is simply a sex maniac. It isn&#x27;t that he is in love. It is just ungovernable sex desire for both sexes&quot;.

==Death==
Harcourt died in his sleep at his London townhouse at 69 Brook Street (now the Savile Club) in the early hours of 24 February 1922, aged 59. He had taken an overdose of a sleeping draught, and there were rumours of suicide following accusations of sexual impropriety by Edward James, a young Etonian who later became an important collector of surrealist and other contemporary art. James&#x27;s mother spread the story in society, although the accusations remained unknown by the wider public for fifty years. An inquest was held as to the cause of death, which returned a verdict of death by misadventure; the underlying cause being given as heart failure and sudden oedema of the lungs brought on by a dose of Bromidia, which he had been prescribed as a sleep aid. According to the coroner, who found extensive heart disease, the amount of Bromidia he had taken would not have caused death in a healthy person. According to his valet, there was only a very small amount of Bromidia left in the bottle the prior evening, which Harcourt did not take regularly.

His physician, Dr Lindsay Scott, had last seen him on 30 January and testified that Harcourt was not in very good health, being weak and with an irregular heartbeat. He said that he did not expect him to die suddenly, but admitted, &quot;I did not think he would live many years.&quot; The coroner dismissed the notion of suicide as &quot;grotesque&quot; given the evidence. Patrick Jackson, Harcourt&#x27;s biographer in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, also noted that suicide seemed unlikely given that Harcourt was in the midst of finishing a biography on his father, Sir William, which he had commissioned from Alfred George Gardiner. Harcourt had spent the evening prior to his death editing a recent draft and had an appointment with Gardiner the following day to discuss the project. Jackson writes, &quot;It seems hard to believe that Harcourt would not have wished to see through to completion an enterprise over which he had exercised tight control, and which recalled for him the glorious days of political partnership with his father.&quot;

A memorial service for Lord Harcourt was held on 1 March at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, with Prebendary of Westminster William Carnegie officiating with the Very Rev. Albert Baillie, Dean of Windsor. Lord Harcourt was buried after a large, well-attended funeral service the same day at the parish church at Nuneham Courtney, conducted by Bishop of Oxford Hubert Burge, Bishop of Birmingham Henry Wakefield, and the rector Rev. Hildebrand Thomas Giles Alington. He was buried in the family vault in the churchyard.

<doc id="419866" wikidata="Q951932" url="?curid=419866" title="Battle of Sybota">
<text>The Battle of Sybota () took place in 433 BC between Corcyra (modern Corfu) and Corinth. It was one of the immediate catalysts for the Peloponnesian War.

==History==
Corinth had been in dispute with Corcyra, an old Corinthian colony which no longer wanted to remain under Corinthian influence (see Affair of Epidamnus for background). Corcyra, which had the third largest navy in Greece at the time, allied itself with Athens, an enemy of Corinth (as Corinth was allied with Sparta). Athens sent ten ships to Corcyra to reinforce the Corcyraean fleet, with instructions not to fight the Corinthian fleet unless they attempted to land on the island. Corinth, meanwhile, assembled a fleet of ships under the command of Xenoclides and prepared to sail to Corcyra.

Corcyra gathered a fleet under Miciades, Aisimides and Eurybatus, who made the Sybota islands their base of operations. The Athenian commanders, Lacedaimonius (the son of Cimon), Diotimus, and Proteas, sailed with them. Corcyra had 110 ships, plus the additional 10 provided by Athens, while Corinth had 150 ships. When the Corinthian ships arrived, the Corcyraeans formed their line of battle, with the Athenians on the right and their own ships making up the rest of the line in three squadrons. The Corinthian ships were lined up with the Megarians and Ambraciots on the right, the Corinthians on the left, and the remainder of their allies in the centre. Both sides fought with hoplites on their ships, along with archers and javelin-throwers, in a manner Thucydides calls &quot;old-fashioned.&quot; Instead of ramming and sinking the other ships, both sides attempted to board their opponents&#x27; ships and fight what was essentially a land battle at sea. The Athenian ships, although they were part of the line, did not at first join the battle, as the Corinthians had not attempted to land.

The Corcyraean ships on the left routed the Corinthian right wing, chasing them all the way back to their camp on the coast, which they then burned. The Corinthian left wing, however, was more successful, and the Athenians were forced to come to the aid of their allies. Despite the Athenian intervention, the Corinthians were victorious, and sailed through the wreckage of defeated ships often killing survivors rather than taking prisoners (including, although they did not know it, some of their own allies who had been defeated on the right-wing). They did not kill everyone, however, and captured a number of prisoners.

The Corcyraeans and Athenians headed back to Corcyra to defend the island, but when the Corinthians arrived, they almost immediately retreated, as 20 more Athenian ships under the command of Glaucon were on their way. The next day, the new Athenian ships threatened a second battle if the Corinthians attempted to land on Corcyra. The Corinthians retreated completely rather than risk another battle. Both the Corinthians and Corcyraeans claimed victory, the Corinthians having won the first battle, and the Corcyraeans having avoided a Corinthian occupation of their island.

Soon after this battle, the Athenians and Corinthians fought again at the Battle of Potidaea, leading to a formal declaration of war from Sparta.

<doc id="419900" wikidata="Q16931832" url="?curid=419900" title="Rent control in the United States">
<text>In the United States, rent control refers to laws or ordinances that set price controls on the rent of residential housing to function as a price ceiling. More loosely, &quot;rent control&quot; describes several types of price control:
* &quot;strict price ceilings&quot;, also known as &quot;rent freeze&quot; systems, or &quot;absolute&quot; or &quot;first generation&quot; rent controls, in which no increases in rent are allowed at all (rent is typically frozen at the rate existing when the law was enacted);
* &quot;vacancy control&quot;, also known as &quot;strict&quot; or &quot;strong&quot; rent control, in which the rental price can rise but continues to be regulated in between tenancies (a new tenant pays almost the same rent as the previous tenant); and 
* &quot;vacancy decontrol&quot;, also known as &quot;tenancy&quot; or &quot;second-generation&quot; rent control, which limits price increases during a tenancy but allows rents to rise to market rate between tenancies (new tenants pay market rate rent but increases are limited as long as they remain).

As of 2022, seven states (California, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Maine, Oregon, and Minnesota) and the District of Columbia have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect (for normal structures, excluding mobile homes). Thirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while seven states allow their cities to enact rent control but have no cities that have implemented it. For localities with rent control, it often covers a large percentage of that city&#x27;s stock of rental units. For example, in New York City as of 2017, 45% of rental units were &quot;rent stabilized&quot; and 1% were &quot;rent controlled&quot; (these are different legal classifications in NYC). In the District of Columbia as of 2019, about 36% of rental units were rent controlled. In San Francisco as of 2014, about 75% of all rental units were rent controlled, and in Los Angeles in 2014, 80% of multifamily units were rent controlled.

In 2019, Oregon&#x27;s legislature passed a bill which made the state the first in the nation to adopt a state-wide rent control policy. This new law limits annual rent increases to inflation plus 7 percent, includes vacancy decontrol (market rate between tenancies), exempts new construction for 15 years, and keeps the current state ban on local rent control policies (state level preemption) intact. In November 2021, voters in Saint Paul, Minnesota, passed a rent control ballot initiative that capped annual rent increases at 3 percent, included vacancy control, and did not exempt new construction or allow inflation to be added to the allowable rate increase. This resulted in an 80% reduction in requests for new multifamily housing permits, while in neighboring Minneapolis, where voters authorized the city council to craft a rent control ordinance which might exempt new construction, permits were up 70%.

There is a consensus among economists that rent control reduces the quality and quantity of rental housing units. Other observers see rent control as benefiting the renter, preventing excessive rent increases and unfair evictions. Rent control may stabilize a community, promoting continuity, and it may mitigate income inequality.

==History==
In the United States during World War I, rents were &quot;controlled&quot; through a combination of public pressure and the efforts of local anti-rent-profiteering committees. Between 1919 and 1924, a number of cities and states adopted rent- and eviction-control laws. Modern rent controls were first adopted in response to the Great Depression and WWII- era shortages. Because of these shortages and the overall national economic crisis, the federal government called for emergency price control on consumer goods and rent control in 1942. However, not all states decided to implement these rent control laws.

During World War II roughly 80% of rental housing was put under rent control starting in 1941. The observed result was that landlords opted to sell their units at uncontrolled prices rather than renting at controlled prices, leading to an increase in home ownership and a decrease in rental units.

It was not until the 1970s, during the economic recession, that Richard Nixon temporarily implemented a national wage and price controls to combat inflation, but this did not last for long and began to phase out in 1973. Nonetheless, tenants particularly in Berkeley kept organizing and brought rent stabilization to the June 6, 1973 L972 ballot. They won and Berkeley became the first city in California to have rent control since World War II. Other cities around the country followed and some still remain in effect or have been reintroduced in certain cities with large tenant populations, such as New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Oakland, California. Many smaller communities also have rent control — notably the California cities of Santa Monica, Berkeley, and West Hollywood — along with many small towns in New Jersey. In the early 1990s, rent control in some cities, such as Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, was ended by state referendums. When rent control ended in Cambridge, the city realized a 20% increase in new development and an increase in property values, according to a study by the MIT Center for Real Estate.

History reveals that these regulations are constantly in flux and adapting to situations such as natural disasters, economic crises, and pandemics. These changes do not always look the same and vary within each state and city. For example, due to COVID-19, Oakland, California implemented a moratorium to prevent evictions from happening, which ended in February 2021. Whereas in Massachusetts the eviction moratorium ended on October 17, 2020, and there was a CDC moratorium that stopped physical removals in cases where tenants owed rent due to illness or job loss until December 31, 2020.

===New York===

New York State has had the longest history of rent controls, since 1920. New York City contains the majority of units covered by rent control. Rent control laws have stayed on the books for decades in New York because of an inadequate supply of &quot;decent, affordable housing&quot;. The worsening in the rental market led to the enactment of the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969, which aimed to help increase the number of available rental units. The current system is very complicated, and most of the protected renters are elderly. William A. Moses, the founder of the Community Housing Improvement Program, a trade association that represents the owners of over 4,000 apartment buildings in New York City, said in 1983 that rent control was &quot;the principal reason for neighborhood deterioration&quot; and that at least 300,000 apartment units would have been built in New York City without it. Moses argued that landlords might not maintain their property if they were not allowed to collect adequate rent. Urban planning scholar Peter Marcuse said in 1983 that rent control was not the reason for some landlords abandoning their NYC properties at the low end of the market – instead, such abandonment stemmed from the inability of low-income renters to pay the maximum rent allowed by law. New York expanded rent control to encompass other municipalities in 2019 through the passage of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019. Since then, opponents have argued these new rent control regulations hinder investment in multifamily properties in New York City. New York&#x27;s rent control laws have also received criticism for inadvertently benefiting affluent tenants who might not otherwise need rental assistance. Additionally, a survey of property owners who own or manage rent stabilized units in New York City found that rent regulations would lead to fewer non-essential improvements and proactive maintenance at their buildings.

===California===
In California, municipal enactment of rent controls followed the high inflation of the 1970s (causing rents to continually rise) and the 1979 statewide Proposition 13, which set property tax rates at 1%, and capped yearly increases at 2%. Leading the campaign to enact Proposition 13, California politician Howard Jarvis tried to get tenants to vote for Prop 13 by claiming that landlords would pass tax savings along to tenants; when most failed to do so, it became an additional motivating factor for rent control.

In 1985, California adopted the Ellis Act, eliminating municipalities&#x27; ability to prohibit the removal of properties from rental activities after the California Supreme Court in &quot;Nash v. City of Santa Monica&quot; ruled that municipalities could prevent landlords from &quot;going out of business&quot; and withdrawing their properties from the rental market.

&quot;Strong&quot; or &quot;vacancy control&quot; rent control laws were in effect in five California cities (West Hollywood, Santa Monica, Berkeley, East Palo Alto, and Cotati) in 1995, when AB 1164 (known as the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act) preempted some elements of municipal rent control ordinances and eliminated strong rent-control in California (except in special cases like mobile home parks).

In 2018, a statewide initiative (Proposition 10) attempted to repeal the Costa-Hawkins law, which, if passed, would have allowed cities and municipalities to enact &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;vacancy control&quot; systems, allowed rent control to be applied to buildings built after 1995, and would have allowed rent control on single-family homes. All are currently prohibited by Costa-Hawkins. The proposition failed 59% to 41%.

In 2019, the California legislature passed and the governor signed AB 1482, which created a statewide rent cap for the next 10 years. The Tenant Protection Act of 2019 caps annual rent increases at 5% plus regional inflation. For example, had the bill been in effect in 2019, rent increases in Los Angeles would have been capped at 8.3%, and in San Francisco at 9%. The increases are pegged to the rental rate as of March 15, 2019. The new law does not apply to buildings built within the prior 15 years, or to single-family homes (unless owned by corporations or institutional investors). It also includes a requirement to show &quot;just cause&quot; for evictions, and retains &quot;vacancy decontrol&quot;, meaning that rents can increase to market rate between tenants.

In 2020, Michael Weinstein, the founder of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), sponsored and financed a second ballot initiative to allow more rent control, because he felt that AB 1482 (above) did not provide enough tenant protections, such as limiting rent increases between tenants. 2020 California Proposition 21, like its predecessor 2018 California Proposition 10, was funded almost exclusively by Weinstein&#x27;s AIDS Healthcare Foundation, and failed by an almost identical margin. AHF is also a supporter of the &#x27;Justice for Renters Act,&#x27; a 2024 ballot initiative that would expand local control over rent laws.

===Massachusetts===

Rent control existed in Massachusetts between 1970 and 1994 when it was repealed by ballot initiative. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the number of rental units was reduced by 15% and tenants were 8-9% less likely to move due to rent control. Tenants paid 40% below market rates on their units, and the value of properties was diminished by 45%.

During its existence, those who lived in rent controlled apartments included Ruth Abrams, a Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark. It was blamed for the death of at least one landlord, due to the stress caused by a ruling from a rent control board that would require him to raise his entire house to create a new, legal apartment in the basement.

After the repeal, the Massachusetts General Court passed a law protecting low-income tenants in rent control apartments from being evicted. Only 9.4% of tenants in rent control apartments qualified.

===Mobile homes===

In some regions, rent control laws are more commonly adopted for mobile home parks. Reasons given for these laws include residents owning their homes while renting the land the home sits on, the high cost of moving mobile homes, and the loss of home value when they are moved. California, for example, has only 13 local apartment rent control laws but over 100 local mobile home rent control laws. No new mobile home parks have been built in California since 1991.

==Law==
Rent control laws define which rental units are affected, and may only cover larger complexes, or units older than a certain date. To attempt to not disincentivise investment in new housing stock, rent control laws often exempt new construction. For example, San Francisco&#x27;s Rent Stabilization Ordinance exempts all units built after 1979. New York State generally exempts units built after 1974 anywhere in the state (although owners can agree to rent stabilization in exchange for tax benefits).

The frequency and degree of rent increases are limited, usually to the rate of inflation defined by the United States Consumer Price Index or to a fraction thereof. San Francisco, for example, allows annual rent increases of 60% of the CPI, up to a maximum 7%.

Rent control laws are often administered by nonelected rent control boards. Officers in city government assign members of the board, which will ensure mixed numbers of tenants and property owners to balance out their benefits. As stated in Goodman&#x27;s research, a typical rent control board in New York is structured by two tenants, two landlords, and one homeowner. (Gilderbloom &amp; Markham, 1996).

===Federal law===
Rent regulation in the United States is an issue for each state. In 1921, the Supreme Court of the United States case of &quot;Block v. Hirsh&quot; held by a majority that regulation of rents in the District of Columbia as a temporary emergency measure was constitutional, but shortly afterwards in 1924 in &quot;Chastleton Corp v. Sinclair&quot; the same law was unanimously struck down by the Supreme Court. After the 1930s New Deal, the Supreme Court ceased to interfere with social and economic legislation, and a growing number of states adopted rules. In the 1986 case of &quot;Fisher v. City of Berkeley&quot;, the US Supreme court held that there was no incompatibility between rent control and the Sherman Act.

===State and local law===
Oregon and California are the only states with statewide rent control laws, both enacted in 2019. Six states—California, New York, New Jersey, Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota—have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect. The District of Columbia also has rent control for some rental units; publicly owned or assisted properties, properties built in 1978 or later, and properties held by an owner with fewer than five rental units are exempt from D.C.&#x27;s rent-control law.

Thirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while eight states allow their cities to enact rent control, but have no cities that have implemented it.

As of 2019, about 182 U.S. municipalities had rent control: 99 in New Jersey, 63 in New York, 18 in California, one in Maryland, and Washington, D.C. The five most populous cities with rent control are New York City; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Oakland; and Washington, D.C. The sole Maryland municipality with rent control is Takoma Park. On July 23, 2024, Montgomery County, Maryland adopted a rent stabilization law to limit rent increases to the level of inflation.

In 2012, only 2% of economists surveyed believed rent control had a positive impact on New York City and San Francisco; 81 percent disagreed.

==Impact==
There is a consensus among economists that rent control reduces the quality and quantity of housing. A 2009 review of the economic literature by Blair Jenkins found that &quot;the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves&quot;. 

In a 2013 analysis of the body of economic research on rent control by Peter Tatian at the Urban Institute (a think tank described both as &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;independent&quot;), he stated that &quot;The conclusion seems to be that rent stabilization doesn&#x27;t do a good job of protecting its intended beneficiaries—poor or vulnerable renters—because the targeting of the benefits is very haphazard.&quot;, and concluded that: &quot;Given the current research, there seems to be little one can say in favor of rent control.&quot; 

Two economists from opposing sides of the political spectrum, Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman (who identifies as an American liberal or European social democrat), and Thomas Sowell, (who stated that &quot;libertarian&quot; might best describe his views) have both criticized rent regulation as poor economics, which, despite its good intentions, leads to the creation of less housing, raises prices, and increases urban blight. Writing in 1946, economists Milton Friedman and George J. Stigler said: &quot;Rent ceilings, therefore, cause haphazard and arbitrary allocation of space, inefficient use of space, retardation of new construction and indefinite continuance of rent ceilings, or subsidization of new construction and a future depression in residential building.&quot;

Historically, there have been two types of rent control – vacancy control (where the rent level of a unit is controlled irrespective of whether the tenant remains in the unit or not) and vacancy decontrol (where the rent level is controlled only while the existing tenant remains in the unit). In California prior to 1997, both types were allowed (the Costa/Hawkins bill of that year phased out vacancy control provisions). A 1990 study of Santa Monica, CA showed that vacancy control in that city protected existing tenants (lower increases in rent and longer stability). However, the policy potentially discouraged investors from building new rental units.

A 2000 study that compared the border areas of four California cities having vacancy control provisions (Santa Monica, Berkeley, West Hollywood, East Palo Alto) with the border areas of adjoining jurisdictions (two of which allowed vacancy decontrol, including Los Angeles, and two of which had no rent control) showed that existing tenants in the vacancy control cities had lower rents and longer tenure than in the comparison areas. Thus, the ordinances helped protect the existing tenants and, therefore, increased community stability. However, there were fewer new rental units created in the border areas of the vacancy controlled cities over the 10-year period.

A study that compared the effects of local rent control measures (both vacancy control and vacancy decontrol) with other local growth management measures in 490 California cities and counties (including all the largest ones) showed that rent control was stronger than individual land use restrictions (but not the aggregate effect of all growth restrictions) in reducing the number of rental units constructed between 1980 and 1990. The measures (both rent control and growth management) helped displace new construction from the metropolitan areas to the interiors of the state with low income and minority populations being particularly impacted.

In 1994, San Francisco voters passed a ballot initiative which expanded the city&#x27;s existing rent control laws to include small multi-unit apartments with four or less units, built prior to 1980 (about 30% of the city&#x27;s rental housing stock at the time).
 
In 2017, Stanford economics researcher Rebecca Diamond and others published a study which examined the effects of this specific rent control law on the rental units newly controlled compared to similar style units (multi-unit apartments with four or less units) not under rent control (built after 1980), as well as this law&#x27;s effect on the total city rental stock, and on overall rent prices in the city, covering the years from 1995 to 2012.

 They found that while San Francisco&#x27;s rent control laws benefited tenants who had rent controlled units, it also resulted in landlords removing 30% of the units in the study from the rental market, (by conversion to condos or TICs) which led to a 15% citywide decrease in total rental units, and a 7% increase in citywide rents.


 The authors stated that &quot;This substitution toward owner occupied and high-end new construction rental housing likely fueled the gentrification of San Francisco, as these types of properties cater to higher income individuals.&quot;
 

 The authors also noted that &quot;...forcing landlords to provide insurance against rent increases leads to large losses to tenants. If society desires to provide social insurance against rent increases, it would be more desirable to offer this subsidy in the form of a government subsidy or tax credit. This would remove landlords&#x27; incentives to decrease the housing supply and could provide households with the insurance they desire.&quot;


The rental-accommodation market suffers from information asymmetries and high transaction costs. Typically, a landlord has more information about a home than a prospective tenant can reasonably detect. Moreover, once the tenant has moved in, the costs of moving again are very high. Unscrupulous landlords could conceal defects and, if the tenant complains, threaten to raise the rent at the end of the lease. With rent control, tenants can request that hidden defects, if they exist, be repaired to comply with building code requirements, without fearing retaliatory rent increases. Rent control could thus compensate somewhat for inefficiencies of the housing market. In older buildings, rent control may broaden incentives to renovate individual units: tenants may invest sweat equity and their own money to improve their homes if they are protected from landlords trying to capture the added value, while vacancy decontrol preserves landlords&#x27; financial incentive to renovate vacant units because it allows them to re-rent at market value.

According to a 2018 review of new research by Rebecca Diamond, new research showed that rent control benefitted tenants in the short-run, but had adverse effects for tenants and neighborhood stability in the long-run by reducing affordability, increasing gentrification, and creating negative spillovers for nearby neighborhoods. Landlords frequently responded to rent control policies by reconverting rentals into buildings exempt from rent control or by allowing rentals to decay.

A 2019 NBER working paper, which evaluated the efficacy of different housing affordability government policies, found that better targeting of rent control (towards the neediest households) could be welfare improving. A 2021 study modelled rent control policies and found that they may raise housing prices and reduce housing quantities, but that &quot;well-designed rent control may help policymakers to stabilize housing market dynamics, even without creating housing market distortions&quot;.

==Commentary==
In 2000, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist and Princeton University economist Paul Krugman published a frequently cited column on rent control. He wrote, &quot;The analysis of rent control is among the best-understood issues in all of economics, and – among economists anyway – one of the least controversial. In 1992, a poll of the American Economic Association found 93 percent of its members agreeing that &#x27;a ceiling on rents reduces the quality and quantity of housing.&quot;

In light of recent legislative activity and ballot initiatives, several editorial boards have weighed in on rent control. In March 2019, the Chicago Tribune noted, &quot;The cost of rent control would be borne throughout the city in ways that, over time, would leave Chicago worse off. Even for many renters.&quot; In September 2019, the Washington Post argued, &quot;Rent-controlled laws can be good for some privileged beneficiaries, who are often not the people who really need help. But they are bad for many others.&quot; In September 2019, the Wall Street Journal wrote, &quot;Economists of all stripes agree rent control doesn&#x27;t work. A mere 2% think it has positive effects, according to a 2012 survey by the IGM Forum.&quot;

Tenants&#x27; rights activists argue that rent control is necessary in times of long term housing shortages (See California housing shortage) to reduce the human suffering caused by increasing rents and the homelessness which results when people who can no longer afford the rent increases get evicted. Milton Friedman argued that rent control restricts the property rights of property owners, as it limits what they may do with their property, requiring petitioning and other processes by law, prior to taking action against a renter.

<text>The UNIVAC 490 was a UNIVAC computer with 16K or 32K words of magnetic-core memory. The words had 30 bits and the cycle time was 4.8 microseconds. It was a commercial derivative of the instruction set that had been developed for the AN/USQ-17 by Seymour Cray for the United States Navy. This was the last machine that Cray designed before leaving UNIVAC to join the early Control Data Corporation.

Univac Federal Systems would further develop this system into the AN/USQ-20 for the US Navy. That system was the heart of the Naval Tactical Data System which pioneered the use of shipboard computers for air defense. The military version went by a variety of names: UNIVAC 1232, AN/USQ-20, MIL-1206 and CP642.

== Overview ==
At least 47 of these machines were made (serial numbers run from 101 to 147). Six were installed at NASA and played important roles in Gemini and the Apollo missions. The U490 had complete control of most or all of the data readout screens in Houston Mission Control. The USAF had two installed, as did Lockheed.

Airlines using the 490 Real-Time system included Eastern and Northwest Orient – principally airline reservations systems at Eastern Air Lines (1963) and British European Airways (BEACON – 1964). Other commercial installations of the 490 Real-Time included two at Westinghouse, two at Hammermill Paper Company, and one each at Alcoa, U.S. Steel, Bethlehem Steel and General Motors.

The only surviving, nearly complete, original, civilian version of the 490 Real Time System is on display at the System Source Computer Museum in Hunt Valley, Maryland. It has six banks of memory cores. System Source also has a nearly complete set of original documentation for the machine, including original blueprints and troubleshooting data. This includes the Boss and Wilen document.

The standard operating system was REX (RealTime Exec), except at Eastern and B.E.A. where a custom operating system was developed for airline reservations (CONTORTS – CONTrol Of Real Time System). CONTORTS was the origin of Univac&#x27;s subsequent RT operating systems for 494 (STARS) and later converted to the 1100 Series (RTOS).

== Architecture ==

The instruction word format:
*f – Function code designator (6 bits)
*j – Branch condition designator (3 bits)
*k – Operand-interpretation designator (3 bits)
*b – Operand address modification designator (3 bits)
*y – Operand designator (15 bits)

Numbers were represented in ones&#x27; complement.

The machine provided the programmer with the following registers:
*Seven B-registers (Address modifying index registers) 15 bits each
*One A-register or accumulator 30 bits
*One Q-register and auxiliary arithmetic register 30 bits

== Hardware ==

The arithmetic unit used 13,819 transistors of various types and 37,543 diodes of various types.

== Successor systems ==
In June 1965, UNIVAC launched a family of successor systems known as the UNIVAC 490 Modular Real Time Systems. This consisted of the UNIVAC 491, 492 and 494. The 494 was heavily used by NASA as part of the communications complex for the Apollo Mission. Other users include BEA, Iberia Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines and Lufthansa.

Subsequently as UNIVAC decided to focus on the UNIVAC 1100/2200 series an option to run the 1110/80 in 494 mode was added. This emulator was implemented using microcode.

<doc id="419930" wikidata="Q7753694" url="?curid=419930" title="The New Northwest">
<text>The New Northwest was an American weekly newspaper published in Portland, Oregon, from 1871 to 1887 by Abigail Scott Duniway, and for another two years by O. P. Mason. One of the first newspapers in the Western United States to champion the cause of women&#x27;s rights, during its 16-year run, &quot;The New Northwest&quot; emerged as a vigorous voice for women&#x27;s suffrage and for liberalization of marriage law and property rights for women. The newspaper&#x27;s motto was &quot;Free Speech, Free Press, Free People&quot;.

In addition to news reports, &quot;The New Northwest&quot; included topical essays, travel correspondence, and serialized fiction, much of which was written by the prolific Duniway herself.

==History==
===Establishment===
&quot;The New Northwest&quot; was launched on May 5, 1871, by Abigail Scott Duniway (1834–1915). Together with her younger brother, the future chief editorialist of the Portland &quot;Oregonian&quot; Harvey W. Scott (1838–1910), Abigail Scott had become a pioneer to the Oregon Territory in 1852, losing her mother to cholera en route on the Oregon Trail. The future editor had married and begun a family of six children shortly after arriving in the state, moving to Portland early in 1871, just in time to launch her weekly newspaper.

Duniway was moved to a life of political activism and publishing by a deep sense of moral outrage over the control of women&#x27;s lives by the laws and traditional practices of men. She sought to open debate about a wide array of issues important to women through her weekly broadsheet, including not just news of the day but discussions of women&#x27;s suffrage, divorce law, and the economic conditions facing women in frontier-era Oregon. By 1883, the paper had been widely circulated beyond Oregon and Washington, including parts of Idaho and Montana. The launch of Duniway&#x27;s newspaper is regarded by contemporary historians as the first significant event launching the women&#x27;s movement in the Pacific Northwest.

===Political campaigns===

Duniway was instrumental in bringing Susan B. Anthony to Oregon late in the summer of 1871, having the previous year written a letter to invite either her or Elizabeth Cady Stanton to tour the state speaking on behalf of the right to vote for women. Duniway managed a statewide tour for Anthony in succeeding weeks before sending her back to California and overland return to the East. The pair were at the time optimistic about early victories for the suffrage movement in the states of the Pacific Coast, California and Oregon, as well as the Washington Territory, which was finally incorporated into the United States in 1889.

The hopes of Duniway and Anthony were not to be rapidly rewarded in Oregon, however, as male voters five times rejected proposals to expand voting rights to women, voting down initiatives in 1884, 1900, 1906, 1908 and 1910.

Greater success was realized in the field of property rights for women, however, with Duniway and &quot;The New Northwest&#x27;s&quot; efforts credited for helping to pass the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act of 1878 in Oregon, allowing women the right to their wages and to property under state law for the first time.

Only in 1912, long after the 1887 demise of &quot;The New Northwest,&quot; did Oregon pass its women&#x27;s suffrage initiative—an event which Governor Oswald West marked by seeking out the ailing Abigail Scott Duniway and asking her to author and sign the state&#x27;s official proclamation of suffrage.

===Business operation===

&quot;The New Northwest&quot; was a family business for the Duniway family, with Abigail&#x27;s husband Benjamin C. Duniway—permanently disabled since an accident involving a runaway horse team in 1862—acting as business manager and several of the couple&#x27;s five sons assisting with the printing of the paper. Duniway&#x27;s sister, Catherine Coburn, served for a time as editor. The paper prominently bore an assertive motto, &quot;Free Speech, Free Press, Free People,&quot; which Duniway attempted to make a hallmark of the paper. Brother Harvey W. Scott contributed occasionally to the publication following his departure from the &quot;Oregonian&quot;.

===Termination===

Duniway sold the &quot;New Northwest&quot; to O. P. Mason in 1887. Mason dropped the paper&#x27;s political content, and refashioned it as a purely literary publication for two more years.

<doc id="419934" wikidata="Q44544" url="?curid=419934" title="Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party">
<text>The Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party has 55 articles and its contents describe the program of the party, as well as its organizational structure and party symbolism.

== History ==
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP)&#x27;s 1945 constitution described Mao Zedong Thought as the party&#x27;s working compass. It also discusses democracy in the context of New Democracy.

The constitution adopted during April 1969 at the CCP&#x27;s 9th National Congress named Lin Biao as Mao Zedong&#x27;s &quot;close comrade in arms and successor&quot;.

The constitution currently in force was adopted at the CCP&#x27;s 12th National Congress in September 1982. In accordance with the changing situation and tasks, revisions were made in some of the articles at the 13th National Congress in November 1987 and in the General Program and some of the articles at the 14th National Congress in October 1992, and a few revisions were made in the General Program at the 16th National Congress of the CCP in November 2002. The constitution can be amended once every five years.

The 1992 revision of the constitution noted the importance of policy experimentation, incorporating language that the CCP &quot;must boldly experiment with new methods, ... review new experience and solve new problems, and enrich and develop Marxism in practice.&quot;

The CCP&#x27;s 16th National Congress in November 2002 included the incorporation of the Three Represents. The CCP&#x27;s 18th National Congress in November 2012, saw the inclusion of the concept of ecological civilization. The CCP&#x27;s 19th National Congress in October 2017 ratified amendments including the incorporation of Xi Jinping Thought. Xi Jinping thus became the first leader since Deng Xiaoping to append his name into party ideology; the change also led to many international media outlets calling Xi the &quot;most powerful leader since Mao.&quot; The Belt and Road Initiative was also added to the party constitution.

The CCP&#x27;s 20th National Congress in October 2022 saw several amendments to the party constitution. Additions included opposition to Taiwan independence, developing a &quot;fighting spirit&quot; and strengthening fighting ability, as well as additions of goals related to Xi, including gradually achieving common prosperity, promoting Chinese-style modernization and developing a &quot;broader, fuller and more robust&quot; whole-process people&#x27;s democracy. The status of Xi and the CCP were further strengthened with the amendments, with the amended constitution naming the CCP as the &quot;supreme political leadership force&quot;. The Two Upholds was added, thereby cementing the &quot;core&quot; status of Xi Jinping.

== Contents ==
The constitution states that Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the party&#x27;s official ideology. The constitution emphasizes the party&#x27;s role in promoting socialist democracy, in developing and strengthening a socialist legal system, and in consolidating public resolve to carry out the modernization program.

The constitution states that the interests of the people and the party are paramount over the interests of party members. The constitution states that in emergencies and urgent situations, members are encouraged to contribute to special funds (as in the case of the special fund for the 2008 Sichuan earthquake).

Since 1945, the party&#x27;s constitution has defined the party&#x27;s view of democratic centralism as &quot;centralism based on democracy and democracy under centralized leadership.&quot; Academic Jean-Pierre Cabestan writes that this approach defines and limits democracy within the party, indicating that central leadership prevails over the rights of party members to challenge leadership.

<doc id="419946" wikidata="Q4934050" url="?curid=419946" title="Bob Speller">
<text>Robert Speller, (February 29, 1956 – December 16, 2021) was a Canadian politician. A member of the Liberal Party of Canada, Speller was elected to the House of Commons of Canada four times from 1988 to 2000. He was defeated in 2004 by a 20,938 to 19,277 margin.

== Personal life ==
Speller was born in Hagersville, Ontario on February 29, 1956. In 1983, he married Joan Mouland, with whom he had a son, Christopher, and a daughter, Victoria. He died on December 16, 2021, at the age of 65 at a care facility near Waterford, Ontario, after an illness.

== Career ==
Speller was first elected in the 1988 Canadian federal election as a member of the Liberal Party, defeating incumbent Bud Bradley by only 209 votes. Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives won the election, however, relegating Speller to opposition Member of Parliament (MP). As an opposition MP, Speller was associate trade critic, youth critic and chair of the Liberal Rural Caucus.

Speller was re-elected in 1993, 1997 and 2000, as a member of the winning party. Jean Chrétien&#x27;s Liberals won three successive elections. Speller served on the House of Commons Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food (1994–1995), served on the Canadian Parliamentary Association International Executive Committee, served on the Parliamentary Steel Caucus (1993, 1994, 1998), served on the Joint Inter-Parliamentary Council, and was chair of the Sub-committee on Trade, Trade Disputes and Investment and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (Canadian Branch).

On December 12, 2003, incoming Prime Minister Paul Martin named Speller the federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.

Speller represented the constituency of Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant until riding lines were redrawn prior to the June 2004 federal election. In his new riding of Haldimand—Norfolk, Speller lost the election to Conservative candidate Diane Finley, and formally left cabinet the following July.

In June 2005, Prime Minister Paul Martin asked Speller to consider running in the next federal election. Speller ran in the following general election, but was defeated again. Speller did not run in the 2008 federal election but ran again in the 2011 federal election.

<doc id="419950" wikidata="Q3176702" url="?curid=419950" title="Tightlacing">
<text>Tightlacing (also called corset training) is the practice of wearing an increasingly tightly laced corset to achieve cosmetic modifications to the figure and posture or to experience the sensation of bodily restriction. The process originates in mid-19th century Europe and was highly controversial. At the peak of the prevalence of tightlacing, there was much public backlash both from medical doctors and dress reformers, and it was often ridiculed as vain by the general public. Due to a combination of evolving fashion trends, social change regarding the roles of women, and material shortages brought on by World War I and II, tightlacing, and corsets in general, fell out of favor entirely by the early 20th century.

==History==

The corset was a standard undergarment in Western dress for about 400 years beginning in the late 16th century and ending around the beginning of the 20th century. However, the practice of tightlacing began only in the late 1820s and 1830s, after the advent of the steel eyelet in 1827. The use of steel in both eyelets and boning allowed wearers to lace their corsets significantly tighter without damaging the garment. 

Additionally, corsets were among the first garments to be mass-manufactured via assembly line. This increased the accessibility of high-quality corsets and meant that middle- and lower-class women could purchase corsets where before they may have worn corded &quot;jumps&quot;. Dress historian David Kunzle maintains that tightlacing was largely the domain of middle to lower middle class women hoping to increase their station in life; he estimates that the average corseted waist size of the 1880s was approximately , with an uncorseted waist size of about . 

In the late years of the Victorian era, medical reports and rumors claimed that tightlacing was fatally detrimental to health (see Victorian dress reform). Women who suffered to achieve small waists were also condemned for their vanity and excoriated from the pulpit as slaves to fashion. Dress reformers exhorted women to abandon the tyranny of stays and free their waists for work and healthy exercise, with an emphasis on the negative consequences to one&#x27;s reproductive system.

Despite the efforts of dress reformers to eliminate the corset, and despite medical and clerical warnings, women persisted in tightlacing, although a number of corsets were created that purported to alleviate effects on the wearers&#x27; bodies. By the 1910s and 20s, the corset had begun to fall out of fashion entirely, driven by both cultural and practical changes. The need for steel during World War I and World War II made corsets a luxury rather than a necessity. At the same time, first-wave feminism, the Artistic Dress movement, and the flapper subculture popularized less exaggerated silhouettes, and elasticated girdles and brassieres began to rise in popularity to create a less rigidly shaped figure. Although the structured, corseted wasp-waist made a resurgence after World War II in the form of the New Look, there was soon backlash with hippie culture; meanwhile, the rise of popular fitness culture meant that diet, liposuction, and exercise became the preferred methods of achieving a thin waist. Corsets were no longer fashionable, but they entered the underworld of the fetish, along with items such as bondage gear and vinyl catsuits, as well as alternative and runway fashions, as seen in the work of Vivienne Westwood or in the goth subculture. They are often worn as top garments rather than underwear. Historical reenactors often wear corsets, but few tightlace. 

== Process ==
Achieving extremely small waist sizes requires a long period of training with ever-smaller corsets, ideally during one&#x27;s pre-teen or teen years. A number of accounts of the corset training process take place under the regime of a finishing school, as achieving a very small waist was thought to make a woman appear refined and fashionable and thus increase the wearer&#x27;s ability to attract a suitable husband.

Although there was no standardized system of corset training, some contemporary accounts give us an idea of what this training period was like. Corsets were begun at whatever age one&#x27;s mother or female guardian felt was appropriate, which could be as young as seven or as old as 18 or 19. 

Corset makers themselves could also give a woman a regimen of increasingly smaller corsets:A common practice was to sleep with corsets still on, to prevent the waist from expanding again at night. To prevent girls from loosening or cutting the laces at night, different strategies were employed, such as using corporal punishment, tying an unusual knot that could not be replicated, fastening a padlock chain around the waist, or even, in one case, tying the child&#x27;s hands behind her back. However, some felt this method cruel and unnecessary, recommending a looser corset for nighttime or foregoing the nighttime corset completely. 

In 1895, The West Australian published an account purporting to be from the early 1860s, the diary of a student at an all-girls boarding school which described how their school madams trained girls to achieve waists ranging from to at a rate of a quarter-inch (.6 cm) per month. The narrator reports a reduction from to , and a subsequent interview with a corsetmaking firm corroborated that such sizes were not unusual during that period.

Another account from a &quot;fashionable school in London&quot; fondly recalls the practice as a source of rivalry and pride among schoolgirls in her youth, reporting a reduction of about one inch per month, ultimately achieving a waist of from her original .

Although most of these accounts describe adolescent girls, there are some sources which suggest that this process can take place at older ages, albeit with more difficulty. Many records of older women who tightlaced were induced to do so by their husbands, such as in the case of Ethel Granger, and had an element of sexual fetishism. The majority of people taking part in tightlacing were likely teenagers or young adults; the smallest waist sizes on record should be contextualized as such. 

Tightlacing appears to have been a source of great pride and at times pleasure for many practitioners. However, there were also many who protested or were totally unable to achieve significant reductions. In 1896, a fashion house employee reported that, of the shop girls who undertook the training process to achieve the desired waist size of , &quot;out of every 100 girls she found three could not lace at all, six laced with difficulty, eight eventually gave up, ten endured the bondage, seventy really enjoyed it, and three laced excessively.&quot; Dress historian David Kunzle theorized that some enthusiastic fans of tightlacing may have experienced sexual pleasure when tightlacing, or by rubbing against the front of the corset, which contributed to the moral outrage against the practice. Although such issues could not be discussed openly, many testimonials report feeling a pleasant numb or tingling sensation when tightlacing.

== Criticism ==
The practice of tightlacing drew criticism from a wide variety of groups. The practice was widely ridiculed in satirical sources such as newspaper cartoons, which depicted the practice as frivolous, harmful, and unattractive.

American women active in the anti-slavery and temperance movements, with experience in public speaking and political agitation, advocated for and wore sensible clothing that would not restrict their movement, although corsets were a part of their wardrobe. While supporters of fashionable dress contended that corsets maintained an upright, &quot;good figure&quot;, and were a necessary physical structure for a moral and well-ordered society, dress reformers maintained that women&#x27;s fashions were not only physically detrimental, but &quot;the results of male conspiracy to make women subservient by cultivating them in slave psychology&quot;. They believed a change in fashions could change the position of women in society, allowing for greater social mobility, independence from men and marriage, and the ability to work for wages, as well as physical movement and comfort.

Along with activists, many doctors spoke out against the practice. One Doctor Lewis writes in an 1882 edition of &quot;The North American Review&quot;:

This likely alluded to problems with the reproductive organs experienced by women who wore corsets, and demonstrates the difficulties of explaining this issue due to sexual taboos. 

This pushback led to a number of developments in the design of the corset. Because of the public health outcry surrounding corsets and tightlacing, some doctors took it upon themselves to become corsetieres. Many doctors helped to fit their patients with corsets to avoid the dangers of ill-fitting corsets, and some doctors even designed corsets themselves. Roxey Ann Caplin became a widely renowned corset maker, enlisting the help of her husband, a physician, to create corsets which she purported to be more respectful of human anatomy. Health corsets and &quot;rational corsets&quot; became popular alternatives to the boned corset. They included features such as wool lining, watch springs as boning, elastic paneling, and other features purported to be less detrimental to one&#x27;s health. The practice of training girls to tightlace at an early age seems to have completely fallen out of favor by the early 20th century, seen as a curiosity of a more foolish time.

<doc id="419952" wikidata="Q910704" url="?curid=419952" title="Calcium metabolism">
<text>Calcium metabolism is the movement and regulation of calcium ions (Ca2+) &quot;in&quot; (via the gut) and &quot;out&quot; (via the gut and kidneys) of the body, and &quot;between&quot; body compartments: the blood plasma, the extracellular and intracellular fluids, and bone. Bone acts as a calcium storage center for deposits and withdrawals as needed by the blood via continual bone remodeling. 
An important aspect of calcium metabolism is plasma calcium homeostasis, the regulation of calcium ions in the blood plasma within narrow limits. The level of the calcium in plasma is regulated by the hormones parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin. PTH is released by the chief cells of the parathyroid glands when the plasma calcium level falls below the normal range in order to raise it; calcitonin is released by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland when the plasma level of calcium is above the normal range in order to lower it.

== Body compartment content ==
Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body. The average adult body contains in total approximately 1 kg, 99% in the skeleton in the form of calcium phosphate salts. The extracellular fluid (ECF) contains approximately 22 mmol, of which about 9 mmol is in the plasma. Approximately 10 mmol of calcium is exchanged between bone and the ECF over a period of twenty-four hours.

==Blood concentration==

The concentration of calcium ions inside cells (in the intracellular fluid) is more than 7,000 times lower than in the blood plasma (i.e. at &lt;0.0002 mmol/L, compared with 1.4 mmol/L in the plasma)

=== Normal plasma levels ===
The plasma &quot;total calcium&quot; concentration is in the range of 2.2–2.6 mmol/L (9–10.5 mg/dL), and the normal &quot;ionized calcium&quot; is 1.3–1.5 mmol/L (4.5–5.6 mg/dL). The amount of total calcium in the blood varies with the level of plasma albumin, the most abundant protein in plasma, and therefore the main carrier of protein-bound calcium in the blood. The biologic effect of calcium is, however, determined by the amount of &quot;ionized calcium&quot;, rather than the total calcium. It is therefore the plasma ionized calcium level which is tightly regulated to remain within very narrow limits by homeostatic negative feedback systems.

Between 35 and 50% of the calcium in plasma is protein-bound, and 5–10% is in the form of complexes with organic acids and phosphates. The remainder (50–60%) is ionized. The ionized calcium can be determined directly by colorimetry, or it can be read off from nomograms, though the usefulness of the latter is limited when the pH and protein content of the plasma deviate widely from the normal.

== Function ==
Calcium has several main functions in the body.

===Bound to serum proteins===
It readily binds to proteins, particularly those with amino acids whose side chains terminate in carboxyl (-COOH) groups (e.g. glutamate residues). When such binding occurs the electrical charges on the protein chain change, causing the protein&#x27;s tertiary structure (i.e. 3-dimensional form) to change. Good examples of this are several of the clotting factors in the blood plasma, which are functionless in the absence of calcium ions, but become fully functional on the addition of the correct concentration of calcium salts.

===Voltage gated sodium channels===
The voltage gated sodium ion channels in the cell membranes of nerves and muscle are particularly sensitive to the calcium ion concentration in the plasma. Relatively small decreases in the plasma ionized calcium levels (hypocalcemia) cause these channels to leak sodium into the nerve cells or axons, making them hyper-excitable (positive bathmotropic effect), thus causing spontaneous muscle spasms (tetany) and paraesthesia (the sensation of &quot;pins and needles&quot;) of the extremities and round the mouth. When the plasma ionized calcium rises above normal (hypercalcemia) more calcium is bound to these sodium channels having a negative bathmotropic effect on them, causing lethargy, muscle weakness, anorexia, constipation and labile emotions.

===Intracellular signalling===
Because the intracellular calcium ion concentration is extremely low (see above) the entry of minute quantities of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum or from the extracellular fluids, cause rapid, very marked, and readily reversible changes in the relative concentration of these ions in the cytosol. This can therefore serve as a very effective intracellular signal (or &quot;second messenger&quot;) in a variety of circumstances, including muscle contraction, the release of hormones (e.g. insulin from the beta cells in the pancreatic islets) or neurotransmitters (e.g. acetylcholine from pre-synaptic terminals of nerves) and other functions.

=== Bone ===
Calcium acts structurally as supporting material in bones as calcium hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2).

=== Muscle ===
In skeletal and heart muscle, calcium ions, released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (the endoplasmic reticulum of striated muscles), bind to the troponin C protein present on the actin-containing thin filaments of the myofibrils. The troponin&#x27;s 3D structure changes as a result, causing the tropomyosin to which it is attached to be rolled away from the myosin-binding sites on the actin molecules that form the back-bone of the thin filaments. Myosin can then bind to the exposed myosin-binding sites on the thin filament, to undergo a repeating series of conformational changes called the cross-bridge cycle, for which ATP provides the energy. During the cycle, each myosin protein ‘paddles’ along the thin actin filament, repeatedly binding to myosin-binding sites along the actin filament, ratcheting and letting go. In effect, the thick filament moves or slides along the thin filament, resulting in muscle contraction. This process is known as the sliding filament model of muscle contraction.

== Sources ==
Not all the calcium in the diet can be readily absorbed from the gut. The calcium that is most readily absorbed is found in dairy products (72%), vegetables (7%), grains (5%), legumes (4%), fruit (3%), protein (3%). The calcium contained in vegetable matter is often complexed with phytates, oxalates, citrate and other organic acids, such as the long-chained fatty acids (e.g. palmitic acid), with which calcium binds to form insoluble calcium soaps.

=== Bone storage ===
Calcium flow to and from the bone may be positive, negative, or neutral. When it is neutral, about 5–10 mmol is turned over a day. Bone serves as an important storage point for calcium, as it contains 99% of the total body calcium. Calcium release from bone is regulated by parathyroid hormone in conjunction with calcitriol manufactured in the kidney under the influence of PTH. Calcitonin (a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland when plasma ionized calcium levels are high or rising; not to be confused with &quot;calcitriol&quot; which is manufactured in the kidney) stimulates incorporation of calcium into bone.

=== Intestinal absorption ===
The normal adult diet contains about 25 mmol of calcium per day. Only about 5 mmol of this is absorbed into the body per day (see below).

Calcium is absorbed across the intestinal epithelial cell&#x27;s brush border membrane. The TRPV6 channel was proposed to be the major player in intestinal Ca2+ uptake. However, &quot;Trpv6&quot; KO mice did not display significant reduction of serum calcium levels and showed only slightly reduced or even unchanged intestinal Ca2+ absorption, indicating that other absorption pathways must exist. Recently, TRPM7 was linked to intestinal calcium uptake. The authors could show that intestinal deletion of TRPM7 results in strongly reduced calcium levels in serum and bones, and intensively increased levels of calcitriol and PTH, indicating that TRPM7 is essential for the intestinal bulk uptake of calcium. After the cellular uptake, calcium is immediately bound to calbindin, a vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein. Calbindin transfers the calcium directly into the epithelial cell&#x27;s endoplasmic reticulum, through which the calcium is transferred to the basal membrane on the opposite side of the cell, without entering its cytosol or intracellular fluid. From there calcium pumps (PMCA1) actively transport calcium into the body. Active transport of calcium occurs primarily in the duodenum portion of the intestine when calcium intake is low; and through passive paracellular transport in the jejunum and ileum parts when calcium intake is high, independently of Vitamin D level.

The active absorption of calcium from the gut is regulated by the calcitriol (or 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol, or 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3) concentration in the blood. Calcitriol is a cholesterol derivative. Under the influence of ultraviolet light on the skin, cholesterol is converted to previtamin D3 which spontaneously isomerizes to vitamin D3 (or cholecalciferol). It is then converted from cholecalciferol to calcifediol in the liver. Under the influence of parathyroid hormone, the kidneys convert calcifediol into the active hormone calcitriol, which acts on the epithelial cells (enterocytes) lining the small intestine to increase the rate of absorption of calcium from the intestinal contents. In short the cycle is following:
:7-Dehydrocholesterol Previtamin D3 Vitamin D3 Calcifediol Calcitriol
Low PTH levels in the blood (which occur under physiological conditions when the plasma ionized calcium levels are high) inhibit the conversion of cholecalciferol into calcitriol, which in turn inhibits calcium absorption from the gut. The opposite happens when the plasma ionized calcium levels are low: parathyroid hormone is secreted into the blood and the kidneys convert more calcifediol into the active calcitriol, increasing calcium absorption from the gut.
== Reabsorption ==
=== Intestine ===
Since about 15 mmol of calcium is excreted into the intestine via the bile per day, the total amount of calcium that reaches the duodenum and jejunum each day is about 40 mmol (25 mmol from the diet plus 15 mmol from the bile), of which, on average, 20 mmol is absorbed (back) into the blood. The net result is that about 5 mmol more calcium is absorbed from the gut than is excreted into it via the bile. If there is no active bone building (as in childhood), or increased need for calcium during pregnancy and lactation, the 5 mmol calcium that is absorbed from the gut makes up for urinary losses that are only partially regulated.

=== Kidneys ===

The kidneys filter 250 mmol of calcium ions a day in pro-urine (or glomerular filtrate), and resorbs 245 mmol, leading to a net average loss in the urine of about 5 mmol/d. The quantity of calcium ions excreted in the urine per day is partially under the influence of the plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) level - high levels of PTH decreasing the rate of calcium ion excretion, and low levels increasing it. However, parathyroid hormone has a greater effect on the quantity of phosphate ions (HPO42−) excreted in the urine. Phosphates form insoluble salts in combination with calcium ions. High concentrations of HPO42− in the plasma, therefore, lower the ionized calcium level in the extra-cellular fluids. Thus, the excretion of more phosphate than calcium ions in the urine raises the plasma ionized calcium level, even though the total calcium concentration might be lowered.

The kidney influences the plasma ionized calcium concentration in yet another manner. It processes vitamin D3 into calcitriol, the active form that is most effective in promoting the intestinal absorption of calcium. This conversion of vitamin D3 into calcitriol, is also promoted by high plasma parathyroid hormone levels.
== Excretion ==
===Intestine===
Most excretion of excess calcium is via the bile and feces, because the plasma calcitriol levels (which ultimately depend on the plasma calcium levels) regulate how much of the biliary calcium is reabsorbed from the intestinal contents.

===Kidneys===
Urinary excretion of calcium is normally about 5 mmol (200 mg) /day. This is less in comparison to what is excreted via the feces (15 mmol/day).

== Regulation ==
The plasma ionized calcium concentration is regulated within narrow limits (1.3–1.5 mmol/L). This is achieved by both the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland, and the parathyroid glands constantly sensing (i.e. measuring) the concentration of calcium ions in the blood flowing through them.

=== High plasma level ===
When the concentration of calcium rises, the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland increase their secretion of calcitonin, a polypeptide hormone, into the blood. At the same time, the parathyroid glands reduce the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), also a polypeptide hormone, into the blood. The resulting high levels of calcitonin in the blood stimulate osteoblasts in bone to remove calcium from blood plasma and deposit it as bone.

The reduced levels of PTH inhibit removal of calcium from the skeleton. The low levels of PTH have several other effects: there is increased loss of calcium in the urine, but more importantly, the loss of phosphate ions through urine is inhibited. Phosphate ions will therefore be retained in the plasma where they form insoluble salts with calcium ions, thereby removing them from the ionized calcium pool in the blood. The low levels of PTH also inhibit the formation of calcitriol (not to be confused with calcitonin) from cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) by the kidneys.

The reduction in the blood calcitriol concentration acts (comparatively slowly) on the epithelial cells (enterocytes) of the duodenum, inhibiting their ability to absorb calcium from the intestinal contents. The low calcitriol levels also act on bone causing the osteoclasts to release fewer calcium ions into the blood plasma.
=== Low plasma level ===
When the plasma ionized calcium level is low or falls the opposite happens. Calcitonin secretion is inhibited and PTH secretion is stimulated, resulting in calcium being removed from bone to rapidly correct the plasma calcium level. The high plasma PTH levels inhibit calcium loss via the urine while stimulating the excretion of phosphate ions via that route. They also stimulate the kidneys to manufacture calcitriol (a steroid hormone), which enhances the ability of the cells lining the gut to absorb calcium from the intestinal contents into the blood, by stimulating the production of calbindin in these cells. The PTH stimulated production of calcitriol also causes calcium to be released from bone into the blood, by the release of RANKL (a cytokine, or local hormone) from the osteoblasts which increases the bone resorptive activity by the osteoclasts. These are, however, relatively slow processes

Thus fast short term regulation of the plasma ionized calcium level primarily involves rapid movements of calcium into or out of the skeleton. Long term regulation is achieved by regulating the amount of calcium absorbed from the gut or lost via the feces.

== Disorders ==
Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) and hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) are both serious medical disorders. Osteoporosis, osteomalacia and rickets are bone disorders linked to calcium metabolism disorders and effects of vitamin D. Renal osteodystrophy is a consequence of chronic kidney failure related to the calcium metabolism.

A diet adequately rich in calcium may reduce calcium loss from bone with advancing (post-menopausal) age. A low dietary calcium intake may be a risk factor in the development of osteoporosis in later life; and a diet with sustained adequate amounts of calcium may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.

== Research ==

The role that calcium might have in reducing the rates of colorectal cancer has been the subject of many studies. However, given its modest efficacy, there is no current medical recommendation to use calcium for cancer reduction.

<text>North Carolina Central University (NCCU or NC Central) is a public historically black university in Durham, North Carolina, United States. Founded by James E. Shepard in affiliation with the Chautauqua movement in 1909, it was supported by private funds from both Northern and Southern philanthropists. It was made part of the state system in 1923, when it first received state funding and was renamed as Durham State Normal School. It added graduate classes in arts and sciences and professional schools in law and library science in the late 1930s and 1940s.

In 1969 the legislature designated this a regional university and renamed it as North Carolina Central University. It has been part of the University of North Carolina system since 1972 and offers programs at the baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, professional, and doctoral levels. The university is a member of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.

==History==
North Carolina Central University was founded by James E. Shepard as the National Religious Training School and Chautauqua for the Colored Race in the Hayti District. Chautauqua was an educational movement that originated in the Northeast. The school was chartered in 1909 as a private institution and opened on July 5, 1910. Woodrow Wilson, the future U.S. president, contributed some private support for the school&#x27;s founding.

The school was sold and reorganized in 1915, becoming the National Training School; it was supported by Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage, a philanthropist of New York who was particularly concerned about education. (She founded the Russell Sage Foundation and made generous bequests to several schools.) The National Training School supported Black teacher development in the Jim Crow era, a time when Black education was underfunded by southern states at both the lower and upper levels. 

Becoming a state-funded institution in 1923, this school was renamed as Durham State Normal School for Negroes; normal schools trained teachers for elementary grades. In 1925, reflecting the expansion of its programs to a four-year curriculum with a variety of majors, the General Assembly converted the institution into the North Carolina College for Negroes, dedicating it to the offering of liberal arts education and the preparation of teachers and principals of secondary schools. It was the nation&#x27;s first state-supported liberal arts college for black students. To avoid the state Jim Crow system of segregated passenger cars on trains, Shepard insisted on traveling to Raleigh by car to lobby the legislature. The college&#x27;s first four-year class graduated in 1929.

The college was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools as an &quot;A&quot; class institution in 1937 and was admitted to membership in that association in 1957. Graduate courses in the School of Arts and Sciences were added in 1939, in the School of Law in 1940, and in the School of Library Science in 1941. A &quot;race relations conference&quot; was held at the college in July 1944.

In 1947, the General Assembly changed the name of the institution to North Carolina College at Durham. On October 6, 1947, Shepard, the founder and president, died. He was succeeded in 1948 by Alfonso Elder. At the time of Elder&#x27;s election he was serving as head of the Graduate Department of Education and had formerly been dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Elder retired September 1, 1963. Samuel P. Massie was appointed as the president on August 9, 1963, and resigned on February 1, 1966. On July 1, 1967, Albert N. Whiting assumed the presidency. He served as president and chancellor of the institution. Among the significant developments during his service was the creation of NCCU School of Business. Programs in public administration and criminal justice were also launched. Whiting retired June 30, 1983.

The 1969 General Assembly designated the institution as one of the State&#x27;s regional universities, and the name was changed to North Carolina Central University. Since 1972, NCCU has been a constituent institution of the University of North Carolina system. On July 1, 1972, the state&#x27;s four-year colleges and universities were joined to become The Consolidated University of North Carolina, with 16 individual campuses headed by a single president and governed by the University of North Carolina Board of Governors. However, each campus was led by a separate chancellor and a campus-specific board of trustees.

Whiting was succeeded by LeRoy T. Walker as chancellor, followed by Tyronza R. Richmond, Julius L. Chambers (who had previously been director-counsel (chief executive) of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund), James H. Ammons, Charlie Nelms, and Debra Saunders-White in 2013. Saunders-White was the first woman to hold the office on a permanent basis (Donna Benson was the first woman to serve as interim chancellor of the university). Saunders-White took a leave of absence in 2016, then provost, Johnson O. Akinleye, was appointed as acting chancellor. Following her death in November 2016, Akinleye became interim chancellor.

Johnson O. Akinleye was elected as the 12th chancellor of NCCU on June 26, 2017. In this position, Akinleye has worked to expand the university&#x27;s academic partnerships, including new agreements with community colleges, as well as introduced a robust online, distance-education program, NCCU Online. He also created K-12 initiatives and implemented a security strategy to increase safety for campus constituents.

==Campus==
The campus is located about a mile south of downtown Durham, North Carolina and about three miles east of Duke University. Eleven buildings built before 1940 are included in a national historic district. All of the buildings, except for the three residences, are Georgian Revival-style buildings; they have contemporary fireproof construction with steel trusses and brick exterior walls. They include the James E. Shepard Administration Building, Alexander Dunn Hall, Annie Day Shepard Hall, and five institutional buildings built in the late 1930s under the auspices of the Public Works Administration. The campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

==Organization==
NCCU is a part of the University of North Carolina (UNC) System. The campus is governed by a thirteen-member Board of Trustees: eight elected, four appointed, and the president of the Student Government Association also serves as an ex-officio member. The Board elects its officers annually and meets five times per year.

<text>The Nue (鵺, 鵼, 恠鳥, or 奴延鳥) is a legendary yōkai or mononoke from Japanese mythology.

==Appearance==
In the &quot;Tale of Heike&quot;, it is described as a Japanese Chimera having the head of a monkey, the limbs of a tiger, the body of a Japanese raccoon dog, and the front half of a snake for a tail. In other writings nothing is stated about its torso, so it is sometimes depicted to have the torso of a tiger. The &quot;Genpei Jōsuiki&quot; describes it as having the back of a tiger, the limbs of a tanuki, the tail of a fox, the head of a cat, and the torso of a chicken.

It is said to make terribly eerie bird cry &quot;hyoo hyoo&quot; noises that resemble that of the scaly thrush. In the movie &quot;Akuryōtō&quot; (originally by Seishi Yokomizo), the catchphrase &quot;nights where the nue cry are dreadful&quot; refers to this fact. The nue is also said to have the ability of shape-shifting, often into the form of a black cloud that can fly. The yokai is also thought to be nocturnal as most of its sightings happen at night. Its name written in kanji translates to &quot;night&quot; and &quot;bird&quot;.

==History==
The nue is thought to have started appearing in the late Heian period. For a more precise dating, different sources claim different periods, like the Emperor Nijō period, the Emperor Konoe period, the Emperor Go-Shirakawa period, or the Emperor Toba period.

The visual appearance may be a combination of the animals in the Sexagenary cycle, with a northeast Tiger, a southeast Snake, a southwest Monkey, and a northwest Qian (Dog and Wild Boar).

Originally, the nue were stated to be a bird that resembles the green pheasant, but their precise identity is unknown. The 夜 within the 鵺 character is phonetic component and thus does not carry a meaning with it. The character 鵼 (kou or kuu) is determined to be a kind of strange bird. Due to the use of Man&#x27;yōgana, the historical spelling is known to have been &quot;nuye&quot;. At this early time, although, it had a different semantic meaning. It referred to a bird known as White&#x27;s thrush.

In Japan, they are considered a bird that makes cries at night, and the word can be seen in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;. The owner of this crying voice was traditionally described as a yellow-red bird as big as a Columbidae, but nowadays there is the accepted theory that it is the scaly thrush. Since the people of the Heian Period regarded the sorrowful sounding voices of this bird as an ill omen, they were considered to be a wicked bird,
and it is said that when the emperor or nobles heard its crying voice, they would make prayers that nothing disastrous would happen.

The monster in the &quot;Heike Monogatari&quot;, in the end, was merely &quot;something that cries with the voice of a nue, its true nature unknown&quot;, and was not given a name. But nowadays, this particularly famous monster is usually identified as a &quot;nue&quot;.

In a derived sense the word &quot;nue&quot; is also used to refer to entities of unknown true form.

The noh play &quot;Nue&quot;, by Zeami Motokiyo, based on the setsuwa, the Heike Monogatari. They are a regular feature of the Kiri-noh (fifth performance of a noh).

Nue-harai Matsuri (&quot;Nue-warding festival&quot;) – a festival performed every year on January 28 at the Izunagaoka Onsen in Izunokuni, Shizuoka Prefecture. Among other things the &quot;nue-odori&quot; (nue-dance) and the &quot;mochi-maki&quot; (mochi-scattering) are performed.

At Osaka Harbor, the Nue is used as a motif in its emblem design. From the legend of Nuezuka, it was selected for its relation to Osaka bay.

==The slaying of the Nue==
The &quot;Heike Monogatari&quot; and the &quot;Settsu Meisho Zue&quot; from the Settsu Province, tell the following tale of the killing of the Nue:

In the closing years of the Heian period, at the place where the emperor (Emperor Konoe) lived, the Seiryō-den, there appeared a cloud of black smoke along with an eerie resounding crying voice, making Emperor Nijō quite afraid. Subsequently, the emperor fell into illness, and neither medicine nor prayers had any effect.

A close associate remembered Minamoto no Yoshiie using an arrow to put a stop to the mystery case of some bird&#x27;s cry, and he gave the order to a master of arrows, Minamoto no Yorimasa, to slay the monster.

One night, Yorimasa went out to slay the monster with his servant Ino Hayata (written as 猪早太 or 井早太), and an arrow made from an arrowhead he had inherited from his ancestor Minamoto no Yorimitsu and the tailfeathers of a mountain bird. An uncanny black smoke started to cover the Seiryō-den. Yorimasa shot his arrow into it, there was a shriek, and a nue fell down around the northern parts of Nijō Castle. Instantly Ino Hayata seized it and finished it off.

In the skies above the imperial court, two or three cries of the common cuckoo could be heard, and it is thus said that peace had returned. After this, the emperor&#x27;s health instantly recovered, and Yorimasa was given the sword &quot;Shishiō&quot; as a reward.

==The Nue&#x27;s remains==
There are several accounts of what was done to the nue&#x27;s corpse. According to some legends, like the &quot;Heike Monogatari&quot;, as the people in Kyoto were fearful of the curse of the nue, they put its corpse in a boat and floated it down the Kamo River. After the boat floated down the Yodo River and temporarily drifted upon the shore of Higashinari County, Osaka, it then floated into the sea and washed up on the shore between Ashiya River and Sumiyoshi River. It is said that the people in Ashiya courteously gave the corpse a burial service, and built a commemorating mound over its tomb, the &quot;Nuezuka&quot;. The &quot;Settsu Meisho Zue&quot; states that &quot;the Nuezuka is between Ashiya River and Sumiyoshi River.&quot;

According to the &quot;Ashiwake bune&quot;, a geography book from the Edo period, a nue drifted down and washed ashore on the Yodo River, and when the villagers, fearful of a curse, notified the head priest of Boon-ji about it, it was courteously mourned over, buried, and had a mound built for it. It is further said that as the mound was torn down at the beginning of the Meiji period, the vengeful spirit of the nue started tormenting the people who lived nearby, and so the mound was hastily rebuilt.

According to the &quot;Genpei Seisuiki&quot; and the &quot;Kandenjihitsu&quot; the nue was said to be buried at the Kiyomizu-dera in Kyoto Prefecture, and it is said that a curse resulted from digging it up in the Edo period.

Another legend relates the spirit of the dead nue turning into a horse, which was raised by Yorimasa and named Kinoshita. As this horse was a good horse, it was stolen by Taira no Munemori, so Yorimasa raised an army against the Taira family. As this resulted in Yorimasa&#x27;s ruin, it is said that the nue had taken its revenge in this way.

Another legend says that the nue&#x27;s corpse fell in the western part of Lake Hamana in Shizuoka Prefecture, and the legend of the names of places in Mikkabi of Hamana-ku, Hamamatsu, such as Nueshiro, Dozaki (&quot;torso&quot;-zaki), Hanehira (&quot;wing&quot;-hira), and Ona (&quot;tail&quot;-na) come from the legend that the nue&#x27;s head, torso, wings, and tail respectively fell in those locations.

In Kumakōgen, Kamiukena District, Ehime Prefecture, there is the legend that the true identity of the nue is Yorimasa&#x27;s mother. In the past, in the era when the Taira clan was at its peak, Yorimasa&#x27;s mother lived in hiding in this place that was her home land, and at a pond called Azoga-ike within a mountains region, she prayed to the guardian dragon of the pond for her son&#x27;s good fortune in battle and the revival of the Genji (Minamoto clan), and thus the mother&#x27;s body turned into that of a nue due to this prayer and hatred against the Taira family, and then she flew towards Kyoto. The nue, who represented the mother, upon making the emperor ill, thus had her own son, Yorimasa, accomplish something triumphant by being slayed by him. The nue that was pierced by Yorimasa&#x27;s arrow then came back to Azoga-ike and became the guardian of the pond, but lost her life due to wounds from the arrow.

==Landmarks==
* Nuezuka (Near Hashin Ashiya Station, at Matsuhama Park, Hyōgo Prefecture)
: The mound where the nue that floated down the river in the &quot;Heike Monogatari&quot; was buried. The name of a nearby bridge, the Nuezuka-bashi originated from this Nuezuka.
* Nuezuka (Miyakojima-ku, Osaka)
: The mound where the nue that floated down Yado river in the &quot;Ashiwakebune&quot; was buried. The present mound was, as previously described, repaired in 1870 by Osaka Prefecture, and the small shrine was repaired in 1957 by the locals.
* Nuezuka (Kyoto Prefecture)
: Near the athletic field at Okazaki park. It is unknown how this is related to the legend of how the nue was buried at the Kiyomizu-deru in Kyoto.
* Nue pond (Kyoto Prefecture)
: A pond at Nijō park, Chikara Town, Kamigyō-ku to the northwest of Nijō Castle. It is said that in this pond Yorimasa washed the blood-smeared arrow that went through the nue and killed it. Presently, the remains of this pond has been remodeled into a water garden.
* Shinmei-jinja
: Shimogyō-ku, Kyoto. It is said that Yorimasa made a prayer here before killing the nue and subsequently donated the head of the lethal arrow as thanks. The arrowhead is kept as the treasure of the shrine. A photo is permanently exhibited, with the actual arrowhead shown to the public during an annual festival in September.
* Yane-jizō
: Kameoka, Kyoto Prefecture. When Yorimasa prepared to kill the nue, he offered a prayer to his proctive god, Jizō Bodhisattva. Jizō promptly appeared in his dream and instructed him to make an arrow with the feathers of swans at Mt. Tori in Yada. Related to this legend, Jizō has the appearance of holding an arrowhead, but it is usually not exhibited to the public.
* Chōmyō-ji
: Nishiwaki, Hyōgo Prefecture. This land was originally the territory of Yorimasa. The temple features a statue of Yorimasa killing the nue. The nearby bamboo grove &quot;Ya-takeyabu&quot; (lit. &quot;arrow bamboo grove&quot;) is said to be the place where Yorimasa picked the bamboo used for the lethal arrow.
Other than these, in Beppu, Ōita Prefecture, it is said that there was a mummy of the nue in a theme park, the &quot;Monster House (Kaibutsu-kan)&quot; at the Hachiman Jigoku (one of the no-longer presently existing hot springs at the Hells of Beppu), and it was also said to be a precious treasure without parallel, but this theme park no longer presently exists, and the mummy&#x27;s present whereabouts are unclear.

<text>Andrés de Jesús María y José Bello López (; November 29, 1781 – October 15, 1865) was a Venezuelan humanist, diplomat, poet, legislator, philosopher, educator and philologist, whose political and literary works constitute an important part of Spanish American culture. Bello is featured on the old 2,000 Venezuelan bolívar and the 20,000 Chilean peso notes.

In Caracas, where he was born, Andrés Bello was Simón Bolívar&#x27;s teacher for a short period of time and participated in efforts that led to Venezuelan independence. As a diplomat for the new independent government that he helped establish, he went with Luis López Méndez and Simón Bolívar on their first diplomatic mission to London. He lived in London from 1810 to 1829.

In 1829, Bello went with his family to Chile. He was hired by the Chilean government and made great works in the field of law and humanities. In Santiago he held positions as a senator and a professor, as well as directing several local newspapers. As a legislator, he was the main promoter and editor of the Chilean Civil Code, one of the most innovative and influential American legal works of his time. In 1842, under his inspiration and with his decisive support, the University of Chile was created, an institution of which he became the first rector, staying in the post for more than two decades. Due to his great contributions, on 17 October 1832 he was given Chilean nationality through a law approved by the Congress.

==Biographical information==
=== Life in Venezuela (1781-1810) ===
Bello was born in Caracas and grew up studying at the academy of Ramón Vanlonsten. He was the first son of the lawyer don Bartolomé Bello and Ana Antonia López, whose parents descended from residents of the Canary Islands. He also frequented the Convent of las Mercedes, where he studied Latin under Father Cristobal de Quesada. After the monk&#x27;s death in 1796, Bello translated Book V of the Aeneid.

He studied Liberal Arts, Law and Medicine at the University of Caracas and graduated on May 9, 1800, with a degree of Bachelor of Arts. As well as having unfinished studies in law and medicine, he also learned English and French on his own. He gave private classes, with the young Simón Bolívar among his students. His translations and adaptations of classic texts gave him prestige, and in 1802 won, by contest, the rank of officer Second Secretary of the colonial government. During the period 1802–1810, Bello became one of the most intellectually influential people in the society of Caracas, standing in performing political work for the colonial administration, besides gaining notoriety as a poet, translating the tragedy &quot;Zulima&quot; by Voltaire. He later became known for his early writings and translations, edited the newspaper &quot;Gazeta de Caracas&quot; and held important offices in the government of the Captaincy General of Venezuela. He accompanied Alexander von Humboldt in a part of his Latin American expedition (1800) and was for a short time Simón Bolívar&#x27;s teacher. His relationships with both men became a major factor in cultivating his ideas for his intellectual career.

Bello spent ten years after his formal education in his homeland of Caracas. He authored two literary works, &quot;Calendario manual y guía universal del forastero en Venezuela para el año de 1810&quot; and the &quot;Resumen de la historia de Venezuela&quot;.

Both works became widely accepted in Venezuela, and from this point Bello started his career as a poet. As time progressed, Bello further expanded his notions on humanism and conservatism. From his theories and ideas, Bello was eventually hailed as one of the foremost humanists of his time.

On April 19, 1810, Bello participated in events that helped to spark the independence of Venezuela, including the dismissal of Captain General Vicente Emparan by the Cabildo de Caracas. The Supreme Junta of Caracas, the institution that governed the Captaincy General of Venezuela following the forced resignation of Emparan, and immediately named Bello First Officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On June 10 of that year, he set sail on a diplomatic mission to London as a representative of the new Republic. He was commissioned, together with Simón Bolívar and Luis López Méndez, to obtain British support for the cause of independence. Bello was chosen for his knowledge and command of the English language, which he had acquired predominantly on his own.

===Life in Britain (1810-1829)===

As First Officer of Venezuela&#x27;s Foreign Secretariat after the coup on April 19, 1810, he was sent to London with Simón Bolívar and Luis López Méndez serving as Diplomatic Representative to procure funds for the revolutionary effort until 1813. Bello landed at Portsmouth as an attaché to Bolívar&#x27;s mission in July 1810. Bello had an admittedly hard life throughout his stay in England, though he managed to further develop his ideas and took a particular interest in England&#x27;s social changes from the industrial and agricultural revolution. In order to earn a living while in London, Bello taught Spanish and tutored Lord Hamilton&#x27;s children. In London, he met Francisco de Miranda and became a frequent visitor of his library in Grafton Way, as well as of the British Museum. Along with Bello, Bolívar and López also became friends with Miranda and used their opportunity to become known thanks to Miranda&#x27;s accomplishments. During his lengthy stay in England, he curbed his feelings of homesickness and became contemporaries with thinkers and intellectuals such as José María Blanco White, Bartólome José Gallardo, Vicente Rocafuerte to name a few. He stayed in London for nineteen years acting as a secretary to legations and diplomatic affairs for Chile and Colombia. In his free time he was involved in study, teaching and journalism.
An English Heritage blue plaque commemorates Bello at 58 Grafton Way, his Fitzrovia address.

In 1812, Andrés Bello suffered economically as he tried to return home to Venezuela. The earthquake that occurred March 26, 1812, prevented Bello&#x27;s family from helping him financially in his return. The fall of the First Republic ended the mode of financial support he received from Latin America and the arrest of Francisco de Miranda did not make any thing better.

In 1814, Andrés Bello married Mary Ann Boyland, a 20-year-old Englishwoman. They had three children, (1815–1854), Francisco Bello Boyland (1817–1845), and Juan Pablo Antonio Bello Boyland (1820–1821). His family situation was constantly affected by his financial situation forcing him to always find new work. He worked for the government of Cundinamarca in 1815 and the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata the following year. In 1821, his wife died of tuberculosis and shortly after his son, Juan Pablo died as well.

In 1823, Bello published the with Juan Garcia del Rio which was widely hailed in Europe. 
Their collaboration included a reform of Spanish orthography that became official in several Spanish American countries, most lastingly in Chile.
In 1826 he published the journal &quot;Repertorio Americano&quot; to which he frequently contributed as both editor and poet. His two epic poems by which he was made famous, entitled , were originally published during his time in London around 1826 and documented the emerging culture of the New World. The second of the poems is the most famous of the two, and is a poetic description of South America&#x27;s tropical lands in a style reminiscent of Virgil, a poet of great influence for Bello. His situation temporarily got better in 1822 when Antonio José de Irisarri, a Chilean minister in London, named Bello interim secretary of the legation.

On February 24, 1824, Bello remarried Isabel Antonia Dunn, with whom he had 12 children (three born in London and the rest in Chile). Bello was able to become interim secretary again but for Colombia and took charge on February 7, 1825. This job was not what he expected as he was paid irregularly due to the financial crisis in Latin America.

In December 1826, Bello wrote a letter to Bolívar asking him to help out with his financial situation in London. Not only did he write because of his economic crisis, but because he believed that his friendship with Bolívar had disappeared. In April 1827, Bello wrote to Bolívar again but his situation did not get any better. Their friendship eventually came to an end when Bolívar gave Bello&#x27;s position to someone else and Bello had to find another job.

In 1828, the government of Chile offered Bello a job in the Ministry of Finance and on February 14, 1829, he finally left the United Kingdom.
=== Life in Chile (1829-1865) ===

In 1829 he accepted a post in the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Santiago, Chile under the administration of Chilean minister Diego Portales. While a surprising candidate considering his Venezuelan birth, he gladly accepted the post and was later named Senator of Santiago. As Senator, Bello founded the University of Chile in 1843 and held a position as Rector for the remainder of his life. Until his death at the age of eighty-three, Bello worked tirelessly to train the young minds of the new republic. Such brilliant thinkers and writers as José Victorino Lastarria and Francisco Bilbao were influenced by their time with Bello.

The , or &quot;Castilian Grammar Intended for the Use by Americans&quot; (&quot;Americans&quot; referring to Castilian- or Spanish-speaking inhabitants of the Americas), finished in 1847, was the first Spanish-American Grammar, with many original contributions, a product of long years of study. Republished over the years with many revisions, the most significant of which are by Rufino José Cuervo, this is still a valuable reference work. Bello was accepted in the Royal Spanish Academy as Correspondent Member in 1861.

<doc id="419977" wikidata="Q6590175" url="?curid=419977" title="Master of Social Work">
<text>The Master of Social Work (MSW) is a master&#x27;s degree in the field of social work. It is a professional degree with specializations compared to Bachelor of Social Work (BSW). MSW promotes macro-, mezzo- and micro-aspects of professional social work practice, whereas the BSW focuses more on direct social work practices in community, hospitals (outpatient and inpatient services) and other fields of social services. In some countries, such as Australia, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong SAR, some MSW degrees are considered equivalent to BSW qualifications as a qualifying degree.

== Canada ==
In Canada, the MSW is considered a professional master&#x27;s degree and is offered through several universities. Most schools are accredited by the Canadian Association for Social Work Education (CASWE).

All students entering an MSW program are required to have a recognized bachelor&#x27;s degree in a related field. Generally, students with a Bachelor of Social Work would enroll in a one-year program, whereas those with other undergraduate degrees (Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, etc.) would enroll in a two-year program. In Canada, the average Master of Social Work graduate can earn anywhere from C$60,000 to C$150,000, depending on their role and work environment.

The oldest social work program in Canada is offered at the University of Toronto through the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work. Social work students at the UofT choose from a number of specializations (gerontology; children and their families; mental health and health; human service management and leadership; and social justice and diversity), with opportunities to pursue a variety of collaborative programs, such as Addiction Studies, Sexual Diversity Studies, and Community Development, to name a few. Students could also pursue their MSW degrees in combination with either a Master of Health Science or a Juris Doctor degree.

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, clinical social work could first be studied in academia as part of a certificate program beginning in 1908. Later, two and three year programs were introduced. The Tavistock Clinic in London remains the leading centre for the study of clinically oriented social work and offers programmes up to and including Professional Doctorate level. The Journal of Social Work Practice represents the main organ of research and scholarly output in this area in the UK.

== United States ==
In the United States, MSW degrees must be received from a graduate school that has been approved by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) should the graduate seek future licensure. The MSW typically requires two years of full-time graduate study in combination with two years (900–1200 cumulative hours) of internship, also referred to as field practicum, education, or experience. While some students obtain a Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) before pursuing a master&#x27;s, most MSW programs accept applicants with undergraduate degrees in a broad range of liberal arts fields. Some MSW programs provide BSW graduates with an advanced standing option, allowing them to complete an MSW in a shorter period of time (typically one year).

Most MSW programs allow students to choose a clinical or direct practice track, which focuses on direct practice with clients, or a macro practice track, with a focus on political advocacy, community organizing, policy analysis and/or human services management. While the clinical track tends to be more popular, there has been a resurgence in community practice concentrations recently. There are also opportunities at many universities to obtain joint degrees, such as an MSW and a Public Administration degree, MSW and Public Health, or MSW and Law. The MSW practice scope has broadened in recent years to include the specialty practice areas of geriatrics and work with veterans. In some schools the curriculum is based on a generalist model which integrates the facets of the various practice areas within social work.

The MSW is considered a terminal practice degree in the field of social work. The DSW (Doctorate of Social Work) and PhD in social work are the final degrees offered in the field of social work. There are inherent differences between the DSW and the PhD; the DSW further develops skills to continue practice with individual clients and client systems in the field. The PhD prepares graduates to conduct research and teach in institutions of higher education. The &quot;Master&#x27;s Degree&quot; earned as part of the completion of a PhD in Social Work is not comparable to the Master of Social Work used in practice and to seek licensure. There are few DSW programs available in the United States.

Top-ranked institutions, such as the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor, Case Western Reserve University, Ohio State University–Columbus, University of Denver, University of Connecticut, and Howard University are investing in, and driving this initiative, making MSW curriculum more accessible to students via online delivery platforms.

Though Master of Social Work is by far the most common degree title used by graduate social work schools in the United States, it is not universal. For example, Columbia University School of Social Work offers an M.S. degree in social work, the School of Social Service Administration of the University of Chicago confers an A.M. degree, and the University of Texas confers the MSSW (Master of Science in Social Work) degree. The Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University confers the MSSA (Master of Science in Social Administration) degree. The UC Berkeley School of Social Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley and the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles both confer the Master of Social Welfare degree, an MSW comparable to the Master of Social Work.

Clark Atlanta University&#x27;s Whitney M. Young School of Social work is also credited with creating the administration of social work from an Afro-centric perspective. Clark Atlanta&#x27;s school of social work has also had various stalwarts in the profession affiliated with it such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Dorcas Bowles, Whitney Young, Hattie Mitchell, Naomi Ward and Rufus Lynch.

=== Employment outlook and opportunities U.S. ===
Although it is possible to be a social worker with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in the U.S., some fields of practice require a master&#x27;s degree. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the profession is expected to grow by 25% between 2010 and 2020. The growing elderly population is resulting in accelerated job growth among gerontology social workers. Social workers with a focus on mental health and substance use are currently in high demand as offenders are directed to treatment instead of jail time, a trend that is expected to continue. A master&#x27;s degree could be seen as a tool which will help to compete with tomorrow&#x27;s job market. The Employment Projection shows that those with higher levels of education in the field tend to earn more than those with just a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

The median annual salary for social workers according to the 2016 Bureau of Labor Statistics was $46,890, or $22.54 hourly. Between the years 2016 and 2026, the job outlook is projected to increase by 16%, which is 9% higher than the national job growth average. Average salaries will vary depending on the specific field of social work itself. Those who seek employment as social workers in the healthcare industry typically average the highest salaries, ranging between $54,141-$65,489. By obtaining a license in the field of clinical social work, the salary ranges from $40,494 to $76,205 according to PayScale.

Social workers&#x27; earnings varied according to their area of specialization and work environment:

<doc id="419980" wikidata="Q982506" url="?curid=419980" title="Imadaddin Nasimi">
<text>Seyid Ali Imadaddin Nasimi (; ), commonly known as simply Nasimi (), was a 14th- and 15th-century Hurufi poet who composed poetry in his native Azerbaijani, as well as Persian and Arabic languages. He is regarded as one of the greatest Turkic poets of his time and one of the most prominent figures in Azerbaijani literature. Some sources also mention that he was born in Baghdad in 1339.

Born around 1369–70, Nasimi received a good education and was drawn to Sufism at an early age. After becoming a faithful adherent of the Hurufism movement, Nasimi left Azerbaijan to spread Hurufism in Anatolia and later Aleppo following the execution of its founder and Nasimi&#x27;s teacher, Fazlallah Astarabadi. In Aleppo, he gained followers as a Hurufi sheikh but faced resistance from Sunni circles who eventually convinced the Mamluk sultan to order his death for his religious beliefs around 1418–19. Nasimi was executed and buried in a Sufi lodge () in Aleppo.

His surviving works include two (collections of poems) in Azerbaijani and Persian, along with some poems in Arabic. Nasimi&#x27;s poems mainly centre around Hurufism and contain many references to Islamic texts. His poetry combines harmonious melodies and easily understood expressions with more complex topics related to religion. Nasimi had great influence on Turkic literature and influenced many major future poets such as Habibi, Haqiqi (pen name of Jahan Shah), Khatai (pen name of Ismail I), among others. He is also considered the founder of Azerbaijani classical poetry (poetry using quantifying prosody) and poetry (a form of love poetry), as well as the first lyric poet in Oghuz Turkic classic literature.

== Name ==
Nasimi&#x27;s given name was Ali, but he adopted the epithet (&quot;laqab&quot;) Imadaddin (&#x27;Pillar of Faith&#x27;), which superseded his original name in use. Some sources attribute other names to him, such as Nesîmüddin, Celâleddin and Ömer.

His most prevalent pen name was Nasimi. Its etymology is disputed but most plausibly explained as an echo of Naimi, the pen name of Nasimi&#x27;s teacher Fazlallah Astarabadi. It may also have been derived from the Arabic word , meaning &#x27;breeze, breath of wind&#x27;. He also employed other pen names sporadically, such as Hüseyni, Haşimi, Seyyid, Ali and İmad. His epithet Imadaddin or the title &quot;seyid&quot; (marking his claim of descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad) are often added in order to distinguish him from other figures who also bore the name Nasimi.

== Biography ==
Much of Nasimi&#x27;s life is considered obscure. His year of birth is uncertain, but it is commonly assumed to be 1369–70 without conclusive evidence. His exact birthplace is also contested: it has been argued as Shamakhi, Tabriz, Baghdad, Aleppo, Shiraz or Diyarbakır. He was of Azerbaijani Turkic origin and spoke Azerbaijani as his native language, as well as fluent Persian and Arabic.

Nasimi had a good education as a child and pursued Sufism at an early age. While in Tabriz, he met the mystic Fazlallah Astarabadi, who introduced him to Hurufism. Nasimi stayed with him in Baku and Shirvan for some time and became one of the most faithful adherents of the Hurufism movement, as well as Astarabadi&#x27;s successor (khalifa). After the Timurid emperor Miran Shah executed Astarabadi for his religious views, Nasimi left Azerbaijan and travelled to Anatolia to spread Hurufism. He arrived in Bursa during Murad I&#x27;s (1362–1389) reign but was not welcomed there. He also attempted to meet the Sufi saint Haji Bayram Veli in Ankara but was turned away because of his Hurufi beliefs.

Unable to find a suitable environment for his beliefs in Anatolia, he went to Aleppo, which was the main centre of Hurufis in Syria at that time. Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani wrote about Nasimi&#x27;s activity in Aleppo as a Hurufi sheikh and his increasing followers. He used his poetry skills to further spread his beliefs. His ideas, such as &quot;the human face being the manifestation of God&quot; and &quot;describing all the body organs with letters&quot; faced resistance in Sunni circles. In Aleppo, Nasimi continued to fight for freedom of expression through his poetry, challenging strict rules and religious intolerance. Some contemporary Arab sources say that a group of Sunni Muslim scholars who followed the main schools of law tried to get Nasimi killed by the Mamluk deputy of Aleppo based on vague rumours, but they failed. The deputy then reportedly referred the case to the Mamluk sultan Al-Mu&#x27;ayyad Shaykh (1412–1421) in Cairo, who ordered Nasimi&#x27;s death, likely due to his religious beliefs; Nasimi is sometimes referred to as a &quot;kafir&quot;, or unbeliever. According to the Turkologist Michael Hess, while some sources claim that Nasimi was killed by being flayed alive, there is no clear evidence of this in contemporary sources. Some texts do mention flaying, but it may have been done posthumously for the purpose of public display. The most likely year of execution is 1418–9, although some historians suggest 1417 and other dates have also been proposed. Nasimi&#x27;s body was buried in a (Sufi lodge) named after him in Aleppo.

Nasimi&#x27;s execution is believed to have had a political component due to his Turkic ancestry, which brought him closer to Mamluks&#x27; rival Turkic dynasties in Syria and Anatolia. According to Hess, Al-Mu&#x27;ayyad&#x27;s order to distribute pieces of Nasimi&#x27;s body to local Turkic rulers like the Dulkadir and the Aq Qoyunlu was motivated by politics.

== Poetry ==

Nasimi&#x27;s surviving works include two (collections of poems), one in Azerbaijani and the other in Persian. Although the 16th-century Ottoman poet and bibliographer Latifî claimed that Nasimi had a &quot; in all three languages&quot;, implying the existence of an Arabic as well, no evidence of such a work has been found. His Azerbaijani contains over four hundred (a form of love poetry) and several hundred other poems, including (a poem written in rhyming couplets) and quatrains (a four-line poem). According to the Turkologist Kathleen Burrill, Nasimi was able to maintain the quality of his Azerbaijani language in his poetry while using the form (poetry using quantifying prosody). This sets him apart from later poets who relied heavily on borrowing from Persian because of what Burrill described as their &quot;lack of skill&quot; in mastering the form. His Persian consists of almost three hundred and discusses topics such as Hurufism, praise to Twelve Imams and Imam Ali, as well as Fazlallah Astarabadi.

Nasimi&#x27;s writing style often involves repeating sounds and grammatical patterns. His poems mainly centre around Hurufism and contain many references to Islamic texts such as the Quran. However, some of the beliefs behind his poems fall outside of mainstream Islam. Michael Hess states that Nasimi&#x27;s poetry blends easily comprehensible language with more intricate themes related to Hurufism. Hess also notes that while Fuzuli&#x27;s poems have remained popular due to their emotional depth and technical proficiency, the concepts behind them are not as widely understood. Burrill notes that some of Nasimi&#x27;s poems can be difficult to read due to their complex religious references, when this is not the case, they convey his themes of love through &quot;easy-flowing, harmonious melodies&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Nasimi is considered one of the greatest figures of Turkic literature. According to the modern scholar Sakina Berengian, Nasimi was the first major poet not only in Azerbaijani literature but also in all of Turkic literature. His influence on poetry extended throughout the Turkic world and impacted major poets such as Habibi, Haqiqi (pen name of Jahan Shah), Khatai (pen name of Ismail I), and others. Nasimi is also regarded as the founder of Azerbaijani classical poetry, poetry, as well as the first lyric poet in Oghuz Turkic classic literature. His works had a significant impact on the development of both Azerbaijani and Ottoman literature. Nasimi&#x27;s style has greatly influenced the general style of Azerbaijani poetry. According to the professors of Turkish literature Azmi Bilgin and İlyas Üzüm, the Timurid poet Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i&#x27;s words of praise about Nasimi show that he was also considered an &quot;important personality in the Central Asian Turkic world&quot;.

In 1973, UNESCO declared the 600th anniversary of Nasimi&#x27;s birth to be celebrated worldwide. Representatives from many countries participated in the celebrations held in Baku and Moscow. Tokay Mammadov was commissioned to create Nasimi&#x27;s statue. Due to the short time frame for completion, Tokay Mammadov collaborated with his colleague Ibrahim Zeynalov. Initially, a 69-centimeter model and a 2-meter mock-up of the statue were prepared. Subsequently, based on this mock-up, a 6.5-meter statue of Nasimi was created and installed in one of the central gardens of the city. In Azerbaijan, 2019 was declared the &quot;Year of Nasimi&quot; to commemorate the 650th anniversary of the poet&#x27;s birth. A street, a metro station, and a district in Baku are also named after Nasimi. The National Institute of Linguistics of Azerbaijan is also named in his honour. Additionally, there is a 1973 Azerbaijani biopic film about his life.

In 2019, an asteroid that was discovered at Kleť Observatory in 1995 was named &quot;32939 Nasimi&quot; in honour of the poet.

<doc id="419981" wikidata="Q1801229" url="?curid=419981" title="Epiphysis">
<text>An epiphysis (; : epiphyses) is one of the rounded ends or tips of a long bone that ossify from one or more secondary centers of ossification. Between the epiphysis and diaphysis (the long midsection of the long bone) lies the metaphysis, including the epiphyseal plate (growth plate). During formation of the secondary ossification center, vascular canals (epiphysial canals) stemming from the perichondrium invade the epiphysis, supplying nutrients to the developing secondary centers of ossification. At the joint, the epiphysis is covered with articular cartilage; below that covering is a zone similar to the epiphyseal plate, known as bone. The epiphysis is mostly found in mammals but it is also present in some lizards. However, the secondary center of ossification may have evolved multiple times, having been found in the Jurassic sphenodont &quot;Sapheosaurus&quot; as well as in the therapsid &quot;Niassodon mfumukasi.&quot;

The epiphysis is filled with red bone marrow, which produces erythrocytes (red blood cells).

== Structure ==
There are four types of epiphyses:
# Pressure epiphysis: The region of the long bone that forms the joint is a pressure epiphysis (e.g. the head of the femur, part of the hip joint complex). Pressure epiphyses assist in transmitting the weight of the human body and are the regions of the bone that are under pressure during movement or locomotion. Another example of a pressure epiphysis is the head of the humerus which is part of the shoulder complex. Condyles of femur and tibia also come under the pressure epiphysis.
# Traction epiphysis: The regions of the long bone which are non-articular, i.e. not involved in joint formation. Unlike pressure epiphyses, these regions do not assist in weight transmission. However, their proximity to the pressure epiphysis region means that the supporting ligaments and tendons attach to these areas of the bone. Traction epiphyses ossify later than pressure epiphyses. Examples of traction epiphyses are tubercles of the humerus (greater tubercle and lesser tubercle), and trochanters of the femur (greater and lesser).
# Atavistic epiphysis: A bone that is independent phylogenetically but is fused with another bone in humans. These types of fused bones are called atavistic, &quot;e.g.&quot;, the coracoid process of the scapula, which has been fused in humans, but is separate in four-legged animals. &quot;os&quot; &quot;trigonum&quot; (posterior tubercle of talus) is another example for atavistic epiphysis.
# Aberrant epiphysis: These epiphyses are deviations from the norm and are not always present. For example, the epiphysis at the head of the first metacarpal bone and at the base of other metacarpal bones

=== Bones with an epiphysis ===
Many bones in the body contain an epiphysis, a region critical for growth and articulation. The humerus, for example, is situated between the shoulder and elbow and contributes significantly to upper limb movement. Below the elbow are the radius and ulna, two bones that run parallel to each other. In anatomical position, the radius is positioned laterally, while the ulna lies medially. Both bones are essential in forelimb structure and motion.

Distal to the forearm bones are the metacarpal bones, which reside in the forelimb. These bones are located just beyond the wrist and serve as a link to the phalanges, or finger bones, at the end of the limbs.

In the lower body, the femur is a prominent bone positioned between the hip and knee. As the longest bone in the human body, it plays a pivotal role in forming the upper part of the knee joint. In the lower leg, the tibia and fibula are two parallel bones that complete the lower half of the knee joint. The tibia, located medially, bears most of the body&#x27;s weight, while the fibula, positioned laterally, is smaller and supports leg structure. Further down the leg are the metatarsal bones, found near the distal end of the hindlimb. These bones are positioned proximal to the toe bones, or phalanges, providing support and structure in the foot.

===Pseudo-epiphysis===

A &quot;pseudo-epiphysis&quot; is an epiphysis-looking end of a bone where an epiphysis is not normally located. A pseudo-epiphysis is delineated by a &quot;transverse notch&quot;, looking similar to a &quot;growth plate&quot;. However, these transverse notches lack the typical cell columns found in normal growth plates, and do not contribute significantly to longitudinal bone growth. Pseudo-epiphyses are found at the distal end of the first metacarpal bone in 80% of the normal population, and at the proximal end of the second metacarpal in 60%.

==Clinical significance==
Pathologies of the epiphysis include avascular necrosis and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). OCD involves the subchondral bone.

Epiphyseal lesions include chondroblastoma and giant-cell tumor.

<doc id="419986" wikidata="Q917177" url="?curid=419986" title="Osteoblast">
<text>Osteoblasts (from the Greek combining forms for &quot;bone&quot;, ὀστέο-, &quot;osteo-&quot; and βλαστάνω, &quot;blastanō&quot; &quot;germinate&quot;) are cells with a single nucleus that synthesize bone. However, in the process of bone formation, osteoblasts function in groups of connected cells. Individual cells cannot make bone. A group of organized osteoblasts together with the bone made by a unit of cells is usually called the osteon.

Osteoblasts are specialized, terminally differentiated products of mesenchymal stem cells. They synthesize dense, crosslinked collagen and specialized proteins in much smaller quantities, including osteocalcin and osteopontin, which compose the organic matrix of bone.

In organized groups of disconnected cells, osteoblasts produce hydroxyapatite, the bone mineral, that is deposited in a highly regulated manner, into the inorganic matrix forming a strong and dense mineralized tissue, the mineralized matrix. Hydroxyapatite-coated bone implants often perform better as those not coated with this material. For instance, in patients with fatty liver disease hydroxyapatite-coated titanium implants perform better as those not-coated with this material. The mineralized skeleton is the main support for the bodies of air breathing vertebrates. It is also an important store of minerals for physiological homeostasis including both acid-base balance and calcium or phosphate maintenance.

== Bone structure ==
The skeleton is a large organ that is formed and degraded throughout life in the air-breathing vertebrates. The skeleton, often referred to as the skeletal system, is important both as a supporting structure and for maintenance of calcium, phosphate, and acid-base status in the whole organism. The functional part of bone, the &quot;bone matrix&quot;, is entirely extracellular. The bone matrix consists of protein and mineral. The protein forms the &quot;organic matrix.&quot; It is synthesized and then the mineral is added. The vast majority of the organic matrix is collagen, which provides tensile strength. The matrix is mineralized by deposition of hydroxyapatite (alternative name, hydroxylapatite). This mineral is hard, and provides compressive strength. Thus, the collagen and mineral together are a composite material with excellent tensile and compressive strength, which can bend under a strain and recover its shape without damage. This is called elastic deformation. Forces that exceed the capacity of bone to behave elastically may cause failure, typically bone fractures.

==Bone remodeling==
Bone is a dynamic tissue that is constantly being reshaped by osteoblasts, which produce and secrete matrix proteins and transport mineral into the matrix, and osteoclasts, which break down the tissues.

=== Osteoblasts ===
Osteoblasts are the major cellular component of bone. Osteoblasts arise from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). MSC give rise to osteoblasts, adipocytes, and myocytes among other cell types. Osteoblast quantity is understood to be inversely proportional to that of marrow adipocytes which comprise marrow adipose tissue (MAT). Osteoblasts are found in large numbers in the periosteum, the thin connective tissue layer on the outside surface of bones, and in the endosteum.

Normally, almost all of the bone matrix, in the air breathing vertebrates, is mineralized by the osteoblasts. Before the organic matrix is mineralized, it is called the osteoid. Osteoblasts buried in the matrix are called osteocytes. During bone formation, the surface layer of osteoblasts consists of cuboidal cells, called &quot;active osteoblasts&quot;. When the bone-forming unit is not actively synthesizing bone, the surface osteoblasts are flattened and are called &quot;inactive osteoblasts&quot;. Osteocytes remain alive and are connected by cell processes to a surface layer of osteoblasts. Osteocytes have important functions in skeletal maintenance.

=== Osteoclasts ===
Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells that derive from hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow which also give rise to monocytes in peripheral blood. Osteoclasts break down bone tissue, and along with osteoblasts and osteocytes form the structural components of bone. In the hollow within bones are many other cell types of the bone marrow. Components that are essential for osteoblast bone formation include mesenchymal stem cells (osteoblast precursor) and blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients for bone formation. Bone is a highly vascular tissue, and active formation of blood vessel cells, also from mesenchymal stem cells, is essential to support the metabolic activity of bone. The balance of bone formation and bone resorption tends to be negative with age, particularly in post-menopausal women, often leading to a loss of bone serious enough to cause fractures, which is called osteoporosis.

==Osteogenesis==
Bone is formed by one of two processes: endochondral ossification or intramembranous ossification. Endochondral ossification is the process of forming bone from cartilage and this is the usual method. This form of bone development is the more complex form: it follows the formation of a first skeleton of cartilage made by chondrocytes, which is then removed and replaced by bone, made by osteoblasts. Intramembranous ossification is the direct ossification of mesenchyme as happens during the formation of the membrane bones of the skull and others.

During osteoblast differentiation, the developing progenitor cells express the regulatory transcription factor Cbfa1/Runx2. A second required transcription factor is Sp7 transcription factor. Osteochondroprogenitor cells differentiate under the influence of growth factors, although isolated mesenchymal stem cells in tissue culture may also form osteoblasts under permissive conditions that include vitamin C and substrates for alkaline phosphatase, a key enzyme that provides high concentrations of phosphate at the mineral deposition site. In turn osteoblasts may give rise to osteocytes in a process dependent on the vascular musculature of blood vessels in the bone.

=== Bone morphogenetic proteins ===
Key growth factors in endochondral skeletal differentiation include bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) that determine to a major extent where chondrocyte differentiation occurs and where spaces are left between bones. The system of cartilage replacement by bone has a complex regulatory system. BMP2 also regulates early skeletal patterning. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), is part of a superfamily of proteins that include BMPs, which possess common signaling elements in the TGF beta signaling pathway. TGF-β is particularly important in cartilage differentiation, which generally precedes bone formation for endochondral ossification. An additional family of essential regulatory factors is the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) that determine where skeletal elements occur in relation to the skin

===Steroid and protein hormones===
Many other regulatory systems are involved in the transition of cartilage to bone and in bone maintenance. A particularly important bone-targeted hormonal regulator is parathyroid hormone (PTH). Parathyroid hormone is a protein made by the parathyroid gland under the control of serum calcium activity. PTH also has important systemic functions, including to keep serum calcium concentrations nearly constant regardless of calcium intake. Increasing dietary calcium results in minor increases in blood calcium. However, this is not a significant mechanism supporting osteoblast bone formation, except in the condition of low dietary calcium; further, abnormally high dietary calcium raises the risk of serious health consequences not directly related to bone mass including heart attack and stroke. Intermittent PTH stimulation increases osteoblast activity, although PTH is bifunctional and mediates bone matrix degradation at higher concentrations.

The skeleton is also modified for reproduction and in response to nutritional and other hormone stresses; it responds to steroids, including estrogen and glucocorticoids, which are important in reproduction and energy metabolism regulation. Bone turnover involves major expenditures of energy for synthesis and degradation, involving many additional signals including pituitary hormones. Two of these are adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and follicle stimulating hormone. The physiological role for responses to these, and several other glycoprotein hormones, is not fully understood, although it is likely that ACTH is bifunctional, like PTH, supporting bone formation with periodic spikes of ACTH, but causing bone destruction in large concentrations. In mice, mutations that reduce the efficiency of ACTH-induced glucocorticoid production in the adrenals cause the skeleton to become dense (osteosclerotic bone).

==Organization and ultrastructure==
In well-preserved bone studied at high magnification via electron microscopy, individual osteoblasts are shown to be connected by tight junctions, which prevent extracellular fluid passage and thus create a bone compartment separate from the general extracellular fluid. The osteoblasts are also connected by gap junctions, small pores that connect osteoblasts, allowing the cells in one cohort to function as a unit. The gap junctions also connect deeper layers of cells to the surface layer (&quot;osteocytes&quot; when surrounded by bone). This was demonstrated directly by injecting low molecular weight fluorescent dyes into osteoblasts and showing that the dye diffused to surrounding and deeper cells in the bone-forming unit. Bone is composed of many of these units, which are separated by impermeable zones with no cellular connections, called cement lines.

==Collagen and accessory proteins==
Almost all of the organic (non-mineral) component of bone is dense collagen type I, which forms dense crosslinked ropes that give bone its tensile strength. By mechanisms still unclear, osteoblasts secrete layers of oriented collagen, with the layers parallel to the long axis of the bone alternating with layers at right angles to the long axis of the bone every few micrometers. Defects in collagen type I cause the commonest inherited disorder of bone, called osteogenesis imperfecta.

Minor, but important, amounts of small proteins, including osteocalcin and osteopontin, are secreted in bone&#x27;s organic matrix. Osteocalcin is not expressed at significant concentrations except in bone, and thus osteocalcin is a specific marker for bone matrix synthesis. These proteins link organic and mineral component of bone matrix. The proteins are necessary for maximal matrix strength due to their intermediate localization between mineral and collagen.

However, in mice where expression of osteocalcin or osteopontin was eliminated by targeted disruption of the respective genes (knockout mice), accumulation of mineral was not notably affected, indicating that organization of matrix is not significantly related to mineral transport.

==Bone versus cartilage==
The primitive skeleton is cartilage, a solid avascular (without blood vessels) tissue in which individual cartilage-matrix secreting cells, or chondrocytes, occur. Chondrocytes do not have intercellular connections and are not coordinated in units. Cartilage is composed of a network of collagen type II held in tension by water-absorbing proteins, hydrophilic proteoglycans. This is the adult skeleton in cartilaginous fishes such as sharks. It develops as the initial skeleton in more advanced classes of animals.

In air-breathing vertebrates, cartilage is replaced by cellular bone. A transitional tissue is mineralized cartilage. Cartilage mineralizes by massive expression of phosphate-producing enzymes, which cause high local concentrations of calcium and phosphate that precipitate. This mineralized cartilage is not dense or strong. In the air breathing vertebrates it is used as a scaffold for formation of cellular bone made by osteoblasts, and then it is removed by osteoclasts, which specialize in degrading mineralized tissue.

Osteoblasts produce an advanced type of bone matrix consisting of dense, irregular crystals of hydroxyapatite, packed around the collagen ropes. This is a strong composite material that allows the skeleton to be shaped mainly as hollow tubes. Reducing the long bones to tubes reduces weight while maintaining strength.

==Mineralization of bone==
The mechanisms of mineralization are not fully understood. Fluorescent, low-molecular weight compounds such as tetracycline or calcein bind strongly to bone mineral, when administered for short periods. They then accumulate in narrow bands in the new bone. These bands run across the contiguous group of bone-forming osteoblasts. They occur at a narrow (sub-micrometer) mineralization front. Most bone surfaces express no new bone formation, no tetracycline uptake and no mineral formation. This strongly suggests that facilitated or active transport, coordinated across the bone-forming group, is involved in bone formation, and that only cell-mediated mineral formation occurs. That is, dietary calcium does not create mineral by mass action.

The mechanism of mineral formation in bone is clearly distinct from the phylogenetically older process by which cartilage is mineralized: tetracycline does not label mineralized cartilage at narrow bands or in specific sites, but diffusely, in keeping with a passive mineralization mechanism.

Osteoblasts separate bone from the extracellular fluid by tight junctions by regulated transport. Unlike in cartilage, phosphate and calcium cannot move in or out by passive diffusion, because the tight osteoblast junctions isolate the bone formation space. Calcium is transported across osteoblasts by facilitated transport (that is, by passive transporters, which do not pump calcium against a gradient). In contrast, phosphate is actively produced by a combination of secretion of phosphate-containing compounds, including ATP, and by phosphatases that cleave phosphate to create a high phosphate concentration at the mineralization front. Alkaline phosphatase is a membrane-anchored protein that is a characteristic marker expressed in large amounts at the apical (secretory) face of active osteoblasts.

At least one more regulated transport process is involved. The stoichiometry of bone mineral basically is that of hydroxyapatite precipitating from phosphate, calcium, and water at a slightly alkaline pH:

In a closed system as mineral precipitates, acid accumulates, rapidly lowering the pH and stopping further precipitation. Cartilage presents no barrier to diffusion and acid therefore diffuses away, allowing precipitation to continue. In the osteon, where matrix is separated from extracellular fluid by tight junctions, this cannot occur. In the controlled, sealed compartment, removing H+ drives precipitation under a wide variety of extracellular conditions, as long as calcium and phosphate are available in the matrix compartment. The mechanism by which acid transits the barrier layer remains uncertain. Osteoblasts have capacity for Na+/H+ exchange via the redundant Na/H exchangers, NHE1 and NHE6. This H+ exchange is a major element in acid removal, although the mechanism by which H+ is transported from the matrix space into the barrier osteoblast is not known.

In bone removal, a reverse transport mechanism uses acid delivered to the mineralized matrix to drive hydroxyapatite into solution.

== Osteocyte feedback ==
Feedback from physical activity maintains bone mass, while feedback from osteocytes limits the size of the bone-forming unit. An important additional mechanism is secretion by osteocytes, buried in the matrix, of sclerostin, a protein that inhibits a pathway that maintains osteoblast activity. Thus, when the osteon reaches a limiting size, it deactivates bone synthesis.

==Morphology and histological staining==

Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&amp;E) shows that the cytoplasm of active osteoblasts is slightly basophilic due to the substantial presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The active osteoblast produces substantial collagen type I. About 10% of the bone matrix is collagen with the balance mineral. The osteoblast&#x27;s nucleus is spherical and large. An active osteoblast is characterized morphologically by a prominent Golgi apparatus that appears histologically as a clear zone adjacent to the nucleus. The products of the cell are mostly for transport into the osteoid, the non-mineralized matrix. Active osteoblasts can be labeled by antibodies to Type-I collagen, or using naphthol phosphate and the diazonium dye fast blue to demonstrate alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity directly.

==Isolation of Osteoblasts==
#The first isolation technique by microdissection method was originally described by Fell et al. using chick limb bones which were separated into periosteum and remaining parts. She obtained cells which possessed osteogenic characteristics from cultured tissue using chick limb bones which were separated into periosteum and remaining parts. She obtained cells which possessed osteogenic characteristics from cultured tissue. 
#Enzymatic digestion is one of the most advanced techniques for isolating bone cell populations and obtaining osteoblasts. Peck et al. (1964) described the original method that is now often used by many researchers.
#In 1974 Jones et al. found that osteoblasts moved laterally in vivo and in vitro under different experimental conditions and described the migration method in detail. The osteoblasts were, however, contaminated by cells migrating from the vascular openings, which might include endothelial cells and fibroblasts.

<text>Silva, da Silva, and de Silva are surnames of Portuguese or Galician origin which are widespread in the Portuguese-speaking countries including Brazil. The name is derived from Latin (&quot;forest&quot; or &quot;woodland&quot;). It is the family name of the House of Silva.

The name is widespread in Galician-speaking regions of Spain (mostly in Galicia) and even more so in regions of the former Portuguese Empire in the Americas (being the most common surname in Brazil), in Africa and Asia, notably in India and Sri Lanka. It is also quite common in Spanish-speaking Latin America.

Movement of people has led to the name being used in many places. Due to emigration from Portuguese-speaking countries, Silva (and the variants Da Silva and De Silva) is the fifth most common surname in the French department of Val-de-Marne, outside Paris, and it was the 19th most common family name given to newborns between 1966 and 1990 in France.

Notable people and characters with these names include the following.

<doc id="419989" wikidata="Q2035067" url="?curid=419989" title="Osteoid">
<text>In histology, osteoid is the unmineralized, organic portion of the bone matrix that forms prior to the maturation of bone tissue. Osteoblasts begin the process of forming bone tissue by secreting the osteoid as several specific proteins. The osteoid and its adjacent bone cells have developed into new bone tissue when it becomes mineralized.

Osteoid makes up about fifty percent of bone volume and forty percent of bone weight. It is composed of fibers and ground substance. The predominant type of fiber is type I collagen and comprises ninety percent of the osteoid. The ground substance is mostly made up of chondroitin sulfate and osteocalcin.

==Disorders==

When there are insufficient nutrient minerals or osteoblast dysfunction, the osteoid does not mineralize properly and accumulates. The resultant disorder is termed rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. A deficiency of type I collagen, such as in osteogenesis imperfecta, also leads to defective osteoid and brittle, fracture-prone bones.

In some cases, secondary hyperparathyroidism can cause a disturbance in mineralisation of calcium and phosphate.

Another condition is a disturbance in primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin, which exhibit osteoblastic differentiation and produce malignant osteoid. This results in the formation of a malignant primary bone tumor known as osteosarcoma or osteogenic sarcoma. This malignancy most often develops in adolescence during periods of rapid osteoid formation (commonly referred to as growth spurts).

<text>A fibrocartilage callus is a temporary formation of fibroblasts and chondroblasts which forms at the area of a bone fracture as the bone attempts to heal itself. The cells eventually dissipate and become dormant, lying in the resulting extracellular matrix that is the new bone.
The callus is the first sign of union visible on x-rays, usually 3 weeks after the fracture. Callus formation is slower in adults than in children, and in cortical bones than in cancellous bones.

<doc id="419999" wikidata="Q2192944" url="?curid=419999" title="Fibrocartilage">
<text>Fibrocartilage consists of a mixture of white fibrous tissue and cartilaginous tissue in various proportions. It owes its inflexibility and toughness to the former of these constituents, and its elasticity to the latter. It is the only type of cartilage that contains type I collagen in addition to the normal type II.

== Structure ==
The extracellular matrix of fibrocartilage is mainly made from type I collagen secreted by chondroblasts.

== Locations of fibrocartilage in the human body ==

* secondary cartilaginous joints:
** pubic symphysis
** annulus fibrosis of intervertebral discs
** manubriosternal joint
* glenoid labrum of shoulder joint
* acetabular labrum of hip joint
* medial and lateral menisci of the knee joint
* location where tendons and ligaments attach to bone
* triangular fibrocartilage complex (UTFCC)

==Function==

=== Repair ===
If hyaline cartilage is torn all the way down to the bone, the blood supply from inside the bone is sometimes enough to start some healing inside the lesion. In cases like this, the body will form a scar in the area using a special type of cartilage called fibrocartilage. Fibrocartilage is a tough, dense, and fibrous material that helps fill in the torn part of the cartilage; however, it is not an ideal replacement for the smooth, glassy articular cartilage that normally covers the surface of joints.

==Clinical significance==

Degeneration of fibrocartilage is seen in degenerative disc disease.

<text>Abigail Jane Scott Duniway (October 22, 1834 – October 11, 1915) was an American women&#x27;s rights advocate, newspaper editor and writer, whose efforts were instrumental in gaining voting rights for women in the United States.
Duniway was born near Groveland, Illinois, to John Tucker Scott and Anne Roelofson Scott. Of the nine children in her family who survived infancy, she was the second. She grew up on the family farm and attended a local school intermittently. In March 1852, against the wishes of Anne Scott, who had concerns about her health, John organized a party of 30 people and 5 ox-drawn wagons to emigrate to Oregon, away by trail. Anne died of cholera near Fort Laramie, on the Oregon Trail, in June, and Willie, age 3, the youngest child in the family, died in August along the Burnt River in Oregon. In October, the emigrants reached their destination, Lafayette, in the Willamette Valley. After teaching school in Eola in early 1853, Abigail Scott Duniway married Benjamin Charles Duniway, a farmer from Illinois, on August 1. They had six children: Clara Belle (b. 1854), Willis Scott (1856), Hubert (1859), Wilkie Collins (1861), Clyde Augustus (1866), and Ralph Roelofson (1869).

The Duniways farmed in Clackamas County until 1857, when they moved to a farm near Lafayette. They lost this second farm after a friend defaulted on a note Benjamin had endorsed. Soon afterward, Benjamin was permanently disabled in an accident involving a runaway team, and Abigail had to support the family. At first, she opened and ran a small boarding school in Lafayette. In 1866, she moved to Albany where she taught in a private school for a year, then opened a millinery and notions shop, which she ran for five years. Angered by stories of injustice and mistreatment relayed to her by married patrons of her shop, and encouraged by Benjamin, she moved to Portland in 1871 to found &quot;The New Northwest&quot;, a weekly newspaper devoted to women&#x27;s rights, including suffrage. She published the first issue on May 5, 1871, and continued &quot;The New Northwest&quot; for 16 years.

Before addressing the Oregon legislature, Abigail Scott Duniway toured the Pacific Northwest in the company of the famous Susan B. Anthony, one of the leading voices in the Women&#x27;s Suffrage movement. In 1872 she was invited to address Oregon&#x27;s legislature to put forward the case for women&#x27;s suffrage. She was appearing on behalf of the Oregon State Woman Suffrage Association, but no one wanted to keep her company. Other women feared what their husbands and others might say. Finally she found Dr. Mary Sawtelle who agreed to also venture into this male-only preserve. 
Duniway encountered personal setbacks such as poor health and money problems. Her brother Harvey W. Scott, who also edited &quot;The Oregonian&quot; and later contributed to &quot;The New Northwest&quot;, opposed woman suffrage in many editorials on the subject. She persisted despite political opposition in the form of local resistance, the consistent failure of women&#x27;s suffrage referendums on state ballots, and divisions with Eastern suffrage organizations. She and her newspaper actively supported the Sole Trader Bill and the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act which, when passed, gave Oregon women the right to own and control property.

Her persistence paid off in 1912 when Oregon became the seventh state in the U.S. to pass a women&#x27;s suffrage amendment. Governor Oswald West asked her to write and sign the equal suffrage proclamation. She was the first woman to register to vote in Multnomah County.

Duniway is buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.

==Publications==

Duniway&#x27;s &quot;Captain Gray&#x27;s Company; or, Crossing the Plains and Living in Oregon&quot; (1859), was the first novel to be commercially published in Oregon. This and others that she wrote drew repeatedly on her experiences as a young woman on the Oregon Trail. Her last novel to tell the story was &quot;From the West to the West: Across the Plains to Oregon&quot; (1905). She wrote a booklet called &quot;My Musings&quot; after attending a convention of the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1872. Her last publication was &quot;Path Breaking: An Autobiographical History of the Equal Suffrage Movement in Pacific Coast States&quot;, in 1914.

<text>The Yiddish Book Center (formerly the National Yiddish Book Center), located on the campus of Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, United States, is a cultural institution dedicated to the preservation of books in the Yiddish language, as well as the culture and history those books represent. It is one of ten western Massachusetts museums constituting the Museums10 consortium.

==History==
The Yiddish Book Center was founded in 1980 by Aaron Lansky, then a twenty-four-year-old graduate student of Yiddish literature and, until a planned retirement in June 2025, the center&#x27;s president. In the course of his studies, Lansky realized that untold numbers of irreplaceable Yiddish books were being discarded by American-born Jews unable to read the language of their Yiddish-speaking parents and grandparents. He organized a nationwide network of (volunteer book collectors) and launched a campaign to save the world&#x27;s remaining Yiddish books. Lansky recounts the origins of the center in his 2004 memoir, &quot;Outwitting History&quot;.

At the time Lansky began his work, scholars estimated there were 70,000 Yiddish books still extant and recoverable. Since then, the Yiddish Book Center has recovered more than a million volumes, and it continues to receive thousands of new books each year from around the world.

In 1997, the Yiddish Book Center moved to its current site in Amherst, Massachusetts, a 49,000-square-foot complex that echoes the rooflines of an East European &quot;shtetl&quot; (Jewish town). The center is home to permanent and travelling exhibits, a Yiddish book repository, educational programs, and the annual Yidstock: The Festival of New Yiddish Music.

In 2010, the organization dropped the initial word &quot;National&quot; from its name, and is currently known as &quot;Yiddish Book Center.&quot;

Based on a score of 100, Charity Navigator rated the Yiddish Book Center a score of 97 out of 100 for Accountability and Finance, noting its independent board and positive financial status, and labeled it a 4-Star charity for the fiscal year of 2023.

==Collections==
The center has drawn on its duplicate holdings to distribute books to students and scholars, and to establish or strengthen collections at more than 700 research libraries, schools, and museums around the world.

The Yiddish Book Center includes a number of different collections: 
* In 1997, with a grant from the Righteous Persons Foundation, the center launched its Steven Spielberg Digital Yiddish Library, which has digitized and cataloged more than 12,000 Yiddish titles and made them available for free download from the Internet Archive. In 2012, the Yiddish Book Center formed a partnership with the National Library of Israel, which was launching its own project to digitize its entire Hebrew-alphabet collection, including thousands of Yiddish titles. The effort prompted &quot;The New York Times&quot; to declare Yiddish &quot;proportionately the most accessible literature on the planet&quot;. As of the end of 2014, the titles in the Steven Spielberg Digital Yiddish Library have been downloaded 1.3 million times. 
* The David and Sylvia Steiner Yizkor Books Collection comprises hundreds of &quot;yizkor books&quot;, memorial volumes commemorating Jewish communities in East Europe that were destroyed in the Holocaust. The books in the collection can be searched online.
* The Noah Cotsen Library of Yiddish Children&#x27;s Literature includes about 800 titles, both original Yiddish works and Yiddish translations of classic stories written in other languages. The majority of the titles, which come from the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research as well as from the center&#x27;s own collection, have been digitized and included in the Steven Spielberg Digital Yiddish Library.
* The Sami Rohr Library of Recorded Yiddish Books is a collection of roughly 150 titles, including novels, short stories, nonfiction works, memoirs, essays, and poetry. The recordings were made at the Jewish Public Library of Montreal (JPL) in the 1980s and &#x27;90s by native Yiddish-speaking volunteers. 
* The Frances Brandt Online Yiddish Audio Library comprises recordings of lectures by, and interviews with, writers and poets who visited the JPL between 1953 and 2005. The Yiddish Book Center is now working with the JPL to digitize the recordings. Ultimately, approximately 1,100 recordings from the collection will be digitized and accessible.
* The Wexler Oral History Project is a collection of more than 1,200 oral history interviews, documentary films, and archival footage related to Yiddish language and culture. Many of the interviews comprise Holocaust survivor testimonies, although the collection also features interviews with contemporary Yiddish scholars, cultural contributors, and students. In 2010, the Yiddish Book Center appointed Christa Whitney as director of the project, who has since conducted over 1,000 of the collection&#x27;s interviews and directed documentary films about Yiddishists with historical significance. In 2013, the project interviewed Leonard Nimoy.

==Public programs and resources==
The center offers public programs related to Yiddish and Jewish culture. Each year, the center hosts two visiting exhibits in its Brechner Gallery. It also has a number of permanent exhibits: the Lee &amp; Alfred Hutt Discovery Gallery, an interactive exhibit on Jewish cultural identity; &quot;Unquiet Pages&quot; focused on Yiddish literature; &quot;A Living Connection: Photographs from the An-sky Expeditions, 1912-14&quot; on the work of ethnographer S. An-sky; &quot;Sholem-Bayes: Reflections on the American Jewish Home&quot;; the Nancy B. Weinstein, &quot;Kindervinkl&quot; (children&#x27;s corner); the Appelbaum-Driker Theater, with exhibits on Yiddish film and radio; and a reproduction Yiddish Print Shop with displays about the Yiddish press in the twentieth century.

&quot;Pakn Treger&quot; (Yiddish for &quot;book peddler&quot;), the magazine of the Yiddish Book Center, is an English-language magazine that covers subjects related to Yiddish culture and literature as well as news from the center. Its annual translation issue, a digital publication, features newly translated works of Yiddish literature.

==Educational programs==
The center&#x27;s online and in-person educational programs include the Steiner Summer Yiddish Program for college students, the Great Jewish Books Summer Program for high school students, a Great Jewish Books Teacher Workshop, a fellowship program, a translation fellowship, as well as online and on-site classes for adult learners, including the Bossie Dubowick YiddishSchool. The center also offers a field trip program for middle and high school students.

==Translation and other initiatives==
In 2013, the center launched a translation effort that includes a translation fellowship program; a publishing venture; Taytsh.org, a website and interactive resource for working Yiddish-to-English translators; and an annual digital &quot;Pakn Treger&quot; translation anthology. In 2019, the center established White Goat Press, the Yiddish Book Center&#x27;s imprint. White Goat Press is committed to bringing newly translated work to the widest readership possible, publishing work in all genres. As of 2022, White Goat Press has releases 5 titles including &quot;In eynem&quot;: The New Yiddish Textbook.

<text>A preschool (sometimes spelled as pre school or pre-school), also known as nursery school, pre-primary school, play school or creche, is an educational establishment or learning space offering early childhood education to children before they begin compulsory education at primary school. It may be publicly or privately operated, and may be subsidized from public funds. The typical age range for preschool in most countries is from 2 to 6 years.

==Terminology ==
Terminology varies by country. In some European countries the term &quot;kindergarten&quot; refers to formal education of children classified as &quot;ISCED level 0&quot; – with one or several years of such education being compulsory – before children start primary school at &quot;ISCED level 1&quot;.

The following terms may be used for educational institutions for this age group:
*Pre-primary or creche from 6 weeks old to 6 years old – is an educational childcare service a parent can enroll their child(ren) in before primary school. This can also be used to define services for children younger than kindergarten age, especially in countries where kindergarten is compulsory. The pre-primary program takes place in a nursery school.
*Nursery school (UK and US) from 0 months to 5 years old – is a pre-primary educational child care institution which includes Preschool.
*Daycare (US) from 0 months to 2½ years old – held in a Nursery School, but can also be called &quot;a child care service&quot; or a &quot;crèche&quot;.
*Preschool (US and UK) from 2 to 5 years old – held in a Nursery School; readiness has to do with whether the child is on track developmentally, and potty training is a big factor, so a child can start as early as 2 years old. Preschool education is regarded by many as important and beneficial for any child as it may give the child opportunities for new social interactions. Through cognitive, psychosocial and physical development-based learning a child in preschool will learn about their environment and how to verbally communicate with others. Children who attend Preschool learn how the world around them works through play and communication.
*Pre-K (or Pre-Kindergarten) from 4 to 5 years old – held in Nursery School and is an initiative to improve access to pre-primary schools for children in the USA. There is much more than teaching a child colors, numbers, shapes and so on.
*Kindergarten (US) from 5 to 6 years old – held in a Nursery School and/or some primary elementary schools; in many parts of world (less so in English speaking countries) it refers to the first stages of formal education.

==History==

===Origins===

In an age when school was restricted to children who had already learned to read and write at home, there were many attempts to make school accessible to orphans or to the children of women who worked in factories.

In 1779, Johann Friedrich Oberlin and Louise Scheppler founded in Strasbourg an early establishment for caring for and educating pre-school children whose parents were absent during the day. At about the same time, in 1780, similar infant establishments were established in Bavaria In 1802, Pauline zur Lippe established a preschool center in Detmold.

In 1816, Robert Owen, a philosopher and pedagogue, opened the first British and probably globally the first infant school in New Lanark, Scotland. In conjunction with his venture for cooperative mills Owen wanted the children to be given a good moral education so that they would be fit for work. His system was successful in producing obedient children with basic literacy and numeracy.

Samuel Wilderspin opened his first infant school in London in 1819, and went on to establish hundreds more. He published many works on the subject, and his work became the model for infant schools throughout England and further afield. Play was an important part of Wilderspin&#x27;s system of education. He was recognized for inventing the playground. In 1823, Wilderspin published &quot;On the Importance of Educating the Infant Poor&quot;, based on the school. He began working for the Infant School Society the next year, informing others about his views. He also wrote &quot;The Infant System, for developing the physical, intellectual, and moral powers off all children from one to seven years of age&quot;.

===Spread===
Countess Theresa Brunszvik (1775–1861), who had known and been influenced by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, was influenced by this example to open an &quot;Angyalkert&quot; (&#x27;angel garden&#x27; in Hungarian) on 27 May 1828 in her residence in Buda, the first of eleven care centers that she founded for young children. In 1836 she established an institute for the foundation of preschool centers. The idea became popular among the nobility and the middle class and was copied throughout the Hungarian kingdom.
Friedrich Fröbel (1782–1852) opened a &quot;Play and Activity&quot; institute in 1837 in the village of Bad Blankenburg in the principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Thuringia, which he renamed Kindergarten on 28 June 1840. That same year the educator Emily Ronalds was the first British person to study his approach and Fröbel urged her to transplant his concepts in England.

Later, women trained by Fröbel opened Kindergartens throughout Europe and around the World. The First Kindergarten in the United States was founded in Watertown, Wisconsin in 1856 and was conducted in German. Elizabeth Peabody founded America&#x27;s first English-language kindergarten in 1860 and the first free kindergarten in America was founded in 1870 by Conrad Poppenhusen, a German industrialist and philanthropist, who also established the Poppenhusen Institute and the first publicly financed kindergarten in the United States was established in St. Louis in 1873 by Susan Blow. Canada&#x27;s first private kindergarten was opened by the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island in 1870 and by the end of the decade, they were common in large Canadian towns and cities. The country&#x27;s first public-school kindergartens were established in Berlin, Ontario in 1882 at Central School. In 1885, the Toronto Normal School (teacher training) opened a department for Kindergarten teaching.

Elizabeth Harrison wrote extensively on the theory of early childhood education and worked to enhance educational standards for kindergarten teachers by establishing what became the National College of Education in 1886.

Head Start was the first publicly funded preschool program in the US, created in 1965 by President Johnson for low-income families—only 10% of children were then enrolled in preschool. Due to large demand, various states subsidized preschool for low-income families in the 1980s.

==Developmental areas==
The most important years of learning begin at birth. The first three years of a child&#x27;s life are critical for setting the foundation for language acquisition, socialization, and attitudes to learning. During the early years and especially during the first 3 to 5 years, humans are capable of absorbing a lot of information. The brain grows most rapidly in the early years. High quality and well trained teachers and preschools with developmentally-appropriate programmes can have a long-term effect on improving learning outcomes for children. The effects tend to be more marked for disadvantaged students i.e. children coming from impoverished backgrounds with very little or no access to healthy food, socialization, books and play resources.

The areas of development that preschool education covers varies. However, the following main themes are typically offered.

* Personal, social and emotional development
* Communication, language, and literacy
* Mathematical development
* Knowledge and understanding of the world
* Physical development
* Creative, expressive, and aesthetic development

Preschool systems observe standards for structure (administration, class size, student–teacher ratio, services), process (quality of classroom environments, teacher-child interactions, etc.) and alignment (standards, curriculum, assessments) components. Curriculum is designed for differing ages. For example, counting to 10 is generally after the age of four.

Some studies dispute the benefits of preschool education, finding that preschool can be detrimental to cognitive and social development. A study by UC Berkeley and Stanford University on 14,000 preschools revealed that while there is a temporary cognitive boost in pre-reading and math, preschool holds detrimental effects on social development and cooperation. Research has also shown that the home environment has a greater impact on future outcomes than preschool.

There is emerging evidence that high-quality preschools are &quot;play based,&quot; rather than attempting to provide early formal instruction in academic subjects. &quot;Playing with other children, away from adults, is how children learn to make their own decisions, control their emotions and impulses, see from others&#x27; perspectives, negotiate differences with others, and make friends,&quot; according to Peter Gray, a professor at Boston College and an expert on the evolution of play and its vital role in child development. &quot;In short, play is how children learn to take control of their lives.&quot;

In 2022, 68% of 4-year-olds in the United States attended preschool, with 32% not participating.

Research by the American Psychological Association indicates that preschool attendees tend to achieve higher scores in cognitive and language assessments, demonstrating the positive impact of early education on intellectual development.

The Economic Policy Institute reports that pre-school programs provide long-term economic benefits; investments in preschool lead to higher earnings, increased tax revenues, and a reduction in social costs.

Preschools have adopted various methods of teaching, such as Montessori, Waldorf, Head Start, HighScope, Reggio Emilia approach, Bank Street and Forest kindergartens.

== Funding ==
While a majority of American preschool programs remain tuition-based, support for some public funding of early childhood education has grown over the years. As of 2008, 38 states and the District of Columbia invested in at least some preschool programs, and many school districts were providing preschool services on their own, using local and federal funds. The United States spends .04% of its GDP or $63 billion on preschool education.

The benefits and challenges of a public preschool reflect the available funding. Funding can range from federal, state, local public allocations, private sources, and parental fees. The problem of funding a public preschool occurs not only from limited sources but from the cost per child. As of 2007, the average cost across the lower 48 states was $6,582. Four categories determine the costs of public preschools: personnel ratios, personnel qualifications, facilities and transportation, and health and nutrition services. These costs depend heavily on the cost and quality of services provided. The main personnel factor related to cost is teacher qualifications. Another determinant of cost is the length of the school day. Longer sessions cost more.

Collaboration has helped fund programs in several districts. Collaborations with area Head Start and other private preschools helped fund a public preschool in one district. &quot;We&#x27;re very pleased with the interaction. It&#x27;s really added a dimension to our program that&#x27;s been very positive&quot;. The National Head Start Bureau has been looking for more opportunities to partner with public schools. Torn Schultz of the Bureau states, &quot;We&#x27;re turning to partnership as much as possible, either in funds or facilities to make sure children get everything necessary to be ready for school&quot;.

== Curriculum ==

Curricula for preschool children have long been a hotbed for debate. Much of this revolves around content and pedagogy; the extent to which academic content should be included in the curriculum and whether formal instruction or child-initiated exploration, supported by adults, is more effective. Proponents of an academic curriculum are likely to favour a focus on basic skills, especially literacy and &quot;numeracy&quot;, and structured pre-determined activities for achieving related goals. Internationally, there is strong opposition to this type of early childhood care and education curriculum and defence of a broad-based curriculum that supports a child&#x27;s overall development including health and physical development, emotional and spiritual wellbeing, social competence, intellectual development and communication skills. The type of document that emerges from this perspective is likely to be more open, offering a framework which teachers and parents can use to develop curricula specific to their contexts.

==National variations==

Preschool education, like all other forms of education, is intended by the society that controls it to transmit important cultural values to the participants. As a result, different cultures make different choices about preschool education. Despite the variations, there are a few common themes. Most significantly, preschool is universally expected to increase the young child&#x27;s ability to perform basic self-care tasks such as dressing, feeding, and toileting.

===China===

The study of early childhood education (ECE) in China has been intimately influenced by the reforms and progress of Chinese politics and the economy. Currently, the Chinese government has shown interest in early childhood education, implementing policies in the form of The Guidance for Kindergarten Education (Trial Version) in 2001 and The National Education Reform and Development of Long-Term planning Programs (2010–2020) in 2010. It has been found that China&#x27;s kindergarten education has dramatically changed since 1990. In recent years, various Western curricula and pedagogical models have been introduced to China, such as Montessori programs, Reggio Emilia, Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP), and the Project Approach. Many kindergartens have faced difficulties and challenges in adapting these models in their programs. Therefore, a heated debate about how the Western curricula can be appropriated in the Chinese cultural context has been initiated between early childhood researchers and practitioners. Research has revealed that the most important aim for promoting curriculum reform is to improve kindergarten teachers&#x27; professional knowledge, such as their understanding of the concept of play and pedagogy, and perceptions of inclusion and kindergarten-based curriculum. Furthermore, within the process of reform, family education and family collaborations cannot be ignored in child development.

Early childhood education in China has made dramatic progress since the 1980s. In Tobin, et al. 2009, which studies across three cultures, the continuity and change across the systems of early childhood education are evident. The project report Zhongguo Xueqian Jiaoyu Fazhan Zhanlue Yanjiu Ketizu 2010 reflects upon the development of China&#x27;s early childhood education and locates the current situation of the development of early childhood education. The historical development of Chinese early childhood education indicates three distinct cultural threads, including traditional culture, communist culture, and Western culture, that have shaped early childhood education in China, as demonstrated in Zhu and Zhang 2008 and Lau 2012. Furthermore, currently, administrative authorities intend to establish an independent budget for the ECE field in order to support early childhood education in rural areas (Zhao and Hu 2008). A higher quality of educational provisions for children living in rural areas will be another goal for the Chinese government. Many researchers have detailed the important issues of early childhood education, especially teacher education. The exploratory study in Hu and Szente 2010 (cited under Early Childhood Inclusive Education) has indicated that Chinese kindergarten teachers hold negative attitudes toward inclusion of children with disabilities, as they do not have enough knowledge and skills for working with this population. This indicates that kindergarten teachers need to improve their perceptions of children with disabilities. Furthermore, Gu 2007 has focused on the issues of new early childhood teachers&#x27; professional development and puts forward some feasible suggestions about how new teachers deal with key events in their everyday teaching practices. With regard to families&#x27; support of their children&#x27;s early development at home, family education should be focused and the collaborative partnership between kindergarten and family needs to be enhanced. Teachers&#x27; attitudes toward family intervention are a vital aspect of teacher-family collaboration. Therefore, kindergarten teachers should support family members in their role as the child&#x27;s first teacher and build collaborative partnerships with family, as presented in Ding 2007. Furthermore, kindergarten teachers should be considered as active researchers in children&#x27;s role play. This supports the co-construction of their teaching knowledge in relation to children&#x27;s initiation/subjectivity in role play (Liu, et al. 2003).

=== India ===

Preschool education in India is not yet officially recognized by the government and is largely run by privately held companies. The demand for play schools that cater to caring for very young children is high, with the rise in families in which both parents are working. However, a positive step forward in the direction of formalising preschool education has come forth through the NEP (National Education Policy) 2020. The NEP 2020 has placed a great deal of importance on early childhood care and education, advocating that the foundational stage (3 to 8 years) is critical and requires official/formal intervention. In fact, NEP 2020 has advocated replacing the traditional 10 + 2 schooling system with a 5+3+3+4 system.

===Ireland===

Starting in the year of 2010, Ireland passed a law stating that all children of the age 3 years and 2 months and less than 4 years and 7 months are qualified to attend a preschool free of charge. Before this law was passed there was a large number of children who did not attend an Early Childhood Education Program. The programs that were offered operated voluntary and required the parents to pay a steep fee per child. This left many families with no option but to keep the kids at home. The government soon realized that a large number of children were having trouble in their first years of primary school and parents were having to stay home becoming jobless. Once the government issued the free preschool scheme, Ireland&#x27;s preschool enrollment rate increased to about 93%.

===Japan===

In Japan, development of social skills and a sense of group belonging are major goals. Classes tend to have up to 40 students, to decrease the role of the teacher and increase peer interactions. Participation in group activities is highly valued, leading some schools to, for example, count a child who is standing still near a group exercise session as participating. Children are taught to work harmoniously in large and small groups, and to develop cooperativeness, kindness and social consciousness. The most important goal is to provide a rich social environment that increasingly isolated nuclear families do not provide; unstructured play time is valued.

Children are allowed to resolve disputes with each other, including physical fighting. Most behavioral problems are attributed to the child&#x27;s inappropriately expressed emotional dependency. Remedies involve accepting the child, rather than treatment with drugs or punishment. Japanese culture attributes success to effort rather than inborn talent, leading teachers to ignore innate differences between children by encouraging and praising perseverance. They work to ensure that all students meet the standard rather that each reaches his or her own potential. Although preschools exhibit great variety, most target age-appropriate personal development, such as learning empathy, rather than academic programs. Academic programs tend to be more common among Westernized and Christian preschools.

Boisterous play is accepted. Kids are allowed to play with water guns or to make toy swords out of paper. Gun control is extensive, and real firearms are rarely seen in Japan, but playing with toy weapons is acceptable and encouraged.

===Lithuania===

According to the Law on Education (article 6, 1991, as last amended in April 2016), pre-school education is a part of non-formal education. According to the 7th article of the Law, &quot;the purpose of pre-school education shall be to help a child satisfy inherent, cultural (including ethnic), social and cognitive needs.&quot; Despite the provision of pre-school education being an independent function of a municipality, the Law regulates the pre-school curriculum to be &quot;prepared in compliance with the criteria of pre-school curricula approved by the Minister of Education, Science and Sport, [and] shall be implemented by pre-school education schools, general education schools, freelance teachers or other education providers&quot; (article 7 part 4). The ownership of pre-school education facilities (namely, kindergartens) according to the Law could be public (state or municipality) as well as private.

===North Korea===
Preschool education in North Korea is public and provides a variety of activities, such as dance, math, drawing and Korean, as well as basic abilities such as using a spoon and respecting elders. North Korean kindergarten education includes themes common to North Korean propaganda. Subjects include the life of Kim Il Sung, the Japanese occupation of Korea, and the Korean War. Children are taught to enjoy military games and to hate the &quot;miguk nom&quot;, or &quot;American bastards&quot;.

=== Sweden ===
Preschool education in Sweden is offered from age 1 up to age 6. All preschools must follow the national curriculum set out by the Swedish National Agency for Education. Preschools are governed by the local municipalities.

===Turkey===
Preschool education in Turkey starts at the age of 5 while primary level education begins at the age of 6.

=== Armenia ===
Preschool education in Armenia starts at the age of 3 while primary level education begins at the age of 5.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, pre-school education in nursery classes or schools has some local government funding for children aged between two and four. Pre-school education can be provided by childcare centres, playgroups, nursery schools and nursery classes within primary schools. Private voluntary or independent (PVI sector) nursery education is also available throughout the UK and varies between structured pre-school education and a service offering child-minding facilities.

Nursery in England is also called FS1 which is the first year of foundation before they go into primary or infants.

The curriculum goals of a nursery school are more specific than for childcare but less strenuous than for primary school. For example, the Scottish Early Years Framework and the Curriculum for Excellence define expected outcomes even at this age. In some areas, the provision of nursery school services is on a user pays or limited basis while other governments fund nursery school services.

====England====

A voucher system for nursery provision was introduced in England and Wales under the Major government, providing for 15 hours per week free childcare or education for three and four-year-olds, much of it provided through reception classes in primary schools. This was replaced by the Blair government with direct funding by local education authorities. Every child in England at the first school term after their third birthday is now entitled to 15 hours per week free childcare funding.

The Early Years Foundation Stage sets the standards that all early years providers must meet to ensure that children learn and develop well and are kept healthy and safe. It promotes teaching and learning to ensure children&#x27;s ‘school readiness’ and gives children the broad range of knowledge and skills that provide the right foundation for good future progress through school and life.

Pre-schools in England follow the Early Years Foundation Stage statutory framework for education produced by the Department for Education, which carries on into their first year of school at the age of four. This year of school is usually called Reception. All pupils in the Early Years must follow a programme of education in seven areas, divided into &#x27;prime areas&#x27; and &#x27;specific areas&#x27;.

The three prime areas:

* communication and language
* physical development
* personal, social and emotional development

The four specific areas:

* literacy
* mathematics
* understanding the world
* expressive arts and design

Until the mid-1980s, nursery schools only admitted pupils in the final year (three terms) leading up to their admission to primary school, but pupils now attend nursery school for four or five terms. It is also common practice for many children to attend nursery much earlier than this. Many nurseries have the facilities to take on babies, using the &#x27;Early Years Foundation Stage&#x27;, framework as a guide to give each child the best possible start to becoming a competent learner and skilful communicator.

====Wales====

Provision in Wales followed England until devolution and subsequently diverged. Now early years education in Wales is provided half-time for children aged 3–4 (Nursery) and full-time for those between the ages of 4 and 5 (Reception). Since 2005 it has been a statutory duty for all Local Education Authorities to secure sufficient nursery education in their area for children from the term following their third birthday.

Currently, the Early Years curriculum in Wales, produced by the Welsh Assembly Government Department for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills, is set out in the booklet &quot;Desirable Outcomes for Children&#x27;s Learning Before Compulsory School Age&quot;. However, a new &#x27;Foundation Phase&#x27; covering 3- to 7-year-olds is being rolled out across Wales from 2008, with a focus on &#x27;learning through play&#x27;, which covers seven areas of learning:

* Personal and Social Development and Well Being
* Language, Literacy and Communication Skills
* Mathematical Development
* Bilingualism and Multi-cultural Understanding
* Knowledge and Understanding of the World
* Physical Development
* Creative Development

====Northern Ireland====

In Northern Ireland funded Nursery School places can be applied for from ages 3 and up.
Preschool education is delivered also by PreSchools, also referred to as Playschools or Playgroups. A Nursery School is allowed to enrol up to 26 children into a class, with the curriculum being delivered by a qualified teacher and a Nursery Assistant. A preschool, which delivers the same curriculum, is also permitted to admit a maximum of 26 children to any single session. However, the regulations for personnel differ. The Preschool must have a Supervisor with an NVQ 3 qualification in Child Care (or Equivalent). There must be one qualified and vetted adult for every 8 children. Funding is applied for through PEAGs (Preschool Education Advisory Group). Both nursery and preschool settings are inspected by the Education and Training Inspectorate. Preschools are also subject to inspection by local Social Services.

====Scotland====

In Scotland a voucher system for part-time pre-school provision was introduced in parallel with England and Wales under the Major government, but with a strong emphasis on age-appropriate education rather than simply childcare, and avoiding the use of reception classes in primary schools. Now children are entitled to a place in a nursery class when they reach their third birthday. This gives parents the option of two years of funded pre-school education before beginning primary one, the first year of compulsory education. Nursery children who are three years old are referred to as ante-pre-school whilst children who are four years old are termed pre-school. Pre-school education in Scotland is planned around the Early Level of the Curriculum for Excellence which identifies Outcomes &amp; Experiences around the following eight curricular areas:

* Expressive Arts,
* Health &amp; Wellbeing,
* Languages,
* Mathematics,
* Religious &amp; Moral Education,
* Sciences
* Social Studies
* Technologies

Responsibility for the review of care standards in Scottish nurseries rests with the Care Commission.

===United States===

In the United States, nursery school is provided in a variety of settings. In general, preschool is meant to be voluntary and promote development in children through planned programs. Preschool is defined as: &quot;center-based programs for four-year olds that are fully or partially funded by state education agencies and that are operated in schools or under the direction of state and local education agencies&quot;. Preschools, both private and school sponsored, are available for children from ages three to five. Many of these programs follow similar curriculum as pre-kindergarten.

In the United States, preschool education emphasizes individuality. Children are frequently permitted to choose from a variety of activities, using a learning center approach. During these times, some children draw or paint, some play house, some play with puzzles while some listen to the teacher read a story aloud. Activities vary in each session. Each child is assumed to have particular strengths and weaknesses to be encouraged or ameliorated by the teachers. A typical belief is that &quot;children&#x27;s play is their work&quot; and that by allowing them to select the type of play, the child will meet his or her developmental needs. Preschools also adopt American ideas about justice, such as the rule of law and the idea that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. Teachers do not always actively intervene in disputes and encourage children to resolve disputes independently by using verbal strategies (&quot;use your words&quot;), stating objectively what the problem or issues are, and then discussing what steps can be taken to resolve it. Punishments that may or may not include time outs are rarely carried out by teachers. Children are encouraged to apologize after understanding what has happened rather than blindly apologize. Children are also encouraged to think through steps they can take to make up for their misbehavior. Teachers assist children by explaining what happened and what was wrong in their behavior, before any decision to punish is made. Self-expressive language skills are emphasized through informal interactions with teachers and through structured group activities such as show and tell exercises to enable the child to describe an experience to an adult. Resources vary depending on the wealth of the students, but generally are better equipped than other cultures. Most programs are not subsidized by government, making preschools relatively expensive even though the staff is typically poorly compensated. Student-teacher ratios are lower than in other cultures, ideally about 15 students per group. Parents and teachers see teachers as extensions of or partial substitutes for parents and consequently emphasize personal relationships and consistent expectations at home and at school.

In contrast to many other cultures, including Japan and the UK, American preschools frequently ban squirt guns and pretend play involving toy or imaginary weapons, and may have zero-tolerance policies that require punishing children who bring or make toy guns at school.

In the United States, students who may benefit from special education receive services in preschools. Since the enactment of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Public Law 101–476 in 1975 and its amendments, PL 102-119 and PL 105–17 in 1997, the educational system has moved away from self-contained special education classrooms to inclusion, leading special education teachers to practice in a wider variety of settings. As with other stages in the life of a child with special needs, the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) is an important way for teachers, administrators and parents to set guidelines for a partnership to help the child succeed in preschool.

====Cooperative preschools====

Formally starting in 1916, cooperative preschools are common throughout much of America and focus on providing a preschool environment for children and parents which is in line with cooperative ideals.

* Parent involvement
* Parent participation
* Parent education in early childhood education programs

====Head Start ====

The goal of Head Start and of Early Head Start is to increase the school preparedness of young children in low-income families. These programs serve children from birth to age five, pregnant women, and their families. Head Start was started by the Federal Government in 1964 to help meet the needs of under-privilleged pre-school children.

The office of Economic Opportunity launched Project Head Start as an eight-week summer program in 1965. It was then transferred to the Office of Child Development in the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1969. Today it is a program within the Administration on Children, Youth and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services. Programs are administered locally by school systems and non-profit organizations.

*Services provided by Head Start

#Disabilities – All programs fully include children with disabilities
#Education – The goal of Head Start is to ensure that those children enrolled in the program are ready to begin school. Activities are geared towards skill and knowledge domains.
#Family and Community Partnerships – both groups are involved in the operation, governance, and evaluation of the program.
#Health – Health is seen as an important factor in a child&#x27;s ability to thrive and develop. The program provides screenings to evaluate a child&#x27;s overall health, regular health check-ups, and good practices in oral health, hygiene, nutrition, personal care, and safety.
#Program Management and Operations – &quot;focus on delivering high-quality child development services to children from low-income families.&quot;

<doc id="420024" wikidata="Q56923" url="?curid=420024" title="Captain general">
<text>Captain general (and its literal equivalent in several languages) is a high military rank of general officer grade, and a gubernatorial title.

==History==
The term &quot;captain general&quot; started to appear in the 14th century, with the meaning of commander-in-chief of an army (or fleet) in the field, probably the first usage of the term &quot;general&quot; in military settings. A popular term in the 16th and 17th centuries, but with various meanings depending on the country, it became less and less used in the 18th century, usually replaced with, simply, &quot;general&quot; or &quot;field marshal&quot;; and after the end of the Napoleonic Wars it had all but disappeared in most European countries, except Spain and former colonies. See also &quot;Feldhauptmann&quot; (&quot;field captain&quot;). Other ranks of general officer, as distinct from field officer, had the suffix &quot;general&quot;; e.g. major general, lieutenant general, brigadier general, colonel general.

=== Republic of Venice ===
In the Republic of Venice, it meant the commander-in-chief in war time. The captain general of the land forces was usually a foreign mercenary or condottiere, but the Venetian navy was always entrusted to a member of the city&#x27;s patriciate, who became Captain General of the Sea. It is at least documented since 1370 and was used up to the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797.

=== Great Britain ===
From 30 June to 22 October 1513, Catherine of Aragon held the titles Governor of the Realm and Captain General of the King&#x27;s Forces as Queen Regent of England, winning the Battle of Flodden against a Scottish invasion while Henry VIII was in France fighting the Battle of the Spurs.

==== Commander-in-Chief of the Forces====
In the mid-17th century, with the first establishment in England of something akin to a standing army, the title Captain General was used (either alongside or in place of that of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces) to signify its commanding officer. In 1645 Thomas Fairfax was appointed &quot;Captain General and Commander-in-Chief all the armies and forces raised and to be raised within the Commonwealth of England.&quot; After the Restoration, King Charles II likewise designated General Monck &quot;Captaine Generall of all our Armies and land forces and men … in and out of our Realmes of England, Scotland and Ireland and Dominion of Wales&quot;; (he was also referred to on occasion as &quot;Lord Generall&quot; and &quot;Commander in Chief of all His Majesty&#x27;s Forces&quot;). The office then remained in abeyance until 1678 when it was granted to the Duke of Monmouth, but he was deprived of this and other titles the following year. There were no subsequent appointments until the reign of Queen Anne.

In the 18th century, the office of Captain General was held by the Duke of Marlborough (1702 to 1711), the Duke of Ormonde (1711 to 1714) and the Duke of Marlborough again (1714 to 1722). Thereafter there was no permanent Commander-in-Chief or equivalent appointed until 1744; the following year the office of Captain General was vested in Prince William, Duke of Cumberland. Cumberland resigned in 1757; his successors in command were for the most part appointed Commander-in-Chief but not Captain General, with one exception: the last appointment of a Captain General of the Forces was that of Prince Frederick, the Duke of York in 1799.

Any distinction that there may have been at this time between the office of &quot;Captain General&quot; and &quot;Commander-in-Chief&quot; is unclear. One difference is that the Commander-in-Chief was appointed by commission and the Captain General by patent, leading some to surmise that the appointment of Captain General was &#x27;one of dignity, not of power&#x27;; however the matter is somewhat academic as most Captains General held the appointment of Commander-in-Chief simultaneously (and from 1757 the appointment of Commanders-in-Chief was itself done by patent).

====Other uses====
Since the 17th century the title Captain General has been in use in England for the titular head of the Honourable Artillery Company and in Scotland for the senior officer of the Royal Company of Archers.

In 1947 the position of Colonel-in-Chief, Royal Marines was changed by its incumbent, King George VI, to that of Captain General Royal Marines; likewise, the position of Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Regiment of Artillery was changed by its incumbent, George VI, to Captain General.

The formal head of the Combined Cadet Force is also titled Captain General.

===New South Wales===
From 1787 (the year before the arrival in Australia of the First Fleet) to 1837, the Governor of New South Wales was referred to as Captain-General.

=== Prussia ===
In Prussia a &quot;Generalkapitän&quot; was the commander of the castle guard and lifeguards.

=== United States ===
In the Thirteen United Colonies and, later, the United States of America, during the American Revolutionary War, George Washington was the &quot;Captain-General and Commander in Chief of the Forces.&quot; George Washington is the only general in the United States to be referred to as &quot;Captain-General&quot; of the armed forces.

==== Connecticut ====
In Connecticut, the state Constitution of 1965 states that the Governor is also the Captain General of the Connecticut State Militia.

==== Rhode Island ====
In Rhode Island, the Governor holds two different military titles. According to Article IX, section 3 of the Rhode Island Constitution, the Governor holds the titles of &quot;captain-general&quot; and &quot;Commander-in-Chief&quot;.

==== Vermont ====
The 1786 Constitution of Vermont, which became effective when Vermont was an independent country and continued in effect for two years after Vermont&#x27;s admission to the Union in 1791, says &quot;The Governor shall be captain-general and commander-in-chief of the forces of the State, but shall not command in person, except advised thereto by the Council, and then only as long as they shall approve thereof.&quot; The language remained in the 1793 Constitution of Vermont.

=== Netherlands ===
Maurice of Nassau was appointed to the office of &quot;Captain General of the Union&quot; (commander-in-chief of the Dutch States Army) and &quot;Admiral General&quot; of the Dutch Republic in 1587. This was a &quot;confederal&quot; office, under the States General of the Netherlands. He was also stadtholder of five of the seven provinces, which was a &quot;provincial&quot; appointive office, under the sovereign States of the several provinces. Maurice&#x27;s nephew William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg was concurrently also a stadtholder (in two provinces) but he held a normal commission in the States Army. The office was not hereditary, but after 1747 only members of the House of Orange-Nassau could be &quot;appointed&quot; to it.

=== Spain ===

By the late 15th century, the title Captain General, besides being the usual meaning of commander-in-chief in the field, was also linked to the highest commander of specialized military branches (artillery, royal guards, etc.), usually signaling the independence of that particular corps.

No later than the fall of Granada (1492) the title was conferred also on officers with full jurisdiction of every person subject to &quot;fuero militar&quot; (military obligations) in a region. Those officers usually also acted as commanders for the troops and military establishments in their area and, as time passed, those duties (and the title) were mostly united in the highest civilian authority of the area. During the period of Spanish rule in much of Latin America there were several Captaincies of the Spanish Empire. The military post of &quot;captain general&quot; as highest territorial commander lasted in Spain until the early 1980s.

==== Army ====

In the late 17th or very early 18th century, a personal rank of &quot;captain general&quot; was created in the Spanish Army (and Navy) as the highest rank in the hierarchy, not unlike the Marechal de France. When wearing uniform, the kings used captain general insignia. Valeriano Weyler, Governor General of Cuba in 1896–97 during the period preceding the Spanish–American War, held the rank. Briefly abolished by the Second Spanish Republic, it was restored during the regime of Francisco Franco in 1938; Franco himself was the only officer of this rank. Later King Juan Carlos I (1975), Agustín Muñoz Grandes (1956) and Camilo Alonso Vega (1972) were promoted while on active duty; a few posthumous promotions and promotions of retired officers to this rank were also made. In 1999, the rank was reserved to the reigning monarch.

==== Navy ====

The evolution of the title in the Spanish Navy is parallel to that of the army. During the 16th and 17th century the two main naval captain general posts were &quot;Capitán-General de la Armada del Mar Océano&quot; and &quot;Capitán-General de Galeras&quot;, roughly Commander-in-Chief for the Atlantic and the Mediterranean respectively.

A peculiar usage of the rank arose in the Spanish Navy of the 16th century. A &quot;capitán-general&quot; was appointed by the king as the leader of a fleet (although the term &#x27;squadron&#x27; is more appropriate, as most galleon fleets rarely consisted of more than a dozen vessels, not counting escorted merchantmen), with full jurisdictional powers. The fleet second-in-command was the &#x27;almirante&#x27; (admiral), an officer appointed by the capitan-general and responsible for the seaworthiness of the squadron. One captain-general that sailed under the Spanish flag that is now well known was Ferdinand Magellan, leader of the first fleet to sail around the world.

Under the Nationalist regime of 1939–1975, the only holder of the rank of &quot;capitán general de la armada&quot; was the Caudillo, Generalísimo Francisco Franco.

====Air force====

The rank of Captain General of the Air Force, originally created by Franco for himself, currently is reserved for the reigning monarch.

=== Portugal ===

==== Army ====

The title was given, in 1508, to the commander-in-chief of the &quot;Ordenanças&quot; (the territorial army of the crown).

During the Portuguese Restoration War, after 1640, the &quot;Captain-General of the Arms of the Kingdom&quot;, became the commander-in-chief of the Portuguese Army, under the direct authority of the War Council and the King. In 1762 the post of the captain-general was replaced by the title &quot;marechal-general&quot; – fieldmarshall-general.

==== Navy ====
Like in the Army, the &quot;Capitão-General da Armada Real&quot; (Captain-General of the Royal Navy) was the commander-in-chief of the Portuguese Navy in the 17th and 18th centuries.

=== France ===
The title has been only sporadically used in France. During the 17th century, and for a short while, a rank between Lieutenant General and Marshal of France of this denomination was created. The king of France was the Captain General of the Army, but was represented in the field by lieutenant generals who commanded in his absence.

=== Kingdom of Bavaria ===
In the former Kingdom of Bavaria, the &quot;generalkapitän&quot; was the leader of the royal Hartschier guard. The position was associated with the highest class ranking in the &quot;Hofrangordnung&quot; (court order of precedence).

=== Papal States ===
During the time of the Papal States the title of Captain General of the Church was given to the de facto commander-in-chief of the Papal Army. It existed parallel to the office of Gonfalonier of the Church, which was a more ceremonial position than a tactical military command position. Both offices were abolished by Pope Innocent XII and replaced with the office of Flag-bearer of the Holy Roman Church.

===Bohemia, Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine===
The term &quot;Captain General&quot; as Hetman (the word from the German Hauptmann &quot;Capitan&quot;) is a political title from Eastern Europe, historically assigned to military commanders. It was the title of the second-highest military commander (after the monarch) in 15th- to 18th and 20th-century.

=== Siam ===
The rank Captain General () was used as the highest rank in Wild Tiger Corps, this rank was exclusively for King Vajiravudh but in 1915 he created rank General of the Wild Tiger Corps () for members who are leaders of corps. The rank was equivalent to brigadier.

==Current usage as a military rank and dignity==

===Bolivia===
In Bolivia, the President of Bolivia for the duration of his or her tenure in the office has the rank and dignity of Captain General as head of the Armed forces, despite being a civilian. He or she is responsible for the overall command of the forces.

===Commonwealth realms===
In the armies of various Commonwealth realms, the term &quot;Captain General&quot; (Captain-General in Canada) is generally used when describing the ceremonial head of a corps or unit. Charles III serves as the Captain General of several artillery units in these realms, including the British Royal Artillery and the Honourable Artillery Company, the Royal Australian Artillery, the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, and the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery. In addition to artillery units, Charles III also serves as the Captain General for the British Royal Marines.

One other appointment of Captain General is in the Royal Company of Archers (The King&#x27;s Body Guard for Scotland), a position currently held by the Duke of Buccleuch.

===Chile===
If the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and the Head of State are reunited in the same person, they are promoted to the permanent military rank of &quot;Captain General&quot; (). It has only happened three times in Chile&#x27;s history (Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins, Ramón Freire and Augusto Pinochet). Current electoral provisions (as of 2008) forbid the Commander-in-Chief becoming president.

===Spain===

In Spain, the title Captain General (&quot;capitán general&quot;) is the highest military rank, and has since 1999 been exclusively borne by the Spanish monarch (currently Felipe VI).

==Administrative positions==
The term &quot;captain general&quot; can also be used to translate Spanish &quot;capitán general&quot; or Portuguese &quot;capitão-general&quot;, administrative titles used in the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire, especially in the Americas. Each was in charge of a captaincy.

===In the Spanish Empire and Latin America===
&quot;Capitán General&quot; was the military title given to the Spanish military governor of a province of the Spanish Empire, in the colonies usually also the president of the civilian audiencia (court of law).

===In the Portuguese Empire===
In the Portuguese Empire, a &quot;capitão-general&quot; (plural &quot;capitães-generais&quot;) was a governor of a &quot;capitania geral&quot; (captaincy general), with a higher rank than a &quot;capitão-mor&quot; (captain-major) and directly subordinated to the Crown. A captaincy general had a higher category than the simple captaincies (also referred as subaltern captaincies). Sometimes, a captaincy general included one or more subaltern captaincies. The governors of the captaincies general were usually styled &quot;governor and captain-general&quot;, with the term &quot;governor&quot; referring to his administrative role and the term &quot;captain-general&quot; referring to his military role as commander-in-chief of the troops in his captaincy.

The title &quot;capitão-general&quot; was also associated to the roles of Governor-General or Viceroy of Portuguese India and of Brazil. Thus, in Brazil, besides the captains-generals that were governors of the several captaincies general, existed a central captain-general that was the governor-general or Viceroy.

==In fiction==
In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Boromir is described as &quot;Captain-General&quot; of the armies of Gondor.

In the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan, &quot;captain-general&quot; is the highest rank of the Ever Victorious Army of Seanchan, excepting only the rank of &quot;marshal-general&quot;, which may be temporarily assigned to a captain-general given the command of a theatre of war. In addition, captain-general is also the title of both the leader of the Queen&#x27;s Guard of Andor and the head of the Green Ajah of the Aes Sedai.

In the &quot;BattleTech&quot; universe, Captain-General is the title of the military and political leader of the Free Worlds League, one of the major factions in the setting. Since the 25th century, Captains-General have been members of the Marik family in a quasi-hereditary succession. Previously, the post had been an appointed post roughly analogous to the real world position of Roman Dictator, who held power only for also long as a crisis demanding a Captain-General persisted. During the First Succession War, Resolution 288 was passed making the post permanent &quot;for the duration of the crisis&quot;, with no end point delineated. 

In &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Brotherhood&quot;, Cesare Borgia is depicted in the office of Captain General of the Papal Army, a position he did in fact hold along with Gonfalonier of the Church.

In the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; universe (created by Eric Flint), Gustav II Adolf, King of Sweden, is granted the newly created hereditary title of &quot;Captain General of the State of Thuringia&quot; (later known as the State of Thuringia-Franconia) at the end of the first book, entitled &#x27;1632&#x27;. This was a recognition of his authority over Thuringian territory as an integral part of the &quot;Confederated Principalities of Europe&quot;, a Protestant substitute for the Holy Roman Empire which he created, while allowing the Thuringian government to continue to claim that it was a republic and not a monarchy.

In the Warhammer 40,000 universe, the title Captain-General of the Adeptus Custodes is given to the head of the Adeptus Custodes, the elite 10,000 genetically engineered supersoldiers who acted as the God-Emperor of Mankind&#x27;s elite bodyguard, joining him in battle during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy. During the Horus Heresy, the Captain-General was Constantin Valdor, called the &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Spear&quot;. In the aftermath, the Captain-General was granted a position as a High Lord of Terra and ultimate authority over who could approach the Golden Throne, where the Emperor was interred after his battle with the Warmaster Horus.

<text>Creative limitation is the concept of how purposely limiting oneself can actually drive creativity. At a 2013 TED conference, artist Phil Hansen made several remarks concerning the value of limitations, among them that &quot;We need to first be limited in order to become limitless,” and “If you treat the problems as possibilities, life will start to dance with you in the most amazing ways.”

Creative limitation can also be thought of as a way to achieve a novel effect or goal that is not otherwise possible using conventional, readily accessible, methods. Igor Stravinsky used what he called creative limitation with time signatures, by restricting himself from using any, in his composition &#x27;The Rite of Spring&#x27; as well as in alternate aspects of his other musical works.

<text>Wilbur Charles &quot;Weeb&quot; Ewbank ( ; May 6, 1907 – November 17, 1998) was an American professional football coach. He led the Baltimore Colts to consecutive NFL championships in 1958 and 1959 and the New York Jets to victory in Super Bowl III in January 1969. He is the only coach to win a championship in both the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL).

Raised in Indiana, Ewbank attended Miami University in Ohio, where he was a multi-sport star who led his baseball, basketball, and football teams to state championships. He immediately began a coaching career after graduating, working at Ohio high schools between 1928 and 1943, when he entered the U.S. Navy during World War II. While in the military, Ewbank was an assistant to Paul Brown on a service football team at Naval Station Great Lakes outside of Chicago. Ewbank was discharged in 1945 and coached college sports for three years before reuniting with Brown as an assistant with the Cleveland Browns, a professional team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). The Browns won all four AAFC championships. They joined the NFL with the league&#x27;s merger in , winning the championship that year.

Ewbank left the Browns after the 1953 season to become head coach of the Colts, a young NFL team that had struggled in its first season. In 1956, Ewbank brought in quarterback Johnny Unitas, who quickly became a star and helped lead a potent offense that included wide receiver Raymond Berry and fullback Alan Ameche to an NFL championship in 1958. The Colts repeated as champions in 1959, but the team&#x27;s performance slipped over the next three seasons and Ewbank was fired three weeks after their final game of the 1962 season. He was soon picked up by the Jets, a team in the still new AFL. While his first few years were unsuccessful, Ewbank helped build the Jets into a contender after signing Alabama quarterback Joe Namath in 1965. The Jets won the AFL championship in 1968, and then went on to win Super Bowl III in one of the biggest upsets in NFL history.

Ewbank, who was known as a mild-mannered coach who favored simple but well-executed strategies, retired after the 1973 season and settled in Oxford, Ohio. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in , and died twenty years later in Oxford on November 17, 1998, the 30th anniversary of the &quot;&quot;Heidi&quot; Game&quot;.

==Early life and college==

Born in Richmond, Indiana, Ewbank&#x27;s father was a grocer who owned two stores in the small city. He attended Morton High School and played quarterback on the football team, was an outfielder in baseball, and was a member of the basketball team. He captained the football and basketball teams when he was a senior. As a teenager, Ewbank and his father drove to Dayton, Ohio, to see early football star Jim Thorpe and the Canton Bulldogs play. One of his younger brothers could not pronounce &quot;Wilbur&quot; correctly and called him &quot;Weeb&quot;, the nickname he was known by for the rest of his life.

After graduating from high school in 1924, Ewbank attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. He played on the school&#x27;s football team as a quarterback under head coach Chester Pittser. He was also the center fielder on the baseball team and a forward on the basketball team. While Ewbank was small in stature – he was only and weighed – he was one of Miami&#x27;s best athletes. He shared quarterback duties with Eddie Wohlwender on a squad that finished with an 8–1 win–loss record and won the Ohio Athletic Conference championship in 1927, his senior year. Miami&#x27;s baseball team also won the Ohio Conference when he was a sophomore and took the Buckeye Athletic Association title when he was a senior. The basketball team won a state title when he was a junior. Ewbank was a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity while at Miami.

==Coaching career==

Shortly after graduating from Miami in 1928, Ewbank took his first coaching job at Van Wert High School in Van Wert, Ohio, overseeing the football, basketball, and baseball teams. He remained there until 1930, when he moved back to Oxford and took a position coaching football and basketball at McGuffey High School, a private institution run by Miami University. He also taught physical education at Miami. Ewbank took a break from coaching in 1932 to pursue a master&#x27;s degree at Columbia University in New York City and filled in as Miami&#x27;s basketball coach in 1939 after the previous coach left for another job, but otherwise held his coaching positions at McGuffey until 1943. Under his tutelage, the school&#x27;s Green Devils football team had a win–loss record of in thirteen seasons. This included a streak of three undefeated seasons between 1936 and 1939 and one season – 1936 – where the team did not allow any scoring by opponents.

Ewbank joined the U.S. Navy in 1943 as American involvement in World War II intensified. He was assigned for training to Naval Station Great Lakes north of Chicago, where Paul Brown, a former classmate who succeeded him as Miami&#x27;s starting quarterback, was coaching the base football team. Brown had become a successful high school coach in Ohio before being named head football coach at Ohio State University in 1941. At Great Lakes, Ewbank was an assistant to Brown on the football team and coached the basketball team.

Following his discharge from the Navy at the end of the war in 1945, Ewbank became the backfield coach under Charles &quot;Rip&quot; Engle at Brown University. He also was head coach of the basketball team in the 1946–47 season, his only one at Brown.

Ewbank&#x27;s next stop was as head football coach at Washington University in St. Louis for the 1947 and 1948 seasons. Ewbank guided the Bears to a 14–4 record in two seasons, (5–3 in 1947, 9–1 in 1948).

===Cleveland Browns===

Despite his success in St. Louis, Ewbank quit his job when he was given the chance to serve as an assistant under Paul Brown, who by 1949 was coaching the Cleveland Browns, a professional team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Ewbank was brought in to oversee the Browns&#x27; linemen after backfield coach John Brickels quit to take a job at Miami University and tackles coach Bill Edwards left to become the head coach at Vanderbilt University. Ewbank expected to coach quarterbacks, having played the position in college, but Brown insisted that he oversee the tackles. &quot;He knew I&#x27;d have to work very hard at this job and bring a fresh approach&quot;, Ewbank said many years later.

Led by quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley, and ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie, the Browns won the AAFC championship in 1949, their fourth straight title. The AAFC folded after the season, and the Browns were absorbed by the more established National Football League (NFL). The team finished the 1950 season with a 10–2 record and won the NFL championship by beating the Los Angeles Rams. The Browns reached the NFL championship each year between 1951 and 1953, but lost once to the Rams and twice to the Detroit Lions.

===Baltimore Colts===

Ewbank got his first professional head coaching job in early 1954 for the NFL&#x27;s Baltimore Colts, a franchise that had started play the previous year. While it was a step up for Ewbank, Brown encouraged him not to take the job and told him he would not be successful. After Ewbank took the job, Brown accused him of passing information about the Browns&#x27; draft targets to the Colts. Brown had insisted that he stay with the Browns through the 1954 draft, and NFL commissioner Bert Bell agreed. During the draft, Ewbank allegedly sent the names of players Brown liked to the Colts through Baltimore sportswriter John Steadman, including end Raymond Berry, who went on to have a long and successful career.

The Colts struggled in Ewbank&#x27;s first years as head coach, posting records of 3–9 in 1954 and 5–6–1 in 1955. In 1956, however, the team signed quarterback Johnny Unitas after he was cut by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Ewbank brought in Otto Graham to tutor Unitas, who complemented an improving team that included Berry, fullback Alan Ameche, halfback Lenny Moore and defensive back Don Shula.

The Colts began the 1956 season with a 3–3 record, and calls for Ewbank&#x27;s firing intensified – just as they had the previous year. Team owner Carroll Rosenbloom supported him, however, saying that while he had considered a coaching change in the past, Ewbank could stay with the Colts &quot;forever – or until he fouls up&quot;. When he came to Baltimore, Ewbank had promised to create a system like Paul Brown&#x27;s in Cleveland, but said he would need time to turn the team into a winner. The Colts finished 1956 with a 5–7 record.

The team made a turnaround the following year, posting a 7–5 record, but still finished third in the NFL&#x27;s Western Division behind the San Francisco 49ers and Detroit Lions. The team improved further in 1958, winning the Western Division with a 9–3 record and earning a spot in the NFL championship game against the New York Giants. Led by Unitas, Berry and Ameche, the team won the game 23–17 in sudden-death overtime. Often referred to as &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;, the championship was watched by a large national audience on television and helped make professional football one of the most viewed sports in the U.S. Ewbank was named coach of the year by the Associated Press and &quot;United Press International&quot; after the season.

Baltimore finished with a 9–3 record for the second year in a row in 1959 and repeated as NFL champions. The team&#x27;s performance fell off in subsequent years, however, and after posting a 7–7 record in 1962, Rosenbloom fired Ewbank three weeks later. He was succeeded by former player Don Shula, a 33-year-old assistant coach with the Lions.

His legacy as a coach is mixed. Some remember Ewbank as a humble coach who had a good sense of humor and tried to stay out of the spotlight. He could also be harsh with his players, however. Before the 1958 championship game, he gave a speech telling his stars they needed to improve and had barely made the team. Unitas, he said, was obtained &quot;with a seventy-five-cent phone call&quot; and Ameche wasn&#x27;t liked or wanted. Ewbank was not universally liked by his players. Second-string running back Jack Call later said the team won &quot;in spite of, not because of&quot; Ewbank. Other players saw him as overly easygoing, saying that while he was able to build teams up, he became too relaxed once he reached the top. Hall of Famer Raymond Berry stated in his book &quot;All the Moves I Had,&quot; &quot;What it amounts to is that Ewbank knew exactly what he wanted his team to do and how to get them to do it well... Being under Weeb&#x27;s system was the number one reason why Unitas and I had the careers we had.&quot; 

In his autobiography, which he partially dedicated to Weeb Ewbank, Hall of Famer Art Donovan had this to say about his former coach: &quot;When Weeb and Joe Thomas came in and introduced the keying defense—one that depended upon quickness and a players&#x27;s ability to read offenses—man, I was in hog heaven. Weeb Ewbank made Arthur J. Donovan, Jr., a Hall of Fame football player. I loved him for that; I always will love him for that. I can honestly say that Weeb Ewbank became and remains one of the most important, cherished people in my life. With that out of the way, I can also honestly say that Weeb was a screwball who held insane grudges, concentrated too much on what I considered the unimportant aspects of the game, thought he was smarter than God, and deep down inside was one mean sonofabitch.&quot;

Ewbank left as the longest tenured head coach in the history of the Colts (112), with Ted Marchibroda passing him three decades later.

===New York Jets===

A five-man syndicate led by Sonny Werblin bought the New York Titans franchise of the American Football League (AFL), an NFL competitor, as part of bankruptcy proceedings in 1963. Shortly thereafter, the team changed its name to the New York Jets and hired Ewbank in April as its head coach and general manager. Ewbank took over a team that had not had a winning record in its first three years of existence and hired a coaching staff that included Chuck Knox, Walt Michaels, and Clive Rush, all future head coaches. When he was hired, Ewbank said he had a five-year plan to succeed in Baltimore, and &quot;I don&#x27;t see why we can&#x27;t build a winner here in five years.&quot;

While the Jets won their first three games with Ewbank as coach, his first several years were unsuccessful. The team, meanwhile, had to deal with numerous logistical issues stemming from its second-tier status among New York&#x27;s sports teams. The Jets switched stadiums from the Polo Grounds in Manhattan after the 1963 season to the new Shea Stadium in Queens, but shared it with baseball&#x27;s New York Mets. Concerned about possible damage to the stadium&#x27;s natural turf, the Mets would not allow the Jets to practice at Shea, forcing the team to hold practices at the Rikers Island jail complex. The Jets posted 5–8–1 records for three consecutive seasons (1963–1965).

Despite limited on-field success in Ewbank&#x27;s first years, the Jets began to put the pieces of a winning team in place. In 1964, they outbid cross-town NFL rival New York Giants for Matt Snell, a top running back prospect out of Ohio State. Linebacker Larry Grantham became a consistent All-Pro selection and safety Dainard Paulson had 12 interceptions in 1964, which remains a team record. An even bigger coup came in 1965, when the Jets signed Joe Namath, a star quarterback at Alabama under coach Bear Bryant. The St. Louis Cardinals selected Namath as the twelfth overall pick of the NFL draft, but Namath later said he chose the Jets in part because he got along with Ewbank and was impressed by how he had developed Unitas while with the Colts.

Namath quickly became a star for the Jets. The team improved to 6–6–2 in 1966 and 8–5–1 in 1967, when Namath became the first to throw for more than 4,000 yards in a single season. By 1968, Ewbank&#x27;s team was becoming one of the top teams in the AFL. All of its main starters returned from the year before, and the Jets brought in All-Pro guard Bob Talamini from the Houston Oilers. The Jets started with a 3–2 record, but won eight of nine to finish the regular season 11–3 and win the AFL East Division by four games. One of the Jets&#x27; losses in 1968 was on the road in mid-November against the Oakland Raiders that later came to be known as the &quot;Heidi&quot; Game. After Jim Turner kicked a field goal for the Jets that gave them a 32–29 lead with just over a minute left to play, NBC cut away from the game to a scheduled broadcast of the children&#x27;s movie &quot;Heidi&quot;. The Raiders went on to win the game by scoring two touchdowns in the final 42 seconds. Ewbank&#x27;s wife Lucy called the locker room to congratulate him on the win, only to learn the team had lost.

The Jets&#x27; first-place finish in their division in 1968 set up a rematch with the Raiders – the defending AFL champions and winners of the AFL West – for the league championship. Namath threw three touchdowns as the Jets won 27–23, putting them through to the third World Championship game, a matchup between the winner of the AFL and NFL now known as Super Bowl III. The Jets were 19-point underdogs to the Colts, who had continued to succeed after Ewbank&#x27;s departure with Don Shula as head coach and the services of Unitas as quarterback, although the 1968 season saw Earl 
Morrall play as the starter due to a sore elbow suffered by Unitas, and Morrall won the league MVP that year. Nevertheless, Namath publicly guaranteed a Jets win before the game, which rankled Ewbank. Ewbank liked that the Colts were favored, thinking it would make them complacent, and did not want to agitate them by boasting about the Jets&#x27; chances.

Ewbank and the Jets played an unconventional game against the Colts, opting for an uncharacteristically conservative strategy in part because star wideout Don Maynard was nursing a hamstring injury. Also on film, the Jets noticed the Colts while talented on defense, were very predictable. They did not shift out of a defense once it was called from the sideline. So Namath called most of the plays at the line of scrimmage after viewing the Colts&#x27; defense instead of calling the offensive plays in the huddle. The tactic worked against the Colts, and the Jets built a 16–0 lead going into the game&#x27;s fourth quarter by relying on Snell&#x27;s running and Namath&#x27;s ability to complete short passes against a steady Colts&#x27; blitz. Snell had 121 yards on 30 carries. The Jets&#x27; defense, meanwhile, held back a Colts offense that scored 460 points throughout the team&#x27;s 15–1 regular- and post-season record up to that point. New York intercepted four Baltimore passes, three thrown by Earl Morrall and one by Unitas, who entered the game in the second half. The Jets won the game 16–7, aided by Ewbank&#x27;s familiarity with many of the Colts&#x27; players and strategies.

The Jets had a 10–4 record in 1969, but lost a divisional playoff to the Kansas City Chiefs. Ewbank was named the AFL&#x27;s coach of the year after the season, but the team did not post a winning record in any of the following four years. In December 1972, Ewbank announced that he would retire as head coach after the 1973 season, saying he wanted to spend more time with his wife. He continued as general manager, however, and was named the team vice president. Charley Winner, the former coach of the St. Louis Cardinals and the husband of Ewbank&#x27;s daughter Nancy, was appointed as his replacement in early 1973. The 1973 Jets season is the subject of the book &quot;The Last Season of Weeb Ewbank&quot; by Paul Zimmerman. After the team lost seven of its first eight games in 1974, Ewbank resigned as vice president and general manager. He agreed to coach quarterbacks at Columbia University in 1975.

==Later life and honors==

Ewbank moved back to Oxford in retirement and wrote a book in 1977 called &quot;Football Greats&quot;. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but said later that year that he was glad to be out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team&#x27;s failures, and the sport had become too violent.

Ewbank&#x27;s coaching style was laid-back but efficient, combining his mild personality with an orderliness inherited from Paul Brown. &quot;Weeb combined a low-key style with a flair for the most dramatic of accomplishments&quot;, former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in 1998. &quot;He led two of the legendary teams during the era of pro football&#x27;s greatest growth. But he preferred to stay in the background and let the players take the credit.&quot; He favored well-practiced execution of a limited number of plays over complicated offensive and defensive systems. Paul Brown &quot;had the exact same approach: Don&#x27;t do too much, but what you do, execute it flawlessly&quot;, Raymond Berry said in 2013, adding that the Colts&#x27; 1958 championship team had only six passing plays.

Ewbank is the only man to coach two professional football teams to championships, and the only man to win the NFL championship, the AFL championship and a Super Bowl. His regular-season career record in the NFL and AFL was 130–129–7, and his playoff record was 4–1. Ewbank was selected as the head coach on the AFL All-Time Team in 1970. In addition to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he was inducted into the Miami University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1969, the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1974 and the Talawanda School District Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999. He also won the Walter Camp Distinguished American Award in 1987 and was inducted into the Jets&#x27; Ring of Honor in 2010.

Ewbank suffered a dislocated hip in the aftermath of the Jets&#x27; 1968 AFL championship game win, and had other health issues in his later years. He broke his leg and had two hip replacements in the 1990s. He also had myasthenia in his right eye. Ewbank died at 91 on November 17, 1998, the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Heidi Game&quot;, after suffering from heart problems. He and his wife Lucy had three daughters, Luanne, Nancy and Jan. His daughter Nancy married Charley Winner.

<doc id="420031" wikidata="Q6687784" url="?curid=420031" title="Louis Marx and Company">
<text>Louis Marx and Company was an American toy manufacturer in business from 1919 to 1980. They made many types of toys including tin toys, toy soldiers, toy guns, action figures, dolls, toy cars and model trains. Some of their notable toys are Rock&#x27;em Sock&#x27;em Robots, Big Wheel tricycles, Disney branded dollhouses and playsets based on TV shows like &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. Its products were often imprinted with the slogan &quot;One of the many Marx toys, have you all of them?&quot;

==Logo and offerings==
The Marx logo was the letters &quot;MAR&quot; in a circle with a large X through it, resembling a railroad crossing sign. As the X sometimes goes unseen, Marx toys were, and are still today, often misidentified as &quot;Mar&quot; toys. Reputedly, because of this name confusion, the Italian diecast toy company Martoys, after two years of production, changed its name to Bburago in 1976. Although the Marx name is now largely forgotten except by toy collectors, several of the products that the company developed remain strong icons in popular culture, including Rock&#x27;em Sock&#x27;em Robots, introduced in 1964, and its best-selling sporty Big Wheel tricycle, one of the most popular toys of the 1970s. The Big Wheel, which was introduced in 1969, is enshrined in the National Toy Hall of Fame.

Marx&#x27;s toys included tinplate buildings, tin toys, toy soldiers, playsets, toy dinosaurs, mechanical toys, toy guns, action figures, dolls, dollhouses, toy cars and trucks, and HO-scale and O-scale trains. Marx also made several models of typewriters for children. Marx&#x27;s less expensive toys were extremely common in dime stores, and its larger, costlier toys were staples for catalog and department store retailers such as Eaton&#x27;s, Gamages, Sears, W.T. Grant, Montgomery Ward, J. C. Penney and Spiegel especially around Christmas. In pre-WWII America, it was common for Kresge&#x27;s and Woolworth&#x27;s to place yearly orders with Marx for at least $1 million each. 

==History==

Founded in August 1919 in New York City by Louis Marx and his brother David, the company&#x27;s basic aim was to &quot;give the customer more toy for less money,&quot; and stressed that &quot;quality is not negotiable&quot; – two values that made the company highly successful. Initially, after working for Ferdinand Strauss, Marx, born in 1894, was a distributor with no manufacturing capacity. All product production would have to be contracted out for the first few years. Marx raised money as a middleman, studying available products, finding ways to make them durable but less expensive, and then closing sales. Enough funding was raised to purchase tooling from previous employer Strauss for two obsolete tin toys – the Alabama Coon Jigger and Zippo the Climbing Monkey. With subtle changes, Marx was able to turn these toys into hits, selling more than eight million of each within two years. Another success was the &quot;Mouse Orchestra&quot; with tinplate mice on piano, fiddle, snare, and one conducting.

Marx listed six qualities he believed were needed for a successful toy: familiarity, surprise, skill, play value, comprehensibility and sturdiness. By 1922, both Louis and David Marx were millionaires. Initially, Marx reevaluated and produced a few original toys by predicting the hits and manufacturing them less expensively than the competition. The yo-yo is an example: although Marx is sometimes wrongly credited with inventing the toy, the company was quick to market its own version. During the 1920s, about 100 million Marx yo-yos were sold.

Unlike most companies, Marx&#x27;s revenues &quot;grew&quot; during the Great Depression, with the establishment of production facilities in economically hard-hit industrial areas of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and England. By 1937, the company had more than $3.2 million in assets ($42.6 million in 2005 dollars), with debt of just over $500,000. He was declared &quot;Toy King of the World&quot; in October 1937 in a London newspaper. By 1938, Marx employed 500 workers in the Dudley factory and 4000 in the American factories. Marx was the largest toy manufacturer in the world by the 1950s. &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; in January 1946 had declared him &quot;Toy King&quot; suggesting at least $20 million in sales for 1941, but again in 1955, a &quot;Time Magazine&quot; article also proclaimed Louis Marx &quot;the Toy King,&quot; and that year, the company had about $50 million in sales. Marx was the star article of the magazine with his picture displayed on the front cover. Marx was the initial inductee in the Toy Industry Hall of Fame, and his plaque proclaimed him &quot;The Henry Ford of the toy industry.&quot;

At its peak, Louis Marx and Company operated three manufacturing plants in the United States: Erie, Pennsylvania, Girard, Pennsylvania, and Glen Dale, West Virginia. The Erie plant was the oldest and largest, while the Girard plant, acquired in 1934 with the purchase of Girard Model Works, produced toy trains, and the Glen Dale plant produced toy vehicles. Additionally, Marx operated numerous plants overseas, and in 1955 five percent of the toys Marx sold in the US were made in Japan. In 1952 Marx Company stationary listed operations in: Mexico, London England, Swansea Wales, Durbin South Africa, Sydney Australia, Toronto Canada, São Paulo Brazil and Paris France. By 1959, the demand for American toys was a billion dollars a year.

Marx enjoyed his wealth at his 20.5-acre estate in the wealthy suburb of Scarsdale, north of New York City. The estate featured a 25-room Georgian mansion, a barn and stables for horses he raised and other amenities. The estate was sold to a developer after his death in 1982, to make way for some 29 homes.

== Playsets ==
Among the most enduring Marx creations were a long series of boxed &quot;playsets&quot; throughout the 1950s and 1960s based on television shows and historical events. These include &quot;Roy Rogers Rodeo Ranch&quot; and Western Town, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Davy Crockett at the Alamo&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;The Rifleman Ranch&quot;, &quot;The Lone Ranger Ranch&quot;, &quot;Battle of the Blue and Grey&quot;, &quot;The Revolutionary War&quot; (including &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot;), &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;The Battle of the Little Big Horn&quot;, &quot;Arctic Explorer&quot;, &quot;Ben Hur&quot;, &quot;Fort Apache&quot;, &quot;Zorro&quot;, &quot;Battleground&quot;, &quot;Tom Corbett Training Academy&quot;, &quot;Prehistoric Times&quot;, and many others.

Playsets included highly detailed plastic figures and accessories, many with some of the toy world&#x27;s finest tin lithography. A Marx playset box was invariably bursting with contents, yet very few were ever priced above the average of $4–$7. Greatly expanded sets, such as &quot;Giant Ben Hur&quot; sold for $10 to $12 in the early 1960s. This pricing formula adhered to the Marx policy of &quot;more for less&quot; and made the entire series attainable to most customers for many years. Original sets are highly prized by baby boomer collectors to this day.

Marx produced dollhouses from the 1920s into the 1970s. In the late 1940s Marx began to produce metal lithographed dollhouses with plastic furniture (at the same time it began producing service stations). These dollhouse were variations of the Colonial style. An instant sensation was the &quot;Disney&quot; house, featured in the 1949 Sears catalogue. The popularity of Marx dollhouses gained momentum, and up to 150,000 Marx dollhouses were produced in the 1950s. Two house sizes were available, with two different size furniture to match; the most popular in the 1/2&quot; to 1&#x27; scale, and the larger 3/4&quot; to 1&#x27; scale. An L-shaped ranch hit the market in 1953, followed by a split-level of 1958. Curiously, in the early 1960s a dollhouse with a bomb shelter was sold briefly.

As the space race heated up, Marx playsets reflected the obsession with all things extraterrestrial such as &quot;Rex Mars&quot;, &quot;Moon Base&quot;, &quot;Cape Canaveral&quot;, and &quot;IGY International Geophysical Year&quot;, among other space themed sets. In a similar theme, Marx also capitalized on the robot craze, producing the Big Loo, &quot;Your friend from the Moon&quot;, and the popular Rock&#x27;em Sock&#x27;em Robots action game.

In 1963, Marx began making a series of beatnik style plastic figurines called the Nutty Mads, which included some almost psychedelic creations, such as &quot;Donald the Demon&quot; — a half-duck, half-madman driving a miniature car. These were similar to the counterculture characters of other companies introduced about a year before, such as Revell&#x27;s &quot;Rat Fink &quot;by &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Ed Roth, or Hawk Models&#x27; &quot;Weird-Oh&#x27;s&quot;, designed by Bill Campbell.

==Toy train sets==

Louis Marx and Company entered a five-year selling contract with Girard Model Works in 1929 and in 1932 contracted Woods/Girard to exclusively produce all his trains and toys. The trains were called Joy Line. These were small four inch tinplate cars with a small windup or electric engine. Marx acquired the Woods company in 1934, although his brand appears on floor trains, trolleys, Joy Line and the M10000 sets, years before the acquisition. This was the beginning of Marx trains.
In 1934 Marx produced its first newly designed model train set, the streamlined Union Pacific M-10000. The streamlined Marx Commodore Vanderbilt was issued in 1935 with new 6 inch tinplate cars. The ever popular Marx Canadian Pacific 3000 appeared in 1936 in Canada, while the articulated Marx Mercury was introduced to America.
The success of Marx &quot;027&quot; train line forced other manufacturers to follow suit in size and fashion. Marx continued to make tinplate train sets until 1972. Plastic sets began in 1952 and only plastic sets were made after 1973, until the end of the company in 1975.

===Overtaking Lionel===

Even though Marx trains never held the prestige of Lionel&#x27;s trains, they were able to outsell them for most of the late fifties. While Lionel&#x27;s top mid-fifties toy sales were some $32 million, the Marx&#x27;s 1955 toy sales were $50 million. When it comes to quality and quantity, Louis Marx and Company is considered &quot;the most important producer of inexpensive American toy trains&quot;.

== Toy soldier sets ==
Marx is well known by collectors and some kids for making good quality toy soldiers. These sets were often known as &quot;Battleground&quot;, offering Germans and Americans. Though there also were Pacific sets, which had Japanese soldiers and combat planes, such as the Zero.

Some of their most popular sets were &quot;Navarone&quot; (based on the film), &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;, &quot;The Alamo&quot; (basing on the film) and more sets based in movies and series, such as The Gallant Men, specially in John Wayne and the films he was in.

==Vehicles==
=== Pre-war ===
Cast iron was unwieldy, heavy, and not well-suited to proper detail or model proportions and gradually it was replaced by pressed tin. Marx offered a variety of tin vehicles, from carts to dirigibles — the company would lithograph toy patterns on large sheets of tinplated steel. These would then be stamped, die-cut, folded, and assembled. Marx was long known for its car and truck toys, and the company would take small steps to renew the popularity of an old product. In the 1920s, an old truck toy that was falling behind in sales was loaded with plastic ice cubes and the company had a new hit. The Honeymoon Express, a wind-up train on track with a plane circling above, later became the Mickey Mouse Express and then the Subway Express. Popeye pushing a barrel of spinach eventually became the 1940 Tidy Tim Street Cleaner and Charlie McCarthy in his &quot;Benzine Buggy&quot;.

Some of the most popular vehicles were Crazy Cars like the Funny Flivver of 1926 — another was the eloping &quot;Joy Riders&quot;. One earlier and much sought after tin toy was an open Amos &#x27;n Andy Ford Model T four door, as well as another Model T with driver apparently on a European jaunt and hauling a trunk at the rear with the names of various European cities on it. This model was produced in a variety of liveries. Lithographed tin tanks, airplanes, police motorcycles, tractors, trains, luxury liners, and rocket ships were all produced in bright colors. One toy, the Tricky Taxi seems to have had origins in a Heinrich Muller toy from Nuremberg in Germany. The 1935 G-Man pursuit car was possibly the largest vehicle Marx ever made at 14½ inches long. Even doll houses, gasoline stations, parking lots and street scenes were made in tin. That Marx was doing well even in the depression is shown by the date of introduction of their well-known motorcycle cop toy — 1933.

A number of tinplate trucks, buses and vans were made in the 1930s, particularly in the latter part of the decade. Trucks were made, particularly Studebakers, in a variety of colors and formats, and often advertised in Sears catalogues. These included several different series like the truck hauling five tinplate &quot;stake bed&quot; trailers, a &quot;dumping&quot; garbage truck, many variations on larger truck &quot;car carriers&quot; hauling different vehicles, and a set of completely chromed trucks. Metal gas and fire station sets could also be purchased on which to play with the vehicles more fully.

===Lumar toys===
&quot;Lumar Lines&quot; was another name used for a line of floor operated tin toys, trucks, vehicles, trains beginning in the early 1930s, in the United States and England. Lumar Lines passenger and freight floor trains were produced from 1939 through 1941. Production continued after WWII with the &quot;Friendship&quot; train that honored the real train that had sent supplies from the United States to England in 1947. The &quot;standard gauge&quot; floor train was first marketed in 1933 under the &quot;Girard Model Works&quot; moniker.

=== Plastics ===
Louis Marx and Company was an early player in the plastic toy field.
After World War II Marx introduced more vehicles, taking advantage of molding techniques with various plastics. Pressed tin and steel remained in the form of Buicks, Nashes, or other semi-futuristic sedans, race cars, and trucks that didn&#x27;t replicate any actual vehicles. One car was a tin Buick-like wood-bodied station wagon. These were often of various larger sizes, ranging from 10 to 20 inches long. Some vehicles were difficult to identify as Marx; one had to look for the small &quot;X-in-O&quot; logo, usually on the lower rear of the vehicle. Often there were no markings on the base.

More and more, however, plastic models appeared in a variety of sizes, three series of which are significant. The first series, in 1950, included inexpensive 4-inch replicas of early 1950s cars, both foreign and domestic, like Talbot, Volkswagen, Jaguar, Studebaker, Ford, Chevrolet, GMC Van and others. They were supplied as accessories for Marx&#x27; large tinplate gas station or rail station toys. These were molded of polystyrene and came with die-cast metal wheel-and-axle combinations. The second series was identical, except for updating the cars to 1954 models. The third series, released in 1959, included updated models of 1959 cars, only these were molded in polyethylene and had polyethylene wheels/axles, and were supplied with an updated 1959 gas station. The Marx 1959 gas station cars were downsized and simplified versions of AMT and Jo-Han flywheel models.

In the early 1950s, one Marx product line showed a greater sophistication in toy offerings. The &quot;Fix All&quot; series was introduced, whose main attraction was larger plastic vehicles (about 14 inches long) that could be taken apart and put back together with included tools and equipment. A 1953 Pontiac convertible (erroneously identified on packaging as a &quot;sedan&quot;), and a 1953 Mercury Monterey station wagon which featured an articulated drive-line. Everything from the pistons to the crankshaft to the rear axle gears were visible through clear plastic, and wood-trim decals for the sides finished off this marvelous model. A very large 1953 Chrysler convertible, a 1953 Jaguar XK120 roadster, a WWII-era Willys Jeep, a Dodge-ish utility truck, a tow truck, a tractor, a larger scale motorcycle, a helicopter, and a couple of airplanes were all part of the &quot;Fix All&quot; series. The cars&#x27; boxes boasted features like &quot;Over 50 parts&quot; and &quot;For a real mechanic!&quot; As an example, the tow truck came with cast metal box and open wrenches, an adjustable end wrench, a two-piece jack, gas can, hammer, screwdriver, and fire extinguisher. The Jeep came with a star wrench, a screw jack and working lights.

Since the 1950s, Marx had factories in different locations. Among these was a factory in Swansea, Wales, which made a variety of toys for the British market. Example of some of the plastic cars made there were Motorway Station Wagons (which looked like late 1950s U.S. Fords), a remote control 1950 Pontiac, and a Ford Zephyr wagon police car. The Marx factory was in the same industrial estate as the Corgi Toys factory.

=== The Marx Hudson 13&quot; toy ===
In 1948, the Hudson Motor Car Company made a detailed in-house promotional model of its &quot;step down&quot; 4-door Commodore for exclusive use by their dealers. The model was exceptionally well done, and came in four authentic two-tone color combos, but sadly, was never available on the retail market. Some sources erroneously insist this model was made by Marx, but in fact, it was Hudson&#x27;s own production effort, manufactured, produced and assembled in Hudson&#x27;s main factory.

Soon after, Marx fabricated an injection mold of Hudson&#x27;s more precise model and marketed this simplified version as a more inexpensive mechanized toy. It was available as a police car in grass green or a fire chief car in bright red. The clear windows of the original were replaced with a single, stamped metal piece with lithographed images of cartoonish policemen or firemen. The police version even had a shotgun protruding through the windshield. With batteries an oversize roof light lit up and the gun made a corny rat-a-tat sound.

Not one of Marx&#x27;s more successful toys, their Hudson was large and unwieldy, being aimed at pre-teens. After newer, more modern American cars appeared, the Marx Hudson quickly became obsolete, resulting in an oversupply on retail toy shelves. By the mid-1960s they were still easy to find across America and one could usually be bought for about a dollar – a nice discount from the original $4.95 list price.

A well-preserved Marx police or fire chief Hudson with original box will still bring from $50 to $100 in today&#x27;s market, depending on condition. An authentic Hudson promotional still brings around $2,000. Over the years, professional Hudson experts have upgraded Marx versions to look somewhat like the original promotional – these usually bring from $600 to $800.

=== Other autos ===

Marx also made Studebaker and Packard vehicles especially through the 1930s and 1940s. They often appeared with the Studebaker badge logo in a very promotional way, though evidence of Marx as a promotional provider is uncertain. One of Marx&#x27;s later Studebakers was an Avanti with a dented fender that could be replaced with a &#x27;repaired&#x27; one, which was odd, as the real Avanti had a fiberglass body – and would not dent. A 1948 Packard Fire Chief&#x27;s car was one that looked, in theme, much like the step-down Hudson.

Into the 1960s and 1970s, Marx still made some cars, though increasingly these were made in Japan and Hong Kong. Especially impressive were two-foot long &quot;Big Bruiser&quot; tow trucks with Ford C-Series cabs and &quot;Big Job&quot; dump trucks, a T-bucket hot rod of the same large size and some foreign cars like a Jaguar SS100, which was later reissued. Marx made some 1/25 scale slot cars, like a Jaguar XKE remote control convertible. Into the 1970s, Marx jumped on several bandwagons, for example, plastic pull string funny cars of typical 1:25 scale model size, but this was not quick enough to save the company.

Marx sometimes joined with European toy makers, putting their name on traditional European toys. For example, about 1968, Solido and Marx made a deal to sell these French metal die cast models in the U.S. with the Marx name added to the box. The boxes were, for the most part, regular red Solido boxes with the Marx &quot;x-in-o&quot; logo and &quot;by Marx&quot; directly below the Solido script. Nowhere on the cars did the Marx name appear.

=== The small scale market ===
During the 1960s Marx offered its Elegant Models, a collection of Matchbox-like 1930s to 1950s style race cars in red and yellow boxes. Also offered were airplanes, trucks, and, in the same series, metal animals boxed in a similar style. Some of the vehicles from this era were marketed under the Linemar or Collectoy names.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Marx tried to compete not only with Matchbox, but with Mattel Hot Wheels, making small cars with thin axle, low-friction wheels. These were marketed, not too successfully, under a few different names. One of the most common was &quot;Mini Marx Blazers&quot; with &quot;Super Speed Wheels&quot;. The cars were made in a slightly smaller scale than Hot Wheels, often 1:66 to about 1:70. Proportions of these cars were simple, but accurate, though details were somewhat lacking. Some cars, however, included such niceties as a driver behind the wheel. While some of the earlier toys had a simpler Tootsietoy style single casting, newer cars were colored in bright chrome paints with decals and fast axle wheels. Tires were plain black with thin whitewalls.

==Linemar toys==

Linemar toys was the trade name under which Marx toys were manufactured in Japan, then sold in the United States and other countries. The reason to make Linemar toys in Japan was to keep costs down. Under the Linemar name, Marx produced The Flintstones and other licensed toy vehicles. The Linemar line also included airplanes that were produced in the colors of KLM, Pan Am and other airlines. The trademark for Linemar toys is owned by The Juna Group, LLC.

==Decline ==
===Quaker Oats-Marx era===
In 1972, Marx sold his company to the Quaker Oats Company for $54 million ($ in dollars) and retired at the age of 76. Quaker also owned the Fisher-Price brand, but struggled with Marx. Quaker had hoped Marx and Fisher-Price would have synergy, but the companies&#x27; sales patterns were too different. The company was also faulted for largely ignoring the trend towards electronic toys in the early 1970s. In late 1975, Quaker closed the plants in Erie and Girard, and in early 1976, Quaker sold its struggling Marx division to the British conglomerate Dunbee-Combex-Marx, who had bought the former Marx UK subsidiary in 1967.

===Dunbee-Combex-Marx era===
Like many toy makers, Dunbee-Combex-Marx struggled with high interest rates and an economic slowdown. It collapsed. By 1979, most US operations were ceased, and by 1980, the last Marx plant closed in West Virginia. The Marx brand disappeared and Dunbee-Combex-Marx filed for bankruptcy. The Marx assets were liquidated by Chemical Bank in the early 1980s, with the trademarks and most toy molds purchased by Jay Horowitz of American Plastic Equipment, who later transferred all rights to American Plastic Equipment&#x27;s subsidiary, American Classic Toys.

==Toy legacy==
Some popular Marx tooling is still used today to produce toys and trains. A company called Marx Trains, Inc. produced lithographed tin trains, both of original design and based on former Louis Marx patterns. Plastic O scale train cars and scenery using former Marx molds were previously produced by MDK and are now marketed under the &quot;K-Line by Lionel&quot; brand name. Model Power produces HO scale trains from old Marx molds. The Big Wheel rolls on, as a property of Alpha International, Inc. (Cedar Rapids, Iowa), which has been acquired by J. Lloyd International, Inc. also of Cedar Rapids. Mattel reintroduced Rock&#x27;em Sock&#x27;em Robots around 2000 (albeit at a smaller size than the original). Marx&#x27;s toy soldiers and other plastic figures are in production today in Mexico, and in the US for the North American market and are mostly targeted at collectors, although they sometimes appear on the general consumer market. 

In 2001, a longtime collector of Marx toys, Francis Turner, established the Marx Toy Museum in Moundsville, West Virginia, near the old Glen Dale plant, to display toys from his collection and inform visitors about the history and output of the company and its founder. However, over its decade and a half of operation, the museum&#x27;s income could not sustain maintenance of a physical facility, and it was closed permanently on June 30, 2016. The collection has only been shown on loan to other museums and through a &quot;virtual museum&quot; website, which was on sale since the start of the year 2021.

In 2019, Jay Horowitz of American Classic Toys, and current rights holder of the Marx brands, entered into an exclusive license agreement with The Juna Group to represent the Marx brands in all categories outside of toys and playthings, worldwide. In 2021, the Marx brands were sold to The Nacelle Co.

<text>The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines religiosity as: &quot;Religiousness; religious feeling or belief. [...] Affected or excessive religiousness&quot;. Different scholars have seen this concept as broadly about religious orientations and degrees of involvement or commitment. The contrast between &quot;religious&quot; and &quot;&quot; (superficially religious) and the concept of &quot;strengthening&quot; faith
suggest differences in the intensity of religiosity.

Scholars attempt to measure religiosity at the levels of individuals or groups, but differ as to what behaviors constitute religiosity. Sociologists of religion have observed that an individual&#x27;s experience, beliefs, sense of belonging, and general behavior often are not congruent with their religious behavior, since there is much diversity in how one can be religious or not. Problems arise in measuring religiosity. For instance, measures of variables such as church attendance produce different results when different methods are used, such as traditional surveys as opposed to time-use surveys.

==Components==
The measurement of religiosity is hampered by the difficulties involved in defining what is meant by the term and what components it includes. Numerous studies have explored the different components of religiosity, with most finding some distinction between religious beliefs/doctrine, religious practice, and spirituality. When religiosity is measured, it is important to specify which aspects of religiosity are being discussed.

Numerous studies have explored the different components of human religiosity. What most have found (often using factor analysis) is that there are multiple dimensions. For instance, Marie Cornwall and colleagues identify six dimensions of religiosity based on the understanding that there are at least three components to religious behavior: knowing (cognition in the mind), feeling (effect to the spirit), and doing (behavior of the body). For each of these components of religiosity, there were two cross classifications, resulting in the six dimensions:
*Cognition
**traditional orthodoxy
**particularistic orthodoxy
*Affect
**Palpable
**Tangible
*Behavior
**religious behavior
**religious participation

Sociologists have differed over the exact number of components of religiosity. Charles Glock&#x27;s five-dimensional approach (Glock, 1972: 39) was among the first of its kind in the field of sociology of religion. Other sociologists adapted Glock&#x27;s list to include additional components (see for example, a six component measure by Mervin F. Verbit). Other researchers have found different dimensions, generally ranging from four to twelve components.

What most measures of religiosity find is that there is at least some distinction between religious doctrine, religious practice, and spirituality. Most dimensions of religiosity are correlated, meaning people who often attend church services (practice dimension) are also likely to score highly on the belief and spirituality dimensions. Nonetheless, an individual&#x27;s scores on a measure of religiosity can vary between dimensions; they may not score high on all dimensions or low on all dimensions.

For example, an individual could accept truthfulness of the Bible (belief dimension), but never attend a church or even belong to an organized religion (practice dimension). Another example is an individual who did not accept orthodox Christian doctrines (belief dimension) but did attend a charismatic worship service (practice dimension) in order to develop his/her sense of oneness with the divine (spirituality dimension). A different individual might disavow all doctrines associated with organized religions (belief dimension), not affiliate with an organized religion or attend religious services (practice dimension), and at the same time be strongly committed to a higher power and feel that the connection with that higher power is ultimately relevant (spirituality dimension). These are explanatory examples of the broadest dimensions of religiosity and may not be reflected in specific religiosity measures.

Demographic studies often show a wide diversity of religious beliefs, belonging, and practices in both religious and non-religious populations. For instance, among Americans who are not religious and not seeking religion, 68% believe in God, 12% are atheists, 17% are agnostics. Also, 18% self-identify as religious, 37% self-identify as spiritual but not religious, and 42% self-identify as neither spiritual nor religious. Furthermore, 21% pray every day and 24% pray once a month. Global studies on religion also show diversity.

Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have established that the common assumption of &quot;religious congruence&quot; is rarely accurate. &quot;Religious congruence&quot; is the view that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual&#x27;s mind, or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs, or that religious beliefs are chronologically linear and stable across different contexts. People&#x27;s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent, like their ideas in all other domains of culture and life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture. Mark Chaves gives the following examples of religious incongruence: &quot;Observant Jews may not believe what they say in their Sabbath prayers. Christian ministers may not believe in God. And people who regularly dance for rain don&#x27;t do it in the dry season.&quot;

==Difficulties in measurement==
===Polls and surveys===
Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have shown that congruence between an individual&#x27;s beliefs, attitudes, and behavior concerning religion and irreligion is rare.

The reliability of any poll results, in general and specifically on religion, can be questioned due numerous factors such as:
* there have been very low response rates for polls since the 1990s
* polls consistently fail to predict government election outcomes, which signifies that polls in general do not capture the actual views of the population
* biases in wording or topic affect how people respond to polls
* polls categorize people based on limited choices
* polls often generalize broadly
* polls have shallow or superficial choices, which complicate expressing people&#x27;s complex religious beliefs and practices
* interviewer and respondent fatigue is very common

Researchers also note that an estimated 20–40% of the population changes their self-reported religious affiliation/identity over time due to numerous factors and that usually it is their answers on surveys that change, not necessarily their religious practices or beliefs.

In general, polling numbers are difficult to interpret and should not be taken at face value, since people in different cultural contexts may interpret the same questions differently.

Responses to Gallup polls on religiosity vary based on how the question is worded. Since the early 2000s, Gallup has routinely asked about complex topics like belief in God using three different question wordings and they have consistently received three different percentages in the responses.

==== In the United States ====
Two major surveys in the United States, the General Social Survey (GSS) and the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), have consistently produced discrepancies between their demographic estimates on religion that amount to 8% and growing. This is due to a few factors, such as differences in question wording that impact participant responses due to &quot;social desirability bias&quot;; the lumping of very different groups (atheist, agnostics, nothing in particular) into singular categories (e.g., &quot;no religion&quot; vs &quot;nothing in particular&quot;); and differences in the representativeness of the samples (e.g., &quot;nones&quot; are more politically moderate in the GSS sample than in the CCES sample, while Protestants are more conservative in the CCES sample than in the GSS sample).

The 2008 American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) found a difference between how people identify and what people believe. While only 0.7% of U.S. adults identified as atheist, 2.3% said there is no such thing as a god. Only 0.9% identified as agnostic, but 10.0% said there is either no way to know if a god exists or they weren&#x27;t sure. Another 12.1% said there is a higher power but no personal god. In total, only 15.0% identified as Nones or No Religion, but 24.4% did not believe in the traditional concept of a personal god. The conductors of the study concluded, &quot;The historic reluctance of Americans to self-identify in this manner or use these terms seems to have diminished. Nevertheless ... the level of under-reporting of these theological labels is still significant ... many millions do not subscribe fully to the theology of the groups with which they identify.&quot;

According to a Pew Research Center study in 2009, only 5% of the total US population did not have a belief in a god. Out of all those without a belief in a god, only 24% self-identified as &quot;atheist&quot;, while 15% self-identified as &quot;agnostic&quot;, 35% self-identified as &quot;nothing in particular&quot;, and 24% identified with a religious tradition.

Gallup&#x27;s editor-in-chief, Frank Newport, argues that numbers on surveys may give an incomplete picture. In his view, declines in religious affiliation or belief in God on surveys may not actually reflect real declines, but instead increased honesty to interviewers on spiritual matters due to viewpoints previously seen as deviant becoming more socially acceptable.

=== Censuses ===
Questions of religion are &quot;marginal&quot; in censuses, usually optional, and are left out of most censuses in most countries. Despite attempts to standardize wording, census phrasing of the religion question have not been consistent over time or from country to country, with responders understanding them in 3 different ways. Censuses aim to enumerate religious communities, not religious faith, and &quot;as long as the censuses in more than half of the world do not ask about religion it will not be possible to tell even within the closest million the size of the different religious communities globally.&quot; Due to the complexity of measuring religious identity, censuses sometimes also overestimate groups; this was the case for Christians in Britain, as typically one person fills out the census one behalf of a household, as distinguished from surveys which ask individual adults.

==Causes and correlates==
===Genes and environment===
The contributions of genes and environment to religiosity have been quantified in studies of twins and sociological studies of welfare, availability, and legal regulations (state religions, etc.).

Koenig and colleagues reported in a 2005 research paper that between adolescence and adulthood, the contribution of genes to variation in religiosity (called heritability) increases from 12% to 44% and the contribution of shared (family) effects decreases from 56% to 18%.

A market-based theory of religious choice and governmental regulation of religion have been the dominant theories used to explain variations of religiosity between societies. However, researchers Anthony Gill and Eric Lundsgaarde documented a much stronger correlation between welfare state spending and religiosity (see diagram).

===Just-world fallacy===
Studies have found belief in a just world to be correlated with aspects of religiosity.

===Risk-aversion===
Several studies have discovered a positive correlation between the degree of religiousness and risk aversion.

<text>The American redstart (Setophaga ruticilla) is a New World warbler. It is unrelated to the Old World (common) redstart.

==Taxonomy==
The American redstart was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Motacilla ruticilla&quot;.

The genus name &quot;Setophaga&quot; is from Ancient Greek σής : &quot;sēs&quot; (genitive σητός : sētós) &quot;moth&quot;, and &quot;&quot; : phágos &quot;eater&quot;.

The specific &quot;ruticilla&quot; is Neo-Latin for &quot;redstart&quot; from Latin &quot;rutilus&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, and the diminutive &quot;-cilla&quot;.

In Ancient Greek the name was φοινίκουρος : &quot;phoiníkouros&quot; (from φοῖνιξ : &quot;phoĩnix-&quot; &quot;red&quot; and οὐρά : &quot;ourá&quot; &quot;tail&quot;) &quot;Redstart&quot; refers to the male&#x27;s red tail, &quot;start&quot; being an old word for tail.

==Description==

The American redstart is a smallish warbler. It measures in total length and has a wingspan of . Its length is boosted by a relatively long tail and it is one of the lightest birds in its family. Weight is considerably less in winter than in summer. Males weigh an average of in summer but drop to in winter, while females drop even more from an average of to an average of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . The breeding males are unmistakable, jet black above apart from large orange-red patches on their wings and tails. Their breast sides are also orange, with the rest of their underparts white. In their other plumages, American redstarts display green in their upperparts, along with black central tails and grey heads. The orange patches of the breeding males are replaced by yellow in the plumages of the females and young birds. Orange and yellow coloration is due to the presence of carotenoids; males possess the red carotenoid canthaxanthin and the yellow carotenoids canary xanthophyll A and B, all of which mix together to produce an orange color, while the females possess only the yellow carotenoids. Recent research indicates that an age and sex effect on observed color attributes of hue, brightness, and saturation exists in American redstarts, with the exception for saturation, which only showed an age effect. Their song is a series of musical &quot;see&quot; notes. Their call is a soft &quot;chip&quot;.

== Hybridization ==
Rare hybrids between the American redstart and the congeneric magnolia warbler (&quot;Setophaga magnolia&quot;) have been documented on two occasions, in Ohio, USA, and Quebec, Canada. In both cases, the hybrid&#x27;s mother was a magnolia warbler and the father was a redstart.

==Distribution and habitat==

Although perhaps not as common as in the past, the redstart appears to be one of the most stable and abundant species of New World warbler; its numbers exceeded in total by the common yellowthroat, yellow warbler and yellow-rumped warbler, because of much wider natural breeding ranges in those species and perhaps exceeding those in sheer density within appropriate range. Their breeding is in North America, spanning southern Canada and the eastern United States. They are migratory, wintering in Central America, the West Indies, and northern South America, and are very rare vagrants to western Europe. During the breeding season, the redstart inhabits open-canopy, mostly deciduous forests, second growth, and forest edges. It is insectivorous, often sharing its foraging habitats with other warblers, and is found feeding in the mid to lower regions of a tree or shrub. A wide range of habitats are occupied during migration, including many shrubby areas. On its wintering grounds in Central and South America, the redstart may be found in nearly all woody habitats but tends to avoid non-forested agricultural areas. It is often found in shade-grown coffee plantations, which provide native trees and shrubs, as well as coffee trees. Elevations occupied vary by location, with redstarts found at elevations up to in South America, but only in Jamaica.

==Behavior==

===Breeding===
The breeding habitats of the redstarts are open woodlands or scrub, often located near water. They nest in the lower part of a bush, laying 2–5 eggs in a neat cup-shaped nest. The clutch is incubated by the female for 10 to 13 days. The young fledge after 9 days in the nest, and may remain with one parent for up to 3 weeks afterwards. First-year males are able to reproduce during their first breeding season, but they retain the female-like plumage which may contribute to low reproductive success (less than 50% of first-year males) until year 2. In contrast, most first-year females successfully reproduce during their first breeding season. There is evidence for a skewed sex ratio that results in a surplus of unmated males.

American redstarts display a mixed mating strategy; they are predominantly monogamous but around 25% of males maintain multiple territories and are polygynous. Even within monogamous pairs, a high proportion of offspring—as many as 40%—are not fathered by the male of the pair. The intensity of the male&#x27;s coloration (which is due to carotenoid pigments) predicts their success at holding territory in their non-breeding, winter locations in the Caribbean, the probability that they will be polygynous, and the proportion of offspring in their nests that they will themselves father. Males are invariably very territorial and the superior males occupy the best habitats, such as moist mangroves, while inferior males occupy secondary habitats such as dry scrub forests.

===Feeding===
The redstarts feed almost exclusively on insects which are usually caught by flycatching. American redstarts also have been known to catch their insect prey by gleaning it from leaves. This is a very active species. The tail is often held partly fanned out. These birds have been observed flashing the orange and yellow of their tails on and off to startle and chase insects from the underbrush. Overall, this species is a very flexible, opportunistic feeder that can easily adapt to varying habitat, season, insect community, vegetation structure, and time of day. The diet consists largely of caterpillars, moths, flies, leafhoppers and planthoppers, small wasps, beetles, aphids, stoneflies and spiders. Few berries and seeds are consumed, but are most often from barberry, serviceberry, and magnolia.

==Mortality==
The oldest known banded redstart lived to over 10 years of age. Other adults have been known to reach around 5 years. However, few survive past the first stages of life, as the bird is vulnerable to both terrestrial and aerial predators. Highest rates of predation occur during the breeding season when eggs and helpless nestlings are abundant and easy prey for varied predators. Females mostly brood during this period and thus often fall prey to nest predators. Common terrestrial predators include red squirrels, fishers, eastern chipmunks, American black bears, flying squirrels, fox snakes, and domestic cats. Aerial predators take nestlings, eggs, or even adults in flight. Aerial predators include jaegers, blue jays, common ravens, northern saw-whet owls, common grackles, northern goshawks, sharp-shinned hawks, and Cooper&#x27;s hawks.

==Conservation==
Successful conservation efforts of the redstart, as for any other migrating bird, include protecting and providing habitat throughout its entire range. The benefits to coffee farms that redstarts and other &quot;coffee birds&quot; provide have encouraged coffee farmers to adapt shade trees and adjacent forest patches in their farming practices as additional habitat for the birds. While shade tree coffee farms offer a somewhat practical compromise between habitat preservation and agriculture, there is still not enough data to back the proposition that practices like shade tree coffee farms can replace the natural habitat that was once there. Still, the most effective method for American redstart conservation would be natural habitat preservation at wintering and breeding grounds.
