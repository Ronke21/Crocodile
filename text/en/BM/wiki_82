<text>West Central German () belongs to the Central, High German dialect family of German. It includes the following sub-families:
* [[Central Franconian]] ()
** Ripuarian (), spoken in North Rhine-Westphalia (including ) and German-speaking Belgium and a small edge of the south of the Dutch province of Limbourg.
** Moselle Franconian (; ) in Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and France
*** Luxembourgish (; ; or ) in Luxembourg, Belgium and France
*** Hunsrik (), spoken in Brazil and derived from the dialect of Moselle Franconian
* [[Rhine Franconian dialects|Rhine Franconian]] (; ) 
** Palatinate Franconian (; ), spoken in Rhineland-Palatinate
*** Lorraine Franconian (; ) in the French region of Lorraine
*** Bukovina German () in Bukovina (extinct) 
*** Pennsylvania German () in historical communities in North America, especially Pennsylvania
** Hessian () in Hesse and the Rhenish Hesse region of Rhineland-Palatinate
*** North Hessian ()
*** Central Hessian ()
*** East Hessian ()
*** South Hessian ()

On the southern and southeastern edges, West Central German varieties border on an area often considered a transitional area between Central German and Upper German, comprising the dialect groups South Franconian German and East Franconian German (popularly called &quot;Franconian&quot; because dialects of this sub-family are spoken all over Franconia).

West Central German was spoken in several settlements throughout America, for example in the Amana Colonies.

<text>Louis Jeremiah Abershawe (c. 1773 – 3 August 1795), better known as Jerry Abershawe, or Abershaw, was an English highwayman who terrorised travellers, mostly along the road between Kingston upon Thames and London, in the late eighteenth century.

==Biography==
Born in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, Abershawe started his life of crime at the age of seventeen, leading a gang of robbers based at the &quot;Bald-Faced Stag Inn&quot; at Putney Vale, on the road between Kingston and London. When in hiding he frequented a house in Clerkenwell, near Saffron Hill, known as the &quot;Old House in West Street&quot;, which was noted for its dark closets, trap-doors and sliding panels, and had often formed the asylum of wanted criminals, including Jonathan Wild and Jack Sheppard.

All efforts to bring Abershawe to justice for a time proved futile, but in January 1795 he shot dead one of the constables sent to arrest him in Southwark, and attempted to shoot another. He was eventually arrested in London at a public house, The Three Brewers, in Southwark. For his crimes he was brought to trial at the Surrey assizes in July of the same year. Although a legal flaw in the indictment invalidated the case of murder against him, he was convicted and sentenced to death on the second charge of felonious shooting.

On Monday, 3 August 1795, Abershawe was hanged on Kennington Common; his body was afterwards set on a gallows (gibbeted) at Putney Vale — the last hanged highwayman&#x27;s body to be so displayed.

The coolness with which Abershawe met his death prolonged his notoriety, and his name was commonly used as a synonym for a daring thief in the early years of the nineteenth century. He received his sentence with extraordinary sangfroid, putting on his own hat at the same moment as the judge assumed the black cap, and &quot;observing him with contemptuous looks&quot; while pronouncing judgment. The few days that intervened between his conviction and execution he spent in sketching with cherries on the walls of his cell scenes from his daring exploits on the road. While being driven to the gallows he &quot;appeared entirely unconcerned, had a flower in his mouth... and he kept up an incessant conversation with the persons who rode beside the cart, frequently laughing and nodding to others of his acquaintances whom he perceived in the crowd, which was immense&quot;, according to an article in the &quot;Oracle and Public Advertiser&quot;. In a pamphlet on his career, entitled &quot;Hardened Villany Displayed&quot;, which was published soon after his death, he is described as &quot;a good-looking young man, only 22 years of age&quot;.

Abershawe was sometimes known as &quot;The Laughing Highwayman&quot; (ref: &quot;Weird Croydon&quot;):
:&quot;Although Abershawe was far removed from the romantic image of the lovable rogue, he possessed a healthy sense of humour, often incorporating his ironic wit into his robberies. An extract from the history book &quot;Local Highwaymen&quot; reads: &#x27;Abershaw&#x27;s humour seemed to be at its best when his personal fortunes were at their worst, for instance, at the time of his trial and eventual hanging a classic example of gallows humour.&#x27;

Anecdotes of Abershawe credit him with the rude generosity commonly ascribed to men of his vocation. On one November night, it is said, after several hours spent upon the road, he was taken ill at the &quot;Bald-Faced Stag&quot;, and a doctor was sent for from Kingston. Abershawe entreated the doctor, who was in ignorance of his patient&#x27;s name, to travel back under the protection of one of his own men, but the gentleman refused, declaring that he feared no one, even should he meet with Abershawe himself. The story was frequently repeated by the highwayman, as a testimony to the eminence he had gained in his profession.

==In popular culture==
*Abershawe appears in &quot;The Romany Rye&quot; by George Borrow, alongside others such as &quot;Galloping Dick&quot; Ferguson.
*In the novel &quot;Jacob Faithful&quot; by Frederick Marryat, Jacob and another boy get lost on Wimbledon Common and see the hanging skeleton of Jerry Abershawe. He is a character (as Jerry Abershaw) in &quot;The Red House&quot; in &quot;Six Ghost Stories&quot; by Sir Thomas Graham Jackson.
*Abershaw is referred to in Georgette Heyer&#x27;s &quot;Regency Buck&quot;: “and all the while they could hear Jerry Abershaw, who was hanging there in chains, creaking every time the wind caught him”.

<text>Tutejszy (; Polish: &quot;tutejszy&quot;, ; ; ; ; ) was a self-identification of Eastern European rural populations, who did not have a clear national identity. The term means &quot;from here&quot;, &quot;local&quot; or &quot;natives&quot;. This was mostly in mixed-lingual Eastern European areas, including Belarus, Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and Latvia, in particular, in Polesia and Podlachia. As a self-identification, it persisted in Lithuania’s Vilnius Region into the late 20th century. For example, in 1989, a poll of persons whose passports recorded their ethnicity as Polish revealed that 4% of them regarded themselves as &quot;tuteišiai&quot;, 10% as Lithuanians, and 84% as Poles.

== In Poland ==
The term was first used in an official publication in 1922 in the preliminary results of the Polish census of 1921 (&quot;Miesięcznik Statystyczny&quot;, vol. V). An indigenous nationality (; ) was declared by 38,943 persons, with the vast majority being Orthodox (38,135) and from rural areas (36,729). The Census stated that this category was for &quot;population who could not describe their ethnicity in any other way&quot;. This census did not include the Vilnius Region.

There are mixed opinions about the reasons, meaning, and implications of this term. In the Polish census of 1931 asked respondents to identify their mother tongue. “Tutejszy” was included and was chosen by 707,088 respondents. Lithuanian researchers assert that within ethnographic Lithuania, the Tutejszy were mostly Slavicized Lithuanians. argues that a considerable contribution to Slavicization of the area was a significant influx of Ruthenian (Belarusian) peasantry in the area, especially after considerable depopulation due to plague.

== In Latvia ==
Report on the Latvian census of 1930 describes &quot;tuteiši&quot; as Catholics of Latgale, who spoke Polish, Latvian and Russian equally and lacked ethnic identity (the Latvian census did not recognize these people as having a separate ethnic identity). The report notes that they could easily change their identity on a whim or after being persuaded by nationalist organizations, producing sharp changes in the ethnic composition of some areas, the most noticeable changes being a decrease in the number of Belarusians in ten years since 1920 from 75,630 to 36,029 and number of Poles increasing more than could be explained with natural growth and immigration, suggesting that some 5,000 Tutejszy had chosen to identify as Poles. In addition, uncertain number of them presumably chose to identify as Russians or Latvians.

== Language ==
The group&#x27;s speech (&quot;język tutejszy&quot;, &quot;local language&quot;) was described by as “an uncodified and largely undescribed Belarusian vernacular”.

According to Polish professor Jan Otrębski&#x27;s article published in 1931, the Polish dialect in the Vilnius Region and in the northeastern areas in general are very interesting variant of Polishness as this dialect developed in a foreign territory which was mostly inhabited by the Lithuanians who were Belarusized (mostly) or Polonized, and to prove this Otrębski provided examples of Lithuanianisms in the Tutejszy language.

In 2015, Polish linguist attested that many of the Vilnius Region&#x27;s inhabitants who declare Polish nationality speak a Belarusian dialect which they call &quot;mowa prosta&quot; (&#x27;simple speech&#x27;).

<text>A document file format is a text or binary file format for storing documents on a storage media, especially for use by computers.
There currently exist a multitude of incompatible document file formats.

Examples of XML-based open standards are DocBook, XHTML, and, more recently, the ISO/IEC standards OpenDocument (ISO 26300:2006) and Office Open XML (ISO 29500:2008).

In 1993, the ITU-T tried to establish a standard for document file formats, known as the Open Document Architecture (ODA) which was supposed to replace all competing document file formats. It is described in ITU-T documents T.411 through T.421, which are equivalent to ISO 8613. It did not succeed.

Page description languages such as PostScript and PDF have become the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for documents that a typical user should only be able to create and read, not edit. In 2001, a series of ISO/IEC standards for PDF began to be published, including the specification for PDF itself, ISO-32000.

HTML is the most used and open international standard and it is also used as document file format. It has also become ISO/IEC standard (ISO 15445:2000).

The default binary file format used by Microsoft Word (.doc) has become widespread &quot;de facto&quot; standard for office documents, but it is a proprietary format and is not always fully supported by other word processors.

==Common document file formats==
* ASCII, UTF-8 — plain text encodings. With these two character sets, there are three different line endings used: (a) LF -- linefeed, by UNIX and like systems, (b) CRLF -- carriage return, linefeed by DOS and Windows systems, and (c) CR -- carriage return by older Macintosh systems.
* Amigaguide
* .doc for Microsoft Word — Structural binary format developed by Microsoft (specifications available since 2008 under the Open Specification Promise)
* DjVu — file format designed primarily to store scanned documents
* DocBook — an XML format for technical documentation
* HTML (.html, .htm), (open standard, ISO from 2000), in combination with possible image files referred to.
* FictionBook (.fb2) — open XML-based e-book format
* Markdown (.md) — markup language for creating formatted text using plain text
* Office Open XML — .docx (XML-based standard for office documents)
* OpenDocument — .odt (XML-based standard for office documents)
* OpenOffice.org XML — .sxw (open, XML-based format for office documents)
* OXPS — Open XML Paper Specification (Windows 8.1 and above, older version is XPS used in Windows 7)
* PalmDoc — handheld document format
* .pages for Pages
* PDF — Open standard for document exchange. ISO standards include PDF/X (eXchange), PDF/A (Archive), PDF/E (Engineering), ISO 32000 (PDF), PDF/UA (Accessibility) and PDF/VT (Variable data and transactional printing). PDF is readable on almost every platform with free or open source readers. Open source PDF creators are also available.
* PostScript — .ps
* Rich Text Format (RTF) — meta data format being developed by Microsoft since 1987 for Microsoft products and cross-platform document interchange
* SYmbolic LinK (SYLK)
* Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) - Graphics format primarily for vector-based images.
* TeX — Open-source typesetting program and format. First successful mathematical notation language.
* TEI — XML format for digital publication
* Troff
* Uniform Office Format — Chinese standard
* WordPerfect (.wpd, .wp, .wp7, .doc) (Note: possible confusion with Word format extension)

<text>Rumble Fish is a 1983 American drama film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is based on the 1975 novel &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; by S. E. Hinton, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. The film stars Matt Dillon, Mickey Rourke, Vincent Spano, Diane Lane, Diana Scarwid, Nicolas Cage, Chris Penn, and Dennis Hopper.

The film centers on the relationship between a character called the Motorcycle Boy (Rourke), a revered former gang leader wishing to live a more peaceful life, and his younger brother, Rusty James (Dillon), a teenaged hoodlum who aspires to become as feared as his brother.

Coppola wrote the screenplay for the film with Hinton on his days off from shooting &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. He made the films back-to-back, retaining much of the same cast and crew, particularly Matt Dillon and Diane Lane. &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; is dedicated to Coppola&#x27;s brother August.

The film is notable for its avant-garde style with a film noir feel, shot on stark high-contrast black-and-white film, using the spherical cinematographic process with allusions to French New Wave cinema and German Expressionism. &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; features an experimental score by Stewart Copeland, drummer of the musical group The Police, who used a Musync, a new device at the time.

==Plot==
In Tulsa, Oklahoma, Rusty James is the younger brother of &quot;The Motorcycle Boy&quot;, a legendary figure amongst the gangs in the area who brokered peace between them. The Motorcycle Boy has been missing for two months, leaving the gangs to start to dissolve as heroin takes over the streets, while Rusty James tries to live up to his reputation.

Rusty James fights a rival gang leader and gets the upper hand, but is distracted by the Motorcycle Boy&#x27;s return, causing him to be wounded. The Motorcycle Boy runs the man down with his cycle before nursing Rusty James back to health. Rusty James&#x27;s awkward, nerdy friend Steve helps the Motorcycle Boy, but is wary due to his rumored insanity similar to that of his long-absent mother. The brothers spend time with their impoverished, alcoholic father, who notes that the Motorcycle Boy takes after his mother.

Rusty James quits school after his fighting gets him suspended and cheats on his girlfriend Patty at a party hosted by his friend Smokey. She breaks up with him and Smokey accosts her, making Rusty James realize that the party was set up so Smokey could take advantage of the situation and date her. Steve and the brothers go drinking and the Motorcycle Boy mentions that he found his mother dating a television producer while out in California and laments not getting to see the Pacific Ocean. Steve and Rusty James are mugged as they leave a bar, and Rusty James is beaten to the point where he has a brief out-of-body experience. The Motorcycle Boy saves them and tries to convince Rusty James to leave the gang life, but Steve decries him as insane, which Rusty James starts to believe.

Rusty James finds the Motorcycle Boy in a pet store, where he is taken with the Siamese fighting fish (which he dubs &quot;rumble fish&quot; and are the only element of color in the film, as the Motorcycle Boy is colorblind). Patterson, a police officer who hates the Motorcycle Boy, regards them with suspicion. Rusty James&#x27;s father tells him that the Motorcycle Boy and their mother are people with an &quot;acute perception&quot; rather than crazy.

The brothers ride back to the pet store, where the Motorcycle Boy sets the animals loose while Rusty James fails to convince him to return to gang life. As the Motorcycle Boy asks him to take his cycle to the Pacific and hurries to a nearby river to drop the fighting fish, he is shot dead by a patrolling Patterson. Rusty James takes the fish and finishes carrying them to the river before speeding away on the motorcycle, taking it to the ocean.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development and writing===
Francis Ford Coppola was drawn to S. E. Hinton&#x27;s novel &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; because of the strong personal identification he had with the subject matter — a younger brother who hero-worships an older, intellectually superior brother, which mirrored the relationship between Coppola and his brother, August. A dedication to August appears as the film&#x27;s final end credit. The director said that he &quot;started to use &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; as my carrot for what I promised myself when I finished &quot;The Outsiders&quot;&quot;. Halfway through the production of &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, Coppola decided that he wanted to retain the same production team, stay in Tulsa, and shoot &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; right after &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. He wrote the screenplay for &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; with Hinton on Sundays, their day off from shooting &quot;The Outsiders&quot;.

===Pre-production===
Warner Bros. was not happy with an early cut of &quot;The Outsiders&quot; and passed on distributing &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;. Despite the lack of financing, Coppola recorded the film on video, in its entirety, during two weeks of rehearsals in a former school gymnasium and afterwards was able to show the cast and crew a rough draft of the film. To get Rourke into the mindset of his character, Coppola gave him books written by Albert Camus and a biography of Napoleon. The Motorcycle Boy&#x27;s look was patterned after Camus complete with trademark cigarette dangling out of the corner of his mouth — taken from a photograph of the author that Rourke used as a visual handle. Rourke remembers that he approached his character as &quot;an actor who no longer finds his work interesting&quot;.

Coppola hired Michael Smuin, a choreographer and co-director of the San Francisco Ballet, to stage the fight scene between Rusty James and Biff Wilcox because he liked the way he choreographed violence. He asked Smuin to include specific visual elements: a motorcycle, broken glass, knives, gushing water and blood. The choreographer spent a week designing the sequence. Smuin also staged the street dance between Rourke and Diana Scarwid, modeling it after one in &quot;Picnic&quot; featuring William Holden and Kim Novak.

Before filming started, Coppola ran regular screenings of old films during the evenings to familiarize the cast, and in particular the crew, with his visual concept for &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;. Most notably, Coppola showed Anatole Litvak&#x27;s &quot;Decision Before Dawn&quot;, the inspiration for the film&#x27;s smoky look, F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; to show Matt Dillon how silent actor Emil Jannings used body language to convey emotions, and Robert Wiene&#x27;s &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;, which became &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;&#x27;s &quot;stylistic prototype&quot;. Coppola&#x27;s extensive use of shadows, oblique angles, exaggerated compositions, and an abundance of smoke and fog are all hallmarks of these German Expressionist films. Godfrey Reggio&#x27;s &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;, shot mainly in time-lapse photography, motivated Coppola to use this technique to animate the sky in his own film.

===Filming===
Six weeks into production, Coppola made a deal with Universal Studios and principal photography began on July 12, 1982 with the director declaring, &quot;&quot;Rumble Fish&quot; will be to &quot;The Outsiders&quot; what &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; was to &quot;The Godfather&quot;.&quot; He shot in deserted areas at the edge of Tulsa with many scenes captured via a hand-held camera in order to make the audience feel uneasy. He also had shadows painted on the walls of the sets to make them look ominous. In the dream sequence where Rusty James floats outside of his body Matt Dillon wore a body mold which was moved by an articulated arm and also flown on wires.

To mix the black-and-white footage of Rusty James and the Motorcycle Boy in the pet store looking at the Siamese fighting fish in color, Burum shot the actors in black and white and then projected that footage on a rear projection screen. They put the fish tank in front of it with the tropical fish and shot it all with color film. Filming finished by mid-September 1982, on schedule and on budget.

The film is notable for its avant-garde style, shot on stark high-contrast black-and-white film, using the spherical cinematographic process with allusions to French New Wave cinema. The striking black-and-white photography of the film&#x27;s cinematographer, Stephen H. Burum, lies in two main sources: the films of Orson Welles and German cinema of the 1920s. When the film was in its pre-production phase, Coppola asked Burum how he wanted to film it and they agreed that it might be the only chance they were ever going to have to make a black-and-white film.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===

Coppola envisioned a largely experimental score to complement his images. He began to devise a mainly percussive soundtrack to symbolize the idea of time running out. As Coppola worked on it, he realized that he needed help from a professional musician. He asked Stewart Copeland, then drummer of the musical group The Police, to improvise a rhythm track. Coppola soon concluded that Copeland was a far superior composer and let him take over. Copeland recorded street sounds of Tulsa and mixed them into the soundtrack with the use of Musync—a music and tempo editing hardware and software system invented by Robert Randles (subsequently nominated for an Oscar for Scientific Achievement), to modify the tempo of his compositions and synchronize them with the action in the film.

An edited version of the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Box Me In&quot;, a collaboration between Copeland and singer/songwriter Stan Ridgway, was released as a single and enjoyed significant radio airplay.

==Differences from the novel==
Coppola did not employ the flashback structure of the novel. He also removed a few passages from the novel that further established Steve and Rusty James&#x27; relationship in order to focus more on the brothers&#x27; relationship.
* In the novel, Rusty James and the motorcycle boy are three years younger than they are portrayed in the film. In the novel, the Motorcycle Boy is only 17 whereas in the film, he is 21.
* In the film, the Motorcycle Boy is more attentive and paternal toward Rusty James than he is in the novel.
* In the novel, Rusty James uses a bike chain to disarm Biff, whereas in the film he uses a sweater.
* In the novel Biff slashes Rusty James with a knife rather than a pane of glass and Motorcycle Boy breaks Biff&#x27;s wrist instead of ramming him with his motorcycle.
* The Motorcycle Boy&#x27;s self-destructive behavior at the film&#x27;s conclusion is less motivated in the film than in the novel. 
* In the novel, Rusty James gets arrested after Motorcycle Boy is shot and never makes the promise to ride the motorcycle.
* The film ends with Rusty James arriving at the ocean on a motorcycle while the novel ends with Rusty James meeting Steve in California five years after Motorcycle Boy&#x27;s death.

==Themes==
The theme of time passing faster than the characters realize is conveyed through time-lapse photography of clouds racing across the sky and numerous shots of clocks. The black-and-white photography was meant to convey the Motorcycle Boy&#x27;s color blindness while also evoking film noir through frequent use of oblique angles, exaggerated compositions, dark alleys, and foggy streets.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
Coppola utilized many new filmmaking techniques never before used in the production of a commercial motion picture, and the film was well received on the independent circuit. At the San Sebastián International Film Festival, it won the International Critics&#x27; Big Award. At its world premiere at the New York Film Festival however, there were several walkouts and at the end of the screening, boos and catcalls. Former head of production at Paramount Pictures Michael Daly remembers legendary producer Robert Evans&#x27; reaction to Coppola&#x27;s film, &quot;Evans went to see &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;, and he remembers being shaken by how far Coppola had strayed from Hollywood. Evans says, &#x27;I was scared. I couldn&#x27;t understand any of it.&#x27;&quot;

===Home media===

The film was first released on VHS in 1984 and on DVD on September 9, 1998 with no extra material. A special edition was released on September 13, 2005 with an audio commentary by Coppola, six deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, a look at how Copeland&#x27;s score was created and the &quot;Don&#x27;t Box Me In&quot; music video. In August 2012, The Masters of Cinema Series released a special Blu-ray edition of the film (and accompanying Steelbook edition) in the UK. In April 2017, the Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray and DVD. Chuck Bowen, in a review of the Blu-ray edition, referred to &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; as one &quot;of Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s most underrated and deeply felt films.&quot; He suggests that with the Blu-ray edition, it &quot;receives a gorgeously ephemeral restoration that should hopefully jump-start its reevaluation as an essential American work.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Rumble Fish&quot; was released on October 8, 1983 and it only grossed $18,985 on its opening weekend, playing in one theater. Its widest release was in 296 theaters and it was a box office disaster, grossing only $2.5 million domestically. Its estimated budget was $10 million; a large sum for the time.

===Critical response===
Jay Scott wrote for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;Francis Coppola, bless his theatrical soul, may have the commercial sense of a newt, but he has the heart of a revolutionary, and the talent of a great artist.&quot; Jack Kroll in his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot; stated: &quot;&quot;Rumble Fish&quot; is a brilliant tone poem ... Rourke&#x27;s Motorcycle Boy is really a young god with a mortal wound, a slippery assignment Rourke handles with a fierce delicacy.&quot;. David Thomson has written that &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; is &quot;maybe the most satisfying film Coppola made after &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;&quot;. Sofia Coppola named it as her favorite among her father&#x27;s movies in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Coppola himself has variously called it his favorite of his own movies and as among his three favorites, saying it &quot;was the film I really wanted to make&quot;.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars and wrote, &quot;I thought &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; was offbeat, daring, and utterly original. Who but Coppola could make this film? And, of course, who but Coppola would want to?&quot; In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote that &quot;the film is so furiously overloaded, so crammed with extravagant touches, that any hint of a central thread is obscured&quot;. Gary Arnold in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s virtually impossible to be drawn into the characters&#x27; identities and conflicts at even an introductory, rudimentary level, and the rackety distraction of an obtrusive experimental score ... frequently makes it impossible to comprehend mere dialogue&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Corliss wrote, &quot;In one sense, then, &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; is Coppola&#x27;s professional suicide note to the movie industry, a warning against employing him to find the golden gross. No doubt: this is his most baroque and self-indulgent film. It may also be his bravest.&quot; David Denby in &quot;New York&quot; and Andrew Sarris in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the film harsh reviews.

&quot;Rumble Fish&quot; earned 77% based on 39 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Rumble Fish&quot; frustrates even as it intrigues, but director Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s strong visual style helps compensate for a certain narrative stasis.&quot; The film has a weighted average score of 63/100 on Metacritic.

===Accolades===
&quot;Rumble Fish&quot; won the highest prize in the 32nd San Sebastián International Film Festival, the International Critics&#x27; Big Award.

<doc id="423550" wikidata="Q16203892" url="?curid=423550" title="John Nevison">
<text>John Nevison (1639 – 4 May 1684), also known as William Nevison or Nevinson, was one of Britain&#x27;s most notorious highwaymen, a gentleman rogue supposedly nicknamed &quot;Swift Nick&quot; by King Charles II after a renowned dash from Kent to York to establish an alibi for a robbery he had committed earlier that day. The story inspired William Harrison Ainsworth to include a modified version in his novel &quot;Rookwood&quot;, in which he attributed the feat to Dick Turpin. There are suggestions that the feat was actually undertaken by Samuel Nicks. The TV series &quot;Dick Turpin&quot; had an accomplice of the highwayman, Nick, who earned the nickname &quot;Swiftnick&quot;.

==History==
Nevison was born in 1639, probably in Wortley, West Riding of Yorkshire (present-day South Yorkshire). He ran away from home at the age of 13 or 14 and may have ended up in London. Forced to flee to Holland to evade the authorities he enrolled in the Duke of York&#x27;s army and took part in the 1658 Battle of Dunkirk. After his discharge he returned to England and took care of his father for several years before adopting the same profession as many of his contemporary ex-soldiers, that of a highwayman. Basing himself around Newark-on-Trent, he targeted those travelling along the Great North Road between Huntingdon in the south and York to the north.

In the mid-1670s his activities were under investigation and he was associated with men named Edmund Bracy, Thomas Wilbore, Thomas Tankerd, John Bromett, and William (or Robert) Everson and John Brace or Bracy, which may have been his alias. The robbers used safe houses at Tuxford and Wentbridge and divided their spoils at the Talbot Inn at Newark. Nevison developed a reputation as a gentleman highwayman, never using violence against his victims, always polite, and only robbing the rich.

The famous ride from Kent to York took place in 1676, after Nevison had robbed a traveller at Gad&#x27;s Hill, near Rochester, Kent. Nevison escaped, using a ferry to cross the Thames and galloped via Chelmsford, Cambridge and Huntingdon to York some from the scene of the crime. He arrived at sunset and ensured he met the city&#x27;s Lord Mayor, entering into a wager on a bowls match. When he was arrested and tried for the Gad&#x27;s Hill robbery, he produced the Lord Mayor to support his alibi and was found not guilty.

Nevison was tried and convicted for the theft of a horse and highway robbery at York assizes in 1677. He was imprisoned in York Castle but, on offering to inform against his accomplices was pardoned and was to be transported. In 1681 he was taken from gaol to be enlisted in a company of soldiers bound for Tangier but escaped. A reward of £20 was offered for his recapture.
He was arrested on 6 March 1684 at the Three Houses Inn in Sandal Magna near Wakefield and tried for the murder of Darcy Fletcher, a constable who had tried to arrest him near Howley Hall at Soothill in Batley. He was taken to York where, because he had breached his pardon, was &quot;told him he must dye, for he was a terrour to the country&quot;. Nevison was hanged at the Knavesmire on 4 May 1684 and buried in an unmarked grave in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Castlegate.

== Legacy ==
Nevison was idolised by the public, and ballads about his deeds were popular centuries after in the form of a folk song &quot;Bold Nevison the Highwayman&quot; (Roud 1082). The Lincolnshire folk singer Joseph Taylor knew three verses of a song about Nevison. Percy Grainger recorded Taylor singing the song on a phonograph in 1908; the original recording is available on the British Library Sound Archive website.

&lt;poem&gt;I&#x27;ve now robb&#x27;d a gentleman of two-pence,
I&#x27;ve neither done murder, nor killed,
But guilty I&#x27;ve been all my life time,
So gentlemen do as you will

I&#x27;s when that I rode on the highway,
I&#x27;ve always had money in great store;
And whatever I look from the rich
I freely gave it to the poor.&lt;/poem&gt;

(Lyrics taken from 1850s broadside printed in Manchester.)

In the 1913 novel &quot;Swift Nick of the York Road&quot; by George Edgar, Nevison is a gentleman who is cheated out of his fortune when gambling, wins several duels and finally profits from King Charles&#x27;s clemency.

Hubert Clifford&#x27;s 1935 &quot;Kentish Suite&quot; for orchestra has as its fourth movement &quot;Swift Nicks of Gad&#x27;s Hill&quot;, with the comment that &quot;Nicholas Nevinson was a highwayman of the period who plied his business at Gad’s Hill near Gravesend. His famous ride to York, usually associated with the name of Dick Turpin, earned his title to fame, and King Charles, on hearing of his exploits, granted him a free pardon and dubbed him &#x27;Swift Nicks&#x27;&quot;. The Gad&#x27;s Hill reference and the pardon both appear in Defoe&#x27;s account.

<text>Jeffrey Addison Nuttall (8 July 1933 – 4 January 2004) was an English poet, performer, author, actor, teacher, painter, sculptor, jazz musician, anarchist and social commentator who was a key part of the British 1960s counter-culture. He was the brother of literary critic A. D. Nuttall.

==Life and work==
Nuttall was born in Clitheroe, Lancashire, and grew up in Orcop, a village in Herefordshire. He studied at Hereford College of Art, (1949–1951) and Bath Academy of Art, Corsham Court (1951–1953) He married Jane Louch, his former art teacher in 1954 and in the same year gained a teaching MA at The Institute of Education in London followed by national service completed in 1956. With his family he moved to London in 1959 where he worked as a secondary school teacher in Finchley. He was active with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) until 1962, then inspired by Alexander Trocchi and Peter Currell Brown, he committed to making art to change society. He made connections with other avant-garde writers and artists in Group H including Bob Cobbing and John Latham.

In 1963 Nuttall produced the first of 17 issues of &quot;My Own Mag&quot; with contributions from William Burroughs. &quot;MOM&quot; was one of the first underground magazines which were a defining feature of the 1960s counterculture.

During 1965 Nuttall staged early Happenings at Better Books in London.

An overload of creative work and marital difficulties caused Nuttall to retreat to the Abbey Art Centre where he formed The People Show in 1966, one of the first and longest lasting Performance Art groups. During 1967 he contributed regularly to &quot;International Times&quot;, and wrote &quot;Bomb Culture&quot;, his personal account and critical analysis of the birth of the alternative society. The book was published in 1968 and then in 1970 as a best selling Paladin paperback. During this time Nuttall was teaching and writing in Norwich and would move first to Bradford College of Art in 1969 and then to Leeds Polytechnic Fine Art Department where he was a senior lecturer for ten years from 1970 to 1981. Nuttall was active in Performance Art collaborating with Rose McGuire (Priscilla Beecham), and influencing other performers and students including Marc Almond. His presence in the Fine Art department did much to define the radical creative ethos at Leeds. 

Nuttall was the author of over 40 books. These included novels (&quot;Snipe&#x27;s Spinster&quot; (1975)); poetry (&quot;Objects&quot; (1976)); cultural commentary (&quot;Common Factors/Vulgar Factions&quot;, with Rodick Carmichael (1977)); and biography (&quot;King Twist: A Portrait of Frank Randle&quot; (1978)). He was elected Chairman of the National Society of Poetry in 1975 and with Eric Mottram tried to introduce radical modernist poetry occasioning the Poetry Wars. From 1979 to 1981 Nuttall was poetry critic for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Appointed Head of Fine Art at Liverpool Polytechnic in 1981, his tenure was marked by controversial teaching initiatives, residencies at Deakin University, Australia, and increasing alcoholic consumption, all of which contributed to his early departure in 1984.

With his last partner, Jill Richards, he moved to Abergavenny, Wales, in 1991, and later to Crickhowell. His creative output continued with soft sculptures, landscape paintings, poetry, and writing. His last two books were &quot;Art and the Degradation of Awareness&quot; (1999) and &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (2003). He died aged 70 on 4 January 2004 at the Hen and Chickens pub (known as the Hen and Chicks) in Abergavenny, where his jazz band had performed regularly for ten years.

<text>Georg Muffat (1 June 1653 – 23 February 1704) was a Baroque composer and organist. He is best known for the remarkably articulate and informative performance directions printed along with his collections of string pieces &quot;Florilegium Primum&quot; and &quot;Florilegium Secundum&quot; (First and Second Bouquets) in 1695 and 1698.

==Life==
Georg Muffat was born in Megève, Duchy of Savoy (now in France), of André Muffat (of Scottish descent) and Marguerite Orsyand. He studied in Paris between 1663 and 1669, where his teacher is often assumed to have been Jean Baptiste Lully. This assumption is largely based on the statement &quot;For six years ... I avidly pursued this style which was flowering in Paris at the time under the most famous Jean Baptiste Lully.&quot; This is ambiguous (in all of the languages in which it was printed) as to whether the style was flourishing under Lully, or that Muffat studied under Lully. In any case, the style which the young Muffat learned was unequivocally Lullian and it remains likely, though unevidenced, that he had at least some contact with the man himself.

After leaving Paris, he became an organist in Molsheim and Sélestat. Later, he studied law in Ingolstadt, afterwards settling in Vienna. He could not get an official appointment, so he travelled to Prague in 1677, then to Salzburg, where he worked for the archbishop for some ten years. In about 1680, he traveled to Italy, there studying the organ with Bernardo Pasquini, a follower of the tradition of Girolamo Frescobaldi; he also met Arcangelo Corelli, whose works he admired very much. From 1690 to his death, he was &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; to the bishop of Passau.

Georg Muffat should not be confused with his son Gottlieb Muffat, also a successful composer.

==Works==
His works are strongly influenced by both French and Italian composers:
*Sonatas for various instruments (&quot;armonico tributo&quot; 1682);
*Orchestral suites (&quot;florilegium primum &amp; secundum&quot; 1695);
*12 Concerti grossi (&quot;auserlesene... instrumental Musik&quot; 1701) re-using some thematic material from &quot;armonico tributo&quot;
*12 Toccatas for the organ as well as other pieces : passacaglia, chaconne, air with variations (&quot;Apparatus musico-organisticus&quot; 1690);
*some partitas for the harpsichord, kept as a manuscript
*several religious works (notably three masses, Salve Regina, etc.) from which only &quot;Missa in labore requies&quot; for twenty-four parts is preserved;
*3 operas, all now lost (&quot;Marina Armena&quot;; &quot;Königin Marianne die verleumdete Unschuld&quot;; &quot;La fatali felicità di Plutone&quot;).

Muffat was, as Johann Jakob Froberger before him, and Handel after him, a cosmopolitan composer who played an important role in the exchanges between European musical traditions. The information contained within the &quot;Florilegium Primum&quot; and &quot;Secundum&quot; is nearly unique. These performance directions were intended to assist German string players with the idiom of the French dance style, and include detailed rules for the tempo and order of bow strokes in various types of movement, as well as more general strategies for good ensemble playing and musicianship. These texts remain extremely valuable for modern historically-interested musicians.

<text>John Morrison Birch (May 28, 1918 – August 25, 1945) was a United States Army Air Forces military intelligence captain, OSS field agent in China during World War II, as well as former Baptist minister and missionary. He was killed in a confrontation with Chinese Communist soldiers during an assignment he was ordered on by the OSS, ten days after the war ended. Birch was posthumously awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal.

The John Birch Society (JBS), an American right-wing political advocacy group, was named in his memory by Robert H. W. Welch Jr. in 1958. Welch considered Birch to be a martyr and the first casualty of the Cold War. Birch&#x27;s parents joined the JBS as honorary life members.

==Early life==
Birch was born to Presbyterian missionaries in Landour, a hill station in the Himalayas now in the northern India state of Uttarakhand, at the time in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. His parents, Ethel (Ellis) and George S. Birch who were college graduates, were on a three-year period missionary service in the country, working under Sam Higginbottom. In 1920, when he was two, the family left India and returned to the United States due to his father having malaria. John Birch was the oldest of seven children.

In the States, his parents left the Presbyterian Church, and Birch was raised and baptized in the Fundamental Baptist tradition. He lived in Vineland, New Jersey and Crystal Springs and Macon, Georgia. He graduated from Gore High School at the head of his class in Chattooga County, Georgia. Afterwards, he enrolled at Georgia Baptist–affiliated Mercer University in Macon. &quot;He was always an angry young man, always a zealot&quot;, said a classmate many years later, saying that Birch &quot;felt he was called to defend the faith, and he alone knew what it was.&quot; In his senior year, he joined a group of students who opposed liberal tendencies at the university. They brought charges of &quot;heresy&quot; against some professors, such as holding the theory of evolution, and the university held a day-long hearing in the chapel. Defenders of the professors posted a sign on the door: &quot;Do Not Enter: Spanish Inquisition in Progress&quot;. The charges were dismissed, but the incident made Birch and the group unpopular on campus, and he later regretted the &quot;teacher episode.&quot; He graduated in 1939 magna cum laude with the highest grade point average in his class.

==Missionary work==
Birch decided to become a missionary when he was eleven years old. After college, he enrolled in J. Frank Norris&#x27; Fundamental Baptist Bible Institute in Fort Worth, Texas. Norris had visited Shanghai in 1939, two years after the Japanese invasion had started the Second Sino-Japanese War, and returned full of enthusiasm for &quot;the marvelous opportunity to proclaim Gospel and win souls.&quot; Birch, who was eager to finish his studies and had studied many of the topics before, completed the two-year curriculum in one year. He graduated at the head of his class in June 1940 and prepared to join Shanghai mission of Norris&#x27; World Fundamental Baptist Missionary Fellowship (now the World Baptist Fellowship). When Norris and some 150 members of the church gathered to send Birch and a friend off to China, Norris said they went &quot;fully informed as to the dangers that await them, but they go like the Apostle Paul when he knew that it meant death at Jerusalem.&quot; Birch left his family with the words &quot;Goodbye, folks, If we don’t meet again on earth, we’ll meet in heaven.&quot;

In July, Birch arrived in Shanghai, which was in Japanese administered territory, although Americans were considered neutral citizens. While there, he began an intensive study of Mandarin Chinese. A few months later, he was assigned to Hangzhou which was also occupied by the Japanese. In October 1941, he left Hangzhou, going by a harrowing foot-trip, narrowly escaping Japanese fire, to run a mission station in Shangrao, in northwest Jiangxi. The area was poor and isolated, but Birch reassured his parents that although malaria and dengue fever had &quot;knocked me down a bit&quot; (weighed 155 pounds/70 kg), he was &quot;coming back up,&quot; eating rice and vegetables with Chinese workers, and milk, besides. His Chinese became good enough that he could preach a short sermon.

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, added patriotic anger to Birch&#x27;s outrage at Japanese atrocities in China. He was also finding it harder and harder to survive in Shangrao, and his diet made it harder and harder to maintain his health, already weakened by disease. He may also have started to doubt the mission bureaucrats, who soured him on organized religion. On April 13, 1942, he wrote to the American Military Mission in China saying that for both patriotic and practical reasons he wanted to &quot;jine the Army.&quot; He explained that he had been preaching behind Japanese lines for more than a year but was &quot;finding it increasingly hard to do on an empty stomach (no word or funds from home since November).&quot; He wanted to be a chaplain but would cheerfully &quot;&#x27;tote&#x27; a rifle&quot; or &quot;whatever they tell me to do.&quot;

==Wartime work in China==

In April 1942, Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle and his flight crew bailed out over China after the Tokyo raid, the first surprise attack on Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Their B-25 bomber was the first aircraft of sixteen B-25s flown off the aircraft carrier for the raid. After bombing Tokyo and out of fuel during their one-way flight, Doolittle and his four crewmembers bailed out over southeastern China in mountainous terrain as planned. They were rescued by Chinese civilians and smuggled by river safely out of Japanese lines by a sampan in Zhejiang Province by Birch who was informed of their being hidden in the riverboat. When Doolittle arrived in China&#x27;s wartime capital, Chongqing, he told Colonel Claire Chennault, commander of the Flying Tigers (First American Volunteer Group-AVG, of the Chinese Air Force), about Birch&#x27;s help, Chennault said he needed a Chinese-speaking American who knew the country well. After later talks with Birch who helped in the urgent finding and recovery of most of the Doolittle Raiders in China, about his experiences in China, Chennault who was now a brigadier general, commissioned Birch as a second lieutenant at Chongqing on July 5, 1942, to work as a field intelligence officer for him. Birch had first wanted to serve as a chaplain. The AVG was disbanded on July 4, and replaced by the 23rd Fighter Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces; Birch became a member of the 23rd Fighter Group which took on the AVG&#x27;s nickname &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; and the Curtiss P-40 Warhawks shark teeth nose art.

Birch served with the China Air Task Force under Chennault, which became the Fourteenth Air Force in March 1943. He operated alone or with Nationalist Chinese soldiers, and often risked his life in Japanese-held territory. His activities included setting up intelligence networks of sympathetic Chinese, supplying Chennault with information on Japanese troop movements and shipping. He continued to hold Sunday church services for Chinese Christians. He set up radio intelligence networks, rescued downed American pilots, and had two emergency aircraft runways built. He received the Legion of Merit from Chennault on July 17, 1944.

Urged to take a leave of absence, Birch refused, telling Chennault he would not quit China until the last Japanese did. His political views continued to evolve. Birch wrote to Marjorie Tooker, with whom he had become closer and closer, that he found the Nationalist government &quot;relatively small and unrepresentative,&quot; and with its &quot;abuses, intolerance, and impotence&quot; it never had the popular support needed to build a strong nation. Yet Chiang Kai-shek deserved praise for his &quot;steadfastness of purpose&quot; in fighting the war. The Communists, on the other hand, were &quot;equally small, non-representative group,&quot; &quot;whose leaders I consider hypocritical thugs.&quot; They should be &quot;blamed for their lack of patriotism, but praised for their endurance and ingenuity in fighting the Japanese.&quot;

In 1945, Birch, now a captain, was seconded to the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the U.S. wartime intelligence service in World War II. At first, he criticized the OSS, wanting only to work for Chennault. V-J Day, August 14, signaled the end of formal hostilities, but under terms of the Japanese surrender, the Japanese Army was ordered to continue occupying the areas it controlled until they could be surrendered to the Nationalist government, even in places where the Chinese Communist-led government had been the &quot;de facto&quot; state for a decade. This led to continued fighting as the Chinese Communists sought to expel all Japanese imperial forces, which it perceived to include U.S. personnel, who were then openly collaborating with the remaining Japanese forces.

In his diary, OSS Major Gustav Krause, commanding officer of one of three air bases in China and now in command of Captain Birch, noted: &quot;Birch is a good officer, but I&#x27;m afraid is too brash and may run into trouble.&quot;

==Death==
After the formal Japanese surrender on August 15, 1945, OSS agents in China were ordered to northern China to take the surrender of Japanese commanders at their installations. The Chinese Communists, who controlled much of the mountainous area, were supposedly allies with the United States, but were not allowed to accept the surrender. Birch told a friend that he was not worried about going into Communist-controlled territory, since he had worked with Communists many times and had little trouble with them.
On August 20, Birch left Xi&#x27;an for Xuzhou, where a Japanese facility and airfield was located, in command of a group consisting of two American soldiers, a civilian OSS operative, five Chinese officers, and two Koreans who spoke Japanese. Birch&#x27;s mission, under direct orders from Lieutenant General Albert C. Wedemeyer, the commander of U.S. forces in China, was to go to Shandong Province to seize Japanese documents and to obtain information on airfields from which American prisoners of war (POWs) could be flown. Birch and his group traveled by foot, by Chinese junk, and by foot again, until they reached Guide (now Shangqiu), along the Longhai railway.

On August 24, after spending two nights in a nearby village, Birch&#x27;s group boarded a train at Guide, with a Chinese general and his orderly escorting them to Xuzhou, where Birch was to meet a Chinese general. Halfway and from Xuzhou, the train was stopped at the Dangshan railway station, where the group was informed that the line ahead had been sabotaged. Birch and his group continued for ten more miles (16 km) until the train could not proceed because of missing track. A Japanese patrol arrived by handcar with replacement rails and repaired the track. Birch sent the train back to Dangshan and his group spent the night in a nearby village, which had been ravaged with men being killed by Chinese Communists.

On the morning of August 25, Birch took over the handcar and continued to Xuzhou with his group, the Chinese general and his orderly. Over a mile (1600 m) down the line they ran into a group of 300 armed Communists. Birch and Lieutenant Tung, who was his aide on the mission, were told to surrender their weapons and equipment, which included three radios. Birch, who was wearing his Army uniform, identified himself and refused to turn over his weapon; after arguing with the Communist commander, they were allowed to proceed. Further along the way, Birch&#x27;s group encountered a group of Communists who were ripping up tracks and cutting down telephone poles. With Tung&#x27;s help in speaking with the Communists, the group was able to continue by handcar, and passed through another group of Chinese Communists.

When they arrived at the Huangkou railway station, which was occupied by Communist forces, Birch and Tung met the Communist military leader there, who was accompanied by about twenty soldiers. Birch identified himself and refused to give up his sidearm. Tung, who was unarmed and tried to help Birch talk with the Communist leader, was ordered to be shot. He was hit in the right thigh, and then clubbed on the head with a rifle butt. Afterwards, Birch, whose pistol was still holstered, was ordered shot; he was hit in the left thigh. His ankles and hands were then bound and, while kneeling, he was shot in the head. Birch&#x27;s body was then bayonetted and both bodies were thrown in a ditch. The rest of Birch&#x27;s team were taken prisoner. When they were able to do so, Chinese farmers took both bodies to the Chinese hospital at Xuzhou, where an autopsy was completed on Birch. Lieutenant Bill Miller, whose group was to have met up with Birch&#x27;s group at Xuzhou, arrived on August 29. After learning about Birch and Tung, Miller immediately interviewed Tung, who had lost his leg and an eye. The autopsy report revealed that Birch had been shot in the leg, had his hands and ankles tied, and had been shot in the back of the head and bayonetted. Tung revealed to Miller that, after he heard the third shot, he was thrown into the ditch next to Birch. Two weeks later, the other prisoners were released. A number of different explanations and theories as to why Birch was killed have been proposed, including his party showing up at Huangkou instead of Ninchuan, Birch&#x27;s scheduled meeting with Chinese collaborationist troops of the Sixth Army under General Hu Bengzhu, a misunderstanding by local guerrillas, and provocation from Birch himself.

Birch, along with two American pilots who had died in a plane crash at the Xuzhou airport, were interred in side-by-side crypts. A Roman Catholic service was held in the cathedral in Xuzhou by Italian Jesuit priests, and 24 Chinese individuals carried the three American-flag-draped coffins in a procession to the burial site on the slope of Hung-lung Mountain, on the south side of Xuzhou. Final rites were given at the graveside by a Chinese Christian minister. Miller, who was a friend of Birch, was in charge of the funeral, and Chinese officers and Japanese soldiers gave the deceased full military honors.

Birch was the fifth of five OSS combat casualties in China.

== Military awards ==
U.S. Senator William F. Knowland attempted unsuccessfully to obtain posthumous awards for Birch, including the Distinguished Service Cross and the Purple Heart, but these were not approved on the grounds that the United States was not at war with the Communist Chinese in 1945. Captain Birch received the following military awards:


==John Birch Society==

Birch is mainly known today by the society that bears his name. The John Birch Society was established in Indianapolis, Indiana, during a two-day session on December 8 and 9, 1958, by a group of twelve led by Robert W. Welch Jr., a retired candy manufacturer and Conservative political activist from Belmont, Massachusetts. In 1954, Welch authored the first book about Birch titled &quot;The Life of John Birch: In the story of one American boy, the ordeal of his age&quot;. He organized the JBS to promote &quot;less government, more responsibility, and a better world&quot;. Welch named the new organization after Birch, saying that Birch was an unknown but dedicated anti-communist, and the first American casualty of the Cold War. Jimmy Doolittle, U.S. Army, Retired, who met Birch in China after Doolittle&#x27;s raid on Tokyo, Japan, said in his 1991 autobiography: &quot;[Birch] had no way of knowing that the John Birch Society, a highly vocal postwar anti-communist organization, would be named after him because its founders believed him to be the &#x27;first casualty of World War III.&#x27; I feel sure he would not have approved.&quot;

Welch received permission from Birch&#x27;s parents to name the JBS after their son, and both his mother and father participated in Society-related events.

<text>The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus, commonly referred to simply as Doctor Faustus, is an Elizabethan tragedy by Christopher Marlowe, based on German stories about the title character Faust. It was probably written in 1592 or 1593, shortly before Marlowe&#x27;s death. Two different versions of the play were published in the Jacobean era several years later.

The play is well-known for a famous line: &quot;Was this the face that launched a thousand ships / And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?&quot;, said by Faustus upon seeing a demon impersonating Helen. The line is a paraphrase of a statement from Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot;. It is frequently quoted out of context to convey astonishment at Helen&#x27;s beauty. However, in &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;, it is said to a devil posing as Helen, and is a response to the illusion; it may even express disappointment that she is not more beautiful. The German poet and polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe re-envisioned the meeting of Faust and Helen. In &quot;&quot;, the union of Helen and Faust becomes a complex allegory of the meeting of the classical-ideal and modern worlds.

==Performance==
The Admiral&#x27;s Men performed the play 23 times between September 1594 and October 1597. On 22 November 1602, the diary of Philip Henslowe recorded a £4 payment to Samuel Rowley and William Bird for additions to the play, which suggests a revival soon after that date.

The powerful effect of the early productions is indicated by the legends that quickly accrued around them. In &quot;Histriomastix&quot;, his 1632 polemic against the drama, William Prynne records the tale that actual devils once appeared on the stage during a performance of &quot;Faustus&quot;, &quot;to the great amazement of both the actors and spectators&quot;. Some people were allegedly driven mad, &quot;distracted with that fearful sight.&quot; John Aubrey recorded a related legend, that Edward Alleyn, lead actor of The Admiral&#x27;s Men, devoted his later years to charitable endeavours, like the founding of Alleyn&#x27;s College, in direct response to this incident.

==Text==
Given its source in the Historia von D. Johann Fausten, published as a chapbook in Germany in 1587, and the fact that the earliest known translation of the latter work into English was in 1592, the play was probably written in 1592 or 1593. It may have been entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 18 December 1592, though the records are confused and appear to indicate a conflict over the rights to the play. A subsequent Stationers&#x27; Register entry, dated 7 January 1601, assigns the play to the bookseller Thomas Bushell (variant written forms: Busshell or Bushnell), the publisher of the 1604 first edition. Bushell transferred his rights to the play to John Wright on 13 September 1610.

===The two versions===
Two versions of the play exist:
# The 1604 quarto, printed by Valentine Simmes for Thomas Bushell; this is usually called the A text. The title page attributes the play to &quot;Ch. Marl.&quot;. A second edition (A2) of first version was printed by George Eld for John Wright in 1609. It is merely a direct reprint of the 1604 text. The text is short for an English Renaissance play, only 1485 lines long.
# The 1616 quarto, published by John Wright, enlarged and altered the text and is usually called the B text. This second text was reprinted in 1619, 1620, 1624, 1631, and as late as 1663. Additions and alterations were made by the minor playwright and actor Samuel Rowley and by William Borne (or Birde), and possibly by Marlowe himself.

The 1604 version was once believed to be closer to the play as originally performed in Marlowe&#x27;s lifetime, simply because it was older. By the 1940s, after influential studies by Leo Kirschbaum and W. W. Greg, the 1604 version came to be regarded as an abbreviation, and the 1616 version as Marlowe&#x27;s original fuller version. Kirschbaum and Greg considered the A-text a &quot;bad quarto&quot;, and thought that the B-text was linked to Marlowe himself. Since then scholarship has swung the other way, most scholars now considering the A-text more authoritative, even if &quot;abbreviated and corrupt&quot;, according to Charles Nicholl.

The 1616 version omits 36 lines but adds 676 new lines, making it roughly one third longer than the 1604 version. Among the lines shared by both versions, there are some small but significant changes in wording; for example, &quot;Never too late, if Faustus can repent&quot; in the 1604 text becomes &quot;Never too late, if Faustus will repent&quot; in the 1616 text, a change that offers a very different possibility for Faustus&#x27;s hope and repentance.

Another difference between texts A and B is the name of the devil summoned by Faustus. Text A states the name is generally &quot;Mephistopheles&quot;, while the version of text B commonly states &quot;Mephostophilis&quot;. The name of the devil is in each case a reference to Mephistopheles in &quot;Faustbuch&quot;, the source work, which appeared in English translation in about 1588.

The relationship between the texts is uncertain and many modern editions print both. As an Elizabethan playwright, Marlowe had nothing to do with the publication and had no control over the play in performance, so it was possible for scenes to be dropped or shortened, or for new scenes to be added, so that the resulting publications may be modified versions of the original script.

===Comic scenes===
In the past, it was assumed that the comic scenes were additions by other writers. However, most scholars today consider the comic interludes an integral part of the play, regardless of their author, and so they continue to be included in print. Their tone shows the change in Faustus&#x27; ambitions, suggesting Marlowe did at least oversee the composition of them. The Clown is seen as the archetype for comic relief.

==Sources==
&quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; is based on an older tale; it is believed to be the first dramatisation of the Faust legend. Some scholars believe that Marlowe developed the story from a popular 1592 translation, commonly called &quot;The English Faust Book&quot;. There is thought to have been an earlier, lost German edition of 1587, the &quot;Historia von D. Johann Fausten&quot;, which itself may have been influenced by even earlier, equally ill-preserved pamphlets in Latin (such as those that likely inspired Jacob Bidermann&#x27;s treatment of the damnation of the doctor of Paris, &quot;Cenodoxus&quot; (1602)).

Several soothsayers or necromancers of the late fifteenth century adopted the name &quot;Faustus&quot;, a reference to the Latin for &quot;favoured&quot; or &quot;auspicious&quot;; typical was Georgius Faustus Helmstetensis, calling himself astrologer and chiromancer, who was expelled from the town of Ingolstadt for such practices. Subsequent commentators have identified this individual as the prototypical Faustus of the legend.

Whatever the inspiration, the development of Marlowe&#x27;s play is very faithful to the &quot;Faust Book&quot;, especially in the way it mixes comedy with tragedy.

However, Marlowe also introduced some changes to make it more original. He made four main additions:
*Faustus&#x27;s soliloquy, in Act 1, on the vanity of human science
*Good and Bad Angels
*The substitution of a Pageant of Devils for the seven deadly sins. He also emphasised Faustus&#x27;s intellectual aspirations and curiosity, and minimised the vices in the character, to lend a Renaissance aura to the story.
*The name Bruno in the rival Pope scenes recalls that of Giordano Bruno who was tried for heresy by the Inquisition and burnt at the stake in 1600. This reference indicates that Marlowe recognised the cosmic machinery of the Faust story as a reflection of terrestrial power and authority, by which dissidents were tortured and executed in the name of obedience and conformity.

==Structure==
The play is in blank verse and prose in thirteen scenes (1604) or twenty scenes (1616).

Blank verse is largely reserved for the main scenes; prose is used in the comic scenes. Modern texts divide the play into five acts; act 5 being the shortest. As in many Elizabethan plays, there is a chorus (which functions as a narrator), that does not interact with the other characters but rather provides an introduction and conclusion to the play and, at the beginning of some Acts, introduces events that have unfolded.

Along with its history and language style, scholars have critiqued and analysed the structure of the play. Leonard H. Frey wrote a document entitled &quot;In the Opening and Close of Doctor Faustus&quot;, which mainly focuses on Faustus&#x27;s opening and closing soliloquies. He stresses the importance of the soliloquies in the play, saying: &quot;the soliloquy, perhaps more than any other dramatic device, involved the audience in an imaginative concern with the happenings on stage&quot;. By having Doctor Faustus deliver these soliloquies at the beginning and end of the play, the focus is drawn to his inner thoughts and feelings about succumbing to the devil.

The soliloquies also have parallel concepts. In the introductory soliloquy, Faustus begins by pondering the fate of his life and what he wants his career to be. He ends his soliloquy with the solution: he will give his soul to the devil. Similarly in the closing soliloquy, Faustus begins pondering, and finally comes to terms with the fate he created for himself. Frey also explains: &quot;The whole pattern of this final soliloquy is thus a grim parody of the opening one, where decision is reached after, not prior to, the survey&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The Chorus explains that Faustus was low-born, but quickly achieved a doctorate in theology at the University of Wittenberg. However, his interest in learning and his pride soon led him to necromancy.

In the first scene of the play, Faustus expresses his boredom and impatience with the various branches of knowledge and concludes that only magic is worth learning. He asks his servant Wagner to return with the magicians Valdes and Cornelius, who have been trying to interest him in magic for some time. While he waits, he is visited by a Good Angel, who tries to dissuade him from this path, and a Bad Angel, who encourages him. Valdes and Cornelius arrive and declare that if Faustus devotes himself to magic, great things are indeed possible with someone of Faustus&#x27;s learning and intelligence.

While Faustus is at dinner with the magicians, two scholars notice Faustus&#x27;s absence and ask Wagner about his whereabouts. When Wagner tells them he is with Valdes and Cornelius, the scholars worry that the magicians have corrupted him and leave to inform the rector of the university.

Faustus attempts to conjure a devil, and Mephistophilis arrives. Faustus believes that he has summoned him, but Mephistophilis says that he came of his own accord, and that he serves Lucifer, and cannot do anything without his leave. Faustus questions Mephistophilis about Lucifer and Hell, and tells him to speak to Lucifer and return. The next scene is a comedic reflection in which Wagner calls two devils, with which he scares the Clown into serving him.

Mephistophilis returns, and Faustus signs a contract in his own blood: Mephistophilis will serve him for 24 years, at which point Lucifer will claim him, body and soul. Once the contract is signed, Faustus asks for a wife, but Mephistophilis declines, saying marriage is &quot;but a ceremonial toy&quot;; he asks for books of knowledge, and Mephistophilis provides a single book. In the corresponding comedic scene, Robin, a hostler, has stolen a conjuring book, and plans mischief with it.

Faustus begins to waver and think about God, and is visited again by the Good and Bad Angels. Lucifer arrives to remind him of his contract, and entertains him with a show of the Seven Deadly Sins. Faustus and Mephistophilis then travel Europe, eventually arriving in Rome, where they play tricks on the Pope. Next, Robin and Rafe (A version) or Dick (B version), having been caught for stealing a goblet, call on Mephistophilis, who arrives and angrily turns them into animals before returning to attend on Faustus. Faustus has been called to the court of the Holy Roman Emperor, where he and Mephistophilis conjure Alexander the Great and his paramour and give a knight cuckold&#x27;s horns for being a heckler. In the A version, the emperor asks Faust to relent, and he does; in the B version a longer scene follows in which the knight and his friends attack Faustus; all are given horns. In both versions, Faustus then plays tricks on a horse dealer. Faustus and Mephistophilis then put on a magic show for the Duke and Duchess of Vanholt.

When Faustus&#x27;s 24 years are nearly up, he bequeaths his possessions to Wagner. He conjures Helen of Troy for some students, and, when he starts to think of repenting again, renews his pledge to Lucifer and asks Mephistophilis for Helen as his lover. In the final scene, Faustus admits to some scholars that he has bargained away his soul; despite their prayers, the devils come for him.

==The Calvinist/anti-Calvinist controversy==
The theological implications of &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; have been the subject of considerable debate. Among the most complicated points of contention is whether the play supports or challenges the Calvinist doctrine of absolute predestination, which dominated the lectures and writings of many English scholars in the latter half of the sixteenth century. According to Calvin, predestination meant that God, acting of his own free will, elects some people to be saved and others to be damned—thus, the individual has no control over his own ultimate fate. This doctrine was the source of great controversy because it was seen by the so-called anti-Calvinists to limit man&#x27;s free will in regard to faith and salvation, and to present a dilemma in terms of theodicy.

At the time &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; was performed, this doctrine was on the rise in England, and under the direction of Puritan theologians at Cambridge and Oxford had come to be considered the orthodox position of the Church of England. Nevertheless, it remained the source of vigorous and, at times, heated debate between Calvinist scholars, such as William Whitaker and William Perkins, and anti-Calvinists, such as William Barrett and Peter Baro. The dispute between these Cambridge intellectuals had quite nearly reached its zenith by the time Marlowe was a student there in the 1580s, and likely would have influenced him deeply, as it did many of his fellow students.

Concerning the fate of Faustus, the Calvinist concludes that his damnation was inevitable. His rejection of God and subsequent inability to repent are taken as evidence that he never really belonged to the elect, but rather had been predestined from the very beginning for reprobation. For the Calvinist, Faustus represents the worst kind of sinner, having tasted the heavenly gift and rejected it. His damnation is justified and deserved because he was never truly adopted among the elect. According to this view, the play demonstrates Calvin&#x27;s &quot;three-tiered concept of causation,&quot; in which the damnation of Faustus is first willed by God, then by Satan, and finally, by himself.

== Themes and motifs ==
&quot;Ravished&quot; by magic (1.1.112), Faustus turns to the dark arts when law, logic, science, and theology fail to satisfy him. According to Charles Nicholl this places the play firmly in the Elizabethan period when the problem of magic (&quot;liberation or damnation?&quot;) was a matter of debate, and when Renaissance occultism aimed at a furthering of science. Nicholl, who connects Faustus as a &quot;studious artisan&quot; (1.1.56) to the &quot;hands-on experience&quot; promoted by Paracelsus, sees in the former a follower of the latter, a &quot;magician as technologist&quot;.

==Mephistophilis==

Mephistophilis is a demon whom Faustus conjures up while first using magic. Readers initially feel sympathy for the demon when he attempts to explain to Faustus the consequences of abjuring God and Heaven. Mephistophilis gives Faustus a description of Hell and the continuous horrors it possesses; he wants Faustus to know what he is getting himself into before going through with the bargain:

&lt;poem&gt;
Think&#x27;st thou that I who saw the face of God
And tasted the eternal joy of heaven
Am not tormented with ten thousand hells
In being deprived of everlasting bliss?
O Faustus, leave these frivolous demands
Which strikes a terror to my fainting soul!&lt;/poem&gt;

However, Faustus believes that supernatural powers are worth a lifetime in Hell:

&lt;poem&gt;
Say he (Faustus) surrender up to him (Lucifer) his soul
So he will spare him four and twenty years,
Letting him live in all voluptuousness
Having thee (Mephistophilis) ever to attend on me&lt;/poem&gt;

Some scholars argue that Mephistophilis depicts the sorrow that comes with separation from God. Mephistophilis is foreshadowing the pain Faustus would have to endure, should he go through with his plan. In this facet, Faustus can be likened to Icarus, whose ambition was the source of his misery and the cause of his death.

==Adaptations==
The first television adaptation was broadcast in 1947 by the BBC starring David King-Wood as Faustus and Hugh Griffith as Mephistopheles. In 1958, another BBC television version starred William Squire as Faustus in an adaptation by Ronald Eyre intended for schools. In 1961, the BBC adapted the play for television as a two-episode production starring Alan Dobie as Faustus; this production was also meant for use in schools.

The play was adapted for the screen in 1967 by Richard Burton and Nevill Coghill, who based the film on an Oxford University Dramatic Society production in which Burton starred opposite Elizabeth Taylor as Helen of Troy.

There have been several adaptations on BBC Radio and elsewhere:
* The first production on BBC Radio was broadcast on 29 June 1932, directed by Barbara Burnham with Ion Swinley as Faustus.

* The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast a full radio adaptation of the play with Kenneth Welsh as Faustus and Eric Peterson as Mephistopheles, later releasing it on audio cassette () in 2001 as part of its &quot;Great Plays of the Millennium&quot; series.
* Two live performances in London have been videotaped and released on DVD: one at the Greenwich Theatre in 2010 and one at the Globe Theatre in 2011 starring Paul Hilton as Faustus and Arthur Darvill as Mephistopheles.
* In 2020 the Beyond Shakespeare Company released on line a play-reading and discussion of the A Text.

==Critical history==

&quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; has raised much controversy due to Faust&#x27;s alleged interaction with the demonic realm. Before Marlowe, there were few authors who ventured into this kind of writing. After his play, other authors began to expand on their views of the spiritual world.

<doc id="423582" wikidata="Q1459081" url="?curid=423582" title="New economy">
<text>The New Economy refers to the ongoing development of the American economic system. It evolved from the notions of the classical economy via the transition from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based economy, and has been driven by new technology and innovations. This popular use of the term emerged during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, where high growth, low inflation, and high employment of this period led to optimistic predictions and flawed business plans.

==Origins==
A 1983 cover article in &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The New Economy&quot;, described the transition from heavy industry to a new technology based economy. By 1997, &quot;Newsweek&quot; was referring to the &quot;new economy&quot; in many of its articles.

After a nearly 25-year period of unprecedented growth, the United States experienced a much discussed economic slowdown beginning in 1972. However, around 1995, U.S. economic growth accelerated, driven by faster productivity growth. From 1972 to 1995, the growth rate of output per hour, a measure of labor productivity, had only averaged around one-percent per year. But by the mid 1990s, growth became much faster: 2.65 percent from 1995–99. America also experienced increased employment and decreasing inflation. The economist Robert J. Gordon referred to this as a Goldilocks economy—-the result of five positive &quot;shocks&quot;—–&quot;the two traditional shocks (food-energy and imports) and the three new shocks (computers, medical care, and measurement)&quot;.

Other economists pointed to the ripening benefits of the computer age, being realized after a delay much like that associated with the delayed benefits of electricity shortly after the turn of the twentieth century. Gordon contended in 2000, that the benefits of computers were marginal or even negative for the majority of firms, with their benefits being consolidated in the computer hardware and durable goods manufacturing sectors, which only represent a relatively small segment of the economy. His method relied on applying considerably sized gains in the business cycle to explain aggregate productivity growth.

According to the generally unaccepted Kondratiev wave theory of economy growth, the &quot;new economy&quot; is a current Kondratiev wave which will end after a 50-year period in the 2040s. Its innovative basis includes Internet, nanotechnologies, telematics and bionics.

==Dot-coms==
In the financial markets, the term has been associated with the Dot-com bubble. This included the emergence of the NASDAQ as a rival to the New York Stock Exchange, a high rate of IPOs, the rise of Dot-com stocks over established firms, and the prevalent use of tools such as stock options. In the wider economy the term has been associated with practices such as outsourcing, business process outsourcing and business process re-engineering.

At the same time, there was a lot of investment in companies in the technology sector. Stock shares rose dramatically. A lot of start-ups were created and the stock value was very high where floated. Newspapers and business leaders were starting to talk of new business models. Some even claimed that the old laws of economics did not apply anymore and that new laws had taken their place. They also claimed that improvements in computer hardware and software, would dramatically change the future, and that information is the most important value in the new economy.

Some, such as Joseph Stiglitz and Blake Belding, have suggested that a lot of investment in information technology, especially in software and unused fibre optics, was useless. However, this may be too harsh a judgment, given that U.S. investment in information technology has remained relatively strong since 2002. While there may have been some overinvestment, productivity research shows that much of the investment has been useful in raising output.

The recession of 2001 disproved many of the more extreme predictions made during the boom years, and gave credence to Gordon&#x27;s minimization of computers&#x27; contributions. However, subsequent research strongly suggests that productivity growth has been stimulated by heavy investment in information and communication technology.

<text>A sampan is a relatively flat-bottomed wooden boat found in East, Southeast, and South Asia. It is possibly of Chinese or Austronesian origin. Some sampans include a small shelter on board and may be used as a permanent habitation on inland waters. The design closely resembles Western hard chine boats like the scow or punt. Sampans are generally used for transportation in coastal areas or rivers and are often used as traditional fishing boats. It is unusual for a sampan to sail far from land, as they do not have the means to survive rough weather.

It is sometimes claimed that the word &quot;sampan&quot; is derived from the Cantonese term &quot;sāam báan&quot; (), literally &quot;three planks&quot;, but this is likely to be a false etymology. A possible Austronesian origin of the word has been suggested, as it is attested in an Old Malay inscription from 684 CE.

Sampans may be propelled by poles, oars (particularly a single, long stern sculling oar called a &quot;yuloh&quot; (simplified Chinese 摇橹/ traditional Chinese 搖櫓)) or may be fitted with outboard motors.

Sampans are still in use by rural residents of Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.

Malay communities in Southeast Asia also use the term sampan for their boats. Large boats such as &quot;sampan panjang&quot;, &quot;kolek&quot; and &quot;perahu panjang&quot; are used and built by the Malays and Orang Laut living in their coastal villages.

<doc id="423592" wikidata="Q1191079" url="?curid=423592" title="Yurikamome">
<text>, formerly the , is an automated guideway transit service operated by &quot;Yurikamome, Inc.&quot;, connecting Shimbashi to Toyosu, via the artificial island of Odaiba in Tokyo, Japan, a market in which it competes with the Rinkai Line.

The line is named after the black-headed gull (&quot;yurikamome&quot; in Japanese), a common denizen of Tokyo Bay and the official metropolitan bird.

==History==
Before its 1995 opening, it was widely feared that the Yurikamome would end up as a multibillion-yen white elephant. The artificial island of Odaiba, which it serves, had been designed and constructed at prodigious expense before Japan&#x27;s economic crash and, much like London&#x27;s equally beleaguered Canary Wharf, there simply did not seem to be enough demand to support it. On 1 November 1995, the section between Shimbashi and Ariake opened, using a temporary Shimbashi station. In the first few months of operation, ridership hovered around 27,000 passengers per day, only a little less than the predicted 29,000, but still far less than the 80,000 passengers needed to be profitable.

However, in 1996, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government re-zoned Odaiba from pure business and residential to also permit entertainment zones. The island provided Tokyo with a strip of livable seaside, and within one year, ridership doubled to 60,000. As more and more restaurants, shopping malls, exhibition centers and museums opened, traffic continued to grow. On 22 March 2001, the current Shimbashi station opened and the temporary station closed. Shiodome Station opened on 2 November 2002. On 27 March 2006, the section between Ariake and Toyosu opened and stations adopted letter and number codes based on Tokyo Metro.

It is not just the island that became popular, as the Yurikamome had become an attraction in itself. To raise itself from ground level to the Rainbow Bridge, the Yurikamome makes a 270-degree loop, providing panoramic views of both mainland Tokyo and Odaiba.

An accident on the Yurikamome occurred on the afternoon of 14 April 2006. According to a government commission, one of the axles on the six-car train was cracked due to metal fatigue, causing a rubber tire on the train to fall off. The train came to a halt near Fune-no-kagakukan station, and services were suspended on the entire line. This came at the start of a busy weekend when events were taking place at Tokyo Big Sight on Odaiba, but, according to news reports, alternate means of transportation were offered and there was no major confusion. The Yurikamome resumed limited train service on April 17 while further inspections and tests continued, with full service restored on 19 April.

On the morning of 14 August 2006, a large-scale power outage in the Tokyo metropolitan area occurred, causing trains to come to a complete halt on the elevated tracks, trapping passengers for nearly an hour.

On 16 March 2019, two stations were renamed: Fune-no-kagakukan became Tokyo International Cruise Terminal, and Kokusai-tenjijō-seimon became Tokyo Big Sight.

===Future plans===
At over 110,000 passengers per day, the Yurikamome is making a net profit and will pay off its loans in full faster than the 20 years originally anticipated. Operating frequency, hours of operation and number of trainsets have been continually revised upwards to accommodate the ever-increasing number of passengers.

A further extension from Toyosu to is currently under consideration. The extension has become more likely as part of infrastructure improvements for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which will largely be held within the Yurikamome corridor around Toyosu, Ariake and Odaiba, with six competition venues along its route.

==Technology==

The Yurikamome is Tokyo&#x27;s first fully automated and driverless transit system, controlled entirely by computers with no drivers on board. However, the line is not the first fully driverless transit line in Japan, as Kobe&#x27;s Port Liner opened in 1981, 14 years before the Yurikamome.

The Yurikamome is sometimes mistakenly called a monorail, but the trains run with rubber-tired wheels on elevated concrete track guided by the side walls.

==Stations==
Since 2006, all the stations use the recorded voices of different voice actors for their Japanese-language announcements. The letter &quot;U&quot; is used as the symbol for station numbers rather than &quot;Y&quot; for Yurikamome as this letter is already used as the acronym for the Tokyo Metro Yurakucho Line.

Yurikamome trains are taken in and out of service at Ariake, and are stored in a yard near Tokyo Big Sight when not in service.

== Ridership ==

Ridership on the line peaked at over 200,000 daily boardings in 2000, but declined substantially by 2004 as the Rinkai Line, which opened a year after the Yurikamome Line, expanded into more of the waterfront area and offered lower fares. Between 2004 and 2006, four new stations were added, which raised ridership slightly. As of 2023, daily ridership totals are roughly 97% of pre-pandemic levels with patronage shifting to the eastern end of the line.

==Rolling stock==
The line uses Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rubber-tired &quot;Crystal Mover&quot; technology. , the following train types are used on the line, all formed as six-car sets.
* 7000 series
* 7200 series 
* 7300 series
* 7500 series

Between 2014 and 2016, a fleet of 18 new six-car 7300 series trains are being introduced on the line. The first train was test run during the summer of 2013, entering revenue service from 18 January 2014. The new trains have longitudinal seating throughout, to increase overall capacity and speed-up boarding and alighting. Between June 2018 and June 2020, eight more six-car trainsets (7500-series) were built for the line by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to replace the fleet of 7200 series trains.

===7000 series===

, four out of the original eighteen 7000 series sets (05, 16, 17, and 18) were still in service, formed as six-car sets as follows.

<doc id="423594" wikidata="Q964391" url="?curid=423594" title="Robert Duncan (poet)">
<text>Robert Edward Duncan (January 7, 1919 – February 3, 1988) was an American poet and a devotee of Hilda &quot;H.D.&quot; Doolittle and the Western esoteric tradition who spent most of his career in and around San Francisco. Though associated with any number of literary traditions and schools, Duncan is often identified with the poets of the New American Poetry and Black Mountain College. Duncan saw his work as emerging especially from the tradition of Pound, Williams and Lawrence. Duncan was a key figure in the San Francisco Renaissance.

==Overview==
As a poet and intellectual, Duncan&#x27;s presence was felt across many facets of popular culture. His name is prominent in the history of pre-Stonewall gay culture and in the emergence of bohemian socialist communities of the 1930s and 1940s, in the Beat Generation, and in the cultural and political upheaval of the 1960s, influencing occult and gnostic circles of the time. During the later part of his life, Duncan&#x27;s work, published by City Lights and New Directions, came to be distributed worldwide, and his influence as a poet is evident today in both mainstream and avant-garde writing.

==Early life and education==
Duncan was born in Oakland, California, as Edward Howard Duncan Jr. His mother, Marguerite Pearl Duncan, had died in his childbirth. He was her tenth child and the delivery was at home to avoid the risks of contracting the so-called Spanish influenza at a medical facility. Duncan&#x27;s father was unable to afford him, so in 1920 he was adopted by Edwin and Minnehaha Symmes, a family of devout Theosophists. They renamed him Robert Edward Symmes in honor of a family friend. It was only after a psychiatric discharge from the army in 1941 that he formed the composite of his previous names and became Robert Edward Duncan.

The Symmeses had begun planning for the child&#x27;s arrival long prior to his adoption. There were terms for his adoption that had to be met: he had to be born at the time and place appointed by the astrologers, his mother was to die shortly after giving birth, and he was to be of Anglo-Saxon Protestant descent. His childhood was stable, and his parents were popular and social members of their community—Edwin was a prominent architect and Minnehaha devoted much of her time to volunteering and serving on committees. He grew up surrounded by the occult in one form or another; he was well aware of the circumstances of his fated birth and adoption and his parents carefully interpreted his dreams. The family adopted a second child, Barbara Eleanor Symmes, in 1920. She was born one year minus one day after Duncan, on January 6, 1920. She also was selected under circumstances similar to that of her brother; her presence was expected to bring good karma into the family.

At age three, Duncan was injured in an accident on the snow that resulted in his becoming cross-eyed and seeing double. In &quot;Roots and Branches&quot;, his second major book, he wrote: &quot;I had the double reminder always, the vertical and horizontal displacement in vision that later became separated, specialized into a near and a far sight. One image to the right and above the other. Reach out and touch. Point to the one that is really there.&quot;

After the death of his adopted father in 1936, Duncan started studying at the University of California, Berkeley. He began writing poems inspired in part by his left wing politics and acquired a reputation as a bohemian. His friends and influences included Mary and Lilli Fabilli, Virginia Admiral, and Pauline Kael, among others. He thrived as storyteller, poet, and fledgling bohemian, but by his sophomore year he had begun to drop classes and had quit attending obligatory military drills.

In 1938, he briefly attended Black Mountain College, but left after a dispute with faculty over the Spanish Civil War. He spent two years in Philadelphia and then moved to Woodstock, New York to join a commune run by James Cooney, where he worked on Cooney&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Phoenix&quot; and met both Henry Miller and Anaïs Nin.

==Duncan and homosexuality==
In 1938, while a sophomore at Berkeley, Duncan met graduate student Ned Fahs at a dance, and the two entered into Duncan&#x27;s first recorded homosexual relationship, which biographer Ekbert Faas describes as &quot;marriage-like&quot;. When Fahs graduated, Duncan followed him to Philadelphia, and the couple lived together first there and then in New York. They lived separately while Duncan attended Black Mountain College; by 1940, they were living together again, in Annapolis. The relationship ended not long after, and Fahs married a woman in 1941. Duncan continued to write poetry about Fahs for another twenty years.

In 1941 Duncan was drafted and declared his homosexuality to get discharged. In 1943, he had his first heterosexual relationship, which ended in a short, disastrous marriage. In 1944 Duncan had a relationship with the abstract expressionist painter Robert De Niro Sr.

Duncan&#x27;s name figures prominently in the history of pre-Stonewall gay culture. In 1944, Duncan wrote the landmark essay &quot;The Homosexual in Society.&quot; The essay, in which Duncan compared the plight of homosexuals with that of African Americans and Jews, was published in Dwight Macdonald&#x27;s journal &quot;politics&quot;. Duncan&#x27;s essay is considered a pioneering treatise on the experience of homosexuals in American society given its appearance a full decade before any organized gay rights movement (Mattachine Society). It made Duncan the first prominent American to reveal his homosexuality.

After the end of World War II, Duncan returned to the Bay Area, where he met the young Gerald M. Ackerman. The two entered into a relationship, living together in a boardinghouse in Berkeley, but broke up after a year. In 1950, Duncan met the artist Jess Collins, and in January 1951 the two men took marriage vows and moved in together. The two men collaborated on creative projects throughout their partnership, which lasted until Duncan&#x27;s death 37 years later.

==San Francisco==
Duncan returned to San Francisco in 1945 and was befriended by Helen Adam, Madeline Gleason, Lyn Brockway, and Kenneth Rexroth (with whom he had been in correspondence for some time). He returned to Berkeley to study Medieval and Renaissance literature and cultivated a reputation as a shamanistic figure in San Francisco poetry and artistic circles. His first book, &quot;Heavenly City Earthly City&quot;, was published by Bern Porter in 1947. In the early 1950s he started publishing in Cid Corman&#x27;s &quot;Origin&quot; and the &quot;Black Mountain Review&quot; and in 1956 he spent a time teaching at the Black Mountain College. &quot;Robert Duncan in San Francisco&quot; by Michael Rumaker, originally published in 2001, tells of this part of Duncan&#x27;s life.

==Mature works==
During the 1960s, Duncan achieved considerable artistic and critical success with three books; &quot;The Opening of the Field&quot; (1960), &quot;Roots and Branches&quot; (1969), and &quot;Bending the Bow&quot; (1968). These are generally considered to be his most significant works. His poetry is modernist in its preference for the impersonal, mythic, and hieratic, but Romantic in its privileging of the organic, the irrational and primordial, the not-yet-articulate blindly making its way into language like salmon running upstream:

&lt;poem&gt;
 Neither our vices nor our virtues
 further the poem. &quot;They came up
 and died
 just like they do every year
 on the rocks.

 The poem
 feeds upon thought, feeling, impulse,
 to breed itself,
 a spiritual urgency at the dark ladders leaping.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;The Opening of the Field&quot; begins with &quot;Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow&quot;, suggesting one interpretation of &quot;Field&quot; in the title. The book includes short lyric poems, a recurring sequence of prose poems called &quot;The Structure of Rime,&quot; and a long poem called &quot;Poem Beginning with a Line by Pindar&quot;. The long poem draws materials from Pindar, Francisco Goya, Walt Whitman, Ezra Pound, Charles Olson, and the myth of Cupid and Psyche into an extended visionary and ecstatic fugue in the mode of Pound&#x27;s &quot;Pisan Cantos&quot;. After &quot;Bending the Bow&quot;, Duncan vowed to avoid the distraction of publication for fifteen years. His friend and fellow poet Michael Palmer writes about this time in his essay &quot;Ground Work: On Robert Duncan&quot;:

His correspondence with the British academic and poet Eric Mottram, which began in 1971 and continued through to 1986, is published in &quot;The Unruly Garden: Robert Duncan and Eric Mottram, Letters and Essays&quot; (Peter Lang), edited by Amy Evans Bauer and Shamoon Zamir.

<doc id="423595" wikidata="Q7033477" url="?curid=423595" title="Night Stand with Dick Dietrick">
<text>Night Stand with Dick Dietrick is an American television comedy show that satirized American tabloid talk shows. The series was originally broadcast in first-run syndication from 1995 to 1997, as well as on the E! Entertainment Television network. &quot;Night Stand&quot; was co-created by Paul Abeyta, Peter Kaikko and actor/writer Timothy Stack, who also starred as the show&#x27;s host Dick Dietrick. The show benefited from contributions by writer/friends of the creators, namely co-exec producer Larry Strawther (the first season show-runner) and the long-time comedy writing team of Bob Iles and Jim Stein.

==History==
&quot;Night Stand&quot; premiered September 16, 1995 in syndication, running in over 87% of the US markets, mainly as a Saturday evening program airing against, or if carried by an NBC station, after &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. It also aired on E! Monday-Thursday at 10:30 p.m. (between &quot;Talk Soup&quot; and the &quot;Howard Stern&quot;) and was distributed internationally. The partnership with E! led to a follow-up second season.

Unlike other shows, each hour-long syndicated episode was actually divided into two separate half-hour programs which yielded 96 episodes for E! reruns. (E! kept the show for several years but only in reruns.)

Much of the &quot;Night Stand&quot; production team went on to work with Howard Stern on &quot;Son of the Beach,&quot; with some of their &quot;guests&quot; also making appearances.

A well-received parody of tabloid talk shows, &quot;Night Stand&quot; had plenty of funny scenes, but one scene unexpectedly went too far when Dietrick (Timothy Stack) tore the clothes off a male model named Kal (played by Kevin Light) to see if he could impress a seemingly uninterested young woman guest, Gloria Holt (played by Beth Tegarden) looking for dates in the episode &quot;Love on the Internet,&quot; produced in 1995. After ripping off his shirt, the model&#x27;s trousers were next, but Stack accidentally pulled Kal&#x27;s underwear down as well; as a result, there was a brief, unscripted showing of Light&#x27;s genitals, much to the shared shock of the audience and the performers. This scene has sometimes turned up on outtake and blooper programs such as &quot;It&#x27;ll be Alright on the Night.&quot;

&quot;Night Stand&quot; was the first production from Big Ticket Productions, the company formed by former Warner Bros. development executive Larry Lyttle. Strawther had worked with Abeyta and Kaikko at Merv Griffin Productions and later worked with Lyttle on the shows &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; and &quot;Night Court&quot;. Strawther brought on &quot;Night Court&quot; director Jim Drake and they developed the tape-four-shows-a-week format that made the show financially practical. Strawther did not return as showrunner for the second season after he and Stack differed on when silliness went &quot;over the top.&quot;

The show&#x27;s original slogan &quot;If you don&#x27;t have Night Stand, you don&#x27;t have Dick&quot; and &quot;The Comedy That Makes Up Talk&quot; was later changed to &quot;The Comedy That Makes Fun of Talk.&quot;

&quot;Night Stand&quot; helped Big Ticket Productions get started. They did even better on its next project, &quot;Judge Judy&quot;. The show&#x27;s original publicist was Howard Bragman, who is now considered one of Hollywood&#x27;s top publicists.

Produced: 1995–1999 (96 episodes, 2 shows per syndicated episode)

==Cast==
===Main===
*Timothy Stack as Dick Dietrick
*Peter Siragusa as Miller, Dick&#x27;s long-suffering assistant on the show. Beginning in season 2, the role was taken over by Robert Alan Beuth and the character renamed &quot;Mueller&quot;.
*Lynne Marie Stewart as Audience member (the lady in the frumpy dress with the glasses)

===Recurring guests===
*Christopher Darga as Bob, a frequent guest involved in various exploitative and depraved endeavors. When confronted by Dietrick, he would inevitably offer the unconvincing excuse, &quot;I&#x27;m sick. I need help.&quot; Darga and Vic Wilson (who also auditioned for the role of Bob) were well-remembered by Abeyta, Kaikko and Strawther who cast them as announcers Vic Romano and Kenny Blankenship a few years later on their cult hit, &quot;Most Extreme Elimination Challenge (MXC).&quot;
*Tim Silva as Dr. Lonnie Lanier, psychologist and expert. Like Stack himself, Silva was one of the many Groundlings graduates who appeared on the show.
*Steve Valentine as &#x27;The Astounding Andy&#x27;, hypnotist and magician

===Guest stars===
*Morgan Fairchild as Morgan Fairchild impersonator/herself
*Phil Hartman as Gunther Johann
*Rodney Dangerfield as himself (a clip of Rodney&#x27;s movie &quot;Meet Wally Sparks&quot; is shown)
*Garry Marshall as himself trying to promote his book &quot;Wake Me When It&#x27;s Funny&quot; while Dick was not too subtly trying to pitch a new action show &quot;Arctic Heat.&quot; 
*Mancow Muller as Mancow (&#x27;Eurotrash&#x27;)
*Jerry Springer as himself
*Harry Anderson as himself
*Jimmie Walker as himself; in one episode he becomes the new host of &quot;Night Stand Lite!&quot;, a Letterman-esque talk show parody that &quot;replaces&quot; Dick&#x27;s show

<doc id="423598" wikidata="Q1137351" url="?curid=423598" title="Golden Week (Japan)">
<text>or is a holiday period in Japan from 29 April to 5 May containing multiple public holidays. It is also known as .

One of Japan&#x27;s largest holiday periods of the year, Golden Week often sees a surge in vacation travel throughout the country. Despite the name, only 4 days of the week are officially designated as public holidays, with workers often opting to take the full week off. 

==Holidays celebrated== 
Golden Week encompasses the following public holidays.

Note that is a generic term for any official holiday. Until 2006, 4 May was an unnamed but official holiday because of a rule that converts any day between two holidays into a new holiday. Japan celebrates Labor Thanksgiving Day, a holiday with a similar purpose to May Day (as celebrated in Europe and North America). When a public holiday lands on a Sunday, the next day that is not already a holiday becomes a holiday for that year. In some cases, a is held on either 30 April or 6 May should any of the Golden Week holidays fall on Sunday; 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 have had Compensation Holidays for Shōwa Day, Children&#x27;s Day, Greenery Day, and Constitution Memorial Day, respectively.

==History==

The National Holiday Laws, promulgated in July 1948, declared nine official holidays. Since many were concentrated in a week spanning the end of April to early May, many leisure-based industries experienced spikes in their revenues. The film industry was no exception. In 1951, the film &quot;Jiyū Gakkō&quot; recorded higher ticket sales during this holiday-filled week than any other time in the year (including New Year&#x27;s and Obon). This prompted the managing director of Daiei Film Co., Ltd. to dub the week &quot;Golden Week&quot; based on the Japanese radio lingo &quot;golden time&quot;, which denotes the period with the highest listener ratings. At the time, 29 April was a national holiday celebrating the birth of the Shōwa Emperor. Upon his death in 1989, the day was renamed to . In 2007, Greenery Day was moved to 4 May, and 29 April was renamed Shōwa Day to commemorate the late Emperor. was celebrated from 1927 to 1948 and it is now called . Emperor Naruhito&#x27;s birthday is on 23 February.

The actual inventor of the slogan was either the company president Masaichi Nagata, or Hideo Matsuyama (jp), a Daiei Film executive and the later president of Dainichi Eihai who also coined the &quot;Silver Week&quot;.

===Transition to Reiwa period (2019)===
Golden Week in 2019 was particularly long due to the imperial transition, with the succession of new Emperor Naruhito, son of Emperor Emeritus Akihito and Empress Emerita Michiko, who reigned as an enthronement on 1 May, and as well as designated as an additional national holiday. This day was marks an official beginning of new Japanese period, Reiwa. As of between 29 April and 5 May are already holidays, this caused 30 April and 2 May to be public holidays as well, making 2019&#x27;s Golden Week at about ten consecutive days, from Saturday 27 April through Monday 6 May.

===Impact of COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021)===
From January 2020 to September 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, then-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that the Golden Week Festival will be cancelled the celebration at the first time amid the government declared the first state of emergency to prevent the spread of virus, which extended from 7 April to 29 May. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike urged to closed all schools, universities, and colleges, and as well as businesses in Kantō region were discouraged holiday travel during Golden Week to prevent the spread of infection. Japanese residents in Tokyo were advised to stay home for . The rebranded &quot;Stay Home Week to Save Lives&quot; ran from 25 April through 6 May. Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura urged closed schools on between 7 and 8 May, and businesses in Kansai region were encouraged to extend the holiday period through the weekend until 11 May. Also, in late April 2021, then-Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced that the Golden Week Festival will be cancelled the celebration at the second time amid the government declared the third state of emergency following COVID-19 infection surge.

Just two years after the cancellation of muted celebrations, Golden Week Festival has returned in Japan, which began between 29 April and 5 May 2022 (without the inssurence of a COVID-19 state of emergency (during the Omicron time in the first 18-month-period)). Although many Golden Week festivals are resumed including Hakata Dontaku, Hamamatsu Kite Festival, Hiroshima Flower Festival, and among others, which held across the nationwide for the first time since the Reiwa period begin in 2019.

==Current practice==
Many Japanese nationals take paid time off during this holiday, and some companies are closed down completely and give their employees time off. Golden Week is the longest vacation period of the year for many Japanese workers.

===Travel===
Golden Week is a popular time for holiday travel, such as many Japanese travel domestically and to a lesser extent internationally.

===Festivals===
The Takatsuki Jazz Street Festival is held during Golden Week. It has two days of live jazz performances with 300 acts and over 3,000 artists in 72 different locations in-and-around the center of Takatsuki in northern Osaka.

===Sports===
The Super GT Fuji 500 km car race is held on 4 May and has become synonymous with that date in Golden Week, but it was cancelled amid COVID-19 infection surge. The race returned from 2021 onwards.

<text>A Daughter of the Snows (1902) is Jack London&#x27;s first novel. Set in the Yukon, it tells the story of Frona Welse, &quot;a Stanford graduate and physical Valkyrie&quot; who takes to the trail after upsetting her wealthy father&#x27;s community by her forthright manner and befriending the town&#x27;s prostitute. She is also torn between love for two suitors: Gregory St Vincent, a local man who turns out to be cowardly and treacherous; and Vance Corliss, a Yale-trained mining engineer.

The novel is noteworthy for its strong and self-reliant heroine, one of many who would people his fiction. Her name echoes that of his mother, Flora Wellman, though her inspiration has also been said to include London&#x27;s friend Anna Strunsky.

Modern commentators have criticized the novel for its approval of the main character&#x27;s view that Anglo-Saxons are racially superior.

The novel was commissioned by publisher S. S. McClure, who provided London a $125 a month stipend to write it.

<doc id="423602" wikidata="Q3198167" url="?curid=423602" title="Gibbeting">
<text>Gibbeting is the use of a gallows-type structure from which the dead or dying bodies of criminals were hanged on public display to deter other existing or potential criminals. Occasionally, the gibbet () was also used as a method of public execution, with the criminal being left to die of exposure, thirst and/or starvation. The practice of placing a criminal on display within a gibbet is also called &quot;hanging in chains&quot;.

== Display ==


Gibbeting was a common law punishment, which a judge could impose in addition to execution. As a sentence for murder, this practice was codified in England by the Murder Act 1751. It was most often used for traitors, robbers, murderers, highwaymen, and pirates and was intended to discourage others from committing similar offenses. The structures were therefore often placed next to public highways (frequently at crossroads) and waterways.

Exhibiting a body could backfire against a monarch, especially if the monarch was unpopular. The rebels Henry of Montfort and Henry of Wylynton, enemies of Edward II, were drawn and hanged before being exhibited on a gibbet near Bristol. However, the people made relics of these bloody and mutilated remains out of respect and later used the relics in violent protest. Miracles were even reported at the spot where the bodies were hanging.

Although the intention was deterrence, the public response was complex. Samuel Pepys expressed disgust at the practice. There was Christian objection that prosecution of criminals should end with their death. The sight and smell of decaying corpses was offensive and regarded as &quot;pestilential&quot;, so it was seen as a threat to public health.

Pirates were sometimes executed by hanging on a gibbet erected close to the low-water mark by the sea or a tidal section of a river. Their bodies would be left dangling until they had been submerged by the tide three times. In London, Execution Dock is located on the north bank of the River Thames in Wapping; after tidal immersion, particularly notorious criminals&#x27; bodies could be hung in cages a little farther downstream at either Cuckold&#x27;s Point or Blackwall Point, as a warning to other waterborne criminals of the possible consequences of their actions (such a fate befell Captain William Kidd in May 1701). There were objections that these displays offended foreign visitors and did not uphold the reputation of the law, though the scenes even became gruesome tourist attractions.

=== Variants ===
In some cases, the bodies would be left until their clothes rotted or even until the bodies were almost completely decomposed, after which the bones would be scattered.

In cases of drawing and quartering, the body of the criminal was cut into four or five portions, with the several parts often gibbeted in different places.
So that the public display might be prolonged, bodies were sometimes coated in tar or bound in chains. Sometimes, body-shaped iron cages were used to contain the decomposing corpses. For example, in March 1743 in the town of Rye, East Sussex, Allen Grebell was murdered by John Breads. Breads was imprisoned in the Ypres Tower and then hanged, after which his body was left to rot for more than 20 years in an iron cage on Gibbet Marsh. The cage, with Breads&#x27;s skull clamped within the headframe, is still kept in the town hall.

Another example of the cage variation is the gibbet iron, on display at the Atwater Kent Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The cage, created in 1781, was intended to be used to display the body of convicted pirate Thomas Wilkinson, so that sailors on passing ships might be warned of the consequences of piracy; Wilkinson&#x27;s planned execution never took place, so the gibbet was never used.

An example of an iron cage used to string up bodies on a gibbet can still be seen in the Westgate Museum at Winchester.

== Historical examples ==

=== Antiquity ===
The Old Testament and Torah law forbid gibbeting beyond sunrise of the next day that the body is hanged on the tree. Public crucifixion with prolonged display of the body after death can be seen as a form of gibbeting. Gibbeting was one of the methods said by Tacitus and Cassius Dio to have been used by Boudica&#x27;s army in the massacre of Roman settlers in the destruction of Camulodunum (Colchester), Londinium (London) and Verulamium (St. Albans) in AD 60–61.

=== Bermuda ===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, gibbets were a common sight in Bermuda. Located in Smith&#x27;s Parish at the entrance to Flatt&#x27;s Inlet is Gibbet Island, which was used to hang the bodies of escaped slaves as a deterrent to others. The small island was used for this purpose because it was not on the mainland and therefore satisfied the beliefs of locals who did not want gibbets near their homes.

=== Canada ===

Marie-Josephte Corriveau (1733–1763), better known as &quot;La Corriveau&quot;, is one of the most popular figures in Québécois folklore. She lived in New France, was sentenced to death by a military tribunal of twelve British officers for the murder of her second husband, was hanged for it, and her body hung in chains. Her story has become legendary in Quebec, and she is the subject of numerous books and plays.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy used Hangman&#x27;s Beach on McNab&#x27;s Island in Halifax Harbour to display the hanged bodies of deserters, in order to deter the crews of passing warships.

=== Colony of New South Wales ===
Pinchgut Island (originally Mat-te-wan-ye in the local Aboriginal language; later, Rock Island when renamed by Governor Arthur Phillip), a rocky outcrop within Port Jackson, is the location of Fort Denison and a former gibbeting site. Thomas Hill, a convict, was sentenced to a week on the rock in iron chains with only bread and water to consume; these conditions are said to have &quot;literally pinched his gut&quot;, giving the island its current name. The rock was levelled in the 1790s, and a gibbet installed in 1796. Another convict, Francis Morgan, was sent to New South Wales for life following a murder conviction in 1793; he later killed again in 1796 and was hanged in chains on Pinchgut in November 1796. Morgan&#x27;s dead body and, later, skeleton remained on display on the island for four years.

=== England ===
Robert Aske, who led the rebellion against Henry VIII known as Pilgrimage of Grace, was hanged in chains in 1537.

The head of Oliver Cromwell was displayed on a spike after his death, after monarchists disinterred his body during the restoration of the monarchy.

===Germany===
The leaders of the Anabaptist movement in Münster were executed in 1536; their dead bodies were gibbeted in iron cages hanging from the steeple of St. Lambert&#x27;s Church, and the cages are still on display there today. Similarly, following his execution by hanging in 1738, the corpse of Jewish financier Joseph Süß Oppenheimer was gibbeted in a human-sized bird cage that hung outside of Stuttgart on the so-called Pragsattel (the public execution place at the time) for six years, until the inauguration of Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg, who permitted the hasty burial of his corpse at an unknown location.

=== The Netherlands ===
After the siege and capture of the city of Zutphen in 1591 by the Anglo-Dutch army, the English dug up the body of the former English commander Rowland York and hanged and gibbeted it as a reminder of York&#x27;s treachery in 1587. He had handed over the Zutphen sconce to the Spaniards after the English army under the Earl of Leicester was defeated by the Spaniards in the Battle of Zutphen.

=== Iran ===
In 838, the Iranian and Azerbaijani hero Babak Khorramdin had his hands and feet cut off by the Abbasid Caliphate and was then gibbeted alive while sewn into a cow&#x27;s skin with the horns at ear level to crush his head gradually as the skin dried out.

===Malta===
On 4 February 1820, six British pirates were hanged on their vessel in the middle of the harbour at Valletta. Thereafter, their bodies were hung in gibbets erected at the bastions of Fort Ricolli. Lieutenant Hobson of , in the tender &quot;Frederick&quot;, had apprehended them and their vessel in the harbour at Smyrna.

=== United States ===
During the colonial era, Bird Island and Nix&#x27;s Mate island in Boston Harbor were used for gibbeting pirates and sailors executed for crimes in Massachusetts. Their bodies were left hanging as a warning to sailors coming into the harbor and approaching Boston. In 1755, a slave named Mark was hanged in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and then gibbeted in chains in Charlestown, Massachusetts; twenty years later, Paul Revere passed the remains of Mark on his famous ride.

Six men were executed by gibbeting under civil authority in the Southern Colonies. In Virginia, three men accused of piracy were executed by gibbeting in 1700. In South Carolina, three men were executed by gibbeting: one accused of poisoning in 1744, and two accused of murder in 1754 and 1759.

There have been no recorded executions using this method under the authority of the United States. However, a gang of Cuban pirates were gibbeted in New York .

== Last recorded gibbetings ==

=== Afghanistan ===
The January 1921 issue of &quot;The National Geographic Magazine&quot; contains two photographs of gibbet cages, referenced as &quot;man-cages,&quot; in use in Afghanistan. Commentary included with the photograph indicates that the gibbet was a practice still in active use. Persons sentenced to death were placed alive in the cage and remained there until some undefined time weeks or months after their deaths.

=== Australia ===
In 1837, five years after the practice had ceased in England, the body of John McKay was gibbeted near the spot where he had murdered Joseph Wilson near Perth, in the colony of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. There was a great outcry, but the body was not removed until an acquaintance of Wilson passed the spot and, horrified by the spectacle of McKay&#x27;s rotting corpse, pleaded with the authorities to remove it. The place where this occurred was just to the right (when travelling towards Launceston, not to be confused with the private road with the same name) on the Midlands Highway on the northern side of Perth.

In the Colony of Western Australia, gibbeting of executed Indigenous people continued into the mid-1850s. In 1855, Aboriginal men Yandan and Yoongal were executed in Perth for separate murders, with their bodies then &quot;conveyed under escort to York, there to be suspended in some conspicuous part of the district, where such a spectacle would be likely to prove a warning, and prevent a repetition of the murders which have of late been prevalent in the neighbourhood&quot;.

=== United Kingdom ===
Hanging a body in chains was a post execution punishment that was used for those criminals who had committed heinous crimes such as murder. Smugglers were not usually hung in chains post execution. However during the mid eighteenth century a smuggling gang known as the Hawkhurst Gang, operated along the South coast of England between Kent and Dorset; their violent crimes coincided with the authorities desire to punish smugglers on the South coast and deter others from smuggling. Of the 75 members of the gang that were caught and convicted 14 were sentenced to gibbeting. Unusually the bodies were distributed around the area as a deterrent, rather than near where they lived, or the scene of the crime.

The Murder Act 1751 (25 Geo. 2. c. 37) stipulated that &quot;in no case whatsoever shall the body of any murderer be suffered to be buried&quot;; the cadaver was either to be publicly dissected or left &quot;hanging in chains&quot;. The use of gibbeting had been in decline for some years before it was formally repealed by the (4 &amp; 5 Will. 4. c. 26). In Scotland, the final case of gibbeting was that of Alexander Gillan in 1810. The last two men gibbeted in England were William Jobling and James Cook, both in 1832. Their cases are good examples of the changing attitudes toward the practice.

William Jobling was a miner hanged and gibbeted for the murder of Nicholas Fairles, a colliery owner and local magistrate, near Jarrow, Durham. After being hanged, the body was taken off the rope and loaded into a cart and taken on a tour of the area before arriving at Jarrow Slake, where the crime had been committed. Here, the body was placed into an iron gibbet cage. The cage and the scene were described thus:

The gibbet was a in diameter with strong bars of iron up each side. The post was fixed into a stone base sunk into the Slake. The body was soon removed by fellow miners and given a decent burial.

James Cook was a bookbinder convicted of the murder of his creditor Paas, a manufacturer of brass instruments, in Leicester. During an attempted robbery, Cook beat Paas to death, and then took the body to his home, where he cut it into pieces and burned it to try to hide the evidence of the crime. He was executed on Friday, 10 August 1832, in front of Leicester prison. Afterwards:

His body was to be displayed on a purpose-built gallows high in Saffron Lane near the Aylestone Tollgate. According to &quot;The Newgate Calendar&quot;:

Although the practice of gibbeting had been abandoned by 1834 in Britain, during the British Raj of India in 1843, Charles James Napier threatened to have such structures built in parallel to any attempt to practice Sati, the ritualized burning of widows, to execute the perpetrators.
== In popular culture ==

Works of art depicting gibbeting include:

* Known as &quot;Le Gibet&quot;, the second movement of composer Maurice Ravel&#x27;s piano suite &quot;Gaspard de la nuit&quot; is based on the poems of Aloysius Bertrand.
* The 2006 film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; features a prisoner in a gibbet in one of the opening scenes, where he is graphically pecked to death by crows.
* In the Orson Welles film &quot;Othello&quot;, Iago&#x27;s fate is to be gibbeted.
* In the 1988 fantasy classic &quot;Willow&quot;, Val Kilmer&#x27;s character Madmartigan is suspended in a gibbet at the beginning of the film.

<text>The Iron Heel is a dystopian and political novel in the form of science fiction by American writer Jack London, first published in 1908.

==Plot==
The main premise of the book is the rise of a socialist mass movement in the United Statesstrong enough to have a real chance of winning national elections, getting to power, and implementing a radical socialist regime. Conservatives feel alarmed and threatened by this prospect, to the point of seizing power and establishing a brutal dictatorship in order to avert it.

The novel is told via the framing device of a manuscript found centuries after the action takes place and footnotes by a scholar, Anthony Meredith, circa 2600 AD or 419 B.O.M. (the Brotherhood of Man). Jack London writes at two levels, sporadically having Meredith correcting the errors of Avis Everhard through his own future prism, while at the same time exposing the often incomplete understanding of this distant future perspective. Meredith&#x27;s introduction also reveals that the protagonist&#x27;s efforts will fail, giving the work an air of foreordained tragedy.

The story proper begins with Avis Everhard, a daughter of a renowned physicist, John Cunningham, and future wife of socialist Ernest Everhard. At first, Avis Everhard does not agree with Ernest&#x27;s assertion that the whole contemporary social system is based on exploitation of labour. She proceeds to investigate the conditions the workers live in, and those terrible conditions make her change her mind and accept Ernest&#x27;s worldview. Similarly, Bishop Morehouse does not initially believe in the horrors described by Ernest but then becomes convinced of their truth and is confined to a madhouse because of his new views.

The story covers the years 1912 through 1932 in which the Oligarchy (or &quot;Iron Heel&quot;) arises in the United States. Japan conquers East Asia and creates its own empire, India gains independence, and Europe becomes socialist. Canada, Mexico, and Cuba form their own Oligarchies and are aligned with the U.S. (London remains silent as to events transpiring in the rest of the world.)

In North America, the Oligarchy maintains power for three centuries until the Revolution succeeds and ushers in the Brotherhood of Man. During the years of the novel, the First Revolt is described and preparations for the Second Revolt are discussed. From the perspective of Everhard, the imminent Second Revolt is sure to succeed. Given Meredith&#x27;s frame story, the reader knows that Ernest Everhard&#x27;s hopes will go unfulfilled until centuries after his death.

The Oligarchy is the largest monopoly of trusts (or robber barons) who manage to squeeze out the middle class by bankrupting most small to mid-sized business as well as reducing all farmers to effective serfdom. This Oligarchy maintains power through a &quot;labor caste&quot; and the Mercenaries. Laborers in essential industries like steel and rail are elevated and given decent wages, housing, and education. Indeed, the tragic turn in the novel (and Jack London&#x27;s core warning to his contemporaries) is the treachery of these favored unions which break with the other unions and side with the Oligarchy. Further, a second, military caste is formed: the Mercenaries. The Mercenaries are officially the army of the US but are in fact in the employ of the Oligarchs.

Asgard is the name of a fictional wonder-city, constructed by the Oligarchy to be admired and appreciated as well as lived in. Thousands of proletarians live in terrible poverty there, and are used whenever a public work needs to be completed, such as the building of a levee or a canal.

==Publication history and reception==
&quot;The Iron Heel&quot; was published in 1908 by George Platt Brett Sr., who suggested only the deletion of a footnote which he deemed libelous before publication. It sold 50,000 copies in hardcover but generally did not earn the praise of critics. A reviewer in &quot;The Outlook&quot; concluded that &quot;as a work of fiction it has little to commend it, and as a socialist tract it is distinctly unconvincing&quot;.

==Analysis==
The book is considered to be &quot;the earliest of the modern dystopian fiction&quot;, in the form of social science fiction as employed by novels such as &quot;We&quot;, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, and &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot;.

The book is unusual among London&#x27;s writings (and in the literature of the time in general) in being a first-person narrative of a woman protagonist written by a man.

==Influences and effects==
&quot;The Iron Heel&quot; is cited by George Orwell&#x27;s biographer Michael Shelden as having influenced Orwell&#x27;s most famous novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Orwell himself described London as having made &quot;a very remarkable prophecy of the rise of Fascism&quot; and believed that London&#x27;s understanding of the primitive had made him a better prophet &quot;than many better-informed and more logical thinkers.&quot;
Specifically, Orwell&#x27;s protagonist Winston Smith, like London&#x27;s Avis Everhard, keeps a diary where he writes down his rebellious thoughts and experiences. However, while Everhard&#x27;s diary remained hidden during the centuries of tyranny to be discovered and published later, Smith&#x27;s diary falls into the hands of the book&#x27;s harsh Thought Police, whose interrogator tells Smith not to expect posterity to vindicate him: &quot;Posterity will never hear of you, we will vaporize you&quot;.

Harry Bridges, influential labor leader in the mid-1900s, was &quot;set afire&quot; by Jack London&#x27;s &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; and &quot;The Iron Heel.&quot;

Granville Hicks, reviewing Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Player Piano&quot;, was reminded of &quot;The Iron Heel&quot;: &quot;we are taken into the future and shown an America ruled by a tiny oligarchy, and here too there is a revolt that fails.&quot;

Chapter 7 of &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; is an almost verbatim copy of an ironic essay by Frank Harris.

==Adaptations==
The novel has been adapted into two Russian films: &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; (1919) and &quot;The Iron Heel of Oligarchy&quot; (1999). The first was produced in the immediate aftermath of the October Revolution, and the second was produced when real-life Oligarchs came to dominate the economy of post-Soviet Russia.

A stage adaptation by Edward Einhorn was produced in 2016 in New York. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;it serves up food for thought with an appealing heart-on-sleeve warmth&quot;.

<doc id="423606" wikidata="Q1317839" url="?curid=423606" title="Martin Eden">
<text>Martin Eden is a 1909 novel by American author Jack London about a young proletarian autodidact struggling to become a writer. It was first serialized in &quot;The Pacific Monthly&quot; magazine from September 1908 to September 1909 and then published in book form by Macmillan in September 1909.

Eden represents writers&#x27; frustration with publishers. The central theme of Eden&#x27;s developing artistic sensibilities places the novel in the tradition of the &quot;Künstlerroman&quot;, which narrates an artist&#x27;s formation and development.

Eden differs from London in rejecting socialism, attacking it as &quot;slave morality&quot; and relying on Nietzschean individualism. Nevertheless, in the copy of the novel which he inscribed for Upton Sinclair, London wrote, &quot;One of my motifs, in this book, was an attack on individualism (in the person of the hero). I must have bungled it, for not a single reviewer has discovered it.&quot;

== Plot summary ==
Living in Oakland at the beginning of the 20th century, Martin Eden struggles to rise above his destitute, proletarian circumstances through an intense and passionate pursuit of self-education, hoping to achieve a place among the literary elite. His principal motivation is his love for Ruth Morse. Because Eden is a rough, uneducated sailor from a working-class background and the Morses are a bourgeois family, a union between them would be impossible unless and until he reached their level of wealth and refinement.

Over a period of two years, Eden promises Ruth that success will come, but just before it does, Ruth loses her patience and rejects him in a letter, saying, &quot;if only you had settled down ... and attempted to make something of yourself&quot;. By the time Eden attains the favor of the publishers and the bourgeoisie who had shunned him, he has already developed a grudge against them and become jaded by toil and unrequited love. Instead of enjoying his success, he retreats into a quiet indifference, interrupted only to rail mentally against the gentility of bourgeois society or to donate his new wealth to working-class friends and family. He feels that people do not value him for himself or for his work but only for his fame.

== Main characters ==

=== Martin Eden ===
A former sailor from a working-class background, who falls in love with the young, bourgeois Ruth and educates himself to become a writer, aiming to win her hand in marriage.

=== Ruth Morse ===
The young, bourgeois university student who captivates Eden while tutoring him in English. Though initially both attracted and repelled by his working-class background, she eventually realizes she loves him. They become engaged, with the condition that they cannot marry until her parents approve of his financial and social status.

=== Lizzie Connolly ===
A cannery worker rejected by Eden, who is already in love with Ruth. Initially, while Eden strives for education and culture, Lizzie&#x27;s rough hands make her seem inferior to Ruth in his eyes. Despite this, Lizzie remains devoted to him. He feels an attachment to her because she has always loved him for who he is, and not for fame or money, as Ruth does.

=== Joe Dawson ===
Eden&#x27;s boss at the laundry, who wins Eden over with his cheeriness and capacity for work, but, like Eden, suffers from overwork. He quits the laundry and tries to convince Eden to adopt a hobo lifestyle. Toward the end of the book, Eden meets him again, and offers him a laundry. Joe, who likes the hobo life, except for the lack of girls, eventually accepts the offer and promises to treat the employees fairly.

=== Russ Brissenden ===
A sickly writer who encourages Eden to give up writing and return to the sea before city life swallows him up. Brissenden is a committed socialist and introduces Eden to a group of amateur philosophers he calls the &quot;real dirt&quot;. His final work, &quot;Ephemera&quot;, causes a literary sensation when Eden breaks his word and publishes it upon Brissenden&#x27;s death.

== Major themes ==

=== Social class ===
Social class, seen from Eden&#x27;s point of view, is a very important theme in the novel. Eden is a sailor from a working-class background who feels uncomfortable but inspired when he meets the bourgeois Morse family. As he improves himself, he finds himself increasingly distanced from his working-class background and surroundings, becoming repelled by Lizzie&#x27;s hands. Eventually, when Eden finds that his education has far surpassed that of the bourgeoisie he looked up to, he feels more isolated than ever. Paul Berman comments that Eden cannot reconcile his &quot;civilized and clean&quot; self with the &quot;fistfighting barbarian&quot; of the past, and that this inability causes his descent into a delirious ambivalence.

=== Human consciousness ===
The word consciousness, or variations of it, shows up sixty-two times in the novel, making an appearance in the context of many theoretical discussions about the nature of human consciousness. Martin Eden embraces the concept of &quot;henidical mental processes&quot;, coined by Otto Weininger in his 1903 work, &quot;Geschlecht und Charakter&quot;.
=== Individualism versus socialism ===

Although London was a socialist, he invested Eden with strong individualism. Eden comes from a working-class background but he seeks self-improvement rather than improvement for his class as a whole. Quoting Nietzsche and Herbert Spencer, he rejects the &quot;slave morality&quot; of socialism, even at socialist meetings. London stresses that it is this individualism that leads to Eden&#x27;s suicide.

=== Machinery ===

London conjures up a series of allusions to the workings of machinery. It is machines that make Lizzie&#x27;s hands rough. To Eden, the magazine editors operate a machine that sends out seemingly endless rejection slips. When Eden works in a laundry, he works with machines but feels himself to be a cog in a larger machine. Eden&#x27;s Blickensdorfer typewriter gradually becomes an extension of his body. When he finally achieves literary success, Eden sets up his friends with machinery of their own, and Lizzie tells him, &quot;Something&#x27;s wrong with your think-machine.&quot;

=== Suicide===
London made suicide a prevalent subject in the book as Eden&#x27;s mentor and one of his closest friends, Russ Brissenden, takes his own life. After his death, Eden publishes &quot;Ephemera&quot; against Brissenden&#x27;s final wishes. The protagonist later meets a similar fate, plunging himself deep into the Pacific Ocean, to a point of no return to the surface. Eden&#x27;s fate has drawn some comparisons to London&#x27;s own death. London had written of a drunken attempt at suicide at the age of 16, while at sea, later noting he was &quot;in a drug-dream dragging me to death.&quot; 

The circumstances of London&#x27;s death have been debated by many, some have considered it likely to be a suicide. London&#x27;s manservant - the first on the scene at his deathbed - claimed he found a piece of paper on which London had calculated the exact dose of morphine necessary to end his life. This testimony was rejected by London&#x27;s family members, and the whereabouts of the paper, if it ever existed, are long since lost.

== Background ==
When London wrote &quot;Martin Eden&quot; at age 33, he had already achieved international acclaim with &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; and &quot;White Fang&quot;. Despite the acclaim, he quickly became disillusioned with his fame and set sail through the South Pacific on a self-designed ketch, the &quot;Snark&quot;. On the grueling two-year voyage, as he struggled with tiredness and bowel diseases, he wrote &quot;Martin Eden&quot;, filling its pages with his frustrations, adolescent gangfights and struggles for artistic recognition. In his notes for the novel, he initially entitled it &quot;God&#x27;s Own Mad Lover&quot;.

London borrowed the name &quot;Martin Eden&quot; from a working-class man, Mårten Edin, born in Ådalen (at Båtsmanstorpet in Västgranvåg, Sollefteå), Sweden, but the character has more in common with London than with Edin. Ruth Morse was modeled on Mabel Applegarth, the first love of London&#x27;s life.

Brissenden is modeled on London&#x27;s friend and muse George Sterling. Brissenden&#x27;s posthumously successful poem &quot;Ephemera&quot; is based on Sterling&#x27;s &quot;A Wine of Wizardry&quot;.

== Reception ==
On January 16, 1910, with London in the audience, Charles R. Brown, pastor of the First Congregational Church in Oakland, California, gave a sermon entitled &quot;London&#x27;s latest book: Martin Eden.&quot; He charged that Eden and London were one and the same and that &quot;Jack London does not believe in God.&quot; London responded in a public letter.I wrote Martin Eden, not as an autobiography, nor as a parable or what dire end awaits an unbeliever in God, but as an indictment of that pleasant, wild-beast struggle of individualism. He fought for entrance into the bourgeouise circles where he expected to find refinement, culture, high-living and high-thinking. He won his way into those circles and was appalled by the colossal, unlovely mediocrity of the bourgeousie. Being a consistent Individualist, being unaware of the collective human need, there remained nothing for which to live and fight. And so he died. Jonah Raskin referred to the book as a &quot;critique of the American Dream and meditation on the nightmare of success.&quot;

<text>The Valley of the Moon (1913) is a novel by American writer Jack London. The valley where it is set is located north of the San Francisco Bay Area in Sonoma County, California where Jack London was a resident; he built his ranch in Glen Ellen.

==Plot summary==

The novel &quot;The Valley of the Moon&quot; is a story of a working-class couple, Billy and Saxon Roberts, struggling laborers in Oakland at the Turn-of-the-Century, who leave city life behind and search Central and Northern California for suitable farmland to own. The book is notable for its scenes in which the proletarian heroes enjoy fellowship with the artists&#x27; colony in Carmel, and their settling in the &quot;Valley of the Moon&quot;.

===Beginnings===
The book begins with Billy as a Teamster and Saxon working in a laundry. Billy has also boxed professionally with some success, but decided there was no future in it. He was particularly upset by one bout in which he was fighting a friend and they had to continue fighting and making a good show of it after his friend injured a hand.

Billy and Saxon&#x27;s early married life is disrupted by a major wave of strikes. Billy is involved in violent attacks on strikebreakers, and goes to jail. Saxon loses her baby in the backwash of the violence. She hears socialist arguments but does not definitively accept them, later meeting an old woman with an individualist view on relationships, describing how she successfully attached herself to a series of rich men. She also meets a lad called Jack who has built his own boat and seems to be based on Jack London himself as a teenager.

===Rural Quest===
When Billy is released from jail, Saxon insists that they leave the city and try to find their own farm, though they discover that the government no longer gives out land freely. They pass through an area dominated by the Portuguese, who are described to have arrived very poor and prospered by using the land more intensively than earlier European settlers, whom they displaced. A few days of their journey are spent with a middle-class woman who grows flowers and vegetables and has a flourishing business selling high-quality products to the wealthy.

Moving on, they take a liking to an artists&#x27; colony but decide to continue looking for their own place. Billy begins dealing in horses as well as driving them. He returns to the boxing ring, using a new name so he will not be identified against an up-and-coming boxer, and wins the fight within seconds. He uses his reward of 300 dollars to buy a pair of horses and, after a victory in a rematch, resolves to fight no more.

They also encounter well-known writer and journalist &#x27;Jack Hastings&#x27;, generally considered to be a self-portrait of Jack London at the time of the book&#x27;s conception. Hastings&#x27; wife—presumably modeled after London&#x27;s second wife—is described as bearing some resemblance to Saxon. They discuss the wastefulness of the early American farmers, namely their habits of exhausting land and moving on, reflecting Jack London&#x27;s views on sustainable agriculture.

Directed to their &#x27;Valley of the Moon&#x27;, Billy and Saxon settle and live there happily at the book&#x27;s end. &#x27;Sonoma Valley&#x27; is considered by a character to be a Native American name meaning &#x27;Valley of the Moon&#x27;, though this etymology is disputed.

==Influences==
Though not one of London&#x27;s most popular books, &quot;The Valley of the Moon&quot; remains in print and can also be downloaded. It has been described as &quot;road novel fifty years before Kerouac&quot; and as reflecting London&#x27;s loss of hope in socialism and growing interest in scientific farming, as well as a hymn of praise to his second wife Charmian.

A film was made in 1914. Billy was played by actor / director Jack Conway and Saxon by Myrtle Stedman.

The novel is referenced in Malcolm Lowry&#x27;s Under the Volcano, by the protagonist Geoffrey Firmin (the Consul).

The novel is referenced in Joan Didion&#x27;s memoir &quot;Where I Was From&quot;

<text>The Little Lady of the Big House (1915) is a novel by American writer Jack London. It was his last novel to be published during his lifetime. 

==Plot==
The story concerns a love triangle. The protagonist, Dick Forrest, is a rancher with a poetic streak (his &quot;acorn song&quot; recalls London&#x27;s play, &quot;The Acorn Planters&quot;). His wife, Paula, is a vivacious, athletic, and sexually self-aware woman, who falls in love with Evan Graham, an old friend of her husband. Unable to choose between the two men, she wounds herself mortally with a rifle in what her husband is certain is a suicide.

== Inspiration ==
Biographer Clarice Stasz writes that the book is &quot;not autobiography&quot;, but speaks of London&#x27;s &quot;frank borrowing from his life with Charmian&quot;, his second wife, and says it is &quot;psychologically valid as a mirror of events during [the] winter [of 1912–13]&quot;. Paula, like Charmian, is subject to insomnia and is unable to bear children. Based on a reading of Charmian&#x27;s diary, Stasz identifies Evan Graham with two real-life men named Laurie Smith and Allan Dunn.

Even minor characters can be identified; Forrest&#x27;s servant Oh My resembles London&#x27;s valet Nakata. The long-bearded hobo philosopher Aaron Hancock resembles Frank Strawn-Hamilton, who was a long-term guest at the London ranch. Sculptor Haakan Frolich makes an appearance as &quot;the sculptor Froelig&quot;, and painter Xavier Martinez appears under his own name.

==Criticism==
London said of this novel: &quot;It is all sex from start to finish—in which no sexual adventure is actually achieved or comes within a million miles of being achieved, and in which, nevertheless, is all the guts of sex, coupled with strength.&quot; One reviewer disparaged the novel&#x27;s &quot;erotomania.&quot; 

Clarice Stasz further comments:
: &quot;Little Lady&quot; upset readers in London&#x27;s day for its gushing sexual imagery... [and] its close portrayal of the tempting pull of adultery. Modern critics, on the other hand, deride its Victorian coyness and sentimentality, its unrealistic characters. Both were correct—it was too sexy for readers in 1915, when it appeared, and not sexy enough for readers beyond the sexually free twenties.

Kevin Starr, in a negative assessment, describes the novel as &quot;wish-fulfilment&quot;. He says it
: provides a sort of last will and testament to California possibilities. His ranch life had begun in earnest in 1909 as a moratorium against chaos. Its last literary expression stank of madness and decay. Art and ranching converged in London&#x27;s last effort, neither sustaining the other.

<text>The Star Rover is a novel by American writer Jack London published in 1915 (published in the United Kingdom as The Jacket). It is science fiction, and involves both mysticism and reincarnation.

==Plot summary==
A framing story is told in the first person by Darrell Standing, a university professor serving life imprisonment in San Quentin State Prison for murder. Prison officials try to break his spirit by means of a torture device called &quot;the jacket,&quot; a canvas jacket which can be tightly laced so as to compress the whole body, inducing angina. Standing discovers how to withstand the torture by entering a kind of trance state, in which he walks among the stars and experiences portions of past lives.

: I trod interstellar space, exalted by the knowledge that I was bound on vast adventure, where, at the end, I would find all the cosmic formulae and have made clear to me the ultimate secret of the universe. In my hand I carried a long glass wand. It was borne in upon me that with the tip of this wand I must touch each star in passing. And I knew, in all absoluteness, that did I but miss one star I should be precipitated into some unplummeted abyss of unthinkable and eternal punishment and guilt.

==Background==
The accounts of these past lives form the body of the work. They are a series of powerfully written, but disconnected and unresolved, vignettes set in different ages and cultures. According to Kevin Starr, London planned a historical novel about the American West and used some of this material in &quot;The Star Rover.&quot;

The jacket was actually used at San Quentin at the time; Jack London&#x27;s descriptions of it were based on interviews with a former convict named Ed Morrell, which London used as a name for a character in the novel. For his role in the Sontag and Evans gang which robbed the Southern Pacific Railroad in the 1890s, Morrell spent fourteen years in California prisons (1894–1908), five of them in solitary confinement. London championed his pardon. After his release, Morrell was a frequent guest at London&#x27;s Beauty Ranch.

==Legacy==

A silent film based on &quot;The Star Rover&quot; was released in 1920, starring Courtenay Foote, a well-known stage and screen actor of the time, as Dr. Hugh Standing.

The 2005 movie &quot;The Jacket&quot; has a story credited to Marc Rocco and Tom Bleecker. Jack London is not mentioned. However, the director has said that the film is &quot;loosely based on a true story that became a Jack London story.&quot;

H. P. Lovecraft owned a copy of &quot;The Star Rover&quot;, and Edward Guimont has proposed that it was an influence on his and E. Hoffmann Price&#x27;s 1933 story &quot;Through the Gates of the Silver Key&quot;.

Figures heavily in Andrew Mayne&#x27;s 2025 novel Mr. Whisper.

<doc id="423616" wikidata="Q3876829" url="?curid=423616" title="Nihil">
<text>Nihil is the seventh studio album by German industrial band KMFDM, released on April 4, 1995, by Wax Trax! Records. The album marked the return of former band member Raymond Watts and the first appearance of session drummer Bill Rieflin, and was mostly written by frontman Sascha Konietzko.

The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Juke Joint Jezebel&quot; is the band&#x27;s most widely known song, with millions of copies sold over various releases. Widely praised by critics, &quot;Nihil&quot; is the band&#x27;s best-selling album. After the original release went out of print, a remastered version was released in 2007.

==Background==
In late 1993, Sascha Konietzko and fellow multi-instrumentalist En Esch both left Chicago, moving to Seattle and New Orleans, respectively. Lead guitarist Günter Schulz left the country, moving to Kelowna, British Columbia. In early 1994, Konietzko started working on new material, and Schulz came to Seattle to begin adding guitars to the tracks. Later that year, the group assembled in Los Angeles to rehearse for the upcoming Angstfest tour in support of &quot;Angst&quot;, which spanned April and May. Konietzko, Schulz, Esch, and guitarist Mark Durante were joined by another guitarist, Mike Jensen, for a live show that featured up to four guitarists playing at once. Konietzko and Schulz, along with Dutch singer Dorona Alberti, returned to Seattle to begin recording vocals for &quot;Nihil&quot;. Konietzko later said he was not happy with the sessions, explaining that nothing was coming together, and only two songs from the upcoming album, &quot;Trust&quot; and &quot;Brute&quot;, had been completed to his satisfaction.

Former KMFDM member Raymond Watts, last seen contributing vocals, programming, and production to 1988&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Blow Your Top&quot; before starting his own band, Pig, called Konietzko and asked if he would be interested in working on a small musical collaboration. Konietzko agreed, and Watts flew to Seattle, where the pair, along with Schulz, worked on an EP entitled &quot;Sin Sex &amp; Salvation&quot;. Konietzko said of the trio&#x27;s working together, &quot;It was the breath of fresh air I had been hoping and waiting for. This short project took my mind off the problems with the KMFDM album and gave me a welcome change of perspective.&quot; Watts then stayed on with the group to begin work on &quot;Nihil&quot;, which featured a core group of Konietzko, Schulz, Watts, and Esch, along with some input from steel guitar specialist Durante and drummer Bill Rieflin.

==Production==
Discussing the change in songwriting from &quot;Angst&quot;, Konietzko said: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with the band scenario on that album, where everybody had input. It allowed for too many compromises. &quot;Angst&quot; seems not organic to me.&quot; In another interview, he explained: &quot;Contrary to the past, I wrote all the songs for &quot;Nihil&quot;,&quot; adding that doing things that way caused &quot;minimal problems&quot;.

Konietzko stated that the band overused guitars on their previous album, &quot;Angst&quot;, saying it sounded &quot;like guitarists jacking off&quot;. On &quot;Nihil&quot;, the guitars were mixed in last. Durante had recently purchased a triple-neck Fender steel guitar in Houston, and used it during recording sessions, but added a significant amount of distortion to it, making it sound like a &quot;regular&quot; guitar but giving it what he called a &quot;sliding&quot; sound. Konietzko also brought in a trio of horn players to perform on &quot;Disobedience&quot;, saying he had always wanted a horn section in a KMFDM song, but that he had never been able to afford it before.

Konietzko originally wrote thirty songs over a period of eight or nine months for &quot;Nihil&quot; before settling on ten final tracks. Watts came into the studio after the songs were mostly complete and added lyrics to a handful of songs, which he said was &quot;actually quite liberating&quot; in contrast to writing his own music from scratch. Konietzko described the album as being entirely foreplay, without any resolution, and said it was the band&#x27;s best album to date, a statement he believed he would be standing by for years. He also said its poppier sound was more his style. Konietzko produced the album with sound engineer Chris Shepard, who had also engineered the band&#x27;s previous album.

==Release==

&quot;Nihil&quot; was originally released on April 4, 1995. A digitally remastered re-release of &quot;Nihil&quot; was released on March 6, 2007, along with a similar re-release of KMFDM&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Xtort&quot;. The band toured twice in 1995 in support of the album, first doing the Beat by Beat tour shortly after the album&#x27;s release, and then the In Your Face tour later in the year. The album, which had &quot;major buzz&quot;, had an initial shipment of 75,000 copies.

The album&#x27;s first track, &quot;Ultra&quot;, was featured in the U.S. release of &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, and was the theme song for Manga Entertainment&#x27;s anime catalog trailer. &quot;Juke Joint Jezebel&quot;, the band&#x27;s biggest hit, was featured in the film &quot;Bad Boys&quot; and in an episode of &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;. &quot;Juke Joint Jezebel (Metropolis Mix)&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. The video for &quot;Juke Joint Jezebel&quot; includes footage from the &quot;Patlabor 1&quot; anime. More than two million copies of the song sold in 1995 alone.

&quot;Nihil&quot; was Wax Trax!&#x27;s best-selling album to date by the end of 1995, and went on to sell over 120,000 copies by August 1996. &quot;Nihil&quot; reached No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart, and was later labelled one of Wax Trax!&#x27;s commercial high points. By 2016, the album had sold a total of 209,000 copies, making it the band&#x27;s top-selling album of all time, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

&quot;Nihil&quot; is one of only two KMFDM studio albums (&quot;Opium&quot; being the other) that does not feature cover artwork by pop-artist Brute! Instead, the cover was designed by Rieflin&#x27;s wife Francesca Sundsten. The band would return to using Brute!&#x27;s work on the next album, &quot;Xtort&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Nihil&quot; received very favorable reviews from music critics. Heidi MacDonald of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; called &quot;Nihil&quot; &quot;a superb album that takes no prisoners from beginning to end,&quot; saying that the first three tracks are &quot;nearly flawless&quot; and calling &quot;Disobedience&quot; a &quot;real standout.&quot; Andy Hinds of AllMusic also praised the album, calling &quot;Juke-Joint Jezebel&quot; &quot;an enduring and indispensable dancefloor favorite at goth/industrial clubs around the world.&quot; He further said that the production on &quot;Nihil&quot; was &quot;state of the art&quot; and that KMFDM&#x27;s sound was &quot;quite polished and tight.&quot; Mark Jenkins of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said the album &quot;manages to stay fresh through the use of assorted sonic spices,&quot; adding that the album has &quot;some canny accents.&quot;

&quot;Keyboard&quot; praised the album, describing &quot;milky organ pads&quot; on &quot;Disobedience&quot; and &quot;snarling guitars [wrapped] in spiky synth barbed wire&quot; on &quot;Juke Joint Jezebel&quot;, and saying of band leader Konietzko, &quot;You won&#x27;t find a more imaginative or effective keyboardist on the hard-core scene.&quot; Chris Gill of &quot;Guitar Player&quot;, conversely, said &quot;the most interesting parts are Durante&#x27;s steel guitar lines, which howl like revving engines&quot;. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that &quot;Juke Joint Jezebel&quot; &quot;swaggers like a Bourbon Street hooker, with crunching guitars and a swooping, gospelish chorus&quot; at the time of the album&#x27;s release, and in 2011, said the album put &quot;a polished pop spin on industrial&#x27;s characteristic harshness&quot;. Gill had similar praise, saying &quot;few have succeeded in making the combination [of techno rhythms and thrash guitars] sound as natural as this&quot;.

The district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Nuremberg, Hersbruck and Lauf, reuniting for the first time since 1789 most of the former lands of the Imperial City of Nuremberg.

==Geography==

The district includes the eastern metropolitan area of Nuremberg in the west and the hills of the Frankish Alb in the east. The Pegnitz River runs through the district, coming from the northeast and leaving to the west towards Nuremberg.

==Coat of arms==
The upper part of the coat of arms is identical to the city arms of Nuremberg. In the bottom part there is a water wheel representing the watermills on the river Pegnitz.

<text>The Moche civilization (; alternatively, the Moche culture or the Early, Pre- or Proto-Chimú) flourished in northern Peru with its capital near present-day Moche, Trujillo, Peru from about 100 to 800 AD during the Regional Development Epoch. While this issue is the subject of some debate, many scholars contend that the Moche were not politically organized as a monolithic empire or state. Rather, they were likely a group of autonomous polities that shared a common culture, as seen in the rich iconography and monumental architecture that survives today.

== Background ==
Moche society was agriculturally based, with a significant level of investment in the construction of a sophisticated network of irrigation canals for the diversion of river water to supply their crops. Their artifacts express their lives, with detailed scenes of hunting, fishing, fighting, sacrifice, sexual encounters, and elaborate ceremonies. The Moche are particularly noted for their elaborately painted ceramics, gold work, monumental constructions (&quot;huacas&quot;), and irrigation systems.

Moche history may be broadly divided into three periods: the emergence of the Moche culture in Early Moche (100–300 AD), the expansion and flourishing during Middle Moche (300–600 AD), and the urban nucleation and subsequent collapse in Late Moche (500–800 AD).

The Salinar culture reigned on the north coast of Peru from 200 BC–200 AD. According to some scholars, this was a short transition period between the Cupisnique and the Moche cultures.

There are considerable parallels between Moche and Cupisnique iconography and ceramic designs, including the iconography of the &quot;Spider god&quot;.

===Moche cultural sphere===
The Moche cultural sphere is centered on several valleys on the north coast of Peru in regions La Libertad, Lambayeque, Jequetepeque, Chicama, Moche, Virú, Chao, Santa, and Nepena. It occupied 250 miles of desert coastline and up to 50 miles inland.

The &quot;Huaca del Sol&quot;, a pyramidal adobe structure on the Rio Moche, was the largest pre-Columbian structure in Peru. It was partly destroyed when Spanish Conquistadors looted its graves for gold in the 16th century. The nearby &quot;Huaca de la Luna&quot; is better preserved, with many of its interior walls still filled with many colorful murals and complex iconography. The site has been under professional archaeological excavation since the early 1990s.

Other major Moche sites include Sipán, Loma Negra, Dos Cabezas, Pacatnamu, the El Brujo complex, Mocollope, Cerro Mayal, Galindo, Huanchaco, and Pañamarka.

Their adobe huacas have been mostly destroyed by looters and natural forces over the last 1,300 years. The surviving ones show that the coloring of their murals was quite vibrant.

==Southern and Northern Moche==

Two distinct regions of the Moche civilization have been identified, Southern and Northern Moche, with each area probably corresponding to a different political entity.

The Southern Moche region, believed to be the heartland of the culture, originally comprised the Chicama and Moche valleys, and was first described by Rafael Larco Hoyle. The Huaca del Sol-Huaca de la Luna site was probably the capital of this region.

The Northern Moche region includes three valley systems:

*The upper Piura Valley, around the Vicús culture region
*The lower Lambayeque Valley system, consisting of three rivers: La Leche, Reque and Zaña
*The lower Jequetepeque Valley system

The Piura was fully part of the Moche phenomenon only for a short time—during its Early Moche, or Early Moche-Vicús phase—and then developed independently.

It appears that there was a lot of independent development among these various Moche centers (except in the eastern regions). They all likely had ruling dynasties of their own, related to each other. Centralized control of the whole Moche area may have taken place from time to time, but appears infrequent.

Pampa Grande, in the Lambayeque Valley, on the shore of the Chancay River, became one of the largest Moche sites anywhere, and occupied an area of more than 400 hectares. It was prominent in the Moche V period (600–700 AD), and features an abundance of Moche V ceramics.

The site was laid out and built in a short period of time and has an enormous ceremonial complex. It includes &quot;Huaca Fortaleza&quot;, which is the tallest ceremonial platform in Peru.

San Jose de Moro is another northern site in the Jequetepeque valley. It was prominent in the Middle and Late Moche Periods (400–850 AD). Numerous Moche tombs have been excavated here, including several burials containing high status female individuals. These women were depicted in Moche iconography as &quot;the Priestess&quot;.

===Differences between the Northern Mochicas and the Southern Mochicas ===
The best known differences are:

==Material culture==

===Ceramics===
Moche pottery is some of the most varied in the world. The use of mold technology is evident, which would have enabled the mass production of certain forms. But Moche ceramics vary widely in shape and theme, with most important social activities documented in pottery, including war, agriculture, metalwork, weaving, and erotica.

Traditional north coast Peruvian ceramic art uses a limited palette, relying primarily on red and white colors, fineline painting, fully modeled clay, veristic figures, and stirrup spouts. Moche ceramics created between 150 and 800 AD epitomize this style. Moche pots have been found not just at major north coast archaeological sites, such as Huaca de la luna, Huaca del sol, and Sipán, but also at small villages and unrecorded burial sites as well.

At least 500 Moche ceramics have sexual themes. The most frequently depicted act is anal sex, with scenes of vaginal penetration being very rare. Most pairs are heterosexual, with carefully carved genitalia to show that the anus, rather than the vagina, is being penetrated. Often an infant is depicted breastfeeding while the couple has sex. Fellatio is sometimes represented, but cunnilingus is absent. Some depict male skeletons masturbating, or being masturbated by living women.
Because irrigation was the source of wealth and foundation of the empire, the Moche culture emphasized the importance of circulation and flow. Expanding upon this, Moche artwork frequently depicted the passage of fluids, particularly life fluids through vulnerable human orifices. There are countless images of defeated warriors losing life fluids through their nose, or helpless victims getting their eyes torn out by birds or captors. Images of captive sex-slaves with gaping orifices and leaking fluids portray extreme exposure, humiliation, and a loss of power.

The coloration of Moche pottery is often simple, with yellowish cream and rich red used almost exclusively on elite pieces. White and black are rarely used. The Moche are known for their portraiture pottery. The pottery portraits created by the Moche appear to represent actual individuals. Many of the portraits are of individuals with physical disfigurements or genetic defects.

The realistic detail in Moche ceramics may have helped them serve as didactic models. Older generations could pass down general knowledge about reciprocity and embodiment to younger generations through such portrayals. The sex pots could teach about procreation, sexual pleasure, cultural and social norms, a sort of immortality, the transfer of life and souls, transformation, and the relationship between the two cyclical views of nature and life.

===Textiles===
Extreme weather and fragility of garments mean that relatively few examples of Moche textiles exist. However, limited quantities have been found in tombs, especially of higher-status members of society. Many of the remaining garments are incomplete articles, partially broken down. Nevertheless, scholars have been able to gain cultural insights from the remaining Moche textiles. The Moche wove textiles, mostly using cotton and wool from vicuña and alpaca. The relative presence of these fabrics, as well as which patterns were used, varies chronologically throughout Moche culture. Too few relics exist from early Moche culture to draw conclusive findings. Textiles from around 450 AD uniquely include a male head cloth—which is not readily found elsewhere. Twill and gauze weaving is also common among samples from this period, though by the 500-800 AD range, these patterns become much less abundant. It is thought that elite members of Moche society had specialized artisans who manufactured their textiles, whereas lower-ranking typical members of society would manufacture their own clothing. Whorls and needles have proven quite common in excavation of Moche dwellings—pointing to a household level of production. However, more monochrome, homogenized relics suggest mass-production may have become more common by 500-800 AD. Variation in garments likely correlates with different social classes. Sophisticated weaving techniques and bright dyes are more common on elites&#x27; clothing, whereas commoners may have had garments that were less sophisticated and lacked dye—and they likely had fewer of them. Complex tapestries developed by artisans are another good associated with high social hierarchy. Several specific items also correlate to gender in Moche culture, such as a head cloth for men and a long tunic for women. Foreigners to the Moche Culture were commonly portrayed wearing Moche clothing that contained details pertaining to both genders or items that were not specific to either. Descendants of Moche people today continue to have strong weaving traditions.

===Metalwork===
The Moche discovered both electrochemical replacement plating and depletion gilding, which they used to cover copper crafts found at Loma Negra in thin layers of gold or silver. Modern attempts were able to recreate a similar chemical plating process using boiling water and salts found naturally in the area.
It is the Moche ceramic tradition that had previously been given the most attention in Archaeology, though this is beginning to change as archaeologists continue to discover ties between iconography on ceramic and other parts of Moche art. Just as important to Moche craftsmanship and culture is metallurgy. The skill required to create these objects is perhaps some of the finest the world has ever known.

The first Moche metalworks entered into the archaeological record were unearthed by Max Uhle at Huaca del Sol and Huaca de Luna during 1899 and 1900, but were largely ignored while Uhle focused on other aspects of the sites. Moche metal work gained attention after Peruvian researcher Rafael Larco Hoyle published &quot;Los Mochicas&quot; in 1945. Here, he mostly focused on describing the large flared headdresses and brilliantly decorated nose ornaments often found in connection with the Moche elite. Despite having no formal training in archaeology, Larco Hoyle was the first to truly attempt a systematic reconstruction of the Moche by drawing on information from excavations, art, iconography, Spanish documents, and modern traditions. The discovery of bronze and gold artifacts buried in the Warrior Priest tomb at the Huaca de la Cruz site one year later also encouraged further study. The same would happen when burial grounds at the site now known as Loma Negra in the Piura Valley were unearthed by looters finding a wealth of gold, silver, and copper objects along with ceramic vessels. 
An important discovery in the context of Moche metallurgy was the discovery of the Tombs of Sipán in 1986. These burials included a wealth of metal objects unparalleled with any previous discovery. Most of these objects remained in their original context, allowing researchers to prove beyond reasonable doubt that metal objects were closely intertwined with the power of the Moche elite. The rulers of the Moche were incredibly adept at portraying and perpetuating their power through art, which is well-exemplified by the Moche metallurgy.

Moche techniques in metalworking have proved to be an intriguing area of research. Their techniques were likely some of the most advanced in the world during the time of the Moche; restoration has proven difficult to many present-day metalworkers. 
Craftspeople perfected a wide variety of metalworking techniques. When they invaded in the sixteenth century, Spanish conquistadors took note of the highly skilled metalwork the Inca were able to produce. Unlike European metalworkers, the Inca blew through long tubes to heat coals, rather than using bellows to create a forced draft of air. It is probable that the Moche used a similar method. In fact, archaeologists are aware of several bowls from the Moche culture that depict this process. Many of the Moche metalworking techniques were invented or at least perfected by the Moche themselves, but they owe the invention of some of their most-used techniques at least in part to the influences of the Chavín culture that preceded them. Like the artists of Chavín, they mostly used alloys that contained some combination of gold, silver, or copper that they had developed. While Moche art as a whole is very much independent of the Chavín style, many recurring motifs found across Moche art, including the metalwork, also seem to have their roots in Chavín culture. Moche art continues the tradition of anthropomorphic figures as well as characters with prominent fangs, although the fangs are usually less pronounced than Chavín art and not present quite as often. That is not to say that the Moche did not leave their own mark on the Anden society. Many of the techniques developed by the Moche, especially their electroplating and gilding techniques used to make copper alloys appear to be almost internally gold or silver, would continue to be used up until the Inca conquest hundreds of years after the Moche&#x27;s collapse.

Several examples of the molds used to shape the low relief sculptures have been discovered, most are made of a solid metal alloy but wood molds were also used. Researchers Christopher B. Donnan and David A. Scott proved how delicate this process of shaping is when they used a cast of one of the copper alloy molds to recreate the process. They found one of the most important parts of the process is the thickness of the sheet metal. Too thick and it will fail to capture the details of the mold and prove too difficult to shape, but too thin and the metal would winkle and tear. They found 0.4mm to be the ideal thickness although the repeated hammering thinned the sheet down to 0.25mm, in addition to hammering repeated annealing was also required. Analysis of the items found at the tombs of Sipan has found that the Moche were able to maintain an almost completely uniform thickness between 1 and about 0.1 millimeters depending on the object.

When this was completed several other techniques could be used to finish the piece. Oftentimes other pieces were attached, sometimes with the intention of being moving parts of the work. More often than not this was done by crimping the metal or the use of interlocking tabs and slits in the two parts, but soldering and edged-wielding were also used. Finishing touches could also be added with embossing, punching and chasing along with embedding other precious materials. Stones such as lapis lazuli, turquoise, spondylus shells, and others have all been found embedded in Moche metal works. It is worth noting that several of the materials are not found on the Moche coast. Lapis Lazuli was available only from modern Chile hundreds of miles to the south and Spondulus shells had to be acquired from modern Ecuador to the north. This makes it clear that the Moche must have had extensive trade networks, and likely contact with other cultures. Also notable in this context is the fact that many of the animals accurately depicted in Moche artwork are found only in the tropical Amazon.

===Agricultural engineering===
Researchers of the Moche culture agree that the emergence of the Moche culture is related to the intensification of the production of corn, cotton, beans and squash, among other agricultural products, which allowed the development of a regional Moche political economy in the Valley of Moche from the north coast of Peru during the Early Intermediate Period (400 BC–600 AD).

The northern region of Peru is one of the most arid areas in the world, where there is no rain throughout the year. That factor, far from discouraging the establishment of communities, was the trigger for the construction of an outstanding culture that developed engineering works that interconnected various river valleys, with the aim of irrigating desert territories.

Many of the Moche agricultural systems are still in operation, such as the Ascope aqueduct, the La Cumbre Canal, in Chicama, or the San Jose dam, which continue to provide water, coming from the Andean region and groundwater, guaranteeing several harvests per year.

Access to new farmland, gained from the desert, was the starting point of a civilization that, based on abundant harvests, became socially stratified. All this allowed certain members of the community to no longer dedicate themselves exclusively to food production, and a process of specialization began that led to the development of the Moche civilization.

==Religion==
Both iconography and the finds of human skeletons in ritual contexts seem to indicate that human sacrifice played a significant part in Moche religious practices. These rites appear to have involved the elite as key actors in a spectacle of costumed participants, monumental settings and possibly the ritual consumption of blood. The tumi was a crescent-shaped metal knife used in sacrifices. While some scholars, such as Christopher B. Donnan and Izumi Shimada, argue that the sacrificial victims were the losers of ritual battles among local elites, others, such as John Verano and Richard Sutter, suggest that the sacrificial victims were warriors captured in territorial battles between the Moche and other nearby societies. Excavations in plazas near Moche huacas have found groups of people sacrificed together and the skeletons of young men deliberately excarnated, perhaps for temple displays.

The Moche may have also held and tortured the victims for several weeks before sacrificing them, with the intent of deliberately drawing blood. Verano believes that some parts of the victim may have been eaten as well in ritual cannibalism. The sacrifices may have been associated with rites of ancestral renewal and agricultural fertility. Moche iconography features a figure which scholars have nicknamed the &quot;Decapitator&quot;; it is frequently depicted as a spider, but sometimes as a winged creature or a sea monster: together all three features symbolize land, water and air. When the body is included, the figure is usually shown with one arm holding a knife and another holding a severed head by the hair; it has also been depicted as &quot;a human figure with a tiger&#x27;s mouth and snarling fangs&quot;. The &quot;Decapitator&quot; is thought to have figured prominently in the beliefs surrounding the practice of sacrifice.

== Social stratification ==
Although it remains somewhat unclear how geographically divided Moche culture was, scholars are very confident that the Moche were a socially divided society. Beyond royalty, the Moche can be divided into a general upper and lower class, and each class can be further stratified into smaller groups. Intra-class movement was possible within these broad categories, but inter-class switches between them were less feasible. Many pre-contact cultures share a divided structure comparable to the Moche—but each may have unique development.

Although religion seems to have been a centripetal force for the Moche, members of the elite class likely used it to reinforce their status. Other ideological, economic, political, and social factors may have also been leveraged to similar ends. A common approach to maintaining power was for members of the elite, such as priests and priestesses, to use ceremonies to reinforce their standing (see the Religion section for more information on ceremonies). It may also be true that physical force was used. The Moche elite may have struggled to retain power at times, and inter-elite quarreling is speculated to have played into the culture&#x27;s collapse.

Excavated Moche burial sites constitute a large body of evidence for social stratification. Those lowest in the Moche hierarchy were buried in a simple hole near their household; platform mounds with an abundance of goods were awarded to the highest-ranking members of society. An incomplete list of possible funerary objects includes copper masks, silver, pottery, and gold goods. Presence of metal-worked goods is thought to be especially significant with respect to high status. Excavation of dwellings indicates that living conditions of Moche likely also differed based on social standing, but excavation data here remains skewed and not entirely complete so far. Excavated elite burials also illustrate that remains sexed both male and female held elite positions in Moche culture.

==Collapse==
There are many theories as to what caused the demise of the Moche political structure. Some scholars have emphasized the role of environmental change. Studies of ice cores drilled from glaciers in the Andes reveal climatic events between 563 and 594 AD, possibly a super El Niño, that resulted in 30 years of intense rain and flooding followed by 30 years of drought, part of the aftermath of the climate changes of 535–536. These weather events could have disrupted the Moche way of life, political hierarchy, and jeopardized their faith in their religion. This super El Niño may have hindered Moche agriculture. Moche agriculture relied considerably on canal-based irrigation from Andes mountain runoff, which a severe drought would have jeopardized. Certain scholars attribute strain on the irrigation systems to sensitive tectonics in the region.

Other evidence demonstrates that these events did not cause a complete Moche demise. Moche polities survived beyond 650 AD in the Jequetepeque Valley and the Moche Valleys. For instance, in the Jequetepeque Valley, later settlements are characterized by fortifications and defensive works. While there is no evidence of a foreign invasion (i.e. a Huari invasion) as many scholars have suggested in the past, the defensive works suggest social unrest, possibly the result of climatic changes, as factions fought for control over increasingly scarce resources.

== Links with other cultures ==
Chronologically, the Moche was an Early Intermediate Period culture, which was preceded by the Chavín horizon, as well as the Cupisnique, and succeeded by the Huari and Chimú. The Moche co-existed with the Ica-Nazca culture in the south. They are thought to have had some limited contact with the Ica-Nazca because they later mined guano for fertilizer and may have traded with northerners. Moche pottery has been found near Ica, but no Ica-Nazca pottery has been found in Moche territory.

The coastal Moche culture also co-existed (or overlapped in time) with the slightly earlier Recuay culture in the highlands. Some Moche iconographic motifs can be traced to Recuay design elements.

The Moche also interacted with the neighbouring Virú culture. Eventually, by 700 CE, they had established control over the Viru.

==Archaeological discoveries==

In 1899 and 1900, Max Uhle was the first archaeologist to excavate a Moche site, Huaca de la Luna, which is where the architectural complex that is known as &quot;Huacas de Moche&quot; (Pyramids of Moche) is located in the Moche Valley. The name of this architectural complex is where the name of the Moche site and culture came from.

Excavations in 1938 and 1939 by Rafael Larco Hoyle saw the development of the first interpretations of Moche culture, ranking the Moche as being &quot;high on the list of advanced societies&quot; as a civilization. He listed traits of the Moche culture such as &quot;exquisite artworks&quot; and the &quot;creation of large scale facilities and public works&quot; as a testament to this ranking.

Arguably the most significant event which shaped Moche archaeological research was the Virú Valley Project, beginning in 1946 and led by Willian Duncan Strong and Wendell Bennett. Their stratigraphic excavations in Virú showed an earlier ceramic style known as Gallinazo, which appeared to have “abruptly ended”. 

In 1987, archaeologists, alerted by the local police, discovered the first intact Moche tomb at Sipán in northern Peru. Inside the tomb, which was carbon dated to about 300 AD, the archaeologists found the mummified remains of a high ranking male, the Lord of Sipán. Also in the tomb were the remains of six other individuals, several animals, and a large variety of ornamental and functional items, many of which were made of gold, silver, and other valuable materials. Continuing excavations of the site have yielded thirteen additional tombs.

In 2005, a mummified Moche woman known as the Lady of Cao was discovered at the Huaca Cao Viejo, part of the El Brujo archaeological site on the outskirts of present-day Trujillo, Peru. It is the best preserved Moche mummy found to date; the elaborate tomb that housed her had unprecedented decoration. Archaeologists believe that the tomb had been undisturbed since approximately 450 AD. The tomb contained military and ornamental artifacts, including war clubs and spear throwers. The remains of a garroted teenage girl, probably a servant, were also found in the tomb. News of the discovery was announced by Peruvian and U.S. archaeologists in collaboration with &quot;National Geographic&quot; in May 2006.

In 2005 an elaborate gold mask thought to depict a sea god, with curving rays radiating from a stone-inlaid feline face, was recovered in London by the Metropolitan Police. Experts believe that the artifact had been looted in the late 1980s from an elite tomb at the Moche site of La Mina. It was returned to Peru in 2006.

In 2013 archaeologists unearthed the eighth of a series of finds of female skeleton that started with the Lady of Cao, together taken as evidence that the Moche were ruled by a succession of priestesses-queens. According to project director Luis Jaime Castillo, &quot;[the] find makes it clear that women didn&#x27;t just run rituals in this area but governed here and were queens of Moche society&quot;. This discovery was made at the large archaeological site of San José de Moro, located close to the town of Chepen, in the Sechura Desert of the Jequetepeque Valley, in La Libertad Region, Peru.

<text>The Four Aces are an American male traditional pop quartet popular since the 1950s. Over the last half-century, the group amassed many gold records. Its million-selling songs include &quot;Love is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot;, &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot;, &quot;Stranger in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, and &quot;(It&#x27;s No) Sin&quot;. Other big sellers included &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, &quot;Perfidia&quot;, &quot;Sincerely&quot;, and &quot;Written On The Wind&quot;. “Love Is A Many Splendored Thing” won the Academy Award for Best Song in 1955. The original members, responsible for every song made popular by the group, included Al Alberts, Dave Mahoney, Lou Silvestri, and Rosario &quot;Sod&quot; Vaccaro.

==Career==
Alberts went to South Philadelphia High School and Temple University and served in the United States Navy, where he met Mahoney. Originally, Alberts sang with Mahoney playing behind him, and later they added Vaccaro on trumpet and Silvestri on drums. They played locally in the Philadelphia area, and Alberts started his own record label, Victoria Records, when they could not find a distributor to release their first record, &quot;(It&#x27;s No) Sin&quot;. It sold a million copies, and Decca Records soon signed the group, billing them as The Four Aces featuring Al Alberts.

Alberts left the group in 1958 to try to make it as a soloist but never made the charts. He was replaced as lead singer by Fred Diodati, who had attended South Philadelphia High School a few years after Alberts. After Alberts had left the group, Mahoney and Vaccaro also left. Silvestri never left the group but led three new members: Diodati, Tony Alesi, and Joe Giglio. The Original Aces later asked Silvestri to rejoin the original group, and he did.

It was then that Diodati led a new line-up, which consisted of Diodati, Alesi, Giglio, and Harry Heisler. After almost 19 years with the group, Alesi developed a medical condition that forced him to leave the group. the Four Aces members were Diodati, Giglio, Heisler, and Danny Colingo. By 2019 Heisler had been replaced by Bob Barboni. 

In 1975, Diodati, Alesi, Giglio, and Heisler were awarded the right to the name in a court suit in which the original members tried to re-establish their right. The court allowed the founding members to tour as &quot;The Original Four Aces, Featuring Al Alberts&quot;, which they did, finally retiring the act in 1987. Diodati, Giglio, Barboni, and Colingo continue to legally use the name of the Four Aces and perform the songs made popular by the Original Four Aces.

The founding lead singer, Alberts, died of natural causes on November 27, 2009, at age 87. Mahoney died on July 12, 2012, of complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at age 86. Silvestri died on January 27, 2013, at age 86. Vaccaro (born in 1922) died on April 5, 2013, at age 90.

==Singles==

* &quot;Stranger in Paradise&quot; charted in 1955 in the UK

==Awards and recognition==
The Four Aces were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001.
The Four Aces were inducted into the Philadelphia Music Alliance Walk of Fame in 1988.

==Other uses==
In the 1930s a vocal group recorded under the name The Four Aces (A Human Orchestra). They vocalized not only the lyrics but all instrumental parts of their music, recording on the Decca label in the UK.

In 1948–49, Bill Haley fronted a group called the Four Aces of Western Swing – often referred to as simply The Four Aces. The style of music this group played was country and western, and it was with the group that Haley recorded his first singles for the Cowboy Records label in 1948. The group disbanded in 1949, and Haley went on to form The Saddlemen, which later became Bill Haley &amp; His Comets.

<text>Paperboard is a thick paper-based material. While there is no rigid differentiation between paper and paperboard, paperboard is generally thicker (usually over 0.30 mm, 0.012 in, or 12 points) than paper and has certain superior attributes such as foldability and rigidity. According to ISO standards, paperboard is a paper with a grammage above 250 g/m2, but there are exceptions. Paperboard can be single- or multi-ply.

Paperboard can be easily cut and formed, is lightweight, and because it is strong, is used in packaging. Another end-use is high quality graphic printing, such as book and magazine covers or postcards. Paperboard is also used in fine arts for creating sculptures.

Sometimes it is referred to as &quot;cardboard&quot;, which is a generic, lay term used to refer to any heavy paper pulp–based board, however this usage is deprecated in the paper, printing, and packaging industries as it does not adequately describe each product type.

==History==
In 1817, the first paperboard carton was produced in England. Folding cartons first emerged around the 1860s and were shipped flat to save space, ready to be set up by customers when they were required. The mechanical die cutting and creasing of blanks was developed in 1879. In 1911 the first kraft sulphate mill was built in Florida. In 1915 the gable top milk carton was patented and in 1935 the first dairy plant was observed using them. Ovenable paperboard was introduced in 1974.

==Terminology and classification==

Terminology and classifications of paperboard are not always uniform. Differences occur depending on specific industry, locale, and personal choice. In general, the following are often used:
* Boxboard or cartonboard: paperboard for folding cartons and rigid set-up boxes
** Folding boxboard (FBB): a bending grade capable of being scored and bending without fracture
** Chipboard: a recycled, low quality board
*** White lined chipboard (WLC): a white, often clay-coated chipboard
** Kraft board: a strong virgin fiber board often used for beverage carriers. Often clay-coated for printing
** Laminated board: a lamination of paperboards and other materials, for example liquid packaging board
** Solid bleached board (SBB) or solid bleached sulphate (SBS): clean white board used for foods etc. Sulphate refers to the kraft process
** Solid unbleached board (SUB): board made from unbleached chemical pulp
* Containerboard: a type of paperboard manufactured for the production of corrugated fiberboard
** Corrugated medium: the inner fluted portion of corrugated fiberboard
** Linerboard: a strong stiff board for one or both sides of corrugated boxes. It is the flat covering over the corrugating medium.
* Other
** Binder&#x27;s board: a paperboard used in bookbinding for making hardcovers.

==Production==
Fibrous material is turned into pulp and bleached to create one or more layers of board, which can be optionally coated for a better surface and/or improved appearance. Pulp board is produced on pulping machines that can handle higher grammage and several plies.

===Raw materials===
The above-mentioned fibrous material can either come from fresh (virgin) sources (e.g. wood) or from recycled waste paper. Around 90% of virgin paper is made from wood pulp.
Today paperboard packaging in general, and especially products from certified sustainable sources, are receiving new attention, as manufacturers dealing with environmental, health, and regulatory issues look to renewable resources to meet increasing demand. It is now mandatory in many countries for paper-based packaging to be manufactured wholly or partially from recycled material.
Raw materials include:

* Hardwood: C. in length e.g. Birch which has short fibres. It is generally more difficult to work with; however, it does provide higher tensile strength, but lower tear and other strength properties. Although its fibres are not as long and strong as those in softwood, they make for a stiffer product defined by some stiffness tests. Hardwood fibres fill the sheet better and therefore make a smoother paper that is more opaque and better for printing. Hardwood makes an excellent corrugating medium.
*Softwood: C. in length e.g. Pine and spruce which have typically long fibres and make superior paperboard in services where strength is important. Softwood makes excellent linerboard.
* Recycled: Used paper is collected and sorted and usually mixed with virgin fibres in order to make new material. This is necessary as the recycled fibre often loses strength when reused; the added virgin fibres enhance strength. Mixed waste paper is not usually deinked (skipping the deinking stage) for paperboard manufacture and hence the pulp may contain traces of inks, adhesives, and other residues which together give it a grey colour. Products made of recycled board usually have a less predictable composition and poorer functional properties than virgin fibre-based boards. Health risks have been associated with using recycled material in direct food contact. Swiss studies have shown that recycled material can contain significant portions of mineral oil, which may migrate into packed foods. Mineral oil levels of up to 19.4 mg/kg were found in rice packed in recycled board.

* Others: It is also possible to use the fibres of Sugarcane Bagasse, Straw, Hemp, Cotton, Flax, Kenaf, Abaca and other plant products

===Pulping===

Two principal methods for extracting fibres from their sources are:

* Chemical pulping uses chemical solutions to convert wood into pulp, yielding around 30% less than mechanical pulping; however, pulp made by the kraft process has superior strength
* Thermo mechanical pulp is a two-stage process which results in a very high yield of wood fibres at the expense of strength.

====Bleaching====

Pulp used in the manufacture of paperboard can be bleached to decrease colour and increase purity. Virgin fibre pulp is naturally brown in colour, because of the presence of lignin. Recycled paperboard may contain traces of inks, bonding agents and other residue which colors it grey.
Although bleaching is not necessary for all end-uses, it is vital for many graphical and packaging purposes. There are various methods of bleaching, which are used according to a number of factors for example, the degree of colour change required, chemicals chosen and method of treatment. There are three categories of bleaching methods:

* Bleaching by delignification using chlorine gas, which is a method that has been largely replaced by procedures which are gentler to the environment such as the use of oxygen as a replacement for the chlorine gas. 
* Bleaching by oxidation using chemicals such as chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite.
* Bleaching by reduction using chemicals such as sodium bisulphite.

===Plies===
Multi-ply paperboard generally has higher creasing and folding performance than single-ply as a result of layering different types of pulp into a single product. In cases where the same kind of pulp is being used in several layers, each separate layer is treated and shaped individually in order to create the highest possible quality.

===Coating===
In order to improve whiteness, smoothness and gloss of paperboard, one or more layers of coating is applied. Coated paper is usually made up of:

* a pigment, which could be china clay, calcium carbonate or titanium dioxide, usually a combination of two
* an adhesive or binder as styrene-butadiene emulsions or starches and water.

Additional components could be OBA (optical brightening agents).

==Grades==
The DIN Standard 19303 &quot;Paperboard - Terms and grades&quot; (Publication date : 2005-09) defines different grades of paperboard based on the surface treatment (first letter), the main furnish (second letter) and the colour (non-D grade) or bulk (D grade only) (numbering).

Example: GC1 would be a &quot;pigment coated&quot;, &quot;virgin mechanical pulp&quot; board with a &quot;white reverse side&quot;. Often the used paperboard type would be FBB, which was coated on both sides.

==Common terms==
Basis weight: in the US, it is the weight of of the same paperboard; the traditional British definition is the weight, in pound, of 100 of the same board

Brightness: Brightness is a technical term that is defined as the amount of blue-white light that a paper reflects. This property is very subjective and individual to each buyer and end use, as skin colour and food are better reproduced on &#x27;warm&#x27; (yellow) whites and not blue whites.

Grammage: The grammage of the paperboard is assessed in accordance ISO 536.
Grammage expresses mass per unit area and is measured in g/m2.

PH: Surface pH is measured on a water extract and is on a scale of 0–14. 0 is acidic, 7 is neutral and 14 is alkaline.

Stiffness: Stiffness is one of the most important properties of paperboard as it affects the ability of cartons to run smoothly through the machine that erects, fills and closes them. Stiffness also gives strength and reduces the propensity of a carton to bulge under the weight of settling flowable contents such as cereals.

Although most paper strength properties increase with increasing sheet density, stiffness does not. A rule of thumb is that stiffness is proportional to the 1.6 power of sheet caliper.

The species of fiber used has an effect on stiffness, other things being equal. Northern softwood species impart superior stiffness compared to southern softwoods.

Other factors which affect board stiffness include coatings and moisture content.

Smoothness: Smoothness is particularly important when being used for printing, the smoother the paperboard, the better the image quality, because of better ink coverage. Smoothness is measured using air leak methods – the greater the rate of air leakage, at a specific air pressure, from under a cylindrical knife placed on the surface, the rougher the surface.

Caliper/thickness: In the United States caliper is usually expressed in thousandths of an inch (0.001”) or points, where a sheet of paperboard with a thickness of 0.024” would be 24 points. In Europe it is often sold in g/m2, however the thickness of the board is measured in micron (μm).

Paperboard also tends to be referred to with thickness rather than weight.

Whiteness: It refers ideally to the equal presence of all colours, because a truly white sheet will reflect all wavelengths of visible light equally.

==Paperboard industry==

The paperboard sector is mainly looked at in conjunction with the paper industry. The Paper &amp; Paperboard market size (2007) had a value of US$630.9 billion and a volume of 320.3 million metric tons. Of that market 40.1% is European. About 50% of all produced paper is used for packaging, followed by printing and writing. According to ProCarton, the consumption of paper and paperboard seem to correlate with economic trends (GDP). Sales of carton in Europe sum up to around 8 billion Euros worth. 

Over 1,100 printers produce 5.4 million tonnes of cartonboard yearly. Cartons make up one third of paper and board packaging and 15% of all packaging. A bit more than half (54%) of the European carton is produced using recovered fibre or waste paper.
The paper and paperboard industry is quite energy and capital intensive. Just a coated board machine itself can cost around 90 - 120 million Euros
(about 125 - US$166 million in 11/2011). Economies of scale apply, because of which a few large players often dominate the market place. E.g. in North America the top 5 producers have a market share of 85%.

<text>The Dowd Report is the document describing the transgressions of baseball player and manager Pete Rose in betting on baseball, which precipitated his agreement to a permanent ban from the sport in the United States. The 225-page report was prepared by Special Counsel to the Commissioner John M. Dowd and was submitted to Commissioner Bart Giamatti in May 1989. The report, published in June 1989, was accompanied by seven volumes of exhibits, which included bank and telephone records, alleged betting records, expert reports, and transcripts of interviews with Rose and other witnesses.

Rose was ultimately placed on baseball&#x27;s ineligible list in August 1989. The most controversial conclusion of the report, that Rose had bet on baseball games while managing the Cincinnati Reds, was confirmed 15 years later by Rose himself through his autobiography &quot;My Prison Without Bars&quot;.

Dowd later donated the Dowd Report collections to his alma mater, Emory University School of Law, in 2015.

<doc id="423657" wikidata="Q4155843" url="?curid=423657" title="Double eagle">
<text>A double eagle is a gold coin of the United States with a denomination of $20. (Its gold content of was worth $20 at the 1849 official price of $20.67/ozt.) The coins are 34 mm × 2 mm and are made from a 90% gold (0.900 fine or 21.6 kt) and 10% copper alloy and have a total weight of .

The eagle, half eagle, and quarter eagle were defined by name in the Act of Congress originally authorizing them. Likewise, the double eagle was created by the Coinage Act of 1849. Since the $20 gold piece had twice the value of the eagle, these coins were designated &quot;double eagles&quot;. Before, the most valuable American coin was the $10 gold eagle, first produced in 1795, two years after the United States Mint opened.

The production of the first double eagle coincided with the 1849 California Gold Rush. In that year, the mint produced two pieces in proof.
In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt sought to beautify American coinage, and proposed Augustus Saint-Gaudens as an artist capable of the task. Although the sculptor had poor experiences with the Mint and its chief engraver, Charles E. Barber, Saint-Gaudens accepted Roosevelt&#x27;s call. The work was subject to considerable delays, due to Saint-Gaudens&#x27;s declining health and difficulties because of the high relief of his design. Saint-Gaudens died in 1907, after designing the eagle and double eagle, but before the designs were finalized for production. The new coin became known as the Saint-Gaudens double eagle. Regular production continued until 1933, when the official price of gold was changed to $35/ozt by the Gold Reserve Act.

==Regular issue==
Regular issue double eagles come in two major types and six minor varieties as follows:
* Liberty Head (Coronet) 1849–1907
** Liberty Head, no motto, value &quot;TWENTY D.&quot; 1849–1866
** Liberty Head, with motto, value &quot;TWENTY D.&quot; 1866–1876
** Liberty Head, with motto, value &quot;TWENTY DOLLARS&quot; 1877–1907
* Saint-Gaudens 1907–1933
** Saint-Gaudens, high relief, Roman numerals, no motto 1907
** Saint-Gaudens, low relief, Arabic numerals, no motto 1907–1908
** Saint-Gaudens, low relief, Arabic numerals, with motto 1908–1933

===Liberty Head===
Due to the less desirable artwork and therefore lower demand, Liberty Head (Coronet) $20 gold pieces are less often encountered, and the common subtype commands less than the Saint-Gaudens type. In 1866, the motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; was added to the double eagle, creating a second subtype. In 1877, the coin&#x27;s denomination design on the reverse was changed from &quot;TWENTY D.&quot; to &quot;TWENTY DOLLARS&quot; creating a third and final subtype for the series. An 1879 pattern coin was made for the quintuple Stella using a design combining features of the Liberty Head double eagle and Stella pattern coin and using the same alloy as the Stella (90 parts gold, three parts silver, and seven parts copper); this coin was stolen in July 2008.

===Saint-Gaudens===

The Saint-Gaudens double eagle is named for the designer, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, one of the premier sculptors in American history. Theodore Roosevelt imposed upon him in his last few years to redesign the nation&#x27;s coinage at the beginning of the 20th century. Saint-Gaudens&#x27; work on the high-relief $20 gold piece is considered to be one of the most extraordinary pieces of art on any American coin. The mint eventually insisted on a low-relief version, as the high-relief coin took up to eleven strikes to bring up the details which was harder for the older die presses. This high-relief also caused irregular stacking for banking purposes. Only 12,367 of these coins were struck in 1907. These coins easily top the $10,000 price in circulated grades, but can reach nearly a half million dollars in the best states of preservation.

There were several changes in the early years of this design. The first coins issued in 1907 design featured a date in Roman numerals, but this was changed later that year to the more convenient Arabic numerals. The motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; was omitted from the initial design, as Roosevelt felt that putting the name of God on money that could be used for immoral purposes was inappropriate. By act of Congress, the motto was added in mid-1908.

The design of the Saint-Gaudens coin was slightly changed once more when New Mexico and Arizona became states in 1912, and the number of stars along the rim was accordingly increased from 46 to 48.

Double eagles were routinely minted through 1933, although few of the very last years&#x27; coinages were released before the gold recall legislation of that year. Accordingly, these issues (when the U.S. Treasury permits individuals to own them) bring very high prices.

The Saint-Gaudens obverse design was reused in the American eagle gold bullion coins that were instituted in 1986. The early 1907 double eagles and the 1986–1991 gold American eagles are the only instances of Roman numerals denoting the date on American coinage. The 2009 ultra-high relief American Eagle also used Roman numerals.

On January 22, 2009, the U.S. Mint released ultra-high relief double eagles using the deep design that Saint-Gaudens envisioned, so that the U.S. Mint could, as its web site states &quot;fulfill Augustus Saint-Gaudens&#x27; vision of an ultra high relief coin that could not be realized in 1907 with his legendary Double Eagle liberty design.&quot; Despite that claim, however, the mint actually reaffirmed just what doomed the first attempts in 1907. The coin&#x27;s highly abradable 0.9999 fine gold composition and the multiple strikes required to bring up the design are not practical for business strikes. Because of their higher gold content, and greater striking pressure, the coins are 27 mm wide and 4 mm deep (the same diameter as a gold eagle), rather than the 34 mm × 2 mm that had been established for U.S. $20 gold coins. The initial selling price was $1239. With the rising price of gold by June it had climbed to $1339, and by December to $1489. There was no limit on the coinage of these one time uncirculated issues, which bear the date &quot;MMIX&quot;. In September, the one coin per person ordering restriction was removed. The final mintage was 115,178. These coins were minted at the West Point Mint, but none of them bear the &quot;W&quot; mint mark, making them particularly unusual.

==1933 double eagle==
In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt stopped the coinage of gold and made it illegal to own the metal (although coin collectors could retain their pieces). With one exception, no 1933 double eagles were ever legally released, although some were stolen from the government, and over the years several were recovered.

In the summer of 2002, a 1933 double eagle was auctioned off for US$7,590,020 which shattered the old record of $4,140,000 paid at a public auction for an 1804 silver dollar. This piece is unique as the only 1933 double eagle the U.S. government has deemed legal for its citizens to own (having been negotiated as such through terms of a U.S. treaty with a foreign government). Even illegal instances of the 1933 double eagle could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, but it would be illegal for a U.S. coin dealer to broker a deal with one of these coins. There is no other date of Saint-Gaudens double eagle that is worth a significant fraction of this extraordinary coin. A complete uncirculated set of all other Saint-Gaudens double eagles could be put together for just over three million dollars (less than half the price paid for the 1933), including the extremely rare, ultra-high relief, proof pattern. Without the rare pattern, the set would be less than $750,000.

In August 2005, the United States Mint recovered ten 1933 double eagle coins from a private collector who had contacted the United States Mint to ascertain their authenticity. Joan S. Langbord claimed that she inherited the coins from her father, a suspect in their original theft in 1933, and had found them in a safe deposit box in 2003. The Mint announced that it would consider saving the coins for display. Meanwhile, Langbord filed a federal suit to recover the coins after her hopes of receiving monetary compensation from the federal government were not realized. In September 2009, a federal judge ruled that the government had until the end of the month to return the confiscated coins to the Langbord family, or to prove that they had indeed been stolen. On July 20, 2011, a civil-court jury awarded ownership of the ten coins to the U.S. government on grounds that the coins were stolen from the mint. However, on April 17, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia overturned the jury&#x27;s decision and ruled that the ten 1933 double eagles did indeed belong to Joan S. Langbord and that they must be returned to her family by the U.S. Mint. The appeals court returned the coins to the Langbords because U.S. officials had not responded within a 90-day limit to the family&#x27;s seized-property claim. On August 1, 2016, the full appeals court reversed its earlier ruling and allowed the government to keep the coins.

== Quintuple Stella ==

In response to international monetary conferences held in Europe, the United States Mint struck patterns of various gold coins for use as an international currency in the late 1870s and early 1880s. The double eagle was one such coin, struck with a modified Liberty Head design featuring &quot;★30★G★1.5★S★3.5★C★35★G★R★A★M★S★&quot; on the obverse in 1879, similar to the Stella pattern. Five of the resulting &quot;Quintuple Stella&quot; coins are known to exist in gold, plus about a dozen in copper, some of which have been plated in gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;J1642/P1842&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The period in the &quot;3.5&quot; was omitted in error on the first copper coin struck.

==Known specimens==
The production of the first double eagle coincided with the 1849 California Gold Rush. In that year, the mint produced two pieces in proof. The first now resides in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The second was presented to Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith and was later sold as part of his estate—the present location of this coin remains unknown.

The 1933 double eagle is among the most valuable of U.S. coins, with the sole example currently known to be in private hands–the King Farouk specimen, which was purchased by King Farouk of Egypt in 1944–selling in 2002 for $7,590,020 and resold to an unknown buyer in 2021 for $18.8 million. Twelve other specimens exist, two of which are held in the National Numismatic Collection and the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox.

In July 2023, over 700 gold coins dated from 1840 to 1863, including Double Eagles, were unearthed at a corn field in Kentucky, dubbed the Great Kentucky Hoard. Finder and location remain anonymous.

<doc id="423663" wikidata="Q5433594" url="?curid=423663" title="Fan dance">
<text>In the West, a fan dance (i.e., a dance performed with fans) may be an erotic dance performance, traditionally by a woman, but not exclusively. Beyond eroticism it is a form of musical interpretation. The performer, sometimes entirely nude or apparently so, dances while manipulating two or more large fans that can be constructed from many different materials including ostrich feathers, silks, velvet, sequined and organza fabrics. The unifying factor in all is the spins, or fan staves, that give form to this prop. 

In the 1970s gay men removed the solid pin at the center of the fan and replaced it with knotted string allowing for a fluid curvaceous movement. This disco art has been seen in San Francisco&#x27;s Trocadero (perhaps first before the East&#x27;s Paradise Garage), New York&#x27;s Roseland Ballroom plus numerous circuit parties from Corbett Reynolds 1996 “Jungle Red” Party in Cleveland to the White and Winter Parties of Miami and London&#x27;s 1998 Red Heart&#x27;s Ball. More difficult to construct (and manipulate) than the flags commonly used today, there are but a handful of artists, male and female, who occasionally exhibit this style of dance. The 1997 and 2016 Dance on the Pier images both give a closer look at a pair of medium-sized fans caught in fast motion. At times these fans travel in a simple elliptical pattern seen as a circle by the audience while further into the choreography one might see a perfect windmill, helicopter blades, a set of wings or even Carmen&#x27;s skirt. Hiding the body to evade morality codes does not factor into this reinterpretation on what a fan dance might be, but they do stand as another symbolic protest to the fact that homosexuals were not permitted to dance together in public or private spaces in New York City for decades. To see a tribe of these dancers together is poetry in motion. 

Out of the Darkness, an annual AIDS remembrance event every December 1st hosted by AREA, GMHC and Heritage of Pride, sponsored by the Keith Haring Foundation, has included such a tribe of fan and flag dancers as opening and closing performers for the evenings ceremonies many times noting in their program that these are ritual dances done upon a person&#x27;s death. It is also a dance seen at a child&#x27;s first birthday celebration of life where people remember all the children who did not survive those early months as bodies adjust to living outside the womb. 

In the UK, the fan dance has also been used in the finals of the Miss Nude UK 2000 competition and for The Windmill in Soho where it replaced the tradition of nude tableaux which has since been replaced by table dancing.

In 1998 Thelma Houston had 40 fan and flag dancers accompany her off the gangplank of the Queen of Hearts paddle wheel boat onto the stage at Chelsea Piers for the Dance on Manhattan fundraiser. Gloria Gaynor did similar the year prior with 16 men. Loleatta Holloway danced with just one man at the third of these annuals.

==Movies and TV==
In 1957 in the Perry Mason TV series, the last episode of 1957 was &quot;The Case of the Fan-Dancer&#x27;s Horse&quot;. This is Episode 15 of Season 1. This episode contains two scenes with fan dancing.

In an episode of the Australian TV series &quot;Miss Fisher&#x27;s Murder Mysteries&quot; set in the 1920s the protagonist, private detective Phryne Fisher, goes undercover as a fan dancer in a gentleman&#x27;s club (Series 2, Episode 1 &quot;Murder Most Scandalous&quot;).

The 1963 film &quot;Gypsy&quot; is a musical about Gypsy Rose Lee a noted fan dancer.

The 1983 film &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, has an extended scene featuring an actress playing Sally Rand performing a fan dance. This movie is about the Mercury Seven, the military pilots who were selected to be the astronauts for Project Mercury, the first human spaceflight by the United States.

In the 1989 film Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, in order to distract the guards Uhura performs a fan dance.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Bart After Dark&quot; has belly dancer/showgirl Shauna &quot;Princess Kashmir&quot; Tipton doing a fan dance at Maison Derriere.

<doc id="423666" wikidata="Q503069" url="?curid=423666" title="David of Trebizond">
<text>David Megas Komnenos (; – 1 November 1463) was the last Emperor of Trebizond from 1460 to 1461. He was the third son of Emperor Alexios IV of Trebizond and Theodora Kantakouzene. Following the fall of Trebizond to the Ottoman Empire, he was taken captive with his family to the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, where he and his sons and nephew were executed in 1463.

In July 2013, David and his sons and nephew were canonized by the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Their feast day was determined as 1 November, the anniversary of their deaths.

== Ruler of the Trebizond Empire ==
David had played an important role throughout the reign of his older brother and predecessor John IV. He had been given the courtly title of &quot;despotes&quot;, which in Trebizond designated the heir to the throne. David had participated in his brother&#x27;s expeditions against the Genoese, and also fulfilled various diplomatic tasks. In 1458 he ratified his brother&#x27;s treaty with the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in Adrianople, and later the same year he conveyed his niece Theodora to her husband, Uzun Hassan of the Ak Koyunlu.

David ascended the throne shortly after his brother&#x27;s death, sometime in April 1460. Although John IV had made his nephew Alexios V his heir, Alexios was a minor; according to Laonikos Chalkokondyles David, with the support of the Kabasitanoi &quot;archontes&quot;, pushed the young emperor aside and took the throne for himself.

With the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, the threat Mehmet II posed to the pocket empire had increased. David&#x27;s brother John had spent the following years up to his death building alliances to protect the empire, with the Georgian princes to the east and with Uzun Hassan of the Ak Koyunlu, and David seems to have counted on their support. The Muslim rulers of Sinope and Karaman appear to have been enlisted as allies by John or Uzun Hassan.

About this time, October 1460, one Ludovico da Bologna appeared at the court of Emperor Frederick III with two men who were ostensibly the ambassadors of Persia and Georgia; more specifically, the Persian ambassador—Nicholas of Tbilisi—was the representative of George VIII of Georgia, and the Georgian ambassador—recorded as &quot;Custopa&quot;, &quot;Custoda&quot;, &quot;Chastodina&quot; and other variations—represented Qvarqvare II, prince of Samtskhe. They carried letters signed not only by those Eastern rulers, but four more, as well as three Caucasian tribes all eager to take part in an alliance against the Ottomans. Ludovico&#x27;s entourage proceeded to Venice, and either there or at their next stop, Florence, a new ambassador joined his following: Michael Alighieri, who said he was the envoy of Emperor David.

In Florence, a city that was eager to build up a network of bases in the Levant, Alighieri negotiated a treaty between Florence and David of Trebizond granting to the city a consulate (&quot;fondaco&quot;) and trading terms that included a 2% levy on exports, as were enjoyed by the Genoese and Venetians in Trebizond. Like his ancestor, Dante Alighieri, Michael Alighieri was a Florentine, but had been trading on his own account in the Black Sea. Bryer mentions a document dated 28 April 1470, wherein the protectors of the Bank of St. George at Caffa gave Michael Alighieri safe conduct which covered his children and subordinates. Bryer treats Ludovico da Bologna&#x27;s claims with a degree of mistrust and suspicion, noting Ludovico &quot;seems to have been too glib and later obsessed with something of the attitude of a Baron Corvo towards the Church, which failed to take his personal ambitions seriously.&quot; On the other hand, Bryer assumes Michael Alighieri was a legitimate representative of Emperor David, although the letter he bore from David to Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy &quot;was written, if not in Italy, from an Italian point of view, and by someone who knew Trebizond well and had recently seen David Komnenos as the new Emperor.&quot; William Miller, in his account of the Empire of Trebizond, likewise assumes Michael Alighieri was the legitimate representative, while ignoring the existence of the sketchy Ludovico da Bologna, who had been the primary advocate for a Christian league.

With Western support against the Ottomans still unsolidified, David prematurely asked the Sultan for a remission of the tribute paid by his predecessor. Even worse, he made these demands through the envoys of Uzun Hassan, who made even more arrogant demands on behalf of their master. Sultan Mehmed dismissed them, telling they would know his answer later. That answer came the summer of the next year: a fleet under his admiral Kasim Pasha sailed along the Black Sea coast of Anatolia towards Trebizond while he led an army from Bursa eastward towards the city.

== The fall of Trebizond ==

After pretending to be ready to negotiate with some of his neighbors, Mehmed II besieged Sinope and obtained its surrender. The Sultan sent his fleet on to Trebizond, while he led the land army against Uzun Hassan. After Mehmed took the frontier fortress of Koylu Hisar by storm, and Uzun Hassan&#x27;s allies the Karamanians failed to come to his aid, Uzun Hassan sent his mother, Sara Khatun, with expensive gifts to the Sultan&#x27;s camp to sue for peace. While she managed to negotiate a peace treaty between Mehmed and the Aq Qoyunlu, she could do nothing for her daughter-in-law&#x27;s homeland, Trebizond. Steven Runciman repeated the exchange between Sara and Mehmed: &quot;Why tire yourself, my son, for nothing better than Trebizond?&quot; she asked him. He replied that the Sword of Islam was in his hand, and he would be ashamed not to tire himself for his faith.

With David&#x27;s most effective ally neutralized, Mehmed II marched to Trebizond. His fleet had landed there in early July, defeated David&#x27;s army, and then plundered the suburbs, besieging the city for more than a month. The Ottoman commander Mahmud Pasha Angelovic had opened negotiations with David even before his master&#x27;s arrival, and David&#x27;s &quot;protovestiarios&quot;, George Amiroutzes, advised the emperor to sue for peace. When Mehmed II arrived in August, he was displeased with the negotiations, but allowed them to proceed. David was now persuaded to surrender, on the condition that he be allowed to keep his family, household and wealth, and was promised a profitable retirement in Thrace.

David&#x27;s surrender on 15 August 1461 marks the end of the Empire of Trebizond and of the Byzantine imperial tradition. The deposed emperor, along with his family and courtiers, were transported to Constantinople. Meanwhile, the population of the city was divided into three groups, with some being appointed to serve the Sultan and his officers, others being added to the population of Constantinople, and the remainder being allowed to inhabit the outskirts of Trebizond itself. Some local youths were duly conscripted into the Janissaries, while the Ottoman admiral was left to garrison the city.

== After the Fall ==
David was settled in Adrianople together with his family, and received the profits of estates in the Struma River valley, comprising an annual income of some 300,000 pieces of silver. However, as a descendant of the Komnenoi family, which had ruled the Byzantine Empire for centuries, David was too prominent a symbol of the fallen regime, and could prove to be a potential rallying point for Greek resistance to Ottoman rule. Consequently, Mehmet waited for an opportunity to rid himself of an inconvenient captive.

An excuse presented itself less than two years later. According to an interpolator in the &quot;History&quot; of Chalkokondyles, referred to here as Pseudo-Chalkokondyles, David&#x27;s niece, Theodora (also known as Despina Khatun), had written letters to her uncle asking that he send one of his sons or his nephew Alexios, the son of his older brother Alexander, to live with her. Pseudo-Chalkokondyles states that George Amiroutzes found these letters, and out of fear for his own safety gave them to Sultan Mehmet. Theodore Spandounes claims that the letters were forged on orders of the Sultan, but the result was the same, regardless of the authenticity of the evidence. After some deliberations, Mehmet ordered David, his three sons, Basil, Manuel and Georgios, and his nephew, Alexios, to be imprisoned.

Marginalia in a manuscript of the gospels belonging to the commercial school at Chalke provide us with the date of the imprisonment of the five men: Saturday, 26 March 1463. This date is verified by another manuscript containing the &quot;Histories&quot; of Thucydides, currently held by the London Medical Society, which also adds that David&#x27;s sons had converted to Islam under the influence of members of the Kabasitanoi, who had done so out of hunger. The men were taken to Constantinople and imprisoned in the Beyoğlu jail, where with five others the last of the Komnenoi were executed with the sword on 1 November 1463 at four o&#x27;clock in the morning. Their execution was confirmed by a letter written by the Patriarch Sophronios I, who wrote that David &quot;with his three sons&quot; was killed &quot;a few days&quot; after his arrival in Constantinople.

Other members of the family fared little better. David&#x27;s daughter Anna, whom he had offered in marriage to Mehmed, was taken to the Imperial harem. Later she was married to Zaganos Pasha according to some sources she was killed by her husband because she did not want to convert, while according to others, she remarried Elvanbeyzade Sinan Bey after becoming widowed or divorced. Maria Gattilusio, the widow of David&#x27;s older brother Alexander, also joined the harem.

Spandounes, writing much later than these sources or Pseudo-Chalkokondyles but drawing on family traditions, reports a different fate for some of these people. He states that Maria&#x27;s son Alexios had been spared; according to tradition he was given lands just outside the city walls of Galata, where he was known locally as &quot;the Son of the Bey&quot; and after whom the district of Beyoğlu was named. Spandounes also writes that the widowed Empress Helena Kantakouzene was heavily fined by the Sultan for burying her husband and her sons, and spent the rest of her life in poverty. Her youngest son, George, was raised as a Muslim, but when he was later allowed to visit Uzun Hasan in Persia, he fled from the court to his sister in Georgia, where he reverted to Christianity and married a Georgian princess.

== Genealogy ==
One of David&#x27;s daughters survived him as the wife of a Gurieli ruler from the Dadiani family. The later-day Gurieli thus claimed descent from David and from dozens of emperors who were his ancestors.

David apparently had no children by his first wife Maria of Gothia. By his second wife Helena Kantakouzene, he had:
*Basil, beheaded in 1463
*Manuel, beheaded in 1463
*Anna (1447–after 1463), who was a concubine of Mehmed II and After married Zagan Pasha and then Sinan
*George, (1460–after 1463)
*Daughter (name unknown), who probably married Duke Mamia of Guria
According to the historian Warren Treadgold, David had seven sons, six of which were executed, the other presumably being George.

== Ancestry ==
== In popular culture ==
David and the fall of Trebizond are portrayed in Dorothy Dunnett&#x27;s novel &quot;The Spring of the Ram&quot;, second book in her House of Niccolo series. 

David appears as a minor character in Lawrence Schoonover&#x27;s novel &quot;The Burnished Blade&quot;, where he is portrayed as an adventurous but diplomatically astute young man.

<doc id="423669" wikidata="Q756089" url="?curid=423669" title="Whirligig beetle">
<text>The whirligig beetles are water beetles, comprising the family Gyrinidae, that usually swim on the surface of the water if undisturbed, though they swim underwater when threatened. They get their common name from their habit of swimming rapidly in circles when alarmed, and are also notable for their divided eyes which are believed to enable them to see both above and below water. (View wiki description) The family includes some 700 extant species worldwide, in 15 genera, plus a few fossil species. Most species are very similar in general appearance, though they vary in size from perhaps 3 mm to 18 mm in length. They tend to be flattened and rounded in cross section, in plain view as seen from above, and in longitudinal section. In fact their shape is a good first approximation to an ellipsoid, with legs and other appendages fitting closely into a streamlined surface. Whirligig beetles belong to the beetle suborder Adephaga, which also includes ground beetles and diving beetles.

==Description==

Whirligig beetles are most conspicuous for their bewildering swimming. They can be difficult to see if they are not moving or are under water. Most species are coloured steely grey or bronze. Their integument is finely sculpted with little pits; it is hard and elastic and produces a water repellent waxy outer layer, which is constantly supplemented. Among other functions, the lubricant layer and smooth outline make the beetles difficult to hold on to if caught.

The antennae are unusual among beetles, being short and plump, and placed about at water level. The compound eyes are remarkable for each being divided into a higher part that is above water level when a beetle is floating passively, and a lower part that is below water level. In this respect they recall the horizontally divided eyes of the four-eyed fishes (&quot;Anableps&quot;), which also live at the surface of the water. The middle, and more especially the hind legs are adapted for swimming (): they are greatly flattened and fringed with bristles that fold to aid swimming action. In contrast the front legs are long and adapted for grasping food or prey. In males the front tarsi have suckers, which are used to hold onto the slippery female during mating.

==Behavior and morphological adaptations==

The Gyrinidae are surface swimmers for preference. They are known for the bewildering and rapid gyrations in which they swim, and for their gregarious behavior. Most species also can fly well, even taking off from water if need be. The combination constitutes a survival strategy that helps them to avoid predation and take advantage of mating opportunities. In general the adults occupy areas where water flows steadily and not too fast, such as minor rapids and narrows in leisurely streams. Such places supply a good turnover of floating detritus or struggling insects or other small animals that have fallen in and float with the current.

The positions that individuals occupy within a group are determined by a number of factors, thought to include hunger, sex, species, water temperature, age, parasite level and stress level. Research underway on their behavior is directed at investigating the significance of chemical defense in relation to their position in the group. Such studies are of interest in research into aspects of nanotechnology because the beetles&#x27; motion may be expected to provide insights into how groups of robots might coordinate movements.In particular the beetles make behavioral trade-offs that affect their choices of positions within a group. For example, relatively hungry beetles go to the outside of a group, where there is less competition for finding food, but higher risk of encountering predators. Males are also more likely to be found on the outside of groups (although grouping is not known to be relevant to mating behavior in this family). The economies that the beetles can gain by suitably adjusting their positions within the group, are important when individuals swim against the flow of a stream. By swimming behind other beetles they can take advantage of forward-moving drafts. Such action is called drafting. The determination of forward/backward positioning within a group has been found to be affected in a complex manner by a combination of water speed, sex of the beetle, and the type of predator (bird or fish) that a beetle has most recently observed.

The beetles could use the waves generated by their moving as a sort of radar to detect the position of object on the water surface around them. This technique could be used to detect prey or to avoid colliding each other. 

The adult beetles carry a bubble of air trapped beneath their elytra. This allows them to dive and swim under well-oxygenated water for indefinite periods if necessary. The mechanism is sophisticated and amounts to a physical gill. In practice though, their ecological adaptation is for the adults to scavenge and hunt on the water surface, so they seldom stay down for long. The larvae have paired plumose tracheal gills on each of the first eight abdominal segments.

Generally, gyrinids lay their eggs under water, attached to water plants, typically in rows. Like the adults, the larvae are active predators, largely benthic inhabitants of the stream bed and aquatic plants. They have long thoracic legs with paired claws. Their mandibles are curved, pointed, and pierced with a sucking canal. In this they resemble the larvae of many other predatory water beetles, such as the Dytiscidae. Mature larvae pupate in a cocoon that also is attached to water plants.


== Taxonomy ==
Whirligig beetles were previously grouped with other aquatic members of the Adephaga such as Dytiscidae, as members of the group &quot;Hydradephaga&quot;. However based on molecular evidence they are currently thought to be the earliest diverging lineage of the Adephaga, and to have evolved their aquatic ecology independently from other adephagans.

<text>Watchman Nee, Ni Tuosheng, or Nee T&#x27;o-sheng (; November 4, 1903 – May 30, 1972), was a Chinese church leader and Christian teacher who worked in China during the 20th century. His evangelism was influenced by the Plymouth Brethren.

In 1922, he initiated church meetings in Fuzhou, Fujian province, that may be considered the beginning of the local churches. During his thirty years of ministry, Nee published many books expounding the Bible. He established churches throughout China and held many conferences to train Bible students and church workers. Following the Communist Revolution, Nee was persecuted and imprisoned for his faith and spent the last twenty years of his life in prison. He was honoured by Christopher H. Smith (R–NJ) in the US Congress on July 30, 2009.

==Family and childhood==
Watchman Nee was born on November 4, 1903, the third of nine children of Ni Weng-hsiu, a well-respected officer in the Imperial Customs Service, and Lin He-Ping (Peace Lin), who excelled as a child at an American-staffed Methodist mission school. His grandfather was a gifted Anglican preacher. During a stint at the Chinese Western Girls&#x27; School in Shanghai to improve her English, Lin He-Ping met Dora Yu, a young woman who gave up a potential career in medicine to serve as an evangelist and preacher.

Since Nee&#x27;s parents were both Methodists, he was baptized by a bishop of the Methodist Church as an infant.

==Early schooling==
In 1916, at age 13, Nee entered the Church Missionary Society Vernacular Middle School in Fuzhou, Fujian province to begin his Western-style education. He then went on to the middle school at Trinity College in Fuzhou, where he demonstrated great intelligence and ambition. Among his classmates was Wilson Wang, brother of one of Watchman Nee&#x27;s good friends, Leland Wang. The two boys completed college despite severe flooding which brought cholera and plague and hardship to their region. In the final examinations, the 2 boys scored almost the same marks with Wilson Wang topping the class, followed closely by Watchman Nee in second place.

==Conversion and training==
In the spring of 1920, when Nee was 17, Dora Yu was invited to hold ten days of revival meetings in the Church of Heavenly Peace in Fuzhou. After Nee&#x27;s mother attended these meetings, she was moved to apologize to her son for a previous incident of unjust punishment. Her action impressed Nee so much that he determined to attend the next day&#x27;s evangelistic meetings to see what was taking place there. After returning from the meeting, according to Nee&#x27;s own account:

As a student at Trinity College, Nee began to speak to his classmates concerning his salvation experience. Later, he recounted:
After his conversion, Nee desired to be trained as a Christian worker. He first attended Dora Yu&#x27;s Bible Institute in Shanghai, though he was still a high school student. However, he was dismissed due to his bad and lazy habits, such as sleeping in late. Eventually, Nee&#x27;s seeking to improve his character brought him into close contact with a British missionary Margaret E. Barber who became his teacher and mentor. Nee would visit Barber on a weekly basis in order to receive spiritual help. Barber treated Nee as a young learner and frequently administered strict discipline. When she died in 1930, Barber left all of her belongings to Nee, who wrote:

==The Plymouth Brethren connection==
Through Barber, Watchman Nee was introduced to the writings of D.M. Panton, Robert Govett, G.H. Pember, Jessie Penn-Lewis, T. Austin-Sparks, and others. In addition, he acquired books from Plymouth Brethren teachers like John Nelson Darby, William Kelly, and C.H. Mackintosh. Eventually, his personal library encompassed over three thousand titles on church history, spiritual growth, and Bible commentary, and he became intimately familiar with the Bible through diligent study using many different methods. In the early days of his ministry, he is said to have spent one-third of his income on personal needs, one-third to assist others, and the remaining third on spiritual books. He was known for his ability to select, comprehend, discern, and memorize relevant material, and grasp and retain the main points of a book while reading.

Nee derived many of his ideas, including plural eldership, disavowal of a clergy-laity distinction, and worship centered around the Lord&#x27;s Supper, from the Plymouth Brethren. From 1930 to 1935, his movement interacted internationally with the Raven-Taylor group of Exclusive Brethren led by James Taylor, Sr. This group &quot;recognized&quot; the Local Church movement as a parallel work of God, albeit one that had developed independently. Nee refused, however, to follow their practice of isolating themselves from other Christians and rejected their ban on celebrating The Lord&#x27;s Supper with other Christians. Matters came to a head when Exclusive Brethren leaders learned that during his 1933 visits to the United Kingdom and the United States Nee had broken bread with Honor Oak Christian Fellowship associated with the independent ministry of T. Austin-Sparks and with non-Brethren missionaries whom Nee had known in China. After a series of communications Nee received a letter dated August 31, 1935, signed by leading Brethren, severing fellowship with him and his movement.

==Marriage==
As a teenager, Nee fell in love with Charity Chang. Their two families had been friends for three generations. When Nee became a Christian, Charity ridiculed Jesus in Nee&#x27;s presence. This bothered him. Eventually, after much struggling, Nee felt he needed to give up on their relationship. Ten years later, after finishing her university education, Charity became a Christian. She began attending church meetings in Shanghai in 1934. In the same year, during Nee&#x27;s fourth &quot;Overcomer Conference&quot; in Hangzhou, the two were married. Charity cared for Nee in his frequent illness and was the only visitor Nee was permitted during his imprisonment. They had no children.

==Ministry==
In 1936, before a group of fellow workers, Watchman Nee outlined the commission of his ministry:

Nee began to write and publish at a very early age. In 1923, he began to publish the magazine &quot;The Present Testimony&quot;, and in 1925, he started another magazine entitled &quot;The Christian.&quot; It was also in 1925 when Nee changed his name from Ni Shu-tsu to Ni To-sheng (English translation: Watchman Nee). At age 21, Nee established the first &quot;local church&quot; in Sitiawan, Malaysia, while visiting his mother, who had moved there from China. In 1926, Nee established up another local church in Shanghai, which became the center of his work in China. By 1932, Nee&#x27;s practice of meeting as local churches spread throughout China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. He maintained this pattern until his imprisonment.

In 1928, Nee published a three-volume book entitled &quot;The Spiritual Man&quot;. In February of the same year, Nee held his first &quot;Overcomer Conference&quot; in Shanghai. In January 1934, Nee called a special conference on the subjects of &quot;Christ as the Centrality and Universality of God&quot; and &quot;The Overcomers&quot;. According to Nee, this was a turning point for him in his ministry. He said, &quot;My Christian life took a big turn from doctrines and knowledge to a living person, Christ, who is God&#x27;s centrality and universality.&quot;

In February 1934, Nee gave a series of talks in which he defined and expounded the practice of the local churches, stating that in the Bible, the church is never divided into regions and never denominated based on a teaching or doctrine. These talks were eventually published in the book &quot;The Assembly Life&quot;. In May of the same year, Nee encouraged Witness Lee to move to Shanghai from Yantai in order to join him and Ruth Lee in their work editing Nee&#x27;s publications.

In 1938, Nee traveled to Europe and gave messages that were later published as &quot;The Normal Christian Life.&quot; Upon his return, Nee gave a conference on the Body of Christ. According to Nee, this was the second turn in his ministry. Nee recounted, &quot;My first turn was to know Christ, and my second turn was to know His Body. To know Christ is only half of what the believers need. The believers also must know the Body of Christ. Christ is the head, and He is also the Body.&quot;

In 1939, Nee became involved with his second brother&#x27;s failing pharmaceutical company. Although acquiescing to family pressure, Nee also saw this as an opportunity to support his many co-workers who were suffering great poverty and hardship during the Second World War. Nee took over full management of the factory, reorganized it, and began to employ many local church members from Shanghai. At this time, some of the elders from the church in Shanghai questioned Nee&#x27;s involvement in business, causing Nee to suspend his ministry in 1942. Shortly afterward, the church in Shanghai stopped meeting altogether.

On March 6, 1945, Nee moved to Chongqing to oversee the factory there. There, he delivered a series of messages on Revelation 2 and 3 published as &quot;The Orthodoxy of the Church&quot; as well as messages on the Song of Songs. On September 9, 1945, the Japanese army surrendered in China, ending the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1946, Peace Wang and Witness Lee began to work to restore the church in Shanghai as well as Nee&#x27;s public ministry there. Nee purchased twelve bungalows at Kuliang to hold trainings for his co-workers in the Christian work. By April 1948, a revival was brought to the church in Shanghai, and Nee resumed his ministry there. When he returned, Nee handed his pharmaceutical factory over to the Christian work as an offering to God, influencing many others to hand over their possessions to the work. Within a short time, the church in Shanghai grew to over 1000 members.

==Persecution and imprisonment==

The rise of the Chinese Communist Party in 1949, with its doctrine of state atheism, caused Christians to come under great persecution. False charges and arrests were also brought against many foreign missionaries. Through intensive propaganda campaigns and threats of imprisonment, believers were influenced to accuse one another.

On April 10, 1952, Watchman Nee was arrested in Shanghai by Public Security officers from Manzhouli, Manchuria and charged with bribery, theft of state property, tax evasion, cheating on government contracts, and stealing of government economic information. Nee was also &quot;re-educated&quot;. On January 11, 1956, there was a nationwide sweep targeting the co-workers and elders in the local churches. Some died in labor camps, while others faced long prison sentences. On January 18, 1956, the Religious Affairs Bureau began twelve days of accusation meetings at the church assembly hall on Nanyang Road in Shanghai, in which many accusations were brought against Nee in large accusation meetings. On June 21, 1956, Nee appeared before the High Court in Shanghai, where it was announced that he had been excommunicated by the elders in the church in Shanghai and found guilty on all charges. He was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment with reform by labor. Initially, he was detained at Tilanqiao Prison in Shanghai but was later moved to other locations. Only his wife, Charity, was allowed to visit him.

On January 29, 1956, Public Security took over the Nanyang Road building, and many of Nee&#x27;s co-workers were arrested, put into isolation, and forced to repudiate Watchman Nee. Some co-workers joined in the accusation of Watchman Nee while others, such as Peace Wang, Ruth Lee, and Yu Chenghua remained silent and were punished with life imprisonment. Following this, mass accusation meetings were held across the country to condemn the &quot;anti-revolutionary sect of Watchman Nee&quot;.

==Later imprisonment and death==
One year before Nee&#x27;s death in 1972, his wife, Charity, died due to an accident and high blood pressure; Nee was not allowed to attend her funeral. Charity&#x27;s eldest sister then took the responsibility to care for Nee in prison. Nee was scheduled for release in 1967 but was detained in prison until his death on May 30, 1972. There was no announcement of his death nor any funeral. His remains were cremated on June 1, 1972, before his family arrived at the prison.

Nee&#x27;s grandniece recounted the time when she went to pick up Nee&#x27;s ashes:
==Beliefs==
Nee believed in the verbal inspiration of the Bible and that the Bible is God&#x27;s Word. He also believed that God is in one sense triune, Father, Son, and Spirit, distinctly three, yet fully one, co-existing and co-inhering each other from eternity to eternity. He believed that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, even God Himself, incarnated as a man with both the human life and the divine life, that He died on the cross to accomplish redemption, that he rose bodily from the dead on the third day, that He ascended into heaven and was enthroned, crowned with glory, and made the Lord of all, and that He will return the second time to receive His followers, to save Israel, and to establish His millennial kingdom on the earth. He believed that every person who believes in Jesus Christ will be forgiven by God, washed by His redeeming blood, justified by faith, regenerated by the Holy Spirit, and saved by grace. Such a believer is a child of God and a member of the Body of Christ. He also believed that the destiny of every believer is to be an integral part of the church, which is the Body of Christ and the house of God.
Nee had a unique blend of Brethren theology, the exchanged life theology of the Keswick conventions and his own insights into Christian theology. His well-known book, &quot;Sit, Walk, Stand&quot; focused on the believer&#x27;s position &quot;in Christ,&quot; an important feature of the Apostle Paul&#x27;s theology.

Watchman Nee is often associated with Free Grace theology. Nee held that assurance is not to be placed upon one&#x27;s sanctification and put a heavy emphasis on eternal rewards. Nee held that the &quot;outer darkness&quot; mentioned in Matthew is a temporal place for saved Christians who do not live in obedience.

==Publications==
In addition to speaking frequently before many audiences, Watchman Nee authored various books, articles, newsletters, and hymns. Most of his books were based on notes taken down by students during his spoken messages. Some books were compiled from messages published previously in his periodicals.

Watchman Nee&#x27;s best-known book in English is &quot;The Normal Christian Life&quot;, is based on talks he delivered in English during a trip to England and Europe in 1938 and 1939. There he expressed theological views on the New Testament book of Romans. The English messages of &quot;The Normal Christian Life&quot; were first published chapter by chapter in the magazine &quot;A Witness and A Testimony&quot; beginning in the November–December issue in 1940. It was later published as a book by Witness and Testimony Publishers in August 1945 and advertised in the September–October edition of the &quot;A Witness and A Testimony&quot; magazine.

<text>At Swim-Two-Birds is a 1939 novel by Irish writer Brian O&#x27;Nolan, writing under the pseudonym Flann O&#x27;Brien. It is widely considered to be O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s masterpiece, and one of the most sophisticated examples of metafiction.

The novel&#x27;s title derives from &quot;Snám dá Én&quot; (Middle Irish: &quot;The narrow water of the two birds&quot;; Modern Irish: &quot;Snámh Dá Éan&quot;), an ancient ford on the River Shannon, between Clonmacnoise and Shannonbridge, reportedly visited by the legendary King Sweeney, a character in the novel.

The novel was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. It was also included in a list, published by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, of the 100 best English-language novels of all time.

==Plot summary==
&quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; presents itself as a first-person story by an unnamed Irish student of literature. The student believes that &quot;one beginning and one ending for a book was a thing I did not agree with&quot;, and he accordingly sets three apparently quite separate stories in motion. The first concerns the Pooka MacPhellimey, &quot;a member of the devil class&quot;. The second is about a young man named John Furriskey, who turns out to be a fictional character created by another of the student&#x27;s creations, Dermot Trellis, a cynical writer of Westerns. The third consists of the student&#x27;s adaptations of Irish legends, mostly concerning Finn Mac Cool and Mad King Sweeney. But even this is a jest — the first of many in the novel — as there&#x27;s also a fourth beginning here: That introducing the Irish student&#x27;s own discourse on the benefits of three beginnings, setting his own story in motion.

In the autobiographical frame story, the student recounts details of his life. He lives with his uncle, who works as a clerk in the Guinness Brewery in Dublin. The uncle is a complacent and self-consciously respectable bachelor who suspects that the student does very little studying. This seems to be the case, as by his own account the student spends more time drinking stout with his college friends, lying in bed, and working on his book than he does going to class.

The stories that the student is writing soon become intertwined with each other. John Furriskey meets and befriends two of Trellis&#x27;s other characters, Antony Lamont and Paul Shanahan. They each become resentful of Trellis&#x27;s control over their destinies, and manage to drug him so that he will spend more time asleep, giving them the freedom to lead quiet domestic lives rather than be ruled by the lurid plots of his novels. Meanwhile, Trellis creates Sheila Lamont (Antony Lamont&#x27;s sister) in order that Furriskey might seduce and betray her, but &quot;blinded by her beauty&quot; Trellis &quot;so far forgets himself as to assault her himself.&quot; Sheila, in due course, gives birth to a child named Orlick, who is born as a polite and articulate young man with a gift for writing fiction. The entire group of Trellis&#x27;s characters, by now including Finn, Sweeney, the urbane Pooka and an invisible and quarrelsome Good Fairy who lives in the Pooka&#x27;s pocket, convenes in Trellis&#x27;s fictional Red Swan Hotel where they devise a way to overthrow their author. Encouraged by the others, Orlick starts writing a novel about his father in which Trellis is tried by his own creations, found guilty and viciously tortured. Just as Orlick&#x27;s novel is about to climax with Trellis&#x27; death, the college student passes his exams and reconciles with his uncle. He completes his story by having Trellis&#x27;s maid accidentally burn the papers sustaining the existence of Furriskey and his friends, freeing Trellis.

==Genesis and composition==
The idea of interaction between the author and his characters is not new, and one earlier example is Miguel de Unamuno&#x27;s 1914 novel &quot;Niebla&quot;. An even earlier example is &quot;A Sensation Novel&quot; (1871), a comic musical play in three acts (or volumes) written by W. S. Gilbert before he began collaborating with Arthur Sullivan. (Details of &quot;A Sensation Novel&quot; reappear in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s musical &quot;Ruddigore&quot;.) The story of &quot;A Sensation Novel&quot; concerns an author suffering from writer&#x27;s block who finds that the characters in his novel are dissatisfied. O’Nolan first explored the idea of fictional characters rebelling against their creator in a short story titled &quot;Scenes in a Novel&quot;, published in the UCD literary magazine &quot;Comhthrom Féinne&quot; (Ir., &quot;Fair Play&quot;) in 1934. The story was a first-person narrative ostensibly written by a novelist called Brother Barnabas, whose characters become tired of doing his bidding and who eventually conspire to murder him:The book is seething with conspiracy and there have been at least two whispered consultations between all the characters, including two who have not yet been officially created. ... Candidly, reader, I fear my number&#x27;s up.

The mythological content of &quot;At Swim&quot; was inspired by O&#x27;Nolan&#x27;s affection for early Irish literature. He grew up in an Irish-speaking home and although he claimed in later life that he had attended few of his college lectures, he studied the late medieval Irish literary tradition as part of the syllabus and acquired enough Old Irish to be able to compose in the language with reasonable fluency. His M.A. thesis was entitled &quot;Nature Poetry in Irish&quot; (&quot;Nádúirfhilíocht na Gaedhilge&quot;), although his examiner Agnes O&#x27;Farrelly rejected the initial draft and he was obliged to rewrite it. &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; contains references to no less than fourteen sources in early and medieval Irish literature. Most of the poetry recited by King Sweeney was taken directly from the Middle Irish romance &quot;Buile Suibhne&quot;, O&#x27;Nolan slightly modifying the translations for comic effect. For example, the original &quot;an clog náomh re náomhaibh&quot;, translated by J. G. O&#x27;Keeffe in the standard edition as &quot;the bell of saints before saints&quot;, is rendered by O&#x27;Nolan as &quot;the saint-bell of saints with sainty-saints&quot;.

&quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; has been classified as a Menippean satire. O&#x27;Nolan was exposed to the Menippean tradition through the modern literature he is known to have admired, including works by James Joyce, Aldous Huxley, Søren Kierkegaard and James Branch Cabell, but he may also have encountered it in the course of his study of medieval Irish literature; the Middle Irish satire &quot;Aislinge Meic Con Glinne&quot; has been described as &quot;the best major work of parody in the Irish language&quot;.

O&#x27;Nolan composed the novel on an Underwood portable typewriter in the bedroom he shared with his younger brother Micheál. The typewriter rested on a table constructed by O&#x27;Nolan from the offcuts of a modified trellis that had stood in the O&#x27;Nolan family&#x27;s back garden. O&#x27;Nolan&#x27;s biographer believes that it was the unusual material that the writing table was made of that inspired the name of the character &quot;Dermot Trellis&quot;, although there is no reference to where this information was found.

O&#x27;Nolan used various found texts in the novel; a letter from a horseracing tipster was given to him by a college friend, while the painter Cecil Salkeld gave O&#x27;Nolan the original &quot;Conspectus of the Arts and Sciences&quot;. Before submitting the manuscript for publication O&#x27;Nolan gave it to friends to read. A friend wrote him a letter which included suggestions about how to end the novel and O&#x27;Nolan incorporated the salient part of the letter into the text itself, although he later cut it. The sudden death in 1937 of O&#x27;Nolan&#x27;s father Michael O&#x27;Nolan may have influenced the episode in which the student narrator regrets his unkind thoughts about his previously despised uncle.

==Publication history==
&quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; was accepted for publication by Longman&#x27;s on the recommendation of Graham Greene, who was a reader for them at the time. It was published under the pseudonym of Flann O&#x27;Brien, a name O&#x27;Nolan had already used to write hoax letters to the &quot;Irish Times&quot;. O&#x27;Nolan had suggested using &quot;Flann O&#x27;Brien&quot; as a pen-name during negotiation with Longman&#x27;s:I have been thinking over the question of a pen-name and would suggest Flann O&#x27;Brien. I think this invention has the advantage that it contains an unusual name and one that is quite ordinary. &quot;Flann&quot; is an old Irish name now rarely heard. The book was published on 13 March 1939, but did not sell well: by the outbreak of World War II it had sold scarcely more than 240 copies. In 1940, Longman&#x27;s London premises were destroyed during a bombing raid by the Luftwaffe and almost all the unsold copies were incinerated. The novel was republished by Pantheon Books in New York City in 1950, on the recommendation of James Johnson Sweeney, but sales remained low. In May 1959 Timothy O&#x27;Keeffe, while editorial director of the London publishing house MacGibbon &amp; Kee, persuaded O&#x27;Nolan to allow him to republish &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds.&quot; More recently, the novel was republished in the United States by Dalkey Archive Press.

==Literary significance and criticism==

The initial reviews for &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; were not enthusiastic. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; said that the book&#x27;s only notable feature was a &quot;schoolboy brand of mild vulgarity&quot;; the &quot;New Statesman&quot; complained that &quot;long passages in imitation of the Joycean parody of the early Irish epic are devastatingly dull&quot; and the Irish novelist Seán Ó Faoláin commented in &quot;John O&#x27;London&#x27;s Weekly&quot; that although the book had its moments, it &quot;had a general odour of spilt Joyce all over it.&quot;
However, most of the support for &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; came not from newspaper reviewers but from writers. Dylan Thomas, in a remark that would be quoted on dust-jackets in later editions of the book, said &quot;This is just the book to give your sister – if she&#x27;s a loud, dirty, boozy girl&quot;. Anthony Burgess considered it one of the ninety-nine greatest novels written between 1939 and 1984. Graham Greene&#x27;s enthusiastic reader&#x27;s report was instrumental in getting the book published in the first place:It is in the line of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; and &quot;Ulysses&quot;: its amazing spirits do not disguise the seriousness of the attempt to present, simultaneously as it were, all the literary traditions of Ireland. ... We have had books inside books before now, and characters who are given life outside their fiction, but O&#x27;Nolan takes Pirandello and Gide a long way further. O&#x27;Nolan&#x27;s friend Niall Sheridan gave James Joyce an inscribed copy of the book. Joyce declared it the work of a &quot;real writer&quot; who had &quot;the true comic spirit&quot; and attempted to get the book reviewed in French periodicals, although without success. It is thought to have been the last novel Joyce ever read. Anthony Cronin has written of the effect the novel had on him as a seventeen-year-old in 1940s Dublin, praising its &quot;umistakable sheen of the &quot;avant-garde&quot;&quot;, describing it &quot;breathtakingly funny&quot; and noting &quot;the deadly accuracy of the ear for lower middle class Dublin speech&quot;.

Most academic criticism of the book has sought to appropriate it one way or the other; critics like Bernard Benstock, who argued that O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s embrace of myth and refusal of realism &quot;ensnare[d] him with the second rank&quot;, have been in the minority. Vivian Mercier described it in &quot;The Irish Comic Tradition&quot; as &quot;the most fantastic novel written by an Irishman in the twentieth century – with the doubtful exception of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.&quot; Rüdiger Imhof has noted how works by B. S. Johnson, Gilbert Sorrentino, Alasdair Gray and John Fowles carry explicit references to &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;. Michael Cronin draws attention to the metafictional and game-playing elements of the book, comparing it to the fictions of Raymond Queneau, and responds to criticism that the book is insufficiently respectful of realist conventions:Contrary to what Benstock argues, what post-independence Ireland needed was not less but more of the type of playful, self-aware writing being proposed by Flann O&#x27;Brien in &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;. ... We would all be very much poorer without Mad O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s narrative chessmen.Keith Hopper has argued that, contrary to the common tendency to favour &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; as &quot;the primary defining text of the O&#x27;Brien oeuvre&quot;, the novel is in fact less, not more, experimental than O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s second novel, the posthumously published &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;:&quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; is best considered as a late-modernist, transitional text which critiques both realism and modernism in an openly deconstructive manner, and in the process comes to the brink of an exciting new aesthetic. I will argue that the metafictional techniques developed publicly in [the book] ... are imbricated and embedded within the texture of &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;.

In a long essay published in 2000, Declan Kiberd analysed &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; from a postcolonial perspective, seeing it as a complex imaginative response to the economic and social stagnation of 1930s Ireland and arguing that the fragmented and polyphonic texture of the book is the work of an author who is &quot;less anxious to say something new than to find a self that is capable of saying anything at all.&quot; Kiberd suggests that the one element of the book which is not seriously ironised or satirised is Sweeney&#x27;s poetry, and that this is related to O&#x27;Nolan&#x27;s genuine if complex respect for Irish-language literature:What saved O&#x27;Brien from lapsing into postmodern nihilism was not his Catholicism which held that the world was a doomed and hopeless place, but his respect for the prose of &quot;An tOileánach&quot; or the poetry of &quot;Buile Suibhne&quot;, where language still did its appointed work. ... He was an experimentalist who was way ahead of his time: only after his death did his readers learn how to become his contemporaries.

In a 1939 essay titled &quot;When Fiction Lives in Fiction&quot;, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges described Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s masterpiece as follows, I have enumerated many verbal labyrinths, but none so complex as the recent book by Flann O&#x27;Brien, &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;. A student in Dublin writes a novel about the proprietor of a Dublin public house, who writes a novel about the habitués of his pub (among them, the student), who in their turn write novels in which proprietor and student figure along with other writers about other novelists. The book consists of the extremely diverse manuscripts of these real or imagined persons, copiously annotated by the student. &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; is not only a labyrinth; it is a discussion of the many ways to conceive of the Irish novel and a repertory of exercises in prose and verse which illustrate or parody all the styles of Ireland. The magisterial influence of Joyce (also an architect of labyrinths, also a literary Proteus) is undeniable, but not disproportionate in this manifold book. Arthur Schopenhauer wrote that dreaming and wakefulness are the pages of a single book, and that to read them in order is to live, and to leaf through them at random, is to dream. Paintings within paintings and books that branch into other books help us sense this oneness.

In 2011, the book was placed on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s top 100 fiction books written in English since 1923.

The Austrian director Kurt Palm made a film from the book in 1997. The title of the film is &quot;In Schwimmen-zwei-Vögel&quot;.

Actor Brendan Gleeson has long planned to make his directorial debut in a movie adaptation of the book. The Irish production company Parallel Pictures announced that it would produce the film with a budget of $11 million. Michael Fassbender, Colin Farrell, Gabriel Byrne, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Cillian Murphy have at various times been attached to star in the film. Gleeson confirmed in July 2011 that he had secured funding for the project. He described the writing of the script as torturous and that it had taken 14 drafts so far. As of April 2014, the film was still in development.

===Stage===
The book has been adapted for the stage on at least four occasions. The first stage version was commissioned in 1971 by the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and written by Audrey Welsh. The British theatre company Ridiculusmus toured a three-man adaptation of it in 1994–1995 and there was a 1998 version by Alex Johnston for the Abbey Theatre.

==Epigraph==
The Greek phrase found in the front-matter of the novel is from Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Herakles&quot;: (existatai gar pant&#x27; ap&#x27; allêlôn dikha), English &quot;for all things change, making way for each other&quot;. This may be construed as a consolation: &quot;No matter how bad you feel, don&#x27;t lose hope, because you can count on things getting better.&quot;

<doc id="423676" wikidata="Q312695" url="?curid=423676" title="Dominik Hašek">
<text>Dominik Hašek (, ; born 29 January 1965) is a Czech former ice hockey goaltender who played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL), mostly for the Buffalo Sabres. Widely regarded as one of the best goaltenders in history, Hašek also played for the Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, and Ottawa Senators in his NHL career before finishing his career in Europe. While in Buffalo, he became one of the league&#x27;s finest goaltenders, earning him the nickname &quot;The Dominator&quot;. His strong play has been credited with establishing European goaltenders in a league previously dominated by North Americans. He is a two-time Stanley Cup champion as a member of the Red Wings, winning his first one as the starting goaltender and his second one as the backup.

Hašek was one of the league&#x27;s most successful goaltenders of the 1990s and early 2000s. From 1993 to 2001, he won six Vezina Trophies, the most under the award&#x27;s current system of voting for the best individual goaltender. In 1998 he won his second consecutive Hart Memorial Trophy, becoming the first goaltender to win the award multiple times. During the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, he led the Czech national ice hockey team to its first and only Olympic gold medal. The feat made him a popular figure in his home country and prompted hockey legend Wayne Gretzky to call him &quot;the best player in the game&quot;. While with the Red Wings in 2002, Hašek became the first European-trained starting goaltender to win the Stanley Cup. In the process, he set a record for shutouts in a postseason year.

Hašek was considered an unorthodox goaltender, with a distinct style that labeled him a &quot;flopper&quot;. He was best known for his concentration, foot speed, flexibility, and unconventional saves, such as covering the puck with his blocker rather than his trapper. Hašek holds the record for highest NHL career save percentage (0.9223) and is seventh (first in the modern era) in goals against average (2.202). He also has the third-highest NHL single-season save percentage (0.9366 in 1998–99), behind Tim Thomas in 2010–11 and Brian Elliott&#x27;s 0.940 in 2011–12. Hašek is the only goalie to face the most shots per 60 minutes and have the highest save percentage in the same season, which he achieved twice (1996 and 1998) playing for the Sabres.

At the time of his retirement, he was the oldest active goaltender in the NHL at 43, and the second-oldest active player in the league after Red Wings teammate Chris Chelios, who was 46. Hašek announced his retirement on 9 June 2008, but on 21 April 2009, he announced a comeback to professional hockey and signed a contract with HC Pardubice of the Czech Extraliga. On 7 June 2010, he signed with Spartak Moscow of the KHL and played the last season of his career with this team. Hašek announced his second retirement on 9 October 2012. Hašek was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on 17 November 2014. He is also a member of the Czech Ice Hockey Hall of Fame and the IIHF Hall of Fame. His number was retired by the Buffalo Sabres (2015) and HC Pardubice (2013). In 2017, he was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

==Early life==
Hašek started playing hockey at the age of six in his native Czechoslovakia. As he explains:

In 1980, Hašek joined the top hockey league in the country, the Czechoslovak Extraliga, with his hometown team, HC Pardubice. He became the youngest hockey player in history to play at the professional level at age 16. He helped to win two league titles in 1987 and 1989. The next year, he was conscripted in the Czechoslovak Army and played for an army team Dukla Jihlava. After making his mark and eventually playing for the Czechoslovak national team, Hašek entered the NHL draft and was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks in 1983. At the time, NHL teams were wary of drafting players from behind the Iron Curtain who were often barred from playing in NHL by their countries. Consequently, Hašek was picked in the 10th round (199th overall) and was the 17th goaltender selected. Hašek did not even know he had been drafted until several months later.

Hasek played on the Czechoslovakia team in the 1988 Winter Olympics, featuring in games against Finland and Canada as the team finished sixth overall.

Until 1990, Hašek played in his native Czechoslovakia for HC Pardubice and Dukla Jihlava. He won the Golden Hockey Stick, given to the most valuable player in the Extraliga, in 1987, 1989 and 1990. He was named the Extraliga&#x27;s Goaltender of the Year for four consecutive years from 1986 through 1990. His American career began with the Indianapolis Ice of the International Hockey League (IHL), where he played parts of two seasons. His NHL debut with the Blackhawks finally came in the 1990–91 season, seven years after the 1983 NHL Entry Draft.

==NHL career==
===Chicago Blackhawks (1990–1992)===
In Chicago, Hašek spent time as the backup to Ed Belfour, and played only 25 games over two seasons with the Blackhawks, splitting time between the Blackhawks and the Indianapolis Ice of the IHL. On 6 November 1990, wearing the number 34 (31 was worn by backup goaltender Jacques Cloutier that year), Hašek made his first NHL start in a 1–1 tie against the Hartford Whalers.
His first victory came on 8 March 1991, by a score of 5–3 over the Buffalo Sabres, and on 9 January 1992, he recorded his first shutout in a 2–0 win against the Toronto Maple Leafs. During this time with the Blackhawks, his goaltending coach was Vladislav Tretiak, who was selected in the 1983 draft but was barred from playing in the NHL by the Soviet government. Hašek appeared in game 4 of the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins, after Belfour allowed two goals on four shots in the opening 6:33, and had 21 saves. Although the Penguins won and clinched the Stanley Cup, Hašek&#x27;s performance attracted the attention of the Sabres, who had considered trading for him earlier that season.

===Buffalo Sabres (1992–2001)===
After the Stanley Cup Finals appearance, Chicago decided to stay with Belfour and Jimmy Waite, and traded Hašek to the Buffalo Sabres for goaltender Stéphane Beauregard and future considerations, which later materialized into a draft pick used to obtain Éric Dazé. In Buffalo, wearing number 39, he was initially the backup goaltender, playing behind Grant Fuhr. When Fuhr was injured partway through the 1993–94 season, Hašek was elevated to starter and soon developed into a top-tier goaltender. In 1994, he won his first Vezina Trophy, was runner-up for the Hart Memorial Trophy and shared the William M. Jennings Trophy with Fuhr. Hašek played 58 games with a league-best 1.95 goals against average (GAA), seven shutouts, and a .930 save percentage. He followed this feat by again winning the Vezina Trophy and again placing as a Hart finalist in 1994–95.

Hašek&#x27;s success in the 1996–97 season was overshadowed by a conflict with then-head coach Ted Nolan. The conflict created a tense, clique-like atmosphere in the Sabres&#x27; clubhouse.
In Game 3 of the Sabres&#x27; best-of-seven first-round playoff series against the Ottawa Senators, Hašek removed himself in the second period and was replaced by Steve Shields. Hašek suffered a mild sprain of his right MCL, and the team doctor pronounced him day-to-day. However, the media and some teammates speculated Hašek was using his injury to bail out on the team. One such individual was &quot;Buffalo News&quot; columnist Jim Kelley, who wrote a column detailing Hašek&#x27;s injury and his conflict with Nolan, and questioning the goaltender&#x27;s mental toughness. When Kelley approached Hašek for an interview after a loss in Game 5, Hašek physically attacked the journalist and received a three-game suspension and a $10,000 (US) fine as a result of the incident. With Shields in goal, the Sabres fought back against the Senators and took the series in seven games. However, Hašek did not play in the following series against the Philadelphia Flyers, which Buffalo lost in five games.

Though general manager John Muckler was named Executive of the Year, he was fired for his constant feuding with Nolan. Hašek, who sided with Muckler, stated in an interview during the 1997 NHL Awards ceremony that the team would benefit from replacing Nolan.
Although Nolan won the Jack Adams Award as the league&#x27;s top coach and was popular with Sabres fans, new general manager Darcy Regier only offered him a one-year contract extension. Nolan rejected the offer on the grounds that it was too short and parted ways with the franchise. This upset many fans, who blamed Nolan&#x27;s departure on Hašek&#x27;s alleged attempt to get rid of him.
For the first six weeks of the next season he was booed so vigorously that arena workers would play tapes of a crowd cheering to help balance it out.
As the season progressed, the booing of Hašek ceased, as he posted a league-record seven shutouts in December and continued to play at an elite level. He won the Vezina Trophy again, as well as the Lester B. Pearson Award and the Hart Trophy as league MVP. He became one of the few goaltenders in NHL history to win the Hart, alongside Jacques Plante, Carey Price, Chuck Rayner, Al Rollins, José Théodore and Roy Worters.

Hašek played a career-high 72 games in the 1997–98 season, and set a team record with 13 shutouts. Six of these shutouts came in December, which tied the all-time NHL record for most in one month. He again won the Lester B. Pearson Award, the Hart Trophy, and the Vezina Trophy, becoming the first goaltender in NHL history to win the Hart twice. He donated the $10,000 prize money after winning the Pearson Award in 1998 to the &quot;Variety Club of Buffalo&quot;. In the off-season he signed a three-year, $26 million deal, securing the highest goaltender salary contract at that time.

In 1998–99, Hašek averaged a career-best 1.87 GAA and .937 save percentage, capturing him his third consecutive Vezina, and fifth overall. He was also a finalist for the Hart and Pearson trophies. Though the Sabres did not have a stellar regular season and finished with the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, they defeated the Ottawa Senators, Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs in the playoffs en route to a best-of-seven Stanley Cup Finals against the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Dallas Stars. The Sabres eventually lost the series four games to two, with the decisive sixth game being one of the longest Stanley Cup playoff games in NHL history. Hašek and Ed Belfour made 50 and 53 saves, respectively, in a sudden-death triple-overtime duel that only ended when Brett Hull scored a controversial Cup-winning goal with his skate in the goal crease.

The goal was not reviewed immediately, so officials did not notice Hull&#x27;s skate in the crease until minutes later. After video reviews showed Hull&#x27;s position, the goal was still upheld, leaving the Sabres infuriated. Hašek commented, &quot;Maybe [the video goal judge] was in the bathroom. Maybe he was sleeping. Maybe he doesn&#x27;t know the rule.&quot; The following season, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announced that video replays would no longer be used to judge if players are in the crease or not, and that it would be a judgment call by the officiating crew. After the season ended, Hašek contemplated retirement because of a combination of injuries and a desire to become more involved in his family life. The announcement stunned many of his teammates, particularly Michael Peca and Jason Woolley.

In the 1999–2000 season, Hašek was hampered by a nagging groin injury. He missed forty games and failed to win a major NHL award for the first time in several years. Though he healed in time for the playoffs, the Sabres were eliminated in the first round in five games by the Flyers. In 2000–01—his final season with Buffalo—Hašek set a modern era record by collecting his sixth Vezina Trophy. He also won his second William M. Jennings Trophy. The Sabres played Philadelphia in the first round of the playoffs again, where Hašek outplayed his 1998 Olympic back-up Roman Čechmánek. In the clinching sixth game, Hašek recorded a shutout against the Flyers. In the second round, the Sabres played a seven-game series against Mario Lemieux&#x27;s Penguins, which culminated with the Penguins winning the final game in overtime.

===First tenure with the Detroit Red Wings (2001–2002; 2003–2004)===
Before the start of the next season, Hašek was traded to the Detroit Red Wings in an attempt to lower the Sabres&#x27; payroll and to send Hašek to a more competitive team. He was dealt for Vyacheslav Kozlov, a first-round selection in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft and future considerations, which eventually became the draft pick of Jim Slater. During his first season with Detroit, Hašek posted a career-high 41 wins with just 15 losses, helping the Red Wings earn the President&#x27;s Trophy with the league&#x27;s best record. In the playoffs, he led the Wings past the Vancouver Canucks, the St. Louis Blues, the Colorado Avalanche and eventually the Carolina Hurricanes in the finals to win the Stanley Cup. During the Conference Finals against Colorado, he became the first goaltender to be awarded an assist on an overtime game-winning goal in the post-season after passing the puck to Wings captain Steve Yzerman, who then assisted Fredrik Olausson in scoring the final goal of the third game of that series. He also set a record for most shutouts in a post-season with six, broken the year after by Martin Brodeur with seven.

That summer, Hašek officially announced his retirement so that he could spend time with his family and other hobbies.
However, after Detroit&#x27;s first-round loss to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the following season, he expressed his desire to play again. This created a difficult situation for the Red Wings, who had two years left on Curtis Joseph&#x27;s three-year $24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure knowing that the rival Avalanche would be looking for a goaltender of at least equal talent to replace Patrick Roy after his retirement. With Manny Legace also on the Wings&#x27; roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goaltenders.

In the 2003–04 season Hašek injured his groin after playing just 14 games. On 9 January, he and the team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Hašek privately told general manager Ken Holland that he would not accept any pay while he was injured. On 10 February, he announced that he was not going to continue to play that season, surprising the Red Wings management. He eventually revealed that he refused about $3 million of his $6 million salary. In April 2004, he underwent groin surgery in Prague, and returned to his hometown of Pardubice to recuperate.

===Ottawa Senators (2005–2006)===
After his contract with the Red Wings expired, Hašek announced his intention to play for a Stanley Cup contender, and specifically named the Ottawa Senators as a possibility. On 6 July 2004, after trading Patrick Lalime to the St. Louis Blues, the Senators signed Hašek to a one-year deal.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Hašek toured with the Primus Worldstars. Similar to the tour Wayne Gretzky and IMG formed during the 1994–95 NHL lockout, the Primus Worldstars Tour ran 7–23 December, playing in seven different countries (Riga, Latvia; Moscow and St Petersburg, Russia; Bratislava, Slovakia; Bern, Switzerland; Karlstad, Jönköping and Linköping, Sweden; Oslo, Norway; Katowice, Poland) in ten scheduled games. The tour competed against all-star teams or club teams of each country.

Hašek played increasingly well for the Senators up until the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. During the season, he reached 300 career wins, and his GAA and save percentage were the second-best in the league. Upon departure to Turin, Hašek&#x27;s equipment was accidentally left behind in Ottawa. This caused Hašek to miss a number of practices with the Czech national team. At the Winter Olympics, he injured his right adductor muscle while making a save in the first qualifying match against Germany, forcing him to leave the game after only 9 minutes and 25 seconds.
Hašek&#x27;s injury caused him to miss the rest of the regular season and post-season, despite several rumours that he would return in time for the playoffs. He said that if he were to be re-signed, he would play for a base salary of $500,000 with bonuses.

After the Senators were eliminated in the second round, they opted not to re-sign Hašek.

===Return to and second tenure with the Red Wings (2006–2008)===

On 31 July 2006, at the age of 41, Hašek joined the Red Wings for the second time. He signed a one-year $750,000 US
contract, with added bonuses if the team succeeded in the playoffs. He posted 38 wins and a 2.05 GAA while leading the Red Wings to
the number one seed in the Western Conference. He also broke his own personal record by going 181 minutes and 17 seconds without allowing a goal.
Midway through the regular season, the team announced that to avoid injury and preserve Hašek for the playoffs, he would not play on consecutive nights. He played his first consecutive nights of the season on 21 and 22 April against the Calgary Flames in games 5 and 6 of the Western Conference Quarterfinals. Hašek won both games, clinching the series for Detroit. In the next round against the San Jose Sharks, the Red Wings were on the road and down two games to one, but Hašek held the Sharks to three goals in the next three games. His 28-save shutout in game six was his 13th in postseason play and sent the Red Wings to the Western Conference finals against the Anaheim Ducks. However, Hašek and the Red Wings lost in six games to the Ducks, who eventually defeated the Ottawa Senators for the Stanley Cup.

Hašek contemplated retirement in the 2007 offseason, but on 5 July 2007, he signed a one-year contract with Detroit worth $2 million with up to $2 million in bonuses,
reportedly turning down $5 million for salary cap room for the rest of the Red Wings&#x27; roster.

During the 2007–08 season, Hašek was replaced by backup Chris Osgood, who had originally been waived by the Red Wings to make way for Hašek as the teams starting goaltender before the 2001–02 season. When Hašek recovered and got back into his stride, Detroit chose to alternate goaltenders in tandem instead of designating either as the backup. Detroit head coach Mike Babcock announced that Hašek was to start in the 2008 playoffs. Through the first two games against the Nashville Predators, the Red Wings were victorious, but after a lackluster performance in the next two, Osgood was in goal for the remainder of the playoffs. Despite expressing disappointment at losing his starting position, Hašek maintained his professionalism in practice and continued to support his teammates, with Darren McCarty citing a close relationship between Hašek and Osgood. Eventually the Red Wings beat the Penguins in six games for the Stanley Cup.

On 9 June 2008, Hašek announced his retirement from the NHL, only five days after winning his second Stanley Cup with the Red Wings, saying he lacked the motivation for another year in the NHL. With Osgood, the two were awarded the William M. Jennings Trophy for fewest goals against on a team in the season.

==Final years in Europe and retirement==
In April 2009, Hašek once again came out of retirement and signed a one-year contract with HC Moeller Pardubice, the club where he started his long career. In the 2009–10 season he led his team to win the Czech league title. Hašek had three shutouts in the playoffs, one in the finals, while his Pardubice lost just one game in the playoffs before claiming 12 consecutive wins. For the 2010–11 hockey season, Hašek signed a one-year contract with HC Spartak Moscow.

On 15 May 2012, Czech website hokej.cz reported that Hašek had discussed playing for Piráti Chomutov after their promotion to the Czech Extraliga. On 25 May 2012, Czech sport website Deniksport reported that Hašek was considering a return to the NHL, possibly with the Red Wings or Tampa Bay Lightning. However, the start of the 2012–13 NHL season was delayed due to the 2012–13 NHL lockout and Hašek announced his retirement on 9 October 2012.

The Sabres retired Hašek&#x27;s #39 jersey prior to a 13 January 2015 game against the Red Wings, making Hašek&#x27;s number the seventh to be retired in Sabres history. In a ceremony held on 27 January 2017, during the All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, Hašek was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

==International play==
Hašek&#x27;s most memorable international performance came in the 1998 Winter Olympics, where he led the Czech national team to the gold medal. He allowed six goals in total, with only two of them coming in the medal round. Against Team Canada in the semifinals, Hašek stopped Theoren Fleury, Ray Bourque, Joe Nieuwendyk, Eric Lindros and Brendan Shanahan in a dramatic shootout win. He then shut out the Russian team 1–0 in the final game, stopping 20 shots. He was later announced as the best goaltender in the Olympics. After he won the gold, he was quoted as saying:

His play made him one of the most popular figures in the Czech Republic, so much so that residents chanted &quot;Hašek to the castle!&quot; in the streets, referring to the Prague Castle, the seat of the President of the Czech Republic. In response to this, Hašek called the president Václav Havel and jokingly told him that his job was not in jeopardy.
He also helped to inspire an opera (titled &quot;Nagano&quot;) about the Czech team&#x27;s gold medal victory,
and in 2003, Petr Pravec and Lenka Šarounová named an asteroid (8217 Dominikhašek) in his honour.

In the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Hašek played for just nine minutes and twenty-five seconds, until he injured his right adductor muscle.
Despite his absence, the Czechs managed to earn the bronze medal with backup goaltender Tomáš Vokoun, which Hašek received as well.

==Style of play==
Hašek had an unorthodox goaltending style.
He was extraordinarily flexible and was jokingly described in a MasterCard commercial as having &quot;a Slinky for a spine&quot;.
In order to cover the bottom of the net, where most goals are scored, Hašek dropped down on almost every shot. His &quot;flopping&quot; style saw him flailing in the crease, using every part of his body, including his head, to stop the puck. Hašek occasionally dropped his stick and covered the puck with his stick hand, whereas most goaltenders would use the glove hand instead.
In response to the speculation he received from his style, Hašek explained:

Hašek&#x27;s unique style attracted fans to games.
Because of his flexibility, Hašek could make difficult saves that other goaltenders could not—an opposing coach once referred to them as &quot;miracle saves&quot;. These types of saves include toe-stops and a maneuver known as the &quot;Hašek roll&quot;. Hašek was also known for his strict regimen of conditioning. During the off-season between May and September 2006, he lost a considerable amount of weight to increase his flexibility. Hašek was one of the last goaltenders to wear a helmet-and-cage combo rather than a contemporary hybrid goaltender mask. The last few included his former teammate Chris Osgood, who left the NHL three years after Hašek; Rick DiPietro borrowed one of Osgood&#x27;s helmets for a short time while he recovered from a facial injury.

==Personal life==
Hašek and his former wife Alena have a son named Michael (born 1990) and a daughter named Dominika (born 1995). Dominika is the lead singer of the electro-pop band We Are Domi, which represented the Czech Republic in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022, finishing in 22nd place. In November 2012 Hašek announced his divorce after 23 years of marriage.
He divides much of his free time playing squash and inline hockey, where he plays defense. When he was younger, Hašek played competitive football as a midfielder, and was a junior tennis champion in Eastern Bohemia.
His brother Martin is also a competitive athlete and played for the Czech Republic football team AC Sparta Prague before retiring and eventually deciding to coach. Hobby-wise, Hašek claims that he has been a fan of professional wrestling since his Buffalo days, and says that he mostly follows his favorite wrestlers, Stone Cold Steve Austin and Don &quot;The Rock&quot; Muraco.

Because of his formal education, Hašek stands out among Czech sportsmen. He earned a university degree after studying history and the Czech language in the Faculty of Education at the University of Hradec Králové, which qualified him to be a teacher, and led him to teach high school classes. Hašek also had a brand of sportswear named &quot;Dominator Clothing&quot;, which was launched shortly after the Nagano Olympics in 1998. It also had two locations in Michigan for a short time. However, sales were low, and the Dominator brand was forced out of business in 2008.
In May 2001, Hašek founded the &quot;Dominik Hašek Youth Hockey League&quot;/&quot;Hašek&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, and donated over $1 million to help underprivileged children in Buffalo play hockey.
He organized a charity hockey game in Prague in 1998, and donated the profits to hospitals in the Czech Republic.

Hašek was known to appreciate humor to keep team spirits up, and often jokes about his resemblance to Cosmo Kramer of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. In the late 1990s, he was featured in a MasterCard commercial that praised his flexibility. On 26 November 2006, Mark Parisi&#x27;s comic panel &quot;off the mark&quot; featured a comic about Hašek&#x27;s childhood.

Throughout his long career, Hašek was represented by agent Ritch Winter.

===Politics===
Hašek developed an interest in politics following his retirement from hockey, including possibly running for president of the Czech Republic in 2023 and 2028. He closely followed Czech politics throughout the 2010s before publicly speaking at the Je to na nás! rally in 2019 against Prime Minister Andrej Babiš. When Babiš visited Ivan Hlinka Stadion in Litvínov to discuss renovations to the arena, Hašek wrote on his Twitter account that he did &quot;not want the Czech national sport to be stained by your name.&quot; He supported Petr Pavel in the 2023 Czech presidential election; in 2024, Hašek opined that Pavel is &quot;doing an excellent job&quot; and praised him for his pro-Western views and domestic policy.

He was TOP 09&#x27;s nominee for the 2024 Czech Senate election, running for the 41st district in Benešov. He received 20.28 percent of the vote in the first round, the third most of the six candidates but missing the second round by less than six percent.

Hašek is a critic of American president Donald Trump, whom he has called &quot;unpredictable&quot; and linked to &quot;dictatorship, evil, and endless lies.&quot; In 2020, after Trump suggested a Buffalo man injured by police could be an &quot;ANTIFA provocateur&quot; for the George Floyd protests, Hašek called his words &quot;disgusting&quot; and accused Republicans save for Senator Mitt Romney of &quot;hiding like rats.&quot; He endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election against Trump.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Hašek advocated for the NHL and Olympics to ban Russians from playing except for those who speak out against it. When the Sabres visited Prague to play in the 2024 NHL Global Series, Hašek did not attend the games to protest the league&#x27;s inaction. He told &quot;The Athletic&quot; afterward that he wrote messages to discuss the matter but received &quot;only a brief response&quot; whereas the league &quot;made no effort to have a dialogue with him.&quot; As a result, he decreased his involvement with the NHL since he refused to &quot;be part of an event that is an advertisement for the Russian war.&quot; He has also visited Ukrainian cities following their liberation from occupation like Irpin and Bucha, and is an &quot;honorary Fella&quot; of pro-Ukrainian social media movement NAFO.

His vocal stances on the Russo-Ukrainian War have caused tension with other players and former teammates. He urged fellow Czech Libor Šulák against playing in the KHL and criticized their country&#x27;s lawmakers for not passing legislation that would prohibit Czech citizens from working in Russia. Ex-Red Wings teammate and Russian politician Viacheslav Fetisov demanded Hašek return the money he received while playing for Spartak Moscow, to which Hašek responded that Fetisov &quot;gave the green light&quot; to Russian war crimes in Ukraine. In 2024, he questioned the induction of Russian and former Red Wings teammate Pavel Datsyuk into the Hockey Hall of Fame, feeling the timing is inappropriate due to the war unless Datsyuk condemned it.

===Inline hockey game incident===
During an inline hockey game on 18 May 2003, Hašek was accused of assaulting another player. He was playing as a defender for Bonfire Střída when he crosschecked Martin Šíla. The prosecutor in the case, Lenka Strnadová, ruled two months later that there was no evidence that Hašek intended bodily harm and recommended the case be treated as a misdemeanor, punishable only by fine (US$95 maximum), rather than a felony where jail time would have been possible. Hašek&#x27;s lawyer Pavel Jelínek announced in a statement that media reports about the incident were exaggerated, with Šíla not having sustained any documented injuries. In October 2003, the country&#x27;s top prosecutor overruled Strnadová, saying her ruling was unlawful because the case had not been properly investigated. The Pardubice prosecutor&#x27;s office then investigated the case again, and reached the same decision as Strnadová.

===Milestones===
Hašek earned his 300th National Hockey League win on 15 October 2005, in a 5–1 home victory with the Ottawa Senators over the Boston Bruins. He stopped 34 of 35 shots and was holding a shutout until Bruins forward Pat Leahy jammed a loose puck under him three minutes into the third period. He became the twenty-second goaltender to reach the milestone. He is the oldest goaltender in NHL history to post a 30-win season, and in 1997, he became the second goaltender to win the Lester B. Pearson Award for most outstanding player in the league (Mike Liut won the Lester B. Pearson Trophy as the league&#x27;s MVP as determined by his peers in 1981). He is also the only goaltender to win the Hart Trophy twice for most valuable player, and was only one Vezina Trophy away from tying Jacques Plante&#x27;s record of seven.

===Records===
In nine seasons with the Buffalo Sabres, Hašek acquired over 25 franchise records, including most all-time games played, wins, shutouts and lowest goals against average. He also holds the Sabres&#x27; record for most shutouts in a single season with 13 in 1997–98, and lowest goals against average in a single season with a total of 1.87 in 1998–99. During the Detroit Red Wings&#x27; championship run in 2002, Hašek set franchise records for most games played, minutes played, wins and shutouts in a playoff year. He holds several notable NHL records:
;General
;All-time
* 1st place – Highest career save percent (.922)
* 2nd place – Most games played by a Europe-born goaltender (735)
* 6th place – Most shutouts (81)
* 7th place – Lowest goals against average (2.20)
* 11th place – Most wins (389)

;Regular season
* First European goaltender to lead the NHL in GAA (1993–94)
* First goaltender since 1974 to have a GAA below 2.00 (1993–94)
* Most shutouts in one month (six in 1997–98)

;Playoffs
;All-time
* 2nd place – Most shutouts in one season (6)
* 3rd place – Most shutouts (15)
* 10th place – Most wins (61)
One of the most impressive single-game performances by any player in NHL history came on 27 April 1994. Hašek made 70 saves in a four-overtime shutout. The opposing goaltender was Martin Brodeur, then a rookie, who made 49 saves before being beaten by Dave Hannan, and the Sabres beat New Jersey 1–0, helping them to tie the series 3–3 in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Hašek&#x27;s 70 saves set a record, which still stands, for the most saves in a game without allowing a goal.

===Influence===
In a 2023 interview, Petr Čech described Hašek as one of his major sporting idols.

<text>A hydraulic empire, also known as a hydraulic despotism, hydraulic society, hydraulic civilization, or water monopoly empire, is a social or government structure which maintains power and control through exclusive control over access to water. It arises through the need for flood control and irrigation, which requires central coordination and a specialized bureaucracy.

Often associated with these terms and concepts is the notion of a &quot;water dynasty&quot;. This body is a political structure which is commonly characterized by a system of hierarchy and control often based on class or caste. Power, both over resources (food, water, energy) and a means of enforcement such as the military, is vital for the maintenance of control.

== Civilizations ==

A developed hydraulic civilization maintains control over its population by means of controlling the supply of water. The term was coined by the German-American historian Karl August Wittfogel (1896–1988), in his book &quot;Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power&quot; (1957). Wittfogel asserted that such &quot;hydraulic civilizations&quot;, although they were not all located in the Orient or characteristic of all Oriental societies, were essentially different from those of the Western world. According to Wittfogel, most of the first civilizations in history, such as Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, Pre-Columbian Mexico and Peru, are believed to have been hydraulic empires. Most hydraulic empires existed in arid or desert regions, but imperial China also had some such characteristics, due to the exacting needs of rice cultivation.

The Maurya Empire in India was classified by Wittfogel as a grandiose hydraulic economy. Kautilya while referring to the &quot;udakabhaga&quot; (water-cess, cess being a term used in India, Scotland and Ireland for an additional tax) lists various kinds of irrigation, viz., irrigated by manual labour, by carrying water on the shoulder, by water lifts, and by raising water from lakes, rivers etc. Some scholars believe the Arthashastra makes a clear reference to canals for irrigation, in a sutra which points out that water was set in motion by digging (&quot;khatapravrittim&quot;) from a river-dam (&quot;nandinibhandayatana&quot;) or a tank.

Apart from Ancient Egypt and the Kingdom of Kush, the Ajuran Sultanate of the Horn of Africa was the only other hydraulic empire in Africa. In the 13th century, the Ajuran began to monopolize the water resources of the Jubba and Shebelle rivers. Through hydraulic engineering, they also constructed many of the state&#x27;s limestone wells and cisterns that are still in use today. Its rulers developed new systems for agriculture and taxation, which continued to be used in parts of the Horn of Africa as late as the 19th century.

==Analysis==
Wittfogel argues that climate caused some parts of the world to develop higher levels of civilization than others. He is known for claiming that climate in the Orient led to despotic rule. This environmental determinism comes to bear when considering that in those societies where the most control was exhibited, this was commonly the case due to the central role of the resource in economic processes and its environmentally limited, or constrained nature. This made controlling supply and demand easier and allowed a more complete monopoly to be established, as well as preventing the use of alternative resources to compensate.

The typical hydraulic empire government, in Wittfogel&#x27;s thesis, is extremely centralized, with no trace of an independent aristocracy – in contrast to the decentralized feudalism of medieval Europe. Though tribal societies had structures that were usually personal in nature, exercised by a patriarch over a tribal group related by various degrees of kinship, hydraulic hierarchies gave rise to the established permanent institution of impersonal government. Popular revolution in such a state was impossible: a dynasty might die out or be overthrown by force, but the new regime would differ very little from the old one. Hydraulic empires were only ever destroyed by foreign conquerors, he states.
Wittfogel&#x27;s ideas, when applied to China, have been harshly criticized by scholars such as Joseph Needham who argued essentially that Wittfogel was operating from ignorance of basic Chinese history. Needham argued that the Chinese government was not despotic, was not dominated by a priesthood, had many peasant rebellions, and that Wittfogel&#x27;s perspective does not address the necessity and presence of bureaucracy in modern Western civilization. Robert L. Carneiro was also critical of Wittfogel&#x27;s theory, writing in &quot;Science&quot; in August 1970: &quot;This theory has recently run into difficulties. Archeological evidence now makes it appear that in at least three of the areas that Wittfogel cites as exemplifying his &quot;hydraulic hypothesis&quot;—Mesopotamia, China, and Mexico—full-fledged states developed well before large-scale irrigation&quot;. With regard to Mesopotamia, Carneiro cited Robert McCormick Adams, Jr., who had concluded: &quot;In short, there is nothing to suggest that the rise of dynastic authority in southern Mesopotamia was linked to the administrative requirements of a major canal system.&quot; On China, which Carneiro called &quot;the prototypical area for Wittfogel&#x27;s hydraulic theories&quot;, he quoted Jacques Gernet who had recently written: “although the establishment of a system of regulation of water courses and irrigation, and the control of this system, may have affected the political constitution of the military states and imperial China, the fact remains that, historically, it was the pre-existing state structures and the large, well-trained labour force provided by the armies that made the great irrigation projects possible”. Turning to Mexico, Carneiro wrote: “large-scale irrigation systems do not appear to antedate the Classic period, whereas it is clear that the first states arose in the preceding Formative or Pre-Classic period”. Of hydraulic empires generally, Carneiro commented: &quot;This is not to say, of course, that large-scale irrigation, where it occurred, did not contribute significantly to increasing the power and scope of the state. It unquestionably did. To the extent that Wittfogel limits himself to this contention, I have no quarrel with him whatever. However, the point at issue is not how the state increased its power but how it arose in the first place. And to this issue the hydraulic hypothesis does not appear to hold the key.&quot;

The same elements of resource control central to hydraulic empire were also central to Europe&#x27;s colonization of much of the global South. Colonies were resource rich areas located on the periphery, and the contemporary models of core-periphery interaction were focused on the extraction and control of these resources for the use of the core. This was accomplished through a type of agro-managerial despotism with close connections to debates around hydraulic empire.

<text>A water beetle is a generalized name for any beetle that is adapted to living in water at any point in its life cycle. Most water beetles can only live in fresh water, with a few marine species that live in the intertidal zone or littoral zone. There are approximately 2000 species of true water beetles native to lands throughout the world.

Many water beetles carry an air bubble, called the elytra cavity, underneath their abdomens, which provides an air supply, and prevents water from getting into the spiracles. Others have the surface of their exoskeleton modified to form a plastron, or &quot;physical gill&quot;, which permits direct gas exchange with the water. Some families of water beetles have fringed hind legs adapted for swimming, but most do not. Most families of water beetles have larvae that are also aquatic; many have aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults.

==Diet==
Water beetles can be either herbivores, predators, or scavengers. Herbivorous beetles eat only aquatic vegetation, such as algae or leaves. They might also suck juices out the stem of a plant nearby. Scavenger beetles will feed on decomposing organic material that has been deposited. The scavenged material can come from aquatic vegetation, feces, or other small organisms that have died. The great diving beetle, a predator, feeds on things like worms, tadpoles, and even sometimes small fish.

==Species==
Families in which all species are aquatic in all life stages include: 
*Dytiscidae 
*Gyrinidae (Whirligig beetles)
*Haliplidae 
*Noteridae 
*Amphizoidae
*Hygrobiidae (Squeak beetles)
*Meruidae
*Hydroscaphidae (Skiff beetles). 

Families in which the adults are not necessarily aquatic include:
*Hydrophilidae
*Lutrochidae (Travertine beetles)
*Dryopidae
*Elmidae
*Eulichadidae
*Heteroceridae
*Limnichidae
*Psephenidae (Water-penny beetles)
*Ptilodactylidae
*Torridincolidae
*Sphaeriusidae

<doc id="423685" wikidata="Q4249647" url="?curid=423685" title="Essie Mae Washington-Williams">
<text>Essie Mae Washington-Williams ( Butler; October 12, 1925 – February 4, 2013) was an American teacher and author. She was the eldest child of Strom Thurmond, Governor of South Carolina and longtime United States senator known for his pro-segregation politics. Of mixed race, she was born to Carrie Butler, a 16-year-old African-American girl who worked as a domestic servant for Thurmond&#x27;s parents, and Thurmond, then 22 and unmarried. Essie Mae grew up in the family of one of her mother&#x27;s sisters, not learning of her biological parents until 1938 when her mother came for a visit and informed Essie Mae she was her mother. She graduated from college, earned a master&#x27;s degree, married, raised a family, and had a 30-year professional career in education.

Washington-Williams did not reveal her father&#x27;s identity until she was almost 78 years old, after Thurmond&#x27;s death at the age of 100 in 2003. Though he had little to do with her upbringing, he had paid for her college education and took an interest in her and her family all his life. In 2005, she published her autobiography, &quot;Dear Senator: A Memoir by the Daughter of Strom Thurmond&quot;, which was nominated for the National Book Award and a Pulitzer Prize.

==Early life==
Essie Mae was the daughter of Carrie Butler, who was 15 or 16 when her daughter was born, and Strom Thurmond, then 22. Carrie Butler worked as a domestic servant for Thurmond&#x27;s parents. Butler sent her daughter from South Carolina to her older sister Mary and her husband John Henry Washington to be raised in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. The girl was named Essie after another of Carrie&#x27;s sisters, who fostered her briefly as an infant. Essie Mae grew up with her cousin, seven years older than she, who she believed was her half-brother. She was unaware of the identity of her biological parents until 1938, when she was 13 and her mother told her the full story. In 1941, her mother took her to meet Thurmond in person.

Essie Mae and her mother met infrequently with Thurmond after that, although they had some contact for years. After high school, she worked as a nurse at Harlem Hospital in New York City, and took a course in business education at New York University.

She did not visit the segregated South until 1942, when she met relatives in Edgefield. After having grown up in Pennsylvania, she was shocked by the racial restrictions of the South. She returned to the North to live with relatives during the war years. After Thurmond returned from World War II, she started college at the all-black South Carolina State College (SCSC) in the fall of 1947. Thurmond quietly paid for her college education. She met and married future lawyer Julius Williams at SCSC in 1948. Her first child, Julius Williams Jr., was born in 1949. As a result, Essie Mae dropped out of college in the summer of 1949 to begin raising the first of her four children.

==Career==
During the late 1950s and 1960s, the years of national activism in the civil rights movement, Washington occasionally tried to discuss racism with Thurmond, who was known for his long-time political support for segregation, but he brushed off her complaints about segregated facilities. Nevertheless, Washington felt that she made a significant impact on Thurmond during their private conversations on race and race relations and that Thurmond&#x27;s policies towards African Americans were affected as a result. In 1976, for example, Thurmond nominated Matthew J. Perry, whom Essie Mae dated in 1947 shortly before she met her husband, to the U.S. Court of Military Appeals. Thurmond became the first Southern senator to nominate an African American for a federal judgeship.

Following the death of her husband in 1964, Washington moved again, to Los Angeles, California, where she completed her undergraduate studies to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree from California State University, Los Angeles in 1969 and earned a master&#x27;s degree in education at the University of Southern California, She had a 30-year career as a teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District from 1967 through 1997. Washington was a longtime member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, which she joined while at South Carolina State.

==Personal life==
In 1949, Washington left college before her junior year after marrying Julius T. Williams, a law student at SCSC, the previous year. After his graduation from law school, they moved to his home town, Savannah, Georgia, where he established a law practice and was active in the NAACP. They had two sons and two daughters together. He died in 1964. Three children live in the Seattle, Washington, area, and one daughter lives near Los Angeles. At the time of her death, Washington-Williams had 14 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren.

In 2004, Washington-Williams said that she intended to be active on behalf of the Black Patriots Foundation, which was raising funds to build a monument on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to honor American blacks who served in the Revolutionary War. This organization became defunct the following year. Another group is now raising funds for the monument.

In 2004, Washington-Williams applied for membership in the United Daughters of the Confederacy based on her heritage through Thurmond to ancestors who fought as Confederate soldiers. She died before being accepted. She also intended to join the Daughters of the American Revolution.

Washington-Williams was a Congregationalist.

==Death==
Washington-Williams died February 4, 2013, in Columbia, South Carolina, at age 87.

==Legacy and honors==

When Washington-Williams announced her family connection, it was acknowledged by the Thurmond family. In 2004, the state legislature approved the addition of her name to the list of Thurmond children on a monument for Senator Thurmond on the South Carolina Statehouse grounds.

In 2005, Washington-Williams was awarded an honorary Doctorate in education from South Carolina State University at Orangeburg when she was invited to speak at their commencement ceremony.

She published a memoir, &quot;Dear Senator: A Memoir by the Daughter of Strom Thurmond&quot; (2005), written with William Stadiem. It explored her sense of dislocation based on her mixed heritage, as well as going to college in the segregated South after having grown up in Pennsylvania. It was nominated for both a National Book Award and a Pulitzer Prize.

<doc id="423689" wikidata="Q290253" url="?curid=423689" title="Curses (programming library)">
<text>curses is a terminal control library for Unix-like systems, enabling the construction of text user interface (TUI) applications.

The name is a pun on the term &quot;cursor optimization&quot;. It is a library of functions that manage an application&#x27;s display on character-cell terminals (e.g., VT100).

ncurses is the approved replacement for 4.4BSD classic curses.

== Overview ==
Using curses, programmers are able to write text-based applications without writing directly for any specific terminal type. The curses library on the executing system sends the correct control characters based on the terminal type. It provides an abstraction of one or more windows that maps onto the terminal screen. Each window is represented by a character matrix. The programmer sets up the desired appearance of each window, then tells the curses package to update the screen. The library determines a minimal set of changes that are needed to update the display and then executes these using the terminal&#x27;s specific capabilities and control sequences.

In short, this means that the programmer creates a character matrix of how the screen should look and lets curses handle the work.

The curses API is described in several places. Most implementations of curses use a database that can describe the capabilities of thousands of different terminals. There are a few implementations, such as PDCurses, which use specialized device drivers rather than a terminal database. Most implementations use terminfo; some use termcap. Curses has the advantage of back-portability to character-cell terminals and simplicity. For an application that does not require bit-mapped graphics or multiple fonts, an interface implementation using curses will usually be much simpler and faster than one using an X toolkit.

== History ==
The first curses library was written by Ken Arnold and originally released with BSD UNIX, where it was used for several games, most notably &quot;Rogue&quot;. Some improvements were made to the BSD library in the 1990s as &quot;4.4BSD&quot; curses, e.g., to provide more than one type of video highlighting. However, those are not widely used.

The name &quot;curses&quot; is a pun on &quot;cursor optimization&quot;. Sometimes it is incorrectly stated that curses was used by the vi editor. In fact the code in curses that optimizes moving the cursor was borrowed from vi, which predated curses.

According to Goodheart, Ken Arnold&#x27;s original implementation of curses started by reusing functions from the termcap library, and adding to that. A few years later, Mary Ann Horton, who had maintained the vi and termcap sources at Berkeley, went to AT&amp;T Corporation and made a different version using terminfo, which became part of UNIX System III and UNIX System V. Due to licensing restrictions on the latter, the BSD and AT&amp;T versions of the library were developed independently. In addition to the termcap/terminfo improvement, other improvements were made in the AT&amp;T version:
; video highlighting (bold, underline): The BSD version supported only &quot;standout&quot;.
; line-drawing: The BSD version gave little support here.
; colors: This was not supported in the BSD version.

AT&amp;T curses development appears to have halted in the mid-1990s when X/Open Curses was defined. In 1995, BSD maintainer, Keith Bostic, officially deprecated the curses library in favor of ncurses. Development of ncurses and PDCurses continues. A version of BSD curses continues to be maintained in the NetBSD operating system (wide character support, termcap to terminfo migration, etc.).

=== pcurses and PDCurses ===

Different lines of development started by imitating the AT&amp;T curses, from at least three implementations: pcurses by Pavel Curtis (started in 1982), PDCurses (Public Domain curses) by Mark Hessling to support his editor THE (started in 1987) as well as Rexx/Curses, and PC curses (version 1.4 and earlier by Björn Larsson-based inspired by Pavel Curtis&#x27; library before 1990).

=== ncurses ===

ncurses (new curses) &quot;originated as pcurses... and was re-issued as ncurses 1.8.1 in late 1993&quot;. ncurses is the most widely known implementation of curses, and has motivated further development of other variations, such as BSD curses in the NetBSD project.

== Portability ==
Although the ncurses library was initially developed under Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and NetBSD, it has been ported to many other ANSI/POSIX UNIX systems, mainly by Thomas Dickey. PDCurses, while not identical to ncurses, uses the same function calls and operates the same way as ncurses does except that PDCurses targets different devices, e.g., console windows for DOS, Win32, OS/2, as well as X11. Porting between the two is not difficult. For example, the roguelike game &quot;ADOM&quot; was written for Linux and ncurses, later ported to DOS and PDCurses.

== Screenshots ==

==Applications==

Curses is designed to facilitate GUI-like functionality on a text-only device, such as a PC running in console mode, a hardware ANSI terminal, a Telnet or SSH client, or similar. Curses-based software is software whose user interface is implemented through the curses library, or a compatible library (such as ncurses).

Curses-based programs often have a user interface that resembles a traditional graphical user interface, including &#x27;widgets&#x27; such as text boxes and scrollable lists, rather than the command line interface (CLI) most commonly found on text-only devices. This can make them more user-friendly than a CLI-based program, while still being able to run on text-only devices. Curses-based software can also have a lighter resource footprint and operate on a wider range of systems (both in terms of hardware and software) than their GUI-based counterparts. This includes old pre-1990 machines along with modern embedded systems using text-only displays.

Curses is most commonly associated with Unix-like operating systems, although implementations for Microsoft Windows also exist.

<doc id="423693" wikidata="Q1724194" url="?curid=423693" title="Cremaster muscle">
<text>The cremaster muscle is a paired structure made of thin layers of striated and smooth muscle that covers the testicles and the spermatic cords in human males. It consists of the lateral and medial parts. Cremaster is an involuntary muscle, responsible for the cremasteric reflex; a protective and physiologic superficial reflex of the testicles. The reflex raises and lowers the testicles in order to keep them protected. Along with the dartos muscle of the scrotum, it regulates testicular temperature, thus aiding the process of spermatogenesis.

==Structure==
In human males, the cremaster muscle is a thin layer of striated muscle found in the inguinal canal and scrotum between the external and internal layers of spermatic fascia, surrounding the testis and spermatic cord. The cremaster muscle is a paired structure, there being one on each side of the body.

Anatomically, the lateral cremaster muscle originates from the internal oblique muscle, just superior to the inguinal canal, and the middle of the inguinal ligament. The medial cremaster muscle, which sometimes is absent, originates from the pubic tubercle and sometimes the lateral pubic crest. Both insert into the tunica vaginalis underneath the testis.

===Blood supply===
The cremaster muscle is supplied by the cremasteric artery, a branch of the inferior epigastric artery, along with anastomotic flow from the other arteries supplying the scrotum.

===Nerve supply===
The cremaster muscle is innervated from the sensory and motor fibers of the genitofemoral nerve that originates from the L1 and L2 spinal nerve nuclei. It receives distinctly different innervation and vascular supply in comparison to the internal oblique.

===Development===
The cremaster muscle develops to its full extent only in males; in females, the muscle is smaller and is found on the round ligament, where it is represented by only a few muscle loops.

In rats, it has been shown that cremaster muscles developed from the gubernacular bulb.

==Function==

===Retraction===

The cremaster muscle&#x27;s function is to raise and lower the testes in order to regulate scrotal temperature for optimal spermatogenesis and survival of the resultant spermatozoa. The ideal temperature for human sperm development is around 34 degrees Celsius, which is about 4 degrees Celsius below body temperature. Temperature is regulated by increasing or decreasing the exposed surface area of the surrounding tissue, allowing faster or slower dissipation of body heat. The amount of retraction or relaxation is directly related to how far the environmental temperatures are from the ideal. Cremaster works alongside the dartos muscle in order to maintain homeostasis for the reproductive organs and protect them from physical damage. When a man is cold or sexually stimulated, the dartos muscle causes the scrotum to become more wrinkled and smaller as it is retracted closer to the body. In warmer conditions, the dartos allows for less wrinkling and the scrotum becomes looser.

The cremaster muscle is an involuntary muscle and contraction can occur during arousal which can prevent injury to the testicles during sexual intercourse. Contraction also occurs during orgasm and ejaculation. The muscle may contract during moments of extreme fear, possibly to help avoid injuring the testes while dealing with a fight or flight situation.

Clinically, a reflex arc termed the cremasteric reflex can be demonstrated by lightly stroking the skin of the inner thigh downwards from the hip towards the knee. This stimulates the sensory fibers of the ilioinguinal nerve, which enters the spinal cord at L1. The sensory fibers stimulate the motor fibers of the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve (also at spinal level L1), which provides innervation to the cremaster muscles causing the contraction of the muscle and elevation of the testes. This causes the cremaster muscle on the same side to rapidly contract, raising the testicle.

The cremaster can also be contracted voluntarily, by performing Kegels (which somehow contracts the cremaster), or by flexing and tightening the abdominal muscles.

==Clinical significance==
The cremaster muscle occasionally experiences painful spasms or cramps in adult males which can be chronic and debilitating. Treatment for these spasms ranges from minor surgery to injection with Botulinum A toxin to the regular application of heat to relax the muscle. Surgery, including the excision of the cremaster muscle, has apparently been able to provide complete relief from this condition without significant side effects.

==Etymology==
The name of the cremaster muscle is derived from the Ancient Greek noun (&quot;kremastḗr&quot;), meaning &quot;suspender&quot;; its plural, (&quot;kremastēres&quot;), was used by Galen in the sense of &quot;cremaster muscle&quot;.

<doc id="423699" wikidata="Q1625473" url="?curid=423699" title="Wood fibre">
<text>Wood fibres (also spelled wood fibers, see spelling differences) are usually cellulosic elements that are extracted from trees and used to make materials including paper.

The end paper product (paper, paperboard, tissue, cardboard, etc.) dictates the species, or species blend, that is best suited to provide the desirable sheet characteristics, and also dictates the required fibre processing (chemical treatment, heat treatment, mechanical &quot;brushing&quot; or refining, etc.).

In North America, virgin (non-recycled) wood fibre is primarily extracted from hardwood (deciduous) trees and softwood (coniferous) trees. The wood fibre can be extracted as a primary product, or collected during the milling of lumber. Wood fibres can also be recycled from used paper materials.

==Paper==
Wood fibres are treated by combining them with other additives which break down the fibres into a spongy mass called pulp. The pulp is then processed, and the network of tiny fibres is pressed flat, becoming paper.

==Construction material==
Wood fibres can be pressed into various types of flat boards, used as insulation, renderboard and sarking. Densities vary from 60Kg/m3 insulation boards to 180Kg/m3 render boards. Some types of woodfibre are flexible, others very rigid. Flexible insulation is designed to be friction-installed between timbers or fitted on top of somewhat irregular surfaces

There are manufacturers in Poland (Beltermo, Steico), Germany (Gutex, Steico HQ), France (Pavatex) and Norway (Hunton)..

There are two different manufacturing processes: wet and dry.

In the wet-process, chipped, waste timber is ground up into small pieces then boiled up with water and a few other chemicals designed to break down the timber into the fibres. During this process, many of the sugars which are of interest to fungus and mould are removed. This slurry is then poured on to a belt sieve and compressed to remove as much water as possible and heated with steam to bond the fibres together. The steaming process softens the natural lignin around the fibres which holds the fibres together in the board, which is typically manufactured to around 20mm thickness. These boards are then laminated up with a water based glue into thicker layers to produce boards up to around 120mm thick.

In the dry-process waste timber is dried and ground up into fibres, then mixed with a synthetic glue called PMDI (polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate) is a polyurethane based glue which is used in fairly small quantities (3-4% by mass). This is essentially the same glue use in OSB and MDF. The mixture is then laid on a conveyor belt and compressed to the correct thickness and density, then steam is applied to cure the boards. These boards are made to the desired thickness and are not usually laminated.

Wet-process boards are typically denser and have much stronger capilliary action to move water around. The dry process consumes less energy.

==Hydroculture==
Wood fibres can be used as a substrate in hydroponics. Wood wool (i.e. wood slivers) have been a substrate of choice since the earliest days of the hydroponics research. However, more recent research suggests that wood fibre can have detrimental effects on &quot;plant growth regulators&quot;.

==Composites==
Wood fibres can be combined with thermoplastics to create strong, waterproof products for outdoor use, such as deck boards or outdoor furniture.

<text>Lymm ( ) is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Warrington, Cheshire, England. It incorporates the hamlets of Booths Hill, Broomedge, Church Green, Deansgreen, Heatley, Heatley Heath, Little Heatley, Oughtrington, Reddish, Rushgreen and Statham. At the 2021 United Kingdom census, the parish had a population of 12,660 and the built up area had a population of 11,545. The village borders Greater Manchester to the east, 1 mile from Salford to the north.

== History ==
The name Lymm, of Celtic origins, means a &quot;place of running water&quot; and is likely derived from an ancient stream that ran through the village centre. The village appears as &quot;Limme&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086.

Lymm was an agricultural village until the Industrial Revolution, which brought the Bridgewater Canal and the Warrington and Altrincham Junction Railway to the village. The village played a prominent role within the salt extraction industry, gold beating industry and cotton industry (many of its inhabitants were fustian cutters).

In 2017, Lymm was voted as one of the Best Places to Live by &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; list. In 2023, the village was voted as one of Britain&#x27;s Most Desirable Towns by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, and third Most Desirable place to live in Northern England by the &quot;Telegraph&quot;.

== Governance ==
There are two tiers of local government covering Lymm, at civil parish and unitary authority level: Lymm Parish Council and Warrington Borough Council. The parish council is based at the Village Hall on Pepper Street. For national elections, Lymm forms part of the Tatton constituency.

===Administrative history===
Lymm was an ancient parish in the Bucklow Hundred of Cheshire.
The parish was made a local government district in 1863, administered by an elected local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Lymm Urban District Council subsequently built itself offices at the corner of Whitbarrow Road and Brookfield Road, which were completed in 1902.

Lymm Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Borough of Warrington. A successor parish called Lymm was created in 1974 covering the area of the former urban district. District-level functions passed to Warrington Borough Council, which became a unitary authority in 1998 when it also took over county-level services within the borough from Cheshire County Council.

== Education ==

Lymm High School accepts students from Lymm and the surrounding villages and hamlets. It was judged as &#x27;Good&#x27; in its 2024 Ofsted inspection with the sixth form provision being judged as ‘Outstanding’. In December 2023 and 2024 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; ranked the school as one of the top five secondary schools in the North West and one of the top secondary schools in the Warrington area.

Lymm is also in the catchment for Altrincham Grammar School for Boys and Altrincham Grammar School for Girls.

There are four primary schools within Lymm. The following three primary schools formed as an Academy by the Beam Education Trust in May 2021:

* Oughtrington Primary School (Ofsted rating &#x27;Outstanding&#x27;, 2020)
* Ravenbank Community Primary School (Ofsted rating &#x27;Good&#x27;, 2023)
* Statham Primary School (Ofsted rating &#x27;Good&#x27;, 2023)

The fourth primary school is Cherry Tree Primary School, located in the southern part of Lymm, and was rated as &#x27;Good&#x27; at its last Ofsted inspection in 2024.

The Manchester Japanese School (マンチェスター日本人補習授業校 &quot;Manchesutā Nihonjin Hoshū Jugyō Kō&quot;), a weekend Japanese educational programme, is held at the Language Centre at Lymm High School.

== Culture and heritage ==
Lymm Heritage Centre, which opened in June 2017, is in the centre of the village on Legh Street. It hosts exhibitions related to local history as well as activities for schools and visitors.

Morris dancing was taking place in Lymm as early as 1817, often appearing in the village at Rushbearing time throughout the Victorian era. Morris dancing continues to feature within the village with Lymm Morris dancers frequently performing during Rushbearing and at the various annual village festivals including the Lymm May Queen Festival, Lymm Festival and Lymm Dickensian Festival.

Lymm is twinned with Meung-sur-Loire, an ancient village and commune near Orléans, France.

== Landmarks ==

Lymm village centre is a designated conservation area, notable for its historic buildings, both listed and unlisted including the French-style terracotta former town hall, St Peter&#x27;s Church and Lymm Hall. Another is Oughtrington Hall and Lodge (formerly owned by a cadet branch of the Leigh family) this is now Lymm High School. Foxley Hall, home to a cadet branch of the ancient Booth family before ownership passed to the Carlisle family, is no longer standing, but fustian-cutting cottages on Church Road and Arley Grove do survive.

The parish church of St Peter, Oughtrington, is an example of Gothic Revival architecture. St Mary&#x27;s Church, Lymm, overlooking Lymm Dam and dating back to 1521, was rebuilt in the 19th century after falling into disrepair. Lymm Baptist Church was built in 1850 and an attached Sunday school was built in 1851.

Lymm Cross, usually known simply as &quot;the Cross&quot;, is a Grade I listed structure dating from the 17th century, restored in 1897.

A “dinosaur” (reptile) footprint was discovered in the Victorian era, in one of Lymm&#x27;s many quarries, which is thought to be from the Triassic period. It is on display in the centre of the village.

Spud Wood is a recreational area, located next to the Bridgewater Canal, managed by the Woodland Trust. In 2014 the community was granted a licence to run a wood allotment scheme where local residents can coppice and fell wood. There is also a community orchard located in grounds behind Oughtrington Community Centre – run by the same local group.

== Transport ==
The M56 (junctions 7, 8 and 9) and M6 (junction 19 and 20) motorways are both within of Lymm. The conjunction of these motorways with the A50 is known as the Lymm Interchange, and hosts a service station known as the Poplar 2000 services, a well-used truck stop. The A56 also passes just south of the village, connecting the nearby towns of Warrington and Altrincham. The CAT5/5A buses to Lymm from Warrington and Altrincham are frequent on weekdays and Saturdays.

Lymm Historic Transport Day is an annual summer festival celebrating various modes of transport, from canal boats to vintage vehicles, which takes place in the village on the May Queen field.

=== Waterways ===
The Bridgewater Canal passes through the centre of Lymm. The Manchester Ship Canal passes to the north, and beyond its route lies the River Mersey. To the east of Lymm the River Bollin flows along the village&#x27;s border with Warburton and the borough of Trafford. A number of small brooks feed the popular tourist attraction of Lymm Dam, built in 1824 to enable the construction of the Stockport–Warrington Road (now known as the A56).

=== Railways ===

Lymm railway station was on Whitbarrow Road. It opened on 1 November 1853 as part of the Warrington and Altrincham Junction railway. There was a further station at Heatley, on Mill Lane, for salt and lead. To the east, the track ran via Dunham into Broadheath and the Manchester network. To the west, the track used to run into Warrington, via Latchford, and the tar processing on Loushers Lane, then into Bank Quay Low Level.

The line closed to passengers on 10 September 1962; it was officially closed to all types of traffic on 7 July 1985, but lasted a few months. Then it became financially unviable, and the tracks and sleepers were rapidly lifted. Lymm today has no railway station; the closest stations are at Glazebrook, Birchwood, Warrington, Knutsford and Altrincham.

=== Cycleways ===
Today the old Railway through Lymm forms a good stretch of the Trans Pennine Trail, with a ranger station at Statham, near the centre of the village. In 2022, upgrade work to certain sections of the trail commenced to provide updated all weather surfaces for users.

<doc id="423724" wikidata="Q15680" url="?curid=423724" title="Yurt">
<text>A yurt (from the Turkic languages) or ger (Mongolian) is a portable, round tent covered and insulated with skins or felt and traditionally used as a dwelling by several distinct nomadic groups in the steppes and mountains of Inner Asia. The structure consists of a flexible angled assembly or latticework of wood or bamboo for walls, a door frame, ribs (poles, rafters), and a wheel (crown, compression ring) possibly steam-bent as a roof. The roof structure is sometimes self-supporting, but large yurts may have interior posts or columns supporting the crown. The top of the wall of self-supporting yurts is prevented from spreading by means of a tension band which opposes the force of the roof ribs. Yurts take between 30 minutes and 3 hours to set up or take down, and are generally used by between five and 15 people. Nomadic farming with yurts as housing has been the primary life style in Central Asia, particularly Mongolia, for thousands of years.

Modern yurts may be permanently built on a wooden or concrete platform; they may use modern materials such as metal framing, plastics, plexiglass dome, or radiant insulation.

== Etymology ==

The Old Turkic &quot;yurt&quot; () may have been derived from the Old Turkic word &quot;ur&quot;—a verb with the suffix +Ut. In modern Turkish and Uzbek, the word &quot;yurt&quot; is used as the synonym for &#x27;homeland&#x27; or a &#x27;dormitory&#x27;, while in modern Azerbaijani, &quot;yurd&quot; mainly signifies &#x27;homeland&#x27; or &#x27;motherland&#x27;. In Russian, the structure is called &quot;yurta&quot; (юрта), whence the word came into English.

== History ==
Yurts have been a distinctive feature of life in Central Asia for at least two and a half thousand years. The first written description of a yurt used as a dwelling was recorded by the ancient Greek historian Herodotus. He described yurt-like tents as the dwelling place of the Scythians, a horse riding-nomadic nation who lived in the northern Black Sea and Central Asian region from around 600 BC to AD 300.

===Yurts beyond Central Asia===
As popularity grew, it extended beyond Central Asia. In the 13th century, during the height of the Mongol Empire, yurts were introduced to parts of Europe and the Middle East. Marco Polo&#x27;s writings even mentioned the use of yurts in the court of Kublai Khan. In more recent history, yurts have gained attention in the West for their unique aesthetics and practicality.

== Construction ==

Traditional yurts consist of an expanding wooden circular frame carrying a felt cover. The felt is made from the wool of the flocks of sheep that accompany the pastoralists. The timber to make the external structure is not to be found on the treeless steppes, and must be obtained by trade in the valleys below.

The frame consists of one or more expanding lattice wall-sections, a door frame, bent roof poles, and a crown. The Mongolian ger has one or more columns to support the crown and straight roof poles. The (self-supporting) wood frame is covered with pieces of felt. Depending on availability, felt is additionally covered with canvas and/or sun covers. The frame is held together with one or more ropes or ribbons. The structure is kept under compression by the weight of the covers, sometimes supplemented by a heavy weight hung from the center of the roof. They vary in size and relative weight. They provide a large amount of insulation and protection from the outside cold of winters, and they are easily changed to keep the yurts cool for summertime.

A yurt is designed to be dismantled and the parts are carried compactly on camels or yaks to be rebuilt on another site. Complete construction takes around 2 hours.

== Insulation and decoration, symbolism ==
The traditional insulation and decoration within a yurt primarily consists of pattern-based woollen felted rugs. These patterns are generally not according to taste, but are derived from sacred ornaments with certain symbolism. Symbols representing strength are, for instance, the temdeg or khas (swastika), the four powerful beasts (lion, tiger, garuda – a kind of avian, and dragon), as well as stylized representations of the four elements (fire, water, earth, and air), considered to be the fundamental, unchanging elements of the cosmos. Such patterns are commonly used in the home with the belief that they will bring strength and offer protection.

Repeating geometric patterns are also widely used, like the continuous hammer or walking pattern (alkhan khee). Commonly used as a border decoration, it represents unending strength and constant movement. Another common pattern is the ulzii, a symbol of long life and happiness. The khamar ugalz (nose pattern) and ever ugalz (horn pattern) are derived from the shape of the animal&#x27;s nose and horns, and are the oldest traditional patterns. All patterns can be found among not only the yurts themselves, but also on embroidery, furniture, books, clothing, doors, and other objects.

In Kyrgyz felted rug manufacturing the most common patterns are the Ala kiyiz and Shyrdak. Ornaments are visualising good wishes or blessings of the makers to a daughter who gets married, to children, or grandchildren.

=== In Central Asia ===
The &quot;shangyrak&quot; or wooden crown of the yurt (, ; ; ; ) is itself emblematic in many Central Asian cultures. In old Kazakh communities, the yurt itself would often be repaired and rebuilt, but the shangyrak would remain intact, passed from father to son upon the father&#x27;s death. A family&#x27;s length of heritage could be measured by the accumulation of stains on the shangyrak from decades of smoke passing through it. A stylized version of the crown is in the center of the coat of arms of Kazakhstan, and forms the main image on the flag of Kyrgyzstan.

Today a yurt is seen as a national symbol among many Central Asian groups, and as such, yurts may be used as cafés (especially those specializing in traditional food), museums (especially those relating to national culture), and souvenir shops. In celebration of the city of Mary&#x27;s year as Cultural Capital of the Turkic World, the government of Turkmenistan constructed a yurt-shaped structure, called Ak Öýi (White Building) and described as &quot;The World&#x27;s Largest Yurt&quot;, of concrete, granite, aluminum, and glass. Established on November 27, 2015, the structure is 35 meters high and 70 meters in diameter. According to the Turkmenistan state news agency, &quot;A white yurt is a symbol of an age-old, distinctive historical-cultural legacy, a sign of preservation of our roots and origins.&quot; This three-story structure includes a café, offices, and VIP apartments ,as well as a large auditorium with 3,000 seats.

=== Buddhism in Mongolia ===

The design of the Mongolian ger developed from its ancient simple forms to actively integrate with Buddhist culture. The crown—toono adopted the shape of Dharmachakra. The earlier style of toono, nowadays more readily found in Central Asian yurts, is called in Mongolia &quot;sarkhinag toono,&quot; while the toono representing Buddhist dharmachakra is called &quot;khorlo&quot; (Tibetan འཀོར་ལོ།) toono. Also the shapes, colors, and ornaments of the wooden elements—toono, pillars, and poles of the Mongolian yurt—are in accord with the artistic style found in Buddhist monasteries in Mongolia. Such yurts are called &quot;uyangiin ger&quot;, literally meaning &quot;home of lyrics&quot; or &quot;home of melodies&quot;.

== Westernization ==

Enthusiasts in other countries have adapted the visual idea of the yurt, a round, semi-permanent tent. Although those structures may be copied to some extent from the originals found in Central Asia, they often have some different features and structures in their design to adapt them to different climate and uses.

In Canada and the United States, yurts are often made using hi-tech materials. They can be highly engineered and built for extreme weather conditions. In addition, erecting one can take days and it may not be intended to be frequently moved. Such North American yurts are better thought of as yurt derivations, as they are no longer round felt homes that are easy to mount, dismount, and transport. North American yurts and yurt derivations were pioneered by William Coperthwaite in the 1960s, after he was inspired to build them by a &quot;National Geographic&quot; article about Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas&#x27;s visit to Mongolia.

In 1978, American company Pacific Yurts became the first to manufacture yurts using architectural fabrics and structural engineering, paving the way for yurts to become popular attractions at ski resorts and campgrounds. Yurts are also popular in Northern Canada. In 1993, Oregon became the first state to incorporate yurts into its Parks Department as year-round camping facilities. Since then, at least 17 other US States have introduced yurt camping into their own parks departments.

In Europe, a closer approximation to the Mongolian and Central Asian yurt is in production in several countries. These tents use local hardwood, and often are made for a wetter climate with steeper roof profiles and waterproof canvas. In essence they are yurts, but some lack the felt cover and ornate features across the exterior that is present in traditional yurt. There are UK-made yurts that feature a metal frame in use in at least two glamping sites in Somerset and Dorset.

The palloza is a traditional building found in the Serra dos Ancares in Galicia (NW Spain). Pallozas have stone walls and a conical roof made of stalks of rye.

Different groups and individuals use yurts for a variety of purposes, from full-time housing to school rooms. In some provincial parks in Canada, and state parks in several US states, permanent yurts are available for camping.

Since the late 1920s the German youth and Scouting movements have adapted a variant of the yurt and the Sami Lavvu (Kohte), calling them &quot;Schwarzzelt&quot; (black tent), a term mainly used for tents from North Africa.

<text>Japan Transocean Air (JTA) is an airline based in Naha, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. It operates domestic services on behalf of Japan Airlines. Its main base is Naha Airport. From 1967 until 1993, the airline was known as &quot;Southwest Air Lines&quot;.

== History ==


The airline was established on 20 June 1967 as , and started operations in July 1967. It changed its name in July 1993. It had 814 employees (in March 2023) and is owned by Japan Airlines (51.1%), Naha Airport Terminal (17%), Okinawa Prefecture (12.9%) and others (19.1%) It flew Convair 240s until new capital from JAL allowed it to upgrade to NAMC YS-11s, and eventually Boeing 737s. JTA occasionally lends aircraft to JAL in the event of equipment failure. JTA also provides maintenance services for JAL Group Boeing 737-400 aircraft. JTA owns 74.5% of Ryukyu Air Commuter. At one time the head office of Southwest Air Lines was at &quot;306-1 Kagamizu&quot; in Naha.

<doc id="423727" wikidata="Q316748" url="?curid=423727" title="Scientific consensus">
<text>Scientific consensus is the generally held judgment, position, and opinion of the majority or the supermajority of scientists in a particular field of study at any particular time.

Consensus is achieved through scholarly communication at conferences, the publication process, replication of reproducible results by others, scholarly debate, and peer review. A conference meant to create a consensus is termed as a consensus conference. Such measures lead to a situation in which those within the discipline can often recognize such a consensus where it exists; however, communicating to outsiders that consensus has been reached can be difficult, because the &quot;normal&quot; debates through which science progresses may appear to outsiders as contestation. On occasion, scientific institutes issue position statements intended to communicate a summary of the science from the &quot;inside&quot; to the &quot;outside&quot; of the scientific community, or consensus review articles or surveys may be published. In cases where there is little controversy regarding the subject under study, establishing the consensus can be quite straightforward.

Popular or political debate on subjects that are controversial within the public sphere but not necessarily controversial within the scientific community may invoke scientific consensus: note such topics as evolution, climate change, the safety of genetically modified organisms, or the lack of a link between MMR vaccinations and autism.

== Change of consensus over time ==

There are many philosophical and historical theories as to how scientific consensus changes over time. Because the history of scientific change is extremely complicated, and because there is a tendency to project &quot;winners&quot; and &quot;losers&quot; onto the past in relation to the &quot;current&quot; scientific consensus, it is very difficult to come up with accurate and rigorous models for scientific change. This is made exceedingly difficult also in part because each of the various branches of science functions in somewhat different ways with different forms of evidence and experimental approaches.

Most models of scientific change rely on new data produced by scientific experiment. Karl Popper proposed that since no amount of experiments could ever &quot;prove&quot; a scientific theory, but a single experiment could &quot;disprove&quot; one, science should be based on falsification. Whilst this forms a logical theory for science, it is in a sense &quot;timeless&quot; and does not necessarily reflect a view on how science should progress over time.

Among the most influential challengers of this approach was Thomas Kuhn, who argued instead that experimental data always provide some data which cannot fit completely into a theory, and that falsification alone did not result in scientific change or an undermining of scientific consensus. He proposed that scientific consensus worked in the form of &quot;paradigms&quot;, which were interconnected theories and underlying assumptions about the nature of the theory itself which connected various researchers in a given field. Kuhn argued that only after the accumulation of many &quot;significant&quot; anomalies would scientific consensus enter a period of &quot;crisis&quot;. At this point, new theories would be sought out, and eventually one paradigm would triumph over the old one – a series of paradigm shifts rather than a linear progression towards truth. Kuhn&#x27;s model also emphasized more clearly the social and personal aspects of theory change, demonstrating through historical examples that scientific consensus was never truly a matter of pure logic or pure facts. However, these periods of &#x27;normal&#x27; and &#x27;crisis&#x27; science are not mutually exclusive. Research shows that these are different modes of practice, more than different historical periods.

==Perception and public opinion==

Perception of whether a scientific consensus exists on a given issue, and how strong that conception is, has been described as a &quot;gateway belief&quot; upon which other beliefs and then action are based.

== Politicization of science ==
In public policy debates, the assertion that there exists a consensus of scientists in a particular field is often used as an argument for the validity of a theory. Similarly arguments for a &quot;lack&quot; of scientific consensus are often used to support doubt about the theory. 

For example, the scientific consensus on the causes of global warming is that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused primarily by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. The historian of science Naomi Oreskes published an article in &quot;Science&quot; reporting that a survey of the abstracts of 928 science articles published between 1993 and 2003 showed none which disagreed explicitly with the notion of anthropogenic global warming. In an editorial published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Oreskes stated that those who opposed these scientific findings are amplifying the normal range of scientific uncertainty about any facts into an appearance that there is a great scientific disagreement, or a lack of scientific consensus. Oreskes&#x27;s findings were replicated by other methods that require no interpretation.

The theory of evolution through natural selection is also supported by an overwhelming scientific consensus; it is one of the most reliable and empirically tested theories in science. Opponents of evolution claim that there is significant dissent on evolution within the scientific community. The wedge strategy, a plan to promote intelligent design, depended greatly on seeding and building on public perceptions of absence of consensus on evolution.

The inherent uncertainty in science, where theories are never &quot;proven&quot; but can only be &quot;disproven&quot; (see falsifiability), poses a problem for politicians, policymakers, lawyers, and business professionals. Where scientific or philosophical questions can often languish in uncertainty for decades within their disciplinary settings, policymakers are faced with the problems of making sound decisions based on the currently available data, even if it is likely not a final form of the &quot;truth&quot;. The tricky part is discerning what is close enough to &quot;final truth&quot;. For example, social action against smoking probably came too long after science was &#x27;pretty consensual&#x27;.

Certain domains, such as the approval of certain technologies for public consumption, can have vast and far-reaching political, economic, and human effects should things run awry with the predictions of scientists. However, insofar as there is an expectation that policy in a given field reflect knowable and pertinent data and well-accepted models of the relationships between observable phenomena, there is little good alternative for policy makers than to rely on so much of what may fairly be called &#x27;the scientific consensus&#x27; in guiding policy design and implementation, at least in circumstances where the need for policy intervention is compelling. While science cannot supply &#x27;absolute truth&#x27; (or even its complement &#x27;absolute error&#x27;) its utility is bound up with the capacity to guide policy in the direction of increased public good and away from public harm. Seen in this way, the demand that policy rely only on what is proven to be &quot;scientific truth&quot; would be a prescription for policy paralysis and amount in practice to advocacy of acceptance of all of the quantified and unquantified costs and risks associated with policy inaction.

No part of policy formation on the basis of the ostensible scientific consensus precludes persistent review either of the relevant scientific consensus or the tangible results of policy. Indeed, the same reasons that drove reliance upon the consensus drives the continued evaluation of this reliance over time – and adjusting policy as needed.

<doc id="423729" wikidata="Q560566" url="?curid=423729" title="Libertarianism (metaphysics)">
<text>Libertarianism is one of the main philosophical positions related to the problems of free will and determinism which are part of the larger domain of metaphysics. In particular, libertarianism is an incompatibilist position which argues that free will is logically incompatible with a deterministic universe. Libertarianism states that since agents have free will, determinism must be false.

One of the first clear formulations of libertarianism is found in John Duns Scotus. In a theological context, metaphysical libertarianism was notably defended by Jesuit authors like Luis de Molina and Francisco Suárez against the rather compatibilist Thomist Bañecianism. Other important metaphysical libertarians in the early modern period were René Descartes, George Berkeley, Immanuel Kant and Thomas Reid.

Roderick Chisholm was a prominent defender of libertarianism in the 20th century and contemporary libertarians include Robert Kane, Geert Keil, Peter van Inwagen and Robert Nozick.

== Overview ==
The first recorded use of the term &quot;libertarianism&quot; was in 1789 by William Belsham in a discussion of free will and in opposition to &quot;necessitarian&quot; or determinist views.

Metaphysical libertarianism is one philosophical viewpoint under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires the agent to be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, and consequently the world is not closed under physics. Such interactionist dualists believe that some non-physical mind, will, or soul overrides physical causality.

Explanations of libertarianism that do not involve dispensing with physicalism require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior—a theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Physical determinism, under the assumption of physicalism, implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. Some libertarian explanations involve invoking panpsychism, the theory that a quality of mind is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities. Other approaches do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe; ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the &quot;elbow room&quot; believed to be necessary by libertarians.

Free volition is regarded as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of indeterminism. An example of this kind of approach has been developed by Robert Kane, where he hypothesizes that,
Although at the time quantum mechanics (and physical indeterminism) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book &quot;Miracles: A preliminary study&quot; C. S. Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality. Indeterministic physical models (particularly those involving quantum indeterminacy) introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level. These events might affect brain activity, and could seemingly allow incompatibilist free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes (for instance, subjective perceptions of control in conscious volition) maps to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct. This relationship, however, requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable, and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events. Secondarily, these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition, as studied in the neuroscience of free will. It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself, rendering limited our ability to identify causality. Niels Bohr, one of the main architects of quantum theory, suggested, however, that no connection could be made between indeterminism of nature and freedom of will.

== Agent-causal theories ==
In non-physical theories of free will, agents are assumed to have power to intervene in the physical world, a view known as agent causation. Proponents of agent causation include George Berkeley, Thomas Reid, and Roderick Chisholm.

Most events can be explained as the effects of prior events. When a tree falls, it does so because of the force of the wind, its own structural weakness, and so on. However, when a person performs a free act, agent causation theorists say that the action was not caused by any other events or states of affairs, but rather was caused by the agent. Agent causation is ontologically separate from event causation. The action was not uncaused, because the agent caused it. But the agent&#x27;s causing it was not determined by the agent&#x27;s character, desires, or past, since that would just be event causation. As Chisholm explains it, humans have &quot;a prerogative which some would attribute only to God: each of us, when we act, is a prime mover unmoved. In doing what we do, we cause certain events to happen, and nothing—or no one—causes us to cause those events to happen.&quot;

This theory involves a difficulty which has long been associated with the idea of an unmoved mover. If a free action was not caused by any event, such as a change in the agent or an act of the will, then what is the difference between saying that an agent caused the event and simply saying that the event happened on its own? As William James put it, &quot;If a &#x27;free&#x27; act be a sheer novelty, that comes not from me, the previous me, but ex nihilo, and simply tacks itself on to me, how can I, the previous I, be responsible? How can I have any permanent character that will stand still long enough for praise or blame to be awarded?&quot;
Agent causation advocates respond that agent causation is actually more intuitive than event causation. They point to David Hume&#x27;s argument that when we see two events happen in succession, our belief that one event caused the other cannot be justified rationally (known as the problem of induction). If that is so, where does our belief in causality come from? According to Thomas Reid, &quot;the conception of an efficient cause may very probably be derived from the experience we have had ... of our own power to produce certain effects.&quot; Our everyday experiences of agent causation provide the basis for the idea of event causation.

== Event-causal theories ==
Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as &quot;deliberative indeterminism&quot;, &quot;centred accounts&quot;, and &quot;efforts of will theory&quot;. The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the &quot;elbow room&quot; that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

&quot;Deliberative indeterminism&quot; asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process. This is intended to provide an indeterminate set of possibilities to choose from, while not risking the introduction of &quot;luck&quot; (random decision making). The selection process is deterministic, although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by Daniel Dennett and John Martin Fischer. An obvious objection to such a view is that an agent cannot be assigned ownership over their decisions (or preferences used to make those decisions) to any greater degree than that of a compatibilist model.

&quot;Centred accounts&quot; propose that for any given decision between two possibilities, the strength of reason will be considered for each option, yet there is still a probability the weaker candidate will be chosen. An obvious objection to such a view is that decisions are explicitly left up to chance, and origination or responsibility cannot be assigned for any given decision.

&quot;Efforts of will theory&quot; is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events—and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of volition have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of Robert Kane, where he hypothesizes that &quot;in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes—a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort.&quot; According to Robert Kane such &quot;ultimate responsibility&quot; is a required condition for free will. An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see non-reductive physicalism).

=== Epicurus ===

Epicurus, an ancient Hellenistic philosopher, argued that as atoms moved through the void, there were occasions when they would &quot;swerve&quot; (&quot;clinamen&quot;) from their otherwise determined paths, thus initiating new causal chains. Epicurus argued that these swerves would allow us to be more responsible for our actions, something impossible if every action was deterministically caused.

Epicurus did not say the swerve was directly involved in decisions. But following Aristotle, Epicurus thought human agents have the autonomous ability to transcend necessity and chance (both of which destroy responsibility), so that praise and blame are appropriate. Epicurus finds a &quot;tertium quid&quot;, beyond necessity and beyond chance. His &quot;tertium quid&quot; is agent autonomy, what is &quot;up to us.&quot;
[S]ome things happen of necessity (ἀνάγκη), others by chance (τύχη), others through our own agency (παρ&#x27; ἡμᾶς). [...]. [N]ecessity destroys responsibility and chance is inconstant; whereas our own actions are autonomous, and it is to them that praise and blame naturally attach.

The Epicurean philosopher Lucretius (1st century BC) saw the randomness as enabling free will, even if he could not explain exactly how, beyond the fact that random swerves would break the causal chain of determinism.
Again, if all motion is always one long chain, and new motion arises out of the old in order invariable, and if the first-beginnings do not make by swerving a beginning of motion such as to break the decrees of fate, that cause may not follow cause from infinity, whence comes this freedom (&quot;libera&quot;) in living creatures all over the earth, whence I say is this will (&quot;voluntas&quot;) wrested from the fates by which we proceed whither pleasure leads each, swerving also our motions not at fixed times and fixed places, but just where our mind has taken us? For undoubtedly it is his own will in each that begins these things, and from the will movements go rippling through the limbs.

However, the interpretation of these ancient philosophers is controversial. Tim O&#x27;Keefe has argued that Epicurus and Lucretius were not libertarians at all, but compatibilists.

=== Robert Nozick ===
Robert Nozick put forward an indeterministic theory of free will in &quot;Philosophical Explanations&quot; (1981).

When human beings become agents through reflexive self-awareness, they express their agency by having reasons for acting, to which they assign weights. Choosing the dimensions of one&#x27;s identity is a special case, in which the assigning of weight to a dimension is partly self-constitutive. But all acting for reasons is constitutive of the self in a broader sense, namely, by its shaping one&#x27;s character and personality in a manner analogous to the shaping that law undergoes through the precedent set by earlier court decisions. Just as a judge does not merely apply the law but to some degree makes it through judicial discretion, so too a person does not merely discover weights but assigns them; one not only weighs reasons but also weights them. Set in train is a process of building a framework for future decisions that we are tentatively committed to.

The lifelong process of self-definition in this broader sense is construed indeterministically by Nozick. The weighting is &quot;up to us&quot; in the sense that it is undetermined by antecedent causal factors, even though subsequent action is fully caused by the reasons one has accepted. He compares assigning weights in this deterministic sense to &quot;the currently orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics&quot;, following von Neumann in understanding a quantum mechanical system as in a superposition or probability mixture of states, which changes continuously in accordance with quantum mechanical equations of motion and discontinuously via measurement or observation that &quot;collapses the wave packet&quot; from a superposition to a particular state. Analogously, a person before decision has reasons without fixed weights: he is in a superposition of weights. The process of decision reduces the superposition to a particular state that causes action.

=== Robert Kane ===
One particularly influential contemporary theory of libertarian free will is that of Robert Kane. Kane argued that &quot;(1) the existence of alternative possibilities (or the agent&#x27;s power to do otherwise) is a necessary condition for acting freely, and that (2) determinism is not compatible with alternative possibilities (it precludes the power to do otherwise)&quot;. The crux of Kane&#x27;s position is grounded not in a defense of alternative possibilities (AP) but in the notion of what Kane refers to as ultimate responsibility (UR). Thus, AP is a necessary but insufficient criterion for free will. It is necessary that there be (metaphysically) real alternatives for our actions, but that is not enough; our actions could be random without being in our control. The control is found in &quot;ultimate responsibility&quot;.

Ultimate responsibility entails that agents must be the ultimate creators (or originators) and sustainers of their own ends and purposes. There must be more than one way for a person&#x27;s life to turn out (AP). More importantly, whichever way it turns out must be based in the person&#x27;s willing actions. Kane defines it as follows:

In short, &quot;an agent must be responsible for anything that is a sufficient reason (condition, cause or motive) for the action&#x27;s occurring.&quot;

What allows for ultimacy of creation in Kane&#x27;s picture are what he refers to as &quot;self-forming actions&quot; or SFAs—those moments of indecision during which people experience conflicting wills. These SFAs are the undetermined, regress-stopping voluntary actions or refraining in the life histories of agents that are required for UR. UR does not require that &quot;every&quot; act done of our own free will be undetermined and thus that, for every act or choice, we could have done otherwise; it requires only that certain of our choices and actions be undetermined (and thus that we could have done otherwise), namely SFAs. These form our character or nature; they inform our future choices, reasons and motivations in action. If a person has had the opportunity to make a character-forming decision (SFA), they are responsible for the actions that are a result of their character.

==== Critique ====
Randolph Clarke objects that Kane&#x27;s depiction of free will is not truly libertarian but rather a form of compatibilism. The objection asserts that although the outcome of an SFA is not determined, one&#x27;s history up to the event &quot;is&quot;; so the fact that an SFA will occur is also determined. The outcome of the SFA is based on chance, and from that point on one&#x27;s life is determined. This kind of freedom, says Clarke, is no different from the kind of freedom argued for by compatibilists, who assert that even though our actions are determined, they are free because they are in accordance with our own wills, much like the outcome of an SFA.

Kane responds that the difference between causal indeterminism and compatibilism is &quot;ultimate control—the originative control exercised by agents when it is &#x27;up to them&#x27; which of a set of possible choices or actions will now occur, and up to no one and nothing else over which the agents themselves do not also have control&quot;. UR assures that the sufficient conditions for one&#x27;s actions do not lie before one&#x27;s own birth.

Galen Strawson holds that there is a fundamental sense in which free will is impossible, whether determinism is true or not. He argues for this position with what he calls his &quot;basic argument&quot;, which aims to show that no-one is ever ultimately morally responsible for their actions, and hence that no one has free will in the sense that usually concerns us.

In his book defending compatibilism, &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot;, Daniel Dennett spends a chapter criticising Kane&#x27;s theory. Kane believes freedom is based on certain rare and exceptional events, which he calls self-forming actions or SFAs. Dennett notes that there is no guarantee such an event will occur in an individual&#x27;s life. If it does not, the individual does not in fact have free will at all, according to Kane. Yet they will seem the same as anyone else. Dennett finds an essentially &quot;indetectable&quot; notion of free will to be incredible.

<doc id="423731" wikidata="Q60497" url="?curid=423731" title="Slate (magazine)">
<text>Slate is an online magazine that covers current affairs, politics, and culture in the United States. It was created in 1996 by former &quot;New Republic&quot; editor Michael Kinsley, initially under the ownership of Microsoft as part of MSN. In 2004, it was purchased by The Washington Post Company (later renamed the Graham Holdings Company), and since 2008 has been managed by The Slate Group, an online publishing entity created by Graham Holdings. &quot;Slate&quot; is based in New York City, with an additional office in Washington, D.C.

&quot;Slate&quot;, which is updated throughout the day, covers politics, arts and culture, sports, and news. According to its former editor-in-chief Julia Turner, the magazine is &quot;not fundamentally a breaking news source&quot;, but rather aimed at helping readers to &quot;analyze and understand and interpret the world&quot; with witty and entertaining writing. As of mid-2015, it publishes about 1,500 stories per month.

A French version, &quot;slate.fr&quot;, was launched in February 2009 by a group of four journalists, including Jean-Marie Colombani, Eric Leser, and economist Jacques Attali. Among them, the founders hold 50 percent in the publishing company, while The Slate Group holds 15 percent. In 2011, &quot;slate.fr&quot; started a separate site covering African news, &quot;Slate Afrique&quot;, with a Paris-based editorial staff.

 the magazine is both ad-supported and has a membership model with a metered paywall. It is known, and sometimes criticized, for having adopted contrarian views, giving rise to the term &quot;Slate Pitches&quot;. It has a generally liberal editorial stance.

==Background==
&quot;Slate&quot; features regular and semi-regular columns such as &quot;Explainer, Moneybox, Spectator, Transport&quot;, and &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;. Many of the articles are short (less than 2,000 words) and argument-driven. Around 2010, the magazine also began running long-form journalism. Many of the longer stories are an outgrowth of the &quot;Fresca Fellowships&quot;, so-called because former editor Plotz liked the soft drink Fresca. &quot;The idea is that every writer and editor on staff has to spend a month or six weeks a year not doing their regular job, but instead working on a long, ambitious project of some sort&quot;, Plotz said in an interview.

&quot;Slate&quot; introduced a paywall-based business model in 1998 that attracted up to 20,000 subscribers but was later abandoned. A similar subscription model was implemented in April 2001 by &quot;Slate&quot;″s independently owned competitor, Salon.com.

&quot;Slate&quot; started a daily feature, &quot;Today&#x27;s Pictures&quot;, on November 30, 2005, which featured 15–20 photographs from the archive at Magnum Photos that share a common theme. The column also features two animated &quot;Interactive Essays&quot; a month.

On its 10th anniversary, &quot;Slate&quot; unveiled a redesigned website. It introduced &quot;Slate V&quot; in 2007, an online video magazine with content that relates to or expands upon their written articles. In 2013, the magazine was redesigned under the guidance of design director Vivian Selbo.

&quot;Slate&quot; was nominated for four digital National Magazine Awards in 2011 and won the NMA for General Excellence. In the same year, the magazine laid off several high-profile journalists, including co-founder Jack Shafer and Timothy Noah (author of the &quot;Chatterbox&quot; column). At the time, it had around 40 full-time editorial staff. The following year, a dedicated ad sales team was created.

&quot;Slate&quot; launched the &quot;Slate Book Review&quot; in 2012, a monthly books section edited by Dan Kois.

The next year, &quot;Slate&quot; became profitable after preceding years had seen layoffs and falling ad revenues.

In 2014, &quot;Slate&quot; introduced a paywall system called &quot;Slate Plus&quot;, offering ad-free podcasts and bonus materials. A year later, it had attracted 9,000 subscribers generating about $500,000 in annual revenue.

&quot;Slate&quot; moved all content behind a metered paywall for international readers in June 2015, explaining &quot;our U.S.-based sales team sells primarily to domestic advertisers, many of whom only want to reach a domestic audience. ...The end result is that, outside the United States, we are not covering our costs.&quot; At the same time, it was stated that there were no plans for a domestic paywall.

=== Reputation for counterintuitive arguments (&quot;Slate pitches&quot;) ===
Since 2006, &quot;Slate&quot; has been known for publishing contrarian pieces arguing against commonly held views about a subject, giving rise to the #slatepitches Twitter hashtag in 2009. The &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; has defined &quot;Slate&quot; pitches as &quot;an idea that sounds wrong or counterintuitive proposed as though it were the tightest logic ever&quot;, and in explaining its success wrote &quot;Readers want to click on Slate Pitches because they want to know what a writer could possibly say that would support their logic&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;Slate&quot;″s then editor-in-chief Julia Turner acknowledged a reputation for counterintuitive arguments forms part of &quot;Slate&quot;&#x27;s &quot;distinctive&quot; brand, but argued that the hashtag misrepresents the site&#x27;s journalism. &quot;We are not looking to argue that up is down and black is white for the sake of being contrarian against all logic or intellectual rigor. But journalism is more interesting when it surprises you either with the conclusions that it reaches or the ways that it reaches them.&quot;

In a 2019 article for the site, &quot;Slate&quot; contributor Daniel Engber reflected on the changes that had occurred on the site since he started writing for it 15 years previously. He suggested that its original worldview, influenced by its founder Kinsley and described by Engber as &quot;feisty, surprising, debate-club centrist-by-default&quot; and &quot;liberal contrarianism&quot;, had shifted towards &quot;a more reliable, left-wing slant&quot;, whilst still giving space for heterodox opinions, albeit &quot;tempered by other, graver duties&quot;. He argued that this was necessary within the context of a &quot;Manichean age of flagrant cruelty and corruption&quot;, although he also acknowledged that it could be &quot;a troubling limitation&quot;.

==Podcasts==
According to NiemanLab, &quot;Slate&quot; has been involved in podcasts &quot;almost from the very beginning&quot; of the medium. Its first podcast offering, released on July 15, 2005, featured selected stories from the site read by Andy Bowers, who had joined &quot;Slate&quot; after leaving NPR in 2003. By June 2012, &quot;Slate&quot; had expanded their lineup to 19 podcasts, with &quot;Political Gabfest&quot; and &quot;Culture Gabfest&quot; being the most popular. This count had shrunk to 14 by February 2015, with all receiving six million downloads per month. The podcasts are &quot;a profitable part of [&quot;Slate&quot;&#x27;s] business&quot;; the magazine charges more for advertising in its podcasts than in any of its other content.

<doc id="423732" wikidata="Q200785" url="?curid=423732" title="Tim Howard">
<text>Timothy Matthew Howard (born March 6, 1979) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a goalkeeper. He is the minority owner of USL Championship club Memphis 901, as well as an international ambassador in the U.S. for Premier League club Everton. Howard is regarded as one of the greatest American players of all time.

Howard began his career with the North Jersey Imperials, before making a move to the MetroStars. He was signed by English club Manchester United in 2003, replacing Fabian Barthez as the team&#x27;s first-choice keeper. In his second season at the club, Howard competed for the first-choice spot with Roy Carroll. Howard enjoyed relative success with the club, as they won the 2003 FA Community Shield, the 2003–04 FA Cup and the 2005–06 League Cup. He was listed on the PFA Team of the Year for the 2003–04 season.

After United signed goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar in 2005, Howard would only play once more for United before going on loan to Everton in 2006 and eventually signing permanently with them in February 2007. On January 4, 2012, Howard scored against Bolton Wanderers, making him only the fourth goalkeeper to score a goal in the Premier League. In 2016, Howard made his return to MLS, signing for the Colorado Rapids. He played for three years for the Rapids before hanging up his gloves in October 2019. He became the sporting director of USL Championship side Memphis 901 in January 2020, and came out of retirement to play briefly for them in March 2020.

Howard is the most capped goalkeeper of all-time for the United States men&#x27;s national team, with 121 appearances from 2002 until his international retirement in 2017. He was an unused substitute for the 2006 FIFA World Cup but later established himself as first-choice keeper of the United States&#x27; international tournament games beginning with the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, in which the U.S. ended as runner-up against Brazil. He started all of the team&#x27;s 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cup games. The team reached the Round of 16 on both occasions, and during the latter Howard set a World Cup record for most saves in a match, with 16 against Belgium. Because of this impressive performance, a Wikipedia article was falsely edited and claimed that Howard served as the Secretary of Defense for the United States.

==Early life==
Howard was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the son of African-American truck driver Matthew Howard and his Hungarian wife Esther (née Fekete), who worked for a container packing distributor. His father moved out &quot;before [Howard] formed [his] first memory&quot; and his parents divorced when Howard was three. Afterwards, Howard lived with his mother. Howard was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome and OCD when he was in the sixth grade.

In 1991, before Howard was a teenager, Tim Mulqueen, a one-time assistant coach for the U.S. under-17 soccer team, saw Howard&#x27;s potential at a single $25 soccer coaching session. He took Howard under his wing, offering him free soccer coaching. When Howard was 14 and 15 years old, Peter Mellor, the former professional goalkeeper who was coaching for the United States Soccer Federation and writing the curriculum for the first U.S. Soccer National Goalkeeping License for coaches, saw the 14-year-old Howard in an Olympic Development Player camp, identified him as a star of the future, and placed him in the Olympic Development Program. Mellor also helped Howard obtain his work permit appeal after he joined Manchester United from the MetroStars in 2003.

Howard attended North Brunswick Township High School. Howard proved a star not only in soccer as a midfielder, but also on the basketball court, where he averaged 15 points per game and helped bring his team to the state finals in his senior year. During high school, he played for Central Jersey Cosmos. In 1995, Howard was part of the U.S. under-17 squad.

==Club career==
In 1997, Mulqueen became the coach of the North Jersey Imperials, a team in the United Systems of Independent Soccer Leagues (USISL), and served as the goalkeeping coach for Major League Soccer (MLS)&#x27;s MetroStars; he considered Howard for a position on the Imperials. Howard signed with the Imperials and played in his first professional game before graduating from high school. He notched six appearances with the North Jersey Imperials.

===MetroStars===
Howard was brought up to the MetroStars by Mulqueen, who at the time was the MetroStars&#x27; goalkeeping coach.

Howard was victorious in his MLS debut with the MetroStars on August 18, 1998, making five saves in a 4–1 win over Colorado at Giants Stadium (his only appearance of the year). He later played in one game with the Nike Project-40 Team, a 3–1 win over the Staten Island Vipers at Giants Stadium on May 6, 1998.

With the MetroStars during the 1999 MLS season, Howard made eight starts in nine contests. Howard had a 1.58 GAA and won just one match in a season in which the Metros won just seven games. He also spent most of the international season with the United States Under-20 team, leaving the club to compete in the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship in April and the 1999 Pan American Games in July.

Howard posted a 5–2–2 record with a 1.59 GAA in 2000, splitting time between the MetroStars and the United States Olympic team, also winning all three of his U.S. Open Cup starts that season.

Howard won the 2001 MLS Goalkeeper of the Year award, recording 146 saves and finishing the year with a 1.33 GAA, four shutouts, and a 13–10–3 record. He also received the MLS Humanitarian of the Year Award.

Howard played in 27 of 28 regular season games in 2002 for the MetroStars, recording four shutouts. He was named to the MLS Best XI for the second straight season. Before leaving the MetroStars in 2003, he appeared in thirteen games and had three clean sheets as the club challenged for first place during the season&#x27;s first half.

===Manchester United===
Manchester United paid a US$4 million transfer fee to sign Howard in the middle of the 2003 MLS season, and he replaced Fabien Barthez as the club&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper.

Howard started off very well at Manchester United, saving the decisive penalty in the Community Shield against Arsenal. Other notable performances followed, including Bolton Wanderers and a home FA Cup tie victory over Manchester City. In March 2004, however, Howard&#x27;s poor parry handed a last minute goal to Porto, eliminating United from the UEFA Champions League. The error appeared to shatter Howard&#x27;s confidence and he was replaced by Roy Carroll. After a period of rest, Howard reclaimed his starting position ahead of Carroll for the 2004 FA Cup Final, picking up a winner&#x27;s medal. He was the second American player to collect a winner&#x27;s medal in the FA Cup, after Julian Sturgis of Wanderers in the 1873 final. Howard was also named in the PFA Team of the Year in his first season at Manchester United.

In Howard&#x27;s second season with Manchester United, he started poorly, making several errors and was dropped again for Carroll. After Carroll made several errors as well, Howard regained the starting position but his performances were unconvincing, leading to Carroll regaining his place again, playing in the FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal.

At the end of the 2004–05 season, Howard signed a new contract, which was to run until 2009. In the summer of 2005, Manchester United released both of his competitors for the goalkeeper position – Ricardo and Carroll. However, they also bought experienced Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar from Fulham soon after.

===Everton===
Howard joined Everton on loan for the 2006–07 season and made his debut for the club against Watford on the opening day of the Premier League season. He signed a permanent deal with the club in February 2007 for a fee reported to be worth around £3 million.

Howard made his 100th appearance for Everton against West Ham United, on November 8, 2008. On April 19, 2009, in the FA Cup semi final, he saved two penalties against his former club Manchester United in a penalty shoot-out to send Everton to the final against Chelsea. During the 2008–09 Premier League season, Howard set the club record for most league match clean sheets in a season. Howard started the 2009–10 Premier League season with four consecutive clean sheets, including away to Portsmouth where he helped his team secure a 1–0 win. Howard saved a Jermain Defoe penalty in injury time to help his side draw 2–2 with Tottenham Hotspur on December 6, 2009. Howard captained Everton for the first time in a 3–3 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on December 12, 2009.

During the 2011–12 Premier League season, Howard scored his first goal in professional soccer in a 2–1 defeat to Bolton Wanderers. His wind-assisted 101-yard clearance at Goodison Park made him only the fourth goalkeeper to score in a Premier League match since its formation in 1992. He described his goal as &quot;cruel&quot; and refused to celebrate out of sympathy/respect for his beaten opposite number, Ádám Bogdán.

In March 2012, Howard agreed a new contract to keep him at the club until the summer of 2016. On March 2, 2013, Howard&#x27;s run of 210 consecutive Premier League appearances dating back to September 2007 came to an end as he missed a game against Reading with a finger injury. He was two games short of equalling Neville Southall&#x27;s club record. In May, Howard kept his 100th clean sheet for Everton in a 0–0 draw against Liverpool in the Merseyside derby.

On December 26, Howard was sent off in a 1–0 defeat to Sunderland, which ended Everton&#x27;s hopes of remaining an entire calendar year unbeaten at home. In April 2014, Everton extended Howard&#x27;s contract by two years until 2018.

On February 19, 2016, Everton manager Roberto Martínez confirmed Howard was expected to serve as the backup to Joel Robles. Howard had recently been affected by a knee injury and a loss of form. Before his final match with the club, Howard made a speech before the fans, stating: &quot;I will remain an Evertonian for life. This will always be my team, my club.&quot;

===Colorado Rapids===

On March 20, 2016, it was announced that Howard would return to MLS and sign a three-and-a-half-year deal with the Colorado Rapids. He would join the team after the MLS transfer window opened on July 4. On June 28, Howard was given the number 1 jersey as he appeared in his first press conference with the club. On November 6, 2016, Howard saved two penalty kicks – with a third also being sent off the crossbar – against the LA Galaxy to send Colorado to the Western Conference Championship.

On January 22, 2019, Howard announced the 2019 Major League Soccer season would be his final season as a professional player. He retired in October 2019.

===Memphis 901===
On March 4, 2020, Howard announced his return to professional soccer, signing a playing contract with Memphis 901 in the USL Championship, where he also served as sporting director and minority owner. Howard stepped down as sporting director for Memphis 901 on June 19, 2024.

==International career==
Howard represented the United States under-20 national team at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship in Nigeria, playing in group stage victories over England and Cameroon, before a loss in the Round of 16 against Spain.

In July 1999, Howard was called up for the United States under-23 national team for the 1999 Pan American Games tournament. The United States ended the tournament with a bronze medal having overcome Canada in the Bronze medal match.

Howard was used as a backup to Brad Friedel at the 2000 Summer Olympics. On March 10, 2002, he received his first senior cap, against Ecuador. On May 2, 2006, Howard was named as one of three goalkeepers on the United States roster for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, but served as a backup to Kasey Keller. Howard became the team&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper under Bob Bradley and started in the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup final, a 2–1 win over Mexico.

Howard was the starting goalkeeper for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, including the semi-final in which the United States upset Spain, then the number one-ranked team in the world. Howard&#x27;s eight saves earned him his first clean sheet of the tournament and the first shutout of the Spanish side since 2007. Following the United States&#x27; second-place finish in the tournament, Howard was awarded the Golden Glove for best goalkeeper.

Howard was the starting goalkeeper for the 2010 World Cup, in South Africa, and turned in a man of the match performance against England in his World Cup debut. Howard&#x27;s distribution to Landon Donovan led to the game-winning goal of the final group match against Algeria, giving the United States passage into the round of 16. During the United States&#x27; round of 16 game against Ghana, Howard conceded two goals in a 2–1 loss.

After Mexico defeated the United States to win the 2011 Gold Cup Final, Howard made a controversial statement regarding the post-match ceremony. The trophy presentation was conducted entirely in Spanish, despite the tournament being held in the United States. Howard went on to say that it was a &quot;disgrace&quot; and commented further that if the final had been in Mexico City and the United States had won, the ceremony would not have been made in English.

On June 7, 2014, in the buildup to the 2014 World Cup, Howard received his 100th cap for the United States in a 2–1 defeat of Nigeria. On June 22, Howard was named man of the match for his display during the United States&#x27; 2–2 draw with Portugal; his most notable save was a reaction stop to deny Éder, having previously diverted Nani&#x27;s shot onto the post.

On July 1, Howard was again awarded man of the match, despite the United States losing 2–1 to Belgium after extra time in the round of 16. During the match, he broke the record for most saves in a World Cup match with 15. After breaking this record, his performance was celebrated worldwide on the internet, with the hashtag #ThingsTimHowardCouldSave trending on Twitter.

Following the World Cup, in August 2014, Howard asked U.S. men&#x27;s national team coach Jürgen Klinsmann to allow him to take a break from international soccer until September 2015; as a result, he missed the 2015 Gold Cup. He was called up again in August 2015, for the team&#x27;s friendly against Peru on September 4, at the RFK Stadium.

Howard was a member of the team that won the 2017 Gold Cup. However, following to national team&#x27;s failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup later that year, after a surprise 2–1 away defeat to Trinidad and Tobago on October 10, he was no longer capped at international level. With 121 appearances, he is the most capped goalkeeper in U.S. men&#x27;s national team history.

==Personal life==
Born to a Hungarian mother, Howard also holds a Hungarian passport. He is divorced from Laura Cianciola Howard, with whom he has two children. He started dating Jamie Blum, a Florida hair stylist, in 2021. He is a cousin of Mia Justus, also a professional soccer goalkeeper. He is a devout Christian and has said, &quot;The most important thing in my life is Christ. He&#x27;s more important to me than winning or losing or whether I&#x27;m playing or not. Everything else is just a bonus.&quot; He is also involved with Athletes in Action, a ministry arm of Campus Crusade for Christ.

Howard was named MLS Humanitarian of the Year in 2001 for his work with children with Tourette syndrome, and was added to the New Jersey Tourette Syndrome Association Board of Directors in the same year. In 2014, the U.S. Tourette Syndrome Association described him as the &quot;most notable individual with Tourette syndrome around the world&quot; when he was deemed a &quot;Champion of Hope&quot; for the &quot;tremendous courage he displayed in sharing his story on an international platform, educating the public on a disorder that is so seldom talked about, and encouraging young people living with TS to speak out about their experiences&quot;.

In 2014, Howard showed off his arm and torso tattoos for PETA&#x27;s &quot;Ink, Not Mink&quot; anti-fur campaign.

==Publications==
Howard&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Keeper: A Life of Saving Goals and Achieving Them&quot; (), was co-authored with Ali Benjamin and published in 2014. It describes his career and his life with Tourette syndrome and OCD. In the book, Howard says that his neurological makeup gave him an enhanced perception and an ability to hyper-focus that contributed to his success on the field. The &quot;New York Times&quot; book review said that &quot;few are cooler or quicker than Mr. Howard&quot; and that &quot;the story is good, but reading it require[s] a certain tolerance for sports clichés&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; describes Howard as the &quot;rarest of creatures – an American soccer hero&quot;, adding that the book has &quot;exciting recollections&quot; and that Howard is a &quot;gracious narrator, though here and there he engages in mild score-settling&quot;.

==Club ownership==
In September 2018, Howard became part-owner of English fifth-tier club Dagenham &amp; Redbridge and defunct American second-tier club Memphis 901. It was announced in December 2019 that Howard had taken over as sporting director at Memphis 901, and that he was already handling roster management for the club. Also, in October 2019, it was announced that Howard would be the first international ambassador in the United States for former club Everton.

<text>Maurice Bienvenu Jean Paul Trintignant (; 30 October 1917 – 13 February 2005) was a French racing driver and winemaker, who competed in Formula One from to . Trintignant won two Formula One Grands Prix across 15 seasons. In endurance racing, Trintignant won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Ferrari.

Trintignant competed in Formula One for 11 teams, winning two Grands Prix across 15 seasons. He finished fourth in the and World Drivers&#x27; Championships with Ferrari. He entered 15 editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans from to , winning in alongside José Froilán González, driving the Ferrari 375 Plus, and finished runner-up in . 

After retiring from motor racing, Trintignant moved into the winemaking trade, owning a vineyard in Languedoc-Roussillon, where he named his vintage &quot;Le Petoulet&quot;. Trintignant&#x27;s nephew, Jean-Louis, was a highly successful actor in post-World War II France.

==Racing career==
He began racing in 1938, and won the 1939 Grand Prix des Frontières, but his career was interrupted by the Second World War, during which his own Bugatti was stored in a barn. When he rebuilt it for an event of 1945, the &quot;Coupé de la Liberation&quot;, he overlooked a clogged fuel filter, which caused him to drop out of the race. It transpired that the filter was plugged with rat droppings, earning him the unenviable nickname, from another celebrated racer, Jean-Pierre Wimille, of &#x27;Le Petoulet&quot;, &quot;the rat-droppings man&quot;.

In 1948, Trintignant suffered a very serious accident during a support race for the Swiss Grand Prix. He was thrown in the air, and landed in the middle of the race track. His heart stopped beating for one minute and 15 seconds at the hospital, and he was pronounced dead. However, he survived, and woke up after a week-long coma. He kept a very peculiar looking abdomen scar, as the surgeon stitching a large wound did it at a very irregular pace while his heart had stopped beating. For six months, he suffered from amnesia and a loss of motor skills, but he eventually made a near complete recovery. The corner at which he crashed was later named after him. His wife offered him a stuffed teddy bear during his recovery, and as a superstition, Trintignant kept it in his pocket while he was racing for the rest of his career. He returned to racing in 1949 and won a Formula Two race at the Circuit des Remparts that year.

By 1950 &quot;Le Petoulet&quot; was successful enough to be offered a works drive for the Gordini team, in the newly formed Formula One World Championship racing series. He competed in Formula One every year until his retirement after the 1964 season. During this long career Trintignant scored two victories, both at the Monaco Grand Prix, in 1955 and 1958. Unusually for Monaco, both victories came from relatively far down the field, as Trintignant started those races from 9th and 5th respectively. 1954 and 1955 were his best Championship years and he finished fourth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship in both.

Trintignant won the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans with José Froilán González in a Ferrari 375 Plus, despite a seven minutes pitstop with one and a half hour to go, due to a faulty ignition wiring caused by the torrential rain.

Known for his conservative and reliable driving style, Trintignant drove a huge variety of cars, for many different teams: both works and privateer. Unusually, at the 1955 Argentine Grand Prix Trintignant shared both second and third places, a product of the Scuderia Ferrari policy of passing cars to their top drivers, should their original car break down. In 1956 he drove the Bugatti Type 251 in the French Grand Prix, becoming the last driver to represent the famed marque at a Grand Prix race. Even in his final season, driving his own BRM P57, he scored points, taking fifth place at the 1964 German Grand Prix on the intimidating Nürburgring. Between 1959 and 1966, Trintignant held the record for most World Championship Grand Prix starts. Following his retirement from racing, Maurice Trintignant returned to a quiet life as a wine-grower (naming his vintage &quot;Le Petoulet&quot;), near the town of Vergèze, in the Languedoc-Roussillon wine growing region.

Trintignant competed in the 2000 Historic Grand Prix of Monaco, reunited with the Cooper T45 he had driven to victory there in 1958.

Trintignant died, aged 87, in 2005.

<doc id="423740" wikidata="Q269568" url="?curid=423740" title="Grommet">
<text>A grommet is a ring or edge strip inserted into a hole through thin material, typically a sheet of textile fabric, sheet metal or composite of carbon fiber, wood or honeycomb. Grommets are generally flared or collared on each side to keep them in place, and are often made of metal, plastic, or rubber. They may be used to prevent tearing or abrasion of the pierced material or protection from abrasion of the insulation on the wire, cable, line being routed through the penetration, and to cover sharp edges of the piercing, or all of the above.

A small grommet may also be called an eyelet, used for example on shoes, tarps and sails for lacing purposes. 

Grommets in electrical applications are referred to as &quot;insulating bushings&quot;. Most common are molded rubber bushings that are inserted into hole diameters up to 2″ (51 mm). There are many hole configurations from standard round to assorted U-shapes. Larger penetrations that are irregular in shape as well as long straight edges are often fitted with extruded or stamped strips of continuous length, referred to as &quot;grommet edging&quot;. This type of protective bushing is quite common in applications that range from telecom switches and data center cabinets to complex and dense wire/cable and even hydraulic tubing in aircraft, transportation vehicles and medical equipment.

==As reinforcement or crafting==
Grommets are typically used to reinforce holes in leather, cloth, shoes, canvas and other fabrics. They can be made of metal, rubber, or plastic, and are easily used in common projects, requiring only the grommet itself and a means of setting it. A simple punch, a metal rod with a tip, is often sold with the grommets. It can be struck with a hammer to set the grommet. It can alternatively be set with an electronic, pneumatic, or gas-powered machine. There are also dedicated grommet presses with punch and anvil, as shown in the picture, ranging from inexpensive to better-quality tools, which are somewhat faster to use. 

Typical applications are footwear for boot and shoe laces, in laced clothing such as corsets, in flags for hoisting, and in curtains and other household items that require hanging from hooks, as when they are used in conjunction with tensioner rods for shower curtains. The grommet prevents the cord from tearing through the hole, thereby providing structural integrity. Small grommets are also called eyelets, especially when used in clothing or crafting. Eyelets may be used purely decoratively for crafting. When used in sailing and various other applications, they are called cringles. Sometimes field workers refer to them as grunyons.

==Maritime use==
Traditionally, rope grommets have been widely used on sailing ships in a variety of ways. They have been utilized as chest handles or on row boats as a soft oar lock. They are a rope ring that is made by first disassembling the rope then re-weaving the strands to the desired size.

==Use in electrical equipment==

===For cable protection===
Holes in metal or another hard material will often have sharp edges. Electrical wires, cord, rope, lacings, or other soft vulnerable material passing through the hole can become abraded or cut, or electrical insulation may break due to repeated flexing at the exit point of the casing of a junction box for example. Rubber, plastic or plastic coated metal grommets are used to avoid this. Tight fitting rubber grommets can also prevent the entry of dirt, air, water, etc. The smooth and sometimes soft inner surface of the grommet shields the wire from damage.

Grommets are generally used whenever wires pass through punched or drilled sheet metal or plastic casings for this reason. Molded and continuous strip grommets, also known as edge grommets, are manufactured in a wide variety of sizes and lengths expressly for this purpose; they are usually a single piece which can be inserted by hand. Two-piece hard plastic devices are available which also grip the wire that passes through. These are called strain relief bushings and are often used to insulate, anchor, and protect power cords where they enter panels. Preventing a tug or twist on the wire from stressing the electrical connections inside the connected equipment. Sleeved grommets have a flexible extension (sleeve), usually tapered or moulded to flex increasingly towards the free end in order to reduce fracturing of electrical insulation.

===To minimize vibration===

Grommets made of rubber or other elastic material are also used to minimize the transmission of vibration. They were widely used for mounting shock-sensitive computer disk drives, particularly in equipment subject to vibration or jarring, but are not usually used with more robust modern drives. The screws that hold the drive in place pass through grommets that decouple it acoustically from the chassis. Grommets are used in a similar way to acoustically isolate electronic circuit components that are susceptible to microphonism caused by mechanical vibration or jarring.

==Surgical grommets==
In chronic cases of otitis media with effusions present for months, surgery is sometimes performed to insert a grommet, called a &quot;tympanostomy tube&quot; into the eardrum to allow air to pass through into the middle ear, and thus release any pressure buildup and help clear excess fluid within.

This is also a correcting measure for a patulous Eustachian tube (when air moves to and from the middle ear with each breath making the eardrum flap).

<doc id="423745" wikidata="Q380152" url="?curid=423745" title="Azim Premji">
<text>Azim Hashim Premji (born 24 July 1945) is an Indian businessman and philanthropist, who was the chairman of Wipro Limited. Premji remains a non-executive member of the board and founder chairman. He is informally known as the Czar of the Indian IT Industry. He was responsible for guiding Wipro through four decades of diversification and growth, to finally emerge as one of the global leaders in the software industry. In 2010, he was voted among the 20 most powerful men in the world by &quot;Asiaweek&quot;. He has twice been listed among the 100 most influential people by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, once in 2004 and more recently in 2011. For years, he has been regularly listed one among &quot;The 500 Most Influential Muslims&quot;. He also serves as the Chancellor of Azim Premji University, Bangalore. Premji was awarded Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second highest civilian award, by the Government of India.

According to the Forbes and Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Premji&#x27;s net worth is estimated at $14.3 billion and $35.9 billion, respectively, as of December 2024. In 2013, he agreed to give away at least half of his wealth by signing the Giving Pledge. Premji started with a $2.2 billion donation to the Azim Premji Foundation, focused on education in India. He topped the &quot;EdelGive Hurun India Philanthropy List&quot; for 2020. In 2019, he dropped from the 2nd position in the Forbes India Rich list to 17th position after giving away a huge amount to charity.

In December 2024, Premji was ranked 19th on the Forbes list of India’s 100 richest tycoons, with a net worth of $32.2 billion.

==Early life and education==
Premji was born in Bombay, India in an Ismaili Muslim family from Gujarat. His father was a noted businessman and was known as &quot;Rice King of Burma&quot;. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan, invited his father Muhammed Hashim Premji to come to Pakistan, he turned down the request and chose to remain in India.

Premji has a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering degree from Stanford University. He is married to Yasmeen Premji. The couple have two children, Rishad and Tariq. Rishad Premji is currently the Chairman of the IT business, Wipro.

==Career==
In 1945, Muhammed Hashim Premji incorporated Western Indian Vegetable Products Ltd, based at Amalner, a small town in the Jalgaon district of Maharashtra. It used to manufacture cooking oil under the brand name Sunflower Vanaspati, and a laundry soap called 787, a byproduct of oil manufacture. In 1966, on the news of his father&#x27;s death, the then 21-year-old Azim Premji returned home from Stanford University, where he was studying engineering, to take charge of Wipro. The company, which was called Western Indian Vegetable Products at the time, dealt in hydrogenated oil manufacturing but Azim Premji later diversified the company to bakery fats, ethnic ingredient based toiletries, hair care soaps, baby toiletries, lighting products, and hydraulic cylinders. In the 1980s, the young entrepreneur, recognising the importance of the emerging IT field, took advantage of the vacuum left behind by the expulsion of IBM from India, changed the company name to &quot;Wipro&quot; and entered the high-technology sector by manufacturing minicomputers in technological collaboration with an American company Sentinel Computer Corporation. Thereafter, Premji made a focused shift from soaps to software.

===Recognition===

In March 2019, Premji pledged an additional 34% of Wipro stock held by him to the foundation. At a current value of about US$7.5 billion, this allocation will bring the total endowment from him to the foundation to US$21 billion.
* In May 2020, the Azim Premji Foundation collaborated with the National Centre for Biological Sciences, and the Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine for augmenting testing infrastructure to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.
* The foundation has warned against scam emails which claim to be from the foundation and falsely request donations.

===The Giving Pledge===
Premji has said that being rich &quot;did not thrill&quot; him. He became the first Indian to sign up for the Giving Pledge, a campaign led by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, to encourage the wealthiest people to make a commitment to give most of their wealth to philanthropic causes. He is the third non-American after Richard Branson and David Sainsbury to join this club.

In April 2013 he said that he has already given more than 25 per cent of his personal wealth to charity.

In July 2015, he gave away an additional 18% of his stake in Wipro, taking his total contribution so far to 39%.

The first Indian to sign the Giving Pledge, his lifetime giving now stands at US$21 billion. In April 2019, Azim Premji became the top Indian philanthropist.

=== EdelGive Hurun India Philanthropy List ===
Azim Premji topped the list of &quot;India&#x27;s most generous&quot; released by Hurun India and EdelGive on 10 November 2020. He donated ₹79.04 billion in financial year 2019–20 which is a 17-fold jump from the ₹4.53 billion donated in FY19. Education is the primary cause for his donations. He retained his position in FY21 by donating ₹9,713 crore (US$1.33 billion).

==Controversy==
In 2022, legal proceedings were initiated by a court in Bengaluru against Azim Premji for alleged corruption.

<doc id="423749" wikidata="Q232223" url="?curid=423749" title="Eudokia Makrembolitissa">
<text>Eudokia Makrembolitissa () was a Byzantine empress by her successive marriages to Constantine X Doukas and Romanos IV Diogenes. She acted as regent of her minor son, Michael VII in 1067, and resigned her regency by marriage to Romanos IV Diogenes. When he was deposed in 1071 she resumed the regency for her sons, but was soon forced to resign again.

Because she essentially ruled in her own right during her sole regencies and retained the title of empress, several modern scholars consider Eudokia to have been empress regnant in 1067 and some also in 1071.

== Background and early life ==
Eudokia Makrembolitissa was the daughter of John Makrembolites and a maternal niece of Michael I Cerularius, the patriarch of Constantinople, whose sister Keroularie had married Makrembolites. John, who belonged to the aristocracy of Constantinople, allied with Cerularius in 1040 to conspire against Emperor Michael IV, but their plan was stopped soon after. The birth date of Eudokia is unknown, but scholars often place it 1030. Some authors give her a lifespan of 1021–1096, but this is not corroborated by other sources. Eudokia married Constantine X Doukas sometime before his accession in 1059, probably 1049, when Constantine was 43 years old. She was Constantine&#x27;s second wife, as his first one, a daughter of Duke Constantine Dalassenos, died soon after their marriage. By 1059 they already had at least five children: the future Michael VII, an unnamed son who died young, Andronikos Doukas, Anna Doukaina and Theodora Doukaina.

== Empress ==

Constantine X Doukas was crowned emperor on 23 November 1059, the day after Isaac I Komnenos&#x27; abdication. Eudokia was crowned &quot;augusta&quot; soon after, probably on the same year. They had a fourth son around this time, Konstantios Doukas, who was crowned before his brother Michael, and an other daughter, Zoe. When Constantine fell ill in October 1066, he appointed &quot;caesar&quot; John Doukas and patriarch John VIII Xiphilinos as co-regents. Eudokia was meant to only take care of Michael and Konstantios, but Constantine knew that she had larger ambitions. Constantine died the next year, on 23 May 1067.

In 1825, Charles Abraham Elton counted Eudocia among the monarchs of the Byzantine Empire in his &quot;History of the Roman Emperors&quot;. Some historians regard Eudokia as an empress regnant who actually ruled in her own right, rather than just a regent. According to the contemporary Michael Psellos, Eudokia &quot;succeeded [Constantine X] as supreme ruler, she did not hand over the government to others... she assumed control of the whole administration in person. Michael VII was &quot;already long past his boyhood&quot; by this time, but nevertheless &quot;left the whole administration to his mother&quot;. Some authors argue that he had some type of mental disability.

Her status as a ruler is reflected in her coinage and public iconography. For example, she sometimes appeared on silver and copper coins without her sons, which was very unusual. One inscription on a silver reliquary calls her &quot;Great Empress of the Romans&quot; (&quot;megalē basilis tōn Romaiōn&quot;), suggesting that she had a higher status than her sons (who were only &quot;basileus&quot;). Some inscriptions of 1067 ascribe the masculine title Emperor to her. On a tetarteron probably of late 1067, the inscription reads &#x27;Eudokia and Michael, emperors&#x27;, and on a seal, probably dated between May and December 1067, the inscription reads &#x27;Eudokia, Michael and Constantios, emperors of the Romaioi&#x27;.

Eudokia had sworn on Constantine&#x27;s deathbed not to remarry, and she even made the oath in the presence of patriarch John VIII Xiphilinos. However, she knew that her position of power could be compromised if she continued to wield power alone. She then chose Romanos IV Diogenes, a general who had great popularity with the army. This decision was quite controversial, as Romanos had been accused of conspiring with the Hungarians shortly before Constantine X&#x27;s death. Eudokia hoped that his skills and leadership would stop the advance of the Seljuk Turks in the East. On 25 December, Eudokia rewarded Romanos with the titles &quot;magistros&quot; and &quot;stratelates&quot; in preparation for his coronation. However, they still needed the approval of the patriarch of Constantinople. According to some sources, Eudokia tricked John VIII into believing that she would marry one of his brothers. John VIII accepted the offer and canceled the oath. The marriage and imperial coronation took place on 1 January 1068, to the surprise of the patriarch and other officials.

With her new husband&#x27;s assistance, Eudokia was able to dispel the impending danger. She had two sons with Romanos IV, Nikephoros and Leo. Another of Eudokia and Constantine&#x27;s sons, Andronikos Doukas, was also made co-emperor by Romanos IV, although he had been excluded from power by his own father, mother, and brothers. He was probably crowned too in 1068, although he is ignored by contemporary chronicles. Contemporary coinage seems to depict Romanos as inferior to Michael and his brothers, and thus inferior to the empress. He is sometimes not even called &quot;emperor&quot;, as some &quot;tetarteron&quot; only call him &quot;despotes&quot; and reserve the title &quot;basileus&quot; for Eudokia. According to Michael Psellos, she explicitly referred to him as &quot;a subject, not a ruler.&quot; Romanos IV, however, soon started to act independently of her, even starting to resent her. Discontent was also shared by a faction of the Senate and army, with John Doukas at the head.

On 26 August 1071, Romanos IV faced Alp Arslan, sultan of the Seljuk Empire, at the decisive Battle of Manzikert. The Byzantine army was destroyed and the emperor himself was captured, partly because of the treachery of general Andronikos, John Doukas&#x27;s son. The news reached Constantinople a few days later, causing much shock in the populace. On 1 October the Senate declared Romanos IV deposed and proclaimed Eudokia and Michael VII as joint rulers. Some sources state that Eudokia was already planning on deposing her husband, but this is very unlikely. The new regime only lasted one month, when Eudokia&#x27;s opposition became strong enough to depose her, especially after news of Romanos release arrived at the capital. Michael VII was then proclaimed sole &quot;autokrator&quot; by John Doukas, who forced Eudokia to retire to a monastery as a nun.

== Later life ==

Eudokia continued to be influential even after her exile in 1071. Soon after her deposition, she allied with Anna Dalassene, a sister-in-law of Isaac I Komnenos who had also been exiled, to restore Romanos IV and depose John Doukas. However, Doukas soon fell from grace as a result of the schemes of eunuch Nikephoritzes, who was close to the Komnenos family. Eudokia later performed a memorable funeral and burial for Romanos IV, who died on 4 August 1072.

After Michael VII was deposed in 1078 by Nikephoros III Botaneiates, Eudokia was recalled to Constantinople by the new emperor, who offered to marry her. This plan did not come to pass, mainly due to the opposition of John Doukas, who returned to power after Nikephoritzes&#x27;s exile. However, Nikephoros still sent her many rewards and gifts of gratitude. Her date of death is unknown, but it was sometime after the accession of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081. Her last known action is the adoption of one of the cousins of Patriarch Michael I Cerularius.

Attributed to Eudokia is a dictionary of history and mythology, called &quot;&quot; (i.e., &quot;Collection&quot; or &quot;Bed of Violets&quot;). It is prefaced by an address to her husband, Romanos Diogenes, and the work is described as &quot;a collection of genealogies of gods, heroes, and heroines, of their metamorphoses, and of the fables and stories respecting them found in the ancients; containing also notices of various philosophers&quot;. However, the book is now thought to be a modern (16th-century) compilation, falsely attributed to Eudokia, and compiled by the counterfeiter Constantine Paleocappa 1540. The sources from which the work was compiled include Diogenes Laërtius and the Suda.
== Issue ==
By her first husband, Eudokia had seven children, four sons and three daughters: 
* Michael VII Doukas, co-emperor from 1060 and senior emperor after 1071.
* A son who died in infancy.
*Anne Doukaina, nun.
* Andronikos Doukas, co-emperor from 1068 to 1078.
* Theodora Doukaina, who married Domenico Selvo, Doge of Venice.
*Konstantios Doukas, co-emperor from 1060 to 1078, died in battle with the Normans in 1081.
*Zoe Doukaina, who married Adrianos Komnenos, a brother of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. They had a son, Alexios, and two daughters, maybe named Anne and Alexia.

By her second husband, she had two sons, most likely twins:
* Nikephoros Diogenes, blinded by order of Alexios I Comnenus on charges of treason.
* Leo Diogenes, died in battle.

<doc id="423750" wikidata="Q559523" url="?curid=423750" title="List of Space Shuttle missions">
<text>The Space Shuttle was a partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system operated by NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration). Its official program name was Space Transportation System (STS), taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, conducted science experiments in orbit, and participated in construction and servicing of the International Space Station (ISS). The first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981, leading to operational flights beginning in 1982.

From 1981 to 2011 a total of 135 missions were flown, all launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. During that time period the fleet logged 1,322 days, 19 hours, 21 minutes and 23 seconds of flight time. The longest orbital flight of the Shuttle was STS-80 at 17 days 15 hours, while the shortest flight was STS-51-L at one minute 13 seconds when the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; broke apart during launch. The cold morning shrunk an O-Ring on the right Solid Rocket Booster causing the external fuel tank to explode. The shuttles docked with Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot; nine times and visited the ISS thirty-seven times. The highest altitude (apogee) achieved by the shuttle was when deploying the Hubble Space Telescope. The program flew a total of 355 people representing 16 countries, and with 852 total shuttle fliers. The Kennedy Space Center served as the landing site for 78 missions, while 54 missions landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California and one mission landed at White Sands, New Mexico.

The first orbiter built, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, was used for atmospheric flight tests (ALT) but future plans to upgrade it to orbital capability were ultimately canceled. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: &quot;Columbia&quot;, &quot;Challenger&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;, and &quot;Atlantis&quot;. &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot; were destroyed in mission accidents in 1986 and 2003 respectively, killing a total of fourteen astronauts. A fifth operational orbiter, &quot;Endeavour&quot;, was built in 1991 to replace &quot;Challenger&quot;. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of STS-135 by &quot;Atlantis&quot; on 21 July 2011.

== Flight numbering ==
The U.S. Space Shuttle program was officially referred to as the Space Transportation System (STS). Specific shuttle missions were therefore designated with the prefix &quot;STS&quot;. Initially, the launches were given sequential numbers indicating order of launch, such as STS-7. Subsequent to the Apollo 13 mishap, due to Administrator of NASA James M. Beggs&#x27;s triskaidekaphobia and consequent unwillingness to number a forthcoming flight as STS-13, beginning in 1984, each mission was assigned a code, such as STS-41-B, with the first digit (or pair of digits for years 1990 and beyond) indicating the federal fiscal year offset into the program (so 41-B was scheduled for FY 1984, 51-A thru 51-L originally for FY 1985, and the third flight in FY 1995 would have been named 151-C), the second digit indicating the launch site (1 was Kennedy Space Center and 2 was Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base, although Vandenberg was never used), and the letter indicating scheduling sequence. These codes were assigned when the launches were initially scheduled and were not changed as missions were delayed or rescheduled. The codes were adopted from STS-41-B through STS-51-L (although the highest code used was actually STS-61-C), and the sequential numbers were used internally at NASA on all processing paperwork.

After the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, NASA returned to using a sequential numbering system, with the number counting from the beginning of the STS program. Unlike the initial system, however, the numbers were assigned based on the initial mission schedule, and did not always reflect actual launch order. This numbering scheme started at 26, with the first flight as STS-26R—the R suffix stood for &quot;reflight&quot; to disambiguate from prior missions. The suffix was used for two years through STS-33R, then the R was dropped. As a result of the changes in systems, flights under different numbering systems could have the same number with one having a letter appended, e.g. flight STS-51 (a mission carried out by &quot;Discovery&quot; in 1993) was many years after STS-51-A (&quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; second flight in 1984). It wasn&#x27;t until STS-127 in 2009 where the flight numbering system returned to a standard and consistent order.

== Shuttle flights ==
=== Atmospheric flight tests ===
The Approach and Landing Test program encompassed 16 separate tests of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, covering taxi tests, uncrewed and crewed flights on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), and finally the free flight tests. The following list includes the free-flight tests, durations listed count only the orbiter free-flight time. The list does not include total time aloft along with airborne time atop of the SCA.


===Launches and orbital flights===

==Shuttle missions==

===Canceled missions===

One initial emergency flight abort (RTLS) sub-orbital test mission was canceled due to high risk. Many other planned missions were canceled due to the late development of the shuttle, and the &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot; disasters.

Four missions were cut short by a day or more while in orbit: STS-2 (equipment failure), STS-35 (weather), STS-44 (equipment failure), and STS-83 (equipment failure, relaunched as STS-94).

===Contingency missions===
STS-300 was the designation for the Space Shuttle Launch on Need (LON) missions to be launched on short notice for STS-114 and STS-121, in the event that the shuttle became disabled or damaged and could not safely return to Earth. The rescue flight for STS-115, if needed, would have been STS-301. After STS-115, the rescue mission designations were based on the corresponding regular mission that would be replaced should the rescue mission be needed. For example, the STS-116 rescue mission was branded STS-317, because the normal mission scheduled after STS-116 was STS-117. Should the rescue mission have been needed, the crew and vehicle for STS-117 would assume the rescue mission profile and become STS-317. All potential rescue missions were to be launched with a crew of four, and would return with ten or eleven crew members, depending on the number of crew launched on the rescued shuttle. Missions were expected to last approximately eleven days. None of the planned contingency missions were ever flown.

No contingency mission was planned for STS-135, the final shuttle mission. Instead, NASA planned to effect any required rescues one-by-one, using Russian Soyuz spacecraft.

<text>Portugal is a unitary state with delegated authority to three levels of local government that cover the entire country:

* 2 autonomous regions (Azores and Madeira), and in Continental Portugal: 2 metropolitan areas, and 21 intermunicipal communities
* 308 municipalities
* 3091 civil parishes () (except Corvo Island which only has a single municipality)

The Judiciary of Portugal has a separate geographic system.

The government structure is based on the 1976 Constitution, adopted after the 1974 Carnation Revolution.

The powers of the 18 Districts were removed when the government decided not to reappoint their Civil Governors in 2011.

The legal status of a city or town is granted only for ceremonial purposes, typically with smaller boundaries than municipalities. Some municipalities have several cities.

Starting in 2003, Eurostat has defined regions and subregions in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) standard. These are coincide with some local government borders, but are otherwise only used for statistical purposes.

==Districts==
There are 18 districts in continental Portugal:

The distribution of Portuguese districts is nominally homogeneous, although there are outliers (Beja for example is 4.6 times larger than the smallest district, Viana do Castelo). But these divisions bely the inadequacies and disparities that exist within the country: the distribution of population and gross domestic product between territorial units is markedly different. The district of Beja, for example, represents approximately 11.5% of the area of Portugal, while Viana do Castelo is less than 2.5%. But, in comparison, Beja represents only 1.6% of the population of Portugal.

Portugal was primarily a seafaring nation, and traditionally human settlement has congregated along the coastline, so much so that the coastal districts, while being relatively small, were disproportionately larger by population. The six largest districts (with the exception of Santarém) are the six districts with the smallest populations and common character: a border with Spain. Of these interior districts, which represent 63.8% of the nation and have a population that is less than two million residents, is only marginally less than the population of the district of Lisbon.

The district system dates back to 25 April 1835, a creation of the Liberal government, and inspired by the French &quot;départements&quot;, with the objective to facilitate the action of government and permit access to the authorities.

The district is the most relevant and historically significant subdivision of the nation&#x27;s territory; it serves as the basis for a series of administrative divisions, such as electoral constituencies or district football associations, as well as being a socially recognizable territorial division of the country.
In 1976, Portugal was divided into 18 districts and two autonomous regions (the Azores and Madeira), consisting of 308 municipalities (), which in turn were divided into 4257 local government authorities ().

Article 291 of the 1976 Constitution defined the districts as a transitional level of administration, awaiting the formation of the administrative regions. In the period between 2003 and 2013 the whole continental territory of Portugal was subdivided into metropolitan areas and intermunicipal communities, which now form the top-level administrative divisions of the continental territory. The powers of the 18 Districts were removed when the government decided not to reappoint their Civil Governors in 2011.
===List===
== Autonomous regions ==

Since 1976, Portugal conceded political autonomy to its North Atlantic archipelagos (Madeira and Azores) due to their distance, isolation, geographical context and socio-economic circumstances. The regional autonomies have their own organic laws, regional governments and administration, overseen by a Regional Government (), that constitutes a Regional Cabinet, comprising a President () and several Regional Secretaries ().

The Azores () is an archipelago of nine islands and several islets that were discovered and settled by the Portuguese in the late 15th century. The Azores lies a third of the distance between Europe and North America, along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The government and administration of the archipelago is distributed between the three capitals of the former districts of the Azores: the regional parliament is located in the city of Horta (on Faial Island); Ponta Delgada (on São Miguel Island) is the most populous city and home to the Regional Presidency and administration; while Angra do Heroísmo (on Terceira Island), the historical and cultural capital, is the home of the Azorean judiciary and seat of the Diocese of the Azores.

Madeira is an archipelago that includes two principal islands, Madeira and Porto Santo, plus two uninhabited natural group of islands, the Desertas and Savage Islands (). The archipelago is located closer to Africa than Europe, is highly commercial and urbanized; its regional capital (Funchal) is developmentally comparable to urban centers in the Canary or Balearic Islands.

== Subdivisions ==
The division of the Portuguese territory is established in title eight (Título VIII) of the Portuguese constitution: granting local authority to territorial collectivities with representative organs to affect the interests of the local populations. These collectivities are defined as autonomous regions, administrative regions, municipalities and civil parishes, but reserves the right of urban areas and islands to establish other forms of local authority. In defining the rights and privileges of these entities, the constitution also defines sources of income, that includes local heritage, budgets and equalization transfers from the State, in addition to defining the basic role of local government at each level.

=== Autonomous regions ===
Since 1976, Portugal conceded political autonomy to its North Atlantic archipelagos (the Azores and Madeira) due to their distance, isolation, geographical context and socio-economic circumstances. The regional autonomies have their own organic laws, regional governments and administration, overseen by a Regional Government (), that constitutes a Regional Cabinet, comprising a President () and several Regional Secretaries (). Their legislatures are designated Legislative Assembly.

=== Administrative regions ===
A plan to divide mainland Portugal in eight regions was defeated in a referendum in 1998. The metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto were created in 1991. A law passed in 2003 supported the creation of more metropolitan areas, urban communities and other associations of municipalities, but a law passed in 2008 abolished these, converting them into intermunicipal communities. Finally in law 75/2013 September 2013 the current two types of administrative regions were defined:
*metropolitan areas (&quot;áreas metropolitanas&quot;) and
*intermunicipal communities (&quot;comunidades intermunicipais&quot;).

==== Metropolitan areas ====


The Metropolitan Areas are territorial units formed by grouping municipalities, in order to economize on municipal investments and services. As of 2014, there are two metropolitan areas that correspond to Level III NUTS regions:
* The Lisbon metropolitan area (&quot;Área Metropolitana de Lisboa&quot;), consisting of 18 municipalities with a total population (2011 census) of 2,821,876
* The Porto metropolitan area (&quot;Área Metropolitana do Porto&quot;), consisting of 17 municipalities with a total population (2011 census) of 1,759,524

(Other cities have metropolitan areas as defined by commuting patterns, but do not have the same legal status and are all under 1 million inhabitants.)

==== Intermunicipal communities ====
The intermunicipal communities replaced the urban communities, the intermunicipal communities for general purposes and some metropolitan areas that were created in 2003, and abolished in 2008. The territories of the intermunicipal communities are (roughly) based on the NUTS III statistical regions. As of 2014, there are 21 intermunicipal communities:

* Alentejo Central
* Alentejo Litoral
* Algarve
* Alto Alentejo
* Alto Minho
* Alto Tâmega
* Ave
* Baixo Alentejo
* Beira Baixa
* Beiras e Serra da Estrela
* Cávado
* Douro
* Lezíria do Tejo
* Médio Tejo
* Oeste
* Região de Aveiro
* Região de Coimbra
* Região de Leiria
* Tâmega e Sousa
* Terras de Trás-os-Montes
* Viseu Dão Lafões
=== Municipalities ===


Apart from the national territory, that includes mainland Portugal and the two archipelagos, the municipalities (&quot;municípios&quot;, colloquially known as &quot;concelhos&quot;) have been the most constant territorial subdivision in the past 900 years. While a term for &quot;municipality&quot; () appeared in the 13th century, to &quot;express a community constituted in a territory of varying extensions, whose residents – the neighbours of the municipality – are granted major or minor administrative autonomy&quot;, the territorial division predates its use. Preceding the nation&#x27;s independence, the oldest of the larger municipalities still in existence Coimbra and Santarém were founded in 1085 e 1095, respectively. São João da Pesqueira (in the district of Viseu) is the oldest Portuguese municipality, founded in 1055.

Since the creation of a democratic local administration, in 1976, the Portuguese municipalities have been ruled by a system composed by an executive body (the municipal chamber) and a deliberative body (the municipal assembly). The municipal chamber () is the executive body, and is composed of a &quot;president&quot; of the municipality and a number of councillors whose number depends on the municipality&#x27;s population. The municipal assembly () is composed of the presidents of all the civil parishes plus a number of directly elected representatives that has to be at least equal to the number of civil parish presidents plus one, and which otherwise depends on the municipal population.

There are 308 municipalities in Portugal. They are usually named for their biggest city, or at least, their historically most important city or town. However, the municipality is usually much larger than the city or town after which it is named. The largest in area is Odemira with 1720.60 km2, the smallest is São João da Madeira with an area of 7.94 km2.

Nearly all municipalities are subdivided into civil parishes. Barcelos is the municipality with the largest number of civil parishes (61). There are six municipalities that have only one civil parish: São João da Madeira, Alpiarça, Barrancos, Castanheira de Pera, Porto Santo (Madeira) and São Brás de Alportel. The municipality of Corvo (comprising the Corvo Island in the Azores) is the only Portuguese municipality without a civil parish.

=== Civil parishes ===
The parish, in contrast with the municipalities, had their base in the ecclesiastical divisions that &quot;had its origin in the fact that neighbours professed the same religion and professed their faith and divinity in the same temple&quot;. Between 1216 and 1223, Afonso II of Portugal began a process of legitimizing the Portuguese territory by conferring charters to nobles, clergy and municipal chambers (which would not be completed until after 1249 (under Afonso III of Portugal), making the parish the smallest division. From the 19th century &quot;freguesia&quot; began to refer to the civil/administrative entity, while the &quot;paróquia&quot; (Latin and 19th-century Portuguese: &quot;parochia&quot;) became affiliated with the religious entity.

Since the creation of a democratic local administration, in 1976, the Portuguese parishes have been ruled by a system composed by an executive body (the &quot;junta de freguesia&quot;, &quot;parish board&quot;) and a deliberative body (the &quot;assembleia de freguesia&quot;, &quot;parish assembly&quot;). The members of the &quot;assembleia de freguesia&quot; are publicly elected every four years. The presidents of the parish boards are also members of the municipal assembly.

Before the 2013 local government reforms, the 308 municipalities were subdivided into 4,259 civil parishes. As part of the national government&#x27;s attempt to control spending, in light of the sovereign debt crisis, in 2012 the government of Pedro Passos Coelho introduced a plan to reform the administrative divisions, in order to create efficiencies and save money. The plan envisioned the reform of the management, territorial geography and political form of how Portugal functioned at the local level, including specifically at the &quot;freguesia&quot; and &quot;município&quot; levels. In addition to the reduction of the number of representatives in the local boards, the plan also established criteria for the reduction, amalgamation or extinction of various civil parishes. The reform was implemented according to law 11-A/2013 January 2013, which defined the reorganization of the civil parishes,

Since the 2013 reform, there are 3,091 parishes in Portugal. The largest in area is Alcácer do Sal (Santa Maria do Castelo e Santiago) e Santa Susana with 888.35 km2, the smallest is Borba (São Bartolomeu) with an area of 0.20 km2.

== Historical and cultural regions ==

Portugal has a complex administrative structure, a consequence of a millennium of various territorial divisions. Unlike other European countries like Spain or France, the Portuguese territory was settled early, and maintained with stability after the 13th century.

The first division of the Portuguese territory was based exclusively on the Roman Iberian provinces of Hispania Tarraconensis, Lusitania and Hispania Baetica, established by Emperor Augustus between 27 and 13 B.C. The actual territory of Portugal north of the Douro, the province of Tarraconensis, occupied half of the peninsula, while the province of Lusitania, included the area south of the Douro. These Roman provinces were themselves subdivided into &quot;conventus iuridicus&quot;: &quot;Conventus Bracarum&quot;, its seat in &quot;Bracara Augusta&quot; (today the city of Braga); &quot;Conventus Scallabitanus&quot;, its seat in &quot;Scallabis&quot; (today the city of Santarém); and &quot;Conventus Pacensis&quot;, its seat in &quot;Pax Julia&quot; (today Beja). By the end of the third century, Emperor Diocletian administratively reordered Tarraconesis, dividing it into three separate territories (Tarraconensis, Carthaginensis and Callaecia), the latter comprising the northern Portugal, Galicia and Asturias. These divisions remained constant even after the Visigoths controlled the Iberian peninsula.

During the period of Al-Andalus and Muslim caliphates, the Iberian peninsula was divided administratively into provinces (&quot;kuwar&quot;) and municipalities (&quot;kurar&quot;), along the lines of the Roman-Visigothic delineations. Meanwhile, the &quot;taifa&quot; of Badajoz dominated the spaces of Beiras, Estremadura and a great part of the Alentejo.

With the expansion of the Portuguese national territory, following the conquest of new lands, the monarchy imposed a structure that permitted permanent dominion and organization of territorial space. There was also a tendency to demarcate lands associated with settlements or seigneurial properties; there was a constant history of forals (the royal charters) being allocated for unorganized territories, as a means to primarily establish fealty rights and encourage medieval settlement. Historically, the institution of the foral system was a way to divide the territory and to establish local administrative control (and not regional or hierarchical continuity). Similarly the parish, instituted by the religious orders that dominated the country, controlled local ecclesiastical power at the local level.

During the reign of King Dinis (1279–1325), the monarch instituted a series of inquiries throughout the kingdom which resulted, a few years later, in the configuration of the territory into provinces and municipalities. This was the first official recognition of the diversity of the country, and in the King&#x27;s &quot;Testamento do Reino de Portugal&quot; he recognized the five &quot;regions&quot; of the nation: &quot;Antre Douro e Minho&quot;; &quot;Antre Douro e Mondego&quot;; &quot;Beira&quot;, &quot;Estremadura&quot; and &quot;Antre Tejo e Odiana&quot;.

=== Provinces ===
Dinis&#x27;s successor, Afonso IV (1325–1357), instituted a system of six official comarcas, that reflected a concrete definition of these regions: &quot;Antre Douro e Minho&quot;, &quot;Antre Douro e Mondego&quot;, &quot;Beira&quot;, &quot;Estremadura&quot;, &quot;Antre Tejo e Odiana&quot; and &quot;Algarve&quot;. Between the reign of Afonso IV and the 20th century there were numerous alterations to the limits of the nation, a consequence of development and population growth. Further modifications to the limits of these provinces occurred in the &quot;Plano de Ordenamento da Mata Nacional da Machada&quot; (1864), the first scientific delimiting of forest resources, and the &quot;Projecto Geral da Arborização dos Areais Móveis de Portugal&quot; (1897), which modified land usage along the coast.

But, until 1832, the provinces did not serve an administrative function, although they did mark the differences in habits, linguistic peculiarities and socio-cultural characteristics. The province remained a military designation, chiefed by the &quot;General das Armas&quot; (Military Governor), expressly forbidden from influencing municipal affairs. During the Liberal regime, some of the liberal politicians conceived an administrative system where provinces were the top level tier of government, maintaining their former names, but with different borders. The debate over the importance of provinces only arose from fears that there would be an excessive concentration of power in the hands of governmental officers (). The adoption of the 17 districts (1835) instead of eight provinces was an attempt to dissolve such power.

In 1936, the provinces were reestablished as administrative divisions in Portugal. However, instead the six traditional provinces, 11 new ones were established: &quot;Minho&quot;, &quot;Douro Litoral&quot;, &quot;Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro&quot;, &quot;Beira Alta&quot;, &quot;Beira Baixa&quot;, &quot;Beira Litoral&quot;, &quot;Estremadura&quot;, &quot;Ribatejo&quot;, &quot;Alto Alentejo&quot;, &quot;Baixo Alentejo&quot; and &quot;Algarve&quot;. These were based in the natural regions identified by the geographer Amorim Girão in several studies he published between 1922 and 1930. The Estado Novo regime used the provinces to characterize traditional and rural Portugal. Each province intended to be a regional community, to which were given decentralized powers. Yet, the Districts continued to define administrative and political control, much like the organization of public security for the State, limiting the powers of local government. This organizational structure for the territory resulted in a loss of the sense of regional identity, which was only kept alive by oral traditions, based on regional references of origin.

There was a substantial difference between the European provinces and regions and the overseas colonies (the so-called &quot;overseas provinces&quot;).

Following the Carnation Revolution, the regions and provinces were abolished and the districts became the second level administrative regions.

==== Overseas ====

The term &quot;overseas province&quot; started to be used to designate each of the Portuguese overseas territories, instead of the previous &quot;overseas dominion&quot;, during the administrative reforms of the beginning of the 19th century, following the idea that these territories were as part of Portugal as the Portuguese European provinces. In the beginning of the 20th century, most of these territories started to be referred as &quot;colonies&quot;, although the term &quot;overseas provinces&quot; continued also to be used. Only after 1951, the term &quot;colony&quot; was completely dropped and the term &quot;overseas province&quot; was exalted by the government of António de Oliveira Salazar to shift the attention of anti-colonial protests in the United Nations. But the history of extra-local territories (colonies or provinces) within Portuguese administration dates back to the first settlements along the African coast, South-east Asia and Brazil, and were instituted as part of the 1832 reforms. The initiatives envisioned a comprehensive series of provinces that would have included European Portugal, archipelagos and extra-local dependencies in Southeast Asia, Africa and India. These colonies included:
* Portuguese West Africa: an overseas province between 1951 and 1975, when it became the independent nation of Angola;
* Cape Verde: an overseas province between 1951 and 1974, autonomous republic between 1974 and 1975, when it became an independent nation;
* Portuguese Guinea: an overseas province between 1951 and 1974, until unilaterally declaring independence as Guinea-Bissau in 1973 (later recognised by Portugal in 1974);
* Macau: overseas province between 1844 and 1883; included many of the overseas provinces of South-east Asia with Portuguese Timor in the administration of Goa, between 1883 and 1951); an overseas province between 1951 and 1975; special territory between 1975 and 1999, before being returned to China as a special administrative region in 1999;
* Portuguese East Africa: overseas province between 1951 and 1974); local administration between 1974 and 1975, before it became the independent nation of Mozambique;
* Portuguese India: an overseas province between 1946 and 1962, it was annexed by India in 1962 (and later recognised by Portugal in 1974);
* São Tomé and Príncipe: an overseas province between 1951 and 1971); local administration between 1971 and 1975, before it became an independent nation in 1975;
* Portuguese Timor: an overseas territory between 1951 and 1961, until unilaterally declaring independence as East Timor in 1975, it was annexed by Indonesia in 1976, recognised by UN as non-self-governing-territory under Portuguese administration between 1961 and 1999. After 1999 it was a United Nations protectorate until formal independence in 2002.
Initially the population of these overseas territories were made to exploit resources (minerals, spices, wood or slaves), but later there was a sense of evangelisation or &quot;lusotropolicalism&quot;, that facilitated the colonization of these lands. The first significant colony was Brazil whose history included a period as kingdom within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves (1815–1822), before a political schism would result in its independence in 1822.

== NUTS ==


The Eurostat-based NUTS system subdivides the nation into three levels: NUTS I, NUTS II and NUTS III. In some European partners, as is the case with Portugal, a complementary hierarchy, respectively LAU I and LAU II (posteriorly referred to as NUTS IV and NUTS V) is employed. The LAU, or &quot;Local Administrative Units&quot;, in the Portuguese context pertains to the 308 municipalities (LAU I) and 4257 civil parishes (LAU II) respectively. In the broadest sense, the NUTS hierarchy, while they may follow some of the borders (municipal or parish) diverge in their delineation.

<text>The Tomorrow People is a British children&#x27;s science fiction television series created by Roger Price. Produced by Thames Television for the ITV Network, the series first ran from 30 April 1973 to 19 February 1979.

The theme music was composed by Australian music composer Dudley Simpson, who composed music for two BBC science fiction dramas, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (1963) and &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; (1978).

In 1992, after having much success with running episodes of the original series in the U.S., Nickelodeon requested Price and Thames Television for a new version to be piloted and filmed at Nickelodeon Studios Florida in April 1992, with Price acting as executive producer. This version used the same basic premise as the original series with some changes and ran until 8 March 1995. A series of audio plays using the original concept and characters (and many of the original series&#x27; actors) was produced by Big Finish Productions between 2001 and 2007. In 2013, an American remake of the show premiered on The CW.

==Premise==
All incarnations of the show concerned the emergence of the next stage of human evolution (&quot;Homo novis&quot;) known colloquially as &quot;Tomorrow People&quot;. Born to human parents, an apparently normal child might at some point between childhood and late adolescence experience a process called &#x27;breaking out&#x27; and develop special paranormal abilities. These abilities include psionic powers such as telepathy, telekinesis, and teleportation. However, their psychological make-up prevents them from intentionally killing others.

==Original series (1970s)==


The original series was produced by Thames Television for ITV. The Tomorrow People operate from a secret base, &quot;The Lab&quot;, built in an abandoned London Underground station. The team constantly watches for new Tomorrow People &quot;breaking out&quot; (usually around the age of puberty) to help them through the process as the youngsters endure mental agonies as their minds suddenly change. They sometimes deal with attention from extraterrestrial species as well as facing more earthbound dangers with military forces across the globe keen to recruit or capture them for their own ends. One thing they lack is the capability to intentionally take another life. This pacifistic element of their make up is referred to as the &quot;prime barrier&quot; and any Tomorrow Person who causes the loss of a human life would be driven insane by the confusion in their brain. They also have connections with the &quot;Galactic Federation&quot; which oversees the welfare of telepathic species throughout the galaxy. In addition to their psychic powers (the so-called 3T&#x27;s of telepathy, telekinesis and teleportation), they use advanced technology such as the biological (called in the series &quot;biotronic&quot;) computer TIM, which is capable of original thought, telepathy, and can augment their psychic powers. TIM also helps the Tomorrow People to teleport long distances, although they must be wearing a device installed into a belt or bracelet for this to work. Teleportation is referred to as &quot;jaunting&quot; in the programme. The team used jaunting belts up to the end of Series 5, after which they used much smaller wristbands.

In the original series, the Tomorrow People are also referred to as both &quot;Homo novis&quot; and &quot;Homo superior&quot;. The term appeared in David Bowie&#x27;s 1971 song &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot;: &quot;Let me make it plain. You gotta make way for the Homo Superior.&quot; This term came up as part of a conversation between Roger Price and David Bowie at a meeting at Granada Studios in Manchester when Price was directing a programme in which Bowie was appearing. Price had been working on a script for his Tomorrow People project and during a conversation with Bowie, the term &quot;Homo superior&quot; came up. Bowie liked the term and soon afterwards wrote it into his song. Price has sometimes been quoted as saying that the lyrics to this song were inspired by the series.

Alistair McGown of Screenonline cites the book &quot;The Mind in Chains&quot; by Christopher Evans as a primary source. Evans also became a scientific advisor for the series. He was credited as such on every single episode but most people working on the show seem to recall that he only had involvement in the first couple of series. McGown also suggests a similarity between &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; and the children&#x27;s fantasy fiction of Enid Blyton.

While they reveal their existence to some, the Tomorrow People generally operate in secrecy for fear that normal people (whom they term &quot;Saps&quot;, an abbreviation of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) will either fear or victimise them because of their special powers, or try to exploit them for military purposes. In order to defend themselves they must use non-lethal weaponry such as &quot;stun guns&quot; or martial arts; this is owing to their genetic unwillingness to kill, referred to as the &quot;prime barrier&quot;. In early series they had the aid of &quot;Sap&quot; friends such as Ginge, Lefty and Chris who usually handled the rougher stuff that the pacifist TPs could not deal with. Also, in the second and third series, they became friendly with a psychic researcher named Professor Cawston who assisted them and vice versa.

Roger Price dreamed up the idea in 1970; he initially offered the format to Granada, where he was working, but was turned down so offered it to Southern Television, who expressed an interest but had concerns over the budgetary requirements. Finally, Lewis Rudd at Thames Television commissioned a 13-episode series, having seen the potential of the format and looking to replace &quot;Ace of Wands&quot; after its three-year run. At this time, ITV was keen to find its own answer to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, although Price never really envisaged the show as such but more as an outlet for his own personal ideas and beliefs. Very early on, Ruth Boswell was brought in as associate producer and script editor as she had experience of children&#x27;s fantasy drama (&quot;Timeslip&quot; and &quot;Tightrope&quot;) while TV dramatist Brian Finch was hired to co-write the scripts as Price had little experience of writing drama. Finch disliked the experience as he was not engaged by the material and found a large part of his time was taken up in trying to rein in Price and his very ambitious ideas. Thames enlisted the services of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; director Paul Bernard to help set up and oversee the first series. He was credited as director for two stories but was unofficially a third producer. Bernard was very heavily involved in the creation of the memorable title sequence which involved a mixture of haunting images and facial shots of the main cast zooming towards the camera in monochrome, with an eerie theme tune from prolific &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Blake’s 7&quot; composer Dudley Simpson playing behind. He got inspiration from seeing billboards rushing towards him when driving. The sequence opened with a clenched fist opening out to signify a telepathic mind breaking out. Amongst the next shots were a human foetus, shadowy figures behind scaffolding and even the insides of a bell pepper (a somewhat exotic fruit in the UK in the 1970s).

Over its six-year run, the format proved flexible enough to encompass various types of stories including traditional alien invasions adventures as well as espionage thrillers, slapstick comedy, time travel, political satires, space opera and even on occasion more adult concepts than would be normally found in a teatime drama for children. As it was aimed at young people, it often reflected popular fashions and fads of the time, but usually with a suitable sinister twist. For example, &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Last Secret&quot; in 1978 involved the TPs investigating a sudden craze for wearing Nazi uniforms amongst teenagers (reflecting the actions of the then contemporary punk rockers) but was a precursor to Hitler being revived from suspended animation by a group of Nazis. The following season&#x27;s &quot;The Living Skins&quot; saw aliens transforming themselves into fashionable plastic jump suits that would control and eventually kill the millions of people who wear them. The 1974 adventure &quot;The Blue and the Green&quot; saw the whole of humanity divided by a craze to wear blue or green badges for a children&#x27;s show. In 1977 Mike joins a pop band, &quot;The Heart of Sogguth&quot;, whose hell-raising music will bring back the Devil when millions of teenagers are watching them on television. The popularity of the book &quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot; was also an influence on 1975&#x27;s &quot;Worlds Away&quot; when it is revealed that the evil Kulthan had controlled and assisted the ancient Egyptians.

===Series One===
Price saw the lead casting as very important, as he wanted talented and attractive actors who would appeal to the young audience, but also be personable and easy to work with during the long hours envisaged in studio or out on location. Nicholas Young was cast as the group&#x27;s leader, John, while Peter Vaughan Clarke was offered the role of Stephen after Price saw him in a Manchester rendition of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; with Lulu. Ruth Boswell wanted Lynne Frederick (later the last wife of Peter Sellers) for Carol, the female lead, but following a meeting with her, Paul Bernard felt she was a bit too upper-class and precious for what he had in mind, as he saw the character as being similar to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s Jo Grant. They finally settled on Sammie Winmill who was relatively well-known for playing Nurse Crumpton on the popular &quot;Doctor at Large&quot; situation comedy (also a Thames production). The role of Kenny, the youngest TP, was given to Stephen Salmon after he had been discovered in a drama workshop while theatre actor Philip Gilbert was selected to provide the paternal tones of biotronic computer TIM. Making up the team were two Sap friends, a couple of bikers called Ginge (Michael Standing) and Lefty (Derek Crewe) who encounter the Tomorrow People when acting as henchmen for the villainous shape-shifter Jedikiah in the opening adventure. Stephen would be very much the show&#x27;s hero and focus for the audience while John was something of an authoritarian figure who took his responsibilities for the species&#x27; future and welfare very seriously. Young was the only TP to be in every single episode and the actor was able to have some say in the production of later seasons as he was considered as an unofficial producer. Kenny was given very little to do and was often left behind in the Lab (due to being the youngest) while the others went off to have the actual adventures. Filming commenced in March 1973 with location work in Muswell Hill. Production of this first story, &quot;The Slaves of Jedikiah&quot; was much troubled, as the crew found they were unfamiliar with the technical demands of a science fiction drama. The first day in studio was disastrous, with virtually no usable material getting made and there was some tension between the cast and Paul Bernard, who was very authoritarian with them. Also, Nicholas Young banged himself hard into a wall while working on the darkened entrance to the Lab, which was being filmed inside the real disused tube station at Wood Lane (closed in the 1940s). Fortunately, he was not badly injured and able to carry on later that day after a recovery break.

Early publicity included a photo session of the cast with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; star Jon Pertwee to indicate a friendly rivalry between the two shows. &quot;Look-in&quot; provided a great deal of coverage of the series and by July launched its own comic strip version (which ran on and off in its pages for the next five years). &quot;TVTimes&quot; also promoted the new show with an article on its first week.

The production procedure was very much standard in the seventies with a limited amount of location work (done on film) followed by a day in studio to record each episode on videotape. Even for the time, some of the special effects of the show were considered sub-par, largely attributable to its small budget. The first season was budgeted at approx £5000 per episode which was roughly half the cost of what the BBC were making &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for. Most directors on the show relied heavily on chroma key to get their desired effects, but, owing to the rushed time on studio days, the results varied greatly. To make it even more difficult, studio time was restricted as English law dictated that juvenile actors could only work a certain number of hours in a day.

Season one&#x27;s recurring villain, Jedikiah, was originally devised to be a long-running foe (like the Master from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;), but after seeing the poorly-designed robot that was the shape-changer&#x27;s true form, an unimpressed Price elected not to use the character again until the finale of series three which was planned at that time as the series&#x27; finale (the robotic form noticeably fails to appear). Despite these limitations, the series proved popular with its young audience who watched in large numbers, even denting the figures for the popular BBC magazine programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot;.

===Series Two ===

The success of the first series saw another 13 episodes go into production quite soon after, but with a number of changes. Off-screen, both Bernard and Finch departed leaving Price to take more control as writer, director and producer, while on-screen Kenny and Carol disappeared (sent to the Galactic Federation&#x27;s headquarters The Trig to work as ambassadors for Earth). Salmon was simply not asked back as there was a feeling the character had failed to work and his acting was considered wooden (plus Salmon had never been very keen to appear as he had no interest in acting), while Winmill&#x27;s departure was voluntary as the actress was concerned about being associated with a long running series. In their place came student school teacher Elizabeth M&#x27;Bondo, portrayed by Elizabeth Adare. Adare initially thought her character was to be a teenage girl and made every effort at her audition to look and act like an adolescent. However, Price and Boswell were suitably impressed to change the Elizabeth character so that she breaks out at an older age due to a latent puberty. Elizabeth is uncovered by Stephen when working at his school, where she is doing her teacher training. This was the start of a near-annual event where a new TP was introduced in the first story of each series—a handy way of maintaining interest for returning viewers and a convenient way for Price to re-establish the basic premise of the show for new audiences every year. Adare stayed until the end in 1979 but grew increasingly unhappy with the quality of later scripts. However, she knew how important and ground-breaking it was for a black actress to be the female lead in a British TV production, so she decided to remain.

Filming of Series 2 began in late 1973 with Michael Standing returning as Ginge, but on the first day he fell off his motorbike and broke his leg, prompting a speedy rewrite whereby Ginge&#x27;s younger brother, Chris (Chris Chittell), was now seen as the new Sap regular. Chris was mentioned in the dialogue as already being known to the Tomorrow People, so little in the way of changes had to be made to the script. Ginge&#x27;s absence was explained on-screen by his having been admitted to hospital following a fall from his motorbike, reflecting Standing&#x27;s real-life accident. Price later commented that he felt neither Ginge or Lefty had ever felt right for the format.

=== Series Three ===

In 1975, the third series added Dean Lawrence as gypsy Tyso Boswell, yet another character from a minority as Price was determined that the Tomorrow People could be from any ethnic or society background. Chris disappears after only appearing in one episode (his absence is never explained) while telepathic secret agent Tricia Conway appears in two stories before fully breaking out in the series climax which saw the young heroes menaced by old rival, Jedikiah. Viewers saw on screen why the youngsters have to maintain their secrecy and constant vigilance from the rest of humanity, as the British Secret Intelligence Service ruthlessly hunt them down for their own purposes in the opening adventure. This series also saw the group visit an alien world for the first time when the Galactic Trig dispatches them to help the telepathic population of the planet Peerie. Production on this story ran into trouble when Lawrence hurt his knee during location filming and the injury had to be included in the script.

A comedy script was attempted in the much-derided &quot;A Man for Emily&quot;, which featured Peter Davison in his television debut and his future wife Sandra Dickinson, because Price was keen to get more into humorous writing. The negative backlash to this experiment resulted in a planned sequel story being quietly dropped; however, such actions added to Price&#x27;s increasing frustration with the show. Philip Gilbert also made the first of several on-screen appearances as Timus Irnok Mosta, an ambassador from the Galactic Federation who had a hand in building TIM thus sounding alike. Timus was a clone and his brother, Tikno, also appears. They made semi-regular appearances until the final story in 1979, and they helped fulfil a clause in Gilbert&#x27;s contract that he had to be seen or heard at least once every episode. As stated, old enemy Jedikiah made a dramatic return to exact revenge in the last story. It ends with an air of finality as the Tomorrow People (including the just broken out Trisha Conway), having only just survived the encounter (at one point John, Elizabeth and Tikno are violently gunned down and left barely alive), decide to leave Earth for the Galactic Trig with only a vague, haunting promise from Elizabeth that they will return...sometime.

=== Series Four ===

By now, Price had become tired of his creation and attempted to end it by killing off the leads at the conclusion to Series 3, but Ruth Boswell made him rewrite it so that they survived. Thames Television had a ratings winner (as well as excellent overseas sales) and insisted he continue the programme, albeit in shorter, staggered seasons from now on. Price only ever allowed one attempt by another writer to work on it solo, with John E. Watkins penning the story &quot;Into the Unknown&quot; broadcast in early 1976. Price was not satisfied with the final episodes and decided he would be sole writer from that point on. Having fewer episodes to write every year, Price would have more time to work on his comedic and light-entertainment productions, which he enjoyed more than the demanding sci-fi drama. At the start of the fourth series he attempted to give a boost to the format with the introduction of teenage idol Mike Holoway as Mike Bell. Holoway was the drummer with pop band Flintlock who were the regular house band on Price&#x27;s &quot;You Must Be Joking&quot;, and Price hoped that his young charge would be Britain&#x27;s answer to Donny Osmond or David Cassidy. Mike&#x27;s arrival swells the ranks of TPs in the Lab to five (Tricia had remained on the Trig, due to Ann Courthoys&#x27; departure from the series) which made things look a bit overcrowded, this led to the decision to sack Vaughan-Clarke as Stephen, who ignobly disappears off screen after the season finished and is never even mentioned again. Mike was now very much being touted as the show&#x27;s hero and with this change, it was noticeable that John and Elizabeth took on a more parental role as both actors entered their mid-20s. Tyso also vanished after the fourth year, but his character had been mostly redundant for some time due to not having been written into scripts that year. His late inclusion was only addressed a couple of weeks before filming started when Price discovered from Lawrence that he was still available to appear in the programme (he had been led to believe that he had moved abroad). This meant Tyso only had limited screen time and very few lines. What scenes Tyso was in he was either the butt of a joke, or in a position where he was rarely pleased to be seen. Anne Curthoys was asked back to play Tricia, but was committed to a daytime soap at Thames.

=== Series Five ===

Vic Hughes took over as producer for Series 5, which began transmission in early 1977 and was the only series not to introduce a new Tomorrow person (although the first story does feature a potential TP in doomed Russian teenager, Pavla). All three adventures were two-parters which allowed Price to write them quickly and remove any unwanted excess padding which tended to slow down the action. Mike Holoway was now very much the star of the show as on screen, Mike developed into the resident hero guided by an increasingly parental John and Elizabeth. His band Flintlock even appeared in the closing adventure, &quot;The Heart of Sogguth&quot;. From this season on, Price was only be credited as the writer but he retained overall control of the series and was very heavily involved in major decisions.

=== Series Six ===

1978 saw changes being made, starting with Elizabeth&#x27;s absence through most of Series 6 due to Elizabeth Adare&#x27;s pregnancy (on screen Elizabeth is working on diplomatic missions for the Galactic Federation and appears only briefly on a screen so as to hide the actress&#x27;s condition). In her place came Hsui Tai, played by Japanese actress Misako Koba, whose poor grasp of English made her hard to understand, and Nicholas Young later recalled that he and other actors found this difficult during production. Koba had no previous acting experience and had been suggested for the role by her actor husband. A new Lab set was introduced with a smaller but now mobile TIM and the jaunting belts were replaced by the rather cheap looking jaunting bands (worn on the wrists). These changes were forced on the production team following a fire at the Thames storerooms. The new Lab acted as both base and home for the Tomorrow People as they were now seen to be sleeping in their own cabins there. It was noticeably smaller than the previous set, which freed up more space in the studio for the designers to utilise on other sets. The 6 episodes were produced sporadically through 1977 (a combination of Price writing scripts as and when it fitted with his other production commitments and a number of strikes at ITV over the year) and finally launched in the Spring of 78. Such was Holoway&#x27;s popularity that he was featured on the cover of TV Times to promote the start of the season.

=== Series Seven ===

Series 7 in late 1978 introduced another Tomorrow person in the form of young Scottish lad Andrew Forbes (Nigel Rhodes). Rhodes had previously worked as an extra on &quot;A Much Needed Holiday&quot;, but became more known to Price when he worked on his 1977 comedy series, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Be Serious&quot;. The young actor was delighted to win the role, as he was a great fan of the show. Andrew is introduced after he starts using his psychic powers to conjure up images of ghosts so as to provide a tourism attraction for the hotel owned by his father. Elizabeth also returned from her year on the Trig.

=== Series Eight and cancellation ===

With inflation out of control in the late-1970s, the budget was stretched to breaking point, a factor which was constantly on the mind of producer Vic Hughes. A dispute over the allocation of studio days ended the show in 1979 when Hughes attempted to gain an extra studio day for the planned ninth series (which fell victim to the ITV strike that summer) following numerous problems during the production of &quot;War of the Empires&quot; (the sole four-part adventure that made up series 8) which had been given only four days in studio. This was partially due to a very ambitious script that, with its numerous space battles, was heavily influenced by &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Also by this point, Price had emigrated to America after being headhunted to help set up children&#x27;s channel Nickelodeon, and Thames was reluctant to carry on without him. Whatever the reason, it finally vanished after a short repeat run in early 1980.

===Cast===

* TIM (voice of Philip Gilbert) is a biological computer, programmed with an artificially created intelligence, whose tubes are filled with &quot;bio-fluid&quot;. He was partially built by John, the leader of the Tomorrow People, and was given to them by the &quot;Galactic Council&quot;. TIM is housed in &quot;The Lab&quot;, situated in a disused station in the London Underground. TIM often helps out the Tomorrow People by providing vital information, which the telepaths can use in their current adventure. TIM&#x27;s voice is identical to that of diplomat Timus Irnok Mosta from the Galactic Federation, because Timus&#x27; clone-brother Tykno is the premier AI scientist of the Federation and all Federation AI&#x27;s have their voice.
* John (Nicholas Young) – Aged 17, John is the leader of the Tomorrow People. He is an inventor and scientist. He built &quot;The Lab&quot; and the biological computer, TIM, with some help from the Galactic Council. John was the first Tomorrow Person to &quot;break out&quot; and had no guidance through the process.
* Carol (Sammie Winmill, season 1) – Along with John and Kenny, Carol had been monitoring Stephen, as he had been unconsciously tuning into their thoughts, via telepathy. When Stephen collapses and is taken to hospital, John sends Carol to help him &quot;break out&quot;. 
* Kenny (Stephen Salmon, season 1), at 12, is the youngest of the original four Tomorrow People. According to Carol, he &quot;&quot;broke out&quot; when he was very young. He is always left behind to look after The Lab.
* Stephen Jameson (Peter Vaughan-Clarke, seasons 1-4) is the first Tomorrow Person to &quot;break out&quot;&quot; on screen. At first he finds it hard to believe that he &quot;is&quot; a Tomorrow Person, but soon comes to accept this. Like other Tomorrow People, Stephen possesses various psychic abilities. The primary powers of all telepaths are &quot;&quot;jaunting&quot;&quot;, the ability instantaneously to transport oneself from one place to another, telepathy, the ability to read the minds of other Tomorrow People and telekinesis, the ability to move objects with the power of the mind.
* Jedikiah (Francis de Wolff and Roger Bizley) is &quot;a fierce, shape-changing alien robot,&quot; initially seen (in &quot;The Slaves of Jedikiah&quot;) in the service of the &quot;Cyclops&quot; (later discovered to be &#x27;Ranesh&#x27;), who uses Jedikiah to capture the Tomorrow People in an effort to use their psi powers to enable the Cyclops&#x27; damaged ship to return home. By the end of the serial, Jedikiah had been damaged and jettisoned into space. By the time he is recovered (in &quot;The Medusa Strain&quot;), 500 years had passed, and the damage caused to Jedikiah in the previous story, coupled with this long isolation, had driven the robot insane, possessing a pathological hatred of the Tomorrow People. He has since devoted his existence to their destruction. However, in &quot;The Revenge of Jedikiah&quot;, in which the character made his final appearance, he was stripped of his shape-shifting powers by Timus and the Galactic Federation and condemned to labour on Earth forever as a homeless derelict.
* Elizabeth M&#x27;Bondo – (Elizabeth Adare, seasons 2-8) Elizabeth is the first addition to the original line-up, introduced at the beginning of the second season. She is a student teacher at Stephen&#x27;s school and is said to be the same age as John. She often brings a sense of compassion to the Tomorrow People and is one of the few people capable of standing up to John, notably in &quot;The Doomsday Men&quot; when she convinces him to save stranded astronaut Lee, as well as facing down several villains. Towards the end of the series, she becomes more involved in galactic affairs and spends a lot of time at the Galactic Trig, including the whole of season six.
* Tyso Boswell – (Dean Lawrence, seasons 3-4) Tyso is introduced at the start of the third season. He comes from a gypsy background and has a number of younger siblings. The Tomorrow People first encounter him when he is captured by Colonel Masters. He forms a partnership with Stephen in some stories and takes a cheeky attitude towards many of the situations in which the Tomorrow People find themselves.
* Patricia Conway – (Anne Curthoys, season 3) Tricia is a telepath working for Colonel Masters at the Experimental Weapons Establishment, who appears in &quot;Secret Weapon&quot; and &quot;Revenge of Jedikiah&quot;. She is initially at odds with the Tomorrow People, seeking to capture them and force them to work for British Intelligence. After Masters&#x27; death, she allies with the Tomorrow People against Jedikiah. She hears Stephen&#x27;s telepathic cry for help, causing her to break out and jaunt to the lab. Afterwards, she goes to work at the Trig.
* Mike Bell – (Mike Holoway, seasons 4-8) Mike is a working class Cockney who lives with his mother and sister. He is introduced at the start of season four when a group of London criminals try to force him to use his powers to help them commit crimes. Although loyal to the Tomorrow People, he is less willing than some of the others blindly to follow John&#x27;s orders and they often clash. In later series, he occasionally takes on a leadership role when John and Elizabeth are absent, notably in &quot;War of the Empires&quot;.
* Pavla Vlasova – (Anulka Dziubinska) Pavla is a Russian telepath who appears in &quot;The Dirtiest Business&quot;. She has been abducted by the KGB and forced to work for them, and escapes from her handlers during a trip to London. The Tomorrow People try to find and help her but she is killed when the KGB detonate a micro-explosive planted in her body, to prevent her giving away their secrets.
* Hsui Tai – (Misako Koba, seasons 6-8) Hsui Tai is a girl in her mid teens around the same age as Mike, introduced at the start of the sixth season. She is one of the living child goddesses worshipped by a sect of Chinese monks, who are sacrificed and supposedly reincarnated when they reach adulthood. After John and Mike put an end to the practice, Hsui Tai joins them in the lab. She adapts reasonably well to western ways but still encounters cultural difficulties on occasion.
* Andrew Forbes – (Nigel Rhodes, seasons 7-8) Andrew is a Scottish boy who lives in a hotel run by his father. He gains the ability to project illusions and uses them to convince people the hotel is haunted in order to attract guests. His father initially believes he is possessed by a demon until the Tomorrow People get in touch and explain what Andrew is. Afterwards, he splits his time between the Tomorrow People and helping his father at the hotel.
* Peter - (Richard Speight, seasons 1-2) – Peter is a Telepath from the 26th century, who refers to the current Tomorrow People as &quot;Homo novus&quot; (&quot;New man&quot;). Appearing as a teenaged boy, it is later revealed that he is 163 years old.
* Timus – (Philip Gilbert) Timus Irnok Mosta is a maverick Galactic Federation diplomat and ally of the Tomorrow People. As revealed in the episode &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;, Timus has sixty-four cloned brothers, including Tikno, who is also an ally of the Tomorrow People and the mentioned, but unseen Timon, who was the creator of TIM. 
* Zenon – (Stephen Jack) Zenon is the grandfather of Peter who appears in &quot;A Rift in Time&quot;. Stephen encounters him while looking for Peter and Zenon gives him the ability to travel into the past.
* Ginger &#x27;Ginge&#x27; Harding – (Michael Standing, season 1) Ginge is the leader of a biker gang who are hired by Jedikiah. He initially hunts the Tomorrow People but when he learns Jedikiah&#x27;s true nature he changes sides. He is a regular fixture at the lab during the first season and often helps the Tomorrow People out with their problems. He is physically strong but occasionally shows a lack of intelligence.
* Lefty – (Derek Crewe, season 1) Lefty is Ginger&#x27;s sidekick. Like him, he is allied first with Jedikiah and then the Tomorrow People. He is somewhat dimwitted but occasionally seems more sensible than Ginge. He appears in &quot;The Slaves of Jedikiah&quot; and &quot;The Vanishing Earth&quot;.
* Chris Harding – (Chris Chittell, season 2) Chris is Ginger&#x27;s younger brother, who replaces him as the Tomorrow People&#x27;s human ally. Although often used for comic relief, he is quite intelligent, providing the solution to a problem on occasion notably in &quot;Secret Weapon&quot;, and accompanies the Tomorrow People on a trip back in time in &quot;A Rift in Time&quot;. He disappears after the first story of season three.
* Professor Cawston – (Bryan Stanyon, seasons 2-3) Cawston is a parapsychology professor who Stephen shows some of his powers to in order to get access to a vase kept at his university. He later discovers Tyso, who is in the process of breaking out, and unwittingly brings him to the attention of Colonel Masters. The Tomorrow People contact him and explain who they are, and he becomes their ally against Masters and later Jedikiah.

===Merchandise===
A comic-strip version, based on the original series, was also produced, written by Angus P. Allan and printed in TV comic &quot;Look-In&quot; that ran somewhat concurrently with the 1970s series. Piccolo Books also released five tie-in novels during the seventies: &quot;The Visitor&quot; (1973), &quot;Three into Three&quot; (1974), &quot;Four into Three&quot; (1975), &quot;One Law&quot; (1976) and &quot;Lost Gods&quot; (1977). In 1978, there was also a children&#x27;s annual. &quot;The Visitor&quot; was written before production began on the series and offers a glimpse of some of the original ideas for the show that never made it to screen. Most interesting is that the Tomorrow People contact TIM via wrist communicators, as the computer is non-telepathic while the characters of Ginge and Lefty are portrayed as much younger characters than they were on screen. Also the Lab is accessed from the back of a regular Tube station.

==Revivals==

===1990s series: (1992–1995)===

Price produced the 1990s revival of &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; for Tetra Films (an independent production company, mostly comprising the former children&#x27;s department at Thames Television) in association with the Thames-owned American company Reeves Entertainment for Thames and Nickelodeon between 1992 and 1995 (broadcast by Central in 1994 and 1995 on ITV as Thames had lost its franchise at the end of 1992). After some pressure from executives, Price decided to start with a blank slate and so the show was almost completely different from its predecessor. The original cast, characters, and music were not used. The new series incorporated a multi-national cast to ensure that worldwide syndication sales would be easier to obtain. Each story is five episodes long, unlike the 1970s show, which never had a story that long after &quot;The Blue and the Green&quot; in the second season.

The distinctive belt buckles were omitted, as the new Tomorrow People were able to teleport without them. The non-lethal stun guns and other gadgetry were also done away with. The new Tomorrow People relied more on their wits and powers to get out of trouble.

There remain some analogies, however. &quot;The Lab&quot; was replaced by a psychic spaceship in the South Pacific to which Tomorrow People are drawn when they &quot;break out&quot;. &quot;TIM&quot; is replaced by an ostensibly mute computer that is part of the alien ship. The visual effects were improved considerably by effects artist Clive Davis compared to the original series, along with sets.

The lead role of Adam Newman was given to Kristian Schmid, who at the time was famous in the UK for his regular role in &quot;Neighbours&quot;. The other original stars were Kristen Ariza as Lisa Davies, Adam Pearce (who had no previous acting experience) as Kevin Wilson and Christian Tessier as Kevin&#x27;s American friend Marmaduke &quot;Megabyte&quot; Damon. The 1992 season consisted of a single five-part story written by Price, which had no on-screen title but was named as &quot;The Origin Story&quot; in the DVD release. Adam is newly broken out as the series begins with Lisa and Kevin breaking out simultaneously in the first episode. Megabyte also breaks out in the last episode of the story. The plotline borrowed heavily from the 1975 story &quot;Secret Weapon&quot;, even reusing the name of that story&#x27;s villain Colonel Masters, and involved the intelligence services pursuing the Tomorrow People in order to use them for their own ends. The story also introduced Jeff Harding as Megabyte&#x27;s father General Damon, an American officer stationed in the United Kingdom, who became a regular ally to the Tomorrow People.

The second season was filmed in 1993 and began transmitting in January 1994, with Price now credited as executive producer and the writing handed over to Grant Cathro and Lee Pressman, who had previously experience writing CITV&#x27;s other children&#x27;s fantasy series &quot;T-Bag&quot; and &quot;Mike and Angelo&quot;. The seasons were expanded to ten episodes, comprising two five-part stories. Cathro and Pressman plotted the stories together then scripted one each (for the second season they were credited as co-writers, for the third they were only credited on the story they scripted). They chose to power down the Tomorrow People slightly, since the first story had shown Lisa reviving from the dead at one point. The lengthy scenes on the island where the ship was located from the first season were dropped, with the ship exterior only seen in stock establishing shots and the Tomorrow People now teleporting directly into the ship when they broke out rather than the ocean around it.

Lisa was dropped without explanation and Kevin&#x27;s role was severely reduced, with him only appearing in three episodes of the first story and spending most of his time comatose before also being dropped with no explanation. As a result, the series now focused on Adam and Megabyte, two characters who had not interacted in the first season, and their relationship soon mirrored than between John and Stephen in the original series. Breaking out in the opening episode of the season was Ami Jackson, played by Naomie Harris. Her mother, played by Sally Sagoe, had a small role in the remaining stories, initially trying to stop Ami spending time with the Tomorrow People before accepting her need to use her powers to help others. The first story of the second season, &quot;The Culex Experiment&quot;, guest starred Jean Marsh as the villainous Doctor Culex.

The third season debuted the following year: The opening story, &quot;The Rameses Connection&quot;, guest starred Christopher Lee as lead villain Sam Rees/Rameses. It saw the first example of the phrase &quot;breaking out&quot; being used and of the Tomorrow People&#x27;s powers being blocked, when Rameses prevents Adam from teleporting, both key features of the 1970s show. The second story, &quot;The Living Stones&quot;, only featured Ami in a small role in the first episode, with her absence explained as her being on holiday with her mother. Instead, Jade Weston, a minor character from &quot;The Culex Experiment&quot; played by Alexandra Milman, was brought back to accompany Adam and Megabyte and broke out as a Tomorrow Person in the last episode. This story featured the first use of aliens in the 1990s series, as the Tomorrow People battled a group of alien spores which had crashed near a village and possessed most of the villagers. Shortly after this, it was announced that the show would not be returning for a fourth season.

===Audio revival===
In 2001, Big Finish Productions launched a series of new audio plays based on the original series, produced by Nigel Fairs. Nicholas Young and Philip Gilbert reprised their roles as John and TIM, with Helen Goldwyn and James Daniel Wilson appearing as Elena and Paul, the new Tomorrow People. Some releases also feature other original cast members, such as Peter Vaughan-Clarke, Elizabeth Adare and Mike Holoway (notably &quot;Trigonometry&quot;). Trevor Littledale took over the role of TIM in the audio series from &quot;The Warlock&#x27;s Dance&quot; onwards after Philip Gilbert&#x27;s death in 2004.

Five series were produced of the audio series. It was cancelled in December 2007 because of the discontinuation of a licensing arrangement with Fremantle Media Enterprises. CDs of the series were permanently withdrawn from sale on 7 January 2008. However, the CDs are often still available from online sellers such as Amazon and eBay, and at science fiction conventions.

===2013 American series===

In November 2012, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; announced that Julie Plec and Greg Berlanti had obtained the rights to &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; and commissioned a pilot written by Phil Klemmer. This occurred after a similar rights option expired to an aborted attempt two years previously.

It was announced on 28 January 2013 that the revival had received a pilot order from The CW Television Network. On 21 February 2013, Australian actor Luke Mitchell was cast for the pilot as John Young.

The pilot was picked up as a series on 9 May 2013. It aired on Wednesdays in the 9:00 pm Eastern/8:00 pm Central timeslot following &quot;Arrow&quot;. On 17 March 2014, &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; moved to a permanent Monday night time slot.

On 8 May 2014, just one day shy of its first anniversary of being picked up by the CW, the channel declined to renew &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; for a second season.

===2020s book series===
In 2023 a new series of original, authorised novels was launched by Chinbeard Books and Oak Tree Books to mark the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The first, &quot;The Tomorrow People: Changes&quot; (2023)&quot;,&quot; was written by series creator Roger Price with co-writer Andy Davidson and was followed by a bi-monthly series of novellas: &quot;The First One&quot; (2024) by Gary Russell, &quot;Children of the Evolution (2024)&quot; by Iain McLaughlin, &quot;Homo Inferior&quot; (2024) by Nigel Fairs, &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; (2025) by Rebecca Levene and David Derbyshire, &quot;A New Beginning&quot; (2025) by Joseph Lidster and &quot;The Last One&quot; (2025) by Gary Russell.

==Documentaries==
In October 2005, Fantom Films and First Time Films released the 1997 documentary about the series entitled &quot;Beyond Tomorrow&quot;. The documentary features interviews with cast members from the original series, including Nicholas Young (John), Peter Vaughan-Clarke (Stephen), Sammie Winmill (Carol), Elizabeth Adare (Liz), Dean Lawrence (Tyso), Mike Holoway (Mike) and Philip Gilbert.

The following year, Fantom Films released a second DVD discussing the 1990s series with writers Lee Pressman and Grant Cathro, entitled &quot;Re-inventing The Tomorrow People&quot;.

<text>Paul Vernon Hornung (December 23, 1935 – November 13, 2020), nicknamed &quot;the Golden Boy&quot;, was an American professional football halfback and kicker who played for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL) from 1957 to 1966 (except the 1963 NFL season, for which he was suspended after a scandal involving gambling and associating with gamblers).

He played on teams that won four NFL titles and the first Super Bowl. He is the first Heisman Trophy winner to win the NFL Most Valuable Player award, and be inducted into both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame. Packers coach Vince Lombardi stated that Hornung was &quot;the greatest player I ever coached&quot;.

A versatile player, Hornung was a halfback, quarterback and kicker. He was an excellent all-around college athlete at the University of Notre Dame, where he played basketball in addition to football.

==Early life==
Hornung was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. He was the son of Paul Vernon Hornung Sr. and Loretta Williams. He was an outstanding athlete at Flaget High School in Louisville, and lettered all four years in football, basketball, and baseball. He was recruited by Bear Bryant at Kentucky in nearby Lexington, but chose to attend Notre Dame instead.

==College career==
After spending his sophomore season of 1954 as a backup fullback, Hornung blossomed as a halfback and safety during his junior year in 1955. He finished fourth in the nation in total offense with 1,215 yards and six touchdowns. His two touchdowns on offense and two interceptions on defense spurred a victory over No. 4 Navy, and his touchdown pass and field goal beat Iowa. In a loss to Southern California, Hornung ran and threw for 354 yards, the best in the nation in 1955.

In the 1956 season he led his team offensively in passing, rushing, scoring, kickoff and punt returns, and punting. He also played defense, led in passes broken up, and was second in interceptions and tackles made. In spite of Notre Dame&#x27;s 2–8 record, Hornung won the Heisman Trophy in 1956 as the season&#x27;s outstanding college football player – the only time a player from a losing team has been so honored. Nicknamed &quot;The Golden Boy&quot;, the highly versatile quarterback could run, pass, block, and tackle. Many consider Hornung the greatest all-around football player in Notre Dame history.

Hornung also played basketball during his sophomore year at Notre Dame. He has said that he attended Notre Dame in part for the opportunity to play basketball, and that he was asked not to continue playing in order to help keep his grades up.

At the 1957 College All Star game in August in Chicago, Hornung had a famous match race with Abe Woodson. Woodson said, &quot;We had Jim Brown, Jim Parker, John Brodie, Jon Arnett, Len Dawson, Paul Hornung, and Tommy McDonald, with Curly Lambeau and Otto Graham as our coaches, and we still lost 22–7 to the New York Giants. Oh, well.&quot; Just for fun, Woodson, one of the fastest players ever to put on pads, and Hornung agreed to a match race. Hornung won by five yards.

==Professional career==
After graduating from Notre Dame with a degree in business, Hornung was the first selection overall in the 1957 NFL draft. He was taken by the Green Bay Packers, with whom he went on to win four league championships, including the first Super Bowl in January 1967.

Hornung was the only Packer on the roster who did not play in Super Bowl I. A pinched nerve sidelined him, and he chose not to enter the game in the fourth quarter.

As a professional, Hornung played the halfback position as well as field goal kicker for several seasons. Hornung led the league in scoring for three straight seasons from 1959–61. During the 1960 season, the last with just 12 games, he set an all-time record by scoring 176 points. Hornung also passed for two additional touchdowns, which did not add to his point-scoring total. The record stood until the season, when running back LaDainian Tomlinson of the San Diego Chargers broke the record with 180 points by scoring his 30th touchdown on December 17, leaving him with four points more than Hornung&#x27;s record with more than two games to play (but in his 14th game, compared to Hornung&#x27;s 12 games).

In 1961, Hornung tied the scoring record for a player in a postseason game (held by Pat Harder in 1952) with a 19-point effort in the NFL championship game. That record stood for nearly 33 years until Ricky Watters scored 30 points in the 1994 NFC Divisional Round. In Green Bay&#x27;s 1965 championship win, he rushed for 105 yards and a touchdown on a very muddy field against the Cleveland Browns. In October of that same year, he set a record for most points in a calendar month with 77. This was also broken by Tomlinson, who posted 78 points in November 2006.

Hornung was voted the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in 1961 and was chosen as an All-Pro twice and named to the Pro Bowl twice. He is one of only nine players to have won both the Heisman Trophy and the NFL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award. He is also the first player to ever make a 50+ yard fair catch kick, which is a rule that allows a team that has just made a fair catch to attempt a free kick from the spot of the catch. This came in 1964 on September 13, at the end of the first half of the opener against rival (and defending champion) Chicago.

In 1965 the 29 year-old Hornung scored a team-record five touchdowns (three rushing and two pass receptions) in a 42–27 road win over the Baltimore Colts on December 12. Hornung&#x27;s five TD&#x27;s were overshadowed by the record-tying six touchdowns scored by Chicago&#x27;s Gale Sayers later that same day against San Francisco at Wrigley Field. But the Packers&#x27; victory over the Colts proved important for the Packers, as they wound up tied with the Colts in the Western Conference standings at season&#x27;s end (forcing an extra playoff game on December 26 which the Packers won in overtime to advance to the NFL Championship). In that NFL championship game against the Cleveland Browns on January 2, Hornung ran for 105 yards and a touchdown in the Packers&#x27; 23–12 win for their third league title under Lombardi.

A pinched nerve in Hornung&#x27;s neck severely curtailed his playing time in 1966, and Hornung did not see action in Super Bowl I, when the Packers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, 35–10. Hornung was selected in the expansion draft by the New Orleans Saints, who later traded for Hornung&#x27;s backfield mate at Green Bay, Jim Taylor. Hornung never suited up for the Saints, as the neck injury forced him to retire during training camp. Taylor &amp; Hornung were affectionately known as &quot;Thunder &amp; Lightning&quot; by Packer fans of the early 1960s.

Hornung holds the record for most games with 30+ points (2), the most games with 25+ points (3), and the most games with 13 points in a season (8 games in 1960). He also holds the dubious distinction of having missed an NFL record 26 field goals in a season, doing so in 1964.

==Honors and awards==
Hornung was elected to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1975, the College Football Hall of Fame in 1985, the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986, and the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1990. Also, the &quot;Paul Hornung Award&quot; is given out annually to the state of Kentucky&#x27;s top high school player. Starting in 2010, an award named in Hornung&#x27;s honor is given out to the most versatile college football player in the nation. Hornung&#x27;s number 5 was also unofficially retired by Lombardi on July 10, 1967, as there has not been a ceremony to have his number on the wall of retired numbers at Lambeau Field. A large number of his awards and honors, including his Notre Dame diploma, can be found in the basement of a close friend and old Army buddy (Wallace Peters) living in Indiana.

==Off the field==
Hornung was obliged to serve in the U.S. Army and he was called to active duty during the 1961 season, but he was able to get weekend passes to play on Sundays. Head coach Vince Lombardi was a friend of President John F. Kennedy, and a pass was arranged so Hornung could play in the NFL championship game against the New York Giants.

&quot;Sport&quot; magazine named Hornung the most outstanding player in the 1961 championship game, which led to a tax dispute between Hornung and the Internal Revenue Service that cemented the tax status of awards to athletes. Hornung was awarded a 1962 Chevrolet Corvette, but the car&#x27;s fair market value was not included on his tax returns for either 1961 or 1962. The dispute went to the United States Tax Court in the case of &quot;Hornung v. Commissioner&quot;. The court determined that because it would have been impossible for Hornung to take possession of the Corvette in 1961 – the game was played on December 31 in Green Bay and the car was in a closed dealership in New York – the car should have been included in income in 1962. More importantly for the athletic community, the court also determined that awards for achievement in the field of athletics do not fall under the exceptions provided under section 74(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. From this point on, it became impossible for athletes to exclude any awards they are given for athletics from their gross incomes.

Hornung&#x27;s penchant for high-living proved disastrous when, in 1963, a major scandal erupted and Hornung and another of the league&#x27;s top stars, defensive tackle Alex Karras of the Detroit Lions, were suspended from football indefinitely in April 1963 by commissioner Pete Rozelle for betting on NFL games and associating with undesirable persons. Forthright in admitting to his mistake, Hornung&#x27;s image went relatively untarnished, and in 1964 his suspension, and Karras&#x27;s, were re-evaluated by the league and both were reinstated in March.

In a September 2006 interview with Bob Costas, Hornung stated that it was his belief that it was Lombardi&#x27;s constant lobbying of Rozelle that got him reinstated for the 1964 NFL season. In exchange for Lombardi&#x27;s efforts, Hornung agreed not to have anything to do with gambling, to stay out of Las Vegas and to even forgo attending the Kentucky Derby which he had done annually.

Hornung was employed as a color analyst on Minnesota Vikings radio broadcasts from 1970 to 1974, as well as TVS WFL telecasts in 1974, CBS NFL telecasts from 1975 to 1979, and ABC Radio USFL broadcasts from 1983 to 1985. He also worked as a sideline reporter for CBS&#x27; coverage of Super Bowl XII. Hornung did college play-by-play for TigerVision, LSU&#x27;s pay-per-view broadcasts in 1982 with ex-Green Bay Packers teammate Jim Taylor. Hornung also performed color commentary for games on College Football on TBS in the early 1980s.

Upon Rozelle&#x27;s retirement in 1989, Hornung wrote him a letter crediting him with promoting the NFL&#x27;s rise and for having been &quot;the best commissioner of any [sports league]&quot;.

During a radio interview on March 30, 2004, Hornung, speaking about the recent lack of football success at Notre Dame, said, &quot;We can&#x27;t stay as strict as we are as far as the academic structure is concerned because we&#x27;ve got to get the black athletes. We must get the black athletes if we&#x27;re going to compete.&quot; The response was immediate. The University replied, &quot;We strongly disagree with the thesis of his remarks. They are generally insensitive and specifically insulting to our past and current African-American student-athletes.&quot; Famed former Notre Dame head coach Ara Parseghian also disagreed with Hornung, saying that Notre Dame did not lower admission standards for him. Hornung said that he was not differentiating between races. &quot;We need better ball players, black and white, at Notre Dame.&quot;

Hornung&#x27;s lifetime dream was to have a horse compete in the Kentucky Derby. He had a horse on the 2013 Road to the Kentucky Derby by the name of Titletown Five, trained by friend and hall of fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas. Although the horse did not earn enough points to gain entry to the race, the horse was entered in the 2013 Preakness Stakes, finishing last.

Hornung died on November 13, 2020, at the age of 84, in Louisville, Kentucky from dementia, which he felt was caused by multiple concussions. He was survived by his wife of 41 years, Angela (Cervilli) Hornung.

Hornung is one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is caused by repeated hits to the head.

<text>&quot;Wynken, Blynken, and Nod&quot; is a poem for children written by American writer and poet Eugene Field and published on March 9, 1889. The original title was &quot;Dutch Lullaby&quot;. The poem is a fantasy bed-time story about three children sailing and fishing among the stars from a boat which is a wooden shoe. The names suggest a sleepy child&#x27;s blinking eyes and nodding head. The spelling of the names, and the &quot;wooden shoe,&quot; suggest Dutch language and names, as hinted in the original title.

==Text==
&lt;poem&gt;
Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night
 sailed off in a wooden shoe —
Sailed on a river of crystal light,
 into a sea of dew.
&quot;Where are you going, and what do you wish?&quot;
 the old moon asked the three.
&quot;We have come to fish for the herring fish
 that live in this beautiful sea;
Nets of silver and gold have we!&quot;
 said Wynken, Blynken, and Nod.

The old moon laughed and sang a song,
 as they rocked in the wooden shoe,
And the wind that sped them all night long
 ruffled the waves of dew.
The little stars were the herring fish
 that lived in that beautiful sea —
&quot;Now cast your nets wherever you wish —
 never afraid are we&quot;;
So cried the stars to the fishermen three:
 Wynken, Blynken, and Nod.

All night long their nets they threw
 to the stars in the twinkling foam —
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
 bringing the fishermen home;
&#x27;Twas all so pretty a sail, it seemed
 as if it could not be,
And some folks thought &#x27;twas a dream they&#x27;d dreamed
 of sailing that beautiful sea —
But I shall name you the fishermen three:
 Wynken, Blynken, and Nod.

Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
 and Nod is a little head,
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
 is a wee one&#x27;s trundle-bed.
So shut your eyes while Mother sings
 of wonderful sights that be,
And you shall see the beautiful things
 as you rock in the misty sea,
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:
 Wynken, Blynken, and Nod.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Musical adaptations==
By 1890, the lyrics had been set to music, by American pianist and composer Ethelbert Woodbridge Nevin. Dan Hornsby recorded this song for Victor BS-037380 RCA (BlueBird) Records released in 1929. David Gude performed the song on his 1961 Vanguard album &quot;New Folks&quot;.

In 1963, songwriter Lucy Simon wrote a setting (she claimed it was &quot;the first song I ever wrote&quot;) that she recorded with her sister Carly as the Simon Sisters. Appearing on their debut album &quot;Meet the Simon Sisters&quot; (1964), the song became a minor hit for the duo, reaching No. 73 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop singles chart and No. 20 in Canada. The song has been recorded by many artists, including: The Big 3 featuring Cass Elliot (1963); The Irish Rovers on their album &quot;The Life of the Rover&quot; (1969); Roger Whittaker on his children&#x27;s album &quot;The Magical World of Roger Whittaker&quot; (1975); Joanie Bartels, on her album &quot;Lullaby Magic&quot; (1985); Canadian children&#x27;s entertainer Fred Penner on his album &quot;The Cat Came Back&quot; (1979); and the Doobie Brothers for the children&#x27;s music compilation &quot;In Harmony&quot; (1980). Their version also became a minor hit, reaching No. 76 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop singles chart and No. 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart.

Donovan wrote and sang a musical setting on his children&#x27;s album &quot;H.M.S. Donovan&quot; (1971).

Buffy Saint-Marie wrote and sang a version on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1975, and on her album &quot;Sweet America&quot; (1976).

Children&#x27;s entertainer Joanie Bartels sang a rendition on her premiere album, &quot;Lullaby Magic.&quot; (1985)

Producer David Bernard Wolf set the poem for the &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; 1995 album &quot;Barney&#x27;s Sleepytime Songs&quot;.

Kevin Roth created a version for his album &quot;Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep&quot; (1996).

Tatiana Cameron sings her version on her lullaby album &quot;A Chance to Dream&quot; (2006).

David Tamulevich (of the folk duo Mustard&#x27;s Retreat) wrote new original music to the poem, which was subsequently released in 2011 on the Mustard&#x27;s Retreat CD &quot;Living in the Dream&quot;. (2011)

Composer Christopher Klaich composed a contemporary lullaby concert setting for soprano Bianca Showalter which has piano or alternatively chamber orchestral accompaniment (circa 2013).
Composer Stephen DeCesare composed an SATB version of the poem, (2013).

Valentine Wolfe released a heavy metal version in their album &quot;A Child&#x27;s Bestiary&quot;, (2016).

<doc id="423771" wikidata="Q1551556" url="?curid=423771" title="Synaptic plasticity">
<text>In neuroscience, synaptic plasticity is the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, in response to increases or decreases in their activity. Since memories are postulated to be represented by vastly interconnected neural circuits in the brain, synaptic plasticity is one of the important neurochemical foundations of learning and memory (&quot;see Hebbian theory&quot;).

Plastic change often results from the alteration of the number of neurotransmitter receptors located on a synapse. There are several underlying mechanisms that cooperate to achieve synaptic plasticity, including changes in the quantity of neurotransmitters released into a synapse and changes in how effectively cells respond to those neurotransmitters. Synaptic plasticity in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses has been found to be dependent upon postsynaptic calcium release.

==Historical discoveries==
In 1973, Terje Lømo and Tim Bliss first described the now widely studied phenomenon of long-term potentiation (LTP) in a publication in the &quot;Journal of Physiology&quot;. The experiment described was conducted on the synapse between the perforant path and dentate gyrus in the hippocampi of anaesthetised rabbits. They were able to show a burst of tetanic (100 Hz) stimulus on perforant path fibres led to a dramatic and long-lasting augmentation in the post-synaptic response of cells onto which these fibres synapse in the dentate gyrus. In the same year, the pair published very similar data recorded from awake rabbits. This discovery was of particular interest due to the proposed role of the hippocampus in certain forms of memory.

==Biochemical mechanisms==
Two molecular mechanisms for synaptic plasticity involve the NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors. Opening of NMDA channels (which relates to the level of cellular depolarization) leads to a rise in post-synaptic Ca2+ concentration and this has been linked to long-term potentiation, LTP (as well as to protein kinase activation); strong depolarization of the post-synaptic cell completely displaces the magnesium ions that block NMDA ion channels and allows calcium ions to enter a cell – probably causing LTP, while weaker depolarization only partially displaces the Mg2+ ions, resulting in less Ca2+ entering the post-synaptic neuron and lower intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (which activate protein phosphatases and induce long-term depression, LTD).

These activated protein kinases serve to phosphorylate post-synaptic excitatory receptors (e.g. AMPA receptors), improving cation conduction, and thereby potentiating the synapse. Also, these signals recruit additional receptors into the post-synaptic membrane, stimulating the production of a modified receptor type, thereby facilitating an influx of calcium. This in turn increases post-synaptic excitation by a given pre-synaptic stimulus. This process can be reversed via the activity of protein phosphatases, which act to dephosphorylate these cation channels.

The second mechanism depends on a second messenger cascade regulating gene transcription and changes in the levels of key proteins such as CaMKII and PKAII. Activation of the second messenger pathway leads to increased levels of CaMKII and PKAII within the dendritic spine. These protein kinases have been linked to growth in dendritic spine volume and LTP processes such as the addition of AMPA receptors to the plasma membrane and phosphorylation of ion channels for enhanced permeability. Localization or compartmentalization of activated proteins occurs in the presence of their given stimulus which creates local effects in the dendritic spine. Calcium influx from NMDA receptors is necessary for the activation of CaMKII. This activation is localized to spines with focal stimulation and is inactivated before spreading to adjacent spines or the shaft, indicating an important mechanism of LTP in that particular changes in protein activation can be localized or compartmentalized to enhance the responsivity of single dendritic spines. Individual dendritic spines are capable of forming unique responses to presynaptic cells. This second mechanism can be triggered by protein phosphorylation but takes longer and lasts longer, providing the mechanism for long-lasting memory storage. The duration of the LTP can be regulated by breakdown of these second messengers. Phosphodiesterase, for example, breaks down the secondary messenger cAMP, which has been implicated in increased AMPA receptor synthesis in the post-synaptic neuron .

Long-lasting changes in the efficacy of synaptic connections (long-term potentiation, or LTP) between two neurons can involve the making and breaking of synaptic contacts. Genes such as activin ß-A, which encodes a subunit of activin A, are up-regulated during early stage LTP. The activin molecule modulates the actin dynamics in dendritic spines through the MAP-kinase pathway. By changing the F-actin cytoskeletal structure of dendritic spines, spine necks are lengthened producing increased electrical isolation. The end result is long-term maintenance of LTP.

The number of ion channels on the post-synaptic membrane affects the strength of the synapse. Research suggests that the density of receptors on post-synaptic membranes changes, affecting the neuron&#x27;s excitability in response to stimuli. In a dynamic process that is maintained in equilibrium, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor) and AMPA receptors are added to the membrane by exocytosis and removed by endocytosis. These processes, and by extension the number of receptors on the membrane, can be altered by synaptic activity. Experiments have shown that AMPA receptors are delivered to the synapse through vesicular membrane fusion with the postsynaptic membrane via the protein kinase CaMKII, which is activated by the influx of calcium through NMDA receptors. CaMKII also improves AMPA ionic conductance through phosphorylation.
When there is high-frequency NMDA receptor activation, there is an increase in the expression of a protein PSD-95 that increases synaptic capacity for AMPA receptors. This is what leads to a long-term increase in AMPA receptors and thus synaptic strength and plasticity.

If the strength of a synapse is only reinforced by stimulation or weakened by its lack, a positive feedback loop will develop, causing some cells never to fire and some to fire too much. But two regulatory forms of plasticity, called scaling and metaplasticity, also exist to provide negative feedback. Synaptic scaling is a primary mechanism by which a neuron is able to stabilize firing rates up or down.
Synaptic scaling serves to maintain the strengths of synapses relative to each other, lowering amplitudes of small excitatory postsynaptic potentials in response to continual excitation and raising them after prolonged blockage or inhibition. This effect occurs gradually over hours or days, by changing the numbers of NMDA receptors at the synapse (Pérez-Otaño and Ehlers, 2005). Metaplasticity varies the threshold level at which plasticity occurs, allowing integrated responses to synaptic activity spaced over time and preventing saturated states of LTP and LTD. Since LTP and LTD (long-term depression) rely on the influx of Ca2+ through NMDA channels, metaplasticity may be due to changes in NMDA receptors, altered calcium buffering, altered states of kinases or phosphatases and a priming of protein synthesis machinery. Synaptic scaling is a primary mechanism by which a neuron to be selective to its varying inputs.
The neuronal circuitry affected by LTP/LTD and modified by scaling and metaplasticity leads to reverberatory neural circuit development and regulation in a Hebbian manner which is manifested as memory, whereas the changes in neural circuitry, which begin at the level of the synapse, are an integral part in the ability of an organism to learn.

There is also a specificity element of biochemical interactions to create synaptic plasticity, namely the importance of location. Processes occur at microdomains – such as exocytosis of AMPA receptors is spatially regulated by the t-SNARE STX4. Specificity is also an important aspect of CAMKII signaling involving nanodomain calcium.
The spatial gradient of PKA between dendritic spines and shafts is also important for the strength and regulation of synaptic plasticity. It is important to remember that the biochemical mechanisms altering synaptic plasticity occur at the level of individual synapses of a neuron. Since the biochemical mechanisms are confined to these &quot;microdomains,&quot; the resulting synaptic plasticity affects only the specific synapse at which it took place.

==Theoretical mechanisms==
A bidirectional model, describing both LTP and LTD, of synaptic plasticity has proved necessary for a number of different learning mechanisms in computational neuroscience, neural networks, and biophysics. Three major hypotheses for the molecular nature of this plasticity have been well-studied, and none are required to be the exclusive mechanism:
# Change in the probability of glutamate release.
# Insertion or removal of post-synaptic AMPA receptors.
# Phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation inducing a change in AMPA receptor conductance.

Of these, the latter two hypotheses have been recently mathematically examined to have identical calcium-dependent dynamics which provides strong theoretical evidence for a calcium-based model of plasticity, which in a linear model where the total number of receptors are conserved looks like

:formula_1

where

* formula_2 is the synaptic weight of the formula_3th input axon,
* formula_4 is the concentration of calcium,
* formula_5 is a time constant dependent on the insertion and removal rates of neurotransmitter receptors, which is dependent on formula_4, and
* formula_7 is also a function of the concentration of calcium that depends linearly on the number of receptors on the membrane of the neuron at some fixed point.

Both formula_8 and formula_5 are found experimentally and agree on results from both hypotheses. The model makes important simplifications that make it unsuited for actual experimental predictions, but provides a significant basis for the hypothesis of a calcium-based synaptic plasticity dependence.

==Short-term plasticity==
Short-term synaptic plasticity acts on a timescale of tens of milliseconds to a few minutes unlike long-term plasticity, which lasts from minutes to hours. Short-term plasticity can either strengthen or weaken a synapse.

===Synaptic enhancement===
Short-term synaptic enhancement results from an increased probability of synaptic terminals releasing transmitters in response to pre-synaptic action potentials. Synapses will strengthen for a short time because of an increase in the amount of packaged transmitter released in response to each action potential. Depending on the time scales over which it acts synaptic enhancement is classified as neural facilitation, synaptic augmentation or post-tetanic potentiation.

===Synaptic depression===
Synaptic fatigue or depression is usually attributed to the depletion of the readily releasable vesicles. Depression can also arise from post-synaptic processes and from feedback activation of presynaptic receptors.
heterosynaptic depression is thought to be linked to the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from astrocytes.

==Long-term plasticity==
Long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) are two forms of long-term plasticity, lasting minutes or more, that occur at excitatory synapses. NMDA-dependent LTD and LTP have been extensively researched, and are found to require the binding of glutamate, and glycine or D-serine for activation of NMDA receptors.
The turning point for the synaptic modification of a synapse has been found to be modifiable itself, depending on the history of the synapse. Recently, a number of attempts have been made to offer a comprehensive model that could account for most forms of synaptic plasticity.

===Long-term depression===
Brief activation of an excitatory pathway can produce what is known as long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission in many areas of the brain. LTD is induced by a minimum level of postsynaptic depolarization and simultaneous increase in the intracellular calcium concentration at the postsynaptic neuron. LTD can be initiated at inactive synapses if the calcium concentration is raised to the minimum required level by heterosynaptic activation, or if the extracellular concentration is raised. These alternative conditions capable of causing LTD differ from the Hebb rule, and instead depend on synaptic activity modifications. D-serine release by astrocytes has been found to lead to a significant reduction of LTD in the hippocampus.
Activity-dependent LTD was investigated in 2011 for the electrical synapses (modification of Gap Junctions efficacy through their activity). In the brain, cerebellum is one of the structures where LTD is a form of neuroplasticity.

===Long-term potentiation===
Long-term potentiation, commonly referred to as LTP, is an increase in synaptic response following potentiating pulses of electrical stimuli that sustains at a level above the baseline response for hours or longer. LTP involves interactions between postsynaptic neurons and the specific presynaptic inputs that form a synaptic association, and is specific to the stimulated pathway of synaptic transmission. 
The long-term stabilization of synaptic changes is determined by a parallel increase of pre- and postsynaptic structures such as axonal bouton, dendritic spine and postsynaptic density.
On the molecular level, an increase of the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins PSD-95 and Homer1c has been shown to correlate with the stabilization of synaptic enlargement.

Modification of astrocyte coverage at the synapses in the hippocampus has been found to result from the induction of LTP, which has been found to be linked to the release of D-serine, nitric oxide, and the chemokine, s100B by astrocytes.
LTP is also a model for studying the synaptic basis of Hebbian plasticity. Induction conditions resemble those described for the initiation of long-term depression (LTD), but a stronger depolarization and a greater increase of calcium are necessary to achieve LTP. Experiments performed by stimulating an array of individual dendritic spines, have shown that synaptic cooperativity by as few as two adjacent dendritic spines prevents LTD, allowing only LTP.

==Synaptic strength==
The modification of synaptic strength is referred to as functional plasticity. Changes in synaptic strength involve distinct mechanisms of particular types of glial cells, the most researched type being astrocytes.

==Computational use of plasticity==
Every kind of synaptic plasticity has different computational uses.
Short-term facilitation has been demonstrated to serve as both working memory and mapping input for readout, short-term depression for removing auto-correlation. Long-term potentiation is used for spatial memory storage while long-term depression for both encoding space features, selective weakening of synapses and clearing old memory traces respectively. Forward spike-timing-dependent plasticity is used for long range temporal correlation, temporal coding and spatiotemporal coding. The reversed spike-timing-dependent plasticity acts as sensory filtering.
