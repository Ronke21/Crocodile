<text>Political colours are colours used to represent a political ideology, movement or party, either officially or unofficially. They represent the intersection of colour symbolism and political symbolism. Politicians making public appearances will often identify themselves by wearing rosettes, flowers, ties or ribbons in the colour of their political party. Parties in different countries with similar ideologies sometimes use similar colours. As an example the colour red symbolises left-wing ideologies in many countries (leading to such terms as &quot;Red Army&quot; and &quot;Red Scare&quot;), while the colour blue is often used for conservatism, the colour yellow is most commonly associated with liberalism and right-libertarianism, and Green politics is named after the ideology&#x27;s political colour. The political associations of a given colour vary from country to country, and there are exceptions to the general trends, for example red has historically been associated with Christianity, but over time gained association with leftist politics, while the United States differs from other countries in that conservatism is associated with red and liberalism with blue. Mass media has driven a standardisation of colour by political party, to simplify messaging, while historically the colour a candidate chose to identify with could have been chosen based on other factors such as family or regional variations.

==Associations of different colours==
=== Black ===
Black is primarily associated with anarchism (see anarchist symbolism); black is a lack of colour, and anarchism is a lack of a state. It is used in contrast of national flags, to instead represent universal anarchism. Black is also used to a lesser extent to represent ideologies on the opposite end of the spectrum: fascism (see blackshirts and Schutzstaffel) and jihadism (see Black Standard).

The colours black and red have been used by anarchists since at least the late 1800s when they were used on cockades by Italian anarchists in the 1874 Bologna insurrection, and in 1877 when anarchists entered the Italian town Letino carrying red and black flags to promote the First International. During the Spanish Civil War the CNT used a diagonally half strip of black and red, with black representing anarchism and red representing the labour movement and the worker movement. The flag was quickly adopted by other anarchists, with the second colour used to distinguish specific anarchist philosophies: anarcho pacifism with white, green anarchism with green, anarcho-syndicalism and anarcho-communism with red, mutualism with orange, and anarcho-capitalism with yellow, while black alone typically represents &#x27;anarchism without adjectives&#x27;.

During the golden age of piracy, the black flags of pirates such as Blackbeard and Calico Jack became popular symbols of piracy. The flags represented death and no quarter to those who did not surrender. The black flag of the jolly roger, used by Calico Jack, turned into a popular and recognisable symbol of pirates, particularly of pirates of the Americas. The skull and bones also became a hazardous symbol to display poisons such as cyanide, Zyklon B and other toxic substances. The black flag of piracy would later influence the symbols of anarchism, such as the symbols of the Makhnovshchina and the Kronstadt rebellion. The rise of internet piracy led to the symbols of the golden age of piracy becoming widely adopted, becoming the symbols of pirate sites such as the Pirate bay. Black becoming a colour to represent pirate parties.

Black was also used by some anti-racist and Black nationalist parties, such as the Black Panther Party in the United States and the Popular Unity in Brazil.
* Anti-clerical parties in the late 19th and early 20th centuries sometimes used the colour black in reference to the officials of the Roman Catholic Church because the cassock is usually black.
* In Germany and Austria, black is the colour historically associated with Christian democratic parties, such as the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU), the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) and the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP); however, this is only customary, as the official colours of the CDU are usually either one of or a mix of different shades of yellow, orange or blue, depending on the regional branch of the party, with the nationwide party also using the red, black and gold from the German flag as official colours. The CSU uses a medium dark shade of blue as their official colour, as seen in their logo. In 2017, the ÖVP changed their official colour from black to turquoise, with some regional branches switching to turquoise as well, while others continue to use black, often in a mix with another colour, such as red, yellow, green or blue.
* In Italy, black is the colour of fascism because it was the official colour of the National Fascist Party. As a result, modern Italian parties would not use black as their political colour; however, it has been customary to use black to identify the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement.
* In the Islamic world, black flags (often with a white shahadah) are sometimes used by jihadist groups. Black was the colour of the Abbasid caliphate. It is also commonly used by Shia Muslims, as it is also associated with mourning the death of Husayn ibn Ali. It is now known as the flag colour of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
* In Malaysia, the People&#x27;s Solidarity Secretariat (SSR), an umbrella youth organisation launched the Black Flag Movement (#BenderaHitam) in 2021 as a resistance-based protest against the then ruling Perikatan Nasional government. The Malaysian United Democratic Alliance (MUDA) also adapted the colour black as their official colour.
* In Russia, black was used for monarchism and nationalist movements, such as the Black Hundreds before their defeat.
* In India, black represents protest. In Tamil Nadu, black represents atheistic human rights rebels who follow Periyar E. V. Ramasamy.
* In Brazil, the far-left, socialist and anti-racist party Popular Unity has black as its official colour.

It later became a symbol for Pan-German nationalists in Austria, such as Georg Ritter von Schönerer&#x27;s . In 1930s Austria the cornflower was also worn by members of the then illegal NSDAP, as a secret symbol and identifier. After 1945, MPs of the Freedom Party wore cornflowers on their lapels at the openings of the Austrian parliament, until they switched to the more &quot;Austrian&quot; Edelweiß in 2017.
* In Argentina, blue is associated with the syncretic Peronist movement. The left-wing populist Frente de Todos uses sky blue alongside the Justicialist Party, the main party of the front.

* In Japan, blue is associated with liberal, centrist, and centre-left parties. Three centre-left parties in Japan with elected representatives use blue: the Constitutional Democratic Party, Democratic Party for the People, and the Social Democratic Party.

* In South Korea, traditionally blue was used by conservative parties. Since 2013, blue has adopted by the liberal Democratic Party of Korea (previously used green and yellow), while conservative party change its colour from blue to red.

In 2010, the Democratic party unveiled a blue official logo (see red states and blue states).
* In Venezuela, blue represents the Democratic Unity Roundtable, the large multi-ideological coalition of parties in opposition, probably as a counterpart to PSUV&#x27;s red.
* In most of Latin America, blue is used as a colour of anti-feminism and, more specifically, anti-abortion. This colour was used as a response to the feminist/pro-abortion green. This originated in Argentina.

=== Brown ===

Brown has been associated with Nazism, and in particular the Nazi Party in Germany, because of the Sturmabteilung (SA), whose members were called &quot;brown shirts&quot;. They were modelled on Benito Mussolini&#x27;s blackshirts, and the colour of their shirts was chosen because many brown uniforms intended for the colonial troops in Germany&#x27;s African colonies were cheaply available after the end of World War I. In Europe and elsewhere, the colour brown is sometimes used to refer to fascists in general.

Brown has also been used to refer to the general far-right rather than exclusively Nazism and/or fascism. The French political term &quot;red–green–brown alliance&quot; denotes an alliance between leftists (&quot;red&quot;), Islamists (&quot;green&quot;), and the far right (&quot;brown&quot;). Just like its National Socialist context, the colour brown was chosen to refer to the far-right on account of its association with the Nazi Sturmabteilung. There have been slight variations of the red–green–brown alliance which have also used the colour brown to indicate the far-right. In Russia, for example, the metonym &quot;red-brown&quot; was coined to refer to a unification of communists (&quot;red&quot;) and the far-right (&quot;brown&quot;).
* Brown is sometimes used to describe the opposite of green parties, that is to describe parties that care little about pollution.

=== Grey ===
* Grey is sometimes used by parties that represent the interests of pensioners and senior citizens, such as &quot;The Greys&quot; in Germany.
* Grey can also be used to refer to either reactionary independence, neo-Confederate or secessionist movements, due to its association with the Confederate States of America.
* Grey is often used to represent independent politicians; however in the UK, white is used to represent independent politicians.

=== Green ===
Green is the colour for environmentalist and agrarian parties and movements. Considered the holy colour of Islam (see green in Islam), it is used to represent Islamism, as with Hamas, Saudi Arabia and many Islamist parties.
* In most of Latin America, green is associated with pro-choice movements, the colour started being used in Argentina as a symbol of third wave feminism and abortion rights, with a green scarf as a symbol. However, green is also the colour of many Christian democratic parties in the region which opposes abortion, like in Aruba, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela and Panama.
* The Esperanto movement makes wide use of green in its symbolism, including the language&#x27;s flag which is known as the (literally &quot;Green Flag&quot;)

In the past, green was also the colour of the Conservative Party of the Empire of Brazil.
* In Canada, in addition to its use by the Green Party of Canada, green has also been frequently used by right-wing and populist parties that are unaffiliated with the Conservative Party. Examples include the Social Credit Party of Canada, Reform Party of Canada, Canadian Alliance, Wildrose Party in Alberta and the Saskatchewan Party. Green was also historically used as a secondary colour by the left-wing New Democratic Party, whose primary colour is orange.
* In Denmark, a dark shade of green is used by the right-centre Conservative People&#x27;s Party ().
* In Iran, green has been used by the Iranian Green Movement, a political movement that arose after the 2009 Iranian presidential election, in which protesters demanded the removal of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from office.
* In India, green is used mainly by centre-left parties, such as All India Trinamool Congress and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, and by Islamic political parties, such as the Indian Union Muslim League.
* Irish Nationalist and Irish Republican movements have used the colour green. Sinn Fein, the SDLP, Fianna Fail and Aontú all use green as colour. Though the official colour of Ireland is blue, green is the colour of St. Patrick and thus took on a particular significance for Irish nationalists in the 19th century.
* In Italy, Northern secessionist movements such as Lega Nord chose green as their political colour, advocating their Celtic origin.
* In Japan, the dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) uses green as one of its official colours. Although the party has used the colour red more prominently in recent years.

* In South Korea, green was used by various liberal parties for much of post-war history. When the Democratic Party of Korea was founded in 2014, it used blue instead.
* In Spain, green is used by monarchists, as the initials of (&quot;Hail the King of Spain&quot;) spell out the word (Spanish: green). Currently, green is used by monarchist and far-right party Vox. In order to avoid clash of colours, green parties Más Madrid, Más País and Equo use teal. Also, regionwide:
** Green is the standard colour of Basque nationalism and separatism; with dark green used by centre-right Basque Nationalist Party, and light green used by abertzale left EH Bildu.
** Green is the colour of Andalusian nationalism as it appears in the flag of Andalusia, itself based on the flag of the Medieval Caliphate of Córdoba.

Such is the case in Austria, Germany, France, Portugal, Switzerland, Finland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Turkey.
* Since 2004, orange has represented some post-Communist democratic revolutions (&quot;colour revolutions&quot;) in Eastern Europe such as the &quot;Orange Revolution&quot; in Ukraine. This gave the colour orange a certain association with radical anti-authoritarian politics in some countries and it has been used as such by groups and organisations in the Middle East, for example in Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Bahrain and Israel.
* Humanism frequently uses orange for representation. It is the colour of the Humanist International, as well as the humanist parties in Argentina, Costa Rica and Chile, and other humanist organisations.
* Orange is often used to represent the mutualist current in anarchist politics, as a middle ground between pro-market currents such as anarcho-capitalism (associated with the colour yellow of liberalism) and anti-capitalist currents such as anarcho-syndicalism and anarcho-communism (associated with the colour red of communism and socialism).
* In Australia, orange is used to represent the One Nation party, a right-wing populist and national-conservative led by Pauline Hanson. It is also used to represent other populist parties, such as the Centre Alliance party.
* In Brazil, orange is the colour of the liberal New Party and also is the colour of two parties associated with a socially conservative social democracy: Forward and Solidarity.
* In Canada, Orange is the official colour of the social-democratic New Democratic Party. During Jack Layton&#x27;s leadership green was used as their accent colour; The logo was a green maple leaf with orange &quot;NDP&quot; lettering. Currently light blue is used as their accent colour although it seldom appears and is not included in the logo (the current logo is an orange maple leaf with orange &quot;NDP&quot; lettering).
* In Cyprus, since its adoption by the fans of APOEL FC, orange has been associated with fascist and ultranationalist politics.
* The Czech Social Democratic Party uses orange alongside the more traditional red.
* During the English Civil War of 1642, orange was associated with parliamentarian Roundheads.
* In Greece, orange is associated with liberal and centrist parties, like Center Union, Drassi and Recreate Greece
* In Hungary the colour is associated with the conservative Fidesz party, which has been in office for several years. Probably because of the country&#x27;s history, that anti-immigrationism has become popular (see Trianon).
* In Israel, the colour orange has become the dominant colour of the right-wing, with an emphasis on the religious-right. This is when, from 2004, the colour became the leader of a protest against the disengagement plan, and became identified with the right-wing camp.
* In Mexico, orange is not linked to Christian democratic movements (the Christian democratic party Partido Acción Nacional uses blue). Instead, it is linked to the centre-left secular party Movimiento Ciudadano.
* In New Zealand, the Electoral Commission rejected a proposed orange logo for being likely to confuse or mislead voters by being too similar to the colour used by the country&#x27;s electoral agencies.

Orange red is the official colour of the Independent Democrats, a social democratic political party in the Northern and Western Cape Provinces.
* In Spain, orange is used by Citizens, a liberal party that opposes Catalan separatism. This is in contrast to the yellow used by Catalan separatism (see below).
* In Thailand, orange is used by the banned Future Forward Party, and currently used by the Move Forward Party, being associated with social democracy and progressivism.

=== Pink ===
Pink is sometimes used by social democratic parties, such as in France and Portugal. The more traditional colour of social democracy is red (because social democracy is descended from the democratic socialist movement), but some countries have large social democratic parties alongside large socialist or communist parties, so that it would be confusing for them all to use red. In such cases, social democrats are usually the ones who give up red in favour of a different colour. Pink is often chosen because it is seen as a softer, less aggressive version of red, in the same way that social democracy is more centrist and capitalistic than socialism.
* In some European nations and the United States, pink is associated with homosexuality and the pink flag is used as a symbol in support of civil rights for LGBT people; it is commonly used to represent queer anarchism. This use originates in Nazi German policy of appending pink triangles to the clothing of homosexual prisoners.
* The Austrian liberal party NEOS uses pink as its main colour.
* In the Dominion of Newfoundland, pink was used to represent the Newfoundland People&#x27;s Party.

=== Purple ===

Although purple has some older associations with monarchism, it is the most prominent colour that is not traditionally connected to any major contemporary ideology. As such, it is sometimes used to represent a mix of different ideologies, or new protest movements that are critical of all previously existing large parties and minor parties.
* Since purple, green and white were adopted by the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (the Suffragettes), purple has been associated with feminism and the women&#x27;s movement. 1970s feminists such as Dale Spender and Midge Mackenzie revived these colours, and they were used officially for International Women&#x27;s Year in 1975 and subsequently as the colours for International Women&#x27;s Day. Often in combination with green, it the symbol for feminist political parties such as the UK&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Equality Party or the Women&#x27;s List in Iceland. When combined with black, it is used to represent anarcha-feminism.
* Purple has been the colour of the international Pirate Party movement since the founding of the Swedish Pirate Party in 2006.
* In Albania, purple is the colour of the Socialist Party of Albania.
* In Australia, purple is used by the Australian Electoral Commission, the independent statutory authority responsible for the management of federal elections. While use of the colour purple by political parties is not prohibited in itself, it is strongly discouraged owing to the possibility of confusion and the risk of contravening laws against misleadingly branded election signage.
* In Brazil, purple is the colour associated with some progressive liberal movements such as Cidadania and Livres. This colour is chosen because those movements consider themselves to be mixing the best ideas of the left (associated with red) and the right (associated with blue)
* In Canada, the People&#x27;s Party of Canada is a right-libertarian and right-wing populist party whose colour has been purple since its founding and have changed their logo in 2021 to reflect that. The People&#x27;s Alliance of New Brunswick are another right-wing party that uses purple in Canada. Previously, purple was used by several municipal politicians, such as Naheed Nenshi and Lisa Helps, as a &quot;nonpartisan&quot; or &quot;postpartisan&quot; colour, due to its lack of association with any major party or ideological viewpoints. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Alberta NDP used purple as their main colour instead of orange – their current colour and the standard colour of NDP parties across Canada. This was because orange was being used as the secondary colour by the Alberta Progressive Conservatives.
* In the Dominican Republic, the Dominican Liberation Party logo is a yellow five-pointed star on a purple background. It was originally a leftist party but today the party is seen gravitating towards a more centrist platform.
* In Europe, purple tends to be used for movements, parties and governments that are neither clearly right nor left. The colour is also used by the European federalist party Volt.
** It has been used to represent the Purple governments of Belgium and the Netherlands, formed by an alliance of red social-democratic and blue liberal parties.
* In the Republic of Ireland, purple is the colour of the Social Democrats; in most other countries, social democrats use pink or red, but the use of purple has allowed the party to stand out visually from other left-wing parties (such as Labour, Solidarity, People Before Profit and the Workers&#x27; Party, who all use shades of red and pink). Co-leader Catherine Murphy used purple as her personal colour when she was an independent politician, prior to the party&#x27;s foundation in 2015.
* In Israel, because purple has been a less politicised colour (and inspired by Spain&#x27;s Podemos), the colour has become the symbol of Standing Together, a grassroots joint Jewish/Palestinian for social justice.
* In Italy, purple has been adopted by anti-Silvio Berlusconi protesters (see Purple People) as an alternative from other colours and political parties.
* In Peru, the Purple Party is a liberal party which chose purple as its colour to represent centrism, between the blue of the right and red of the left.
* In Spain, purple is associated with leftist anti-fascist republicanism, as purple (originally the colour representing Castile and León), along with gold and red, was the colour of the flag of the Second Spanish Republic. The left-wing to far-left and republican Podemos uses purple.
* In Turkey, the Peoples&#x27; Democratic Party (HDP) is often represented with the colour purple. Considered on the left-wing of the political spectrum and a merger of various socialist and pro-Kurdish movements, the party places a strong emphasis on participatory and radical democracy, feminism, LGBT rights, minority rights, youth rights and egalitarianism.
* In the United Kingdom, purple is most commonly associated with UKIP, a formerly prominent eurosceptic party which has since become extremely minor. Purple has also been the official colour of two other British Eurosceptic parties, Veritas and the Christian Peoples Alliance. From these associations, among others, the colour purple has been linked with far-right politics in the UK. However, it is also the colour of the centre-left, pro-European Co-operative Party, which has an electoral pact with the Labour Party.
* In the United States, the Working Families Party, which is a progressive third party, uses purple as one of its primary party colors. Purple is also used to describe populations with a near-equal mix of Democrat (blue) and Republican (red) voters, particularly in the context of Presidential elections. 21st-century election reporting commonly refers to &quot;Purple states&quot; or &quot;Purple counties&quot; for regions where neither party appears to have a clear majority among likely voters (i.e. contested frequently between the Republican Party, whose unofficial colour is red; and the Democratic Party, whose unofficial colour is blue). It has also been used to reference Purple America, noting that electoral differences nationwide are observed more on discrepancies instead of unity (see red states and blue states). Purple is also used by centrists to represent a combination of beliefs belonging to the Republicans and the Democrats.

=== Red ===

Red is often associated with the left, especially socialism and communism. The oldest symbol of socialism (and by extension communism) is the red flag, which dates back to the French Revolution in the 18th century and the revolutions of 1848. Before this nascence, the colour red was generally associated with Christianity due to the symbolism and association of Christ&#x27;s blood. The colour red was chosen to represent the blood of the workers who died in the struggle against capitalism. All major socialist and communist alliances and organisations—including the First, Second, Third and Fourth Internationals—used red as their official colour. The association between the colour red and communism is particularly strong. Communists use red much more often and more extensively than other ideologies use their respective traditional colours.
* In Europe and Latin America, red is also associated with parties of social democracy and often their allies within the labour movement, a symbol of common solidarity among leftists.
* Additionally, in parts of Latin America, red is also the traditional colour of liberal parties. It was the colour used, for example, in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Uruguay for liberal parties.
* In Brazil, red is used by the Workers&#x27; Party, supporters of Lula and communist parties. The association of red with Lulism and communism has become so prevalent in recent years that other parties that had red as a primary or secondary colour switched colours so as not to be associated with or confused with Lula, PT and the communist parties.
* In Canada, red is the colour of the Communist Party of Canada and is also used by the Liberal Party of Canada.
* In China, red is the colour used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
* In Hong Kong, red is used by the pro-Beijing camp. 
* In Macau, red is used by the pro-Beijing camp. 
* In Malaysia, red was currently used to represent Pakatan Harapan and also the Socialist Party of Malaysia. Meanwhile, red is also used United Malays National Organization and Malaysian United Indigenous Party as part of the Malay Tricolour (the other being yellow and green).
* In Poland, it is used by the social-democratic Lewica party.
* In Russia, red is used by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. In the Soviet Union, red was the colour used by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
* In Singapore, red is used as the official colours for both the Singapore Democratic Party and the Progress Singapore Party. Both parties had social liberalism ideologies.
* In Spain, red is the official colour of both the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party and the Communist Party of Spain. Because the Socialists are a major party, and in order to avoid a clash of colours, the Communist United Left voluntarily uses dark red as its customary colour.
* In Taiwan, it is used by the Taiwan People&#x27;s Communist Party and the wider united front in Taiwan, associated with Chinese communism and allegiance to the CCP.
* In Thailand, red is used by Pheu Thai Party and supporters of Thaksin Shinawatra, hence the umbrella term &quot;Red Shirts&quot;.
* In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland, red is also the colour of the labour movement and the Labour parties in those countries (spelled &#x27;Labor Party&#x27; in Australia). The use of red as a symbol is referenced in the British Labour Party&#x27;s anthem, &quot;The Red Flag&quot;.
* In the heyday of the British Empire before 1960, maps, globes, and atlases typically used red or pink to designate the Empire or its Commonwealth; the practice inspired the All-Red Route and the All Red Line. This derived from the Redcoats traditionally worn by the British Army. As soon as a colony became independent, it needed its own distinctive colour and the practice died out.
* A key exception to the convention of red to mean the left-wing of politics is the United States. Since about the year 2000, the mass media have associated red with the Republican Party, even though the Republican Party is a conservative party (see red states and blue states). This use is possibly entrenched, as many political organisations (for example, the website RedState) now use the term.
* Since the 2010s, some conservative parties such as the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan and the People Power Party of South Korea have also adopted red as their political colour.

=== Saffron ===
Saffron is traditionally associated with Hinduism, Hindutva and the Hindu nationalist movement. Saffron was chosen because in Hinduism, the deep saffron colour is associated with sacrifice, religious abstinence, quest for light and salvation. Saffron or &quot;Bhagwa&quot; is the most sacred colour for the Hindus and is often worn by Sanyasis who have left their home in search of the ultimate truth.

=== Teal ===
* In Australia, the colour teal, and the term &quot;teal independents&quot;, have become associated with some of the centrist independent candidates supported by the Voices groups in Australia and campaigning on a platform emphasising climate change action, tackling corruption in politics, and gender equality. Six such candidates won seats at the 2022 Australian federal election, ousting incumbent MPs from the Liberal Party of Australia. One theory about the colour teal in this context is that it symbolises a mixture of blue (the Liberal Party&#x27;s colour) with green (representing environmental concerns).
* In Spain, because the colour green is connected to monarchism, environmental parties use teal in order to avoid clash of colours. They include the parties; Más Madrid, Más País and Equo.
* In the United Kingdom, teal is used by right-wing populist Reform UK, because it is seen as a version of the conservative blue.
* In Canada, teal is used by the French-Canadian nationalist Bloc Québécois.
* In Austria, teal is the main colour of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party. The colour was changed from black to teal as a part of the party&#x27;s rebranding campaign after the Sebastian Kurz corruption scandal and subsequent drop in the party&#x27;s popularity.

=== White ===
White is today mainly linked to pacifism (as in the surrender flag).
* Historically, it was associated with support for absolute monarchy, starting with the supporters of the Bourbon dynasty of France because it was the dynasty&#x27;s colour. Partly due to this association, white also came to be associated with Jacobitism, itself allied with the Bourbons. White cockades, white ladies&#x27; gloves, and &quot;Rosa pimpinellifolia&quot; (the &#x27;burnet&#x27; or &#x27;Stuart&#x27; rose) symbolised support for the exiled House of Stuart. Because some of the Russian &quot;Whites&quot; had similar goals to the French &quot;Whites&quot; of a century earlier, it was used by the Whites who fought against the communist &quot;Reds&quot; in the Russian Civil War (see also White Army), although the Whites included many different people with many ideologies, such as monarchists, liberals, anticommunist social democrats and others.
** Because of its use by anti-communist forces in Russia, the colour white came to be associated in the 20th century with many different anti-communist and counter-revolutionary groups, even those that did not support absolute monarchy (for example, the Finnish &quot;Whites&quot; who fought against the socialist &quot;Reds&quot; in the civil war following the independence of Finland). In some revolutions, red is used to represent the revolutionaries and white is used to represent the supporters of the old order, regardless of the ideologies or goals of the two sides.
* In Italy, a red cross on a white shield () is the emblem of Catholic parties from the historical Christian Democracy party.
* The white uniforms for the Singapore&#x27;s political party, the People&#x27;s Action Party, represents its conservatism, and to promote unity and pure political ideologies.
* In the politics of the United Kingdom, white represents independent politicians such as Martin Bell.
* The Yorkshire Party, a Devolutionist Political Party with elected representatives in Yorkshire, uses a stylised White Rose of York as its emblem.

=== Yellow and gold ===
Yellow and gold are the colours most strongly associated with right-libertarianism and liberalism.
* In Latin America, it is not unusual for left-wing social democratic parties to use yellow, as red was the traditional colour of liberals, especially in countries with prominent red-using liberal parties like Uruguay, Honduras, Mexico, Colombia and Costa Rica.
* Yellow is also associated with Judaism and the Jewish people, although this may be seen negatively (see also Yellow badge) and since 1945 the blue Star of David is preferred.
* In East and Southeast Asia, yellow is used to represent monarchies. For instance, in Thailand yellow represents King Bhumibol and King Vajiralongkorn, apart from the colour of the royalists, known as the &quot;yellowshirts&quot;. It was also the colour of the pro-monarchy Panchayat system in the Kingdom of Nepal.
* It is also a common colour to represent Buddhism; monks in Myanmar used it in the anti-government protests in 2007–2008.
* Yellow socialism was a political movement in France from 1902 until World War I, opposed to the &quot;red socialism&quot; of Marxism.
* In Australia, yellow is used to represent the United Australia Party established in 2013.
* In Brazil, yellow, combined with green, is associated with right-wing populists and national conservatives movements against corruption, anti-Workers Party, anti-communists, supportive of impeachment of Dilma Rousseff and later, with support of Jair Bolsonaro, like PSL and the Alliance for Brazil. The association came because many of the protesters against Dilma wore the jersey of Brazil national football team, which is yellow with the numbers and some details in green, and because the protesters chanted that the Brazilian flag &quot;will never be red&quot; (in reference to the colours of the communism and Workers&#x27; Party) and &quot;will always be green and yellow&quot;.
* In Canada, yellow does not have any dominant political connotation, and so is commonly used by Elections Canada as a politically neutral colour and as a high-visibility colour to mark polling stations.
* In Hong Kong, yellow represents the pro-democracy supporters.
* In Macau, yellow represents the pro-democracy supporters.
* In Malaysia, yellow was formerly used by Bersih (The Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections).
* In the Philippines, yellow is commonly associated with the centre to centre-left Liberal Party although other colours such as red and blue are used.
* In Poland, yellow is used by the liberal centrist party Poland 2050.
* In Romania, yellow is used by the National Liberal Party (PNL).
* In South Korea, yellow associated with historically Uri Party and former President Roh Moo-hyun supporters. Since 2015, Justice Party adopted the colour.
* In Spain, regionally:
** Yellow is the colour used by supporters of the Catalan independence movement. Since 2017, separatists adopted the yellow ribbon as one of their symbols along with the (pro-independence flag).
** Yellow is the customary colour of Canarian nationalism, with blue and white, the other colours in the flag of the Canary Islands, also being used.
* In the United States, the colour yellow was the official colour of the suffrage movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the 21st century, the Libertarian Party&#x27;s official branding colours are gold-yellow, grey, and black. The gold-yellow colour is prominent because of the historical association with classical liberalism and in reference to a gold-backed currency and free markets.
* In the United Kingdom, the colour yellow is predominantly used by the Scottish National Party, Liberal Democrats, and Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. The use of political yellow dates back to David Lloyd George&#x27;s publication of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Industrial Future&quot; in the early to mid-1920s. Yellow denotes freedom, advancement, and novelty, with special importance on the freedom representing the desire of independence for the SNP.

== By country ==
=== Germany ===
In Germany, colours are commonly used by media and politicians as signals of political affiliation; this public practice helps them reach the increasing number of unaffiliated voters.
Colour schemes used by major political parties in Germany include the following:
* Social Democratic Party (SPD): red
* Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU): black (in federal elections)
* Alliance 90/The Greens: green
* Free Democratic Party (FDP): yellow
* Alternative for Germany (AfD): blue
* The Left (Die Linke): red or magenta

===United Kingdom===
* In Northern Ireland, the Unionist parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly are called the &quot;orange block&quot; and the Nationalist parties are the &quot;green block&quot;.
** Some of the established political parties use or have used different colour variations in certain localities. This was common in British politics up to the 1970s. The traditional colour of the Penrith and the Border Conservatives was yellow, rather than dark blue, even in the 2010 election Conservative candidates in Penrith and the neighbouring constituency of Westmorland and Lonsdale wore blue and yellow rosettes. In North East England, the Conservatives traditionally used red, Labour green and the Liberals blue and orange. In parts of East Anglia, the Conservatives used pink and blue, while in Norwich their colours were orange and purple. The Liberals and Conservatives used blue and red respectively in West Wales, while in parts of Cheshire the Liberals were red and Labour yellow. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Tories used orange in Birmingham, pink in Whitby and red in East Worcestershire, while the Whigs were blue in Kendal, purple in Marlborough and orange in Wakefield. The traditional colour of the Warwickshire Liberals was green, rather than orange.
===United States of America===
* In the United States the two major political parties use the national colours, i.e. red, white and blue. Historically, the only common situation in which it has been necessary to assign a single colour to a party has been in the production of political maps in graphical displays of election results. In such cases, there had been no consistent association of particular parties with particular colours. Between the early 1970s and 1992, most television networks used blue to denote states carried by the Democratic Party and red to denote states carried by the Republican Party in presidential elections. A unified colour scheme (blue for Democrats, red for Republicans) began to be implemented with the 1996 presidential election; in the weeks following the 2000 election, there arose the terminology of red states and blue states. Political observers latched on to this association, which resulted from the use of red for Republican victories and blue for Democratic victories on the display map of a television network. As of November 2012, maps for presidential elections produced by the U.S. government also use blue for Democrats and red for Republicans. In September 2010, the Democratic Party officially adopted an all-blue logo. Around the same time, the official Republican website began using a red logo.
** This association has potential to confuse foreign observers in that, as described above, red is traditionally a left-wing colour (as used with the Democratic Socialists of America), while blue is typically associated with right-wing politics. This is further complicated by the diversity of factions in the Democratic Party ranging from conservatives to right-libertarians to democratic socialists alongside the dominant centrist and social liberal elements of the party that outside the United States often each use different political colours.
** The conservative Blue Dog Coalition within the Democratic Party adopted the colour blue at its founding, before the 2000 election solidified the red-blue convention.
** There is some historical use of blue for Democrats and red for Republicans: in the late 19th century and early 20th century, Texas county election boards used colour-coding to help Spanish speakers and illiterates identify the parties, but this system was not applied consistently in Texas and was not picked up on a national level. For instance in 1888, Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison used maps that coded blue for the Republicans, the colour Harrison perceived to represent the Union and &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Party&quot; and red for the Democrats.
** In Puerto Rico, the main party, the pro-statehood New Progressive Party uses blue, while the Popular Democratic Party uses red, and the Puerto Rican Independence Party uses green.

<doc id="423389" wikidata="Q6591170" url="?curid=423389" title="List of NHL franchise post-season droughts">
<text>Active and all-time National Hockey League (NHL) franchise post-season appearance, post-season series win, Stanley Cup Finals and Stanley Cup droughts up to and including the 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs, are listed below. Those teams which have never made it in franchise history are listed by the season that they entered the league, either as a new franchise or when they merged into the NHL from the disbanded World Hockey Association (WHA) league. These lists do not include the cancelled 2004–05 NHL season when calculating &quot;number of seasons&quot;.

Among the current 32 NHL teams, ten have never won the Stanley Cup, with the oldest of them being the Vancouver Canucks and the Buffalo Sabres (53 seasons). The longest Stanley Cup drought in NHL history belongs to the Toronto Maple Leafs (56 seasons). Toronto&#x27;s drought is still active, and they have not made the Finals since winning the last Stanley Cup in 1967, before the expansion era. Five teams have never reached the Stanley Cup Finals, with the oldest of them being the Winnipeg Jets/Arizona Coyotes franchise (43 seasons). Toronto&#x27;s active 56-season drought from the Finals is the longest in NHL history. In 2010, the Chicago Blackhawks ended what was the second-longest Stanley Cup championship drought at 49 seasons (now the sixth-longest). The end of that drought was the first of three consecutive years in which one of the eleven longest such droughts was broken (Chicago Blackhawks in 2010, Boston Bruins in 2011, and Los Angeles Kings in 2012).

The Buffalo Sabres have the longest active playoff series win drought at 17 seasons and also have the longest active post-season appearance drought at 13 seasons, a league record. The Florida Panthers have the longest playoff series win drought in league history at 24 seasons.

==Longest active droughts==
===Post-season appearance droughts===

A postseason appearance drought is continued by not making the NHL playoffs after the regular season. Since the first round of the playoffs normally consists of eight series (sixteen teams) and there were thirty-two active teams in the NHL during the 2023–24 season, there are sixteen teams that did not make the most recent playoffs on this list.

:1 The team was inactive at the start of the 2024–25 NHL season.

===Division championship droughts===
This is a list of the teams and the number of seasons since they have won the Division championship. This list does not include the division champions in the 2023–24 NHL season: the Dallas Stars, Florida Panthers, New York Rangers, and Vancouver Canucks.
:1 includes 4 seasons for Atlanta Thrashers (2007–08 through to 2010–11) + 13 seasons for Winnipeg Jets (2011–12 through to 2023–24)
:2 franchise changed its name in 2014 from Phoenix to Arizona Coyotes
:3 The team was inactive at the start of the 2024–25 NHL season.

===Presidents&#x27; Trophy droughts===
This is a list of the teams and the number of seasons since they have won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the regular season champions. This list does not include the most recent Presidents&#x27; Trophy champions: the New York Rangers.
:1 The trophy was introduced at the start of the 1985–86 NHL season.

:5 The team was inactive at the start of the 2024–25 NHL season.
:6 includes 11 seasons of the Atlanta Thrashers (1999–2000 through to 2010–11) + 13 seasons of the Winnipeg Jets (2011–12 through to 2023–24)

===Post-season series win droughts===
A post-season series win drought is continued either by not making the playoffs in a season or by making the playoffs in a season and subsequently losing the first-round series. Since the first round of the NHL playoffs consists of eight series (sixteen teams), there will be twenty-four teams in this list – the sixteen teams that do not qualify for the post-season, plus the eight teams that lose their first-round series.

The other eight teams – the Boston Bruins, Carolina Hurricanes, Colorado Avalanche, Dallas Stars, Edmonton Oilers, Florida Panthers, New York Rangers, and Vancouver Canucks – all won a post-season series in the 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs.

<text>Pieter Arnoldus &quot;Piet&quot; Cronjé (4 October 1836 – 4 February 1911) was a South African Boer general during the Anglo-Boer Wars of 1880–1881 and 1899–1902.

== Biography ==
Born in the Cape Colony but raised in the South African Republic, Cronjé had a distinctive appearance, being short with a black beard and was reputed to have considerable personal courage. He made his reputation in the First Boer War, besieging the British garrison at Potchefstroom. He was unable to force their surrender until after the conclusion of the general armistice, and was at this time accused of withholding knowledge of this armistice from the garrison.

Cronjé was in command of the force that rounded up Leander Jameson at Doornkop at the conclusion of the Jameson Raid on 2 January 1896. During the Second Boer War, Cronjé was general commanding in the western theatre of war. He began the sieges of Kimberley and Mafeking. At Mafeking, with a force between 2,000 and 6,000 he laid siege against 1,200 regular troops and militia under the command of Colonel Robert Baden-Powell.

After Lord Methuen attempted to relieve the siege of Kimberley, Cronjé fought the Battle of Modder River on 28 November 1899, where the British won a Pyrrhic victory over the Boers. Cronjé&#x27;s novel tactics at the Modder River, where his infantry were positioned at the base of the hills instead of at the tops—to increase the effectiveness of their rifles&#x27; flat trajectories—earned him a place in military history. However the tactics ascribed to him were not his own; he was convinced by General Koos de la Rey and President Martinus Theunis Steyn. After Modder River, Cronjé repulsed Methuen&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Magersfontein on 11 December. This was actually due to &#x27;s tactics and planning; Cronjé sat idle in camp.

Cronjé was an attritionist and did not see the value in manoeuvre battles. He was defeated at the Battle of Paardeberg where he surrendered with 4,150 of his commandos on 27 February 1900, after being enveloped by Lord Roberts&#x27; forces. The commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, the Grenadier Guards, Lieutenant Colonel Eyre Crabbe, was surprised to find that Cronjé had been accompanied on the campaign by his wife.

After his surrender he and his wife, Hester, were sent to a prison-of-war camp on Saint Helena, where he remained until the conclusion of peace negotiations in 1902. Boer morale sank after his defeat, with the capital of the Orange Free State, Bloemfontein, being taken without a shot being fired. He was a South African Freemason.

Cronjé was humiliated and shunned by the other Boer generals, ridiculed in the press, and was not asked to attend the peace talks at Vereeniging. He took part in the World Fair reenactments of the Anglo-Boer war at St. Louis in 1904. Dubbed a &quot;circus general&quot; by the South African press, he failed to return home at the time, instead joining a show on Coney Island, Brooklyn. He eventually returned to South Africa and died at Klerksdorp.

<text>Ōe no Hiromoto (, 1148–1225) was a Japanese &quot;kuge&quot; (court noble) and vassal of the Kamakura shogunate, and contributed to establishing the shogunate&#x27;s governmental structure.

== Life ==
A great-grandson of the famous scholar Ōe no Masafusa, he was born to Ōe no Koremitsu and adopted by Nakahara no Hirosue but later returned to the Ōe family in 1216. There is another theory that Hiromoto was born to Fujiwara no Mitsuyoshi. As a minor noble, he originally served at the Imperial Court in Kyoto.

In 1184 he was invited to Kamakura by Minamoto no Yoritomo, who later founded the Kamakura shogunate. He became the first head (&quot;bettō&quot;) of the new Kumonjo (Board of Public Documents) in the same year and then of the Mandokoro (Administrative Board) in 1191. On Hiromoto&#x27;s advice, Yoritomo appointed &quot;jitō&quot; and &quot;shugo&quot; in 1185, which helped to strengthen shogunal control over the provinces. In 1190 Ōe followed Yoritomo to Kyoto and remained there to negotiate with the imperial court until 1192.

After Yoritomo&#x27;s death, Ōe won the trust of his widow, Hōjō Masako, and assisted in the Hōjō clan&#x27;s seizure of power. He was involved in several important events in the shogunate. In 1199 real power was moved from second shōgun Minamoto no Yoriie to the council of influential &quot;gokenin&quot;. In 1203 the shōgun was arrested along with his supporter Hiki Yoshikazu. Hiromoto also helped the Hōjō clan crush enemies as Hatakeyama Shigetada, Hiraga Asamasa and Wada Yoshimori.

In the Jōkyū War he insisted on making a sudden attack to Kyoto and contributed to the shogunate&#x27;s overwhelming victory. He died after backing up Hōjō Yasutoki&#x27;s succession. His fourth son founded the Mōri clan.

<text>Jacobus Herculaas de la Rey (pronounced phonetically as &quot;Ya-qui-bis Hehr-key-lahs de la Ray&quot;) (22 October 1847 – 15 September 1914), better known as Koos de la Rey, was a South African military officer who served as a Boer general during the Second Boer War. also had a political career and was one of the leading advocates of Boer independence. His death at the hands of the South African Police under controversial circumstances had a major role in sparking the Maritz rebellion.

==Early life==
Born on Doornfontein Farm in the Winburg District of the Orange Free State, Koos was the son of Adrianus Johannes Gijsbertus de la Rey and Adriana Wilhelmina van Rooyen. was a Boer of French Huguenot, Spanish and Dutch descent. His grandfather, a school teacher and the patriarch of the family in South Africa, came from Utrecht, Netherlands. After the Battle of Boomplaats, the family farm was confiscated by the British and the family trekked into the Transvaal and settled in Lichtenburg. As a child received very little formal education. The De la Rey family moved, this time to Kimberley after the discovery of diamonds. As a young man, de la Rey worked as a transport rider on the routes serving the diamond diggings at Kimberley.

==Marriage==
De la Rey married Jacoba Elizabeth (Nonnie) Greeff and the couple settled on &quot;Manana&quot;, the Greeff family farm. &quot;Manana&quot; had belonged to Jacoba&#x27;s father Hendrik Adriaan Greeff, the founder of Lichtenburg. Later bought the farm &quot;Elandsfontein&quot;. They had twelve children and they looked after another six children who had lost their parents. was deeply religious and a small pocket Bible was rarely out of his hand. He had formidable looks - a long neatly trimmed brown beard and a high forehead with deep-set eyes that gave him a prematurely patriarchal appearance. His sister Cornelia was married to Pieter Van der Hoff, who was a nephew of Dirk Van der Hoff, founder of the Transvaal&#x27;s state Church.

==Military campaigns==
De la Rey fought in the Basotho War of 1865 and Sekhukhune&#x27;s War of 1876. He did not take a very active part in the First Boer War, but as field cornet in the western Transvaal, he took over Piet Cronjé&#x27;s Potchefstroom siege (1880–1881) when Cronjé fell ill. He was elected commandant of the Lichtenburg district, and became a member of the Transvaal Volksraad in 1883. A supporter of the progressive faction under General Piet Joubert, he opposed Paul Kruger&#x27;s policies against the &quot;uitlanders&quot;, the foreigners who flocked to the Transvaal gold-rush, and warned it would lead to war with Britain.

==Second Boer War==

=== Kraaipan ===

On the outbreak of war, was appointed one of Piet Cronjé&#x27;s field generals. led an attack that resulted in the first shots of the war being fired at Kraaipan in an attack on a British armored train that was on its way from Vryburg to Mafeking. The train was derailed and after a five-hour fight, the British surrendered. This incident made famous, but exacerbated his conflicts with the cautious and unimaginative Cronjé, who sent him to block the advance of the British forces moving to relieve the Siege of Kimberley.

=== Graspan ===
Lieutenant General Lord Methuen, commander of the 1st Division, was tasked with raising the Boer siege of Kimberley and moved his force by rail to Belmont station in the northern Cape Province. Upon detraining, they came under fire from a small force of Boers led by Commandant J. Prinsloo on Belmont Kopje. By the next morning, the British were in position to shell and then charge the hill despite some losses. The Boers retreated to their horses at the back of the koppie and fell back to Graspan, rejoining the larger force of Free-Staters and Transvaalers under the command of Prinsloo and respectively. Here the Boers occupied several koppies but with no better luck as they were similarly forced off by artillery and infantry charges. The way lay open for Methuen&#x27;s force to the Modder (Mud) River crossing where the Boers had blown up the railway bridge.

=== Modder River ===

Having realised that the traditional Boer tactic of fighting from higher ground exposed them to the superior British artillery, insisted that his men and Prinsloo&#x27;s Free-Staters dig in on the banks of the Modder and Riet Rivers, the first use of trench warfare in the war. The plan was to hold fire until the British had approached close enough for the Boers&#x27; advantage in rifle fire to take effect, while making it difficult for the full force of the British artillery to be used. In the early hours the British troops advanced across the plain unopposed, but Prinsloo&#x27;s men opened fire at long range, the troops took cover and the artillery pounded the Boer trenches. A series of British rushes pushed the Free-Staters back across the ford, and only a counter-attack led by enabled the Boers to hold the field until dusk, when they slipped away. was wounded and his son Adriaan was killed; he blamed Cronjé for failing to send reinforcements.

=== Magersfontein ===
After the Boers were forced back from the Modder River, the British spent some time repairing the Modder River bridge, while had his men entrench on flat ground at the base of the Magersfontein hill. His controversial tactic was vindicated on 10 December when the hill was intensively shelled to no effect. Before dawn the following day, the crack Highland regiments were ordered to advance in close order. They alerted the defenders by stumbling across wires hung with tin cans and were soon pinned down. After nine hours taking heavy losses, including the brigade commander, Major General Wauchope, without managing to advance at all, they finally broke and retreated in disorder. The battle caused public mourning in Scotland and Methuen was sidelined; the relief of Kimberley would be entrusted to Lord Roberts.

=== Boer defeat ===
Nevertheless, Magersfontein and the disasters on the Tugela River were the low point of the British campaign and, thereafter, with massive reinforcements from all over the Empire, they gradually fought their way back. At Paardeberg (8 February 1900), while was away rallying resistance to Major General French&#x27;s advance in the Colesberg area of the Cape, the helpless Cronjé was trapped by Roberts and surrendered with his entire army. Bloemfontein was taken on 13 March 1900, Pretoria on 5 June; Kruger fled to Portuguese East Africa.

=== Guerrilla war ===

Only a hard core of Boers were willing to remain in the field. , Louis Botha and other commanders met near Kroonstad and laid down a new strategy of guerrilla war. The Western Transvaal fell to , and for the next two years he led a mobile campaign, winning battles at Moedwil, Nooitgedacht, Driefontein, Donkerhoek and other places, and inflicting large losses of men and material on the British at Ysterspruit on 25 February 1902, where enough ammunition and supplies were captured to reinvigorate the Boer forces. At Tweebosch on 7 March 1902, a large part of Methuen&#x27;s rear-guard was captured, including Methuen himself. Albeit ragged and often hungry, &#x27;s men roamed at will over vast areas and tied down tens of thousands of British troops. had an uncanny knack for avoiding ambush, leading many to believe that he was advised by the prophet Siener van Rensburg, who accompanied him. Despite some reverses, such as the Battle of Rooiwal in April 1902, &#x27;s commandos, numbering up to 3,000 men, remained in the field until the end of the war.

=== Chivalry ===
De la Rey was noted for chivalrous behaviour towards his enemies. For example, at Tweebosch on 7 March 1902 he captured Lieutenant General Methuen along with several hundred of his troops. The troops were sent back to their lines because had no means to support them, and Methuen was also released since he had broken his leg when his own horse had fallen on him.

==Peace==

In order to defeat the Boer guerrillas, the British (initially under Lord Roberts then under Lord Kitchener) adopted a scorched earth counter-insurgency policy which aimed to cut off all sources of aid to the &quot;Bittereinders&quot;. This included destroying all Boer-owned farmsteads in the South African Republic and the Orange Free State and interning captured Boer civilians in concentration camps, which had high mortality rates due to a combination of infectious disease outbreaks and abysmal camp conditions. These attritional tactics slowly eroded the will of the remaining Boer guerrillas in the field to continue the fight, and they gradually came to the conclusion that a peace agreement with the British was necessary to prevent further suffering among the Boer population.

The British offered terms of peace on various occasions, most notably in March 1901, but Botha rejected the idea. Lord Kitchener requested that meet with him at Klerksdorp on 11 March 1902 for a parley. The two enemies formed a bond of friendship which gave confidence in the sincerity of the British proposals. Diplomatic efforts to find a way out of the conflict continued and eventually led to an agreement to hold peace talks at Vereeniging, in which took part and urged peace. The belligerents signed the Treaty of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902. and General Botha visited England and the United States later in the same year. The Boers, promised eventual self-government (granted in 1906 and 1907 for the Transvaal and Orange Free State respectively), received £3,000,000 compensation, while acknowledging the sovereignty of Edward VII.

After the war travelled to Europe with Louis Botha and Christiaan de Wet to raise funds for the impoverished Boers whose families and farms had been devastated. In 1903 he was in India and Ceylon, persuading the prisoners of war interned there to take the oath of allegiance and return to South Africa. Finally he returned to his own farm with his wife and remaining children. Jacoba had spent most of the war trekking in the veld with her children and a few faithful servants; she subsequently wrote a book about her wanderings, &quot;Myne Omzwervingen en Beproevingen Gedurende den Oorlog&quot; (1903), which was translated into English as &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Wanderings and Trials During the Anglo-Boer War&quot; translated by Lucy Hotz, and published in London (1903).

==Political career==
In 1907 was elected to the colonial Transvaal Parliament, and he was one of the delegates to the National Convention which led to the Union of South Africa in 1910. He became a Senator and supported Louis Botha, the first Prime Minister, in his attempts to unite Boer and British. An opposing faction led by Hertzog wished to establish republican government as soon as possible and resisted co-operation with the British.

Serious violence broke out in 1914 when white miners on the Rand clashed with police and troops over the use of black miners. commanded the government forces and the strikes were put down, but a dangerous atmosphere had formed.

==Opposition to South Africa&#x27;s involvement in World War I==
With the outbreak of the First World War, a crisis ensued when Louis Botha agreed to send troops to take over the German colony of South West Africa (now Namibia). Many Boers were opposed to fighting for Britain and against Germany. Also, many were of German descent and Germany had been sympathetic to their struggle so they looked to for leadership. In Parliament he advocated neutrality and stated that he was utterly opposed to war unless South Africa was attacked. Nevertheless, he was persuaded by Botha and Jan Smuts not to take any actions which might arouse the Boers. appears to have been torn between loyalty to his comrades-in-arms, most of whom had joined the Hertzog faction, and his sense of honour.

Siener van Rensburg attracted large crowds with accounts of his visions in which he saw the whole world consumed by war and the end of the British Empire. On 2 August he told of a dream in which he saw General returning home bare-headed in a carriage adorned with flowers, while a black cloud with the number 15 on it poured down blood. The excited Boers took this as a sign that would be triumphant, but van Rensburg himself believed the dream warned of death.

===Death===
On 15 September 1914 Christian Frederick Beyers, Commandant-General of the armed forces and an old comrade of , resigned his commission and sent his car to fetch the latter from Johannesburg to Pretoria as he wished to consult with him. The two generals then set out that evening for Potchefstroom military camp where General JCG Kemp had also resigned. They encountered several police roadblocks but refused to stop; the roadblocks had in fact been set to capture the Foster gang. At Langlaagte the police fired on the speeding car and a bullet struck &#x27;s back, ending his life; his last words were &quot;dit is raak&quot; (&#x27;It hit&#x27;). He returned to his Lichtenburg farm as van Rensburg had predicted. Many Boers were convinced he had been deliberately assassinated, while others could not believe that he would have joined a rebellion, breaking his oath. According to Beyers, the plan was to co-ordinate the simultaneous resignation of all the senior officers in protest at the attack on South West Africa. The theory of a government assassination holds sway to this day.

Not long after &#x27;s funeral the short-lived Maritz rebellion broke out and De Wet, Beyers, General Maritz, commander of a force on the border of the German colony, Kemp, and other Boer veterans took up arms again but most of the army remained loyal and the rebellion was swiftly put down by Botha and Smuts. The rebels were pardoned just two years later by Botha in the interests of national reconciliation. While would probably have been quite capable of taking to the field again at 67, it seems unlikely he would have gone against his word, especially as he had played such a leading role in bringing about the peace of Vereeniging.

De la Rey was buried in the Lichtenburg graveyard, where a bronze bust by sculptor Fanie Eloff adorns his grave. &#x27;s home on Elandsfontein was demolished during the Boer War, but was rebuilt on the same foundation in 1902. The Voortrekkers movement placed a small memorial to him on his farm. &#x27;s equestrian statue on the square of Lichtenburg&#x27;s city hall, was sculpted by a town resident, Hennie Potgieter.

==In popular culture==
Interest in the life and career of General has made a resurgence in South Africa due to a popular Afrikaans song, &quot;&quot;, released by folk singer Bok van Blerk in 2005. The song concerns an Orange Free State partisan facing impending defeat, the loss of his farm, and the incarceration of his family in a concentration camp during the Second Boer War. Contemplating what he feels is certain destruction for the Afrikaner people, he calls on to lead their people to victory.

The Department of Arts and Culture responded to a request for a statement on van Blerk&#x27;s potentially subversive lyrics, insisting that the song was &quot;in danger of being hijacked by a minority of right-wingers&quot;, and warning that &quot;those who incite treason, whatever methods they employ, might well find themselves in difficulties with the law.&quot; The Democratic Alliance opposition party has retorted that &quot;&quot; was not nearly as potentially subversive as ANC president Jacob Zuma&#x27;s song &quot;Umshini wami&quot; (Zulu for &quot;bring me my machine [gun]&quot;).

De la Rey is an antagonist in the book Assegai (novel) by the novelist, Wilbur Smith.

<text>CJOH-DT (channel 13) is a television station in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, serving the National Capital Region as part of the CTV Television Network. It is owned and operated by network parent Bell Media alongside Pembroke-licensed CTV 2 outlet CHRO-TV (channel 5). The two stations share studios with Bell&#x27;s Ottawa radio properties at the Market Media Mall building on George Street in downtown Ottawa&#x27;s ByWard Market; CJOH-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located on the Ryan Tower at Camp Fortune in Chelsea, Quebec, north of Gatineau.

== History ==

Founded by Ernie Bushnell, CJOH signed on for the first time on March 12, 1961. Initially, studio facilities were located at 29 Bayswater Avenue () until that September when operations were shifted over several weeks to a $2 million () complex at 1500 Merivale.

It acquired former Cornwall-based CBC affiliate CJSS-TV as a rebroadcaster in 1963, making CJSS the first television station in Canada to cease operations. The channel 6 transmitter in Deseronto became operational in 1972 to serve the Kingston and Belleville markets. Standard Broadcasting owned the station from 1975 to 1987; that year, after a CRTC decision authorized Baton Broadcasting to launch a new independent station in Ottawa, Standard responded to the potential new competition by selling CJOH to Baton, who then surrendered the new independent licence. Baton was renamed CTV Inc. in 1998 after gaining control of the CTV network the preceding year. CTV in turn would be purchased by Bell Canada and folded into Bell Globemedia, now Bell Media, in 2001.

On August 1, 1995, the station&#x27;s longtime sports anchor Brian Smith was shot in the station&#x27;s parking lot by Jeffrey Arenburg, a released mental patient with a history of threatening media personalities, who claimed the station was broadcasting messages inside his head. Smith died in hospital the following day. The incident led to renewed calls across Canada for strengthening of the Canadian government&#x27;s gun control legislation and provided the impetus for Brian&#x27;s Law (Ontario Bill 68) – an amendment of the Mental Health Act and Health Care Consent Act which introduced community treatment orders and new criteria for involuntary commitment to psychiatric facilities. Arenburg was released from a mental hospital in Penetanguishene in 2006, then imprisoned for two years for assaulting a U.S. border guard in 2008.

On August 28, 1996, BBS Ontario Incorporated received CRTC approval to add a new analog transmitter on UHF channel 47 at Pembroke, Ontario, to rebroadcast programming of CJOH-TV. CHRO-TV was also approved to disaffiliate from the CTV Television Network that same day.

The newsroom was destroyed by a four-alarm fire during the early morning hours of February 7, 2010, destroying equipment and the news archives. The building itself remained intact until it was demolished by the end of December 2011. An adjacent office building housing former sister station CKQB-FM was not affected by the fire.

CJOH&#x27;s news operations were permanently relocated to CTV&#x27;s ByWard Market building. This would be the first time the ByWard Market studios would have an evening newscast since the cancellation of sister station CHRO-TV&#x27;s &quot;A News&quot; in March 2009.

==Programming==
===Regular local programming===

With the exception of networked shows &quot;Your Morning&quot; (along with its predecessor &quot;Canada AM&quot;) and &quot;Question Period&quot;, none of these programs are available in high definition. 
* &quot;Regional Contact&quot;, with Joel Haslam since 1988 and Kathie Donovan from 1998 to 2012, was the second last local program on CJOH besides standard newscasts. The show was a weekly program that previously aired at 6:30 p.m. on Saturdays, but has been moved to Sunday at the same time beginning in September 2011. Episodes produced during or after 2007 are available as streaming media on CJOH&#x27;s website. The last episode featuring Donovan aired on May 13, 2012. CJOH has since discontinued &quot;Regional Contact&quot; as a weekly show, but it remains on the station as a weekly segment during the 6 p.m. newscasts.
* &quot;Question Period&quot; is a national program about Canadian politics produced in Ottawa since 1967. It is the last non-newscast local program on CJOH since the discontinuation of &quot;Regional Contact&quot;.

==News operation==
CJOH-DT presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in lieu of a local morning newscast (which instead airs on sister station CHRO), CJOH displays local news headlines on a news ticker during its broadcast of CTV&#x27;s semi-national morning program &quot;Your Morning&quot; (previously &quot;Canada AM&quot;).

Local newscasts (under the name &quot;CTV News&quot;) are aired weekdays at noon, 6 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. The newscasts were previously called &quot;Midday Newsline&quot;/&quot;Newsline&quot;/&quot;Nightline&quot; (depending on the time of day) from the 1970s until 1998, and &quot;CJOH News&quot; from 1998 to 2005. (In 1982, the 6 p.m. newscast &quot;Newsline&quot; became, for a brief time, Canada&#x27;s first 90-minute local supper hour newscast.) From December 10, 2011, to autumn 2012, the noon and 6 p.m. broadcasts broadcast for one hour, though the Sunday evening 6 p.m. broadcast remained a half-hour program. Since April 2012, the audio feed of CJOH&#x27;s 6 p.m. newscast is simulcast on sister radio station CFRA. The Sunday 6 p.m. newscast expanded to one hour in the fall of 2012.
On July 7, 2014, the station unveiled a new studio to accompany the transition to high definition news production. On August 28, 2017, CJOH launched a new hour of local news content titled CTV News at 5, part of expanded local newscasts announced in June of that year.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
====Analogue-to-digital conversion====
On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts, the station flash cut its digital signal into operation on VHF channel 13. The station&#x27;s news operations completed upgrades to high definition capabilities, and the first HD news broadcast took place on July 7, 2014, starting with the noon hour newscast.

===Spectrum reallocation===
As part of the CRTC/FCC spectrum reallocation, CJOH-DT was assigned channel 7 as its new frequency, but instead requested channel 16 (which should have gone to Deseronto) for its new frequency. This was given CRTC approval in March 2020. BellMedia was scheduled to carry out the move to channel 16 around July 3, 2020 marking the end of all VHF TV broadcasting in Ottawa.

===Former rebroadcasters===
A long list of CTV rebroadcasters nationwide were to shut down on or before August 31, 2009, as part of a political dispute with Canadian authorities on paid fee-for-carriage requirements for cable television operators.

On June 27, 2016, it was announced that Bell Media filed a proposal with the CRTC to shut down 40 of its television transmitters (all rebroadcasters of other stations), due to maintenance costs, high cable and satellite viewership, and no generation of revenue. Among the victims was the former CJSS-TV 8 Cornwall, the first station to rebroadcast CJOH-TV (since 1963).

On July 30, 2019, Bell Media was granted permission to close down CJOH-TV-6 (Deseronto) and CJOH-TV-47 (Pembroke) as part of Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2019-268. CJOH-TV-47 was shut down as of May 2, 2020, and CJOH-TV-6 was shut down on October 9 of the same year.

<doc id="423403" wikidata="Q582796" url="?curid=423403" title="Robert Kelly (poet)">
<text>Robert Kelly (born September 24, 1935) is an American poet associated with the deep image group. He was named the first Dutchess County poet laureate 2016-2017.

==Early life and education==
Kelly was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Samuel Jason and Margaret Rose Kelly &quot;née&quot; Kane. In 1935, he studied at the City College of the City University of New York, graduating with a degree in 1955. He then spent three years at Columbia University.

==Teaching career==
Kelly has worked as a translator and teacher, most notably at Bard College, where he has worked since 1961. Kelly&#x27;s other teaching positions have included Wagner College (1960–61), the University at Buffalo (1964), and the Tufts University Visiting Professor of Modern Poetry (1966–67). In addition, he has served as Poet in Residence at the California Institute of Technology (1971–72), Yale University (Calhoun College), University of Kansas, Dickinson College, and the University of Southern California.

Kelly is the Asher B. Edelman Professor of Literature at Bard College (1986–) and Co-Director of The Program in Written Arts. He is a Founding Member of the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts.

==Writing career==

Kelly, on his influences: ″I want to say the names of the great teachers from whom I learned what I could, and still am learning. Coleridge. Baudelaire. Pound. Apollinaire. Virgil. Aeschylus. Dante. Chaucer. Shakespeare. Dryden. Lorca. Rilke. Hölderlin. Stevens. Stein. Duncan. Olson. Williams. Blackburn. I mention only the dead, the dead are always different, and always changing. I mention them more or less in the order of when they came along in my life to teach me.″

Kelly has published more than fifty books of poetry and prose, including &quot;Red Actions: Selected Poems 1960-1993&quot; (1995) and a collection of short fictions, &quot;A Transparent Tree&quot; (1985). Many were published by the Black Sparrow Press. He also edited the anthology &quot;A Controversy of Poets&quot; (1965). Kelly was of great help to the Hungryalist group of poets of India during the trial of Malay Roy Choudhury, with whom he had correspondence, now archived at Kolkata.

Kelly received the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; First Annual Book Award (1980) for &quot;Kill the Messenger Who Brings Bad News&quot; and the American Book Award, Before Columbus Foundation (1991) for &quot;In Time&quot;. He serves on the contributing editorial board of the literary journal &quot;Conjunctions,&quot; as well as &quot;Poetry International&quot;. He is married to the translator Charlotte Mandell and is an adherent of Islam.

<text>CKWS-DT (channel 11) is a television station in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, part of the Global Television Network. Owned and operated by network parent Corus Entertainment, the station maintains studios on Queen Street in downtown Kingston, and its transmitter is located near Highway 95 on Wolfe Island, south of the city.

==History==

CKWS signed-on December 18, 1954, as an affiliate of the CBC network. It was originally a joint venture between Roy Thomson and the Davies family, owners of &quot;The Kingston Whig-Standard&quot; (the source of its callsign). The station has been sold three times: to the Kanatec Corporation, bought by Power Corporation in 1977 and to Corus in 1999.

Children across the country were exposed to CKWS programming in the late 1970s and 1980s by the &quot;Harrigan&quot; series – a particularly innocent and low budget show about a leprechaun, starring Barry Dale. Shelagh Rogers of CBC Radio fame started out presenting the weather for the station&#x27;s newscasts.

During its days as a private CBC affiliate, it aired the minimum amount of CBC programming (40 hours per week).

On May 20, 2015, Corus and Bell Media announced an agreement whereby Corus&#x27; CBC affiliates, including CKWS, would leave the public network and instead &quot;affiliate&quot; with CTV. The switch took effect on August 31, 2015. Most TV service providers serving the region also carry CBC owned-and-operated station CBOT Ottawa, and any that did not had to add a CBC affiliate such as CBOT to their basic services to comply with CRTC regulations. Legally, the partnership was described as a &quot;program supply agreement&quot;, and not as an &quot;affiliation&quot; (a term with specific legal implications under CRTC rules), as Corus maintained editorial control over the stations&#x27; programming and the ability to sell local advertising, and did not delegate responsibility for CTV programs aired by the station to Bell Media. Affiliations also require the consent of the CRTC.

The switch was approved by the Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications Commission on August 27, 2015, when it dismissed objections by Rogers Media (who argued that the change was an &quot;affiliation&quot; and thus required CRTC consent to implement, and was not in the public interest because it created duplicate sources of CTV programming), and by a resident who complained that as he only received television over the air, he would lose his ability to receive CBC Television as a result of the disaffiliation.

On August 14, 2018, it was announced that CKWS&#x27; agreement with CTV would expire on August 27; the station subsequently became a Global owned-and-operated station, rebranding itself as Global Kingston.

== News programming ==
Until 2024, CKWS produced 28 hours per week of local news programming, with hours each weekday, and one hour on Saturdays and Sundays. Prior to 2018, the station did not air any news programs on Sundays.

In September 2016, CKWS began to align its news programming with Global News rather than CTV News; it added airings of &quot;Global National&quot; in September 2016, and introduced a local morning show, &quot;The Morning Show&quot; (which was patterned after the &quot;Global News Morning&quot; format used in other markets, and shared its branding with the program of the same name aired by Global flagship station CIII-DT in Toronto), on October 17, 2016, replacing CTV&#x27;s national morning show &quot;Your Morning&quot;. At the same time, the station&#x27;s noon newscast was shortened to half an hour, the &quot;CTV National News&quot; was dropped, and the station rebranded its newscasts from &quot;Newswatch&quot; to &quot;CKWS News&quot;.

Due to cuts by Corus Entertainment, most of CKWS&#x27;s staff were laid off in July 2024, including much of the news department. Both CKWS and CHEX&#x27;s newscasts were suspended for a period, before returning in a regionalized format using contributions from local reporters. Corus stated that it had &quot;reimagined our broadcast schedule in Kingston, Peterborough, and Kelowna with a focus on supper hour and late-night news programming&quot;.
===Notable former on-air staff===
* Bill Luxton – first program director and news anchor
* Wayne Rostad – host
* Bill Welychka – anchor; also producer

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===

===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
In January 2013, CKWS applied to the CRTC to convert its main Kingston transmitter to digital. The station had not announced plans to convert its transmitters in Prescott and Smiths Falls to digital, but did convert its Brighton translator CKWS-TV-1 to digital channel 30 on August 31, 2011, as its former analogue UHF channel 66 is now out-of-band. The Brighton digital signal was not initially broadcast in HD as it went on-air before CKWS converted its cable TV feed (and, later, its main signal) to high-definition digital TV.

The main CKWS transmitter at Wolfe Island/Kingston flash cut to digital on July 5, 2013, on its existing frequency, VHF channel 11. The station was not obligated to convert this transmitter, as Kingston was not one of the 31 markets in which the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) imposed a mandatory analogue shutdown on August 31, 2011.

===Transmitters===
====Former transmitters====
Although CKWS&#x27; Smiths Falls repeater overlapped its signal with that of CBC owned-and-operated station CBOT/Ottawa while CKWS was a CBC affiliate, CKWS-TV-3 usually served the Brockville area, along with the station&#x27;s Prescott rebroadcaster. In 2018, Corus applied to the CRTC to shutdown several of its transmitters, including CKWS-TV-3.

As a result of a CRTC decision in December 2020, CKWS-DT-1 shuttered its transmitter in Brighton on August 31, 2022. CKWS-DT-1 is now available via sub-channel on CHEX-DT out of Peterborough. CKWS-DT-1 briefly broadcast on UHF 23 (virtual channel 30) before ultimately being shuttered as it was required to vacate UHF 30 as a result of the DTV repack.

<doc id="423411" wikidata="Q7957397" url="?curid=423411" title="WWNY-TV">
<text>WWNY-TV (channel 7) is a television station licensed to Carthage, New York, United States, serving as the CBS affiliate for the Watertown area. It is owned by Gray Media alongside low-power, Class A Fox affiliate WNYF-CD (channel 28). The two stations share studios on Arcade Street in downtown Watertown; WWNY-TV and WNYF-CD&#x27;s transmitters are located on the same tower along NY 126/State Street on Champion Hill.

WWNY-CD (channel 28) is a Class A station licensed to Massena, New York, which operates as a translator of WWNY-TV. This station&#x27;s transmitter is located at WNPI-DT&#x27;s site southeast of South Colton along NY 56.

==History==
WCNY-TV was granted a special temporary authority (STA) to begin broadcasting on October 14, 1954. It was locally owned by the &quot;Watertown Daily Times&quot;, which also owned WWNY radio (AM 790, now WTNY) in Watertown. The station carried programming from two networks at the time (CBS, ABC then added NBC by the program) but has always been a primary CBS affiliate. During the late-1950s, WCNY was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. By the mid-1960s, the station benefited from the ratings-dominant CBS programming lineup and established a large viewership base, including much of eastern Ontario, Canada. After the FCC allowed television and radio stations to share the same base call sign even when they were licensed to different cities, channel 7 changed call letters to WWNY-TV to match its radio sisters in July 1965. The WCNY-TV calls now reside on a PBS member station in nearby Syracuse.

The station was a major beneficiary of a quirk in the FCC&#x27;s plan for allocating stations. In the early days of broadcast television, there were twelve VHF channels available and 69 UHF channels (later reduced to 55 in 1983). The VHF bands were more desirable because they carried longer distances. Since there were only twelve VHF channels available, there were limitations as to how closely the stations could be spaced.

After the FCC&#x27;s &quot;Sixth Report and Order&quot; ended the license freeze and opened the UHF band in 1952, it devised a plan for allocating VHF licenses. Under this plan, almost all of the country would be able to receive two commercial VHF channels plus one noncommercial channel. Most of the rest of the country (&quot;1/2&quot;) would be able to receive a third VHF channel. Other areas would be designated as &quot;UHF islands&quot; since they were too close to larger cities for VHF service. The &quot;2&quot; networks became CBS and NBC, &quot;+1&quot; represented non-commercial educational stations, and &quot;1/2&quot; became ABC (which was the weakest network usually winding up with the UHF allocation where no VHF was available).

However, Watertown was sandwiched between Syracuse (channels 3, 8, later 5, and 9) to the south, Rochester (channels 6, later 8, 10, and 13) to the west, Utica (channel 13, later 2) and Albany (channel 4, later 6, later joined by 10 and 13) to the southeast, Burlington–Plattsburgh (channels 3 and 5) to the east, Kingston (channel 11) to the northwest, Ottawa (channels 4 and 9, later joined by 13) to the north, and Montreal (channels 2, 6, 10, and 12) to the northeast. This created a large &quot;doughnut&quot; where there could only be &quot;one&quot; VHF license. WWNY was fortunate to gain that license, and as a result was the only television station based in the Watertown market until the early 1970s.

From 1958 until 1971, WCNY/WWNY also aired educational programming through National Educational Television (NET, becoming PBS in 1970) provided by the St. Lawrence Valley Educational Television Council. When the council established its own PBS member station, WNPE-TV (now WPBS-TV) in 1971, WWNY donated its original studios to the new station as it had moved to its current location near the &quot;Watertown Daily Times&quot; offices on Arcade Street in Downtown Watertown in mid-February 1970. The Johnson family sold WWNY to United Communications Corporation in 1981 for $8.2 million after an unsuccessful struggle against the FCC and its directive for newspapers to divest themselves of television stations held within the same market.

Until WFYF (now WWTI) signed-on in 1988 replacing a small WUTR repeater on analog UHF channel 50 and taking the ABC affiliation, WWNY was Watertown&#x27;s only commercial station. As a primary CBS affiliate, WWNY carried the network&#x27;s full prime time schedule and news programs while cherry-picking the most popular ABC and NBC shows aired at other hours. The station also aired some Fox programming starting in 1987 while Sunday Fox Sports National Football League games aired on WWTI. When cable arrived in the region in the 1970s, viewers could watch the full network schedules via NBC affiliate WSTM-TV and ABC affiliate WIXT (now WSYR-TV) in Syracuse or NBC affiliate WPTZ in Plattsburgh.

Channel 7 gradually phased out non-CBS programming in the 1980s. ABC completely disappeared from the schedule when WFYF signed-on. NBC programs (including &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;) remained on WWNY into the 1980s with some prime time programming (which aired delayed) lasting until 1995. After that, viewers received NBC programming from either WSTM or WPTZ, depending on location, until December 1, 2016, when WVNC-LD signed on as Watertown&#x27;s first full-time NBC affiliate. Fox programs largely disappeared in the early-1990s with the exception of Major League Baseball games from Fox Sports which lasted until 1998.

On February 8, 2019, Gray Television announced it was purchasing the United stations, including WWNY-TV, WNYF-CD and WWNY-CD. In advance of the purchase, Gray assumed control of the stations via a local marketing agreement (LMA) on March 1. WWNY-TV, WNYF-CD and WWNY-CD would be Gray&#x27;s first stations in New York State; the acquisition would make them sister stations to fellow CBS affiliate WCAX-TV in adjacent Burlington, Vermont, another station owned by a small independent operator (in WCAX&#x27;s case, the Hasbrook-Martin family) before Gray bought the station in 2017. The sale was completed on May 1.

===Translator history===
WWNY-CD was originally a repeater for ABC affiliate WWTI (channel 50) with the call sign W28BC. During that time, WWTI and WWNY had secondary affiliations with Fox. WWNY&#x27;s secondary affiliation was for NFL games during the years CBS did not have broadcasting rights of the league. When that network acquired the rights to the AFC, WWTI then aired NFC games from Fox, in addition to ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; (now on fellow Disney network ESPN).

In 2001, United Communications and WWNY entered into an agreement with Smith Broadcasting to make W28BC and sister station W25AB full-time Fox affiliates; Smith formerly owned WWTI, but did not include the translators in that station&#x27;s sale to Ackerley Group in 2000. W25AB then changed its call letters to WNYF-LP and eventually moved from channel 25 to channel 28; after the Watertown station upgraded to Class A status in October 2002 (becoming WNYF-CA, later WNYF-CD), W28BC inherited the WNYF-LP call sign. WNYF-LP&#x27;s low-powered analog signal on UHF channel 28 aired from a transmitter on NY 420 in Massena.

On June 30, 2009, United Communications applied to the FCC for a digital version of WNYF-LP on UHF channel 18. This allocation was formerly used for WNPI-DT&#x27;s analog signal. It was approved for construction on June 8, 2010. Taking on the WNYF-LD call sign, it is officially licensed as a translator of WWNY-TV. This helps St. Lawrence County viewers who had experienced difficulty receiving WWNY&#x27;s digital signal after that station transitioned to digital-only broadcasts.

On May 15, 2013, WNYF-CD and WNYF-LD swapped call signs, as the Massena station is licensed as a class A facility while the Watertown digital station, at that time, was not. On February 6, 2014, WNYF-CD changed its call letters to WWNY-CD; on March 13, 2014, the class A status for the Watertown station was transferred from the analog channel 28 license to the digital channel 35 license, retaking the WNYF-CD call sign.

==News operation==
On the same night it began airing in 1954, WWNY produced a five-minute local update at 11:15. For its entire existence, the station has held the number one spot in area Nielsen ratings by a wide margin. WWNY has traditionally been the dominant outlet in the North Country because it had the market to itself until WWTI signed-on in 1987. That station&#x27;s two attempts at local newscasts—from 1987 to 1991 and from 1995 to 2004—never made any headway in the ratings, and WWNY remained the most-watched and highest-rated station. Since 2004, it has been the only station in the market with a functioning news department.

In 1981, this station&#x27;s weekday morning show only consisted of two five-minute cut-ins. As late as 1998, it was broadcasting for thirty minutes. In 2004, the station began producing ninety minutes of news on weekday mornings.

On April 11, 2001, WWNY began airing a 35-minute weeknight prime time broadcast at 10 on WNYF called &quot;7 News Tonight on Fox&quot;. However, it was only seen by a handful of viewers able to receive that station&#x27;s two low-power over-the-air signals because WNYF was not yet being offered on cable. An agreement with Time Warner Cable (now Charter Spectrum) in fall 2001 placed the station on the system and the prime time news debuted for the rest of the area on October 4.

WNYF currently simulcasts the 6 a.m. hour of WWNY&#x27;s weekday morning news. It then offers a second hour at 7 a.m. seen exclusively on the Fox affiliate while this station airs &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;. The simulcast and separate show is known on WNYF as &quot;7 News This Morning on Fox&quot;. There is no weekday morning or noon meteorologist; news anchor Beth Hall presents a forecast from AccuWeather during these segments. During the nightly evening weather forecasts, the station features a live National Weather Service weather radar based in Montague&#x27;s Parkers section.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The stations&#x27; signals are multiplexed:


===Analog-to-digital transition===
In May 2003, WWNY started broadcasting its digital signal on UHF channel 35 and began offering CBS programming in high definition. It then created a new second digital subchannel to offer a digital signal of WNYF as that station did not operate one of its own due to analog-only Class A and low-power signals.

WWNY has been digital-only since February 17, 2009. Both broadcasts of WWNY and WWTI were set to become digital-only starting on February 17. However, the latter&#x27;s plans were delayed to June 12 by the FCC. WWNY-DT&#x27;s previous digital facilities on channel 35 were eventually re-employed by sister station WNYF to offer Fox in high definition for the first time.

<doc id="423413" wikidata="Q926271" url="?curid=423413" title="Highways in Poland">
<text>Controlled-access highways in Poland are part of the national roads network and they are divided into motorways and expressways. Both types of highways feature grade-separated interchanges with all other roads, emergency lanes, feeder lanes, wildlife crossings and dedicated roadside rest areas. Motorways differ from expressways in their technical parameters like designated speed, permitted road curvature, lane widths or minimal distances between interchanges. Moreover, expressways might have single-carriageway sections in case of low traffic densities (as of 2025, such sections constitute 3.5% of the highway network).

The development of modern highways began in the 1970s, but proceeded very slowly under the communist rule and for the first years afterwards: between 1970 and 2000 only 434 km of highways were constructed in total (5% of the planned network). Further 1050 km (13% of the network) were opened from 2001 to 2010, followed by 2773 km (34% of the network) constructed between 2011 and 2020. It is planned to open about 2500 km (31%) in the 2020s, while the last about 1400 km (17%) would be completed in the 2030s.

, there are 5205.5 km of motorways and expressways in operation (62% of the intended network), while contracts for construction of further 1335 km (16% of the network) are ongoing.

Except for the single-carriageway expressways, both types of highways fulfill the definition of a motorway as specified by OECD, WRA or Vienna Convention. Speed limits in Poland are 140 km/h on motorways and 120 km/h on expressways (100 km/h for single-carriageway expressway sections). Some motorway stretches are tolled.

== Technical parameters ==
* Motorways are public roads with controlled access which are designated for motor vehicles only, and feature two carriageways with at least two continuous lanes each, divided by a median. They have no single-level intersections with any roads or other forms of land and water transport, and have wildlife crossings constructed above the road. They feature emergency lanes and feeder lanes, and are equipped with dedicated roadside rest areas. Motorways are the only roads in Poland which use blue background on road signs; others use green road signs.
* Expressways share most of the characteristics of motorways, differing mainly in that:

# Expressways are designated for lower speed than motorways. For example, the road curvature can be more severe and the lanes are usually narrower (3.5m vs 3.75m). Emergency lanes can also be narrower (2.5m vs 3m) and in exceptional situations expressways might not have them at all.
# Expressways can have a single carriageway on sections with low traffic density.
# Motorways can have interchanges only with main roads, and the distance between interchanges is typically not less than 15 km (or 5 km near major cities), while expressways typically have more frequent interchanges. In exceptional situations, expressways might not have dedicated feeder lanes on interchanges. In theory, expressways are also allowed to have a one-level junction with a minor public road in exceptional cases, however in 2020 the last such remaining junction in Poland was reconstructed as a two-level interchange.

== List of motorways and expressways ==

In 2004, the government published the ordinance defining the planned highway network of length about . Notable changes introduced in later amendments include re-routing S8 and adding S61 instead (a change related to the Rospuda Valley conflict), introducing S16, S52 and A/S50, as well as extending S5, S8 and S10, raising the total length to about .

The planned network consists of 16 major highways (over 200 km of intended length): A1, S3, S5, S7, S11, S17, S19, S61 running north to south and A2/S2, A4, S6/A6, S8/A8, S10, S12, S16, S74 running west to east, as well as 9 shorter highways:

=== Cross-sections ===

As of January 2025, the operational sections of highways utilize the following cross-sections:
* 7% (367 km) – motorways and expressways with 2x3 or (occasionally) 2x4 or 2x5 lanes,
* 89.5% (4660 km) – motorways and expressways with 2x2 lanes,
* 3.5% (178 km) – single-carriageway expressways, of which 69 km with dual-carriageway fragments (2x2) around the interchanges.

All single-carriageway expressways are constructed with allocated space for a possible upgrade to dual-carriageway and all bridges above such highways are prepared to accommodate the second carriageway. Most of those sections are planned to be widened to full profile by 2033, the exceptions being S1 (near the Slovak border) and S22 (near the border with Kaliningrad Oblast) where widening is currently not expected.

=== Substandard highways ===

Motorways and expressways constructed before 1999 do not have to fulfill technical parameters defined by the ministry ordinance. As of 2024, one notable case of a substandard highway remains:
* A4 on the section Krzyżowa – Wrocław (103 km) was constructed in years 1934 – 1937 (then the territory of Nazi Germany) and renovated in years 2002 – 2006. The road received new high quality surface but the geometry was kept unchanged and many overpasses above the motorway were kept. In effect, this part has no emergency lanes and the speed limit is decreased to 110 km/h. Its full reconstruction (and widening to three lanes per direction) is scheduled for years 2027 – 2031.

Notable historical cases are:
Historical cases

* S3 near Szczecin (19 km) was opened in 1979 and it featured two at-grade road intersections, as the last such expressway section in Poland, until the reconstruction in years 2019 – 2020.
* A6 near Szczecin (29 km) was constructed by Nazi Germany and kept using the original surface made of concrete slabs until the reconstruction conducted in years 1996 – 1999 and (easternmost fragment) 2017 – 2021.
* A18 (70 km) had its southern carriageway constructed by Nazi Germany. The northern carriageway was constructed in 2004 – 2006, while the southern carriageway kept using the original concrete slabs until the reconstruction conducted in years 2020 – 2023.
== Speed limits ==
===Other restrictions===
*Pedestrians, bicycles, mopeds, and agricultural vehicles are not allowed on motorways.
*Minimum speed on motorways is 40 km/h except in extraordinary circumstances (e.g. snow, ice, or a car broken down).
*It is forbidden to stop except in extraordinary circumstances, or to travel backwards.
*Towing is not allowed on motorways, but is permitted on expressways.

== Tolls ==
Since 2023, all state-owned highways are free for vehicles up to 3.5 tons of permissible maximum weight (for a passenger car with a trailer, the joint permissible maximum weight of the car and the trailer must not exceed 3.5 tons). On some sections, the old infrastructure for toll collection is still in place.

The privately owned sections of A1, A2 and A4 are tolled. These sections are indicated by the motorway sign accompanied by the word Płatna.
=== Vehicles over 3.5 tons and buses ===
Using e-Toll is obligatory for buses as well as all vehicles with maximum permissible weight exceeding 3.5 tons (including the trailer) while driving on the Polish roads (not just the highways). More details can be found on the e-Toll website.

== Traffic volumes ==

Traffic volumes in Poland note rapid increase since the fall of communism in 1989: the annual average daily traffic recorded in 2020 amounts to over 360% of the average traffic recorded in 1990. With the increasing traffic, the length of overburdened single-carriageway national roads had also been steadily increasing until reaching the maximum of 1389 km in 2010. Due to the large number of highway sections opened between 2010 and 2020, in that decade the length of overburdened roads has fallen down for the first time in history, from 1389 km in 2010 to 1121 km in 2020.

The latest general measurement was conducted in 2020, although some measurement days were moved to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic which would have caused the results from 2020 to be unreliable. The following highways recorded the highest volumes:
The other highest and lowest recorded AADT values were:
The new general measurement is being conducted throughout 2025.

==History==
=== Before World War II ===

The first plans of creation of a national highway network in Poland were conceived in the interwar period:
Plans
The main promoter of this concept was Professor Melchior Wladyslaw Nestorowicz of the Warsaw University of Technology, who organized three Road Congresses, during which a group of specialists discussed the creation of the network. On 5 March 1939, in the trade magazine Drogowiec, Professor Nestorowicz proposed a very ambitious plan for the construction of almost 5,000 kilometres of category I and II roads, based on similar programmes in Germany and Italy. Nestorowicz sketched a map of the future system with the following routes:

First class roads would, according to the plans, consist of the following motorways (totalling some :
* Warsaw - Łódź - 100 km
* Warsaw – Poznań - Polish-German border - 350 km
* Warsaw beltway - 130 km
* Poznań beltway - 80 km
* Gdynia – Bydgoszcz – Łódź – 500 km
* Łódź beltway - 90 km
* Bytow - Free City of Danzig border - 50 km
* Katowice – Kraków – Lwów - 375 km
* Warsaw – Lublin - Lwów – Sniatyn - Polish-Romanian border - 550 km
* Puławy – Sandomierz – Przemyśl - 175 km

Second class roads would consist of the following motorways, totalling another :
* Piotrków Trybunalski - Kielce - Sandomierz - 180 km
* Warsaw – Kielce – Kraków - 180 km
* Łódź - Kalisz - Polish-German border north of Wrocław - 130 km
* Warsaw – Grodno – Vilnius – Polish - Lithuania - Latvian border near Daugavpils - 575 km
* Grodno - Nowogrodek - Polish-Soviet border near Minsk - 190 km
* Bydgoszcz – Poznań – Częstochowa - 350 km
* Katowice – Cieszyn – Polish-Czechoslovak border - 60 km
* Ostrołęka - Polish-East Prussian border - 50 km
* Grodno - Polish-Lithuanian border - 40 km
* Grodno - Brzesc nad Bugiem - Krasnystaw - 300 km
* Warsaw – Brzesc nad Bugiem - 170 km
In 1934, Nazi Germany started the construction of their motorway system, parts of which today form A18 and A4 to Wrocław (Breslau), as well as A6 (Szczecin bypass) and S22 (parts of the planned motorway to Königsberg). About half of them were constructed as single-carriageway with the intention of adding a second carriageway in later years. However, after 1938, warfare expenses meant little money would be invested into any infrastructure and only one 9 km single-carriageway piece west of Gliwice (now A4) was constructed.

In Poland, a 28 km stretch between Warlubie and Osiek (now DW214) was constructed in 1937 – 1939 in the motorway standard of the time (today not considered a highway) with a concrete surface, which was designed by Italian engineer Piero Puricelli. The motorway was planned to reach Gdynia, but the outbreak of the Second World War halted the plans.

=== 1945 – 1972 ===

The Potsdam conference defined the borders for communist Poland, which were very different from the pre-1939 ones. It received the so-called Regained Territories from the former Third Reich with the aforementioned motorway sections (some of them with first carriageway only). Most of the motorway bridges were destroyed by the warfare, but only a few were repaired or rebuilt in the first post-war years. The bridge over Ina river was reconstructed in 1972, and those on S22 only between 1996 and 2003.

Apart from the bridges, almost all the motorways were left in the same condition as they were in 1945 until the mid-1990s. The only road left from Nazi times that was completed by the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland was a one-carriageway small section between Łęczyca and Lisowo (15 km of what is now DW142), which was built on the previous works of Nazis.

Plans
At the post-war year there were very ambitious plans to make a motorway network for the whole Poland. For example, engineer Eugeniusz Buszma has published his propositions to the network in the magazine &quot;Drogowiec&quot; (1946, issue 1):
# East – West (Słubice – Warsaw – Białystok) – 680 km
# North – South (Gdynia – Warsaw – Balkans) – 650 km
# Silesia – Baltic I (Gdańsk – Łódź – Katowice) – 460 km
# Pomeranian (Gdańsk – Szczecin) – 280 km
# Silesian (Wrocław – Katowice – Kraków) – 190 km
# Mazurian (Kaliningrad – Elbląg – Malbork) – 20 km
# Silesia – Baltic II (Bydgoszcz – Wrocław) – 260 km
# Łódź – Wrocław – (Prague) – 310 km
# Katowice – (Vienna) – 60 km
# Poznań – Szczecin – 200 km
# Radom – Lublin – (Lviv) – 220 km
In total, the mileage, according to the proposal, would total more than .

After the addition of the sections built by the Third Reich the total network length had to be approx. 3700 km. In 1963 the Motorization Council at the Council of Ministers had presented the similar plan plus the motorways: Warsaw-Kraków-Zakopane, Kraków-Przemyśl, Warsaw-Bydgoszcz-Koszalin, Poznań-Koszalin i Warsaw-Terespol (approx. 1250 km).

Despite announcing such pompous plans, no motorway was opened in the meantime.

=== In the 1970s ===

Only in the 1970s did any works start.
Plans
In 1972 it was planned to build:
* the Gliwice-Kraków motorway (now A4)
* the second carriageway of the Wrocław-Gliwice motorway (also A4)
* the Warsaw-Katowice motorway (so-called &quot;Gierkówka&quot;, now the S8/A1 road), in the near future

The plans were expanded in 1976 by the following sections:
* Tarnów – Kraków (now A4),
* eastern GOP (Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy) bypass (now S1, northern part),
* Bielsko-Biała – Cieszyn (now S52, southern part),
* Warszawa – Poznań (so-called Olimpijka, now A2),
* Łódź – Piotrków Trybunalski (now A1).
In 1973 – 1976, &quot;Gierkówka&quot; dual carriageway from Warsaw to Katowice () was built. Originally planned as a motorway, it was in the end constructed by adding another carriageway to the existing road, hence going through many villages and crossing with local roads. The part from Piotrków Trybunalski to Częstochowa (78 km) was constructed on a new route in a motorway alignment, but nonetheless the majority of the crossings between the highway and the other roads were constructed as one-level intersections with no viaducts or overpasses.

=== In the 1980s ===

Near the end of the 1970s the first construction of motorways started and continued to the next decade. The roads opened in the 1980s were the first motorways and expressways which generally meet the contemporary standards (at least with respect to their more important attributes), although in multiple cases the poor quality of their construction forced major renovations to be performed as soon as within the first 20 years of operation.

The major routes planned as motorways were A1, A2 and A4, while other main routes were planned as expressways. The implementation of these plans, however, came at a very slow pace: throughout the 1980s, only an average of of highways in the whole country were being opened per year.

=== In the 1990s ===
In the III Republic of Poland, planned S3 was promoted to motorway A3 (the decision was later reversed) and a plan was introduced (also later reversed) of constructing motorway A8 Łódź – Wrocław – Bolków (now S8/A8/S5). Szczecin bypass (A6) and section Olszyna – Krzywa (then named A12, now A4/A18) were promoted to motorways, even though at that time the majority of their lengths was in bad shape, laid with the original concrete surface from the 1930s with no significant works having been performed on any of them throughout the whole communist period.

=== In the 2000s ===

As of the beginning of 2000, the vast majority of national and international traffic routes were served by regular national roads with at-grade intersections and pedestrian crossings, most of them leading through the centres of cities, towns and villages, and most of them single carriageway. Only the following number of highways was present:
:* about of modern dual-carriageway motorways and expressways (3.5% of the network as planned nowadays),
:* about of single-carriageway expressways,
:* about of not-resurfaced Nazi German motorways from the 1930s,
:* about of not-resurfaced Nazi German motorways on sections where only the first carriageway had been constructed.

==== Before Poland received the EU membership ====
At the beginning of the 21st century, the tempo of highway construction started to increase. The main focus was on the west–east motorways A4 and A2. In 2002, a long-awaited renovation of the A4 from Krzywa to Wrocław (93 km) has started, which included laying new high quality surface in place of the Nazi German concrete slabs, reconstruction of all the pre-WWII bridges on the motorway and renovation of the viaducts above the motorway.

This is also the period when Poland started introducing motorway tolls, first in 2000 for the A4 section between Mysłowice and Kraków.

==== Poland in European Union ====
1 May 2004 was a crucial day for the history of motorway construction and that is when the length of highway constructions increased the most. One of the major advantages of signing the European Union access document was that Poland could get access to large funds for co-financing the construction of new roads and upgrades of the existing road infrastructure.

These years, the existing scattered pieces of highways began to converge into the basis of the future network:
* until 2004, Katowice and Kraków (linked by A4) were the only pair of Poland&#x27;s largest cities connected by a highway;
* in 2005, A4 connected Wrocław with Katowice and Kraków, while in 2009 – with Germany;
* in 2006, A2 connected Poznań with Łódź.
A large number of expressway bypasses of towns were also constructed at this time. On many of them, only one carriageway was built, with the allocated space prepared for easy construction of the second carriageway later.

===2011 – 2015===

In the five years from 2011 to 2015, 1563 kilometers of motorways and expressways were opened – about as much as in the whole prior history of highway construction combined. The main 
focus was on developing connections between Poland&#x27;s largest cities, especially those serving as host venues of UEFA Euro 2012, as well as on extending A4 towards Ukraine. 
The sections opened in 2011 – 2015 belonged to the following highways:
* : + 273 km (A1 on the section Gdańsk – Łódź was completed in 2014)
* : + 234 km (A2 on the section Germany – Warsaw was completed in 2012)
* : + 88 km (S3 on the section Szczecin – A2 – Zielona Góra was completed in 2013, except that its older single-carriageway parts remained so until 2017)
* : + 183 km
* : + 138 km
* : + 365 km (S8 on the section Wrocław – Łódź was completed in 2014)
* : + 282 km in total

===2016 – 2020===

After the peak of investments before Euro 2012, very few new contracts for road construction were signed in 2012 and 2013. This resulted in a small number of sections being opened in 2015 and 2016, a large share of which were the last delayed fragments originally scheduled for a Euro 2012 opening. In particular:
* In 2016, the last delayed fragment of between Kraków and Ukraine was opened, making A4 the first major Polish highway completed on its whole length, as well as the first complete border-to-border highway connection.
* Also in 2016, the delayed bypass of Łódź was finished, making completed on its whole route except for those sections where national road 1 had already been a dual carriageway (see In the 1970s), allowing for a significantly lower priority of constructing the remaining stretch compared to other highways.

Since 2014, the number of signed contracts has risen again, resulting in the number of road openings having risen again since 2017.

The sections opened in 2016 – 2020 belonged to the following highways:
* : + 173 km
* : + 227 km (S5 on the section Poznań – Wrocław was completed in 2019)
* : + 128 km (S6 on the section Szczecin – Koszalin was completed in 2019)
* : + 213 km
* : + 128 km (S8 was completed in 2019 on its originally intended route from Wrocław to Białystok; an extension to Kłodzko was later added to the plans)
* : + 97 km (S17 on the section Warsaw – Lublin was completed in 2020)
* : + 315 km in total (A4 was completed in 2016)

===2021 – 2025===

The high tempo of highway development continued in the 2020s. The main focus was on construction of new highways in the less populated eastern Poland, including the international routes Via Carpatia and Via Baltica.
The sections opened, or planned to get opened, in 2021 – 2025 belong to the following highways:
* : + 81 km (A1 was completed in 2022)
* : + 106 km
* : + 104 km (S3 is scheduled to get completed in 2025)
* : + 138 km 
* : + 159 km (S7 on the section Warsaw – Kraków was completed in 2024; a temporary detour through Kraków north-western bypass will be in use until Kraków eastern bypass is completed in 2026)
* : + 80 km
* : + 70 km (reconstruction of the second carriageway of A18 was completed in 2023)
* : + 163 km (S19 &quot;Via Carpathia&quot; on the section Lublin – Rzeszów was completed in 2022, except that its older fragment with 2+1 lanes will remain so until 2026)
* : + 183 km (S61 &quot;Via Baltica&quot; was opened on the whole length in 2024, the second carriageway is scheduled to get completed in 2025)
* : + 206 km in total (S5 was completed in 2022 except its newly planned extensions to Ostróda and Bolków)

<text>WCFE-TV (channel 57) is a PBS member television station licensed to Plattsburgh, New York, United States, serving the Champlain Valley and Greater Montreal areas. Owned by the Mountain Lake Public Telecommunications Council, the station maintains studios at One Sesame Street in Plattsburgh, and its transmitter is located atop Lyon Mountain, between Plattsburgh and nearby Malone. WCFE-TV is branded as Mountain Lake PBS; this name was adopted to reflect Plattsburgh&#x27;s location between the Adirondacks and Lake Champlain.

WCFE-TV services northeastern New York, most of Vermont, Eastern Ontario, Canada (including Cornwall and parts of Ottawa), and parts of Southern Quebec (including Montreal) on cable, and parts of New Hampshire and northern New York east of Massena on satellite.

==History==
WCFE-TV signed on March 6, 1977, from its studios at SUNY Plattsburgh. In 1993, it rebranded itself as &quot;Mountain Lake PBS&quot; to reflect its growing viewership.

From 1990 to 1996, WCFE-TV had a sister NPR station, WCFE-FM on 91.9. However, in a case of exceptionally bad timing, WCFE-FM signed on just as North Country Public Radio began building a number of satellites and repeaters in the WCFE-TV service area. It did not help matters that much of the area got a strong signal from Vermont Public Radio flagship WVPS in Burlington. It soon became apparent that Plattsburgh was too small for a standalone NPR station to be viable. Realizing that it was up against two established public radio broadcasters with more resources than it could hope to match, Mountain Lake sold WCFE-FM to Albany&#x27;s WAMC in 1996, who operates 91.9 as a repeater, WCEL.

===2007 transmitter tower collapse===
On April 18, 2007, WCFE&#x27;s transmitter tower located on Lyon Mountain completely collapsed as a result of heavy amounts of ice and snow from the April 2007 Nor&#x27;easter, and partially damaged the transmitter building at the base. The station started rebuilding a transmitter tower. In the meantime, the direct fiber optic lines to the local Charter Communications franchise were unaffected, and the station continued to broadcast on cable. On April 23, 2007, WCFE-TV went back on the air as a temporary digital subchannel of WCAX-TV, broadcast from Mount Mansfield, Vermont. WCFE-TV was multicast on WCAX&#x27;s digital channel 53, mapped to virtual channel 57.1. On August 10, 2007, WCAX-TV discontinued carriage of WCFE-TV, when interim facilities were established.

Following the collapse, cable viewers outside of the New York side of the Plattsburgh–Burlington market had to rely on distant affiliates for PBS programming. Cable systems in Vermont and some systems in Montérégie continued to have access to Vermont Public Television stations, while Videotron systems in the latter region that offered WCFE-TV substituted its signal with that of Detroit&#x27;s WTVS. On April 27, WCFE-TV&#x27;s signal was reestablished on Videotron, which received WCFE-TV&#x27;s signal from its temporary transmitter.

In addition, WPTZ donated its internet streaming facilities to WCFE-TV, which was used for WCFE-TV&#x27;s annual &quot;Art Auction&quot;, which took place as scheduled, shortly after the collapse.

The transmitter that was damaged was a Thomson TBM unit. The company was able to provide one of their Affinity transmitters on lease to the station within two weeks of getting the request from the station. This temporary transmitter was located at the station&#x27;s studio location until they could get the main transmitter facility repaired (which was a very involved process due to site access issues).

On October 9, 2007, WCFE-TV&#x27;s new tower at Lyon Mountain went into service, almost six months after the collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCAX-TV News Script for 10/9/2007&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; WCFE-TV&#x27;s digital signal went on the air on October 23.

==Challenges==
WCFE-TV is in a unique market. Across Lake Champlain to the east lies the city of Burlington, Vermont, home to another PBS member station: Vermont PBS. To the west lies Watertown, home to PBS member WPBS-TV/WNPI-DT. As a result, most of WCFE-TV&#x27;s broadcast area viewers are served by two PBS members. For years, WCFE-TV has searched for a way to stand out.

One of its solutions has been to broadcast certain various signature PBS shows at different dates and times from the national PBS schedule, much as New York City&#x27;s secondary PBS outlet, WLIW has done to differentiate itself from the market&#x27;s primary PBS member, WNET (which also owns WLIW). For example, for a number of years WCFE-TV did not broadcast PBS&#x27; &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; on Sunday evenings; it would also air &quot;Wall Street Week&quot; on Saturday instead of Friday, to name but two examples.

This practice has always been somewhat controversial amongst WCFE-TV&#x27;s members, especially those who do not live in overlapping broadcast areas. As a result, the station has reduced the practice somewhat, and has taken to airing a number of the most popular PBS shows in pattern with the national schedule.

WCFE-TV is the second-smallest PBS member in New York state, ahead of only WPBS/WNPI. However, it reaches a potential audience of 3.9 million people. The great majority of its audience lives in Canada; Montreal alone has 10 times as many people as the Burlington–Plattsburgh market. Additionally, of its 8,500 members (as of August 2007), 4,500 live in Canada. Not only must WCFE-TV take Canadian interests into account in its programming, but its large Canadian viewership has an impact in its fundraising activities. It not only includes French-language elements in its fundraising efforts, but a significant portion of the proceeds from its pledge drives is in Canadian dollars. The station operates a separate fundraising arm for its Canadian viewers, Canadian Friends of Mountain Lake PBS.
WCFE-TV&#x27;s American coverage area consists mostly of rural areas and small towns. The only major urban centers are Montreal and Burlington.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Translators===
* Tupper Lake
* Monkton, VT
* Willsboro

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WCFE-TV began simulcasting digital and analog transmission in early 2005.

WCFE-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 57, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 38, using virtual channel 57.

Until the beginning of 2010, an SD simulcast of WCFE-TV was broadcast on 57.2, while ThinkBright was broadcast on 57.3. From January to September 2010, Classic Arts Showcase was on 57.3.

As a part of the repacking process following the 2016-2017 FCC incentive auction, WCFE-TV relocated to UHF channel 36 on July 2, 2020.

<doc id="423417" wikidata="Q7953108" url="?curid=423417" title="WMTW (TV)">
<text>WMTW (channel 8) is a television station licensed to Poland Spring, Maine, United States, serving the Portland area as an affiliate of ABC. It is owned by Hearst Television alongside CW affiliate WPXT (channel 51). The two stations share studios on Ledgeview Drive in Westbrook; WMTW&#x27;s transmitter is located in West Baldwin, Maine.

WMTW also operates a low-power digital fill-in translator on UHF channel 26 (also mapped to virtual channel 8) from the Time and Temperature Building in downtown Portland&#x27;s Monument Square. The translator serves the immediate part of Portland and some surrounding areas to serve viewers that have difficulty receiving the main signal.

In addition to WPXT, WMTW shares common coverage areas with four other Hearst-owned sister stations in New England: fellow ABC affiliates WCVB-TV in Boston and WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire; and its duopoly of NBC affiliate WPTZ and CW affiliate WNNE in Vermont.

==History==
WMTW signed on September 25, 1954, as the third television station in the Portland market and under the ownership of Mount Washington Television, a group that included former Maine Governor Horace Hildreth. It has always been an ABC affiliate although it aired some DuMont programming in its first year. The station&#x27;s sign-on made Portland one of the smallest markets in the United States with three network affiliates on the analog VHF band. WMTW is also the longest-tenured primary ABC affiliate in New England. The WMTW call sign was modified to include a &quot;-TV&quot; suffix on September 1, 1958.

The station originally broadcast from a transmitter on Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the highest peak in the northeastern United States. This gave WMTW one of the largest coverage areas of any station east of the Mississippi River. In addition to its main coverage area of Southern Maine and Northern New Hampshire, it could also be seen in parts of New York State, Massachusetts, and Vermont. The station also had significant viewership across the Canada–U.S. border in Montreal, a city with almost five times the population of WMTW&#x27;s American coverage area. As a result, viewers in Vermont, northeastern New York State, and southern Quebec were able to watch the full ABC schedule on WMTW. The Burlington, Vermont–Plattsburgh, New York, market got its own ABC affiliate when WVNY (channel 22) signed on from Burlington in 1968. However, for some time afterward, WMTW-TV continued to have a large audience in that area (despite being difficult to receive over-the-air due to co-channel interference from Ottawa station CJOH-TV&#x27;s repeater in Cornwall, Ontario). WMTW stayed on most Montreal cable systems until the early 1990s. Studios for the station were originally based in the Riccar Inn in Poland, now known as the Presidential Inn.

The station&#x27;s transmitter tower on Mount Washington had been originally designed in 1940 by Major Edwin Armstrong for W1XER, one of the first FM radio stations in the country. WMTW-TV built a new tower there in the 1960s but Armstrong&#x27;s tower remained as a standby.

Mount Washington Television sold the station to Dolphin Enterprises, Inc., a company whose chief officer was former &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host Jack Paar, in 1963. Initially barred from appearing on WMTW-TV due to contractual obligations with NBC, he later hosted several programs on the station including a Thursday night movie feature. In 1967, Paar sold WMTW to Mid New York Broadcasting which changed its name to Harron Communications a decade later.

WMTW-TV had to leave Mount Washington in 2002 due to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s digital television mandate. The station had been allocated channel 45 for digital broadcasts, and Harron realized that it would not be possible to provide an acceptable signal to southern Maine if it built its digital transmitter on Mount Washington. As a result, channel 8 built a new tower in West Baldwin, a few miles from the towers of rival stations WGME-TV and WCSH, and signed off from Mount Washington for the last time on February 5, 2002. The new transmitter site does not serve as large an area as the Mount Washington tower had, but it provides a better signal to the highly populated areas.

Harron announced in December 2003 that it was exiting broadcasting and the station was sold to Hearst-Argyle Television a few months later. On October 9, 2007, WMTW dropped the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix.

Until 2009, WCVB-TV in Boston served as the flagship station of the New England Patriots Preseason Television Network, which allowed WMTW and WMUR-TV to be part of the network. Even though WBZ-TV became the flagship station for the telecasts that year, WMTW and WMUR continue to simulcast games which results in ABC programming being preempted.

WMTW added The Local AccuWeather Channel on August 30, 2007, after launching digital subchannel 8.2. Branded as &quot;News 8 Now&quot;, programming consisted of a loop of local weather forecast segments as well as regional and national coverage from AccuWeather. There was a live feed of the National Weather Service&#x27;s Doppler weather radar (based at the Local Forecast Office in Gray) as well as local news and sports headlines. In addition, several public service announcements and station promotions were seen. , this service was replaced by Heroes &amp; Icons, a classic TV network. In October 2018, following Hearst&#x27;s purchase of WPXT, Heroes &amp; Icons was moved to that station&#x27;s second subchannel, with its previous MeTV programming, in turn, moving to the 8.2 subchannel; WMTW also added a third subchannel to add Laff, which moved from another WPXT subchannel.

In July 2012, during a retransmission consent dispute between Hearst Television and Time Warner Cable, Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries was substituted for WMTW, WMUR-TV and WCVB.

===Sister radio stations===
Several radio stations have been co-owned with WMTW. The first, WMTW-FM (94.9), was co-owned with the television station from the radio station&#x27;s launch in 1958 until 1971. That station, which became WHOM in 1976 and is now owned by Townsquare Media, continues to transmit from Mount Washington. The other two, WMTW (870 AM) in Gorham and WMTW-FM (106.7) in North Windham, held those call signs from 2001 to 2004 (Harron had acquired the stations in 1999), serving first as news-talk stations and later as all-news stations; WMTW and WMTW-FM were also simulcast on WLAM (1470 AM) in Lewiston. The three stations, branded as &quot;Newsradio WMTW&quot;, aired and produced local news and talk programs as well as simulcasts of WMTW-TV&#x27;s newscasts and the now-defunct news radio service of the Associated Press.

The &quot;Newsradio WMTW&quot; stations were sold by Harron Communications to Nassau Broadcasting Partners in 2003. Soon after taking over, Nassau discontinued the format. The 870 frequency is now WLVP and simulcasts an oldies format with WLAM while 106.7 FM is now WXTP, a non-commercial Catholic radio station. An earlier FM station with the WMTW call sign (the descendant of W1XER) was not connected to WMTW-TV (having predated the station by several years) apart from also transmitting from Mount Washington.

==News operation==
For most of its history, WMTW&#x27;s newscasts ranked third in the ratings behind longtime dominant WCSH and runner-up WGME-TV. However, in more recent years, the station has waged a spirited battle with WGME for second place and has beaten WGME in several key sweeps periods.

In an attempt to take on WCSH and WGME in order to become more competitive, WMTW adapted its news department to appeal to change in viewer habits. It added a weekend morning show on January 2, 2010, offering an alternative to WCSH. Prior to this addition, the station only aired local weather cut-ins during the weekend edition of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. WMTW starts its weekend morning news at 5 a.m., while WCSH begins its weekend morning news at 5 a.m. on Saturdays and 6 a.m. on Sundays; WGME has no local morning newscast on weekends except for during severe winter weather.

On September 18, 2012, WMTW upgraded local news production to 16:9 enhanced definition widescreen. On September 9, 2013, WMTW launched a 60-minute newscast weeknights at 5. To coincide with the news expansion, WMTW moved &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; from 5 o&#x27;clock to the 3 p.m. time slot replacing &quot;The Ricki Lake Show&quot; (which had been canceled). It also debuted a new logo (very similar to fellow ABC outlet WTNH channel 8 in New Haven, Connecticut) and introduced an updated corporate graphics package from Hearst Television.

Through an exclusive partnership with Charter Communications, WMTW operates a 24-hour cable news station throughout the market. This service replays local newscasts seen on the main broadcast channel in a continuous loop. It does not simulcast live shows that air on the main station; instead, the cable channel displays a slide directing viewers to the main station. &quot;WMTW All News Channel&quot; was originally on analog cable channel 9, but on May 5, 2009, it became available exclusively on the provider&#x27;s digital tier.

On April 16, 2014, it was announced that WMTW would be moving its news operation from the Time and Temperature Building in Portland to a broadcast-ready facility in Westbrook. The studio space was formerly used by WPXT for its own in-house news operation that folded in the early-2000s. The rest of its operations would relocate from Auburn to Westbrook at a later date. WMTW began originating its newscasts from the renovated facility on October 4, 2014.

WMTW&#x27;s broadcasts began being presented in full high-definition in 2016. Studio cameras and video pieces are all presented in high definition.

On August 8, 2016, WMTW announced that it would add a 4 p.m. weekday newscast which launched on September 6. On September 11, 2017, WMTW started airing a 12 p.m. newscast on weekdays; previously the time slot was occupied by talk shows including &quot;Access Hollywood Live&quot;, &quot;Steve Harvey&quot; and &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot;. Following Hearst&#x27;s acquisition of WPXT on September 21, 2018, WMTW announced that it would begin producing a prime time newscast for that station on September 24.

On January 5, 2020, WMTW&#x27;s weekday noon newscast expanded to one hour; it is the first regularly-scheduled hour-long newscast in the time period in the Portland–Auburn television market.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

WMTW&#x27;s broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009.

===Translator===
* 26 Portland

In 2005, WMTW activated two analog repeaters. This included W26CQ channel 26 in Colebrook, New Hampshire (transmitter was northeast of town in Coleman State Park), and W27CP channel 27 in White River Junction, Vermont (transmitter was in the Mascoma section of Lebanon, New Hampshire), to make up for lost coverage when it signed off from Mount Washington. Under normal conditions, these translators should have been built before WMTW moved off the mountain in order to comply with FCC regulations. However, construction was delayed almost four years because the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) had to agree to the proposed tower locations for the translators.

Colebrook is part of the Portland market but White River Junction is considered to be part of the Burlington–Plattsburgh market. The latter location was within the former coverage area of WNNE. Although that station&#x27;s transmitter was located on Mount Ascutney (well south of White River Junction), it formerly operated a repeater of its own from Lebanon (transmitter was west of town on Crafts Hill). FCC regulations do not usually allow two or more stations from two or more different markets have coverage of the same location (in this case, White River Junction). This rule, however, does not apply to repeaters. Incidentally, White River Junction is within the fringe area of another Hearst sister station, WMUR-TV.

Both WMTW repeaters were sold to New Hampshire Public Television in 2009. W27CP went silent on July 15 after losing the lease on its tower, while W26CQ was shut down by Hearst on September 2 in preparation for the sale. The latter transmitter returned as an NHPTV relay on November 4. W27CP never returned to the air and its broadcasting license was canceled by the FCC on September 14, 2011. More recently, WMTW obtained a construction permit for a translator in Portland on UHF channel 26. On April 26, 2010, the station filed a license to cover for the new translator which was granted by the FCC on June 1. This essentially allowed it to officially sign-on.

<text>The meet-in-the-middle attack (MITM), a known-plaintext attack, is a generic space–time tradeoff cryptographic attack against encryption schemes that rely on performing multiple encryption operations in sequence. The MITM attack is the primary reason why Double DES is not used and why a Triple DES key (168-bit) can be brute-forced by an attacker with 256 space and 2112 operations.

== Description ==
When trying to improve the security of a block cipher, a tempting idea is to encrypt the data several times using multiple keys. One might think this doubles or even &quot;n&quot;-tuples the security of the multiple-encryption scheme, depending on the number of times the data is encrypted, because an exhaustive search on all possible combinations of keys (simple brute force) would take 2&quot;n&quot;·&quot;k&quot; attempts if the data is encrypted with &quot;k&quot;-bit keys &quot;n&quot; times.

The MITM attack is a generic attack which weakens the security benefits of using multiple encryptions by storing intermediate values from the encryptions or decryptions and using those to improve the time required to brute force the decryption keys. This makes a Meet-in-the-Middle attack (MITM) a generic space–time tradeoff cryptographic attack.

The MITM attack attempts to find the keys by using both the range (ciphertext) and domain (plaintext) of the composition of several functions (or block ciphers) such that the forward mapping through the first functions is the same as the backward mapping (inverse image) through the last functions, quite literally &quot;meeting&quot; in the middle of the composed function. For example, although Double DES encrypts the data with two different 56-bit keys, Double DES can be broken with 257 encryption and decryption operations.

The multidimensional MITM (MD-MITM) uses a combination of several simultaneous MITM attacks like described above, where the meeting happens in multiple positions in the composed function.

== History ==
Diffie and Hellman first proposed the meet-in-the-middle attack on a hypothetical expansion of a block cipher in 1977.
Their attack used a space–time tradeoff to break the double-encryption scheme in only twice the time needed to break the single-encryption scheme.

In 2011, Bo Zhu and Guang Gong investigated the &quot;multidimensional meet-in-the-middle attack&quot; and presented new attacks on the block ciphers GOST, KTANTAN and Hummingbird-2.

== Meet-in-the-middle (1D-MITM) ==
Assume someone wants to attack an encryption scheme with the following characteristics for a given plaintext &quot;P&quot; and ciphertext &quot;C&quot;:
:formula_1

where &quot;ENC&quot; is the encryption function, &quot;DEC&quot; the decryption function defined as &quot;ENC&quot;−1 (inverse mapping) and &quot;k&quot;1 and &quot;k&quot;2 are two keys.

The naive approach at brute-forcing this encryption scheme is to decrypt the ciphertext with every possible &quot;k&quot;2, and decrypt each of the intermediate outputs with every possible &quot;k&quot;1, for a total of 2|&quot;k&quot;1| × 2|&quot;k&quot;2| (or 2|&quot;k&quot;1|+|&quot;k&quot;2|) operations.

The meet-in-the-middle attack uses a more efficient approach. By decrypting &quot;C&quot; with &quot;k2&quot;, one obtains the following equivalence:
:formula_2

The attacker can compute &quot;ENC&quot;&quot;k&quot;1(&quot;P&quot;) for all values of &quot;k&quot;1 and &quot;DEC&quot;&quot;k&quot;2(&quot;C&quot;) for all possible values of &quot;k&quot;2, for a total of 2|&quot;k&quot;1| + 2|&quot;k&quot;2| (or 2|&quot;k&quot;1|+1, if &quot;k&quot;1 and &quot;k&quot;2 have the same size) operations. If the result from any of the &quot;ENC&quot;&quot;k&quot;1(&quot;P&quot;) operations matches a result from the &quot;DEC&quot;&quot;k&quot;2(&quot;C&quot;) operations, the pair of &quot;k&quot;1 and &quot;k&quot;2 is possibly the correct key. This potentially-correct key is called a &quot;candidate key&quot;. The attacker can determine which candidate key is correct by testing it with a second test-set of plaintext and ciphertext.

The MITM attack is one of the reasons why Data Encryption Standard (DES) was replaced with Triple DES and not Double DES. An attacker can use a MITM attack to bruteforce Double DES with 257 operations and 256 space, making it only a small improvement over DES. Triple DES uses a &quot;triple length&quot; (168-bit) key and is also vulnerable to a meet-in-the-middle attack in 256 space and 2112 operations, but is considered secure due to the size of its keyspace.

=== MITM algorithm ===
Compute the following:
*formula_3:
*: and save each formula_4 together with corresponding formula_5 in a set A
*formula_6:
*: and compare each new formula_7 with the set A

When a match is found, keep formula_8 as candidate key-pair in a table &quot;T&quot;. Test pairs in &quot;T&quot; on a new pair of to confirm validity. If the key-pair does not work on this new pair, do MITM again on a new pair of .

=== MITM complexity ===
If the keysize is &quot;k&quot;, this attack uses only 2&quot;k&quot;+1 encryptions (and decryptions) and &quot;O&quot;(2&quot;k&quot;) memory to store the results of the forward computations in a lookup table, in contrast to the naive attack, which needs 22·&quot;k&quot; encryptions but &quot;O&quot;(1) space.

== Multidimensional MITM (MD-MITM) ==
While 1D-MITM can be efficient, a more sophisticated attack has been developed: multidimensional meet-in-the-middle attack, also abbreviated MD-MITM. 
This is preferred when the data has been encrypted using more than 2 encryptions with different keys.
Instead of meeting in the middle (one place in the sequence), the MD-MITM attack attempts to reach several specific intermediate states using the forward and backward computations at several positions in the cipher.

Assume that the attack has to be mounted on a block cipher, where the encryption and decryption is defined as before:

: formula_9 
: formula_10
that is a plaintext P is encrypted multiple times using a repetition of the same block cipher

The MD-MITM has been used for cryptanalysis of, among many, the GOST block cipher, where it has been shown that a 3D-MITM has significantly reduced the time complexity for an attack on it.

=== MD-MITM algorithm ===
Compute the following:
:; formula_11
:: and save each formula_12 together with corresponding formula_13 in a set formula_14.

:; formula_15
:: and save each formula_16 together with corresponding formula_17 in a set formula_18.
For each possible guess on the intermediate state formula_19 compute the following:

:; formula_20
:: and for each match between this formula_21 and the set formula_22, save formula_23 and formula_5 in a new set formula_25.

:; formula_26
:: and save each formula_27 together with corresponding formula_28 in a set formula_29.
: For each possible guess on an intermediate state formula_30 compute the following:
:* formula_31
:*: and for each match between this formula_27 and the set formula_33, check also whether 
:*: it matches with formula_25 and then save the combination of sub-keys together in a new set formula_35.
:* For each possible guess on an intermediate state formula_36 compute the following:
 \in K&lt;/math&gt; and for each match between this formula_16 and the set formula_18, check also 
whether it matches with formula_39. If this is the case then:&quot;
Use the found combination of sub-keys formula_40 on another pair of plaintext/ciphertext to verify the correctness of the key.

Note the nested element in the algorithm. The guess on every possible value on &quot;sj&quot; is done for each guess on the previous &quot;s&quot;&quot;j&quot;-1. 
This make up an element of exponential complexity to overall time complexity of this MD-MITM attack.

=== MD-MITM complexity ===
Time complexity of this attack without brute force, is formula_41⋅formula_42⋅formula_43

Regarding the memory complexity, it is easy to see that formula_44 are much smaller than the first built table of candidate values: formula_45 as i increases, the candidate values contained in formula_46 must satisfy more conditions thereby fewer candidates will pass on to the end destination formula_39.

An upper bound of the memory complexity of MD-MITM is then

:formula_48

where denotes the length of the whole key (combined).

The data complexity depends on the probability that a wrong key may pass (obtain a false positive), which is formula_49, where is the intermediate state in the first MITM phase. The size of the intermediate state and the block size is often the same!
Considering also how many keys that are left for testing after the first MITM-phase, it is formula_50.

Therefore, after the first MITM phase, there are formula_51
where |⋅| denotes the length.

Main memory consumption is restricted by the construction of the sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; where &quot;T&quot; is much smaller than the others.

For data complexity see subsection on complexity for MD-MITM.

<doc id="423419" wikidata="Q118470" url="?curid=423419" title="Keyboard shortcut">
<text>In computing, a keyboard shortcut (also hotkey/hot key or key binding) is a software-based assignment of an action to one or more keys on a computer keyboard. Most operating systems and applications come with a default set of keyboard shortcuts, some of which may be modified by the user in the settings. 

Keyboard configuration software allows users to create and assign macros to key combinations which can perform more complex sequences of actions. Some older keyboards had a physical macro key specifically for this purpose.

== Terminology ==
The precise words used for these assignments and their meaning can vary depending on the context.

For example, Microsoft has generally used &quot;keyboard shortcuts&quot; for Windows and Microsoft Office since the transition to 64-bit for Windows 7. However, they used &quot;hot keys&quot; prior to that and continue to do so in their 32-bit API for developing &#x27;classic desktop apps&#x27;. Meanwhile, Lenovo and ASUS each have keyboard configuration software made for Windows that are named &quot;Lenovo &quot;Hotkeys&quot;&quot; and &quot;ASUS Keyboard &quot;Hotkeys&quot;&quot; respectively.

The assignment process is referred to as &quot;mapping&quot; the actions to the keys, and changing them afterwards is therefore &quot;remapping&quot;. The assigned action is then said to be &quot;bound&quot; to the key, leading to the phrase &quot;key binding&quot; being used interchangeably with shortcut and hotkey. 

As other input devices became increasingly configurable in the early 2000&#x27;s, the term &quot;shortcut&quot; began to be used to refer to what are essentially keyboard shortcuts being mapped to objects that are not keyboard keys. The most prevalent of these are computer mice, which went from only having two buttons for left and right clicks to having additional buttons on the around the side, top, and back of the mice (2-4 for common usage and up to 12 extra programmable buttons for certain types of gaming uses). 

As Internet of things (IoT) devices continue to proliferate, &quot;shortcuts&quot; are appearing in many other device types such as electronic keyboards, home automation devices, wearable technology, and more. 

Human-computer interaction experts also continue to design new types of shortcuts altogether, such as gestures on touchscreens and touchless interfaces.

== Description ==
Keyboard shortcuts are typically a means for invoking one or more commands using the keyboard that would otherwise be accessible only through a menu, a pointing device, different levels of a user interface, or via a command-line interface. Keyboard shortcuts are generally used to expedite common operations by reducing input sequences to a few keystrokes, hence the term &quot;shortcut&quot;.

To differentiate from general keyboard input, most keyboard shortcuts require the user to press and hold several keys simultaneously or a sequence of keys one after the other. Unmodified key presses are sometimes accepted when the keyboard is not used for general input - such as with graphics packages e.g. Adobe Photoshop or IBM Lotus Freelance Graphics. Other keyboard shortcuts use function keys that are dedicated for use in shortcuts and may only require a single keypress. For simultaneous keyboard shortcuts, one usually first holds down the modifier key(s), then quickly presses and releases the regular (non-modifier) key, and finally releases the modifier key(s). This distinction is important, as trying to press all the keys simultaneously will frequently either miss some of the modifier keys, or cause unwanted auto-repeat. Sequential shortcuts usually involve pressing and releasing a dedicated prefix key, such as the Esc key, followed by one or more keystrokes.

Mnemonics are distinguishable from keyboard shortcuts. One difference between them is that the keyboard shortcuts are not localized on multi-language software but the mnemonics are generally localized to reflect the symbols and letters used in the specific locale. In most GUIs, a program&#x27;s keyboard shortcuts are discoverable by browsing the program&#x27;s menus – the shortcut is indicated next to the menu choice. There are keyboards that have the shortcuts for a particular application already marked on them. These keyboards are often used for editing video, audio, or graphics, as well as in software training courses. There are also stickers with shortcuts printed on them that can be applied to a regular keyboard. Reference cards intended to be propped up in the user&#x27;s workspace also exist for many applications. In the past, when keyboard design was more standardized, it was common for computer books and magazines to print cards that were cut out, intended to be placed over the user&#x27;s keyboard with the printed shortcuts noted next to the appropriate keys.

== Customization ==

When shortcuts are referred to as &quot;key bindings,&quot; it carries the connotation that the shortcuts are customizable to a user&#x27;s preference and that program functions may be &#x27;bound&#x27; to a different set of keystrokes instead of or in addition to the default. This highlights a difference in philosophy regarding shortcuts. Some systems, typically end-user-oriented systems such as Mac OS or Windows, consider standardized shortcuts essential to the environment&#x27;s ease of use. In these commercial proprietary systems, the ability to change the default bindings and add custom ones can be limited, possibly even requiring a separate or third-party utility to perform the task, sometimes with workarounds like key remapping. In macOS, user can customize app shortcuts (&quot;Key equivalents&quot;) in system settings, and customize text editing shortcuts by creating and editing related configuration files. Other systems, typically Unix and related, consider shortcuts to be a user&#x27;s prerogative, and that they should be customizable to suit individual preference. In most real-world environments, both philosophies co-exist; a core set of &quot;sacred&quot; shortcuts remain fixed while others, typically involving an otherwise unused modifier key or keys, are under the user&#x27;s control.

The motivations for customizing key bindings vary. Users new to a program or software environment may customize the new environment&#x27;s shortcuts to be similar to another environment with which they are more familiar. More advanced users may customize key bindings to better suit their workflow, adding shortcuts for their commonly used actions and possibly deleting or replacing bindings for less-used functions. Hardcore gamers often customize their key bindings in order to increase performance via faster reaction times.

=== Reserved Keyboard Shortcuts ===
The original Macintosh User Interface Guidelines defined a set of keyboard shortcuts that would remain consistent across application programs. This provides a better user experience than the then-prevalent situation of applications using the same keys for different functions. This could result in user errors if one program used to mean &quot;Delete&quot; while another used it to &quot;Duplicate&quot; an item. The standard bindings were:
* : Quit
* : Close Window
* : Bold text
* : Italicize text
* : Underline text
* : Open
* : Print
* : Select All
* : Save
* : Find
* : Find Again (the G key is next to the F key on a QWERTY keyboard)
* : Enter search string from selection (allowed searching a document by selecting text and typing (exempli gratia)
* : Undo (represents the do-undo-redo cycle)
* : Cut (resembles scissors or a general sign for removal – and the X key is next to the C key on a QWERTY keyboard)
* : Copy
* : Paste (resembles the proofreader&#x27;s mark for &quot;insert&quot; – and the V key is next to the C key on a QWERTY keyboard)
* : New Document
* (full stop): User interrupt, it can be used to close dialogs, search bars, and context menus.
* : Help (? signifies a question or confusion)

Later environments such as Microsoft Windows retain some of these bindings, while adding their own from alternate standards like Common User Access. The shortcuts on these platforms (or on macOS) are not as strictly standardized across applications as on the early Macintosh user interface, where if a program did not include the function normally carried out by one of the standard keystrokes, guidelines stated that it should not redefine the key to do something else as it would potentially confuse users.

== Notation ==

The simplest keyboard shortcuts consist of only one key. For these, one generally just writes out the name of the key, as in the message &quot;Press F1 for Help&quot;. The name of the key is sometimes surrounded in brackets or similar characters. For example: [F1] or &lt;F1&gt;. The key name may also be set off using special formatting (bold, italic, all caps, etc.)

Many shortcuts require two or more keys to be pressed simultaneously. For these, the usual notation is to list the keys names separated by plus signs or hyphens. For example: &quot;Ctrl+C&quot;, &quot;Ctrl-C&quot;, or &quot;. The Ctrl key is sometimes indicated by a caret character (^). Thus Ctrl-C is sometimes written as ^C. At times, usually on Unix platforms, the case of the second character is significant – if the character would normally require pressing the Shift key to type, then the Shift key is part of the shortcut e.g. &#x27;^C&#x27; vs. &#x27;^c&#x27; or &#x27;^%&#x27; vs. &#x27;^5&#x27;. ^% may also be written &quot;.

Some keyboard shortcuts, including all shortcuts involving the key, require keys (or sets of keys) to be pressed individually, in sequence. These shortcuts are sometimes written with the individual keys (or sets) separated by commas or semicolons. The Emacs text editor uses many such shortcuts, using a designated set of &quot;prefix keys&quot; such as or . Default Emacs keybindings include to save a file or to view a list of open buffers. Emacs uses the letter C to denote the Ctrl key, the letter S to denote the Shift key, and the letter M to denote the Meta key (commonly mapped to the Alt key on modern keyboards.) Thus, in Emacs parlance, the above shortcuts would be written C-x C-s and C-x C-b. A common backronym for Emacs is &quot;Escape Meta Alt Ctrl Shift&quot;, poking fun at its use of many modifiers and extended shortcut sequences.

<text>The Workers and Peasants&#x27; Socialist Party (&quot;Parti socialiste ouvrier et paysan&quot;, &quot;PSOP&quot;) was a socialist organisation in France, formed on June 8, 1938, by Marceau Pivert. Its youth wing was the &quot;Workers and Peasants&#x27; Socialist Youth&quot; (&quot;Jeunesses Socialistes Ouvrières et Paysannes&quot; – JSOP).

It developed out of a left-wing faction that was expelled from the &quot;Section Française de l&#x27;Internationale Ouvrière&quot; (SFIO), and named itself &quot;Gauche Révolutionnaire&quot; (&quot;Revolutionary Left&quot;). Alongside moderate Marxists, the party grouped Trotskyists (as an outcome of the French Turn) and Luxemburgists (such as René Lefeuvre). Another well-known leader beside Pivert was Daniel Guérin, a figure of Libertarian Socialism.

Internationally, PSOP was an affiliate of the London Bureau of left-wing socialist parties, which also included the British Independent Labour Party and the Spanish Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM).

Appealing to a minority dissatisfied with both the SFIO and the French Communist Party (PCF), PSOP was a revolutionary socialist party, and had between 8,000 and 10,000 members. It edited the paper &quot;Juin 36&quot;, named in memory of the 1936 general strike that caused the split between Pivert and the Popular Front government.

In 1939 a small Trotskyist faction split away from the PSOP, establishing the Trotskyist Group, now known as Workers&#x27; Struggle (&quot;Lutte Ouvrière&quot;).

The PSOP collapsed at the beginning of World War II, when it was outlawed by the Vichy regime. Most of its former members joined the French Resistance, in groups affiliated with either the SFIO or the PCF or in &quot;L&#x27;Insurgé&quot;, an independent group around Lyon.

<text>Query flooding is a method to search for a resource on a peer-to-peer network. It is simple and scales very poorly and thus is rarely used. Early versions of the Gnutella protocol operated by query flooding; newer versions use more efficient search algorithms.

==Operation==

A peer-to-peer network generally consists of a large number of nodes each connected to a small subset of the nodes and not all nodes in the network. If a node wants to find a resource on the network, which may be on a node it does not know about, it could simply broadcast its search query to its immediate neighbours. If the neighbours do not have the resource, it then asks its neighbours to forward the query to their neighbours in turn. This is repeated until the resource is found or all the nodes have been contacted, or perhaps a network-imposed hop limit is reached.

Query flooding is simple to implement and is practical for small networks with few requests. It contacts all reachable nodes in the network and so can precisely determine whether a resource can be found in the network (Hyphanet, for example, only returns a probabilistic result).

On the other hand, every request may cause every node to be contacted. Each node might generate a small number of queries; however, each such query floods the network. Thus, a larger network would generate far more traffic per node than a smaller one, making it inherently unscalable. Additionally, because a node can flood the network simply by issuing a request for a nonexistent resource, it could be possible to launch a denial-of-service attack on the network.

== Alternatives ==
Version 0.6 of the Gnutella protocol mandates &quot;query routing&quot;.
The query routing specification explains how the ideas of the original research are implemented. Other file-sharing networks, such as the Kad network, use distributed hash tables to index files and for keyword searches. BitTorrent creates individual overlay networks for sharing individual files (or archives). Searches are &quot;performed&quot; by other mechanisms, such as locating torrent files indexed on a website. A similar mechanism can be used on the Gnutella network with magnet links. For instance Bitzi provides a web interface to search for magnet links.

Earlier P2P networks, such as Napster, used a centralized database to locate files. This does not have a scaling problem, but the central server is a single point of failure.

<text>Robert Reed Carradine ( ; born March 24, 1954) is an American actor. A member of the Carradine family, he made his first appearances on television Western series such as &quot;Bonanza&quot; and his brother David&#x27;s TV series, &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. Carradine&#x27;s first film role was in the 1972 film &quot;The Cowboys&quot;, which starred John Wayne and Roscoe Lee Browne. Carradine also portrayed fraternity president Lewis Skolnick in the &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; series of comedy films.

==Early life==
Carradine is the son of actress and artist Sonia Sorel (née Henius) and actor John Carradine. He is one of many actors in the Carradine family. He is the brother of Christopher and Keith Carradine, paternal half-brother of Bruce and the late David Carradine, and maternal half-brother of Michael Bowen. His maternal great-grandfather was biochemist Max Henius, and his maternal great-grandmother was the sister of historian Johan Ludvig Heiberg.

Carradine&#x27;s parents divorced when he was 2 years old. A bitter custody battle led to his father gaining custody of him and his brothers, Christopher and Keith. During the custody battle, the children spent three months in a home for abused children as wards of the court. His brother Keith said of the experience, &quot;It was like being in jail. There were bars on the windows, and we were only allowed to see our parents through glass doors. It was very sad. We would stand there on either side of the glass door crying&quot;.

Carradine was raised primarily by his stepmother, his father&#x27;s third wife, Doris Grimshaw, and believed her to be his mother until he was introduced to Sonia Sorel at a Christmas party when he was 14 years old. While still in high school, Robert lived with his half-brother, David, in Laurel Canyon, California. Under David&#x27;s care he indulged in two of his major interests: race car driving and music. He and David belonged to a musical quartet that performed in small clubs in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

==Career==
===Film===
Carradine made his film debut in 1972 in &quot;The Cowboys&quot; with John Wayne. He was also featured in a short-lived television series, of the same name, based on the movie. He made an appearance as a killer in the Martin Scorsese film &quot;Mean Streets&quot; shooting to death the character played by his brother, David.

During this time he worked with David on some independent projects including a biker film called &quot;You and Me&quot; (1975) and an unreleased musical called &quot;A Country Mile&quot;. He also did camera work for David&#x27;s cult classic Vietnam War-inspired &quot;Americana&quot; which was not released until 1983.

In 1976, Carradine had the opportunity to demonstrate on screen what he considered to be his &quot;first ambition&quot;, car racing, when he played Jim Cantrell in Paul Bartel&#x27;s &quot;Cannonball&quot;. In the film Robert&#x27;s character wins the cross country road race, beating the favorite, Coy &quot;Cannonball&quot; Buckman, played by his brother, David. In 1977, Robert became a snack for the vengeful killer whale in the &quot;Jaws&quot; imitation film &quot;Orca&quot;.

Robert also played with other Hollywood offspring in the 1977 film &quot;Joyride&quot;, where he starred with Desi Arnaz, Jr., Melanie Griffith and Anne Lockhart (daughter of June Lockhart) in a film about young Californians driving up to Washington and Alaska to seek their fortunes.

In 1978, Robert landed a demanding role in Hal Ashby&#x27;s Oscar-winning Vietnam War drama, &quot;Coming Home&quot;, which starred Jane Fonda and Jon Voight. His performance caused some speculation that he might be the best actor in his family.

Robert was instrumental in securing his brothers David and Keith to perform with him in one of the most unusual casting arrangements in movie history. Together the Carradines played the Younger brothers in &quot;The Long Riders&quot; (1980) along with three other sets of acting brothers: Stacy and James Keach, Dennis and Randy Quaid, and Christopher and Nicholas Guest.

Also in 1980, Carradine co-starred with Mark Hamill and Lee Marvin in Samuel Fuller&#x27;s &quot;The Big Red One&quot; recounting Fuller&#x27;s World War II experience. His character, who was based on Fuller himself, narrated the film.

In 1983, he and Cherie Currie starred in the science fiction movie &quot;Wavelength&quot; in which he played a washed up rock star who helps extraterrestrials escape from a military base. For the film he performed his own compositions including one named after his daughter, Ever. Also in 1983, he starred in the music video for The Motels hit song &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot; as lead singer Martha Davis&#x27; love interest.

Carradine&#x27;s biggest film success to date came in 1984 when he starred in &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; as the lead nerd Lewis Skolnick. To prepare for the comedy, Carradine spent time at The University of Arizona, where the movie was filmed, participating in rush week. &quot;No fraternity picked him, convincing Carradine that he was indeed right for the part of the nerd that nobody wanted to claim as their own.&quot; Carradine reprised the role of Skolnick in three sequels, taking over as executive producer in the latter two. In 2018, Carradine joined Andrew Cassese and Don Gibb in an interview at the Niagara Falls Comic Con. In 2001, he played Donald Keeble in &quot;Max Keeble&#x27;s Big Move&quot;. In 2000 he co-starred with Caroline Rhea in &quot;Mom&#x27;s Got a Date with a Vampire&quot;. He reprised his role as Sam McGuire in &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot; in 2003.

===Television===
Carradine&#x27;s first television appearance was in 1971, on the classic Western series &quot;Bonanza&quot;. He also appeared on his brother David&#x27;s series &quot;Kung Fu&quot; as Sunny Jim, the mute companion of Serenity Johnson, played by his father John Carradine, in an episode titled &quot;Dark Angel&quot; (1972). In 1979, he was alongside Melissa Sue Anderson in &quot;Survival of Dana&quot;. In 1984, Carradine played Robert Cohn in the television mini-series version of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. He appeared in the 1987 HBO mini-series &quot;Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8&quot;. He was also a guest star in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; titled &quot;Gone&quot; (2005, Season 4, Episode 11), portraying a character based very loosely on Bobby Fischer. He also appeared in &quot;Jane Doe&quot;, a TV series directed by James A. Contner, in 2007.

He played father Sam McGuire on &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; from 2001 to 2004. The show starred Hilary Duff as Lizzie and was widely popular among girls. The show&#x27;s realistic approach to the problems of a 13-year-old girl also appealed to parents.

He appeared in the &quot;ER&quot; episode &quot;Sleepless in Chicago&quot; alongside &quot;Nerds&quot; co-star Anthony Edwards.

In January 2013, he and former &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; co-star Curtis Armstrong hosted &quot;King of the Nerds&quot; on TBS, a reality TV series in which a group of nerds compete to find out which one is the nerdiest.

In 2015, he appeared on a fourth season episode of &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot; with Hall of Fame wide receiver Terrell Owens.

==Personal life==
Carradine has two daughters, actress Ever Carradine (with Susan Snyder), Marika Reed Carradine with his ex-wife Edie Mani, and a son, Ian Alexander Carradine. He is also the uncle (via his older brother Keith) of actress Martha Plimpton.

Carradine participated in the Rolex 24 race at Daytona in 2000, finishing 29th in the GTU class and 61st overall.

<text>Mirach, Bayer designation Beta Andromedae, Latinized from β Andromedae, is a prominent star in the northern constellation of Andromeda. It is northeast of the Great Square of Pegasus and is potentially visible to all observers north of latitude 54° S. It is commonly used by stargazers to find the Andromeda Galaxy. The galaxy NGC 404, also known as Mirach&#x27;s Ghost, is seven arcminutes away from Mirach.

This star has an apparent visual magnitude of around 2.07, varying between 2.01 and 2.10, which at times makes it the brightest star in the constellation. Based upon parallax measurements, it is roughly from the Sun. Its apparent magnitude is reduced by 0.06 by extinction due to gas and dust along the line of sight. The star has a negligible radial velocity of 0.1 km/s, but with a relatively large proper motion, traversing the celestial sphere at ·yr−1.

==Properties==

Mirach is a single red giant with a stellar classification of M0 III, and is currently on the asymptotic giant branch of its evolution. Since 1943 the spectrum of this star has been one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. It is suspected of being a semiregular variable star whose apparent visual magnitude varies from +2.01 to +2.10. At this stage of the star&#x27;s evolution, the outer envelope has expanded to around 86 times the size of the Sun. It is radiating 1,675 times the luminosity of the Sun at an effective temperature of .
==Nomenclature==
&quot;Beta Andromedae&quot; is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation. It had the traditional name of &quot;Mirach&quot;, and its variations, such as &quot;Mirac&quot;, &quot;Mirar&quot;, &quot;Mirath&quot;, &quot;Mirak&quot;, etc. (the name is spelled &quot;Merach&quot; in Burritt&#x27;s &quot;The Geography of the Heavens&quot;), which come from the star&#x27;s description in the &quot;Alfonsine Tables&quot; of 1521 as &quot;super mizar&quot;. Here, &quot;mirat&quot; is a corruption of the Arabic مئزر &quot;mīzar&quot; &quot;girdle&quot;, which appeared in a Latin translation of the &quot;Almagest&quot;. This word refers to Mirach&#x27;s position at the left hip of the princess Andromeda. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Mirach&quot; for this star.

Mirach is listed in the Babylonian MUL.APIN as KA.MUSH.I.KU.E, meaning &quot;the Deleter&quot; (the alternative star is α Cas). Medieval astronomers writing in Arabic called Mirach &quot;Janb al-Musalsalah&quot; (); it was part of the 28th &quot;manzil&quot; (Arabian lunar mansion) &quot;Baṭn al-Ḥūt&quot;, the Belly of the Fish, or &quot;Qalb al-Ḥūt&quot;, the Heart of the Fish. The star has also been called &quot;Cingulum&quot; and &quot;Ventrale&quot;. This &quot;al-Ḥūt&quot; was an indigenous Arabic constellation, not the Western &quot;Northern Fish&quot; part of the constellation Pisces. These names are not from the Arabic &quot;marāqq&quot;, loins, because it was never called &quot;al-Marāqq&quot; in Arabian astronomy. &quot;Al Rishā, the Cord (of the well-bucket), on al-Sūfī&#x27;s star map. It is origin of the proper name Alrescha&quot;&#x27; for Alpha Piscium.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Legs&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Mirach (β Andromedae), η Andromedae, 65 Piscium, ζ Andromedae, ε Andromedae, δ Andromedae, π Andromedae, ν Andromedae, μ Andromedae, σ Piscium, τ Piscium, 91 Piscium, υ Piscium, φ Piscium, χ Piscium and ψ1 Piscium. Consequently, the Chinese name for β Andromedae itself is (, ). Mirach was considered the standard &quot;black&quot; star; &quot;black&quot; could mean &quot;dark red&quot; in this context, especially in comparison to Antares, the standard red star.

The people of Micronesia named this star &quot;Kyyw&quot;, meaning &quot;The Porpoise&quot;, and this was used as one of the names of the months in Micronesia.

==Substellar companion==
A 2023 study detected radial velocity variations in Mirach (HD 6860), showing evidence of a substellar companion, likely a brown dwarf.

<text>Regal Zonophone Records was a British record label formed in 1932, through a merger of the Regal and Zonophone labels. This followed the merger of those labels&#x27; respective parent companies – the Columbia Graphophone Company and the Gramophone Company – to form EMI. At the merger, those records from the Regal Records catalogue were prefixed &#x27;MR&#x27; and those from the Zonophone Records catalogue were prefixed &#x27;T&#x27;. Record releases after the merger continued using only the &#x27;MR&#x27; prefix.

Originally Regal Zonophone handled American releases from Okeh Records, Victor Records and Columbia Records, as well as offering home-grown recordings by artists such as Gracie Fields and George Formby. The label is also known for its releases of Salvation Army (particularly brass band) music.

In the 1950s the Australian division of Regal Zonophone played an important role in the emerging Australian country music genre, signing several emerging country stars including Slim Dusty, Smoky Dawson, Reg Lindsay and Chad Morgan. Slim Dusty&#x27;s 1957 Regal Zonophone hit &quot;A Pub with No Beer&quot; became the biggest-selling Australian recording ever released up to that time.

EMI revived the Regal Zonophone imprint in 1967 to handle the Essex Music/Straight Ahead producing account that had moved from Deram (after one Procol Harum single and two singles by The Move) and continued well into the early 1970s, with successful producers Denny Cordell and Tony Visconti both having production companies releasing records through the label. During this period the label had both album and single success with artists such as The Move, Procol Harum, Joe Cocker, and Tyrannosaurus Rex. During the mid-1970s, many of these production deals ended and, despite a few sporadic releases by Blue Mink, Geordie, Dave Edmunds, and Grunt Futtock (a one-off project featuring Roy Wood, Steve Marriott, Peter Frampton and Andy Bown), EMI stopped using the imprint as a major pop label. Many of the label&#x27;s artists moved to Fly Records or to the EMI imprint.

Regal Zonophone was revived by EMI in 1985-86 for Frank Sidebottom, and again at the end of the 1990s as a reissue label curated by the UK band Saint Etienne. This incarnation of the label is no longer active, as EMI relaunched Regal and Zonophone as separate imprints of Parlophone. In 2013, both Regal and Zonophone were taken over by Warner Music Group after Universal Music Group spun off Parlophone from EMI, at the request of international regulators.

However, the Australian and New Zealand Regal Zonophone catalogues, including recordings by Slim Dusty, were ceded to Universal Music Australia&#x27;s imprint EMI Recorded Music and Universal Music New Zealand respectively.

<doc id="423439" wikidata="Q14633936" url="?curid=423439" title="Sarcoplasmic reticulum">
<text>The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a membrane-bound structure found within muscle cells that is similar to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum in other cells. The main function of the SR is to store calcium ions (Ca2+). Calcium ion levels are kept relatively constant, with the concentration of calcium ions within a cell being 10,000 times smaller than the concentration of calcium ions outside the cell. This means that small increases in calcium ions within the cell are easily detected and can bring about important cellular changes (the calcium is said to be a second messenger). Calcium is used to make calcium carbonate (found in chalk) and calcium phosphate, two compounds that the body uses to make teeth and bones. This means that too much calcium within the cells can lead to hardening (calcification) of certain intracellular structures, including the mitochondria, leading to cell death. Therefore, it is vital that calcium ion levels are controlled tightly, and can be released into the cell when necessary and then removed from the cell.

==Structure==

The sarcoplasmic reticulum is a network of the tubules that extend throughout muscle cells, wrapping around (but not in direct contact with) the myofibrils (contractile units of the cell). Cardiac and skeletal muscle cells contain structures called transverse tubules (T-tubules), which are extensions of the cell membrane that travel into the centre of the cell. T-tubules are closely associated with a specific region of the SR, known as the terminal cisternae in skeletal muscle, with a distance of roughly 12 nanometers, separating them. This is the primary site of calcium release. The longitudinal SR are thinner projects, that run between the terminal cisternae/junctional SR, and are the location where ion channels necessary for calcium ion absorption are most abundant. These processes are explained in more detail below and are fundamental for the process of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle.

==Calcium absorption==

The SR contains ion channel pumps, within its membrane that are responsible for pumping Ca2+ into the SR. As the calcium ion concentration within the SR is higher than in the rest of the cell, the calcium ions will not freely flow into the SR, and therefore pumps are required, that use energy, which they gain from a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). These calcium pumps are called Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases (SERCA). There are a variety of different forms of SERCA, with SERCA 2a being found primarily in cardiac and skeletal muscle.

SERCA consists of 13 structural elements (labelled M1-M10 α-helices in the transmembrane domain, and N, P and A citosolic domains). Calcium ions bind to the M1-M10 transmembrane region, whereas ATP binds to the N domain. When 2 calcium ions, along with a molecule of ATP, bind to the cytosolic side of the pump (i.e. the region of the pump outside the SR), the pump opens. This occurs because ATP (which contains three phosphate groups) releases a single phosphate group (becoming adenosine diphosphate). The released phosphate group then binds to the pump (in the P domain), causing the pump to change shape. This shape change causes the cytosolic side of the pump to open, allowing the two Ca2+ to enter. The cytosolic side of the pump then closes and the sarcoplasmic reticulum side opens, releasing the Ca2+ into the SR.

A protein found in cardiac muscle, called phospholamban (PLB) has been shown to prevent SERCA from working. It does this by binding to the SERCA and decreasing its attraction (affinity) to calcium, therefore preventing calcium uptake into the SR. Failure to remove Ca2+ from the cytosol, prevents muscle relaxation and therefore means that there is a decrease in muscle contraction too. However, molecules such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, can prevent PLB from inhibiting SERCA. When these hormones bind to a receptor, called a beta 1 adrenoceptor, located on the cell membrane, they produce a series of reactions (known as a cyclic AMP pathway) that produces an enzyme called protein kinase A (PKA). PKA can add a phosphate to PLB (this is known as phosphorylation), preventing it from inhibiting SERCA and allowing for muscle relaxation.

==Calcium storage==

Located within the SR is a protein called calsequestrin. This protein can bind to around 50 Ca2+, which decreases the amount of free Ca2+ within the SR (as more is bound to calsequestrin). Therefore, more calcium can be stored (the calsequestrin is said to be a buffer). It is primarily located within the junctional SR/luminal space, in close association with the calcium release channel (described below).

==Calcium release==

Calcium ion release from the SR, occurs in the junctional SR/terminal cisternae through a ryanodine receptor (RyR) and is known as a calcium spark. There are three types of ryanodine receptor, RyR1 (in skeletal muscle), RyR2 (in cardiac muscle) and RyR3 (in the brain). Calcium release through ryanodine receptors in the SR is triggered differently in different muscles. In cardiac and smooth muscle an electrical impulse (action potential) triggers calcium ions to enter the cell through an L-type calcium channel located in the cell membrane (smooth muscle) or T-tubule membrane (cardiac muscle). These calcium ions bind to and activate the RyR, producing a larger increase in intracellular calcium. In skeletal muscle, however, the L-type calcium channel is bound to the RyR. Therefore, activation of the L-type calcium channel, via an action potential, activates the RyR directly, causing calcium release (see calcium sparks for more details). Also, caffeine (found in coffee) can bind to and stimulate RyR. Caffeine makes the RyR more sensitive to either the action potential (skeletal muscle) or calcium (cardiac or smooth muscle), thereby producing calcium sparks more often (this is partially responsible for caffeine&#x27;s effect on heart rate).

Triadin and Junctin are proteins found within the SR membrane, that are bound to the RyR. The main role of these proteins is to anchor calsequestrin (see above) to the ryanodine receptor. At ‘normal’ (physiological) SR calcium levels, calsequestrin binds to the RyR, Triadin and Junctin, which prevents the RyR from opening. If calcium concentration within the SR falls too low, there will be less calcium bound to the calsequestrin. This means that there is more room on the calsequestrin, to bind to the junctin, triadin and ryanodine receptor, therefore it binds tighter. However, if calcium within the SR rises too high, more calcium binds to the calsequestrin and therefore it binds to the junctin-triadin-RyR complex less tightly. The RyR can therefore open and release calcium into the cell.
In addition to the effects that PKA had on phospholamban (see above) that resulted in increased relaxation of the cardiac muscle, PKA (as well as another enzyme called calmodulin kinase II) can also phosphorylate ryanodine receptors. When phosphorylated, RyRs are more sensitive to calcium, therefore they open more often and for longer periods of time. This increases calcium release from the SR, increasing the rate of contraction. Therefore, in cardiac muscle, activation of PKA, through the cyclic AMP pathway, results in increased muscle contraction (via RyR2 phosphorylation) and increased relaxation (via phospholamban phosphorylation), which increases heart rate.

The mechanism behind the termination of calcium release through the RyR is still not fully understood. Some researchers believe it is due to the random closing of ryanodine receptors (known as stochastic attrition), or the ryanodine receptors becoming inactive after a calcium spark, while others believe that a decrease in SR calcium, triggers the receptors to close (see calcium sparks for more details).

== Role in rigor mortis==
The breakdown of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, along with the resultant release of calcium, is an important contributor to rigor mortis, the stiffening of muscles after death.

An increase in calcium concentration in the sarcoplasm can also cause muscle stiffness.

<text>Yeung Sum (; born 22 November 1947 in Guangzhou) is a Hong Kong politician and academic. He served several terms as a Legislative Councillor and was the second chairman of the Democratic Party (DP), a pro-democracy political party in Hong Kong. He is a lecturer at the University of Hong Kong.

==Biography==
Yeung Sum obtained his undergraduate degree at the University of Hong Kong. He was a residential member in &quot;St. John&#x27;s College&quot; and became the president of its student association from 1972–1973. He gained his master&#x27;s degree at the University of York in Britain before returning to earn his doctorate from the University of Hong Kong. Yeung Sum has taught at the University of Hong Kong since 1979 and has been a lecturer in the Department of Social Work and Social Administration since 1985.

When the issue of Hong Kong sovereignty after 1997 came up in 1983, Yeung and some graduates from the University of Hong Kong founded Meeting Point, the first political organisation supporting Hong Kong&#x27;s return to Chinese sovereignty. During the drafting of the Hong Kong Basic Law, he pushed for a democratic model for Hong Kong after 1997. He was the second chairman of the group from 1988 to 1989. He also formed the Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government with liberal-minded drafters Martin Lee and Szeto Wah and became the spokesman of the committee. He was a committee member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China during the Tiananmen protests of 1989 and remained critical of the Chinese government after the bloody crackdown.

In 1990, he became the founding vice-chairman of the United Democrats of Hong Kong, the first pro-democracy party and filled candidates in the District Board elections and Urban and Regional Councils elections. In the first Legislative Council direct election, he was directly elected through the Island West constituency. He became the vice-chairman of the Democratic Party when the United Democrats and Meeting Point merged in 1994.

Yeung remained legislator until the legislature was dissolved in 1997 when Hong Kong was handed over to China. He was re-elected to the Legislative Council in the 1998 LegCo election and remained in the LegCo until he stepped down as the second place on the party&#x27;s candidate list in 2008 behind Kam Nai-wai.

Yeung represented the Mainstreamers, a relatively moderate faction, within the democratic camp, and discontent with him within the Democrats led to splits within the party. When Yeung took the chairmanship from Martin Lee in 2002, legislator Albert Chan quit the party, and the following year a number of &quot;Young Turks&quot; left the party to join The Frontier. In 2004, taking responsibility for recent election failures, he announced that he would not seek another term as party chairman. He has remained on the party&#x27;s central committee and executive committees occasionally.

On 28 February 2020, Yeung was arrested over his involvement in a march on 31 August 2019 which was part of
protests sparked by the extradition bill, and had been classified by police
as illegal assembly. A few hours later, he was released on bail, as were the other arrestees Jimmy Lai
and Lee Cheuk-yan. The cases were scheduled to be heard at Eastern Law Court on 5 May 2020. On 18 April, Yeung was again arrested as one of 15 Hong Kong high-profile democracy figures, on suspicion of organizing, publicizing or taking part in several unauthorized assemblies between August and October 2019 in the course of the anti-extradition bill protests. Following protocol, the police statement did not disclose the names of the accused.

On 10 June 2022, Sum, along the two other pro-democracy figures, had his Silver Bauhinia Star honour removed, and his Justice of the Peace appointment was revoked by the government due to his jail sentences related to anti extradition-bill protests.

<text>Frank Rudolph Paul (; born Rudolph Franz Paul; April 18, 1884 – June 29, 1963) was an American illustrator of pulp magazines in the science fiction field.

A discovery of editor Hugo Gernsback, Paul was influential in defining the look of both cover art and interior illustrations in the nascent science fiction pulps of the 1920s.

The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in 2009.

==Biography==
Paul was born on April 18, 1884, in Radkersburg, Austria-Hungary. His father was from Hungary and his mother from Czechoslovakia. He emigrated to the United States in 1906. He married Rudolpha Costa Rigelsen, a Belgian immigrant, in 1913, and they had four children, Robert S. Paul (born 1915), Francis L. Paul (born 1919), Joan C. Paul (born 1921), and Patricia Ann Paul (born 1929). He studied art in Vienna, Paris, and New York City. He went to work for the Jersey Journal performing graphic design. Publisher Hugo Gernsback hired him in 1914 to illustrate &quot;The Electrical Experimenter&quot;, a science magazine.

He died on June 29, 1963, at his home in Teaneck, New Jersey.

==Work==
Paul&#x27;s work is characterized by dramatic compositions (often involving enormous machines, robots or spaceships), bright or even garish colors, and a limited ability to depict human faces, especially the female ones. His early architectural training is also evident in his work.

Paul illustrated the cover of Gernsback&#x27;s own novel, &quot;Ralph 124C 41+: A Romance of the Year 2660&quot; (The Stratford Company, 1925), originally a 1911–1912 serial. He painted 38 covers for &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; from April 1926 to June 1929 and seven for the &quot;Amazing Stories Annual&quot; and &quot;Quarterly&quot;; with several dozen additional issues featuring his art on the back cover (May 1939 to July 1946), and several issues from April 1961 to September 1968 featuring new or reproduced art. After Gernsback lost control of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in 1929, Paul followed him to the &quot;Wonder Stories&quot; magazines and associated quarterlies, which published 103 of his color covers from June 1929 to April 1936. Paul also painted covers for &quot;Planet Stories&quot;, &quot;Superworld Comics&quot;, &quot;Science Fiction&quot; magazine, and the first issue (October–November 1939) of &quot;Marvel Comics&quot;. The latter featured the debuts of Human Torch and Sub-Mariner, and good copies sell at auction for twenty to thirty thousand dollars. All told, his magazine covers exceed 220.

His most famous &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; cover is probably that for August 1927 (see image), illustrating &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; by H. G. Wells, whose serial reprint began in that number. 

Paul created hundreds of interior illustrations from no later than 1920.

&quot;From The Pen of Paul: The Fantastic Images of Frank R. Paul&quot;, edited and an introduction by Stephen Korshak with a preface by Sir Arthur C. Clarke, is a giant compendium and very first collection ever published showcasing many of Paul&#x27;s full-color science-fiction artwork; Korshak Collection.
==Influence on the genre==
In many ways, Frank R. Paul&#x27;s achievements and influence on the field through the ages cannot be overestimated. His work appeared on the cover of the first issue (April 1926) of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; magazine, the first magazine dedicated to science fiction. He would paint all the covers for over three years. These visions of robots, spaceships, and aliens were presented to an America wherein most people did not even have a telephone. Indeed, they were the first science fiction images seen by Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, Forrest J Ackerman and others who would go on to great prominence in the field. Arthur C. Clarke wrote that the first science fiction magazine he encountered was the November 1928 edition of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, with a cover by Paul. He cites this as a crucial early incident that shifted his interest to science fiction. Clarke also comments on Paul&#x27;s accurate depiction of Jupiter on that 1928 cover:

Paul&#x27;s emphasis on concept, action and milieu over human figures was to continue to be a defining genre signal of SF art even when executed by successors with greater technical skill and more depth of artistic vision. The visual language of the majority of SF art centers, even today, are more sophisticated versions of Paul&#x27;s central tropes. 

The Frank R Paul Award, named in his honor, was awarded by the Nashville Science Fiction Association from 1976 to 1996 to such distinguished artists as Frank Kelly Freas, Alex Schomburg and Victoria Poyser.

==Firsts==
Frank R. Paul can be credited with the first color painting of a space station (August 1929, &quot;Science Wonder Stories&quot;) published in the U.S. His cover for the November 1929 &quot;Science Wonder Stories&quot; was an early, if not the earliest, depiction of a flying saucer. This painting appeared almost two decades before the sightings of mysterious flying objects by Kenneth Arnold. So large was his stature that he was the only guest of honor at the first World Science Fiction Convention in 1939. He has been described as the first person to make a living drawing spaceships; this is a slight exaggeration, as much of his income was also derived from technical drawing. He was also the cover artist of &quot;Marvel Comics&quot; #1 (Oct. 1939), the first ever Marvel Comic and became well known for his work.

He was very innovative in the depiction of spaceships. Several of his illustrations were disc shaped and it has been speculated that he may have, accidentally, created the UFO craze when the first sighting of lights in the sky were described as disc shaped; this would have been the result of the psychological phenomenon known as mental set.

<doc id="423459" wikidata="Q209339" url="?curid=423459" title="Two-cent piece (United States)">
<text>The two-cent piece was produced by the Mint of the United States for circulation from 1864 to 1872 and for collectors in 1873. Designed by James B. Longacre, there were decreasing mintages each year, as other minor coins such as the nickel proved more popular. It was abolished by the Mint Act of 1873.

The economic turmoil of the American Civil War caused government-issued coins, even the non-silver Indian Head cent, to vanish from circulation, hoarded by the public. One means of filling this gap was private token issues, often made of bronze. The cent at that time was struck of a copper-nickel alloy, the same diameter as the later Lincoln cent, but somewhat thicker. The piece was difficult for the Philadelphia Mint to strike, and Mint officials, as well as the annual Assay Commission, recommended the coin&#x27;s replacement. Despite opposition from those wishing to keep the metal nickel in the coinage, led by Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1864, authorizing bronze cents and two-cent pieces.

Although initially popular in the absence of other federal coinage, the two-cent piece&#x27;s place in circulation was usurped by other base-metal coins which Congress subsequently authorized, the three-cent piece and the nickel. It was abolished in 1873; large quantities were redeemed by the government and melted. Nevertheless, two-cent pieces remain relatively inexpensive by the standards of 19th-century American coinage.

== Inception ==

A two-cent piece had been proposed in 1806 by Connecticut Senator Uriah Tracy, along with a twenty-cent piece or &quot;double dime&quot;. Reflecting the then-prevalent view that coins should contain their value in metal, Tracy&#x27;s bill provided that the two-cent piece be made of billon, or debased silver. The bill was opposed by Mint Director Robert Patterson, as it would be difficult to refine the silver from melted-down pieces. Although Tracy&#x27;s legislation passed the Senate twice, in 1806 and 1807, it failed in the House of Representatives. Patterson sent a brass button with two of the billon planchets that would have been used for the coin to Tracy, showing how hard it would be to prevent counterfeiting. The Mint considered a two-cent piece in 1836, and experiments were conducted by Second Engraver Christian Gobrecht and Melter and Refiner Franklin Peale. The piece was to be again of billon, and provision for the coin was included in early drafts of the Mint Act of 1837, but the proposal was dropped when Peale was able to show that the coin could be easily counterfeited.
Until 1857, the cent coin was a large copper piece, containing about its face value in metal. These coins were unpopular, and in 1857, after receiving congressional approval, the Mint began issuing the Flying Eagle cent, of the diameter of the later Lincoln cent, but somewhat thicker and made of copper-nickel alloy. These pieces readily circulated, and although the design did not strike well and was replaced by the Indian Head cent in 1859, the coins were commonly used until all federal coinage vanished from circulation in much of the United States in 1861 and 1862, during the economic turmoil of the American Civil War. This happened because many Northerners feared that if the war went poorly, paper money and government bonds might become worthless. The gap was filled by, among other things, private token issues, sometimes in copper-nickel approximating the size of the cent, but often thinner pieces in bronze.

This fact did not escape government officials, and when, in 1863, they attempted to restore coins to circulation, the use of bronze coins, which would not contain their face values in metal, was considered. In his annual report submitted October 1, 1863, Mint Director James Pollock noted that &quot;whilst people expect a full value in their gold and silver coins, they merely want the inferior [base metal] money for convenience in making exact payments&quot;. He observed that the private cent tokens had sometimes contained as little as a fifth of a cent in metal, yet had still circulated. He proposed that the copper-nickel cent be replaced with a bronze piece of the same size. Pollock also wanted to eliminate nickel as a coinage metal; its hard alloys destroyed dies and machinery. On December 8, Pollock wrote to Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, proposing a bronze cent and two-cent piece, and enclosing pattern coins of the two-cent piece that he had had prepared. According to numismatist Neil Carothers, a two-cent piece was most likely proposed in order to get as much dollar value in small change into circulation in as short a time as possible, as the Mint could strike a two-cent piece as easily as a cent.

== Legislation ==

On March 2, 1864, Pollock wrote urgently to Chase, warning him that the Mint was running out of nickel and that demand for cents was at an all-time high. He also informed the Secretary that the United States Assay Commission, composed of citizens and officials who had met the previous month to test the nation&#x27;s silver and gold coinage, had recommended the use of French bronze (95% copper with the remainder tin and zinc) as a coinage metal for the cent and a new two-cent piece. Three days later, Chase sent Pollock&#x27;s December letter and draft legislation for bronze one- and two-cent pieces to Maine Senator William P. Fessenden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Fessenden took no immediate action, and on March 16, Pollock wrote again to Chase, warning that the Mint was going to run out of nickel, much of which was imported. Chase forwarded his letter to Fessenden. Legislation was finally introduced by New Hampshire Senator Daniel Clark on March 22; Pollock&#x27;s letters were read and apparently influenced proceedings as the Senate passed the bill without debate.

The domestic supply of nickel was at that time produced by a mine at Gap, Pennsylvania, owned by industrialist Joseph Wharton. On March 19, Pollock wrote to Chase that they had no more nickel, nor was any available from overseas; &quot;we are thus shut up to the home supply; from the works of Mr. Wharton&quot;. Opposed to the removal of nickel from the cent, Wharton published a pamphlet in April 1864 proposing coinage of one-, two-, three-, five-, and ten-cent pieces of an alloy of one part nickel to three of copper, doubling the percentage of nickel used in the cent. Despite Wharton&#x27;s efforts, on April 20, a select committee of the House of Representatives endorsed the bill. It was opposed by Pennsylvania&#x27;s Thaddeus Stevens, who represented the mining area from which Wharton extracted his nickel. Wharton had spent $200,000 to develop his mine and ore refinement machinery, Stevens related, and it was unfair to deprive him of the major use of his metal. &quot;Shall we destroy all this property because by coining with another metal more money may be saved to the government?&quot; Besides, he argued, the copper-nickel alloy for the cent had been approved by Congress, and the new metal, which he termed &quot;brass&quot;, would show rust. He was rebutted by Iowa Congressman John A. Kasson, chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, who stated that the bronze alloy did not resemble brass, and he could not support the proposition that the government is bound to purchase from a supplier because he has spent money in anticipation of sales.

The legislation passed the House, and the Coinage Act of 1864 was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on April 22, 1864. The legislation made base metal coins legal tender for the first time: both cents and two-cent pieces were acceptable in quantities of up to ten. The government would not, however, redeem them in bulk. The act also outlawed the private one- and two-cent tokens, and later that year Congress abolished all such issues. The legislation did not allow for the redemption of the old copper-nickel cents; it had been drafted by Pollock, who was hoping that the seignorage income from issuing the new coins would help finance Mint operations, and he did not want it reduced by the recall of the old pieces. Wharton and his interests were appeased by the passage of a bill for a three-cent piece in 1865 and a five-cent piece in 1866, both of his proposed alloy, out of which the &quot;nickel&quot;, as the latter coin has come to be known, is still struck.

== Design ==

In late 1861, the Reverend Mark R. Watkinson of Ridleyville, Pennsylvania, had written to Chase, proposing that some reference to God be placed on the coinage in that time of war, and on November 20 of that year, Chase wrote to Mint Director Pollock, &quot;No nation can be strong except in the strength of God, or safe except in His defense. The trust of our people in God should be declared on our national coins. You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest tersest terms possible this national recognition.&quot; Several mottoes were considered by Pollock, including &quot;God Our Trust&quot; and &quot;God and Our Country&quot;. Some of the patterns he sent Chase in December 1863 used &quot;God Our Trust&quot;, and he wrote of the design, &quot;the devices are beautiful and appropriate, and the motto on each such, as all who fear God and love their country, will approve.&quot; He also sent pattern coins depicting George Washington; Chase responded to the letter, &quot;I approve your mottoes, only suggesting that on that with the Washington obverse the motto should begin with the word OUR, so as to read OUR GOD AND OUR COUNTRY. And on that with the shield, it should be changed so as to read: IN GOD WE TRUST.&quot; Pollock had been inspired by &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, a later stanza of which includes the line, &quot;And this be our motto, &#x27;In God Is Our Trust&#x27; &quot;. Chase may have been influenced in his decision by the motto of his alma mater, Brown University, &quot;In Deo Speramus&quot; (In God We Hope).

As the mottoes to be placed on coinage were prescribed by the 1837 act, a legislative change was needed. The act which created the two-cent piece authorized the Mint Director, with the Secretary of the Treasury&#x27;s approval, to prescribe the designs and mottoes to be used. Longacre&#x27;s two-cent piece was the first coin inscribed with &quot;In God We Trust&quot;. The motto was popularized by the new coin; on March 3, 1865, Congress passed legislation ordering its use on all coins large enough to permit it. Since 1938, &quot;In God We Trust&quot; has been used on all American coins.

The obverse design is a Longacre version of the Great Seal of the United States. His design focuses on the shield, or escutcheon, as a defensive weapon, signifying strength and self-protection through unity. The upper part of the shield, or &quot;chief&quot;, symbolizes Congress, while the 13 vertical stripes, or &quot;paleways&quot;, represent the thirteen original states. Consequently, the entire escutcheon symbolizes the strength of the federal government through the unity of the states. The crossed arrows represent nonaggression, but imply readiness against attack. The laurel branches, taken from Greek tradition, symbolize victory. In heraldic engraving, vertical lines represent red, clear areas white and horizontal lines blue, thus the escutcheon is colored red, white and blue and is meant to evoke the American flag. The reverse contains the denomination &quot;2 CENTS&quot; within a somewhat ornate wheat wreath. The rest of the coin is filled with the name of the country.

Art historian Cornelius Vermeule deemed the two-cent piece &quot;the most Gothic and the most expressive of the Civil War&quot; of all American coins. &quot;The shield, arrows, and wreath of the obverse need only flanking cannon to be the consummate expression of Civil War heraldry.&quot; Vermeule suggested that the coin appears calligraphic, rather than sculptural, and ascribed this to Longacre&#x27;s early career as a plate engraver.

== Production and collecting ==

A few thousand of the first circulation strikes, as well as a handful of proof coins, came from a prototype die with smaller letters in the motto than all other 1864 pieces. Although specimens of the two-cent piece, being of base metal, were not set aside for testing by the annual Assay Commission, Congress did order that internal checks be done at the Mint as to their composition and weight.

The two-cent piece was at first a success, circulating freely once enough of them were issued to be recognized by the public. It initially circulated because of the wartime coin shortage, which was alleviated by the new cent and two-cent piece. Although Pollock reported hoarding of cents in his June 1864 report, he did not thereafter mention such activities. Silver coins still did not circulate in much of the nation, and the new coins (joined by the three- and five-cent pieces of copper-nickel, first struck in 1865 and 1866 respectively) answered the need for small change. In October 1864, he reported that the demand for both coins had been unprecedented and that every effort was being made to increase production; in his report the next June, he called the two-cent piece &quot;a most convenient and popular coin&quot;. The Act of March 3, 1865, that provided for the three-cent nickel piece, reduced the legal tender limit of the bronze coins to four cents, while making the newly authorized coin acceptable up to sixty cents.
After the large mintage of just under twenty million in the first year, according to numismatist Q. David Bowers, &quot;enthusiasm and public acceptance waned&quot;. After the war, bank demand for the denomination dropped, while demand for the new five-cent nickel increased; mintages of the two-cent piece were smaller every year. Lange notes, &quot;it was evident by the end of the 1860s that its coinage was no longer necessary&quot;. According to Carothers, &quot;the coinage of a 2 cent piece was unnecessary. While it was popular at first because of the great public demand for metallic small change, it was a superfluous denomination, and its circulation waned rapidly after the 5 cent nickel coin was introduced.&quot;

Beginning in 1867, the new Mint Director, Henry Linderman, (Pollock had resigned) began to advocate for Congress to authorize redemption of surplus copper and bronze coinage. Although the nickel could be redeemed in lots (permission granted in its authorizing act), there was no provision for the government to buy back the smaller coins, and with more being issued every year, there were too many small-value coins. Treasury officials insisted the government could not accept the pieces beyond their legal tender limits, even if what was being done was exchanging them for other currency. Under Linderman, the Mint, without any legal authority, purchased in bronze coins using three-cent pieces and nickels. Still, millions of two-cent pieces accumulated in the hands of newspaper and transit companies, postmasters, and others who took small payments from the public, and there were complaints to Congress. With the advent of the Grant administration, Pollock returned to office and opposed the redemption proposals. Although he included Pollock&#x27;s opinions as part of his annual report, Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell asked Congress to pass a redemption act, and it did so on March 3, 1871, allowing for the redemption of minor coinage in lots of not less than . It also allowed the Treasury Secretary to discontinue the coinage of any piece redeemed in large numbers. Pursuant to the new law, the Mint in 1871 and 1872 redeemed over 37,000,000 small coins, including two-cent pieces.
In the postwar years, Congress and the Treasury considered a revision of the coinage laws, as the act of 1837 was deemed outdated. Retention of the two-cent piece was never seriously considered in the debates over what became the Mint Act of 1873; the only question concerning the minor coinage was whether to make the cent from bronze or copper-nickel, and how large to make the three-cent nickel. With those pieces remaining unchanged, the bill passed on February 12, 1873, putting an end to the two-cent piece series.

With the two-cent piece likely to be abolished, only 65,000 were struck for circulation in 1872; it is unclear why they were struck at all. On January 18, 1873, Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Archibald Loudon Snowden complained that the &quot;3&quot; in the date, as struck by the Mint, too closely resembled an &quot;8&quot;, especially on the smaller-sized denominations. In response, Pollock ordered the new chief engraver, William Barber (Longacre had died in 1869), to re-engrave the date, opening the arms of the &quot;3&quot; wider on most denominations. The two-cent piece was struck only in proof condition in 1873, and due to its February abolition, there should not have been time or reason for Barber to re-engrave the coin. Nevertheless, it exists in &quot;Closed 3&quot; and &quot;Open 3&quot; varieties. Breen suggested that the &quot;Open 3&quot; variety was actually struck at a later date, probably clandestinely; it was not known to exist until discovered by a numismatist in the 1950s. Numismatist Paul Green ascribed the two varieties to the two types of proof sets that the Mint sold at the time that would have contained the two-cent piece. The &quot;nickel set&quot; contained only the low-value coins without precious metal, while another contained also the silver coins; he suggested that one variety was struck for each.

Large quantities of two-cent pieces were withdrawn in the 1870s and after. Approximately 17,000,000 of the some 45,600,000 two-cent pieces issued had been repurchased by the Treasury as of 1909. Withdrawn pieces were melted and recoined into one-cent pieces. A bill for a two-cent piece bearing the portrait of recently deceased former president Theodore Roosevelt passed the Senate in 1920 and was strongly recommended by a House committee but never enacted. Numismatist S. W. Freeman noted in 1954 that few alive could remember using a two-cent piece, but for those who did, it was often associated with spending it at a candy store. He recalled that two cents would buy a quantity of sweets, as a dime did in Freeman&#x27;s day, and, he feared, it would take a quarter to do in the future. Full legal tender status was confirmed for the two-cent piece by the Coinage Act of 1965, long after the coin had passed from circulation, as it made all coins and currency of the United States good for all public and private debts without limit. Nevertheless, numismatist Jack White pointed out in a 1971 column that due to its short lifespan, the piece &quot;hardly got its two cents in&quot;.

R.S. Yeoman&#x27;s 2018 edition of &quot;A Guide Book of United States Coins&quot; lists the 1864 large motto and the 1865 as the least expensive two-cent pieces, in good (G-4) condition at , though every issue by year through 1871 lists for or less in that condition. The reason for the relatively flat prices, even in top grades, is a lack of collectors who seek the entire series (it is most popularly collected with a single specimen as part of a &quot;type set&quot; of the various issues of American coins). Despite the high mintage, it is the 1864 date that has one of the more highly valued varieties, the &quot;small motto&quot;. Yeoman lists the 1864 small motto in Proof condition, at and in Very Fine (VF-20) it is .

<doc id="423462" wikidata="Q7788880" url="?curid=423462" title="Thomas Davis (Young Irelander)">
<text>Thomas Osborne Davis (14 October 1814 – 16 September 1845) was an Irish writer; with Charles Gavan Duffy and John Blake Dillon, a founding editor of &quot;The Nation,&quot; the weekly organ of what came to be known as the Young Ireland movement. While embracing the common cause of a representative, national government for Ireland, Davis took issue with the nationalist leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell by arguing for the common (&quot;mixed&quot;) education of Catholics and Protestants and by advocating for Irish as the national language.

==Early life==
Thomas Davis was born on 14 October 1814, in Mallow, County Cork, fourth and last child of James Davis, a Welsh surgeon in the Royal Artillery based for many years in Dublin, and an Irish mother. His father died in Exeter a month before his birth, en route to serve in the Peninsular War. His mother was Protestant, but also related to the Chiefs of Clan O&#x27;Sullivan of Beare, members of the Gaelic nobility of Ireland.

His mother had enough money to live on her own and moved back to Dublin in 1818, taking up residence at 67 Lower Baggot Street in 1830, where Davis lived until his death in 1845. He attended school in Lower Mount Street, then went to Trinity College, Dublin. He became auditor of the College Historical Society, and graduated in 1835 with a degree in Logic. From 1836 to 1838, he studied law in London and Europe; although he qualified as a lawyer in 1838, he never practised.

==Cultural nationalist==
Davis has been seen as an early exponent in Ireland of what has since been understood as cultural nationalism. In contrast to the Painite republicanism of the 1790s, and to the mix of Benthamite utilitarianism and Catholic devotionalism that characterised O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s leadership of the national movement, Davis sought inspiration in the study of Gaelic civilisation, Christian and pre-Christian.

As a Protestant, Davis preached religious unity, often building on the civic and enlightenment ideas promoted by the United Irishmen prior to the 1798 Rebellion. But he was also heavily influenced by romantic nationalism and by the ideas of Johann Gottfried von Herder (1744–1803), who argued nationality was not genetic but the product of climate, geography and inclination.

In September 1842, he established &quot;The Nation&quot; newspaper with Charles Gavan Duffy and John Blake Dillon. Ostensibly designed to support O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s campaign for repeal of the 1801 Union, Davis made it a vehicle for promoting the Irish language, and an Irish cultural identity separate from that of Britain. This focus can be seen in several letters written shortly before his death in 1843, that emphasise the uniqueness of the Irish countryside, and its inhabitants as a &quot;rising, not declining, people&quot;.

His June 1840 speech as the outgoing president of the College Historical Society, contains the first explicit statement of belief in the Irish nation.
The country of our birth, our educations, our recollections, ancestral, personal, national; the country of our loves, our friendships, our hopes; our country: the cosmopolite is unnatural, base - I would fain say, impossible. To act on a world is for those above it, not of it. Patriotism is human philanthropy.

Although a native Irish speaker, O’Connell did not share this cultural nationalism. He declared &quot;the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication&quot; too great a consideration for him to regret &quot;the gradual abandonment &quot; of Irish.

==Differences with Daniel O&#x27;Connell==
Davis supported O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s Repeal Association from 1840, hoping to restore, on a reformed basis, an Irish Parliament in Dublin. There were tensions, but an open split with O&#x27;Connell first developed in 1845 on the question of non-denominational education, when the vehemence of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s opposition reduced Davis to tears. In advance of some of the Catholic bishops, O&#x27;Connell had denounced as &quot;godless&quot; the three new Queens Colleges in which Dublin Castle proposed to educate Catholics and Protestants together in a non-denominational basis.

When, in &quot;The Nation,&quot; Davis pleaded that &quot;reasons for separate education are reasons for [a] separate life&quot;. O&#x27;Connell accused Davis of suggesting it a &quot;crime to be a Catholic&quot; and declared himself content to take a stand &quot;for Old Ireland&quot;. Davis, Duffy and others in the circle around &quot;The Nation&quot; he now referred to as Young Irelanders—for O&#x27;Connell an unflattering reference to Giuseppe Mazzini&#x27;s anti-clerical and insurrectionist Young Italy.

A further rift with O&#x27;Connell opened over the question of a path to a possible compromise between Union and Repeal. While insisting he would &quot;never ask for or work&quot; for anything less than an independent legislature, O&#x27;Connell had suggested he might accept a &quot;subordinate parliament&quot; (an Irish legislature with powers &quot;devolved&quot; from Westminster) as &quot;an instalment&quot;. Unlike some of his colleagues at &quot;The Nation&quot;, Davis did not reject this in principle. But while O&#x27;Connell looked for compromise at Westminster, Davis sought agreement with the &quot;federalist&quot; William Sharman Crawford, a representative of Protestant Ulster upon which O&#x27;Connell appeared to turn his back.

==Death==
Despite their differences, O&#x27;Connell was distraught at Davis&#x27;s early and sudden death. Davis died from scarlet fever in 1845 at the age of 30. He was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin.

Davis composed a number of songs, including Irish rebel songs, such as &quot;The West&#x27;s Asleep&quot;, &quot;A Nation Once Again&quot;, &quot;In Bodenstown Churchyard&quot;, and the &quot;Lament for Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill&quot;. He wrote that &quot;a song is worth a thousand harangues&quot;. Music, he suggested, &quot;is the first faculty of the Irish... we will endeavour to teach the people to sing the songs of their country that they may keep alive in their minds the love of the fatherland.&quot;

As well as many contributions to periodicals and newspapers, he wrote a memoir of John Philpot Curran, the Irish lawyer and orator, prefixed to an edition of his speeches, and a history of the 1689 Patriot Parliament; other literary plans were left unfinished by his early death.

A statue of Davis, created by Edward Delaney, was unveiled on College Green, Dublin, in 1966, attended by the Irish president, Éamon de Valera.

The main street of his home town of Mallow is named Davis Street, which contains a bronze statue of Davis designed by sculptor Leo Higgins. One of the secondary schools in Mallow, Davis College, is named after him.

A number of Gaelic Athletic Association clubs around the country are also named after him, including one in Tallaght, Dublin and one in Corrinshego, County Armagh.

Fort Davis, at the entrance to Cork Harbour, is named after him.

Thomas Davis Street, off Francis Street in Dublin 8, is also named after him.

<text>Vincent Rijmen (; born 16 October 1970) is a Belgian cryptographer and one of the two designers of the Rijndael, the Advanced Encryption Standard. Rijmen is also the co-designer of the WHIRLPOOL cryptographic hash function, and the block ciphers Anubis, KHAZAD, Square, NOEKEON and SHARK.

In 1993, Rijmen obtained a degree in electronics engineering at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Afterwards, he was a PhD student at the ESAT/COSIC lab of the K.U.Leuven. In 1997, Rijmen finished his doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Cryptanalysis and design of iterated block ciphers&quot;.

After his PhD he did postdoctoral work at the COSIC lab, on several occasions collaborating with Joan Daemen. One of their joint projects resulted in the algorithm Rijndael, which in October 2000 was selected by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) to become the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

Since 1 August 2001, Rijmen has been working as chief cryptographer at Cryptomathic where he cooperated with cryptographers such as Peter Landrock. From 2001 to 2003, Rijmen was a visiting professor at the Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications at Graz University of Technology (Austria), and a full professor there from 2004 to 2007. Since October 2007, Rijmen has worked again with the COSIC lab and currently holds a professor position (gewoon hoogleraar) at K.U.Leuven. Since January 2019 he is also an adjunct professor at Selmer Center (the secure communication group at the University of Bergen, Norway).

In 2002, he was named by the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.

In 2019, he was named a Fellow of the International Association for Cryptologic Research for &quot;co-designing AES, contributions to the design and cryptanalysis of symmetric primitives, and service to the IACR.&quot;

In 2020, he received, with Joan Daemen, the RSA Award for Excellence in Mathematics from the hands of Ron Rivest.

In 2023, he received the Levchin Prize for his work on AES.

<doc id="423470" wikidata="Q689831" url="?curid=423470" title="Oirats">
<text>Oirats (; ) or Oirds ( ; ), formerly known as Eluts and Eleuths ( or ; , &quot;Èlǔtè&quot;), are the westernmost group of the Mongols, whose ancestral home is in the Altai region of Siberia, Xinjiang and western Mongolia.

The first documented reference to Elut and Yelut was in the Onginsk &quot;rune&quot; inscriptions dated in the sixth century. Historically, the Oirats were composed of four major tribes: Dzungar (Choros or Olots/Elut/Yelut/&quot;Èlǔtè&quot;), Torghut, Dörbet and Khoshut.

The political elite of the Rouran and Tobgach empires were YELÜ-T Mongolic speakers. Although these two empires encompassed multilingual populations, the language of diplomacy, trade, and culture was an ÖLÜ (YELÜ) dialect of ancient Mongolic descent. When the Tobgach destroyed the Rouran Empire, the Mongolic-speaking Avar people escaped into the Caspian steppes.

This displacement triggered a series of events. Settling in the Caucasus around 558, the Mongolic Avars intervened in Germanic tribal conflicts, forming alliances such as with the Lombards to overthrow the Gepidae, who were Byzantine allies. Between 550 and 575, they solidified their presence by establishing the Khanate of the Mongolic Avars (6th to 8th century) in the Caspian and Hungarian steppes.

The modern Kalmyks of Kalmykia on the Caspian Sea in southeastern Europe are Oirats.

== Etymology ==
The name derives from Mongolic &#x27; &lt; *&quot;hoi&quot; (&quot;forest, woods&quot;) and &#x27; &lt; *&quot;harad&quot; (&quot;people&quot;), and they were counted among the &quot;&quot; in the 13th century. An opinion believes the name derives from Mongolian word &quot;oirt&quot; meaning &quot;close (as in distance),&quot; as in &quot;close/nearer ones.&quot;

The name Oirat may derive from a corruption of the group&#x27;s original name &quot;Dörben Öörd&quot;, meaning &quot;The Allied Four&quot;. Perhaps inspired by the designation Dörben Öörd, other Mongols at times used the term &quot;Döchin Mongols&quot; for themselves (&quot;Döchin&quot; meaning forty), but there was rarely as great a degree of unity among larger numbers of tribes as among the Oirats.

==Writing system==

In the 17th century, Zaya Pandita, a Gelug monk of the Khoshut tribe, devised a new writing system called Clear Script for use by Oirats. This system was developed on the basis of the older Mongolian script, but had a more developed system of diacritics to preclude misreading and reflected some lexical and grammatical differences that the Oirat language has from Mongolian.

The Clear Script remained in use in Kalmykia until the mid-1920s when it was replaced by a Latin alphabet, and later the Cyrillic script. It can be seen in some public signs in the Kalmyk capital, Elista, and is superficially taught in schools. In Mongolia it was likewise replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet in 1941. Some Oirats in China still use the Clear Script as their primary writing system, as well as Mongolian script.

A monument of Zaya Pandita was unveiled on the 400th anniversary of Zaya Pandita&#x27;s birth, and on 350th anniversary of his creation of the Clear Script.

==History==

The Oirats share some history, geography, culture and language with the Eastern Mongols, and were at various times united under the same leader as a larger Mongol entity, whether that ruler was of Oirat descent or of Chingissids.

Comprising the Khoshut (Mongolian: &quot;хошууд&quot;, &quot;hošuud&quot;), Choros or Ölöt (&quot;өөлд&quot;, &quot;Ööld&quot;), Torghut (&quot;торгууд&quot;, &quot;Torguud&quot;), and Dörbet (&quot;дөрвөд&quot;, &quot;Dörvöd&quot;) ethnic groups, they were dubbed Kalmyk or Kalmak, which means &quot;remnant&quot; or &quot;to remain&quot;, by their western Turkic neighbours. Various sources also list the Bargut, Buzava, Keraites, and Naiman tribes as comprising part of the Dörben Öörd; some tribes may have joined the original four only in later years. This name may however reflect the Kalmyks&#x27; &quot;remaining&quot; Buddhist rather than converting to Islam; or the Kalmyks&#x27; &quot;remaining&quot; in the Altay region when the Turkic tribes migrated further west.

After the fall of the Yuan dynasty, Oirat and Eastern Mongols had developed separate identities to the point where Oirats called themselves &quot;Four Oirats&quot; while they used the term &quot;Mongols&quot; for those under the Khagans in the east.

===Early history===
One of the earliest mentions of the Oirat people, in a historical text, can be found in the &quot;Secret History of the Mongols&quot;, a 13th century chronicle of Genghis Khan&#x27;s rise to power. In &quot;The Secret History&quot;, the Oirats are counted among the &quot;forest people&quot;, and are said to live under the rule of a shaman-chief known as &quot;bäki&quot;. They lived in Tuva and the Mongolian Khövsgöl Province; the Oirats moved south in the 14th century.

In one famous passage, the Oirat chief Qutuqa Beki used a &quot;yada&quot;, or &#x27;thunder stone&#x27;, to unleash a powerful storm on Genghis&#x27; army. The magical ploy backfired, however, when an unexpected wind blew the storm back towards him. During the early stages of Genghis&#x27; rise to power, the Oirats under Bäki fought against Genghis but were defeated. The Oirats would then fully submit to Mongol rule after their ally, Jamukha, Genghis&#x27; childhood friend and later rival, was killed.

Subject to the Khan, the Oirats turned themselves into a loyal and formidable faction of the Mongol war machine. In 1207, Jochi, the eldest son of Genghis, subjugated the forest tribes, including the Oirats and the Yenisei Kyrgyz; the Great Khan gave those peoples to his son, Jochi, and had one of his daughters, Checheygen, marry chief Bäki (or his son). There were notable Oirats in the Mongol Empire, such as Arghun Agha and his son, Nowruz.

In 1256, a group of the Oirats under Bukha-Temür (Mongolian: Буха-Төмөр, Бөхтөмөр) joined Hulagu&#x27;s expedition against the Abbasids and participated in the Mongol campaign against the Nizaris in Iran. The Ilkhan Hulagu and his successor, Abagha, resettled them in Turkey. Then, they took part in the Second Battle of Homs, where the Mongols were defeated. The majority of the Oirats, who were left behind, supported Ariq Böke against Kublai in the Toluid Civil War. Kublai defeated his younger brother, and they entered the service of the victor.

In 1295, more than 10,000 Oirats under Targhai Khurgen, son-in-law of the Borjigin family, fled Syria, then under the Mamluks, as they were despised by both Muslim Mongols and local Turks. They were well-received by Egypt&#x27;s Sultan, Al-Adil Kitbugha, himself of Oirat origin. Ali Pasha, the governor of Baghdad and head of an Oirat ruling family, went on to murder Ilkhan Arpa Keun, resulting in the disintegration of Mongol Persia. Since the Oirats were near both the Chagatai Khanate and the Golden Horde, they had strong ties with them, and many Mongol khans had Oirat wives.

After the expulsion of the Yuan dynasty from China, the Oirats reconvened as a loose alliance of the four major western Mongolian tribes (Mongolian: &quot;дөрвөн ойрд&quot;, &quot;дөрвөн ойрaд&quot;). The alliance grew, taking power in the remote region of the Altai Mountains, northwest of Hami oasis. Gradually, they spread eastwards, annexing territories then under the control of the Eastern Mongols. They hoped to reestablish a unified, nomadic rule under their banner of the Four Oirats (the Keraites, Naiman, Barghud, and old Oirats).

The only Borjigid ruling tribe was the Khoshuts; the others&#x27; rulers were not descendants of Genghis. The Ming dynasty of China had helped the Oirats&#x27; rise over the Mongols during the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s reign after 1410, when the Ming defeated the Qubilaid Öljei Temür and the Borjigid power was weakened. The Borjigid Khans were displaced from power by the Oirats (with Ming help), ruling as puppet-khans until the alliance between the Ming and Oirats ended, and the Yongle Emperor launched a campaign against them.

The greatest ruler of the Oirat Confederacy was Esen Taishi; he led the Oirats from 1438 to 1454, a time in which he unified Mongolia (both Inner and Outer) under his puppet-khan Taisun Khan. In 1449, Esen Tayisi and Taisun Khan mobilised their cavalry along the Chinese border and invaded Ming China, defeating and destroying the Ming defences at the Great Wall, along with the reinforcements sent to intercept his cavalry. In the process, the Zhengtong Emperor was captured at Tumu. The following year, Esen returned the emperor after an unsuccessful ransom attempt. After claiming the title of Khan (something which only blood descendants of Genghis Khan could do), Esen was killed; shortly afterwards, Oirat power declined.

From the 14th until the middle of the 18th century, the Oirats were often at war with the Eastern Mongols, but reunited with them during the rule of Dayan Khan and Tümen Zasagt Khan.

===The Khoshut Khanate===

The Oirats converted to Tibetan Buddhism around 1615, and it was not long before they participated in the conflict between the Gelug and Karma Kagyu schools. At the request of the Gelug school, in 1637, Güshi Khan, the leader of the Khoshuts in Koko Nor, defeated Choghtu Khong Tayiji, the Khalkha prince who supported the Karma Kagyu school, and conquered Amdo (present-day Qinghai). The unification of Tibet followed in the early 1640s, with Güshi Khan proclaimed Khan of Tibet by the 5th Dalai Lama and the establishment of the Khoshut Khanate. The title &quot;Dalai Lama&quot; itself was bestowed upon the third lama of the Gelug tulku lineage by Altan Khan (not to be confused with the Altan Khans of the Khalkha), and means, in Mongolian, &quot;Ocean of Wisdom&quot;.

Amdo, meanwhile, became home to the Khoshuts. In 1717, the Dzungars invaded Tibet and killed Lha-bzang Khan (or Khoshut Khan), a grandson of Güshi Khan and the fourth Khan of Tibet, and conquered the Khoshut Khanate.
The Qing Empire defeated the Dzungars in the 1750s and proclaimed rule over the Oirats through a Manchu-Mongol alliance (a series of systematic arranged marriages between princes and princesses of Manchu with those of Khalkha Mongols and Oirat Mongols, which was set up as a royal policy carried out over 300 years), as well as over Khoshut-controlled Tibet.

In 1723 Lobzang Danjin, another descendant of Güshi Khan, took control of Amdo and tried to assume rule over the Khoshut Khanate. He fought against a Manchu-Qing Dynasty army, and was defeated only in the following year and 80,000 people from his tribe were executed by Manchu army due to his &quot;rebellion attempt&quot;. By that period, the Upper Mongolian population reached 200,000 and were mainly under the rule of Khalkha Mongol princes who were in a marital alliance with Manchu royal and noble families. Thus, Amdo fell under Manchu domination.

===The Dzungar Khanate===
The 17th century saw the rise of another Oirat empire in the east, known as the Khanate of Dzungaria, which stretched from the Great Wall of China to present-day eastern Kazakhstan, and from present-day northern Kyrgyzstan to southern Siberia. It was the last empire of nomads, and was ruled by Choros noblemen.

The Transition from Ming to Qing dynasties in China occurred in the mid-17th century, and the Qing sought to protect its northern border by continuing the divide-and-rule policy their Ming predecessors had successfully instituted against the Mongols. The Manchu consolidated their rule over the Eastern Mongols of Manchuria. They then persuaded the Eastern Mongols of Inner Mongolia to submit themselves as vassals. Finally, the Eastern Mongols of Outer Mongolia sought the protection of the Manchu against the Dzungars.

In the 17th century, the Dzungar pioneered the local manifestation of the &#x27;Military Revolution&#x27; in central Eurasia after perfecting a process of manufacturing indigenously created gunpowder weapons. They also created a mixed agro-pastoral economy, as well as complementary mining and manufacturing industries on their lands. Additionally, the Zunghar managed to enact an empire-wide system of laws and policies to boost the use of the Oirat language in the region.

Some scholars estimate that about 80% of the Dzungar population was wiped out by a combination of warfare and disease during the Manchu Qing conquest of Dzungaria in 1755–1757. The Zunghar population reached 600,000 in 1755.

Most of the Choros, Olot, Khoid, Baatud, and Zakhchin Oirats who battled against the Qing were killed by Manchu soldiers and, after the fall of the Dzungar Khanate, became small ethnic groups.

===Kalmyks===

Kalmyks live on the Caspian steppe. Their settlement and relationship with the Caspian steppes has a long history.

In early medieval times, the Mongolic-speaking Elut people established here a powerful khanate of the Avar Elut in the sixth century. The first documented reference to Elut and Yelut (Chinese: 厄魯特, &quot;Èlǔtè&quot;) was in the Onginsk &quot;rune&quot; inscriptions dated in the sixth century.

In early modern times, Kho Orlok, tayishi of the Torghuts, and Dalai Tayishi of Dorbets, led their people (200,000–250,000 people, mainly Torghuts) west to the (Volga River) in 1607 where they established the Kalmyk Khanate. By some accounts this move was precipitated by internal divisions or by the Khoshut tribe; other historians believe it more likely that the migrating clans were seeking pastureland for their herds, scarce in the central Asian highlands. Some of the Khoshut and Ölöt tribes joined the migration almost a century later. The Kalmyk migration had reached as far as the steppes of southeastern Europe by 1630. At the time, that area was inhabited by the Nogai Horde. But under pressure from Kalmyk warriors, the Nogais fled to Crimea and the Kuban River. Many other nomadic peoples in the Eurasian steppes subsequently became vassals of the Kalmyk Khanate, part of which is in the area of present-day Kalmykia.

The Kalmyks became allies of Russia and a treaty to protect southern Russian borders was signed between the Kalmyk Khanate and Russia. Later they became nominal, then full subjects of the Russian Tsar. In 1724 the Kalmyks came under control of Russia. By the early 18th century, there were approximately 300,000–350,000 Kalmyks and 15,000,000 Russians. Russia gradually reduced the autonomy of the Kalmyk Khanate. Policies encouraged establishment of Russian and German settlements on pastures where the Kalmyks formerly roamed and fed their livestock. The Russian Orthodox church, by contrast, pressed Buddhist Kalmyks to adopt Orthodoxy. In January 1771 the oppression of czarist administration forced a larger part of Kalmyks (33,000 households or approximately 170,000 individuals) to migrate to Dzungaria.

200,000 (170,000) Kalmyks began the migration from their pastures on the left bank of the Volga River to Dzungaria, through the territories of their Bashkir and Kazakh enemies. The last Kalmyk khan Ubashi led the migration to restore the Dzungar Khanate and Mongolian independence. As C. D. Barkman notes, &quot;It is quite clear that the Torghuts had not intended to surrender to the Chinese, but had hoped to lead an independent existence in Dzungaria&quot;. Ubashi Khan sent his 30,000 cavalry to the Russo-Turkish War in 1768–1769 to gain weapons before the migration. The Empress Catherine the Great ordered the Russian army, Bashkirs and Kazakhs to exterminate all migrants and Catherine the Great abolished the Kalmyk Khanate.

The Kazakhs attacked them near Balkhash Lake. About 100,000–150,000 Kalmyks who settled on the west bank of the Volga River could not cross the river because the river did not freeze in the winter of 1771 and Catherine the Great executed their influential nobles. After seven months of travel, only one third (66,073) of the original group reached Dzungaria (Balkhash Lake, western border of the Manchu Qing Empire). The Qing Empire resettled the Kalmyks in five different areas to prevent their revolt and several Kalmyk leaders were soon killed by the Manchus. Following the Russian revolution their settlement was accelerated, Buddhism stamped out and herds collectivised.

Kalmykian nationalists and Pan-Mongolists attempted to migrate from Kalmykia to Mongolia in the 1920s when a serious famine gripped Kalmykia. On January 22, 1922, Mongolia proposed to accept the immigration of the Kalmyks but the Russian government refused. Some 71–72,000 (around half of the population) Kalmyks died during the famine. The Kalmyks revolted against Russia in 1926, 1930 and 1942–1943. In March 1927, Soviets deported 20,000 Kalmyks to Siberia, and Karelia. The Kalmyks founded the sovereign Republic of Oirat-Kalmyk on March 22, 1930. The Oirat state had a small army and 200 Kalmyk soldiers defeated a force of 1,700 Soviet soldiers in Durvud province of Kalmykia, but the Oirat state was destroyed by the Soviet Army later that year. The Mongolian government suggested to accept the Mongols of the Soviet Union, including Kalmyks, but the Soviets rejected the proposal.

In 1943, the entire population of 120,000 Kalmyks were deported to Siberia by Stalin, accused of supporting invading Axis armies attacking Stalingrad (Volgograd); a fifth of the population is thought to have perished during and immediately after the deportation. Around half (97–98,000) of the Kalmyk people deported to Siberia died before being allowed to return home in 1957. The government of the Soviet Union forbade teaching the Kalmyk language during the deportation. Mongolian leader Khorloogiin Choibalsan attempted to arrange migration of the deportees to Mongolia and he met them in Siberia during his visit to Russia. Under the Law of the Russian Federation of April 26, 1991 &quot;On Rehabilitation of Exiled Peoples&quot; repressions against Kalmyks and other peoples were qualified as an act of genocide.

According to the Russian 2010 Census there were 176,800 Kalmyks, of whom only 80,546 could speak the Kalmyk language, a serious decline from the level of the 2002 Census, in which the number of speakers was 153,602 (with a total number of 173,996 people). The Soviet 1989 Census showed 156,386 Kalmyk-speakers with a total number of 173,821 Kalmyks.

===Xinjiang Mongols===

The Mongols of Xinjiang form a minority, principally in the northern part of the region, numbering 194,500 in 2010, about 50,000 of which are Dongxiangs. They are primarily descendants of the surviving Torghuts and Khoshuts who returned from Kalmykia, and of the Chakhar stationed there as garrison soldiers in the 18th century. The emperor had sent messages asking the Kalmyks to return, and erected a smaller copy of the Potala in Jehol (&quot;Chengde&quot;), (the country residence of the Manchu Emperors) to mark their arrival. A model copy of that &quot;Little Potala&quot; was made in China for the Swedish explorer Sven Hedin, and was erected at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. It is now in storage in Sweden, where there are plans to re-erect it. Some of the returnees did not come that far and still live, now as Muslims, at the southwestern end of Lake Issyk-kul in present-day Kyrgyzstan.

In addition to exiling Han criminals to Xinjiang to be slaves of the Banner garrisons there, the Qing also practiced reverse exile, exiling Inner Asian (Mongol, Russian and Muslim criminals from Mongolia and Inner Asia) to China proper where they would serve as slaves in Han Banner garrisons in Guangzhou. Russian, Oirats and Muslims (Oros. Ulet. Hoise jergi weilengge niyalma) such as Yakov and Dmitri were exiled to the Han banner garrison in Guangzhou. In the 1780s after the Muslim rebellion in Gansu started by Zhang Wenqing (張文慶) was defeated, Muslims like Ma Jinlu (馬進祿) were exiled to the Han Banner garrison in Guangzhou to become slaves to Han Banner officers. The Qing code regulating Mongols in Mongolia sentenced Mongol criminals to exile and slavery under Han bannermen in Han Banner garrisons in China proper.

===Alasha Mongols===
The region bordering Gansu and west of the Irgay River is called Alxa or Alaša, Alshaa and Mongols who moved there are called Alasha Mongols.

Törbaih Güshi Khan&#x27;s fourth son, Ayush, was opposed to the Khan&#x27;s brother Baibagas. Ayush&#x27;s eldest son is Batur Erkh Jonon Khoroli. After the battle between Galdan Boshigt Khan and Ochirtu Sechen Khan, Batur Erkh Jonon Khoroli moved to Tsaidam with his 10,000 households. The fifth Dalai Lama wanted land for them from the Qing government, thus in 1686, the Emperor permitted them to reside in Alasha.

In 1697, Alasha Mongols were administered in &#x27;khoshuu&#x27; and &#x27;sum&#x27; units. A khoshuu with eight sums was created, Batur Erkh Jonon Khoroli was appointed Beil (prince), and Alasha was thus a &#x27;zasag-khoshuu&#x27;. Alasha was however like an &#x27;aimag&#x27; and never administered under a &#x27;chuulgan&#x27;.

In 1707, when Batur Erkh Jonon Khoroli died, his son Abuu succeeded him. He was in Beijing from his youth, served as bodyguard of the Emperor, and a princess (of the Emperor) was given to him, thus making him a &#x27;Khoshoi Tavnan&#x27;, i.e. Emperor&#x27;s groom. In 1793, Abuu became Jün Wang. There are several thousand Muslim Alasha Mongols.

====Ejine Mongols====

Mongols who lived along the Ejin River (&quot;Ruo Shui&quot;) descended from Rabjur, a grandson of Torghut Ayuka Khan from the Volga River.

In 1698, Rabjur, with his mother, younger sister and 500 people, went to Tibet to pray. While they were returning via Beijing in 1704, the Qing ruler, the Kangxi Emperor, let them stay there for some years and later organized a &#x27;khoshuu&#x27; for them in a place called Sertei, and made Rabjur the governor.

In 1716, the Kangxi Emperor sent him and his people to Hami, near the border of Qing China and the Zunghar Khanate, for intelligence-gathering purposes against the Oirats. When Rabjur died, his eldest son, Denzen, succeeded him. He was afraid of the Zunghar and wanted the Qing government to allow them to move away from the border. They were settled in Dalan Uul–Altan. When Denzen died in 1740, his son Lubsan Darjaa succeeded him and became Beil.

In 1753, they were settled on the banks of the Ejin River and the Ejin River Torghut &#x27;khoshuu&#x27; was thus formed.

==Culture==

==Origins and genetics==

Haplogroup C2*-Star Cluster which was thought to be carried by likely male-line descendants of Genghis Khan and Niruns (original Mongols and descendants of Alan Gua) appears in 1.6% of Oirats.

The Y-chromosome in 426 individuals mainly from three major tribes of the Kalmyks (the Torghut, Dörbet and Khoshut):

C-M48: 38.7

C-M407: 10.8

N1c: 10.1

R2: 7.7

O2: 6.8

C2 (not M407, not M48): 6.6

O1b: 5.2

R1: 4.9

Others: 9.2

Haplogroup C2*-Star Cluster appeared in 2% (3% of Dörbet and 2.7% of the Torghut).

==Tribes==
Sart Kalmyks and Xinjiang Oirats are not Volga Kalmyks or Kalmyks, and the Kalmyks are a subgroup of the Oirats.

<text>Emily Lau Wai-hing, JP (; born 21 January 1952) is a politician in Hong Kong who champions press freedom and human rights. A former journalist, she became the first woman directly elected on the Legislative Council of Hong Kong in the 1991 LegCo elections. She has served as Legislative Councillor for the New Territories East Constituency throughout the 1990s and 2000s until she stepped down in 2016. She was chairperson of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong until 2016.

==Early life==
Lau was born on 21 January 1952 in Hong Kong. In 1948, Lau&#x27;s parents moved from Guangdong to Hong Kong during the Chinese Civil War. In 1962, attended the new English-language Maryknoll Sisters&#x27; School in Happy Valley, where she studied until 1972. When she was in primary school, she was given the English name Emily by her aunt.

== Education ==
In 1976, Lau earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Broadcast Journalism from University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California. She later cited the Watergate scandal and investigative journalism having had a major formative effect on her views on the role and potential of the free press.

==Journalism career==

After returning to Hong Kong, Lau worked between 1976 and 1978 as a reporter for the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, the major English-language newspaper in Hong Kong. She then started doing television journalism when she joined the Television Broadcasts (TVB) and was promoted to senior producer in 1981. She continued her studies in the early 1980s at the London School of Economics and completed an MSc in International Relations in 1982. She held a position as assistant producer at the BBC between 1982 and 1984, while concurrently working as the London correspondent of Hong Kong TVB News.

It was at this time that the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the United Kingdom discussed the fate of Hong Kong after 1997. She later noted, &quot;My passion for politics began to develop in 1982, when China told Britain that it would impose a settlement on Hong Kong if the two sides could not reach an agreement by 1984. From that moment, politics began to matter.&quot;

Lau returned to Hong Kong as Hong Kong correspondent of the Hong Kong-based &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot; in 1984. The position allowed her access and insights into the politics of the colonial Hong Kong. In 1987 Lau took up a position at the Journalism and Communication Department of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) and subsequently at the Extra-Mural Department of the University of Hong Kong (HKU).

In December 1984, after signing the Sino-British Joint Declaration, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher flew to Hong Kong to give a press conference. Lau questioned Thatcher: &quot;Prime Minister, two days ago you signed an agreement with China promising to deliver over 5 million people into the hands of a communist dictatorship. Is that morally defensible, or is it really true that in international politics the highest form of morality is one&#x27;s own national interest?&quot; Thatcher replied by saying that everyone in Hong Kong was happy with the agreement, and Lau may be a solitary exception.

Lau was also involved with the Hong Kong Journalists Association during this period, serving first as an executive committee member, then vice-chair and finally chairperson from 1989 to 1991.

==Legislative Councillor==
===Last years of the colonial period===
When the direct elections for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) were first introduced in the 1991 elections, Lau resigned from her posts and ran for office in the New Territories East geographical constituency (GC). She campaigned for five months portraying herself as a new breed of politician in Hong Kong, appealing to a broad section of the Hong Kong population. The elections saw a liberal landslide victory and she became the first woman elected in direct elections, together with her fellow pro-democracy politicians of the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK). Their success was in part due to the fear of Communist China by the Hong Kong population after the Tiananmen massacre of early June 1989.

In this period, Lau became a household name in Hong Kong politics and the legislator came to be known as both a champion of her constituents and a thorn in the side of the Hong Kong administration. She was equally a critic of Britain and Beijing. The last British Governor Chris Patten aimed at a faster pace of democratisation. Governor Patten carried out the reform packages which extended voting rights to millions of people in the revised functional constituency indirect elections. The reform packages were ferociously criticised by the Beijing government for violating the Sino-British agreements. During the reform packages discussions, Lau proposed a private member&#x27;s bill which would have allowed all 60 Legislative Council seats to be directly elected in the 1995 election. The bill was beaten by only one vote.

In 1993, Lau tabled a motion to seek assurances of right of abode in Britain for the British National (Overseas) passport holders in case they were expelled from Hong Kong after 1997. The motion was supported by 36 legislators but was rejected by the Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey. In October 1994, Lau led legislators in urging Britain to grant full citizenship to 3.5 million native Hong Kong British Dependent Territories Citizens (BDTC). As part of this action, she led a cross-party delegation of Hong Kong legislators to Britain to lobby government and opposition politicians ahead of the LegCo debate. The five councillors met the British Foreign Secretary and other senior officials, but achieved little.

In the 1995 Legislative Council elections Lau was re-elected in her constituency with 58.51 per cent of votes cast, the highest figure among all of the geographical constituencies. Growing disillusioned with the Democratic Party, the pro-democracy party formed in 1994 to replace the United Democrats of Hong Kong, in August 1996 Lau founded a new political group, The Frontier, which took a more aggressively pro-democracy, pro-human rights and anti-Communist Party stance, with left wing positions on economic matters. Lau became the Convenor of the new party, which managed to obtain five legislators and become the fourth largest political group in the legislature before the handover. Lau remained in the Legislative Council until it was disbanded by the PRC following the handover on 1 July 1997.

Lau also participated in street protests and in December 1996 she scuffled with the riot police outside the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre together with Andrew Cheng and Lee Cheuk-yan, while demonstrating outside the closed-door election for the post-handover Chief executive.
She was therefore arrested with 29 other pro-democracy activists. Over the months leading up to the July 1997 handover, Lau urged the Chief executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa to stand up against Beijing, since his &quot;unreserved support&quot; for the Beijing-hand-picked Provisional Legislative Council resulted in the abolishment or modification of important Hong Kong laws covering human rights and civil liberties. In March of the same year Lau called for the boycott of Hong Kong&#x27;s future first election under PRC rule, condemning the voting system as unfair and the proportional representation as highly favouring pro-Beijing candidates.

===Early post-handover era===
After the handover in 1998 she was required to relinquish her British passport and adopt Chinese citizenship to be eligible in running for the 1998 Hong Kong legislative election. The pro-democracy camp ended up winning 63 per cent of the popular vote and Lau was returned again to the Legislative Council where she remained until her retirement.
Lau led The Frontier to put pressure on the government for an early democratisation of Hong Kong and was an outspoken critic of a number of LedCo motions, especially on the topic of human rights; she was also sceptical of the reliability of the &quot;One country, two systems&quot; principle. Beside pushing for tightened human rights protection, greater efforts on equal opportunities and the establishment of a statutory right to access to information, she advocated for a complete rewrite of the Basic Law (Hong Kong&#x27;s constitutional document) and for democracy in mainland China. In terms of economics policy, she supported legislation on fair trading, opposed the import of foreign labour and called for the introduction of a minimum wage. Lau received the Bruno Kreisky Award for her human rights work in 1998.

In 1998, Lau sued the Hong Kong branch of the Xinhua News Agency over its slow response to her queries for personal information. She lost the case and was ordered by the court to pay legal fees of HK$1.6 million. Claiming that her lawsuit was in the public interest, she attempted to raise funds from the general public to pay for this injunction. By December 2000 she was still $1 million short and the agency (now the Central People&#x27;s Government Liaison Office) applied to the court for her bankruptcy.

In the 2002 Chief executive election, Lau was against supporting an alternative candidate as some pro-democracy allies argued: &quot;As it is not a fair, open and democratic election, we should not participate in it and give it any legitimacy.&quot; Lau co-founded the Coalition Against Second Term (CAST) to draw attention to the flawed process of choosing the Chief executive, the lack of competition and the need for real democracy.

On international issues, Lau is supportive of self-determination for Taiwan. In 2003, she and another legislator, James To of the Democratic Party, attended a seminar entitled &quot;Hong Kong Under One Country, Two Systems&quot; organised by a pro-Taiwan independence group headed by former ROC President Lee Teng-hui. Lau stated that &quot;Taiwan&#x27;s future should be determined by the Taiwan people themselves&quot;. Her subsequent refusal to explicitly recognise Taiwan as a part of the PRC during an interview again drew criticism from more conservative sectors of the Hong Kong society, including attacks from pro-Beijing politician Leung Chun-ying, who became Chief executive in 2012.

Beside her legal problems, Lau has been the victim of several criminal nuisance cases, including telephone nuisance to her office in January and October 2003, and two occasions when food and/or faeces were splashed outside her office in Shatin, in July and September 2003. A woman and an old man were arrested and fined in connection with some of these cases. Most notably, an arson attack against Lau&#x27;s office took place on 21 June 2004. Posters outside her office, about an upcoming rally, were burned. Words were left saying &quot;All Chinese traitors must die.&quot;

She fiercely opposed the controversial national security bill in 2002 and 2003, as it was clashing with requirements of the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23. After the 2003 July 1 march in 2003, she was the second candidate listed on the joint list with other pro-democrats parties in the New Territories East constituency and was elected again in the 2004 Legislative Council elections. She was also nominated chairwoman of the Legislative Council Finance Committee, position that she covered on and off until 2012.

In the Chief executive election held in 2005 after unpopular Tung Chee-hwa stepped down, Lau announced her interest in running for the post, to foster discussions over Hong Kong&#x27;s democratic development. Due to the opposition from secretary-general Andrew To and from other members of The Frontier, Lau ultimately did not run in the election. Democratic Party chairman Lee Wing-tat remained the sole pro-democratic candidate in this election, but he did not manage to secure the threshold of 100 nominations necessary for the job.

===Joining the Democratic Party and 2012 reform package===

At the time of her election to LegCo in 1991, Lau was generally considered to be the most radical legislator in Hong Kong. However over time her radical image was overshadowed by activist Leung Kwok-hung and other radicals and her popular votes continuously declined. In September 2008 LegCo elections Emily Lau was barely re-elected in the New Territories East constituency, obtaining much fewer votes than in past elections. After reviewing the election results, in November 2008 The Frontier decided to merge with the more mainstream Democratic Party and Lau became one of its two vice-chairpersons. After this, her earlier strident stance toward the Beijing government and her fierce opposition to pro-Beijing supporters mellowed somewhat: this was perceived by some in a very negative way.

On 24 May 2010, Emily Lau and Democratic Party chairman Albert Ho, together with veteran Cheung Man-kwong met with Beijing representatives headed by Li Gang, the deputy director of the Liaison Office of the Central People&#x27;s Government in Hong Kong, for negotiations over the 2012 constitutional reform package. This was the first meeting between Democratic Party leaders and senior officials from the Chinese central government since the Tiananmen protests of 1989. In June 2010, as vice-chairperson of the Democratic Party, she voted with her party in favour of the government&#x27;s reform package, which included the party&#x27;s late amendment – accepted by Beijing – to hold a popular vote for five new District Council (second) functional constituencies. 
Lau&#x27;s less radical behaviour in this period, when compared to more radical populist figures Leung Kwok-hung and Wong Yuk-man, led her to become the main target for attacks by Wong and People Power.

===Chairperson of the Democratic Party===
In September 2012, the Democratic Party suffered the worst defeat in the party&#x27;s history in the 2012 Legislative Council election. Chairman Albert Ho resigned as chairman and Lau became acting Chairperson of the party for three months. In the party leadership election on 16 December 2012 she was elected chairperson, narrowly defeating vice-chairman Sin Chung-kai (149 votes to 133), therefore becoming the first female leader of the party since its formation in 1994.

Emily Lau and other Democratic Party members supported the 2014 Hong Kong protests. On 11 December 2014, Lau was arrested by the police with a group of about a hundred demonstrators staging a final sit-in, after a 75-day street occupation. Among these were other prominent democratic legislators including Martin Lee and Alan Leong.

On 14 December 2014, she was re-elected chairperson in the party leadership election, beating three rivals in the party&#x27;s 20-year history.

On 1 January 2016, Emily Lau announced that she would not seek to be elected for an eighth term in the September election, therefore ending her legislator activity after serving for 25 years in the Legislative Council party primary. She participated to the election in the list of her younger colleague Lam Cheuk-ting and helped him get elected with nearly 40,000 votes.

Lau announced her resignation from the party chair post in December 2016 and was succeeded by legislator Wu Chi-wai. She also relinquished all of her party positions in the coming months. After her retirement from the LedCo, she kept working as a television journalist, interviewing several political heavyweights in her shows.

==Reputation==
Lau is considered a politician with strong convictions on the promotion of democratic human rights and equal opportunities in Hong Kong. 
She was labelled by the Hong Kong government as &quot;radical&quot;, &quot;outside mainstream public opinion&quot; and a &quot;solitary exception&quot;. She was among the most popular legislators throughout the 1990s. The last British Governor Chris Patten regarded Lau as a &quot;professional politician, handsome, well informed and dashingly eloquent, who would have got to the top in any Western political system&quot; and an &quot;exponent of the incisive soundbite.&quot;

Since she joined the Democratic Party, her earlier strident stance toward the Beijing government mellowed somewhat. After she met with the mainland officials for negotiations over the 2010 Hong Kong electoral reform and voted with her party in favour of the reforms, she received ferocious attacks from radical democrats for her compromise.

== Personal life ==
In 1983, Lau married John Ball, a British journalist from the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;. The marriage lasted two years. In 1989, Lau remarried to a Hong Kong lawyer, Winston Poon, QC. They met in London during her visit to discuss the Hong Kong Basic Law with the members of Parliament of the United Kingdom. 
In 2006, she changed her marital status to &quot;unmarried&quot; in the Legislative Council office registry.

Stephen Lau Sing-hung, Emily Lau&#x27;s brother, was a Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference Guangzhou committee member in the 1980s, was the chairman of Ernst &amp; Young&#x27;s tax service before he left in 2006 and was chief executive of China Timber Resources Group from 2007 to 2010. 
Despite his sister&#x27;s political stance, he came to notoriety when he filed a claim in the Small Claims Tribunal for HK$314.60 against Occupy Central&#x27;s organiser Benny Tai during the 2014 Hong Kong protests. The claim was filed since he had to spend HK$320 for a taxi ride on 6 October instead of just HK$5.40 for the bus fare from his home in Wong Nai Chung Gap Road to Central, since the occupation movement prevented the normal bus service. Emily Lau said she was not aware of her brother&#x27;s action but insisted that her family did not support Stephen Lau&#x27;s claim.

<text>Lynn Minmay (Japanese: リン・ミンメイ &quot;Rin Minmei&quot;, Chinese: 鈴明美 / 林明美 &quot;Líng Míngměi / Lín Míngměi&quot;) is a fictional anime character from the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise who has been considered the first fictional character to do well as a Japanese idol in the real world music industry. She is also in the &quot;Macross: Flash Back 2012&quot; music video collection. The first &quot;Macross&quot; series and its Minmay character were adapted as the first part of the &quot;Robotech&quot; television series. Minmay is the embodiment of the music that plays a crucial role in setting &quot;Macross&quot; apart; as such, she has become the iconic character of that series.

In &quot;Macross&quot; (and &quot;Robotech&quot;), Minmay is a love interest of the main character, Hikaru Ichijyo (Rick Hunter in Robotech), and becomes an idol singer and film star on board the spacecraft SDF-1 &quot;Macross&quot;. Her songs, which cause confusion amongst alien Zentradi soldiers, play a critical role in Space War I against Boddole Zer&#x27;s Zentradi fleet.

The original Japanese Minmay is voiced by Mari Iijima, who also wrote some of the songs and sang for the series. She became a famous J-pop singer in part due to the success of the series. Iijima has also undertaken to reprise the role in the English dub of the series for ADV. This would be the second time that a key character in an anime series was voiced by the same voice actor in both Japanese and English.

Minmay is of Japanese and Chinese descent. Her father Lynn Paochun (鈴宝雄 &quot;Líng Bǎoxióng&quot;) is Chinese and her mother Shigeyo (しげよ) is Japanese. An English translation of the Chinese characters in Lynn Minmay&#x27;s name is &quot;bright and beautiful bell&quot;. The localizers of &quot;Macross&quot; in Chinese-speaking territories changed the character 鈴 (Líng, &quot;bell&quot;) for her family name to 林 (Lín &quot;grove&quot;). To some extent, the morale raised by Lynn Minmay in Space War I is very reminiscent of Vera Lynn during the Second World War.

==Fictional biography==

Born in Yokohama Chinatown, Japan, Lynn Minmay moved in with her uncle Shaochin (少江) and aunt Feichun (慧中) on South Ataria Island in hopes of finding the path to fulfill her dream of becoming a star. On the day of the Zentradi invasion, she meets Hikaru and a series of events leads to her being swept off on the SDF-1 &quot;Macross&quot; along with the rest of the surviving population from that island. While on the space fortress, Minmay wins the Miss Macross beauty pageant and is propelled into celebrity.
When the &quot;Macross&quot; returns to Earth, she is the only civilian allowed off the space fortress. After her trip home in Japan (where her parents remained), Minmay returned to the fortress with her cousin Lynn Kaifun (and Hikaru&#x27;s competition for her affection) in tow. Her beauty and singing talent also win over several Zentradi spies sent to explore human society, who spread their impressions among their fleetmates, thus unwittingly evoking peace-oriented attitudes among the alien aggressors. Ultimately, Minmay sings the songs that end the first war against the Zentradi.

During the second part of the series, the very fame and success she craved finally left her tired and virtually alone. She tries to run away from her celebrity status and start anew, with a more simple life alongside Hikaru, who is now more confused than ever in defining his feelings for Minmay and Misa Hayase; all of this while new conflicts arise between the human and Zentradi survivors of the first war. At the end of the series both Hikaru and Minmay realize they are very different people, and Minmay accepts that Hikaru belongs with Misa, remaining a friend to the couple afterwards.

In 2012, Minmay sits among the thousands of seats in the empty stadium where her last concert was held. She walks up the stairs to the stage and plays Angel&#x27;s Paints on the piano. As the music starts up again, she sees Hikaru in a pilot suit. He hands her a microphone, right after the costume she wore during the concert appears on her, she is greeted by Misa. Years earlier, Minmay packed her bags for South Ataria Island. Before leaving she saw photos of her and her family on a touchscreen photo frame, and had a minor argument with her parents. After venturing through a busy street, Minmay put her bag down by a wall and saw a poster promoting the SDF-1, now in 2012 she stands with her suitcase in the same location, the poster has been replaced with one promoting the SDF-2 Megaroad-01. Misa has been promoted to the rank of Captain and given command of the SDF-2 while her Husband, Hikaru, pilots the newest variable fighter, the VF-4 Lightning III. Minmay waves goodbye to the crowd as the SDF-2 launches, and the visage of a younger Minmay seeing her current self off appears. The SDF-2 rises above the landscape of Macross City With the approval of Captain Misa Ichijō, Skull Leader Hikaru flies vertically in his VF-4. Many variable fighters and a Nupetiet-Vergnitzs-class Battleship fly together as part of the SDF-2 Megaroad-01&#x27;s fleet past the moon. She embarks on the SDF-2 Megaroad-01 colony ship (along with Misa and Hikaru, who remained as her friends and also boarded the ship), which disappears 4 years later in 2016 during its voyage towards the center of the Milky Way galaxy, becoming a legend in the &quot;Macross&quot; universe since then.

==Additional notes on the character==
Minmay&#x27;s personality is that of any teenage girl, fun-loving, playful, full of dreams and hopes that she may realize some day. After their initial encounter during the start of the Space War I, Hikaru develops a deep infatuation for her that grows on and on throughout the series. But after Minmay wins the Miss Macross contest and becomes a distant pop idol, his feelings for her change, as she becomes too involved not only in the popular culture, but as a symbol of the human struggle against the Zentradi. Minmay also displays insecurity and doubts about her attraction toward Hikaru and her cousin Lynn Kaifun.

In the film &quot;,&quot; Minmay&#x27;s portrayal was a bit different from the first &quot;Macross&quot; series. In the movie&#x27;s story, she was already a popular singer and movie star, and she and Hikaru had never met before until the events that occur in the movie. Hikaru is portrayed as a Valkyrie pilot who is a Minmay fan, and apparently falls for her after their meeting; Minmay, for her part, already tired of living in the eye of the media, initially befriends Hikaru after he saves her life, and she sees him as a friend from the outside of the crazy world of fame she has been living. As the plot evolves, she also begins to fall for him, yet it is too late, as Hikaru realizes he loves Misa, and his fascination for Minmay was just that and nothing more.

Her hit songs include &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s a Pilot,&quot; &quot;Little White Dragon,&quot; and &quot;Do You Remember Love?&quot; The first song that Minmay sings, &quot;Cinderella&quot; in Episode 4, was not written for the show. Instead, the song had been written by Iijima prior to being picked for the role of Minmay. The fact that she was a songwriter was one of the factors that led to her being cast in the film. Coincidentally, the very last song that Minmay would sing in a &quot;Macross&quot; animated production, &quot;An Angel&#x27;s Paints&quot; (天使の絵の具 &quot;Tenshi no Enogu&quot;) from the &quot;Do You Remember Love?&quot; movie and &quot;Flash Back 2012&quot; video, was also written by Iijima.

Macross creators Mikimoto Haruhiko and Kawamori Shoji have stated that Minmay&#x27;s popularity in both sides of the war is partially inspired by the song Lili Marleen, a German love song which was popular on both sides during World War II.

==Legacy==

In the &quot;Macross&quot; world, Minmay continues to be remembered decades after Space War I. Her songs are constantly cherished and she will always be known as the girl who ended a war by singing. In every Macross sequel (even the non-canon &quot;Macross II&quot; OVA and movie), Minmay is referred to either indirectly (through references of her songs) or explicitly.

In &quot;Macross 7&quot;, she became an inspiration to Basara Nekki, who intends to win over his enemies with song. In &quot;Macross 7 Trash&quot;, there is a singing contest called &quot;Voice Minmay 2046&quot; to transform the winner in the new version of Minmay. Likewise, the winner and co-star of the story, Enika Chelini, is a fan of Minmay. In &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; her song &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s a Pilot&quot;, sung by Ranka Lee during a Miss Macross Frontier competition, was referred to as &quot;a legendary song every person here knows&quot;. The final bars of &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s a Pilot&quot; are heard in &quot;Macross Plus&quot; when Myung Fan Lone is taken by old schoolmates to a karaoke lounge.

Ranka Lee can also be seen as the &quot;new&quot; Minmay. Both of them are playful, insecure, young teenage girls who pursue their singing dreams. Minmay and Ranka both have Chinese names and they both worked at the Nyan Nyan restaurant.
In the final episode of &quot;Macross Frontier&quot;, a picture of Minmay can be seen in a locket belonging to a Zentradi mogul called Richard Bilrer.

== Virtual idol ==
In addition to portraying Minmay as a popular singer within her setting, the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise released music under Lynn Minmay&#x27;s name as if she performed it (Mari Ijima voiced Minmay). Haruhiko Mikimoto, who designed Minmay, modeled her after Seiko Matsuda, a Japanese idol who was popular at the time and known for affecting a cutesy persona. Minmay&#x27;s most popular release was the 1984 &quot;Do You Remember Love?&quot; (the theme song of the movie &quot;&quot;), which reached number seven on the Oricon music chart. Communication studies scholar Jiahui Liu called Minmay the &quot;first virtual idol&quot;. According to &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer Richard Eisenbeis, Minmay was the &quot;first fictional singer to garner major real world success&quot;.

<text>Jared is a given name of Biblical derivation.

==Origin==
In the Book of Genesis, the biblical patriarch Jared () was the sixth in the ten pre-flood generations between Adam and Noah; he was the son of Mahalaleel and the father of Enoch, and lived 962 years (Genesis 5:18). The biblical text in the Book of Jubilees implicitly etymologizes the name as derived from the root YRD &quot;descend&quot; because in his days, &quot;the angels of the Lord &quot;descended&quot; to earth&quot;. Alternative suggestions for the name&#x27;s etymology include words for &quot;rose&quot;, &quot;servant&quot; and &quot;one who rules&quot;.

Yared (505–571), a namesake, was an Ethiopian monk who introduced the concept of sacred music to Ethiopian Orthodox services. He is regarded as a saint of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, with a feast day of 11 Genbot (May 19).

In some English-speaking countries, Jared is a common Jewish and Christian first name.

<doc id="423476" wikidata="Q2153520" url="?curid=423476" title="Ring Tone Text Transfer Language">
<text>Ring Tone Text Transfer Language (RTTTL) is a text-based format that was developed by Nokia to be used to transfer ringtones to Nokia cellphones.

The RTTTL format is a string divided into three sections: name, default value, and data.

The &quot;name&quot; section consists of a string describing the name of the ringtone. It can be no longer than 10 characters, and cannot contain a colon &quot;:&quot; character. (However, since the Smart Messaging specification allows names up to 15 characters in length, some applications processing RTTTL also do so.)

The &quot;default value&quot; section is a set of values separated by commas, where each value contains a key and a value separated by an &quot;=&quot; character, which describes certain defaults which should be adhered to during the execution of the ringtone. Possible names are
* d - duration
* o - octave
* b - beat, tempo

The &quot;data&quot; section consists of a set of character strings separated by commas, where each string contains a &quot;duration&quot;, &quot;pitch&quot;, &quot;octave&quot; and optional &quot;dotting&quot; (which increases the duration of the note by one half).

The format of RTTTL notation is similar to the Music Macro Language found in BASIC implementations present on many early microcomputers.

==Technical specification==
To be recognized by ringtone programs, an RTTTL/Nokring format ringtone must contain three specific elements: name, settings, and notes.

For example, here is the RTTTL ringtone for Haunted House:

codice_1

The three parts are separated by a colon.

* Part 1: name of the ringtone (here: &quot;HauntHouse&quot;), a string of characters represents the name of the ringtone
* Part 2: settings (here: d=4,o=5,b=108), where &quot;d=&quot; is the default duration of a note. In this case, the &quot;4&quot; means that each note with no duration specifier (see below) is by default considered a quarter note. &quot;8&quot; would mean an eighth note, and so on. Accordingly, &quot;o=&quot; is the default octave. There are four octaves in the Nokring/RTTTL format. And &quot;b=&quot; is the tempo, in &quot;beats per minute&quot;.
* Part 3: the notes. Each note is separated by a comma and includes, in sequence: a duration specifier, a standard music note, either a, b, c, d, e, f or g, and an octave specifier, as in scientific pitch notation. If no duration or octave specifier are present, the default applies.

=== Durations ===

Standard musical durations are denoted by the following notations:
* 1 - whole note
* 2 - half note
* 4 - quarter note
* 8 - eighth note
* 16 - sixteenth note
* 32 - thirty-second note

Dotted rhythm patterns can be formed by appending a period (&quot;.&quot;) character to the end of a duration/beat/octave element.

=== Pitch ===

* P - rest or pause
* A - A
* A# - A♯ / B♭
* B - B / C♭
* C - C 
* C# - C♯ / D♭
* D - D
* D# - D♯ / E♭
* E - E / F♭
* F - F / E♯
* F# - F♯ / G♭
* G - G
* G# - G♯ / A♭

=== Octave ===

The RTTTL format allows octaves starting from the A below middle C and going up four octaves. This corresponds with the inability of cellphones to reproduce certain tones audibly. These octaves are numbered from lowest pitch to highest pitch from 4 to 7.

The octave should be left out of the notation in the case of a rest or pause in the pattern.

== Example ==

An example of the RTTTL format would be
 fifth:d=4,o=5,b=63:8P,8G5,8G5,8G5,2D#5

<doc id="423479" wikidata="Q28107872" url="?curid=423479" title="Yellow-tailed black cockatoo">
<text>The yellow-tailed black cockatoo (Zanda funerea) is a large cockatoo native to the south-east of Australia measuring in length. It has a short crest on the top of its head. Its plumage is mostly brownish black and it has prominent yellow cheek patches and a yellow tail band. The body feathers are edged with yellow giving a scalloped appearance. The adult male has a black beak and pinkish-red eye-rings, and the female has a bone-coloured beak and grey eye-rings. In flight, yellow-tailed black cockatoos flap deeply and slowly, with a peculiar heavy fluid motion. Their loud, wailing calls carry for long distances. The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is found in temperate forests and forested areas across south and central eastern Queensland to southeastern South Australia, including a very small population persisting in the Eyre Peninsula. Two subspecies are recognised, although Tasmanian and southern mainland populations of the southern subspecies &quot;xanthanotus&quot; may be distinct enough from each other to bring the total to three. Birds of subspecies &quot;funereus&quot; (Queensland to eastern Victoria) have longer wings and tails and darker plumage overall, while those of &quot;xanthanotus&quot; (western Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania) have more prominent scalloping. 
The subspecies &quot;whiteae&quot; is found south of Victoria to the East of South Australia and is smaller in size.

The yellow-tailed black cockatoo&#x27;s diet primarily includes seeds of native and introduced plants while also feeding on wood-boring grubs. They nest in large hollows high in old growth native trees (~ greater than 200 years old), generally &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot;. Although they remain common throughout much of their range, fragmentation of habitat and loss of large trees suitable for nesting has caused population decline in Victoria and South Australia. Furthermore, the species may lose most of its mainland range due to climate change. In some places yellow-tailed black cockatoos appear to have partially adapted to recent human alteration of landscape and they can often be seen in parts of urban Canberra, Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne. The species is not commonly seen in aviculture, especially outside Australia. Like most parrots, it is protected by CITES, an international agreement that makes trade, export, and import of listed wild-caught species illegal.

==Taxonomy and naming==

The yellow-tailed black cockatoo was first described in 1794 by the English naturalist George Shaw as &quot;Psittacus funereus&quot;, its specific name &quot;funereus&quot; relating to its dark and sombre plumage, as if dressed for a funeral. The French zoologist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest reclassified it in the new genus &quot;Calyptorhynchus&quot; in 1826.

The ornithologist John Gould knew the bird as the funereal cockatoo. &quot;Yellow-tailed black cockatoo&quot; has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC). Other common names used include yellow-eared black cockatoo, and &quot;wylah&quot;. &quot;Wy-la&quot; was an aboriginal term from the Hunter Region of New South Wales, while the Dharawal name from the Illawarra region is &quot;Ngaoaraa&quot;. Scientist and cockatoo authority Matt Cameron has proposed dropping the &quot;black&quot; and shortening the name to &quot;yellow-tailed cockatoo&quot;, explaining that shorter names are more widely accepted.

Among the black cockatoos, the two Western Australian white-tailed species (Carnaby&#x27;s and Baudin&#x27;s black cockatoos), together with the yellow-tailed black cockatoo (&quot;Z. funerea&quot;) of eastern Australia, form the genus &quot;Zanda&quot;. The two red-tailed species, red-tailed black cockatoo (&quot;C. banksii&quot;) and glossy black cockatoo (&quot;C. lathami&quot;), form the genus &quot;Calyptorhynchus&quot;. The three species of &quot;Zanda&quot; were formerly included in &quot;Calyptorhynchus&quot; (and still are by some authorities), but are now widely placed in a genus of their own due to a deep genetic divergence between the two groups. The two genera differ in tail color, head pattern, juvenile food begging calls and the degree of sexual dimorphism. Males and females of &quot;Calyptorhynchus sensu stricto&quot; differ markedly in appearance, whereas those of &quot;Zanda&quot; have similar plumage.

The three species of the genus &quot;Zanda&quot; have been variously considered as two, then as a single species for many years. In a 1979 paper, Australian ornithologist Denis Saunders highlighted the similarity between the short-billed and the southern race &quot;xanthanota&quot; of the yellow-tailed and treated them as a single species, with the long-billed as a distinct species. He proposed that Western Australia had been colonised on two separate occasions, once by a common ancestor of all three forms (which became the long-billed black cockatoo), and later by what has become the short-billed black cockatoo. However, an analysis of protein allozymes published in 1984 revealed the two Western Australian forms to be more closely related to each other than to the yellow-tailed, and the consensus since then has been to treat them as three separate species.

Within the species, two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;Z. f. funerea&quot;, the nominate form, is known as the eastern yellow-tailed black cockatoo. It is found from the Berserker Range in Central Queensland, south through New South Wales, and into eastern Victoria. It is distinguished by its overall larger size, longer tail and wings, and larger bill and claws.
* &quot;Z. f. xanthanota&quot;, known as the southern yellow-tailed black cockatoo, is found in western Victoria, southeastern South Australia, the islands of Bass Strait, and Tasmania. Gould described it in 1838 and later changed his spelling to &quot;xanthonotus&quot;. However, the first name was recognised as taking precedence under ICZN naming rules and its spelling preserved. Saunders reported in 1979 that male birds from Tasmania had wider bills than their mainland relatives, and that Tasmanian female birds were larger than males. However, this observation has yet to be replicated and most authorities only recognise two subspecies. If a third subspecies is recognised, the southern mainland subspecies would be named &quot;whiteae&quot;, having been named so by Gregory Mathews in 1912, and the name &quot;xanthanotus&quot;, originally applied to a Tasmanian specimen, would be restricted to the Tasmanian population.

==Description==

The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is in length and 750–900 grams in weight. It has a short mobile crest on the top of its head, and the plumage is mostly brownish-black with paler feather-margins in the neck, nape, and wings, and pale yellow bands in the tail feathers. The tails of birds of subspecies &quot;funereus&quot; measure around , with an average tail length longer than &quot;xanthanotus&quot;. Male &quot;funereus&quot; birds weigh on average around and females weigh about . Birds of the &quot;xanthanotus&quot; race on the mainland average heavier than the Tasmanian birds; the males on the mainland weigh on average around 630 g and females , while those on Tasmania average 583 and respectively. Both mainland and Tasmanian birds of the &quot;xanthanotus&quot; race average about in tail length. The plumage is a more solid brown-black in the eastern subspecies, while the southern race has more pronounced yellow scalloping on the underparts.

The male yellow-tailed black cockatoo has a black bill, a dull yellow patch behind each eye, and pinkish or reddish eye-rings. The female has grey eye-rings, a horn-coloured bill, and brighter and more clearly defined yellow cheek-patches. Immature birds have duller plumage overall, a horn-coloured bill, and grey eye-rings; The upper beak of the immature male darkens to black by two years of age, commencing at the base of the bill and spreading over ten weeks. The lower beak blackens later by four years of age. The elongated bill has a pointed maxilla (upper beak), suited to digging out grubs from tree branches and trunks. Records of the timing of the eye ring changing from grey to pink in male birds are sparse, but have been recorded anywhere from one to four years of age. Australian farmer and amateur ornithologist John Courtney proposed that the similarity between juvenile and female eye rings prevented adult males becoming aggressive to younger birds. He also observed the eye rings to flush brighter in aggressive males. Moulting appears to take place in stages over the course of a year, and is poorly understood.

The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is distinguished from other dark-plumaged birds by its yellow tail and ear markings, and its contact call. Parts of its range overlap with the ranges of two cockatoo species that have red tail banding, the red-tailed cockatoo and the glossy black cockatoo. Crow species may appear similar when seen flying at a distance; however, crows have shorter tails, a quicker wing beat, and different calls.

An all-yellow bird lacking black pigment was recorded in Wauchope, New South Wales, in December 1996, and it remained part of the local group of cockatoos for four years. Birds with part-yellow plumage have been recorded from different areas in Victoria. Another all-yellow bird was discovered in 2024 and is housed at the Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary.

==Distribution and habitat==
The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is found up to above sea level over southeastern Australia including the island of Tasmania and the islands of the Bass Strait (King, Flinders, Cape Barren islands), and also on Kangaroo Island. On Tasmania and the islands of the Bass Strait it is the only native black-coloured cockatoo. On the mainland, it is found from the vicinity of Gin Gin and Gympie in south and central eastern Queensland, south through New South Wales, where it occurs along the Great Dividing Range and to the coast, and into and across most of Victoria bar the northern and northwestern corner, to the Coorong and Mount Lofty Ranges in southeastern South Australia. A tiny population numbering 30 to 40 birds inhabits the Eyre Peninsula. There they are found in sugar gum (&quot;Eucalyptus cladocalyx&quot;) woodland in the lower peninsula and migrate to the mallee areas in the northern peninsula after breeding. There is evidence that birds on the New South Wales south coast move from elevated areas to lower lying areas towards the coast in winter. They are generally common or locally very common in a wide range of habits, although they tend to be locally rare at the limits of their range. Their breeding range is restricted to areas with large old trees.

The birds prefers native temperate forests, while also being ubiquitous in pine plantations, and occasionally in urban areas, as long as there is a plentiful food supply. They have also spread to parts of suburban Sydney, particularly on or near golf courses, pine plantations and parks, such as Centennial Park in the eastern suburbs. It is unclear whether this is adaptive or because of loss of habitat elsewhere. In urban Melbourne, they have been recorded at Yarra Bend Park. The &quot;Black Saturday bushfires&quot; of 2009 appear to have caused sufficient loss of their natural habitat for them to have been sighted in other parts of the urban areas of Melbourne as well. Furthermore, climate change is predicted to cause a major loss of habitat on Australian mainland.
They are also found along the Mornington peninsula.

==Ecology and behaviour==

Yellow-tailed black cockatoos are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and are often heard before being seen. They make long journeys by flying at a considerable height while calling to each other, and they are often seen flying high overhead in pairs, or trios comprising a pair and their young, or small groups. Outside of the breeding season in autumn or winter they may coalesce into flocks of a hundred birds or more, while family interactions between pairs or trios are maintained. They are generally wary birds, although they can be less shy in urban and suburban areas. They generally keep to trees, only coming to ground level to inspect fallen pine or &quot;Banksia&quot; cones or to drink. Flight is fluid and has been described as &quot;lazy&quot;, with deep, slow wingbeats.

Tall eucalypts that are emergent over other trees in wooded areas are selected for roosting sites. It is here that the cockatoos rest for the night, and also rest to shelter from the heat of the day. They often socialise before dusk, engaging in preening, feeding young, and flying acrobatically. Flocks will return to roost earlier in bad weather.

The usual call is a high-pitched wailing contact call, &quot;kee-ow … kee-ow … kee-ow&quot;, made while flying or roosting, and can be heard from afar. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call. They also make a soft, chuckling call when searching for cossid moth larvae. Adults are normally quiet when feeding, while juveniles make frequent noisy begging calls. The superb lyrebird can mimic the adult yellow-tailed black cockatoo&#x27;s contact call with some success.

===Breeding===

The breeding season varies according to latitude, taking place from April to July in Queensland, January to May in northern New South Wales, December to February in southern New South Wales, and October to February in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The male yellow-tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up his crest and spreading his tail feathers to display his yellow plumage. Softly growling, he approaches the female and bows to her three or four times. His eye ring may also flush a deeper pink. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees, generally eucalypts, which may be living or dead. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. A 1994 study of nesting sites in &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; forest in the Strzelecki Ranges in eastern Victoria found the average age of trees used for hollows by the yellow-tailed black cockatoo to be 228 years. The authors noted that the proposed 80–150 year rotation time for managed forests would impact on the numbers of suitable trees.

Hollows can be deep and wide, with a base of woodchips. A chance felling of a eucalypt known to have been used as a nesting tree near Scottsdale in northeastern Tasmania allowed accurate measurements to be made, yielding a hollow measuring high by wide at the mouth, and at least deep, in a tree which measured in diameter below the hollow. Both the male and female prepare the hollow for breeding, which involves peeling or scraping off wood shavings from the inside the hollow to prepare bedding for the eggs. Gum leaves are occasionally added as well. The clutch consists of one or two white lustreless rounded oval eggs which may have the occasional lime nodule. The first egg averages around 47 or 48 mm long and 37 mm in diameter (2 × 1.4 in). The second egg is around 2 mm smaller all over and is laid two to seven days later. The female incubates the eggs alone and begins after the completion of laying. She enters the hollow feet first, and is visited by the male who brings food two to four times a day. Later both parents help to raise the chicks. The second chick is neglected and usually perishes in infancy. Information on the breeding of birds in the wild is lacking; however, the incubation period in captivity is 28–31 days. Newly hatched chicks are covered with yellow down and have pink beaks that fade to a greyish white by the time of fledging. Chicks fledge from the nest three months after hatching, and remain in the company of their parents until the next breeding season.
Like other cockatoos, this species is long-lived. A pair of yellow-tailed black cockatoos at Rotterdam Zoo stopped breeding when they were 41 and 37 years of age, but still showed signs of close bonding. Birds appear to reach sexual maturity between four and six years of age; this is the age range of breeding recorded in captivity.

===Feeding===

The diet of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is varied and available from a range of habitats within its distribution, which reduces their vulnerability to degradation or change in habitat. Much of the diet comprises seeds of native trees, particularly she-oaks (&quot;Allocasuarina&quot; and &quot;Casuarina&quot;, including &quot;A. torulosa&quot; and &quot;A. verticillata&quot;), but also &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; (including &quot;E. maculata&quot; flowers and &quot;E. nitida&quot; seeds), &quot;Acacia&quot; (including gum exudate and galls), &quot;Banksia&quot; (including the green seed pods and seeds of &quot;B. serrata&quot;, &quot;B. integrifolia&quot;, and &quot;B. marginata&quot;), and &quot;Hakea&quot; species (including &quot;H. gibbosa&quot;, &quot;H. rugosa&quot;, &quot;H. nodosa&quot;, &quot;H. sericea&quot;, &quot;H. cycloptera&quot;, and &quot;H. dactyloides&quot;). They are also partial to pine cones in plantations of the introduced &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; and to other introduced trees, including &quot;Cupressus torulosa&quot;, &quot;Betula pendula&quot; and the buds of elm &quot;Ulmus&quot; species. In the Eyre Peninsula, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo has become dependent on the introduced Aleppo pine (&quot;Pinus halepensis&quot;), alongside native species. Nectar is also included in the diet such as that from native shrubs including &quot;Grevillea sp.&quot; and &quot;Lambertia formosa&quot;. 
The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is very fond of the larvae of tree-boring beetles, such as the longhorn beetle &quot;Tryphocaria acanthocera&quot;, and cossid moth &quot;Xyleutes boisduvali&quot;. Birds seek them all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. They search out holes and make exploratory bites looking for larvae. If successful, they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood.

A yellow-tailed black cockatoo was observed stripping pieces of bark off the trunk of a dead &quot;Leptospermum&quot; tree in &quot;Acacia melanoxylon&quot; swamp near Togari in northwestern Tasmania. It then scraped a layer of white material about 0.5 mm thick from the inner surface with its beak. This white layer turned out to be hyphomycete fungi and slime mould that grew in the cambium of the bark.

Yellow-tailed black cockatoos have been reported flocking to &quot;Banksia&quot; cones ten days after bushfire as the follicles open. With pine trees, they prefer green cones, nipping them off at the stem and holding in one foot, then systematically lifting each segment and extracting the seed. A cockatoo spends about twenty minutes on each pine cone.

They drink at various places, from stock troughs to puddles, and do so in the early morning or late in the afternoon. Insect larvae and Fabaceae seeds are among food reported to have been fed to young.

===Parasites===
In 2004, a captive yellow-tailed black cockatoo and two free-living tawny frogmouths (&quot;Podargus strigoides&quot;) suffering neurological symptoms were shown to be hosting the rat nematode &quot;Angiostrongylus cantonensis&quot;. They were the first non-mammalian hosts discovered for the organism. A species of feather mite, &quot;Psittophagus calyptorhynchi&quot;, has also been isolated from the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, its only host to date.

==Relationship with humans==

Yellow-tailed black cockatoos can cause damage in pine and &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; plantations by weakening stems through gouging out pieces of wood to extract moth larvae. In places with these gum plantations, the population of the larva of the cossid moth &quot;Xyleutes boisduvali&quot; grows, which then leads to increased predation (and hence tree damage) by cockatoos. Furthermore, plantations generally lack undergrowth which might have prevented cockatoos from damaging younger trees. Yellow-tailed black cockatoos were shot as pests in some districts of New South Wales until the 1940s for this reason. 

Although it is classified as &quot;least concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and not listed nationally as threatened, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is declining in numbers in Victoria and South Australia. This is due to habitat fragmentation and loss of large trees used for breeding hollows, although birds have become more plentiful in the vicinity of pine plantations. It is listed as &quot;vulnerable&quot; in South Australia, due to its decline in the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges, and particularly the perilous status of the small isolated population on the Eyre Peninsula, which has declined sharply since European settlement, probably from loss of suitable habitat. A recovery program was commenced in 1998. Efforts to increase the population include fencing off remnants of native bushland, planting food plants such as &quot;Hakea rugosa&quot;, monitoring breeding, and raising chicks in captivity. As a result, the population has increased from a low of 19–21 individuals in 1998.

This species was seldom seen in captivity before the late 1950s, after which time a large number of wild-caught birds entered the Australian market. Since then, it has become more common, but is still rarely seen outside Australia. Captive yellow-tailed black cockatoos require a large aviary to avoid apathy and poor health. There is some evidence that protein may be more important to them than to other cockatoos, and low protein has been linked with the production of yolkless eggs in captivity. Females in particular enjoy mealworms. They can be placid and tolerate sharing an enclosure with smaller parrots, but do not handle disturbance while breeding. As with other black cockatoos, yellow-tailed black cockatoos are rarely seen in European zoos, since Australia restricted exportation of wildlife in 1959, but birds seized by government agencies in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have been loaned to zoos that are members of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). In 2000, there were pairs of yellow-tailed black cockatoos in Puerto de la Cruz&#x27;s Loro Parque zoo in Spain and in Rotterdam. Like most species of parrot, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.

<doc id="423480" wikidata="Q7246272" url="?curid=423480" title="Privatism">
<text>Privatism is a generic term generally describing any belief that people have a right to the private ownership of certain things. According to different perspectives, it describes also the attitude of people to be concerned only about ideas or facts that affect them as individuals.

There are many degrees of privatism, from the advocacy of limited private property over specific kinds of items (personal property) to the advocacy of unrestricted private property over everything; such as in anarcho-capitalism. Regarding public policy, it gives primacy to the private sector as the central agent for action, necessitates the social and economic benefits for private initiatives and competition, and &quot;legitimizes the public consequences of private action&quot;

== Sociology ==
Privatism is based on the concept of individual sphere of interactions. According to this point of view, collective efforts can not be meaningful by themselves, but they can gain meaning only if considered as a sum of individual activities.

Hence, every single action (economical, social, spiritual and so on) can be seen only as the result of an individual choice. For this reason, privatism is based on the concept of individual consumption. Indeed, the private consumption reflects the singular choice of the consumer that according to his own value and prerogatives decide how to consume its own income.

== Political theory ==
The political ideals of privatism are directly consequent of the interpretation of society as just the sum of individuals that compose it. Indeed, privatism supporters believe that the economic role of the welfare state should be reduced, giving more freedom to consumers and private volunteering organizations to operate inside the economic environment. According to this view, the private allocation of resources would be more efficient and less authoritarian than the one provided by the state.

From this point of view, the formation of common social and political views on various topics, is connected to the free choice of individuals. Moreover, as considered by Jürgen Habermas, their ability to create these opinions would be damaged by the excessive role of the state that would limit the creation of volunteering and private societies and so the social and political debate inside a society.

One of the main examples of privatism-driven action in politics, can be represented by the action of Margaret Thatcher towards the British welfare state, that during the 80’s was deeply defunded and reduced of importance.

===Left-wing criticism===
In general, &quot;privatism&quot; is used in the context of left-wing politics to distinguish ideologies which support private ownership of an economy&#x27;s means of production and those who desire abolishing it in favour of either collective ownership or common ownership. The term is not held as being synonymous with capitalism, however, as the capitalist mode of production is generally understood to be characterized by attributes beyond the private ownership of the means of production.

According to an interpretation given by George Lipsitz, privatism needs to be considered hostile towards social life of a community, because it results in segregation and extreme inequalities. Moreover, in his perspective, privatism supporters tend to be less involved in social life leading to severe consequences on the social environment.

<doc id="423488" wikidata="Q1392178" url="?curid=423488" title="Glenn McGrath">
<text>Glenn Donald McGrath (; born 9 February 1970) is an Australian former international cricketer whose career spanned 14 years. He was a fast-medium pace bowler and is considered one of the greatest bowlers of all time along with the title of most accurate pace bowler of all time and a leading contributor to Australia&#x27;s domination of world cricket from the mid-1990s to the late 2000s. McGrath was a member of the Australian team that won three consecutive World Cup trophies in a row, winning the 1999 Cricket World Cup, the 2003 Cricket World Cup, and the 2007 Cricket World Cup. In the 2003 final, he took the winning wicket of Zaheer Khan. McGrath was also a member of the team that won the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy.

Known throughout his career for maintaining an accurate line and length, McGrath displayed a consistency that enabled him to be one of the most economical and successful fast bowlers of his time. In terms of total career Test wickets taken by fast bowlers, McGrath is the third-most successful of all time behind James Anderson and Stuart Broad. On the list of all Test bowlers, he is sixth, and no bowler has taken more wickets at a lower average. He has also taken the seventh-highest number of one day international wickets (381) and holds the record for most wickets (71) in the Cricket World Cup. McGrath announced his retirement from Test cricket on 23 December 2006, with his Test career coming to an end after the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney in January 2007, while the 2007 World Cup, which marked the end of his one-day career, saw him win the man-of-the-tournament award for his outstanding bowling, which was instrumental in Australia winning the tournament.

McGrath later played for the Indian Premier League team of the Delhi DareDevils and was one of the competition&#x27;s most economical bowlers during its first season.

McGrath is the director of MRF Pace Foundation, Chennai, replacing Dennis Lillee, who served for 25 years. He currently serves as president of the McGrath Foundation, a breast cancer support and education charity he founded with his late first wife, Jane.

McGrath was honoured during the seventh annual Bradman Awards in Sydney on 1 November 2012. He was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in January 2013.

==Career==
===Early years===
McGrath was born in Dubbo to Beverly and Kevin McGrath. He grew up in Narromine, New South Wales (NSW), where he first played cricket, and his potential was spotted by Doug Walters. He moved to Sydney to play grade cricket for Sutherland and made his debut for NSW during the 1992–93 season. McGrath capped his rapid rise in the next Australian summer with selection in the Test team after only eight first-class matches.

McGrath&#x27;s Test debut was against New Zealand at Perth in 1993–1994. In Australia&#x27;s 1995 Test series victory McGrath took the approach of bouncing the West Indies team, including the bowlers, which had not happened before. In McGrath&#x27;s biography, Ricky Ponting is quoted as saying:

===County cricket in England===
McGrath played for Worcestershire in the 2000 English County Championship, proving both successful on the field and popular with the county&#x27;s supporters. In 14 first-class games he took 80 wickets at 13.21, including an outstanding innings return of 8–41 against Northamptonshire, as well as making his first-ever first-class half-century (55 against Nottinghamshire). He also played a few games for Middlesex in 2004; although accurate, he could manage only nine wickets in four first-class appearances for the county.

===Against England (Ashes 2005 and 2006/07)===
During the first Test at Lord&#x27;s in the 2005 Ashes series McGrath became the fourth bowler in history to take 500 Test wickets with the dismissal of Marcus Trescothick. This wicket was also the start of a productive spell of 5–2 that led to England being bowled out for 155. McGrath took 4–29 in the second innings and was named man of the match in a comprehensive Australian victory.
McGrath trod on a cricket ball and injured his ankle the morning before the start of the second Test at Edgbaston and was unable to play in the match, in which England amassed 407 runs in one day against the McGrath-less bowling attack to win by two runs. He was rushed back when not fully fit for the third Test at Old Trafford, where he earned another five-wicket haul in the second innings of a drawn game, batting in a last-wicket partnership with Brett Lee in the last hour of the Test to deny an English victory. He then missed the fourth Test at Trent Bridge, which England won by three wickets, with an elbow injury. McGrath returned for the final Test at The Oval but he and the rest of the Australian team were unable to force a result and the match was drawn, giving England the series win. McGrath&#x27;s injury problems are seen as a key factor in England regaining the Ashes, as their victories came in matches in which he was absent.

Australia hosted England in the 2006–07 Ashes series and regained the Ashes, beating England 5–0, only the second 5–0 series whitewash in Ashes history (the first time was by the Australian team during the 1920–1921 Ashes Series, and the later 2013–14 Ashes series). Having taken a break from cricket since April 2006, McGrath used the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy to reclaim his spot in Australia&#x27;s Test XI. He took a six-wicket haul in his comeback innings in the first Test at the Gabba to set the tone for the rest of the series, with Australia winning back the Ashes in a record-breaking 15 days of play. McGrath took 21 wickets in the series at an average of 23.90, and scored 10 runs and took a catch in what would be his final Test series.

In his biography McGrath wrote:
===Retirement===

On 23 December 2006, McGrath announced his retirement from Tests. His last Test was the fifth Ashes Test against England in Sydney in January 2007, where he took a wicket with the last ball of his Test career. He retired from all forms of international cricket following the successful 2007 Cricket World Cup, at which he became the leading wicket taker in the history of the World Cup, while also being the tournament&#x27;s top wicket taker with 26 and being named player of the tournament. He was also named in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; by ESPNcricinfo for the 2007 World Cup. His spell of 3–18 against South Africa was named as the fifth-best ODI bowling performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo voters.

===Indian Premier League===
McGrath was signed by the Delhi DareDevils for the 2008 Indian Premier League, the first season of the Indian Premier League. He played in 14 matches for the side and was the team&#x27;s most economic bowler during the competition. He was re-signed for the 2009 competition but did not play a match. After playing twice for Delhi in the 2009 Champions League Twenty20, in January 2010 the franchise announced that it had bought out the remaining year of McGrath&#x27;s contract, effectively bringing his cricketing career to an end.

==Playing style==
===Bowling===

McGrath&#x27;s bowling was not of express pace. Rather, he relied on unerring accuracy and subtle seam movement, which he derived from his high wrist action and lengthy follow-through. His height (195 cm), combined with a high arm action, allowed him to extract extra bounce, which often surprised batsmen. In the later years of his career he developed as a swing bowler.

His uncomplicated method and natural physical fitness were significant factors in the longevity of McGrath&#x27;s career. In 2004, he became the first Australian fast bowler to play 100 Tests. In the first innings of the ICC Super Series Test match in 2005, McGrath passed Courtney Walsh to become the greatest wicket-taker among fast bowlers in Test history.
McGrath was regarded as one of the best fast bowlers in the world and has had success against every opposition team, in both Test and one-day cricket. He deliberately (and publicly) targeted the opposition&#x27;s best batsmen prior to a series in an attempt to distract them, a ploy that regularly worked. At the beginning of the Frank Worrell series against the West Indies he stated in interviews before the match that he would dismiss Sherwin Campbell for his 299th wicket, then remove star batsman Brian Lara for his 300th wicket the very next ball. This happened as planned, and he followed this with the dismissal of captain Jimmy Adams to complete a memorable hat-trick. The targeting of opposition batsmen was generally successful; he dismissed Mike Atherton of England 19 times—the most times any batsman has been dismissed by one bowler in cricket history. On the other hand, he targeted Michael Vaughan prior to the 2002/03 Ashes series in Australia, with Vaughan going on to score three centuries at an average greater than 60. He targeted Andrew Strauss in the 2005 series in England, who went on to score two centuries.

He also tended to engage in sledging of opposition batsmen and teams, though it did not always pay off. Before the 2005 Ashes series he predicted a 5–0 whitewash for Australia, and even said that if England won the Ashes he would return to Australia by boat, but England prevailed 2–1. However, this did not dissuade him from making a similar 5–0 prediction for the next Ashes series, in Australia in 2006/07, which turned out to be true. He finished his career as the most successful Test fast bowler and third-highest Test wicket taker.

===Fielding===

McGrath was not known as a competent outfielder but he had a strong and accurate throwing arm; while not known for his athleticism, he took an exceptional outfield catch on one memorable occasion in 2002 at the Adelaide Oval against England, dismissing English batsman Michael Vaughan from the bowling of Shane Warne, running many metres before leaping into the air and catching the ball with arms outstretched and body horizontal. His captain, Steve Waugh, described the famous catch as &quot;a miracle&quot; and &quot;one of the great catches in history&quot;.

===Batting===

McGrath&#x27;s batting prowess, in the early phases of his career, was poor; in fact, he scored first-ball ducks (zero runs) on both his Test and One-Day International debuts, and his batting average hovered below 4 for the first few years of his career. Years of patient tutelage from captain and friend Steve Waugh improved this aspect of his game to the point where he scored a Test half-century, which came on 20 November 2004 at the Gabba. His final score in that innings was 61, sharing a last wicket stand of 114 with Jason Gillespie (54*) to hilarity and the acclaim of their team-mates. Nevertheless, McGrath was, for the duration of his career, regarded as a batting &#x27;bunny&#x27;, although he pushed his average above 7.00 runs/dismissal by the end of his career. In the first World Cricket Tsunami Appeal charity match, he was promoted to bat at number 6 ahead of specialist batsmen Stephen Fleming and Matthew Hayden, but was dismissed first ball trying to slog Muttiah Muralitharan. Towards the end of his international career McGrath, while not scoring many runs himself, became rather more difficult for opposing bowlers to dismiss, being dismissed only once during the 2005 Ashes series. With a contribution of 11 runs in the first innings of the MCG 2005 Boxing Day Test versus South Africa, he stood his ground for 53 deliveries, helping Michael Hussey push the Australian tail to a record tenth-wicket stand against South Africa of 107 runs.

==Career best performances==
==Personal life==

Glenn&#x27;s first wife, Jane Louise (née Steele), was born in the United Kingdom and had worked as a flight attendant before their marriage. Glenn and Jane met at a Hong Kong nightclub called &quot;Joe Bananas&quot; in 1995, and married in 1999. They had two children. Jane McGrath fought recurrent battles with metastatic breast cancer, having been first diagnosed in 1997. On 26 January 2008 (Australia Day) Glenn and Jane McGrath were both made Members of the Order of Australia. Jane McGrath died, aged 42, on 22 June 2008 from complications following cancer surgery.

Glenn McGrath met Sara Leonardi, an interior designer, during the 2009 Indian Premier League. They married at home in Cronulla on 18 November 2010. In April 2011 McGrath put his home on the market for $6 million. Their daughter was born in 2015.

In 2015 McGrath received widespread criticism when it was revealed he had killed a variety of animals during a hunting safari in South Africa. McGrath told &quot;Australian Shooter&quot; magazine that &quot;I&#x27;m keen to get into trophy hunting, no animal in particular, but a big safari in Africa would be great.&quot; Photographs of McGrath subsequently appeared on the website of Chipitani Safaris, a game park, showing him crouched beside what looked to be a dead buffalo, two hyenas and the tusks of an elephant. He subsequently expressed his regret.

McGrath identifies as a supporter of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in the NRL

==McGrath Foundation==
In 2002 Glenn and Jane founded the McGrath Foundation, a breast cancer support and education charity in Australia, which raises money to fund McGrath Breast Care Nurses in communities right across Australia and increase breast cancer awareness in young women. Since 2007, the third day of the first Test held in Sydney Cricket Ground is named Jane McGrath Day, even if the day is washed out. Following the death of Jane in June 2008, Glenn accepted the voluntary role of chairman of the Board of the McGrath Foundation, and he participates in many activities in support of the Foundation to ensure the fulfilment of its vision. As of April 2016, the McGrath Foundation has placed 110 McGrath Breast Care Nurses around Australia, who have helped support more than 33,000 Australian families.

On 29 December 2018, Ruth Strauss died after a battle with a rare form of lung cancer. In the wake of Ruth&#x27;s death, former Ashes adversary Andrew Strauss reached out to McGrath who later helped Strauss to found the Ruth Strauss Foundation and secured Day 2 of the Lord&#x27;s Test as a similar partner event ahead of the 2019 Ashes.

==Honours==

In 2001, McGrath was one of just twenty-one Australian athletes inducted into the Australian Institute of Sport &quot;Best of the Best&quot; list.

He was awarded the Allan Border Medal and the Men&#x27;s Test Player of the Year by CA in 2000. He was also awarded the Men&#x27;s ODI Player of the Year in 2001.

McGrath was named a Member of the Order of Australia on 26 January (Australia Day) in 2008 for &quot;service to cricket as a player&quot;, and along with his wife for &quot;service to the community through the establishment of the McGrath Foundation.&quot; In 2008 McGrath was named the NSW Australian of the Year.

McGrath was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2011, and the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in January 2013. He was also inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2013.

He was named as a bowler in Australia&#x27;s &quot;greatest-ever ODI team&quot;.
In a fan poll conducted by the CA in 2017, he was named in the country&#x27;s best Ashes XI in the last 40 years.

A statue of McGrath by artist Brett &quot;Mon&quot; Garling was installed at McGrath&#x27;s home town of Narromine in 2009.

McGrath was promoted to Officer of the Order of Australia in the 2024 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours List.

==Records==

McGrath was twice involved in tenth wicket partnerships which added 100 runs or more, a record matched only by New Zealand batsman Nathan Astle.

At the time of his retirement, McGrath&#x27;s 7 for 15 against Namibia were the best bowling figures in a World Cup match, and the second best in all ODIs. He also held the record for the most wickets in an edition of the World Cup (26 in 2007) until this was broken by Mitchell Starc in 2019.

After his dismissal for a duck in the fourth test of the 2006–2007 Ashes series, McGrath claimed the record of having scored more ducks in Test cricket than any other Australian cricketer (35 – one more than Shane Warne).

McGrath held the record for dismissing the most batsmen for ducks in Test cricket (104), until it was surpassed by James Anderson in 2021.

<text>Say&#x27;s phoebe (Sayornis saya) is a passerine bird in the tyrant flycatcher family, Tyrannidae. A common bird across western North America, it prefers dry, desolate areas. It was named for Thomas Say, an American naturalist.

==Taxonomy==
Say&#x27;s phoebe was formally described in 1825 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte from a specimen collected near Pueblo, Colorado. He coined the binomial name &quot;Muscicapa saya&quot; where the specific epithet was chosen to honour the American naturalist Thomas Say. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Sayornis&quot; that was introduced by Bonaparte in 1854.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;S. s. saya&quot; (Bonaparte, 1825) – Alaska, west Canada, west USA and south Mexico
* &quot;S. s. quiescens&quot; Grinnell, 1926 – Baja California (northwest Mexico)

==Description==

Say&#x27;s phoebe is a barrel-chested bird with a squared-off head. It is gray-brown above with a black tail and buffy cinnamon below, becoming more orange around the vent. The tail is long and the primaries end just past the rump on resting birds. The wings seem pale in flight and resemble a female mountain bluebird. The juvenile is similar to adult, but has buffy orange to whitish wingbars and a yellow gape. The adult bird is long, has a wingspan of and weighs 

==Distribution and habitat==
They are found year-round from western Colorado, southwest to southern California, east to the western panhandle of Texas and south through western Mexico. They breed from Alaska south through western and south central Canada, south through North Dakota, the midwest and to New Mexico and westward. They winter in the desert southwest to southern Texas and south through Mexico to northern Central America. During migration these birds can be found thousands of miles out of range. There are regular fall reports in New England, U.S and Nova Scotia, Canada.

These birds prefer dry, desolate, arid landscapes. They can be found on farmland, savanna and open woodlands, usually near water. They tend to be early migrants to the western U.S.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

Say&#x27;s phoebe is similar to the eastern phoebe. It sallies from a perch to catch insects in mid-air. It also hovers American kestrel-like and dips its tail while perched. Say&#x27;s phoebe also likes to feed just above the water&#x27;s surface. They eat insects almost exclusively, but have been known to eat berries.

Say&#x27;s phoebe nest in the typical phoebe fashion. They attach their nests under bridges, canyon walls, wells and abandoned mine shafts. The nest is made by the female and is cup-shaped. It is made of grass, forbs, moss and plant fibers lined with hair and other fine materials. She lays three to seven, but usually four or five, white, mostly unmarked, eggs. Some have red spots. The eggs are roughly .

===Breeding===
Say&#x27;s phoebes have been found to breed anytime between late March and late August. They have a broad range of breeding elevation, including anywhere from 300 to 1800 meters. Their preferred breeding ground is open, arid country. Their breeding grounds are very wide—spanning throughout the western continental North America as far north as arctic Alaska to as far south as central Mexico.

===Food and feeding===
The diet is primarily insects. These include grasshoppers, flies, crickets, beetles and bees. However, it is disputed whether honey bees are actually suitable aspects of their diets. Their techniques for catching prey including taking it midair or pouncing on the insects while they are on the ground. They have also been observed to have consumed small fish. The diets of adult Say&#x27;s phoebes varies from that of nestlings, with the latter consuming a higher share of soft foods.

===Communication===
Like other &quot;Sayornis&quot; species, Say&#x27;s phoebe is known to use &quot;song-like&quot; displays as its main form of communication. Their singing is characterized as having a very loud pitch to begin and then slowly leveling off into a more steady pitch. This initial peak pitch is a distinctive trait to Say&#x27;s phoebe compared to its other &quot;Sayornis&quot; counterparts. They generally use this form of communication to countersing other birds, make its presence known when patrolling its territory, and in during the early stages of mating season. Almost all males do the singing; however, a select few females engage in singing as well. Often times, Say&#x27;s phoebe will sing while hovering over an open field.

<text>The New Lantao Bus Company (1973) Limited, commonly known as New Lantao Bus or NLB, is a franchised bus company operating in Hong Kong. It mainly operates bus routes on Lantau Island.

==History==
On 22 April 1960, Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) started operating a bus route along the South Lantau Road from Mui Wo to Cheung Sha. The route later extended to Shek Pik following the extension of the road. However, this route caused tremendous financial losses due to low demand for bus services on Lantau Island and competition from illegally operated vehicles, leading to the retreat of KMB from the island on 1 November 1965.

After that, the residents of Lantau Island formed three bus companies to take over bus services there. As a solution to vigorous competition between these companies, NLB was formed in 1973 through their merger, and became the third franchised bus company on 1 April 1974.

In January 1992, NLB became a subsidiary of Kwoon Chung Bus Holdings.

NLB&#x27;s franchise was extended on 1 April 1997 to run until 31 March 2007. It was extended again until 1 March 2017. The current franchise runs from 1 March 2017 to 1 March 2027.

Before the construction of Tung Chung New Town, almost all of NLB&#x27;s routes terminated at Mui Wo, a town with ferry services to Hong Kong Island. During that time when there were no major towns on Lantau Island, most of the company&#x27;s routes aimed at connecting the smaller villages around the island to the ferry at Mui Wo. Currently, however, most routes terminate at Tung Chung, where land-based public transport connection to the urban area and Hong Kong International Airport are available. Many of those that formerly terminated at Mui Wo have since been discontinued.

==Coverage==
As at March 2024, it operated 28 franchised routes. In 2023/24 its network carried around 92,000 passengers per day.

The major service area of the company is Lantau Island. New Lantao Bus was the only bus company operating on the island since its formation until 1997, when Tung Chung New Town was built and road connection to the rest of Hong Kong was opened. It continues to be the only bus company serving the southern part of the Island, carrying an average of 25,000 passengers daily in 2002. It operates 16 regular routes, 4 overnight routes, 2 school-day only routes, 4 holiday-only routes and 1 airport route and 1 special route on Lantau Island as of December 2018.

Most of the routes terminate at Mui Wo and Tung Chung, where there are ferries and MTR to connect to other parts of the territory. Some routes are short-haul routes within the Tung Chung new town. NLB operates a holiday route numbered 1R, running from Hung Hom in Kowloon to Ngong Ping with eight departures on Sundays and public holidays.

In 2007, the Hong Kong–Shenzhen Western Corridor opened, providing a fourth road border crossing with mainland China. NLB won the right to operate a cross-border bus route B2, which runs from Yuen Long MTR station to the border checkpoint at Deep Bay. This mark the first time the company operates a route completely outside Lantau Island.

==Fleet==

As of March 2024, the operator owns a fleet of 88 single-decker and 59 double-decker buses.

The current fleet are single-deck buses in the majority with a growing number of double-deck buses including (MAN A95). Most of the single-deck buses operated by New Lantao Bus are German-built MAN buses with local bodywork. Isuzus used to be the major bus before 2009.

<doc id="423504" wikidata="Q1193699" url="?curid=423504" title="Dirichlet boundary condition">
<text>In mathematics, the Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed on an ordinary or partial differential equation, such that the values that the solution takes along the boundary of the domain are fixed. The question of finding solutions to such equations is known as the Dirichlet problem. In the sciences and engineering, a Dirichlet boundary condition may also be referred to as a fixed boundary condition or boundary condition of the first type. It is named after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805–1859).

In finite-element analysis, the &quot;essential&quot; or Dirichlet boundary condition is defined by weighted-integral form of a differential equation. The dependent unknown &quot;u in the same form as the weight function w&quot; appearing in the boundary expression is termed a &quot;primary variable&quot;, and its specification constitutes the &quot;essential&quot; or Dirichlet boundary condition. 

==Examples==

===ODE===
For an ordinary differential equation, for instance, formula_1 the Dirichlet boundary conditions on the interval take the form
formula_2
where and are given numbers.

===PDE===

For a partial differential equation, for example, formula_3 where formula_4 denotes the Laplace operator, the Dirichlet boundary conditions on a domain take the form
formula_5
where is a known function defined on the boundary .

===Applications===

For example, the following would be considered Dirichlet boundary conditions:
* In mechanical engineering and civil engineering (beam theory), where one end of a beam is held at a fixed position in space.
* In heat transfer, where a surface is held at a fixed temperature.
* In electrostatics, where a node of a circuit is held at a fixed voltage.
* In fluid dynamics, the no-slip condition for viscous fluids states that at a solid boundary, the fluid will have zero velocity relative to the boundary.

==Other boundary conditions==

Many other boundary conditions are possible, including the Cauchy boundary condition and the mixed boundary condition. The latter is a combination of the Dirichlet and Neumann conditions.

*Robin boundary condition

<text>Alemannic, or rarely Alemannish (&quot;Alemannisch&quot;, ), is a group of High German dialects. The name derives from the ancient Germanic tribal confederation known as the Alemanni (&quot;all men&quot;).

== Distribution ==
Alemannic dialects are spoken by approximately ten million people in several countries:
* In Europe:
** Switzerland: all German-speaking parts of the country except Samnaun
** Germany: centre and south of Baden-Württemberg, Swabia, and certain districts of Bavaria
** Austria: Vorarlberg, Reutte District of Tyrol
** Liechtenstein
** France: Alsace region (Alsatian dialect) and in some villages of the Phalsbourg county, in Lorraine
** Italy: Gressoney-La-Trinité, Gressoney-Saint-Jean, Issime, Alagna Valsesia, Rimella and Formazza, in some other villages almost extinct
*Outside Europe:
** United States: Allen and Adams County, Indiana, by the Amish there and also in their daughter settlements in Indiana and other U.S. states.
** Venezuela: Colonia Tovar (Colonia Tovar dialect)

== Status ==

Alemannic comprises a dialect continuum from the Highest Alemannic spoken in the mountainous south to Swabian in the relatively flat north and more of the characteristics of Standard German the farther north one goes.

In Germany and other European countries, the abstand and ausbau language framework is used to decide what is a language and what is a dialect. According to this framework, Alemannic varieties of German form a dialect continuum and are clearly dialects. Some linguists and organisations that differentiate between languages and dialects primarily on the grounds of mutual intelligibility, such as SIL International and UNESCO, describe Alemannic as one of several independent languages. While ISO 639-2 does not distinguish between dialects, ISO 639-3 distinguishes four of them:

* codice_1 Colonia Tovar, a dialect spoken since 1843 in Venezuela,
* codice_2 what ISO 639-2 only considers to be the &quot;Alemannic&quot; language, is recognised here as:
** Alsatian, a dialect spoken in the eastern France region;
** Swiss German, mainly spoken in Switzerland;
* codice_3 Swabian German, mainly spoken in the central-southeastern Baden-Wuerttemberg,
* codice_4 Walser German, mainly spoken in Swiss Upper Valais in the Alps.

Standard German is used in writing and in Germany orally in formal contexts throughout the Alemannic-speaking regions (with the exception of Alsace, where French or the Alsatian dialect of Alemannic is used instead).

== Variants ==

Alemannic in the broad sense comprises the following variants:
* Swabian (mostly in Swabia, in Germany, covering large parts of Württemberg and all of Bavarian Swabia). Unlike most other Alemannic dialects, it does not retain the Middle High German monophthongs &quot;û, î&quot; but shifts them to , (as opposed to Standard German , ). For this reason, &quot;Swabian&quot; is also used in opposition to &quot;Alemannic&quot;.
* Alemannic in the strict sense:
** Low Alemannic dialects. Retain German initial as (or ) rather than fricativising to as in High Alemannic. Subvariants:
*** Upper-Rhine Alemannic in Southwestern Baden and its variant Alsatian (in Alsace, France)
*** Alemán Coloniero (in Venezuela)
*** Basel German (in Basel, Switzerland)
** Lake Constance Alemannic (Bodenseealemannisch) (in Southern Württemberg, Southeastern Baden, Northwestern Vorarlberg), a transitional dialect, close to High Alemannic, with some Swabian features in the vowel system.
** High Alemannic (mostly in Switzerland, parts of Vorarlberg, and in the southern parts of the Black Forest in Germany). Complete the High German consonant shift by fricativising initial to . Subvariants:
*** Bernese German
*** Zurich German
*** Vorarlbergisch
*** Liechtensteinisch
** Highest Alemannic (in the Canton of Valais, in the Walser settlements (e.g., in the canton of Grisons), in the Bernese Oberland and in the German-speaking part of Fribourg) does not have the hiatus diphthongisation of other dialects of German. For example: (&#x27;to snow&#x27;) instead of , (&#x27;to build&#x27;) instead of . Subvariants:
*** Walliser German
*** Walser German

The Alemannic dialects of Switzerland are often called Swiss German or &quot;Schwiizerdütsch&quot;.

== Written Alemannic ==
The oldest known texts in Alemannic are brief Elder Futhark inscriptions dating to the sixth century (Bülach fibula, Pforzen buckle, Nordendorf fibula). In the Old High German period, the first coherent texts are recorded in the St. Gall Abbey, among them the eighth-century Paternoster:
:

Due to the importance of the Carolingian abbeys of St. Gall and Reichenau Island, a considerable part of the Old High German corpus has Alemannic traits. Alemannic Middle High German is less prominent, in spite of the Codex Manesse compiled by Johannes Hadlaub of Zürich. The rise of the Old Swiss Confederacy from the fourteenth century led to the creation of Alemannic Swiss chronicles. Huldrych Zwingli&#x27;s Bible translation of the 1520s (the 1531 Froschauer Bible) was in an Alemannic variant of Early Modern High German. From the seventeenth century, written Alemannic was displaced by Standard German, which emerged from sixteenth century Early Modern High German, in particular in the wake of Martin Luther&#x27;s Bible translation of the 1520s. The 1665 revision of the Froschauer Bible removed the Alemannic elements, approaching the language used by Luther. For this reason, no binding orthographical standard for writing modern Alemannic emerged, and orthographies in use usually compromise between a precise phonological notation, and proximity to the familiar Standard German orthography (in particular for loanwords).

Johann Peter Hebel published his in 1803. Swiss authors often consciously employ Helvetisms within Standard German, notably Jeremias Gotthelf in his novels set in the Emmental, Friedrich Glauser in his crime stories, and more recently Tim Krohn in his &quot;Quatemberkinder&quot;.

The poet Ida Ospelt-Amann wrote and published exclusively in the dialect of Vaduz.

== Characteristics ==
* The diminutive is used frequently in all Alemannic dialects. Northern and eastern dialects use the suffix &quot;-le&quot;; western varieties (e.g. northern Alsace) uses the suffix &quot;-el&quot; /l̩/; southern dialects use the suffix &quot;-li&quot; (Standard German suffix &quot;-lein&quot; or &quot;-chen&quot;). As in standard German, these suffixes cause umlaut. Depending on dialect, &#x27;little house&#x27; may be &quot;Heisle&quot;, &quot;Hiisel&quot;, &quot;Hüüsle&quot;, &quot;Hüüsli&quot; or &quot;Hiisli&quot; (Standard German &quot;Häuslein&quot; or &quot;Häuschen&quot;). Some varieties have plural diminutives in &quot;-ler&quot;, &quot;-la&quot; or &quot;-lich&quot;.
* Northern variants of Alemannic (Swabian and Low Alemannic), like standard German, pronounce &quot;ch&quot; as a uvular or velar or (&quot;Ach-Laut&quot;) after back vowels (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot;) and as a palatal consonant (&quot;Ich-Laut&quot;) elsewhere. High Alemannic, Lake Constance Alemannic and Highest Alemannic dialects exclusively use the &quot;Ach-Laut&quot;.
* In most Alemannic dialects, the past participle of the verb meaning &quot;to be&quot; (&quot;sein&quot; in standard German, with past participle &quot;gewesen&quot;) derives from a form akin to (&quot;gsi&quot;, &quot;gsìnn&quot;, &quot;gsei&quot; etc.).

<text>The Ultimates is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics and created by writer Mark Millar and artist Bryan Hitch, which first started publication from &quot;The Ultimates&quot; #1 (cover date March 2002), as part of the company&#x27;s Ultimate Marvel imprint. The series is a modernized re-imagining of Marvel&#x27;s long-running Avengers comic-book franchise, centering around a task-force of super-humans and special agents organized by the U.S. government to combat growing threats to the world. The tale chronicles their progress as they bond and slowly learn to work together, despite their differing natures and personalities.

==Publication history==

The first volume of the &quot;Ultimates&quot;, written by Millar and illustrated by Hitch, was published in limited series format and ran for thirteen issues with production delays from January 30, 2002 until March 31, 2004. Hitch described the alternative-reality reimagining as one where, &quot;You have to approach it as though nothing has happened before and tell the story fresh from the start... We had to get to the core of who these people were and build outwards, so Cap [Captain America] was a soldier, Thor is either a nut case or a messiah ... Banner [the Hulk] an insecure genius, and [superspy Nick] Fury the king of cool&quot;.

A second series, also by Millar and Hitch, was released as &quot;Ultimates 2&quot; and ran 13 issues from Dec. 2004 to May 2007. The series had originally been slated for April 2004, but was resolicited to stockpile enough issues for a monthly release. It ran into similar production delays, however, due to Millar&#x27;s struggles with Crohn&#x27;s Disease and involvement writing &quot;Civil War&quot;, as well as the artists&#x27; need to keep busy with other work in the meantime.

In a 2004 interview, Millar outlined the difference between the &quot;Ultimates&quot; and the Avengers: &quot;The idea behind The Avengers is that the Marvel Universe&#x27;s biggest players all get together and fight all the biggest supervillains they can&#x27;t defeat individually, whereas &quot;Ultimates 2&quot; is an exploration of what happens when a bunch of ordinary people are turned into super-soldiers and being groomed to fight the real-life war on terror.&quot;

This was followed by the one-shot &quot;Ultimate Saga&quot; (Nov. 2007), a condensed retelling, by writers C. B. Cebulski and Mindy Owens and artist Travis Charest, of the events of &quot;Ultimates&quot; and &quot;Ultimates 2&quot;. A third series, &quot;Ultimates 3&quot; (Dec 2007 – Sept 2008) was written by Jeph Loeb and illustrated by Joe Madureira.

Mark Millar returned to the Ultimates with a series of shorter miniseries, beginning in 2009 with &quot;Ultimate Comics: Avengers&quot;, which ran from August 2009 until July 2011.

The Earth-6160 version of the Ultimates began its own comic series on June 5, 2024.
==Plot==
===&quot;The Ultimates&quot;===

General Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. establishes a strike force of government-sponsored superhumans which includes Steve Rogers (Captain America); scientist couple Henry and Janet Pym (Giant-Man and the Wasp); Bruce Banner (the Hulk) and Tony Stark (Iron Man). Together, they are based at the S.H.I.E.L.D facility the Triskelion. When Banner injects himself with the super-soldier serum and goes on a bloody rampage as the Hulk, he is eventually stopped by the other superhumans with the aid of Thor. The team then join forces with the mutants Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch and agents Hawkeye and Black Widow against the alien shape-shifters the Chitauri, who are defeated.

===&quot;The Ultimates 2&quot;===

A year later public opinion has turned against the team when it is discovered that Bruce Banner is in fact the Hulk and was responsible for hundreds of deaths. The team is undermined further when Thor is accused of being an escaped mental patient and is incarcerated. This is the doing of his brother Loki, who also facilitates the creation of a new team of anti-American multi-nationals called the &quot;Liberators&quot;. With the aid of the Black Widow – who betrays the team to the Liberators – the Ultimates are captured, but eventually escape and battle the Liberators to the death. With the aid of Asgardian warriors, the Ultimates defeat both Loki and the Liberators. Seeing how having the Ultimates working with the United States government &quot;policing&quot; the world would produce similar results to their battle against the Liberators, the team decided to leave S.H.I.E.L.D. and to continue to work as an independent team instead.

===&quot;The Ultimates 3&quot;===
Hank Pym is under house arrest at Ultimates Mansion. One of Pym&#x27;s Ultron robots drugs him and leaks a sex tape of Stark and the Black Widow to the internet. These distract from the robot&#x27;s fatal shooting of the Scarlet Witch. Magneto abducts Wanda&#x27;s corpse and retreats to the Savage Land, where he is confronted by the Ultimates. Pym and Wasp discover the truth about the Ultron robot, which has adopted the identity of Yellowjacket and uses the Ultimates&#x27; DNA to create a series of android duplicates. Although the true Ultimates destroy their android counterparts and Yellowjacket, Quicksilver is apparently killed by Hawkeye. The Wasp then invites Pym to return to the Ultimates, and he accepts. The mastermind behind the robot&#x27;s plot is revealed to be Doctor Doom.

===&quot;New Ultimates&quot;===

The Ultimate Defenders, suddenly with superpowers, steal Thor&#x27;s hammer from Valkyrie. Hela agrees to release Thor in exchange for a son. Loki arrives in Central Park with an army of monsters.

===&quot;Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates&quot;===

Writer Jonathan Hickman and artist Esad Ribić relaunched the Ultimates with a different lineup consisting of Nick Fury, Iron Man, Thor, Spider-Woman and others.

===&quot;All-New Ultimates&quot;===
Following the conclusion of the miniseries &quot;Cataclysm&quot; and under the Ultimate Marvel NOW! banner, coinciding with the Marvel Universe All-New Marvel NOW! launch, writer Michel Fiffe and artist Amilcar Pinna brought together a new team, including Spider-Man, the new Black Widow who was formerly Spider-Woman, Kitty Pryde, Bombshell, and Cloak and Dagger. The book ran for 12 issues.

&quot;All-New Ultimates&quot; has been collected in two trade paperbacks; Volume One is titled &quot;Power for Power&quot;, collecting issues #1–6; while Volume Two is titled &quot;No Gods, No Masters&quot;, collecting issues #7-#12.

===Return===
When the Maker collaborated with the High Evolutionary to destroy the Superflow that kept the different universes separate in order to merge them into one reality, the Ultimates members Captain America, Iron Man, Giant-Man, Wasp, and Hulk were revived where they were to help Eternity fight the First Firmament. When Earth-616&#x27;s version of the Ultimates arrived on Counter-Earth to confront Maker about his actions, he ordered the Earth-1610 Ultimates to attack. As both versions of Ultimates concluded that there is no reason to fight each other, Maker killed the Earth-1610 Captain America for disobeying his orders. Upon Maker being defeated, both Ultimates helped Eternity to defeat the First Firmament. Afterwards, the Earth-1610 Ultimates left to pursue Maker.

The Ultimates are later seen on Earth-1610 when it is recreated.

==Other versions==
===Earth-616===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; branding, the Prime earth version of the Ultimates make their debut where they deal with cosmic threats before they can affect Earth.

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker traveled to Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. After Iron Man sacrificed himself to seal himself, Maker, and Kang the Conqueror inside The City at Latveria, Tony Stark and Reed Richards work to undo the Maker&#x27;s work, with Tony placing the Immortus Engine into his armor and taking up the name of Iron Lad. They later find Captain America frozen in ice. With Richards having taken up the alias of Doom, he and Tony raid an Asgardian prison where they free Thor while his warden Sif is transported as well. She agrees to help as they raid a repository in Latveria so that they can restore the stolen lives of those whose origins Maker had thwarted. They only run off with a few items due to a attack by Henri Duggary. The rest of the Maker&#x27;s Council conducts a false flag attack on Stark Tower which kills thousands, framing Tony and his group as terrorists.

Operating covertly in a Stark/Stane satellite called &quot;The Triskelion&quot; after being sent six months into the future, Tony states they have 18 months before The City opens. Using the Immortus Engine, they can operate in the past, present, and future. Tony plans on starting a resistance network against the Council by trying to recreate Earth-616&#x27;s heroes. After calculations in modifying the Engine, Doom states they could build their resistance movement six months in the past and have their army overnight in the future. During their work, Iron Lad oversees Captain America&#x27;s awakening from his coma and explains about the changed political status quo, while Thor still heals from his wounds. A week later, Rogers advises Stark and Doom that they need to start a revolution on the ground. Iron Lad then tries sending &quot;origin-machines&quot; back in time. Only a few take them as some of them are either intercepted or have declined. Tony states that they&#x27;ll have to do it another way. They start by recruiting exterminators Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne. Just then, they are attacked by Duggary, the new ruler of the East Coast, his Black Crusade, and his army of giants. As the group fights Henri&#x27;s forces, Janet becomes Wasp. Hank soon becomes Giant-Man and steps on some of the Black Crusade. The news mentions their battle as Hank&#x27;s footprint is heavily discussed online. Stark states that the Ultimates are here and are going to leave a mark.

Iron Lad, Captain America, and Doom later raid a facility called &quot;Damage Control&quot; which contains different items belonging to deceased heroes as well as the corpses of many. Examples include the broken body of a robot, the corpse of the &quot;Infant King of Attilan&quot;, a taxidermy of a man and his pet Smilodon from the Savage Land, fragments of an unknown costume, and the metallic skeleton of Weapon X. While they are attacked by agents of H.A.N.D, the Maker&#x27;s secret police, Captain America and Iron Lad manage to free Human Torch from his casing, welcoming him to the Ultimates.

On July 4th, Iron Lad, Captain America, Giant-Man, and Wasp arrive at the White House. Earlier that day, Steve Rogers views a holo-program from Howard Stark&#x27;s files on the history of the former United States of America as it shows how Maker altered the Earth&#x27;s timeline since 1963, starting with him establishing The City and meeting John F. Kennedy. Back in the present, the Ultimates fight their way past H.A.N.D. agents. They enter the Oval Office where they confront a man in an Iron Man armor named &quot;Midas&quot;. Iron Lad identifies it as his father&#x27;s first armor, which Midas says was gained when the Stark/Stane&#x27; assets were up for grabs. Midas tries to make a deal with the team as Rogers state their intentions are to save America. Midas states that his vision of America is wider as he considers commerce is what truly represents the nation itself. They fight until Iron Lad blows a hole to the basement. They find a woman trapped in a machine that is feeding off of her cosmic radiation. Midas claims she fell from the future and that her energy is highly valuable. With Giant-Man and Wasp unconscious and Iron Lad&#x27;s armor in power saving mode, Captain America fights against a ranting and rambling Midas. Wasp regains consciousness and takes the opportunity to shoot the machine, freeing the woman as Rogers gives Midas a neck injury. Midas claims that if they take her, part of the American electrical grid will fail. In a flashback during July 1st, Steve learns from Tony that he has been through the entire holographic program, learning the history of decades in a few days. Back in the present, Captain America carries the woman, asking if she remembers her name. She says her name is America as the Ultimates walk away from a burning White House.

Later, at an island in the South Pacific, Iron Lad, Thor, and Sif, find gamma-irradiated lizards as they are confronted by one of them while exploring. After almost killing a humanoid, they are confronted by a She-Hulk. She introduces herself as Lejori Zakaria who is the protector of the island and its people. Iron Lad states that they didn&#x27;t come to fight and just wanted to talk. Lejori then calms down the gamma-irradiated humanoid as it regresses to a human baby as she talks about how Bruce Banner left her fellow islanders to live in the fallout after the &quot;Banner-Ulam Gamma Bomb&quot; was tested nearby. When Tony asks if there are others like her, Lejori takes them to her village and shows off the mutated islanders who aren&#x27;t like her. She asks Iron Lad to fix their island before she can fully join the fight against Banner and the Council. Meanwhile, Hulk is shown watching this from a hidden camera feed as he declares the Ultimates as intruders on his land. He gives the orders to assemble the Immortal Weapons as the Ultimates are &quot;making him angry&quot;.

Later at the Triskelion, Iron Lad briefs Captain America on recent attacks to Roxxon facilities where survivors have stated seeing flying arrows that are of Stark/Stane&#x27;s design. Noting that the person who was supposed to be Hawkeye rejected the offer, someone has obtained the Hawkeye equipment. Tony sends Captain America to confront them since he&#x27;s swamped with the Gamma Island reclamation and Human Torch&#x27;s repairs and the other members are busy. At Roxxon Refinery 15, Hawkeye is confronted by Captain America who identifies them as a Native American named Charli Ramsey. Hawkeye goes on the attack using different arrows on Rogers while claiming that Roxxon does whatever they want and anyone who stands up to them gets arrested. During the fight, armed soldiers arrive, which Hawkeye states are part of Roxxon&#x27;s &quot;Cleanup Crew&quot;, a team of mercenaries who secure mining operations and that put down the &quot;Savage Land Revolt&quot; in the 70s. After defeating them, Hawkeye agrees to join the Ultimates. Meanwhile, With Emmanuel da Costa infuriated that they harmed Roxxon which is part of his profile, Hulk calms him down while stating that he had time to study their strengths and weaknesses. When Emmanuel asks what he would propose, Hulk states that he&#x27;s going to kill them once and for all.

Later, Iron Lad has cracked the Overnet used by Maker&#x27;s Council and has brought the entire team (minus Doom) to a Damage Control location that supposedly contains a dozen super-powered prisoners that they plan to rescue before their execution. When they enter it, they instead find themselves in another dimension, with Hulk inside as he offers them tea. She-Hulk then attacks Hulk for what he did to her island as he uses his Iron Fist move on her. Meanwhile, Doom is told by the Triskelion&#x27;s A.I. that it has lost contact with everyone. Hulk reveals to the team that they are on K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un and that he rules all of the seven Capital Cities of Heaven. His Immortal Weapons (consisting of Bride of Nine World-Breakers, Crane Mother of the Bomb, Decay&#x27;s Beautiful Daughter, Fat Cobra, Prince of Meltdowns, and Uranium Brother #235) then arrive as they take gamma injections. The Ultimates then fight them and Hulk. Meanwhile, Doom finally locates the Ultimates after doing a search across Avalon, Asgard, and Hel. Fat Cobra then swallows a smaller Wasp, but she grows enough to kill him and then collapses in Giant-Man&#x27;s arms. Hulk uses his Gigatron Vice Grip on Iron Lad to defeat him. She-Hulk then lunges towards Hulk, but he breaks her right hand off. Doom manages to teleport everyone out at the last minute. As he checks on everyone, She-Hulk regenerates her right hand and claims that Iron Lad is dead.

While incognito on the streets, Steve Rogers and Jim Hammond talk about how the Ultimates have been blamed for everything. Jim mentions that the rest of the team are looking at Steve for leadership after what happened to Tony. Both reminisce about their time during World War II, later seeing the news about the Stark Tower Memorial overseen by Father Matthew Murdock. Hank and Janet attend the event. At Oscorp Defense, Hawkeye destroys a weapons supply while it&#x27;s shipped off to the Upper and Lower Kingdoms. In Guatemala, America Chavez protects a pro-democracy demonstration by melting the police officers&#x27; armors. Thor and Sif are at Yggdrasil where Sif mentions that she told Doom that they could sow chaos in the Nine Realms, spread discontent, raise an army, and give All-Father Loki a taste of his medicine. Considering a Asgardian Rebellion, Sif asks Thor where they should start. On the Triskelion, Doom convinces She-Hulk to lay low to protect both her people and the Ultimates, stating he can tap into Hulk&#x27;s surveillance system to keep an eye on her village. Tony is shown in a machine on life support, as Doom oversees his recovery.

As Captain America, Giant-Man, Wasp, Human Torch, America Chavez, She-Hulk, and Hawkeye are doing some time-traveling, Doom is speaking through a robot that is assisting them. They end up coming upon a crash-landed ship containing an alien woman who recognized America as she doesn&#x27;t remember them. They brought up events she helped in like defeating the Ultron Division, fighting the 24th Celestial Host when it judged the Milky Way as unworthy, and turning the Negative Zone into the Positive Zone. The alien introduces herself as the Guardians of the Galaxy from the 61th Century. When the Ultimates start to get concern, the female alien introduces herself as Captain Marvel and introduces her teammates Star-Lord: Master of the Solar System, Ultimate Nullifier who once shot Mephisto through the Heart with an O-Bullet, and Cosmo Starstalker who stayed behind when other dogs ascended to a higher lifeform as the Ultimates fight them. Cosmo detects that America&#x27;s mind was cut open many times enough that her &quot;past is amputated&quot;. As Cosmo shows the Ultimates the day when they fell, Star-Lord speaks to Doom&#x27;s robot noting that he is not the Doom they are familiar with and that he will be responsible for the loss of a trillion lives. Captain Marvel then shares her memories with America where they used to be lovers in the 61st Century where it is in a post-imperialistic time. Though there are 250,000 Guardians protecting a lot of planets, one group of them fell victim to the Unmaker. The Guardians of the Galaxy boarded a time ship to escape their unraveling time and ended up encountering an army outside of time led by Kang the Conqueror. They fought against them while Captain Universe, Star Brand, Molecule Boy, Giraud the Phoenix, Gary: Wielder of the Infinty Gauntlet maintained the integrity of their ship. When the Hero-Star of Tranta went supernova, it slew the descendants of Hulk who lived on Planet Hulk as they flew their ship into whatever reality has replaced their future. A lot of people died upon impact where Captain Marvel landed in the Stone Age which took her awhile to build a time ship to locate her teammates. After that story, Captain Marvel figured that America landing in this time period broke the Unmaker&#x27;s barrier as she plans to find a way to break the barrier and undo the Unmaker&#x27;s work and save everyone. As America still doesn&#x27;t have her own memories and claims that Maker will be out of The City in 10 months, Captain Marvel states that the Ultimates will still lose against Maker. Before the Guardians of the Galaxy leave, Captain Marvel gives America temporal flare that will signal them. As the Guardians of the Galaxy leave to find their displaced members, Doom looks over a recuperating Tony Stark.

One of Tony Stark&#x27;s &quot;origin machine&quot; success stories occurred in 2024 at Seagate Prison when one of those boxes showed up in front of inmate Luke Cage. While he was able to use his abilities to form a gang and overthrow the prison system, Luke was visited by Iron Lad who welcomes him to the Ultimates. Luke tells Iron Lad that he can help him out from within the prison system until everyone is freed. When in Gordium Correctional Facility, Luke befriends fellow inmate Danny Rand. As the guards later plan to have the firing squad shoot Luke Cage for planning a possible prison escape, the bullets don&#x27;t harm him as he leads a prison riot that enters its third day. With that broadcast on the news, She-Hulk speaks to Tony in his healing chamber mentioning about the pain that she has. While noting that she has to get back to her people, she advises Tony not to give up the fight. After She-Hulk walks away, Tony&#x27;s eyes open.

==Sales and reception==
Overall, the &quot;Ultimates&quot; series has been generally well received by critics and readers, with the first two volumes being praised for the surprisingly mature themes and concepts, the more humanly flawed and layered characterizations of the original &quot;Avengers&quot; members, Millar&#x27;s storytelling and writing, Hitch&#x27;s photo-realistic and cinematic-styled artwork, the modernized, grittier and realistic, yet simultaneously engaging and intriguing re-imagining of the classic &quot;Avengers&quot; mythos and the political relevance of the first two volumes, while criticism was leveled at the unnecessarily adult-oriented, shallow attempt at maturity and the overly cynical tone and direction of the series, with the third volume: &quot;The Ultimates 3&quot; being met with a mostly negative reception, compared to the positive response received by the first two volumes, for the aforementioned reasons. The first volume of &quot;Ultimates&quot; #1 ranked fourth among the top 300 comics sold for February 2002, based on Diamond Publisher&#x27;s indexes, with the next three issues ranked second, second, and third, respectively.

Popmatters.com praised Mark Millar&#x27;s writing in the opening eight issues, stating the writer &quot;is able to walk a very fine line of keeping the story measured yet entertaining&quot;. Comics Bulletin, in a review of the &quot;Homeland Security&quot; story arc, states the artwork is &quot;visual magnificence&quot; yet is concerned about the dark writing of the characters stripped of their &quot;super-heroic nobility&quot; and was &quot;disheartened by the book’s tone and cynicism&quot;. Shakingthrough.net gave &quot;Homeland Security&quot; a 4.2 out of 5.0 stating it is an &quot;engaging read, filled with intriguing and amusing modern takes on classic Marvel characters&quot; whilst praising Bryan Hitch&#x27;s artwork by saying it is &quot;amazing, gorgeous artwork, which continues to set the standard for cinematic photo-realism.&quot;

&quot;Ultimates 2&quot; #1 ranked second among the top 300 comics sold for December 2004, with the next three issues ranked second, fourth and sixth, respectively.

Reviewing &quot;Ultimates 2&quot;, Curledup.com praised Millar&#x27;s writing of the classic heroes and the &quot;inclusion of current-day politics&quot; improves the storyline. Comics Bulletin reviewed the final issue #13 but found it anticlimactic with the issue degenerating to a &quot;slug fest&quot;. The artwork was praised with the reviewer stating that Bryan Hitch&#x27;s &quot;artwork has definitely been one of the main elements that will make this series memorable.&quot; Den of Geek praised the artwork, with &quot;Bryan Hitch doing some of the best work of his career&quot;, but was critical of Millar&#x27;s writing stating it had &quot;no substance&quot;.

&quot;Ultimates 3&quot; #1 ranked first in December 2007&#x27;s Top 300 comics with preorder sales of 131,401, Issue #2 ranked number seven with 105,070 preorders. Issue three ranked better than its predecessor, falling at number five, but had a smaller number of preorders, totaling at 97,210.

Reviewing &quot;Ultimates 3&quot;, IGN called the book a &quot;reasonably decent experience&quot; although the issue &quot;falters on its own merits&quot;, only to later state while reviewing the third issue that &quot;Behind the theatrics and swagger, there&#x27;s just nothing there to draw me in. These are the characters that I used to enjoy in name only, hollow shells of what they used to be.&quot; Alvaro&#x27;s Comic Boards&#x27; review was even harsher, remarking that &quot;Ultimates 3&quot; &quot;has somehow managed to entirely miss what made the Ultimates something other than alternative universe Avengers&quot; and adding &quot;this was the worst comic I&#x27;ve read all year&quot;.

2011&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates&quot; received highly positive reactions upon its debut. Chad Nevett from Comic Book Resources wrote that &quot;the comic is exciting and sets up a large story that, right now, seems like it could easily end with the destruction of the team. A first issue that starts with its foot on the gas is exactly what’s called for&quot;, while IGN gave the first issue 8/10.

<text>Hugh Anthony Cregg III (born July 5, 1950), known professionally as Huey Lewis, is an American singer, songwriter and actor.

Lewis sings lead and plays harmonica for his band, Huey Lewis and the News, in addition to writing or co-writing many of the band&#x27;s songs. The band is perhaps best known for their third, and best-selling, album &quot;Sports&quot;, and their contribution to the soundtrack of the 1985 feature film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. Lewis previously played with the band Clover from 1972 to 1979.

==Early life==
Huey Lewis was born in New York City. His father, Hugh Anthony Cregg Jr., was an Irish-American from Boston, and his mother, Maria Magdalena Barcinska, was a Polish immigrant, from Warsaw. His grandfather, Hugh Cregg, was district attorney of Essex County, Massachusetts, from 1931 to 1959.

Lewis was raised in Marin County, California, living in Tamalpais Valley and Strawberry, and attending Strawberry Point Elementary School (where he skipped second grade) and Edna Maguire Junior High School in Mill Valley. When he was 13, his parents divorced. He attended and graduated from the Lawrenceville School, a then all-male prep school in New Jersey, in 1967, and he achieved a perfect score of 800 on the math portion of the SAT. He was also an baseball player. Lewis attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.

His mother had an extramarital affair with Beat Generation poet Lew Welch, who became his stepfather. Lewis credits Welch with inspiring him in his early teenage years. His mother was close friends with the Grateful Dead&#x27;s manager and extended family.

In an interview with David Letterman, Lewis talked about hitchhiking across the country back to New York City and how he learned to play the harmonica while waiting for rides. He talked about hanging out at an airport for three days until he stowed away on a plane to Europe. In later interviews, Lewis would reveal other encounters he had traveling around Europe. While visiting Aberdeen, Scotland, with no money and nowhere to sleep, he claimed that the locals were very hospitable by offering him somewhere to stay. In Madrid, Spain, he became an accomplished blues player as he hitchhiked and supported himself by busking with his harmonica. He gave his first concerts in Madrid, earning enough money to buy a plane ticket back to the US.

Upon his return, Lewis entered the engineering program at Cornell University. While there he made friends with Lance and Larry Hoppen, who later played with Orleans, and with Eddie Tuleja of King Harvest. Initially an active student, Lewis soon lost interest in college. He signed up with a band called Slippery Elm and, in December 1969 during his junior year, he dropped out of Cornell and moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area. He stated that California was where &quot;it was all happening.&quot; His aim was to continue playing music, though along the way he also tried other fields of work including landscaping, carpentry, and wedding and event planning, as well as delivering and selling natural foods.

==Music career==
In 1971, Lewis joined the Bay Area band Clover. Around this time he took the stage name &quot;Hughie Louis&quot;, the spelling of which he would tinker with for some years after. Other members of the band (at various points) included John McFee and Alex Call. Lewis played harmonica and sang lead vocals on a few tunes.

In 1976, after playing in the Bay Area with limited success, Clover went to Los Angeles. They had their big break in a club there when their act was caught by Nick Lowe, who convinced Clover to travel to Great Britain with him. However, Clover arrived in Britain just as their folk-rock sound, known as pub rock in Britain, was being replaced by punk rock.

The two Clover albums produced by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange for Phonogram were not successful. By this point the spelling of Cregg&#x27;s stage name had changed to &quot;Huey Louis&quot;; it is under this spelling that he is billed on both of Clover&#x27;s albums for Phonogram, although for songwriting credits he is billed as &quot;H. Cregg&quot;. The band accompanied Elvis Costello on his debut album, &quot;My Aim is True&quot;, minus Lewis and Alex Call, the singers. As Lewis told Rolling Stone years later, &quot;there isn’t any harmonica. I tell people, &#x27;All the harmonica that isn’t on the Elvis Costello record was played by me.&#x27;&quot; In 1978, the band returned to California, McFee joined the Doobie Brothers, and Clover disbanded. McFee and Lewis, credited as Huey Harp, both appear as guest musicians on the George Hatcher Band&#x27;s 1977 sophomore album, &quot;Talkin&#x27; Turkey&quot;, produced by Tom Allom. 
Under the name &quot;Bluesy Huey Lewis&quot;, Lewis played harmonica on Thin Lizzy&#x27;s 1978 landmark album &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot;. That same year, he was playing at Uncle Charlie&#x27;s, a club in Corte Madera, California, doing the &quot;Monday Night Live&quot; spot along with future members of the News. At this point, he had adopted the &quot;Huey Lewis&quot; spelling, and the band was billed as Huey Lewis and the American Express. After recording the song &quot;Exodisco&quot; (a disco version of the theme from the film &quot;Exodus&quot;) simply as American Express, Lewis landed a singles contract from Phonogram, and Bob Brown became his manager.

The band played a few gigs (including an opening for Van Morrison), before adding new guitarist Chris Hayes to the line-up. On Brown&#x27;s advice, they changed their name again to Huey Lewis and The News. After a failed self-titled debut in 1980, the band finally broke through to Top 40 success with the gold album &quot;Picture This&quot; (1982). It rose to No. 13 on the albums chart thanks to the Mutt Lange-penned &quot;Do You Believe in Love&quot; (No. 7), the band&#x27;s first hit.

The band&#x27;s third LP, &quot;Sports&quot; (1983), is one of the best-selling pop releases of all time. It became a No. 1 hit in 1984 and had multi-platinum success in 1985. Four singles from the album reached the top-10 of the Billboard Hot 100: &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; reached No. 8, while &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot;, &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, and &quot;If This Is It&quot; all reached No. 6.
Lewis knew Nick Lowe and Dave Edmunds from having played harmonica on their 1979 albums (&quot;Labour of Lust&quot; and &quot;Repeat When Necessary&quot;) and produced Lowe&#x27;s 1985 version of &quot;I Knew the Bride (When She Used to Rock and Roll)&quot;. He later produced several songs (including one where he sang backup and played harmonica) on Bruce Hornsby &amp; The Range&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Way It Is.&quot; Hornsby thanked him by writing the song &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, a No. 1 single from the News&#x27; next album &quot;Fore!&quot;

His song &quot;The Power of Love&quot; was a No. 1 U.S. hit and was featured in the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, for which they also recorded the song, &quot;Back in Time&quot;. Lewis has a cameo appearance in the film as a faculty member who rejects Marty McFly&#x27;s band&#x27;s audition for the school&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; contest. As an inside joke, the piece the band plays is an instrumental heavy metal version of &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. (Lewis plays the audition committee leader, who, after glancing at the other, equally unimpressed fellow faculty members, picks up the megaphone and says, &quot;Hold it, fellas ... I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re just too darn loud. Next, please&quot;.) A poster for the album &quot;Sports&quot; is hanging on Marty&#x27;s wall when he awakes at the end of the movie. &quot;The Power of Love&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award.

Following the success of &quot;The Power of Love&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, Huey Lewis and the News released their fourth studio album, &quot;Fore!&quot; in 1986. &quot;Fore!&quot; followed the success of &quot;Sports&quot; and reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album spawned the No. 1 singles, &quot;Stuck with You&quot; and &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; as well as the mainstream rock hit &quot;Hip to Be Square&quot;. In all, the album had five top-10 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was certified triple platinum.

Lewis and his bandmates performed on USA for Africa&#x27;s 1985 fund-raising single &quot;We Are the World&quot;. The remainder of the 1980s and early 1990s were mostly spent touring and recording fourteen top-20 Billboard Hot 100 hits and releasing two more hit albums: &quot;Small World&quot; (1988), which reached number 11 on the charts, and &quot;Hard at Play&quot; (1991) which peaked at number 27. Lewis had a planned solo album titled &quot;Back in Blue&quot; that was canceled in the mid-1990s due to living arrangement issues on the part of Lewis. One of the songs from that cancelled project, &quot;100 Years From Now&quot;, was later used for the compilation album &quot;Time Flies... The Best Of&quot;.

Lewis has sung with Chicago-based progressive jam band Umphrey&#x27;s McGee at several shows beginning with the 2005 Jammy Awards and is featured on two tracks of their album &quot;Safety in Numbers&quot;.

On February 13, 2007, Lewis was interviewed on the podcast series &quot;Stuck&quot; in the 1980s. During the interview, he revealed that the band had written several new songs that they planned to record in 2008. He also stated that, given how much the industry has changed since their last album, he was unsure how they would sell the new material.

During a show at the California State Fair on August 21, 2007, Lewis was named Sacramento&#x27;s Musician of the Year by the fair&#x27;s general manager and presented with a gold statue of the California state bear.
Lewis recorded a duet version of &quot;Workin&#x27; for a Livin&#x27;&quot; with Garth Brooks, which was included on Brooks&#x27;s three-disc set &quot;The Ultimate Hits&quot;, in late 2007.

On July 4, 2008, the eve of his 58th birthday, Huey Lewis and the News were the opening act for the annual A Capitol Fourth celebration on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. More than a half million people attended and was broadcast live on PBS. The band performed &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, &quot;The Power of Love&quot; and &quot;Workin&#x27; for a Livin&#x27;&quot;.

On May 29, 2011, Lewis played the annual Summer Camp Music Festival in Chillicothe, Illinois, along with Umphrey&#x27;s McGee. They were billed as Huey Lewis and The Rumors. Together they played covers as well as songs from both their respective catalogs.

On April 2, 2013, Lewis appeared on the ABC television series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, where he performed &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; in celebration of the 30th anniversary release of &quot;Sports&quot; and a concert tour with the News.

On April 13, 2018, Lewis announced that he had been diagnosed with Ménière&#x27;s disease, and that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t hear well enough to sing&quot;. As a result, the remaining shows scheduled for the 2018 tour were cancelled.

In November 2023, it was announced that the musical &quot;The Heart of Rock and Roll&quot; featuring the band&#x27;s music would debut on Broadway in March 2024. Lewis has been involved in the development of the show since 2018.

==Acting career==
After Lewis&#x27;s cameo appearance as a teacher in &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, more substantial roles followed, including Vern Miller in Robert Altman&#x27;s ensemble feature, &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, and Ricky Dean in &quot;Duets&quot;. He has performed in occasional television roles as well, including &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;The King of Queens&quot; and a recurring character on &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;. Lewis provides the voice of Bulworth the junkyard dog in the animated series &quot;Puppy Dog Pals&quot;.

In 2013, he played himself in a parody of &quot;American Psycho&quot; with &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic.

On October 21, 2015, on an episode of &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot;, Lewis reprised his role from &quot;Back to the Future&quot; in a segment where Marty McFly and Doc Brown arrive in the time machine and talk to the host.

On February 12, 2021, he played himself on an episode of &quot;The Blacklist&quot;.

==Lawsuit==
In 1985, Lewis sued Ray Parker Jr. over similarities between Parker&#x27;s theme for the 1984 movie &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and Lewis&#x27;s &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot;. The case was settled out of court with both parties agreeing to keep the settlement secret. In 2001, Parker sued Lewis, alleging that in a &quot;Behind the Music&quot; episode, Lewis had discussed the settlement in violation of their nondisclosure agreement.

==Personal life==
Lewis lives on a ranch near Stevensville, Montana. He considers it his permanent residence.

He married his manager&#x27;s secretary, Sidney Conroy, in 1983 in Hawaii. They separated six years later. They have a daughter and a son.

In April 2018, Lewis revealed that he had hearing loss as a result of Ménière&#x27;s disease, and canceled all upcoming tour dates.

<text>In Spain and Latin America, the  (; ) is part of a regulatory geographical indication system used primarily for foodstuffs such as cheeses, condiments, honey, and meats, among others. In wines, it parallels the hierarchical systems of France (1935) and Italy (1963), although Rioja (1925) and Jerez (1933) preceded the full system. In foods, it performs a similar role, regulation of quality and geographical origin of products from Spain. There are five other designated categories solely for wine and a further three specifically covering food and condiments, all recognised by the European Union (EU). In Catalonia, two further categories – labelled A and Q – cover traditional Catalan artisan food products, but were not recognised by the EU In recent decades, the concept of the has been adopted by other countries, primarily in Latin America. In 2016, the use of the (DO) for wines was registered as a European Union Protected Designations of Origin/ (PDO/DOP), but the traditional Portuguese term of DO can still be used legally on labels.

==Definition==

The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food regulates the quality of Spanish foodstuffs via a labelling system which establishes, among other things, a for the country&#x27;s highest-quality produce. There is a semi-autonomous governing body (&quot;Consejo Regulador&quot;) for each region and for each food type, comprising skilled, impartial members who investigate the quality, ingredients and production process of each product, ensuring they attain specific quality levels. They report to a central council at national government level, but are normally based in the largest population centre of a given region and are responsible for ensuring labelling reflects geographical region. Products labelled , apart from being of superior quality, are expected to carry specific characteristics of geographical region or individual producer and be derived from raw materials originating within the region. Like most of these designations, a fundamental tenet of a DO label is that no product outside of that region is permitted to bear the name.

== History ==

Food and wine are inseparable from Spanish culture, historically bound to the social, economic, literary and even mystical fabric of society over thousands of years, so it is perhaps not surprising that attempts to regulate and normalise activities related to them have proven highly elusive. It was not until the seventeenth century, when legislative authorities became sufficiently interested in issues such as public health, public order and economic regulation, that laws begin to be formulated with regard to wine, initially prohibiting, later encouraging and ultimately regulating its production, commercialisation and consumption. Food regulation waited even longer, until Spain&#x27;s entry into the EU and signing up to the Common Agricultural Policy during the latter part of the twentieth century.

A series of Royal Decrees on wine were issued during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, focussing on &quot;ad hoc&quot; issues which arose due to new tendencies at home and abroad and often dealing more with maverick suppliers than any concern with comprehensive regulation. Gradually though, concern shifted from issues related to supply towards the need to regulate quality, especially for foreign markets. During the 1920s serious attempts were made to formulate some kind of classification along the lines of the French &quot;appellation&quot; system. Following the establishment of the Rioja as the first Spanish &quot;denominación&quot; in 1925, the &quot;Estatuto de vino&quot; (&#x27;wine statute&#x27;) of 1932 coincided with national and international recognition of the sherry-producing region of Jerez.

Despite being thorough and wide-ranging, the &quot;Estatuto&quot; was quickly overwhelmed by technological advances in agriculture. By the time the EEC became influential in this area. it was clear that the law would require fundamental re-drafting. A new &quot;Estatuto&quot;, the &quot;Ley del Vino y de los Alcoholes (25/1970)&quot; came into place in December 1970 but was again undermined, this time by two important events: the new Spanish Constitution (inaugurated in 1978) that restated geographical considerations with the &quot;Estado de las Autonomías&quot;, and Spain&#x27;s pending membership of the European Community (1986) that brought about a rapid classification of all Spanish produce in line with other member states.

Finally, in March 1996, the Spanish government unveiled its own multi-tier sub-classifications, consistent with EU regulation but more pertinent to Spanish agriculture. Hence, for example, the EU&#x27;s Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions (QWPSR) covers all Spanish wines graded above the basic &quot;vino de mesa&quot; (&#x27;table wine&#x27;). The Spanish forms a subset of the QWPSR. This has coincided with a rise in the perceived quality of Spanish produce generally and has been widely acclaimed, although some areas, like the super-strict &quot;denominación de pago&quot;, remain controversial and liable to future amendment.

==Product types==
&quot;Denominaciones de origen&quot; status can be applied to a wide range of foods and condiments, specifically:

Quality foods may be designated a range of classifications, of which is the recognition of superior quality, with identifiable characteristics and specific ingredients, derived from an identifiable and verifiable source. Other classifications, not necessarily mutually exclusive, are as follows, under the general heading of (&#x27;foods of distinguished quality&#x27;):
* (DOP, literally &#x27;protected denomination of origin&#x27;) – an EU designation of protected geographical status, referring to food products specific to a particular region or town and conveying a particular quality or characteristic of the designated area.
*&quot;Indicación geográfica protegida&quot;&#x27; (IGP, &#x27;protected geographical indicator&#x27;) – similar to DOP, but relating to a wider and less specific geographical region.
*&quot;Especialidades tradicionales Garantizadas&quot; (ETG, &#x27;traditional specialty guaranteed&#x27;) – products made using traditional ingredients, recipes or methods.
*&quot;Artisan food product stamp A&quot; – recognising small, family-run food businesses with high quality, distinctive produce overseen by a qualified artisan (Catalonia only, not recognised by the EU).
*&quot;Food quality stamp Q&quot; – foods with superior quality composition, production methods or presentation (Catalonia only, not recognised by the EU).
*&quot;Producción agricultura ecológica&quot;&#x27; (PAE, &#x27;organic agricultural production&#x27; – an organic food designation recognising natural, environmentally friendly production methods.

By 2004, Spain had 250 &quot;denominaciones de origen&quot; and &quot;indicaciones geográficas protegidas&quot;, over half of which related to food. The following list of better-known &quot;denominaciónes de origen&quot; is by no means exhaustive:

===Olive oil===
The &quot;denominaciones de origen&quot; for olive oil include:
* Aceite Monterrubio – from Badajoz in Extremadura, mostly Cornezuelo and Picual varieties.
* Baena – Hojiblanca, Picual and Lechín varieties from the south-east of the province of Cordoba.
* Les Garrigues – Arbequina and Verdiell varieties from the province of Lleida in Catalonia.
* Priego de Córdoba – Picado, Hojiblanca and Picual varieties from the province of Córdoba.
* Sierra Magina – Picual variety from the southern part of Jaén province.
* Sierra Segura – mostly Picual from the north-east of Jaén province.
* Siurana – Arbequina, Royal, and Murrot varieties from the province of Tarragona.

=== Iberian ham (&quot;jamón ibérico&quot;) ===

The famous &quot;jamón ibérico&quot; has several &quot;denominaciones de origen&quot;, including:

* Huelva – source of the &quot;jamón de Jabugo&quot;.
* Teruel
* Guijuelo – well known for &quot;jamón y paleta ibéricos de bellota&quot; (from acorn-fed pigs)
* Dehesa de Extremadura
* Los Pedroches

=== Cheese ===
* Tetilla unusually shaped cheese from Galicia.
* Cabrales – Asturian blue cheese.
* Picon Bejes-Tresviso – from Liébana region in the province of Cantabria.
* Liebana – from Cantabria, renowned for smoked cheeses.
* Cantabria – &quot;fresh&quot; Cantabrian cheese.
* Idiazábal – Basque cheese; the DO labels includes the cheese output of Alava, Biscay, Gipuzkoa, and Navarre.
* Roncal – from Navarre.
* Zamorano – from Zamora
* Manchego – from La Mancha.
* La Serena – sheep-milk cheese from Badajoz.
* Torta del Casar – sheep-milk cheese from Cáceres.
* Afuega&#x27;l pitu – cow-milk cheese from Asturias.

===Vinegar===
There are just four protected appellations for vinegar in the EU, of which three are in Spain:

* Vinagre de Jerez – sherry vinegar from Jerez
* Condado de Huelva – white wine vinegar from Huelva
* Montilla-Moriles

===Wine===

Wine region classification in Spain takes a quite complex hierarchical form in which the is a mainstream grading, equivalent to the French AOC and the Italian DOC.
As of 2019, Spain has 138 identifiable wine regions under some form of geographical classification (2 DOCa/DOQ, 68 DO, 7 VC, 19 VP, and 42 VT). The Spanish DO is actually a subset of the EU-sponsored QWPSR (Quality Wine Produced in Specific Regions) regulatory code (&quot;vino de calidad producido en región determinada (VCPRD)&quot; in Spanish) which Spain formally adopted in 1986, upon accession to the (then) EEC. The Spanish appellation hierarchy was most recently updated in 2016, and is as follows:

DOP – (&#x27;protected denomination of origin&#x27;), is the mainstay of Spain&#x27;s wine quality control system. Each region is governed by a &quot;consejo regulador&quot;, which decides on the boundaries of the region, permitted varietals, maximum yields, limits of alcoholic strength and other quality standards or production limitations pertaining to the zone. As of 2019 there are 96 DOPs that are subdivided into DOCa, DO, VP, and VC. The sub-categories can be called DOP, or they can use the traditional terms of DOCa, DO, VP, and VC.

DOCa – &quot;denominación de origen calificada&quot; (&#x27;denomination of qualified origin&#x27;), is the highest category in Spanish wine regulations, reserved for regions with above-average grape prices and particularly stringent quality controls. Rioja was the first Spanish region to be awarded DOCa status in 1991, followed by Priorat in 2003. Priorat uses the Catalan language DOQ, for &quot;denominació d&#x27;origen qualificada&quot;. These are the only two regions considered &quot;above&quot; DO status.

DO – &quot;denominación de origin&quot;, the mainstay of Spain&#x27;s wine quality control system. Each region is governed by a &quot;consejo regulador&quot;, which decides on the boundaries of the region, permitted varietals, maximum yields, limits of alcoholic strength and other quality standards or production limitations pertaining to the zone.

VP – &quot;vino de pago&quot; (&#x27;estate wine&#x27;), a special term for high-quality, single-estate wines (&quot;pago&quot; is a Spanish term for a vineyard estate) which in some cases also have DO or VC or IGP appellations. This category was formed in 2003.

VC – &quot;vino de Calidad con indicación geográfica&quot; (&#x27;quality wine with geographic indication&#x27;), a category formed in 2003 along with VP. The VC category is used for wines that do not fully meet the stringent standards of the DO category, but are above the standards of the IGP category. 

IGP – &quot;indicación geográfica protegida&quot; (protected geographical indication (PGI)). This is part of the EU PGI scheme, which includes wines below the DOP level, and is wine originating from a specific place, a region or a country, which has a certain quality, reputation or other characteristic - including production phases - that can be essentially attributed to its geographical origin, at least one of which takes place in the defined geographical area. These can use the traditional term Vino de la Tierra (VT).

VdM – &quot;vino de mesa&quot; (&#x27;table wine&#x27;), the catch-all at the bottom of the pyramid, for all wine from unclassified vineyards, and wine that has been declassified by blending. This includes both inexpensive jug wines and some expensive wines that are not yet classified due to innovation outside traditional lines.

The two DOCa/DOQ regions are Priorat (Tarragona) and Rioja, the two highest-regarded wine-producing regions in Spain, which carry the special &quot;denominación de origen calificada&quot;.

The more prominent DO regions include:
* Campo de Borja (Zaragoza) – features a number of cooperatives that produce Garnacha and Tempranillo.
* Málaga and Sierras de Málaga (Málaga) – Sierras de Málaga is in effect a sub-appellation of the Málaga DO, traditionally known for its liquor wines and sweet wines.
* Montilla – Moriles (Córdoba) – produces mainly sweet dessert wines using similar techniques to those used for the production of sherry.
* Navarra (Navarre) – a neighbour of the Rioja, the Navarra DO region used to be renowned only for its rosado wines but in recent years has been producing quality reds and whites as well.
* Penedès (Barcelona) – notable not only for the production of the sparkling wine Cava, but red wines from Tempranillo, Garnacha, and Cariñena grapes.
* Rías Baixas (Galicia) – known for its Albarino varietals, Spain&#x27;s most popular white wine. Other whites grown here include Treixadura, Loureira, Caino blanco, and Torrontes. Popular red grapes in this region include Caino Tinto and Sousón.
* Ribera del Duero (Castile and León) – challenges Rioja for the most popular red wines produced in Spain. Almost all of its wines are made from the Tempranillo grape.
* Rueda (Castile and León) – located west of Ribera del Duero, producing reds and whites, typically less expensive than those of its more famous neighbours.
* Jerez (Xérès) (Cádiz) – source of the English term &quot;sherry&quot;, a fortified wine that can either be dry or sweet.
* Toro (Castile and León) – located between the provinces of Zamora and Valladolid, along the river Duero, producing reds such as Tinta de Toro, the local name for Tempranillo.

===Sherry / Jerez===
Along with the DO appellations, the Jerez-Xérès-Sherry DO of Spain uses the following categories:
* VOS – Latin: (and sometimes mistaken to stand for &quot;very old sherry&quot; by English speakers) – applies to sherries with an average age of at least 20 years.
* VORS - &quot; Vinum Optimu Rare Signatum&quot;, sometimes anglicized as Very Old Rare Sherry

<text>Matthew Raymond Dillon (born February 18, 1964) is an American actor. He has received various accolades, including an Academy Award nomination and Grammy nomination.

Dillon made his feature film debut in &quot;Over the Edge&quot; (1979) and established himself as a teen idol by starring in the films &quot;My Bodyguard&quot; (1980), &quot;Little Darlings&quot; (1980), &quot;Liar&#x27;s Moon&quot; (1982), &quot;The Flamingo Kid&quot; (1984) and three of the four S. E. Hinton book adaptations: &quot;Tex&quot; (1982), &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1983). From the late 1980s onward, Dillon achieved further success, starring in &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; (1989), &quot;Singles&quot; (1992), &quot;The Saint of Fort Washington&quot; (1993), &quot;To Die For&quot; (1995), &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; (1996), &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (1997), &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; (1998), and &quot;Wild Things&quot; (1998). In a 1991 article, movie critic Roger Ebert referred to him as the best actor within his age group, along with Sean Penn.

In 2002, he made his directing debut with &quot;City of Ghosts&quot; and has since continued to act in films such as &quot;Factotum&quot; (2005), &quot;You, Me and Dupree&quot; (2006), &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot; (2018), and &quot;Asteroid City&quot; (2023). For &quot;Crash&quot; (2004), he won an Independent Spirit Award and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He had earlier been nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for narrating Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot;. On television, he starred in the first season of the FOX television series &quot;Wayward Pines&quot; (2015), for which he was nominated for a Saturn Award.

==Early life==
Dillon was raised in a close-knit Roman Catholic family of Irish descent in Mamaroneck, New York by homemaker Mary Ellen and Paul Dillon, a portrait painter and sales manager for toy bear manufacturer Union Camp. Paul Dillon also was the long-time golf coach at Fordham University, having been enshrined in the school&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2019. Dillon is the second of six children with one sister and four brothers, one of whom is actor Kevin Dillon. His paternal grandmother was the sister of comic strip artist Alex Raymond, the creator of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;.

==Career==

In 1978, Jane Bernstein and a friend were helping director Jonathan Kaplan cast the teen drama &quot;Over the Edge&quot; when they found Dillon cutting class at Hommocks Middle School in Larchmont. Dillon auditioned for a role and made his debut in the film. The film received a regional, limited theatrical release in May 1979, and grossed only slightly over $200,000. Dillon&#x27;s performance was well-received, which led to his casting in two films released the following year: the teenage sex comedy &quot;Little Darlings&quot;, in which Kristy McNichol&#x27;s character loses her virginity to a boy from the camp across the lake, played by Dillon, and the more serious teen dramedy &quot;My Bodyguard&quot;, where he played a high-school bully opposite Chris Makepeace. The films, released in March and July 1980, respectively, were box office successes and raised Dillon&#x27;s profile among teen audiences.

Another of Dillon&#x27;s early roles was in the Jean Shepherd PBS special &quot;The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters&quot;. The only available copies of this film are stored at UCLA, where a legal dispute makes it unavailable to the public.

One of his next roles was in &quot;Liar&#x27;s Moon&quot;, where he played Jack Duncan, a poor Texas boy madly in love with a rich banker&#x27;s daughter. In the early 1980s, Dillon also had prominent roles in three adaptations of S. E. Hinton novels: &quot;Tex&quot; (1982), &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1983) and &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; (1983). All three films were shot in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Hinton&#x27;s hometown. &quot;The Outsiders&quot; and &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; had Dillon working with Francis Ford Coppola and Diane Lane. He followed those up with &quot;The Flamingo Kid&quot; in 1984. He made his Broadway debut with the play &quot;The Boys of Winter&quot; in 1985. Dillon did voiceover work in the 1987 documentary film &quot;Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam&quot;. In 1985, Dillon was namechecked in the lyrics of the Roger Daltrey song &#x27;After The Fire&#x27; (written by Pete Townshend). In 1989, Dillon won critical acclaim for his performance as a drug addict in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot;.

Dillon continued to work in the early 1990s with roles in films like &quot;Singles&quot; (1992). He had a resurgence when he played Nicole Kidman&#x27;s husband in &quot;To Die For&quot; (1995), as well as starring roles in &quot;Wild Things&quot; (1998) and &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; (1998), for which he received an MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.

In 2002, he wrote and directed the film &quot;City of Ghosts&quot;, starring himself, James Caan and Gérard Depardieu. In 2005, he starred in &quot;Factotum&quot;, a film adaptation of an autobiographical work by Charles Bukowski. Two years later he received critical praise and earned Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for his role in &quot;Crash&quot;, a film co-written and directed by Paul Haggis. In 2005, Dillon co-starred in Disney&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and on March 11, 2006, hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in which he impersonated Greg Anderson and Rod Serling in sketches.

Dillon starred in the comedy &quot;You, Me and Dupree&quot;, opposite Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson. The film opened on July 14, 2006. On September 29, 2006, Dillon was honored with the Premio Donostia prize in the San Sebastián International Film Festival.

Dillon contributed his voice as the narrator, Sal Paradise, in an audiobook version of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s novel &quot;On the Road&quot;. In 2006, he narrated &quot;Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos&quot;.

Dillon appeared in several music videos during his career. He made a cameo appearance as a detective in Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Bad Girl&quot; music video which also stars Christopher Walken. Dillon appeared in 1987 in the music video for &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; by the Irish folk-punk band The Pogues, playing a cop who escorts lead singer Shane MacGowan into the &quot;drunk tank&quot;. In 2007, the band Dinosaur Jr. hired Dillon to direct the video for their single &quot;Been There All The Time&quot; from the album &quot;Beyond&quot;. That year, he guest-starred on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Midnight Towboy&quot;. Early in 2015, he played the role of a Secret Service agent in the FOX 10-episode series &quot;Wayward Pines&quot;.

In 2018, Dillon played the lead role in the Lars von Trier thriller &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot;.

<text>In baseball, a switch hitter is a player who bats both right-handed and left-handed, usually right-handed against left-handed pitchers and left-handed against right-handed pitchers, although there are some exceptions.

==Characteristics==
Right-handed batters generally hit better against left-handed pitchers and &quot;vice versa&quot;. Most curveballs break away from batters hitting from the same side as the opposing pitcher, making them harder to hit with the barrel (or &quot;sweet spot&quot;) of the bat. Additionally, the pitcher&#x27;s release is further from the batter&#x27;s center of vision. In the words of Pat Venditte, one of the few ambidextrous pitchers in major-league history, &quot;If I&#x27;m pitching right-handed and they&#x27;re hitting right-handed, it&#x27;s tougher for them to see. And then, your breaking pitches are going away from their barrel rather than into their barrel.&quot; Even so, many switch-hitters perform better from one side of the plate than the other.

Numerous switch-hitters have achieved a higher batting average on one side of the plate, but hit with more power from the other. For instance, New York Yankees great Mickey Mantle always considered himself a better right-handed hitter, but hit home runs at a higher rate from the left side of the plate. However, many of Mantle&#x27;s left-handed home runs were struck at Yankee Stadium, a park notorious for being very friendly to left-handed power hitters due to its short right field porch, and Mantle batted left-handed much more often than right-handed, simply because there have always been more right-handed than left-handed pitchers. Mantle&#x27;s longest home run, a 565-foot clout in 1953 at Washington&#x27;s Griffith Stadium, came batting right-handed.

Most switch-hitters have been right-handed throwers, but there have been several notable switch-hitters who threw left-handed, including Cool Papa Bell, Lance Berkman, Dave Collins, Doug Dascenzo, Mitch Webster, Wes Parker, Melky Cabrera, Nick Swisher, Justin Smoak, Michael Toglia, David Segui, Dylan Carlson, Daniel Nava, and J. T. Snow (who, in the final years of his career, hit exclusively left-handed). As of the 2018 season, there were 48 active switch-hitters on MLB rosters. Five of the league&#x27;s 30 teams did not have a switch hitter on their roster in 2018.

== History ==
The first switch-hitter in baseball history was Bob Ferguson. His switch-hitting was different that of today&#x27;s baseball game, as he switched sides simply based on his feeling at a particular moment or certain situational reasons (such as an elite fielder on one side of the diamond). Ferguson took a notable at-bat in 1870, where he walked off the game while batting from the left side, when he had typically batted right-handed.

Switch hitters were not productive in the dead-ball era or the early live-ball era. Since the advent of the live-ball era, switch hitters have served to produce a high on-base percentage.

== Switch-hitting pitchers ==
While pitchers batting has become increasingly rare with the adoption of the designated hitter by the American League in 1973 and by the National League in 2022, there have been some major-league pitchers who could bat from either side of the plate. These include: Mordecai Brown, Norm Charlton, Marvin Rotblatt, Sid Monge, Johnny Vander Meer, J.C. Romero, Kyle Snyder, Wandy Rodriguez, Troy Patton, Tim Dillard, Tyler Johnson, Carlos Zambrano, Dock Ellis, Vida Blue, Anthony Claggett, Kris Medlen, Justin De Fratus, Drew Storen, Kenley Jansen, Derek Holland, Turk Wendell, Pat Neshek, Adam Ottavino, Ken Waldichuk, and Dylan Bundy.

Joaquín Andújar sometimes hit right-handed against lefties, sometimes left-handed. Tomo Ohka batted left-handed against right-handed pitchers in three games in 2006, but otherwise batted exclusively right-handed. Left-handed reliever Steve Kline was primarily a switch hitter, but batted right-handed against right-handed pitchers several times throughout his career. Management also had a say in the switch-hitting careers of Bob Gibson and Dwight Gooden. Both Gibson and Gooden (each right-handed and capable batters) had reached the major leagues as a switch hitter, but their teams required them to bat only right-handed to reduce the possibility of their pitching arms being hit by a pitch.

Switch-hitting pitchers should not be confused with the term &quot;switch pitcher&quot; referring to a player who can pitch both right-handed and left-handed, which is very uncommon.

==Notable switch hitters==

* Roger Connor – All-time home run champion before Babe Ruth. 
* Mickey Mantle – The all-time home run leader among switch-hitters, a first-ballot Hall of Famer.
* Chipper Jones – Also a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the most recent of only two switch-hitters with extended MLB careers (5,000 at-bats or more) to have a career batting average of .300 from each side of home plate.
* Eddie Murray – Hall of Famer and the only other switch-hitter (apart from Mantle) with 500 career homers. Also, is one of two switch hitters (Pete Rose being the other) with 3,000 or more hits.
* Frankie Frisch – Another Hall of Famer, and the only other switch-hitter with an extended career to hit .300 from each side of home plate.
* Pete Rose – The all-time career hits leader in MLB. Currently barred from Hall of Fame consideration due to his betting on baseball.
* Bill Mueller – Only player in MLB history to hit a grand slam from each side of the plate in the same game.
* Jimmy Rollins – Phillies all-time career leader in hits and doubles, 2007 National League MVP and Silver Slugger, 3 time All-Star and 4 time Gold Glover.
* Ozzie Smith – Hall of Fame shortstop (Padres, Cardinals) who did not hit a home run left-handed until his game-winning blast in Game 5 of the 1985 National League Championship Series, his 3,009th career at-bat (including postseason) from the left side.
* Jason Varitek – Became the first player in MLB history to catch four no-hitters (later tied by Carlos Ruiz in 2015).

<text>A highwayman was a robber who stole from travellers. This type of thief usually travelled and robbed by horse as compared to a footpad who travelled and robbed on foot; mounted highwaymen were widely considered to be socially superior to footpads. Such criminals operated until the mid- or late 19th century. Highwaywomen, such as Katherine Ferrers, were said to also exist, often dressing as men, especially in fiction.

The first attestation of the word &quot;highwayman&quot; is from 1617. Euphemisms such as &quot;knights of the road&quot; and &quot;gentlemen of the road&quot; were sometimes used by people interested in romanticizing (with a Robin Hood–esque slant) what was often an especially violent form of stealing. In the 19th-century American West, highwaymen were sometimes known as road agents. In Australia, they were known as bushrangers.

==Robbing==
The great age of highwaymen was the period from the Restoration in 1660 to the death of Queen Anne in 1714. Some are known to have been disbanded soldiers, and even officers, of the English Civil War and French wars. What favoured them most was the lack of governance and absence of a police force: parish constables were almost entirely ineffective, while detection and arrest were very difficult. Most of the highwaymen held up travellers and took their money. Some had channels by which they could dispose of bills of exchange. Others had a &#x27;racket&#x27; on the road transport of an extensive district; carriers regularly paid them a ransom to go unmolested.

They often attacked coaches for their lack of protection, including public stagecoaches; the postboys who carried the mail were also frequently held up. The demand to &quot;!&quot; (sometimes in forms such as &quot;Stand and deliver your purse!&quot; &quot;Stand and deliver your money!&quot;) was in use from the 17th century to the 19th century:

The phrase &quot;Your money or your life!&quot; is mentioned in trial reports from the mid-18th century:

Victims of highwaymen included the Prime Minister Lord North, who wrote in 1774: &quot;I was robbed last night as I expected, our loss was not great, but as the postilion did not stop immediately one of the two highwaymen fired at him (They had guns at the time) – It was at the end of Gunnersbury Lane.&quot; Horace Walpole, who was shot at in Hyde Park, wrote that &quot;One is forced to travel, even at noon, as if one was going to battle.&quot; During this period, crime was rife and encounters with highwaymen or women could be bloody if the victim attempted to resist. The historian Roy Porter described the use of direct, physical action as a hallmark of public and political life: &quot;From the rough-house of the crowd to the dragoons&#x27; musket volley, violence was as English as plum pudding. Force was used not just criminally, but as a matter of routine to achieve social and political goals, smudging hard-and-fast distinctions between the worlds of criminality and politics... Highwaymen were romanticized, with a hidden irony, as &#x27;gentlemen of the road.&#x27;&quot;

==Robbers as heroes==
There is a long history of treating highway robbers as heroes. They were admired by many as bold men who confronted their victims face to face and were ready to fight for what they wanted. Medieval outlaw Robin Hood is regarded as an English folk hero. Later robber heroes included the Cavalier highwayman James Hind; the French-born gentleman highwayman Claude Du Vall; John Nevison; Dick Turpin; Sixteen String Jack; William Plunkett and his partner, the &quot;Gentleman Highwayman&quot; James MacLaine; the Slovak Juraj Jánošík; and Indians including Kayamkulam Kochunni, Veerappan, and Phoolan Devi. In the same way, the Puerto Rican pirate Roberto Cofresí also came to be venerated as a hero.

===British-ruled Ireland===
In the 17th to the early 19th centuries in Ireland, acts of robbery were often part of a tradition of Irish resistance to the English and British authorities and the Protestant Ascendancy. From the mid-17th century onwards, highwaymen who harassed the English authorities were known as &#x27;tories&#x27; (from Irish &quot;tóraidhe&quot;, raider; &quot;tóraí&quot; in modern spelling). Later that century, they became known as rapparees. Their ranks included James Freney, Redmond O&#x27;Hanlon, Willy Brennan and Jeremiah Grant.

==Dangerous places==
English highwaymen often laid in wait on the main roads radiating from London. They usually chose lonely areas of heathland or woodland. Hounslow Heath was a favourite haunt: it was crossed by the roads to Bath and Exeter. Bagshot Heath in Surrey was another dangerous place on the road to Exeter. One of the most notorious places in England was Shooter&#x27;s Hill on the Great Dover Road. Finchley Common, on the Great North Road, was nearly as bad.

To the south of London, highwaymen sought to attack wealthy travellers on the roads leading to and from the Channel ports and aristocratic arenas like Epsom, which became a fashionable spa town in 1620, and Banstead Downs where horse races and sporting events became popular with the elite from 1625. Later in the 18th century the road from London to Reigate and Brighton through Sutton attracted highwaymen. Commons and heaths considered to be dangerous included Blackheath, Putney Heath, Streatham Common, Mitcham Common, Thornton Heath – also the site of a gallows known as &quot;Hangman&#x27;s Acre&quot; or &quot;Gallows Green&quot; – Sutton Common, Banstead Downs and Reigate Heath.

During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, highwaymen in Hyde Park were sufficiently common for King William III to have the route between St James&#x27;s Palace and Kensington Palace (Rotten Row) lit at night with oil lamps as a precaution against them. This made it the first artificially lit highway in Britain.

==Executions==

The penalty for robbery with violence was hanging, and most notorious English highwaymen ended on the gallows. The chief place of execution for London and Middlesex was Tyburn Tree. Highwaymen whose lives ended there include Claude Du Vall, James MacLaine, and Sixteen-string Jack. Highwaymen who went to the gallows laughing and joking, or at least showing no fear, are said to have been admired by many of the people who came to watch.

==Decline==
During the 18th century, French rural roads were generally safer from highwaymen than those of England, an advantage credited by the historian Alexis de Tocqueville to the existence of a uniformed and disciplined mounted constabulary known as the Maréchaussée. In England this force was often confused with the regular army and as such cited as an instrument of royal tyranny not to be imitated.
In England, the causes of the decline are more controversial. After about 1815, mounted robbers are recorded only rarely, the last recorded robbery by a mounted highwayman having occurred in 1831. The decline in highwayman activity also occurred during the period in which repeating handguns, notably the pepper-box and the percussion revolver, became increasingly available and affordable to the average citizen. The development of the railways is sometimes cited as a factor, but highwaymen were already obsolete before the railway network was built. The expansion of the system of turnpikes, manned and gated toll-roads, made it all but impossible for a highwayman to escape notice while making his getaway, but he could easily avoid such systems and use other roads, almost all of which outside the cities were flanked by open country.

Cities such as London were becoming much better policed: in 1805 a body of mounted police began to patrol the districts around the city at night. London was growing rapidly, and some of the most dangerous open spaces near the city, such as Finchley Common, were being covered with buildings. However, this only moved the robbers&#x27; operating area further out, to the new exterior of an expanded city, and does not therefore explain decline. A greater use of banknotes, more traceable than gold coins, also made life more difficult for robbers, but the Inclosure Act 1773 was followed by a sharp decline in highway robberies; stone walls falling over the open range like a net, confined the escaping highwaymen to the roads themselves, which now had walls on both sides and were better patrolled.
The dramatic population increase which began with the Industrial Revolution also meant, quite simply, that there were more eyes around, and the concept of remote place became a thing of the past in England.

==Outside Anglophone countries==
===Greece===
The bandits in Greece under Ottoman rule were the Klephts (κλέφτες), Greeks who had taken refuge in the inaccessible mountains. The klephts, who acted as a guerilla force, were instrumental in the Greek War of Independence.

===Kingdom of Hungary===
The highwaymen of the 17th- to 19-century Kingdom of Hungary were the &quot;betyárs&quot; (Slovak: &quot;zbojník&quot;). Until the 1830s, they were mainly simply regarded as criminals but an increasing public appetite for betyar songs, ballads and stories gradually gave a romantic image to these armed and usually mounted robbers. Several of the betyárs have become legendary figures who in the public mind fought for social justice. Hungarian betyárs included Jóska Sobri, Márton Vidróczki, András Juhász, Bandi Angyal, Pista Sisa, Jóska Savanyú. Juraj Jánošík (), who was born and operated in Upper Hungary (now Slovakia), is still regarded as the Slovak version, and Sándor Rózsa the Hungarian version of Robin Hood in their regions. 

The Hajduk (Hungarian: Hajdú) also originated in Hungary. They were formed from large numbers of Hungarians forced out of Syrmia and the Banates (Banate of Srebrenik, Banate of Nándorfehérvár, Banat of Macsó), moving upwards to central Hungary because of the Turkish attacks (they are replaced by the Serbs, Bosnians and Croats settling in the region). By the end of the 16th century, they had developed into a significant military force. They developed their own military organisation, separate from the ranks established in the country – they chose their own commanders, captains, lieutenants and corporals. Their rights were later taken away by the Austrians after the defeat of the Rákóczi&#x27;s War of Independence, fearing their military power, they forced them into serfdom, so this was the end of the Hajduk golden age.

===India===
The Indian Subcontinent has had a long and documented history of organised robbery for millennia. These included the Thuggees, a quasi-religious group that robbed travellers on Indian roads until the cult was systematically eradicated in the mid-1800s by British colonial administrators. Thugees would befriend large road caravans and gain their confidence, before strangling them to death and robbing their valuables. According to some estimates the Thuggees murdered a million people between 1740 and 1840. More generally, armed bands known colloquially as &quot;dacoits&quot; have long wreaked havoc on many parts of the country. In recent times this has often served as a way to fund various regional and political insurgencies that includes the Maoist Naxalite movement. Kayamkulam Kochunni was also a famed highwayman who was active in Central Travancore in the early 19th century. Along with his close friend Ithikkarappkki from the nearby Ithikkara village, he is said to have stolen from the rich and given to the poor. With the help of an Ezhava warrior called Arattupuzha Velayudha Panicker, Kochunni was arrested and sent to Poojappura Central Jail. Legends of his works are compiled in folklore and are still read and heard today.

===The Balkans and eastern Europe===
The bandits in Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia and Bulgaria under Ottoman rule, and in Hungary were the Hajduks (Hajduci, Хајдуци, Хайдути) – rebels who opposed Ottoman rule and acted as a guerilla force, also instrumental in the many wars against the Ottomans, especially the Serbian revolution. Serbian and Croatian refugees in Austro-Hungarian (and Habsburg) lands were also part of the Uskoci. Notable freedom fighters include Starina Novak, a notable outlaw was Jovo Stanisavljević Čaruga.
In medieval Wallachia, Moldavia, Transylvania and Ukraine, the Haiduks (Romanian – Haiduci, Ukrainian – Гайдуки, &quot;Haiduky&quot;) were bandits and deserters who lived in forests and robbed local Boyars or other travelers along roads. Sometimes they would help the poor peasants. In the 1800s, betyárs became common in Hungary.

==Literature and popular culture==

In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; Falstaff is a highwayman, and part of the action of the play concerns a robbery committed by him and his companions. Another highwayman in English drama is Captain Macheath, hero of John Gay&#x27;s 18th-century ballad opera &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;. The legend of Dick Turpin was significantly boosted by &quot;Rookwood&quot; (1834), in which a heavily fictionalised Turpin is one of the main characters. Alfred Noyes&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;The Highwayman&quot; has been immensely popular ever since its publication in 1906.

A number of traditional folk songs about highwaymen exist, both positive and negative, such as &quot;Young Morgan&quot;, &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;, and &quot;The Wild Colonial Boy&quot;.

From the early 18th century, collections of short stories of highwaymen and other notorious criminals became very popular. The earliest of these is Captain Alexander Smith&#x27;s &quot;Complete History of the Lives and Robberies of the Most Notorious Highwaymen&quot; (1714). Some later collections of this type had the words The Newgate Calendar in their titles and this has become a general name for this kind of publication.

In the later 19th century, highwaymen such as Dick Turpin were the heroes of a number of penny dreadfuls, stories for boys published in serial form. In the 20th century the handsome highwayman became a stock character in historical love romances, including books by Baroness Orczy and Georgette Heyer.

Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s romance &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot; (1818) recounts the heroine waylaid by highwaymen while travelling from Scotland to London.

&quot;Ronia, the Robber&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1981) is a children&#x27;s fantasy book by Astrid Lindgren, which portrays the adventures of Ronia, the daughter of the leader of a gang of highwaymen.

===Comics===
The Belgian comics series &quot;&quot; by Turk and De Groot is a gag-a-day series about Robin Hood&#x27;s attempts at robbing travellers in the forest.

The Dutch comics series &quot;Gilles de Geus&quot; by Hanco Kolk and Peter de Wit was originally a gag-a-day about a failed highwayman called Gilles, but the character later evolved into a resistance fighter with the Geuzen against the Spanish army.

&quot;Ithikkara Pakki&quot;, a graphic children&#x27;s story book about the Indian highwayman Ithikkara Pakki, was published in April 2010 in Malayalam. The life of the Indian highwayman Kayamkulam Kochunni was adapted as a comic by Radha M. Nair in the 794th issue of the Indian comic book series, Amar Chitra Katha.

===Music===
There were many broadsheet ballads about highwaymen; these were often written to be sold on the occasion of a famous robber&#x27;s execution. A number of highwaymen ballads have remained current in oral tradition in England and Ireland.

The traditional Irish song &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; tells the story of an Irish highwayman who robs an army captain and includes the lines &quot;I first produced me pistol, then I drew me rapier. Said &#x27;Stand and deliver, for you are a bold deceiver&#x27;.&quot; The hit single version recorded in 1973 by Irish rock band Thin Lizzy renders this last line &quot;I said &#x27;Stand-oh and deliver, or the devil he may take ya&#x27;.&quot;

The traditional Irish song &quot;The Newry Highwayman&quot; recounts the deeds and death of a highwayman who robbed &quot;the lords and ladies bright&quot;. The traditional Irish song &quot;Brennan on the Moor&quot; describes an escapade of the &quot;bold, undaunted robber&quot;. Adam and the Ants had a number one song for five weeks in 1981 in the UK with &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;. The video featured Adam Ant as an English highwayman.

The contemporary folk song &quot;On the Road to Fairfax County&quot; by David Massengill, recorded by The Roches and by Joan Baez, recounts a romantic encounter between a highwayman and his female victim. In the end, the highwayman is hanged over the objections of his victim.

Musician Jimmy Webb penned and recorded a song entitled &quot;Highwayman&quot; in 1977 about a soul with incarnations in four different places in time and history, a highwayman, a sailor, a construction worker on the Hoover Dam, and finally as a star ship captain. Glen Campbell recorded a version of the song in 1978, but the most popular incarnation of the song was recorded by Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash in 1984, who as a group called themselves The Highwaymen.

The Canadian singer Loreena McKennit adapted the narrative poem, &quot;The Highwayman&quot; written by Alfred Noyes, as a song by the same title in her 1997 album The Book of Secrets.

===Cinema and television===
The Carry On films included a highwayman spoof in &quot;Carry On Dick&quot; (1974). Monty Python sent up the highwayman legends in the Dennis Moore sketch in Episode 37 of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, in which John Cleese played the titular criminal who stole only lupins. In a linking sketch in an episode of &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; a highwayman holds up a stagecoach with pistols – in order to wash the coach in exchange for small monies in the manner of a modern-day unsolicited car window washer in traffic. In &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;, Mr. E. Blackadder turns highwayman in the episode &quot;Amy and Amiability&quot;. In the British children&#x27;s television series &quot;Dick Turpin&quot;, starring Richard O&#x27;Sullivan, the highwayman was depicted as an 18th-century Robin Hood figure. Additionally the actor Mathew Baynton played Dick Turpin in &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;. A singing highwayman appears in the fourth episode of the animated mini-series, &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot;, &quot;Songs of the Dark Lantern&quot;.

The highwayman known as Juraj Jánošík (1688–1713) became a hero of many folk legends in the Slovak, Czech, and Polish cultures by the 19th century and hundreds of literary works about him have since been published. The first Slovak feature film was &quot;Jánošík&quot;, made in 1921, followed by seven more Slovak and Polish films about him.

&quot;Curro Jiménez&quot;, a Spanish TV series which aired from 1976 to 1979, starred a group of 19th-century highwaymen or &quot;bandoleros&quot; in the mountains of Ronda in the south of Spain.

&quot;Ronia, the Robber&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (aka &quot;Ronja Robbersdaughter&quot; in the US) is a 1984 Swedish fantasy film, based on the 1981 novel of the same title by Astrid Lindgren, and narrating the adventures of Ronia, the daughter of the leader of a gang of highwaymen.

&quot;Ronja, the Robber&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (Japanese: 山賊の娘ローニャ, Hepburn: &quot;Sanzoku no Musume Rōnya&quot;) is a Japanese animated television series, also based on Lindgren&#x27;s novel &quot;Ronia, the Robber&#x27;s Daughter,&quot; and directed and storyboarded by Gorō Miyazaki.

The lives of numerous Indian highwaymen including Arattupuzha Velayudha Panicker, Ithikkara Pakki, Jambulingam Nadar, Kayamkulam Kochunni and Papadu have been adapted for cinema and television multiple times.

Season two, episode 20, of Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, the main villain (voiced by James Marsters) disguises himself as a highwayman.

===Video games===
In &quot;Fable II&quot;, Highwaymen appear as an elite type of enemy which works alongside bandits and makes use of speed and agility over brute strength. It is also possible for players to dress as Highwaymen. There is an enemy type in &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot; called the &quot;bandit highwayman&quot; that acts as one of the higher-level bandit enemies. In &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; one can encounter the Defias Highwaymen, the strongest members of the Defias Brotherhood. In &quot;Darkest Dungeon&quot; the Highwayman is a class of hero who wields a dirk and flintlock to fight. In &quot;Runescape&quot;, highwaymen attack lower-leveled players on a route between two cities. In &quot;Bushido Blade 2&quot; there is a playable character named Highwayman who is dressed in Victorian clothing and represents the hero archetype. In &quot;Bloodborne&quot; many articles of clothing obtained by &quot;The Hunter&quot; are inspired by Highwaymen attire.
