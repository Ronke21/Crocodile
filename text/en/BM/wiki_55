<text>George Homer Ryan (born February 24, 1934) is an American former politician who served as the 39th governor of Illinois from 1999 to 2003. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as secretary of State of Illinois from 1991 to 1999 and as lieutenant governor from 1983 to 1991. He was later convicted of federal racketeering, bribery, extortion, money laundering and tax fraud stemming from his time in office.

Ryan was elected governor in 1998, narrowly defeating Democratic Congressman Glenn Poshard. He received national attention for his 2000 moratorium on executions in Illinois and for commuting more than 160 death sentences to life sentences in 2003. He chose not to run for reelection in 2002 amid a scandal. He was later convicted of federal corruption charges stemming from the illegal sale of commercial drivers licenses which resulted in the deaths of six children while serving as secretary of state and spent more than five years in federal prison and seven months of home confinement. He was released from federal prison on July 3, 2013.

==Early life==
George Homer Ryan was born in Maquoketa, Iowa to Jeannette (née Bowman) and Thomas Ryan, a pharmacist. Ryan grew up in Kankakee County, Illinois. After serving in the U.S. Army in Korea, he worked for his father&#x27;s two drugstores. He attended Ferris State College of Pharmacy (now Ferris State University) in Big Rapids, Michigan. Eventually, he built his father&#x27;s pair of pharmacies into a successful family-run chain (profiting from lucrative government-contract business selling prescription drugs to nursing homes) which he sold in 1990.
Ryan was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1954. He served a 13-month tour in Korea, working in a base pharmacy.

On June 10, 1956, Ryan married his high school sweetheart, Lura Lynn Lowe (July 5, 1934 – June 27, 2011), whom he had met in a high school English class. She grew up in Aroma Park, where her family (originally from Germany) had lived since 1834. Her father owned one of the first hybrid seed companies in the United States. The couple had five daughters (including a set of triplets); Julie, Joanne, Jeanette, Lynda and Nancy; and one son, George Homer Ryan, Jr.

Lura Lowe died of lung cancer at Riverside Hospital in Kankakee on June 27, 2011. Ryan&#x27;s brother, Tom, was a prominent political figure in Kankakee County. In addition, Ryan&#x27;s sister Kathleen Dean&#x27;s former son-in-law, Bruce Clark, is the Kankakee County, Illinois Clerk.

==Early political career==
Ryan began his political career by serving on the Kankakee County Board from 1968 to 1973 (his brother Tom J. Ryan was Mayor of Kankakee for 20 years from 1965 to 1985). He was then elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1972, where he served five terms. In 1976, he was elected House Minority Leader. As Minority Leader, Ryan led Republicans to win a 91-86 majority in the House in 1980; he was subsequently elected Speaker in January 1981. 
In July 1981, Dave O&#x27;Neal, the lieutenant governor under Republican Governor James R. Thompson, resigned unexpectedly. To fill in the vacancy left by O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s resignation, Thompson selected Ryan to be his running mate in the 1982 election. The Thompson/Ryan ticket narrowly defeated the Democratic ticket of Adlai Stevenson III and Grace Stern. Thompson and Ryan were both reelected to their positions in 1986. In 1990, Ryan was elected Secretary of State of Illinois. During his first term as Secretary of State, then–State Treasurer Pat Quinn was publicly critical of Ryan, specifically drawing attention to special vanity license plates that Ryan&#x27;s office provided for clout-hungry motorists. This rivalry led Quinn in a failed bid to challenge Ryan in the 1994 general election for Secretary of State.

==Governor of Illinois==
On August 30, 1997, incumbent governor Jim Edgar announced he would retire after his second term; three days later, Ryan announced his candidacy for governor. He won the Republican nomination with minimal opposition and defeated his opponent, Glenn Poshard, in the general election by a 51–47 percent margin. Ryan&#x27;s running mate was first-term state representative Corinne Wood. Ryan outspent Poshard by a 4-to-1 margin. Poshard, a firm believer in campaign finance reform, placed limits on individual donations and refused to accept donations from corporate or special interests.

One of Ryan&#x27;s pet projects as governor was an extensive repair of the Illinois Highway System called &quot;Illinois FIRST&quot;. FIRST was an acronym for &quot;Fund for Infrastructure, Roads, Schools, and Transit&quot;. Signed into law in May 1999, the law created a $6.3 billion package for use in school and transportation projects. With various matching funds programs, Illinois FIRST provided $2.2 billion for schools, $4.1 billion for public transportation, another $4.1 billion for roads, and $1.6 billion for other projects. He also improved Illinois&#x27;s technology infrastructure, creating one of the first cabinet-level Offices of Technology in the country and bringing up Illinois&#x27;s technology ranking in a national magazine from 48th out of the 50 states when he took office to 1st just two years later. Ryan committed record funding to education, including 51% of all new state revenues during his time in office, in addition to the billions spent through Illinois FIRST that built and improved schools and education infrastructure. In 1999, Ryan sparked controversy by becoming the first sitting U.S. Governor to meet with Cuban President Fidel Castro. Ryan&#x27;s visit led to a $1 million donation of humanitarian aid, but drew criticism from anti-Castro groups. In 2000, Ryan served as a chair of the Midwestern Governors Association.

===Capital punishment===
Ryan helped to renew the national debate on capital punishment when, as governor, he declared a moratorium on his state&#x27;s death penalty on January 31, 2000.

This decision was heavily influenced by lawsuits filed by exonerated prisoners who made false confessions as a result of police torture under the direction of a police commander named Jon Burge. &quot;We have now freed more people than we have put to death under our system,&quot; he said. &quot;There is a flaw in the system, without question, and it needs to be studied.&quot; At the time, Illinois had executed 12 people since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1977, with one execution, that of Ripper Crew member Andrew Kokoraleis, occurring early during Ryan&#x27;s term. Ryan refused to meet with religious leaders and others regarding &quot;a stay of execution&quot; in light of the impending &#x27;moratorium&#x27; and other facts relative to the &#x27;flawed&#x27; capital punishment system in Illinois; in fact, under Ryan&#x27;s governorship, 13 people were released from jail after appealing their convictions based on new evidence. Ryan called for a commission to study the issue, while noting, &quot;I still believe the death penalty is a proper response to heinous crimes ... But I believe that it has to be where we don&#x27;t put innocent people to death.&quot;

The issue had garnered the attention of the public when a death row inmate, Anthony Porter, who had spent 15 years on death row, was within two days of being executed when his lawyers won a stay on the grounds that he may have been mentally disabled. He was ultimately exonerated with the help of a group of student journalists at Northwestern University who had uncovered evidence that was used to prove his innocence. In 1999, Porter was released, charges were subsequently dropped, and another person, Alstory Simon, confessed and pleaded guilty to the crime of which Porter had been erroneously convicted. Simon himself was later released after serving fifteen years for the crime, after it was proven that he, too, was wrongfully accused.

On January 11, 2003, just two days before leaving office, Ryan commuted (to &quot;life&quot; terms) the sentences of everyone on or waiting to be sent to Illinois&#x27; death row — a total of 167 convicts — due to his belief that the death penalty could not be administered fairly. He also pardoned four inmates, Aaron Patterson, Madison Hobley and Leroy Orange (all of whom were interrogated by Burge and released), and Stanley Howard. However, Patterson is currently serving 30 years in prison after being arrested for drug trafficking he committed after his release from death row. Howard remains in prison for armed robbery. Ryan declared in his pardon speech that he would have freed Howard if only his attorney had filed a clemency petition; Ryan then strongly urged investigators to examine Howard&#x27;s alleged robbery case, because it appeared to be as tainted as his murder conviction.

These were four of ten death row inmates known as the &quot;Death Row 10,&quot; due to widely reported claims that the confessions that they had given in their respective cases had been coerced through torture. Ryan is not the first state governor to have granted blanket commutations to death row inmates during his final days in office. Arkansas Governor Winthrop Rockefeller also commuted the sentence of every death row inmate in that state as he left office after losing his 1970 bid for a third two-year term, as did New Mexico Governor Toney Anaya before he left office in 1986 and Ohio Governor Dick Celeste before he left office in 1990.

Ryan won praise from death penalty opponents: as early as 2001, he received the Mario Cuomo Act of Courage Award from Death Penalty Focus, in 2003 the Rose Elizabeth Bird Commitment to Justice Award from the same organization. On the other side of the Atlantic, Robert Badinter, who had successfully introduced the bill abolishing the death penalty in France in 1981 praised Ryan&#x27;s decision. Many conservatives, though, were opposed to the commutations, some questioning his motives, which came as a federal corruption investigation closed in on the governor and his closest political allies (see below). Conservative columnist Pat Buchanan called Ryan &quot;pathetic&quot;, and suggested the governor was attempting to save his public image in hopes of avoiding prison himself. Buchanan noted &quot;Ryan announced his decision to a wildly cheering crowd at the Northwestern University Law School. Families of the victims of the soon-to-be-reprieved killers were not invited.&quot;

==Scandals, trial, and conviction==
Ryan&#x27;s political career was marred by a scandal called &quot;Operation Safe Road&quot;, which involved the illegal sale of government licenses, contracts and leases by state employees during his prior service as Secretary of State. In the wake of numerous convictions of his former aides, he chose not to run for reelection in 2002. Seventy-nine former state officials, lobbyists, and others were charged in the investigation, and at least 75 were convicted.

The corruption scandal leading to Ryan&#x27;s downfall began more than a decade earlier during a federal investigation into a deadly crash in Wisconsin. Six children from the Willis family of Chicago, Illinois, were killed; their parents, Rev. Duane and Janet Willis, were severely burned. The investigation revealed a scheme inside Ryan&#x27;s Secretary of State&#x27;s office in which unqualified truck drivers obtained licenses through bribes.

In March 2003, Scott Fawell, Ryan&#x27;s former chief of staff and campaign manager, was convicted on federal charges of racketeering and fraud. He was sentenced to six years and six months. Former deputy campaign manager Richard Juliano pleaded guilty to related charges and testified against Fawell at trial. Roger Stanley, a former Republican state representative who was hired by Ryan and testified against Fawell, pleaded guilty to wide-ranging corruption, admitting he paid kickbacks to win state contracts and campaign business, secretly mailed out vicious false attacks on political opponents and helped obtain ghost-payrolling jobs.

===Indictment===
The investigation finally reached the former governor, and in December 2003, Ryan and lobbyist Lawrence Warner were named in a 22-count federal indictment. The charges included racketeering, bribery, extortion, money laundering and tax fraud. The indictment alleged that Ryan steered several state contracts to Warner and other friends; disbursed campaign funds to relatives and to pay personal expenses; and obstructed justice by attempting to end the state investigation of the license-for-bribes scandal. He was charged with lying to investigators and accepting cash, gifts and loans in return for his official actions as governor. On September 19, 2005, the case went to trial.

Fawell, under pressure from prosecutors, became a key witness against Ryan and Warner. He agreed to a plea deal that cut the prison time for himself and his fiancée, Andrea Coutretsis. Fawell was a controversial witness, not hiding his disdain for prosecutors from the witness stand. According to CBS Chicago political editor Mike Flannery, insiders claimed that Fawell had been &quot;much like a son&quot; to Ryan throughout their careers. At Ryan&#x27;s trial, Fawell acknowledged that the prosecution had his &quot;head in a vise&quot;, and that he found his cooperation with the government against Ryan &quot;the most distasteful thing I&#x27;ve ever done&quot;. Nonetheless, he spent several days on the witness stand testifying against Ryan and Warner. Once a tough-talking political strategist, Fawell wept on the witness stand as he acknowledged that his motivation for testifying was to spare Coutretsis a long prison sentence for her role in the conspiracy. The jury was twice sent out of the courtroom so that he could wipe tears from his eyes and regain his composure.

Ryan&#x27;s daughters and a son-in-law, Michael Fairman, were implicated by testimony during the trial. Stipulations agreed upon by the defense and prosecution and submitted to the court included admissions that all five of Ryan&#x27;s daughters received illegal payments from the Ryan campaign. In addition to Lynda Fairman, who received funds beyond those her husband Michael testified he had received, the stipulations included admissions from the rest of Ryan&#x27;s daughters that they did little or no work in return for the payments. In addition, Fawell testified that Ryan&#x27;s mother&#x27;s housekeeper was illegally paid from campaign funds, and that Ryan&#x27;s adopted sister, Nancy Ferguson, received campaign funds without performing campaign work. The prosecution took nearly four months to present their case, as a parade of other witnesses (including Juliano) followed Fawell.

On April 17, 2006, the jury found Ryan and Warner guilty on all counts. However, when ruling on post-trial motions, the judge dismissed two counts against Ryan for lack of proof. Ryan said that he would appeal the verdict, largely due to the issues with the jury.

Patrick Fitzgerald, the federal prosecutor, noted, &quot;Mr. Ryan steered contracts worth millions of dollars to friends and took payments and vacations in return. When he was a sitting governor, he lied to the FBI about this conduct and then he went out and did it again.&quot; He charged that one of the most egregious aspects of the corruption was Ryan&#x27;s action after learning that bribes were being paid for licenses. Instead of ending the practice he tried to end the investigation that had uncovered it, Fitzgerald said, calling the moment &quot;a low-water mark for public service&quot;.

On September 6, 2006, Ryan was sentenced to six and a half years in prison. He was ordered to go to prison on January 4, 2007, but the appellate court granted an appeal bond, allowing him to remain free pending the outcome of the appeal. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit on August 21, 2007, and review by the entire Seventh Circuit was denied on October 25, 2007. The Seventh Circuit then rejected Ryan&#x27;s bid to remain free while he asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear his case; the opinion called the evidence of Ryan&#x27;s guilt &quot;overwhelming&quot;. The Supreme Court rejected an extension of his bail, and Ryan reported to the Federal Prison Camp in Oxford, Wisconsin, on November 7, 2007. He was transferred on February 29, 2008, to a medium security facility in Terre Haute, Indiana, after Oxford changed its level of medical care and stopped housing inmates over 70 years old. He was listed as Federal Inmate Number 16627-424 and was released on July 3, 2013.

===Defense and appeal===
Ryan&#x27;s defense was provided pro bono by Winston &amp; Strawn, a law firm managed by former governor Jim Thompson. The defense cost the firm $10 million through mid-November 2005. Estimates of the cost to the firm as of September 2006 ranged as high as $20 million. Ryan served as Thompson&#x27;s lieutenant governor from 1983 to 1991. After the United States Supreme Court declined to hear Ryan&#x27;s appeal, Thompson indicated that he would ask then President George W. Bush to commute Ryan&#x27;s sentence to time served. United States Senator Dick Durbin wrote a letter to Bush dated December 1, 2008, asking him to commute Ryan&#x27;s sentence, citing Ryan&#x27;s age and his wife&#x27;s frail health, saying, &quot;This action would not pardon him of his crimes or remove the record of his conviction, but it would allow him to return to his wife and family for their remaining years.&quot; Bush did not commute Ryan&#x27;s sentence.

After his conviction Ryan&#x27;s annual $197,037 state pension was suspended under state law. Ryan&#x27;s attorneys litigated the pension matter all the way to the Illinois Supreme Court, which ruled on February 19, 2010, that state law &quot;plainly mandates that none of the benefits provided for under the system shall be paid to Ryan&quot;. Ryan was paid $635,000 in pension benefits during the three years between his retirement and his political corruption conviction, plus a refund of the $235,500 in personal contributions he made during his 30 years in public office.

===Sentencing===
In 2010, Ryan requested early release, partly because his wife had terminal cancer and was given only six months to live, and partly on the grounds that some of his convictions should be vacated in light of a Supreme Court ruling that was alleged to have affected their legitimacy. On December 21, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer denied Ryan&#x27;s request.

On January 5, 2011, Ryan was taken from his prison cell in Terre Haute, Indiana, to a hospital in Kankakee to visit his dying wife. He was present when she died on June 27, five months after that visit. Ryan entered a Salvation Army halfway house in Chicago on January 30, 2013. Less than three hours later, he was released back to his home in Kankakee where he remained on home confinement until July 3, 2013.

<doc id="418925" wikidata="Q151891" url="?curid=418925" title="Rod Blagojevich">
<text>Rod R. Blagojevich ( ; born December 10, 1956), often referred to by his nickname &quot;Blago&quot;, is an American politician who served as the 40th governor of Illinois from 2003 to 2009. A member of the Democratic Party, Blagojevich previously worked in both the state and federal legislatures. He served as an Illinois state representative from 1993 to 1997, and the U.S. representative from Illinois&#x27;s 5th district from 1997 to 2003.

Born and raised in Chicago, Blagojevich graduated from Northwestern University in 1979 and the Pepperdine University School of Law in 1983. After graduating, he became a criminal prosecutor at the Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney Office during the late 1980s. Turning to elective politics, he represented the 33rd state house district in the Illinois House of Representatives where he supported mostly law and order policies. Forgoing a third two-year term in the state legislature, he represented for six years, winning re-election twice. He was elected Illinois governor in 2002, the first Democrat to win the office since 1972. There was increased public education funding, infrastructure development, and criminal justice reforms during his first term. Blagojevich&#x27;s 2006 reelection to a second term led to the passage of a variety of healthcare, gun control, and anti-discrimination bills.

Starting in December 2008, a federal investigation and trial found Blagojevich guilty of public corruption after he attempted to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama upon his election to the presidency. Much of the evidence against Blagojevich was already publicly known, so even before his federal trial, he was impeached and removed from office in 2009 by the Illinois General Assembly. He was also barred by the Illinois Senate&#x27;s judgement from holding public office of the state ever again. The federal jury also found against him, and for his role in the corruption scandal, he was sentenced to 14 years in federal prison. President Donald Trump formally commuted his sentence in 2020, after Blagojevich had been imprisoned for nearly eight years, and fully pardoned him in 2025. Blagojevich had previously been a contestant on Trump&#x27;s TV show &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice.&quot; Blagojevich subsequently supported Donald Trump&#x27;s 2020 and 2024 presidential campaigns, and attended the 2024 Republican National Convention.

To date, Blagojevich is the only Illinois governor to be successfully impeached and removed from office.

==Early life==
Rod Blagojevich was born in Chicago, Illinois, the second of two sons of Serb immigrants from FPR Yugoslavia. His father, Rade B. Blagojevich, was an immigrant steel plant laborer from a village near Kragujevac, PR Serbia. His mother, Mila, was a Herzegovinian Serb whose family was originally from Gacko, PR Bosnia and Herzegovina. His parents moved to Chicago in 1947. Blagojevich&#x27;s older brother Rob worked as a fund-raiser for Blagojevich in his later political career. Blagojevich spent much of his childhood working odd jobs to help the family pay its bills. He was a shoeshiner and pizza delivery boy before working at a meatpacking plant. In order to afford university costs, Blagojevich worked for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System as a dishwasher.

Blagojevich does not have a middle name, but uses the initial &quot;R&quot; in honor of his deceased father. His nickname in the family was &quot;Milorad&quot;, which some have mistakenly thought to be his name at birth.

Blagojevich graduated from Chicago&#x27;s Foreman High School after transferring from Lane Technical High School. He played basketball in high school, and participated in two fights after training as a Golden Gloves boxer. After graduation, he enrolled at the University of Tampa. After two years, he transferred to Northwestern University in suburban Evanston, where he graduated in 1979 with a B.A. in history. He earned his J.D. from the Pepperdine University School of Law in 1983. He later said of the experience: &quot;I went to law school at a place called Pepperdine in Malibu, California, overlooking the Pacific Ocean — a lot of surfing and movie stars and all the rest. I barely knew where that law library was.&quot; 

== Personal life ==
Blagojevich is married to Patricia Mell, the daughter of former Chicago alderman Richard Mell. He is a Serbian Orthodox Christian.

Blagojevich voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and voted for his re-election in 1984.

===Amateur boxing career===
Blagojevich had an amateur boxing career which spanned 13 months and included Golden Gloves competition. He trained under Jerry Marzillo in Chicago&#x27;s Park District, and he fought some of his matches at the St. Andrews Gym in Chicago&#x27;s Northside.

==Early career==
===Prosecutor===
Blagojevich clerked for Chicago Alderman Edward Vrdolyak. Blagojevich then took a job as Cook County Assistant State&#x27;s Attorney (assistant prosecutor) under State&#x27;s Attorney Richard M. Daley, specializing in domestic abuse crimes and felony weapons cases.

===State and federal legislator===
In 1992, with the backing of his influential father-in-law, Blagojevich unseated 14-year incumbent Myron Kulas in the Democratic primary for the 33rd state house district, in the Illinois House of Representatives, which includes part of Chicago&#x27;s North Side. As is the case with most state legislative elections in Chicago, this virtually assured him of election in November. He drew on his experiences as a prosecutor to draft bills that he argued would strengthen the state&#x27;s judicial system and reduce crime.

In 1996, Blagojevich did not seek reelection to the statehouse but instead ran for , based on the North Side. The district had long been represented by Dan Rostenkowski, who served as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rostenkowski lost reelection in 1994 to Republican Michael Patrick Flanagan after pleading guilty to mail fraud. However, Flanagan was a conservative Republican representing a heavily Democratic district and was regarded as a heavy underdog. Blagojevich soundly defeated Flanagan by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, with support from his father-in-law. He was elected two more times, taking 74% against a nominal Republican challenger in 1998 and having only a Libertarian opponent in 2000.

Blagojevich was not known as a particularly active congressman. In the late 1990s, he traveled with Jesse Jackson to Belgrade in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to negotiate with President Slobodan Milošević for the release of American prisoners of war.

On October 10, 2002, Blagojevich was one of 81 House Democrats, and one of only two from Illinois (the other being David D. Phelps), who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

==Gubernatorial campaigns==
===2002 election===

During 2002, Blagojevich campaigned for his party&#x27;s nomination to become governor. Blagojevich won a close primary campaign against former Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris and Chicago Public Schools Superintendent Paul Vallas, who ran well in the suburban collar counties of Chicago. Blagojevich finished strongly in Southern Illinois, winning 55% of the primary vote downstate, enough to win a primary victory by a thin margin.

During the primary, state Senator Barack Obama backed Burris but, at Burris&#x27;s suggestion, supported Blagojevich after he won the primary, serving as a &quot;top adviser&quot; for the general election. Future Obama senior adviser David Axelrod had previously worked with Blagojevich on congressional campaigns, but did not consider Blagojevich ready to be governor and declined to work for him on this campaign. According to Rahm Emanuel, he, Obama, Blagojevich&#x27;s campaign co-chair David Wilhelm, and another Blagojevich staffer &quot;were the top strategists of Blagojevich&#x27;s 2002 gubernatorial victory&quot;, meeting weekly to outline campaign strategies. However, Wilhelm has said that Emanuel overstated Obama&#x27;s role in the sessions, and Emanuel said in December 2008 that Wilhelm was correct and he had been wrong in his earlier 2008 recollection to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

In the general election, Blagojevich defeated Republican Illinois Attorney General Jim Ryan. Blagojevich&#x27;s campaign was helped by his well-connected father-in-law, Chicago alderman Richard Mell. Ethics scandals had plagued the previous administration of Republican George Ryan (no relation to Jim Ryan), and Blagojevich&#x27;s campaign focused on the theme of &quot;ending business as usual&quot; in state government. Polls prior to the election found that many Illinois voters were confused about the names of George Ryan and Jim Ryan, a fact which Blagojevich used to his advantage. He asked, &quot;How can you replace one Ryan with another Ryan and call that change? You want change? Elect a guy named Blagojevich.&quot; Blagojevich won with 52% of the vote over Jim Ryan. On election night, he said: &quot;Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, Illinois has voted for change.&quot;

===2006 reelection===
From 2005 to 2006, Blagojevich served as federal liaison for the Democratic Governors Association. In 2005, Blagojevich also served as a Chair of the Midwestern Governors Association.

Numerous scandals brought the governor&#x27;s approval rating as low as 36 percent, with 56 percent disapproving near the end of 2005. By early 2006, five Republicans campaigned in the primary for the right to challenge him in the general election, with state treasurer Judy Baar Topinka eventually winning the nomination.

Blagojevich formally began his 2006 reelection campaign for Governor of Illinois on February 19, 2006. He won the Democratic primary on March 21 with 72% of the vote against challenger Edwin Eisendrath, whom Blagojevich would not debate.
He convinced Democratic state senator James Meeks not to launch a third-party campaign by promising to attempt to lease out the state lottery to provide education funding.

Blagojevich was endorsed by many Democratic leaders (with the notable exception of Attorney General Lisa Madigan, who claimed it was a conflict of interest since her office was investigating him), including then-Illinois Senator Barack Obama, who endorsed the governor in early 2005 and spoke on his behalf at the August 2006 Illinois State Fair. Blagojevich was also endorsed by the state&#x27;s Sierra Club, the only Illinois governor ever endorsed by the organization. The union American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees declined to endorse Blagojevich for reelection, citing the 500 jobs he eliminated from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, which left some state parks unsupervised.
In 2004, Blagojevich had ordered the Illinois Tollway to erect 32 signs at a cost of $480,000, announcing &quot;Open Road Tolling. Rod R. Blagojevich, Governor.&quot; In 2006, the signs were criticized for serving as campaign signs and costing significantly more than the common $200 signs.

In the general election, Blagojevich defeated Topinka and the Green Party&#x27;s Rich Whitney, outspending Topinka $27 million to $6 million. He attempted to tie Topinka to former Republican governor George Ryan&#x27;s corruption. Topinka ran advertisements detailing Blagojevich&#x27;s federal investigations and non-endorsements by major state Democrats such as Lisa Madigan. A three-term state treasurer, Topinka said that she had attempted to stop Blagojevich from using money from special funds for general expenditures without approval of the legislature; she said Blagojevich used the funds for projects meant to distract voters from his associates&#x27; corruption trials: &quot;This constant giving away of money ... a million here, a million there, it raids our already hamstrung government and deadbeat state.&quot; Topinka&#x27;s spokesman claimed that Blagojevich was the most investigated governor in Illinois history. Topinka lost to Blagojevich by 11%.

==Governor of Illinois (2003–2009)==

After the 2002 elections, Democrats had control of the Illinois House, Senate, and all but one statewide office. While in office, Blagojevich signed progressive legislation such as ethics reform, death penalty reform, a state Earned Income Tax Credit, a statewide comprehensive smoking ban and expansions of health programs like KidCare and FamilyCare (FamilyCare was ruled unconstitutional). Blagojevich signed a bill in 2005 that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, housing, public accommodations, and credit. Blagojevich originally campaigned against pork barrel spending, but eventually used it himself to gain more votes for bills.

Soon after taking office in 2003, Blagojevich continued support of a moratorium on executions of death row inmates, even though no such executions are likely to occur for years (his predecessor, George Ryan, commuted all of the death sentences in the state shortly before leaving office in 2003). This support continued through his administration.

Another notable action of his term was a strict new ethics law. When campaigning for re-election in 2006, Blagojevich said that if his ethics law had existed when former governor George Ryan had been in office, Ryan&#x27;s corruption might not have occurred. Blagojevich also signed a comprehensive death penalty reform bill that was written by then-Senator Barack Obama and the late U.S. Senator Paul M. Simon. Organized labor and African Americans were Blagojevich&#x27;s staunchest political supporters. In 2008, he told a group of African-Americans that he sometimes considered himself the first African American governor of Illinois.

===Education===
Blagojevich oversaw record increases in funding for education every year without raising general sales or income taxes. He was criticized by Republicans and many moderate Democrats for using funds from the state pension system in order to fund other spending. Another early 2006 proposal included &quot;PreSchool for All&quot; for all three- and four-year-old children in Illinois. Legislation authorizing the program was adopted as part of the fiscal year 2007 budget.

===Proposed capital programs===
On January 10, 2006, Blagojevich announced a proposal for a new $3 billion (US) spending plan for Illinois roads, mass transit, and schools, to be paid for by increased tax revenue and new gambling proposals (such as Keno and lottery games). The proposal met with immediate opposition by members of the Republican Party of Illinois and many Democrats, who viewed it as &quot;an election year ploy&quot;. The suggestion to legalize Keno within Illinois was later withdrawn. As of 2008, Blagojevich had been unable for five years to agree to a capital plan that would improve Illinois infrastructure.

In March 2008, Blagojevich announced a bipartisan coalition, chaired by former U.S. Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert and Former U.S. Congressman Glenn Poshard, to develop a capital construction plan that could pass the Illinois General Assembly. The Illinois Works Coalition toured the state and developed a compromise $34 billion package that relied on a lease of the Illinois Lottery, road funds, and expanded gambling for funding. The plan passed the Senate but stalled in the Illinois House, with opposition from Democrats.

===Special sessions===
Blagojevich called the Illinois General Assembly into special session 36 times while in office, which is half of the total number of special sessions called since 1970. The sessions were blamed for disrupting lawmakers&#x27; time off, while Blagojevich himself did not attend the sessions.

===Relationships with lawmakers===
Blagojevich disagreed with many state Democrats while in office, with House and Senate Republican leaders Frank Watson and Tom Cross often refereeing among the Democrats. During 2008, Blagojevich even expressed fear that House Democrats would gain more seats and he would face more opposition.

Blagojevich&#x27;s lieutenant governor was Pat Quinn. Quinn and Blagojevich publicly disagreed over Blagojevich&#x27;s proposed Gross Receipts Tax to increase revenue for schools and other projects within Illinois. Quinn said in December 2008 that he had last spoken to Blagojevich in the summer of 2007. Blagojevich also feuded with Attorney General Lisa Madigan, Comptroller Dan Hynes, Secretary of State Jesse White, and state treasurer Alexi Giannoulias — all of whom are Democrats.

Blagojevich was often at odds with members of both parties in the state legislature. Democratic legislator Jack Franks said that the reason Blagojevich had problems passing laws with the cooperation of the General Assembly is that he did not spend enough time with the legislature. &quot;That&#x27;s a real reason he has such poor relations with the Legislature and can&#x27;t get any of his agenda passed, because he doesn&#x27;t talk to anybody.&quot; When lawmakers working on a budget during a special session met at 10 am rather than 2 pm, and Blagojevich&#x27;s attorney threatened that the Governor was considering legal action against the involved representatives, Democratic Rep. Joe Lyons told reporters, &quot;We have a madman. The man is insane.&quot;

Although Barack Obama served as an adviser to Blagojevich&#x27;s 2002 gubernatorial campaign, by all accounts, Blagojevich and Obama have been estranged for years. Blagojevich did not endorse Obama in the 2004 United States Senate race, and Obama did not invite Blagojevich to speak at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, as he did Lisa Madigan, Hynes, and Giannoulias. Blagojevich has had a &quot;friendly rapport&quot; with the man who took over his congressional seat, Rahm Emanuel.

Blagojevich has also disagreed publicly with then-Democratic Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley; after their dispute over Chicago Transit Authority funding, Daley called Blagojevich &quot;cuckoo&quot; and said he did not want to argue with the Governor since &quot;He&#x27;s arguing with everybody in America.&quot; Blagojevich replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m cuckoo.&quot;

Soon after a meeting of 2007 with Democratic State Senator Mike Jacobs, meant to convince Jacobs to vote for Blagojevich&#x27;s health insurance proposals, Jacobs emerged telling reporters that the Governor &quot;blew up at him like a 10-year-old child&quot;, Blagojevich would not comment on the alleged incident. Jacobs said during 2008: &quot;This is a governor who I don&#x27;t think has a single ally, except for Senate president Emil Jones — and that&#x27;s tenuous at best.&quot; Jones and Blagojevich sometimes collaborated, while at other times they disagreed on funding for education.

During a 2008 Congressional race pitting Democratic state senator Debbie Halvorson against Republican Marty Ozinga, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran television advertisements attempting to help Halvorson by linking Republican Ozinga to Blagojevich, asserting that Ozinga had given campaign donations to the Democratic governor.

===&quot;The Daily Show&quot; appearances===
During early February 2006, Blagojevich appeared on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; to discuss the governor&#x27;s executive order that pharmacists must dispense any drugs for which a customer had a valid prescription, including birth control pills and Plan B. This measure was being challenged on the show by state legislator Ron Stephens from Greenville, Illinois. Blagojevich was interviewed by Jason Jones, who repeatedly pretended to be unable to pronounce Blagojevich&#x27;s name and simply called him &quot;Governor Smith&quot;. At one point in the interview, Jones, who was acting as if he were against the governor&#x27;s order, told him, &quot;I&#x27;ll be in charge of what my listeners hear.&quot; This prompted Blagojevich to turn to the camera and ask, &quot;Is he teasing me or is that legit?&quot; Two weeks after the interview, Blagojevich said that he was unaware of the nature of the show. Stephens said he knew beforehand that the show was a comedy show: &quot;I thought the governor was hip enough that he would have known that, too.&quot;

Stephens later said, &quot;With all due respect to the governor, he knew it was a comedy show. It&#x27;s general knowledge for people under 90 years of age. It was when he came off looking so silly that he said he thought it was a regular news program. Even assuming he didn&#x27;t know about it beforehand, we had to sign a release before the interview.&quot;

Blagojevich made another appearance on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; on August 23, 2010, after his removal from office. During his time on the show, he vehemently defended himself against host Jon Stewart&#x27;s critique of things that he had previously said on the show. Stewart focused on how Blagojevich had expressed a great desire to tell his side in court, but then did not. Stewart attempted to get a promise that next time, Blagojevich would testify. Stewart also focused on Blagojevich&#x27;s previous statement to him, that if one heard the famous &quot;effing golden&quot; statement in context, it would be seen as innocent. Stewart played the additional recording, and asked him how that sounded any different. The former governor had no concrete answers.

==Political positions==
===State spending===
Blagojevich was criticized for using what his opponents called &quot;gimmicks&quot; to balance the state budget. Republicans claimed that he was simply passing the state&#x27;s fiscal problems on to future generations by borrowing his way to balanced budgets. Indeed, the 2005 state budget called for paying the bills by underfunding a state employees&#x27; pension fund by $1.2 billion.

During 2008, Blagojevich proposed issuing $16 billion in new bonds for the state to meet pension fund requirements. Blagojevich once told a gathering of black ministers on Chicago&#x27;s South Side that he was &quot;on the side of our Lord&quot; with his budget proposals.

Blagojevich proposed a budget for 2008 with a 5% increase from the year before. Budget reductions of some programs caused Blagojevich to attempt to close 11 state parks and 13 state historic sites, with his spokesman saying Blagojevich had never visited any of them. To plug state budget holes, Blagojevich at one point proposed selling the James R. Thompson Center or mortgaging it. Blagojevich was also criticized for his handling of the 2007 state budget. In particular, critics cited his unprecedented use of line-item and reduction vetoes to remove his political opponents&#x27; &quot;member initiatives&quot; from the budget bill.

During 2003, more than 1,000 Illinois judges began a class action lawsuit against Blagojevich, because Blagojevich had stopped constitutionally-required cost of living pay increases for the judges due to budget reductions. The case was settled in the judges&#x27; favor in 2005, with Blagojevich&#x27;s veto ruled as violating the state&#x27;s constitution.

===Health care===

During a suspected shortage of the flu vaccine in 2004, Blagojevich ordered 260,000 doses from overseas distributors, which the Food and Drug Administration had warned would be barred from entering the United States. Although the vaccine doses had cost the state $2.6 million, the FDA refused to allow them into the country, and a buyer could not be found; they were donated to earthquake survivors in Pakistan a year later. However, the lots had expired, and Pakistan destroyed the vaccines.

Also in 2004, Blagojevich&#x27;s plans to set up a website for Illinois residents to import medication from Canada and the United Kingdom was blocked by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Imported medication would have saved users of the service 25 to 50 percent over domestic drugs.

Blagojevich issued an executive order during 2004 requiring pharmacists in the state to dispense &quot;morning-after&quot; birth control, even if they object on moral or religious grounds. This order was legally challenged. Later in 2007, opponents of the governor&#x27;s executive order reached a settlement with the state in one case, causing partial removal of the order. The settlement, which followed the Illinois Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in September 2007 to hear an appeal of a lawsuit challenging the executive order, allowed pharmacists to decline to dispense birth control, so long as they provided information to customers about pharmacists who did. In another case, Morr-Fitz v. Blagojevich (later Morr-Fitz v. Quinn), the Illinois Court of Appeals ruled against Blagojevich&#x27;s order.

During October 2005, Blagojevich announced All Kids, his plan to provide access to state-subsidized healthcare for every child in Illinois. Signed into law by Blagojevich in November 2005, All Kids made Illinois the first state in the U.S. to attempt to legally require itself to provide universal affordable and comprehensive healthcare for children, regardless of income and immigration status.

During March 2007, Blagojevich announced and campaigned for his universal healthcare plan, Illinois Covered. The plan was debated in the Illinois State Senate, but came one vote short of passing. He proposed to pay for the plan with the largest tax increase in Illinois history. He proposed a gross receipts tax on businesses, a $7.6 billion tax increase, with proceeds earmarked to provide universal healthcare in Illinois, increase education spending by $1.5 billion, fund a $25 billion capital construction plan, and reduce the State&#x27;s $40 billion pension debt. Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan called for a vote on a non-binding resolution on whether the state should impose a gross receipts tax. When it became apparent that the resolution would be defeated, Blagojevich announced at the last minute that supporters should vote against it, although the vote was intended to be a test vote to gauge whether the measure had any support. The request was seen by many lawmakers from both parties as an attempt to spin the loss positively. It was defeated by a vote of 107–0, which the Associated Press termed &quot;jaw-dropping&quot;. When asked about the vote of the day, Blagojevich said, &quot;Today, I think, was basically an up. ... I feel good about it.&quot;

Blagojevich also successfully proposed a new tax on businesses that do not provide health insurance to their employees.

Lawmakers did not approve another initiative of Blagojevich&#x27;s, FamilyCare (which would provide healthcare for families of four making up to $82,000), but Blagojevich attempted to implement the plan unilaterally by executive order. In rejecting Blagojevich&#x27;s executive order, a legislative committee questioned how the state would pay for the program. Blagojevich&#x27;s decision has been called unconstitutional by two courts, which nullified the plan. However, during October 2008, pharmacies which had followed Blagojevich&#x27;s directive to dispense drugs under the plan were informed by his administration that they would not be reimbursed and would have payments given under the system deducted from future Medicaid payments. One state lawmaker, Republican Ron Stephens, suggested that Blagojevich should pay the difference out of his own personal account. &quot;The Pantagraph&quot; agreed with Stephens in an editorial.

Associated Press attempted under the Freedom of Information Act to discover how the state planned to pay for the Blagojevich-ordered program, how many people were enrolled, or how much the care had cost the state but were refused the information by state departments.

===Business===
After Blagojevich pushed for a law banning sales of certain video games to minors, a federal judge declared the law violated the First Amendment, with the state ordered to pay $520,000 in legal fees.
Blagojevich vetoed three bills that would permit trucks to drive 65 mph outside the Chicago area instead of the current 55 mph, stating that one bill &quot;compromises safety&quot;.

Blagojevich threatened to stop the state&#x27;s dealings with Bank of America Corp. over a shut-down factory in Chicago. On December 8, 2008, all state agencies were ordered to stop conducting business with Bank of America to pressure the company to make the loans. Blagojevich said the biggest U.S. retail bank would not get any more state business unless it restored credit to Republic Windows and Doors, whose workers were staging a sit-in. John Douglas, a former general counsel for the FDIC and attorney for Bank of America, called Blagojevich&#x27;s gambit dangerous.

===Gun control===
Blagojevich has been described as a &quot;staunch&quot; supporter of gun control.

During his February 2006 &quot;State of the State&quot; address, Blagojevich said the state should ban semi-automatic firearms.

As a state legislator, Blagojevich proposed raising the price of an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card from $5 to $500.
Blagojevich vetoed three gun bills in 2005, which would have:
# Deleted records in gun database after 90 days
# Eliminated the waiting period for someone wanting to buy a rifle or shotgun, when trading in a previously owned weapon
# Overridden local laws regulating transport of firearms.

===Oprah Winfrey===
In early 2009, Blagojevich reported being so impressed by Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s influence on the election of Barack Obama that he considered offering Obama&#x27;s vacant Senate seat to Winfrey. Blagojevich summarized his reasons for considering Winfrey on various talk shows:

Winfrey noted that although she was uninterested, she did feel she could be a senator.

Political analyst Chris Matthews praised Blagojevich&#x27;s idea of making Winfrey a senator, suggesting that in one move it would diversify the Senate and raise its collective IQ. Elaborating further he said:

Lynn Sweet of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; agreed with Matthews, writing Winfrey would be &quot;terrific&quot; and an &quot;enormously popular pick&quot;.

==Personal style==
Blagojevich was famed for his flamboyant dress style, such as his taste for Charvet ties. After the Justice Department complaint was made public, Blagojevich&#x27;s hairstyle became the subject of discussion and jokes for national and local media personalities. Blagojevich insisted his aides always carry a hairbrush for him. He referred to it as &quot;the football&quot;, alluding to the term &quot;nuclear football&quot;, which represents the bomb launch codes never to be out of reach of the president.

==Impeachment, removal from office, trial==


U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald directed FBI to arrest Blagojevich at his home on December 9, 2008, and charge him with corruption. The Justice Department complaint alleged that the governor conspired to commit several &quot;pay to play&quot; schemes, including attempting &quot;to obtain personal gain ... through the corrupt use&quot; of his authority to fill the United States Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama following his election as president, claiming that in wiretapped recordings Blagojevich discussed his desire to get something in exchange for an appointment to the seat. After various outreach efforts, he appointed former state attorney general Roland Burris on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2008. Burris was seated after some initial opposition in mid-January 2009. A trial was set for June 3, 2010, and U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald spoke out on the charges, characterizing Blagojevich&#x27;s actions as trying to auction the open seat off to &quot;the highest bidder&quot;.

The Illinois House and Senate moved quickly to impeach the governor for abuse of power and corruption. On January 8, the Illinois House voted 114–1 (with three abstentions) to impeach Blagojevich. The charges brought by the House emphasized Blagojevich&#x27;s alleged abuses of power and his alleged attempts to sell legislative authorizations and/or vetoes, and gubernatorial appointments including that of Obama&#x27;s vacated Senate seat. Blagojevich was taped by the FBI saying &quot;I&#x27;ve got this thing, and it&#x27;s fucking golden. I&#x27;m just not giving it up for fucking nothing.&quot;

On January 27, 2009, Blagojevich began a media campaign planned by publicist Glenn Selig. During the two-day campaign, he visited &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;The Early Show&quot;, &quot;The View&quot;, multiple programs on Fox News Channel, CNN and MSNBC where he proclaimed his innocence and insisted he would be vindicated.

On January 29, 2009, Blagojevich was removed from office and prohibited from ever holding public office in the state of Illinois again, by two separate and unanimous votes of 59–0 by the Illinois Senate. His lieutenant governor Patrick Quinn subsequently became governor of Illinois.

Blagojevich&#x27;s impeachment trial and removal from office did not affect his federal indictment in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, since impeachment is a political as opposed to a criminal sanction in addition to being (in this particular case) a punishment imposed at the state level.

===Post-removal activities===
After being convicted and removed from office by the Illinois Senate, Blagojevich went on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, where he re-affirmed his innocence and stated that the Illinois legislature&#x27;s decision to remove him from office was politically motivated, being due to his unwillingness to raise taxes. He has accused his successor, Pat Quinn, of using state funds excessively for personal leisure. A report later released by the Governor&#x27;s office showed that most of Quinn&#x27;s transportation fees were paid for by Quinn himself and that Quinn never accepted the $32 meal allowance from the State.

Blagojevich attempted to make a deal to star in NBC&#x27;s 2009 summer reality show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity ... Get Me out of Here!&quot; He made a request with the judge to ease his travel restrictions so that he could travel to Costa Rica to star in the show, saying that his family needed to make money. However, his request was formally rejected by U.S. District Judge James B. Zagel, who was sympathetic to Blagojevich&#x27;s financial situation, but nevertheless stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t think this defendant fully understands and I don&#x27;t think he could understand ... the position he finds himself in.&quot; Judge Zagel went on further to note that Blagojevich must prepare for his defense.

Despite the ruling, NBC expressed an interest in negotiating with the judge to have Blagojevich as a part of the show. His wife took his place on the show, which began airing June 1, 2009. He told an interviewer he found it difficult to watch his wife eat a dead tarantula on the broadcast, but remarked that her willingness to participate in the show was &quot;an act of love&quot; because she was earning funds to alleviate their adverse financial position.

On June 13, 2009, Blagojevich starred in the improv group The Second City&#x27;s musical &quot;Rod Blagojevich Superstar&quot;. He performed in order to support the charity Gilda&#x27;s Club Chicago, which offers support for people living with cancer.

On June 30, 2009, Blagojevich&#x27;s autobiography &quot;The Governor: The Truth Behind the Political Scandal That Continues to Rock the Nation&quot; was announced for print release on September 8, 2009. The book was also released by Amazon.com for sale as an eBook on the Kindle on the same day as the announcement.

On July 19, 2009, Blagojevich began hosting a two-hour weekly radio talk show on 890 WLS, which aired mid-day Sundays. He had previously been a guest host of the &quot;Don Wade and Roma Morning Show&quot; on WLS in March 2009. On June 2, 2010, WLS placed Blagojevich&#x27;s radio show on hiatus while his corruption trial was ongoing.

Blagojevich appeared on season 9 of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot; in Spring 2010, asserting that he has the &quot;skill and know-how to get things accomplished&quot; on the series. Series star and producer Donald Trump praised Blagojevich&#x27;s &quot;tremendous courage and guts&quot;, and predicted that he would become one of the show&#x27;s breakout stars. Trump subsequently fired Blagojevich in the fourth episode of the season, which aired April 4, 2010.

In an interview with &quot;Esquire&quot; in January 2010, Blagojevich said about President Obama, &quot;Everything he&#x27;s saying&#x27;s on the teleprompter. I&#x27;m blacker than Barack Obama. I shined shoes. I grew up in a five-room apartment. My father had a little laundromat in a black community not far from where he lived. I saw it all growing up.&quot; He soon backpedaled from the term &quot;blacker than&quot;, saying that he had chosen his words poorly, but he stood by his message that &quot;the frustration is real, and the frustration is still, today, average, ordinary people aren&#x27;t getting a fair shake.&quot;

Blagojevich made an appearance at the Wizard World Chicago comic convention in August 2010, conversing with and taking pictures with attendees. He charged $50 for an autograph and $80 for a photo. He also had a humorous televised meeting with Adam West; Blagojevich remarked that he considered The Joker to be the best Batman foil. Comic fandom website &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; reported that Blagojevich had met with a mostly positive reception, while &quot;Time Out Chicago&quot; described it as mixed.

===Federal trial and conviction===

Blagojevich was indicted by a federal grand jury in April 2009. Most of the charges were related to attempts to sell the Senate seat vacated by then-President-elect Barack Obama. On August 17, 2010, he was convicted on one of the 24 federal charges, a charge of lying to the FBI, and the jury was hung on 23 other counts. The defense did not call a single witness, claiming that prosecutors did not prove their case. Because the jury could not agree on the remaining charges, a mistrial was ordered for those counts. Within 15 minutes after the mistrial was declared, the prosecution team announced that they would definitely pursue a retrial on the 23 mistrial counts. A post-verdict court date was set for August 23, 2010. Federal prosecutors reduced the number of counts for Blagojevich&#x27;s retrial, and, on June 27, 2011, he was found guilty of 17 of the 20 remaining charges and not guilty on one, and no verdict was rendered by the jury on two counts. He was found guilty on all charges pertaining to the Senate seat, as well as extortion relating to state funds being directed towards a children&#x27;s hospital and race track. However, he was acquitted on a charge pertaining to the tollway extortion and avoided a guilty verdict (by split decision) on attempting to extort Rahm Emanuel.
He reported to prison on March 15, 2012, at Federal Correctional Institution, Englewood, Colorado. His Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) number was 40892–424. Had his sentence not been commuted by President Donald Trump, under federal rules, Blagojevich would have served at least 85%, or 12 years, of his sentence after which time he may have been eligible for early release in March 2024, based on good behavior. However, President Trump commuted his sentence so he was released on February 18, 2020.

While in the federal penitentiary, Blagojevich was the lead singer for a prison band called &quot;The Jailhouse Rockers&quot;, named after an Elvis Presley song. The band dissolved when the lead guitarist was released. He was the fourth Illinois governor to serve time in federal prison, after Otto Kerner Jr., Dan Walker (post-governorship criminal activity), and George Ryan (crimes starting during his prior service as Secretary of State).

===Appeal===
Blagojevich appealed his conviction, claiming judicial bias and a tainted jury pool. He has also long contended that there was critical evidence the jury never heard, including witness testimony and recorded phone calls that Judge Zagel did not allow to be played during the trial. They have also argued that Blagojevich&#x27;s own testimony was restricted by Judge Zagel&#x27;s rulings.

In July 2013, Blagojevich filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago challenging the corruption conviction and the length of his prison term. A three-judge panel of the Seventh Circuit heard arguments in the case in December 2013. In July 2015, the court unanimously vacated five of the corruption convictions, including his convictions for attempting to sell Barack Obama&#x27;s vacant U.S. Senate seat after he was elected president, but affirmed the rest. The court&#x27;s decision remanded to the district court. The Seventh Circuit denied Blagojevich&#x27;s request for rehearing &quot;en banc&quot;, and in March 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States denied Blagojevich&#x27;s petition for a writ of certiorari.

In August 2016, a resentencing hearing was held in the district court. Judge Zagel re-imposed the same 14-year sentence he had imposed in 2011. Zagel acknowledged the suffering of Blagojevich&#x27;s family and Blagojevich&#x27;s good conduct in prison, but found that Blagojevich&#x27;s corrupt conduct still warranted a 14-year sentence. Blagojevich&#x27;s attorneys appealed to the 7th Circuit, but failed; then filed another appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court on November 3, 2017. Meanwhile, Blagojevich continued to fight his conviction and sentence in the media. His wife Patti joined him in attracting press attention to his cause and criticism of the federal judiciary. On April 16, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal, the second time in two years.

===Commutation===
President Donald Trump told reporters on May 31, 2018, hours after he had pardoned commentator Dinesh D&#x27;Souza, that he was considering commuting Blagojevich&#x27;s sentence (without pardoning him), as well as pardoning Martha Stewart. Trump called Blagojevich&#x27;s sentence &quot;unfair&quot;, saying that Blagojevich&#x27;s statements about enriching himself were &quot;stupid&quot;, but also the sort of thing &quot;that many other politicians say&quot;. Blagojevich filed a petition officially asking President Trump for commutation of sentence on June 5, 2018. In August 2019, Trump commented to reporters that he was &quot;very strongly&quot; considering issuing a commutation.
On February 18, 2020, President Trump commuted Blagojevich&#x27;s 14-year corruption sentence, wiping away the sentence but not the conviction. &quot;I don&#x27;t know him very well, I&#x27;ve met him a couple of times, he was on for a short time on &quot;The Apprentice&quot; years ago, seemed like a very nice person, don&#x27;t know him, but he served eight years in jail, there&#x27;s a long time to go,&quot; Trump said to reporters. Some news sources noted that, in addition to &quot;The Apprentice&quot; connection, Trump and his organization had made contributions to Blagojevich&#x27;s political campaigns, including his 2002 gubernatorial campaign.

Blagojevich was released from prison that day, and flew home to Chicago that night. Speaking to reporters after his release, he stated, &quot;I&#x27;m profoundly grateful to President Trump, and I will be for as long as I live.&quot; He said Trump was &quot;a man who&#x27;s not only tough and outspoken, strong, but he has a kind heart&quot;, and proclaimed himself to be a &quot;Trump-ocrat&quot;. On February 19, Blagojevich held a press conference at his home in Chicago&#x27;s Ravenswood neighborhood, where he remained defiant towards his conviction, describing himself as a &quot;political prisoner&quot;, and promised to use his experience in prison to fix the broken criminal justice system.

Illinois House GOP leader Jim Durkin criticized the President&#x27;s decision to commute Blagojevich&#x27;s sentence, stating that Blagojevich was &quot;rogue on steroids&quot; when he &quot;abused the office&quot; and that Trump was &quot;not concerned about the people of Illinois in November.&quot; The commutation was satirized by Chicago-based The Wieners Circle. Following the commutation, the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission found that Blagojevich had engaged in &quot;a pattern of dishonest and deceptive conduct&quot; and recommended his disbarment to the Illinois Supreme Court. On May 18, 2020, the Supreme Court of Illinois officially disbarred him.

In August of the same year, it was announced that Blagojevich would be the featured speaker at a fundraising event to benefit Republican state senate candidate Tom McCullagh. The candidate&#x27;s campaign stated that &quot;McCullagh is welcoming [Blagojevich] to the table to give us an inside look to help understand the depths of the Madigan machine and how to end corruption in Illinois.&quot;.

=== 2025 Pardon from President Trump ===
On February 10, 2025, President Donald Trump issued a full and unconditional pardon to Blagojevich using the power given to presidents in the Constitution. While Blagojevich had already been walking free since Trump’s 2020 commutation of his sentence, the pardon cleared Blagojevich’s criminal record.

== Post-political career ==
In May 2020, Blagojevich launched a politics-themed podcast titled &quot;The Lightning Rod&quot; on WLS-AM 890. The podcast ran through September 2021.

<doc id="418929" wikidata="Q2174727" url="?curid=418929" title="Simpson, Milton Keynes">
<text>Simpson is a village in Milton Keynes, England. It was one of the villages of historic Buckinghamshire that was included in the &quot;New City&quot; in 1967. It is located south of the centre, just north of Fenny Stratford.

Simpson is now part of the civil parish of Simpson and Ashland, which also includes Ashland and West Ashland.

== History ==
The village name is derived from Old English, and means &#x27;Sigewine&#x27;s farm or settlement&#x27;. It was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Siwinestone&quot;. 

In the mid 19th century the village was described as &quot;in appearance, one of the most wretched of many miserable villages in the county&quot;. According to Sheahan, until about 1830 &quot;during the wintertime, the main road [LondonNorthampton] was generally impassable, without wading through water three feet deep, for a distance of about 200 yards&quot;; he goes on to state that &quot;chiefly through the exertions of Mr. C. Warren, the road has been raised by 3 and a half feet&quot;. Charles Warren was the owner of Simpson House and was a substantial landowner and contractor. It would have been in his interest to alleviate flooding in the village, although there is no other documentary evidence that he was directly involved in the improvement works.

Simpson was an ancient parish, which included part of Fenny Stratford. It became a civil parish in 1866, but in 1934 the civil parish was abolished and absorbed by Bletchley Urban District, which itself was abolished in 1974 to become part of the Milton Keynes District.

== Ecumenical Church of St Thomas the Apostle ==

The church building dates from the early fourteenth century. By 1847, Simpson, or Sympson, like other ecclesiastical parishes in Buckinghamshire, had been transferred to the Diocese of Oxford. St Thomas is one of the five churches in the Woughton Ecumenical Partnership, which was established in 1977. Among the historical features of the church is a hagioscope, or leper-squint.

==Education==

There is one school currently in Simpson:

Charles Warren Academy, a primary school for children aged 4-11 years. The current headteacher is Jo Goldsmith. It was previously known as Simpson County Combined School.

Walnuts School, a school for pupils with special educational needs used to be located at Simpson, but it is now moved to Hazeley, the west corner of Milton Keynes.

<doc id="418930" wikidata="Q496819" url="?curid=418930" title="Currency board">
<text>In public finance, a currency board is a monetary authority which is required to maintain a fixed exchange rate with a foreign currency. This policy objective requires the conventional objectives of a central bank to be subordinated to the exchange rate target. In colonial administration, currency boards were popular because of the advantages of printing appropriate denominations for local conditions, and it also benefited the colony with the seigniorage revenue. However, after World War II many independent countries preferred to have central banks and independent currencies.

Although a currency board is a common (and simple) way of maintaining a fixed exchange rate, it is not the only way. Countries often keep exchange rates within a narrow band by regulating balance of payments through various capital controls, or though international agreements, among other methods. Thus, a rough peg may be maintained without a currency board.

== Features of orthodox currency boards ==

The main qualities of an orthodox currency board are:

* A currency board&#x27;s foreign currency reserves must be sufficient to ensure that all holders of its notes and coins (and all bank creditors of a Reserve Account at the currency board) can convert them into the reserve currency (usually 110–115% of the monetary base M0).
* A currency board maintains absolute, unlimited convertibility between its notes and coins and the currency against which they are pegged (the anchor currency), at a fixed rate of exchange, with no restrictions on current-account or capital-account transactions.
* A currency board only earns profit from interest on foreign reserves (less the expense of note-issuing), and does not engage in forward-exchange transactions. These foreign reserves exist (1) because local notes have been issued in exchange, or (2) because commercial banks must, by regulation, deposit a minimum reserve at the Currency Board. (1) generates a seignorage revenue. (2) is the revenue on minimum reserves (revenue of investment activities less cost of minimum reserves remuneration)
* A currency board has no discretionary powers to affect monetary policy and does not lend to the government. Governments cannot print money, and can only tax or borrow to meet their spending commitments.
* A currency board does not act as a lender of last resort to commercial banks, and does not regulate reserve requirements.
* A currency board does not attempt to manipulate interest rates by establishing a discount rate like a central bank. The peg with the foreign currency tends to keep interest rates and inflation very closely aligned to those in the country against whose currency the peg is fixed.

== Consequences of adopting a fixed exchange rate as prime target ==
The currency board in question will no longer issue fiat money but instead will only issue one unit of local currency for each unit (or decided amount) of foreign currency it has in its vault (often a hard currency such as the U.S. dollar or the euro). The surplus on the balance of payments of that country is reflected by higher deposits local banks hold at the central bank as well as (initially) higher deposits of the (net) exporting firms at their local banks. The growth of the domestic money supply can now be coupled to the additional deposits of the banks at the central bank that equals additional hard foreign exchange reserves in the hands of the central bank.

== Pros and cons ==
The virtue of this system is that questions of currency stability no longer apply. The drawbacks are that the country no longer has the ability to set monetary policy according to other domestic considerations, and that the fixed exchange rate will, to a large extent, also fix a country&#x27;s terms of trade, irrespective of economic differences between it and its trading partners. Typically, currency boards have advantages for small, open economies which would find independent monetary policy difficult to sustain. They can also form a credible commitment to low inflation.

== Examples in recent history ==
More than 70 countries have had currency boards. Currency boards were most widespread in the early and mid 20th century.
Hong Kong operates a currency board (Hong Kong Monetary Authority), as does Bulgaria. Estonia had a currency board fixed to the Deutsche Mark from 1992 to 1999, when it switched to fixing to the Euro at par. The peg to the Euro was upheld until January 2011 with Estonia&#x27;s adoption of the Euro (see Economy of Estonia for a detailed description of the Estonian currency board). Argentina abandoned its currency board in January 2002 after a severe recession. To some, this emphasised the fact that currency boards are not irrevocable, and hence may be abandoned in the face of speculation by foreign exchange traders. However, Argentina&#x27;s system was not an orthodox currency board, as it did not strictly follow currency board rules – a fact which many see as the true cause of its collapse. They argue that Argentina&#x27;s monetary system was an inconsistent mixture of currency board and central banking elements. It is also thought that the misunderstanding of the workings of the system by economists and policymakers contributed to the Argentine government&#x27;s decision to devalue the peso in January 2002. The economy fell deeper into depression before a recovery began later in the year.

The British Overseas Territories of Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands and St. Helena continue to operate currency boards, backing their locally printed currency notes with sterling reserves.

A gold standard is a special case of a currency board where the value of the national currency is linked to the value of gold instead of a foreign currency.

=== Examples against the euro ===
* Bulgarian lev
* Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark (&quot;Konvertibilna marka&quot;)

=== Examples against the U.S. dollar ===
* Hong Kong dollar
* Bermudian dollar
* Cayman Islands dollar
* Djiboutian franc
* East Caribbean dollar (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines)
** For complete listing, see United States dollar

=== Examples against the pound sterling ===
* Falkland Islands pound
* Gibraltar pound
* Saint Helena pound

=== Examples against other currencies ===
* Brunei dollar, against the Singapore dollar
* Macanese pataca, against the Hong Kong dollar
* The Faroe Islands have a &quot;de jure&quot; currency board, but in fact the Danish National Bank serves as the lender of last resort and all bank accounts are denominated in Danish kroner. The Danish National Bank refers to the Faroese króna as a &quot;special version&quot; of the Danish kroner, which is itself partly backed by the Euro foreign reserve of the Danish National Bank.

<text>John Peter Altgeld (December 30, 1847 – March 12, 1902) was an American politician and the 20th Governor of Illinois, serving from 1893 until 1897. He was the first Democrat to govern that state since the 1850s. A leading figure of the Progressive movement, Altgeld signed workplace safety and child labor laws, pardoned three of the men convicted in the Haymarket Affair, and rejected calls in 1894 to break up the Pullman strike by force. In 1896 he was a leader of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, opposing President Grover Cleveland and the conservative Bourbon Democrats. He was defeated for reelection in 1896 in an intensely fought, bitter campaign.

Born in the Duchy of Nassau, Altgeld grew up on a farm in the American Midwest. After a stint in the Union Army as a youth, Altgeld studied law in Missouri, while working as a manual laborer, and became involved in progressive politics. Altgeld eventually opened a law practice in Chicago, and became a real estate developer, and local judge before being elected governor. Often in poor health, he died at the age of 54, while working in the law office of Clarence Darrow.

==Early life==
Altgeld was born in the town of Selters in the German Westerwald, the first son of John P. and Mary Altgeld. His parents left Germany when he was three months old, bringing their infant son with them. They settled on a farm near Mansfield, Ohio. He left home at age 16 to join the Union Army; lying about his age, he enlisted in the 164th Ohio (National Guard) Infantry. Altgeld&#x27;s regiment served in Virginia as a reserve unit, doing labor and reconnaissance, participating in only one skirmish. Altgeld himself nearly died of fever. He then worked on his father&#x27;s farm, studied in the library of a neighbor and at a private school in Lexington, Ohio, and for two years taught school.

After a brief stint in an Ohio seminary, he walked to Missouri and studied to become a lawyer while working on itinerant railroad construction crews. Becoming ill from the climate and the labor, Altgeld wandered to Kansas and Iowa before settling as a teacher and farmhand near Savannah, Missouri. There, he began to read law at a private law firm and was admitted to the Andrew County bar in 1871. He was not educated at any university. The university law school at which he would have studied was not even founded until 1872, one year before Altgeld was admitted to the bar. In Savannah, Altgeld first became involved in politics. He served as city attorney and was elected state&#x27;s attorney, resigning after one year of a two-year term.

In 1875, Altgeld moved to Chicago hoping to continue his legal career there. He frequently visited his home in Ohio. He was married to Emma Ford, the daughter of John Ford and Ruth Smith, in 1877 in Richland County, Ohio. Their marriage was a happy one by all accounts but produced no children.

Altgeld&#x27;s practice of law began to show success and he was managing an independent legal practice by 1880. He became wealthy, however, from a series of real estate dealings and development projects, including residential and office properties in Chicago and a streetcar line in Newark, Ohio. His most notable project was the Unity Building (1891), the 16-story office building that was at that time Chicago&#x27;s tallest building. In January 1890, Altgeld bought a lot at what is now 127 North Dearborn Street in downtown Chicago, and he established the Unity Company to build and manage the future Unity Building. He indiscriminately contributed his own fortune toward the endeavor, and for a while the construction was moving more quickly than expected. However, this led to a $100,000 mistake and much of the framework of the building had to be rebuilt. Altgeld also made an error by trying to borrow $400,000 from John R. Walsh, president of the Jennings Trust Company and of the Chicago National Bank. Technicalities in the contract caused many problems for Altgeld. Eventually, a new contract was signed, but Altgeld was able to borrow only $300,000 from Walsh. He ended up raising the rest of the money himself, and the construction of the Unity Building was completed. In 1893, he declared that the Unity Building had given him the most personal satisfaction of all his achievements.

Altgeld became a millionaire, and would, by the time he ran for governor, own six buildings in Chicago.

==Early political career==
Altgeld&#x27;s name, according to historian Philip Dray, &quot;is synonymous with the dawn of the Progressive era.&quot; His first public post was city attorney in Savannah, Missouri, in which capacity he rewrote a code of ordinances. In Missouri Altgeld became involved in the Granger movement and the Democratic Party and was elected to be state&#x27;s attorney for the county in 1874. As Altgeld later wrote, he quickly became disillusioned with the criminal justice system and resigned after just one year.

Altgeld decided to run for Congress in 1884 against incumbent George Adams of Illinois&#x27;s 4th congressional district. That year, he published an essay on penal reform entitled, &quot;Our Penal Machinery and Its Victims.&quot; His essay argued that rather than reform criminals, incarceration produced hardened criminals. Although this district was heavily Republican, Adams defeated him by just 8 points (54–46%), a better showing than well-known Democrat Lambert Tree had made two years earlier. As a Republican leader recalled, &quot;He (Altgeld) was not elected, but our executive committee was pretty badly frightened by the strong canvass he made.&quot;

Altgeld assumed the office of Judge of the Superior Court of Cook County on December 6, 1886.succeeding Judge Rollin S. Williamson. He resigned in August 1891 to pursue private business interests. He was succeeded as a judge by Jonas Hutchinson.

==Illinois governorship==
In 1891, he unsuccessfully challenged John M. Palmer in seeking to have the Illinois General Assembly appoint him to the United States Senate.

===1892 gubernatorial election===
He was drafted by the Democrats to run for Governor of Illinois.

One of the obstacles in the way of Altgeld receiving the Democratic nomination was Palmer, still bitter over Altgeld challenging him for Senate in 1891. Viewed as an elder statesman of the party, Palmer&#x27;s opposition to Altgeld would have carried weight. Altgeld supporter Michael C. McDonald made an empty promise to Palmer that, in turn for not opposing Altgeld&#x27;s candidacy, Cook County Democrats would support him for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination in the same year&#x27;s presidential election.

Altgeld was popular among his fellow German Americans.

The only Chicago newspaper that provided positive coverage of Altgeld was the &quot;Chicago Globe&quot;, which was run by Michael C. McDonald. Elsewhere in the Chicago press, Altgeld received vilification for his political association with Michael C. McDonald, his liberal sympathies towards the men convicted in the Haymarket Affair, and his alliance with Chicago&#x27;s Iroquois Club. He was painted as a hazardous radical and a dangerous threat to the state&#x27;s business and commercial concerns. However, many downstate newspapers provided positive coverage to Altgeld.

Also initially seeking the Democratic nomination was John C. Black. Other potential candidates were dissuaded from running. For instance, State Representative James Cockrell was convinced by Clarence Darrow to abandon his plans of running. However, by February 23, it was reported that Black had withdrawn from the race, leaving Altgeld as the only candidate seeking the Democratic nomination. Altgeld won the Democratic nomination on the first ballot at the state convention in Springfield.

Altgeld&#x27;s supporters dubbed him, &quot;the poor man&#x27;s friend&quot;.

In the general election he faced popular incumbent Republican governor Joseph W. Fifer.

Altgeld traveled across the state to campaign on a vigorous speaking tour. He attacked Fifer&#x27;s use of prison labor for state projects, and attacked his school reform record. Fifer did not refute Altgeld&#x27;s allegations against his record, which helped make them stick in the minds of voters.

To dampen the negative impact that his association with Altgeld would have on Altgeld&#x27;s electability, particularly among rural downstate voters, Michael C. McDonald temporarily resigned his role on the Cook County Central Committee a month before the election.

Altgeld narrowly defeated Fifer. He was the first Democrat to have been elected governor of Illinois since 1856, the first time a foreign-born citizen had been elected, and the first time a Chicago resident had been elected.

===Transition===
Altgeld suffered a nervous breakdown shortly after his victory, and nearly died of a concomitant fever. He managed to appear at his inauguration, but was only able to deliver a brief portion of his speech. Although the General Assembly hall was so warm as to cause several men to faint, Altgeld, clad in a heavy topcoat, was pale and visibly shivering. The clerk of the Assembly delivered the remainder of his speech.

===Tenure===
As governor, Altgeld spearheaded the nation&#x27;s most progressive child labor and occupational safety laws, appointed women to important positions in the state government, and vastly increased state funding for education.

====Pullman Strike====
In 1894, the Pullman Rail Strike, led by Eugene V. Debs, took place. Altgeld, however, refused to authorize President Grover Cleveland to send in Federal troops to quell the disturbances. Altgeld wrote to President Cleveland indicating that reports of strike-related violence had been exaggerated and warned that real violence would begin only as a result of sending soldiers. Nevertheless, a federal injunction was issued against the strike, with disruption of U.S. Mail deliveries, a Federal concern, cited as a justification. However, the superintendent of mails, L. L. Troy, stated that no mail had been disrupted. Citing Article IV of the Constitution, which permits federal troops to enter a state only if a condition of insurrection exists, Altgeld argued that there was no legal bearing to a decision to send the military to quell the strike. Finally, he took the occasion to criticize the attorney general&#x27;s misuse of court injunctions under the Sherman Act, writing: &quot;This decision marks a turning point in our history for it establishes a new form of government never before heard of among men; that is government by injunction. . . . Under this new order of things a federal judge becomes at once a legislator, court and executioner.&quot; However, on July 4, 1894, Cleveland went ahead and sent several thousand troops to Chicago without Altgeld&#x27;s approval, an action later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. Altgeld&#x27;s opposition was seen as a highly unusual stance for a state governor at that time. Altgeld may have opposed the use of federal troops but he wielded the state militia to rein in the strike. He sent the militia to eight areas during the strike, including to Mount Olive, where the miners blocked the Chicago, Peoria, and St. Louis railroad from shipping coal. Once there the Governor issued General Order No. 8, which prohibited them from being used &quot;as custodians or guards of private property.&quot;

====Pardons and clemency====
Historically, Altgeld is remembered chiefly for pardoning the three surviving men convicted in the 1886 Haymarket bombing (four others had already been executed, one committed suicide in prison). After reviewing their cases, he concluded, as have subsequent scholars, that there had been a serious miscarriage of justice in their prosecutions. Altgeld concluded that the trial had taken place in such an atmosphere of prejudice that the convictions were not credible. As a result of his decision to pardon the three surviving men, he came under intense attack.

Some argue that in addition to his findings that there had been a miscarriage of justice, Altgeld was also motivated by revenge in his Haymarket pardon. The judge that prosecuted the men, Joseph E. Gary, had upheld a ruling that found Altgeld in contempt of the Cook County Superior Court. Altgeld was known to hold strong grudges.

By the end of 1895, he freed eighty-one prisoners, leading newspapers to dub him John &quot;Pardon&quot; Altgeld.

In May 1895, mob violence erupted after one of Altgeld&#x27;s pardons, with farmers lynching two accused rapists in Danville.

On his last day in office, he released twenty-six offenders convicted of serious crimes, including seven murderers.

In total, he pardoned or commuted sentences of:
*75 people convicted of forgery, embezzlement, manslaughter, burglary, or larceny
*19 people convicted of murder
*8 people convicted of rape, assault, or incest
*5 people convicted or armed robbery or arson

===Unsuccessful 1896 reelection campaign===
The Pullman incident and the Haymarket pardons were used against Altgeld by his conservative enemies. Altgeld was ineligible to run for president (since he was born in Germany), but he led the fight against the Cleveland forces in 1896. Altgeld publicly broke from Cleveland and his conservative supporters. Altgeld helped split the Democratic Party during the 1896 presidential election into Free Silver and Bourbon Democrats. He ran for re-election on the same ticket with Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan. Altgeld had not supported Bryan for the nomination and hesitated to support the &quot;Free Silver&quot; plank that was central to Bryan&#x27;s campaign. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; warned that Bryan would be a puppet of Altgeld, whom it referred to as &quot;the ambitious and unscrupulous Illinois communist.&quot; However, Bryan, who was being hurt by Republican charges that he was a stooge for Altgeld, avoided the governor and did not endorse him.

Republicans in Illinois focused their attacks on Altgeld. Theodore Roosevelt, before an audience of 13,000 cheering partisans in Chicago, said Altgeld was &quot;one who would connive at wholesale murder,&quot; who &quot;condones and encourages the most infamous of murders,&quot; and who &quot;would substitute for the government of Washington and Lincoln a red welter of lawlessness and dishonesty as fantastic and vicious as the Paris Commune.&quot; Altgeld campaigned energetically despite his failing health, but was defeated by John R. Tanner; Altgeld outpolled his party&#x27;s presidential candidate, Bryan, by 10,000 votes in Illinois.

==Chicago mayoral candidacies==
===1899===
Altgeld was a political opponent of Carter H. Harrison, Jr. (1860–1953), who had been elected Mayor of Chicago in 1897. Altgeld believed that Harrison aimed to spearhead conservative forces in the Democratic Party at the national level and that if Harrison were re-elected as mayor he would have the power to handpick conservative delegates to the 1900 Democratic National Convention. Finding Harrison&#x27;s prospective opponent, a &quot;Free Silver&quot; Republican, a less offensive option, Altgeld decided to himself run for Mayor – having faint hope of victory himself, but seeking to split away the progressive Democratic vote and thereby send Harrison to defeat.

Altgeld charged that Harrison was building a political machine and that his administration was corrupt, publicly claiming in March 1899 that Harrison&#x27;s administration was complicit in the theft of city funds by political allies in connection with city public works projects.

In his final campaign, Altgeld ran for mayor of Chicago as the candidate of the Municipal Ownership Party. He finished third, garnering more than 15 percent of the vote, but was unable to achieve his ulterior motive, the defeat of Mayor Carter Harrison.

===1901===
In 1901, Altgeld made a quixotic effort to challenge Harrison for the Democratic nomination for mayor.

==Post-gubernatorial years==
Sickly since his brush with death in the Civil War, Altgeld had suffered from locomotor ataxia while governor, impairing his ability to walk. He lost all of his property except his heavily mortgaged personal residence, and only the intervention of his friend and former protégé, Clarence Darrow, saved him from complete financial ruin.

==Death and legacy==
Altgeld was working as a lawyer in Darrow&#x27;s law firm when he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while delivering a speech on behalf of the Boers in Joliet, Illinois, in March 1902. He was 54 years old when he died. Thousands filed past his body as it lay in state in the lobby of the Chicago Public Library, and he was eulogized by Darrow and by Hull House founder Jane Addams. Poet Vachel Lindsay wrote a poem, &quot;The Eagle That Is Forgotten,&quot; in memory of Altgeld.

Altgeld is buried in Graceland Cemetery in Uptown, Chicago.

The governor influenced the design of five castle-like structures at Illinois universities. One is Altgeld Hall at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is currently home to the Mathematics Department, and had previously housed the College of Law and the University Library. The other four are at Southern Illinois University Carbondale and Northern Illinois University, as well as John W. Cook Hall at Illinois State University and Old Main at Eastern Illinois University. Chicago&#x27;s Altgeld Gardens Homes, one of the first housing projects in the United States, was named after the former governor as well as the street located at 2500 North in Chicago&#x27;s grid system, Altgeld Street.
There is a statue of Altgeld in Lincoln Park in Chicago at 2045 Lincoln Park West; east of Lincoln Park West, south of Dickens St.

<text>Singleborough is a hamlet in the parish of Great Horwood, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located about a mile from the main village.

== History ==
The hamlet name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;gravel hill&#x27;.

It appears spelt as Synkelburgh, in 1440, on a plea roll of the Court of Common Pleas, where a resident Thomas May, with others, was accused of trespassing on John Carter&#x27;s land in Great Horwood &amp; assaulting him.

<text>The Wiz: The Super Soul Musical &quot;Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; is a musical with music and lyrics by Charlie Smalls (and others) and book by William F. Brown. It is a retelling of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900) in the context of contemporary African-American culture. It opened on October 21, 1974, at the Morris A. Mechanic Theatre in Baltimore, and moved to Broadway&#x27;s Majestic Theatre with a new cast on January 5, 1975.

The 1975 Broadway production won seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical. It was an early example of Broadway&#x27;s mainstream acceptance of works with an all-Black cast. It has had revivals in New York, London, San Diego, and the Netherlands, and a limited-run revival was presented by Encores! at New York City Center in June 2009. A big-budget film adaptation of the same name was released in 1978, with Ted Ross and Mabel King reprising their roles. A live television production of the stage version, &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot;, was broadcast on NBC on December 3, 2015, with an encore presentation on December 19 of the same year.

==Production history==
===Development and Broadway===
The idea for the musical originated with producer Ken Harper. He replaced the original director, Gilbert Moses, with Geoffrey Holder in Detroit during out-of-town tryouts. As cast member André De Shields, who played the title role, later wrote, &quot;It was Geoffrey&#x27;s masterful people skills and embrace of magical realism that metamorphosed &quot;The Wiz&quot; from caterpillar to butterfly.&quot;

The original Baltimore cast included Stephanie Mills as Dorothy Gale, Stu Gilliam as the Scarecrow, Tiger Haynes as the Tin Man, Ted Ross as the Cowardly Lion, and Butterfly McQueen as the Queen of the Field Mice, but in a much smaller role. Renée C. Harris stayed on as understudy for the role of Dorothy, as did McQueen for the role of Addaperle.

The production was choreographed by George Faison, with scenic designer Tom H. John, costumes by Geoffrey Holder, lighting by Tharon Musser, and orchestrations by Harold Wheeler. Faison and Holder both won Tony Awards for choreography and costume design, respectively at the 29th Tony Awards in 1975.

The show had a pre-Broadway tryout at the Fisher Theatre in Detroit in November 1974, and at the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia from December 11, 1974, through December 21, 1974. After drawing mixed critical reviews, producer Ken Harper considered closing the musical after its Broadway opening night. One source attributes its turnaround success to a publicity campaign that included a TV commercial featuring the cast singing &quot;Ease On Down the Road,&quot; a song that proved so popular that it was released as a single recorded by the disco group Consumer Rapport; The single hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; Soul Singles chart, peaking at No. 19 and the Hot 100, peaking at No. 42.

William F. Brown, who wrote the book, gave a more specific explanation in 1993: &quot;20th Century-Fox, the musical&#x27;s major investor, put in another $100,000 to keep it going and everyone agreed to royalty cuts until the production&#x27;s cost—about $1.1 million—was recouped...By the eighth week, we were selling out.&quot;

The Broadway production moved to the Broadway Theatre on May 25, 1977, and closed on January 28, 1979, after four years and 1,672 performances.

Along with other musicals including &quot;Purlie&quot; (1971) and &quot;Raisin&quot; (1974), &quot;The Wiz&quot; was a breakthrough for Broadway, a large-scale big-budget musical featuring an all-Black cast. It laid the foundation for later African-American hits such as &quot;Bubbling Brown Sugar&quot;, &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; and &quot;Sophisticated Ladies&quot;.

===National tours and later revivals===
The musical toured the US in 1976 and during the tour, Kenneth Kamal Scott (then billed as &quot;Kamal&quot;) replaced André De Shields as the Wiz, Renn Woods was cast as Dorothy but departed the tour after playing only a couple of cities because during the show&#x27;s engagement at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, the 19-year-old performer was recruited for a featured part in the movie production of &quot;Hair&quot;. Renee C. Harris (who was in her very early 20s) took over as the tour&#x27;s Dorothy and continued leading that company for a couple of years playing many engagements in cities across the country. At this time, the production also featured Ben Harney as the Tin Man and Ken Prymus as the Lion. Prymus was known to audiences for his featured role as Private Seidman in the movie &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970) where he sang &quot;Suicide is Painless&quot;. Both men were subsequently featured in other Broadway shows and were as replacements in the Broadway production of &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin″&quot;. Harney also originated the leading role of Curtis Taylor Jr. in the Broadway debut of &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;. When Harris eventually departed the company, the tour continued with Deborah Malone in the role of Dorothy. There was also a second national touring company which was a scaled down production. This second tour opened with Malone reprising her role as Dorothy, who was later replaced by Lillias White.

A revival ran on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre from May 24, 1984, through June 3, 1984, closing after 13 performances and 7 previews. Directed by Geoffrey Holder, the cast featured Stephanie Mills as Dorothy. It then ran in London at the Lyric Hammersmith from December 11, 1984, through February 2, 1985. A planned 2004 Broadway revival was not produced.

In August 2015, George Faison presented &quot;The Wiz: A Celebration in Dance and Music,&quot; performances of the original songs and choreography in honor of the Broadway hits 40th Anniversary at Summerstage in New York City. A number of members of the original Broadway cast returned for this celebratory run. Actress Phylicia Rashad, a munchkin and swing in the original production, co-hosted the performance with George Faison. André De Shields reprised his original role as the Wiz; Dee Dee Bridgewater, Tony Award winner for her role as Glinda, reprised her original role; Evelyn Thomas reprised her original role as the Tornado and Ebony Jo-Ann who played Addaperle in the Broadway revival of the production reprised her role as well. Singer-songwriter Wallace Gary joined the cast as the Scarecrow. Damien L. Sneed acted as the musical director and conductor of &quot;The Wiz: A Celebration in Dance and Music&quot;.

From 1996 to 1997 there was a US concert version tour with Tasha Scott as Dorothy, Grace Jones as Evillene, Peabo Bryson as The Wiz, and CeCe Peniston as Glinda. The cast also featured Tony Terry as the Tin Man and Romelda Benjamin as Aunt Em.

A North American tour, directed by Schele Williams with new material by Amber Ruffin, launched in the fall of 2023 in Baltimore with plans to transfer to Broadway for a limited engagement in spring 2024. The Broadway revival opened at the Marquis Theatre on April 17, 2024 with previews beginning March 29, 2024. The production concluded its limited engagement on August 18, 2024 after 18 preview performances and 142 regular performances. The tour will then resume performances beginning February 2025 starring Alan Mingo Jr. and Mykal Kilgore.

==Plot==
===Prologue===
Teenaged Dorothy Gale lives with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and dog, Toto, on their farm in Kansas. Though her work there keeps her busy, she often gets distracted in her boredom with farm life, choosing instead to play with Toto and dream of someday seeing far-off lands. Aunt Em, however, has little patience for her daydreaming, believing that dawdling is contrary to their way of life. After an argument, Aunt Em apologizes to her for an unintentionally hurtful remark. She explains that she only scolds because she wants Dorothy to be the best she can be, and fears that she will not be prepared for the responsibilities life will soon put upon her. Aunt Em loves her dearly and hopes they will always be as close as they were when she was younger (&quot;The Feeling We Once Had&quot;).

===Act I===
When an approaching storm turns out to be a tornado, Dorothy takes shelter in the farmhouse as Aunt Em and Uncle Henry do so in the storm cellar. As the tornado hits the farm, the house, with Dorothy inside, is lifted into the air and flies for miles, with the wind represented by dancers (&quot;Tornado&quot;). The house finally comes to rest with a bump in the middle of a field covered with flowers. There Dorothy is met by the Munchkins, all of whom are dressed in blue, and Addaperle, the Good Witch of the North, who tells her that she is in the Land of Oz. Furthermore, her house has fallen on Evamean, the Wicked Witch of the East, and killed her, freeing the Munchkins from her evil powers. Dorothy, distressed and confused, wants only to return home. With her magic unable to take Dorothy beyond the country boundaries, Addaperle decides Dorothy&#x27;s best chance for assistance is to follow the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City in the centre of Oz, to see the great and powerful Wizard of Oz, or &quot;The Wiz&quot; for short (&quot;He&#x27;s the Wizard&quot;). She gives her Evamean&#x27;s silver shoes, and tells her not to take them off before she reaches home, for they hold a mysterious, but very powerful charm that will keep her safe.

Dorothy sets off down the Yellow Brick Road, full of doubt and fear at what lies ahead (&quot;Soon As I Get Home&quot;). Stopping to rest by a cornfield, she is startled when a scarecrow hanging on a pole strikes up a conversation with her (&quot;I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday&quot;). He tells her of his longing for brains so that he can be like other people, and she invites him to accompany her to see if the Wizard can help him. (&quot;Ease On Down the Road #1&quot;).

The Yellow Brick Road leads them into a great forest where they discover a man made of tin, rusted solid. They oil his joints (&quot;Slide Some Oil To Me&quot;) and he tells them how Evamean put a spell on his axe so that it began to cut off parts of his body. Each time it happened, a tinsmith replaced each missing part with one made of tin until he was entirely made of it. The one thing the tinsmith forgot was a heart, and he has longed for one ever since. Dorothy and the Scarecrow invite him on their journey to see the Wizard with the hope that he may give him one (&quot;Ease On Down the Road #2&quot;).

They continue following the Yellow Brick Road deeper into the forest, where they are attacked by a large lion (&quot;I&#x27;m a Mean Ole Lion&quot;). However, he is quickly revealed to be a coward hiding behind bravado as Dorothy stands up for her friends. When he learns where they are going, he apologizes and asks if he may accompany them to ask the Wizard for some courage. They agree and the trio becomes a quartet (&quot;Ease On Down the Road #3&quot;), but face a new danger when they are attacked by an evil gang of witch-like beings called Kalidahs (&quot;Kalidah Battle&quot;). After a great fight and harrowing escape, they stop by the road to rest. The Lion is embarrassed by his cowardice in the battle, but is comforted by Dorothy&#x27;s kind words (&quot;Be a Lion&quot;).

Seeing a green glow in the distance, they continue their journey to the Emerald City, and wander into a field of poppies who blow opium dust on them. Dorothy recalls that Addaperle warned her of these poppies, and runs from the field as fast as she can with the Scarecrow and Tin Man behind her. The Lion is overcome by the dust and begins to hallucinate (&quot;Lion&#x27;s Dream&quot;). He is dragged from the field and returned to his friends by the Mice Squad who police the area.

Marching up to the gates of the Emerald City, they are met by the Gatekeeper who insists they must all be fitted with a pair of green tinted glasses that are locked on to prevent them being blinded by the dazzling sights. They enter the city and look about in awe at the richly dressed people that inhabit it (&quot;Emerald City Ballet&quot;). The haughty and condescending people laugh and ridicule this odd group for wanting to see the Wizard until they see that Dorothy is wearing Evamean&#x27;s silver shoes. They are promptly shown right into his palace.

Once in the throne room, they are assaulted by a great show of lights, smoke, and pyrotechnics as the Wizard appears in several forms before them (&quot;So You Wanted To Meet the Wizard&quot;). They each plead their case to him, the Tin Man doing so in song (&quot;What Would I Do If I Could Feel?&quot;). He agrees on one condition: they must kill Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West. With their goals seeming further out of reach than ever before, they sink to the floor in tears.

===Act II===
Evillene rules over the yellow land of the west, enslaving its people, the Winkies. She is evil, power hungry, and ruthlessly determined to get her hands on her sister&#x27;s silver shoes, so that she may increase her power and rule over all of Oz (&quot;Don&#x27;t Nobody Bring Me No Bad News&quot;). Receiving word of Dorothy and her friends approaching, she sends her Winged Monkeys to kill them (&quot;Funky Monkeys&quot;). Catching up to them in the forest surrounding her castle, the monkeys dash the Tin Man against rocks until he falls apart, and rip the straw out of the Scarecrow, leaving both of them helpless. Seeing Dorothy&#x27;s silver shoes, however, they dare not harm her. Instead, they carry her to Evillene&#x27;s castle along with the Lion. While searching for a way to get the shoes from Dorothy, Evillene forces her and the Lion to do menial chores around her castle. She takes delight in torturing the Lion before Dorothy, threatening to have him skinned unless she hands over the silver shoes. Angered by this, she picks up a bucket of water and throws it over Evillene, who melts until only her magic golden cap remains. Her spell on the Winkies is lifted, and they show their thanks by restoring the Scarecrow and Tin Man to top condition, and reuniting the group (&quot;Everybody Rejoice/A Brand New Day&quot;).

Returning to the Emerald City, they see the Wizard (now a booming voice that seems to come from the very air). He reneges on his promise, and the Lion knocks over a screen in anger. Behind it stands a bewildered man who claims to be the Wizard. He shows them the elaborate mechanical effects used to create his illusions, and tells them that he is really a balloonist from Omaha named Herman Smith who traveled to Oz by accident when his hot air balloon drifted off course. The Ozians had never seen such a sight and proclaimed him Wizard. Not wanting to disappoint them, he assumed the role and had a great city built. He then had everyone in it wear green glasses, and in time, they came to believe it was green.

Furious, the group confronts the Wizard on his deceptions (&quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;), but he points out that the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion already have the things they seek as shown in their behavior on the journeys they have made (&quot;Believe In Yourself&quot;). They remain unconvinced, so he creates physical symbols of their desires and they are satisfied. He proposes that Dorothy can return to Kansas the way he came, and offers to pilot her in his hot air balloon. He addresses the citizens of the Emerald City in person for the first time in many years, telling them of his imminent journey, and leaving the Scarecrow in charge (&quot;Y&#x27;all Got It!&quot;). Just as his speech reaches its climax, the balloon comes free from its moorings and rises quickly into the air, taking Dorothy&#x27;s hopes of getting home with it.

Just as the group despairs of finding help, Addaperle reappears in a flash of light, suggesting that Dorothy ask Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, for assistance. She transports them to Glinda&#x27;s castle in the red land of the south, where they are warmly welcomed and invited to rest after their many trials (&quot;A Rested Body Is a Rested Mind&quot;). Glinda is a beautiful and gracious sorceress, surrounded by a court of pretty girls. She tells Dorothy that the silver shoes have always had the power to take her home, but like her friends, she needed to believe in their magic and in herself before it was possible (&quot;If You Believe&quot;). She bids a tearful goodbye to her friends, and as their faces fade into the darkness, she thinks about what she has gained, lost, and learned throughout her journey through Oz (&quot;Home&quot;). Clicking her heels together three times, she finds herself transported back to Kansas in an instant. As an overjoyed Aunt Em and Toto appear, and she runs to hug them, she knows that she is back home at last.

==Motion picture and television adaptations==
Motown Productions acquired the film rights to &quot;The Wiz&quot; in 1977 and signed Stephanie Mills in anticipation of having her star as Dorothy in the film adaptation. Motown singer and actress Diana Ross asked Motown CEO Berry Gordy to cast her instead, but he declined, feeling that the then-33-year-old Ross was far too old for the part. However, she contacted Rob Cohen of Universal Pictures, who offered to have them finance the film if she were to play Dorothy, at which point he acquiesced.

The resulting film version of &quot;The Wiz&quot; also starred former Motown star Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow, Nipsey Russell as the Tin Man, Richard Pryor as the Wizard, jazz singer Thelma Carpenter as Miss One (the name &quot;Addapearle&quot; was not used for this production) and Lena Horne as Glinda. Ted Ross and Mabel King reprised their roles of the Lion and Evillene from the Broadway production respectively. Sidney Lumet served as director, working with screenwriter Joel Schumacher (who used none of William F. Brown&#x27;s stage script) and music supervisor Quincy Jones. The film was a critical and commercial failure, performing poorly at the box office and severely panned by critics, who branded the casting of Ross instead of Mills as Dorothy a disastrous blunder.

In 1998, following their TV-movie production of &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1997), producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron began pre-production on a TV-movie adaptation of &quot;The Wiz&quot; for &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;, which was to star a then-unknown Anika Noni Rose as Dorothy. The project fell through due to Universal still having the film rights to adaptations of &quot;The Wiz&quot;, and the production was shelved. &quot;The O.Z.&quot;, a hip-hop re-adaptation of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; with an all-Black cast that was to use original music rather than adapt &quot;The Wiz&quot;, was then planned by FOX and director Chris Stokes in the early 2000s. With Brandy, Queen Latifah, Patti LaBelle, Busta Rhymes, and Little Richard among its planned cast, the telefilm ultimately went un-produced; FOX instead became a co-producer on &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot; (2005), starring Ashanti as Dorothy and Latifah as Aunt Em.

Eleven years later, following the production of two live musicals for NBC – &quot;The Sound of Music Live!&quot; (2013) and &quot;Peter Pan Live!&quot; (2014) – Zadan and Meron announced &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot; as their next production (NBC, by this point, having purchased Universal Studios). NBC&#x27;s live performance of the stage show aired on December 3, 2015. Stephanie Mills, who originated the role of Dorothy on Broadway, played Aunt Em. An open casting call for the role of Dorothy took place on June 6, 2015. In July 2015, Queen Latifah was cast as the Wiz and Mary J. Blige was confirmed to play the role of Evillene. In addition, Beyoncé was offered to play Glinda, but no deal was made. The following month, David Alan Grier was cast as the Cowardly Lion, and newcomer Shanice Williams was chosen to play Dorothy. Uzo Aduba played Glinda and Amber Riley portrayed Addaperle, the Good Witch of the North. Other principal cast-members included Elijah Kelley as the Scarecrow, Ne-Yo as the Tin Man, and Common as the Bouncer, the gatekeeper of the entrance to Emerald City.

==Instrumentation and chorus==
The orchestra calls for 2 keyboards, 2 guitars, electric bass, drums, percussion, 2 trumpets, trombone, 2 woodwinds and a 5-piece chorus (4 male and 1 female). The first keyboard is played by the conductor. One guitarist plays lead while the other guitarist plays rhythm. The first woodwind player doubles on tenor and alto saxophones and flute while the second one doubles on tenor, alto and baritone saxophones and flute.

All numbers composed by Charlie Smalls save for the following: &quot;Tornado&quot; is composed by Timothy Graphenreed and Harold Wheeler. &quot;Emerald City Ballet (Psst)&quot; is composed by Graphenreed and George Faison. &quot;Everybody Rejoice/A Brand New Day&quot; is composed by Luther Vandross. The song &quot;Wonder, Wonder, Why&quot; was added for the 1984 Broadway revival, but is not part of the current licensed score.

==Critical reception==
In his review of the 1984 revival, Frank Rich wrote: &quot;What made &quot;The Wiz&quot; surprisingly moving the first time around was that its creators found a connection between Baum&#x27;s Kansas fantasy and the pride of urban Black Americans. When Glinda, the good witch, musically instructed Dorothy to &#x27;believe in herself,&#x27; she seemed to be delivering a broader inspirational message. &quot;The Wiz&quot; was hardly a great musical in 1975, but it had something to say, and it said it with verve and integrity. It&#x27;s depressing to watch a once-fervent expression of Black self-respect and talent be spilled on the stage as if it were a trunkload of marked-down, damaged goods.&quot;

In their review of the 2006 La Jolla production, &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;&#x27;The Wiz&#x27; remains a collage of contemporary slang and imagery, but La Jolla&#x27;s is a multicultural collage in which Baum&#x27;s themes speak to the broadest possible audience. Unquestionably, the humor and the heartbeat of the piece remain African-American at their source, but the overall effect is pluralistic and inclusive. In the truest and most positive sense of the phrase, McAnuff&#x27;s show is color-blind. Every alteration from the 1975 original, inspired by the central multicultural concept, is salutary. Brown&#x27;s almost wholly rewritten script is tart and funny at last. Smalls&#x27; score—supervised by musical director Ron Melrose and original orchestrator Harold Wheeler—sounds fresh and contemporary&quot;.

As critic Peter Filichia wrote in 2015, &quot;Arguably more impressive is Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s opinion. Whenever he&#x27;s asked for a favorite show that he didn&#x27;t write, he immediately says &quot;The Wiz.&quot; What?! With all its false rhymes?! &#x27;Because,&#x27; he always says, &#x27;it&#x27;s the one show which makes you feel better when you come out of it than you did when you walked in.&#x27;&quot;

==Recording==
The Original Cast Recording for &quot;The Wiz&quot; was released in 1975 on the Atlantic label, produced by Jerry Wexler. While well received, the album omits several key songs from the musical that were not recorded for the album- such as the show&#x27;s overture, dance and accompaniment music. The &quot;Tornado&quot; instrumental was released as both a 7&quot; single and a 12&quot; extended single, while the show&#x27;s musical arranger Harold Wheeler co-produced a cover of &quot;Ease on Down the Road&quot; with studio group Consumer Rapport that became a charting single in 1975, peaking at #42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 2017, the original Broadway cast recording of &quot;The Wiz&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

<text>Slapton is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located between the Grand Union Canal and the boundary with Bedfordshire, about south of Leighton Buzzard and west of Edlesborough.

== Hamlets ==
Towards the edge of the parish near Horton in Ivinghoe is the hamlet of Horton Wharf. The village of Grove is also within the boundary of Slapton parish.

==History==
The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &quot;farm by a slippery place&quot;. This village was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Slapetone&quot;.

The manor of Slapton once belonged to a convent in Barking, Essex, though it was seized by the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1547. The manor was for some time after that the property of the Earl of Bridgwater.

The village hall was built and given to the village by the Griffin family of Bury Farm in memory of Elizabeth Griffin in the 1950s. Until recently, the Griffin family continued to own Bury Farm, and had the unusual distinction of farming buffalo in the village. Slapton once had a splendid 18th century rectory of classical design. This was demolished in the 1960s and a development of four-bedroom terraced and semi-detached houses in the style of that era was built on its site.

There was a farm (Church Farm) immediately next to the church until the mid-1970s; this property had been in the ownership of one family since 1086, having originally been given to the de Tournais by William the Conqueror. The family survived in Slapton, spelling their name in various ways, until the death of William Turney around 1975. He was childless, so the farm was sold for the first time in 900 years. The new owners demolished the farmhouse and buildings, and on the site built a development of houses and flats known as Tournay Court.

===Current===
Today Slapton contains few old buildings of any architectural merit. The church, dedicated to the Holy Cross, is of plain design with tower, nave and chancel. The chancel is probably the oldest part of the building. The churchyard contains many memorials to the Turney and Buckmaster families.

===Local history and interest===

The Great Train Robbery took place at Bridego Railway Bridge (No. 127) on 8 August 1963, which is situated one mile (as the crow flies) from Slapton, heading towards Ledburn.

==Notable people==
*Frank Bruno lives on the outskirts of the village.

<doc id="418939" wikidata="Q5449012" url="?curid=418939" title="Film grammar">
<text>In film, film grammar is defined as follows:

# A frame is a single still image. It is analogous to a letter.
# A shot is a single continuous recording made by a camera. It is analogous to a word.
# A scene is a series of related shots. It is analogous to a sentence. The study of transitions between scenes is described in film punctuation. Film punctuations can also be intra scene &amp; shot. 
# A sequence is a series of scenes which together tell a major part of an entire story, such as that contained in a complete movie. It is analogous to a paragraph.
# A film is a series of sequences or sometimes just a sequence where the film consists of a single sequence.

The term &quot;film grammar&quot; is best understood as a creative metaphor, since the elements of film grammar described above do not stand in any strict relation of analogy to the components of grammar as understood by philology or modern linguistics.

D. W. Griffith has been called the father of film grammar. Griffith was a key figure in establishing the set of codes that have become the universal backbone of film language. He was particularly influential in popularizing &quot;cross-cutting&quot;—using film editing to alternate between different events occurring at the same time &amp; between different time periods within the timeline of the given film —in order to build suspense or for any other relevant purpose(s). He still used many elements from the &quot;primitive&quot; style of movie-making that predated classical Hollywood&#x27;s continuity system, such as frontal staging, exaggerated gestures, minimal camera movement, and an absence of point of view shots. Some claim, too, that he &quot;invented&quot; the close-up shot for filming.

Credit for Griffith&#x27;s cinematic innovations must be shared with his cameraman of many years, Billy Bitzer. In addition, he himself credited the legendary silent star Lillian Gish, who appeared in several of his films, with creating a new style of acting for the cinema.

<text>The Church of the Lutheran Brethren of America (CLBA) is a Lutheran denomination of Christians rooted in a Pietist Lutheran spiritual awakening at the turn of the 20th century.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Following the occurrence of a Pietist spiritual revival that swept through a large part of the Midwestern United States in the 1890s, an assembly of Lutherans who were influenced by this fervor felt the need to reject several former beliefs as incompatible with their newfound spirituality. They rejected the idea of receiving the unconverted into full membership or admitting them to Communion, replaced liturgical ceremonies with simple worship services, and formed new congregations to worship and serve according to these dictates of conscience.

=== Formation ===
Five such Lutheran congregations from the United Norwegian Lutheran Church of America met in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on December 17, 1900, and organized a synod named the Church of the Lutheran Brethren. Its constitution was patterned after that of the Lutheran Free Church of Norway. The Lutheran Bible School, forerunner of the current schools in Minnesota, was founded in 1903 in Wahpeton, North Dakota.

== Doctrinal beliefs ==
The CLBA emphasizes the foundational place of the Bible, stating, &quot;We believe the Bible is the inspired Word of God and free from error. It is authoritative for faith and conduct.&quot; Other beliefs include the triune Godhead; total depravity; the eternal Son-ship, Virgin Birth, sinless life, substitutionary atonement, bodily resurrection, personal return of Jesus; infant baptism; and Holy Communion. It has been noted for practicing open communion, teaching premillennialism, and not having the laity receive absolution from the pastor.

In addition to the denominational statement of faith, the church adheres to the following historic confessions: the Apostles&#x27; Creed, Nicene, and Athanasian creeds, the Augsburg Confession, and Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism. Its strong emphasis on missions and evangelism and its stand for non-liturgical worship and a church composed only of confessing Christians differentiate it from most Lutherans in America. The CLBA considers itself to be &quot;Lutheran in theological tradition and evangelical in practice&quot;.

== Organization ==
The Church of the Lutheran Brethren has 123 congregations with about 8,860 baptized members in the United States (114) and Canada (9), as well as about 1,500 congregations in Cameroon, Chad, Japan, and Taiwan. Its offices, the Lutheran Brethren Seminary, the Lutheran Center For Christian Learning, and the Hillcrest Lutheran Academy are located in Fergus Falls, Minnesota. The CLBA publishes a bimonthly magazine called &quot;Faith &amp; Fellowship&quot;. The CLBA has been led by President Paul Larson since 2014.

The CLBA has been involved in a number of national and international missionary endeavours throughout its history. In 1966, the denomination, in partnership with several other missional bodies, instituted the China Lutheran Seminary in Hsinchu City, Taiwan.

<doc id="418944" wikidata="Q310618" url="?curid=418944" title="Glenn Beck">
<text>Glenn Lee Beck (born February 10, 1964) is an American conservative political commentator, radio host, entrepreneur, and television producer. He is the CEO, founder, and owner of Mercury Radio Arts, the parent company of his television and radio network TheBlaze. He hosts the &quot;Glenn Beck Radio Program&quot;, a talk-radio show nationally syndicated on Premiere Radio Networks. Beck also hosts the &quot;Glenn Beck&quot; television program, which ran from January 2006 to October 2008 on HLN, from January 2009 to June 2011 on Fox News and now airs on TheBlaze. Beck has authored six &quot;New York Times&quot;–bestselling books.

In April 2011, Beck announced that he would &quot;transition off of his daily program&quot; on Fox News, but would continue to team with Fox. His last daily show on Fox was June 30, 2011. In 2012, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; placed Beck on its Digital Power Fifty list. Beck launched TheBlaze in 2011 after leaving Fox News. He hosts an hour-long afternoon program, &quot;The Glenn Beck Program&quot;, on weekdays, and a three-hour morning radio show; both are broadcast on TheBlaze. Beck is also the producer of TheBlaze&#x27;s &quot;For the Record&quot;.

Beck has received both praise and criticism, characterized by his supporters as a defender of traditional American values and by his detractors as a demagogue. During Barack Obama&#x27;s presidency, Beck promoted conspiracy theories about Obama, his administration, George Soros, and others.

== Early life and education ==
Beck was born in Everett, Washington, the son of Mary Clara (née Janssen) and William Beck, who lived in Mountlake Terrace, Washington, at the time of their son&#x27;s birth. The family later moved to Mount Vernon, Washington, where they owned and operated a downtown bakery. He is descended from German immigrants who came to the United States in the 19th century. Beck was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended Immaculate Conception Catholic School in Mount Vernon.

Beck and his sister moved with their mother to Sumner, Washington, attending a Jesuit school in Puyallup. In 1979, when Beck was 15, his mother drowned in Puget Sound while fishing with a man in Commencement Bay west of Tacoma. Her companion also drowned; police investigators believed that one of the victims may have fallen overboard and the other drowned in a rescue attempt. Beck has called his mother&#x27;s death a suicide in interviews.

After their mother&#x27;s death, Beck moved to his father&#x27;s home in Bellingham, where Beck graduated from Sehome High School in 1982. Beck also regularly vacationed with his maternal grandparents, Ed and Clara Janssen, in Iowa. In the aftermath of his mother&#x27;s death and his stepbrother&#x27;s subsequent suicide, Beck has said he used &quot;Dr. Jack Daniel&#x27;s&quot; to cope. At 18, after graduating from high school, he moved to Provo, Utah, and worked at radio station KAYK. Feeling he &quot;didn&#x27;t fit in&quot;, Beck left Utah after six months, taking a job at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s WPGC in February 1983.

== Personal life ==

While working at WPGC, Beck met his first wife, Claire. They married in 1983 and had two daughters, Mary and Hannah. Mary developed cerebral palsy as a result of a series of strokes at birth in 1988. The couple divorced in 1994 amid Beck&#x27;s struggles with substance abuse. He is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, and has said he has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

By 1994, Beck was suicidal, and imagined shooting himself to the music of Kurt Cobain. He credits Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) with helping him achieve sobriety. He said he stopped drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis in November 1994, the same month he attended his first AA meeting. Beck later said that he had gotten high every day for the previous 15 years, since the age of 16.

In 1996, while working for a New Haven area radio station, Beck took a theology class at Yale University, with a written recommendation from Senator Joe Lieberman, a Yale alumnus who was a fan of Beck&#x27;s show at the time. Beck enrolled in an &quot;Early Christology&quot; course, but soon withdrew, marking the extent of his post-secondary education.

Beck then began a &quot;spiritual quest&quot; in which he &quot;sought out answers in churches and bookstores&quot;. As he later recounted in his books and stage performances, Beck&#x27;s first attempt at self-education involved reading the work of six wide-ranging authors, constituting what Beck jokingly calls &quot;the library of a serial killer&quot;: Alan Dershowitz, Pope John Paul II, Adolf Hitler, Billy Graham, Carl Sagan, and Friedrich Nietzsche. During this time, Beck&#x27;s Mormon friend and former radio partner Pat Gray argued in favor of the &quot;comprehensive worldview&quot; offered by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an offer that Beck rejected until a few years later. (Later, after moving to the New York City area, he had a consultation with Graham, which he said affected him strongly.

In 1999, Beck married his second wife, Tania. After they went looking for a faith on a church tour together, they joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in October 1999, partly at the urging of his daughter Mary. Beck was baptized by Pat Gray. Beck and Tania have two children together. Until April 2011, the couple lived in New Canaan, Connecticut, with the four children.

In July 2010, Beck announced that he had been diagnosed with macular dystrophy, saying, &quot;A couple of weeks ago I went to the doctor because of my eyes. I can&#x27;t focus my eyes. He did all kinds of tests and he said, &#x27;you have macular dystrophy ... you could go blind in the next year. Or, you might not. The disorder can make it difficult to read, drive or recognize faces.

In July 2011, Beck leased a house in the Fort Worth suburb of Westlake, Texas. The Blaze has been based in Irving, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, since 2011.

On November 10, 2014, Beck announced on TheBlaze that he had been suffering from a severe neurological disorder for at least the last five years. He described many strong and debilitating symptoms that made it difficult for him to work, and also announced that he had &quot;a string of health issues that quite honestly made me look crazy, and quite honestly, I have felt crazy because of them&quot;. Beck said that a chiropractor who specializes in &quot;chiropractic neurology&quot;, Frederick Carrick, had &quot;diagnosed [him] with several health issues, including an autoimmune disorder, which he didn&#x27;t name, and adrenal fatigue.&quot; Over 10 months he had received a series of treatments and felt better. On January 13, 2022, Beck announced that his second case of COVID-19 was &quot;getting into my lungs&quot;.

== Career ==
In 2002, Beck created the media platform Mercury Radio Arts as the umbrella over his broadcast, publishing, Internet, and live show interests. Beck founded Mercury Radio Arts in 2002, naming it after the Orson Welles&#x27; Mercury Theatre, which produced live radio broadcasts during the 1930s. The company produces all of Beck&#x27;s productions, including his eponymous radio show, books, live stage shows, and his official website.

=== Radio ===
In 1983, Beck moved to Corpus Christi, Texas, to work at radio station KZFM. In mid-1985, he was hired away from KZFM to be the lead DJ for WRKA&#x27;s morning-drive radio broadcast in Louisville, Kentucky. His four-hour weekday show was called &quot;Captain Beck and the A-Team&quot;. Beck had a reputation as a &quot;young up-and-comer&quot;. The show was not political and included the genre&#x27;s usual off-color antics: juvenile jokes, pranks, and impersonations. It slipped to third in the market and Beck left abruptly in 1987 amid a dispute with WRKA management.

Months later, Beck was hired by Phoenix Top-40 station KOY-FM, then known as Y-95. Beck was partnered with Arizona native Tim Hattrick to co-host a local &quot;morning zoo&quot; program. During his time at Y-95, Beck cultivated a rivalry with local pop radio station KZZP and that station&#x27;s morning host Bruce Kelly. Through practical jokes and publicity stunts, Beck drew criticism from the staff at Y-95 when the rivalry culminated in Beck telephoning Kelly&#x27;s wife on the air, mocking her recent miscarriage. In 1989, Beck resigned from Y-95 to accept a job in Houston at KRBE, known as Power 104. He was fired in 1990 due to poor ratings.

Beck then moved to Baltimore, Maryland, and the city&#x27;s leading Top-40 station, WBSB, known as B104. There, he partnered with Pat Gray, a morning DJ. During his tenure at B104, Beck was arrested and jailed for speeding in his DeLorean. According to a former associate, Beck was &quot;completely out of it&quot; when a station manager went to bail him out. After Gray and Beck were fired, they spent six months in Baltimore, planning their next move. In early 1992, they moved to WKCI-FM (KC101), a Top-40 radio station in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1995, WKCI apologized after Beck and Gray mocked a Chinese-American caller on air who felt offended by a comedy segment by playing a gong sound effect and having executive producer Alf Gatineau mock a Chinese accent. That incident led to protests by activist groups. When Gray left the show to move to Salt Lake City, Beck continued with co-host Vinnie Penn. At the end of 1998, Beck was informed that his contract would not be renewed at the end of 1999.

The &quot;Glenn Beck Program&quot; first aired in 2000 on WFLA (AM) in Tampa, and took its afternoon time slot from 18th to first place within a year. In January 2002, Premiere Radio Networks launched the show nationwide on 47 stations. The show then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, broadcasting from new flagship station WPHT. On November 5, 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Premiere Radio Networks was extending Beck&#x27;s contract. By May 2008, it had reached over 280 terrestrial stations as well as XM Satellite. It was ranked fourth in the nation with over 6.5 million listeners. , Beck was tied for fourth in the ratings, behind Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Dave Ramsey.

=== Television ===
In January 2006, CNN&#x27;s &quot;Headline News&quot; announced that Beck would host a nightly news-commentary show in its new prime-time block &quot;Headline Prime&quot;. The show, simply called &quot;Glenn Beck&quot;, aired weeknights. &quot;CNN Headline News&quot; called the show &quot;an unconventional look at the news of the day featuring his often amusing perspective&quot;. At the end of his tenure at CNN-HLN, Beck had the second-largest audience, behind Nancy Grace. In 2008, he won the Marconi Radio Award for Network Syndicated Personality of the Year.

In October 2008, it was announced that Beck would join the Fox News Channel, leaving CNN Headline News. After moving to Fox, Beck hosted &quot;Glenn Beck&quot;, beginning in January 2009, as well as a weekend version. One of his first guests was Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. He also had a regular segment on Fridays, &quot;At Your Beck and Call&quot;, on the Fox News Channel program &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;. , Beck&#x27;s program drew more viewers than all three competing time-slot shows combined on CNN, MSNBC and HLN.

Beck&#x27;s show&#x27;s high ratings did not come without controversy. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Howard Kurtz reported that Beck&#x27;s use of &quot;distorted or inflammatory rhetoric&quot; had complicated the channel&#x27;s and its journalists&#x27; efforts to neutralize White House criticism that Fox is not really a news organization. Television analyst Andrew Tyndall echoed these sentiments, saying that Beck&#x27;s incendiary style had created &quot;a real crossroads for Fox News&quot;, saying, &quot;they&#x27;re right on the cusp of losing their image as a news organization.&quot;

In April 2011, Fox News and Mercury Radio Arts, Beck&#x27;s production company, announced that Beck would &quot;transition off of his daily program&quot; on Fox News in 2011. His last day at Fox was later announced as June 30. FNC and Beck announced that he would team with Fox to produce a slate of projects for Fox News and its digital properties. Fox News head Roger Ailes later referenced Beck&#x27;s entrepreneurialism and political movement activism, saying, &quot;His [Beck&#x27;s] goals were different from our goals ... I need people focused on a daily television show.&quot; Beck hosted his last daily show on Fox on June 30, 2011, when he recounted the accomplishments of the show and said, &quot;This show has become a movement. It&#x27;s not a TV show, and that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t belong on television anymore. It belongs in your homes. It belongs in your neighborhoods.&quot; In response to critics who said he was fired, Beck pointed out that his final show was airing live. Immediately after the show he did an interview on his new GBTV internet television channel.

==== TheBlaze TV (formerly GBTV) ====
Beck&#x27;s Fox News one-hour show ended on June 30, 2011, and a new two-hour show began his television network, which started as a subscription-based internet TV network, TheBlaze TV, originally called GBTV, on September 12, 2011. Using a subscription model, it was estimated that Beck was on track to generate $27 million in his first year of operation. This was later upgraded to $40 million by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; when subscriptions topped 300,000.

=== Books ===
Mercury Ink has a co-publishing deal with Simon &amp; Schuster and was founded by Glenn Beck in 2011 as the publishing imprint of Mercury Radio Arts. Started in 2011, Mercury Ink publishes adult and young adult novels and non-fiction titles. Authors signed to Mercury Ink include Beck and New York Times best seller Richard Paul Evans.

Beck has reached No. 1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Bestseller List in four separate categories : Hardcover Non-Fiction, Paperback Non-Fiction, Hardcover Fiction, and Children&#x27;s Picture Books.

Beck has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss&#x27;s book &quot;Tools of Titans&quot;.

=== Stage shows and speeches ===
Since 2005, Beck has toured American cities twice a year, presenting a one-man stage show. His stage productions are a mix of stand-up comedy and inspirational speaking. In a critique of his live act, &quot;Salon&quot; magazine&#x27;s Steve Almond describes Beck as a &quot;wildly imaginative performer, a man who weds the operatic impulses of the demagogue to the grim mutterings of the conspiracy theorist&quot;. A show from the &quot;Beck &#x27;08 Unelectable Tour&quot; was shown in around 350 U.S. movie theaters.

The finale of 2009&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense Comedy Tour&quot; was simulcast in over 440 theaters. The events have drawn 200,000 fans in recent years.

In March 2003, Beck ran a series of rallies, which he called Glenn Beck&#x27;s Rally for America, in support of troops deployed for the upcoming Iraq War. On July 4, 2007, he hosted the 2007 Toyota Tundra &quot;Stadium of Fire&quot; in Provo, Utah. America&#x27;s Freedom Foundation presents the annual event at LaVell Edwards Stadium at Brigham Young University. In May 2008, Beck gave the keynote speech at the NRA convention in Louisville, Kentucky.

In late August 2009, the mayor of Beck&#x27;s hometown, Mount Vernon, Washington, announced that he would award Beck the Key to the City, designating September 26, 2009, as &quot;Glenn Beck Day&quot;. Due to local opposition, the city council voted unanimously to disassociate itself from the award. The key presentation ceremony sold out the 850-seat McIntyre Hall and an estimated 800 detractors and supporters demonstrated outside the building. Earlier that day, approximately 7,000 people attended the Evergreen Freedom Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Take the Field with Glenn Beck&quot; at Seattle&#x27;s Safeco Field.

In December 2009, Beck produced a one-night special film, &quot;The Christmas Sweater: A Return to Redemption&quot;. In January and February 2010, he teamed with fellow Fox News host Bill O&#x27;Reilly to tour several cities in a live stage show called &quot;The Bold and Fresh Tour 2010&quot;. The January 29 show was recorded and broadcast to movie theaters throughout the country.

In July 2013, Beck produced and hosted a one-night stage event, &quot;Man in the Moon&quot;, held at the USANA Amphitheatre in West Valley City, Utah. The amphitheater sold out all 20,000 of its seats and a recording of the event was released on television and DVD in August 2013. The event was a narrative story told from the Moon&#x27;s point of view, from the beginnings of the Book of Genesis to the first Moon landing. The Moon narrates the story.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 2011, Beck founded the nonprofit organization Mercury One, the mission of which is to &quot;restore the human spirit by encouraging dependence on God, providing humanitarian aid, preserving heritage, and empowering all to stand for truth.&quot; In early 2011, he began work toward developing a clothing line to be sold to benefit the charity. In October 2011, Mercury One began selling the upscale clothing line &quot;1791&quot; exclusively at its website, 1791.com. The clothing in the line&#x27;s 11-piece inaugural offering was manufactured by American Mojo of Lowell, Massachusetts.

In July 2014, after tens of thousands of undocumented immigrant children crossed into Texas via the Southern United States border, unaccompanied by parents, Beck announced that he, Senator Mike Lee, and Representative Louie Gohmert would travel to the U.S.–Mexico border with Mercury One. He said they would bring tractor trailers full of food, hot meals, and teddy bears for the unaccompanied minors. While Beck made clear in interviews that they wanted a full repeal of DACA, he also said he believed in the importance of helping these children. &quot;Through no fault of their own, they are caught in political crossfire, and while we continue to put pressure on Washington and change its course of lawlessness, we must also help&quot;, Beck said. &quot;It is not either/or. It is both. We have to be active in the political game, and we must open our hearts.&quot;

As of 2017, Beck&#x27;s Nazarene Fund had reportedly relocated 10,524 Christian refugees from northern Iraq and Syria to other host countries, including the U.S., Australia, France, Slovakia, Greece, Lebanon, Brazil, and Canada. The fund&#x27;s website says 1,646 families have been evacuated from the ISIS-ravaged region since its launch in 2014, and 45,000 people have received humanitarian aid as a result of donations to Mercury One.

== Projects and rallies ==
=== 2003 Rallies for America ===
In 2003, during the early stages of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, Beck called for and helped fund &quot;Rallies for America&quot; in cities across the country to support American troops and counter the anti-Iraq War movement. Around 8,000 people attended the first rally in Cleveland, Ohio, and around 150,000 people are believed to have attended the rallies in total. At the Washington DC rally, letters from President George W. Bush and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger were read. 

=== 9–12 Project and Tea Party protests ===
In March 2009, Beck put together a campaign, the 9-12 Project, named after nine principles and 12 values that he says embody the spirit of the American people on the day after the September 11 attacks. The Colorado 9-12 Project hosted a &quot;Patriot Camp&quot; for kids in grades 1–5, featuring programs on &quot;our Constitution, the Founding Fathers, and the values and principles that are the cornerstones of our nation&quot;.

=== Restoring Honor rally ===
Beck promoted and hosted the Restoring Honor rally at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., on August 28, 2010. The rally—which purported to embrace religious faith and patriotism—was co-sponsored by the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, promoted by FreedomWorks, and supported by the Tea Party movement. Attendance was estimated at 87,000 (± 9,000) based on aerial photos.

=== &quot;America&#x27;s First Christmas&quot; ===
In December 2010, Beck went to Wilmington, Ohio, a town devastated by the late-2000s recession, to host live events to encourage his fans to go to the town to boost the local economy in a project called &quot;America&#x27;s First Christmas&quot;. He hosted an event and his radio and television shows from the local theater.

=== Restoring Courage 2011 international tour ===
Beck headlined his &quot;Restoring Courage&quot; events in Jerusalem, Israel, in August 2011 in a campaign he said was designed to encourage people worldwide &quot;to stand with the Jewish people&quot;. After Jerusalem, Beck visited Cape Town, South Africa, and was scheduled to visit Venezuela.

=== 2012 presidential campaign ===
Actively supporting Mitt Romney as &quot;perhaps the best-known Mormon after the Republican presidential candidate and a major influence on evangelical Christians, ... Beck has emerged as an unlikely theological bridge between the first Mormon presidential nominee and a critical electorate [evangelicals]&quot;, according to a pre-election article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Along with personal campaign appearances in Ohio and Iowa, Beck directly addressed doctrinal issues between Mormons and evangelical Christians (the latter often consider the former a &quot;cult&quot; rather than Christian) on his radio show in September 2012. During the one-hour show, he asked his audience, &quot;Does Mitt Romney&#x27;s Mormonism make him too scary or weird to be elected president of the United States?&quot; The article concluded by addressing the &quot;fear of making Mormonism mainstream&quot; as a reason Beck could be acceptable to evangelicals and Romney not be, quoting John C. Green, the author of &quot;The Faith Factor: How Religion Influences American Elections&quot;:

There&#x27;s a difference between a public figure like Glenn Beck and someone who could be the president of the United States. ... Many evangelicals believe this country was founded by Christian leaders. It is important that the person in the White House be positive about Christianity, if not a devout Christian himself.

=== Restoring Love rally and &quot;Day of Service&quot; ===
In August 2012, Beck held a rally at AT&amp;T Stadium in Irving, Texas. The event&#x27;s theme was service to one&#x27;s fellow citizens, and loving each other. The event saw a &quot;Day of Service&quot;, which saw Mercury One volunteering to feed homeless and disadvantaged people, doing community-building projects, and mowing lawns. It culminated in a keynote speech by Beck imploring the audience to &quot;commit to each other. Go home and wake up your neighbors.&quot; Of serving fellow Americans, Beck said, &quot;Those who count us out are counting on one weekend of action, one weekend of speeches. One weekend. One day. Please, my fellow countrymen, let this be the first of many.&quot;

=== Restoring Unity and Never Again Is Now ===
In August 2015, Beck and Mercury Radio Arts organized a rally that saw a little over 20,000 people march through the streets of Birmingham, Alabama, in a statement of unity and support for persecuted Christians in Iraq, a cause Mercury One focuses on, and as a call for unity among the American people. After the march, the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex held a rally featuring speakers including Beck, Ted Cruz, Rafael Cruz, Jon Voight, Alveda King, and David Barton.

== Political views ==
Beck has called himself a conservative with libertarian leanings. Among his core values, he lists personal responsibility, private charity, the right to life, freedom of religion, limited government, and the family as the cornerstone of society. Beck believes in low national debt, and has said, &quot;A conservative believes that debt creates unhealthy relationships. Everyone, from the government on down, should live within their means and strive for financial independence.&quot; He supports individual gun ownership rights, opposes gun control legislation, and supports the NRA and its state chapters.

Beck rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. He contests the evidence, and has said, &quot;There is more proof for the resurrection of Jesus than man-made climate change.&quot; He views the American Clean Energy and Security Act as a form of wealth redistribution, and he has promoted a petition rejecting the Kyoto Protocol.

Although opposed to illegal immigration, Beck announced in 2014 that Mercury One would make efforts to provide food and relief to the large numbers of migrant children.

On March 18, 2015, Beck announced that he had left the Republican Party, saying that it had failed to effectively stand against Obamacare and immigration reform, and because of its opposition to lawmakers such as Mike Lee and Ted Cruz.

Beck endorsed Cruz for president of the United States in 2016. In October 2016, Beck called opposing Donald Trump a &quot;moral, ethical choice&quot;. On the campaign trail in support of Cruz, Beck said, &quot;If Donald Trump wins, it is going to be a snowball to hell.&quot; After Cruz dropped out of the race, Beck endorsed independent Evan McMullin.

=== Opposition to progressivism ===
During his 2010 keynote speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Beck wrote &quot;progressivism&quot; on a chalkboard and declared, &quot;This is the disease. This is the disease in America&quot;, adding that &quot;progressivism is the cancer in America and it is eating our Constitution!&quot; According to Beck, the progressive ideas of men such as John Dewey, Herbert Croly, and Walter Lippmann, influenced the presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, eventually becoming the foundation for President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. Beck has said that such progressivism infects both main political parties and threatens to &quot;destroy America as it was originally conceived&quot;. In his book &quot;Common Sense&quot;, he argues that &quot;progressivism has less to do with the parties and more to do with individuals who seek to redefine, reshape, and rebuild America into a country where individual liberties and personal property mean nothing if they conflict with the plans and goals of the State.&quot;

A collection of progressives whom Beck has called &quot;Crime Inc.&quot; make up what he contends is a clandestine conspiracy to take over and transform the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;5/17/2010&quot;&gt;&quot;Crime Inc.: Redistribution of Wealth&quot; , &quot;Glenn Beck Program&quot;, May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these include Cass Sunstein, Van Jones, Andy Stern, John Podesta, Wade Rathke, Joel Rogers and Francis Fox Piven. Other figures Beck has tied to &quot;Crime Inc.&quot; include Al Gore, Franklin Raines,&lt;ref name=&quot;4/30/2010&quot;&gt;&quot;Glenn Beck: Crime Inc.&quot; , &quot;Glenn Beck Program&quot;, April 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Maurice Strong, George Soros,&lt;ref name=&quot;6/22/2010&quot;&gt;Glenn Beck:&#x27; Soros Poised to Profit?&quot; Fox News, June 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; John Holdren and Barack Obama. According to Beck, these people already have or are surreptitiously working to fulfill their agenda with an array of organizations and corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Fannie Mae, ACORN, Apollo Alliance, Tides Center, Chicago Climate Exchange, Generation Investment Management, Enterprise Community Partners, Petrobras, Center for American Progress, and the SEIU. In his quest to root out these &quot;progressives&quot;, Beck has compared himself to Israeli Nazi hunters, vowing on his radio show that &quot;to the day I die I am going to be a progressive-hunter. I&#x27;m going to find these people that have done this to our country and expose them. I don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re in nursing homes.&quot; Beck compared Al Gore to the Nazis while equating the campaign against global warming to the Nazi campaign against the Jews.

According to the book &quot;The Philosophy of Conspiracy Theories&quot;, Beck &quot;believes in the existence of a large-scale, long-term socialist conspiracy – encompassing elements of both the Democratic and Republican Parties – to deny American citizens their God-given rights to liberty and freedom from taxation.&quot;

Progressive historian Sean Wilentz has denounced what he calls Beck&#x27;s progressive-themed conspiracy theories and &quot;gross historical inaccuracies&quot;, contending that Beck is merely echoing the decades-old &quot;right-wing extremism&quot; of the John Birch Society. According to Wilentz, Beck&#x27;s &quot;version of history&quot; places him in a long line of figures who have challenged mainstream political historians and presented an inaccurate opposing view as the truth, stating:

Conservative David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, has also alleged Beck&#x27;s propensity for negationism, remarking, &quot;Beck offers a story about the American past for people who are feeling right now very angry and alienated. It is different enough from the usual story in that he makes them feel like they&#x27;ve got access to secret knowledge.&quot;

In 2020, Beck argued that the election of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders could lead to &quot;another Holocaust.&quot;

=== Barack Obama and the Obama administration ===
Beck promoted numerous conspiracy theories and falsehoods about President Barack Obama and the Obama administration. He suggested that Obama was building FEMA concentration camps to put opponents in, that Obama was planning to fake a terrorist attack such as the Oklahoma City bombing to boost the administration&#x27;s popularity, and that Obama was George Soros&#x27;s &quot;puppet&quot;. He often likened Obama and his administration to Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. Beck falsely claimed that the John Holdren, who led the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Obama administration, &quot;proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population.&quot;

In 2009, Beck argued that Obama had repeatedly shown &quot;a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture&quot;, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not saying he doesn&#x27;t like white people. I&#x27;m saying he has a problem. This guy is, I believe, a racist.&quot; These remarks drew criticism and resulted in a boycott in which at least 57 advertisers requested that their ads be removed from his programming. He later apologized for the remarks, telling Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace that he has a &quot;big fat mouth&quot; and miscast as racism what is actually, as he theorizes, Obama&#x27;s belief in black theology. In November 2012, Beck attempted to auction a mason jar holding an Obama figurine described as submerged in urine but in fact submerged in beer. Bidding reached $11,000 before eBay decided to remove the auction and cancel all bids.

In a 2016 interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Beck said of his commentary on Obama: &quot;I did a lot of freaking out about Barack Obama.&quot; He added, &quot;Obama made me a better man.&quot; Beck said that he regrets calling Obama a racist and supports Black Lives Matter. He said, &quot;There are things unique to the African-American experience that I cannot relate to. I had to listen to them.&quot;

==== Van Jones ====
In July 2009, Beck began to focus many episodes on his TV and radio shows on Van Jones, special advisor for Green Jobs at Obama&#x27;s White House Council on Environmental Quality. Beck called Jones a &quot;self-avowed, radical revolutionary communist&quot;. PolitiFact rated Beck&#x27;s claim &quot;mostly false&quot;, noting that Jones, who has been open about his past as a communist during the early 1990s, had since expressed firmly capitalist beliefs.

Beck also criticized Jones for his involvement in STORM, a Bay Area radical group with Marxist roots, and his support for death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal, who had been convicted of killing a police officer. Beck spotlighted a video of Jones calling Republicans &quot;assholes&quot;, and a petition Jones signed suggesting that George W. Bush knowingly let the September 11 attacks happen. &quot;Time&quot; magazine credited Beck with leading conservatives&#x27; attack on Jones.

In a move &quot;The New York Times&quot; called a White House response to the controversies, Jones said that &quot;the agenda of this president was bigger than any one individual&quot; and resigned his position in September 2009. Jones called his opponents&#x27; attacks as a &quot;vicious smear campaign&quot; and an effort to use &quot;lies and distortions to distract and divide&quot;.

==== Cass Sunstein ====
Cass Sunstein, Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Obama White House, was a frequent target of Beck&#x27;s conspiracy theories. Beck led opposition against Sunstein&#x27;s nomination to the position, calling Sunstein &quot;the most dangerous man in America&quot; and suggesting that Sunstein was plotting ways to &quot;ban&quot; conspiracy theorizing.

=== ACORN ===
In 2009, Beck and other conservative commentators were critical of Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) making multiple claims including voter registration fraud in the 2008 presidential election. In September 2009, he broadcast a series of alleged undercover videos by conservative activists James O&#x27;Keefe and Hannah Giles, which portrayed ACORN community organizers offering inappropriate tax and other advice to people who had said they wanted to import &quot;very young&quot; girls from El Salvador to work as child prostitutes. Following the videos&#x27; release, the U.S. Census Bureau severed ties with the group while the U.S. House and Senate voted to cut all of its federal funding.

On December 7, 2009, the former Massachusetts Attorney General, after an independent internal investigation of ACORN, found the videos that had been released appeared to have been edited, &quot;in some cases substantially&quot;. He found no evidence of criminal conduct by ACORN employees, but concluded that ACORN had poor management practices that contributed to unprofessional actions by a number of its low-level employees. On March 1, 2010, the District Attorney&#x27;s office for Brooklyn determined that the videos were &quot;heavily edited&quot; and concluded that there was no criminal wrongdoing by the ACORN staff in the videos from the Brooklyn ACORN office. On April 1, 2010, an investigation by the California Attorney General found the videos from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Bernardino to be &quot;heavily edited&quot;, and the investigation did not find evidence of criminal conduct on the part of ACORN employees. On June 14, 2010, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released its findings, which showed that ACORN evidenced no sign that it, or any of its related organizations, mishandled any federal money they had received. In March 2010, ACORN announced it would be closing its offices and disbanding due to loss of funding from government and private donors.

According to a 2010 study in the journal &quot;Perspectives on Politics&quot;, Beck played a prominent role in media attacks on ACORN.

=== Satire website ===
In 2009, lawyers for Beck brought a case (&quot;Beck v. Eiland-Hall&quot;) against the owner of a satirical website named &quot;GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com&quot; with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The claim that the domain name of the website is itself defamatory was described as a first in cyberlaw. Beck&#x27;s lawyers argued that the site infringed on his trademarked name and that the domain name should be turned over to Beck. The WIPO ruled against Beck, but Eiland-Hall voluntarily transferred the domain to Beck anyway, saying that the First Amendment had been upheld and that he no longer had a use for the domain name.

=== Jewish Funds for Justice ===
In January 2011, in protest against what they saw as inappropriate references to the Holocaust and to Nazis by Beck (and by Roger Ailes of Fox News), four hundred rabbis signed an open letter published as a paid advertisement in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. The ad was paid for by Jewish Funds for Justice (JFFJ), which had previously called for Beck&#x27;s firing. The JFFJ have claimed on their website that Beck seems &quot;to draw his material straight from the anti-Semitic forgery, the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;&quot;. The letter states that Beck and Fox had &quot;diminish[ed] the memory and meaning of the Holocaust when you use it to discredit any individual or organization you disagree with. That is what Fox News has done in recent weeks.&quot; In response, a Fox News executive told Reuters the letter was from a &quot;George Soros-backed leftwing political organization&quot;.

=== George Soros conspiracy theories ===
Beck is a prominent proponent of conspiracy theories about George Soros, a Jewish philanthropist. Beck falsely claimed that Soros as a boy helped to &quot;send the Jews to the death camps.&quot; Beck frequently referred to Soros as a puppet-master and repeated the unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that Soros caused the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In 2010, Beck was accused of being anti-Semitic due to his smears against Soros. The Anti-Defamation League said Beck&#x27;s remarks about Soros sending Jews to the death camps were &quot;horrific&quot; and &quot;totally off-limits.&quot;

On February 22, 2011, during a discussion on his radio show about the controversy surrounding his earlier comments about Soros, Beck said &quot;Reform Rabbis are generally political in nature. It&#x27;s almost like radicalized Islam in a way where it&#x27;s less about religion than it is about politics.&quot; He was quickly criticized by other conservatives, rabbis, and others. The Anti-Defamation League labeled Beck&#x27;s remarks &quot;bigoted ignorance&quot;. On February 24, Beck apologized on air, agreeing that his comments were &quot;ignorant&quot;.

In 2016, Beck, a friend of actor and director Mel Gibson claimed he and Gibson shared a conversation in which Gibson claimed Jewish people had stolen a copy of &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; before its official theatrical release, and that Jewish people were assaulting him in the streets.

=== 2011 Norway attacks ===
Beck condemned the 2011 Norway attacks, but was condemned for his comparison of murdered and surviving members of the Norwegian Workers&#x27; Youth League to the Hitler Youth. He said, &quot;There was a shooting at a political camp which sounds a little like, you know, the Hitler Youth or whatever, you know what I mean. Who does a camp for kids that&#x27;s all about politics? Disturbing.&quot; The statement was ill-received in Norway, prompting political commentator and Labour party member Frank Aarebrot to label Beck as a &quot;vulgar propagandist&quot;, a &quot;swine&quot; and a &quot;fascist&quot;, and Torbjørn Eriksen, former press secretary to Norway&#x27;s prime minister Jens Stoltenberg, to describe Beck&#x27;s comment as &quot;a new low&quot;, adding that &quot;Glenn Beck&#x27;s comments are ignorant, incorrect and extremely hurtful&quot;. Commentators pointed out that groups affiliated with the Tea Party movement and the Beck-founded 9–12 Project also sponsor politically oriented camp programs for children.

=== Trump comments and 2016 SIRIUS XM Suspension ===
Beck opposed Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign for president, comparing him to Adolf Hitler and describing him as &quot;an immoral man who is absent decency or dignity.&quot;

Sirius XM suspended Beck on May 31, 2016, for remarks made during an interview a week earlier. During an interview with author Brad Thor about a hypothetical situation where Trump was abusing his power as president and Congress was unable to stop him, Thor asked &quot;what patriot will step up and [assassinate him] if, if, he oversteps his mandate as president?&quot; Thor and the show&#x27;s general manager both denied that the comments were a call for his assassination. Beck&#x27;s radio show was moved from the SIRIUS XM Patriot channel to the &quot;Triumph&quot; channel soon after.

Beck&#x27;s opposition to Trump did not sit well with many Trump supporters and hurt his businesses and viewership. On May 18, 2018, Beck stated on his radio program that he intended to vote for Trump in the 2020 presidential election, calling Trump&#x27;s record &quot;pretty damn amazing&quot;. Beck said Trump&#x27;s defeat in the 2020 election would be &quot;the end of the country as we know it.&quot;

== Influences ==
=== Political and historical ===
An author with ideological influence on Beck is W. Cleon Skousen (1913–2006), a prolific conservative political writer, American constitutionalist and faith based political theorist. As an anti-communist supporter of the John Birch Society, and a limited-government activist, Skousen, who was Mormon, wrote on a wide range of subjects: the Six-Day War, Mormon eschatology, New World Order conspiracies, even parenting. Skousen believed that American political, social, and economic elites were working with communists to foist a world government on the United States. Beck praised Skousen&#x27;s &quot;words of wisdom&quot; as &quot;divinely inspired&quot;, referencing Skousen&#x27;s &quot;The Naked Communist&quot; and especially &quot;The 5,000 Year Leap&quot; (originally published in 1981), which Beck said in 2007 had &quot;changed his life&quot;. According to Skousen&#x27;s nephew, Mark Skousen, &quot;Leap&quot; reflects Skousen&#x27;s &quot;passion for the United States Constitution&quot;, which he &quot;felt was inspired by God and the reason behind America&#x27;s success as a nation&quot;. The book is recommended by Beck as &quot;required reading&quot; to understand the current American political landscape and become a &quot;September twelfth person&quot;. Beck authored a foreword for the 2008 edition of &quot;Leap&quot; and Beck&#x27;s on-air recommendations in 2009 propelled the book to number one in the government category on Amazon for several months. In 2010, Matthew Continetti of the conservative &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; criticized Beck&#x27;s conspiratorial bent, terming him &quot;a Skousenite&quot;. Additionally, Alexander Zaitchik, author of the 2010 book &quot;Common Nonsense: Glenn Beck and the Triumph of Ignorance&quot;, which features an entire chapter on &quot;The Ghost of Cleon Skousen&quot;, refers to Skousen as &quot;Beck&#x27;s favorite author and biggest influence&quot;, while observing he authored four of the 10 books on Beck&#x27;s 9-12 Project required-reading list.

In his discussion of Beck and Skousen, Continetti said that one of Skousen&#x27;s works &quot;draws on Carroll Quigley&#x27;s &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot; (1966), which argues that the history of the 20th century is the product of secret societies in conflict&quot;. He observed in Beck&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Overton Window&quot; (which Beck describes as &quot;faction&quot;, or fiction based on fact), a character says: &quot;Carroll Quigley laid open the plan in &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;, the only hope to avoid the tragedy of war was to bind together the economies of the world to foster global stability and peace.&quot;

Beck&#x27;s views on early-20th-century progressivism are greatly influenced by Ronald J. Pestritto, who teaches at Hillsdale College. The portal page GlennBeck.com for &quot;American Progressivism&quot; uses Pestritto&#x27;s teachings and links directly to one of his books. Pestritto wrote an article for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; detailing &quot;Glenn Beck, Progressives and Me&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that Pestritto was a regular guest on Beck&#x27;s Fox News show, .

Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz says that alongside Skousen, John Birch Society founder Robert W. Welch, Jr., is a key ideological foundation of Beck&#x27;s worldview. According to Wilentz, Beck &quot;has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of.&quot;

Other books that Beck regularly cites on his programs are Amity Shlaes&#x27;s &quot;The Forgotten Man&quot;, Jonah Goldberg&#x27;s &quot;Liberal Fascism&quot;, Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen&#x27;s &quot;A Patriot&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;, and Burton W. Folsom, Jr.&#x27;s &quot;New Deal or Raw Deal&quot;. Beck has also urged his listeners to read &quot;The Coming Insurrection&quot;, a book by a French Marxist group discussing what they see as the imminent collapse of capitalist culture.

On June 4, 2010, Beck endorsed Elizabeth Dilling&#x27;s 1936 work &quot;The Red Network: A Who&#x27;s Who and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots&quot;, remarking, &quot;this is a book, &quot;The Red Network&quot;, this came in from 1936. People, [Joseph] McCarthy was absolutely right ... This is, who were the communists in America.&quot; Beck was criticized by an array of people, including Menachem Z. Rosensaft and Joe Conason, who said that Dilling was an outspoken anti-Semite and a Nazi sympathizer.

=== Religious ===
Beck has credited God for saving him from drug and alcohol abuse, professional obscurity, and friendlessness. In 2006, he performed an inspirational monologue in Salt Lake City, Utah, detailing how he was transformed by the &quot;healing power of Jesus Christ&quot;, which was released as a CD two years later by Deseret Book, a publishing company owned by the LDS Church, entitled &quot;An Unlikely Mormon: The Conversion Story of Glenn Beck&quot;.

Writer Joanna Brooks contends that Beck developed his &quot;amalgamation of anti-communism&quot; and &quot;connect-the-dots conspiracy theorizing&quot; only after his entry into the &quot;deeply insular world of Mormon thought and culture&quot;. Brooks theorizes that Beck&#x27;s calls to fasting and prayer are rooted in Mormon collective fasts to address spiritual challenges, while his &quot;overt sentimentality&quot; and penchant for weeping represent the hallmark of a &quot;distinctly Mormon mode of masculinity&quot; where &quot;appropriately-timed displays of tender emotion are displays of power&quot; and spirituality. Philip Barlow, the Arrington chair of Mormon history and culture at Utah State University, has said that Beck&#x27;s belief that the U.S. Constitution was an &quot;inspired document&quot; and his calls for limited government and not exiling God from the public sphere &quot;have considerable sympathy in Mormonism&quot;. Beck has acknowledged that Mormon doctrine is different from traditional Christianity, but said that this was what attracted him to it: &quot;for me some of the things in traditional doctrine just doesn&#x27;t work.&quot;

== Public reception ==
In 2009, Beck&#x27;s show was one of the highest rated news commentary programs on cable TV. For a Barbara Walters ABC special, Beck was selected as one of America&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Most Fascinating People&quot; of 2009. In 2010, he was selected for &quot;Time&quot;″s top 100 most influential people under the &quot;Leaders&quot; category.

Beck has called himself an entertainer, a commentator rather than a reporter, and a &quot;rodeo clown&quot;. He has said that he identifies with Howard Beale, a character portrayed by Peter Finch in the film &quot;Network&quot;: &quot;When he came out of the rain and he was like, &#x27;none of this makes any sense&#x27;—I am that guy.&quot;
According to &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;, Beck&#x27;s supporters have praised him as a constitutional stalwart defending their traditional American values.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine described Beck as &quot;the new populist superstar of Fox News&quot;, saying it is easier to see a set of attitudes rather than a specific ideology, noting his criticism of Wall Street, yet defending bonuses to AIG, as well as denouncing conspiracy theories about the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) but warning against indoctrination of children by the AmeriCorps program.&quot; (Paul Krugman and Mark Potok, on the other hand, have been among those asserting that Beck helps spread &quot;hate&quot; by covering issues that stir up extremists.) What seems to unite Beck&#x27;s disparate themes, &quot;Time&quot; argued, is a sense of siege. An earlier &quot;Time&quot; cover story called Beck &quot;a gifted storyteller with a knack for stitching seemingly unrelated data points into possible conspiracies&quot;, proclaiming that he has &quot;emerged as a virtuoso on the strings&quot; of conservative discontent by mining &quot;the timeless theme of the corrupt Them thwarting a virtuous Us&quot;.

Beck&#x27;s shows have been called a &quot;mix of moral lessons, outrage and an apocalyptic view of the future ... capturing the feelings of an alienated class of Americans&quot;. One of Beck&#x27;s Fox News Channel colleagues, Shepard Smith, has jokingly called Beck&#x27;s studio the &quot;fear chamber&quot;, with Beck countering that he preferred the term &quot;doom room&quot;.

Republican South Carolina U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham criticized Beck as a &quot;cynic&quot; whose show was antithetical to &quot;American values&quot; at &quot;The Atlantic&quot;&#x27;s 2009 First Draft of History conference, remarking, &quot;Only in America can you make that much money crying.&quot; The progressive watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting&#x27;s (FAIR) Activism Director, Peter Hart, argues that Beck red-baits political adversaries and promotes a paranoid view of progressive politics. Howard Kurtz, of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, has remarked, &quot;Love him or hate him, Beck is a talented, often funny broadcaster, a recovering alcoholic with an unabashedly emotional style.&quot;

Laura Miller writes in &quot;Salon&quot; that Beck is a contemporary example of &quot;the paranoid style in American politics&quot; described by historian Richard Hofstader:
Beck has acknowledged accusations of being a conspiracy theorist, saying on his show that there is a &quot;concentrated effort now to label me a conspiracy theorist&quot;.

Particularly as a consequence of Beck&#x27;s Restoring Honor rally in 2010, the fact that Beck is Mormon caused concern among some politically sympathetic Christian Evangelicals on theological grounds. Tom Tradup, vice president at Salem Radio Network, which serves more than 2,000 Christian-themed stations, expressed this sentiment after the rally, saying, &quot;Politically, everyone is with it, but theologically, when he says the country should turn back to God, the question is: Which God?&quot; A September 2010 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) and Religion News Service (RNS) found that of those Americans who hold a favorable opinion of Beck, only 45% believe he is the right person to lead a religious movement, with that number further declining to 37% when people are informed he is Mormon. Daniel Cox, director of research for PRRI, summed up this position by stating:
Pete Peterson of Pepperdine&#x27;s Davenport Institute said that Beck&#x27;s speech at the rally belonged to an American tradition of calls to personal renewal. Peterson wrote: &quot;A Mormon surrounded onstage by priests, pastors, rabbis, and imams, Beck [gave] one of the more ecumenical jeremiads in history.&quot; Evangelical pastor Tony Campolo said in 2010 that conservative evangelicals respond to Beck&#x27;s framing of conservative economic principles, saying that Beck&#x27;s and ideological fellow travelers&#x27; &quot;marriage between evangelicalism and patriotic nationalism is so strong that anybody who is raising questions about loyalty to the old, lassez-faire capitalist system is ex-post facto unpatriotic, un-American, and by association non-Christian.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; religion reporter Lisa Miller, after quoting Campolo, opined, &quot;It&#x27;s ironic that Beck, a Mormon, would gain acceptance as a leader of a new Christian coalition. ... Beck&#x27;s gift ... is to articulate God&#x27;s special plan for America in such broad strokes that they trample no single creed or doctrine while they move millions with their message.&quot;

=== Critical biographies ===
In June 2010, investigative reporter Alexander Zaitchik released a critical biography, &quot;Common Nonsense: Glenn Beck and the Triumph of Ignorance&quot;, with a title mocking Beck&#x27;s work, &quot;Common Sense&quot;. In an interview about the book, Zaitchik theorized, &quot;Beck&#x27;s politics and his insatiable hunger for money and fame are not mutually exclusive&quot;, adding:
In September 2010, &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; reporter Will Bunch released &quot;The Backlash: Right-Wing Radicals, High-Def Hucksters, and Paranoid Politics in the Age of Obama&quot;. One of Bunch&#x27;s theses is that Beck is nothing more than a morning zoo deejay playing a fictional character as a money-making stunt. Writer Bob Cesca, in a review of Bunch&#x27;s book, compares Beck to Steve Martin&#x27;s faith-healer character in the 1992 film &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, before describing the &quot;derivative grab bag of other tried and tested personalities&quot; that Bunch contends comprises Beck&#x27;s persona:

In October 2010 a polemical biography by Dana Milbank was released: &quot;Tears of a Clown: Glenn Beck and the Tea Bagging of America&quot;.

=== Satire, spoof and parody ===
Beck has been the subject of mockery and ridicule by a number of humorists. In response to his animated delivery and views, he was parodied in an impersonation by Jason Sudeikis on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. &quot;The Daily Show&quot;″s Jon Stewart has spoofed Beck&#x27;s 9–12 project with his own &quot;11-3 project&quot;, consisting of &quot;11 principles and 3 herbs and spices&quot;, impersonated Beck&#x27;s chalk board-related presentation style for an entire show, and quipped about Beck: &quot;finally, a guy who says what people who aren&#x27;t thinking are thinking&quot;. Stephen Colbert of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; satirized Beck&#x27;s &quot;war room&quot; by creating his own &quot;doom bunker&quot;. Through the character Eric Cartman, &quot;South Park&quot; parodied Beck&#x27;s television program and his commentary style in the episode &quot;Dances with Smurfs&quot;. &quot;The Onion&quot;, a satirical periodical and faux news site, ran an &quot;Onion News Network&quot; video &quot;special report&quot; lamenting that the &quot;victim in a fatal car accident was tragically not Glenn Beck&quot;. Meanwhile, the &quot;Current TV&quot; cartoon &quot;SuperNews!&quot; ran an animated cartoon feature titled &quot;The Glenn Beck Apocalypse&quot;, where Beck is confronted by Jesus Christ, who rebukes him as the equivalent of &quot;Sarah Palin farting into a balloon&quot;. Political comedian and satirist Bill Maher has mocked Beck&#x27;s followers as an &quot;army of diabetic mallwalkers&quot;, while &quot;The Buffalo Beast&quot; named Beck the most loathsome person in America in 2010, declaring, &quot;It&#x27;s like someone found a manic, doom-prophesying hobo in a sandwich board, shaved him, shot him full of Zoloft and gave him a show.&quot; The October 30, 2010, Rally To Restore Sanity and/or Fear in Washington, hosted by Comedy Central personalities Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, was conceived as a parody of Beck&#x27;s earlier Rally to Restore Honor, even though Stewart and Colbert said that they came up with the idea of holding a rally in March and Stewart had put down the deposit for the National Mall before Beck announced his rally.

== Defamation lawsuit and settlement ==
In March 2014, Abdulrahman Alharbi filed suit for defamation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Beck and his business entities, The Blaze and Mercury Radio Arts, along with his distributor Premiere Radio Networks. Alharbi&#x27;s defamation claim arose from Beck&#x27;s repeated broadcasts &quot;identifying Alharbi as an active participant&quot; in the Boston Marathon bombing, even after federal authorities cleared Alharbi, who was injured in the attack, of any wrongdoing and confirmed that he was an innocent victim. In December 2014, the judge rejected Beck&#x27;s attempt to have the case dismissed. In September 2016, the suit was settled on confidential terms.

<doc id="418945" wikidata="Q2449737" url="?curid=418945" title="Stone, Staffordshire">
<text>Stone is a market town and civil parish in Staffordshire, England; it is situated approximately 7 miles (11 km) north of the county town of Stafford, 7 miles (11 km) south of Stoke-on-Trent and 15 miles (24 km) north of Rugeley. As a notable canal town, Stone is recognised for its rich history, originating from the early Bronze Age and continuing through the Industrial Revolution, with the introduction of the Trent and Mersey Canal shaping the town&#x27;s development and local industry.

Originally governed as an urban district council and a rural district council, Stone became part of the Borough of Stafford in 1974. Over the years, the town has seen a steady growth in its population, which was recorded as 12,305 in the 1991 census, 14,555 in 2001 and 16,385 in 2011.

== Etymology ==
The place-name&#x27;s meaning is exactly what is stated, a &quot;stone, rock&quot;, from the Old English &quot;&quot; (stone).

The local story is that the town was named after the pile of stones taken from the River Trent raised on the graves of the two princes, Ruffin and Wulfad, killed in AD 665 by their father, King Wulfhere of Mercia, because of their conversion to Christianity. However, this legend is unlikely to be true. Wulfhere was already a Christian when he became king, and the story on which it is probably based is set by Bede in another part of the country over ten years after Wulfhere&#x27;s death.

More recent research points to older, though no less interesting nor tangible, possibilities regarding its name and founding. Around Stone lie several Romano-British sites and it is not inconceivable that the name alludes to the stone remains of a bridge or milestone, perhaps continuing the Roman road from Rocester to Blythe Bridge and then potentially through Stone. The settlement of Walton (which now forms a suburb) is ancient Brythonic (Celtic/ancient Briton place name). The most likely derivation for most places called Stone is from a prehistoric megalith, Roman milestone, a natural boulder or rock formation, or from &#x27;a place where stone was obtained&#x27;. A Keuper sandstone outcrop on the north side of Stone, long quarried for building materials, may be the topographical feature from which the place was named. It may also be noted that a huge stone or erratic is recorded on Common Plot and in that respect it is unclear whether Stone Field here, one of the open-fields of Stone, is &#x27;the field at Stone&#x27; or &#x27;the field with the stone&#x27;.

== History ==
There is a Bronze Age ring ditch at Pirehill suggesting occupation in prehistoric times.

Stone lies within the territory of the Iron Age Celtic tribe &#x27;the Cornovii&#x27; (people of the horn; perhaps a horned god or topographical feature), mentioned by Ptolemy 2nd century AD in &quot;Geographia&quot;. To the north-west of Stone lies one of their hill forts, which overlooks the Trent and perhaps the salt production in the region.

The early history of Stone is unclear and is clouded by the 12th century medieval romance concerning the murder of the Saxon princes Wulfad and Rufin by their father Wulfhere of Mercia, who reputedly had his base near Darleston (Wulfherecester). The murder of Wulfad in the 7th century and his subsequent entombment under a cairn of stones is the traditional story (described as &quot;historically valueless&quot; by Thacker 1985: 6).

The church built over the stones marking the graves of Wulfad and Rufin in 670 lasted until the 9th century, before being destroyed by invading Danes. It was replaced in 1135 by the Augustinian Stone Priory, which survived until its dissolution in the reign of Henry VIII. The building collapsed in 1749 and the present church of St. Michael&#x27;s was built in 1758. All that remains of the original priory is the rib-vaulted undercroft which forms the foundations beneath Priory House, which is located on Lichfield Street opposite the Frank Jordan Community Centre.

Stone lay within the Pirehill hundred of Staffordshire named after nearby Pire Hill. In 1251, Henry III granted Stone a market charter.
The Common Plot (also known as &quot;Mudley Pits&quot;) is a large area of open and wooded common land, sited just to the north of the town of Stone. It was reserved as an area of common land for the inhabitants of the town when the previous strip-farmed fields were enclosed by the &quot;&quot; (38 Geo. 3. c. &quot;78&quot;). The Duke of Cumberland built extensive winter fortifications and a camp here; traces of which can still be seen, during the winter of 1745/46. The purpose of the camp was to bring the Duke&#x27;s army down from the freezing Staffordshire Moorlands and Peak District, where they had been seeking to stop an advance on London by a force of 6,000 Jacobite rebels. The rebels were thought to be using pack-horse routes over the high country, with the aim of reaching Derby. Stone was also strategic in preventing any break-away Jacobite group going across to Wales to recruit more men there but, with winter coming on, the Jacobites decided to retreat back to Scotland.

Stone Urban District was an urban district, based on the Stone civil parish which equates to the town of Stone. There were two amendments in parts of the Stone Rural parish in Stone Rural District were transferred in. The district was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 and replaced with Stafford Borough Council and Stone Town Council. The latter publishes a history of Stone.

=== Roads ===
Stone stands in the valley of the River Trent, and was an important stopping-off point for stagecoaches on one of the roads turnpiked in the 18th century. A directory for 1851 says that &quot;Stone was a very lively town and a great thoroughfare for coaches, carriers and travellers. No fewer than 38 stage coaches passed through the town daily.&quot; The main coaching route was the London to Holyhead route, via Watling Street as far as Lichfield and then the A51.

To support the coaching trade, Stone was a principal stopping point with many coaching inns to refresh both horses and travellers. Notable hostelries include the Crown Hotel, Crown &amp; Anchor, Red Lion and the Black Horse Inn.

=== The Trent and Mersey Canal ===

The River Trent, which runs through the town, had been used for cargo-carrying vessels since Roman times, but further inland smaller boats could only be used. Seasonal fluctuations in water depth proved insurmountable, although cargo could be carried from the sea as far south as Wilden Ferry (south-east of Derby), where the River Derwent joins the Trent and increases the quantity of water, then onwards by road. Prior to tarmac roads, journeys overland by roads were slow and delicate wares were prone to breakages over the rough terrain.

James Brindley, the canal builder, put forward the scheme to build what he called the &quot;Grand Trunk Canal&quot; to connect the two rivers, Mersey and Trent in 1766. It was backed by Josiah Wedgwood, who saw that it offered an efficient way to bring raw materials to the potteries and to transport finished wares to his customers.

By 29 September 1772, two days Brindley&#x27;s death, 48 miles of the Grand Trunk Canal (now known as the Trent and Mersey Canal) from Wilden Ferry to Stone was navigable; the length past Burton-on-Trent was completed in 1770.

On completion of the Star Lock, a grand opening was held and during this opening a cannon was fired in celebration; however, disaster struck and the cannon damaged the new lock, requiring a rebuild.

Stone became the headquarters of the canal company with its office at Westbridge House, sited then below Star Lock on what is now Westbridge Park. The offices were moved later to Stoke-on-Trent.

=== Brewing industry ===
Due to the quality of the local water beneath Stone, two brewers were located here carrying on the Augustinian monks&#x27; tradition of beer making. The most notable was John Joule &amp; Sons Ltd, established in 1780. The company was acquired by Bass Charrington in 1968 and ceased brewing at the end of October 1974. The brewery was demolished in the autumn of 1977; the adjacent bottling plant was closed some years before. The canal played a great part in the export of beer. Joules once owned a pair of boats that delivered coal to the brewery and, as late as the 1950s, had the telephone number &quot;Stone 1&quot;. Joules&#x27; draught beer stores and bottling plant remains an imposing building on the canal and can be clearly identified by the red cross logo of John Joules in the brickwork.

The second brewer was Montgomery &amp; Co, acquired by the Bent&#x27;s Brewery Co of Liverpool in 1889; it was located on what is now Mount Industrial Estate. It was also taken over by Bass Brewery and closed on 31 March 1968. The brewing industry in Stone ceased after the closure of Joules and Bents, following an aggressive takeover from the nearby Burton upon Trent brewers in the 1960s and 1970s. In recent years, it has begun anew with the opening of the Lymestone Brewery in 2008. This family-run microbrewery is based in part of the original Bents brewery.

More recently, a second microbrewery, trading under the name &quot;Joules&quot; (dropping the &#x27;John&#x27; due to trademark reasons), has begun brewing in Market Drayton, Shropshire. These local beers are available in multiple pubs across the town and the wider region; Lymestone Brewery also has their own public house, The Borehole Inn, situated next to the brewery itself on the Mount Industrial Estate.

The Star public house was fully licensed in 1819, although the building predates the canal by some 200 years. The building has in its time been a butcher&#x27;s shop and slaughterhouse. Stabling for boat horses was available up to the 1950s and the business relied heavily on the canal for trade.

=== Railway ===
The coming of the railway was to end Stone&#x27;s era as a coaching and canal town. The North Staffordshire Railway opened its main line from Stoke-on-Trent through Stone to Norton Bridge on 3 April 1848; the following year a branch line from Stone to Colwich began operating.

One industry that did flourish under the railway era was the shoe industry; at its height in 1851, there were 16 shoeworks. The industry however declined after Australia, the main shoe market, imposed an import tax on the industry.

==Buildings==
Stone has many buildings of interest including the Grade II listed Hayes House and the Catholic chapel of St Anne.

==Religion==

Stone Parish Church, dedicated to Saint Michael the Archangel, is at the south end of the town located on what used to be Stone Priory. It was commenced in 1753, and finished in 1758. The present clock dates from 1896.

Christ Church stands on the north side of the town, where the population is still increasing. It was erected in 1839.

==Education==
State education within Stone is based on the three tier school system, with a range of first and primary schools, two middle schools (Walton Priory Middle and Christchurch Academy) and a high school (Alleyne&#x27;s Academy). Independent education is served by the Catholic St Dominic&#x27;s Priory School founded with the convent of the same name in the 19th century by Mother Margaret Hallahan when the school was originally known as &quot;Blessed Imelda&#x27;s Enpension School&quot;.

==Economy==
Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service has its headquarters just south of Stone. Yarnfield Park Training and Conference Centre just outside the town is a major training centre for the UK telecommunications industry. It is owned by BT Group and run by Accenture.

The canal still dominates the town. Many canal side sites have in recent times been taken over for modern day use including The Moorings, a development of apartments based on the old Stubbs warehouse. Apartments and housing surround the old Trent Hospital, once the workhouse. Housing developments also border the canal.

Commercial traffic has now been replaced by the leisure craft that pass through Stone each year. The Canal Cruising Company today operates from the historic site of the canal maintenance and boat building operations of the Trent and Mersey Canal Company. This restored docks complex with its workshops, by Yard Lock, continues to be used for the maintenance of pleasure craft and historic boats. In 2010, a new marina opened just south of the town, below Aston Lock, with moorings for pleasure craft, a farm shop and a café.

Stone is the key UK manufacturing site for the Quickfit laboratory glassware system which finds widespread use in many school, college and university science departments.

The National Association of Chimney Sweeps is located in the town.

The Stone Food and Drink Festival takes place the first weekend in October and brings together the very best in local produce and cooking talent. It attracts in excess of 20,000 visitors to the town and runs for one week, with the main event on the town&#x27;s Westbridge Park on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

<doc id="418947" wikidata="Q461391" url="?curid=418947" title="Gavin Newsom">
<text>Gavin Christopher Newsom ( ; born October 10, 1967) is an American politician and businessman serving as the 40th governor of California since 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, he served from 2011 to 2019 as the 49th lieutenant governor of California and from 2004 to 2011 as the 42nd mayor of San Francisco.

Newsom graduated from Santa Clara University in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science in political science. Afterward, he founded the boutique winery PlumpJack Group in Oakville, California, with billionaire heir and family friend Gordon Getty as an investor. The company grew to manage 23 businesses, including wineries, restaurants, and hotels. Newsom began his political career in 1996, when San Francisco mayor Willie Brown appointed him to the city&#x27;s Parking and Traffic Commission. Brown then appointed Newsom to fill a vacancy on the Board of Supervisors the next year and Newsom was first elected to the board in 1998.

Newsom was elected mayor of San Francisco in 2003 and reelected in 2007. He was elected lieutenant governor of California in 2010. As lieutenant governor, Newsom hosted &quot;The Gavin Newsom Show&quot; from 2012 to 2013. He also wrote the 2013 book &quot;Citizenville&quot;, which focused on using digital tools for democratic change. He was reelected in 2014 and elected governor of California in 2018.

During his governorship, Newsom faced criticism for his personal behavior and leadership style during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly due to strict lockdown measures that some felt were overly restrictive and economically damaging. Controversies and frustration with his leadership contributed to an unsuccessful recall effort in 2021; he was reelected the next year with more than 59% of the vote.

== Early life ==
Gavin Christopher Newsom was born on October 10, 1967, in San Francisco, California, to Tessa Thomas (née Menzies) and William Alfred Newsom III, a state appeals court judge and attorney for Getty Oil. A fourth-generation San Franciscan, Newsom traces his roots to a prominent family with deep ties to the city. His maternal great-grandfather, Scotsman Thomas Addis, was a pioneering nephrologist and professor of medicine at Stanford University, noted for his groundbreaking research on kidney disease. Newsom is a second cousin, twice removed, of musician Joanna Newsom, and his aunt, Barbara Newsom, was married to Ron Pelosi, the brother-in-law of former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi.
Newsom’s parents divorced in 1971 when he was three years old, leaving his mother, Tessa, to raise him and his younger sister, Hilary Newsom Callan, largely on her own. Tessa worked three jobs—often as a waitress, bookkeeper, and secretary—to support the family, fostering a strong work ethic in her children. Newsom has described his childhood as challenging, shaped in part by financial instability and his struggle with &quot;pretty severe&quot; dyslexia, a condition that persists into adulthood. 
Newsom began his education at École Notre Dame des Victoires, a French-American bilingual Catholic school in San Francisco, attending kindergarten and first grade. However, his severe dyslexia—impacting his ability to read, write, spell, and perform numerical tasks (Dyscalculia)—prompted a transfer after first grade. He continued at Notre Dame des Victoires from third through fifth grades, where he was enrolled in remedial reading classes to cope with his learning difficulties. Throughout his academic years, he relied heavily on audiobooks, summaries, and verbal instruction, a preference that continues as he favors audio interpretations of documents and reports. In a 2023 interview with &quot; POLITICO &quot;, Newsom reflected on how dyslexia shaped his resilience, noting, &quot;It forced me to find workarounds and think differently—skills I still use every day as governor.&quot;
At Redwood High School in Larkspur, California, Newsom excelled athletically despite his academic struggles, graduating in 1985. He played basketball as a shooting guard and baseball as an outfielder, earning recognition on the cover of the &quot;Marin Independent Journal&quot; for his skills. His sister Hilary recalled lean Christmases when their mother warned them not to expect gifts, underscoring the family’s financial strain. Tessa opened their home to foster children, a practice that instilled in Newsom a lifelong commitment to public service. His father’s habit of donating much of his income further tightened the family’s finances, leading Newsom to take on various jobs—such as washing cars and working at a local deli—during high school to help out.
Newsom enrolled at Santa Clara University on a partial baseball scholarship, graduating in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science in political science. He tried out for the baseball team during his first two years but underwent elbow surgery in late 1985—later revealed as a procedure to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament—ending his varsity aspirations. He has credited the university’s Jesuit education with fostering his independent thinking and skepticism of conventional wisdom. During his junior year, Newsom spent a semester studying abroad in Rome, Italy, an experience he later described in a 2019 speech at Santa Clara as &quot;eye-opening,&quot; exposing him to global perspectives that influenced his political career.

== Business career ==
Newsom and his investors created the company PlumpJack Associates L.P. on May 14, 1991. The group started the PlumpJack Winery in 1992 with the financial help of his family friend Gordon Getty. PlumpJack was the name of an opera written by Getty, who invested in 10 of Newsom&#x27;s 11 businesses. Getty told the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; that he treated Newsom like a son and invested in his first business venture because of that relationship. According to Getty, later business investments were because of &quot;the success of the first&quot;.

One of Newsom&#x27;s early interactions with government occurred when Newsom resisted the San Francisco Department of Public Health&#x27;s requirement to install a sink at his PlumpJack wine store. The Health Department argued that wine was a food and required the store to install a $27,000 sink in the carpeted wine shop on the grounds that the shop needed the sink for a mop. When Newsom was later appointed supervisor, he told the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;: &quot;That&#x27;s the kind of bureaucratic malaise I&#x27;m going to be working through.&quot;

The business grew to an enterprise with more than 700 employees. The PlumpJack Cafe Partners L.P. opened the PlumpJack Café, also on Fillmore Street, in 1993. Between 1993 and 2000, Newsom and his investors opened several other businesses that included the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn with a PlumpJack Café (1994), a winery in Napa Valley (1995), the Balboa Café Bar and Grill (1995), the PlumpJack Development Fund L.P. (1996), the MatrixFillmore Bar (1998), PlumpJack Wines shop Noe Valley branch (1999), PlumpJackSport retail clothing (2000), and a second Balboa Café at Squaw Valley (2000). Newsom&#x27;s investments included five restaurants and two retail clothing stores. Newsom&#x27;s annual income was greater than $429,000 from 1996 to 2001. In 2002, his business holdings were valued at more than $6.9 million. Newsom gave a monthly $50 gift certificate to PlumpJack employees whose business ideas failed, because in his view, &quot;There can be no success without failure.&quot;

Newsom sold his share of his San Francisco businesses when he became mayor in 2004. He maintained his ownership in the PlumpJack companies outside San Francisco, including the PlumpJack Winery in Oakville, California, new PlumpJack-owned Cade Winery in Angwin, California, and the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn. He is the president in absentia of Airelle Wines Inc., which is connected to the PlumpJack Winery in Napa County. Newsom earned between $141,000 and $251,000 in 2007 from his business interests. In February 2006, he paid $2,350,000 for his residence in the Russian Hill neighborhood, which he put on the market in April 2009 for $3,000,000.

At the time of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, it was acknowledged that at least three of Newsom&#x27;s wine companies, PlumpJack, Cade and Odette, were Silicon Valley Bank clients.

== Early political career ==


Newsom&#x27;s first political experience came when he volunteered for Willie Brown&#x27;s successful campaign for mayor in 1995. Newsom hosted a private fundraiser at his PlumpJack Café. Brown appointed Newsom to a vacant seat on the Parking and Traffic Commission in 1996, and he was later elected president of the commission. Brown appointed him to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors seat vacated by Kevin Shelley in 1997. At the time, he was the youngest member of San Francisco&#x27;s board of supervisors.

Newsom was sworn in by his father and pledged to bring his business experience to the board. Brown called Newsom &quot;part of the future generation of leaders of this great city&quot;. Newsom described himself as a &quot;social liberal and a fiscal watchdog&quot;. He was elected to a full four-year term to the board in 1998. San Francisco voters chose to abandon at-large elections to the board for the previous district system in 1999. Newsom was reelected in 2000 and 2002 to represent the second district, which includes Pacific Heights, the Marina, Cow Hollow, Sea Cliff and Laurel Heights, which had San Francisco&#x27;s highest income level and highest Republican registration. Newsom paid $500 to the San Francisco Republican Party to appear on the party&#x27;s endorsement slate in 2000 while running for Supervisor. He was reelected.

As a San Francisco Supervisor, Newsom gained public attention for his role in advocating reform of the city&#x27;s municipal railway (Muni). He was one of two supervisors endorsed by Rescue Muni, a transit riders group, in his 1998 reelection. He sponsored Proposition B to require Muni and other city departments to develop detailed customer service plans. The measure passed with 56.6% of the vote. Newsom sponsored a ballot measure from Rescue Muni; a version of the measure was approved by voters in November 1999.

Newsom also supported allowing restaurants to serve alcohol at their outdoor tables, banning tobacco advertisements visible from the streets, stiffer penalties for landlords who run afoul of rent-control laws, and a resolution, which was defeated, to commend Colin Powell for raising money for youth programs. Newsom&#x27;s support for business interests at times strained his relationship with labor leaders.

During Newsom&#x27;s time as supervisor, he supported housing projects through public-private partnerships to increase homeownership and affordable housing in San Francisco. He supported HOPE, a failed local ballot measure that would have allowed an increased condo-conversion rate if a certain percentage of tenants within a building were buying their units. As a candidate for mayor, he supported building 10,000 new housing units to create 15,000 new construction jobs.

Newsom&#x27;s signature achievement as a supervisor was a voter initiative called Care Not Cash (Measure N), which offered care, supportive housing, drug treatment, and help from behavioral health specialists for the homeless in lieu of direct cash aid from the state&#x27;s general assistance program. Many homeless rights advocates protested against the initiative. &quot;Progressives and Democrats, nuns and priests, homeless advocates and homeless people were furious&quot;, Newsom said. The successfully passed ballot measure raised his political profile and provided the volunteers, donors, and campaign staff that helped make him a leading contender for the mayorship in 2003. In a city audit conducted four years after the inception of program and released in 2008, the program was evaluated as largely successful.

== Mayor of San Francisco (2004–2011) ==
=== Elections ===
==== 2003 ====
Newsom placed first in the November 4, 2003, general election in a nine-person field. He received 41.9% of the vote to Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez&#x27;s 19.6% in the first round of balloting, but faced a closer race in the December 9 runoff, when many of the city&#x27;s progressive groups supported Gonzalez. The race was partisan, with attacks against Gonzalez for his support of Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election, and attacks against Newsom for contributing $500 to a Republican slate mailer in 2000 that endorsed issues Newsom supported. Democratic leadership felt they needed to reinforce San Francisco as a Democratic stronghold after losing the 2000 presidential election and the 2003 gubernatorial recall election to Arnold Schwarzenegger. National Democratic Party figures, including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson, campaigned for Newsom. Five supervisors endorsed Gonzalez, while Willie Brown endorsed Newsom.

Newsom won the runoff with 53% of the vote to Gonzalez&#x27;s 47%, a margin of 11,000 votes. He ran as a business-friendly centrist Democrat and a moderate in San Francisco politics. Some of his opponents called him conservative. Newsom claimed he was a centrist in the Dianne Feinstein mold. He ran on the slogan &quot;great cities, great ideas&quot;, and presented over 21 policy papers. He pledged to continue working on San Francisco&#x27;s homelessness issue.

Newsom was sworn in as mayor on January 3, 2004. He called for unity among the city&#x27;s political factions, and promised to address the issues of public schools, potholes and affordable housing. Newsom said he was &quot;a different kind of leader&quot; who &quot;isn&#x27;t afraid to solve even the toughest problems&quot;.

====2007====

San Francisco&#x27;s progressive community tried to field a candidate to run a strong campaign against Newsom. Supervisors Ross Mirkarimi and Chris Daly considered running, but both declined. Gonzalez also decided not to challenge Newsom again.

When the August 10, 2007, filing deadline passed, San Francisco&#x27;s discussion shifted to talk about Newsom&#x27;s second term. He was challenged in the election by 13 candidates, including George Davis, a nudist activist, and Michael Powers, owner of the Power Exchange sex club. Conservative former supervisor Tony Hall withdrew by early September due to lack of support.

The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; declared in August 2007 that Newsom faced no &quot;serious threat to his re-election bid&quot;, having raised $1.6 million for his reelection campaign by early August. He was reelected on November 6 with over 72% of the vote. Upon taking office for a second term, Newsom promised to focus on the environment, homelessness, health care, education, housing, and rebuilding San Francisco General Hospital.

===Mayoralty===
As mayor, Newsom focused on development projects in Hunters Point and Treasure Island.

He gained national attention in 2004 when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, violating a state law passed in 2000. Implementation of Care Not Cash, the initiative he had sponsored as a supervisor, began on July 1, 2004. As part of the initiative, 5,000 more homeless people were given permanent shelter in the city. About 2,000 people had been placed into permanent housing with support by 2007. Other programs Newsom initiated to end chronic homelessness included the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team (SF HOT) and Project Homeless Connect (PHC), which placed 2,000 homeless people into permanent housing and provided 5,000 additional affordable rental units in the city.

During a strike by hotel workers against a dozen San Francisco hotels, Newsom joined UNITE HERE union members on a picket line in front of the Westin St. Francis Hotel on October 27, 2004. He vowed that the city would boycott the hotels by not sponsoring city events at them until they agreed to a contract with workers. The contract dispute was settled in September 2006.

In 2005, Newsom pushed for a state law to allow California communities to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs. In 2007, he signed the law establishing Healthy San Francisco to provide city residents with universal health care, the first city in the nation to do so.

Newsom came under attack from the San Francisco Democratic Party in 2009 for his failure to implement the City of San Francisco&#x27;s sanctuary city rule, under which the city was to not assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The same year, Newsom received the Leadership for Healthy Communities Award, along with Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City and three other public officials, for his commitment to making healthful food and physical activity options more accessible to children and families. He hosted the Urban-Rural Roundtable in 2008 to explore ways to promote regional food development and increased access to healthy, affordable food. Newsom secured $8 million in federal and local funds for the Better Streets program, which ensures that public health perspectives are fully integrated into urban planning processes. He signed a menu-labeling bill into law, requiring that chain restaurants print nutrition information on their menus.

Newsom was named &quot;America&#x27;s Most Social Mayor&quot; in 2010 by Same Point, based on analysis of the social media profiles of mayors of the 100 largest U.S. cities.

===Same-sex marriage===
Newsom gained national attention in 2004 when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, violating state law. In August 2004, the Supreme Court of California annulled the marriages Newsom had authorized, as they conflicted with state law. Still, Newsom&#x27;s unexpected move brought national attention to the issue of same-sex marriage, solidifying political support for him in San Francisco and in the LGBTQ+ community.

During the 2008 election, Newsom opposed Proposition 8, the ballot initiative to reverse the Supreme Court of California ruling that there was a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Proposition 8 supporters released a commercial featuring footage of Newsom saying the following in a speech regarding same-sex marriage: &quot;This door&#x27;s wide open now. It&#x27;s going to happen, whether you like it or not.&quot; Some observers noted that polls shifted in favor of Proposition 8 after the commercial&#x27;s release; this, in turn, led to speculation that Newsom had inadvertently played a role in the amendment&#x27;s passage.

==Lieutenant governor of California (2011–2019)==
===Elections===
====2010====


Newsom filed initial paperwork to run for lieutenant governor in February 2010, and officially announced his candidacy in March. He received the Democratic nomination in June and won the election on November 2. Newsom was sworn in as lieutenant governor on January 10, 2011, and served under Governor Jerry Brown.

While lieutenant governor, in May 2012, Newsom began hosting &quot;The Gavin Newsom Show&quot; on Current TV. The same month, he drew criticism for calling Sacramento &quot;dull&quot; and saying he was only there once a week, adding &quot;there&#x27;s no reason&quot; to be there otherwise.

====2014====

Newsom was reelected as lieutenant governor on November 4, 2014, defeating Republican Ron Nehring with 57.2% of the vote. His second term began on January 5, 2015.

===Capital punishment===
Newsom supported a failed measure in 2012 that sought to end capital punishment in California. He claimed the initiative would save California millions of dollars, citing statistics that California had spent $5 billion since 1978 to execute just 13 people.

In 2016, Newsom supported Proposition 62, which also would have repealed the death penalty in California. He argued that Prop. 62 would get rid of a system &quot;that is administered with troubling racial disparities&quot; and said that the death penalty was fundamentally immoral and did not deter crime. Proposition 62 failed.

===Criminal justice and cannabis legalization===
In 2014, Newsom was the only statewide politician to endorse California Proposition 47, legislation that recategorized certain nonviolent offenses like drug and property crimes as misdemeanors as opposed to felonies. Voters passed the measure on November 4, 2014.

In July 2015, Newsom released the Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana Policy&#x27;s final report, which he had convened with the American Civil Liberties Union of California in 2013. The report&#x27;s recommendations to regulate marijuana were intended to inform a legalization measure on the November 2016 ballot. Newsom supported the resulting measure, Proposition 64, which legalized cannabis use and cultivation for California state residents who are 21 or older.

On February 24, 2017, in response to pro-enforcement statements by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Newsom sent Attorney General Jeff Sessions and President Donald Trump a letter urging them not to increase federal enforcement against recreational cannabis firms opening in California. He wrote: &quot;The government must not strip the legal and publicly supported industry of its business and hand it back to drug cartels and criminals ... Dealers don&#x27;t card kids. I urge you and your administration to work in partnership with California and the other eight states that have legalized recreational marijuana for adult use in a way that will let us enforce our state laws that protect the public and our children while targeting the bad actors.&quot; Newsom responded to comments by Spicer that compared cannabis to opioids: &quot;Unlike marijuana, opioids represent an addictive and harmful substance, and I would welcome your administration&#x27;s focused efforts on tackling this particular public health crisis.&quot;

=== Education ===
Newsom joined Long Beach City College Superintendent Eloy Oakley in a November 2015 op-ed calling for the creation of the California College Promise, which would create partnerships between public schools, public universities, and employers and offer a free community college education. Throughout 2016, he joined Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf at the launch of the Oakland Promise and Second Lady Jill Biden and Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti at the launch of the LA Promise. In June 2016, Newsom helped secure $15 million in the state budget to support the creation of promise programs throughout the state.

In December 2015, Newsom called on the University of California to reclassify computer science courses as a core academic class to incentivize more high schools to offer computer science curricula. He sponsored successful legislation signed by Governor Brown in September 2016, that began the planning process for expanding computer science education to all state students, beginning as early as kindergarten.

In 2016, Newsom passed a series of reforms at the University of California to give student-athletes additional academic and injury-related support, and to ensure that contracts for athletic directors and coaches emphasized academic progress. This came in response to several athletics programs, including the University of California–Berkeley&#x27;s football team, which had the lowest graduation rates in the country.

=== Technology in government ===
Newsom released his first book, &quot;Citizenville: How to Take the Town Square Digital and Reinvent Government&quot;, on February 7, 2013. The book discusses the Gov 2.0 movement taking place across the nation. After its release, Newsom began to work with the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at the University of California, Berkeley, on the California Report Card (CRC). The CRC is a mobile-optimized platform that allows state residents to &quot;grade&quot; their state on six timely issues. The CRC exemplifies ideas presented in &quot;Citizenville&quot;, encouraging direct public involvement in government affairs via technology.

In 2015, Newsom partnered with the Institute for Advanced Technology and Public Policy at California Polytechnic State University to launch Digital Democracy, an online tool that uses facial and voice recognition to enable users to navigate California legislative proceedings.

==Gubernatorial campaigns (2010–2022)==


===2010 election===

On April 21, 2009, Newsom announced his candidacy for governor of California in the 2010 election. He named state senator (and future U.S. senator) Alex Padilla to chair his campaign. He received former president Bill Clinton&#x27;s endorsement in September. Throughout the campaign, he had low poll numbers, trailing Democratic frontrunner Jerry Brown by more than 20 points in most polls. Newsom dropped out of the race in October and ran for lieutenant governor instead.

===2018 election===

On February 11, 2015, Newsom announced that he was opening a campaign account for governor in the 2018 elections, allowing him to raise funds for a campaign to succeed Brown as governor of California. On June 5, 2018, he finished in the top two in the nonpartisan blanket primary, and he defeated Republican John H. Cox by a landslide in the November 6 general election.

Newsom was sworn in on January 7, 2019.
=== 2021 recall election ===
Several recall attempts were launched against Newsom early in his tenure, but they failed to gain much traction. On February 21, 2020, a recall petition was introduced by Orrin Heatlie, a deputy sheriff in Yolo County. The petition mentioned Newsom&#x27;s sanctuary state policy and said laws he endorsed favored &quot;foreign nationals, in our country illegally&quot;; said that California had high homelessness, high taxes, and low quality of life; and described other grievances. The California secretary of state approved it for circulation on June 10, 2020.

Forcing the gubernatorial recall election required a total of 1,495,709 verified signatures. By August 2020, 55,000 signatures were submitted and verified by the secretary of state, and 890 new valid signatures were submitted by October 2020. The petition was initially given a signature deadline of November 17, 2020, but it was extended to March 17, 2021, after Judge James P. Arguelles ruled that petitioners could have more time because of the pandemic. Newsom&#x27;s attendance at a party at The French Laundry in November 2020, despite his public health measures; voter anger over lockdowns, job losses, school and business closures; and a $31 billion fraud scandal at the state unemployment agency were credited for the recall&#x27;s growing support. The French Laundry event took place on November 6, and between November 5 and December 7 over 442,000 new signatures were submitted and verified; 1,664,010 verified signatures, representing roughly 98% of the final total of 1,719,900, were submitted between November 2020 and March 17, 2021.

During the campaign, Newsom compared the recall effort to the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. On September 14, 2021, the recall election was held, and only 38% voted to recall Newsom, so he remained in office.
=== 2022 election ===
In 2022, Newsom was elected to a second term, defeating Republican state senator Brian Dahle with 59.2% of the vote. This was a smaller margin of victory than in 2018, and the first time since 2010 that the Democratic gubernatorial nominee did not win at least 60% of the vote.

==Governor of California (2019–present)==
A CalMatters analysis published in 2019 found Newsom&#x27;s political positions to be more moderate than those of almost every Democratic state legislator in California.

===Appointments===
After U.S. senator Kamala Harris was elected vice president of the United States in the 2020 presidential election, Newsom appointed Secretary of State of California Alex Padilla to succeed her as California&#x27;s junior U.S. senator. To replace Padilla as secretary of state, Newsom appointed Assemblywoman Shirley Weber. After the U.S. Senate confirmed Xavier Becerra as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Newsom appointed Rob Bonta Attorney General of California. In an interview with Joy Reid, Newsom was asked whether he would appoint a Black woman to replace Dianne Feinstein if she were to retire from the Senate or die before her term ended in 2024; Newsom replied that he would. Feinstein died in September 2023, and Newsom faced pressure to quickly appoint a successor. He fulfilled his promise and appointed Laphonza Butler to the seat.

===Criminal justice===

====Capital punishment====

On March 13, 2019, three years after voters narrowly rejected its repeal, Newsom declared a moratorium on the state&#x27;s death penalty, preventing any execution in the state as long as he remained governor. The move also led to the withdrawal of the state&#x27;s current lethal injection protocol and the execution chamber&#x27;s closure at San Quentin State Prison. In a &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; interview, Newsom said that the death penalty is &quot;a racist system ... that is perpetuating inequality. It&#x27;s a system that I cannot in good conscience support.&quot; The moratorium granted a temporary reprieve for all 737 inmates on California&#x27;s death row, then the largest death row in the Western Hemisphere.

In January 2022, Newsom directed the state to begin dismantling its death row in San Quentin, to be transformed into a &quot;space for rehabilitation programs&quot;, as all the condemned inmates are moving to other prisons that have maximum security facilities. The state&#x27;s voters upheld capital punishment in 2012 and 2016, with the latter measure agreeing to move the condemned to other prisons. Though a 2021 poll by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; suggested declining support for the death penalty among California&#x27;s voters, Republican opponents criticized Newsom&#x27;s moves to halt capital punishment in California as defiance of the will of voters, and capital punishment advocates said they denied closure to murder victims&#x27; families.

====Clemency====
In response to the Trump administration&#x27;s crackdown on immigrants with criminal records, Newsom gave heightened consideration to people in this situation. A pardon can eliminate the grounds for deportation of immigrants who would otherwise be legal permanent residents. Pardon requests from people facing deportation are given expedited review by the state Board of Parole Hearings, per a 2018 California law. In his first acts of clemency as governor, Newsom pardoned seven formerly incarcerated people in May 2019, including two Cambodian refugees facing deportation. He pardoned three men who were attempting to avoid being deported to Cambodia or Vietnam in November 2019. They had separately committed crimes when they were each 19 years old. In December 2019, Newsom granted parole to a Cambodian refugee who had been held in a California prison due to a murder case. Although immigrant rights groups wanted Newsom to end policies allowing the transfer to federal agents, the refugee was turned over for possible deportation upon release.

On January 13, 2022, Newsom denied parole to Sirhan Sirhan, Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassin, who had been recommended for parole by a parole board after serving 53 years in prison. Newsom wrote an op-ed for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; saying Sirhan &quot;still lacks the insight that would prevent him from making the kind of dangerous and destructive decisions he made in the past. The most glaring proof of Sirhan&#x27;s deficient insight is his shifting narrative about his assassination of Kennedy, and his current refusal to accept responsibility for it.&quot;

====Police reform====
Newsom has spoken in favor of Assembly Bill 1196, which would ban carotid artery restraints and choke holds in California. He has claimed that there is no longer a place for a policing tactic &quot;that literally is designed to stop people&#x27;s blood from flowing into their brain, that has no place any longer in 21st-century practices.&quot;

In September 2021, Newsom signed legislation raising the minimum age to become a police officer from 18 to 21. Also in the bills were restrictions on the use of tear gas and a ban on police departments employing officers after misconduct or crimes. Among the bills was the George Floyd Bill, requiring officers to intervene when witnessing excessive force on the part of another officer.

====Transgender prisoners====
In September 2020, Newsom signed into law a bill allowing California transgender inmates to be placed in prisons that correspond with their gender identity. An inmate&#x27;s request can be denied based on &quot;management or security concerns&quot;. In response, the Women&#x27;s Liberation Front filed a lawsuit claiming that the bill is &quot;unconstitutional and creates an unsafe environment for women in female facilities&quot;.

===Disasters and emergencies===

====COVID-19 pandemic====


Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020, after the first death in California attributable to the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). His stated intention was to help California prepare for and contain COVID-19&#x27;s spread. The emergency declaration allowed state agencies to more easily procure equipment and services, share information on patients and alleviated restrictions on the use of state-owned properties and facilities. Newsom also announced that mitigation policies for the state&#x27;s estimated 108,000 unsheltered homeless people would be prioritized, with a significant push to move them indoors.

Newsom issued an executive order that allowed the state to commandeer hotels and medical facilities to treat COVID-19 patients and permitted government officials to hold teleconferences in private without violating open meeting laws. He also directed local school districts to make their own decisions on school closures, but used an executive order to ensure students&#x27; needs would be met whether or not their school was physically open. The U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the Newsom administration&#x27;s request to offer meal service during school closures, which included families being able to pick up those meals at libraries, parks, or other off-campus locations. Roughly 80% of students at California&#x27;s public schools receive free or reduced-price meals. This executive order included continued funding for remote learning opportunities and child care options during workday hours.

As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state continued to rise, on March 15, Newsom urged people 65 and older and those with chronic health conditions to isolate themselves from others. He also called on bars and brewery and winery tasting rooms to close their doors to patrons. Some local jurisdictions had mandatory closures. The closures were extended to movie theaters and health clubs. He asked restaurants to stop serving meals inside their establishments and offer take-out meals only. His statewide order to stay at home became mandatory on March 19. It allowed movement outside the home for necessities or recreation, but people were required to maintain a safe distance apart. Activity &quot;needed to maintain continuity of operation of the federal critical infrastructure sectors, critical government services, schools, childcare, and construction&quot; was excluded from the order. Essential services such as grocery stores and pharmacies remained open. Newsom provided state funds to pay for protective measures such as hotel room lodging for hospital and other essential workers fearing returning home and infecting family members. By April 26, he had issued 30 executive orders under the state of emergency while the legislature had not been in session.

On April 28, Newsom, along with the governors of Oregon and Washington, announced a &quot;shared approach&quot; for reopening their economies. His administration outlined key indicators for altering his stay-at-home mandate, including the ability to closely monitor and track potential cases, prevent infection of high-risk people, increase surge capacity at hospitals, develop therapeutics, ensure physical distancing at schools, businesses, and child-care facilities, and develop guidelines for restoring isolation orders if the virus surges. The plan to end the shutdown had four phases. Newsom emphasized that easing restrictions would be based on data, not dates, saying, &quot;We will base reopening plans on facts and data, not on ideology. Not what we want. Not what we hope.&quot; Of a return of Major League Baseball and the NFL, he said, &quot;I would move very cautiously in that expectation.&quot;

In early May, Newsom announced that certain retailers could reopen for pickup. Most Californians approved of Newsom&#x27;s handling of the crisis and were more concerned about reopening too early than too late, but there were demonstrations and protests against these policies. Under pressure, Newsom delegated more decision-making on reopening to the local level. That same month, he announced a plan for registered voters to have the option to vote by mail in the November election. California was the first state in the country to commit to sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters for the November general election.

As the state opened up, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found that new coronavirus hospitalizations in California began accelerating around June 15 at a rate not seen since early April, immediately after the virus began rapidly spreading in the state. On June 18, Newsom made face coverings mandatory for all Californians in an effort to reduce COVID-19&#x27;s spread. Enforcement would be up to business owners, as local law enforcement agencies view non-compliance as a minor infraction. By the end of June, he had ordered seven counties to close bars and nightspots, and recommended eight other counties take action on their own to close those businesses due to a surge of coronavirus cases in some parts of the state. In a regular press conference on July 13 as he was ordering the reinstatement of the shutdown of bars and indoor dining in restaurants, he said, &quot;We&#x27;re seeing an increase in the spread of the virus, so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s incumbent upon all of us to recognize soberly that COVID-19 is not going away any time soon until there is a vaccine or an effective therapy&quot;.

Newsom oversaw a sluggish initial rollout of vaccines; California had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country by January 2021, and had only used about 30% of the vaccines it had at its disposal, a far lower rate than other states, by January 20. Newsom had an approval rating of 64% in September 2020, but a February 2021 UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll found that his approval rate was down to 46%, with 48% disapproval, the highest of his tenure. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; attributed this decline to public opinion of his management of the pandemic. The vaccination rate began increasing in January, with over half the population fully vaccinated as of September 2021, the percentage ranking #16 out of the 50 states.

Although the Newsom administration enacted some of the country&#x27;s most stringent pandemic restrictions in 2020, California had the 29th-highest death rate of all 50 states by May 2021. Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at UCSF, said that California&#x27;s restrictive approach &quot;did not lead to better health outcomes&quot;, and criticized California&#x27;s delay in implementing new CDC recommendations absolving the fully vaccinated from most indoor mask requirements, while saying the decision lacked scientific rationale and could cause &quot;collateral damage&quot;.

====Pandemic unemployment fraud and debt====

In January 2021, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Newsom&#x27;s administration had mismanaged $11.4 billion by disbursing unemployment benefits to ineligible claimants, especially those paid through the federally funded Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. Another $19 billion in claims remained under investigation for fraud. At the same time, legitimate claimants faced lengthy delays in receiving benefits. The state&#x27;s unemployment system had been overseen by California Labor Secretary Julie Su, a Newsom appointee, whom President Joe Biden later appointed as deputy secretary of labor in February 2021.

Political opponents attributed the crisis to the Newsom administration&#x27;s failure to heed multiple warnings by federal officials of the potential for fraud, while Newsom&#x27;s administration said the Trump administration&#x27;s failure to provide appropriate guidance for the new federally funded program contributed to the fraud. Experts said much of the fraud appeared to originate from international criminal gangs in 20 countries. A report by California State Auditor Elaine Howle said $810 million was disbursed to claimants who had fraudulently filed on behalf of inmates in the state&#x27;s prison system.

According to &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot;, by the summer of 2021, California owed $23 billion to the federal government for unemployment benefits paid out during the pandemic, which was 43% of all unemployment debt, owed by 13 states at the time, to the federal government. Most of this debt was unrelated to the federally funded pandemic unemployment programs that had experienced most of the fraud, and instead was due to longstanding underfunding and California&#x27;s high rate of unemployment during the pandemic.

====Wildfires====
Due to a mass die-off of trees throughout California that could increase the risk of wildfires, Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 22, 2020, in preparation for the 2020 wildfire season. After declaring a state of emergency on August 18, he reported that the state was battling 367 known fires, many sparked by intense thunderstorms on August 16–17. His request for assistance via issuance of a federal disaster declaration in the wake of six major wildfires was first rejected by the Trump administration, but accepted after Trump spoke to Newsom.

On June 23, 2021, the NPR station CapRadio reported that Newsom and Cal Fire had falsely claimed in January 2020 that of land at risk for wildfires had been treated with fuel breaks and prescribed burns; the actual treated area was , an overstatement of 690%. According to CapRadio, the fuel breaks of the 35 &quot;priority projects&quot; Newsom had touted, which were meant to ensure the quick evacuation of residents while preventing traffic jams and a repeat of events in the 2018 fire that destroyed the town of Paradise, where at least eight evacuees burned to death in their vehicles, were struggling to mitigate fire spread in almost every instance while failing to prevent evacuation traffic jams. The same day CapRadio revealed the oversight, leaked emails showed that Newsom&#x27;s handpicked Cal Fire chief had ordered the removal of the original statement. In another report in April 2022, CapRadio found a program, hailed in 2020 by the Newsom administration to fast-track environmental reviews on high-priority fire prevention projects, had failed to make progress.

KXTV released a series of reports chronicling PG&amp;E&#x27;s liabilities after committing 91 felonies in the Santa Rosa and Paradise fires. Newsom was accused of accepting campaign donations from PG&amp;E in order to change the CPUC&#x27;s ruling on PG&amp;E&#x27;s safety license. The rating change allowed PG&amp;E to avoid billions of dollars in extra fees. Newsom was also accused of setting up the Wildfire Insurance Fund via AB 1054, using ratepayer fees, so PG&amp;E could avoid financial losses and pass the liability costs to ratepayers and taxpayers.

===Energy and environment===


Upon taking office in 2019, Newsom succeeded Brown as co-chair of the United States Climate Alliance. In September 2019, Newsom vetoed SB 1, which would have preserved environmental protections at the state level that were set to roll back nationally under the Trump administration&#x27;s environmental policy. In February 2020, the Newsom administration sued federal agencies over the rollbacks to protect imperiled fish in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta in 2019.

Newsom attended the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, where he spoke of California as a climate leader due to the actions of governors before him. In August 2020, he addressed the 2020 Democratic National Convention. His speech mentioned climate change and the wildfires prevalent in California at the time. On September 23, 2020, Newsom signed an executive order to phase out sales of gasoline-powered vehicles and require all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035. Bills he signed in September with an environmental focus included a commission to study lithium extraction around the Salton Sea.

During his 2018 campaign, Newsom pledged to tighten state oversight of fracking and oil extraction. Early in his governorship, his administration approved new oil and gas leases on public lands at about twice the rate of the prior year. When asked about this development, Newsom said he was unaware of the rate of approvals, and he later fired the head of the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources. In November 2019, he imposed a moratorium on approval of new hydraulic fracturing and steam-injected oil drilling in the state until the permits for those projects could be reviewed by an independent panel of scientists. State agencies resumed issuing new hydraulic fracturing permits in April 2020. In 2021, the Center for Biological Diversity sued the Newsom administration over the continued sale of oil and gas leases, and Consumer Watchdog called for the end of their sale. In April 2021, Newsom committed to ending the sale of gas leases by 2024 and ending oil extraction by 2045. In October 2021, he proposed a buffer between new fossil fuel extraction sites and densely populated areas.

In 2022, gas prices in California exceeded $6 per gallon. Newsom attributed this to corporate greed and price gouging by oil companies. He proposed a windfall profits tax and penalty for oil companies in September 2022. On March 28, 2023, Newsom signed a law that authorizes the California Energy Commission to set &quot;a profit threshold above which companies would be assessed a financial penalty&quot;, requires petroleum companies to report additional profit data to state regulators, and creates a new oversight division of the California Energy Commission to investigate price gouging in the gasoline industry.

=== Ethics concerns ===

==== Donations to spouse&#x27;s nonprofit organization ====
&quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; reported that Jennifer Siebel Newsom&#x27;s nonprofit organization The Representation Project had received more than $800,000 in donations from corporations that had lobbied the state government in recent years, including PG&amp;E, AT&amp;T, Comcast, and Kaiser Permanente. Siebel Newsom received $2.3 million in salary from the nonprofit since launching it in 2011. In 2021, Governor Newsom said that he saw no conflict in his wife&#x27;s nonprofit accepting donations from companies that lobby his administration.

==== Donations to campaign ====
In February 2024, Bloomberg News reported that Newsom pushed for an exemption for businesses that bake and sell bread in AB 1228, a bill that raises the state&#x27;s minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 per hour. The exemption includes 24 Panera Bread bakery-cafes owned by Greg Flynn, a businessman who donated $100,000 and $64,800 to Newsom&#x27;s campaigns over the years. Republican lawmakers called for an investigation into the unusual exemption. When reporters asked him about the exemption, Newsom said: &quot;That&#x27;s a part of the sausage making. We went back and forth, and that was part of the negotiation. That&#x27;s the nature of negotiation… That was all part of the give and take and that was the collective wisdom of the legislature and ultimately led to my signature.&quot;

In September 2024, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Newsom had signed AB 3206 into law, carving out an exception to the state&#x27;s last call alcohol law for one specific venue, Intuit Dome, owned by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Ballmer&#x27;s wife, Connie Ballmer, donated $1 million to the Newsom campaign in 2021. Ethics experts criticized the bill for exclusively benefiting a major donor to Newsom. &quot;It&#x27;s certainly going to become an issue for his opponents and critics to point to the fact that he seemed to provide a special favor to a wealthy sports franchise owner and its facility and its wealthy fans. It just doesn&#x27;t look good&quot;, said John Pelissero, director of government ethics at Santa Clara University. A spokesperson for Newsom said, &quot;The governor&#x27;s decisions on legislation are made solely on the merits of each bill.&quot;

=== Executive authority and actions ===
Overall, Newsom has vetoed legislation at a rate comparable to that of his predecessors. From 2019 to 2021, he vetoed 12.7% of the bills the legislature passed on average. The rate declined over the course of the three legislative sessions. Newsom&#x27;s vetoes have included bills to allow ranked-choice voting, require an ethnic studies class as a high school graduation requirement, and reduce penalties for jaywalking.

Newsom used a larger than normal number of executive orders during the 2020 legislative session.

=== Gun control ===

As lieutenant governor in 2016, Newsom was the official proponent of Proposition 63. The ballot measure required a background check and California Department of Justice authorization to purchase ammunition, among other gun control regulations. In response to the 2019 mass shooting in Virginia Beach, Newsom called for nationwide background checks on people purchasing ammunition. Later that year, he responded to the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting by stating his support for the Second Amendment and saying he would like national cooperation controlling &quot;weapons of goddamned mass destruction&quot;. He also said, &quot;These shootings overwhelmingly, almost exclusively, are males, boys, &#x27;men&#x27;—I put in loose quotes. I do think that is missing in the national conversation.&quot;

On June 10, 2021, Newsom called federal Judge Roger Benitez &quot;a stone cold ideologue&quot; and &quot;a wholly owned subsidiary of the gun lobby of the National Rifle Association&quot; after Benitez struck down California&#x27;s statewide ban on assault weapons. While the ban remained in place as the state appealed the ruling, Newsom proposed legislation that would empower private citizens to enforce the ban after the United States Supreme Court declined to strike down the Texas Heartbeat Act, which empowers private citizens to report unauthorized abortions.

In 2022, Newsom signed gun control bills passed by the California Legislature. On July 1, he signed Assembly Bill 1621, which restricts privately made firearms, which were found to be linked to over 100 violent crimes in Los Angeles, and Assembly Bill 2571, which prohibited the marketing of firearms such as the JR-15 to children. On July 22, Newsom signed Senate Bill 1327, a law enabling private citizens to sue anyone who imports, distributes, manufactures or sells illegal firearms in California. The law requires courts to award statutory damages of at least $10,000 and attorney&#x27;s fees.

On June 8, 2023, Newsom proposed a 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution to raise the age to buy firearms to 21, institute universal background checks for gun purchases, mandate waiting periods and ban assault weapons for civilians. Law professor Erwin Chemerinsky called this a &quot;terrible idea&quot;, since the advocated method (which has never been used) would be a constitutional convention (which is not understood to be limited to single amendments), potentially allowing a complete rewrite of the Constitution, or addition of other amendments on separate subjects, like abortion, or the often proposed balanced budget amendment (which liberals feel would decimate welfare programs).

===Abortion===

In December 2021, Newsom announced his intention to make California a &quot;sanctuary&quot; for abortion, which included possibly paying for procedures, travel, and lodging for out-of-state abortion seekers, if the procedure is banned in Republican-led states. In March 2022, he signed a bill requiring private health insurance plans in the state to fully cover abortion procedures by eliminating associated co-pays and deductibles and increasing insurance premiums. In February 2023, Newsom organized the Reproductive Freedom Alliance of state governors supportive of abortion and reproductive rights.

After Walgreens announced in March 2023 that it would refuse to dispense abortion pills in the 21 states where it is illegal, Newsom tweeted, &quot;California won&#x27;t be doing business with @walgreens – or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women&#x27;s lives at risk, we&#x27;re done.&quot; He also said that Walgreens was giving in to &quot;right-wing bullies&quot; and that he would determine how California can cut ties with Walgreens. He indicated that he wanted to cancel Walgreens&#x27; $54 million contract with the California state prison system. Walgreens also receives $1.5 billion for filling prescriptions for the 15 million people enrolled in the state&#x27;s Medi-Cal program (California&#x27;s version of Medicaid). Legal experts said that federal Medicaid laws do not allow health plans to disqualify providers for reasons other than fraud or contract violations, provisions that have prevented conservative states from blocking Medicaid spending to Planned Parenthood clinics.

===Health care===

Newsom campaigned on reducing the cost of health care and increasing access. He also indicated his support for creating a universal state health-care system. The budget passed in June 2019 expanded eligibility for Medi-Cal from solely undocumented minor children to undocumented young adults from ages 19 to 25. In 2021, Newsom signed legislation expanding Medi-Cal eligibility to undocumented residents over age 50. On June 30, 2022, he signed a $307.9 billion state budget that &quot;pledges to make all low-income adults eligible for the state&#x27;s Medicaid program by 2024 regardless of their immigration status.&quot; This budget would make California the first U.S. state to guarantee healthcare to all low-income illegal immigrants, at a cost of $2.7 billion per year.

Newsom was criticized in early 2022 for walking back from his support for universal health care and not supporting Assembly Bill 1400, which would have instituted single-payer health care in California; critics suggested that opposition from business interests, which had donated large sums to Newsom and his party, had swayed his opinion.

On July 6, 2022, Newsom signed Senate Bill 184, which established the Office of Health Care Affordability, with the stated goal to &quot;develop data-informed policies and enforceable cost targets, with the ultimate goal of containing health care costs.&quot;

In October 2023, Newsom vetoed a bill to cap co-pays for diabetic insulin at $35.

===Infrastructure and development===
====High-speed rail====

In his February 2019 State of the State address, Newsom announced that, while work would continue on the Central Valley segment from Bakersfield to Merced, the rest of the system would be indefinitely postponed, citing cost overruns and delays. This and other actions created tension with the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, a labor union representing 450,000 members.

==== Homelessness and housing shortage ====

A poll found that California voters thought the most important issue for Newsom and the state legislature to work on in 2020 was homelessness. In his first week of office, Newsom threatened to withhold state funding for infrastructure to communities that failed to take actions to alleviate California&#x27;s housing shortage. In late January 2019, he announced that he would sue Huntington Beach for preventing the construction of affordable housing. A year later, the city acted to settle the lawsuit by the state. Newsom opposes NIMBY (not-in-my-back-yard) sentiment, declaring in 2022 that &quot;NIMBYism is destroying the state&quot;. In 2021, he signed a pair of bills into law that made zoning regulations for housing less restrictive, allowing construction of duplexes and fourplexes in lots that were previously zoned exclusively for single-family homes. Newsom also signed a bill which expedites the environmental review process for new multifamily developments worth at least $15,000,000. To participate, developers must apply directly through the governor&#x27;s office.

In 2022, Newsom signed 39 bills into law intended to address California&#x27;s housing crisis, three of which entailed major land use reform. One bill eliminated minimum parking requirements for housing near mass transit stations throughout the state. Michael Manville, an urban planning professor at UCLA&#x27;s Luskin School of Public Affairs, called it &quot;one of the biggest land-use reforms in the country.&quot; Another bill allowed developers to build housing on some lots previously exclusively zoned for commercial use without getting local governments&#x27; permission if a certain percentage of the housing was affordable. A third bill allowed for the construction of market-rate housing on some lots previously exclusively zoned for commercial use. In a signing ceremony for the latter two bills, Newsom warned local governments, which have a history of blocking and delaying housing developments, that they would be held accountable for future housing obstructionism. Other bills Newsom signed required localities &quot;to approve or deny various building permits within a strict timeline&quot; and streamlined student and faculty housing projects by allowing California colleges to skip onerous review processes for new projects. Measures and actions to reduce homelessness in California have not yet solved the problem. The number of homeless hit a record number of over 181,000 in January 2023. According to some, to cope with this problem, California must build more than 2.5 million housing units.

In October 2023, Newsom vetoed several bills aimed at expanding access to housing assistance. One was a bill to repurpose unused state-owned land for affordable housing, which Newsom said infringed on state sovereignty. Another would have expanded the number of people who qualify for state housing assistance. A third would have mandated that Medi-Cal cover the cost of housing assistance.

In August 2024, Newsom warned counties that did not remove their homeless encampments that failure to do so would result in their state funding being cut off the next year. He issued this warning after personally visiting and clearing out a Los Angeles homeless encampment without notifying the city beforehand.

====Water management====

Newsom supports a series of tentative water-sharing agreements that would bring an end to the dispute between farmers, cities, fishers, and environmentalists over how much water should be left in the state&#x27;s two most important rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin, which flow into the Delta.

===Native American relations===

In a speech before representatives of Native Americans in June 2019, Newsom apologized for the genocide of Native Americans approved and abetted by the California state government upon statehood in the 19th century. By one estimate, at least 4,500 Native Californians were killed between 1849 and 1870. Newsom said, &quot;That&#x27;s what it was, a genocide. No other way to describe it. And that&#x27;s the way it needs to be described in the history books.&quot; In October 2024, Newsom signed AB 3074, the &quot;California Racial Mascots Act&quot;, which bans derogatory Native American mascots and team names at K-12 schools. Schools run by recognized Native American tribes are exempt.

===LGBTQ+ rights===

In September 2022, Newsom made California the first sanctuary state for transgender youth, proclaimed June 2023 LGBTQ+ Pride Month in California, and issued a fine of $1.5 million to a school district whose board rejected a curriculum including a biography of Harvey Milk, a Californian gay rights leader. But he also vetoed several bills, passed by the Assembly by a wide margin, one of which would have instructed judges who preside over custody battles to take a parent&#x27;s affirmation of a child&#x27;s gender identity into account, and another of which would have mandated that insurance plans serving California residents cover the cost of gender-affirming care. In 2024, Newsom signed a bill into law that prohibits schools from notifying parents about a minor student&#x27;s gender identity without the student&#x27;s consent. The law was criticized by parents, conservative organizations, and Republican legislators, who argued that it undermines locally elected school officials&#x27; authority and restricts parents&#x27; rights by limiting their access to information about their children&#x27;s education and well-being.

===Caste discrimination===

In October 2023, Newsom vetoed a bill to ban discrimination based on caste, calling it &quot;unnecessary&quot;. Many Hindu rights organizations applauded the veto, saying the bill &quot;would have put a target on hundreds of thousands of Californians simply because of their ethnicity or their religious identity&quot;. Advocates for the rights of Dalits and other violently oppressed castes sharply criticized the veto.

===Labor rights===

In October 2023, Newsom vetoed a bill to provide unemployment insurance to striking workers, citing excess burden on the state&#x27;s unemployment system. He also vetoed a bill to expand the mandatory warning given to soon to be laid off employees from 60 days to 75, extend the same protections to long-term contract workers, and prohibit employers from making laid-off employees sign nondisclosure agreements in order to receive severance.

===International travel===

Newsom&#x27;s first international trip as governor was to El Salvador. With nearly 680,000 Salvadoran immigrants living in California, he said that the &quot;state&#x27;s relationship with Central America is key to California&#x27;s future&quot;. He was also concerned about the tens of thousands of Salvadorans who were fleeing the smallest country in Central America for the U.S. each year. As governor of a state impacted by the debate of illegal immigration, he went to see the factors driving it firsthand, and to build business and tourism partnerships between California and Central America. He said he wanted to &quot;ignite a more enlightened engagement and dialogue&quot;.

On October 20, 2023, Newsom visited Israel to express solidarity with the country during the Israel–Hamas war. He met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli president Isaac Herzog, other top Israeli officials, and survivors of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel.

In October 2023, Newsom embarked on a week-long visit to China. It began in Hong Kong, where he attended a discussion at the University of Hong Kong about climate change. He then traveled to Beijing, where he met with Chinese president Xi Jinping, discussing issues including climate change, trade relations, and the response to fentanyl production. The visit also included stops in Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shanghai. He called for better relations between the U.S. and China during the trip, saying that &quot;divorce is not an option&quot; for the two countries.

=== National profile and political future===

Many journalists and political analysts have mentioned Newsom as a presidential hopeful. According to a June 2023 poll by NewsNation, 22% of California voters wanted Newsom to enter the 2024 presidential election. In May 2023, Schwarzenegger said it was a &quot;no-brainer&quot; that Newsom would someday run for president. An April 2023 article published in &quot;The Hill&quot; by journalist Sharon Udasin also discussed the inevitability of a Newsom presidential run. In September 2022, Newsom said that he would not run for president in 2024, citing his &quot;vulnerable&quot; 2021 recall. After his 2022 reelection, he informed White House staff that he would not challenge President Biden in the Democratic primaries; he endorsed Biden&#x27;s reelection campaign on April 25, 2023.

Newsom has become an outspoken critic of the policies of Florida governor Ron DeSantis, denouncing DeSantis&#x27;s orchestration of the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard migrant airlift. DeSantis responded by saying California has &quot;huge problems&quot; and dared Newsom to run against Biden. In November 2023, the two debated, with Fox News&#x27;s Sean Hannity as moderator.

In July 2024, Newsom launched a podcast, &quot;Politickin&quot;&#x27;, co-hosted by Marshawn Lynch and Doug Hendrickson. After Biden&#x27;s sudden withdrawal from the presidential race that month, Newsom said he would not seek the Democratic nomination, and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president.

After Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, Newsom called for California lawmakers to convene later in 2024 to safeguard California&#x27;s policies from the upcoming Trump administration.

In December 2024, Newsom criticized Biden for pardoning his son Hunter Biden. He said, &quot;I’m disappointed and can’t support the decision.&quot;

==Personal life==

Newsom was baptized and raised in his father&#x27;s Catholic faith. In 2008, he described himself as an &quot;Irish Catholic rebel...in some respects, but one that still has tremendous admiration for the Church and very strong faith&quot;; when asked about the state of the Catholic Church, Newsom said it was in crisis. He said he stays with the Church because of his &quot;strong connection to a greater purpose, and to sort of a higher being&quot;. Newsom identifies as a practicing Catholic, saying in 2008 that he has a &quot;strong sense of faith that is perennial, day in and day out&quot;.

In December 2001, Newsom married legal commentator Kimberly Guilfoyle at Saint Ignatius Catholic Church. They separated in 2004 and jointly filed for divorce in January 2005, citing &quot;difficulties due to their careers on opposite coasts&quot;. Their divorce was finalized on February 28, 2006, by which time Guilfoyle was expecting a child with Eric Villency. Guilfoyle gained prominence in 2011 via a Fox News chat show. She was later named senior advisor to Republican president Donald Trump, whom Newsom has extensively criticized, and was later engaged to Donald Trump Jr.

In September 2006, Newsom, then 38, briefly dated 19-year-old Brittanie Mountz, a model and restaurant hostess. On January 31, 2007, Newsom&#x27;s close friend, campaign manager, and former chief of staff Alex Tourk confronted him after learning from his wife, Ruby Rippey-Tourk, that she and Newsom had an affair in 2005, when she was Newsom&#x27;s appointments secretary. Tourk immediately resigned. Newsom admitted to the affair the next day and apologized to the public, saying he was &quot;deeply sorry&quot; for his &quot;personal lapse of judgment&quot;. In 2018, Rippey-Tourk said that she thought it wrong to associate Newsom&#x27;s behavior with the #MeToo movement: &quot;I was a subordinate, but I was also a free-thinking, 33-yr old adult married woman and mother. I do want to make sure that the #metoo movement is reserved for cases and situations that deserve it.&quot;

Newsom began dating film director Jennifer Siebel in October 2006. He announced he would seek treatment for alcohol use disorder in February 2007. The couple announced their engagement in December 2007, and they were married in Stevensville, Montana, in July 2008. They have four children.

After he completed service as mayor of San Francisco in 2011, Newsom and his family moved to a house they bought in Kentfield in Marin County in 2012. After his election as governor, Newsom and his family moved into the California Governor&#x27;s Mansion in Downtown Sacramento and thereafter settled in Fair Oaks. In May 2019, &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; reported that Newsom&#x27;s $3.7 million purchase of a 12,000-square-foot home in Fair Oaks was the most expensive private residence sold in the Sacramento region since the year began.

In August 2021, Newsom sold a Marin County home for $5.9 million in an off-market transaction. He had originally put the property up for sale in early 2019 for $5.895 million, but removed the property from the market after a price reduction to $5.695 million.

Newsom is the godfather of designer, model, and LGBTQ rights activist Nats Getty.

== Other political activism ==
In 2023, Newsom launched Campaign for Democracy, a PAC to take on &quot;authoritarian leaders&quot; in the U.S. It is thought to be a starting point for a possible 2028 presidential bid.

As of July 2024, Campaign for Democracy has raised $24 million for direct contributions to candidates and other spending. The group is not subject to contribution limits, but it can coordinate with Newsom as long as he is not a candidate for federal office.

<text>The northern waterthrush (Parkesia noveboracensis) is a species of ground-feeding migratory New World warbler of the genus Parkesia. It breeds in the northern part of North America in Canada and the northern United States including Alaska, and winters in Central America, the West Indies and Florida, as well as in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. It is a rare vagrant to other South American countries and to western Europe. Its closest relative is the Louisiana waterthrush.

==Taxonomy==
The northern waterthrush was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the wagtails in the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla noveboracensis&quot;. Gmelin based his account on descriptions of the species by earlier authors, none of whom had coined a binomial name. In 1778 the French polymath the Comte de Buffon had described &quot;La fauvette tacheté de la Louisiane&quot; in his book &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot;. A hand-coloured engraving by François-Nicolas Martinet was published seperately to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. The species was later described under the name &quot;New York warbler&quot; by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1783 and by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant in 1785. The northern waterthrush is now placed together with the Louisiana waterthrush in the genus &quot;Parkesia&quot; that was introduced in 2008 by George Sangster. The genus name was chosen to honour the American ornithologist Kenneth Carroll Parkes. The specific epithet &quot;noveboracensis&quot; is for New York, United States. It combines &quot;novus&quot; meaning &quot;new&quot; with &quot;Eboracum&quot;, the Latin name for York, England). Latham had mentioned that the species was &quot;met with in the hedges about New York&quot;. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The northern waterthrush is a large New World warbler (and not a thrush, despite the name). It has a length of , wingspan of and weighs between Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . On the head, the crown is brown with a white supercilium. The bill is pointed and dark. The throat is lightly streaked brown to black with heavier streaking continuing onto the breast and flanks. The back is evenly brown. Sexes are morphologically similar. Young birds have buff, rather than white underparts. The song of loud, emphatic, clear chirping notes generally falling in pitch and accelerating; loosely paired or tripled, with little variation. Call a loud, hard &quot;spwik&quot; rising with a strong &quot;K&quot; sound. The flight call is a buzzy, high, slightly rising &quot;zzip&quot;.

The species may be visually confused for the closely related Louisiana waterthrush (&quot;Parkesia motacilla&quot;), which has buff flanks, a buff undertail, and bright pink legs. The Louisiana waterthrush also has a whiter throat with fewer streaks. More subtle clues include smaller size and smaller bill, a narrower and darker eye-line, and different call note and habits.

Both waterthrush species walk rather than hop, and seem to teeter, since they bob their rear ends as they move along.

==Distribution and habitat==
Northern waterthrush territories are distributed across both upland and riparian habitats, but have limited occupation of harvested areas. Crowding into riparian buffer zones adjacent to harvested areas have more difficulty foraging compared to those in untouched areas.

On the wintering grounds in Puerto Rico, northern waterthrushes leave daytime foraging areas and fly up to to nighttime roosts. The roosts are often located in red mangrove habitats. Northern waterthrushes winter in 4 main habitats in Puerto Rico: white mangrove, red mangrove, black mangrove, and scrub. Males, which are larger and migrate earlier in spring, prefer to winter in white mangrove, and are able to maintain or gain weight through the winter. Females winter in the other drier and less food-rich habitats. During the non-breeding period, northern waterthrushes are site-faithful and tend to be solitary.

=== Vagrancy ===
The first northern waterthrush recorded in Europe was a female trapped in Ushant, France on 17 September 1955. The species was first recorded in the United Kingdom on 30 September 1958, on St. Agnes, Isles of Scilly. It was caught in a mist-net, photographed, and released, after which it stayed until 12 October. There have been eight recorded sightings in the UK between 1958 and 2024. An exceptional record comes from Antofagasta, Chile.

==Behavior==
Waterthrushes wintering in red and black mangrove can maintain body weight through the winter but lose weight in scrub. Another determinant in body mass increase in the wintering grounds is moisture. 

===Breeding===
The breeding habitat of the northern waterthrush is wet woodlands near water, especially rivers and streams. It will occasionally nest in upland areas in the roots of fallen trees. Northern waterthrushes build a cup nest constructed of leaves, bark strips, and rootlets in cavities or among tree roots. It lays three to six eggs, cream- or buff-colored, with brown and gray spots.

===Food and feeding===
The northern waterthrush is a terrestrial ground feeder, eating insects, spiders, mollusks (such as snails), worms, and crustaceans found amongst leaf litter, as well as minnows, found by wading through water.

<doc id="418950" wikidata="Q350619" url="?curid=418950" title="Adam Petty">
<text>Adam Kyler Petty (July 10, 1980 – May 12, 2000) was an American professional stock car racing driver. A member of the Petty racing family, he was the fourth generation from the Petty family to drive in races in the highest division of NASCAR racing, mostly in what was then known as the NASCAR Busch Series. He was believed to be the first fourth-generation athlete in all of modern American professional sports.

==Early life==
Petty was raised in High Point, North Carolina, into stock car racing &quot;royalty.&quot; The son of Kyle Petty, he was widely expected to become the next great Petty, following in the footsteps of his father, grandfather Richard, and great grandfather Lee.

==Racing career==
Petty began his career in 1998, shortly after he turned 18, in the ARCA RE/MAX Series. Like his father Kyle, he won his first ARCA race, driving the #45 Pontiac at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway. Petty moved to NASCAR Busch Series full-time in 1999, driving the No. 45 Chevrolet. Petty finished sixth in his first Busch Series race at Daytona and had a best finish of fourth place at Fontana, though he also failed to qualify for three of the Busch races. Petty finished the 1999 season 20th overall in points.

Petty Enterprises planned to have Petty run a second Busch season in 2000, while giving him seven starts in the 2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series, in preparation for a full Winston Cup campaign in 2001. He struggled early in the Busch season, but managed to qualify in his first attempt at Winston Cup during the DirecTV 500 at Texas Motor Speedway on April 2. He qualified 33rd and ran in the middle of the pack most of the day before his engine expired, forcing him to finish 40th. Adam never got to race alongside his father. Kyle failed to qualify and eventually relieved an ill Elliott Sadler, but Adam was already out of the race. Lee Petty, Adam&#x27;s great-grandfather, and 3-time NASCAR Champion, lived to see his Winston Cup debut, but died just three days later.

==Death==
On May 12, 2000, in a practice session for the Busch 200 race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, which would have been his 48th career Busch Series start, Petty&#x27;s throttle had stuck wide open going into the third turn of the track, causing the car to hit the outside wall virtually head on, killing Adam instantly as he developed a basilar skull fracture. He was 19 years old.

Petty&#x27;s death, along with 1998 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year Kenny Irwin Jr.&#x27;s in the same corner at the same track eight weeks later, led NASCAR to mandate the use of a kill switch on the steering wheel and the adoption of the Whelen Modified Tour restrictor plate for the September Cup race; which was abandoned following the race, in where Jeff Burton led all the laps to win. Both adjustments addressed the cause of the deadly accidents, with the exception of course of the basilar skull fractures suffered by both drivers. At Texas Motor Speedway, Truck Series driver Tony Roper died on October 14, 2000, of a similar skull fracture. Use of the HANS or Hutchens device (designed to prevent the rapid-deceleration head-and-neck movements associated with the injuries and skull fractures associated with the Petty, Irwin, Jr., and Roper deaths) was mandated by NASCAR in October 2001, following the later deaths of seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt on the last lap of the Daytona 500 on February 18, 2001 and ARCA RE/MAX Series competitor Blaise Alexander during ARCA EasyCare 100 at Charlotte Motor Speedway on October 4, 2001, both of whom died from the same fatal skull injuries. NASCAR also adopted the SAFER barriers in 2002; drivers had requested installation of soft walls prior to the September New Hampshire Cup race.

Adam&#x27;s father Kyle Petty, who had driven the No. 44 Hot Wheels-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix Winston Cup car at the time of his son&#x27;s fatal crash at New Hampshire, chose to take over Adam&#x27;s No. 45 car in the Busch Series for the remainder of 2000, with Steve Grissom taking the wheel of the blue No. 44 Pontiac. He then used the No. 45 in the Cup Series throughout the rest of his driving career during most of the 2000s decade. Kyle Petty later admitted he struggled with a personal depression during the 2001 Cup Series season about the loss of his son, which partly resulted in his poor finish in the 2001 Cup standings, but inspiring him to keep on driving the 45 car paying his tributes to Adam.

==Legacy==

In October 2000, five months after Petty&#x27;s death, his family partnered with Paul Newman and the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp to begin the Victory Junction Gang Camp in Randleman, North Carolina, as a memorial to Petty. The camp has received support from many NASCAR drivers, teams, and sponsors, including Cup Series sponsor Sprint, which has placed a replica of Petty&#x27;s 1998 car in the camp. The camp began operation in 2004 and is an official charity of NASCAR.

Petty also appears as a special guest driver in the video games &quot;NASCAR 2000&quot;, &quot;NASCAR Rumble&quot;, &quot;NASCAR 2001&quot; and &quot;NASCAR Arcade&quot;. Both &quot;NASCAR 2001&quot; and &quot;NASCAR Heat&quot; include tributes to both him and Irwin Jr.

In December 2013, Adam&#x27;s brother Austin named his newborn son after Adam in tribute.

The car number 45, which was driven by Petty, is currently used by 23XI Racing to represent the jersey number worn by co-owner Michael Jordan. Kurt Busch drove the 45 car to victory at Kansas Speedway in 2022, and dedicated his win to Petty. Bubba Wallace and Tyler Reddick have also won races while driving the 45 car.

<doc id="418951" wikidata="Q1902612" url="?curid=418951" title="Stone, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Stone is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Stone with Bishopstone and Hartwell, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located southwest of the town of Aylesbury, on the A418 road that links Aylesbury to Thame. Stone with Bishopstone and Hartwell is a civil parish within Buckinghamshire district and also incorporates the nearby settlements of Bishopstone and Hartwell.

The architect Clough Williams-Ellis designed the village hall in 1910. The original dedication stone with his name on is on the south eastern corner of the building.

==Description==
The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and refers literally to boundary stone or marker stone. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Stanes&quot;.

The village of Stone adjoins the village of Hartwell.

The parish church (www.stonedintonhartwell.com) is dedicated to St John the Baptist, and is dated 1273. The graveyard contains the grave of Admiral Smyth.

===1806 description===
In 1806, &quot;Magna Britannia&quot; described Stone as

:STONE, in the hundred of Aylesbury and deanery of Wendover, lies nearly three miles west of Aylesbury, on the road to Thame. The manor was anciently in the family of Braci, afterwards in that of Whittingham. It has been since held for many years by the Lees with the adjoining manor of Hartwell, and is now the property of the Rev. Sir George Lee bart.

:The parish church which was consecrated in 1273, retains some vestiges of the architecture of that period. The rectory was given by the Braci family to the priory of Oseney. By the act of parliament which passed for inclosing this parish in 1776, it appears that the Lees were entitled to the great tithes of Southwarp in Stone, and the earl of Chesterfield to those of the remainder of the parish. Allotments of land were then assigned to the impropriators and to the vicar, who was entitled to the tithes of hay. Sir George Lee is patron and incumbent of the vicarage.

===Astronomical observatory===
In 1839, John Lee and the Royal Astronomical Society jointly owned the advowson of the parish. They appointed amateur scientist and Fellow of the Royal Society, the Rev. Joseph Bancroft Reade as vicar. Reade served as incumbent until 1859, establishing a school and an astronomical observatory, and performing pioneering work in the early development of photography.

===Village school===
Stone Church of England Combined School is voluntary controlled, mixed primary school with approximately 180 pupils aged between four and eleven. The school&#x27;s catchment area includes the nearby villages of Bishopstone and Hartwell, and children transfer to the school from Dinton Church of England School, at the age of seven. The school dates from 1871, but most of the present buildings date from 1973 when a major programme of building work provided a hall, new classrooms, a library, changing rooms, offices and an extended playground. The current headteacher is Debbie Morrison. In 2006 the school was judged to be &quot;satisfactory&quot; and a 2007 Monitoring Report identified &quot;good progress&quot; in improving the curriculum and teaching. In 2019 the school achieved a ‘Good’ rating from Ofsted. In 2018 the school&#x27;s Key Stage 2 results exceeded the England average.

===St. John&#x27;s Hospital===
In the early 19th century an asylum (later known as St. John&#x27;s Hospital) was opened in Stone for people with disabilities or mental illnesses. It was closed in 1991, and the vast expanse of land has since been given over to a new housing estate. All that remains are the staff houses and the grade-II asylum chapel.

===World War II prisoner of war camp===
During World War II, a Prisoner of War camp was located in Sedrup, a hamlet near Stone (Camp No. 36 &quot;Hartwell Dog Track&quot;).

The camp was known to house Italian prisoners from 1942 to 1946 and consisted mostly of tents with one hut. A 1946 RAF aerial photo of the site shows camp buildings at Grid reference SP797121 , on what is now the Meadoway housing estate adjacent to Sedrup Lane. Remains of the camp were still evident on the site in the 1950s.

== Civil parish ==
On 1 April 1986 the parish was abolished and merged with Hartwell to form &quot;Stone with Bishopstone &amp; Hartwell&quot;. In 1961 the parish had a population of 2106.

<text>Paul Duffie (born June 14, 1951) is a former Canadian politician, lawyer, and judge in the province of New Brunswick. Duffie was born in Neguac, New Brunswick. A graduate of Ricker College in Houlton, Maine with a Bachelor of Science degree and the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton, New Brunswick with a law degree. He was mayor of Grand Falls from 1986 until his election as MLA in 1987.

Elected as a Liberal in the Frank McKenna landslide, Duffie continued his law practice in addition to his legislative duties. In 1991, he was named to the board of governors for the University of New Brunswick.

In 1991, Duffie was re-elected as MLA and appointed to be the Minister of Education. He became Minister of Municipalities, Culture &amp; Housing in 1994. Upon being re-elected in 1995 he became Minister of Justice.

Duffie resigned from cabinet in 1997, after considering a run for leader, to spend more time with his family. Duffie co-chaired the leadership campaign of Camille Theriault with Doug Tyler.

Duffie did not seek re-election in the 1999 general election.

In 2001, following the resignation of Theriault, Duffie was encouraged to run for leader. His biggest supporters in the seven-member Liberal caucus were House Leader Eric Allaby and former Minister of Transportation Sheldon Lee. In early 2002, Shawn Graham emerged as the clear leader in delegate selection meetings and Duffie dropped out of the race, backing Graham.

Though he originally pledged to run in the 2003 election, he backed fellow Liberal and fellow former Grand Falls mayor Ron Ouellette who was elected on June 9.

Duffie returned to municipal politics and was elected mayor of Grand Falls on May 10, 2004, 18 years after he was first elected to the post.

In June 2008, he was named a provincial court judge.

<text>The Louisiana waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla) is a New World warbler, that breeds in eastern North America and winters in the West Indies and Central America. Plain brown above, it is white below, with black streaks and with buff flanks and undertail, distinguishing it from the closely related northern waterthrush. The habitats it prefers are streams and their surroundings, and other wet areas.

==Range==
The Louisiana waterthrush breeds in eastern North America from southernmost Canada and south through the eastern United States, excluding Florida and the coast. It is migratory, wintering in Central America and the West Indies. This is a rare vagrant to the western United States. They are one of the earlier neotropical migrants to return to their breeding grounds in the spring, often completing their migration in late March or early April, which is almost two months before most other warblers reach their breeding grounds. They are also one of the earliest warblers to vacate their breeding grounds, with some departing as early as July; almost all will have left by late August.

==Description==
The Louisiana waterthrush has a plain brown back and white underparts streaked with black. The flanks and undertail are buff. There is a strong white flared supercilium, and the legs are bright pink. All plumages are similar, but young birds have buff underparts rather than white. The main confusion species is the closely related northern waterthrush (&quot;Parkesia noveboracensis&quot;), which has white flanks and undertail, a striped throat, a slightly smaller bill, a shorter supercilium and duller pink legs.

In a study of the two waterthrushes in Connecticut nesting grounds, the Louisiana waterthrush, at an average of , was rather larger than the Northern, at an average of . The Louisiana waterthrush is the largest species of wood warbler. It measures in length and spanning across the wings. The weight of adult birds can vary from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail , the bill is and the tarsus is .

The male&#x27;s song is a musical, distinctive series of descending notes followed by a warble. The pitch of the beginning notes of the Louisiana&#x27;s song usually descend, just as does the hilly stream that is its preferred habitat, whereas in the northern waterthrush the song does not vary in pitch as much. The call is a hard &quot;chink&quot;.
Like the closely related northern waterthrush, the Louisiana waterthrush frequently bobs its tail.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The male Louisiana waterthrush does not sing on its wintering grounds before it leaves. It sings immediately when it arrives on its breeding territory. Whether it begins singing during migration is not known. When establishing his territory, a male sings vigorously nearly all day. After he acquires a mate, singing decreases quickly and he concentrates his singing into the morning hours. The breeding habitat is wet woodlands near running water and does not occur outside such areas as a breeder. However, during winter, the Louisiana waterthrush mainly forages along flooded roads or trails, and in parks, lawns and gardens, rarely entering true forest, even forested wetlands, in the subtropics. The northern waterthrush prefers stagnant, swampy waters and is generally a more terrestrial forager. Louisiana waterthrushes prefer dense vegetation along the water&#x27;s edge for nesting, since this provides the main protection of nest from predation. Louisiana waterthrushes nest in a rock crevice, mud bank or amongst tree roots, laying 4–6 eggs in a cup nest from late May to mid-June. Both parents construct the nest, which is built from wet, muddy leaves, pine needles, grass, and small twigs. The female Louisiana waterthrush incubates the eggs for 12 or 13 days. The fledging period lasts for 9 or 10 days, with both adults feeding the young for a further 4 weeks.

They are one of a few passerine species that does most of its foraging in actively running water, which only the dippers are known for at the family level. Mostly they depend on aquatic insects, molluscs, and crustaceans. Occasionally ground-based insects, such as beetles and ants are taken, as well as flying insects, such as flies, which may be hawked on the wing. Alternately, they forage amongst the leaf litter. In circumstances where the insect prey is low, Louisiana waterthrushes can target prey as large as salamanders and small fish.

==Status==
Less common and widespread today than it was two centuries ago, the Louisiana waterthrush&#x27;s decline is mainly due to the reduction of suitable habitat, through clearing and channelization of streams, as well as pollution, and the impounding of rivers and streams to create reservoirs. Additionally, because the Louisiana waterthrush is dependent on large areas of continuous forest, this species is likely to be threatened by increasing forest fragmentation. Timber harvesting, agriculture, urban development and gas drilling may further reduce the available habitat for this species. The population seems be quite sensitive to changes in habitat quality and quantity. Threats to the Canadian population of this species include reduced insect prey and reductions in water supply due to agricultural drainage, excessive irrigation and climate change, as well as logging and habitat fragmentation.

<text>Mary Read (died April 1721), was an English pirate. She and Anne Bonny were among the few female pirates during the &quot;Golden Age of Piracy&quot;.

Read was likely born in England. General History says she began dressing as a boy at a young age, at first at her mother&#x27;s urging in order to receive inheritance money and then as a teenager in order to join the British military. She then married and upon her husband&#x27;s death moved to the West Indies around 1715.

Around August 1720, she joined Jack Rackham&#x27;s crew, dressing as a man alongside Anne Bonny. Her time as a pirate was short lived, as she, Bonny, and Rackham were arrested in October 1720. Rackham was executed in November, but Read and Bonny both claimed to be pregnant during their trials and received delayed sentences. Read died while imprisoned in April 1721.

==Early life==
Mary&#x27;s mother had married a sailor, with whom she had a son. The husband then disappeared at sea. His mother then began to send her financial support for the boy.

She soon became pregnant again by another man, but hid the second pregnancy. Her son died, then she gave birth to a girl, Mary. To hide the shame, her mother passed young Mary off as her first and only child, the boy, to continue receiving support from the boy&#x27;s grandmother. The grandmother was fooled, and they lived on her money as long as possible.

At age 13, dressed as a boy, Read found work as a foot-boy, and, then, employment on a ship. She later joined the British military, and the crew of a British man-of-war. She later quit this and moved into Flanders where she carried arms in a regiment of foot as a cadet and served bravely but could not receive a commission because promotion in those days was mostly by purchase. Mary moved on to a regiment of horse which was allied with Dutch forces against the French (this could have been during the Nine Years War or during the War of the Spanish Succession). Read, in male disguise, proved herself through battle, but fell in love with a Flemish soldier. When they married, she used their military commission and gifts from intrigued brethren in arms to acquire an inn named &quot;De drie hoefijzers&quot; (&quot;The Three Horseshoes&quot;) near Breda Castle in the Netherlands.

Upon her husband&#x27;s early death, Read resumed male dress and military service in the Netherlands. With peace, there was no room for advancement, so she quit and boarded a ship bound for the West Indies. The ship that she boarded happened to be boarded by a pirate ship. Being disguised as a British male helped her, as the British crew members took her in.

==Becoming a pirate==
Read&#x27;s ship was taken by pirates, whom she willingly joined. She accepted the King&#x27;s pardon c. 1718–1719, then took a commission to privateer, but joined the crew in mutiny. In 1720 she joined pirate John &quot;Calico Jack&quot; Rackham and his companion, Anne Bonny, who both believed her to be a man. On 22 August 1720, the three stole an armed sloop named &quot;William&quot; from port in Nassau. Scholars are uncertain how female pirates like Read and Bonny concealed their sex in a male-dominated environment. Some scholars, however, have theorized that the wearing of breeches by female pirates may have been either a method of hiding their identity or simply as practical clothing that solidified their working place on board the ship among the other seamen.

When Bonny told Read that she was a woman because she was attracted to her, Read revealed that she too was a woman. To abate the jealousy of her lover, Rackham, who suspected romantic involvement between the two, Bonny told him that Read was a woman. Speculation over the relationship between Bonny and Read led to images depicting the two in battle together.

A victim of the pirates, Dorothy Thomas, left a description of Read and Bonny: They &quot;wore men&#x27;s jackets, and long trousers, and handkerchiefs tied about their heads: and ... each of them had a machete and pistol in their hands and they cursed and swore at the men to murder her [Dorothy Thomas].&quot; Thomas also recorded that she knew that they were women, &quot;from the largeness of their breasts.&quot;

==Capture and imprisonment==

On 22 October 1720, former privateer Captain Jonathan Barnet took Rackham&#x27;s crew by surprise, while they hosted a rum party with another crew of Englishmen at Negril Point off the west coast of the Colony of Jamaica. Allegedly, after a volley of fire disabled the pirate vessel, Rackham&#x27;s crew and their &quot;guests&quot; fled to the hold, leaving only the two women and one other to fight Barnet&#x27;s boarding party (it is also possible that Rackham and his crew were too drunk to fight). The official trial transcript says there was no defense mounted aside from a swivel gun being fired before Barnet fired in response. After that the record says that Rackham and his crew surrendered, requesting &quot;quarter&quot;.

Rackham and his crew were arrested and brought to trial in what is now Spanish Town, Jamaica, where they were sentenced to hang for acts of piracy, as were Read and Bonny. However, the women claimed they were both &quot;quick with child&quot; (known as &quot;pleading the belly&quot;), and received temporary stays of execution.

Read died while in prison in April 1721. Her burial 28 of April is in the records of St. Catherine&#x27;s church in Jamaica. There is no record of the burial of her baby, suggesting that she may have died while pregnant, or perhaps never had been pregnant.

The statues were eventually accepted by Lewes F.C.

<text>The premier of New Brunswick ( (masculine) or (feminine)) is the first minister and head of government for the Canadian province of New Brunswick.

The premier of a Canadian province is much like the prime minister of Canada. They are normally the leader of the party or coalition with the most seats in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. The premier is styled &quot;Honourable&quot; but is not a member of the privy council so this title is only for the duration of their term of office. Prior the establishment of the office, the Government leaders prior to responsible government was the chief political position in New Brunswick.

The premier is chosen by the lieutenant governor of New Brunswick.

The province of New Brunswick, since being established in 1785, has had a variety of leaders. Since the 1840s responsible government has been in place and the position of premier has been formalized.

The current premier is Susan Holt since November 2, 2024. After winning a majority in the 2024 general election, she became the first female premier in New Brunswick.

<text>Dinocrates of Rhodes (also Deinocrates, Dimocrates, Cheirocrates and Stasicrates; , fl. last quarter of the 4th century BC) was a Greek architect and technical adviser for Alexander the Great. He is known for his plan for the city of Alexandria, the monumental funeral pyre for Hephaestion and the reconstruction of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, as well as other works.

==City proposal of Mount Athos==

Dinocrates is noted by Vitruvius, in the only surviving architectural treatise from Antiquity, for his plan to sculpt in the flank of Mount Athos a colossal image of a man, holding a small city in one hand and with the other, pouring from a gigantic pitcher a river into the sea. Alexander dropped the proposal as Dinocrates reportedly did not consider the living conditions of the residents when he admitted to not planning for grain to be grown near the city; instead, it was to be transported by sea. The site of the current Alexandria was much more fertile and open than the harsh terrain of Mount Athos.

==Plan of Alexandria==

In 332 BC, Alexander appointed Dinocrates as director of the surveying and urban-planning work for the city of Alexandria (on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt), which was laid out on a Hippodamian grid plan that was influential in Hellenistic city planning. He was aided by Cleomenes of Naucratis and by Crates of Olynthus, an esteemed hydraulic engineer who built the waterworks for the city and the sewer system demanded by the low-lying site.

==Pyre of Hephaestion==

In Babylon, he designed the funerary monument to Alexander&#x27;s general Hephaestion (died in 324 BC), which was described by Diodorus Siculus, Arrian, Strabo, Plutarch and others. It was built of stone (unavailable locally) in imitation of a Babylonian temple, six stories tall, and entirely gilded.

==Second Temple of Artemis==

Dinocrates was involved in reconstructing the Temple of Artemis—one of the &quot;seven wonders of the world&quot;—which had been destroyed by Herostratus in an act of arson on July 21, 356 BC, the same night, it was said, that Alexander was being born.

==Other works==

Dinocrates also worked on an incomplete funerary monument for Alexander&#x27;s father, Philip II. Other works include several city plans and temples in Delphi, Delos and other Greek cities.
According to preliminary findings by archaeologists he may have been the architect of a vast Hellenistic tomb found at Amphipolis in 2012.

<doc id="418974" wikidata="Q614984" url="?curid=418974" title="Fluoroscopy">
<text>Fluoroscopy (), informally referred to as &quot;fluoro&quot;, is an imaging technique that uses X-rays to obtain real-time moving images of the interior of an object. In its primary application of medical imaging, a fluoroscope () allows a surgeon to see the internal structure and function of a patient, so that the pumping action of the heart or the motion of swallowing, for example, can be watched. This is useful for both diagnosis and therapy and occurs in general radiology, interventional radiology, and image-guided surgery.

In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, since the 1950s most fluoroscopes have included X-ray image intensifiers and cameras as well, to improve the image&#x27;s visibility and make it available on a remote display screen. For many decades, fluoroscopy tended to produce live pictures that were not recorded, but since the 1960s, as technology improved, recording and playback became the norm.

Fluoroscopy is similar to radiography and X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) in that it generates images using X-rays. The original difference was that radiography fixed still images on film, whereas fluoroscopy provided live moving pictures that were not stored. However, modern radiography, CT, and fluoroscopy now use digital imaging with image analysis software and data storage and retrieval. Compared to other x-ray imaging modalities the source projects from below leading to horizontally mirrored images, and in keeping with historical displays the grayscale remains inverted (radiodense objects such as bones are dark whereas traditionally they would be bright).

==Mechanism of action==
Although visible light can be seen by the naked eye (and thus forms images that people can look at), it does not penetrate most objects (only translucent or transparent ones). In contrast, X-rays can penetrate a wider variety of objects (such as the human body), but they are invisible to the naked eye. To take advantage of the penetration for image-forming purposes, one must somehow convert the X-rays&#x27; intensity variations (which correspond to material contrast and thus image contrast) into a form that is visible. Classic film-based radiography achieves this by the variable chemical changes that the X-rays induce in the film, and classic fluoroscopy achieves it by fluorescence, in which certain materials convert X-ray energy (or other parts of the spectrum) into visible light. This use of fluorescent materials to make a is how fluoroscopy got its name.

As the X-rays pass through the patient, they are attenuated by varying amounts as they pass through or reflect off the different tissues of the body, casting an X-ray shadow of the radiopaque tissues (such as bone tissue) on the fluorescent screen. Images on the screen are produced as the unattenuated or mildly attenuated X-rays from radiolucent tissues interact with atoms in the screen through the photoelectric effect, giving their energy to the electrons. While much of the energy given to the electrons is dissipated as heat, a fraction of it is given off as visible light.

Early radiologists would adapt their eyes to view the dim fluoroscopic images by sitting in darkened rooms, or by wearing red adaptation goggles. After the development of X-ray image intensifiers, the images were bright enough to see without goggles under normal ambient light. Image Intensifiers are still being used to this day (2023) with many new models still using II (Image Intensifier) as its method of acquiring the image which is still popular due to lower cost compared to Flat Panel Detectors and there have been many debates on whether II or Flat Detector is more sensitive to X-Ray, which results in lower X-Ray Dosage used. (Depending upon what type of technology / panel is being used influences this answer greatly)

Nowadays, in all forms of digital X-ray imaging (radiography, fluoroscopy, and CT) the conversion of X-ray energy into visible light can be achieved by the same types of electronic sensors, such as flat panel detectors, which convert the X-ray energy into electrical signals: small bursts of electric current that convey information that a computer can analyze, store, and output as images. As fluorescence is a special case of luminescence, digital X-ray imaging is conceptually similar to digital gamma ray imaging (scintigraphy, SPECT, and PET) in that in both of these imaging mode families, the information conveyed by the variable attenuation of invisible electromagnetic radiation as it passes through tissues with various radiodensities is converted by an electronic sensor into an electric signal that is processed by a computer and output as a visible-light image.

== Medical use ==
Fluoroscopy has become an important tool in medical imaging to render moving pictures during a surgery or any other procedure.
===Surgical fluoroscopy===
Fluoroscopy is used in various types of surgical procedure, such as orthopaedic surgery and podiatric surgery.
In both of those, it is used to guide fracture reduction and in use in certain procedures that have extensive hardware. Specifically, once the fracture is realigned, a surgeon will (with the assistance of their surgical technologist) drill a guide pin into the bone tissue and use flouroscopy to insure proper angle of the pin - then a cannulated drill bit is inserted over the pin to prepare a ‘hole’ for a bone screw. If the surgeon prefers a different angle, they simply reverse the pin and redrill. Flouroscopy will be use for each screw placed -which has greatly improved proper fracture heal due to more accurate reduction.

===Urology===
In urology, fluoroscopy is used in retrograde pyelography and micturating cystourethrography to detect various abnormalities related to the urinary system.
Fluoroscopy is used to confirm needle and guide wire location when placing a nephrostomy.

===Cardiology===
In cardiology, fluoroscopy is used for diagnostic angiography, percutaneous coronary interventions, (pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization devices).

===Gastrointestinal fluoroscopy===

Fluoroscopy can be used to examine the digestive system using a substance that is opaque to X-rays (usually barium sulfate or gastrografin), which is introduced into the digestive system either by swallowing or as an enema. This is normally as part of a double-contrast technique, using positive and negative contrast. Barium sulfate coats the walls of the digestive tract (positive contrast), which allows the shape of the digestive tract to be outlined as white or clear on an X-ray. Air may then be introduced (negative contrast), which looks black on the film. The barium meal is an example of a contrast agent swallowed to examine the upper digestive tract. While soluble barium compounds are very toxic, the insoluble barium sulfate is nontoxic because its low solubility prevents the body from absorbing it. Investigations of the gastrointestinal tract include barium enemas, defecating proctograms, barium meals and swallows, and enteroclysis.

===Other medical uses===
* Liver biopsy is performed under fluoroscopic guidance at many centers.
* Angiography of the leg, heart, and cerebral vessels.
* Placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter
* Placement of a weighted feeding tube (e.g. Dobhoff) into the duodenum after previous attempts without fluoroscopy have failed
* Discography, an invasive diagnostic procedure for evaluation for intervertebral disc pathology.
* In lumbar puncture, fluoroscopy helps to guide where the needles of the spinal tap can go, and may reduce the number of attempts required for a successful lumbar puncture.

== Other uses ==
Fluoroscopy is also used in airport security scanners to check for hidden weapons or bombs. These machines use lower doses of radiation than medical fluoroscopy. The reason for higher doses in medical applications is that they are more demanding about tissue contrast, and for the same reason they sometimes require contrast media.

==History==
===Early era===


Fluoroscopy&#x27;s origins and radiography&#x27;s origins can both be traced back to 8 November 1895, when Wilhelm Röntgen, or in English script Roentgen, noticed a barium platinocyanide screen fluorescing as a result of being exposed to what he would later call X-rays (algebraic x variable signifying &quot;unknown&quot;). Within months of this discovery, the first crude fluoroscopes were created. These experimental fluoroscopes were simply thin cardboard screens that had been coated on the inside with a layer of fluorescent metal salt, attached to a funnel-shaped cardboard eyeshade which excluded room light with a viewing eyepiece which the user held up to his eye. The fluoroscopic image obtained in this way was quite faint. Even when finally improved and commercially introduced for diagnostic imaging, the limited light produced from the fluorescent screens of the earliest commercial scopes necessitated that a radiologist sit for a period in the darkened room where the imaging procedure was to be performed, to first accustom his eyes to increase their sensitivity to perceive the faint image. The placement of the radiologist behind the screen also resulted in significant dosing of the radiologist.

In the late 1890s, Thomas Edison began investigating materials for ability to fluoresce when X-rayed, and by the turn of the century he had invented a fluoroscope with sufficient image intensity to be commercialized. Edison had quickly discovered that calcium tungstate screens produced brighter images. Edison, however, abandoned his research in 1903 because of the health hazards that accompanied the use of these early devices. Clarence Dally, a glass blower of lab equipment and tubes at Edison&#x27;s laboratory was repeatedly exposed, developing radiation poisoning, later dying from an aggressive cancer. Edison himself damaged an eye in testing these early fluoroscopes.

During this infant commercial development, many incorrectly predicted that the moving images of fluoroscopy would completely replace roentgenographs (radiographic still image films), but the then superior diagnostic quality of the roentgenograph and their already alluded-to safety enhancement of lower radiation dose via shorter exposure prevented this from occurring. Another factor was that plain films inherently offered recording of the image in a simple and inexpensive way, whereas recording and playback of fluoroscopy remained a more complex and expensive proposition for decades to come (discussed in detail below).

Red adaptation goggles were developed by Wilhelm Trendelenburg in 1916 to address the problem of dark adaptation of the eyes, previously studied by Antoine Beclere. The resulting red light from the goggles&#x27; filtration correctly sensitized the physician&#x27;s eyes prior to the procedure, while still allowing him to receive enough light to function normally.

=== X-ray shoe fitting ===

More trivial uses of the technology emerged in the early 1920s, including a shoe-fitting fluoroscope that was used at shoe stores and department stores. Concerns regarding the impact of frequent or poorly controlled use were expressed in the late 1940s and 1950s. Issues raised by doctors and health professionals included the potential for burns to the skin, damage to bone, and abnormal development of the feet. These concerns lead to the development of new guidelines, regulations and ultimately the practice&#x27;s end by the early 1960s. Shoe salesmen and industry representatives sometimes defended their use, claiming that there was no evidence of harm, and that their use prevented harm to the feet caused by poorly-fitted shoes.

Fluoroscopy was discontinued in shoe-fitting because the radiation exposure risk outweighed the trivial benefit. Only important applications such as health care, bodily safety, food safety, nondestructive testing, and scientific research meet the risk-benefit threshold for use.

===Analog electronic era===
Analog electronics revolutionized fluoroscopy. The development of the X-ray image intensifier by Westinghouse in the late 1940s in combination with closed circuit TV cameras of the 1950s allowed for brighter pictures and better radiation protection. The red adaptation goggles became obsolete as image intensifiers allowed the light produced by the fluorescent screen to be amplified and made visible in a lighted room. The addition of the camera enabled viewing of the image on a monitor, allowing a radiologist to view the images in a separate room away from the risk of radiation exposure. The commercialization of video tape recorders beginning in 1956 allowed the TV images to be recorded and played back at will.

===Digital electronic era===
Digital electronics were applied to fluoroscopy beginning in the early 1960s, when Frederick G. Weighart and James F. McNulty (1929–2014) at Automation Industries, Inc., then, in El Segundo, California produced on a fluoroscope the world&#x27;s first image to be digitally generated in real-time, while developing a later commercialized portable apparatus for the onboard nondestructive testing of naval aircraft. Square wave signals were detected on a fluorescent screen to create the image.

From the late 1980s onward, digital imaging technology was reintroduced to fluoroscopy after development of improved detector systems. Modern improvements in screen phosphors, digital image processing, image analysis, and flat panel detectors have allowed for increased image quality while minimizing the radiation dose to the patient. Modern fluoroscopes use caesium iodide (CsI) screens and produce noise-limited images, ensuring that the minimal radiation dose results while still obtaining images of acceptable quality.

===Etymology===
Many names exist in the medical literature for moving pictures taken with X-rays. They include fluoroscopy, fluorography, cinefluorography, photofluorography, fluororadiography, kymography (electrokymography, roentgenkymography), cineradiography (cine), videofluorography, and videofluoroscopy. Today, the word &quot;fluoroscopy&quot; is widely understood to be a hypernym of all the aforementioned terms, which explains why it is the most commonly used and why the others are declining in usage. The profusion of names is an idiomatic artifact of technological change, as follows:

As soon as X-rays (and their application of seeing inside the body) were discovered in the 1890s, both looking and recording were pursued. Both live moving images and recorded still images were available from the beginning with simple equipment; thus, both &quot;looking with a fluorescent screen&quot; ( + ) and &quot;recording/engraving with radiation&quot; ( + ) were immediately named with Neo-Latin words—both words are attested since 1896.

The quest for recorded moving images, though, was a more complex challenge. In the 1890s, moving pictures of any kind (whether taken with visible light or with invisible radiation) were emerging technologies. Because the word &quot;photography&quot; (literally &quot;recording/engraving with light&quot;) was long since established as connoting a still-image medium, the word &quot;cinematography&quot; (literally &quot;recording/engraving movement&quot;) was coined for the new medium of visible-light moving pictures. Soon, several new words were coined for achieving moving radiographic pictures. This was often done either by filming a simple fluoroscopic screen with a movie camera (variously called fluorography, cinefluorography, photofluorography, or fluororadiography) or by taking serial radiographs rapidly to serve as the frames in a movie (cineradiography). Either way, the resulting film reel could be displayed by a movie projector. Another group of techniques included various kinds of kymography, whose common theme was capturing recordings in a series of moments, with a concept similar to movie film, although not necessarily with movie-type playback; rather, the sequential images would be compared frame by frame (a distinction comparable to tile mode versus cine mode in today&#x27;s CT terminology). Thus, electrokymography and roentgenkymography were among the early ways to record images from a simple fluoroscopic screen.

Television also was under early development during these decades (1890s–1920s), but even after commercial TV began widespread adoption after World War II, it remained a live-only medium for a time. In the mid-1950s, a commercialized ability to capture the moving pictures of television onto magnetic tape (with a video tape recorder) was developed. This soon led to the addition of the &quot;&quot; prefix to the words fluorography and fluoroscopy, with the words videofluorography and videofluoroscopy attested since 1960. In the 1970s, videotape moved from TV studios and medical imaging into the consumer market with home video via VHS and Betamax, and those formats were also incorporated into medical video equipment.

Thus, over time the cameras and recording media for fluoroscopic imaging have progressed: The original kind of fluoroscopy, and the common kind for its first half-century of existence, simply used none, because for most diagnosis and treatment, they were not essential. For those investigations that needed to be transmitted or recorded (such as for training or research), movie cameras using film (such as 16 mm film) were the medium. In the 1950s, analog electronic video cameras (at first only producing live output, but later using video tape recorders) appeared. Since the 1990s, digital video cameras, flat panel detectors, and storage of data to local servers or (more recently) secure cloud servers have been used. Late-model fluoroscopes all use digital image processing and image analysis software, which not only helps to produce optimal image clarity and contrast, but also allows that result with a minimal radiation dose (because signal processing can take tiny inputs from low radiation doses and amplify them while to some extent also differentiating signal from noise).

Whereas the word &quot;cine&quot; () in general usage refers to cinema (that is, a movie) or to certain film formats (cine film) for recording such a movie, in medical usage it refers to cineradiography or, in recent decades, to any digital imaging mode that produces cine-like moving images (for example, newer CT and MRI systems can put out to either cine mode or tile mode). Cineradiography records 30-frame/second fluoroscopic images of internal organs such as the heart taken during injection of contrast dye to better visualize regions of stenosis, or to record motility in the body&#x27;s gastrointestinal tract. The predigital technology is being replaced with digital imaging systems. Some of these decrease the frame rate, but also decrease the absorbed dose of radiation to the patient. As they improve, frame rates will likely increase.

Today, owing to technological convergence, the word &quot;fluoroscopy&quot; is widely understood to be a hypernym of all the earlier names for moving pictures taken with X-rays, both live and recorded. Also owing to technological convergence, radiography, CT, and fluoroscopy are now all digital imaging modes using X-rays with image-analysis software and easy data storage and retrieval. Just as movies, TV, and web videos are to a substantive extent no longer separate technologies, but only variations on common underlying digital themes, so, too, are the X-ray imaging modes, and indeed, the term &quot;X-ray imaging&quot; is the ultimate hypernym that unites all of them, even subsuming both fluoroscopy and four-dimensional CT (4DCT), which is the newest form of moving pictures taken with X-rays. Many decades may pass before the earlier hyponyms fall into disuse, not the least because the day when 4D CT displaces all earlier forms of moving X-ray imaging may yet be distant.

The use of X-rays, a form of ionizing radiation, requires the potential risks from a procedure to be carefully balanced with the benefits of the procedure to the patient. Because the patient must be exposed to a continuous source of X-rays instead of a momentary pulse, a fluoroscopy procedure generally subjects a patient to a higher absorbed dose of radiation than an ordinary (still) radiograph. Only important applications such as health care, bodily safety, food safety, nondestructive testing, and scientific research meet the risk-benefit threshold for use. In the first half of the 20th century, shoe-fitting fluoroscopes were used in shoe stores, but their use was discontinued because it is no longer considered acceptable to use radiation exposure, however small the dose, for nonessential purposes. Much research has been directed toward reducing radiation exposure, and recent advances in fluoroscopy technology such as digital image processing and flat panel detectors, have resulted in much lower radiation doses than former procedures.
Because fluoroscopy involves the use of X-rays, a form of ionizing radiation, fluoroscopic procedures pose a potential for increasing the patient&#x27;s risk of radiation-induced cancer. In addition to the cancer risk and other stochastic radiation effects, deterministic radiation effects have also been observed ranging from mild erythema, equivalent of a sunburn, to more serious burns. Radiation doses to the patient depend greatly both on the size of the patient and length of the procedure, with typical skin dose rates quoted as 20–50 mGy/min. Exposure times vary depending on the procedure being performed, ranging from minutes to hours.

A study of radiation-induced skin injuries was performed in 1994 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) followed by an advisory to minimize further fluoroscopy-induced injuries. The problem of radiation injuries due to fluoroscopy has been further addressed in review articles in 2000 and 2010.

While deterministic radiation effects are a possibility, radiation burns are not typical in standard fluoroscopic procedures. Most procedures sufficiently long in duration to produce radiation burns are part of necessary life-saving operations.

X-ray image intensifiers generally have radiation-reducing systems such as pulsed rather than constant radiation, along with &quot;last image hold&quot;, which &quot;freezes&quot; the screen and makes it available for examination without exposing the patient to unnecessary radiation.

Image intensifiers have been introduced that increase the brightness of the screen, so that the patient can be exposed to a lower dose of X-rays. Whilst this reduces the risk of ionisation occurring, it does not remove it entirely.

==Equipment==
===X-ray image intensifiers===
The invention of X-ray image intensifiers in the 1950s allowed the image on the screen to be visible under normal lighting conditions, and provided the option of recording the images with a conventional camera. Subsequent improvements included the coupling of, at first, video cameras, and later, digital cameras using image sensors such as charge-coupled devices or active pixel sensors to permit recording of moving images and electronic storage of still images.

Modern image intensifiers no longer use a separate fluorescent screen. Instead, a caesium iodide phosphor is deposited directly on the photocathode of the intensifier tube. On a typical general-purpose system, the output image is approximately 105 times brighter than the input image. This brightness gain comprises a flux gain (amplification of photon number) and minification gain (concentration of photons from a large input screen onto a small output screen) each of about 100. This level of gain is sufficient that quantum noise, due to the limited number of X-ray photons, is a significant factor limiting image quality.

Within the XRII, five mini components make up this intensifier, which are:
* The glass envelope helps maintain the tube vacuum to allow control of the electron flow, but it has no actual functional part in the image formation.
* Input phosphor, when the X-rays interact with this piece, its energy is converted into a burst of visible light photons as they occur like this on the intensifying screen/monitor.
* The photocathode is a thin metal layer, that is usually composed of caesium and antimony compounds that respond to stimulation by the light with the emission of the electron.
* The electrostatic focusing lenses are located along the length of the tube and are responsible for the focusing of the electrons across the tube from the input to the output phosphor.
* The output phosphor is usually made up of cadmium sulfide crystals and is what records the arrival of the photoelectrons and normally results in 50–70 times gain. 

Image intensifiers are available with input diameters up to 45 cm, and a resolution of around two to three line pairs/mm.

===Flat-panel detectors===

The introduction of flat-panel detectors allows for the replacement of the image intensifier in fluoroscope design. Flat-panel detectors offer increased sensitivity to X-rays, so have the potential to reduce patient radiation dose. Temporal resolution is also improved over image intensifiers, reducing motion blurring. Contrast ratio is also improved over image intensifiers; flat-panel detectors are linear over a very wide latitude, whereas image intensifiers have a maximum contrast ratio of about 35:1. Spatial resolution is roughly equal, although an image intensifier operating in magnification mode may be slightly better than a flat panel.

Flat-panel detectors are considerably more expensive to purchase and repair than image intensifiers, so their use adoption is primarily in specialties that require high-speed imaging, e.g., vascular imaging and cardiac catheterization.

===Contrast agents===
A number of substances have been used as radiocontrast agents, including silver, bismuth, caesium, thorium, tin, zirconium, tantalum, tungsten, and lanthanide compounds. The use of thoria (thorium dioxide) as an agent was rapidly stopped, as thorium causes liver cancer.

Most modern injected radiographic positive contrast media are iodine-based. Iodinated contrast comes in two forms - ionic and nonionic compounds. Nonionic contrast is significantly more expensive than ionic (about three to five times the cost), but nonionic contrast tends to be safer for the patient, causing fewer allergic reactions and uncomfortable side effects such as hot sensations or flushing. Most imaging centers now use nonionic contrast exclusively, finding that the benefits to patients outweigh the expense.

Negative radiographic contrast agents are air and carbon dioxide (CO2). The latter is easily absorbed by the body and causes less spasm. It can also be injected into the blood, where air absolutely cannot due to the risk of an air embolism. 

==Imaging concerns==
In addition to spatial blurring factors that plague all X-ray imaging devices, caused by such things as Lubberts effect, K-fluorescence reabsorption, and electron range, fluoroscopic systems also experience temporal blurring due to system latency. This temporal blurring has the effect of averaging frames together. While this helps reduce noise in images with stationary objects, it creates motion blurring for moving objects. Temporal blurring also complicates measurements of system performance for fluoroscopic systems.

<doc id="418979" wikidata="Q473553" url="?curid=418979" title="The Greenbrier">
<text>The Greenbrier is a luxury resort located in the Allegheny Mountains near White Sulphur Springs in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, in the United States.

Since 1778, visitors have traveled to this part of the state to &quot;take the waters&quot; of the area. Today, the Greenbrier is situated on of land with 710 guest rooms, 20 restaurants and lounges, more than 55 indoor and outdoor activities and sports, and more than 35 retail shops.

The current Greenbrier was built in 1913 by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and was owned for much of its history by that company and its successors, Chessie System and CSX Corporation. Following years of heavy losses, CSX had the hotel file for bankruptcy protection in 2009. Justice Family Group, LLC, a company owned by coal baron and later governor of West Virginia Jim Justice, subsequently bought the property and guaranteed all debts, resulting in dismissal of the bankruptcy protection. Justice promised to return the hotel to its former status as a five-star resort and to introduce &quot;tasteful&quot; gambling for guests to increase profit. The Greenbrier Hotel Corp. today operates as a subsidiary of Justice&#x27;s company.

The last U.S. president to stay at the Greenbrier during a presidency was Dwight D. Eisenhower. A total of 28 presidents have stayed at the hotel.

The Greenbrier is also the site of a massive underground bunker that was meant to serve as an emergency shelter for the United States Congress during the Cold War. The bunker was code named &quot;Project Greek Island&quot;.

==History==
===Early development===
A spring of sulphur water is at the center of the resort property. It is surrounded by the white-columned spring house, topped by a green dome that has been the symbol of the Greenbrier for generations. Beginning in 1778, Mrs. Anderson, a local pioneer, adopted the local Native American tradition of &quot;taking the waters&quot; to relieve her chronic rheumatism. Based on this resource, for the first 125 years, the resort was known by the name White Sulphur Springs. It was a destination for people during the summers who wanted to escape coastal heat and diseases.

The property was acquired by the Calwells, a prominent Baltimore family. They developed the large property as a resort, selling cottages, many of which still stand today, to prominent Southern individuals. Notable guests of the early 19th century included Martin Van Buren and Henry Clay.

In 1858, they built a huge hotel building on the property. The Grand Central Hotel came to be known by the moniker &quot;The White&quot; and, later, &quot;The Old White&quot;. During the Civil War, the property changed hands between forces of the Confederate Army and the Union Army, who almost burned the resort to the ground.

Following the Civil War, the resort reopened under Confederate States of America Major Cornelius Boyle. It became a place for many Southerners and Northerners alike to vacation. It was the setting for some notable post-war reconciliations. The &quot;White Sulphur Manifesto&quot;, the only political paper published by Confederate General Robert E. Lee after the Civil War, advocated the merging of the two societies. The resort became a center of regional post-war society, especially after the arrival of the railroad. Beginning in 1869, it provided direct service to the resort&#x27;s gates.

===The Greenbrier===
In 1910, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway purchased the resort property, building additional amenities, including the current bath wing, which opened in 1911. The C&amp;O&#x27;s improvements culminated with the construction of a colossal six-story, 250-room hotel building, which forms the central wing of today&#x27;s hotel. Designed by British-born American architect Frederick Julius Sterner, it opened on September 25, 1913. At this time, what had for decades been a summer establishment was converted to a year-round resort, and the name was officially changed to the Greenbrier, after the neighboring county. The neighboring town had incorporated in 1909 and adopted the name White Sulphur Springs, which the resort had previously used. The railroad also introduced the game of golf, which became a defining feature of the resort. The first small course was opened in 1910, and a full 18-hole course, designed by Charles B. Macdonald, opened at the Greenbrier in 1913. That original course is today known as &quot;The Old White TPC&quot;. The historic Old White Hotel structure was demolished in 1922 because it failed to meet then-current fire codes. In 1931, completion of the north wing, crossing the original 1913 wing like a &quot;T&quot;, nearly doubled the size of the hotel.

Just after the United States entered World War II, the resort was called on December 17, 1941, to serve as a relocation center for Axis diplomats who were in the United States and had been interned as enemies of the United States. The first detainees were Germans; later, they were joined by Japanese diplomats previously interned at The Homestead in Hot Springs, Virginia. The hotel served as a diplomatic detention center until July 8, 1942.

The hotel briefly reopened for the 1942 season, but was soon commandeered by the U.S. Army for use as a hospital. The Army paid $3.3 million for the property, which had been valued at $5.4 million, and took over control of the property on September 1, 1942. They converted the resort to a 2000-bed hospital, known as Ashford General Hospital, named for Bailey Ashford, a noted Army doctor. The hospital opened on October 16, 1943. It treated nearly 25,000 patients before closing on June 30, 1946. The property was sold back to the C&amp;O railroad for just under the $3.3 million they had been paid in 1942.

C&amp;O hired internationally renowned interior designer Dorothy Draper to completely redecorate and restore the Greenbrier. Draper oversaw every element of the design of the property in her trademark style: combining bold colors, classical influences and modern touches, and the work took two years. The Greenbrier&#x27;s reopening, celebrated from April 15 to April 18, 1948, was an international social event of the season. Notable attendees included the Duke of Windsor and his wife, Wallis Simpson (who had spent her honeymoon with her first husband at the Greenbrier in 1916), Bing Crosby, and members of the Joseph Kennedy family. Since the late 20th century, the resort has hosted several presidents and vice-presidents, in addition to foreign dignitaries such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, and Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco.

===International meetings===
The Greenbrier resort has played host to several important international meetings. During World War II, future Canadian prime minister Lester Pearson, then assigned to the Canadian embassy in Washington, D.C., was among the illustrious guests planning the Allied effort for resources allocation. The U.S., Mexican, and Canadian leaders met at the Greenbrier in 1955 for international discussions.

===The Bunker===
In the late 1950s, the U.S. government approached the Greenbrier for assistance in creating a secret emergency relocation center to house Congress in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. The classified, underground facility, named &quot;Project Greek Island&quot;, was built at the same time as the West Virginia Wing, an above-ground addition to the hotel, from 1959 to 1962.

Although for 30 years the bunker was kept stocked with supplies, it was never used as an emergency location, even during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The existence of the bunker was not acknowledged by the government; Ted Gup of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported it in a 1992 story. Immediately after publication of the &quot;Post&quot; story, the government decommissioned the bunker. The facility has since been renovated. It is used as a data storage facility by CSX IP for the private sector. It is featured as an attraction in which visitors can tour the now declassified facilities, known as The Bunker.

===Justice family ownership===
On March 20, 2009, the resort filed for bankruptcy, listing debt of up to $500 million and assets of $100 million. It had suffered from competition from a wide variety of resorts, and declining traffic since the postwar period as patrons shifted to destinations they could reach by automobile. The resort lost $35 million in 2008 and had to lay off 650 employees, half its workforce, in early 2009. Pending court and regulatory approval, it was announced in March 2009 that the resort was to be sold to the Marriott hotel chain, contingent upon significant concessions from the unions and approval of $50 million in financing from CSX.

On May 7, 2009, the Justice family of West Virginia purchased the resort for $20 million. The Justice family, headed by patriarch Jim Justice, has extensive farm and mining operations in West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. It farms through its Justice Family Farms group, headquartered in Beckley, West Virginia. In early 2009, it sold its Bluestone Coal Corporation network of West Virginia coal mines to the Russian mining company, Mechel, based in Moscow.

The Marriott Corporation asserted that it had a valid contract to purchase the hotel, and expected to see that contract honored. However, Justice ultimately settled with Marriott. The bankruptcy judge dismissed the case on May 19, 2009, clearing the way for Justice&#x27;s purchase of the property.

The resort was closed briefly after the 2016 West Virginia flood; however, flood victims who needed a place to stay were offered rooms in the hotel. The hotel reopened on July 12, 2016, with several amenities, including an off-road Jeep trail, several walking trails, and the falconry operation, which had been closed for the year.

With Justice&#x27;s election as Governor of West Virginia in 2017, his daughter Jill took over day-to-day control of the Greenbrier.

Financial woes have continued into the 2020s. Ownership of the Greenbrier has been used as collateral for loans taken out by the Justice family, including to both Carter Bank &amp; Trust as well as a $50 million loan from JPMorgan Chase. Tax liens have been placed on other Justice properties for non-payment of taxes as well. The Justices have been in court several times for non-payment of debts, suggesting that bailing out the property might not be easy for the family.

=== The Casino Club at the Greenbrier ===
In November 2008, county voters narrowly approved a local option referendum that would permit casino-style gambling at the hotel. The rules, regulations, and tax rates were signed into law on May 8, 2009. The Justice family promised that gambling facilities at the resort would be &quot;tasteful&quot; if established.
The temporary casino, named &quot;The Tavern Casino&quot;, opened on October 1, 2009. The permanent casino, The Casino Club at the Greenbrier opened on July 2, 2010 with a celebrity gala.

In 2013, the casino added simulcast horse racing and associated betting to its offerings.

===Presidents&#x27; Cottage Museum===
Twenty-eight presidents have been hosted at the Greenbrier. The Presidents&#x27; Cottage Museum is a two-story building with exhibits about these visits and the history of the Greenbrier. The building is open seasonally.

==Golf==
The resort has a significant place in golf history. The original nine holes were designed by Alexander H. Findlay. In 1944, Sam Snead became the head golf professional at Greenbrier and in retirement held the position of the resort&#x27;s pro emeritus. In the 21st century, that title has been held by Tom Watson and later Lee Trevino.

The Greenbrier was the site of the Ryder Cup in 1979, the first to be contested under the format of United States against Europe, which has been continued to the present. It hosted the Solheim Cup in 1994, the women&#x27;s equivalent to the Ryder Cup. The Greenbrier is the first of three locations to host both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s United States versus Europe team competitions, the Ryder and Solheim cups; it was joined in 1998 by Muirfield Village in Dublin, Ohio, with Scotland&#x27;s Gleneagles Hotel PGA Centenary Course, the host of the 2014 Ryder Cup, joining when it hosted the 2019 Solheim Cup.

The Greenbrier American Express Championship on the Senior PGA Tour (now the PGA Tour Champions) was held from 1985 through 1987.

The PGA Tour came to the hotel in 2010 with the Greenbrier Classic. After two years of being held on the last weekend of July, the tournament obtained the more favorable date of the first weekend in July, starting in 2012. On March 28, 2011, The Old White Course became a TPC course. The 2016 event was canceled due to severe flooding in June.

All four of the golf courses on the property, the Old White TPC, the Greenbrier Course, the Meadows Course, and the Snead Course were damaged in the 2016 flood. On July 12, 2016, a modified course, made up mostly of the Greenbrier Course but also parts of the Meadows Course, was laid out and opened for play that year. The remaining courses were closed for the year.

In 2020, the PGA Tour cancelled its TPC affiliation with the Greenbrier. The resort hosted a LIV Golf event at the Old White Course in August 2023.

==Tennis==
The resort is home to a 2,500-seat tennis stadium, five Har-Tru outdoor courts and five Deco-Turf indoor courts. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, all matches during the 2020 World TeamTennis season were held at the Greenbrier.

==Medical and sports facilities==
The Greenbrier Clinic, adjacent to the hotel, has operated as an executive health facility since 1948. In 1971 it began operating independently from the hotel (although still leasing its facility from the Greenbrier).

In 2011, Justice announced an ambitious plan to construct the Greenbrier Medical Institute, a large-scale medical facility with a projected cost of at least $250 million, planned to be built in five stages. It was to include a sports medicine facility to be headed by orthopedic surgeon James Andrews. Construction of the first stage began in May 2012.

The project was intended to establish relationships with professional sports teams, as the resort wanted to attract a National Football League team that would hold its annual training camp at the Greenbrier. In March 2014, the New Orleans Saints and the hotel reached agreement on a three-year deal. The hotel committed to build three football fields and other facilities for the Saints, at an estimated cost of $20–25 million, adjacent to the medical facilities. The project was to be partially subsidized by tax breaks recently approved by the state legislature, with an estimated value of $25 million over 10 years.

The relationship between the hotel and the Saints reportedly developed after a visit by Saints head coach Sean Payton to the 2013 Greenbrier Classic golf tournament to play in its pro-am competition and then to serve as caddie for his friend, PGA Tour player Ryan Palmer. After three seasons (during which the Saints praised the Greenbrier&#x27;s facilities but finished with a 7–9 record every year), the Saints did not renew their contract with the hotel. The Houston Texans took over the facilities for their 2017 training camp. The New England Patriots have also held training camp at the Greenbrier.

The Spring League, a minor league football organization which evolved into the USFL, held six of the seven games in their inaugural season at the Greenbrier.

==In popular culture==
Set in West Virginia in the aftermath of a nuclear war, the video game &quot;Fallout 76&quot; features a location known as &quot;The Whitespring Resort&quot; which strongly resembles the exterior and interior of the Greenbrier, including the hidden government bunker beneath.

&quot;Too Many Cooks&quot;, the 1938 murder mystery by Rex Stout, takes place at the Kanawha Spa, which is clearly modeled after the Greenbrier. Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin are attending a gathering of world renowned chefs, one of whom is murdered. They must identify the killer in order to avoid being detained there while the local authorities fumble about. The Wolfe Pack, the fan club for Nero Wolfe mysteries, has held several gourmet dinners at the Greenbrier in honor of the novel.

&quot;Entombed&quot;, a 2010 novel by Brian Keene, takes place in a fictionalized West Virginia hotel with a bunker beneath. The author states in the afterword that he was inspired by the Greenbrier.

&quot;The Grand Design&quot;, a 2022 novel by Joy Callaway, is a fictionalized life story of the interior decorator Dorothy Draper during her redesign of the Greenbrier, published by HarperCollins.

The historical fiction novel &quot;In the Shadow of the Greenbrier&quot;, by Emily Matchar, tells the story of four generations of a Jewish family living near the Greenbrier during key moments in the resort&#x27;s history. It was published by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons in 2024.

The Greenbrier was at the center of a moment on the U.S. game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;. Comedian Norm Macdonald&#x27;s $1,000,000 question was in reference to the Greenbrier&#x27;s bunker. Macdonald was ready to correctly guess the Greenbrier but believed host Regis Philbin was trying to talk him out of the answer. Philbin did not know the answer, and was trying to ensure that Macdonald did not lose the $468,000 that he had already won for a charity. Macdonald walked away with $500,000 for Paul Newman&#x27;s Hole in the Wall Camps.

The Greenbrier is used as a setting in the 1933 film &quot;Mary Stevens, M.D.&quot;

The Greenbrier also receives an appearance in the video game &quot;Fallout 76&quot; as the Whitesprings.

<text>Kabir Kuh (; Kurdish: کڤەر -Kiver) is one of the long ranges of the Zagros Mountains near the border of Lurestan and Ilam provinces in Ilam province, Iran. Covering an area of , Kabir Kuh stretches in length and in width along the Zagros Mountains in the northwest–southeast direction. It begins about south of Ilam and stretches down to the vicinity of Andimeshk in Khuzestan. Made mainly by Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, the Kabir Kuh range consists of a large number of mountains, including Shah Ahmad, Tabriz, Kaleh-bad, Filman, Damaghey-e Anar, Rivasan, Puneh, Sabzkhani, Zarrin, Golgol that are covered by snow and ice all year round. Its highest peak is Kan Seifi with elevation, south-east of Ilam. Kabir Kuh runs along the Seymareh River, which becomes Karkheh when joins the Kashkan river before reaching the border of Ilam province and Khuzestan province. Kabir Kuh divides the mountainous region in western Iran into two regions generally referred as Piškuh (eastern side) and Poštkuh (western side), the latter virtually coinciding with Ilam. In prehistoric times, one of the largest known landslides occurred on the north-eastern slope of Kabir Kouh, moving across the Seymareh River.

The eastern side is dominated by steep slopes where water and wooded valleys abound. The western side is, however, quite dry but rich in oil reservoirs and underground resources.

<text>The country in which a motor vehicle&#x27;s vehicle registration plate was issued may be indicated by an international vehicle registration code, also called Vehicle Registration Identification code or VRI code, formerly known as an International Registration Letter or International Circulation Mark. It is referred to as the Distinguishing sign of the State of registration in the Geneva Convention on Road Traffic of 1949 and the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968.

The allocation of codes is maintained by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe as the &quot;Distinguishing Signs Used on Vehicles in International Traffic&quot; (sometimes abbreviated to DSIT), authorised by the UN&#x27;s Geneva Convention on Road Traffic and the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. Many vehicle codes created since the adoption of ISO 3166 coincide with ISO two- or three-letter codes. The 2004 South-East Asian &quot;Agreement ... for the Facilitation of Cross-Border Transport of Goods and People&quot; uses a mixture of ISO and DSIT codes: Myanmar uses MYA, China CHN, and Cambodia KH (ISO codes), Thailand uses T (DSIT code), Laos LAO, and Vietnam VN (coincident ISO and DSIT codes).

The Geneva Convention on Road Traffic entered into force on 26 March 1952. One of the main benefits of the convention for motorists is the obligation on signatory countries to recognize the legality of vehicles from other signatory countries. When driving in other signatory countries, the distinguishing sign of the country of registration must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle. This sign must be placed separately from the registration plate and may &quot;not&quot; be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate.

==History==

===1909 Paris Convention===
The display of a national distinctive mark on a white oval plate, with black letters was first introduced by the 1909 International Convention with respect to the Circulation of Motor Vehicles signed in Paris. The plate was required to be affixed to the rear of the vehicle, separate from the number plate displaying the vehicle&#x27;s national registration mark. The 1909 convention only allowed distinctive marks to be of one or two Latin letters.

===1924 Paris Convention===
The term &quot;distinguishing mark&quot; was adopted by the 1924 International Convention Relative to Motor Traffic signed in Paris, which extended the maximum length of mark from two to three Latin letters, and permitted distinguishing marks not just for states, but also for non-sovereign territories which operated their own vehicle registration systems.


==Location==
Since the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic entered into force on 21 May 1977, in signatory countries it replaces previous road traffic conventions, including the Geneva Convention on Road Traffic, in accordance with its Article 48. According to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, the distinguishing sign of the country of registration must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle. The sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate as a white oval plate or sticker, or be incorporated in the vehicle registration plate. When the distinguishing sign is incorporated in the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle.

The requirement to display a separate distinguishing sign is not necessary within the European Economic Area, for vehicles with license plates in the common EU format, which satisfy the requirements of the Vienna Convention, and so are also valid in non-EU countries signatory to that convention. Separate signs are also not needed for Canada, Mexico and the United States, where the province, state or district of registration is usually embossed or surface-printed on the vehicle registration plate.

== Current codes ==


==Codes no longer in use==

==Unofficial codes==

There are unofficial codes in common use, such as &quot;AS&quot; for Asturias, &quot;CAT&quot; for Catalonia, &quot;SCO&quot; for Scotland, &quot;CYM&quot; for Wales (Welsh &quot;Cymru&quot;), &quot;ENG&quot; for England, &quot;BZH&quot; for Brittany (&quot;Breizh&quot;), &quot;GRD&quot; for Groland (a fictional/satirical &#x27;presipality&#x27;), &quot;FRL&quot; for Friesland, &quot;NB&quot; for North Brabant, &quot;VL&quot; for Flanders (&quot;Vlaanderen&quot;), &quot;TS&quot; for Transylvania, &quot;P&quot; for Palestine, &quot;PR&quot; for Puerto Rico, &quot;CSB&quot; for Kashubia (&quot;Cassubia&quot;) and &quot;SIC&quot; for Székely Land (from Latin &quot;Terra Siculorum&quot;). Some of these, such as &quot;VL&quot; which is used by Flemish separatists, are used despite being specifically illegal under local laws.

In addition, in some areas, vehicle-style stickers have been used to denote and promote other entities, such as towns, islands, businesses, and even associations. These irregular stickers almost always bear an explanation of the code in small print near the edge of the sticker, as the codes used may be unfamiliar.

==Diplomatic licence plate codes==
A separate system is used for vehicles belonging to the diplomats of foreign countries with license plates from the host country. That system is host country-specific and varies largely from country to country. For example, TR on a diplomatic car in the USA indicates Italy, not Turkey. Such markings in other countries (e.g. Norway) are indicated with numbers only, again different from international standards (e.g. 90 means Slovakia in Norway).

<doc id="418994" wikidata="Q27076007" url="?curid=418994" title="Wilson's warbler">
<text>Wilson&#x27;s warbler (Cardellina pusilla) is a small New World warbler. It is greenish above and yellow below, with rounded wings and a long, slim tail. The male has a black crown patch; depending on the subspecies, that mark is reduced or absent in the female. It breeds across Canada and south through the western United States, and winters from Mexico south through much of Central America. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

==Taxonomy==
Wilson&#x27;s warbler was formally described in 1811 by the ornithologist Alexander Wilson under the binomial name &quot;Muscicapa pusilla&quot;. The type locality is southern New Jersey. The species was moved to the genus &quot;Wilsonia&quot; by the naturalist and ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1838. Zoologist Thomas Nuttall moved it to &quot;Sylvania&quot; in 1840, and by 1845, many authors included it in &quot;Myiodioctes.&quot; In 1899, the American Ornithological Union returned the species to &quot;Wilsonia.&quot; The species is currently assigned to the genus &quot;Cardellina&quot;. The genus name &quot;Cardellina&quot; is a diminutive of the Italian dialect &quot;Cardella&quot;, a name for the European goldfinch, and the specific epithet &quot;pusilla&quot; means &quot;very small&quot;.

There are three recognized subspecies:
*&quot;C. p. pusilla&quot; was described by Alexander Wilson in 1811.
*&quot;C. p. pileolata&quot; was described by German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1811.
*&quot;C. p. chryseola&quot; was described by Robert Ridgway in 1902.

The &quot;chryseola&quot; subspecies, which nests in northern coastal California to southwestern coastal Canada, has a distinctive orange-tinged yellow forehead. The population of the subspecies has declined sharply in the 21st century because it migrates preferentially to the southern end of the Baja Peninsula in Mexico, where luxury resort and residential developments have replaced the bird&#x27;s habitat.

==Description==

Wilson&#x27;s warbler is a small passerine, ranging from in length, with a wingspan of and a mass of . It has a plain green-brown back and yellow underparts. The male has a small black cap. Males of the western race &quot;C. p. chryseola&quot; are greener above and brighter than males of the eastern, nominate race. Individuals from Alaska and the west-central portion of the species&#x27; range average slightly larger than those found in eastern and Pacific coastal populations. Its song is a chattering series of loud descending notes. The call is a flat &quot;chuff&quot;.

Wilson&#x27;s warbler resembles the yellow warbler: the latter is readily distinguished by its different shape, yellow wing markings, and yellow tail spots.
==Distribution and habitat==
The breeding habitat is fairly open woodland with undergrowth or shrubs and thickets in moist areas with streams, ponds, bogs, and wet clearings.
Wilson&#x27;s warbler breeds in northern Canada and the western US; it winters in overgrown clearings and coffee plantations, forest edges, deciduous forests, tropical evergreens, pine-oak forests, mangroves, thorn-scrub, riparian gallery forests, brushy fields, and mixed forests . At all seasons, it prefers secondary growth, riparian habitats, lakes, montane and boreal forests with overgrown clearcuts. It is a very rare vagrant to Western Europe.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Breeding===
Nesting generally begins in early March in west coast populations, and extends into August in the northern range. The female does the majority of the nest building. The cup nest is typically constructed of vegetation and lined with grasses and hair. It is often sunken into moss or sedges at the base of shrubs. The clutch varies from 2 to 7 eggs, which are creamy or off-white with fine reddish spots. The young are altricial. The montane populations generally have a higher clutch size and nest success rate than those on the coast. The eggs hatch at 11–15 days and the young fledge at 8–13 days; adults care for them for several weeks. Some montane populations are polygamous (one male breeds with multiple females). Wilson&#x27;s warbler is a frequent host for the brown-headed cowbird.

===Feeding===
Wilson&#x27;s warbler is an insectivore, feeding primarily on insects gleaned from leaves and twigs, or caught by flycatching. Some of these insects include beetles, bees, or caterpillars. Wilson&#x27;s warbler is an active forager, moving rapidly through shrubs, on the ground, and sometimes in taller trees during the winter. Feeding birds often twitch their tails or flick their wings nervously. The observed feeding rate of the male Wilson&#x27;s warbler was not significantly different between males with or without mates.
It also eats a few berries.

<doc id="418999" wikidata="Q1346713" url="?curid=418999" title="K. Pattabhi Jois">
<text>K. Pattabhi Jois (26 July 1915 – 18 May 2009) was an Indian yoga guru who developed and popularized the flowing style of yoga as exercise known as Ashtanga (vinyasa) yoga. In 1948, Jois established the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute in Mysore, India. Pattabhi Jois is one of a short list of Indians instrumental in establishing modern yoga as exercise in the 20th century, along with B. K. S. Iyengar, another pupil of Krishnamacharya in Mysore. Jois sexually abused some of his yoga students by touching inappropriately during adjustments. Sharath Jois has publicly apologised for his grandfather&#x27;s &quot;improper adjustments&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Krishna Pattabhi Jois was born in a Kannada Hindu family on 26 July 1915 (&quot;Guru Pūrṇimā&quot;, full moon day) in the village of Kowshika, near Hassan, Karnataka, South India. Jois&#x27;s father was an astrologer, priest, and landholder. His mother took care of the house and the nine children - five girls and four boys - of whom Pattabhi Jois was the fifth. From the age of five, he was instructed in Sanskrit and rituals by his father, which is standard training for Hindu boys. No one else in his family learned yoga.

===Education===

In 1927, at the age of 12, Jois attended a lecture and demonstration at the Jubilee Hall in Hassan, Karnataka by T. Krishnamacharya and became his student the next day. He stayed in Kowshika for two years and practiced with Krishnamacharya every day.

In 1930, Jois ran away from home to Mysore to study Sanskrit, with 2 rupees. Around the same time Krishnamacharya departed Hassan to teach elsewhere. Two years later, Jois was reunited with Krishnamacharya, who had also made his way to Mysore. During this time, the Maharaja of Mysore, Krishna Rajendra Wodeyar, had become seriously ill and it is said that Krishnamacharya had healed him, through yoga, where others had failed. The Maharaja became Krishnamacharya&#x27;s patron and established a yogaśala for him at the Jaganmohan Palace. Jois often accompanied Krishnamacharya in demonstrations, and occasionally assisted Krishnamacharya in class and taught in his absence.

Jois studied with Krishnamacharya from 1927 to 1929 in his own village, and then in Mysore from 1932 to 1953. He studied texts such as Patañjali&#x27;s &quot;Yoga Sūtra&quot;, &quot;Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā&quot;, &quot;Yoga Yajñavalkya&quot; and the &quot;Upaniṣads.&quot;

In 1924 Krishnamacharya supposedly researched an ancient text which he called the &quot;Yoga Korunta&quot;; he described this as badly damaged and with many missing portions, and claimed he had learned the text from a teacher named Rama Mohan Brahmachari on a supposed seven-year stay in the Himalayas. Jois began his studies with Krishnamacharya in 1927 and was taught what Krishnamacharya called the &quot;Yoga Korunta&quot; method. An entire system of practices including pranayama, bandhas, (core muscular and energetic locks) and drishti (visual focal points) were included along with āsanas (postures) and vinyāsas (connecting movements), defining the method that Jois went on to teach. Jois stated that he had never seen the text; its authenticity is impossible to validate as no copy has ever been seen by scholars.

A major component of Ashtanga Yoga absent from Krishnamacharya&#x27;s early teachings was Surya Namaskar, the Sun Salutation. However, Surya Namaskar already existed, and Krishnamacharya was aware of it in the 1930s, as it was being taught, as exercise rather than as yoga, in the hall next to his &quot;Yogaśala&quot; in the Mysore palace.

===Career===

The Maharaja of Mysore sometimes attended classes when Jois was assisting, and offered Jois a teaching position at the Sanskrit College in Mysore with a salary, scholarship to the college and room and board. Jois held a yoga teaching position at the Sanskrit College from 1937 to 1973, becoming &quot;vidwan&quot; (professor) in 1956, as well as being Honorary Professor of Yoga at the Government College of Indian Medicine from 1976 to 1978.

In 1948, Jois established the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute at their home in Lakshmipuram. In 1964 he built an extension in the back of the house for a yoga hall. In 1964, a Belgian named André Van Lysebeth spent two months with Jois learning the primary and intermediate series of the Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga system. Not long afterward, van Lysebeth wrote the book &quot;J&#x27;apprends le Yoga&quot; (1967, English title: &quot;Yoga Self-Taught&quot;) which mentioned Jois and included his address. This brought Westerners to Mysore to study yoga. The first Americans came, after Jois&#x27;s son Manju demonstrated yoga at Swami Gitananda&#x27;s ashram in Pondicherry. To accommodate the increasing number of students, he opened a new school in Gokulam in 2002. Jois continued to teach at the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute in Mysore, now in the neighbourhood of Gokulam, with his only daughter Saraswathi Rangaswamy (b. 1941) and his grandson Sharath for the rest of his life. He published the book &quot;Yoga Mālā&quot;, in Kannada in 1958; an English translation appeared in 1999.

His first trip to the West was in 1974, to South America, to deliver a lecture in Sanskrit at an international yoga conference. In 1975 he stayed for four months in Encinitas, California, marking the beginning of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga in America. Norman Allen, one of his first western students, collaborated with Jois on his trips to America. He had said on many occasions that there might be only twenty or thirty students practising Ashtanga Yoga in America then, but, &#x27;gradually, gradually, in twenty years, it will be fully spreading&#x27;. He returned to the US several times over the next 20 years, to teach yoga at Encinitas and beyond.

&quot;Parampara&quot;, the passing of knowledge from teacher to pupil (traditionally, from guru to &quot;shishya&quot;), is said to lie at the heart of Jois&#x27;s Ashtanga Yoga. Teachers are certified through many years of daily practice and extended trips to Mysore, India, to become authorized &quot;lineage holders&quot;. Having studied under Krishnamacharya for many years, Jois expected the same from his students, creating among the most stringent requirements anywhere in yoga teacher training.

===Family life===

On the full moon of June 1933, when Jois was 18 years old, he married Savitramma, who affectionately came to be known as Amma by Pattabhi Jois&#x27;s family and students alike. They had three children: Saraswathi, Mañju and Ramesh.

In 1948, with the help of his students, Jois purchased a home in the section of town called Lakshmipuram. According to Tim Miller, Jois continued to practice asanas until his son Ramesh committed suicide when Jois was in his early 60s.

==Re-evaluation==

===Criticisms===

According to B.K.S. Iyengar, Jois was assigned to teach asana at the Sanskrit Pathshala when Krishnamacharya&#x27;s yogaśala was opened in 1933, and was &quot;never a regular student&quot;. Jois claimed he was B. K. S. Iyengar&#x27;s teacher, although Iyengar has denied this, and the two men&#x27;s yoga systems are different; both were taught by Krishnamacharya.

The obituary in &quot;The Economist&quot; questioned Jois&#x27;s adherence to the yogic principle of ahimsa or non-violence, writing that &quot;a good number of Mr Jois&#x27;s students seemed constantly to be limping around with injured knees or backs because they had received his &quot;adjustments&quot;, yanking them into Lotus, the splits or a backbend.&quot; Adjustments by Jois have been characterized as &quot;overwhelming, producing fear and extreme discomfort in students as they are pushed beyond their physical and psychological comfort zones in often-difficult, even dangerous asana.&quot;

=== Sexual abuse ===

&quot;The Economist&quot; obituary questioned Jois&#x27;s adherence to the yogic principle of brahmacharya or sexual continence, and made the accusation that some students received different &quot;adjustments&quot;; further evidence and accusations soon emerged in 2009. In 2010, it became public knowledge that Jois had systematically sexually abused some of his female and male yoga students, both in Mysore and during his travels, until his death in 2009. Some of this was straightforward sexual abuse, some under the guise of &quot;adjustments&quot; and sometimes under the guise of &quot;welcoming&quot; and &quot;saying goodbye&quot; to students. 
The number of victims is unknown, but women and men have described their experiences of abuse, with video and photographic evidence. 
Some well known Ashtanga Yoga teachers have come forward to corroborate the accusations.

In 2019, R. Sharath Jois published an acknowledgement of his sadness over his grandfather&#x27;s conduct, apologising to the students concerned, and encouraging them to forgive his grandfather. &quot;It brings me immense pain that I also witnessed him giving improper adjustments&quot;, Sharath wrote.

===Legacy===

In the early 21st century, Jois&#x27;s grandson, R. Sharath Jois, led the Ashtanga Yoga community as director of the K. Pattabhi Jois Ashtanga Yoga Institute (KPJAYI) in Mysore. Jois&#x27;s organization Sonima often provides organizational support to Sharath&#x27;s world tours, and produces online programs that provide supplementary teaching tools for Ashtanga. Jois&#x27;s daughter, Saraswathi, and granddaughter, Sharmila, run a yoga school in Mysore and travel the world on teaching tours.

A student, David Life, co-founder of Jivamukti Yoga, has said of Jois, &quot;He was not a monk or a renunciate; he was fearless about combining the path of yogi with the path of participant. He never saw it as separate from our lives. He thought that anyone could attain to yoga if they had the desire and the enthusiasm.&quot; A 2006 film &quot;Guru&quot; was made about him by Robert Wilkins.

<doc id="419003" wikidata="Q27075904" url="?curid=419003" title="Hooded warbler">
<text>The hooded warbler (Setophaga citrina) is a New World warbler. It breeds in eastern North America across the eastern United States and into southernmost Canada (Ontario). It is migratory, wintering in Central America and the West Indies. Hooded warblers are very rare vagrants to western Europe.

Recent genetic research has suggested that the type species of &quot;Wilsonia&quot; (hooded warbler &quot;W. citrina&quot;) and of &quot;Setophaga&quot; (American redstart &quot;S. ruticilla&quot;) are closely related and should be merged into the same genus. As the name &quot;Setophaga&quot; (published in 1827) takes priority over &quot;Wilsonia&quot; (published in 1838), hooded warbler would then be transferred as &quot;Setophaga citrina&quot;. This change has been accepted by the North American Classification Committee of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union, and the IOC World Bird List. The South American Classification Committee continues to list the bird in the genus &quot;Wilsonia&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon described the hooded warbler in 1779 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; from a specimen collected in Louisiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Muscicapa citrina&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;.

The hooded warbler was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Wilsonia&quot;. A molecular phylogenetic study of the family Parulidae published in 2010 found that the hooded warbler was embedded in a clade that contained species then assigned to &quot;Dendroica&quot; as well as two of four species of &quot;Parula&quot; and the monotypic genera &quot;Catharopeza&quot; and &quot;Setophaga&quot;. To create a monophyletic genus, all members of the clade were placed in the expanded genus &quot;Setophaga&quot;, which under the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, had priority. The genus &quot;Setophaga&quot; was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1827.
The species is monotypic; no subspecies are recognised. The genus name &quot;Setophaga&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;ses&quot;, &quot;moth&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, &quot;eating&quot;, and the specific &quot;citrina&quot; is Latin for citrine.

==Description==

The hooded warbler is a small bird and mid-sized warbler, measuring in length and weighing . The hooded warbler has a wingspan of 6.9 in (17.5 cm). It has a plain olive/green-brown back and yellow underparts. Their outer rectrices have whitish vanes. Males have distinctive black hoods which surround their yellow faces; the female has an olive-green cap which does not extend to the forehead, ears, and throat. Males attain their hood at about 9–12 months of age; younger birds are essentially identical to (and easily confused with) females. The song is a series of musical notes which sound like: &quot;wheeta wheeta whee-tee-oh&quot;, for which a common mnemonic is &quot;The red, the red T-shirt&quot; or &quot;Come to the woods or you won&#x27;t see me&quot;. The call of these birds is a loud &quot;chip&quot;.

==Life history==
These birds feed on insects, which are often found in low vegetation or caught by flycatching. Hooded warblers&#x27; breeding habitats are broadleaved woodlands with dense undergrowth. These birds nest in low areas of a bush, laying three to five eggs in a cup-shaped nest. Hooded warblers are often the victims of brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird, especially where the hooded warblers&#x27; forest habitats are fragmented. In areas with protected woodlands or recovering wooded habitats, the hooded warbler population is stable and possibly increasing.

<text>Brian Hyland (born November 12, 1943) is an American pop singer and instrumentalist who was particularly successful during the early 1960s. He had a No. 1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with &quot;Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini&quot; in 1960. Other hits include &quot;Sealed with a Kiss&quot; and &quot;Gypsy Woman&quot;, which both reached No. 3. Hyland continued recording into the 1970s. AllMusic journalist Jason Ankeny said: &quot;Hyland&#x27;s puppy-love pop virtually defined the sound and sensibility of bubblegum during the pre-Beatles era.&quot; Although his status as a teen idol faded, he went on to release several country-influenced albums and had additional chart hits later in his career.

==Biography==
Hyland was born in Woodhaven, Queens, New York City. He studied guitar and clarinet as a child, and sang in his church choir. At 14, he co-founded the harmony group the Del-Fi&#x27;s, which recorded a demo but failed to secure a recording contract. Hyland was eventually signed by Kapp Records as a solo artist and released his debut single, &quot;Rosemary&quot;, in late 1959. The label employed the Brill Building songwriting duo of Lee Pockriss and Paul Vance to work with Hyland on the follow-up, &quot;Four Little Heels (The Clickety Clack Song)&quot;, which was a minor hit, and the songwriting duo continued to work with Hyland.

In August 1960, at the age of 16, Hyland scored his first and biggest hit single, &quot;Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini&quot;, written by Vance and Pockriss. It was a novelty song that reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart (No. 8 in the UK) and sold almost a million copies in the first two months of its release and over two million copies in total.
Hyland moved on to ABC-Paramount Records, where he began working with the songwriting and production team of Gary Geld and Peter Udell, and further hits followed with &quot;Let Me Belong to You&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Stop Wanting You&quot;. In 1961, aged 17, he appeared as himself on the March 6 episode of the game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. He received three votes.

His other major hit during this period was 1962&#x27;s &quot;Sealed with a Kiss&quot;, which reached No. 3 in 1962 on both the American and UK Singles Chart. Another 1962 hit was &quot;Ginny Come Lately&quot;, which reached No. 21 on the U.S. chart and No. 5 in the UK. Hyland&#x27;s 1962 Top 30 hit &quot;Warmed-Over Kisses (Leftover Love)&quot; incorporated elements of country music; he continued in that crossover vein with singles including &quot;I May Not Live to See Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid to Go Home&quot; and on the 1964 album &quot;Country Meets Folk&quot;. This approach was out of step with the changes in the pop music market brought about by British Invasion bands. Hyland&#x27;s commercial success declined, but he had further hits with &quot;The Joker Went Wild&quot; and &quot;Run, Run, Look and See&quot;, working with producer Snuff Garrett and session musicians including J. J. Cale and Leon Russell.

Hyland appeared on national television programs such as &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, and toured both internationally and around America with Dick Clark in the &quot;Caravan of Stars&quot;. The caravan was in Dallas, Texas, on the day of the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. In response to the event, Hyland wrote the song &quot;Mail Order Gun&quot;, which he recorded and eventually released on his 1970 eponymous album.
From 1963 through 1969, Hyland scored several minor hits, but none reached higher on the U.S. pop chart than No. 20 (&quot;The Joker Went Wild&quot;). An album released in 1964 featured numbers that hearkened back to the 1950s, including such hits as &quot;Pledging My Love&quot; and &quot;Moments to Remember&quot;—at a time when The Beatles and other British Invasion acts were drowning out American artists. Hyland afterward shifted into a phase of recording country and folk rock styles. Songs such as &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid to Go Home&quot; and &quot;Two Brothers&quot; had an American Civil War theme. Hyland played the harmonica on a few numbers.

Hyland attempted several departures from the norm, including the psychedelic single &quot;Get the Message&quot; (No. 91 on the U.S. pop chart) and &quot;Holiday for Clowns&quot; (No. 94), but despite their more contemporary arrangements, they failed to receive much airplay. He went on to chart just two more top 40 hits, both cover versions: &quot;Gypsy Woman&quot;, a 1961 hit for the Impressions written by Curtis Mayfield, and &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot;, a 1959 hit for Jackie Wilson. Hyland recorded both in 1970, and Del Shannon produced the tracks. &quot;Gypsy Woman&quot; reached No. 3 on the 1970 U.S. pop chart, making it the second-biggest hit of his career, selling over one million copies and being certified gold by the RIAA in January 1971. Two of his previous hits, &quot;Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini&quot; and &quot;Sealed with a Kiss&quot;, were also awarded gold discs.

In 1975, &quot;Sealed With A Kiss&quot; became a hit again in the UK (No. 7) and Hyland performed the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on July 31 of the same year. By 1977, he and his family had settled in New Orleans, and in 1979 the &quot;In a State of Bayou&quot; album, on which he had worked with Allen Toussaint, was issued by the Private Stock label.

In June 1988, Dutch singer Albert West asked Hyland to record with him some duets of Hyland&#x27;s hits: &quot;Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini&quot;, &quot;Sealed With A Kiss&quot;, and &quot;Ginny Come Lately&quot;. West had covered the last of these in 1973, scoring a huge European hit, his biggest. Their duet of &quot;Itsy Bitsy ...&quot; was released as a single and reached No. 43 on the Dutch singles chart. Hyland and West performed on TV shows in Germany and Belgium and a Dutch TV special in Aruba.

Sixty years after the release of &quot;Sealed with a Kiss&quot;, Hyland reunited with Peter Udell, who invited him to record &quot;A Little Bit of Christmas Time&quot;. It was released on Solar Music in late 2023.

==Personal life==
In 2021 Hyland married Kathalynn Turner Davis, an actress, writer, and psychotherapist. His former wife Rosmari co-wrote songs and performed with him as a back-up singer and percussionist; their son, Bodi, was their drummer. 

Hyland&#x27;s cousin Mabel Hyland was the wife of Larry Fine of The Three Stooges.

==Catalog consolidation==
From 1960 to 1977, Hyland recorded a total of eleven albums for several different record companies. A twelfth album, &quot;Young Years&quot;, was a reissue. They included Leader Records, ABC-Paramount Records, Philips Records, Dot Records and Uni Records. Over the years, these record labels were consolidated and the recordings are now controlled by Universal Music. Universal has yet to release a CD compilation that includes all of Hyland&#x27;s charted singles, invariably omitting a handful of minor singles that made the Billboard Top 100 (or the Bubbling Under chart).

*1967 – Leader Records (&quot;Itsy Bitsy ...&quot;) owner Kapp Records sold to MCA, Inc. and becomes co-owned with Uni Records (&quot;Gypsy Woman&quot;).
*1974 – Dot Records (&quot;Tragedy&quot;) sold to ABC Records (&quot;Sealed with a Kiss&quot;)
*1979 – MCA Records buys ABC Records
*1998 – MCA parent Universal Music buys Philips Records (&quot;The Joker Went Wild&quot;) owner PolyGram completing the catalog consolidation

<text>Kirk is a Scottish and former Northern English word meaning &#x27;church&#x27;. The term &quot;the Kirk&quot; is often used informally to refer specifically to the Church of Scotland, the Scottish national church that developed from the 16th-century Reformation. Many place names and personal names are derived from .

==Basic meaning and etymology==
As a common noun, &quot;kirk&quot; (meaning &#x27;church&#x27;) is found in Scots, Scottish English, Ulster-Scots and some English dialects, attested as a noun from the 14th century onwards, but as an element in placenames much earlier. Both words, &quot;kirk&quot; and &quot;church&quot;, derive from the Koine Greek κυριακόν (δωμα) (kyriakon (dōma)) meaning &quot;Lord&#x27;s (house)&quot;, which was borrowed into the Germanic languages in late antiquity, possibly in the course of the Gothic missions. (Only a connection with the idiosyncrasies of Gothic explains how a Greek neuter noun became a Germanic feminine).

Whereas &quot;church&quot; displays Old English palatalisation, &quot;kirk&quot; is a loanword from Old Norse and thus retains the original mainland Germanic consonants. Compare cognates: Icelandic &amp; Faroese &quot;kirkja&quot;; Swedish &quot;kyrka&quot; (where the first ‘k’ was later palatalized as well); Norwegian (Nynorsk) &quot;kyrkje&quot;; Danish and Norwegian (Bokmål) &quot;kirke&quot;; Dutch and Afrikaans &quot;kerk&quot;; German &quot;Kirche&quot; (reflecting palatalization before unstressed front vowel); West Frisian &quot;tsjerke&quot;; and borrowed into non-Germanic languages Estonian &quot;kirik&quot; and Finnish &quot;kirkko&quot;.

==Church of Scotland==
As a proper noun, &quot;the Kirk&quot; is an informal name for the Church of Scotland, the country&#x27;s national church and this term is frequently used in the media, in everyday speech and in the church&#x27;s own literature. &quot;The Kirk of Scotland&quot; was in official use as the name of the Church of Scotland until the 17th century. Kirk Session is still the standard term in church law for the court of elders in the local congregation, both in the Church of Scotland and in any of the other Scottish Presbyterian denominations.

==Free Kirk==
Even more commonly, &quot;The Free Kirk&quot; is heard as an informal name for the Free Church of Scotland, the remnant of an evangelical presbyterian church formed in 1843 when its founders withdrew from the Church of Scotland. See:

* Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)
* Free Church of Scotland (since 1900)

A pair of rhyming jibes remain from the time of the heated split of the Disruption in 1843, when about a third of the Auld Kirk of Scotland left to form the Free Kirk. The Free Kirkers, who had sometimes given up homes as well as church buildings and started financially from scratch, were taunted with the rhyme: “&quot;The Free Kirk, the wee Kirk, the Kirk without the steeple&quot;”. This rhyme linking the Free Kirk with the derogatory diminutive &quot;wee&quot; was offensive, and a reply was devised in: &quot;The Auld Kirk, the cauld Kirk. The Kirk wi’out the people&quot;.

==High Kirk==

&quot;High Kirk&quot; is the term sometimes used to describe a congregation of the Church of Scotland that uses a building that had been a cathedral prior to the Reformation. As the Church of Scotland is not governed by bishops, it has no cathedrals in the episcopal sense of the word. In more recent times, the traditional names have been revived, so that in many cases both forms can be heard: Glasgow Cathedral, as well as the &quot;High Kirk of Glasgow&quot;, and St. Giles&#x27; Cathedral, as well as the &quot;High Kirk of Edinburgh&quot;.
The term &quot;High Kirk&quot;, however, should be used with some caution. Several towns have a congregation known as the High Kirk that were never pre-Reformation cathedrals. Examples include:
*Dundee, where the High Kirk is not the historic Dundee Parish Church known as St Mary&#x27;s, but St David&#x27;s;
*Paisley, where there were former congregations and parishes surrounding three churches: the High Kirk (now formally Oakshaw Trinity Church, but still retaining the High Kirk name), the Middle Kirk and the Laigh Kirk, the Middle Kirk no longer existing as a religious institution and none of the three names referred to Paisley&#x27;s historic Abbey;
*Stevenston High Kirk in Ayrshire.

There is no connection between the term &#x27;High Kirk&#x27; and the term &#x27;High Church&#x27;, which is a type of Churchmanship within the Anglican Communion.

==Kirk Session==

The first court of Presbyterian polity where the Elders of a particular congregation gather as a Session or meeting to govern the spiritual and temporal affairs of the church.

==Kirking ceremonies==
The verb &quot;to kirk&quot;, meaning &#x27;to present in church&#x27;, was probably first used for the annual church services of some Scottish town councils, known as the Kirking of the Council. Since the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, the Kirking of the Parliament has become a fixed ceremony at the beginning of a session.
Historically a newly married couple would attend public worship as husband and wife for the first time at their kirking.
In Nova Scotia, Kirking of the Tartan ceremonies have become an integral part of most Scottish Festivals and Highland Games.

==Place names==

&quot;Kirk&quot; is found mainly as an element in many placenames of Scotland, England and countries of large British expatriate communities.

Scottish examples include Falkirk, Kirkwall and numerous Kirkhills and Kirktons. Examples in England are Ormskirk and Kirkby in Lancashire, and Kirkstall, Kirklees and Kirklevington in Yorkshire. Newkirk, Oklahoma state of the United States, is another example.

The element only found in place names of Anglo-Saxon origin but also in Anglo-Gaelic Southern Scottish names such as Kirkcudbright, a place around a Cudbright church. Here, the Gaelic element &quot;cil-&quot; (coming from a monk&#x27;s cell) might have been expected to go with the Gaelic form of Cuthbert. The reason appears to be that &quot;kirk&quot; was borrowed into local Galwegian, it does not seem to have been a part of spoken Gaelic in the Highlands or Ireland.

When the element appears in placenames of the former British empire, a distinction can be made between those where the element is productive ( named after a church) or transferred – from a place in Britain. Kirkland, a city in the United States, is an exception, being named after the surname of an English settler, Peter Kirk.

The element &quot;kirk&quot; is also used in anglicisations of continental European place names, originally formed from one of the continental Germanic cognates. Dunkirk (French Flanders) is a rendering of Dutch West-Flemish dialect of &quot;Duunkerke&quot; or standard Dutch form of &quot;Duinkerke&quot;.

==Personal names==
&quot;Kirk&quot; is also in use as both a surname and a male forename. For lists of these, see Kirk (surname) and Kirk (given name), and also Kirkby (disambiguation). Parallels in other languages are far rarer than with placenames, but English &quot;Church&quot; and German &quot;Kirch&quot; can also be a surname.

<text>U.S. Route 14 or U.S. Highway 14 (US 14), an east–west route, is one of the original United States Numbered Highways of 1926. It is about long. It is roughly parallel to Interstate 90 (I-90).

The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is in Chicago, Illinois. Its western terminus is the east entrance of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, with the western terminus of US 16 and the western terminus of the eastern segment of US 20.

===Wyoming===
US 14 begins at the east entrance to Yellowstone National Park, along with US 16 and the eastern segment of US 20. It travels through Shoshone National Forest to Cody, where US 14A splits off to the north. Both routes traverse the dry Bighorn Basin, followed by a steep ascent up the Bighorn Mountains and through the Bighorn National Forest, where they rejoin at Burgess Junction. The highway descends the eastern slope of the Bighorn Mountains between Burgess Junction and Dayton. US 14 briefly follows I-90 south from Ranchester to Sheridan. The highway turns east and then south to again join I-90 near Gillette. It splits off for a short time to Carlile, then rejoins I-90 which it follows to the state line.

===South Dakota===

The South Dakota section of US 14 enters the state from Wyoming concurrent with I-90. It passes through Spearfish, Sturgis, Rapid City, and Wall, before leaving I-90. US 14 then passes through Philip, Midland, Pierre, Highmore, Miller, Wolsey, Huron, De Smet, Arlington, and Brookings, then leaving the state at the Minnesota state line.

US 14A winds through the northern part of the scenic Black Hills taking travelers from Sturgis to Spearfish.
The Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Highway incorporates US 14 from De Smet in the west to Rochester, Minnesota, in the east.

US 14 and US 83 serve Pierre, one of only four state capitals not on the Interstate Highway System.

The South Dakota section of US 14 is legally defined at South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-134.

===Minnesota===

US 14 enters the state from South Dakota west of Lake Benton. It goes east through several small towns such as Balaton, Tracy, Revere, Lamberton, Sanborn, and Sleepy Eye, on a two-lane road until New Ulm, where it is briefly a divided highway. From New Ulm to Mankato, the highway lies north of the Minnesota River. Shortly before coming to the Mankato – North Mankato metropolitan area, US 14 becomes a freeway bypass, which becomes an expressway east of Mankato. This section is part of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Highway as it passes through Walnut Grove. It currently continues east south of Waseca, and, at Owatonna, it crosses I-35 at a cloverleaf interchange. It then heads east toward Rochester, with an expressway segment beginning at Minnesota State Highway 56 (MN 56) and continuing east into Rochester. Once it enters Rochester, it has a concurrency with US 52. After the concurrency, it continues through Rochester as a divided highway. After Rochester, the highway parallels I-90 until Winona, where US 14 gets picked up by US 61. The two highways run concurrently the rest of the way in Minnesota and cross the Mississippi River at La Crescent over the La Crosse West Channel Bridge.

US 14 was extended to a full, limited-access freeway from approximately west of Janesville to I-35 at Owatonna. Most of the new route is located south of the existing alignment so as to avoid overlapping I-35. The expansion was opened to traffic on August 31, 2012, creating a continuous four-lane route from North Mankato to Owatonna. The section from Waseca to Janesville has yet to be upgraded to freeway standards; it currently exists as an expressway.

The four-lane expressway was extended from North Mankato to Nicollet including a southwest bypass of Nicollet and an interchange for MN 111 in 2016.

Between Owatonna and Dodge Center, US 14 was upgraded to a freeway in 2021. The new freeway opened to traffic in late 2021.

The segment from Nicollet to New Ulm has been upgraded to a four-lane expressway including a bypass of Courtland. Construction began in 2022 and was completed in November of 2023 after a month long delay due to concrete paving delays. 


US 14 is being planned to be upgraded to a freeway between Byron and Rochester with three new interchanges planned. An interim safety project will construct two reduced conflict intersections in 2022.

The Minnesota section of US 14 is defined as part of Constitutional Route 7 and Trunk Highways 121 and 122 in the Minnesota Statutes.

===Wisconsin===
US 14 enters the state of Wisconsin along with US 61 across the Mississippi River into La Crosse. Running through rural southern Wisconsin, it then meets with US 12 outside of Madison. Following the Beltline Highway around Madison, it meets US 18 and US 151, before turning south, passing through some southern Madison suburbs, Oregon, and Evansville before approaching Janesville. Bypassing Janesville to the north, US 14 intersects US 51, as well as I-90 and I-39. It then travels southeast, past I-43, to the village square of Walworth. US 14 then turns south and exits into Illinois at Big Foot Prairie.

===Illinois===


In the state of Illinois, US 14 runs southeast from north of Harvard to Chicago via Woodstock and the northwest suburbs. Southeast of Illinois Route 47 (IL 47), US 14 has four lanes, and, at times, it is a high-speed divided highway. Continuing southeastward from just after the overpass above IL 31, US 14 passes beneath and then closely parallels the tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Harvard Subdivision. Through the northwest suburbs of Chicago, this route is commonly referred to as &quot;Northwest Highway&quot; and is a very busy thoroughfare. East of Des Plaines, US 14 becomes Dempster Street until its intersection with Waukegan Road. From here, US 14 follows Waukegan Road, Caldwell Avenue, Peterson Avenue, and Ridge Avenue to its eastern end, at the corner of Broadway and US 41 (Foster Avenue).

At an earlier point, US 14 extended south on Lake Shore Drive onto Michigan Avenue.

==History==

US 14 was originally the Black and Yellow Trail, so named as it connected Minnesota with the Black Hills and Yellowstone National Park.

In Chicago&#x27;s northwest suburbs, it is known as Northwest Highway due to its direction as well as it paralleling the old Chicago and North Western Transportation Company railroad (now Union Pacific Railroad). It was originally called the Northwest Highway from Chicago to New Ulm, Minnesota, and some street signs in New Ulm, Chicago, and towns in between still show the old designation.

From Ucross west to Sheridan, Wyoming, US 14 was initially designated U.S. Route 116 (US 116) in 1926. US 116 was extended west to Cody in 1933, absorbing the Deaver–Cody US 420. The next year, US 116 became an extension of US 14. Part of this extension, including all of US 420, is now US 14A.

<text>Ashtanga yoga (not to be confused with Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;aṣṭāṅgayoga&quot;, the eight limbs of yoga) is a style of yoga as exercise popularised by K. Pattabhi Jois during the twentieth century, often promoted as a dynamic form of medieval hatha yoga. Jois claimed to have learnt the system from his teacher Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. The style is energetic, synchronising breath with movements. The individual poses (asanas) are linked by flowing movements called vinyasas.

Jois established his Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute in 1948. The current style of teaching is called &quot;Mysore style&quot;, after the city in India where the practice was originally taught. Ashtanga yoga has given rise to various spinoff styles of power yoga.

==Approach==

Traditionally, Ashtanga yoga students memorised a sequence of asanas and practised it together without being led by a teacher. Teacher-led classes were introduced in K. Pattabhi Jois&#x27;s later years. Such classes are typically taught twice per week in place of Mysore style classes. Teachers guide the practice, adjusting and assisting with postures and leading the group of students through a series of postures all at the same time.

=== Sequences and series ===

An Ashtanga yoga practice typically begins with five repetitions of surya namaskara A and B respectively, followed by a standing sequence.
The practitioner then progresses through one of six series of postures, followed by a standard closing sequence.

The six series are:
# The primary series: &quot;Yoga chikitsa&quot;, yoga for health or yoga therapy
# The intermediate series: &quot;Nadishodhana&quot;, the nerve purifier (also called the &quot;second series&quot;) 
# The Advanced series: &quot;Sthira bhaga&quot;, centering of strength
:# Advanced A, or third series 
:# Advanced B, or fourth series 
:# Advanced C, or fifth series 
:# Advanced D, or sixth series

There were originally four series on the ashtanga vinyasa syllabus: primary, intermediate, advanced A, and advanced B. A fifth series was the &quot;Rishi series&quot;, which Pattabhi Jois said could be performed once a practitioner had mastered the preceding four series.

=== Method of instruction ===

According to Pattabhi Jois&#x27;s grandson R. Sharath Jois, practitioners should master each pose separately attempting the others that follow. However, Pattabhi Jois&#x27;s son Manju Jois disagreed; in his view, students were occasionally allowed to practice the postures in a non-linear format.

Since the beginning of the twenty-first century a new generation of ashtanga vinyasa yoga teachers have embraced Sharath&#x27;s rules, teaching in a linear style without variations. Practice typically takes place in a strict, Mysore style environment under the guidance of a Sharath-approved teacher. Workshops, detailed alignment instructions and strength-building exercises should not form part of the method, neither for the practitioner nor for the teacher. However, most teachers who claim to have been taught by Sharath do in practice employ the above methods, exercises and postures in their teaching.

== Principles ==
Ashtanga vinyasa yoga emphasizes certain key components, namely tristhana (&quot;three places of action or attention&quot;, or the more physical aspects of poses) and vinyasa (which Sharath Jois defines as a system of breathing and movement).

=== Tristhana ===

Tristhana means the three places of attention or action: breathing system (pranayama), posture (asana), and looking place (drishti). These are considered core concepts for ashtanga yoga practice, encompassing the three levels of purification: the body, nervous system, and the mind. They are supposed to be performed in conjunction with each other.

Each asana in ashtanga yoga is part of a set sequence, as described above. The stated purpose of the asanas is to increase the strength and flexibility of the body. Officially, the style is accompanied by very little alignment instruction. Breathing is ideally even and steady, in terms of the length of the inhalations and exhalations.

Drishti is the point where one focuses the eyes while practicing asana. In the ashtanga yoga method, there is a prescribed point of focus for every asana. There are nine drishtis: the nose, between the eyebrows, navel, thumb, hands, feet, up, right side and left side.

=== Vinyasa ===
Vinyasas are flowing sequences of movements that connect each asana to the next. Additionally, modern vinyasa yoga coordinates the breath with the vinyasa transition movements between the asanas.

According to Sharath Jois, the purpose of vinyasas is to purify the blood, which is supposedly otherwise heated and contaminated by the practice of asanas.

==== Breath ====
Although ashtanga yoga keeps a general principle of steady and even inhalations and exhalations, the particulars of pranayama during the asana practice are debated.

In his book &quot;Yoga Mala&quot;, Pattabhi Jois recommends remaining in each posture for five to eight breaths, or else staying in each posture for as long as possible. Breathing instructions given are to do &quot;rechaka&quot; and &quot;puraka&quot; (to exhale and inhale) as much as possible. &quot;It is sufficient, however, to breathe in and out five to eight times in each posture.&quot; In an interview regarding the length of the breath, Pattabhi Jois instructs practitioners to inhale for ten to fifteen seconds, and to exhale for ten to fifteen seconds. He goes on to clarify: &quot;[if] your breath strength is possibly ten-second inhalations and exhalations, you do ten; fifteen seconds possible, you do fifteen. One hundred possible, you perform one hundred. Five is possible, you do five&quot;. His son Manju Jois also recommends taking more breaths in difficult postures.

Various influential figures have discussed the specific process of breathing in ashtanga vinyasa yoga. Pattabhi Jois recommended breathing fully and deeply with the mouth closed, although he did not specifically term this as &quot;ujjayi breathing&quot;. However, Manju Jois does, referring to a breathing style called &quot;dirgha rechaka puraka&quot;, meaning long, deep, slow exhalations and inhalations. &quot;It should be dirgha... long, and like music. The sound is very important. You have to do the ujjayi pranayama&quot;. In late 2011, Sharath Jois stated that ujjayi breathing as such was not to be performed in the asana practice, but that asanas should be accompanied merely by deep breathing with sound. He reiterated this notion in a conference in 2013, stating: &quot;You do normal breath, inhalation and exhalation with sound. Ujjayi breath is a type of pranayama. This is just normal breath with free flow&quot;.

As far as other types of pranayama are concerned, the consensus is that they should be practised after the asanas have been mastered. Pattabhi Jois originally taught pranayama to those practicing the second series and later changed his mind, teaching pranayama after the third series.
Sharath Jois later produced a series of videos teaching alternate nostril breathing to beginners. This pranayama practice was never taught to beginners by his grandfather and it is one of the many changes Sharath has made to the ashtanga yoga method of instruction.

==== Bandhas ====

Bandhas are one of the three key elements of ashtanga vinyasa yoga, alongside breath and drishti. There are three principal bandhas which are considered internal body locks:

* Mula bandha or root lock at the pelvic floor (drawing in the perineum)
* Uddiyana bandha, drawing back the abdomen approximately two inches below the navel
* Jalandhara bandha, throat lock (achieved by lowering the chin slightly while raising the sternum).

Both Pattabhi Jois and Sharath Jois recommend practising mula and uddiyana bandha even when not practicing asanas. Pattabhi Jois explains: (translated quote) &quot;You completely exhale, apply mula bandha and after inhaling you apply uddiyana bandha. Both bandhas are very important... After bandha practice, take [your attention] to the location where they are applied and maintain that attention at all times, while walking, talking, sleeping and when walk is finished. Always you control mula bandha&quot;.

Sharath Jois says: &quot;Without bandhas, breathing will not be correct, and the asanas will give no benefit&quot;.

===Opening chant ===

Ashtanga practice is traditionally started with the following Sanskrit invocation to Patanjali:

and closes with the &quot;mangala mantra&quot; (Lokaksema):

==History==

Pattabhi Jois claimed to have learned the system of ashtanga from Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, who in turn claimed to have learned it from a supposed text called &quot;Yoga Kurunta&quot; by the otherwise unknown author Vamama Rishi. This text was imparted to Krishnamacharya in the early 1900s by his Guru, Yogeshwara Ramamohana Brahmachari. Jois insists that the text described all of the asanas and vinyasas of the sequences of the ashtanga system. However, the text is said to have been eaten by ants so it is impossible to verify his assertions. Additionally, it is unusual that the text is not mentioned as a source in either of the books by Krishnamacharya, &quot;Yoga Makaranda&quot; (1934) and &quot;Yogāsanagalu&quot; (c. 1941).

According to Manju Jois, the sequences of ashtanga yoga were created by Krishnamcharya. There is some evidence to support this in &quot;Yoga Makaranda&quot;, which lists nearly all the postures of the Pattabhi Jois primary series and several postures from the intermediate and advanced series, described with reference to vinyasa.

There is evidence that the ashtanga yoga series incorporates exercises used by Indian wrestlers and British gymnasts. Recent academic research details documentary evidence that physical journals in the early 20th century were full of the postural shapes that were very similar to Krishnamacharya&#x27;s asana system. In particular, the flowing surya namaskara, which later became the basis of Krishnamacharya&#x27;s Mysore style, was in the 1930s considered as exercise and not part of yoga; the two styles were at that time taught separately, in adjacent halls of the Mysore palace.

=== Etymology ===


Jois elided any distinction between his sequences of asanas and the eight-limbed ashtanga yoga (Sanskrit अष्टांग &quot;asht-anga&quot;, &quot;eight limbs&quot;) of Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;. The eight limbs of Patanjali&#x27;s scheme are yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. It was Jois&#x27;s belief that asana, the third limb, must be practiced first, and only after that could one master the other seven limbs. However, the name ashtanga in Jois&#x27;s usage may, as yoga scholar Mark Singleton suggests, derive from the old name of surya namaskar in the system of &quot;dand&quot; gymnastic exercises, which was named &quot;ashtang dand&quot; after one of the original postures in the sequence, ashtanga namaskara (now replaced by chaturanga dandasana), in which eight body parts all touch the ground, rather than Patanjali&#x27;s yoga.

=== Tradition ===

There has been much debate over the term &quot;traditional&quot; as applied to ashtanga yoga. The founder&#x27;s students noted that Jois freely modified the sequence to suit the practitioner. Some of the differences include the addition or subtraction of postures in the sequences, changes to the vinyasa (full and half vinyasa), and specific practice prescriptions to specific people.

Several changes to the practice have been made since its inception. Nancy Gilgoff, an early student, describes many differences in the way she was taught ashtanga to the way it is taught now. According to her experiences, some of the differences include: Pattabhi Jois originally left out seven postures in the standing sequence, but later assigned utthita hasta padangusthasana and ardha baddha padmottanasana before the intermediate series was given; utkatasana, virabhadrasana A and B, parivritta trikonasana, and parivritta parsvakonasana were not in the series at this point; and Jois did not give a vinyasa between the same poses on the different sides of the body or between variations on a pose (e.g., janu sirsasana A, B, and C were done together, followed by a vinyasa. Likewise baddha konasana, upavishta konasana and supta konasana were also grouped together without a vinyasa between them, as were ubhaya padangusthasana and urdhva mukha paschimottanasana.

According to Gilgoff, Pattabhi Jois prescribed practising twice a day, primary and intermediate series, with no vinyasa between sides in krounchasana, bharadvajasana, ardha matsyendrasana, eka pada sirsasana, parighasana, and gomukhasana in the intermediate series. Shalabhasana to parsva dhanurasana were done in a group, with a vinyasa only performed at the end. Ushtrasana through kapotasana also were done altogether. The same went for eka pada sirsasana through yoganidrasana. The closing sequence included only mudrasana, padmasana, and tolasana, until the completion of the intermediate series when the remainder of the closing sequence was assigned. Urdhva dhanurasana and &quot;drop-backs&quot; were taught after the intermediate series. Gilgoff states that the original intermediate series included vrishchikasana after karandavasana and ended with gomukhasana. She also notes that Pattabhi Jois added supta urdhva pada vajrasana as well as the seven headstands when another yogi asked for more; these eight postures were not part of the intermediate series prior to this.

==Power yoga spinoffs==
Power yoga began in the 1990s via a &quot;nearly simultaneous invention&quot; by two students of K. Pattabhi Jois and similar forms led by other yoga teachers.

Beryl Bender Birch created what &quot;Yoga Journal&quot; calls &quot;the original power yoga&quot; in 1995.

Bryan Kest, who studied ashtanga yoga under K. Pattabhi Jois, and Baron Baptiste, a Bikram yoga enthusiast, separately put their own spins on the style and provided its branding. Neither Baptiste&#x27;s power yoga nor Kest&#x27;s power yoga are synonymous with ashtanga yoga. In 1995, Pattabhi Jois wrote a letter to &quot;Yoga Journal&quot; expressing his disappointment at the association between his ashtanga yoga and the newly-coined power yoga, referring to it as &quot;ignorant bodybuilding&quot;.

== Risk of injury ==

In an article published by &quot;The Economist&quot;, it was reported that &quot;a good number of Mr Jois&#x27;s students seemed constantly to be limping around with injured knees or backs because they had received his &quot;adjustments&quot;, yanking them into Lotus, the splits, or a backbend&quot;. Tim Miller, one of Jois&#x27;s students, indicates that &quot;the adjustments were fairly ferocious&quot;. Injuries related to Jois&#x27;s ashtanga yoga have been the subject of discussion in a &quot;Huffington Post&quot; article.

In 2008, yoga researchers in Europe published a survey of practitioners of ashtanga yoga that indicated that 62 percent of respondents had suffered at least one injury that lasted longer than one month. However, the survey lacked a control group (of similar people not subject to the treatment, such as people who had practised a different form of yoga), which limited its validity.

<text>The Ventures are an American instrumental rock band formed in Tacoma, Washington, in 1958, by Don Wilson and Bob Bogle. The band, which was a quartet for most of its existence, helped to popularize the electric guitar across the world during the 1960s. While their popularity in the United States waned in the 1970s, the group remains especially revered in Japan, where they have toured regularly. The classic lineup of the band consisted of Wilson (rhythm guitar), Bogle (initially lead guitar, later bass), Nokie Edwards (initially bass, later lead guitar), and Mel Taylor (drums).

Their first wide-release single, &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; (1960), brought international fame to the group, and is often cited as one of the top songs ever recorded for guitar.
In the 1960s and early 1970s, 38 of the band&#x27;s albums charted in the US, ranking them as the 6th best album chart performer during the 1960s, and the band had 14 singles in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.
With over 100 million records sold, the Ventures are the best-selling instrumental band of all time.

The Ventures have had an enduring impact on the development of music worldwide. The band was among the first to employ and popularize fuzz and flanging guitar effects, concept albums, and twelve-string guitars in rock music. Their instrumental virtuosity, innovation, and unique sound influenced many musicians and bands, earning the group the moniker &quot;The Band that Launched a Thousand Bands&quot;.
Their recording of &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for its lasting impact,
and in 2008 the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==History==
===Formation and rise to fame===
Don Wilson and Bob Bogle first met in 1958, when Bogle was looking to buy a car from a used car dealership in Seattle owned by Wilson&#x27;s father. Finding a common interest in guitars, the two decided to play together, while Wilson joined Bogle performing masonry work. They bought two used guitars in a pawn shop for about $10 each. Initially calling themselves the Versatones, the duo played small clubs, beer bars, and private parties throughout the Pacific Northwest. Wilson played rhythm guitar, Bogle lead. When they went to register the band name, they found that it was already taken. Disappointed, they cast about for an appropriate name. Wilson&#x27;s mother suggested the name &quot;The Ventures&quot;, upon which they eventually agreed in 1959.

After watching Nokie Edwards play at a nightclub, they recruited him as bass player. Bogle owned a Chet Atkins LP, &quot;Hi-Fi in Focus&quot;, on which he heard the song &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot;. Soon, the group was in a recording studio playing the new song, with Bogle on lead, Wilson on rhythm, Edwards on bass, and Skip Moore on drums. They pressed a number of 45s, which they distributed to several record companies. Later, Skip Moore opted out of the group to work at his family&#x27;s gas station. When &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; was recorded, he also opted out of the royalties from the recording, taking $25 for the session instead. He later sued to collect royalties but failed because of his prior opt-out. &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.

Needing a permanent drummer for the group after George T. Babbitt Jr. dropped out because he was not old enough to play night clubs and bars, they hired Howie Johnson and, in the midst of a fast-paced touring schedule, recorded an album to capitalize on the success of the single. (Babbitt went on to become a 4-star general in the United States Air Force (USAF) and on March 1, 1998, he played live in uniform on drums with the band.) The lineup of Bogle, Wilson, Edwards and Johnson remained intact until September 1962, when Johnson was replaced by Mel Taylor. The group found early success with a string of singles, but quickly became leaders in the album market. The Ventures were among the pioneers of concept albums (starting with 1961&#x27;s &quot;The Colorful Ventures&quot;) where each song on several of their albums was chosen to fit a specific theme. Some of the Ventures&#x27; most popular albums at the time were a series of records of dance music. In the early 1960s &quot;golden age of hi-fi&quot;, with the novelty of stereo still in its experimental stages, the Ventures found their characteristic style of recording each instrument in either the extreme left or right channel, with little (if any) cross-over, enhancing the stereo effect to its fullest limits.

In 1963, Edwards, a talented guitarist in his own right, suggested that Bogle&#x27;s lead guitar abilities were being stretched, and that they were in essence wasting Edwards&#x27; talents by keeping him on bass. Bogle agreed, and rapidly learned the bass parts to all their tunes, allowing Edwards to take lead guitar full-time, although he had played lead previously on several tracks on their first studio sessions/albums. This move would prove vital in modernizing the band&#x27;s sound, ensuring success in an ever-changing market well into the late 1960s.

===Classic lineup===
In the fall of 1957, Johnson had been injured in an auto crash, which caused irreversible spinal damage. This forced him to play with a neckbrace at first. However, he was able to play without it shortly after joining the group. Johnson played on the first four LPs and recorded on about half of the tracks on the fifth LP (&quot;Twist with the Ventures/aka Dance!&quot;) and about half of their sixth LP (&quot;Twist With The Ventures Vol. 2/aka Dance with the Ventures&quot;). He did not like spending so much time away from his new family (his second marriage) by having to commute from Seattle to Los Angeles to record, and because of this, he left the band. Johnson continued to play locally in the Washington area with local groups until his death on May 5, 1988, at age 54.
At the time Johnson quit the Ventures, Bogle and Wilson already knew Mel Taylor, house drummer at The Palomino in North Hollywood (the venue where they would play numerous shows during their resurgence in the 1980s). Taylor was known for a hard-hitting style of drumming. The group invited him to some recording sessions, which led Taylor to become a permanent member of the Ventures. The band continued to remain a constant presence in the American music landscape during this time; between 1962 and 1967, they released 22 albums, and all but one reached the top 100 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts (13 of which reached the top 40). They experienced more moderate success in the singles market, with 6 charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Their most successful single during this time was &quot;Walk Don&#x27;t Run &#x27;64&quot; (a re-arranged surf-style version of their 1960 breakout hit), which reached #8.

During this time, the Ventures&#x27; popularity overseas began to increase significantly. In particular, the Japanese music market embraced the Ventures&#x27; music after Bogle and Wilson toured the country in 1962. By the time they returned in 1964, this time as a full band, their music became immensely popular in Japan, and were greeted by thousands of fans at the airport. Their 1965 single &quot;Diamond Head&quot; reached only #70 in the United States but was a major hit overseas, reaching #1 in the Japanese and Hong Kong markets, and becoming the first million-selling single in Japan. The Ventures were responsible for a period in Japanese music known as the &quot;eleki boom&quot;, where thousands of Japanese purchased electric guitars and many guitar-based bands started up.

===Resurgence and decline in the US===
The combination of Edwards on lead guitar, Taylor on drums, Bogle on bass and Wilson on rhythm guitar remained unchanged until Edwards left the band in 1968, to be replaced by Gerry McGee (born Gerald James McGee in Eunice, Louisiana; November 17, 1937 – October 12, 2019), son of the famous Cajun fiddle player Dennis McGee. Edwards came back in 1973 and remained with them until 1984, although he has toured and gigged with them dozens of times in the subsequent years. Edwards&#x27; replacement in 1984 was, once again, Gerry McGee. Mel Taylor left in 1972 (and was replaced by drummer Joe Barile) to pursue a solo career when the Ventures became a nostalgia act. His intentions were to concentrate on new material and the progressive side of music. He returned in 1979 and stayed with the Ventures until his death from cancer in 1996. When Mel Taylor got sick he was replaced by his son, Leon Taylor. (Original drummer Howie Johnson had died in 1988; Skip Moore, the drummer on &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; is also deceased.)

===Later years===
Their commercial fortunes in the US declined sharply in the early 1970s due to changing musical trends. In the late 1970s and into the 1980s, a resurgence of interest in surf music led to some in the punk/new wave audience rediscovering the band. The Go-Go&#x27;s wrote &quot;Surfin&#x27; And Spyin&#x27;&quot; and dedicated it to the Ventures. The Ventures recorded their own version and continue occasionally to perform the song. Their career again rejuvenated by Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s use of the Lively Ones&#x27; version of Nokie Edwards&#x27; &quot;Surf Rider&quot; and several other classic surf songs in the soundtrack of the hit movie &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. The Ventures became one of the most popular groups worldwide thanks in large part to their instrumental approach—there were no language barriers to overcome. The Ventures are still the most popular American rock group in Japan, the world&#x27;s second largest record market. One oft-quoted statistic is that the Ventures outsold the Beatles 2-to-1 in Japan. They produced dozens of albums exclusively for the Japanese and European markets, and have regularly toured Japan from the 1960s through to the present. According to a January 1966 &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; article, the Ventures had five of 1965&#x27;s top 10 singles in Japan.

===The Ventures today===
On March 10, 2008, the Ventures were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with John Fogerty as their presenter. In attendance were original members Don Wilson and Nokie Edwards, late 1960s member John Durrill, current guitarist Bob Spalding, and current drummer Leon Taylor, son of Mel Taylor who, along with Mel Taylor&#x27;s widow, Fiona, accepted on behalf of the Ventures&#x27; late drummer. Bob Bogle and Gerry McGee were unable to attend the ceremony. Fiona Taylor gave special mention to her husband&#x27;s predecessor drummers Skip Moore and Howie Johnson. The Ventures performed their biggest hits, &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; and &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, augmented on the latter by Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame musical director Paul Shaffer and his band.

Bob Bogle lived in Vancouver, Washington, for years and died there on June 14, 2009, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma; he was 75.

Nokie Edwards died on March 12, 2018, due to complications after hip surgery. He was 82.

Gerry McGee died on October 12, 2019, after having a heart attack and collapsing onstage four days earlier in Japan. He was 81.

Don Wilson continued to record with the band, but retired from touring at the end of 2015. He died of natural causes on January 22, 2022, at the age of 88.

Mel Taylor died on August 11, 1996, of cancer, at the age of 62. He was diagnosed two weeks before his death.

Despite the passing of the founding members, the Ventures continue today (2023), with Bob Spalding—the 5th Venture—on lead guitar, Ian Spalding on rhythm guitar, Luke Griffin on bass, and Leon Taylor—son of drummer Mel Taylor—on drums.

==Guitars==
During their first years (1958–1961), the Ventures played Fender guitars (a Jazzmaster, a Stratocaster and a Precision Bass) for both their live performances and their recording sessions. These instruments are prominently visible on the covers of two early albums: &quot;The Ventures&quot; and &quot;The Colorful Ventures&quot;. From 1962 to 1963 they used two Jazzmasters with a Precision Bass, shown on the album cover of &quot;Bobby Vee meets The Ventures&quot;. Then in early 1963, California guitar manufacturer Mosrite re-branded their uniquely styled, futuristic-looking Mark 1 electric guitar model for the Ventures by applying decals that stated &quot;The Ventures Model&quot; on the headstock. The band adopted these guitars (which included a bass model) and first used them on &quot;The Ventures in Space&quot; (1963), one of their most influential albums because of the unique, otherworldly guitar sounds it contained. From 1963 through 1968, a statement on their album covers announced that the Ventures used Mosrite guitars &quot;exclusively&quot; (the Ventures and designer Semie Moseley were partners in the distribution of these instruments). After the expiration of their contract with Moseley, the Ventures returned to playing mainly Fender guitars. Only rarely have they used Mosrite guitars since that contract ended.

In the mid-1990s, Fender issued a limited edition Ventures Signature Series of guitars consisting of a Jazzmaster, a Stratocaster, and a Fender Jazz Bass, all with specifications determined by the band.

Aria Guitars and Wilson Brothers Guitars have subsequently issued Ventures Signature Model instruments. The Wilson Brothers guitar, in particular, is closely modeled physically on the original Mosrite design.

==Legacy==
The Ventures enjoyed their greatest popularity and success in the US and Japan in the 1960s, but they continue to perform and record. With over 110 million albums sold worldwide, the group remains the best-selling instrumental rock group of all time. Thirty-eight Ventures albums (including a seasonal Christmas album) charted in the US, and six of fourteen chart singles made it into the Top 40, with three making it into the Top 10. Of their 38 chart albums, 34 of them occurred in the 1960s, and the Ventures rank as the 6th best pop album performer for that decade, according to &quot;Joel Whitburn&#x27;s Top Pop Albums&quot;.

Among their achievements in America, in 1963 the Ventures had five LPs in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 of the albums chart at the same time. Additionally, they released a series of instructional LPs entitled &quot;Play Guitar with the Ventures&quot; and &quot;Play Electric Bass with the Ventures&quot;. Four LPs were released in this series, the first of which reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 Album Chart—an achievement previously unheard of for an instructional LP. In a novelty achievement, the Ventures were the first act to place two different versions of the same song in the Top 10, those being &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; (#2) and &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run &#x27;64&quot; (#8).

The Ventures were among the first rock acts able to sell albums based on a style and sound without needing hit singles on the albums. These albums are also some of the earliest examples of the concept album in rock music. Many of the Ventures&#x27; albums, starting with &quot;Colorful Ventures&quot; in 1961, were organized according to a central theme.

While they predated the advent of the terms surf guitar and surf rock, and they do not consider themselves a surf rock group, they were a major building block of surf music, if not the first to play the style. &quot;Guitar Player&quot;, in an article titled &quot;20 Essential Rock Albums&quot;, cited elements of their 1960 &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; album which presaged the coming surf trend.

The theme music of the television show &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; continues to be popular. The tune was composed by Morton Stevens, who also composed numerous episode scores. The theme was recorded by the Ventures, whose version reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop chart. Because of the tempo of the music, the theme gained popularity in the UK with followers of Northern soul and was popular on dance floors in the 1970s.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; states that the Ventures &quot;served as a prototype for guitar-based rock groups.&quot;

In the mid-1960s, the group&#x27;s label Dolton Records released several instructional albums of the Ventures&#x27; music for electric guitar and bass. According to the book &quot;The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time&quot; (2015): &quot;These appear to have appeared to be among the first rock instructional albums ever released and are reputed to have been the best-selling such albums ever. In fact, one of these albums apparently was the only such instructional album ever to make the charts.&quot; &quot;Music Connection&quot;″s Harvey Kubernik describes the five &quot;Play Guitar with the Ventures&quot; albums as &quot;influential&quot;, similarly commenting that they &quot;became the only instructional albums ever to appear on the U.S. national &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.&quot;

===Special effects===
The Ventures pioneered the use of special effects on such songs as &quot;The 2000 Pound Bee&quot;, recorded in late 1962, in which lead guitarist Nokie Edwards employed a fuzz pedal. Edwards&#x27; use of &quot;fuzz tone&quot; predated the &quot;King of Fuzz Guitar&quot;, Davie Allan of The Arrows, by at least three years. In addition, Edwards was among the first to use the twelve-string guitar in rock. The 1964 &quot;The Ventures In Space&quot; album was a primer in the use of special guitar effects, and made pioneering use of &#x27;reverse-tracking&#x27;. &quot;The Ventures In Space&quot;, because of its ethereal space-like effects, was deemed an influence on the later 1960s San Francisco psychedelic generation, as well as being cited as a favorite by Keith Moon of the Who.

The band&#x27;s cover of the Tornados&#x27; &quot;Telstar&quot; (released in January 1963) featured one of the first instances of flanging on a pop record. The song &quot;Silver Bells&quot; on &quot;The Ventures&#x27; Christmas Album&quot;, released in November 1965, has one of the first recorded uses of a talk box as a musical effect, voiced by Red Rhodes.

===Influences===
The Ventures have had an influence on many musicians, both professional and amateur. Their instructional album, &quot;Play Guitar with the Ventures&quot;, was the first such record to chart on the Billboard Top LPs list, peaking at No. 96, and taught thousands of budding guitarists how to play the guitar. George Harrison stated in a &quot;Guitar Player&quot; interview that he preferred the American guitar sound of the Ventures to British contemporaries. When asked to name the most influential rock guitar solos, Joe Walsh said he would have to include the entire song &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; because it changed so many guitar players&#x27; lives. John Fogerty, during his introduction of the Ventures at their Hall of Fame induction, said that it &quot;kicked open a whole movement in rock and roll... The sound of it became &#x27;surf music&#x27; and the audacity of it empowered guitarists everywhere.&quot; Stephen Stills told Ventures guitarist Don Wilson that he learned to play on Ventures records. Jeff Baxter and Gene Simmons were early members of the Ventures Fan Club. Carl Wilson called the Ventures a major influence on his early guitar playing, stating that the Beach Boys had learned to play all of their songs by ear.

<doc id="419017" wikidata="Q2708084" url="?curid=419017" title="Zap Comix">
<text>Zap Comix is an underground comix series which was originally part of the counterculture of the late 1960s. While a few small-circulation self-published satirical comic books had been printed prior to this, &quot;Zap&quot; became the model for the &quot;comix&quot; movement that snowballed after its release. The title itself published 17 issues over a period of 46 years.

Premiering in early 1968 as a showcase for the work of Robert Crumb, &quot;Zap&quot; was unlike any comic book that had been seen before. While working on &quot;Zap&quot; #1, Crumb saw a Family Dog poster drawn by Rick Griffin which resembled a psychedelic version of a Sunday funnies page. Its surreal, other-worldly imagery inspired him to think about comics in a new way, as seen in the art style of &quot;Zap&quot; #1&#x27;s &quot;Abstract Expressionist Ultra Super Modernistic Comics&quot;. When Crumb started planning the next issue, he reached out to Griffin, asking him to contribute to Zap #2. Griffin agreed and suggested bringing fellow poster artist Victor Moscoso on board. S. Clay Wilson, Gilbert Shelton, Robert Williams, and &quot;Spain&quot; Rodriguez were also contributors to &quot;Zap&quot;. 

While the origin of the spelling &quot;comix&quot; is a subject of some dispute, it was popularized by its appearance in the title of the first issues of &quot;Zap&quot;. Design critic Steven Heller claims that the term &quot;comix&quot; (&quot;co-mix&quot;) refers to the traditional comic book style of &quot;Zap&quot;, and its mixture of dirty jokes and storylines.

== Overview ==
Labeled &quot;Fair Warning: For Adult Intellectuals Only&quot;, &quot;Zap&quot; #1 featured the publishing debut of Robert Crumb&#x27;s much-bootlegged &quot;Keep on Truckin&#x27;&quot; imagery, an early appearance of unreliable holy man Mr. Natural and his neurotic disciple Flakey Foont, and the first of innumerable self-caricatures (in which Crumb calls himself &quot;a raving lunatic&quot;, and &quot;one of the world&#x27;s last great medieval thinkers&quot;). The debut issue included the story &quot;Whiteman&quot;, which detailed the inner torment seething within the lusty, fearful heart of an outwardly upright American.

Crumb reached out to Griffin asking him to collaborate on issue #2. Griffin suggested bringing fellow poster artist Victor Moscoso on board. Crumb added S. Clay Wilson and the four of them formed the Zap collective. Gilbert Shelton joined the crew with issue #3, and Robert Williams and &quot;Spain&quot; Rodriguez joined with issue #4. This group of artists remained mostly constant throughout the history of Zap.

&quot;Zap&quot;″s new publisher the Print Mint weathered a lawsuit filed over the &quot;Zap&quot; #4, released in 1969, which featured among other things, Crumb&#x27;s depiction of incest in a middle-class family. The publishers, Don &amp; Alice Schenker, were arrested and charged with publishing pornography by the Berkeley Police Department. Previous to that, Simon Lowinsky, who had a gallery on College Avenue in Berkeley and had put up an exhibition of the Crumb&#x27;s original drawings, had been arrested on the same charge. His case came to trial first. He was acquitted after supportive testimony from Peter Selz, a prominent figure in the art world. At that point the city dropped the charges against the Print Mint. In a related case, however — also brought on by &quot;Zap&quot; #4 — the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that local communities could decide their own First Amendment standards with reference to obscenity. In the mid-1970s, sale of drug paraphernalia was outlawed in many places, and the distribution network for these comics (and the underground newspapers) dried up, leaving mail order as the only commercial outlet for underground titles.

Contributor Rick Griffin died in 1991; Paul Mavrides made his debut as a &quot;Zap&quot; contributor in issue #14 (1998). Mavrides was invited to contribute when Crumb announced that he no longer wanted to work on &quot;Zap&quot;, although Crumb never did actually quit the title.

==Publication history==
&quot;Zap&quot; #1 was published in San Francisco in early 1968. Some 3,500 copies were printed by Beat writer Charles Plymell, who arranged with publisher Don Donahue for &quot;Zap&quot; to be the first title put out under Donahue&#x27;s Apex Novelties imprint.

The contents of the first &quot;Zap&quot; were not intended to be the debut issue. Philadelphia publisher Brian Zahn (who had published earlier works of R. Crumb in his Philadelphia-based underground newspaper &quot;Yarrowstalks&quot;) had intended to publish an earlier version of the comic, but reportedly left the country with the artwork. Rather than repeat himself, Crumb drew a new assortment of strips, which replaced the missing issue.

The tagline of &quot;Zap&quot; #1, &quot;Zap Comics are Squinky Comics!!&quot; has an interesting origin. Art Spiegelman called his girlfriend of the time, Isabella Fiske, &quot;Squink&quot;, Crumb liked the word and decided to use it on the cover. Crumb himself credits Gershon Legman&#x27;s 1949 article &quot;Love and Death&quot; condemning the &quot;horror-squinky&quot; in 1940s comics.

In late 1968, shortly before &quot;Zap&quot; #3 was to be published, Crumb found Xerox copies of the missing pages from the original &quot;Zap&quot; #1, which (according to fellow &quot;Zap&quot; contributor Victor Moscoso) successfully captured the linework but not the solid blacks. After being re-inked by Crumb, those strips subsequently appeared as &quot;Zap&quot; #0. Thus &quot;Zap&quot; #0 became the third in the series (even though it was drawn before #1 in 1967), and &quot;Zap&quot; #3 the fourth.

With issue #4 (Aug. 1969), &quot;Zap&quot; moved publishers to the Print Mint, which weathered a lawsuit related to its contents. A 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling led to the collapse of the underground comix market, and after that &quot;Zap&quot; was published sporadically, with it being typical for three to five years to pass between new issues. &quot;Zap&quot; continued to be published by Print Mint through issue #9 (1978), when the company stopped publishing comics altogether.

From issue #10 (1982) onward, &quot;Zap&quot; was published by Last Gasp (which also published many reprints of earlier issues). Again, there were often long periods between issues: altogether, five issues of &quot;Zap&quot; were published (by Print Mint and Last Gasp) in the 1970s, three issues in the 1980s, and two issues in the 1990s. &quot;Zap&quot; #15 () came out in 2005, seven years after the previous issue.

Issues #13–15 all featured cameos by sex-positive feminist Susie Bright as a character within its pages (or on the cover).

A limited edition six-volume hardcover box set containing the complete &quot;Zap Comix&quot; () was published by Fantagraphics in November 2014. Besides including an oral history, portfolio, and previously unseen material, the set also included the never-before published &quot;Zap Comix&quot; #16 — the final issue in the series. &quot;Zap&quot; #16 would later be released by Fantagraphics as a stand-alone, 80-page comic in February 2016, with a few changes and additions.

==Circulation==
The first issue of &quot;Zap&quot; was sold on the streets of Haight-Ashbury out of a baby stroller pushed by Crumb&#x27;s wife Dana on the first day. In years to come, the comic&#x27;s sales would be most closely linked with alternative venues such as head shops.

Due to its unusual outside position in the comic distribution industry, a completely accurate count of &quot;Zap&quot;&#x27;s circulation cannot be known, but overall sales for the comic&#x27;s first 16 issues are in the millions.

== Jams ==
From issue #3 forward (with the exception of issue #8), every issue of the title featured a group jam by the &quot;&quot;Zap&quot; collective&quot;, where the cartoonists would pass a story around, each one contributing panels to the overall story (which was usually no more than two pages).

In addition, in June 1970, the collective did the one-page jam &quot;Science Fiction Comics&quot; along with Harvey Kurtzman, which was published in &quot;East Village Other&quot; vol. 6, #1. In 1974, between issues #7 and #8 of &quot;Zap Comix&quot;, the collective produced &quot;Zam&quot; (&quot;Zap Jam&quot;), an entire 36-page comic filled with their jams.

<text>The Romanian word lăutar (; plural: &quot;lăutari&quot;) denotes a class of musicians.

The term was adopted by members of a professional clan of Romani musicians in the late 18th century. The term is derived from &quot;lăută&quot;, the Romanian word for lute. &quot;Lăutari&quot; usually perform in bands, called taraf.

==Terminology==
&quot;Lăutar&quot;, according to the DEX (&quot;Dicționarul Explicativ al Limbii Române&quot; — &quot;The Explanatory Dictionary of the Romanian Language&quot;), is formed from &quot;lăută&quot; (meaning &quot;lute&quot;) and the agent suffix &quot;-ar&quot;, common for occupational names. Originally, the word was used only for the peasant Romanian musicians who played the &quot;lăută&quot;. A distinction should be made between the generic Romanian-language word &quot;lăutar&quot; and the Romani clan. The others were named after their instruments, too, e.g.: &quot;scripcar&quot; (scripcă player), &quot;cobzar&quot; (cobza player), and &quot;naingiu&quot; (nai/panflute player). From the 17th century, the word &quot;lăutar&quot; was used regardless of the instrument that was played.

==History==
The first mention of &quot;lăutari&quot; is from 1558 when Mircea Ciobanul &quot;(appointed ruler by the Ottomans in January 1545)&quot;, the Voivode of Wallachia, gives &quot;Ruste lăutarul&quot; (&quot;Ruste the lăutar&quot;) as a gift to the Vornic Dingă from Moldavia. In 1775 the first &quot;lăutărească&quot; guild (&quot;breaslă&quot;), was established in Wallachia.

The &quot;lăutari&quot; were both slave Roma and serfdom Romanians, but the Roma were the majority. Through time there have also been Jewish and Turkish &quot;lăutari&quot;.

Before the 19th century, Romani musicians were often employed to provide entertainment in the courts of the Princes and Boyars. In the 19th century, most of these musicians settled in rural areas where they sought new employment at weddings, funerals, and other traditional Romanian celebrations. They were called &quot;țigani vătrași&quot; and have the Romanian language as their mother language, or sometimes the Hungarian language. Only a few of them, with ancestors from the &quot;kalderash&quot; or from the &quot;ursari&quot; groups, still spoke the Romani language.

The &quot;lăutari&quot; existed mainly in the Moldova, Muntenia, Oltenia and Dobruja regions of present-day Romania. In Transylvania, traditional professional musicians didn&#x27;t exist until the 19th century. For this reason the &quot;peasant&quot; music of Transylvania remained more &quot;pure&quot;. A similar situation was in Banat. Today the Romani &quot;lăutari&quot; are also predominant in Transylvania.

As performers, &quot;lăutari&quot; are usually loosely organized into a group known as a Taraf, which often consists largely of the males of an extended family. (There are female &quot;lăutari&quot;, mostly vocalists, but they are far outnumbered by the men.) Each &quot;taraf&quot; is led by a &quot;primaș&quot;, a primary soloist.

Traditionally, the &quot;lăutari&quot; played by ear, but today more and more &quot;lăutari&quot; have musical studies and can read notes.

The &quot;lăutari&quot; consider themselves to be the elite of the Roma. For this reason the &quot;lăutari&quot; want their children to marry only other &quot;lăutari&quot;.

==Lăutărească music==
The music of the &quot;lăutari&quot; is called &quot;muzica lăutărească&quot;. There is not a single music style of the &quot;lăutari&quot;, the music style varies from region to region, the best known being that from southern Romania. The &quot;lăutărească&quot; music is complex and elaborated, with dense harmonies and refined ornamentations, and its execution requires a good technique.

The &quot;lăutari&quot; drew inspiration from all the musics they had contact with: the pastoral music of Romania, the Byzantine music played in the church, as well as foreign music, such as Turkish, Russian or Western European.

Improvisation is an important part of the &quot;lăutărească&quot; music. Each time a &quot;lăutar&quot; plays a melody he re-interprets it. For this reason the &quot;lăutărească&quot; music has been compared to Jazz music. A &quot;lăutar&quot; from the Damian Draghici band, who also played Jazz, said that the &quot;lăutărească&quot; music is &quot;a kind of Jazz&quot;.

The music of the &quot;lăutari&quot; establishes the structure of the elaborate Romanian peasant weddings, as well as providing entertainment (not only music, but magic tricks, stories, bear training, etc.) during the less eventful parts of the ritual. The &quot;lăutari&quot; also function as guides through the wedding rituals and moderate any conflicts that may arise during what can be a long, alcohol-fuelled party. Over a period of nearly 48 hours, this can be very physically strenuous.

The repertoire of the &quot;lăutari&quot; include hora, sârba, brâul (a high tempo hora), doiul, tunes with Turkish derived rhythms (geamparaua, breaza, rustemul, maneaua lăutărească, cadâneasca), doina, de ascultare (roughly &quot;song for listening&quot;, it can be considered a more complex form of doina), cântecul bătranesc, călușul, ardeleana, corăgheasca, bătuta.

In southern Romania, the &quot;lăutărească&quot; music has a rural stratum and an urban one.

Following custom almost certainly dating back at least to the Middle Ages, most &quot;lăutari&quot; rapidly spend the fees from these wedding ceremonies on extended banquets for their friends and families over the days immediately following the wedding.

==Instruments often played by &quot;lăutari&quot;==
*pan flute (called &quot;muscal&quot; then &quot;nai&quot; in Romanian) – One of the primary instruments of old &quot;lăutari&quot;, it is seldom used today.
*violin – Always popular among &quot;lăutari&quot;.
*contra violin - Wider and deeper than a violin.
*double bass – Though often present in the &quot;taraf&quot;, the bass didn&#x27;t receive much attention from the lăutari, because it didn&#x27;t allow for &quot;mărunt&quot; (virtuosic) playing.
*cobza/lăuta – An instrument similar to the lute, but probably not directly related. It is either a direct descendant of the oud, brought by Romani musicians, or it is derived from the Ukrainian kobza. Like the kobza, it has a short neck and is used primary for rhythmic accompaniment, but, like the oud, it has no frets. Today it is virtually extinct.
*cimbalom (called &quot;țambal&quot; in Romanian) – It replaced the cobza/lăuta, having more capabilities.
*accordion – Very popular in the modern &quot;lăutarească&quot; music.
*clarinet – Used especially in southern &quot;urban lăutarească music&quot;.
*tárogató (&quot;taragot&quot; in Romanian) – Used especially in Banat, though today the saxophone has largely replaced the tárogató.
*brass instruments – An Austrian influence, used especially in Moldavia.

The &quot;lăutari&quot; rarely used the blown instruments used in the peasant music, because of their limited capabilities, but there were some lăutari who used the flute (&quot;fluier&quot;) or the bagpipe (&quot;cimpoi&quot;)

Today, the &quot;lăutari&quot; also used a lot of electric, electronic, and electroacoustic instruments: various keyboards (electronic accordions included), electric and electroacoustic guitars and basses, etc.

<text>The term Navy–Culebra protests is the name given by American media to a series of protests starting in 1971 on the island of Culebra, Puerto Rico against the United States Navy for its use of the island for military exercises.

==Background==

For many years, especially the years following World War II, the U.S. Navy used the small island of Culebra, Puerto Rico, for military practice exercises, including ship-to-shore and aerial bombardment. In 1970, the islanders began a concerted and multi-pronged effort to convince the Navy and the United States government to cease this practice. In an especially important move, the mayor of Culebra, Ramón Feliciano Encarnación, traveled to Washington, D.C., in 1970 and convinced the law firm, Covington and Burling, to represent Culebra&#x27;s interests, &quot;pro bono&quot;. Throughout the ensuing five years, Richard Copaken, the young lawyer at that law firm who assumed this responsibility, sometimes aided by his colleague Tom Jones, pursued legal actions in U.S. federal courts, lobbied representatives and senators in the U.S. Congress, and publicized the ongoing struggle in national newspapers.

==Protests and demonstrations==
Popular support for terminating the bombing was also very important, and took the form of protests and demonstrations both in Culebra and the main island of Puerto Rico. One particular protest was led in 1971 by Rubén Berríos, President of the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP), an attorney in international rights, President-Honorary of the Socialist International, law professor at the University of Puerto Rico and future senator in the Puerto Rican government. The protesters entered the restricted area of Flamenco Beach, a major target area, and remained for several weeks. Berríos, along with 13 other protesters, were arrested and charged with trespassing on U.S. military property. They were sentenced to three months in a Puerto Rican prison.

==Conclusion==
These wide-ranging and well-directed efforts – legal maneuvers, congressional lobbying, public relations, and popular demonstrations – brought success. Official declarations by President Richard M. Nixon in 1974 and reiterated by President Gerald Ford in 1975, terminated all military operations in Culebra as of December 1975. 
 Although these efforts resulted in a peaceful, bombardment-free Culebra, military exercises were soon thereafter moved to the nearby island of Vieques. The military operations in Vieques were terminated in 2003 by President George W. Bush.

<doc id="419024" wikidata="Q1001150" url="?curid=419024" title="Fibrillation">
<text>Fibrillation is the rapid, irregular, and unsynchronized contraction of muscle fibers. An important occurrence is with regard to the heart.

==Cardiology==
There are two major classes of cardiac fibrillation: atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation.
* Atrial fibrillation is an irregular and uncoordinated contraction of the cardiac muscle of atria. It can be a chronic condition, usually treated with anticoagulation and sometimes with conversion to normal sinus rhythm. In this condition the normal electrical pulses coming from the sinoatrial node are overwhelmed by disorganized electrical impulses usually originating in the roots of the pulmonary veins, leading to irregular conduction of impulses to the ventricles which generate the heartbeat.
* Ventricular fibrillation is an irregular and uncoordinated contraction of the cardiac muscle of ventricles. It is a common cause of cardiac arrest and is usually fatal if not reversed by defibrillation.

Fibrillation may sometimes be used after heart surgery to stop the heart from beating while any minor leaks are stitched up.

==Musculoskeletal==
Fibrillation also occurs with individual skeletal muscle fibers. This happens when muscle fibers lose contact with their innervating axon producing a spontaneous action potential, &quot;fibrillation potential&quot; that results in the muscle fiber&#x27;s contraction. These contractions are not visible under the skin and are detectable through needle electromyography (EMG) and ultrasound. Fibrillations can occur in healthy individuals. If the fibrillations have irregular potentials, then they don&#x27;t have pathological significance. In other cases they are a major symptom in acute and severe peripheral nerve disorders, in myopathies in which muscle fibers are split or inflamed, and in lower motor neuron lesions.

They contrast with fasciculations that are &quot;visible&quot; spontaneous contractions involving &quot;small groups&quot; of muscle fibers. Fasciculations can be seen in lower motor neuron lesions as well, but they also do not necessarily denote pathology.

==Terminology==
The word &quot;fibrillation&quot; () is related to the word &quot;fibril&quot; in the sense of muscle fibrils, the proteins that make up each muscle fiber (muscle cell).

<doc id="419026" wikidata="Q2892361" url="?curid=419026" title="Bayview–Hunters Point, San Francisco">
<text>Bayview–Hunters Point (sometimes spelled Bay View or Bayview) is the San Francisco, California, neighborhood combining the Bayview and Hunters Point neighborhoods in the southeastern corner of the city. The decommissioned Hunters Point Naval Shipyard is located within its boundaries and Candlestick Park, which was demolished in 2015, was on the southern edge. Due to the southeastern location, the two neighborhoods are often merged. Bayview–Hunters Point has been labeled as San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Most Isolated Neighborhood&quot;.

Redevelopment projects for the neighborhood became the dominant issue of the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. Efforts include the Bayview Redevelopment Plan for Area B, which includes approximately 1300 acres of existing residential, commercial and industrial lands. This plan identifies seven economic activity nodes within the area. The former Navy Shipyard waterfront property is also the target of redevelopment to include residential, commercial, and recreational areas.
==Geography==
The Bayview–Hunters Point districts are located in the southeastern part of San Francisco, strung along the main artery of Third Street from India Basin to Candlestick Point. The boundaries are Cesar Chavez Boulevard to the north, U.S. Highway 101 (Bayshore Freeway) to the west, Bayview Hill to the south, and San Francisco Bay to the east. Neighborhoods within the district include Hunters Point, India Basin, Bayview, Silver Terrace, Bret Harte, Islais Creek Estuary and South Basin. The entire southern half of the neighborhood is the Candlestick Point State Recreation Area, including the site of the Candlestick Park stadium, which was demolished in 2015.

==History==

=== The Ohlone people ===
Primarily composed of tidal wetlands with some small hills, the area was inhabited by the Yelamu and Ramaytush Ohlone people prior to the arrival of Spanish missionaries in the 1700s. The district consisted of what the Ohlone people called &quot;shell mounds&quot;, which were sacred burial grounds. The Spanish called them, &quot;Costanoans&quot;, or &quot;coast dwellers&quot;. The land was later colonized in 1775 by Juan Bautista Aguirre, a ship pilot for Captain Juan Manuel de Ayala who named it La Punta Concha (English: Conch Point). Later explorers renamed it Beacon Point. For the next several decades it was used as pasture for cattle run by the Franciscan friars at Mission Dolores.

In 1839, the area was part of the Rancho Rincon de las Salinas y Potrero Viejo Mexican land grant given to José Cornelio Bernal (1796–1842). Following the California Gold Rush, Bernal sold what later became the Bayview–Hunters Point area for real estate development in 1849. Little actual development occurred but Bernal&#x27;s agents were three brothers, John, Phillip and Robert Hunter, who built their homes and dairy farm on the land (then near the present-day corner of Griffith Street and Oakdale Avenue) and who gave rise to the name Hunters Point. In 1850, Hunter began trying to sell lots in an entirely new city called &quot;South San Francisco&quot; on the peninsula that now bears his name. Physically isolated from the rest of the city by both Mission Bay and the Islais Creek estuary, the only way to get to Hunters Point aside from sailing was via the San Bruno Road, completed in 1858.

The Bayview–Hunters Point district was labelled &quot;Southern San Francisco&quot; on some maps, not to be confused with the city of South San Francisco further to the south.

; Islais Creek and &quot;Sacred Sites&quot;

The Muwekma Ohlone held and still hold Islais Creek by 3rd Street and Marin in the Bayview as one of fifty, &quot;sacred sites&quot;. Islais Creek and the adjoining bay has been heavily polluted. Of the original approximately 1500 people who inhabited the San Francisco Peninsula prior to the Portola Expedition in 1769, only one lineage is known to have survived. Their descendants form the four branches of the Ramaytush Ohlone peoples today.

===Industrial development===
After a San Francisco ordinance in 1868 banned the slaughter and processing of animals within the city proper, a group of butchers established a &quot;butchers reservation&quot; on of tidal marshland in the Bayview district. Within ten years, 18 slaughterhouses were located in the area along with their associated production facilities for tanning, fertilizer, wool and tallow. The &quot;reservation&quot; (then bounded by present-day Ingalls Street, Third Street, from Islais Creek to Bayshore) and the surrounding houses and businesses became known as Butchertown. By 1888, the city cracked down on the slaughterhouse district due to a diphtheria outbreak and a need for better sanitation. The city inspectors found under the slaughterhouses a foul smell, the decay of animal parts, and live pigs. The butcher industry declined following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake until 1971 when the final slaughterhouse closed.

From 1929 until 2006 the Bayview–Hunters Point district were home for the coal and oil-fired power plants which provided electricity to San Francisco. Smokestack effluvium and byproducts dumped in the vicinity have been cited for health and environmental problems in the neighborhood. In 1994, the San Francisco Energy Company proposed building another power plant in the neighborhood, but community activists protested and pushed to have the current facility shut down. In 2008, Pacific Gas and Electric Company demolished the Hunters Point Power Plant and began a two-year remediation project to restore the land for residential development. The area remains a hub of business along 3rd Street, represented by the Merchants of Butchertown.

===Shrimping industry===

From 1870 to the 1930s, shrimping industries developed as Chinese immigrants begin to operate most of the shrimp companies. By the 1930s, there were a dozen shrimp operations in Bayview. In 1939 when the U.S. Navy took over the land under eminent domain for the Naval Shipyard. The Health Department came in and burned the shacks and docks that once provided a small village of fishermen and their families a steady living in the abundant shrimp harvest from the San Francisco Bay.

===Shipyard===
Shipbuilding became integral to Bayview–Hunters Point in 1867 with the construction there of the first permanent drydock on the Pacific coast. The Hunters Point Dry Docks were greatly expanded by Union Iron Works and Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation and were capable of housing the largest ships that could pass through the locks of the Panama Canal. World War I increased the contracts there for building Naval vessels and, in 1940, the United States Navy purchased a section of property to develop the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. Beginning in the 1920s, a strong presence of Maltese American immigrants, along with Italian Americans, began populating the Bayview, focused on the local Catholic St. Paul of the Shipwreck Church and the Maltese American Social Club. They were a presence until the 1960s when they began moving into the suburbs.

The shipbuilding industry saw a large influx of blue collar workers into the neighborhood, many of them African Americans taking part in the Great Migration. This migration into Bayview increased substantially after World War II due to racial segregation and eviction of African Americans from homes elsewhere in the city. Between 1940 and 1950, the population of Bayview saw a fourfold increase to 51,000 residents. The Hunter&#x27;s Point shipyard at its peak employed 17,000 people. One function of HPS was the loading of components of the atomic weapon &quot;Little Boy&quot; that was eventually used on Hiroshima. &quot;Little Boy&quot; was loaded on the USS Indianapolis on July 15, 1945, and is reported to have contained half of the uranium-235 (U-235) available in the United States, valued at the time at $300 million ($4.37 billion in 2018). The USS Indianapolis left Hunters Point at 6:30 am on July 16, 1945, but was not allowed to leave San Francisco&#x27;s harbor until 8:30 am, after the first atomic weapon test &quot;Trinity&quot; (5:29 am) had been confirmed successful in the New Mexico desert. In 1947, the Hunter&#x27;s Point crane was constructed at the shipyard to repair battleships. It was the largest crane in the world at the time. The crane still looms large over the neighborhood today.

Until 1969, the Hunters Point shipyard was the site of the Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory (NRDL). The NRDL decontaminated ships exposed to atomic weapons testing and also researched the effects of radiation on materials and living organisms. This caused widespread radiological contamination and, in 1989, the base was declared a Superfund site requiring long-term clean-up. The Navy closed the shipyard and Naval base in 1994. The Base Realignment and Closure program manages various pollution remediation projects.

====Environmental impact report====

On January 10, 2010, Ohlone representatives, Ann Marie Sayers, Corrina Gould, Charlene Sul, and Carmen Sandoval, Ohlone Profiles Project, American Indian Movement West and International Indian Treaty Council penned a letter to then mayor of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom, about preserving the Ohlone historical sites at the Candlestick Point–Hunters Point shipyard stating &quot;This is an important opportunity to work together to protect these ancient historical sites, honor our ancestors and insure that development pressures do not further damage critical Ohlone Indigenous sites, the sites affected by the development are extremely significant and are believed to be burial or ceremonial sites, in addition to protecting these sites, we also want to work with the local community to protect their health, the land and the fragile Bay marine environment.&quot;

On June 12, 2014, Vice published an article on the history, environmental bigotry and radiation effects on the residents of the neighborhood.

=== Italian, Portuguese, and Maltese community development ===

Upon late 1800s settlement, there were many Italian, Maltese, and Portuguese home-builders, ranchers and truck farmers in the Bayview from 1890 to 1910. The growing population of Italian, Maltese, and Portuguese residents seemingly pushed out the early Chinese community that was located in the Bayview.

=== African-American community development ===
==== Redlining reports ====
In the 1930s, the distribution of race and income in the neighborhood was fairly even. Two redlining reports from this time characterize the residential makeup of the area as lower-income: that is, residents were either &quot;white collar&quot; workers or factory laborers who had jobs in the vicinity. While &quot;many of the inhabitants [were] from foreign extraction, no racial problem [was] presented.&quot; Poverty in the neighborhood was widely attributed to the depression. In 1937, the Home Owner&#x27;s Loan Corporation made a redlining map to determine which San Francisco neighborhoods should receive loans for mortgages and general housing investment. Two districts in the Bayview Hunters Point received the two lowest possible grades. This lack of investment made it much harder for the area to rebound from the depression, and also made it very difficult for people trying to purchase new homes in the area. In 1942, to address the housing shortage issue, the federal government built 5,500 &#x27;temporary&#x27; housing units in the area for the families of shipyard workers. As a result, Hunters Point began as one of the most integrated areas in the city. Toward the end of WWII, the San Francisco Housing Authority pushed for the hiring of an all-white police force to govern the neighborhood. Many of the officers were recruited from the segregated south. From this point onwards, racial discrimination – in terms of the environment, housing, employment, and policing – shaped the development of the Bayview Hunters Point and further contributed to its segregation from the rest of the city.

By the 1950s and 1960s, the Bayview was a predominantly African-American neighborhood that housed a movie theater along the Third Street corridor, as well as a library, a gymnasium at the time, Cub scouts through &quot;Rec and Park&quot; as well as youth baseball teams such as &quot;The Blue Diamonds&quot; of Innes [Street].

====Racial tensions====

By the 1960s, the Bayview and Hunters Point neighborhoods were populated predominantly by African-Americans and other racial minorities, and the area was isolated from the rest of San Francisco. Pollution, substandard housing, declining infrastructure, limited employment and racial discrimination were notable problems. James Baldwin documented the marginalization of the community in a 1963 documentary, &quot;Take This Hammer&quot;, stating, &quot;this is the San Francisco America pretends does not exist.&quot; On September 27, 1966, a race riot occurred at Hunters Point, sparked by the killing of a 16-year-old fleeing from a police officer. The policeman, Alvin Johnson, stated he &quot;caught [a couple of kids] red-handed with a stolen car&quot; and ordered Matthew Johnson to stop, firing several warning shots before fatally shooting Johnson. In 1967 US Senators Robert F. Kennedy, George Murphy and Joseph S. Clark visited the Western Addition and Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhoods accompanied by future mayor Willie Brown to speak to activist Ruth Williams about the inequalities occurring in the Bayview. Closure of the naval shipyard, shipbuilding facilities and de-industrialization of the district in the 1970s and 1980s increased unemployment and local poverty levels.

Building projects to revitalize the district began in earnest in the 1990s and the 2000s. As in the rest of the city, housing prices rose 342% between 1996 and 2008. Many long-time African American residents, whether they could no longer afford to live there or sought to take advantage of their homes&#x27; soaring values, left what they perceived as an unsafe neighborhood and made an exodus to the Bay Area&#x27;s outer suburbs. Once considered a historic African American district, the percentage of black people in the Bayview–Hunters Point population declined from 65 percent in 1990 to a minority in 2000. Despite the decline, the 2010 U.S. Census shows the African American population in the Bayview to be greater in number than that of any other ethnicity.

In the 2000s, the neighborhood became the focus of several redevelopment projects. The MUNI T-Third Street light-rail project was built through the neighborhood, replacing an aging bus line with several new stations, street lamps and landscaping. Lennar proposed a $2-billion project to build 10,500 homes, including rentals, and commercial spaces atop the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, and a new football stadium for the San Francisco 49ers, and a shopping complex for Candlestick Point. The stadium would reinvigorate the district, but the 49ers changed their focus to Santa Clara in 2006. Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics in San Francisco that included plans to build an Olympic Village in Bayview–Hunters Point was also dropped. Lennar proposed to build the stadium without the football team. Local community activist groups have criticized much of the redevelopment for displacing rather than benefiting existing neighborhood residents.

==Education==

The Bayview, a historically predominant black neighborhood, is home to more elementary school-age students than any other neighborhood in the city and combined with the Mission and Excelsior, houses a quarter of all students in the district. Schools in the Bayview have suffered from declining enrollment for the past two decades. Out of the 6,000 students who live in the Bayview, more than 70% choose to attend school outside of their neighborhood. In 2016, in attendance with Jonathan Garcia, Adonal Foyle and Theo Ellington, Willie L. Brown middle school in Bayview-Hunter&#x27;s Point commemorated the unveiling of the new Golden State Warrior outside basketball court at the school, donated by the Warriors Community Foundation. Bayview-Hunter&#x27;s Point has several elementary and middle schools, one high school and has two college campuses. The schools include:

In 2004 Bill Cosby visited Charles Drew Elementary School in Bayview-Hunters Point, where he railed against students and parents, criticizing them by saying &quot;they must invest in their children&#x27;s education before they wind up teenage moms, jail inmates, drug dealers—or dead.&quot; In his speech—which was a topic of debate on conservative talk radio, on cable TV networks and in African American neighborhoods—Cosby lambasted low-income blacks for spending $500 on their children&#x27;s shoes, but not spending $250 on the educational tool Hooked on Phonics. He furthered his statements by saying &quot;I am talking about these people who cry when their son is standing there in an orange suit,&quot; he said in May. &quot;Where were you when he was 2? Where were you when he was 12? Where were you when he was 18, and how come you didn&#x27;t know that he had a pistol? And where is the father? ... You can&#x27;t keep saying that God will find a way. God is tired of you.&quot; He derided African Americans for wearing saggy pants, speaking improper English and giving children names &quot;like Shaniqua, Shaligua, Mohammed and all that crap.&quot; Then-San Francisco schools chief Arlene Ackerman wrote a letter to Cosby shortly after the speech, inviting him to visit one of her three new &quot;Dream Schools&quot;, low-performing public schools overhauled to include long school days, Saturday school, mandatory student uniforms, a more rigorous curriculum and required contracts signed by parents pledging to be involved in their children&#x27;s education. 

After his visit, Cosby praised the school, but he stressed that it was parents—not just the schools themselves—who needed to step up to ensure their children beat the statistics. &quot;Parents are 99 percent,&quot; he said. &quot;School districts don&#x27;t parent. They teach.&quot;

In 2017, mentorship nonprofit Friends of the Children received a four-year $1.2 million grant from the Social Innovation Fund, which will allow the national program to expand into San Francisco&#x27;s Bayview and Hunters Point neighborhoods. Friends of the Children provides long-term mentorship opportunities for children from kindergarten through high school. After 24 years of evaluation, the program was proven to increase high school graduation rates, decrease teen pregnancy, and reduce juvenile justice involvement.

==Demographics==
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Bayview–Hunters Point (ZIP 94124) had a population of 33,996, an increase of 826 from 2000. The census data showed the single-race racial composition of Bayview–Hunters Point was 33.7% African-American, 30.7% Asian (22.1% Chinese, 3.1% Filipino, 2.9% Vietnamese, 0.4% Cambodian, 0.3% Indian, 0.2% Burmese, 0.2% Korean, 0.2% Japanese, 0.2% Pakistani, 0.1% Laotian), 12.1% White, 3.2% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (2.4% Samoan, 0.1% Tongan, 0.1% Native Hawaiian), 0.7% Native American, 15.1% other, and 5.1% mixed race. Of Bayview&#x27;s population, 24.9% was of Hispanic or Latino origin, of any race (11.5% Mexican, 4.2% Salvadoran, 2.6% Guatemalan, 1.4% Honduran, 1.4% Nicaraguan, 0.7% Puerto Rican, 0.2% Peruvian, 0.2% Spanish, 0.2% Spaniard, 0.1% Colombian, 0.1% Cuban, 0.1% Panamanian).

According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Bayview–Hunters Point had the highest percentage of African-Americans among San Francisco neighborhoods, home to 21.5% of the city&#x27;s Black population, and they were the predominant ethnic group in the Bayview. Census figures showed the percentage of African-Americans in Bayview declined from 48% in 2000 to 33.7% in 2010, while the percentage of Asian and White ethnicity increased from 24% and 10%, respectively, to 30.7% and 12.1%. However the eastern part of the neighborhood had a population of 12,308 and is still roughly 53% African-American.

According to the 2005–2009 American Community Survey (ACS), the Bayview district is estimated to have 10,540 housing units and an estimated owner-occupancy rate of 51%. The 2010 U.S. Census indicates the number of households to be 9,717, of which 155 belong to same-sex couples. Median home values were estimated in 2009 to be $586,201, but that has since fallen dramatically to around $367,000 in 2011, the lowest of any of San Francisco&#x27;s ZIP code areas. Median Household Income was estimated in 2009 at $43,155. Rent prices in the Bayview remain relatively low, by San Francisco standards, with over 50% of rents paid in 2009 at less than $750/mo.

A recent Brookings Institution report identified Hunters Point as one of five Bay Area &quot;extreme poverty&quot; neighborhoods, in which over 40% of the inhabitants live below the Federal poverty level of an income of $22,300 for a family of four. Nearly 12% of the population in the Bayview receives public assistance income, three times the national average, and more than double the state average. While the Bayview has a higher percentage of the population receiving either Social Security or retirement income than the state or national averages, the dollar amounts that these people receive is less than the averages in either the state or the nation.

==Marginalization==
Since the 1960s, the Bayview–Hunters Point community has been cited as a significant example of marginalization. In 2011, it remained &quot;one of the most economically disadvantaged areas of San Francisco&quot;. Root causes include a working class populace historically segregated to the outskirts of the city, high levels of industrial pollution, the closure of industry, and loss of infrastructure. The results have been high rates of unemployment, poverty, disease and crime. Attempts to mitigate the effects of marginalization include the city&#x27;s building of the Third Street light-rail line, establishment of the Southeast Community Facility (SECF) as a response from the SF Public Utilities Commission to a community-led effort to balance environmental injustice associated with public utilities, the Southeast Food Access Workgroup, initially formed by the SF Department of Public Health as part of the SF Mayor&#x27;s ShapeUp SF health initiative, and implementation of enhanced local hiring policy that recognizes that regulations requiring hiring for public projects prioritize City residents and contractors may not help specific neighborhoods where job seekers and contractors may still be overlooked. Place-based and asset-based community building programs networked through the Quesada Gardens Initiative began in 2002 adding direct grassroots public participation to the social and environmental change landscape with a goal of preserving diversity and encouraging longterm residents to reinvest in their neighborhood.

The Hunter&#x27;s Point shipyard&#x27;s toxic waste pollution has been cited for elevated rates of asthma and other respiratory diseases among residents. These adverse health effects coupled with rising housing costs contribute to what one community member and organizer has characterized as behavior &quot;meeting the UN standard definition of genocide&quot;.

Gang and drug activity, as well as a high murder rate, have plagued the Bayview–Hunters Point district. A 2001 feature article in the San Francisco Chronicle cited feuding between small local gangs as the major cause of the area&#x27;s unsolved homicides. In 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Bayview as &quot;one of the city&#x27;s most violent&quot; neighborhoods. Police have made the removal of guns from the streets their top priority in recent years, leading to a 20% decline in major crimes between 2010 and 2011, including declines of 35% in homicides, 22% in aggravated assaults, 38% in arson, 30% in burglary, 34% in theft, 23% in auto theft, and 39% in robbery. Lesser crimes have also declined by about 24% over the past year. As of 2018, crime rates in the area are 161% higher compared to the national average. Auto theft averaged around 10 break-ins a day as of 2020. 

===Food Desert and Food Swamp===
The USDA defines a food desert as a region without access to nutritious, affordable and quality whole foods. Food deserts are areas with a 20 percent or greater poverty rate and where a third of residents live more than a mile from a supermarket, farmers market or local grocery store. In the &quot;grocery gap&quot;, researchers from Food Trust found African Americans are 400 percent more likely to live in a community that lacks a full-service supermarket.

Until the late 2000s the neighborhood had no chain supermarkets. In 2011, a San Francisco official described the area as &quot;a food desert – an area with limited access to affordable, nutritious food like fresh produce at a full-size grocery store.&quot; A large swath of the southeast sector of San Francisco sits within a Federally recognized food desert. A Home Depot was approved by the city to be built in the area, but the Home Depot Corporation abandoned its plans following the late 2000s economic crisis. Lowe&#x27;s took over Home Depot&#x27;s plans, and in 2010 opened their first store in San Francisco on the Bayshore Blvd. site. In August 2011, UK supermarket chain Tesco, owner of Fresh and Easy stores, opened Bayview–Hunters Point&#x27;s first new grocery store in 20 years, though this store has closed as part of Fresh and Easy&#x27;s larger corporate exit from the United States.

The neighborhood was the subject of a 2003 documentary, &quot;Straight Outta Hunters Point&quot;, directed by lifelong Hunters Point resident Kevin Epps, and a 2012 sequel, &quot;Straight Outta Hunters Point 2&quot;, movies that expose the daily drama of gang-related wars plaguing a community already fighting for social and economic survival. The Spike Lee film &quot;Sucker Free City&quot; used Hunters Point as a backdrop for a story on gentrification and street gangs. In 2002, the Quesada Gardens Initiative began with two people planting flowers and vegetables where space allotted; now there are 3,500 members who volunteer. At last count, Quesada Gardens Initiative produced 10,000 pounds of fruits and vegetables in a year. The transformation has also been slow but steady.

In 2011 Hunters Point was labelled as one of the United States&#x27; top 9 worst food deserts; in that same year the Bayview District welcomed Fresh &amp; Easy, an upstart grocery chain owned by British food giant Tesco. The Bayview location delivered weak sales, but it was hardly alone: Tesco sold most of the stores and closed the rest in 2013, and the chain soon disappeared into bankruptcy. The store sat empty for a few years while former Supervisor Malia Cohen worked with former mayor Mayor Ed Lee and the Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD) on finding a new owner. They landed on Howard and Amanda Ngo. With a $250,000 investment from OEWD and $4.1 million from the Small Business Administration, the couple hosted the grand opening for their second Duc Loi&#x27;s Pantry at 5800 Third Street in 2016. But the store closed in 2019 due to a range of factors.

In October 2021 it was made public that a first-of-its-kind &quot;food empowerment market&quot; would be placed in at Third and McKinnon where the former Doc Loi Pantry and Fresh &amp; Easy grocery store had been. The idea is a community market that would distribute donated or subsidized food—but unlike a food bank, eligible shoppers would be able to pick and choose their own groceries and either pay for the goods at a subsidized price or obtain them for free. The market would also host an on-site community kitchen focusing on culinary education and offer free delivery service for seniors and those with mobility issues. &quot;The Food Empowerment Market&quot; idea stems from legislation introduced by District 11 Supervisor Ahsha Safai that allocates $1.5 million in startup funds from the Human Service Agency to establish the model for the new market in partnership with a yet-to-be-named neighborhood nonprofit. Bayview-Hunters Pointhas the highest rates of obesity in San Francisco with less than five percent of food sold in the neighborhood consisting of fresh produce. The neighborhood also has the most residents (mainly seniors) facing food insecurity than anywhere else in the city, according to a report from the San Francisco Department of Public Health.

District 10 supervisor Shamann Walton supports the idea, stating it would provide residents with unprecedented healthy choices, and that he&#x27;s hopeful The City will get behind any deal struck between the current owners of the vacant space and the Human Services Agency. This project would really focus on seniors and families as well, Latino and Black seniors are twice as likely to be food insecure in San Francisco, according to The City&#x27;s COVID-19 Command Center report. Many of them live in Bayview-Hunters Point and historically have low rates of enrollment in distribution and food delivery programs, making them hard to reach. Families experience the risks of living in a food desert early and intensely. Nearly 27% of pregnant Latina mothers and 20% of Black mothers in San Francisco do not know where their next healthy meal is coming from. Children from those same families are also the most likely to consume fast food than their white peers. Any and all efforts to combat food insecurity should focus on seniors and families, two groups especially vulnerable to food insecurity, advocates and officials say. Doing so does not just make for healthier communities, it starts down the path toward ensuring equity in opportunity and access for all residents.

===Community activism===
In April 1968, baseball icon, hall-of-fame inductee, and San Francisco Giants legend Willie Mays and Osceola Washington campaigned for &quot;Blacks and Whites Together Fund Drive for Youth Activities this Summer. Bayview-Hunters Point Neighborhood Community Center.&quot;

A number of community groups, such as the India Basin Neighborhood Association, the Quesada Gardens Initiative, Literacy for Environmental Justice, the Bayview Merchants&#x27; Association, the Bayview Footprints Collaboration of Community-Building Groups, and Greenaction for Health and Environmental Justice work with community members, other organizations and citywide agencies to strengthen, improve, and fight for the protection of this diverse part of San Francisco.

Community gardening, art, and social history are popular in the area. The Quesada Gardens Initiative is a well recognized organization that has created a cluster of 35 community and backyard gardens in the heart of the neighborhood, including the original Quesada Garden on the 1700 block of Quesada Ave., the Founders&#x27; Garden, Bridgeview Teaching and Learning Garden (which won the 2011 Neighborhood Empowerment Network&#x27;s &quot;Best Green Community Project Award&quot;, Krispy Korners, the Latona Community Garden, and the new Palou Community Garden. Major public art pieces honor unique hyper-local history, grassroots involvement, and the right of communities to define themselves.

===Redevelopment===

==== Linda Brooks-Burton Library ====

The original Anna E. Waden Bayview Branch Library was opened as a storefront facility in 1927. It was the 13th branch in the San Francisco Public Library system, replacing a &quot;library station&quot; that had been established in 1921. In 1969, a red brick building was built on the corner of 3rd Street and Revere Avenue in the Bayview-Hunters Point district with a bequest from Anna E. Waden, a clerical employee of the City of San Francisco. Miss Waden&#x27;s gift of $185,700 paid for the development of this cooperative community project. The building was completed in February 1969, and the formal dedication took place on July 12, 1969. The architect was John S. Bolles &amp; Associates and the contractor was Nibbi Brothers. The façade included a sculpture by Jacques Overhoff. Linda Brooks-Burton, born and raised in the Bayview, was the managing librarian at the Bayview branch for 15 years before promotion to district manager. She worked for the S.F. Public Library for 30 years total. Brooks-Burton was the driving force and central champion behind the new branch library building project. At the branch library, she co-founded the African American History Preservation Project in 2007 to create digital archives about a vanishing piece of local history, as well as collect and record information about the migration of blacks to jobs at the Hunters Point Shipyard and the culture that developed in the area. Brooks-Burton co-founded the Bayview Footprints Network of Community Building Groups in 2008. Bayview Footprints brought together dozens of community groups that tell the story of the Bayview online. Officials with the library system said Brooks-Burton was an advocate for education, youth and families. She served on the Bayview community boards of Whitney Young Child Development Center (now FACES SF) and Healing Arts Youth Center and all six branches in the South East. Brooks-Burton passed away September 19, 2013, from a sudden heart attack and some residents had been calling for the branch to be named after her following her death. Library officials said Brooks-Burton was a &quot;tireless community champion&quot; and officials called her the quiet champion behind the effort to build a new branch library in the Bayview. The new Anna E. Waden Library was completed in 2013 on the site of the previous building; it was renamed in honor of Linda Brooks-Burton in 2015. The building cladding is also inspired by African textile designs. In the building&#x27;s outside atrium are west African Adinkra symbols.

====Redevelopment of Hunters Point Naval Shipyard and environmental racism====
In 2016, Tetra Tech, the firm in charge of overseeing the cleanup of toxic material on the naval base, was charged with negligence. In response, the Navy was forced to momentarily cease transferring shipyard land to Lennar for redevelopment. Hunters Point Naval Shipyard was a redevelopment project being spearheaded by Lennar on the 702 acres at Candlestick Point and the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. The plan called for 10,500 residential units, a new stadium to replace Candlestick Park, of commercial and retail space, an 8,000- to arena; artists&#x27; village and 336 acres of waterfront park and recreational area. The developers said the project would contribute up to 12,000 permanent jobs and 13,000 induced jobs.

The approval process required developers to address concerns of area residents and San Francisco government officials. Criticism of the project focused on the large-scale toxic clean-up of the industrial superfund site, environmental impact of waterfront construction, displacement of an impoverished neighborhood populace and a required build-up to solve transportation needs.

In July 2010, Lennar received initial approval of an Environmental Impact Report from San Francisco supervisors. In September 2011, the court denied the transfer of property to Lennar prior to clean-up of contamination. Per a letter sent from the EPA to the Navy, the process was placed on hold until &quot;the actual potential public exposure to radioactive material at and near&quot; the shipyard can be &quot;clarified&quot;.

====&quot;I am Bayview&quot; campaign====
Partnered with the office of Supervisor of District 10 Malia Cohen and Bayview Underground, &quot;I am Bayview&quot; helmed by creative George McCalman and photographer Jason Madara created a series of images of photographed community members to visually communicate gentrification. George states that if &quot;one is going to move into a neighborhood, you should get to know the people who live there, not simply displace an existing community. Gentrification is a hot button issue in San Francisco. This was our visual response. Twenty-nine posters are now installed along the 3rd Street corridor of the Dogpatch and Bayview, capturing the Bayview residents who represent their neighborhood proudly.&quot;

&quot;I am Bayview&quot; has also been subject to criticism as some Bayview- and San Franciscan-born people felt it promoted the gentrification of the neighborhood.

====Pan-African flags====
In 2017, Supervisor Malia Cohen and the city of San Francisco &quot;tagged&quot; Third Street poles with red, black and green stripes in honor of Black History Month and to honor Black residents&#x27; heritage in Bayview–Hunters Point. Cohen issued a statement explaining the reasoning behind the painting: &quot;The intention of painting the flagpoles is to create a unifying cultural marker for the Bayview, in the same vein as the Italian flags painted on poles in North Beach, the designation of Calle 24 in the Mission and the bilingual street signs and gates upon entering Chinatown. This is about branding the Bayview neighborhood to honor and pay respect to the decades of contributions that African-Americans have made to the southeast neighborhood and to the city. It&#x27;s also beautification for the streetscape.&quot; Many neighbors were pleased to see the tribute to African-Americans&#x27; community legacy. Several early risers in the community took photos of the poles being painted, expressing their gratitude to Cohen.

== Healthcare ==
Bayview-based birth business, SisterWeb founded by Marna Armstead provides support resources for a wide range of maternal support for individuals before and after birth. They also provide mothers with information and support throughout pregnancy and childbirth as well as advocate for mothers&#x27; needs to practitioners. SisterWeb&#x27;s clients typically begin working with doulas by early in the third trimester of pregnancy through the first six weeks after birth. Former San Francisco Supervisor Malia Cohen, who represented the Bayview, was researching health disparities in birth outcomes for black women after conversations she had with her younger sister and one of her legislative aides, both of whom were pregnant at the time.

Cohen&#x27;s research led her to SisterWeb, which aims to train black, Pacific Islander and Spanish-speaking doulas before matching them with women in their respective communities in San Francisco.

==Arts and technology==


The Bayview has also been a quiet hub for the arts since 1957 and technology going back as far as 1984. Acts such as Ike and Tina Turner performed at the former &quot;Club Long Island&quot; located on what is now Third &amp; McKinnon.

=== METRAe BaHu ===

Operating from 1987 to 1998, BaHu Gallery was a free-space, non-commercial art gallery and installation location in Bayview-Hunters Point (BaHu). BaHu was the second location for the exhibition spaces sponsored by METRAe, originally located in SOMA. The first METRAe show in 1984 featured beat poet Jack Micheline in a below ground, basement workshop. During the METRAe BaHu period, dozens of artists were provided display areas, receptions open to the public, etc. An inaugural show with multi-media artist S. Scott Davis III was curated by artist Dewey Crumpler, whose own work can be seen on the exterior of the Joe Lee Gym in Bayview Town Center. Over the 10-year period, participating artists included: Rene Yung, Susan Hersey, Tony Calkins, William Pattengill, Topher Delany, Jessica Bodner, Jack Freeman, and many others.

=== Sculptures in Bayview ===

In the Bayview, there are eighteen recorded eighteen sculptures across the neighborhood. They are:

* Invocation by Pepe Ozan
* SRL by Survival Research Laboratory 
* Ship Shape-Shifting Time by Nobuho Nagasawa
* Copra Cane
* Islais Sculpture by Cliff Garten

=== Murals in Bayview ===

In the 1980s an artist named Brooke Fancher&#x27;s mural titled &quot;Tazuri Watu&quot; was commissioned and completed in 1987, &quot;Tazuri Watu&quot; has covered the side of a building located at the intersection of 3rd and Palou for three decades. Over time, the historical work of art had faded, and vandals have defaced portions of it. Earl Shaddix, executive director of Economic Development on Third, called for its restoration. Shaddix applied for a $25,000 grant from the city through the District 10 Participatory Budgeting program, spearheaded by former Supervisor Malia Cohen&#x27;s office. The program allows residents of a few districts in San Francisco to vote on funding one-time neighborhood improvement projects. After a successful campaign, the city awarded the money in 2018, and planning for the restoration began.

The city commissioned a Malcolm X mural on the Kirkwood Star Market, painted by artist Refa-1 in 1997 and the murals painted on Joseph Lee Recreational Center by artist Dewey Crumpler titled &quot;The Fire Next Time&quot; (presumably after the James Baldwin book of the same name) in 1984 of Harriet Tubman, Paul Robeson, two Senufo birds which in African culture oversee the lives and creativity of the community, King Tut, Muhammed Ali, Willie Mays, Wilma Rudolph and Arthur Ashe.

On Egbert Street, painted by Korean artist Chris &quot;Royal Dog&quot; Chanyang Shim in 2016, a mural features a young African-American girl in a traditional Korean hanbok robe with Korean characters above her head translate to the phrase &quot;You will be a blessing.&quot; Other artists that contributed to the 9 murals alone Egbert St are Cameron Moberg, Ricky Watts, Dan Pan, Strider, Annie, Vanessa Agana Espinoza, Mel Waters, William Holland crowned &quot;The Mayor of Egbert&quot; by the community.

The murals were revealed during Imprint City&#x27;s &quot;block party&quot; and was mostly commissioned with private funds, but public funds were secured by the California Arts Council. On April 21, 2021, Afatasi the Artist, Tanya Herrera and four other artists designed a group of the new murals that line Evans Avenue and Hunters Point Boulevard viewed only in the pedestrian lane in Bayview-Hunters Point.

Along the Third Street corridor, there are many more murals including:


=== Multimedia and technology ===

==Post offices==
The Bayview currently has two major USPS offices, the second-largest branch (next to Napoleon Street) located on Evans Street, and a smaller branch on Williams Street.

The USPS in 2011 told Bayview postal employees, community leaders, and local politicians that the closure of Bayview&#x27;s Williams location was &quot;not in the plans&quot; and &quot;off the table&quot;. Months later, all Bayview postal customers were mailed official notifications of an impending closure. This stirred up controversy in the immediate community, sparking frustrations and outrage. From residents to politicians, many cited racial and social bias as the reasoning for the closure of the location. Residents were encouraged to use their voices and call local the local postmaster.

In 2012 postmaster Raj Sanghera announced that the Bayview Williams location was taken off the closure list, with other branches as well located in Visitacion Valley, Civic Center, McLaren Station, and San Bruno Avenue.

During the COVID pandemic in 2020, after calling for a #DontMessWithUSPS Day of Action and nearing the November 2020 elections, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi showed up at the Bayview Post Office in San Francisco on Williams Street to discuss her new bill funding the USPS and blocking the Trump administration&#x27;s overhaul of it. She also had won concessions on mail delivery. Pelosi accompanied with District 10 supervisor, Shamann Walton exclaimed that the Trump administration had been trying to &quot;tamper&quot; with the mail-in ballots by closing several post offices across the country. Other speakers at the Bayview event included letter carriers, someone whose mailbox had been removed, and a veteran with epilepsy who depends on the postal service for medication.

The transportation system enables trips that are minutes to/from downtown being 1/2 mile from Hwy 101 and Interstate 280, and 1.5 miles from Dogpatch and UCSF-Mission Bay. The neighborhood is also 15 min way from SFO. Opening in 2007, the T-Third Street line, a line extension of the Muni Metro system, linked Bayview-Hunters Point to downtown San Francisco.
