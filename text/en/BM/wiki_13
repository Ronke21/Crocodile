<text>Georgia has rich and still vibrant traditional music, primarily known for arguably the earliest polyphonic tradition of the Christian world. Situated on the border of Europe and Asia, Georgia is also the home of a variety of urban singing styles with a mixture of native polyphony, Middle Eastern monophony and late European harmonic languages. Georgian performers are well represented in the world&#x27;s leading opera troupes and concert stages.

== Folk music ==
The folk music of Georgia consists of at least fifteen regional styles, known in Georgian musicology and ethnomusicology as &quot;musical dialects&quot;. According to Edisher Garaqanidze, there are sixteen regional styles in Georgia. These sixteen regions are traditionally grouped into two, eastern and western Georgian groups.

The Eastern Georgian group of musical dialects consists of the two biggest regions of Georgia, Kartli and Kakheti (Garakanidze united them as &quot;Kartli-Kakheti&quot;); several smaller north-east Georgian mountain regions, Khevsureti, Pshavi, Tusheti, Khevi, Mtiuleti, Gudamakari; and a southern Georgian region, Meskheti. Table songs from Kakheti in eastern Georgia usually feature a long drone bass with two soloists singing the top two parts. Perhaps the best-known example of music in Kakhetian style is the patriotic &quot;Chakrulo&quot;, which was chosen to accompany the &quot;Voyager&quot; spacecraft in 1977. Known performers from the north-eastern region Khevsureti are the singers Dato Kenchiashvili and Teona Qumsiashvili (-2012).

The Western Georgian group of musical dialects consists of the central region of western Georgia, Imereti; three mountainous regions, Svaneti, Racha and Lechkhumi; and three Black Sea coastal regions, Samegrelo, Guria, and Achara. Georgian regional styles of music are sometimes also grouped into mountain and plain groups. Different scholars (Arakishvili, Chkhikvadze, Maisuradze) distinguish musical dialects differently, for example, some do not distinguish Gudamakari and Lechkhumi as separate dialects, and some consider Kartli and Kakheti to be separate dialects. Two more regions, Saingilo (in the territory of Azerbaijan) and Lazeti (in the territory of Turkey) are sometimes also included in the characteristics of Georgian traditional music.

===Traditional vocal polyphony===
Georgian folk music is predominantly vocal and is widely known for its rich traditions of vocal polyphony. It is widely accepted in contemporary musicology that polyphony in Georgian music predates the introduction of Christianity in Georgia (beginning of the 4th century AD). All regional styles of Georgian music have traditions of vocal a cappella polyphony, although in the most southern regions (Meskheti and Lazeti) only historical sources provide the information about the presence of vocal polyphony before the 20th century.

Vocal polyphony based on ostinato formulas and rhythmic drone are widely distributed in all Georgian regional styles. Apart from these common techniques, there are also other, more complex forms of polyphony: pedal drone polyphony in Eastern Georgia, particularly in Kartli and Kakheti table songs (two highly embellished melodic lines develop rhythmically free on the background of pedal drone), and contrapuntal polyphony in Achara, Imereti, Samegrelo, and particularly in Guria (three and four part polyphony with highly individualized melodic lines in each part and the use of several polyphonic techniques). Western Georgian contrapuntal polyphony features the local variety of the yodel, known as krimanchuli.

Both east and west Georgian polyphony is based on wide use of sharp dissonant harmonies (seconds, fourths, sevenths, ninths). Because of the wide use of the specific chord consisting of the fourth and a second on top of the fourth (C-F-G), the founder of Georgian ethnomusicology, Dimitri Arakishvili called this chord the &quot;Georgian Triad&quot;. Georgian music is also known for colorful modulations and unusual key changes.

Georgian polyphonic singing was among the first on the list of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2001. Georgian polyphonic singing was relisted on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008. It was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia registry in 2011.

===Scales and tuning system===

There are different, sometimes conflicting views on the nature of Georgian scales. The most prevalent is the view expressed by Vladimer Gogotishvili, who suggested distinguishing diatonic scales based on a system of perfect fourths and those based on a system of perfect fifths. A system based on perfect fourths is mostly present in Eastern Georgia, but scales based on perfect fifths are spread wider, both in eastern and particularly western Georgia, as well as in Georgian Christian chants. In East Georgian table songs the scale system is based on a combination of the systems of fourth and fifth diatonic scales. In such songs the principle of the fourth diatonic scale is working above the pedal drone, and the system of the fifth diatonic is working under the pedal drone. Because of the peculiarity of the scale system based on perfect fifths, there is often an augmented octave in Georgian songs and church-songs. As in many traditional musical systems, tuning of Georgian scales is not based on the Western classical equally tempered 12-tone tuning system. The fifth is usually perfect, but the second, third and fourth are different from Classical intervals, producing a slightly compressed (compared to most European music) major second, a neutral third, and a slightly stretched fourth. Likewise, between the fifth and the octave come two evenly spaced notes, producing a slightly compressed major sixth and a stretched minor seventh.

Because of the strong influence of Western European music, present-day performers of Georgian folk music often employ Western tuning, bringing the seconds, fourths, sixths, and sevenths, and sometimes the thirds as well, closer to the standard equally tempered scale. This process started from the very first professional choir, organized in Georgia in 1886 (so called &quot;Agniahsvili choro&quot;). From the 1980s some ensembles (most notably the Georgian ensembles &quot;Mtiebi&quot; and &quot;Anchiskhati&quot;, and the American ensemble Kavkasia) have tried to re-introduce the original non-tempered traditional tuning system. In some regions (most notably in Svaneti) some traditional singers still sing in the old, non-tempered tuning system.

===Social setting===
Singing is mostly a community activity in Georgia, and during big celebrations (for example, weddings) all the community is expected to participate in singing. Traditionally, top melodic parts are performed by individual singers, but the bass can have dozens or even hundreds of singers. There are also songs (usually more complex) that require a very small number of performers. Out of them the tradition of &quot;trio&quot; (three singers only) is very popular in western Georgia, particularly in Guria.

Georgian folk songs are often centered around banquet-like feasts called &quot;supra&quot;, where songs and toasts to God, peace, motherland, long life, love, friendship and other topics are proposed. Traditional feast songs include &quot;Zamtari&quot; (&quot;Winter&quot;), which is about the transient nature of life and is sung to commemorate ancestors, and a great number of &quot;Mravalzhamier&quot; songs. As many traditional activities greatly changed their nature (for example, working processes), the traditional feast became the harbor for many different genres of music. Work songs are widespread in all regions. The orovela, for example is a specific solo work song found in eastern Georgia only. The extremely complex three and four part working song naduri is characteristic of western Georgia. There are a great number of healing songs, funerary ritual songs, wedding songs, love songs, dance songs, lullabies, traveling songs. Many archaic songs are connected to round dances.

Contemporary Georgian stage choirs are generally male, though some female groups also exist; mixed-gender choirs are rare, but also exist. (An example of the latter is the Zedashe ensemble, based in Sighnaghi, Kakheti.) At the same time, in village ensembles mixed participation is more common, and according to Zakaria Paliashvili, in the most isolated region of Georgia, Upper Svaneti, mixed performance of folk songs were a common practice.

===Performance practices===

Georgian vocal polyphony was maintained for millennia by village singers, mostly local farmers. From the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century a great number of gramophone recordings of Georgian village singers were made. Anzor Erkomaishvili was paramount in recovering these recordings and re-issuing them on a series of CDs. Despite the poor technical quality of the old recordings, they often serve as the model of high mastery of the performance of Georgian traditional songs for contemporary ensembles.

During the Soviet period (1921–1991), folk music was highly praised, and revered folk musicians were awarded with governmental prizes and were given salaries. At the same time some genres were forbidden (particularly Christian church-songs), and the tendency to create huge regional choirs with big groups singing each melodic part damaged the improvisatory nature of Georgian folk music. Also, singing and dancing, usually closely interconnected in rural life, were separated on a concert stage. From the 1950s and the 1960s new type of ensembles (Shvidkatsa, Gordela) brought back the tradition of smaller ensembles and improvisation.

Since the 1970s, Georgian folk music has been introduced to a wider audience in different countries around the world. The ensembles Rustavi and later Georgian Voices were particularly active in presenting rich polyphony of various regions of Georgia to western audiences. Georgian Voices performed alongside Billy Joel, and the Rustavi Choir was featured on the soundtrack to Coen Brothers&#x27; 1998 film, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. During the end of the 1960s and 1970s an innovative pop-ensemble featured a mixture of traditional polyphony with jazz and other popular musical genres, becoming arguably the most popular ensemble of the Soviet Union in the 1970s. This line of fusion of Georgian folk polyphony with other genres became popular in the 1990s, and the Stuttgart-based ensemble The Shin became a popular representative of this generation of Georgian musicians.

By the mid-1980s, the first ensembles of Georgian music consisting of non-Georgian performers had started to appear outside of Georgia (first in USA and Canada, later in other European countries). This process became particularly active after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when the Iron Curtain disappeared and travel to the Western countries became possible for Georgians. Today it is a common practice for Georgian ensembles and traditional singers to visit Western countries for performances and workshops.

===Study of Georgian folk music===

The 1861 article by Jambakur-Orbeliani and the 1864 article by Machabeli are considered as the first published works where some aspect of Georgian folk music were discussed. Earlier works (like the 18th century &quot;Dictionary of Georgian Language&quot; by Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani, and &quot;Kalmasoba&quot; by Ioane Bagrationi) discussed Georgian church singing traditions only.

Dimitri Arakishvili and Zakaria Paliashvili are considered the most influential figures of study of Georgian folk music. Arakishvili published several standard books and articles on Georgian singing traditions, musical instruments, scales, and is widely considered as &quot;founding father&quot; of Georgian ethnomusicology.

Grigol Chkhikvadze and Shalva Aslanishvili, born during the last years of the 19th century, received professional education in Russia and became important figures of the study of Georgian traditional music. The historian Ivane Javakhishvili published an influential work on the history of Georgian music, which is still considered as the most comprehensive work on historical sources on Georgian music. Otar Chijavadze, Valerian Magradze, Kakhi Rosebashvili, Mindia Jordania, Kukuri Chokhonelidze were the first Georgian scholars that were educated in Georgia and contributed to the study of different aspect of Georgian folk music. From the end of the 20th century a new generation of Georgian ethnomusicologists appeared, among them Edisher Garakanidze, Joseph Jordania, Nato Zumbadze, Nino Tsitsishvili, Tamaz Gabisonia, Nino Makharadze, David Shugliashvili, Maka Khardziani.

Apart from Georgian scholars, non-Georgian musicians and scholars also contributed to the study of Georgian traditional music. Among them were German and Austrian scholars Adolf Dirr, Robert Lach, Georg Schunemann, and Siegfried Nadel, who were able to record and study traditional songs from Georgian war prisoners during the first World War. Siegfried Nadel published a monograph about Georgian music, where he proposed that Georgian polyphony possibly contributed to the emergence of European professional polyphony (this idea was developed by Marius Schneider for several decades). Russian musicians Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov and Nikolai Klenovsky also contributed to the early study of Georgian folk music. Russian scholar Steshenko-Kuftina contributed a highly revered monograph on Georgian panpipe.
After the fall of the Soviet Union a number of Western Scholars started working on Georgian folk music, mostly on different aspects the traditional polyphony. Among them are Carl Linich, Stuart Gelzer, Susanne Ziegler, Simha Arom, Polo Vallejo, John A. Graham, Lauren Ninoshvili, Caroline Bithell, and Andrea Kuzmich.

In the 21st century Georgia has become one of the international centers of the study of the phenomenon of traditional polyphony. In 2003 the International Research Centre for Traditional Polyphony was established (director Rusudan Tsurtsumia). The tradition of biannual conferences and symposia started in Georgia in the 1980s. These symposia are drawing leading experts of traditional polyphony to Georgia.

==Urban music==
Urban music must have started as soon as the first cities appeared in Georgia. Tbilisi became the capital of Georgia in the fifth century, and was known as the cultural center of Caucasus. Tbilisi was on the important routes connecting the East with the West, as well as the North with the South. This strategic position was attracting various ethnic groups, and Tbilisi early became a cosmopolitan city with many languages and many musical styles mixed together. Out of different styles the Middle Eastern monophony with augmented seconds, sensual melodies and instrumental accompaniment were particularly popular. There are not very early historical sources about Georgian urban music, but at least Georgian kings of the 17th and 18th centuries had Middle-Eastern style professional musicians serving at their courts. One of them, the great Armenian musician Sayat Nova, served as a court musician of the King Erekle the Second, and was composing songs in Georgian, Armenian, and Azeri languages. The popularity of this style of music was particularly great by the end of the 19th century, when mostly agricultural Georgians were not attracted to the big cities, and businessmen from other countries (particularly Armenians) became the majority of the city population. At the same time, the polyphonic nature of Georgian music influenced monophonic melodies of the Armenian, Turkish and Iranian origin, and they became polyphonic (usually three-part with the original melody in the middle part).

From the second part of the 19th century a new popular musical style came to Georgia. This was European classical music, based on parallel thirds and triadic harmonies. Opening of the opera in 1850 had a profound influence on Georgian urban societies and soon a new style songs became very popular. The new European style of Georgian urban music consists of two genres: (1) a cappella choral singing in three vocal parts, and (2) solo (or three-part) singing with the accompaniment of musical instrument (usually a guitar, or a piano).

==Professional music==

Professional music in Georgia existed at least from the 7-8th centuries, when Georgian composers started translating Greek orthodox Christian chants, adding harmonies to the monophonic melodies, and also were creating original chants. It is widely accepted, that polyphony in Georgian church-singing came from the folk tradition. Georgian church-music has many parallels with Georgian traditional music, although some elements of folk musical style were never used in church-singing (for example, the very long drones of eastern Georgian table songs, or the yodel of Western Georgian counterpoint. In some regions Christian chants have clear elements of pre-Christian traditions as well. Scholars usually distinguish two styles of Georgian church-singing: eastern Georgian and western Georgian. Both styles are based on similar principles, particularly the &quot;simple mood&quot; of singing, but in some western Georgian church-singing styles (particularly in so-called &quot;Shemokmedi school&quot;) the polyphonic mastery and the use of sharp dissonances reaches its climax. The study of church-singing was strictly forbidden in the Soviet Union, but after the fall of the Soviet Union this became one of the most actively researched spheres of Georgian musicology.

The so-called &quot;new Georgian professional musical school&quot; started in the second half of the 19th century. It was based on European classical musical language and classical musical forms (opera, symphony, etc.). The greatest representatives of this school of Georgian composers (Zakaria Paliashvili, Dimitri Arakishvili, Niko Sulkhanishvili) merged European musical language with the elements of Georgian traditional harmony and polyphony. Among the composers of the later period were Andria Balanchivadze (brother of George Balanchine), Aleksandre Machavariani, Shalva Mshvelidze, Otar Taktakishvili. The most prominent contemporary Georgian composer is Antwerp-based Giya Kancheli.

Georgia-born violinist Lisa Batiashvili enjoys an international reputation.

===Traditional musical instruments===

A wide variety of musical instruments are known from Georgia. Among the most popular instruments are: wind instruments such as the soinari, known in Samegrelo as larchemi (Georgian panpipe), stviri (flute), gudastviri (bagpipe), string instruments like the changi (harp), chonguri (four stringed unfretted long neck lute), panduri (three stringed fretted long neck lute), bowed chuniri, known also as chianuri, plus a variety of drums and percussive instruments.
Georgian musical instruments are traditionally overshadowed by the rich vocal traditions of Georgia, and subsequently received much less attention from Georgian (and Western) scholars. Dimitri Arakishvili and particularly Manana Shilakadze contributed to the study of musical instrument in Georgia

====Chuniri-chianuri====

Only the mountain inhabitants of Georgia preserve the bowed Chuniri in its original form. This instrument is considered to be a national instrument of Svaneti and is thought to have spread in the other regions of Georgia from there. Chuniri has different names in different regions: in Khevsureti, Tusheti (Eastern mountainous parts) its name is Chuniri, and in Racha, Guria (western parts of Georgia) &quot;Chianuri&quot;. Chuniri is used for accompaniment. It is often played in an ensemble with Changi (harp) and Salamuri (flute). Both men and women played it. Accompaniment of solo songs, national heroic poems and dance melodies were performed on it in Svaneti. Chuniri and Changi are often played together in an ensemble when performing polyphonic songs. More than one Chianuri at a time is not used. Chianuri is kept in a warm place.

Often, especially in rainy days it was warmed in the sun or near fireplace before using, in order to emit more harmonious sounds. This fact is acknowledged in all regions where the fiddlestick instruments were spread. That is done generally because dampness and wind make a certain effect on the instrument&#x27;s resonant body and the leather that covers it. In Svaneti and Racha people even could make a weather forecast according to the sound produced by Chianuri. Weak and unclear sounds were the signs of a rainy weather.

The instrument&#x27;s side strings i.e. first and third strings are tuned in fourth, but the middle (second) string is tuned in third with the lowest string and second with the top string. It was a tradition to play Chuniri late in the evening the day before a funeral. For instance, one of the relatives (man) of a dead person would sit down in open air by the bonfire and play a sad melody. In his song (sang in a low voice) he would remember the life of the deceased person and the lives of ancestors of the family. Most of the songs performed on Chianuri are connected with sad occasions. There is an expression in Svaneti that &quot;Chuniri is for sorrow&quot;. However, it can be used at parties as well.

The Abkharza is a two-string musical instrument which is played by a bow. It is thought to have spread through Georgia from the region of Abkhazia. Mostly the Abkharza is used as an accompaniment instrument. There are performed one, two or three part songs and national heroic poems on it. Abkharza is cut out of a whole wood piece and has a shape of a boat. Its overall length is 480mm. its upper board is glued back to the main part. On the end it has two tuners.

<doc id="412720" wikidata="Q3328758" url="?curid=412720" title="Music of Saudi Arabia">
<text>The music of Saudi Arabia includes both Western and traditional music. The most distinguished musician in recent Saudi history is Tariq Abdulhakeem, who composed hundreds of famous Saudi songs for himself as well as for other singers; Saraj Omar has become a very prominent composer after writing the music for the Saudi national anthem; Mohammed Abdu, dubbed the artist of the Arab world; Talal Maddah who died in August 2000 while singing in the summer festival on the stage of Al-Muftaha Theatre in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. The 1st Arab Pioneers Festival, which was held in Cairo under the patronage of the Arab League, honored four of the lead composers in Saudi Arabia: Tariq Abdulhakeem, Ghazi Ali, Mohamed Alsenan, and Mohammed Shafiq Chughtai. Of the same generation are the oud virtuoso Abadi al Johar, Rabeh Saqer and Abdul-Majeed Abdullah.

==Overview==
Saudi traditional music is quite limited. However, the migratory lifestyle of the bedouin militated against carrying excess baggage, including musical instruments. Simple rhythms, with the beat counted by clapping or striking together everyday implements formed the basis of the music. Instruments like the double-reeded ney or the stringed rababa were sometimes used, after being obtained in cosmopolitan cities such as Jeddah.

However, music is considered &quot;sinful&quot; or &quot;haram&quot; by Wahhabi Muslims, including Salah Al Budair who is the Imam of the Grand mosque in Medina. This is based in part on certain Ahadith which speak negatively of non-percussion musical instruments and the idea that music and art are distractions from God. Some Muslims also believe it is sinful for songs to make any mention of women and for women to be involved in the composition of music. Particularly in the early days of the current Saudi state, religious authorities were quick to repress music other than the rhythmic percussion that still dominates contemporary Saudi music.

Ibtisam Lutfi and Etab were among the first two female singers from Saudi Arabia, with 1979 being a pivotal year for the emergence of female musicianship in the kingdom.

Omar Basaad was chosen as the best Saudi DJ and Electronic Dance Music Producer in 2012, by &quot;Saudi Gazette&quot;. He became the first official Saudi EDM (Electronic Dance Music) producer to represent Saudi Arabia internationally.

Samri is a popular traditional music and dance style in Najd Region.

In 2023, the first &quot;Saudi Idol&quot; competition was held in Riyadh, with judges Aseel Abu Bakr, Ahlam, Assala, and Maged al Mohandes. 29-year-old Hams Fekri, a singer from Jeddah, won the title.

==Dance==
===Ardah===
Ardah, a type of folkloric dance, is the most popular dance in Saudi Arabia, and also the national dance. It is performed with two rows of men opposite of one another, each of whom may or may not be wielding a sword or cane, and is accompanied by drums and spoken poetry.

Najdi ardah is the most common variant of ardah in Saudi Arabia. It is also the most practiced and highly televised male folkloric dance in the entire country. The Saudi government changed its name to &#x27;Saudi ardah&#x27; in the 21st century. However, there are numerous variations of ardah distinct from Najdi ardah throughout the country, notably in the regions of Najran, Asir and Jizan.

==Rock/metal music==
Rock and metal artists from Saudi Arabia include The AccoLade and Al-Namrood.

==Music institutions==
Pursuant to the order of the Saudi Crown Prince, the first music teaching institute was established in Riyadh in 2019. The Institute was launched by the Egyptian violinist Mahmoud Sorour. Sorour plans to train around 50 violinists to enable them to perform in Jeddah opera house that is planned to be launched in 2022.

<text>Kuwait is well known in the region for its exploration of many different and new forms of music and dance. Kuwait is the birthplace of various popular musical genres such as sawt. Kuwait is widely considered the centre of traditional music in the GCC region.

==History==
Kuwait is the birthplace of various popular musical genres, such as sawt and fijiri. Traditional Kuwaiti music is derived from the country&#x27;s seafaring heritage. In pre-oil times, Kuwait was regionally renowned for its music and 20–30% of Kuwaitis were professional musicians. Kuwait is widely considered the centre of traditional music in the Persian Gulf. Traditional Kuwaiti music reflects the cosmopolitan influence of many diverse cultures. The Habbān is a popular Kuwaiti music instrument.

Kuwait&#x27;s seafaring tradition is known for songs such as &quot;Fidjeri&quot;. &quot;Fidjeri&quot; is a musical repertoire performed traditionally by male pearl divers. It involves singing, clapping, drums and dances with earthen water jars. &quot;Liwa&quot; and &quot;Fann at-Tanbura&quot; are types of music performed mainly by Kuwaitis of East African origin. &quot;Al Arda Al Bahariya&quot; is a well-known Kuwaiti sailor song, as are the &quot;al-Nahma&quot;, a class of songs that accompanied many sailing activities.

Kuwait pioneered contemporary Khaliji music. Kuwaitis were the first commercial recording artists in the Persian Gulf region. The first known Kuwaiti recordings were made between 1912 and 1915. Kuwait is known as the center for &quot;sawt&quot;, a bluesy style of music made popular in the 1970s. Saleh and Daoud Al-Kuwaity pioneered the Kuwaiti sawt music genre and wrote over 650 songs, many of which are considered traditional and still played daily on radio stations both in Kuwait and the rest of the Arab world.

Kuwait has a reputation for being the central music influence of the GCC countries. Over the last decade of satellite television stations, many Kuwaiti musicians have become household names in other Arab countries. For example, Bashar Al Shatty became famous due to &quot;Star Academy&quot;. Contemporary Kuwaiti music is popular throughout the Arab world. Nawal El Kuwaiti, Nabeel Shoail and Abdallah Al Rowaished are the most popular contemporary performers.

==Music education==
Kuwait has academic institutions specializing in university-level music education. The Higher Institute of Musical Arts was established by the government to provide bachelor&#x27;s degrees in music. In addition, the College of Basic Education offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in music education. The Institute of Musical Studies offers music education qualifications equivalent to secondary school.

==Notable landmarks==
The Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Cultural Centre contains the largest opera house in the Middle East. Kuwait is home to various music festivals, including the International Music Festival hosted by the National Council for Culture, Arts and Letters (NCCAL). The annual Gulf Music Festival features internationally renowned jazz musicians and local musicians.

<doc id="412723" wikidata="Q6942404" url="?curid=412723" title="Music of the United Arab Emirates">
<text>The music of the [[United Arab Emirates]] stems from the Eastern Arabia music traditions. Distinctive dance songs from the area&#x27;s fishermen are also well-known. Liwa (or leiwah / leywah) is a type of music and dance performed mainly in communities which contain descendants of Bantu peoples from the African Great Lakes region, and hybrid Afro-Arab rhythms such as the Sha&#x27;abi al-Emirati and Bandari remain the standard in both traditional and popular music in this historically cosmopolitan country.

Performers in the country include Mohammed Al Muhairi (better known as Mehad Hamad), Ahlam Ali Al Shamsi, and Hussain Al Jasmi.

The Emirati-American composer Mohammed Fairouz has been commissioned to premiere his fifth symphony at the Abu Dhabi Festival in 2020

In 2020 Emirati Composer Ihab Darwish was commissioned by The Palm Fountain (Dubai, UAE) - world’s largest fountain by the Guinness Book of World Record, to compose an official musical theme “Aim For The Sky” as a sonic brand and its signature music. The composition pays homage to the UAE&#x27;s culture as well as capture Dubai&#x27;s cosmopolitanism and is performed regularly at The Palm Fountain at The Pointe, Dubai, from  December 1, 2020.

In 2021 Abu Dhabi Festival commissioned Emirati composer Ihab Darwish, in collaboration with Emmy-winning composer John Debney and Academy Award-winning composer David Shire, to celebrate the historic opening of the Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi. Bringing together top international composers, musicians and vocal ensembles from Christian, Jewish and Muslim backgrounds, the Symphony of Three. Peace, love, tolerance celebrates unity and peace. The premiere took place on December 30, 2022, and is available online on YouTube. 

In June 2022, Ihab Darwish became the first Emirati invited to be a voting member of the Grammy Recording Academy. Darwish is among 2,000 new voting members requested to join the world’s leading society of music professionals, whose mission is “to recognise excellence in the recording arts and sciences, cultivate the well-being of the music community, and ensure that music remains an indelible part of our culture”. 

== Original music in the UAE ==
The UAE houses a lively underground music scene consisting mostly of expatriates. Concentrated in Dubai, the majority of local artists play rock and metal music. Some musicians also play alternative styles of music such as ska, punk, house and experimental music.

Yassin Alsalman, better known by his stage name Narcy, was born in Dubai in 1982.

Canadian singer Karl Wolf lived in Dubai between the ages of three and seventeen, and has since returned to perform in the UAE.

Wissam Khodur, better known as the Syrian/Lebanese MC Eslam Jawaad, has been living in the UAE since 2011. In 2017 he appeared onstage with Gorillaz, having previously worked with bandleader Damon Albarn on The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen.

Members of the psychedelic indie band Flamingods lived for a time in the UAE, and founder Kamal Rasool credits Dubai as a pivotal incubator and inspiration behind 2016&#x27;s third album &quot;Majesty&quot;.

In 2012 the UAE&#x27;s only chain music retailer, Virgin Megastores, revealed a chart of the best-selling local acts to entertainment magazine Time Out Dubai. Based on total sales of all combined releases, the list was nominally topped by Karl Wolf, with second and third places going to soul-pop quartet Abri and rock group Juliana Down - two of the first homegrown acts to achieve widespread recognition in the Emirates.

In 2015 this concept was repeated in The National, which compiled a list of Virgin&#x27;s 20 best-selling local releases of the past five years, as well as breaking the chart down by genre. With Wolf this time deemed exempt, the list was topped by Juliana Down&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Empires&quot; (Abri&#x27;s two albums were released earlier in 2008 and 2009), followed by house-pop duo SickAsSwans&#x27; debut &quot;These Words&quot; and Nigerian-born urban act Ash Hamman&#x27;s self-titled debut.

A year later The National updated the chart looking specifically at the best-selling releases of the past 12 months, revealing metal act Svengali to be the best-seller with debut &quot;Theory of Mind&quot;.

Among the best-known UAE acts internationally are metal band Nervecell. Other hard rock and metal acts from the UAE to tour internationally include Anuryzm, E.Y.E., Point of View and Jay Wud, who launched a fundraising campaign to finance sessions in Los Angeles for third album &quot;Transitions&quot;.

In 2012 hard rock quintet Point of View launched their debut album &quot;Revolutionize the Revolutionary&quot; with a concert alongside Ron &#x27;Bumblefoot&#x27; Thal, then a member of Guns N&#x27; Roses, who appeared onstage performing songs by both bands. Thal later joined the band on a tour of India and appeared onstage in Abu Dhabi wearing a &quot;PoV&quot; t-shirt. Point of View&#x27;s lead singer Nikhil Uzgare later branched out into Bollywood, recording a rock song as the theme to movie &quot;Iraada&quot;.

Following the breakup of Abri, eponymous lead singer Hamdan Al-Abri released a self-titled EP before joining funk-rock band Bull Funk Zoo in 2012, alongside guitarist Assaad Lakkis. He later formed the popular cover band Abri &amp; Funk Radius alongside jazz musicians Rony and Elie Afif, which released its first original music in 2017, debuting the single &quot;Sunny Daze&quot;, and was the only UAE act invited to perform at the alternative music festival &quot;Wasla&quot;. Lakkis went on to lead Bull Funk Zoo solo. In 2017 Al-Abri also unveiled new music as a member of trio Abri &amp; the Dream Fleet, collaborating alongside producers Megadon Betamax and Adriano K on the album &quot;We Fly&quot;. The latter had earlier produced a collection of South American folk songs and curated an accompanying remix disc featuring contributions from international producers, released in 2012 as &quot;A L.A.S.&quot;.

After a period of inactivity, in 2015 Juliana Down frontman Dia Hassan released a debut solo single &quot;What is Love?&quot;. Juliana Down&#x27;s former main songwriter and keyboardist Saleh Hamed began releasing music under the stage name &quot;Dozenz&quot; including the album &quot;After The Storm/Chasing The Muse&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Album&quot;) in 2021. Following the split of SickAwSwans, in the same year Clarita de Quiroz released her debut album &quot;Speak. Delete. Repeat&quot;.

Formed in 2013, house-pop duo Hollaphonic have received international attention in the press, recording fourth single &quot;Dangerous&quot; with guest vocals from British reality TV star Vince Kidd.

Teenage pop singer Esther Eden enjoyed significant local exposure after being handpicked by British star Jessie J to guest onstage at 2014&#x27;s Redfest DXB festival. Eden was later signed by Universal Music MENA and performed as a solo artist at the same festival a year later.

In 2015 hip-hop trio The Recipe launched a well-received comeback with the single &quot;Death to Get Here&quot;.

Behold The Locus released their second album &#x27;Nations&#x27; in an online format during the summer of 2020.

== Jazz and improvised music in the UAE ==
The UAE is also home to a small but productive collective of jazz musicians. Among the most celebrated is Lebanese pianist Tarek Yamani (whose third album &quot;Peninsular&quot; was premiered at the 2017 Abu Dhabi Festival) and compatriots, drummer Rony Afif and his brother Elie Afif.

Jordanian oud player and guitarist Kamal Musallam has released eight albums to date, fusing jazz and Arabic influences, and is consistently ranked among the UAE&#x27;s bestselling acts. Musallam has performed with notable international musicians including Sting, Bobby McFerrin, Yo-Yo Ma, George Benson and Stanley Jordan and has recorded a full album with Billy Cobham under his project &quot;EastMania&quot;. For 2009 album &quot;Lulu&quot; (a tribute to UAE heritage) he collaborated with Emirati folk group Sokoor Al Magabeel, as well as with Hamdan Al Abri and Rasha Rizk.

<text>The music of [[Bahrain]] is part of the Persian Gulf folk traditions. Alongside Kuwait, it is known for sawt music, a bluesy genre influenced by African, Indian and Persian music. Sultan Hamid, Ali Bahar and Khaled El Sheikh (a singer and oud player) are among the most popular musicians from Bahrain.

Bahrain was the site of the first Persian Gulf-based recording studio, established after World War II. Modern music institutions in Bahrain include the Bahrain Music Institute, the Bahrain Orchestra and the Classical Institute of Music. The Bahraini male-only pearl diving tradition is known for the songs called &quot;fidjeri&quot;.

Liwa and Fann at-Tanbura are types of music and dance performed mainly in communities of descendants of Bantu peoples from the African Great Lakes region.

==Khaleeji==

Khaleeji is a style of Persian Gulf-area folk music, played in Bahrain with polyrhythms. The style is strongly influenced by the music of Africa. Khaleeji singer Ali Bahar is one of the few Bahraini pop stars to sing in a local dialect, along with his band Al Ekhwa.

==Sawt==

In Bahrain, the early pioneers of &quot;sawt&quot; were Mohammed Faris and Dhabi bin Walid in the pre-World War II era. Both recorded their &quot;sawt&quot; music in HMV&#x27;s studio in Baghdad in 1932. Their recordings became widely popular in Bahrain and Kuwait.

The Bahraini &quot;sawt&quot; style became the predominant style of &quot;sawt&quot; in the Persian Gulf region.

==Modern era==
The band Bahraini Osiris has achieved some international renown since the 1980s with its style of progressive rock, most recently including elements of Bahraini folk music.

There is also a heavy metal and hard rock community in the country, with bands writing and performing original songs. Pioneering bands on the Island include Motör Militia, Smouldering In Forgotten and The Mushroom Massacre (members of The Mushroom Massacre went on to form Lunacyst and most recently Death Box Audio). Popular bands in the Kingdom also include MUST, The Relocators, Mo zowayed, Bloodshel and Hot Laser. A community of singer-songwriters has also been active in Bahrain, with Ala Ghawas being among the first of them in the early 2000s. There are some fusion-projects, too – oftentimes mixing influences such as Middle Eastern music tradition with rock - such as Majaz and Aalaat. There is also a small yet active electronic dance music in Bahrain with several producers/DJs, making music in the genres such as techno, house, and trance.

<doc id="412725" wikidata="Q3328786" url="?curid=412725" title="Music of Yemen">
<text>Yemen, a country on the Arabian Peninsula, holds a prominent position in the realm of music, garnering recognition for its distinctive musical traditions. Revered as a cultural capital within the Arab world, Yemen has contributed significantly to the musical landscape of the region.

The musical heritage of Yemen captivates through its melodic prowess and poetic depth, embodying the artistic vibrancy and cultural resilience of the nation. With their captivating melodies and expressive lyrics, Yemeni musicians have left an indelible mark on both domestic and global audiences, contributing to the music in the region.

UNESCO proclaimed the tradition of poetic songs of Sana&#x27;a, called &quot;al-Ghina al-San&#x27;ani&quot;, a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Yemenis commemorate July 1 as the Yemeni Song Day, an annual celebration that underscores the integral role of music in Yemeni society.

==History==
===Pre-history ===
Archaeological excavations have confirmed the antiquity of music in Yemen, demonstrating that it is a unique art form independent of influences from the ancient Near East. Yemeni music is deeply rooted in the region, widely disseminated, and influential among various cultures—even reaching the countries of the Far Maghreb. 

Archaeological surveys and excavations—ranging from petroglyphs in regions such as Saada, Tihama, Sana’a (&quot;Bayen Jadrain&quot;), Haz, Al-Jawf, Marib, and Najran—to artefacts such as coins, statues, and inscriptions—have revealed that music in ancient Yemeni civilisations originated when early Yemenis employed a diverse array of musical instruments. For example, a French mission in the Saada region uncovered a rock drawing depicting the &quot;kinara&quot; instrument, dating back to prehistoric times. In the Al-Jawf region, columns at the Arn Yedda Temple feature scenes of musical instruments accompanied by dancers, representing wind instruments like the trumpet and the &quot;khushkhishah&quot;—a sound-producing instrument—with this artwork dated to the 9th–8th century BC. Additionally, a column at the Ma&#x27;in Temple displays scenes of musical processions that include stringed instruments such as the Tanbura, alongside wind instruments like the trumpet and flute, carried by groups of priests. Numerous other archaeological findings further attest to the rich diversity of wind, percussion, vocal, and stringed instruments in ancient Yemen.

The documentation of rock art has played a prominent role in shedding light on the musical arts of ancient Yemeni civilisation, beginning in the Paleolithic era. The widespread availability of rock surfaces provided an ideal canvas for recording daily life and activities visually. Al-Eidaroos contends that these rock drawings carry a mystical meaning associated with religious beliefs. For example, a painting from the area &quot;Bayen Jadrain&quot;, dating back to the Bronze Age, depicts dancing figures alongside animals. In addition to numerous rock drawings that also illustrate musical scenes featuring various instruments. Some images show musicians actively playing, while others merely depict the presence of instruments.

In a rock drawing from Al-Mastour Cave in the Tihama region—dating back to the Bronze Age—a group of figures is depicted performing a ritual dance traditionally held before hunting ceremonies. This type of dance appears abundantly at various sites, tracing its origins to prehistoric times. Similar scenes are also evident in rock art from the Hima region in Najran, where groups of figures are shown engaged in devotional dancing with raised hands. These images highlight significant cultural, religious, and social patterns among the region’s ancient inhabitants. Notably, the rock painting represents a primitive depiction of human figures, rendered in a form of drawing style that is closely associated with religious symbolism that was commonly executed on rock surfaces.

In the Al-Baha region, a coloured drawing was found of a group of people dancing in a group, forming a single row, raising both hands and beating what resembles drums, and what their hands hold are drumsticks for beating the drums.

German scholar Holfritz, during his travels in Yemen, documented over a hundred distinct types of traditional Yemeni music. He attributed this diversity to two main factors: first, the unique cultural and environmental characteristics of the Bedouin tribes, and second, the varied geographical landscape of the region. Holfritz concluded that these factors combined to create a rich musical tradition in ancient Yemen that set it apart from the music prevalent in the cities of the Near East.

Holfritz reinforced his observations regarding the diversity of melodies and the transitions between different rhythmic degrees. Notably, he discovered a striking similarity between Yemeni musical melodies and the Berber music of North African tribes, particularly in Morocco. Furthermore, he traced the spread of these musical expressions to the West, suggesting that such melodic traditions had been transmitted since the Stone Age via South Arabian (Yemeni) and Berber cultural exchanges. Similarly, In the introduction to his book on the origins of music, Farmer underscores the pivotal role of the South Arabian kingdoms in the emergence and development of music, tracing its roots back to the early first millennium BC. He also references an inscription from the seventh century BC by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal, which expresses admiration for Arab music—remarking that Arab captives spent their time singing and playing music while serving the Assyrian kings.

The Yemeni researcher, Widad Ahmed Qasim Al-Qadasi, argues that the ancient Yemeni migrations, which began at the start of the first millennium BC, played a crucial role in spreading the musical arts beyond Yemen. These migrations facilitated the transmission of Yemeni musical traditions to regions such as Morocco, where the influence was clearly evident in the Berber music movement—primarily through commercial caravan journeys. Moreover, historical sources recount legends from the pre-Islamic era that are linked to singing. The oldest of these is the legend of &quot;Jaradti ʿĀd&quot;,” in which two female singers distracted the delegation of Ad from praying and seeking aid from the gods of Mecca through their song. This event is regarded as the origin of female singing.

This is corroborated by Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani in the eighth part of Al-Iklil, where he recounts an ancient cave containing the grave of Mansik bin Luqaim, the treasurer of Aad. In that cave, on the lower level, he describes “two great statues that God Almighty transformed into stones, fashioned in the likeness of two slave girls. One of the statues bears a transformed &quot;Artaba&quot; (ancient lute-type), while in its left hand it holds a transformed mizmar.” Additionally, the use of the tanbur is attributed to the Sabaeans; as Huth noted—based on a manuscript in her possession—the Sabaeans were the first to adopt this instrument.

Likewise, Abu Hilal al-Askari attributed the emergence of Arabic singing to Jaradti, he identified them as they belong to Abdullah bin Jud’an. Al-Qalqashandi, however, contends that singing in the Arabian Peninsula predates the era of Jarada and has been known since the time of Ād.

=== Ancient history ===

In the Arabian Peninsula, historian al-Masudi traced the origin of Arabic singing to what he called the “Hada,” stating, “The Hada is the origin of singing.” According to his account, when camels became exhausted on their long journeys, they required something to stimulate them and help them forget the pain of hunger, thirst, and heavy loads—thus, the “Hada” served as one of the best means of revival. He also noted that Yemen was familiar with two distinct types of singing—Himyarite and Hanafi—with Yemenis preferring the latter. The beautiful vocal quality known as “al-Jadan” is said to derive its name from Ali bin Zaid Dhi Jadan, one of the kings of Himyar, whose epithet “Dhi Jadan” celebrated the beauty of his voice.
Dr. Muhammad Basalama also observes that the history of singing in Yemen extends back to the Sabaean and Minaean civilisations, as evidenced by the widespread use of musical instruments depicted on gravestones carved in marble and lime—often played by women.

=== Post-classical history (Middle age) ===
Yemeni singers have risen to prominence in various eras. At the close of the Umayyad period and the dawn of the Abbasid era, Ibn Tanbur became renowned for his light style of singing, known as “al-Hazj” (Close to the meaning of The Rhyme). Historians have described him as one of the most eloquent and agile singers. For instance, Al-Isfahani, in his book Kitab al-Aghani, distinguishes between three vocal traditions—Arabic, Yemeni, and Roman—citing, among other examples, how Ibrahim Al-Mawsili performed a Yemeni tune. Zabid has long been a thriving centre of musical prosperity in the Middle Ages, particularly during the era of the Najahid state. The Najahid family, of Ethiopian origin and following in the footsteps of their Zaydi forebears, were prominent patrons of the musical arts. However, with the collapse of the Najahid state, this flourishing tradition gradually diminished, and many of its distinctive elements may have migrated and dispersed over time. A brief reappearance had occurred during the reign of Imam Sharaf Al-Din and his son Al-Muzaffar. During this time, a celebrated singer performed in the palace of the Turkish governor in Sana’a, and credit for his fame is attributed to Isa bin Lutfallah, the grandson of Imam Sharaf Al-Din. Notably, the prohibition and subsequent suppression of singing during that era is underscored by the absence of this singer’s name in contemporary accounts of his art.

=== Early modern history ===
==== Turkish influence ====
When Yemen became part of the Ottoman Empire, it retained strong ties to its musical heritage—particularly the period of the Rasulid dynasty (1229–1453). This era is closely associated with the emergence of the Humini muwashshah in Yemen, a form that became integral to Sana’a’s singing tradition. The earliest Humini muwashshah still performed in Sana’a is attributed to the poet Ahmed bin Fleita (d. 1331), whose renown spread during the reign of a struggling Rasulid king. According to Dr. Muhammad Abdo Ghanem, the muwashshah form was introduced to Yemen by the Ayyubids (1173–1229). Once in Yemen, however, it assumed a distinct local character—a blend of colloquial and classical elements—and became the poetic foundation of both the Rasulid court’s performances and Sufi lodge chants. Although this style, which flourished in Tihama, Taiz, and Aden, later declined with the fall of the Rasulid dynasty, it experienced a revival under Ottoman patronage, either through musical concerts organised by the Turkish ruler in Sana’a or via support for Sufi groups that continue to practice religious chanting.

The earliest documented evidence of Turkish influence on Sana’a singing appears in the book Sana’a Singing Poetry by Dr. Muhammad Abdo Ghanem—a study for which he received his doctorate from the University of London in 1968 and which was published in 1970. In his study, Ghanem concludes that the Turks made a significant contribution to the development of Yemeni music. He cites an account by Issa bin Lutfallah, the grandson of Al-Mutahhar bin Sharaf Al-Din, who recounted musical concerts held in the residence of the Turkish ruler in Sana’a. Ghanem further notes that Turkish influence extended beyond these concerts to include a broader renewal and diversification of Yemeni musical composition.

Yemeni music critic Gamal Hasan sees that the incorporation of Turkish musical elements did not diminish the uniqueness of Yemeni singing. Rather, the Turkish presence in Yemen left lasting social and cultural influences—music being no exception. Turkish music is recognised as one of the sources of Yemeni singing, alongside indigenous influences that emerged in areas under Ottoman control. Yemeni singing, renowned for its antiquity, served as a reference for the people of the Hijaz and other parts of the Arabian Peninsula. For example, Safina Shihab al-Din&#x27;s research on songs used in Egypt until the mid-19th century reveals roles written in Yemeni dialects and even identifies Ibn Fleita’s muwashshah Li fi Raba Hajar—the oldest Humayni muwashshah still in use within the Sana’a singing tradition.

=== Modern music ===
Art critics date the emergence of modern song in Yemen’s northern provinces to the period of Sheikh Saad Abdullah, who memorised three thousand lyrical poems and enchanted both people and birds with his singing. He was killed in the city of Matnah in 1919 CE during Imam Yahya’s siege of Sana’a to expel the Turks. In the southern provinces, a vibrant group of artists emerged during the British occupation of Aden (1839 – 1967), with singing and music becoming widespread among Yemeni artists. Professor Muhammad Murshid Naji noted that Lahji singing prior to the era of Ahmed Fadhl al-Qumindan was influenced by the Sana’ani style. Lahji singers would perform Sana’ani songs, and the singer Hadi Sabit al-Nubi developed his oud-playing by drawing on the techniques of a northern artist whose name remains unrecorded. Naji attributes the emergence of the first Lahji melody to the poet, composer, and singer Fadhl Mater, who is credited with inventing the initial melody set to the Lahji rhythm—an innovation that led Hadi Sabit to sing in the Sana’ani style over one of Al-Qumandan’s poems.

==== Indian and Egyptian Influences ====
In the 1920s and 1930s, Indian musical influences became prominent as numerous musical and theatre groups, as well as films, were introduced in Aden and Hadhramaut, which had long been under the administration of the British Viceroy of India. By the 1940s and 1950s, Yemeni musicians had adapted these influences to create an &quot;Arabized&quot; Indian style, in which tunes from Indian films were reinterpreted with texts set in classical Arabic rather than colloquial language. The acclaimed artist Muhammad Juma Khan, known for his mastery of the Hadhrami style, became one of the foremost practitioners of this hybrid form.

The distinctive features of Adeni singing developed during the twentieth century as a result of the convergence of multiple Yemeni and foreign musical elements, especially from India. Though a large portion of Aden&#x27;s pre-independence population was of Indian origin, the evolution of Adeni song was notably influenced by Egyptian melodies, and some musicians even incorporating Western rhythms such as the waltz.

== Genres ==
Yemeni singing is characterised by its diversity, with no single centralised hub dominating its development. According to the Yemeni music critic Gamal Hasan, the diversity is partly due to the wide range of Yemeni dialects, but it also reflects several other factors—most notably the fragmented political landscape that has prevented the establishment of a stable cultural centre. The lack of a sustained, unified political and civil structure meant that a uniform artistic taste never fully emerged. Moreover, factors such as social stagnation—often linked to class privileges and reinforced by political, religious, regional, or tribal dynamics—have further contributed to the regional variation in singing styles. As a result, each Yemeni region has developed its own distinct musical expressions, with unique melodic forms that vary widely regardless of their apparent simplicity or monotony.

There are five widely regional genres or &quot;colours&quot; (&quot;lawn&quot;) of Yemeni music; Sanaani, Yafi&#x27;i, Laheji, Adeni, and Hadhrami. While some sources expand this classification to include additional styles such as Tihami and Ta&#x27;izzi. However, Jaber Ali Ahmed—widely regarded as the pioneer of Yemeni music criticism—argues in his book &quot;Trends of Renewal of Singing in Yemen&quot; that these classifications are relatively recent, emerging between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He argues that these categorisations are scientifically flawed because they fail to capture the distinct character of various regions and do not reflect the true richness of Yemeni singing. According to Jaber, this division is a result of the regional fragmentation that occurred during the British colonial period that resulted the Federation of the Emirates of South Arabia.

=== Sana&#x27;ani ===

Sanaa has a rich musical tradition and is particularly renowned for the musical style called &quot;al-Ghina al-San&#x27;ani&quot; ( ), or &quot;the song of Sanaa&quot;, which dates back to the 14th century and was designated as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage on November 7, 2003. This style of music is not exclusive to Sanaa, and is found in other areas of Yemen as well, but it is most closely associated with the city. It is often part of social events, including the samra, or evening wedding party, and the magyal, or daily afternoon gathering of friends.

Researchers trace the earliest known Sana’a song, &quot;&quot;Ana Ya Abu Ya Ana&quot;,&quot; to approximately four centuries ago. However, this song likely existed in multiple variants—originally chanted by farmers with differing melodies—and evolved over the centuries to reach its current form.

Efforts to modernise Sana’a singing have been limited, with attempts made to preserve its character as it existed several centuries ago, or at least over the last two centuries. The rugged terrain around Sana’a fostered isolation, restricting the influx of external melodic influences that were more prevalent in coastal regions such as Hadhramaut, Aden, and Lahj. Additionally, Sana’a singing is noted for its distinct maqam forms, which utilise quarter-tone intervals, setting it apart from other regional styles.

The basic format of the Sana&#x27;ani singing consists of a singer accompanied by two instrumentalists, one playing the qanbus (Yemeni lute) and the other playing the sahn nuhasi, which is a copper tray balanced on the musician&#x27;s thumbs and played by being lightly struck by the other eight fingers. Lyrics are in both classical Arabic and Yemeni Arabic and are known for their wordplay and emotional content. Singers often use melismatic vocals, and the arrangements feature pauses between verses and instrumental sections. Skilled performers often &quot;embellish&quot; a song&#x27;s melody to highlight its emotional tone.

In the earliest days of the recording industry in Yemen, from 1938 into the 1940s, Sanaani music was the dominant genre among Yemenis who could afford to buy records and phonographs (primarily in Aden). As prices fell, Sanaani-style records became increasingly popular among the middle class, but at the same time, it began to encounter competition from other genres, including Western and Indian music as well as music from other Arab countries. The earliest Sanaani recording stars generally came from wealthy religious families. The most popular was Ali Abu Bakr Ba Sharahil, who recorded for Odeon Records; other popular artists included Muhammad and Ibrahim al-Mas, Ahmad Awad al-Jarrash, and Muhammad Abd al-Rahman al-Makkawi.

=== Hadhrami ===
The music of Hadhramaut is one of the most prominent forms of Arabic music. Its distinctive maqamat and signature vocal styles—featuring full performances in the Hadhrami Arabic dialect, unique rhythmic patterns, and a characteristic humming style known as &quot;Dan&quot;—have made it a vital component of the Yemeni music. This genre reflects a rich blend of local traditions and foreign influences, drawing from Indian and African musical elements, in part due to Hadhramaut’s strategic position along the ancient incense road. The music has also been deeply shaped by Sufism.

Key figures in the Dan tradition include poets such as Haddad bin Hassan al-Kaf and Hussein al-Muhdar, alongside renowned performers like Saeed Awad, Haddad al-Kaf, Karama Mursal, and Abu Bakr Salem Balfaqih. In particular, the partnership of Abu Bakr Salem Balfaqih and poet Hussein Al-Mehdhar is widely recognised for transforming and disseminating the Hadhrami Dan style both within and beyond Yemen.

Hadhrami music has not only enriched Yemeni cultural heritage but has also significantly influenced the musical landscapes of regions beyond the Arabian Peninsula, notably in parts of Africa and East Asia.

=== Lahji ===

When singing in Sana’a was banned by the Imams, many performers fled to the South Yemen or other countries. Accodring to Gamal Hasan, The court of the Sultans of Lahij (Abdali Sultanate), served as a refuge for these artists during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries—long before Lahj emerged as a prominent centre of singing under the patronage of one of its princes. Originally, Lahj’s musical heritage consisted of a repertoire of chants and simple melodies. The Sultans of Al-Abadali trace their roots to the Arhab region north of Sana’a. They arrived in Lahj as part of the army of Imam Al-Mutawakkil Ala Allah Al-Qasim in the late eighteenth century, and following the fragmentation of the Qasimid kingdom due to internal divisions, they eventually established independent rule over Lahj and Aden.

The development of Lahji singing can be attributed to Prince Ahmed bin Fadhl Al-Abdali (widely known as Al-Qumandan), who played a key role in re-establishing political independence through his revival of Lahji singing in the early twentieth century. In one of his songs, Al-Qumandan touches upon the decline of Sana’a singing, Hasan attributes that as an attempt to politically distance the court from the dominance of that style and, perhaps, assert pride in Lahji’s distinct cultural identity. The rise of recorded music in Aden allowed Al-Qumandan to gain exposure to foreign melodic influences, helped by his privileged position as a prince, which enabled him to acquire records from India and Egypt. Through his talent and creativity, he successfully integrated these foreign musical elements into Lahji singing while maintaining the genre’s inherent uniqueness. After Al-Qumandan’s death in 1941, new melodies began to appear, but Lahji singing did not undergo significant evolution. Instead, it experienced a period of stagnation, retaining its traditional melodies as it struggled to introduce innovative changes.

The song “&quot;Ya Ward Ya Kadhi&quot;,” set in the Bayati maqam, is one of Al-Qumindan&#x27;s most renowned compositions and has become a staple at Yemeni weddings. Its uniqueness lies in Al-Qumindan&#x27;s ambition to emulate the rumba rhythms he had encountered. Promising his close associates that he would perform a “rumba” song for them, he secluded himself during Ramadan to create this piece, resulting in a lively, joyful tune that inspires dancing. The melody unfolds gradually, beginning with a modest refrain and then moving into the repeated chant of “&quot;Ya Ward Ya Kadhi...&quot;,” where the &#x27;Re&#x27; note is reiterated continuously and the vocal extension is emphasised on “&quot;Ya Kadhi...&quot;”

The melodic journey expands further with repeated phrases on the &#x27;Sol&#x27; note in “&quot;Ya Qamri Al Wadi&quot;.” At this point, Gamal Hasan considers Al-Qumindan&#x27;s melodic approach as innovative and daring, as he makes an unprecedented leap from C to F—a move that is exceptional in traditional Yemeni singing, which typically relies on subtle, gradual transitions.

Al-Qumindan also incorporated traditional local rhythms, such as the zaffa and the marous, into the song. By drawing on the melodic theme, he crafted what is considered the first Yemeni rumba—and perhaps even the first Arab rumba—according to Hasan, imbuing the composition with a distinct local character.

=== Adeni ===

During the twentieth century, Aden emerged as a major hub for Yemeni singing. It was there that the first recordings of Sana’a singing—and various other forms of Yemeni music, including those of Yemeni Jews—were produced. Record production companies played a significant role in fostering artistic activity, marking what Gamal Hasan considers “the first bourgeois singing phenomenon in Yemen”. Following independence, however, these companies gradually withdrew as a socialist trend took hold, and musical production became state-sponsored.

The distinctive features of Adeni singing developed during the twentieth century as a result of the convergence of multiple Yemeni musical elements. Although a large portion of Aden&#x27;s pre-independence population was of Indian origin, the evolution of Adeni song was notably influenced by Egyptian melodies. This influence is especially evident in the works of Ahmed Qasim. With his academic background in music, Qasim sought to refine the melodic structure and place greater emphasis on the musical refrain. He diversified the melody and enhanced maqam transitions in several compositions, even incorporating Western rhythms such as the waltz. Songs like “&quot;I Miss You&quot;” and “&quot;We Met by Chance&quot;” represent early attempts to broaden the appeal of Yemeni singing beyond its local context and integrate it into the wider Arab musical landscape. Nonetheless, according to Hasan, his approach appeared less pragmatic compared to that of his contemporary Mohammed Saad Abdullah, even though both are recognised as key figures in Yemeni composition and singing.

==Patriotic music==

The national song emerged in Yemen amid intense political turmoil, when the idea of national resistance against the British rule in Democratic Yemen took root, and northern Yemen began to reject the imposition of the Imamate’s rule. This musical phenomenon became particularly significant in tandem with two major revolutions—26 September 1962, and 14 October 1963.

Aden became the cradle of this transformation in music, largely due to its openness to the world and the influx of musical influences, notably from the Arab Republic of Egypt. In contrast, Sana’a suffered decades of isolation under the Imamate, which hindered its cultural and musical exchange.

In the North, leading figures in Yemeni revolutionary art include Abdullah al-Baradouni, Dr. Abdulaziz Al-Maqaleh, Saleh Sahlol, Muhammad Mahmoud Al-Zubairi, Al-Qardaei, among many others. These artists enriched their poetry with revolutionary themes, and numerous Yemeni writers have amplified this impact both domestically and internationally. Prominent among them are Abdullah Abdul-Wahhab Noman (Al-Fadhol), Mutahhar Al-Eryani, Ali Sabra, and Jaber Rizq.

Many poets’ works have been transformed into songs that resonate widely with the Yemeni people. Examples of iconic revolutionary song works include the collaboration of the duo Al-Khader and Al-Anesi on &quot;Our Army, O Our Army... Our Army, O Hero&quot;; Al-Sunidar’s &quot;I Am the People&quot;; Ali Al-Samah’s &quot;&quot;My Brother, O Youth of Redemption&quot;; There is also a poignant song by the artist Hamoud Zaid Issa, which echoes the sentiments of Yemeni immigrants: &quot;My brother the immigrant, the time of the individual has passed, and your free people have displaced the family of tyranny.&quot; Likewise, Abu Al-Hawarith Mohammed Hamoud declares, &quot;This is my land and this is my homeland; I will sacrifice my soul and blood for it.&quot;&quot; Among these also is Ayoub Tarish’s stirring refrain:
Additionally, the Thulati Kawkabani were instrumental in shaping the national song. Their popularity surged after they performed the stirring anthem “&quot;Oh Sallal, Oh Sword of God, Oh Destroyer of the Enemies of God&quot;”, in honour of President Al-Sallal during the Seventy Day Siege, significantly boosting the morale of the army.

In the South, many patriotic songs emerged during the 14 October Revolution, performed by artists such as Mohamed Morshed Naji, Mohamed Mohsen Atroush, Mohamed Saad Abdullah, Ahmed Qasim, Mohamed Abdo Zaidi, and others. These songs introduced a new musical style that reflected the revolutionary spirit—a shift toward a musical expression of resistance against colonial rule, updating both the form and content of traditional songs.

This evolution is exemplified in works like Al-Morshedy’s “Akhy Kablouni,” (My brother, they have tied me) whose lyrics poignantly capture the relationship between the citizen and the coloniser, conveying the deep oppression and tyranny endured by those yearning for freedom.

Similarly, Mohamed Mohsen Atroush’s well-known song, “&quot;Get out, colonialism, from the land of the free,&quot;” features an inspiring melody that galvanises listeners against oppression. In response, the voice of artist Youssef Ahmed Salem echoes, “&quot;October, the holiday of the revolution, we shattered the legend in you.&quot;” Furthermore, among the most emblematic pieces of this revolutionary period is “&quot;We Revolted&quot;” by Ahmed bin Ahmed Qasim, a song that powerfully embodies the genuine struggle against British colonial rule, in addition to: &quot;O Brother, O Son of Yemen... You Are the Past, You Are in the Mouth of Time.&quot;.

Southerners writers and poets that have amplified this impact include: Al-Mehdhar and Lutfi Jaafar Aman.

==Rap music==

Rap and hip-hop culture existed as early as 2005 but it only achieved widespread popularity in 2008 when the hip-hop in Yemen took a leap forward and began to spread around the youth of Yemen, especially in Sana&#x27;a and Aden.

The hip hop major outbreak in Yemen is often associated to the influence of Hajaj Abdulqawi Masaed (also graphed as Hagage Masaed or best known as &quot;AJ&quot;), an American-Yemeni rapper producing music since 1997. Although he had grown in the United States, AJ has successfully reached Yemeni audience by addressing to local issues and incorporating traditional musical language into his hits. This versatility was also one of the reasons he drew international recognition, since he entered in the Yemeni music scene, he has been partnering up with several Yemeni artists, such as Hussein Muhib, Fuad Al-Kibisi, Fuad Al-Sharjabi, Ibrahim Al-Taefi, Abdurahman Al-Akhfash and others, and helping new ones to develop their talents. He has also played a major role on propagating the understanding of rap as a means of change.
&lt;br&gt;
One contributing factor to the development of the music is also the creation of Yemen Music House in 2007 that has been providing assets to the development of a contemporary music scene. In 2009, took place the first Yemeni Rap public festival, co-sponsored by the French and German foreign-missions. Due to the importance of this event, AJ draws a comparison between it and the fall of the Berlin Wall.

<text>The Elenium is a series of fantasy novels by American writer David Eddings. The series consists of three volumes: &quot;The Diamond Throne&quot;, &quot;The Ruby Knight&quot;, and &quot;The Sapphire Rose&quot;. The series is followed by &quot;The Tamuli&quot;. &quot;The Elenium&quot; is Eddings&#x27; third fantasy series.

==&quot;The Diamond Throne&quot;==
Sparhawk, a Pandion Knight, has returned to his hometown Cimmura after ten years of exile in Rendor.

He finds his Queen and former pupil, Ehlana, has fallen ill, having been poisoned. Queen Ehlana has been encased in diamond by magic performed by Sephrenia, the Styric tutor of magic to the Pandion Knights. The diamond will keep Queen Ehlana alive for up to 12 months while a cure is found.

To aid him on his quest, Sparhawk takes his childhood friend and fellow Pandion Knight Kalten, his squire Kurik, and Sephrenia. In a show of unity, the other three Church Knight Orders also send their champions to be his companions: Genidian Knight Ulath of Thalesia, Alcione Knight Tynian of Deira, and Cyrinic Knight Bevier of Arcium.

The company is also joined by Talen, a wayward, young and gifted thief, and by a mysterious little girl, named Flute, who is quite a bit more than she seems. The novel ends after Sparhawk, Kurik, Sephrenia, and Flute return to Rendor and discover the only way to cure Ehlana is with magic. It is in this book that Sparhawk first hears the word Bhelliom.
==&quot;The Ruby Knight&quot;==

Sir Sparhawk and his companions seek the Bhelliom, a powerful magical artifact in the form of a sapphire carved in the shape of a rose, the only object with enough power to cure the rare poison administered to Queen Ehlana. The Bhelliom was last known to have been mounted on the crown of the Thalesian King Sarak.

The characters travel to the house of Count Ghasek whose sister is ill, as her soul was stolen by Azash, an Elder God of Styricum, whose spirit was confined in a clay idol. Sephrenia and the others manage to cure Lady Belina, though she has been rendered hopelessly mad by destroying the idol which was controlling her power. The Count then tells them about the giant&#x27;s mound where King Sarak was buried.

After finding King Sarak&#x27;s grave they learn that the crown had not been buried with him. They encounter a serf who tells them about the great battle which killed the King and how the Earl of Heid retrieved the fallen King&#x27;s crown and cast it into the dark murky waters of Lake Randera.

The search for Bhelliom suffers a setback when Ghwerig, the deformed dwarf troll who originally carved the gem into the shape of a rose, retrieves the Bhelliom first after his own centuries-long search to reclaim his beloved gem.

Sparhawk and his companions follow Ghwerig to his secret cave hidden in the mountains of Thalesia. The book ends with Sparhawk and his squire Kurik giving Ghwerig fatal injuries. Ghwerig then intentionally rolls off a cliff into a chasm, Bhelliom still clutched in his hand. The girl Flute dives into the chasm only to rise out again with the Bhelliom and depositing it into Sparhawk&#x27;s hands, thereby revealing her true identity as Aphrael, Child-Goddess of Styricum.

==&quot;The Sapphire Rose&quot;==

Sparhawk now has possession of the Bhelliom, so he returns to Cimmura and uses it to cure Queen Ehlana. Unfortunately, when returning the symbolic ring of the monarchy to her, she, perhaps deliberately, mistakes his action for a marriage proposal. The engagement has been publicly announced before he has had time to clarify this - although it seems unlikely that Ehlana would have been willing to break the engagement anyway. After curing the Queen of her illness, the knights ride for Chyrellos to prevent the Primate of Cimmura from ascending the throne of Archprelate. An enormous army lays siege to the Holy City.

Meanwhile, the evil God Azash and his servant, Otha, have been massing their forces along the eastern border of Eosia in preparation for an invasion of the west. Sparhawk decides, after consultation with his superiors in the Church, to take Bhelliom and travel to Zemoch with several others, with the intention of destroying Azash.

They reach the city of Zemoch, and find the temple which contains the mud idol to which Azash is confined. By a slightly odd mixture of subtlety and brute force, they gain access to the inner room - but not without the loss of Kurik, Sparhawk&#x27;s squire and friend. Sparhawk duels with Martel, another of Azash&#x27;s accomplices, and kills him; he then goes on to destroy Azash himself, who takes Otha and Annias with him.

The end of the series comes to a close with the birth of Sparhawk&#x27;s daughter Danae, who reveals herself to be Aphrael.
==Special release==

<text>Shijiazhuang is the capital and most populous city of China&#x27;s Hebei Province. A prefecture-level city southwest of Beijing, it administers eight districts, three county-level cities and eleven counties, and is east of the Taihang Mountains, which extend over from north to south with an average elevation of .

At the 2020 census, the city had a population of 11,235,086, with 6,230,709 in the built-up area comprising all urban districts except Jingxing District and Zhengding County, the twelfth largest in mainland China.

Shijiazhuang experienced dramatic growth after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. The population of the metropolitan area has more than quadrupled in thirty years as a result of industrialization and infrastructural developments. From 2008 to 2011, Shijiazhuang implemented a three-year plan, resulting in an increase of green areas and new buildings and roads. A railway station, airport and subway system have been opened.

==Name==
The city&#x27;s present name, Shijiazhuang (), first appeared during the Ming dynasty. Its literal meaning is &quot;Shi family&#x27;s village&quot;. The word Shijiazhuang was generally used after construction of the Shijiazhuang station of the Zhengtai Railway in 1907.

The origin of the name is heavily disputed. One story claimed that the Wanli Emperor sent 24 officers and their families to the area, after which the group splits into two settlements consisting of 10 and 14 families. The imperial court then named the settlements &quot;village of 10 families&quot; () and &quot;village of 14 families&quot; (十四家庄), respectively. Since the Chinese characters for ten () and stone () are homophones, it is speculated that the city name gradually evolved into its current spelling. Another explanation is that the settlement was named after the highest-ranking official amongst the groups, who was surnamed Shi. However, a county named Shiyi (), in present-day Luquan District, was already present during the Warring States period, suggesting that the name, or its elements, have even older origins.

At first, the settlement was officially known only as &quot;Shijia&quot;, as the &quot;zhuang&quot; was solely used to denote the nature of the settlement being a village, instead of being part of its name. This was further evidenced on June 24, 1925, when the Republican government ordered the village to be established as an autonomous city under the name Shijia. The city ended up being renamed as Shimen () when it was officially incorporated on August 29, 1925, after the merger with another village, Xiumen (). Despite being renamed, however, many documents and war plans from the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War still referred to the city as &quot;Shijiazhuang&quot; or &quot;Shizhuang&quot;. To avoid confusion and association with the Japanese Army, the Chinese Communist Party ultimately reverted the city&#x27;s name back to Shijiazhuang on December 26, 1947. Since then, many terms regarding the city have been stemmed from the &quot;zhuang&quot; suffix, including its nickname &quot;international village&quot; (), and the colloquial demonym, &quot;villagers&quot; (). Jokingly, people also call it &quot;Sky Home Town&quot; or &quot;Rocksville&quot; from its Chinese translating into English.

==History==
===Pre-Qin period===

This area was occupied by Xianyu people at beginning of Zhou dynasty; it later belonged to the Zhongshan (中山國) and Zhao states during the pre-Qin period.

===Qin and Han dynasties===
In pre-Han times (i.e., before 206 BC), the site of the city of Shiyi in the state of Zhao was located in this area. After taking over Zhao, Qin Shi Huang established the Hengshan Commandery in the region. It became part of the Zhao Principality under Western Han. The land was briefly granted to Liu Buyi (), son of the Emperor Hui, during Empress Dowager Lü&#x27;s reign. The territory was then passed to Liu Hong, Emperor Houshao of Han, after Buyi&#x27;s death. It was then granted to Liu Chao (), another son of Emperor Hui. During the defeat of the Lü clan, Liu Chao was killed and the territory became a commandery of Zhao once again. Later, due to a naming taboo of Emperor Wen of Han, whose personal name is Liu Heng, its name was changed to Changshan (常山). From Han (206 BC–AD 220) to Sui (581–618) times it was the site of a county seat named Shiyi.

===Tang dynasty===
With the reorganization of local government in the early period of the Tang dynasty (618–907), Hengshan county was abolished, and it was reestablished as a prefecture. It was renamed as Zhen Prefecture due to a naming taboo with Emperor Muzong of Tang, whose personal name was Li Heng.

===Yuan and Song dynasties===
Zhending was a giant city in the area, now Zhengding county, where was destination of migration from Yuan dynasty people and central area of preceding Northern Song dynasty people, particularly in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou etc. Marco Polo has glanced the city and noted it in his book.

===Ming and Qing dynasties===
The name &quot;Shijiazhuang&quot; was first mentioned in 1535 on a stele of a local temple. Shijiazhuang was then little more than a local market town, subordinated to the flourishing city of Zhengding a few miles to the north.

===Republican era===

The growth of Shijiazhuang into one of China&#x27;s major cities began in 1905, when the Beijing–Wuhan (Hankou) railway reached the area, stimulating trade and encouraging local farmers to grow cash crops. Two years later the town became the junction for the new Shitai line, running from Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan, Shanxi. The connection transformed the town from a local collecting center and market into a communications center of national importance on the main route from Beijing and Tianjin to Shanxi, and later, when the railway from Taiyuan was extended to the southwest, to Shaanxi as well. The city also became the center of an extensive road network.

Pre-World War II, Shijiazhuang was a large railway town as well as a commercial and collecting center for Shanxi and regions farther west and for agricultural produce of the North China Plain, particularly grain, tobacco, and cotton. By 1935, it had far outstripped Zhengding as an economic center. At the end of World War II the character of the city changed when it took on an administrative role as the preeminent city in western Hebei, and developed into an industrial city. Some industries, such as match manufacturing, tobacco processing, and glassmaking, had already been established before the war. By 1941, Shide railway line was constructed between Shijiazhuang and Dezhou, Shandong in the war occupied period, operated by North China Transportation Company.

On November 12, 1947, the city was captured by Communist forces. Xibaipo, a village about from downtown Shijiazhuang, in Pingshan County was the location of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the headquarters of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army during the decisive stages of the Chinese Civil War between May 26, 1948, and March 23, 1949, at which point they were moved to Beijing. Today, the area is a memorial site.

===People&#x27;s Republic===
Since the city was pivotal to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s victory of the Chinese Civil War, many governmental agencies have roots in Shijiazhuang. The creation of the North China People&#x27;s Government in 1947 affirmed the city&#x27;s position as a key political center. A year later, as the result of the merger between the Bank of North China, the Bank of Beihai, and the Northwest Agricultural Bank, the People&#x27;s Bank of China was established here, where it produced and released the first series of the renminbi.

Meanwhile, the industrialization of the city also gathered momentum thanks to government initiatives including the First Five-Year Plan. Shijiazhuang was one of the fourteen cities selected as focus cities for development. The population more than tripled in the decade 1948–58 after Communist won the civil war. In the 1950s, the city experienced a major expansion in the textile industry, with large-scale cotton spinning, weaving, printing, and dyeing works. In addition, there are plants processing local farm produce. In the 1960s it was the site of a new chemical industry, with plants producing fertilizer and caustic soda. Shijiazhuang also became an engineering base, with a tractor-accessory plant. There are important coal deposits at Jingxing and Huailu, now named Luquan, a few miles to the west in the foothills of the Taihang Mountains, which provide fuel for a thermal-generating plant supplying power to local industries.

Tianjin was again carved out of Hebei in 1967, remaining a separate entity today. The provincial capital was then moved to Baoding, however, the city was plunged into chaos due to the Cultural Revolution just a year later. Thus, under the direction of Mao Zedong to &quot;prepare for war and natural disasters&quot;, Shijiazhuang became the provincial capital in 1968.

Beginning in the 1990s, Shijiazhuang saw another episode of rapid growth and development. Starting from the plains area in the east and south of the city, the focus of the developments later shifted towards the mountainous districts and counties in the west, as well as along the Hutuo River in the north.

In the early hours of March 16, 2001, four apartment buildings were leveled after a series of explosions rocked the city, killing 108 while injuring 38. The perpetrator was a deaf, unemployed man named Jin Ruchao who police arrested weeks later. Jin confessed that he had delivered the bombs via taxi and stated that the bombings were an act of revenge on his relatives, who were among the tenants of the apartments. Jin and his accomplices were later executed.

In December 2020, its mayor, Deng Peiran, was charged with corruption, with Ma Yujun currently serving as the acting mayor. A few weeks later, the city became a new COVID-19 hotspot: starting from the village of Xiaoguozhuang in Gaocheng District in the northern portion of the city, cases has been increasing rapidly since January 2, 2021. Due to its proximity with Beijing and the severity of the outbreak, harsh measures were put into place, with all 11 million residences undergoing mandatory testing, as well as school closures, banning of gatherings, and residential districts being sealed. All highways were blocked off, with rail and air links also suspended.

Throughout the years, the city&#x27;s administrative units have been shifted and adjusted multiple times. Initially, Shijiazhuang was administered under the prefecture of the same name, along with the counties of Zhengding, Pingshan, Lingshou, Jingxing, Jianping, Huailu, Jinxian, Gaocheng, Luancheng, Zhaoxian, Shulu, Yuanshi, Zanhuang, Gaoyi, and one town, Xinji. The first new district of the city, Jingxing Mining District, was created on June 27, 1950. On November 7, 1952, Hengshui Prefecture, to the east, was merged into Shijiazhuang, adding six more counties. The prefecture continued to expand after Dingxian Prefecture was split and merged into Baoding and Shijiazhuang on June 18, 1954. Between March 1960 and May 1961, the prefecture and the city merged. Thereafter, however, the prefecture was re-established, with Hengshui Prefecture splitting away the next year. The city and its prefecture merged for good in June 1993. In the 2010s, Shijiazhuang&#x27;s administrative divisions saw further changes. In 2013, the county-level city of Xinji, although still part of Shijiazhuang prefecture, is now directly administered by Hebei province. Later, the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China approved more adjustments to the city&#x27;s divisions. Qiaodong District was dissolved and merged into Chang&#x27;an and Qiaoxi districts. Three county-level cities, Gaocheng, Luquan, and Luancheng, became urban districts.

==Geography==

Shijiazhuang is located in south-central Hebei, and is part of the Bohai Economic Rim. Its administrative area ranges in latitude from 37° 27&#x27; to 38° 47&#x27; N, and the longitude 113° 30&#x27; to 115° 20&#x27; E. The prefecture-level city reaches a north–south extent and a wide from east to west. The prefecture has borders stretching long and covers an area of . Bordering prefecture-level cities in Hebei are Hengshui (E), Xingtai (S), and Baoding (N/NE). To the west lies the province of Shanxi.

The city stands at the edge of the North China Plain, which rises to the Taihang Mountains to the west of the city, and lies south of the Hutuo River. From west to east, the topography can be summarised as moderately high mountains, then low-lying mountains, hills, basin, and finally plains. Out of the eight east–west routes across the Taihang Mountains, the fifth, the Niangzi Pass, connects the city directly with Taiyuan, Shanxi.

The mountainous part of the prefecture consists of parts of:
*Jingxing Mining District
*Jingxing County
*Zanhuang County
*Xingtang County
*Lingshou County
*Yuanshi County
*Luquan District

The Hutuo River Basin in the east juts into: 
*Xinle City
*Wuji County
*Shenze County
*Jinzhou City
*Gaocheng District
*Gaoyi County
*Zhao County
*Luancheng District
*Zhengding County
*The metropolitan area and its suburbs, in their entirety
*All of the divisions mentioned in the above list, except for Jingxing Mining District

==Climate==
The city has a continental, monsoon-influenced semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk / Dwa&quot;), characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, very dry winters that reflect the influence of the Siberian anticyclone. Spring can see sandstorms blowing in from the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn is similar to spring in temperature and lack of rainfall. January averages , while July averages ; the annual mean is . With the monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 38 percent in July to 56 percent in May, the city receives 2,163 hours of sunshine annually. More than half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August alone. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from to .

===Air quality===

According to the National Environmental Analysis released by Tsinghua University and The Asian Development Bank in January 2013, Shijiazhuang was one of ten most air-polluted cities in the world. Also according to this report, 7 of 10 most air-polluted cities are in China, including Taiyuan, Beijing, Urumqi, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Jinan and Shijiazhuang. As air pollution in China is at an all-time high, several northern cities are among the most polluted cities and have some of the worst air quality in China. Reporting on China&#x27;s air quality has been accompanied by what seems like a monochromatic slideshow of the country&#x27;s several cities smothered in thick smog. According to a survey made by &quot;Global voices China&quot; in February 2013, Shijiazhuang is among China&#x27;s 10 most polluted cities along with other cities including major Chinese cities like Beijing and Zhengzhou, and 6 other prefectural cities all in Hebei. These cities are all situated in traditional geographic subdivision of &quot;Huabei (North China) Region&quot;.

In 2020, annual average PM2.5 Air Pollution in Shijiazhuang stood at 56 μg/m3, which is 11.2 times the World Health Organization PM2.5 Guideline (5 μg/m3: set in September 2021). These pollution levels are estimated to reduce the Life Expectancy of an average person living in Shijiazhuang by almost 5 years.

A dense wave of smog began in the Central and Eastern part of China on December 2, 2013, across a distance of around , including Shijiazhuang and surrounding areas. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in North China region. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China&#x27;s east coast.

Shijiazhuang has direct administrative jurisdiction over:

== Demographics ==
Migrants flowing in from all across China largely contributed to the population growth of Shijiazhuang in recent times. With a population of 120,000 in 1947, Shijiazhuang became the first medium-large city captured by the Chinese Communist Party from the Kuomintang. By the time of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s founding in 1949, the total urban population increased to more than 270,000 people, more than doubling in a span of two years. In 1953, when China rolled out its first five-year plan, the total population of Shijiazhuang&#x27;s urban area increased to 320,000. In 1960, the total population of the Shijiazhuang urban area had reached 650,000. In 1968, the city experienced a substantial increase due to it being designated the capital of Hebei to avoid chaos in Baoding amidst the Cultural Revolution. By 1980, the urban population had surpassed the one million mark, joining the ranks of a large city. As of the end of 2017, the urban population of Shijiazhuang exceeded 4.5 million.

In just six decades, the city&#x27;s population has increased by more than 20 fold. At the end of 2009, the city&#x27;s total non-migrant population was 9,774,100, an increase of 109,300 over the previous year. The birth rate of the city&#x27;s population is 14.65%, the death rate is 6.25%, and the natural growth rate is 8.4%.

According to the sixth national census in 2010, the city&#x27;s total non-migrant population stands at 10,163,788. Compared with the fifth national census a decade prior, there was an increase of 818,365 people, or an increase of 8.76%, and an average annual growth rate of 0.84%. Among them, the male population stood at 5,087,913, accounting for 50.06% of the total population; the female population is 5,075,875, accounting for 49.94% of the total population. The gender ratio of the total population is 100 women per 100.24 men. The population aged between 0 and 14 is 1,548,125, accounting for 15.23% of the total population; the population aged between 15 and 64 is 7,789,753, accounting for 76.64% of the total population; the population aged 65 and over is 825,910, accounting for 8.13% of the total population.

The top 10 surnames of Shijiazhuang are: Zhang (10.27%), Wang (9.25%), Li (9.17%), Liu (6.73%), Zhao (4.28%), Yang (2.82%), Gao (2.08%), Chen (1.92%), Ma (1.77%), and Guo (1.55%).

On May 6, 2011, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences published the &quot;2011 China Urban Competitiveness Blue Book: China Urban Competitiveness Report&quot;. In it, the happiness survey sampled 294 cities across China, arriving at the conclusion that the residents of Shijiazhuang were the happiest. This result caused strong doubts from netizens.

== Economy ==
In 2014, the GDP of Shijiazhuang reached CN¥510.02 billion (about $80.45 billion in USD), an increase of 12 percent over the previous year, and placing the city 20th in provincial capitals by GDP.

Shijiazhuang has become a major industrial city in North China and is considered to be the economic center of Hebei province, along with Tangshan. The city also located in Beijing-Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Hi-Tech Industrial Belt, which is one of the main Hi-Tech Belts in China. Nicknamed the &quot;medicine hub of China&quot;, it is home to major pharmaceutical companies and factories like the North China Pharmaceutical Group Corporation, Shijiazhuang Pharma Group, and Shineway Pharma. The textile industry is also one of the backbones of the city&#x27;s commerce. Other sectors include machinery and chemicals such as Shijiazhuang Donghua Jinlong, building materials, light industry, and electronics. With abundant agricultural resources, Shijiazhuang has 590,000 hectares of cultivated land and is the main source of cotton, pears, dates and walnuts in Hebei province.

In 2008, total imports reached US$1.393 billion, an increase of 42.1 percent over the previous year. Exports increased by 34.9 percent to US$5.596 billion. 

2006 World Bank reported that Shijiazhuang was spending less than RMB400 per capita on education, as opposed to Beijing (RMB1,044) and Weihai (RMB1,631).

===Development zones===
*Shijiazhuang High-Tech Industrial Development Zone
The zone was established in March 1991 as a state-level development zone and is divided into three districts. National highways 107, 207, 307, 308 pass through the zone. It is away from Shijiazhuang railway station, away from Tianjin Port. Industries include pharmaceuticals, electronic information, mechanical production, automobile manufacturing, chemicals production and logistics.

The Eastern District, located in the eastern part of Shijiazhuang, covers an area of , and serves as the primary section of the New High-tech Industrial Development Zone. The district focuses on the establishment of new high-tech enterprises. There are plans to expand the district into an area of . A railway line operated by Shijiazhuang Oil Refinery runs through the zone from north to south, so enterprises in the zone can build lines of their own.

The Western District, located in the southwest of Shijiazhuang, covers an area of . It focuses on small- and medium-sized technology enterprises and technology incubation. Liangcun District, which borders the Western District, covers , and focuses on the pharmaceutical industry and the petrochemical industry. 

By 2009, some 2,600 enterprises had settled in the zone, of which 185 were foreign-funded enterprises. Firms from Japan, the US, the Republic of Korea, Germany, Italy, Canada, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan had established themselves in the zone.

===Dairy===
The city is a center for the dairy trade, being the headquarters of the Sanlu Group. Sanlu became Shijiazhuang&#x27;s largest taxpayer since it had become the largest formula seller in China for a continuous 15-year period. Richard McGregor, author of &quot;The Party: The Secret World of China&#x27;s Communist Rulers&quot;, said that Sanlu became &quot;an invaluable asset for a city otherwise struggling to attract industry and investment on a par with China&#x27;s premier metropolises.&quot;

Both the dairy trade and Sanlu were affected by the 2008 Chinese milk scandal. The chairman and general manager of Sanlu, and several party officials, including the vice-mayor in charge of food and agriculture, Zhang Fawang, were reportedly removed from office. Mayor Ji Chuntang reportedly resigned on September 17, 2008.

==Transportation==
===Expressways===
The city is served by many expressways, including the Shitai, Beijing–Shenzhen and Taiyuan–Cangzhou Expressways.

===Railway===

Shijiazhuang is a transportation hub at the intersection point of the Beijing–Guangzhou, Taiyuan–Dezhou, and Shuozhou–Huanghua railways. The new Shijiazhuang railway station (opened December 2012) has a rare distinction of being served by both the &quot;conventional&quot; Beijing–Guangzhou Railway and the new Beijing–Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong High-Speed Railway. Such an arrangement is fairly uncommon on China&#x27;s high-speed rail network, as typically high-speed lines are constructed to bypass city cores, where the older &quot;conventional&quot; train stations are.

In Shijiazhuang&#x27;s case, to make it possible to bring the new high-speed railway into the central city, a long railway tunnel was constructed under the city. This is the first time a high-speed railway has been run &quot;under&quot; a Chinese city.

There is also the smaller Shijiazhuang North railway station, used by trains going west toward Taiyuan without the need for passing though downtown.

===Metro===

Line 1, Line 2 and Line 3 of the Shijiazhuang Metro are currently operational. The system is in length. The latest metro plan of Shijiazhuang includes 6 lines in total.

===Airport===
The Shijiazhuang Zhengding International Airport is the province&#x27;s center of air transportation. It is about 30 kilometers northeast of the city. There are 32 domestic routes arriving at and departing from Shijiazhuang, including destinations such as Shanghai, Shenzhen and Dalian. The airport serves 12 international destinations including four routes to Russia. The airport is being expanded and will be capable of being an alternate airport to Beijing Capital International Airport.

With the opening of the Beijing–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway at the end of 2012, the airport got its own train station, making available fast, although infrequent, train service between the airport and Shijiazhuang railway station, as well as other stations in the region.

===Cycling===
Most large roads in the city feature a separate cycle lane and, combined with the city being flat, make it ideal for cycling. Thousands of cyclists use the city each day and often there are more cyclists waiting at a crossroad than cars.

== Military ==
Shijiazhuang is headquarters of the 27th Group Army of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, one of the three group armies that comprise the Beijing Military Region responsible for defending China&#x27;s capital.

== Culture ==

===City centre===

The city of Shijiazhuang is similar to Beijing in that all roads run from north to south and east to west, making the city easy to navigate. Many roads have cycle paths making it cyclist friendly. In the heart of the city is the Hebei Museum which was refurbished in 2013 and 2014. It holds regular events, mostly showing traditional Chinese art and artifacts. The Yutong International Sports Centre hosts the Shijiazhuang Ever Bright football matches as well as holding pop concerts.

Shijiazhuang Zoo is located on the west side of the city. The zoo has 3,000 animals of 250 species including flamingos, golden monkeys, manchurian tigers, Indian elephants, giraffes, chimpanzees, kangaroos, seals, white tigers, springboks and pandas. Near the Shijiazhuang Zoo are the Botanical Gardens (), offering a range of exotic and native plants both to view and purchase. The Martyrs Memorial () can be found in the centre of the city, commemorating the soldiers lost in war.

===Main sights===

Baodu Zhai (), or Baodu Village, is an ancient fortified hilltop settlement located on the west side of the city, the mountain contains walks and buddhist statues. Close to Baodu Zhai is Fenglong Mountain () is situated outside of Shijiazhuang to the west, the mountain features walks and a large stone Buddha statue situated on top of the mountain. Mount Cangyan () is a scenic area in Jingxing County, famous for its combination of natural mountain scenery with historical man-made structures.

<text>HMS &quot;Montrose&quot; has been the name of two ships of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy:
* , a &quot;Scott&quot;-class (or Admiralty-type) destroyer leader that served throughout World War II and was scrapped in 1946.
* , a Type 23 frigate launched in 1992 and retired in April 2023.

Although there have only been two operational vessels of the Royal Navy named &quot;Montrose&quot;, traditionally the tender attached to the Tay Division of the Royal Naval Reserve in Dundee was renamed as HMS &quot;Montrose&quot; in honour of the 6th duke, who was instrumental in the original formation of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1903.

<text>The Fillmore is a historic music venue in San Francisco, California.

Built in 1912 and originally named the Majestic Hall, it became the Fillmore Auditorium in 1954. It is in Western Addition, on the edge of the Fillmore District and Upper Fillmore neighborhood.

Since 2007, it has been operated by Live Nation, which has since named new clubs and renamed existing ones after the Fillmore.

==History==
The building which became The Fillmore was built in 1912 and initially housed the Majestic Hall and Academy of Dancing.&lt;ref name=&quot;chs/Ephemera&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Its name was changed from the Majestic Hall in 1936 to the Ambassador Dance Hall. From 1939 to 1952, it operated as the Ambassador Roller Skating Rink. 

&quot;In 1954, Sullivan took over the lease on a dilapidated dance hall and roller rink named the Majestic Ballroom and christened it the Fillmore Auditorium, hosting integrated dances and booking the biggest names in Black music.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate/17830364&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; - SFGate

In 1954, Charles Sullivan, one of the most successful African-American businessmen in San Francisco at the time, started booking bands and renamed the venue The Fillmore Auditorium. He was the first to allow black attendees there. Charles became the most successful concert promoter on the west coast introducing the biggest black acts to the San Francisco concert scene, such as James Brown, Ike &amp; Tina, Louis Armstrong, Jimi Hendrix, Billie Holiday, and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;kqed/sullivan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1965, Sullivan let Bill Graham use his dance hall permit to book a benefit for the San Francisco Mime Troupe. After that Graham continued to book shows there on dates Sullivan wasn’t using the space. In their contract agreement it was stated that Graham would take over the Fillmore if anything unforeseen happened to Sullivan. Sullivan was found shot to death in the early morning hours of 2 August 1966, at the age of 57,&lt;ref name=&quot;chs/1967/Sullivan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the case was never solved even after Senator Diane Feinstein’s attempt to reopen the investigation. 

On May 27, 28, and 29, 1966, The Velvet Underground and Nico played the Fillmore Auditorium as part of Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Exploding Plastic Inevitable&quot; avant-garde multimedia show. Their light show engineer Danny Williams, who pioneered many of today&#x27;s standard practices in rock music light shows, built a light system at the Fillmore that included stroboscopes, slides and film projections onstage. The system was partially inspired by Jonas Mekas&#x27; earlier film projections at concerts held at The Cinematheque in New York. As conceived by Warhol and Williams, the show also included wild, free dancing both in the crowd and onstage. Although The Velvet Underground&#x27;s proto-punk aesthetics failed to resonate with the incipient San Francisco counterculture, Graham retained Williams to build additional light systems. These innovations were to become part of the Fillmore Auditorium&#x27;s prestige and image and served as the basis for the systems subsequently used at the Fillmore East and Fillmore West venues.

In the mid-1960s, the Fillmore Auditorium became the focal point for psychedelic music and the counterculture in general, with such acts as the Grateful Dead, the Steve Miller Band, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Moby Grape, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Byrds, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Santana, Frank Zappa&#x27;s the Mothers of Invention, and British acts the Who, Cream, and Pink Floyd all performing at the venue. Besides rock, Graham also featured non-rock acts such as Lenny Bruce, Miles Davis, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Charles Lloyd, Aretha Franklin, and Otis Redding as well as poetry readings. The Grateful Dead played a total of 51 concerts at the venue from 1965 through 1969.

B.B. King&#x27;s well-received performances at the venue served to introduce many fans to the authentic sounds that inspired the blues rock subgenre. He subsequently became a countercultural icon, appearing at many rock festivals. Albert King also played a series of well-received shows here in 1968, with one of them being released as his first live album &quot;Live/Wire Blues.&quot; Eventually, two additional shows would be released as &quot;Wednesday Night in San Francisco&quot; and &quot;Thursday Night in San Francisco.&quot;

The venue was known for its ambience as well as for the musical performances, often with swirling light-show projections, strobe lights and uninhibited dancing. The cultural impact of the Fillmore was very large. It is referenced by Hunter S. Thompson in his 1971 novel &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; in a description of the counterculture of the 1960s in the San Francisco Bay Area.

==Fillmore West, Fillmore East and the New Old Fillmore==
In the summer of 1968, the continuing socioeconomic deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood and the modest capacity of the venue compelled Graham to abandon the Fillmore Auditorium only two years after his famous association with the venue commenced. That July, he assumed ownership of the Carousel Ballroom at nearby 10 South Van Ness Avenue. The venue had been previously managed as a cooperative venture for several months by the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and other Bay Area groups. The Carousel subsequently operated as the Fillmore West, paralleling Graham&#x27;s Fillmore East in New York City&#x27;s East Village. However, both venues were shuttered by Graham in July 1971 as arena bookings on popular music tours became increasingly prevalent.

For an indeterminate period from 1969 to 1970, the Fillmore Auditorium was operated by new management as the New Old Fillmore; during this period, the Grateful Dead and The Stooges performed notable engagements at the venue.

==The Elite Club==
The original Fillmore location became a venue called The Elite Club. For several years in the early 1980s, punk promoters Paul Rat and Wes Robinson booked punk rock shows at this venue. Punk bands that performed at The Elite Club include Crucifix, Discharge, 45 Grave, FEAR, D.O.A, Verbal Abuse, Social Distortion, Bad Religion, Black Flag, Bad Brains, Dead Kennedys, Red Rockers, T.S.O.L., Flipper, Gang of Four, and Public Image Ltd.

==Reopening and national franchise==
The Fillmore reopened under Graham&#x27;s management in the mid-1980s, but it was damaged and closed by the Loma Prieta earthquake of October 1989. After Graham died in a helicopter crash in 1991, those close to him decided to carry out his final wish to retrofit and reopen the original Fillmore, which required much structural work. The Fillmore reopened on April 27, 1994, with the band The Smashing Pumpkins playing an unannounced surprise show, and Primus playing the first official reopening show the following night. The Fillmore has once again become a San Francisco hot spot with frequent shows. For a standard show, the capacity of the Fillmore is 1,315 guests.

Since 2007, the Fillmore is leased and operated by Live Nation. 

Live Nation has since named several of its existing and new clubs after the Fillmore. This includes clubs in Denver, Detroit, Philadelphia, and the Fillmore at the Jackie Gleason Theater in Miami Beach, Florida. The Fillmore Charlotte opened in June 2009. A Fillmore in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Silver Spring, Maryland, broke ground in 2010 and opened in late 2011. The 2,000-seat Fillmore New Orleans opened in 2019 on the second floor of Harrah&#x27;s New Orleans casino. The Central, Minneapolis Fillmore venue opened in February 2020.

The Fillmore brand was also attached to Irving Plaza in New York City from 2007 to 2010.

==Traditions==

The Fillmore is also well known for its psychedelic concert posters by artists who in the 1960s included Wes Wilson and Rick Griffin. Copies of the night&#x27;s poster are given to fans free of charge as they exit selected, sold-out shows. A curated collection of these posters is on display in the mezzanine level of the auditorium today.

Other traditions are carried on to this day at the Fillmore in San Francisco. One is a large tub of free apples for concert goers positioned near the entrance. Another is a &quot;greeter&quot; who welcomes each guest as they enter with: &quot;Welcome to the Fillmore!&quot;

<text>Nellie Letitia McClung (; 20 October 18731 September 1951) was a Canadian author, politician, and social activist, who is regarded as one of Canada&#x27;s most prominent suffragists. She began her career in writing with the 1908 book &quot;Sowing Seeds in Danny&quot;, and would eventually publish sixteen books, including two autobiographies. She played a leading role in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in Canada, helping to grant women the vote in Alberta and Manitoba in 1916. McClung was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in 1921, where she served until 1926.

As a member of the Famous Five, she was one of five women who took the Persons Case first to the Supreme Court of Canada, and then to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, for the right of women to serve in the Senate of Canada. McClung was the first woman appointed to the board of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1936. She served as a delegate to the League of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland in 1938.

== Early life ==

McClung was born Nellie Letitia Mooney on 20 October 1873 in Chatsworth, Ontario, the youngest of six children of John and Letitia Mooney (née McCurdy). Her father had acquired of property in Chatsworth, but the soil was not of good quality and the family struggled to make ends meet. In 1880, when Nellie was seven, they moved to the Souris River valley, two hundred kilometers west of Winnipeg. Nellie graduated from the Manitoba Normal School when she was sixteen. After receiving her teaching certificate, she acquired a teaching position in Hazel, Manitoba, earning a salary of $40 a month. After teaching for eighteen months in Hazel, she moved to Manitou.

While teaching in Manitou, she boarded with the McClung family. She was captivated by Mrs. Annie E. McClung, a suffragist and provincial president of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. Nellie stated that Mrs. McClung was the only woman she had met that she would like as a mother-in-law. Nellie married Mrs. McClung&#x27;s son, Robert Wesley, in August 1896. They had five children between 1897 and 1911. She was involved in many local organizations, including the WCTU, the Methodist Ladies&#x27; Aid, the Epworth League, and the Home Economics Association.

== Career ==

The McClung family faced financial difficulties starting in 1905 when Wesley sold his pharmacy business. To help supplement their income, Nellie sought out paid writing work, writing short stories for magazines. She published her first novel, &quot;Sowing Seeds in Danny&quot;, in 1908. The book became a bestseller, selling 100,000 copies in Canada and the United States and making McClung $25,000 ($ in 2021). With the success of her book, McClung was invited to speak at events throughout Manitoba and Saskatchewan, launching her career as a public speaker.

McClung&#x27;s second book, &quot;A Second Chance&quot;, was published in 1910. By then, her reputation for speaking had reached Ontario, and she embarked on a tour of the province, with stops in Whitby, Hamilton, Peterborough, Kingston, Waterloo, and Toronto. Her speaking engagements were well received, with the &quot;Hamilton Herald&quot; reporting that she &quot;took her audiences by storm&quot;. McClung would go on to write three more books throughout the 1910s, including &quot;In Times Like These&quot;, which has been regarded as an important statement of first-wave feminism. Throughout her career, McClung wrote sixteen books, including two autobiographies, and many poems, short stories, and newspaper articles.

In 1911, the McClungs moved to Winnipeg, where Wesley had been offered a position as an insurance broker. The following year, McClung and fourteen other women formed the Women&#x27;s Political Equality League, an organization focused on women&#x27;s suffrage. In 1914, the league petitioned the Conservative Premier of Manitoba, Rodmond Roblin, for the right of women to vote, but their request was denied. The next day, the Political Equality League staged a &quot;Mock Parliament&quot; at the Walker Theatre, with its members imitating government ministers. McClung had the role of Roblin, and repeated many of the arguments that the Premier had made the day before:

Man is made for something higher and better than voting... Men were made to support families... Shall I call man away from the useful plow and harrow to talk loud on street corners about things which do not concern him? Politics unsettle men, and unsettled men mean unsettled billsbroken furniture, and broken vowsand divorce... When you ask for the vote you are asking me to break up peaceful, happy homesto wreck innocent lives.

McClung campaigned for the Manitoba Liberal Party in both the 1914 and 1915 general elections. The McClungs moved to Edmonton, Alberta, after Wesley was offered a promotion. The Liberal Party won the 1915 election in a landslide, and Manitoba became the first province in Canada to grant women the right to vote in January 1916 under the new Liberal government, exactly two years after the Political Equality League had petitioned Premier Roblin.

In Alberta, McClung continued to fight for temperance, healthcare, and women&#x27;s rights. In the 1921 general election, she was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for the constituency of Edmonton as a member of the Liberal Party. McClung was one of two women who were elected, the other being Irene Parlby, a member of the United Farmers. The United Farmers of Alberta formed the government, with 38 out of the possible 61 seats. McClung often broke ranks with the Liberal Party to support the more socially progressive United Farmers&#x27; legislation, working with Parlby on resolutions that benefitted women. McClung ran for office again in the 1926 general election for the constituency of Calgary, but lost by 60 votes.

McClung was one of five women, along with Irene Parlby, Henrietta Muir Edwards, Emily Murphy, and Louise McKinney, who put forward a petition in 1927 to clarify the term &quot;persons&quot; in the British North America Act 1867, and determine the eligibility of women to serve in the Senate of Canada. The case called &quot;Edwards v Canada&quot; (also known as the &quot;Persons Case&quot;), was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled that women were not &quot;qualified persons&quot; and thus were ineligible to serve in the Senate. The ruling was appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which at that time was Canada&#x27;s highest court. In 1929, the Judicial Committee overturned the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, and the first woman, Cairine Wilson, was appointed to the Senate the following year.

McClung was appointed to the board of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in 1936 by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, the first woman to serve on its board. King invited her in 1938 to serve as a delegate to the League of Nations in Geneva. McClung felt that the League was &quot;bogged down by purposeless disputation and empty speeches&quot;, and that many delegates cared more about getting credit than working towards a meaningful goal.

== Later life and death ==

McClung moved to Victoria, British Columbia, in 1933, where she lived for the remainder of her life. Her health deteriorated throughout the late 1930s, and she suffered a heart attack in 1940 while attending a CBC board meeting in Ottawa, which made it difficult to travel. She continued contributing to the board through correspondence until her resignation in 1942. She published the second volume of her autobiography, &quot;The Stream Runs Fast&quot;, in 1945. McClung died on 1 September 1951, at the age of 77.

== Views ==

McClung, like other members of the Famous Five, was a maternal feminist. She viewed women as &quot;morally superior&quot; to men and did not feel that traditional gender roles should be changed. Her book &quot;In Times Like These&quot; (1915) argued that women had a biological maternal instinct that made them better suited for politics than men, stating that &quot;men make wounds, and women bind them up&quot;. In 1916, she called for suffrage to be granted to Canadian and English women first, though she withdrew her suggestion when Francis Marion Beynon criticized her view in the Grain Growers&#x27; Guide.

McClung was an advocate for the eugenics movement in Alberta. She supported the Sexual Sterilization Act, which allowed &quot;mental defectives&quot; to be sterilized without free and informed consent (sometimes without their knowledge, contributing to Canada&#x27;s genocide of Indigenous people) at the recommendation of the Alberta Eugenics Board. The Act sterilized more than 2,800 people against their will and awareness from when it took effect in 1928 until it was repealed in 1972.

== Legacy ==

In 1954, McClung was named a Person of National Historic Significance by the government of Canada. A plaque commemorating McClung is located in Chatsworth, Ontario. On 29 August 1973, McClung and the other four women who were involved in the Persons Case were honoured with an 8 cent stamp. In addition, the Persons Case was recognized as a National Historic Event in 1997. In October 2009, the Senate of Canada named Nellie McClung and the rest of the Five Canada&#x27;s first &quot;honorary senators.&quot;

McClung&#x27;s house in Calgary, Alberta, her residence from 1923 to the mid-1930s, still stands and is designated a heritage site. Two other houses in which McClung lived were relocated to the Archibald Museum near La Rivière, Manitoba in the Rural Municipality of Pembina, before being moved back to Manitou in 2017 following the museum&#x27;s closure. The houses are open to the public. The McClung family residence in Winnipeg is also a historic site.

<text>Rheumatic fever (RF) is an inflammatory disease that can involve the heart, joints, skin, and brain. The disease typically develops two to four weeks after a streptococcal throat infection. Signs and symptoms include fever, multiple painful joints, involuntary muscle movements, and occasionally a characteristic non-itchy rash known as erythema marginatum. The heart is involved in about half of the cases. Damage to the heart valves, known as rheumatic heart disease (RHD), usually occurs after repeated attacks but can sometimes occur after one. The damaged valves may result in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and infection of the valves.
Rheumatic fever may occur following an infection of the throat by the bacterium &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;. If the infection is left untreated, rheumatic fever occurs in up to three percent of people. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the production of antibodies against a person&#x27;s own tissues. Due to their genetics, some people are more likely to get the disease when exposed to the bacteria than others. Other risk factors include malnutrition and poverty. Diagnosis of RF is often based on the presence of signs and symptoms in combination with evidence of a recent streptococcal infection.
Treating people who have strep throat with antibiotics, such as penicillin, decreases the risk of developing rheumatic fever. In order to avoid antibiotic misuse this often involves testing people with sore throats for the infection; however, testing might not be available in the developing world. Other preventive measures include improved sanitation. In those with rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, prolonged periods of antibiotics are sometimes recommended. Gradual return to normal activities may occur following an attack. Once RHD develops, treatment is more difficult. Occasionally valve replacement surgery or valve repair is required. Otherwise complications are treated as usual.
Rheumatic fever occurs in about 325,000 children each year and about 33.4 million people currently have rheumatic heart disease. Those who develop RF are most often between the ages of 5 and 14, with 20% of first-time attacks occurring in adults. The disease is most common in the developing world and among indigenous peoples in the developed world. In 2015 it resulted in 319,400 deaths down from 374,000 deaths in 1990. Most deaths occur in the developing world where as many as 12.5% of people affected may die each year. Descriptions of the condition are believed to date back to at least the 5th century BCE in the writings of Hippocrates. The disease is so named because its symptoms are similar to those of some rheumatic disorders.

==Signs and symptoms==

The disease typically develops two to four weeks after a throat infection. Symptoms include: fever, painful joints with those joints affected changing with time, involuntary muscle movements, and occasionally a characteristic non-itchy rash known as erythema marginatum. The heart is involved in about half of the cases. Damage to the heart valves usually occurs only after several attacks but may occasionally occur after a single case of RF. The damaged valves may result in heart failure and also increase the risk of atrial fibrillation and infection of the valves.

==Pathophysiology==
Rheumatic fever is a systemic disease affecting the connective tissue around arterioles, and can occur after an untreated strep throat infection, specifically due to group A streptococcus (GAS), &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;. The similarity between antigens of &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; and multiple cardiac proteins can cause a life-threatening type II hypersensitivity reaction. Usually, self reactive B cells remain anergic in the periphery without T cell co-stimulation. During a streptococcal infection, mature antigen-presenting cells such as B cells present the bacterial antigen to CD4+T cells which differentiate into helper T2 cells. Helper T2 cells subsequently activate the B cells to become plasma cells and induce the production of antibodies against the cell wall of Streptococcus. However the antibodies may also react against the myocardium and joints, producing the symptoms of rheumatic fever. &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; is a species of aerobic, cocci, gram-positive bacteria that are non-motile, non-spore forming, and forms chains and large colonies.

&quot;S. pyogenes&quot; has a cell wall composed of branched polymers which sometimes contain M protein, a virulence factor that is highly antigenic. The antibodies which the immune system generates against the M protein may cross-react with heart muscle cell protein myosin, heart muscle glycogen and smooth muscle cells of arteries, inducing cytokine release and tissue destruction. However, the only proven cross-reaction is with perivascular connective tissue. This inflammation occurs through direct attachment of complement and Fc receptor-mediated recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Characteristic Aschoff bodies, composed of swollen eosinophilic collagen surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages can be seen on light microscopy. The larger macrophages may become Anitschkow cells or Aschoff giant cells. Rheumatic valvular lesions may also involve a cell-mediated immunity reaction as these lesions predominantly contain T-helper cells and macrophages.

In rheumatic fever, these lesions can be found in any layer of the heart causing different types of carditis. The inflammation may cause a serofibrinous pericardial exudate described as &quot;bread-and-butter&quot; pericarditis, which usually resolves without sequelae. Involvement of the endocardium typically results in fibrinoid necrosis and wart formation along the lines of closure of the left-sided heart valves. Warty projections arise from the deposition, while subendocardial lesions may induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques.

===Rheumatic heart disease===
Chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is characterized by repeated inflammation with fibrinous repair. The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion, and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords. It is caused by an autoimmune reaction to Group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) that results in valvular damage. Fibrosis and scarring of valve leaflets, commissures and cusps leads to abnormalities that can result in valve stenosis or regurgitation. The inflammation caused by rheumatic fever, usually during childhood, is referred to as rheumatic valvulitis. About half of patients with rheumatic fever develop inflammation involving valvular endothelium. The majority of morbidity and mortality associated with rheumatic fever is caused by its destructive effects on cardiac valve tissue. The complicated pathogenesis of RHD is not fully understood, though it has been observed to use molecular mimicry via group A streptococci carbohydrates and genetic predisposition involving HLA Class II genes that trigger autoimmune reactions.

Molecular mimicry occurs when epitopes are shared between host antigens and &quot;Streptococcus&quot; antigens. This causes an autoimmune reaction against native tissues in the heart that are incorrectly recognized as &quot;foreign&quot; due to the cross-reactivity of antibodies generated as a result of epitope sharing. The valvular endothelium is a prominent site of lymphocyte-induced damage. CD4+ T cells are the major effectors of heart tissue autoimmune reactions in RHD. Normally, T cell activation is triggered by the presentation of bacterial antigens. In RHD, molecular mimicry results in incorrect T cell activation, and these T lymphocytes can go on to activate B cells, which will begin to produce self-antigen-specific antibodies. This leads to an immune response attack mounted against tissues in the heart that have been misidentified as pathogens. Rheumatic valves display increased expression of VCAM-1, a protein that mediates the adhesion of lymphocytes. Self-antigen-specific antibodies generated via molecular mimicry between human proteins and streptococcal antigens up-regulate VCAM-1 after binding to the valvular endothelium. This leads to the inflammation and valve scarring observed in rheumatic valvulitis, mainly due to CD4+ T cell infiltration.

While the mechanisms of genetic predisposition remain unclear, a few genetic factors have been found to increase susceptibility to autoimmune reactions in RHD. The dominant contributors are a component of MHC class II molecules, found on lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells, specifically the DR and DQ alleles on human chromosome 6. Certain allele combinations appear to increase RHD autoimmune susceptibility. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II allele DR7 (HLA-DR7) is most often associated with RHD, and its combination with certain DQ alleles is seemingly associated with the development of valvular lesions. The mechanism by which MHC class II molecules increase a host&#x27;s susceptibility to autoimmune reactions in RHD is unknown, but it is likely related to the role HLA molecules play in presenting antigens to T cell receptors, thus triggering an immune response. Also found on human chromosome 6 is the cytokine TNF-α which is also associated with RHD. High expression levels of TNF-α may exacerbate valvular tissue inflammation, because as this cytokine circulates in the bloodstream, it triggers the activation of multiple pathways that stimulate further pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an inflammatory protein involved in pathogen recognition. Different variants of &quot;MBL2&quot; gene regions are associated with RHD. RHD-induced mitral valve stenosis has been associated with &quot;MBL2&quot; alleles encoding for high production of MBL. Aortic valve regurgitation in RHD patients has been associated with different &quot;MBL2&quot; alleles that encode for low production of MBL. In addition, the allele IGHV4-61, located on chromosome 14, which helps code for the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) is linked to greater susceptibility to RHD because it may affect protein structure of the IgH. Other genes are also being investigated to better understand the complexity of autoimmune reactions that occur in RHD.

==Diagnosis==
The original method of diagnosing rheumatic heart disease was through heart auscultation, specifically listening for the sound of blood regurgitation from possibly dysfunctional valves. However, studies have shown that echocardiography is much more efficient in detecting RHD due to its high sensitivity. An echocardiogram has the ability to detect signs of RHD before the development of more obvious symptoms such as tissue scarring and stenosis. Modified Jones criteria were first published in 1944 by T. Duckett Jones, MD. They have been periodically revised by the American Heart Association in collaboration with other groups. According to revised Jones criteria, the diagnosis of rheumatic fever can be made when two of the major criteria, or one major criterion plus two minor criteria, are present along with evidence of streptococcal infection: elevated or rising antistreptolysin O titre or anti-DNase B. A recurrent episode can be diagnosed when three minor criteria are present. Exceptions are chorea and indolent carditis, each of which by itself can indicate rheumatic fever. An April 2013 review article in the &quot;Indian Journal of Medical Research&quot; stated that echocardiographic and Doppler (E &amp; D) studies, despite some reservations about their utility, have identified a massive burden of rheumatic heart disease, which suggests the inadequacy of the 1992 Jones&#x27; criteria. E &amp; D studies have identified subclinical carditis in patients with rheumatic fever, as well as in follow-ups of rheumatic heart disease patients who initially presented as having isolated cases of Sydenham&#x27;s chorea. Signs of a preceding streptococcal infection include: recent scarlet fever, raised antistreptolysin O or other streptococcal antibody titre, or positive throat culture. The last revision of 2015 suggested variable diagnostic criteria in low-risk and high-risk populations to avoid overdiagnosis in the first category and underdiagnosis in the last one. Low-risk populations were defined as those with acute rheumatic fever annual incidence ≤2 per 100 000 school-aged children or all-age rheumatic heart disease prevalence of ≤1 per 1000. All other populations were categorised as having a moderate or high risk.

===Major criteria===

# Joint manifestations are the unique clinical signs that have different implications for different population-risk categories : Only polyarthritis (a temporary migrating inflammation of the large joints, usually starting in the legs and migrating upwards) is considered as a major criterion in low-risk populations, whereas monoarthritis, polyarthritis and polyarthralgia (joint pain without swelling) are all included as major criteria in high-risk populations.
# Carditis: Carditis can involve the pericardium (pericarditis which resolves without sequelae), some regions of the myocardium (which might not provoke systolic dysfunction), and more consistently the endocardium in the form of valvulitis. Carditis is diagnosed clinically (palpitations, shortness of breath, heart failure, or a new heart murmur) or by echocardiography/Doppler studies revealing mitral or aortic valvulitis. Both of clinical and subclinical carditis are now considered a major criterion.
# Subcutaneous nodules: Painless, firm collections of collagen fibers over bones or tendons. They commonly appear on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees.
# Erythema marginatum: A long-lasting reddish rash that begins on the trunk or arms as macules, which spread outward and clear in the middle to form rings, which continue to spread and coalesce with other rings, ultimately taking on a snake-like appearance. This rash typically spares the face and is made worse with heat.
# Sydenham&#x27;s chorea (St. Vitus&#x27; dance): A characteristic series of involuntary rapid movements of the face and arms. This can occur very late in the disease for at least three months from onset of infection.
Minor criteria

# Arthralgia: Polyarthralgia in low-risk populations and monoarthralgia in others. However, joint manifestations cannot be considered in both major and minor categories in the same patient.
# Fever: ≥ 38.5 °C (101.3 °F) in low-incidence populations and ≥ 38 °C (100.4 °F) in high-risk populations.
# Raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (≥60 mm in the first hour in lox-risk populations and ≥30 mm/h in others) or C reactive protein (&gt;3.0 mg/dL).
# ECG showing a prolonged PR interval after accounting for age variability (Cannot be included if carditis is present as a major symptom)

==Prevention==
Rheumatic fever can be prevented by effectively and promptly treating strep throat with antibiotics. Globally, rheumatic fever is seen in populations that are socioeconomically disadvantaged and with limited access to health care. Overcrowding and exposure to domestic air pollution have been cited as associated risk factors.

In those who have previously had rheumatic fever, antibiotics may be used in a preventative manner as secondary prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis after an episode of acute rheumatic fever is recommended owing to the high likelihood of recurrence. Streptococcal pharyngitis may occur asymptomatically and rheumatic fever may recur even after a treated infection. The American Heart Association recommends, based on low quality evidence but with high predicted efficacy, that people with mitral stenosis due to rheumatic heart disease receive prophylactic antibiotics for 10 years or until age 40, whichever would be longer. The AHA also supports good dental hygiene in people with RHD, and antibiotics for the prevention of infective endocarditis during dental procedures are recommended in high-risk patients.

===Vaccine===
No vaccines are currently available to protect against &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; infection, although research is underway to develop one. Difficulties in developing a vaccine include the wide variety of strains of &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; present in the environment and the large amount of time and number of people that will be needed for appropriate trials for safety and efficacy of the vaccine.

==Treatment==
The management of rheumatic fever is directed toward the reduction of inflammation with anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin or corticosteroids. Individuals with positive cultures for strep throat should also be treated with antibiotics.

===Infection===
People with positive cultures for &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; should be treated with penicillin as long as allergy is not present. The use of antibiotics will not alter cardiac involvement in the development of rheumatic fever. Some suggest the use of benzathine benzylpenicillin.

Monthly injections of long-acting penicillin must be given for a period of five years in patients having one attack of rheumatic fever. If there is evidence of carditis, the length of therapy may be up to 40 years. Another important cornerstone in treating rheumatic fever includes the continual use of low-dose antibiotics (such as penicillin, sulfadiazine, or erythromycin) to prevent recurrence.

===Inflammation===
Aspirin at high doses has historically been used for treatment of rheumatic fever. However, due to side effects like gastritis and salicylate poisoning, necessitating serum monitoring of salicylate levels, and the risk of Reye syndrome, a serious and potentially deadly condition that may arise in children treated with aspirin or aspirin-containing products, alternatives to aspirin have been sought, especially in children. While evidence suggests that treatment of rheumatic fever–associated arthritis with naproxen may be equally effective as with aspirin, its role in managing carditis has not been established. Management of carditis in acute rheumatic fever is controversial and based on dated literature. Corticosteroids may be considered, especially in people with allergies to NSAIDs or severe disease, although use of steroids may cause tissue atrophy, which could present challenges during future cardiac surgery for valve repair.

===Heart failure===
Some patients develop significant carditis which manifests as congestive heart failure. This requires the usual treatment for heart failure: ACE inhibitors, diuretics, beta blockers, and digoxin. Unlike typical heart failure, rheumatic heart failure responds well to corticosteroids.

==Epidemiology==

About 33 million people are affected by rheumatic heart disease with an additional 47 million having asymptomatic damage to their heart valves. As of 2010 globally it resulted in 345,000 deaths, down from 463,000 in 1990.

In Western countries, rheumatic fever has become fairly rare since the 1960s, probably due to the widespread use of antibiotics to treat streptococcus infections. While it has been far less common in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been a few outbreaks since the 1980s. The disease is most common among Indigenous Australians (particularly in central and northern Australia), Māori, and Pacific Islanders, and is also common in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, the Indian subcontinent, and North Africa.

Rheumatic fever primarily affects children between ages 5 and 17 years and occurs approximately 20 days after strep throat. In up to a third of cases, the underlying strep infection may not have caused any symptoms.

The rate of development of rheumatic fever in individuals with untreated strep infection is estimated to be 3%. The incidence of recurrence with a subsequent untreated infection is substantially greater (about 50%). The rate of development is far lower in individuals who have received antibiotic treatment. Persons who have had a case of rheumatic fever have a tendency to develop flare-ups with repeated strep infections.

The recurrence of rheumatic fever is relatively common in the absence of maintenance of low dose antibiotics, especially during the first three to five years after the first episode. Recurrent bouts of rheumatic fever can lead to valvular heart disease. Heart complications may be long-term and severe, particularly if valves are involved. In countries in Southeast-Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Oceania, the percentage of people with rheumatic heart disease detected by listening to the heart was 2.9 per 1000 children and by echocardiography it was 12.9 per 1000 children. To assist in the identification of RHD in low resource settings and where prevalence of GAS infections is high, the World Heart Federation has developed criteria for RHD diagnosis using echocardiography, supported by clinical history if available. The WHF additionally defines criteria for use in people younger than age 20 to diagnose &quot;borderline&quot; RHD, as identification of cases of RHD among children is a priority to prevent complications and progression. However, spontaneous regression is more likely in borderline RHD than in definite cases, and its natural history may vary between populations. 

Echocardiographic screening among children and timely initiation of secondary antibiotic prophylaxis in children with evidence of early stages of rheumatic heart disease may be effective to reduce the burden of rheumatic heart disease in endemic regions. The efficacy of treating latent RHD in populations with high prevalence is balanced by the potential development of antibiotic resistance, which might be offset through use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics like benzathine benzapenicillin. Public health research is ongoing to determine if screening is beneficial and cost effective.

<text>Lipan Apache are a band of Apache, a Southern Athabaskan Indigenous people, who have lived in the Southwest and Southern Plains for centuries. At the time of European and African contact, they lived in New Mexico, Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and northern Mexico. Historically, they were the easternmost band of Apache.

The descendants of the Lipan Apache live primarily in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arizona, and northern Mexico. Some are enrolled in three federally recognized tribes: the Mescalero Apache Tribe in New Mexico, the Tonkawa Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, and Apache Tribe of Oklahoma, which is also known as the Kiowa Apache or Plains Apache. The Lipan Apache, however, are not a federally recognized tribe. Additionally, Lipan Apache descendants are members on non-federally recognized groups.

== Name ==

The name &quot;Lipan&quot; is a Spanish adaption of their self-designation as &quot;Łipa-į́ Ndé&quot; or &quot;Lépai-Ndé&quot; (&quot;Light Gray People&quot;), reflecting their migratory story. The earliest known written record of the Lipan Apache identified this tribe as &quot;Ypandes&quot;.

Nancy McGown Minor wrote that the word &quot;Lipan&quot; stems from the Lipan words &quot;lépai,&quot; which means &#x27;the color gray&#x27;, and &quot;ndé,&quot; which means &#x27;the people&#x27;, which would make Lipan mean &#x27;The Light Gray People&#x27;. The name &quot;Apache&quot; may be of Zuni origin, coming from the word &quot;apachu&quot;, which means &#x27;enemy&#x27;, or perhaps from the Ute, who referred to this group as Awa&#x27;tehe.

Apaches&#x27; autonym is Inde or Nde, meaning &quot;the people.&quot;

The terms &quot;Eastern Apache&quot; and &quot;Texas Apache&quot; can also include them as well as the Chiricahua and Mescalero. &quot;I Fought a Good Fight: A History of the Lipan Apaches&quot; notes that Spanish explorers recorded their encounters with the Chipaines, Conejeros, Rio Colorados, and Anchos living along the Candadian River, who were ancestors of the Lipan.

== Language ==

Lipan Apache is a Southern Athabaskan language, considered to be closely related to the Jicarilla Apache language. Linguist Harry Hoijer noted that in 1938, the Lipan people in South Texas spoke a Southern Athapaskan language. As of 2009, there may be no remaining speakers, and the language is considered almost extinct or dormant. By 1981, only two or three elderly speakers of Lipan remained on the Mescalero Apache Reservation. There are ongoing efforts and funding aimed to revitalize the language.

==History==
Confederated eastern Apache bands had a homeland that spanned from the Southern Great Plains to the Gulf of Mexico, with significant presence in what is now Texas. While there is little archeological evidence of the Lipan Apache, some pictographs in Paint Rock, Texas–located in Concho County–depict the Lipan&#x27;s stories of emergence, sacred ceremonies, monsters, and mythic heroes. These pictographs span 12,000 years and may have contributions from as many as 300 tribes. The nomadic Lipan Apache, Jumanos, Tonkawa, and Comanche peoples inhabited the Concho Valley and are believed to have contributed to the drawings found at the pictograph site. Pictographs depicting a structure featuring crosses and a devil may relate to the mission and are believed to have been created by the Lipan.

=== 16th and 17th centuries ===

Ancestors of the Lipan Apache living along the Canadian River made the first known European contact during the Expedition of Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, who traveled there in 1541, and were still in the region when Diego de Vargas arrived in 1694. Historians believe the Teya Indians of the Texas Panhandle likely merged into the Lipan.

Lipan Apache obtained horses from the Spanish by 1608 and adopted a nomadic lifestyle. They were excellent horsemen and freely raided settlements. Throughout the 17th century, Spaniards raided Apache communities for slaves. The Acho, a branch of Lipan, fought with Taos Pueblo and Picuris Pueblo people against the Spanish in the 1680 Pueblo Revolt.

In 1684, Spanish colonists completed the Mission San Francisco de los Julimes near Presidio, Texas, to serve Jumano, Julime, and neighboring tribes. These tribes taught the peyote ceremony to the Tonkawa and Lipan, who in turn, shared it with the Comanches, Mescalero Apaches, and Plains Apaches. In the 1860s, Spanish chroniclers wrote that some Lipan Apache lived near the Gulf Coast and adopted lifeways of the neighboring Karankawa.

=== 18th century ===

By 1700, Lipan had settled across southern Texas and into Coahuila, Mexico. They still lived in agricultural settlements, where they farmed indigenous crops such as pumpkins, corn, and beans, as well as watermelons, introduced from Africa. French explorer Bénard de La Harpe encountered the Lipan Apache near present-day Latimer County, Oklahoma, in 1719.

The Lipan were first mentioned in Spanish records in 1718 when they raided Spanish settlements in San Antonio. They frequently raided Spanish supply trains traveling from Coahuila to the newly established San Antonio.

In 1749, two Lipan Apache chiefs joined other Apache leaders in signing one of the earliest recorded peace treaties with Spain in San Antonio. Some Lipan Apache people settled northwest of San Antonio during the mid-18th century.

Spanish colonists built forts and missions near Lipan settlements. A mission on the San Sabá River was completed in 1757 but destroyed by the Comanche and the Wichita. That same year, the Lipan Apache fought the Hasinais, a band of Caddo people. The Lipan participated in a Spanish expedition against the Wichita and Comanche in 1759 but were defeated in the Battle of the Twin Villages. Missions established for the Lipan at Candelaria and San Lorenzo were destroyed by the Comanche in 1767.

By 1767, all Lipan had completely deserted the Spanish missions. In the same year, Marquis of Rubí started a policy of Lipan extermination after a 1764 smallpox epidemic had decimated the tribe.

=== 19th century ===

In the early 19th century, Lipan Apache primarily lived in south and west Texas, south of the Colorado River to the Gulf of Mexico and east to the Rio Grande. They were allied to the Tonkawa beginning in this century. To resist their enemies the Comanche and the Mexicans, the Lipan Apache allied with the Republic of Texas in the 1830s. They served as scouts to the Texas Militia during the Texas Revolution of 1835–36.

The State of Texas owned massive war debts and used land sales to raise funds following statehood, leaving almost no land to American Indians. Texas established the Brazos Reservation in 1854, where around 2,000 members of the Caddo, Anadarko, Waco, and Tonkawa tribes, but then the tribes to relocate to Indian Territory by 1859.

In 1855, some Lipan Apache joined the Brazos Reservation; however, most did not. Some joined the Plains Apache in Oklahoma; others joined the Mescalero in New Mexico, and others fled to Mexico.

In 1869, Mexican troops from Monterrey were brought to Zaragosa to eliminate the Lipan Apache, who were blamed for inciting conflict. Chief Magoosh (Lipan, ca. 1830–1900) led his band from Texas and joined the Mescalero Apache on the Mescalero Reservation in 1870. Troops attacked many Lipan camps; survivors fled to the Mescaleros in New Mexico. From 1875 to 1876, United States Army troops undertook joint military campaigns with the Mexican Army to eliminate the Lipan from the state of Coahuila in northern Mexico. In 1879, a group of 17 Lipan settled near Fort Griffin, Texas, but in 1884 they were forcibly removed to Indian Territory, where they joined the Tonkawa.

In 1891, the Lipans negotiated with President of Mexico Porfirio Diaz to preserve the Lipan’s tribal land in Zaragosa. This agreement lasted about 12 years until they were displaced from Zaragosa after resisting joining the Mexican Army.

=== 20th century ===
In October 1903, 19 Lipan Apaches who fled Texas into Coahuila were taken to northwest Chihuahua and kept as prisoners of war until 1905. They were released to the Mescalero Reservation.

== Bands ==
The Lipan Apache emerged from an amalgamation of several Eastern Apache bands united within a large confederacy and who shared a cultural and historic bond. As a confederacy, they united to defend against the Comanche and their allies. By about 1720, the Comanche drove the Lipan Apache from the southern Great Plains. By the early 18th century, the Lipan were divided into regional groupings/divisions comprising several bands - the Forest Lipan division (Lower Lipan bands), the Plains Lipan division (Upper Lipan bands), and bands who lived primarily in northern Mexico (Mexican Lipan bands).

=== Lower Lipan bands; Forest Lipan division ===
* Red Hair People (Tséral tuétahäⁿ): absorbed later into the Sun Otter band or the Green Mountain band, lived south of the Nueces River in Texas, no longer existed in 1884.
* Sun Otter band (Tcheshä’ⁿ): ranged from San Antonio, Texas, south to the Rio Grande.
* Green Mountain band (Tsél tátlidshäⁿ): absorbed later by the High-Beaked Moccasin band, lived in the lower Texas Gulf Plains along the lower Colorado, Guadalupe and Nueces Rivers.
* High-Beaked Moccasin band (Kóke metcheskó lähäⁿ): lived south of San Antonio as far as northern Mexico.
* Tall Grass band (Cuelcahende): lived from southwestern Kansas to northeastern Durango.
* Heads of Wolves People (Tsés tsembai): lived above the Colorado River, possibly in the Lubbock area. May represent an early Lipan presence in north Texas before the Commanche moved in.
* Trees Tall Standing People (Tcic n’ti óané) &amp; Red Mud People (Gocłic Łit’xuné): merged to form the Canneci Tinné, the easternmost band of Apache, whose territory includes present-day St. Martin &amp; Lafayette parishes in Louisiana. The Canneci were noted as early as 1700 by Jean-Baptiste LeMoyne, Sieur de Bienville

=== Upper Lipan / Plains Lipan division ===
* Fire or Camp Circle band (Ndáwe ɣóhäⁿ): lived west to southwest of Fort Griffin, from the San Saba River to the Rio Grande River.
* Pulverizing or Rubbing band (Tchóⁿ kanäⁿ): absorbed later by the Little Breech-clout band, lived west of Fort Griffin, Texas, to the western side of the Rio Grande, believed extinct by 1884.
* Little Breech-clout band (Tchaⁿshka ózhäyeⁿ): lived along the lower Pecos River in Texas.
* Uplander band (Täzhä&#x27;ⁿ): lived along the upper Rio Grande in southern New Mexico but would migrate to the upper Nueces River in Texas to hunt buffalo.
* Prairie Men (&quot;Kó&#x27;l kukä&#x27;ⁿ&quot;): known as the &quot;Llaneros&quot; by the late 18th century, lived west of Ft. Griffin along the upper Colorado and Concho Rivers and ranged to west of the Pecos River.
* Wild Goose Band (Teł kóndahäⁿ): possibly absorbed by the Prairie Man band in the late 18th century, lived along the upper Colorado River west of Fort Griffin in Texas, were renowned and fierce warriors.
* North Band (&quot;Shä-äⁿ&quot;): lived in the mid-19th century in northwestern Texas in territory inhabited by the Kiowa Apache.

* Big Water band (&quot;Kú’ne tsá&quot;): in the mid-18th century, this band broke from their kin in San Antonio and moved into northern Coahuila near Zaragos,  lived along the Escondido and San Rodrigo Rivers and in the Santa Rosa and Sierra El Burro Mountains of Mexico.
* Painted Wood People (&quot;Tsésh ke shénde&quot; or &quot;Tséc kecénde&quot;): lived in Lavón, Coahuila, Mexico, between Zaragosa and Morelos, believed extinct by 1884.

The Spanish associated these groupings with the Lipan:

* Lipiyánes: a coalition of Lipans, &quot;Nastagés&quot;, and other Lipans who lived along the Pecos, joined together by 1780 under the leadership of &quot;Picax-Ande-Ins-Tinsle&quot; (Strong Arm), to battle the Comanche’s southern expansion.
* Natagés (&quot;Mescal People&quot;): culturally affiliated with the Mescalero Apache, lived along the Pecos River and were strong allies of the Lipan Apaches.
* Pelones (&quot;Bald/Hairless Ones&quot;): name given to the Forest Lipan division by the Spaniards probably in reference to Lipan custom of plucking facial hair, lived in the upper Brazos area along the Red River of north-central Texas.

== Population ==
Ethnographer James Mooney estimated that there were 500 Lipan Apache in 1690. Missionary priest Friar Diego Ximenez estimated the Lipan population to total 5,000 in 1762, 3,000 in 1763, and 4,000 in 1764. In 1778, Spanish military commanders meeting in Monclova, Coahuila, estimated the population of Lipan men to be 5,000. By 1820, Mexican government official Juan Padilla estimated that there were 700 Lipans in Texas. Opler and Ray estimated that the Lipan population between 1845-1855 ranged from 500 to 1000. The 1910 U.S. census lists 28 Lipan Apache people.

== 21st century ==
Lipan Apache descendants are enrolled in three federally recognized tribes: the Mescalero Apache Tribe in New Mexico, Tonkawa Tribe in Oklahoma, and the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma. However, the Lipan are not federally recognized as a tribe. Additionally, descendants are members of multiple non-federally recognized tribes in Texas and Louisiana. These include:

Louisiana

* Choctaw-Apache Tribe of Ebarb, also known as the Choctaw-Apache Community of Ebarb, in Zwolle, Louisiana
* Coco Tribe of Canneci Tinne, in Carencro, Louisiana

Texas

* Apache Council of Texas in Alice, Texas
* Lipan Apache Band of Texas in Brackettville, Texas.
* Lipan Apache Nation of Texas, also known as the Kuné Tsa Nde Band of the Lipan Apache Nation of Texas, in San Antonio, Texas
* Lipan Apache Tribe of Texas in McAllen, Texas

The State of Louisiana recognized the Choctaw-Apache Community of Ebarb by legislative action, House Concurrent Resolution 2, in 1978.

Although Texas currently has &quot;no legal mechanism to recognize tribes&quot;; state recognition can occur through various means, including state law, administrative actions, legislation, and gubernatorial proclamations or executive orders, but most often through legislation. On March 18, 2009, Senate Resolution 438 and House Resolution 812, both titled &quot;Recognizing the Lipan Apache Tribe of Texas,&quot; were passed by their respective chambers during the 81st Texas Legislative Session. These jointly issued congratulatory resolutions expressed the sentiments of both chambers in acknowledging the Lipan Apache Tribe of Texas as a historical tribe and commended the tribe&#x27;s contributions to the state. In 2019, State of Texas 86th Legislature, adopted concurrent resolutions, Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 61 and House Concurrent Resolution No. 171, that affirmed the Texas Legislature&#x27;s views that the Lipan Apache Tribe of Texas was &quot;the present-day incarnation of a proud people who have lived in Texas and northern Mexico for more than 300 years&quot;. The resolutions also commended the Tribe for its valuable contributions to the state. The Senate, House, and the Governor signed each concurrent resolution.

Texas senate bills for formal state recognition of the Lipan Apache Tribe of Texas were introduced in 2021 and in 2022. Both bills died in committee.

The Lipan Apache Band of Texas was honored by the Texas state legislator in 2011 through House Resolution 540.

In December 2024, the Choctaw-Apache Community of Ebarb and the Lipan Apache Tribe of Texas were registered members of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) as state-recognized tribe tribes. NCAI requires annual registration with membership dues. Also, member organizations are required to select a delegate who will represent their interests at NCAI&#x27;s Annual Convention, Executive Council Winter Session, and Mid-Year Conference.

== Notable Lipan Apache chiefs ==
Below are historical chiefs with estimated times of when they were active.

* Bigotes () (middle of the 18th century): In 1751, he left Texas and crossed the Rio Grande into Coahuila. About this date, they lived along the Rio Escondido and Rio San Rodrigo in Coahuila.
* Poca Ropa () ( 1750 – 1790) was Chief of the Little Breech-clout band along the lower Pecos River
* Cavezon/el Gran Cavezon (): 1760 – 1790) was Chief of the Fire/Camp Circla band, lived along the San Saba River towards the upper Nueces River.
* Yolcha/Yolcna Pocarropa ( 1822 – 1828) was Chief of several bands of the Littel Breech-clout band in western Texas, grandson of Poca Ropa. He was allied with Cuelgas de Castro. He moved his band from the lower Pecos River area in West Texas to the Laredo and lower Rio Grande region in late 1820s.
* Cuelgas de Castro ( 1821 – 1842) was Chief of the Sun Otter band in the territory of San Antonio across the Rio Grande in Tamaulipas and played a large role in interactions between the Republic of Texas and the Lipan Apache. He was an ally of chiefs Flacco and Yolcha Pocarropa.
* Flacco ( 1821 – 1843) was Chief of the High-Beaked Moccasin band east of San Antonio who had a history of aiding Texas Militian units. He was a friend of President of the Republic of Texas Sam Houston.
* Magoosh (Ma’uish): 1850 – 1900) was Chief of the Sun Otter band in southeastern Texas. Because of a severe epidemic, one part of this band went to Zaragosa in Coahuila, while the other part of Magoosh&#x27;s band took refuge by the Mescalero and accompanied them in 1870 onto the Mescalero Reservation.

<doc id="412739" wikidata="Q7768083" url="?curid=412739" title="The Tamuli">
<text>The Tamuli is a series of fantasy novels by American writer David Eddings. The series consists of three volumes:

* &quot;Domes of Fire&quot;
*&quot;The Shining Ones&quot;
* &quot;The Hidden City&quot;

The Tamuli is the sequel to &quot;The Elenium&quot;. In this series, Sparhawk and friends travel to the Tamul Empire, far to the east. The first book was published in November 1992.

== &quot;Domes of Fire&quot; ==

&quot;Domes of Fire&quot; returns the reader to the world of The Elenium and the adventures of Sparhawk - Pandion Knight and Prince Consort to Queen Ehlana of Elenia. The novel chronicles the journey of Sparhawk and his companions as they journey across two continents to the city of Matherion, capital of the Tamul Empire - where supernatural occurrences threaten the safety of the entire world.
== &quot;The Shining Ones&quot; ==

&quot;The Shining Ones&quot; continues the adventures of the series. Having seen the beginning of the threats in the Tamuli Empire, Sparhawk and his friends launch a campaign to purge the majority of the offenders with the help of the feared Shining Ones. As events reveal greater forces working in the background, Sparhawk is forced to do what he never wished to: take forth Bhelliom, the Sapphire Rose, and wield it once again.
== &quot;The Hidden City&quot; ==
Following &quot;The Shining Ones&quot;, the enemies have been identified, and the cards are dealt. Queen Ehlana, kidnapped by the forces of Cyrgon, is held captive against Sparhawk&#x27;s delivering of Bhelliom. The Troll Gods, freed in the climax of &quot;The Shining Ones&quot;, along with Sparhawk and the Younger Gods set out to stop Cyrgon as a greater threat looms. Cyrgon, desperate after his defeat, unleashes Bhelliom&#x27;s arch-rival, Klæl, and Sparhawk, taking on his full role as Anakha, goes to face Cyrgon in the Hidden City of the Cyrgai.
==Special release==
In November 2008, Del Rey Books released all three books of The Tamuli in a single volume, trade paperback edition. This follows a similar special treatment for The Elenium. The single-volume edition features all of the original material of the separate books including maps and weighs in at 1040 pages. The cover is light blue and features a prominent picture of a crown on the front.

<text>GoTriangle is the operator of regional public transit bus services in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina. GoTriangle is a member of the region-wide GoTransit system, operating limited-stop and express bus services in Wake, Durham, and Orange counties.

The agency was founded in 1989, and is officially known as the Research Triangle Regional Public Transportation Authority. Before the adoption of the current GoTriangle name in 2015, the agency was known as the Triangle Transit Authority and Triangle Transit. In , GoTriangle had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== History ==
=== 1989 to 2000 ===

==== Founding as TTA ====
The 1989 session of the North Carolina General Assembly enabled the creation of the Triangle Transit Authority as a regional public transportation authority serving Durham, Orange, and Wake counties. The new unit of local government was chartered by the NC Secretary of State on December 1, 1989.

* 1991 – the NC General Assembly, subject to County approvals, authorized Triangle Transit to levy a vehicle registration tax of up to $5 per registration. This tag tax finances the regional bus operations, vanpooling program, and planning program.
* 1992 – the Triangle Transit Authority (TTA) completed the Triangle Fixed Guideway Study, after securing a grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to study long-range regional public transportation for the three-county Triangle region (Durham, Orange, and Wake).
* Feb 1995 – TTA Board of Trustees adopted the Preliminary Recommendations for a Regional Transit Plan, after evaluating several alternatives and received feedback from land use and transportation professionals, elected officials and the public.
* Oct 1995 – TTA Board of Trustees adopted the recommendations for a Regional Transit Plan and subsequently incorporated into the region&#x27;s two long-range transportation plans. This document guides regional transit planning efforts today.
* 1997 – the NC General Assembly, subject to County approvals, authorized Triangle Transit to levy a rental vehicle tax of up to 5% of gross receipts. This tax, effective January 1, 1998, will finance future capital projects.
* Jan 1998 – TTA, in cooperation with the FTA, initiated the Preliminary Engineering (PE) phase of project development and started preparing a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the proposed Regional Rail Transit System. 

=== 2000s to 2010s ===

==== Planning and developments ====
In May 2001, the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and all applicable federal rules and regulations, which emphasized the project&#x27;s environmental impacts, mitigation measures, and community involvement. In January 2003, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) issued a Record of Decision (ROD), confirming that all required analyses, mitigation, and public involvement objectives had been met. Subsequently, in February 2003, the FTA approved TTA&#x27;s request to progress to the Final Design phase, allowing for further refinement of project details.

By August 2005, TTA had completed the 100% level of design, finalizing plans for station locations and track alignments, and continued progressing toward the receipt of federal funds. However, in late 2007, facing increasing project costs and changes in federal New Starts cost-benefits formulas, Triangle Transit opted not to submit a New Starts application for FTA funding. This decision led to the suspension of the project as costs and future funding options were reexamined.

Triangle Transit was established to plan, finance, organize, and operate a public transportation system for the Research Triangle area, focusing on three main program areas:
# Regional bus service
# Vanpool service
# Regional transit planning

Since 1995, the cornerstone of Triangle Transit&#x27;s long-term strategy involved a 28-mile rail corridor stretching from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) technology. Proposals to extend this corridor by an additional 7 miles to Chapel Hill using light rail technology were indefinitely deferred in 2006 after the Federal Transit Administration declined funding for the project due to financial constraints and shifting federal priorities.

On March 17, 2008, after 15 years as Triangle Transit Authority, the Board of Trustees changed the agency&#x27;s name and logo to Triangle Transit. Triangle Transit Board Chair Sig Hutchinson announced its new promise to the Triangle:
Triangle Transit improves our region’s quality of life by connecting people and places with reliable, safe, and easy-to-use travel choices that reduce congestion and energy use, save money, and promote sustainability, healthier lifestyles, and a more environmentally responsible community.
GoTriangle is governed by a thirteen-member Board of Trustees. Ten members are appointed by the region&#x27;s principal municipalities and counties and three members are appointed by the North Carolina Secretary of Transportation.

Planning for a regional transit system began in the early 1990s under the guidance of the Triangle Transit Authority. In 1992, the Triangle Fixed Guideway Study was completed after securing a grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to study long-range regional public transportation for the three-county Triangle region (Durham, Orange, and Wake). The study examined regional economic growth opportunities and identified potential locations for growth, corridors that could connect these growth areas, and changes in land use that would need to take place to support transit. Recommendations from the plan were adopted by the TTA Board of Trustees in 1995, and were incorporated into the region&#x27;s long-range transportation plans. By 1998, preliminary engineering and environmental planning of the project was underway. In 2003, the FTA issued a record of decision and allowed the project to move into final design.

TTA completed the 100% level of design and continued progressing toward the receipt of federal funds in 2005. In late 2007, due to rising project costs and a change in federal New Starts cost-benefits formulas, Triangle Transit elected not to submit a New Starts application for FTA funding. As a result, work on the regional rail system was suspended in order to reexamine costs and future funding options.

To analyze the future of regional rail in the Triangle, a partnership between TTA, Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO), Durham-Chapel Hill-Carrboro Metropolitan Planning Organization (DCHC), NC Department of Transportation&#x27;s Public Transportation Division (NCDOT), and Triangle J Council of Governments (TJCOG) jointly conducted The Transit Blueprint Technical Analysis Project. This 2007 effort was a collaboration between agencies to provide the technical basis for analyzing both future transit corridors and the planned or potential transit infrastructure investment within those corridors. The results of the Blueprint have been used to set priorities for major transit investments based on land use, travel market, and cost characteristics.

The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC), which met between May 2007 and April 2008, was a broad-based citizen group with 38 members from across the Research Triangle Region. The STAC was appointed by CAMPO and DCHC to assist in the joint development of a plan for a regional transit system and to craft recommendations for the transit component of their respective Long Range Transportation Plans (LRTPs), with a focus on major transit investments. The Commission presented their final report to the metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) at a joint meeting on May 21, 2008.

In 2009 the region&#x27;s two planning organizations, CAMPO and DCHC, completed work on 2035 Long Range Transportation Plans. The plans include increased bus service and the addition of rail service. A coalition of transit, transportation, and environmental groups joined to support State House Bill 148, providing for future referendums for funding transit projects using voter-approved sales taxes. Triangle and Triad counties can hold referendums on a one-half cent sales tax for transit. Other counties are permitted to go to the voters for a one-quarter cent sales tax. With passage in the NC General Assembly in summer 2009, Governor Bev Perdue signed the bill into law in August 2009.

Currently, counties in the region are working with Triangle Transit, CAMPO and DCHC to finalize individual county plans, which will include enhanced transit options. County Commissions have the authority to call for a referendum when they are satisfied with the transit plans they have decided upon and are ready to go to the voters for funding. Durham County passed a one-half cent sales tax for transit in November 2011. The adopted bill also ties state funding into future projects.

In April 2012, a Notice of Intent (NOI) was published in the Federal Register indicating that the Federal Transit Administration and Triangle Transit intend to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Durham-Orange LRT project only. Scoping meetings for the D-O LRT project took place in May 2012 in order to bring together elected officials and regulatory agencies (the US Department of Transportation, US Environmental Protection Agency, US Army Corps of Engineers, and others). From their discussions, a Scoping Report was published and identified all human and natural environment aspects of the project that required additional analysis and consideration during the EIS phase.

Evaluation of the Wake Corridor and the Durham-Wake Corridor options continues in the background. 

Three public meetings in November 2013 will show the alternatives carried forward for further study in the Environmental Impact Statement phase.

==== Proposed light rail ====
Planning began on a new light rail project between Durham and Chapel Hill in 2013 as part of Durham and Orange County Transit Plans. The 17.7-mile light rail service connects the UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill to NCCU in Durham, serving major locations in the two regions. 

The Environmental Impact Analysis for the Durham-Orange LRT project, from 2012 to 2016 with environmental monitoring, delineation of the potential project boundaries and alignment, and agency communication and coordination.

In July 2017, GoTriangle received approval from the Federal Transit Administration to proceed from initial “Project Development” to “New Starts Engineering,” which means GoTriangle will work closely with FTA over the next few years to finalize the project design. Entry into the engineering phase means our region will be on track to receive over $1 billion in federal investment, which accounts for 50 percent of the total project funding, which is funded by state funding and sale taxes.

== Routes and major destinations ==
GoTriangle is a regional bus service, offering a wide variety of transit and vanpool services around the Research Triangle. Operating service around the major cities of Durham, Raleigh, Chapel Hill, Cary, and Apex. GoTriangle is a supporting agency of the Special Transit Advisory Commission&#x27;s work to plan for the region&#x27;s transit future. The STAC completed its work in May 2008 and has provided its recommendations to the area&#x27;s two planning organizations: Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO) and Durham-Chapel Hill-Carrboro Metropolitan Planning Organization (DCHC MPO).

=== Route List ===
== Fleet ==
GoTriangle&#x27;s operates a fleet of Gillig Low Floor buses for its fixed-route service. They also operate paratransit buses for their ACCESS program. All buses have bike racks on, which can support up to two bikes. This is to improve public transit usage for the system. All buses are Wi-Fi enabled, either built-in or retrofitted for any model before 2017.

=== Current Roster ===
Here is the current bus roster as of October 2022
=== Fleet Livery ===
During the three phases of the company, they went through three livery changes. The first one, used by TTA until 2007, utilized a white, dark green, and black body with a single stripe in the white body. The second one, used when it was rebranded to Triangle Transit, used a more vibrant livery. It uses a yellow-green body with orange, white, and blue waves on the body. When the company revamped itself to GoTriangle, it used the same livery as the other GoTransit operators around them. They used a gray base, with hues of green triangles around the back. Despite the switchover to GoTriangle, some buses operating that were made before 2012 retains the old Triangle Transit livery. The top stripe displays their new motto, &quot;Connecting all points of the Triangle.&quot;
== Major transit systems and centers ==

=== Regional Transit Center ===
Since 2008, GoTriangle has a transit center located near Slater Road in Durham. Originally located in RTP. The center has a park and ride lot. The GoTriangle headquarters is also located adjescent to the terminal. In 2024, the agency received federal RAISE grant to build a new transit center near NC 54, Wilkinson Farm Road, and rail tracks owned by the North Carolina Railroad. The new development will focus on improved safety of patrons, connectivity to varied modes of transit, speed to reach destinations, and includes building multimodal facilities that support transit-oriented development.

This center is currently served by GoTriangle&#x27;s 100, 700, and 800 routes at all times, GoTriangle&#x27;s 310 route during weekdays, GoTriangle&#x27;s 105, 311, 805, and NRX routes during peak hours only, and GoDurham&#x27;s 12B route during weekdays.

All routes serve Downtown Hillsborough. This area is served by GoTriangle&#x27;s 405, 420, and ODX routes during peak hours only.

== Rail transit planning ==
=== Durham–Orange Light Rail Transit ===

GoTriangle was planning a light rail line between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and East Durham, traveling through Duke University and paralleling the North Carolina Railroad alignment through Durham and proceeding to North Carolina Central University (NCCU). The original project was estimated at $1.4 billion (in 2011). The final project was estimated to cost $2.5 billion (year of expenditure) or $141 million per mile with an annual operating cost of $28.7 million. The line would have had a connection to Amtrak via its station in Durham.

A final environmental impact statement was released by GoTriangle in February 2016, projecting 23,020 daily trips in 2040. The plan was amended to extend to NCCU in November 2016, projecting 26,880 daily trips in 2040. The line would have had 18 stations (4 stations in Orange County, 14 stations in Durham County); end-to-end travel time would have been 42–44 minutes. The line was projected to begin construction in 2020 and be complete by 2028 but ultimately was discontinued in April 2019.

=== Commuter rail ===

After the failure of the Durham–Orange Light Rail project, GoTriangle began studying the possibility of instating a commuter rail service which would serve Durham, Raleigh, Cary, Morrisville, Research Triangle Park, and Garner, possibly as far as Clayton. In 2023, the Federal Transit Administration revealed that it would not be providing funds for rail construction, citing the downturn in transit utilization following the COVID-19 pandemic. Officials indicated that bus rapid transit projects would be encouraged to proceed for providing transit in the area.

<doc id="412741" wikidata="Q5305224" url="?curid=412741" title="Dragon Kings (Dark Sun)">
<text>Dragon Kings is an accessory for the &quot;Dark Sun&quot; campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game. The book was written by Timothy Brown, and was published in 1992.

==Contents==
&quot;Dragon Kings&quot; features tips for taking player characters from the Dark Sun setting all the way to 30th level. The first section of the book offers rules for creating high-level warriors, along with &quot;Battlesystem&quot; options, and 50-plus pages of high-powered spells.

Dragon Kings are the most powerful characters of Athas, and rule the world. This book provides information on these advanced beings, the new magical spells available to them, plus new psionic devotions and organizations, military vehicles and army lists, and more.

==Publication history==
&quot;Dragon Kings&quot; was written by Timothy B. Brown and published by TSR, Inc.

==Reception==
Berin Kinsman reviewed the module in the March/April issue of &quot;White Wolf&quot; magazine. He stated that &quot;Over all, &quot;Dragon Kings&quot; is an attractive package with useful information for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; aficionados in general and Dark Sun buffs in particular.&quot; He rated it as a 3 out of a possible 5.

Rick Swan reviewed &quot;Dragon Kings&quot; for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine #197 (September 1993). He commented that &quot;Power-mad players who feel constrained by the level limits imposed by the standard &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; rules should delight in this Dark Sun supplement&quot;. He thought that the rules for creating &quot;stratospheric-level warriors&quot; were &quot;interesting&quot;, and called the &quot;Battlesystem&quot; options &quot;useful but nonessential&quot;. He felt that &quot;the real action&quot; is in high-powered spells, giving examples of a spell which conjures a fortified tower more than 100 yards tall, a spell which creates up to a 480-yard radius forest with as many as 36,000 trees, and a spell to animate as many as 4,000 skeletons from an ancient civilization. He commented that &quot;Dungeon Masters may shudder at the thought of coming up with scenarios to challenge 30th-level PCs—what are they gonna do, fight planets?&quot;

<doc id="412742" wikidata="Q313708" url="?curid=412742" title="Juha Kankkunen">
<text>Juha Matti Pellervo Kankkunen (; born 2 April 1959) is a Finnish former rally driver. His factory team career in the World Rally Championship lasted from 1983 to 2002. He won 23 world rallies and four drivers&#x27; world championship titles, which were both once records in the series. Both Sébastien Loeb and Sébastien Ogier have since collected more world titles, but no driver was able to repeat Kankkunen&#x27;s feat of becoming a world champion with three different manufacturers until Ogier matched this achievement in 2020.

Kankkunen was signed by Toyota Team Europe in 1983 and he took his first WRC win in his third year in the team. His performances got him a deal with the defending champions Peugeot for 1986, and Kankkunen was soon crowned the series&#x27; then youngest-ever champion. As Peugeot withdrew from the championship following the ban of Group B, Kankkunen moved to Lancia and became the first driver to successfully defend his title. After a two-year stint back at Toyota, he returned to Lancia and won a record third title in 1991.

In 1993, Kankkunen re-joined Toyota and won his fourth title. Following Toyota&#x27;s disqualification and 12-month ban in 1995, Kankkunen did not return to active participation in the series until joining Ford halfway through the 1997 season replacing an underperforming Armin Schwarz. After moving to Subaru for 1999, he took his first win in over five years. Before retiring after the 2002 season, he competed part-time for Hyundai.

Kankkunen&#x27;s achievements outside the WRC include winning the Dakar Rally in 1988 and the Race of Champions in 1988 and 1991. Following his retirement from active rallying, he has worked in the fields of business and politics. In 2007, Kankkunen set the world speed record on ice in a Bentley Continental GT. In 2011, he set a further record of 330.695 km/h in a convertible Bentley Continental Supersports.

==Career==
Kankkunen grew up on his family&#x27;s farm in Laukaa in Central Finland, near the route of the Rally Finland. His father had rallying and ice racing as a hobby, and taught Juha how to drive on an ice racing track. Kankkunen began to drive when he was seven years old, and owned his first car at the age of 12. He debuted in rallying in 1978 and competed in his first World Rally Championship event at the 1979 1000 Lakes Rally in Finland, finishing 14th in a Ford Escort RS2000. Kankkunen was coached by Timo Mäkinen, a friend of his father&#x27;s, and was able to compete often and gain experience with financial help from Timo Jouhki, future manager for many Finnish rally drivers such as Tommi Mäkinen and Mikko Hirvonen.

===1983–85: Toyota===
Due to good results for Toyota Finland in local events, Kankkunen was signed by the Toyota Team Europe, Toyota&#x27;s factory WRC team headed by Ove Andersson. In his first season in the Toyota Celica Twincam Turbo, as teammate to the 1979 world champion Björn Waldegård, his three outings in the championship resulted in a sixth place at the 1000 Lakes, a seventh place at the RAC Rally in Great Britain and a retirement at the Rallye Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. The following year, Kankkunen competed in four WRC events with Fred Gallagher as his new regular co-driver, retiring in three and finishing fifth in his home event. In 1985, he started his season with a surprise victory at the Safari Rally, becoming the first driver to win the event on the first attempt. He went on to compete in four more rallies and take his second win at WRC&#x27;s second endurance event, the Rallye Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, where he finished with the same amount of penalty minutes (4 hours and 46 minutes) as his teammate Waldegård but took the win by a tiebreaker.

===1986: Peugeot===

Kankkunen&#x27;s performances with the Celica earned him his chance to come to the fore with the defending manufacturers&#x27; and drivers&#x27; champions Peugeot. The team signed him for the 1986 season to replace Ari Vatanen who was still recovering from his nearly fatal accident during the previous season. Kankkunen duly seized his opportunity, taking the second evolution of the Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 E2 to victory in the Swedish Rally, the Acropolis Rally and the Rally New Zealand and finishing on the podium in three more events. The season ended in controversy, when first Group B cars were banned for the next season after Henri Toivonen&#x27;s fatal accident at the Tour de Corse, which outraged Peugeot team principal Jean Todt, and later the French Peugeot team were excluded at the Rallye Sanremo in Italy, resulting in a triple win for home country&#x27;s Lancia. Despite the 205 T16s passing the pre-rally scrutiny, the stewards had decreed on re-examination that the cars&#x27; underbody fins were in fact illegal side skirts. Going into the season-ending Olympus Rally in the United States, Lancia&#x27;s Markku Alén led Kankkunen by one point. Although Alén beat Kankkunen to the win, he was the world champion only for eleven days, until Peugeot&#x27;s appeal went through. The FIA deemed the team&#x27;s Sanremo exclusion illegal and annulled the results of the event, making Kankkunen the youngest champion in the history of the series.

===1987: Lancia===
Following the FIA&#x27;s decision to ban Group B, Peugeot withdrew from the WRC and Kankkunen moved to drive the Lancia Delta HF 4WD for Lancia Martini, Lancia&#x27;s factory WRC team. He was quickly comfortable in the car and led his Lancia debut in Monte Carlo until the very last stage, when Lancia boss Cesare Fiorio controversially forced him to finish second behind teammate Miki Biasion. Kankkunen later won the Olympus Rally by beating Biasion by only 12 seconds in a six-hour event. In a close battle for the drivers&#x27; world championship title, he edged out his teammates Biasion and Alén by winning the season-ending RAC Rally. At the Autosport Awards, Kankkunen was presented the &quot;International Rally Driver Award&quot; for the second year running. Despite becoming the first driver to successfully defend the world title, Kankkunen&#x27;s uneasy acceptance of team orders designed to benefit Biasion, the Italian star in an Italian car, pre-empted a move elsewhere for the 1988 season.

===1988–89: Toyota===
Kankkunen chose to move back to Toyota Team Europe. Although he finished fifth in his first event with the Toyota Supra Turbo at the Safari Rally, his title defense quickly proved unsuccessful. Toyota debuted the new Toyota Celica GT-Four ST165 at the Tour de Corse, but the car was suffering from reliability issues. Kankkunen retired due to engine problems in three consecutive rallies and did not add to his points tally, finishing only 37th in the drivers&#x27; standings.

However, outside the World Rally Championship, he achieved much success. Returning to the wheel of a Peugeot 205 T16, he won the Dakar Rally on his first attempt after compatriot and teammate Ari Vatanen&#x27;s 405 T16 was famously stolen while he was leading the event. Kankkunen also competed for Peugeot at the Pikes Peak International Hillclimb, finishing runner-up to again-teammate Vatanen, and at the first-ever Race of Champions, beating the 1985 world rally champion and former Peugeot teammate Timo Salonen in the final to become the first &quot;Champion of Champions&quot;.

The 1989 season saw an improved Toyota. Kankkunen gave the GT-Four its first victory in the Rally Australia and finished third at the Tour de Corse and at the RAC. His results placed him third in the drivers&#x27; championship, behind Lancia drivers Biasion and Alex Fiorio. Toyota took career-best second place in the manufacturers&#x27; standings.

===1990–92: Lancia===

By the time Kankkunen took the long-awaited win for Toyota, he had already signed a deal to reacquaint himself with Lancia for the 1990 season. Halfway through the season, Kankkunen found himself only fourth in the championship and Toyota in the lead with their new star driver Carlos Sainz. Although Kankkunen later repeated his win in Australia and collected his fifth podium of the season in Sanremo, Sainz went on to take a dominant title. Kankkunen placed third in the drivers&#x27; world championship, between his teammates Didier Auriol and the defending world champion Biasion. Lancia edged out Toyota to take a record fourth manufacturers&#x27; title in a row.

In the 1991 season, Kankkunen won the Safari Rally, the Acropolis Rally, his home event 1000 Lakes Rally for the first time and the Rally Australia for the third year in a row. Before the season-ending RAC Rally, Toyota&#x27;s Sainz led Kankkunen by one point in the championship. By winning the RAC ahead of Kenneth Eriksson and Sainz, Kankkunen became the first man to seal a third drivers&#x27; title since the World Rally Championship&#x27;s 1973 inauguration. His 150 points during the season is still the record for most points in a single season. This was also the first time that two drivers took five wins during a WRC season. In the Race of Champions, Kankkunen became the second two-time winner after beating Auriol in the final.

In 1992, Kankkunen placed on the podium in each of the nine WRC events that he participated in, but took his only win at the Rally Portugal. The title fight again went down to the wire. Before the final rally, Sainz led Kankkunen by two points and Auriol, who had taken a record six wins during the season, by three points. Sainz&#x27;s victory in the RAC ahead of Ari Vatanen and Kankkunen, combined with Auriol&#x27;s retirement, confirmed the title in favour of the Spaniard.

===1993–96: Toyota===

After Lancia withdrew from the WRC after the 1992 season, Kankkunen rejoined Toyota to drive the Toyota Celica GT-Four ST185 with which Sainz had defeated him last year. Despite having to fare from mid-season with two substitute co-drivers after Juha Piironen suffered a brain hemorrhage, Kankkunen went on to take a record fourth drivers&#x27; title by winning five of his ten WRC events; the Safari Rally with Piironen, the Rally Argentina, the Rally Australia and the RAC Rally with his new co-driver Nicky Grist, and the 1000 Lakes Rally with Denis Giraudet due to Grist&#x27;s pre-arrangement with Armin Schwarz. Kankkunen&#x27;s win at the RAC marked his career 20th in the series, breaking compatriot Markku Alén&#x27;s record for most wins. Kankkunen and his third-placed teammate Didier Auriol brought Toyota the manufacturers&#x27; crown, the first for a Japanese manufacturer. He also became only the second motorsportsman to be voted the Finnish Sportsman of the Year, after the 1982 F1 world champion Keke Rosberg.

In 1994, Kankkunen started well with a runner-up spot in Monte Carlo and a win in Portugal. In the Safari Rally, he crashed out from the lead after hitting a pothole made by rain at 180 km/h (112 mph). At the season&#x27;s half-way point, Kankkunen and Subaru&#x27;s Sainz tied the lead in the championship, but a few poor results soon dropped him out of the title fight; in Argentina and Sanremo, he suffered from mechanical problems and in Finland, he won the opening stage but lost 20 minutes on stage two after rolling his car. He climbed back into the points by finishing ninth. Finishing behind Auriol and Sainz in the overall standings, Kankkunen had to watch a teammate take the title for the only time in his career.

In 1995, with two more rallies to go, Kankkunen&#x27;s consistent performances during the season had kept him in the lead of the championship seven points ahead of Subaru&#x27;s Colin McRae. At the penultimate round, the Rally Catalunya, he was leading by almost a minute over Sainz and McRae and seemed to be heading towards his first WRC victory on tarmac, as well as closing in on his fifth title. However, a pacenote mistake by either him or his co-driver Grist resulted in a crash and a retirement. After the event, Toyota were found guilty of the implementation of illegal turbo restrictor bypasses on their ST205 cars. The team was given a 12-month ban by the FIA. Toyota drivers Kankkunen, Auriol and Armin Schwarz were also stripped of all points in the championships. FIA president Max Mosley stated that &quot;there is no suggestion the drivers were aware of what was going on.&quot; In the following year (1996 which also happened to be the end of Nicky Grist&#x27;s pairing with Kankkunen as a favor to replace Colin McRae&#x27;s co-driver Derek Ringer from 1997 to 2002), Kankkunen competed for private Toyota teams in three events and finished fourth in Sweden, third in Indonesia and second in Finland.

===1997–98: Ford===

Halfway through the 1997 season, Kankkunen joined the Ford Motor Company factory team to replace a disappointing Armin Schwarz. Joining the M-Sport-run team too late to challenge for the title himself, Kankkunen&#x27;s role was to support Ford and his teammate Carlos Sainz in their title fights. He started well by leading his second event with the team, the Acropolis Rally in Greece, until having to drop behind Sainz due to a team order. Kankkunen went on to finish only seconds behind Sainz also in Indonesia and New Zealand. In his home rally in Finland, he lost the win to the defending world champion, Mitsubishi&#x27;s Tommi Mäkinen, by only seven seconds. This is still the narrowest winning margin in the history of the event. A fourth runner-up spot followed in the season-ending RAC Rally, now ahead of the Spaniard who had by then lost the title to Mäkinen.

Kankkunen stayed with Ford for the 1998 season with Belgian driver Bruno Thiry as his new teammate, after Sainz had opted to re-join Toyota. Ford was already moving resources into developing the new Ford Focus WRC and the team&#x27;s last year with the Escort WRC was winless. Kankkunen drove the car on the podium on seven occasions, and both Ford and Kankkunen finished fourth in their respective championships. For the 1999 season, Ford signed the Subaru World Rally Team star Colin McRae and Kankkunen moved to replace him at Subaru.

===1999–2000: Subaru===
Kankkunen&#x27;s first year with the Subaru World Rally Team and the Subaru Impreza WRC led to victories in Argentina and Finland. In Argentina, he took his first win in over five years, overtaking teammate Richard Burns on the last stage to win by a mere 2.4 seconds. Kankkunen was prepared to accept a team order in the form of a deliberate 10-second time penalty, but with the TV cameras filming, Subaru team principal David Richards stated that there would be no team orders. In his home event, Kankkunen beat Burns to what would be his final victory in the WRC. Despite a one-two for Subaru again at the season-ending RAC, Subaru lost the manufacturers&#x27; crown to Toyota by four points. For the third year in a row, Kankkunen placed fourth in the drivers&#x27; championship, while Mäkinen equalled Kankkunen&#x27;s record of four titles. Kankkunen&#x27;s 2000 season was a disappointment. His best result was second in the Safari Rally behind Burns. With only two other podium finishes to his name, Kankkunen placed eighth in the drivers&#x27; standings.

===Later career===

Subaru and Kankkunen did not reach a deal for 2001, and Kankkunen ended up competing in only one world rally during the season, the Rally Finland for the Hyundai factory team. He retired after his Accent WRC incurred several technical problems. For the 2002 season, Hyundai initially offered Kankkunen a full 14-event programme, which did not interest him, and the deal was modified to include only the nine gravel rallies. Despite a new evolution of the Accent WRC, Hyundai were unable to challenge the top teams: Peugeot, Ford and Subaru. Kankkunen&#x27;s fifth place in the Rally New Zealand was the team&#x27;s best result of the season. However, Kankkunen and the team&#x27;s full-time drivers Freddy Loix and Armin Schwarz did narrowly give Hyundai its career-best fourth place in the manufacturers&#x27; world championship. Kankkunen retired from the WRC after the season.

Following his retirement, Kankkunen announced his intention to enter politics, echoing the career path of rallying compatriot Ari Vatanen. In 2004, he ran for the European Parliament as a candidate of the conservative National Coalition Party. While Vatanen was re-elected, Kankkunen&#x27;s 17,815 votes were not enough to gain a seat. Kankkunen, a &quot;Flying Finn&quot; himself, was one of the shareholders in the now-bankrupt Flying Finn airline, the first low cost airline in Finland. The company&#x27;s first airplane was named after him. Kankkunen, along with former NHL star Jari Kurri, has also been a shareholder in a company that builds luxury real estate in Ruka, Finland.

In 2004 he signed with the works Volkswagen rally raid team and competed with them on the 2005 Dakar Rally. Following a roll, another competitor crashed into the stranded Touareg. Kankkunen was withdrawn from the event after the 10th stage.
In early 2007, Kankkunen set a new world speed record on ice in his privately owned Bentley Continental GT on the frozen Gulf of Bothnia near Oulu, Finland. He averaged in both directions on the &quot;flying kilometer&quot;, reaching a maximum speed of . Previously the record was held by a Bugatti EB110 Supersport. The Bentley was largely standard except a rollcage, some aerodynamic improvements and low-temperature fuel and calibration. Tires were from Nokian Tyres with spikes. Technical support was provided by Nokian and Bentley Motors. Kankkunen bettered the record to 330.695 km/h (205.48 mph) in 2011, driving an E85-powered Bentley Continental Supersports convertible. Bentley will release a limited edition of the Supersports to celebrate the achievement. The 100 models will be the most powerful road cars Bentley has ever produced.

It was announced on 23 July 2010 that Kankkunen would take part in the 2010 Rally Finland to mark the sixtieth jubilee of the event. He was joined by his long-time co-driver Juha Repo driving a Ford Focus RS WRC 08 for the Stobart M-Sport Ford Rally Team. At just over 51 years old, Kankkunen finished an impressive 8th, beating many WRC regulars.

==Personal life==
Kankkunen currently lives in Monaco but also spends time on his family farm in Laukaa, which includes a large country house and hundreds of hectares of land. He has a large car collection, which includes six Ferraris such as the F40 and the 288 GTO, as well as all the four rally cars with which he won the world championship. Kankkunen and his wife Pirjo filed for divorce in 2008. They have two sons named Tino and Niko. Juha&#x27;s father Pekka (1934–2013) and his brother Timo were also former rally drivers.

<doc id="412753" wikidata="Q272436" url="?curid=412753" title="Allergic rhinitis">
<text>Allergic rhinitis, of which the seasonal type is called hay fever, is a type of inflammation in the nose that occurs when the immune system overreacts to allergens in the air. It is classified as a type I hypersensitivity reaction. Signs and symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, red, itchy, and watery eyes, and swelling around the eyes. The fluid from the nose is usually clear. Symptom onset is often within minutes following allergen exposure, and can affect sleep and the ability to work or study. Some people may develop symptoms only during specific times of the year, often as a result of pollen exposure. Many people with allergic rhinitis also have asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis.
Allergic rhinitis is typically triggered by environmental allergens such as pollen, pet hair, dust, or mold. Inherited genetics and environmental exposures contribute to the development of allergies. Growing up on a farm and having multiple siblings decreases this risk. The underlying mechanism involves IgE antibodies that attach to an allergen, and subsequently result in the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells. It causes mucous membranes in the nose, eyes and throat to become inflamed and itchy as they work to eject the allergen. Diagnosis is typically based on a combination of symptoms and a skin prick test or blood tests for allergen-specific IgE antibodies. These tests, however, can give false positives. The symptoms of allergies resemble those of the common cold; however, they often last for more than two weeks and, despite the common name, typically do not include a fever.
Exposure to animals early in life might reduce the risk of developing these specific allergies. Several different types of medications reduce allergic symptoms, including nasal steroids, intranasal antihistamines such as olopatadine or azelastine, 2nd generation oral antihistamines such as loratadine, desloratadine, cetirizine, or fexofenadine; the mast cell stabilizer cromolyn sodium, and leukotriene receptor antagonists such as montelukast. Oftentimes, medications do not completely control symptoms, and they may also have side effects. Exposing people to larger and larger amounts of allergen, known as allergen immunotherapy, is often effective and is used when first line treatments fail to control symptoms. The allergen can be given as an injection under the skin or as a tablet under the tongue. Treatment typically lasts three to five years, after which benefits may be prolonged.
Allergic rhinitis is the type of allergy that affects the greatest number of people. In Western countries, between 10 and 30% of people are affected in a given year. It is most common between the ages of twenty and forty. The first accurate description is from the 10th-century physician Abu Bakr al-Razi. In 1859, Charles Blackley identified pollen as the cause. In 1906, the mechanism was determined by Clemens von Pirquet. The link with hay came about due to an early (and incorrect) theory that the symptoms were brought about by the smell of new hay.

==Signs and symptoms==

The characteristic symptoms of allergic rhinitis are: rhinorrhea (excess nasal secretion), itching, sneezing fits, and nasal congestion/obstruction. Characteristic physical findings include conjunctival swelling and erythema, eyelid swelling with Dennie–Morgan folds, lower eyelid venous stasis (rings under the eyes known as &quot;allergic shiners&quot;), swollen nasal turbinates, and middle ear effusion. Nasal endoscopy may show findings such as pale and boggy inferior turbinates from mucosal edema, stringy mucus throughout the nasal cavities, and cobblestoning.

There can also be behavioral signs; in order to relieve the irritation or flow of mucus, people may wipe or rub their nose with the palm of their hand in an upward motion: an action known as the &quot;nasal salute&quot; or the &quot;allergic salute&quot;. This may result in a crease running across the nose (or above each nostril if only one side of the nose is wiped at a time), commonly referred to as the &quot;transverse nasal crease&quot;, and can lead to permanent physical deformity if repeated enough.

People might also find that cross-reactivity occurs. For example, people allergic to birch pollen may also find that they have an allergic reaction to the skin of apples or potatoes. A clear sign of this is the occurrence of an itchy throat after eating an apple or sneezing when peeling potatoes or apples. This occurs because of similarities in the proteins of the pollen and the food. There are many cross-reacting substances. Hay fever is not a true fever, meaning it does not cause a core body temperature in the fever over .

==Cause==
Pollen is often considered as a cause of allergic rhinitis, hence called hay fever (See sub-section below).

Predisposing factors to allergic rhinitis include eczema (atopic dermatitis) and asthma. These three conditions can often occur together which is referred to as the atopic triad. Additionally, environmental exposures such as air pollution and maternal tobacco smoking can increase an individual&#x27;s chances of developing allergies.

===Pollen-related causes===
Allergic rhinitis triggered by the pollens of specific seasonal plants is commonly known as &quot;hay fever&quot;, because it is most prevalent during haying season. However, it is possible to have allergic rhinitis throughout the year. The pollen that causes hay fever varies between individuals and from region to region; in general, the tiny, hardly visible pollens of wind-pollinated plants are the predominant cause. The study of the dispersion of these bioaerosols is called Aerobiology. Pollens of insect-pollinated plants are too large to remain airborne and pose no risk. Examples of plants commonly responsible for hay fever include:
* Trees: such as pine (&quot;Pinus&quot;), mulberry (&quot;Morus&quot;), birch (&quot;Betula&quot;), alder (&quot;Alnus&quot;), cedar (&quot;Cedrus&quot;), hazel (&quot;Corylus&quot;), hornbeam (&quot;Carpinus&quot;), horse chestnut (&quot;Aesculus&quot;), willow (&quot;Salix&quot;), poplar (&quot;Populus&quot;), plane (&quot;Platanus&quot;), linden/lime (&quot;Tilia&quot;), and olive (&quot;Olea&quot;). In northern latitudes, birch is considered to be the most common allergenic tree pollen, with an estimated 15–20% of people with hay fever sensitive to birch pollen grains. A major antigen in these is a protein called Bet V I. Olive pollen is most predominant in Mediterranean regions. Hay fever in Japan is caused primarily by sugi (&quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot;) and hinoki (&quot;Chamaecyparis obtusa&quot;) tree pollen.
** &quot;Allergy friendly&quot; trees include: female ash, red maple, yellow poplar, dogwood, magnolia, double-flowered cherry, fir, spruce, and flowering plum.
* Grasses (Family Poaceae): especially ryegrass (&quot;Lolium&quot; sp.) and timothy (&quot;Phleum pratense&quot;). An estimated 90% of people with hay fever are allergic to grass pollen.
* Weeds: ragweed (&quot;Ambrosia&quot;), plantain (&quot;Plantago&quot;), nettle/parietaria (Urticaceae), mugwort (&quot;Artemisia Vulgaris&quot;), Fat hen (&quot;Chenopodium&quot;), and sorrel/dock (&quot;Rumex&quot;)

Allergic rhinitis may also be caused by allergy to Balsam of Peru, which is in various fragrances and other products.

===Genetic factors===
The causes and pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis are hypothesized to be affected by both genetic and environmental factors, with many recent studies focusing on specific loci that could be potential therapeutic targets for the disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of different loci and genetic pathways that seem to mediate the body&#x27;s response to allergens and promote the development of allergic rhinitis, with some of the most promising results coming from studies involving single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the interleukin-33 (IL-33) gene. The IL-33 protein that is encoded by the IL-33 gene is part of the interleukin family of cytokines that interact with T-helper 2 (Th2) cells, a specific type of T cell. Th2 cells contribute to the body&#x27;s inflammatory response to allergens, and specific ST2 receptors, also known as IL1RL1, on these cells bind to the ligand IL-33 protein. This IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway has been found to be one of the main genetic determinants in bronchial asthma pathogenesis, and because of the pathological linkage between asthma and rhinitis, the experimental focus of IL-33 has now turned to its role in the development of allergic rhinitis in humans and mouse models. Recently, it was found that allergic rhinitis patients expressed higher levels of IL-33 in their nasal epithelium and had a higher concentration of ST2 serum in nasal passageways following their exposure to pollen and other allergens, indicating that this gene and its associated receptor are expressed at a higher rate in allergic rhinitis patients. In a 2020 study on polymorphisms of the IL-33 gene and their link to allergic rhinitis within the Han Chinese population, researchers found that five SNPs specifically contributed to the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis, with three of those five SNPs previously identified as genetic determinants for asthma.

Another study focusing on Han Chinese children found that certain SNPs in the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 (PTPN22) gene and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) gene can be associated with childhood allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma. The encoded PTPN22 protein, which is found primarily in lymphoid tissue, acts as a post-translational regulator by removing phosphate groups from targeted proteins. Importantly, PTPN22 can affect the phosphorylation of T cell responses, and thus the subsequent proliferation of the T cells. As mentioned earlier, T cells contribute to the body&#x27;s inflammatory response in a variety of ways, so any changes to the cells&#x27; structure and function can have potentially deleterious effects on the body&#x27;s inflammatory response to allergens. To date, one SNP in the PTPN22 gene has been found to be significantly associated with allergic rhinitis onset in children. On the other hand, CTLA-4 is an immune-checkpoint protein that helps mediate and control the body&#x27;s immune response to prevent overactivation. It is expressed only in T cells as a glycoprotein for the Immunoglobulin (Ig) protein family, also known as antibodies. There have been two SNPs in CTLA-4 that were found to be significantly associated with childhood allergic rhinitis. Both SNPs most likely affect the associated protein&#x27;s shape and function, causing the body to exhibit an overactive immune response to the posed allergen. The polymorphisms in both genes are only beginning to be examined, therefore more research is needed to determine the severity of the impact of polymorphisms in the respective genes.

Finally, epigenetic alterations and associations are of particular interest to the study and ultimate treatment of allergic rhinitis. Specifically, microRNAs (miRNA) are hypothesized to be imperative to the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis due to the post-transcriptional regulation and repression of translation in their mRNA complement. Both miRNAs and their common carrier vessel exosomes have been found to play a role in the body&#x27;s immune and inflammatory responses to allergens. miRNAs are housed and packaged inside of exosomes until they are ready to be released into the section of the cell that they are coded to reside and act. Repressing the translation of proteins can ultimately repress parts of the body&#x27;s immune and inflammatory responses, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis and other autoimmune disorders. There are many miRNAs that have been deemed potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of allergic rhinitis by many different researchers, with the most widely studied being miR-133, miR-155, miR-205, miR-498, and let-7e.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis involves Th2 Helper T cell and IgE mediated inflammation with overactive function of the adaptive and innate immune systems. The process begins when an aeroallergen penetrates the nasal mucosal barrier. This barrier may be more permeable in susceptible individuals. The allergen is then engulfed by an antigen presenting cell (APC) (such as a dendritic cell). The APC then presents the antigen to a Naive CD4+ helper T cell stimulating it to differentiate into a Th2 helper T cell. The Th2 helper T cell then secretes inflammatory cytokines including IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-14, and IL-31. These inflammatory cytokines stimulate B cells to differentiate into plasma cells and release allergen specific IgE immunoglobulins. The IgE immunoglobulins attach to mast cells. The inflammatory cytokines also recruit inflammatory cells such as basophils, eosinophils and fibroblasts to the area. The person is now sensitized, and upon re-exposure to the allergen, mast cells with allergen specific IgE will bind the allergens and release inflammatory molecules including histamine, leukotrienes, platelet activating factor, prostaglandins and thromboxane with these inflammatory molecules&#x27; local effects on blood vessels (dilation), mucous glands (secrete mucous) and sensory nerves (activation) leading to the clinical signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

Disruption of the nasal mucosal epithelial barrier may also release alarmins (a type of damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule) such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL-25 and IL-33 which activate group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) which then also releases inflammatory cytokines leading to activation of immune cells.

==Diagnosis==

Allergy testing may reveal the specific allergens to which an individual is sensitive. Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing. This may include a patch test to determine if a particular substance is causing the rhinitis, or an intradermal, scratch, or other test. Less commonly, the suspected allergen is dissolved and dropped onto the lower eyelid as a means of testing for allergies. This test should be done only by a physician, since it can be harmful if done improperly. In some individuals not able to undergo skin testing (as determined by the doctor), the RAST blood test may be helpful in determining specific allergen sensitivity. Peripheral eosinophilia can be seen in differential leukocyte count.

Allergy testing is not definitive. At times, these tests can reveal positive results for certain allergens that are not actually causing symptoms, and can also not pick up allergens that do cause an individual&#x27;s symptoms. The intradermal allergy test is more sensitive than the skin prick test, but is also more often positive in people that do not have symptoms to that allergen.

Even if a person has negative skin-prick, intradermal and blood tests for allergies, they may still have allergic rhinitis, from a local allergy in the nose. This is called local allergic rhinitis. Specialized testing is necessary to diagnose local allergic rhinitis.

===Classification===
* Seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever): Caused by seasonal peaks in the airborne load of pollens.
* Perennial allergic rhinitis (nonseasonal allergic rhinitis; atopic rhinitis): Caused by allergens present throughout the year (e.g., dander).

Allergic rhinitis may be seasonal, perennial, or episodic. Seasonal allergic rhinitis occurs in particular during pollen seasons. It does not usually develop until after 6 years of age. Perennial allergic rhinitis occurs throughout the year. This type of allergic rhinitis is commonly seen in younger children.

Allergic rhinitis may also be classified as mild-intermittent, moderate-severe intermittent, mild-persistent, and moderate-severe persistent. Intermittent is when the symptoms occur &lt;4 days per week or &lt;4 consecutive weeks. Persistent is when symptoms occur &gt;4 days/week and &gt;4 consecutive weeks. The symptoms are considered mild with normal sleep, no impairment of daily activities, no impairment of work or school, and if symptoms are not troublesome. Severe symptoms result in sleep disturbance, impairment of daily activities, and impairment of school or work.

===Local allergic rhinitis===
Local allergic rhinitis is an allergic reaction in the nose to an allergen, without systemic allergies. So skin-prick and blood tests for allergy are negative, but there are IgE antibodies produced in the nose that react to a specific allergen. Intradermal skin testing may also be negative.

The symptoms of local allergic rhinitis are the same as the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, including symptoms in the eyes. Just as with allergic rhinitis, people can have either seasonal or perennial local allergic rhinitis. The symptoms of local allergic rhinitis can be mild, moderate, or severe. Local allergic rhinitis is associated with conjunctivitis and asthma.

In one study, about 25% of people with rhinitis had local allergic rhinitis. In several studies, over 40% of people having been diagnosed with nonallergic rhinitis were found to actually have local allergic rhinitis. Steroid nasal sprays and oral antihistamines have been found to be effective for local allergic rhinitis.

As of 2014, local allergenic rhinitis had mostly been investigated in Europe; in the United States, the nasal provocation testing necessary to diagnose the condition was not widely available.

==Prevention==
Prevention often focuses on avoiding specific allergens that cause an individual&#x27;s symptoms. These methods include not having pets, not having carpets or upholstered furniture in the home, and keeping the home dry. Specific anti-allergy zippered covers on household items like pillows and mattresses have also proven to be effective in preventing dust mite allergies.

Studies have shown that growing up on a farm and having many older siblings can decrease an individual&#x27;s risk for developing allergic rhinitis.

Studies in young children have shown that there is higher risk of allergic rhinitis in those who have early exposure to foods or formula or heavy exposure to cigarette smoking within the first year of life.

==Treatment==
The goal of rhinitis treatment is to prevent or reduce the symptoms caused by the inflammation of affected tissues. Measures that are effective include avoiding the allergen. Intranasal corticosteroids are the preferred medical treatment for persistent symptoms, with other options if this is not effective. Second line therapies include antihistamines, decongestants, cromolyn, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and nasal irrigation. Antihistamines by mouth are suitable for occasional use with mild intermittent symptoms. Mite-proof covers, air filters, and withholding certain foods in childhood do not have evidence supporting their effectiveness.

===Antihistamines===
Antihistamine drugs can be taken orally and nasally to control symptoms such as sneezing, rhinorrhea, itching, and conjunctivitis.

It is best to take oral antihistamine medication before exposure, especially for seasonal allergic rhinitis. In the case of nasal antihistamines like azelastine antihistamine nasal spray, relief from symptoms is experienced within 15 minutes allowing for a more immediate &#x27;as-needed&#x27; approach to dosage. There is not enough evidence of antihistamine efficacy as an add-on therapy with nasal steroids in the management of intermittent or persistent allergic rhinitis in children, so its adverse effects and additional costs must be considered.

Ophthalmic antihistamines (such as azelastine in eye drop form and ketotifen) are used for conjunctivitis, while intranasal forms are used mainly for sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritus.

Antihistamine drugs can have undesirable side-effects, the most notable one being drowsiness in the case of oral antihistamine tablets. First-generation antihistamine drugs such as diphenhydramine cause drowsiness, while second- and third-generation antihistamines such as fexofenadine and loratadine are less likely to.

Pseudoephedrine is also indicated for vasomotor rhinitis. It is used only when nasal congestion is present and can be used with antihistamines. In the United States, oral decongestants containing pseudoephedrine must be purchased behind the pharmacy counter in an effort to prevent the manufacturing of methamphetamine. Desloratadine/pseudoephedrine can also be used for this condition

===Steroids===

Intranasal corticosteroids are used to control symptoms associated with sneezing, rhinorrhea, itching, and nasal congestion. Steroid nasal sprays are effective and safe, and may be effective without oral antihistamines. They take several days to act and so must be taken continually for several weeks, as their therapeutic effect builds up with time.

In 2013, a study compared the efficacy of mometasone furoate nasal spray to betamethasone oral tablets for the treatment of people with seasonal allergic rhinitis and found that the two have virtually equivalent effects on nasal symptoms in people.

Systemic steroids such as prednisone tablets and intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide or glucocorticoid (such as betamethasone) injection are effective at reducing nasal inflammation, but their use is limited by their short duration of effect and the side-effects of prolonged steroid therapy.

===Other===
Other measures that may be used second line include: decongestants, cromolyn, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and nonpharmacologic therapies such as nasal irrigation.

Topical decongestants may also be helpful in reducing symptoms such as nasal congestion, but should not be used for long periods, as stopping them after protracted use can lead to a rebound nasal congestion called rhinitis medicamentosa.

For nocturnal symptoms, intranasal corticosteroids can be combined with nightly oxymetazoline, an adrenergic alpha-agonist, or an antihistamine nasal spray without risk of rhinitis medicamentosa.

Nasal saline irrigation (a practice where salt water is poured into the nostrils), may have benefits in both adults and children in relieving the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and it is unlikely to be associated with adverse effects.

===Allergen immunotherapy===
Allergen immunotherapy, also called desensitization, treatment involves administering doses of allergens to accustom the body to substances that are generally harmless (pollen, house dust mites), thereby inducing specific long-term tolerance. Allergen immunotherapy is the only treatment that alters the disease mechanism. Immunotherapy can be administered orally (as sublingual tablets or sublingual drops), or by injections under the skin (subcutaneous). Subcutaneous immunotherapy is the most common form and has the largest body of evidence supporting its effectiveness.

===Alternative medicine===
There are no forms of complementary or alternative medicine that are evidence-based for allergic rhinitis. Therapeutic efficacy of alternative treatments such as acupuncture and homeopathy is not supported by available evidence. While some evidence shows that acupuncture is effective for rhinitis, specifically targeting the sphenopalatine ganglion acupoint, these trials are still limited. Overall, the quality of evidence for complementary-alternative medicine is not strong enough to be recommended by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.

==Epidemiology==
Allergic rhinitis is the type of allergy that affects the greatest number of people. In Western countries, between 10 and 30 percent of people are affected in a given year. It is most common between the ages of twenty and forty.

==History==
The first accurate description is from the 10th century physician Rhazes. Pollen was identified as the cause in 1859 by Charles Blackley. In 1906 the mechanism was determined by Clemens von Pirquet. The link with hay came about due to an early (and incorrect) theory that the symptoms were brought about by the smell of new hay. Although the scent per se is irrelevant, the correlation with hay checks out, as peak hay-harvesting season overlaps with peak pollen season, and hay-harvesting work puts people in close contact with seasonal allergens.

<text>The naval Battle of Pylos took place in 425 BC during the Peloponnesian War at the peninsula of Pylos, on the present-day Bay of Navarino in Messenia, and was an Athenian victory over Sparta. An Athenian fleet had been driven ashore at Pylos by a storm, and, at the instigation of Demosthenes, the Athenian soldiers fortified the peninsula, and a small force was left there when the fleet departed again. The establishment of an Athenian garrison in Spartan territory frightened the Spartan leadership, and the Spartan army, which had been ravaging Attica under the command of Agis, ended their expedition (the expedition only lasted 15 days) and marched home, while the Spartan fleet at Corcyra sailed to Pylos.

Demosthenes had five triremes and their complements of soldiers as a garrison, and was reinforced by 40 hoplites from a Messenian ship that happened to stop at Pylos. In total, Demosthenes probably had about 600 men, only 90 of which were hoplites. He sent two of his triremes to intercept the Athenian fleet and inform Sophocles and Eurymedon of his danger. The Spartans, meanwhile, had 43 triremes and a large land army. Finding himself thus outnumbered, Demosthenes pulled his remaining three triremes up on land and armed their crews with whatever weapons were at hand. He placed the largest part of his force at the strongly fortified point facing the land. Demosthenes then hand-picked 60 hoplites and a few archers and brought them to the point where he anticipated the Spartans would launch their amphibious assault. Demosthenes expected that the Spartans would hit the south-west corner of the peninsula where the defensive wall was the weakest and the land was most suitable for a landing. The Spartans attacked where Demosthenes had expected, and the Athenians were faced with simultaneous assaults from land and sea. The Athenians held off the Spartans for a day and a half, however, causing the Spartans to cease their attempts to storm Pylos and instead settled in for a siege.

While the Spartans&#x27; siege preparations were underway, the Athenian fleet, 50 triremes strong, arrived from Zacynthus. The Spartans failed to blockade the entrance of the harbour, so the Athenians were able to sail in and catch the Spartans unprepared; the Spartan fleet was decisively defeated, and the Athenians gained control of the harbour. In doing so, they trapped 420 Spartan hoplites on the island of Sphacteria, off Pylos. 120 of these were from the Spartiate class, and their peril threw the Spartan government into a panic. Members of the government were dispatched to the scene, and negotiated an armistice on the spot; the entire Spartan fleet was surrendered to the Athenians as a guarantee for Spartan good conduct, and ambassadors were sent to Athens to seek a permanent peace. When these negotiations failed, the Athenians retained possession of the Spartan ships on a pretext, and settled in to besiege the hoplites on Sphacteria; eventually, in the Battle of Sphacteria, those hoplites were captured and taken as hostages to Athens. Pylos remained in Athenian hands, and was used as a base for raids into Spartan territory and as a refuge for fleeing Spartan Helots.

==Prelude==
In the summer of 425 BC, an Athenian fleet commanded by Eurymedon and Sophocles, with Demosthenes aboard as an advisor, sailed from Athens to campaign in Sicily and assist Athens&#x27; democratic allies at Corcyra. Demosthenes held no official position at the time, but was a strategos-elect for the Hellenic year that would begin in midsummer 425, and the two generals had been instructed to allow him to use the fleet around the Peloponnese if he wished. Once the fleet was at sea, Demosthenes revealed his plan, which he had previously kept secret; he wished to land at and fortify Pylos, which he believed to be a particularly promising site for a forward outpost. (Pylos was a good distance from Sparta by march, and commanded an excellent harbour in the Bay of Navarino.). The generals rejected this plan, but Demosthenes caught a stroke of luck when a storm blew and drove the fleet to the shore at Pylos. Even then the generals refused to order the fortification of the promontory, and Demosthenes was similarly rebuffed when he attempted to appeal directly to the troops and subordinate commanders; only when the boredom of waiting out the storm overcame the Athenians did they set to work building fortifications. Once they began, however, the Athenians worked hard and quickly, and the promontory was fortified and defensible within a few days. The fleet sailed off towards Corcyra, where a Spartan fleet of 60 ships was operating, leaving Demosthenes with five ships and their complements of sailors and soldiers to defend the new fort.

The Spartan government was initially unconcerned with the Athenians&#x27; presence at Pylos, assuming that they would soon depart. Once it became clear, however, that Demosthenes and his men intended to hold the site, the Eurypontid king of Sparta, Agis, who was at the head of an army ravaging Attica, turned for home, cutting his invasion short after only 15 days in Athenian territory. Once he reached home, Spartan forces immediately moved towards Pylos, the fleet at Corcyra was ordered to sail there immediately, and a summons was sent out calling allied states around the Peloponnese to send troops. The Spartan fleet managed to slip past the Athenian fleet at Zacynthus, but Demosthenes anticipated its arrival and dispatched two of his triremes to inform the Athenian fleet of Pylos&#x27; plight; that fleet set out for Pylos as soon as it received the news. Pylos, meanwhile, had been reinforced by the arrival of a privateer with a cargo of arms, which were distributed to the sailors, and by a Messenian pinnace, which brought 40 more hoplites to defend the peninsula. (Donald Kagan has asserted that these apparently fortuitous arrivals must have been the result of planning by Demosthenes.) To meet the imminent Spartan attack, Demosthenes divided his force, placing most of his men at the point where the promontory touched the mainland, while he with 60 hoplites and a few archers waited at the point facing out to sea where the Athenian wall was weakest. When the Spartan fleet arrived, the Spartans prepared to blockade the entrance to the harbour by placing hoplites on the island of Sphacteria, which was in the middle of the entrance, and planned to place ships in the gaps on either side of that island when the Athenian fleet arrived.

==Battle==
The Spartans assaulted the Athenian fortifications on Pylos from both land and sea. The sea attack came exactly where Demosthenes had expected it would, and he was thus in place to meet it with his men. The landing was difficult at the point of attack, so only a few of the 43 triremes were able to approach the beach at a time. The Spartan captains, following the example of Brasidas, drove their ships into the rocky shore to give their men a chance to disembark and drive the Athenians back, but the defenders refused to give, and repeated waves of attacks failed to break them. The tactic of trying to land troops on a beach facing stiff hoplite resistance was known to be notoriously difficult during this era. These attacks continued for an entire day and then part of the next, but after that the Spartans resigned themselves to a siege and dispatched several ships to bring wood for building siege engines.

On the day after the cessation of attacks, however, the Athenian fleet arrived from Zacynthus. It was too late that day to attack, so the Athenians spent the night on a nearby island, hoping to draw the Spartans out into the open sea to battle. The Spartans refused to take this bait, but the next morning the Athenians sailed in both entrances to the harbour, which the Spartans had failed to block, and quickly routed the Spartan fleet (Donald Kagan has suggested that the Spartans&#x27; failure to blockade the entrances indicates that they could not do so, and that their plan was thus fatally flawed from the outset). Pursuit was limited by the size of the harbour, but the Athenians captured some triremes at sea and then landed to attempt to seize the Spartan ships once they reached land. A fierce fight ensued, in which the Athenians were eventually unable to seize more than a few ships, withdrawing after heavy casualties had been suffered by both sides. At the end of the battle, the Athenians controlled the harbour, and were able to sail freely around the island of Sphacteria; they guarded the island closely, ensuring that the hoplites trapped there were unable to escape.

==Aftermath==

News of the crisis at Pylos shocked the government of Sparta, and members of the government were immediately dispatched to the scene to negotiate an armistice. This reaction to the potential capture of a mere 420 soldiers may seem extreme, but is explained by the fact that the 120 Spartiates on the island composed probably one tenth of that elite class, on which the Spartan government was based. The Spartan negotiators met with the Athenian generals at Pylos and quickly arranged an immediate cessation of hostilities. The Spartans were permitted to take food to the men on the island, and sent an embassy to Athens immediately to negotiate for a more permanent peace; all the Spartan ships, meanwhile, were surrendered to the Athenians as security for Spartan good conduct.

When the negotiators reached Athens, they made a speech to the Athenian assembly in which they argued that the Athenians should take advantage of the opportunity they had to make peace. The Spartans, they claimed, had suffered a misfortune not through incapacity or overreaching, but through mere bad luck; the Athenians should seize this opportunity to have peace with them on good terms. This proposal, however, met with derision from the Athenian statesman Cleon; he demanded far harsher terms, which would have given Athens control over Megara and compelled Sparta to abandon several important allies. In his speech, he recalled the concessions Athens had been forced to make in the Thirty Years&#x27; Peace of 445 BC, when the Athenians had been at a similar momentary disadvantage. Cleon&#x27;s terms, Donald Kagan has argued, represented a recognition that the Athenians had little to gain from a peace which surrendered the advantage they had just won without impairing the Spartans&#x27; ability to make war, while they might secure far better terms in the future by pressing their advantage. When the Spartans asked to discuss these proposals in private, Cleon demanded that they say whatever they had to say in public. By doing so, he guaranteed that the Spartans would be forced to cut off the negotiations (since they could hardly discuss betraying their allies in public), hastening the moment when the Athenians would be free to move against Sphacteria.

The Spartan ambassadors returned home, and the armistice at Pylos came to an end. The Athenians, alleging that the Spartans had violated the terms of the armistice by attacking their wall, refused to hand the Spartan ships back over. Both sides settled in to fight out the fate of the men on Sphacteria; the result would be decided later at the Battle of Sphacteria.

<text>Long Eaton is a town in the Erewash district of Derbyshire, England, just north of the River Trent, about south-west of Nottingham and south-east of Derby. The town population was 37,760 at the 2011 census. It has been part of Erewash borough since 1 April 1974, when Long Eaton Urban District was disbanded.

==Geography==
Long Eaton lies in Derbyshire, across the border of Nottinghamshire and close to Leicestershire. It is covered by the Nottingham post town, and has a Nottingham telephone area code (0115). Long Eaton sits on the banks of the River Trent. Long Eaton is part of the Greater Nottingham urban area.

==History==
Long Eaton is referred to as &quot;Aitone&quot;, in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. Several origins have been suggested, for example &quot;farm between streams&quot; and &quot;low-lying land&quot;. It was a farming settlement that grew up close to the lowest bridging point of the River Erewash.

The &quot;Great Fire&quot; of Long Eaton in 1694 destroyed 14 houses and several other buildings in the market place.

The village remained a stable size until the construction of the Midland Counties Railway in 1839 and the Erewash Valley Line in 1844, which brought links that encouraged growth. Two industries came to employ many people in the growing town: lace-making and railway wagon manufacturing. A large railway yard at Toton Sidings grew up just north of the town.

By 1900 the town population exceeded 10,000, after construction of housing, offices and factories through the Victorian period. In 1921 its extent was broadened to include Wilsthorpe and parts of Sandiacre and Sawley.

==Notable architecture==

One notable building is the Palladian Long Eaton Town Hall. Originally a private house, it is now owned by the borough council and forms part of the expanded offices of Erewash Borough Council, which opened in 1991.

The Parish Church of St Laurence stands to the east of the Market Place. Local tradition dates parts of it to the 11th century, possibly built under Viking King Cnut. However, some place the oldest parts of the church after the Norman Conquest, possibly in the 12th century. It was originally a daughter church of All Saints&#x27; Church, Sawley, but gained separate status in the 19th century.

The other religious buildings of note are: 
*St John the Evangelist (Church of England), College Street (1916–22) by Sir Charles Nicholson
*St James’ Church, Tamworth Road, (1886) by John Sheldon
*St Francis of Assisi Church (Roman Catholic), Tamworth Road (1929–30) by Foden, Hemm and Williams of Manchester.
*Christ Church (Methodist), Derby Road, (1903–04) by Arthur Brewill and Basil Baily
*Oasis Christian Centre, Derby Road (1904) by George Baines 
*Baptist Church, Station Road (1880) by Mr Keating of Nottingham.
There are several fine examples of industrial architecture in Long Eaton. Most have to do with its development as a lace-making centre. By 1907, the town housed almost 1,400 lace machines and the industry employed over 4,000 people (a quarter of the population). High Street Mill dates from 1857. West End Mill of 1882 was built alongside the Erewash Canal on Leopold Street. The adjacent Whiteley’s Mill was erected in 1883. Bridge Mill on Derby Road was built between 1902-06 by John Sheldon. One of the largest lace-making mills, Harrington Mill, was built in 1885. It took one and a quarter million bricks to build the 167-metre long factory and it has 224 cast-iron windows down one side. Harrington Mill is a traditional, four-storey, red lace mill, built by a consortium of manufacturers. The turrets on the sides house the original staircases.
The floors above the shops in High Street and the Market Place show that large parts of the centre were built in Victorian or early 20th-century times. The New Central Building is an example of late Victorian architecture.

Near the Market Place, the significant buildings are 1 Derby Road, Barclays Bank (1898) by Ernest Reginald Ridgway, 24 Market Place, Halifax Building Society, built as Smith&#x27;s Bank, (1889) by Fothergill Watson, (Grade II listed), Therm House (1838–39) by Dodd &amp; Wilcox, 41 Market Place, HSBC bank, built as the Nottingham Joint Stock Bank and later the Midland Bank, (1892) by Albert Nelson Bromley (Grade II listed) and the NatWest Bank, (1903) by John Sheldon.

Numbers 38 and 40 Market Place are particularly notable as being built in the Art Nouveau style by local architects &quot;Gorman and Ross&quot;. Number 38 is York Chambers built in 1901, and number 40 was built for the Midland Counties District Bank in 1903. Both are now Grade II listed.

&quot;Gorman and Ross&quot; also provided the Carnegie Library on Tamworth Road, again in the Art Nouveau style, in 1906. The Long Eaton War Memorial Cross was erected in the Market Place in 1921.

The High Street and Market Place were pedestrianised in the 1990s. The work to enhance the layout and paving of the town centre was completed in 2010.
==Transport==

Long Eaton railway station is sited on the Midland Main Line. It is served by two train operating companies:

* East Midlands Railway provide inter-city services between Sheffield and London St Pancras, via Chesterfield, Derby and Leicester; these services call hourly. There are also hourly services between Newark Castle, Derby and Crewe; trains between Nottingham and Matlock also call hourly.
* CrossCountry provide hourly services in each direction between Nottingham, Birmingham and Cardiff.

Bus services in Long Eaton are provided primarily by Trent Barton and CT4N. Routes connect the town with Nottingham, Beeston, Stapleford, Sandiacre, Derby, East Midlands Airport and Coalville.

The main road through the town forms part of the A6005. Junction 25 of the M1 motorway is on its north-western border.

The broad Erewash Canal passes through the town.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are BBC East Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Waltham TV 
transmitter, and the Nottingham relay transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Nottingham, BBC Radio Derby, Smooth East Midlands, Hits Radio East Midlands, Capital East Midlands, Greatest Hits Radio Midlands and Erewash Sound, a community based radio station.

The town is served by the local newspapers, Nottingham Post and Nottingham Journal.

==Schools==
Long Eaton has two state secondary schools, The Long Eaton School and Wilsthorpe School, and several primary schools, including Brooklands, St Lawrence, Dovedale, Sawley, Harrington, English Martyrs, Longmoor and Grange. It also contains the public school Trent College (founded 1868), the private Elms School for ages 3–11, and two special needs schools: Stanton Vale and Brackenfield SEND School.

Long Eaton School was split into two sites: Lower for years 7, 8 and 9, and Upper for years 10, 11 and sixth form. The Lower School building, opened in 1965, was demolished in 2006, when new school premises were built next door on the same grounds. Upper and Lower are now in one building again (with sixth Form being slightly apart), which was opened by Gordon Brown as Chancellor of the Exchequer. It has become an eco school with an eco club, and recently joined the Archway Trust. There is a research-grade telescope built on school grounds., where stargazing sessions have been open to the public in the past. It previously had partnership and student exchange relations with Spanish, French, Italian and Chinese schools.

In 2005 Wilsthorpe School gained specialist status in business and enterprise. In 2018, the school was rebuilt. Both Wilsthorpe and Long Eaton schools have an OFSTED rating of &quot;good&quot;.

==Brass band==
Long Eaton Silver Prize brass band is one of only two still functioning in Erewash. It was formed in 1906 after severing from a local temperance society. At its height, it reached the Brass Band Second Section. The original club building in Sailsbury Street closed in early 2015, but the band itself plays on.

In 2006, its centenary year, the band won the Midland Area Regional Championships, its first contest win since 1966. This secured promotion back to the Second Section and an invitation to the National Championships of Great Britain. The band also won this contest, in what were its best contest results since 1927.

==Sport==
Long Eaton United F.C. plays in the Midland Football League, as founder members in 2014. The club was formed in 1956 but records show football prominent in the town for many years before. The Football Club has many junior sides and gained FA Charter Standard Community Club status in 2013. It also has a ladies&#x27; team competing in the East Midlands Women&#x27;s Football League.

Long Eaton RFC is a Rugby Union club, established in 1969.

Long Eaton Swimming Club, one of Derbyshire&#x27;s largest, arose in 2007, when the Trident and Treonte swimming clubs merged. It covers all levels, from learners to competitive senior and master swimmers. Its home pool is at West Park Leisure Centre.

Long Eaton Cricket Club, established in 1972, currently has three senior teams competing in the South Nottinghamshire Cricket League, two Sunday league teams in the Newark Club Cricket Alliance league and a junior training section that plays competitive cricket in the Erewash Young Cricketers League.

Sawley Cricket Club moved onto West Park from nearby Sawley park in 1977. It has four senior teams competing in the Derbyshire County Cricket League and a junior training section that plays competitively in the Erewash Young Cricketers League.

Long Eaton Park Croquet Club (LEPCC) was founded in 1980 and is located behind the West Park Leisure Centre. The club is a full member of the Croquet Association and is an active member of the Federation of East Midlands Croquet Clubs (FEMCC).

Long Eaton Speedway raced at the Long Eaton Stadium in Station Road. The first meet was held on 18 May 1929. The Long Eaton Invaders became National Speedway Champions in 1984. However, the speedway stadium closed in 1997 and its site is held by an estate of houses and flats and by a playing field for Grange Primary School.

Long Eaton Rangers F.C. was founded in 1889 but left the Midland League in 1899.

==Recreation==
The main park is West Park which has a café and neighbours West Park Leisure Centre. 
Long Eaton holds an annual &quot;Chestnut Fair&quot; in November.

In a tradition which started in 1931, the town hosts an annual Carnival each year – currently on the third Saturday in June. The event commences with a parade of floats, decorated vehicles and walkers in fancy dress, which circulates round the town. It continues in the afternoon and evening with a range of entertainment, stalls and a funfair on the Carnival showground on West Park.

<doc id="412765" wikidata="Q11680670" url="?curid=412765" title="Organic certification">
<text>Organic certification is a certification process for producers of organic food and other organic agricultural products. In general, any business directly involved in food production can be certified, including seed suppliers, farmers, food processors, retailers and restaurants. A lesser known counterpart is certification for organic textiles (or organic clothing) that includes certification of textile products made from organically grown fibres.

Requirements vary from country to country (List of countries with organic agriculture regulation), and generally involve a set of production standards for growing, storage, processing, packaging and shipping that include:
* avoidance of synthetic chemical inputs (e.g. fertilizer, pesticides, antibiotics, food additives), irradiation, and the use of sewage sludge;
* avoidance of genetically modified seed;
* use of farmland that has been free from prohibited chemical inputs for a number of years (often, three or more);
* for livestock, adhering to specific requirements for feed, housing, and breeding;
* keeping detailed written production and sales records (audit trail);
* maintaining strict physical separation of organic products from non-certified products;
* undergoing periodic on-site inspections.

In some countries, certification is overseen by the government, and commercial use of the term &quot;organic&quot; is legally restricted. Certified organic producers are also subject to the same agricultural, food safety and other government regulations that apply to non-certified producers.

Certified organic foods are not necessarily pesticide-free, as certain pesticides are allowed.

==Purpose==
Organic certification addresses a growing worldwide demand for organic food. It is intended to assure quality, prevent fraud, and to promote commerce. While such certification was not necessary in the early days of the organic movement, when small farmers would sell their produce directly at farmers&#x27; markets, as organics have grown in popularity, more and more consumers are purchasing organic food through traditional channels, such as supermarkets. As such, consumers must rely on third-party regulatory certification.

For organic producers, certification identifies suppliers of products approved for use in certified operations. For consumers, &quot;certified organic&quot; serves as a product assurance, similar to &quot;low fat&quot;, &quot;100% whole wheat&quot;, or &quot;no artificial preservatives&quot;.

Certification is essentially aimed at regulating and facilitating the sale of organic products to consumers. Individual certification bodies have their own service marks, which can act as branding to consumers—a certifier may promote the high consumer recognition value of its logo as a marketing advantage to producers.

==Methods==

===Third-party===
In third party certification, the farm or the processing of the agriculture produce is certified in accordance with national or international organic standards by an accredited organic certification agency. To certify a farm, the farmer is typically required to engage in a number of new activities, in addition to normal farming operations:
* Study the organic standards, which cover in specific detail what is and is not allowed for every aspect of farming, including storage, transport and sale.
* Compliance — farm facilities and production methods must comply with the standards, which may involve modifying facilities, sourcing and changing suppliers, etc.
* Documentation — extensive paperwork is required, detailing farm history and current set-up, and usually including results of soil and water tests.
* Planning — a written annual production plan must be submitted, detailing everything from seed to sale: seed sources, field and crop locations, fertilization and pest control activities, harvest methods, storage locations, etc.
* Inspection — annual on-farm inspections are required, with a physical tour, examination of records, and an oral interview. The vast majority of the inspections are pre-scheduled visits.
* Fee — an annual inspection/certification fee (currently starting at $400–$2,000/year, in the US and Canada, depending on the agency and the size of the operation). There are financial assistance programs for qualifying certified operations.
* Record-keeping — written, day-to-day farming and marketing records, covering all activities, must be available for inspection at any time.

In addition, short-notice or surprise inspections can be made, and specific tests (e.g. soil, water, plant tissue) may be requested.

For first-time farm certification, the soil must meet basic requirements of being free from use of prohibited substances (synthetic chemicals, etc.) for a number of years. A conventional farm must adhere to organic standards for this period, often two to three years. This is known as being in &quot;transition&quot;. Transitional crops are not considered fully organic.

Certification for operations other than farms follows a similar process. The focus is on the quality of ingredients and other inputs, and processing and handling conditions. A transport company would be required to detail the use and maintenance of its vehicles, storage facilities, containers, and so forth. A restaurant would have its premises inspected and its suppliers verified as certified organic.

===Participatory===
Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS) represent an alternative to third party certification, especially adapted to local markets and short supply chains. They can also complement third party certification with a private label that brings additional guarantees and transparency. PGS enable the direct participation of producers, consumers and other stakeholders in:
* the choice and definition of the standards
* the development and implementation of certification procedures
* the certification decisions
Participatory Guarantee Systems are also referred to as &quot;participatory certification&quot;.

===Alternative certification options===
The word &quot;organic&quot; is central to the certification (and organic food marketing) process, and this is also questioned by some. Where organic laws exist, producers cannot use the term legally without certification. To bypass this legal requirement for certification, various alternative certification approaches, using currently undefined terms like &quot;authentic&quot; and &quot;natural&quot;, are emerging. In the US, motivated by the cost and legal requirements of certification (as of Oct. 2002), the private farmer-to-farmer association, Certified Naturally Grown, offers a &quot;non-profit alternative eco-labelling program for small farms that grow using USDA Organic methods but are not a part of the USDA Certified Organic program.&quot;

In the UK, the interests of smaller-scale growers who use &quot;natural&quot; growing methods are represented by the Wholesome Food Association, which issues a symbol based largely on trust and peer-to-peer inspection.

==Organic certification and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)==
Organic certification, as well as fair trade certification, has the potential to directly and indirectly contribute to the achievement of some of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which are the eight international development goals that were established following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000, with all United Nations member states committed to help achieve the MDGs by 2015. With the growth of ethical consumerism in developed countries, imports of eco-friendly and socially certified produce from the poor in developing countries have increased, which could contribute towards the achievement of the MDGs. A study by Setboonsarng (2008) reveals that organic certification substantially contributes to MDG1 (poverty and hunger) and MDG7 (environmental sustainability) by way of premium prices and better market access, among others. This study concludes that for this market-based development scheme to broaden its poverty impacts, public sector support in harmonizing standards, building up the capacity of certifiers, developing infrastructure development, and innovating alternative certification systems will be required.

==International food standards==
The body Codex Alimentarius of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations was established in November 1961. The Commission&#x27;s main goals are to protect the health of consumers and ensure fair practices in the international food trade. The Codex Alimentarius is recognized by the World Trade Organization as an international reference point for the resolution of disputes concerning food safety and consumer protection. One of their goals is to provide proper food labelling (general standard, guidelines on nutrition labelling, guidelines on labelling claims).

==National variations==
In some countries, organic standards are formulated and overseen by the government. The United States, the European Union, Canada and Japan have comprehensive organic legislation, and the term &quot;organic&quot; may be used only by certified producers. Being able to put the word &quot;organic&quot; on a food product is a valuable marketing advantage in today&#x27;s consumer market, but does not guarantee the product is legitimately organic. Certification is intended to protect consumers from misuse of the term, and make buying organics easy. However, the organic labeling made possible by certification itself usually requires explanation. In countries without organic laws, government guidelines may or may not exist, while certification is handled by non-profit organizations and private companies.

Internationally, equivalency negotiations are underway, and some agreements are already in place, to harmonize certification between countries, facilitating international trade. There are also international certification bodies, including members of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) working on harmonization efforts. Where formal agreements do not exist between countries, organic product for export is often certified by agencies from the importing countries, who may establish permanent foreign offices for this purpose. In 2011 IFOAM introduced a new program—the IFOAM Family of Standards—that attempts to simplify harmonization. The vision is to establish the use of one single global reference (the COROS) to access the quality of standards rather than focusing on bilateral agreements.

The Certcost was a research project that conducted research and prepared reports about the certification of organic food. The project was supported by the European Commission and was active from 2008 to 2011. The website will be available until 2016.

===North America===

====United States====

In the United States, &quot;organic&quot; is a labeling term for food or agricultural products (&quot;food, feed or fiber&quot;) that have been produced according to USDA organic regulations, which define standards that &quot;integrate cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity&quot;. USDA standards recognize four types of organic production:
* Crops: &quot;Plants that are grown to be harvested as food, livestock feed, or fiber used to add nutrients to the field.&quot;
* Livestock: &quot;Animals that can be used in the production of food, fiber, or feed.&quot;
* Processed/multi-ingredient products: &quot;Items that have been handled and packaged (e.g. chopped carrots) or combined, processed, and packaged (e.g. bread or soup).&quot;
* Wild crops: &quot;Plants from a growing site that is not cultivated.&quot;
Organic agricultural operations should ultimately maintain or improve soil and water quality, and conserve wetlands, woodlands, and wildlife.

The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 &quot;requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances which identifies synthetic substances that may be used, and the non- synthetic substances that cannot be used, in organic production and handling operations.&quot;

The Secretary of Agriculture promulgated regulations establishing the National Organic Program (NOP). The final rule was published in the Federal Register in 2000.

USDA Organic certification confirms that the farm or handling facility (whether within the United States or internationally) complies with USDA organic regulations. Farms or handling facilities can be certified by private, foreign, or State entities, whose agents are accredited by the USDA (accredited agents are listed on the USDA website). Any farm or business that grosses more than $5,000 annually in organic sales must be certified. Farms and businesses that make less than $5,000 annually are &quot;exempt&quot;, and must follow all the requirements as stated in the USDA regulations except for two requirements:
* Exempt operations do not need to be certified to &quot;sell, label, or represent&quot; their products as organic, but may not use the USDA organic seal or label their products as &quot;certified organic&quot;. Exempt operations may pursue optional certification if they wish to use the USDA organic seal.
* Exempt operations are not required to have a system plan that documents the specific practices and substances used in the production or handling of their organic products
Exempt operations are also barred from selling their products as ingredients for use in another producer or handler&#x27;s certified organic product, and may be required by buyers to sign an affidavit affirming adherence to USDA organic regulations.

Before an operation may sell, label or represent their products as &quot;organic&quot; (or use the USDA organic seal), it must undergo a 3-year transition period where any land used to produce raw organic commodities must be left untreated with prohibited substances.

Operations seeking certification must first submit an application for organic certification to a USDA-accredited certifying agent including the following:
* A detailed description of the operation seeking certification
* A history of substances used on the land over the prior 3 years
* A list of the organic products grown, raised, or processed
* A written &quot;Organic System Plan (OSP)&quot; which outlines the practices and substances intended for use during future organic production.
* Processors/handlers who are not primarily a farm (and farms with livestock and/or crops that also process products) must complete an Organic Handling Plan (OHP), and also include a product profile and label for each product
Certifying agents then review the application to confirm that the operation&#x27;s practices follow USDA regulations, and schedule an inspection to verify adherence to the OSP, maintenance of records, and overall regulatory compliance

Inspection
During the site visit, the inspector observes onsite practices and compares them to the OSP, looks for any potential contamination by prohibited materials (or any risk of potential contamination), and takes soil, tissue, or product samples as needed. At farming operations, the inspector will also examine the fields, water systems, storage areas, and equipment, assess pest and weed management, check feed production, purchase records, livestock and their living conditions, and records of animal health management practices. For processing and handling facilities, the inspector evaluates the receiving, processing, and storage areas for organic ingredients and finished products, as well as assessing any potential hazards or contamination points (from &quot;sanitation systems, pest management materials, or nonorganic processing aids&quot;). If the facility also processes or handles nonorganic materials, the inspector will also analyze the measures in place to prevent commingling.

If the written application and operational inspection are successful, the certifying agent will issue an organic certificate to the applicant. The producer or handler must then submit an updated application and OSP, pay recertification fees to the agent, and undergo annual onsite inspections to receive recertification annually. Once certified, producers and handlers can have up to 75% of their organic certification costs reimbursed through the USDA Organic Certification Cost-Share Programs.

Federal legislation defines three levels of organic foods. Products made entirely with certified organic ingredients, methods, and processing aids can be labeled &quot;100% organic&quot; (including raw agricultural commodities that have been certified), while only products with at least 95% organic ingredients may be labeled &quot;organic&quot; (any non-organic ingredients used must fall under the exemptions of the National List). Under these two categories, no nonorganic agricultural ingredients are allowed when organic ingredients are available. Both of these categories may also display the &quot;USDA Organic&quot; seal, and must state the name of the certifying agent on the information panel.

A third category, containing a minimum of 70% organic ingredients, can be labeled &quot;made with organic ingredients&quot;, but may not display the USDA Organic seal. Any remaining agricultural ingredients must be produced without excluded methods, including genetic modification, irradiation, or the application of synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, or biosolids. Non-agricultural ingredients used must be allowed on the National List. Organic ingredients must be marked in the ingredients list (e.g., &quot;organic dill&quot; or with an asterisk denoting organic status). In addition, products may also display the logo of the certification body that approved them.

Products made with less than 70% organic ingredients can not be advertised as &quot;organic&quot;, but can list individual ingredients that are organic as such in the product&#x27;s ingredient statement. Also, USDA ingredients from plants cannot be genetically modified.

Livestock feed is only eligible for labeling as &quot;100% Organic&quot; or &quot;Organic&quot;.

Alcoholic products are also subject to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulations. Any use of added sulfites in wine made with organic grapes means that the product is only eligible for the &quot;made with&quot; labeling category and therefore may not use the USDA organic seal. Wine labeled as made with other organic fruit cannot have sulfites added to it.

Organic textiles made be labeled organic and use the USDA organic seal if the finished product is certified organic and produced in full compliance with USDA organic regulations. If all of a specific fiber used in a product is certified organic, the label may state the percentage of organic fibers and identify the organic material.

Organic certification mandates that the certifying inspector must be able to complete both &quot;trace-back&quot; and &quot;mass balance audits&quot; for all ingredients and products. A trace-back audit confirms the existence of a record trail from time of purchase/production through the final sale. A mass balance audit verifies that enough organic product and ingredients have been produced or purchased to match the amount of product sold. Each ingredient and product must have an assigned lot number to ensure the existence of a proper audit trail.

Some of the earliest organizations to carry out organic certification in North America were the California Certified Organic Farmers, founded in 1973, and the voluntary standards and certification program popularized by the Rodale Press in 1972. Some retailers have their stores certified as organic handlers and processors to ensure organic compliance is maintained throughout the supply chain until delivered to consumers, such as Vitamin Cottage Natural Grocers, a 60-year-old chain based in Colorado.

Violations of USDA Organic regulations carry fines up to $11,000 per violation, and can also lead to suspension or revocation of a farm or business&#x27;s organic certificate.

Once certified, USDA organic products can be exported to countries currently engaged in organic trade agreements with the U.S., including Canada, the European Union, Japan, and Taiwan, and do not require additional certification as long as the terms of the agreement are met.

====Canada====
In Canada, certification was implemented at the federal level on June 30, 2009. Mandatory certification is required for agricultural products represented as organic in import, export and inter-provincial trade, or that bear the federal organic logo. In Quebec, provincial legislation provides government oversight of organic certification within the province, through the Quebec Accreditation Board (&quot;Conseil D&#x27;Accréditation Du Québec&quot;). Only products that use at least 95% organic materials in production are allowed to bear the Canadian organic logo. Products between 70-95% may declare they have xx% of organic ingredients, however they do not meet requirements to bear the certified logo. Transitioning from a conventional agricultural operation to an organic operation takes the producers up to three years to receive organic certification, during which time products cannot be marketed as organic products, and producers will not receive pricing premiums on their goods during this time. Cows, sheep, and goats are the only livestock that are allowed to be transitioned to organic, under Canada&#x27;s regulations. They must undergo organic management for one year before their products can be considered certified organic.

=== South America ===

==== Argentina ====
In Argentina, the Organic certification was implemented in December 2012, through a Ministry of Agriculture resolution. Organic products are labeled with the &quot;Orgánico Argentina&quot; seal, which is administered by SENASA and issued by four private companies. Organic production is regulated by the 25.127 Act, passed in 1999.

During 2019, of land were used for organic production certified with the Argentine seal.

===Europe===

==== Public organic certification ====
EU countries acquired comprehensive organic legislation with the implementation of the EU-Eco-regulation 1992. Supervision of certification bodies is handled on the national level. In March 2002 the European Commission issued an EU-wide label for organic food. It has been mandatory throughout the EU since July 2010. and has become compulsory after a two-year transition period.

The farmland converted to produce certified organic food has seen a significant evolution in the EU15 countries, rising from 1.8% in 1998 to 4.1% in 2005. For the current EU25 countries however the statistics report an overall percentage of just 1.5% as of 2005. However, the statistics showed a larger turnover of organic food in some countries, reaching 10% in France and 14% in Germany. In France 21% of available vegetables, fruits, milk and eggs were certified as organic. Numbers for 2010 show that 5.4% of German farmland has been converted to produce certified organic food, as has 10.4% of Swiss farmland and 11.7% of Austrian farmland. Non-EU countries have widely adopted the European certification regulations for organic food, to increase export to EU countries.

In 2009 a new logo was chosen through a design competition and online public vote. The new logo is a green rectangle that shows twelve stars (from the European flag) placed such that they form the shape of a leaf in the wind. Unlike earlier labels no words are presented on the label lifting the requirement for translations referring to organic food certification.

The new EU organic label has been implemented since July 2010 and has replaced the old European Organic label. However, producers that have had already printed and ready to use packaging with the old label were allowed to use them in the upcoming two years.

The development of the EU organic label was develop based on Denmark&#x27;s organic food policy and the rules behind the Danish organic food label which at the moment holds the highest rate of recognition among its users in the world respectively 98% and 90% trust the label. 
The current EU organic label is meant to signal to the consumer that at least 95% of the ingredients used in the processed organic food is from organic origin and 5% considered an acceptable error margin.

==== Private organic certification ====
Besides the public organic certification regulation EU-Eco-regulation in 1992, there are various private organic certifications available:
* Demeter International is the largest certification organization for biodynamic agriculture, and is one of three predominant organic certifiers. Demeter Biodynamic Certification is used in over 50 countries to verify that biodynamic products meet international standards in production and processing. The Demeter certification program was established in 1928, and as such was the first ecological label for organically produced foods. 
* Bio Suisse established in 1981 is the Swiss organic farmer umbrella organization. International activities are mainly focused on imports towards Switzerland and do not support export activities.
* Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is a private standard for organic clothing for the entire post-harvest processing (including spinning, knitting, weaving, dyeing and manufacturing) of apparel and home textiles made with organic fibres (such as organic cotton, organic wool etc.). It includes both environmental and social criteria. Established in 2002, the standard is used in over 68 countries and is endorsed by USDA and IFOAM - Organics International. The material must be at least 95% organic, as certified by &quot;recognized international or national standards&quot;. If the material is 70% organic, it can be labeled as &quot;made with organic&quot;.

====Czech Republic====
Following private bodies certify organic produce: KEZ, o. p. s. (CZ-BIO-001), ABCert, AG (CZ-BIO-002) and BIOCONT CZ, s. r. o. (CZ-BIO-003). These bodies provide controlling of processes tied with issueing of certificate of origin. Controlling of compliancy (to (ES) no 882/2004 directive) is provided by government body ÚKZÚZ (Central Institute for Supervising and Testing in Agriculture).

====France====
In France, organic certification was introduced in 1985. It has established a green-white logo of &quot;AB - agriculture biologique&quot;. The certification for the AB label fulfills the EU regulations for organic food. The certification process is overseen by a public institute (&quot;Agence française pour le développement et la promotion de l&#x27;agriculture biologique&quot; usually shortened to &quot;Agence bio&quot;) established in November 2001. The actual certification authorities include a number of different institutes like Aclave, Agrocert, COSMEBIO, Ecocert SA, Qualité France SA, Ulase, SGS ICS.

====Germany====
In Germany the national label was introduced in September 2001 following in the footsteps of the political campaign of &quot;Agrarwende&quot; (&quot;agricultural major shift&quot;) led by minister Renate Künast of the Greens party. This campaign was started after the outbreak of mad cow disease in 2000. The effects on farming are still challenged by other political parties. The national &quot;Bio&quot;-label in its hexagon green-black-white shape has gained wide popularity—in 2007 there were 2431 companies having certified 41,708 products. The popularity of the label is extending to neighbouring countries like Austria, Switzerland and France.

In the German-speaking countries there have been older non-government organizations that had issued labels for organic food long before the advent of the EU organic food regulations. Their labels are still used widely as they significantly exceed the requirements of the EU regulations. An organic food label like &quot;demeter&quot; from Demeter International has been in use since 1928 and this label is still regarded as providing the highest standards for organic food in the world. Other active NGOs include Bioland (1971), Biokreis (1979), Biopark (1991), Ecoland (1997), Ecovin (1985), Gäa e.V. (1989), Naturland (1981) and Bio Suisse (1981).

====Greece====
In Greece, there are 16 certification and inspection bodies approved by the EU. Most of the certifications are obtained from DIO () and BIOHELLAS.

====Ireland====
In Ireland, organic certification is available from the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Demeter Standards Ltd. and Organic Trust Ltd.

====Switzerland====
In Switzerland, products sold as organic must comply at a minimum with the Swiss organic regulation (Regulation 910.18). Higher standards are required before a product can be labelled with the Bio Suisse label.

====Sweden====
In Sweden, organic certification is handled by the organisation KRAV with members such as farmers, processors, trade and also consumer, environmental and animal welfare interests.

==== Ukraine ====
In Ukraine, organic is regulated in accordance with the Law of Ukraine On Basic Principles and Requirements for Organic Production, Circulation and Labelling of Organic Products. Majority of Ukrainian producers, processing units, traders are also certified under international organic legislation (e.g. EU Organic Regulations, NOP, etc. The Order on the Approval of the State Logo for Organic Products was approved by the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine in 2019. The state logo for organic products is registered as a trademark and owned by the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine. The requirements for proper use of the Ukrainian state logo for organic products and labelling are described on the website of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine as well as in the Methodical Recommendations on the Use of the State Logo for Organic Products.

In the summer 2023, the State Register of Operators the Produce Organic Products in Compliance with the Legislation in Organic Production, Circulation and Labelling of Organic Products and the State Register of Certification Bodies in Organic Production and Circulation of Organic Products that are maintained by the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine were launched in Ukraine.

A certificate confirming production and/or circulation of organic products under the legislation other than Ukrainian, shall be recognised in Ukraine with the view to import or export of such products, provided that it has been issued by the foreign certification body included in the List of foreign certification bodies which is maintained by the State Service of Ukraine on Food Safety and Consumer Protection.

State Institution &quot;Entrepreneurship and Export Promotion Office&quot; (EEPO, Ukraine) plays an important role in Ukrainian organic export facilitation.

Milestones and all the other useful information about the Ukrainian organic sector is available at the specialised Ukrainian organic webportal OrganicInfo.ua.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, organic certification is handled by a number of organizations, regulated by The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), of which the largest are the Soil Association and Organic Farmers and Growers. While UK certification bodies are required to meet the EU minimum organic standards for all member states; they may choose to certify to standards that exceed the minimums, as is the case with the Soil Association.

===Asia and Oceania===

==== Australia ====
In Australia, organic certification is performed by several organisations that are accredited by the Biosecurity section of the Department of Agriculture (Australia), formerly the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, under the National Standard for Organic and Biodynamic Produce. All claims about the organic status of products sold in Australia are covered under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010.

In Australia, the Organic Federation of Australia is the peak body for the organic industry in Australia and is part of the government&#x27;s Organic Consultative Committee Legislative Working Group that sets organic standards.

Department of Agriculture accreditation is a legal requirement for all organic products exported from Australia. Export Control (Organic Produce Certification) Orders are used by the Department to assess organic certifying bodies and recognise them as approved certifying organisations. Approved certifying organisations are assessed by the Department for both initial recognition and on an at least annual basis thereafter to verify compliance.

In the absence of domestic regulation, DOA accreditation also serves as a &#x27;de facto&#x27; benchmark for certified product sold on the domestic market. Despite its size and growing share of the economy &quot;the organic industry in Australia remains largely self-governed. There is no specific legislation for domestic organic food standardisation and labelling at the state or federal level as there is in the USA and the EU&quot;.

=====Australian approved certifying organisations=====
The Department has several approved certifying organisations that manage the certification process of organic and bio-dynamic operators in Australia. These certifying organisations perform a number of functions on the Department&#x27;s behalf:
* Assess organic and bio-dynamic operators to determine compliance to the National Standard for Organic and Bio-Dynamic Produce and importing country requirements.
* Issue a Quality Management Certificate (QM Certificate) to organic operators to recognise compliance to export requirements.
* Issue Organic Produce Certificates (Export Documentation) for consignments of organic and bio-dynamic produce being exported.
As of 2015, there are seven approved certifying organisations:
* AUS-QUAL Pty Ltd (AUSQUAL)
*Australian Certified Organic (ACO)
* Bio-Dynamic Research Institute (BDRI)
* NASAA Certified Organic (NCO)
* Organic Food Chain (OFC)
* Safe Food Production Queensland (SFQ)
* Tasmanian Organic-dynamic Producers (TOP)

There are 2567 certified organic businesses reported in Australia in 2014. They include 1707 primary producers, 719 processors and manufacturers, 141 wholesalers and retailers plus other operators.

Australia does not have a national logo or seal to identify which products are certified organic, instead the logos of the individual certifying organisations are used.

====China====
In China, the organic certification is administered by a government agency named Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (CNCA). While the implementation of certification works, including site checking, lab test on soil, water, product qualities are performed by the China Quality Certification Center (CQC) which is an agency of Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ).The organic certification procedures in china are performed according to China Organic Standard GB/T 19630.1-4—2011 which was issued in year 2011. This standard has governed standard procedure for Organic certification process performed by CQC, including application, inspection, lab test procedures, certification decision and post certification administration. The certificate issued by CQC are valid for one year.

There are two logos that are currently used by the CQC for labeling products with Organic Certification, these are the Organic Logo and CQC Logo. No conversion to organic Logo now.

There were more than 19000 valid certificates and 66 organic certification bodies until 2018 in China.

====India====

In India, APEDA regulates the certification of organic products as per National Standards for Organic Production. &quot;The NPOP standards for production and accreditation system have been recognized by European Commission and Switzerland as equivalent to their country standards.&quot; Organic food products manufactured and exported from India are marked with the India Organic certification mark issued by the APEDA. APEDA has recognized 11 inspection certification bodies, some of which are branches of foreign certification bodies, others are local certification bodies.

====Japan====
In Japan, the Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS) was fully implemented as law in April 2001. This was revised in November 2005 and all JAS certifiers were required to be re-accredited by the Ministry of Agriculture.

====Singapore====
As of 2014 the Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority of Singapore had no organic certification process, but instead relied on international certification bodies; it does not track local producers who claim to have gotten organic certification.

====Cambodia====
In Cambodia, Cambodian Organic Agriculture Association (COrAA) is the only organization that is authorized to give certificate for organic agricultural products. It is a nationwide private organization working for the promotion of organic and sustainable agriculture in Cambodia. COrAA has developed both organic and chemical-free agricultural standards and provides third-party-certification to producers following these standards. In addition, the services that COrAA provides include technical training for the conversion from chemical/conventional to organic farming, marketing support, organic awareness building among the general public, and a platform for dialogue and cooperation among organic stakeholders in Cambodia.

===Africa===

====Kenya====
In Kenya, the Kenya Organic Agriculture Network (KOAN) is mandated to coordinate the Organic Sector. It is the national Coordinator and Issuer of the certificate under Participatory Guarantee System (PGS). KOAN is also the custodian of the Kilimohai Organic Mark of Organic Certification under the East Africa Organic Products Standards.

==Issues==
Organic certification is not without its critics. Some of the staunchest opponents of chemical-based farming and factory farming practices also oppose formal certification. They see it as a way to drive independent organic farmers out of business, and to undermine the quality of organic food. Other organizations such as the Organic Trade Association work within the organic community to foster awareness of legislative and other related issues, and enable the influence and participation of organic proponents.

===Obstacles to small independent producers===
Originally, in the 1960s through the 1980s, the organic food industry was composed of mainly small, independent farmers, selling locally. Organic &quot;certification&quot; was a matter of trust, based on a direct relationship between farmer and consumer. Critics view regulatory certification as a potential barrier to entry for small producers, by burdening them with increased costs, paperwork, and bureaucracy

In China, due to government regulations, international companies wishing to market organic produce must be independently certified. It is reported that &quot;Australian food producers are spending up to $50,000 to be certified organic by Chinese authorities to crack the burgeoning middle-class market of the Asian superpower.&quot; Whilst the certification process is described by producers as &quot;extremely difficult and very expensive&quot;, a number of organic producers have acknowledged the ultimately positive effect of gaining access to the emerging Chinese market. For example, figures from Australian organic infant formula and baby food producer Bellamy&#x27;s Organic indicate export growth, to China alone, of 70 per cent per year since gaining Chinese certification in 2008, while similar producers have shown export growth of 20 per cent to 30 per cent a year following certification

Peak Australian organic certification body, Australian Certified Organic, has stated however that &quot;many companies have baulked at risking the money because of the complex, unwieldy and expensive process to earn Chinese certification.&quot; By comparison, equivalent certification costs in Australia are less than $2,000 (AUD), with costs in the United States as low as $750 (USD) for a similarly sized business.

===Manipulative use of regulations===
Manipulation of certification regulations as a way to mislead or outright dupe the public is a very real concern. Some examples are creating exceptions (allowing non-organic inputs to be used without loss of certification status) and creative interpretation of standards to meet the letter, but not the intention, of particular rules. For example, a complaint filed with the USDA in February 2004 against Bayliss Ranch, a food ingredient producer and its certifying agent, charged that tap water had been certified organic, and advertised for use in a variety of water-based body care and food products, in order to label them &quot;organic&quot; under US law. Steam-distilled plant extracts, consisting mainly of tap water introduced during the distilling process, were certified organic, and promoted as an organic base that could then be used in a claim of organic content. The case was dismissed by the USDA, as the products had been actually used only in personal care products, over which the department at the time extended no labeling control. The company subsequently adjusted its marketing by removing reference to use of the extracts in food products.

In 2013, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission said that water can no longer be labelled as organic water because, based on organic standards, water cannot be organic and it is misleading and deceptive to label any water as such.

===False assurance of quality===

The label itself can be used to mislead many customers that food labelled as being organic is safer, healthier and more nutritious. Thus, a product may be labelled organic, but have no significant nutritional value compared to other products.

===Erosion of standards===
Critics of formal certification also fear an erosion of organic standards. Provided with a legal framework within which to operate, lobbyists can push for amendments and exceptions favorable to large-scale production, resulting in &quot;legally organic&quot; products produced in ways similar to current conventional food. Combined with the fact that organic products are now sold predominantly through high volume distribution channels such as supermarkets, the concern is that the market is evolving to favor the biggest producers, and this could result in the small organic farmer being squeezed out.

In the United States large food companies, have &quot;assumed a powerful role in setting the standards for organic foods&quot;. Many members of standard-setting boards come from large food corporations. As more corporate members have joined, many nonorganic substances have been added to the National List of acceptable ingredients. The United States Congress has also played a role in allowing exceptions to organic food standards. In December 2005, the 2006 agricultural appropriations bill was passed with a rider allowing 38 synthetic ingredients to be used in organic foods, including food colorings, starches, sausage and hot-dog casings, hops, fish oil, chipotle chili pepper, and gelatin; this allowed Anheuser-Busch in 2007 to have its Wild Hop Lager certified organic &quot;even though [it] uses hops grown with chemical fertilizers and sprayed with pesticides.&quot;

<doc id="412766" wikidata="Q176416" url="?curid=412766" title="Battle of Sphacteria">
<text>The Battle of Sphacteria was a land battle of the Peloponnesian War, fought in 425 BC between Athens and Sparta. Following the Battle of Pylos and subsequent peace negotiations, which failed, a number of Spartans were stranded on the island of Sphacteria. An Athenian force under Cleon and Demosthenes attacked and forced them to surrender.

==Overview==
In the wake of the failed peace negotiations, Demosthenes initially attempted to starve out the Spartans on Sphacteria, but was unable to blockade the island tightly enough. In Athens there was concern that the approach of winter would necessitate abandoning the blockade, unless the impasse was swiftly broken. The politician Cleon took out reinforcements from Athens and joined forces with Demosthenes, and the Athenians launched an assault on Sphacteria. Landing in great force on a weakly defended point, the Athenians swamped the beachfront defenses and moved inland, harassing the Spartans by using bows and spears whenever they attempted to come to grips with the Athenian hoplites. The Spartans retreated to the northern end of the island and dug in behind their fortifications, but when the Messenian general Comon succeeded in bringing his troops through seemingly impassable terrain into their rear, the Spartans surrendered.

The capture of over 292 hoplites (120 of which were Spartans) by Athens radically shifted the balance of power in the war. Athens threatened to execute its prisoners if Sparta invaded Attica, and the annual invasions which had occurred since the war&#x27;s declaration were thus halted. Athens, meanwhile, with increased prestige and confidence, went on to pursue the war with more vigor and initiative for several years, returning to the negotiating table only after a string of defeats had eroded its position.

==Prelude and early moves==
After the Battle of Pylos, which resulted in the isolation of over 400 Spartan soldiers on the island of Sphacteria, Sparta sued for peace, and, after arranging an armistice at Pylos by surrendering the ships of the Peloponnesian fleet as security, sent an embassy to Athens to negotiate a settlement. These negotiations, however, proved fruitless, and with the news of their failure the armistice came to an end; the Athenians, however, refused to return the Peloponnesian ships, alleging that assaults had been made against their fortifications during the truce. Hostilities resumed immediately, with the Athenians guarding the island night and day against attempts at rescue or resupply.

Demosthenes, commanding the force at Pylos, initially planned to starve the Spartans out rather than attack them, but as time wore on it became clear that the Spartans would be able to hold out for longer than anticipated. By offering freedom to Helots and monetary rewards to free men who would volunteer to carry food across to the island, the Spartans were able to bring in a small but critical stream of food. Some of these men reached the island by approaching from the seaward side at night during rough weather; others swam underwater towing bags of food. The Athenians, meanwhile, found themselves frequently short on rations, and the entire force was forced to depend on a single spring for its fresh water. In these adverse circumstances, the Athenians began to doubt that they could resolve the issue by siege before winter forced them to lift their blockade.

==Debate at Athens==
This downturn of fortunes was the source of much concern at Athens, the decision to reject Sparta&#x27;s peace offer became an item of much popular regret. Noting this turn of popular opinion, Cleon, who had been the principal advocate of rejecting the peace offer, claimed that the reports brought back from the scene must be inaccurate. When Nicias, a political opponent of his and a strategos for that year, proposed to send a commission, with Cleon among its members, to verify the reports from Pylos, Cleon attacked him for proposing to waste time that should have been spent attacking. Nicias countered this rhetorical thrust by offering to stand aside as a general, and allow Cleon to take command of an expeditionary force to Pylos. Although he had no authority to make this offer, the assembly, caught up in the enthusiasm of the moment, went along with him, urging Cleon to back up his words with action.

Cleon was probably aware that an attack was already being planned at Pylos, as he was likely to have been in communication with Demosthenes, but once he realized that Nicias&#x27;s offer was more than a rhetorical ploy he attempted to back down from his challenge. The crowd, however, refused to permit this, and Cleon was eventually compelled to accept command. Reassuming the bold attitude he had taken at the start of the debate, Cleon proclaimed that, with the force he had been given, he would either kill or capture the Spartans within twenty days. Naming Demosthenes as his partner in command, he set out from Athens with a force composed of Athenian sailors and ships carrying allied peltasts and archers.

==Attack on Sphacteria==
Demosthenes had already been planning an attack on Sphacteria, as the difficulty of the circumstances his men were in had led him to doubt the viability of a prolonged siege. Moreover, a fire on the island, ignited by Spartan sailors lighting a fire to cook a meal away from the crowded confines of Pylos, had denuded the island of vegetation and allowed Demosthenes to examine both the contours of the island and the number and disposition of the defenders. Seeing that only thirty Spartans were detailed to guard the southern end of the island, away from Pylos, Demosthenes landed his 800 hoplites on both the seaward and landward sides of the island one night. The Spartan garrison, thinking that the Athenian ships were only mooring in their usual nightly watch posts, was caught off guard and massacred. At dawn, the remainder of the Athenian force streamed ashore; these included some 2,000 light troops (psiloi) and archers (toxotai) and some 8,000 rowers from the fleet, armed with whatever weapons could be found.

The Spartans, under their commander Epitadas, attempted to come to grips with the Athenian hoplites and push their enemies back into the sea, but Demosthenes detailed his lightly armed troops, in companies of about 200 men, to occupy high points and harass the enemy with missile fire whenever they approached. When the Spartans rushed at their tormentors, the light troops, unencumbered by heavy hoplite armor, were easily able to run to safety; dust and ash from the recent fire, stirred up by the commotion, further contributed to the Spartans&#x27; predicament by obscuring their attackers from their sight. Unable to make any headway, the Spartans withdrew in some confusion to the northern end of the island, where they dug in behind their fortifications and hoped to hold out. A stalemate took hold for some time, with the Athenians trying unsuccessfully to dislodge the Spartans from their strong positions. At this point, the commander of the Messenian detachment in the Athenian force, Comon, approached Demosthenes and asked that he be given troops with which to move through the seemingly impassable terrain along the island&#x27;s shore. His request was granted, and Comon led his men into the Spartan rear through a route that had been left unguarded on account of its roughness. When he emerged with his force, the Spartans, in disbelief, abandoned their defenses; the Athenians seized the approaches to the fort, and the Spartan force stood on the brink of annihilation.

==Surrender and aftermath==
At this point, Cleon and Demosthenes declined to push the attack further, preferring to take as many Spartans as they could prisoner. An Athenian herald offered the Spartans a chance to surrender, and the Spartans, throwing down their shields, agreed at last to negotiate. Cleon and Demosthenes met with the Spartan commander Styphon (Styphon had initially been the third in command, but Epitadas had been killed and his first successor was severely wounded and had been left for dead). Styphon requested to send a herald to the mainland to seek advice; the Athenians refused to allow any of the trapped men to leave, but permitted as many heralds from the mainland as were desired to pass back and forth. Several messengers did so, the last of whom left Styphon with the message &quot;The Spartans order you to make your decision yourselves, so long as you do nothing dishonorable.&quot; Styphon and his men, with no hope of victory or escape, surrendered. Of the 440 Laconians who had crossed over to Sphacteria, 292 survived to surrender; of these, 120 were men of the elite Spartiate class.

&quot;The outcome,&quot; Donald Kagan has observed, &quot;shook the Greek world.&quot; Spartans, it had been supposed, would never surrender. Now, with Spartiate hostages in their hands, the Athenians issued an ultimatum; any invasion of Attica would lead to the execution of their prisoners. For the first time since the beginning of the war, the Athenians could farm their crops securely. At Pylos, a Messenian garrison was installed, and these men, launching raids into country that had once been their home, did significant damage to the Spartans and instigated the desertion of numerous Helots. At Athens, Cleon, his seemingly mad promise fulfilled, was the man of the hour; he was granted meals at the state&#x27;s expense in the prytaneum (the same reward granted to Olympic champions), and most scholars see his hand in the legislation of the following months, the most prominent item of which was an increased levy of tribute on the empire. Sphacteria had changed the nature of the war. The next few years would see a newly aggressive Athens, and it would take a string of Athenian reverses to diffuse the impetus that the surrenders had given and bring the two sides to the table to negotiate the Peace of Nicias in 421 BC.

Thucydides says it was only with victory at the battle of Mantinea in 418 BC that Sparta “did away with all the reproaches that had been levelled against them by the Hellenes, whether for cowardice, because of the disaster on the island, or for incompetence and lack of resolution on other occasions.”

<doc id="412768" wikidata="Q1243807" url="?curid=412768" title="Tinea cruris">
<text>Tinea cruris (TC), also known as jock itch, is a common type of contagious, superficial fungal infection of the groin and buttocks region, which occurs predominantly but not exclusively in men and in hot-humid climates.

Typically, over the upper inner thighs, there is an intensely itchy red raised rash with a scaly well-defined curved border. It is often associated with athlete&#x27;s foot and fungal nail infections, excessive sweating, and sharing of infected towels or sports clothing. It is uncommon in children.

Its appearance may be similar to some other rashes that occur in skin folds including candidal intertrigo, erythrasma, inverse psoriasis and seborrhoeic dermatitis. Tests may include microscopy and culture of skin scrapings.

Treatment is with topical antifungal medications and is particularly effective if symptoms have recent onset. Prevention of recurrences include treating concurrent fungal infections and taking measures to avoid moisture build-up including keeping the groin region dry, avoiding tight clothing and losing weight if obese.

==Names==
Other names include &quot;jock rot&quot;, &quot;dhobi itch&quot;, &quot;crotch itch&quot;, &quot;scrot rot&quot;, &quot;gym itch&quot;, &quot;ringworm of groin&quot; and &quot;eczema marginatum&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==
Typically, over the upper inner thighs, there is a red raised rash with a scaly well-defined border. There may be some blistering and weeping, and the rash can reach near to the anus. The distribution is usually on both sides of the groin and the center may be lighter in colour. The rash may appear reddish, tan, or brown, with flaking, rippling, peeling, iridescence, or cracking skin.

If the person is hairy, hair follicles can become inflamed resulting in some bumps (papules, nodules and pustules) within the plaque. The plaque may reach the scrotum in men and the labia majora and mons pubis in women. The penis is usually unaffected unless there is immunodeficiency or there has been use of steroids.

Affected people usually experience intense itching in the groin which can extend to the anus.

==Causes==
Tinea cruris is often associated with athlete&#x27;s foot and fungal nail infections. Rubbing from clothing, excessive sweating, diabetes and obesity are risk factors. It is contagious and can be transmitted person-to-person by skin-to-skin contact or by contact with contaminated sports clothing and sharing towels.

The type of fungus involved may vary in different parts of the world; for example, &quot;Trichophyton rubrum&quot; and &quot;Epidermophyton floccosum&quot; are common in New Zealand. Less commonly &quot;Trichophyton mentagrophytes&quot; and &quot;Trichophyton verrucosum&quot; are involved. &quot;Trichophyton interdigitale&quot; has also been implicated.

==Diagnosis==
Tests are usually not needed to make a diagnosis, but if required, may include microscopy and culture of skin scrapings, a KOH examination to check for fungus, or skin biopsy.

===Differential diagnosis===
The symptoms of tinea cruris may be similar to other causes of itch in the groin. Its appearance may be similar to some other rashes that occur in skin folds including candidal intertrigo, erythrasma, inverse psoriasis and seborrhoeic dermatitis.

==Prevention==

To prevent recurrences of tinea cruris, concurrent fungal infections such as athlete&#x27;s foot need to be treated. Also advised are measures to avoid moisture build-up including keeping the groin region dry, avoiding tight clothing, and losing weight if obese. People with athletes foot or tinea cruris can prevent spread by not lending their towels to others.

==Treatment==
Tinea cruris is treated by applying antifungal medications of the allylamine or azole type to the groin region. Studies suggest that allylamines (naftifine and terbinafine) are a quicker but more expensive form of treatment compared to azoles (clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, miconazole, sulconazole). If the symptoms have been present for long or the condition worsens despite applying creams, terbinafine or itraconazole can be given by mouth.

The benefits of the use of topical steroids in addition to an antifungal are unclear. There might be a greater cure rate but no guidelines currently recommend its addition. The effect of Whitfield&#x27;s ointment is also unclear, but when given, it is prescribed at half strength.

Wearing cotton underwear and socks, in addition to keeping the groin dry and using antifungal powders, is helpful.

==Prognosis ==
Tinea cruris is not life-threatening and treatment is effective, particularly if the symptoms have not been present for long. However, recurrence may occur. The intense itch may lead to lichenification and secondary bacterial infection. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may be caused by applied medications.

==Epidemiology==
Tinea cruris is common in hot-humid climates, and is the second most common clinical presentation for dermatophytosis. It is uncommon in children.

<doc id="412771" wikidata="Q6942342" url="?curid=412771" title="Music of immigrant communities in the United States">
<text>The vast majority of the inhabitants of the United States are immigrants or descendants of immigrants. This article will focus on the music of these communities and discuss its roots in countries across Africa, Europe and Asia, excluding only Native American music, indigenous and immigrant Latinos, Puerto Rican music, Hawaiian music and African American music. The music of Irish- and Scottish-Americans will be a special focus, due to their extreme influence on Appalachian folk music and other genres.
These sorts of music are often sustained and promoted by a variety of ethnic organizations.

==Armenia==
&quot;See: Music of Armenia&quot;

Following the Armenian genocide of 1915 perpetrated by the Young Turk government in Turkey, large numbers of Armenians settled in the Central Valley area of California, especially around Fresno. Of the second- and third-generation musicians from this community, Richard Hagopian became a minor star in the Armenian-American community. Alan Hovhaness used traditional Armenian music in his compositions. Daja Yavasharian is a solo violinist who performs classical music.

The ethnically Armenian heavy metal band System of a Down features Armenian melodic elements in many of their songs and has written songs dedicated to the Armenian genocide. The group is very active in promoting genocide awareness and recognition.

== Cape Verde ==
&quot;See: Music of Cape Verde&quot;

There are more Cape Verdeans outside of their homeland than there are in the island chain itself. In the United States, California and Hawaii are home to large Cape Verdean populations, but the largest concentration is in New England, especially Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts. Many of these immigrants came via whaling ships in the 19th century. Cape Verdean music is most famously morna, but other genres exist and the Cape Verdean community has produced string bands like The B-29s, Notias, Augusto Abrio and the Cape Verdean Serenaders. There were also Cape Verdean big bands, including the Creole Vagabonds and the Don Verdi Orchestra. More modern musicians include Frank de Pina, Mendes Brothers (and their influential record label, MB Records), Saozinha, Creole Sextet and Rui Pina.

==China==
&quot;See: Music of China&quot;

Chinese-American bands include Say Bok Gwai . The pop-rapper Jin has lately gained some national renown as well. The electronic group Shanghai Restoration Project has been rising through the charts in online downloadable music stores.

==Czech lands==
&quot;See: Music of the Czech Republic&quot;

Though associated with Slovenia, Germany and Poland as well, the Czech Republic includes Bohemia, the ancestral home of polka music. Polka has a long history in the United States, and the city of Chicago, among others, had produced numerous innovations in the genre.

==Eastern European Jews==
&quot;See: Jewish music, Eastern European music, Secular Jewish culture&quot;

Early in the 20th century, Eastern European immigrants settled across the United States. Many were Ashkenazi Jews, who brought with them their swift, eminently dance-able klezmer music. Harry Kandel, a clarinetist, stood out in the field, alongside Abe Schwartz, Naftule Brandwein and Dave Tarras.

Later, in the 1980s, a new generation of klezmer roots revivalists made innovative fusions of klezmer with punk rock and other influences. These bands include the Flying Klezmer Bulgar Band and The Klezmatics.

==England==

As the homeland of many of the settlers of the original Thirteen Colonies, and a major source of immigration thereafter, England&#x27;s musical traditions are closely tied to those of the United States, especially Appalachian folk music. In the 1850s, there was a thriving brass band tradition in the United States, drawing on British bands formed around factory workers.

== France ==
&quot;See: Music of France&quot;

The most well-known kind of French music in the United States is that of the Cajuns of Louisiana. Cajun and Creole music has spawned many popular artists in the zydeco genre, including Clifton Chenier.

== Germany ==
&quot;See: Music of Germany&quot;

German immigrants brought with them a variety of music, waltzes, polkas and oom-pah bands among them. A German musical society of the mid-19th century formed the Seventh Regiment Band, the only exclusively regimental band of the Civil War-era and one of the most popular brass bands of the time. German bandleader Friendrich Wilhelm Wieprecht was also influential, collecting full scores for his compilation of instrumentations of popular works, &quot;für die jetzige Stimmenbesetzung&quot;. Instruments included the bassoon, contrabassoon, bass tuba, trumpet, trombone, clarinet, piccolo, oboe, French horn, saxhorn, drums and cymbal. Wieprecht was recognized at the time as a key figure in the reorganization of the Prussian military bands.

The music of the Amish, a religious community descended from German and Swiss settlers who eschew modern technology in favor of simplicity, is entirely religious, and is sung in a style that has not been widely performed in Europe for centuries.

The songs of the Pennsylvania German culture, a mixture of British, South German and other elements, are primarily German, with many based on British tunes. Pennsylvania spirituals are a well-known kind of folk hymn, most of which date to the early 19th century.

== Greece ==
&quot;See: Music of Greece&quot; and 
&quot;Greek folk music&quot;

Greek-American immigrant music includes styles of Greek music such as Ancient, traditional, with emphasis in Greek literature and poetry.

Some of the well-known Greek supporters and remarkable personalities of Greek immigrant music art in America are: Stamatis Spanoudakis, Nana Mouskouri, Maria Farantouri, Marinella, Yanni, Mikis Theodorakis, Vicky Leandros etc. and remarkable composers and pianists such as Manos Loïzos and Stefanos Korkolis. Until the 1930s the Greek discography was separated by two musical genres: the Greek folk music and the &quot;Elafró tragoudi&quot; (literally: &quot;light song&quot;). The latter was made by ensembles of singers/musicians or solo artists like Attik and Nikos Gounaris. It was the Greek version of the international popular music of that era. In the 1930s the first rebetiko recordings had a massive impact on Greek music in America. The tradition of eastern liturgical chant, encompassing the Greek-speaking world, developed in the Byzantine Empire from the establishment of its capital, Constantinople.

A big sign of the Greek immigrant music culture has left the Greek soprano Maria Kallas. 
Immigrant Greek music also includes music from Greek islands the Nisiotika and the famous dance Sirtaki with well-known artists like Yiannis Parios etc.

Greek music history extends far back into ancient Greece, since music was a major part of ancient Greek theater. Music genres and styles like Laïko, Hasapiko and rebetiko are also well-known. Performers include Johnny Otis and Tatiana Troyanos. &quot;Classic laïkó&quot; as it is known today, was the mainstream popular music of Greece during the
1960s and 1970s. Laïkó was dominated by singers such as Tolis Voskopoulos and Stelios Kazantzidis.

Among the most significant songwriters and lyricists of this period are George Zambetas and the big names of the Rebetiko era that where still in business, like Vassilis Tsitsanis and Manolis Chiotis. Many artists combined the traditions of éntekhno and laïkó with considerable success, such as the composers Stavros Xarchakos and Mimis Plessas.

The Pontic genre of immigrant music which is well-known from the remarkable minority of Pontians in America, retains elements of the musical traditions of ancient Greece, Byzantine music and the tradition of Caucasus. The prime instruments in Pontic music are the Pontic lyra (Kemenche), which has origins in Byzantine period and it is related closely with the Byzantine lyra and Cretan lyra. Other instruments include drums, lute, askomandoura (a type of bagpipe) and aulos.

It is also known The well-known Cretan music of the dominant folk instrument Cretan lyra on the island as the results of immigrant music; a three-stringed bowed instrument similar to the Byzantine Lyra. It is often accompanied by the askomandoura (a type of bagpipe) and the Cretan laouto (λαούτο). The earliest documented music on Crete comes from Ancient Greece. Cretan music like most traditional Greek, began as product of ancient and Byzantine inspirations.

==India==
The Indian diaspora (and significant portion of other South Asian diaspora) enjoy Indian music, which includes Indian classical music and non-classical Indian music. The non-classical music has at least two categories: film music (original sound tracks) and non-film music (often called Indi-pop). The Bollywood music represents Hindi language film songs. Indian diaspora speaking non-Hindi languages enjoy music of their own languages, such as Tamil music, Bengali music, Punjabi music and so on. Fusion between popular Indian music (such as Bollywood or Bhangra music) and American music has taken place, and is popular in certain areas with high Indian American population density.

== Iran ==
&quot;See: Music of Iran or Persian Music &quot;

After the 1979 revolution, the new Iranian government banned all pop music and many other genres. Numerous Iranians, including musicians, entered into exile, many settling in the Los Angeles-area. The Iranian-American scene produced several stars in the Iranian-in-exile community, including Dariush, Ebi, Homeira, Hayedeh, Mahasti, Moein and more.

There are also many newcomers in Persian/Iranian Music who have made huge impression. Below are a list of them:

Andy Madadian, Mansour, Leila Forouhar, Shahrzad Sepanlou, Arash, Shadmehr Aghili, Jamshid, Cameron Cartio, Muhammad, Kamran &amp; Hooman, Fereydoun, Hi-5, Shaghayegh, Shahriar and much more

==Ireland==
Joseph Halliday, a Dubliner, is notable for having introduced the keyed bugle in 1810. While not a technical innovation (the keyed trumpet was already known), it did become extremely popular in the burgeoning brass band tradition and inspired a whole family of instruments, the ophicleides. In the middle of the 19th century, Irish bandleader Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore was very influential, having introduced a wide range of reed instruments as well as developing instrumentation that allowed a large wind ensemble to approximate the effects of a full orchestra.

The 1960s saw the Clancy Brothers (with Tommy Makem) become minor celebrities in the United States, especially in the Irish-American community. They appeared at Carnegie Hall and on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Mick Moloney’s Irish-American Music and Dance Festival has existed for over twenty years and remains an important part of the Irish-American scene.

In the eighties several high-profile Irish artists emigrated to the US, including Mary Black, Dolores Keane and Maura O&#x27;Connell. At the same time groups sprang up in America to play Irish music at a professional level. Mick Moloney founded Green Fields of America in 1977 to bring together immigrant Irish and native-born players of Irish music. Although they did not record an album until 1989, they created a ripple. The band contained several people who went on achieve international fame – Seamus Egan, Eileen Ivers and Jerry O&#x27;Sullivan. Another early Irish-American band was Cherish the Ladies formed in 1985.

The rules of the All-Ireland championships allow non Irish residents to complete and thanks to Irish cultural centres in New York and Chicago, young US citizens began to win in dancing and fiddling. Chicago-born Liz Carroll came second in 1974 with her fiddling. In 1992 she was a member of Trian, who recorded two highly regarded albums of strictly traditional no-frills Irish instrumentals. Some films gave exposure to Irish music – &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975 – The Chieftains), &quot;The Brothers McMullen&quot; (1984 – Seamus Egan), &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; (1998 – Arty McGlynn) and &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997). The touring stage show &quot;Riverdance&quot; (1995) was probably the biggest single publicity blaze in the cause of Irish-American music. The New York &quot;Kips Bay Ceilidh Band&quot; recorded an admired album of dance tunes (1993).

Celtic new age music from Clannad (Ireland), harpist Loreena McKennitt (Canada) and Nightnoise (Ireland) were popular in a low-key way in the US. Tríona and Mícheál O Dhomhnaill from Nightnoise had emigrated to the US in the 70s and started recording in 1984. There were pop hits for Enya (originally from Clannad). Among the immigrants from Ireland was Susan McKeown. She had been recording since 1990 but won international praise for &quot;Lowlands&quot; (2000). In 1996 the Irish-American supergroup Solas was formed. The group contained multi-instrumentalist Seamus Egan and a powerful new singer Karan Casey. The Chieftains had been visiting America since the 70s but by 2003 the audience was big enough to justify a DVD, live from Nashville.

==Italy==
&quot;See: Music of Italy&quot;

Italian-Americans are concentrated on the Eastern Seaboard, especially in New York City. Their music includes square dances, tarantellas, mazurkas, waltzes and polkas, and music for mandolin, banjo, guitar and accordion.

Italian folk traditions have had a lasting influence of barbershop singing and doo wop. Neapolitan bandleader Francis Scala was bandleader of the U.S. Marine Band after immigrating in 1840; as is common in Naples, he placed the clarinet (which he played himself) in a prominent place in his performances.

==Jamaica==
&quot;See: Music of Jamaica&quot;

Undoubtedly the most influential Jamaican-American entertainer is DJ Kool Herc, who is often credited as the inventor of hip hop. He immigrated to New York City and brought with him the roots of hip hop—a DJ isolating and repeating a percussion break while an MC spoke over the beats.

Second generation Jamaican Busta Rhymes was later an important gangsta rapper during the 1990s; his style is similar to that found in Jamaican dub, dancehall and reggaeton.

For more information about Caribbean cultural influence in the United States, see Holger Henke&#x27;s, The West Indian Americans, Westport: Greenwood Press 2001.

==Japan==

Large-scale Japanese immigration to the United States began early in the 20th century, and traditional music came with them. California and Hawaii were two of the biggest destinations for these immigrants. The first North American taiko group was Seiichi Tanaka&#x27;s San Francisco Taiko Dojo in San Francisco, which was founded in 1968.

==Norway==

Norwegian-American folk music in the United States is mostly found in Minnesota and surrounding states. Reinlenders, polkas and waltzes are played; of these, waltzes are by far the most common . Instruments include the psalmodikon, fiddle and accordion. Celebrations like Syttende Mai have become an important outlet for traditional Norwegian music.

==Pakistan==

Pakistani music in the United States is largely influenced by homegrown Pakistani American musicians and bands. &quot;The Kominas&quot; are an American-Pakistani taqwacore band from Boston. 
There have been a number of successful American musicians of Pakistani origin; they include Nadia Ali, rappers Bohemia and Mr. Capone-E, Junoon member Salman Ahmad, the Qaiyum brothers (MCs GQ and JAQ), as well as &quot;Explosions in the Sky&quot; guitarist Munaf Rayani. Much of the works contributed by Pakistani musicians in the U.S. are often inspired by a fusion of contemporary and traditional American and Pakistani musical genres.

&quot;See: Music of Poland&quot;

While Polish folk music still exists in its &quot;old country&quot; form, the most prevalent form of music evolved from traditional polkas, , waltzes and Krakowiaks into what is common among the community today. This music form was pioneered by such musicians as Bernie Witkowski, Frank Wojnarowski, AmPol Aires, and Eddie Ziema. Royal Polish music, such as the polonaise (polonez), and folk music, mazur, oberek, krakowiak, kujawiak, and regional music, are celebrated by various Polish folk groups around the country.

The Polish community is strongest in the area around Chicago, Illinois. Chicago&#x27;s Orkiestra Makowska, led by George Dzialowy, defined that city&#x27;s unique sound for many years.

The city&#x27;s Polish-American community spawned a wave of musicians that are usually considered polka players, though their actual output is quite varied. Chicago-style polka music has a distinctive sound from that found in other parts of the country. New England, Buffalo, NY, Detroit, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis also have Polish-American musical traditions and each has its own distinctive sound.

More than 50,000 Polish-Americans live in the area around Houston, Texas. There is a rich tradition of Polish fiddling from Texas that had declined into obscurity until a recent revitalization by performers like Brian Marshall. Polish settlers arrived beginning in the middle of the 19th century, settling in Panna Maria, a village just south of San Antonio. A few decades later, a new wave of Polish migrants settled in Chappell Hill, Stoneham, Brenham, Bremond, Anderson, Carlos and New Waverly. These people&#x27;s folk music consisted of bowed bass, fiddle and sometimes a clarinet, with the later additions of drums, accordions and guitars. Within Texas, Polish music was diverse, with a rhythmic style predominant in the Chappell Hill/Brenham area, and a melodic sound in Bremond. The group, Brave Combo is an example of what is commonly called within the industry Tex-Mex polka music. The Czech and Polish settlers in Texas had a major influence on the traditional Mexican folk music forming what we now know as Tejano music.

== Portugal ==
&quot;See: Music of Portugal&quot;
In the United States there are Portuguese American singers and bands known such as Jorge Ferreira, Arlindo Andrade, Marc Dennis, Jack Sebastião (R.I.P.), Nélia, Sergio Royal, Mauricio Morais, Alcides Machado, Chico Avila, Luis Fontes Sousa José Norberto, Ana Lisa, Nelson, Michelle Romeiro, José Lobo, Jorge Pereira and Eratoxica. also perform world music, rock, dance or pimba music. Fado is also popular in the U.S., and there, Ramana Vieira is one of the representers of this music genre. Portuguese American musicians are usually based in New England, New Jersey and California. Nowadays, about 5,000 000 Portuguese Americans live in the United States. The majority of them comes from Madeira and Azores Islands.

== Serbia and Montenegro ==
&quot;See: Music of Serbia and Montenegro&quot;

There is a Serbian rock scene in the Greater Cleveland area.

== Slovenia ==
&quot;See: Music of Slovenia&quot;

Slovenian-American polka musician Frankie Yankovic is by far the most famous musician of that genre. He began his career in the 1930s, beginning with some regional hits in the Detroit and Cleveland areas, followed by mainstream success in the later 1940s.

== Ukraine ==
&quot;See: Music of Ukraine&quot;

Ukrainian-Americans in the Cleveland and Detroit area have kept a folk scene alive, also producing a minor crossover star in the 1920s and 30s, Pawlo Humeniuk, the &quot;King of the Ukrainian Fiddlers&quot;.

Recently, the Ukrainian immigrant band Gogol Bordello have emerged into the mainstream.

== Uruguay ==
The list of many crossover musicians also includes classical three-time Grammy nominated composer Miguel del Aguila see: Music of Uruguay

<text>Lichen simplex chronicus (LSC) is thick leathery skin with exaggerated skin markings caused by sudden itching and excessive rubbing and scratching. It generally results in small bumps, patches, scratch marks and scale. It typically affects the neck, scalp, upper eyelids, ears, palms, soles, ankles, wrists, genital areas and bottom. It often develops gradually and the scratching becomes a habit.

== Signs and symptoms ==
People burdened with LSC report pruritus, followed by uncontrollable scratching of the same body region, excessively. Most common sites of LSC are the sides of the neck, the scalp, ankles, vulva, pubis, scrotum, and extensor sides of the forearms. However, due to the stigma associated with chronic scratching, some patients will not admit to chronic rubbing or abrasion. The skin may become thickened and hyperpigmented (lichenified) as a direct result of chronic excoriation. Typically this period of increased scratching is associated with stressors.

== Causes ==
This is a skin disorder characterized by a self-perpetuating scratch-itch cycle: 
*It may begin with something that rubs, irritates, or scratches the skin, such as clothing.
*This causes the person to rub or scratch the affected area. Constant scratching causes the skin to thicken.
*The thickened skin itches, causing more scratching, causing more thickening.
*Affected area may spread rapidly through the rest of the body.
Many hypothesize LSC has a psychosomatic origin. Those predisposed to itch as a response to emotional tensions may be more susceptible to the itch-scratch cycle. It may also be associated with nervousness, anxiety, depression, and other psychological disorders. Many people with LSC are aware of the scratching they do during the day, but they might not be aware of the scratching they do in their sleep. LSC is also associated with atopy, or atopic dermatitis (eczema) and an increase of histamine levels.

== Diagnosis ==
LSC is typically diagnosed by careful observation and history taking. It is easily recognized (see &quot;signs and symptoms&quot;, and &quot;gallery&quot;). Biopsies are sometimes necessary to confirm the diagnosis and differentiate it from other similar appearing lesions.

== Treatment ==
Treatment is aimed at reducing itching and minimizing existing lesions because rubbing and scratching exacerbate LSC. The itching and inflammation may be treated with a lotion or steroid cream (such as triamcinolone or Betamethasone) applied to the affected area of the skin. Night-time scratching can be reduced with sedatives and antihistamines. Doxepin is often prescribed, as it offers both antihistamine properties and is also effective at reducing the (itch scratch cycle) associated with the obsessive psychosomatic behavioral symptoms.

<doc id="412774" wikidata="Q1026835" url="?curid=412774" title="Val Thorens">
<text>Val Thorens () is a ski town in the Tarentaise Valley in the French Alps at an altitude of . It is located in the commune of Saint-Martin-de-Belleville in the Savoie department. The resort forms part of the Les Trois Vallées ski area which, with over 600 km of slopes, is one of the largest linked ski areas in the world.

==Resort==
In 1971 the first of three drag lifts was installed, followed in 1972 by the opening of the first ski school.

==Skiing==
The resort is usually open from mid-November until early May. The highest ski-able peaks are Pointe du Bouchet (3230 m) and Cime de Caron (3200 m).
Many of the slopes in Val Thorens face north and north-west. However, the resort itself faces south. Val Thorens has a total of 68 marked runs, and several terrain parks. The main snow park hosts a stage of the national SFR Slopestyle Tour, and the ski cross arena is frequently visited by the FIS Skier X World Cup.

Val Thorens is part of the &quot;3 vallées&quot; ski domain, which is connected by a common ski pass.

===Summer skiing===
Beginning in 1973 Val Thorens operated ski lifts all year round on the Peclet glacier. Low visitations and melting glacier concerns led to a complete removal by 2002.

==Lift system==

Val Thorens has 31 lifts, which include magic carpets, draglifts, chairlifts, gondolas, funitels, and a cable car.

==Accident==
In January 2015, Israeli Guy Sasson was paralyzed from the knees down in a snowboarding accident in Val Thorens in which he fell 10 meters and injured his back and leg vertebrae; he became a Paralympian and won the 2024 French Open Quad Singles event.

==Notable persons==
*Christine Goitschel
*Adrien Theaux
*Jean-Frédéric &quot;JF&quot; Chapuis
*Chloé Trespeuch

==Sports competitions==
===Tour de France===
The resort hosted a Tour de France stage finish in 1994. Nelson Rodríguez of Colombia won the stage, which had the second highest elevation for a stage finish in the history of the Tour de France.

The Tour de France returned to Val Thorens for the Stage 20 finish on 27 July 2019 and won by Vincenzo Nibali.

===Ski competitions===
In December 2017, Val Thorens is host city for snowboard cross during the 2017–18 FIS Snowboard World Cup.

<doc id="412775" wikidata="Q281772" url="?curid=412775" title="Safari Rally">
<text>The Safari Rally is an automobile rally held in Kenya. It was first held in 1953 as a celebration of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The event was part of the World Rally Championship from 1973 until 2002, before returning in 2021. It is historically regarded as one of the toughest events in the World Rally Championship, and one of the most popular rallies in Africa. From 2003, a historical event (East African Safari Rally) has been held biennially.

== History ==
It was first held from 27 May to 1 June 1953 as the East African Coronation Safari in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika, as a celebration of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In 1960 it was renamed the East African Safari Rally and kept that name until 1974, when it became the Safari Rally. From 1973, the rally was part of the World Rally Championship.

The route featured a variety of roads and terrain - from fesh fesh (very fine powdered sand), fast farm tracks, and very rough roads up or down the Great Rift Valley. In heavy rain, roads would often turn into thick, deep mud. The event was run on open roads, with all of the route being competitive mileage.&lt;ref name=&quot;juwra.com/About timing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The driver with the lowest accumulation of penalty time between time controls was declared the winner.

The rally was historically one of the fastest events in the world championship with average speeds over . However, the roughness of the terrain and the long stages meant that the winner was often the most reliable or the fastest cautious driver. In later years, top rally teams would use helicopters to fly ahead of the cars to warn of animals or other vehicles on the rally route.Teams built specially strengthened cars for the event, with bullbars, snorkels (for river crossings) and bright lights to warn wildlife. In the 1990s, Toyota Team Europe had a full-time test team in Kenya, preparing and testing the rally cars for the event. During the rally, repairs had to be regularly made to the cars, which added to the elapsed time of the competitors. In later years, tyre mousse - allowing tyres to maintain functionality despite a puncture - allowed drivers to tackle the event flat out, despite the length of the event.

In 1996, the event adopted the special stage format, and servicing cars from helicopters was prohibited. From that edition until 2002, it featured around 2000 km of timed stages, with stages well over long, unlike most rallies which had under of total timed distance. This meant that the winner&#x27;s total time penalty was above 12 hours in 1996 and decreased to two seconds shy of 8 hours in 2002. Despite this, the rally continued to be run on open roads. The event was excluded from the WRC calendar due to a lack of finance and organisation in 2003.

=== Modern event ===
From the 2003 edition, the event became part of the African Rally Championship. The event was modernised, with shorter stages and running on closed roads - like other events in the World Championship. Two editions of the rally - 2007 and 2009 - were also part of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. In 2013, President of Kenya Uhuru Kenyatta announced a plan to return the Safari Rally to the world championship.

On the 27 September 2019, it was announced that the 2020 edition would be part of the World Rally Championship. This event was later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Safari Rally eventually made a comeback to the WRC in 2021 after an eighteen-year hiatus from the 24–27 June, with a successful event held in Kenya on the floor of the Rift Valley in Naivasha, Nakuru County. Sebastian Ogier and Julien Ingrassia emerged as winners in their Toyota Yaris WRC. The Safari has a WRC contract until 2026.

==Winners==
Kenyan drivers Shekhar Mehta and Carl Tundo have been the most successful competitors, with five outright victories each. Mehta won first in 1973, then consecutively from 1979 to 1982 - all while the event was part of the world championship. Tundo won five editions when the event was part of the African Rally Championship - the 2004, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2018 events. Tundo has also finished on the podium twelve times, ahead of fellow Kenyan Ian Duncan with nine podium finishes.
Notes: IMC = International Championship for Manufacturers, WRC = World Rally Championship, 2LWC = 2-Litre World Cup, ARC = African Rally Championship, IRC = Intercontinental Rally Challenge, KRC = Kenya National Rally Championship
== East African Safari Rally (classic) ==
The East African Safari Rally is a Classic rally event first held in 2003 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the first running of the event. The event has since been held biennially. The nine day event takes place over , and is open to vehicles built before 1985. The 2017 edition of the rally had joint winners, as both Richard Jackson and Carl Tundo had the same time.

<doc id="412786" wikidata="Q926462" url="?curid=412786" title="Tinea versicolor">
<text>Tinea versicolor (also pityriasis versicolor) is a condition characterized by a skin eruption on the trunk and proximal extremities. The majority of tinea versicolor is caused by the fungus &quot;Malassezia globosa&quot;, although &quot;Malassezia furfur&quot; is responsible for a small number of cases. These yeasts are normally found on the human skin and become troublesome only under certain conditions, such as a warm and humid environment, although the exact conditions that cause initiation of the disease process are poorly understood.

The condition pityriasis versicolor was first identified in 1846. Versicolor comes from the Latin &quot;&quot; &#x27;to turn&#x27; + &quot;color&quot;. 

It is commonly referred to as Peter Elam&#x27;s disease in many parts of South Asia.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs of this condition include:
* Occasional fine scaling of the skin producing a very superficial ash-like scale
* Pale, dark tan, or pink in color, with a reddish undertone that can darken when the patient is overheated, such as in a hot shower or during/after exercise. Tanning typically makes the affected areas contrast more starkly with the surrounding skin.
* Sharp border

Pityriasis versicolor is more common in hot, humid climates or in those who sweat heavily, so it may recur each summer. 

The yeasts can often be seen under the microscope within the lesions and typically have a so-called &quot;spaghetti and meatball appearance&quot; as the round yeasts produce filaments.

In people with dark skin tones, pigmentary changes such as hypopigmentation (loss of color) are common, while in those with lighter skin color, hyperpigmentation (increase in skin color) is more common. Because infected skin tans less than uninfected skin, resulting in uneven tanning, the term &quot;sun fungus&quot; is sometimes used.

==Pathophysiology==
In cases of tinea versicolor caused by the fungus &quot;Malassezia furfur&quot;, lightening of the skin occurs due to the fungus&#x27;s production of azelaic acid, which has a slight bleaching effect.

==Diagnosis==

Tinea versicolor may be diagnosed by a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation and lesions may fluoresce copper-orange when exposed to Wood&#x27;s lamp (UV-A light).
The differential diagnosis for tinea versicolor infection includes:
* Progressive macular hypomelanosis
* Pityriasis alba
* Pityriasis rosea
* Seborrheic dermatitis
* Erythrasma
* Vitiligo
* Leprosy
* Syphilis
* Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation

==Treatment==
Treatments for tinea versicolor include:
* Topical antifungal medications containing selenium sulfide are often recommended. Ketoconazole (Nizoral ointment and shampoo) is another treatment. It is normally applied to dry skin and washed off after 20 minutes, repeated daily for two weeks. Ciclopirox (ciclopirox olamine) is an alternative treatment to ketoconazole, as it suppresses growth of the yeast &quot;Malassezia furfur&quot;. Initial results show similar efficacy to ketoconazole with a relative increase in subjective symptom relief due to its inherent anti-inflammatory properties. Other topical antifungal agents such as clotrimazole, miconazole, terbinafine, or zinc pyrithione can lessen symptoms in some patients. Additionally, hydrogen peroxide has been known to lessen symptoms and, on certain occasions, remove the problem, although permanent scarring has occurred with this treatment in some people. Clotrimazole is also used combined with selenium sulfide.
* Oral medications are viewed as a second-line of treatment for pityriasis versicolor in the event of widespread, severe, recalcitrant or recurrent cases. Systemic therapies include itraconazole (200 mg daily for seven days) and fluconazole (150 to 300 mg weekly dose for 2 to 4 weeks) that are preferred to oral ketoconazole which is no longer approved due to its potential hepatotoxic side effects. The single-dose regimens and pulse therapy regimens can be made more effective by having the patient exercise 1–2 hours after the dose, to induce sweating. The sweat is allowed to evaporate, and showering is delayed for a day, leaving a film of the medication on the skin.

==Epidemiology==
This skin disease commonly affects adolescents and young adults, especially in warm and humid climates. The yeast is thought to feed on skin oils (lipids), as well as dead skin cells. Infections are more common in people who have seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff, and hyperhidrosis.

<doc id="412790" wikidata="Q880085" url="?curid=412790" title="James J. Blanchard">
<text>James Johnston Blanchard (born August 8, 1942) is an American attorney, diplomat, and politician who served as the 45th governor of Michigan from 1983 to 1991. A member of the Democratic Party, Blanchard previously served in the United States House of Representatives from 1975 to 1983, and later as the United States Ambassador to Canada from 1993 to 1996.

== Early life and education ==
Blanchard was born in Detroit, Michigan, on August 8, 1942. He grew up and attended Ferndale high school in Ferndale, Michigan. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Michigan State University in 1964 and an MBA in 1965. Blanchard received a Juris Doctor from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1968 and was admitted to the State Bar of Michigan soon after. He currently lives in Pleasant Ridge, Michigan.

== Career ==
Blanchard commenced practice as an attorney in Lansing and served as legal advisor to the Michigan Secretary of State in 1968 and 1969. He was Assistant Attorney General of Michigan, from 1969 to 1974, administrative assistant to the attorney general from 1970 to 1971, and assistant deputy attorney general from 1971 to 1972. In 1974 he joined the law firm of Beer and Boltz, in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.

===U.S. Representative===
Blanchard was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives from Michigan&#x27;s 18th District for the 94th United States Congress and to the three succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1975 to January 1, 1983. During that time, he was responsible for legislation providing federal loan guarantees for Chrysler Corporation that saved the company from a likely bankruptcy.

===Governor of Michigan===

Blanchard opted not to run for re-election to the U.S. House in 1982 and was elected Governor of Michigan, defeating Republican Richard Headlee, a Farmington Hills insurance company executive. Blanchard served two terms as governor (1983–1991) until his defeat by Republican state senator John Engler in 1990. Blanchard was the first Democratic governor to serve in 20 years since John Swainson, who left office in 1963.

On January 1, 1983, he took over what was described as &quot;the toughest governor&#x27;s job in America.&quot; His state faced a $1.7 billion deficit, the threat of bankruptcy, record high unemployment of more than 17 percent and the worst credit rating in America. Working with leaders of business, labor, education and local government, the governor put together a strategy for Michigan&#x27;s future and raised income taxes and fees necessary to keep it on track. Blanchard completed his work as Michigan&#x27;s 45th governor having balanced eight consecutive state budgets, improving the state&#x27;s credit rating, established a $422 million &quot;rainy-day fund,&quot; and producing a solvency dividend of more than $1 billion in savings from reduced borrowing costs.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; credited Governor Blanchard with leading &quot;one of the most dramatic economic turnabouts in the recent history of state government,&quot; and national publications such as &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; listed him among the best governors in America, one of the innovators and energizers who made things work in an era of declining federal aid. However, in 1990 Blanchard lost his campaign for a third term to State Senator John Engler.

===Later career===
After losing the gubernatorial election to John Engler in 1990, Blanchard became a partner in the Washington law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand. He also chaired Bill Clinton&#x27;s successful campaign for president in Michigan in 1992.

President Clinton appointed Blanchard United States Ambassador to Canada, a position he held from 1993 to 1996. In 2002, Blanchard again ran for governor but lost his primary bid to State Attorney General Jennifer Granholm. , he was a partner in the Washington D.C. law firm of DLA Piper U.S. and resided in Beverly Hills, Michigan. He served as Chairman of Meridian International Center and on the Advisory Board of the Institute for Law and Politics at the University of Minnesota Law School and was President of the Foundation for the National Archives. Blanchard also co-chaired the Canada-United States Law Institute.

Blanchard served on the board of Canadian pipeline corporation Enbridge for over 10 years and advised them following the 2010 Kalamazoo River oil spill. He also served as a member of the &quot;Debt Reduction Task Force&quot; at the Bipartisan Policy Center. and was a board member of Nortel and Chrysler Group LLC (2009–2012).

Blanchard is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

<doc id="412792" wikidata="Q378442" url="?curid=412792" title="Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force">
<text>The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF; ) is the aviation branch of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army. The present air force came into being when the Imperial Iranian Air Force was renamed in 1979 following the Iranian Revolution. The IRIAF was heavily involved in the Iran–Iraq War, carrying out major operations like Operation Kaman 99, Operation Sultan 10, the H-3 airstrike, and the first attack on a nuclear reactor in history, Operation Scorch Sword. As a result of eight years of aerial combat in that conflict, the IRIAF has the second highest claimed number of fighter aces in the region, exceeded only by the Israeli Air Force; as many as seven IRIAF pilots claimed more than six kills, mostly achieved in the F-14 Tomcat. Veterans of the Iran–Iraq War would go on to form the core of the IRIAF command.

==History==

The IRIAF came into being when the former Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF) was renamed following the Islamic Revolution in Iran, in February 1979. The British publishing company Orbis&#x27; &quot;Warplane&quot; partwork magazine seems to indicate the renaming did not actually take place until after the Iran–Iraq War had broken out.

This &quot;new&quot; Iranian air force largely inherited the equipment and structure of the former IIAF, even losing most of its leading officers in the course of post-revolutionary chaos, as well as due to the prosecution of those considered as loyal to the Shah, pro-U.S. or elsewhere by the new government in Tehran.

Due to strained relations with the West, Iran had to procure new equipment from Brazil, the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Since the Revolution, the exact composition of the IRIAF has been hard to determine but estimates do exist. Many aircraft belonging to the Iraqi Air Force took refuge in Iran during the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and many were put into service with the IRIAF or taken apart for spare parts.

Due to the continuous spare parts shortages faced by the air force, a decision was made in the late 1980s to develop a local aerospace industry to support the air force.

In 2002, Iran with the co-operation of Ukraine, successfully started the manufacture of the Iran-140, a licence-built version of the Antonov An-140 transport aircraft. Simultaneously, Iran began construction of two domestically produced fighters, upgraded using technology from the F-14 Tomcat and the F-5 Tiger II. The fighters have been named the Azarakhsh and the Shafaq.

Since then, the country has also become self-sufficient in the manufacture of helicopters. The country claims that it is capable of producing the U.S. AH-1 Cobra gunship. Additionally, Iran also produces Bell Helicopter Bell 212 and Bell 206 helicopters in serial production. These are known respectively as the Shabaviz 2-75 and the Shabaviz 206.

===Iran–Iraq War (1980–88)===
A series of purges and forced retirements resulted in the manpower of the service being halved between February 1979 and July 1980, leaving the IRIAF ill-prepared for the Iran–Iraq War (also called the &quot;1st Persian Gulf War&quot;). The sudden Iraqi air strikes against eight major Iranian airbases and four other military installations, launched on the afternoon of 22 September 1980, came as a complete surprise and caused a shock in the IRIAF.

The Iranians retaliated on 23 September 1980 with Operation Kaman 99, which involved 206 F-4, F-5 and F-14 aircraft. In that operation, 40 F-4 Phantoms, armed with Mark 82, Mark 83 and Mark 84 bombs and AGM-65 Maverick missiles, took off from Hamadan. After refueling mid-air, the Phantoms reached the Iraqi capital Baghdad, where they attacked the al-Rashid, al-Habbaniyah and al-Kut airbases. Meanwhile, eight more F-4s took off from Tehran and launched a second attack on the al-Rashid airbase.

Iran proceeded to launch 58 F-5E Tiger IIs from Tabriz, which were sent to attack Mosul Airbase. After the attack on Mosul Airbase, another 50 F-5Es were dispatched to strike Nasiriyah Airbase, which was heavily damaged.

As all 148 Iranian F-4s and F-5s had been sent for a bombing raid on Iraq, 60 F-14 Tomcats were scrambled to defend Iranian airspace against a possible Iraqi retaliation. Iranian F-14s managed to down 2 Iraqi MiG-21s (1 MiG-21RF and 1 MiG-21MF) and 3 Iraqi MiG-23s (MiG-23MS); an Iranian F-5E also shot down an Iraqi Su-20 during the operation. Iraqi MiG-23s managed to down 2 F-5Es, while Iraqi MiG-21s also downed 2 F-5Es. The Iraqis also shot down one of their own Il-76MD strategic airlifters with a SA-3 SAM.

The Iraqis however were well prepared for the attack and had flown over most of their air force to other Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia, this made sure that most of the Iraqi Air Force survived the operation.

Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi military were dealt a heavy blow when Iranian Air Force vulnerabilities failed to materialize. All Iraqi air bases&#x27; near Iran were out of order for weeks and, according to Iran, Iraq&#x27;s aerial efficiency was reduced by 55%. This allowed Iranians to regroup and prepare for the upcoming Iraqi invasion.

Although the readiness rates of the IRIAF significantly increased in the following months, its overall role and influence declined, as the clerical government prioritized resources for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) militias and simultaneously attempted to develop a separate air arm for this service.

Despite limitations and sanctions, the IRIAF achieved a successful kill rate in air-to-air combat against Iraqi jets, to the point that in air-to-air engagements, Iran&#x27;s kill ratio was roughly 5:1, which is only surpassed by the Israelis against Syria in 1982 and the US in the Gulf war in 1991. It got to the point where Iraq ordered its pilots to avoid air-to-air engagements (especially with the F-14). After the successful liberation of most Iranian areas captured by the Iraqis in the first half of 1982, the situation of the IRIAF changed completely. From an air arm that was offensive by nature, it was largely relegated to air defense and relatively infrequent bombing attacks against targets of industrial and military significance inside Iraq. Simultaneously, the IRIAF had to learn how to maintain and keep operational its large fleet of U.S.-built aircraft and helicopters without outside help, due to American sanctions. Relying primarily on antiquated equipment purchased from the US in the 1970s, the Iranians began establishing their own aerospace industry.
Starting from 1984 and 1985, the IRIAF found itself confronted by an ever-better organized and equipped opponent, as the Iraqi Air force—reinforced by deliveries of advanced fighter-bombers from France and the Soviet Union—launched numerous offensives against Iranian air bases, military bases, industrial infrastructures, power plants, oil-export hubs, and population centers. These became better known as &quot;The Tanker War&quot; and &quot;The War of the Cities&quot;. To defend against an increasing number of Iraqi air strikes, the IRIAF leaned heavily on its large fleet of Grumman F-14 Tomcat interceptor fighters. Tomcats were mainly deployed in defense of the strategically important Khark Island (main hub for Iranian oil exports), and Tehran. Over 300 air-to-air engagements against IQAF fighters, fighter-bombers, and bombers, were fought in these areas alone between 1980 and 1988.

Confronted with the fact that it could not obtain replacements for equipment lost in what became a war of attrition against Iraq, the IRIAF remained defense-orientated for the rest of the conflict, conserving its surviving assets as a &quot;force in being&quot;. From mid 1987, the IRIAF found itself confronted also with U.S. Navy fighters over the Persian Gulf. A number of confrontations that occurred between July 1987 and August 1988 stretched available IRIAF assets to the limit, exhausting its capability to defend Iranian air space against Iraqi air strikes.

With this brutal air fight during 8 consecutive years, many Iranian fighter pilots claimed world records during the war, such as General Yadollah Khalili, who holds the worldwide record of the longest straight flight in a fighter plane, having flown an F-14 non-stop for 11 hours, thus having had to do aerial refuelling 8 times during the process, or like Fereydoun Ali Mazandarani, who holds the record for being the first pilot to do aerial refuelling in an F-14 in a night environment. As a result of this war, the IRIAF developed proven tactics and skillful battle tested pilots, thus becoming one of the most experienced air arms in the region.
The most notable Iranian fighter pilots were Fereydoun Ali Mazandarani, Fazlollah Javidnia, Jalil Zandi and Shahram Rostami. Other notable pilots include, Hossein Khalatbari, Abbas Doran, Hassan Harandi, Abolfazl Mehreganfar, Ghafour Jeddi, Abbas Babaei and Ali Eghbali Dogahe among many others.

===Post Iran–Iraq War===
Immediately after the end of the Iran–Iraq War, the IRIAF was partially rebuilt through limited purchases of MiG-29 fighters and Su-24 bombers from the Soviet Union, as well as F-7M and FT-7 fighters from China. While providing needed reinforcement to the Iranian Air Force, these types never replaced the older, U.S.-built F-4 Phantoms, F-14s (the IRIAF is now the only air arm in the world using the fighter), or F-5s. Instead, the IRIAF continued its efforts to keep these types in service, and began a number of projects to refurbish and upgrade them.

===1990s===
During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, numerous Iraqi pilots flew Iraqi Air Force aircraft to Iran to avoid destruction by coalition forces. The Iranians impounded these aircraft and never returned them, putting them in service in the IRIAF and claiming them as reparations for the Iran–Iraq War. The aircraft included several Mirage F1s, MiG-23s, MiG-29s, Su-20s, Su-22Ms, Su-24s, Su-25s and a number of Il-76s, including the secret, one-off AEW-AWACS Il-76 &quot;ADNAN 1&quot; prototype.

Even after the cease-fire with Iraq, the IRIAF carried out several air raids against Kurdish bases in northern Iraq. The first of such raids was conducted using eight F-4s armed with rockets and cluster bombs on 6 April 1992 against People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran&#x27;s Camp Ashraf. During this event one F-4 was shot down by either insurgent or Iraqi military AAA and both pilots (Lt. Col Amini and Cpt. Sharifi) were captured and not freed until 1998. Despite threats of response, Iraq was not able to retaliate due to its own fight against Kurdish separatist guerrillas and the Western-imposed no-fly zones that crippled and limited its air force&#x27;s operations.

In 2007, Iraq asked Iran to return some of the scores of Iraqi fighter planes that flew there ahead of the Gulf War in 1991. And as of 2014, Iran was receptive to the demands and was working on refurbishing an unspecified number of jets. In late 2014, Iran returned 130 military aircraft to Iraq.

===2000s===
In 2006, after Iranian media published a series of reports suggesting that Venezuela was interested in selling its 21 F-16 Fighting Falcons to Iran, a Hugo Chavez adviser confirmed to the Associated Press that &quot;Venezuela&#x27;s military is considering selling its fleet of U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets to another country, possibly Iran, in response to a U.S. ban on arms sales to President Hugo Chávez&#x27;s government&quot;. In response, Sean McCormack, a U.S. State Department spokesperson, warned Venezuela that &quot;without the written consent of the United States, Venezuela can&#x27;t transfer these defense articles, and in this case F-16s, to a third country&quot;.
According to Moscow Defense Brief, Russia delivered 6 Su-25UBK ground attack fighter-trainers, 12 Mi-171Sh military transport helicopters, 21 Mi-171 transport helicopters, and 3 Mi-17B-5 medical helicopters to Iran between 2000 and 2006. A $700 million repair and modernization program of the IRIAF MiG-29 and Su-24 fighters was also completed.

On 22 September 2009, an IRIAF Il-76 collided with an F-5E shortly after an annual parade in Tehran and crashed near Varamin, killing all seven people on board.

===2010s===
At the end of 2014, there was evidence that the IRIAF was involved in the 2014 military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. A video released by Aljazeera seemed to show an Iranian F-4 Phantom II bombing some ISIS buildings in Diyala Governorate.

On 25 December 2019, an MiG-29 crashed in the Sabalan mountains, and on Aug. 26, 2018, an F-5F crash-landed near Dezful, killing the pilot and injuring the co-pilot.

===2020s===
The IRIAF air fleet is aging, some aircraft are more than 40 years old, and this has led to several crashes. On June 1, 2021, another F-5F crashed near Dezful, killing both crew. A F-5F crashed into a school in Tabriz on February 21, 2022, killing both crew and a person on the ground. On May 24, 2022 two Chinese-built Chengdu J-7 crashed east of Isfahan killing the pilots.

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Iran and Russia have formed closer relations, with Iran supplying Russia with loitering munitions such as the HESA Shahed 136. Subsequently, Russia has begun to supply Iran with more advanced weapon systems, namely the Yakovlev Yak-130 jet trainer, which had its first two examples delivered in September 2023.

== Structure ==
Note: former outdated Jane&#x27;s Sentinel estimate of units 1993 data (Source: Jane&#x27;s Sentinel, Islamic Republic of Iran, 1993, – not complete) has now been replaced by newer 2019 data

The IRIAF&#x27;s composition has changed very little since 1979. There have been limited relocations and unit disbandments in the late 1980s (F-4D/E and F-14 fleet at Shiraz and Mehrabad). Deployments during the war with Iraq were mainly of temporary character. A major reorganization of existing air-defense SAM and AAA units took place in 1985. There have not been any major reorganizations in the 1990s.

Equipment, capabilities, and performance also strongly influenced the development of the Iraqi Air Force (IQAF) in the 1980s, but also that of the United Arab Emirates Air Force, in the 1990s and the most recent times.

As of 2013 the Iranian authorities also changed the command structure (tactical air bases, military installations, civil airports) and this former status is not in effect any longer. Almost all airfields indicated of being of some strategic importance for contingency scenarios have now been made suitable for combined military and civilian usage. This is also in accordance with the fact that IRIAF only is operating small composite (easy to relocate at very short notice) units spread out all over the country instead of the former large fix-based units. Therefore, all combined airfields are accommodated with basic cross-service capabilities to handle all IRIAF aircraft. The main facilities for logistics and technical overhaul however remain concentrated at some larger airfields.

Iran has been under sanctions since 1979 and thus the country has become capable of servicing and overhauling its own military and civilian aircraft. However, less tension in the current (2015) international situation led to a decrease of the sanctions, and the Iranian government is now capable again in ordering a new fleet of civilian aircraft replacing the aged types.

==Aircraft==
=== Current inventory ===


In 2007, Iraq asked Iran to return some of the scores of Iraqi fighter planes that flew there ahead of the Gulf War in 1991. As of 2014, Iran was receptive to the demands and was working on refurbishing an unspecified number of jets. In late 2014, Iran returned 130 military aircraft to Iraq.

==Reported future expansion plans ==

A 13-year long UN arms embargo imposed on Iran was lifted on 18 October 2020. However, the poor state of Iran&#x27;s finances and the threat of American sanctions on those trading with the country made it unlikely for Tehran to pass large orders for military equipment. In November 2023, deputy defense minister Mehdi Farahi said that plans had been finalized for the Iranian armed forces to receive Sukhoi Su-35s, Yakovlev Yak-130s and Mil Mi-28s.

There have been reports that the IRIAF would be interested in the following aircraft for its modernization program:

* Su-30: It is reported that Israeli defense officials were investigating a potential Iran–Russia deal, in which Iran would pay $1 billion for a dozen squadrons’ worth of Su-30 jets. Iran and Russia have both denied this and have rejected these claims as propaganda. In a broadcast the Mehr News Agency a dozen Su-30s were seen on 15, 16 September 2008; further the report reads: &quot;In this joint maneuver of the IRIAF and the AFAGIR which is called the &#x27;Guardians of the Nations Skies&#x27; the Air Forces of Iran have tested domestically developed systems as well as newly purchased systems (from Russia and China).&quot; The purchase of this fighter would improve Iranian air force capability significantly, as it would be able to cover almost the entire Middle East from the Iranian territory.
* Su-35: Iran is reportedly interested in this aircraft in order to obtain a crucial edge over its potential rivals in the region.
* J-10: The Russian news agency Novosti reported that &quot;Business &amp; Financial Markets&quot; said Iran has signed a deal with China to buy two squadrons/24 of J-10 fighter planes with Russian-made AL-31FN engines. The total cost of the planes is estimated at $1 billion, and deliveries are expected between 2008 and 2010. China denied that it had agreed to sell its home-grown fighter jets to Iran, saying no talks had taken place. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told reporters: &quot;It&#x27;s not true, it is an irresponsible report, China has not had talks with Iran on J-10 jets.&quot;

==Facilities==

In the last several years several new airfields have been constructed in central- and eastern Iran. Some of these facilities have since seen full-scale deployments of IRIAF units, and it now appears that at least two became permanent &quot;Tactical Fighter Bases&quot; (TFBs). These are the first such bases established since 1979. Except new airfields, with Chinese support, the IRIAF constructed also a number of new early warning radar sites around the country. Its ability to control the national airspace, however, remains limited—mainly due to the rugged terrain and lack of airborne early warning assets.

Aside from maintaining 17 TFBs, the IRIAF operates numerous temporary detachments on several minor airfields around the country. Ex-Iraqi Mirage F.1EQs, usually based at TFB.14, near Mashhad, were frequently seen over the Persian Gulf in 2005 and 2006.

==Major operations==
* Iran–Iraq War
** Operation Kaman 99, Iran&#x27;s biggest air raid during the Iran–Iraq war with a strength of more than 140 aircraft.
** Operation Scorch Sword, an Iranian airstrike on an Iraqi nuclear reactor under construction.
** H-3 airstrike, The IRIAF&#x27;s boldest operation in Iraq.
** Operation Morvarid, a successful joint operation by the IRIAF and the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy in the Persian Gulf against the Iraqi Air Force and Navy.
** Operation Sultan 10, an operation to disrupt delivery of new French fighter planes to the Iraqi Air force and the associated training of personnel, during the Iran–Iraq war.

<doc id="412796" wikidata="Q1209744" url="?curid=412796" title="Uterine cancer">
<text>Uterine cancer, also known as womb cancer, includes two types of cancer that develop from the tissues of the uterus. Endometrial cancer forms from the lining of the uterus, and uterine sarcoma forms from the muscles or support tissue of the uterus. Endometrial cancer accounts for approximately 90% of all uterine cancers in the United States. Symptoms of endometrial cancer include changes in vaginal bleeding or pain in the pelvis. Symptoms of uterine sarcoma include unusual vaginal bleeding or a mass in the vagina.
Risk factors for endometrial cancer include obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, taking pills that contain estrogen without progesterone, a history of tamoxifen use, late menopause, and a family history of the condition. Risk factors for uterine sarcoma include prior radiation therapy to the pelvis. Diagnosis of endometrial cancer is typically based on an endometrial biopsy. A diagnosis of uterine sarcoma may be suspected based on symptoms, a pelvic exam, and medical imaging.
Endometrial cancer can often be cured while uterine sarcoma typically is harder to treat. Treatment may include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy. Just over 80% of women survive more than 5 years following diagnosis.
In 2015 about 3.8 million women were affected globally and it resulted in 90,000 deaths. Endometrial cancer is relatively common while uterine sarcomas are rare. In the United States, uterine cancers represent 3.5% of new cancer cases. They most commonly occur in women between the ages of 45 and 74 with a median age of diagnosis of 63.

== Types ==
The terms uterine cancer and womb cancer may refer to several different types of cancer that occur in the uterus, namely:

=== Endometrial cancer ===

* &quot;Endometrial carcinomas&quot; originate from cells in the glands of the endometrium (uterine lining). These include the common and readily treatable &quot;well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma,&quot; as well as the more aggressive &quot;uterine papillary serous carcinoma&quot; and &quot;uterine clear-cell carcinoma&quot;.
* &quot;Malignant mixed Müllerian tumors&quot; (also known as uterine carcinosarcomas) are rare endometrial tumors which show both glandular (carcinomatous) and stromal (sarcomatous) differentiation.

=== Uterine sarcomas ===

*&quot;Leiomyosarcomas&quot; originate from the muscular layer of the uterus (or myometrium). Of note, leiomyosarcomas are distinct from uterine leiomyomas, which are benign tumors of the uterus.
*&quot;Endometrial stromal sarcomas&quot; originate from the connective tissues of the endometrium, and are far less common than endometrial carcinomas.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Both types of uterine cancer can present with abnormal vaginal bleeding and discharge. Abnormalities can include change in duration or amount of menstrual bleeding as well as new bleeding between menses or after menopause. Sensations of new or increasing pelvic pressure or pain can also indicate tumor growth in the uterus. Any of these findings warrant further workup by a doctor.

== Causes and risk factors ==

It is not known with certainty what the causes for uterine cancer may be, though hormone imbalance is cited as a risk factor. Estrogen receptors, known to be present on the surfaces of cells of this type of cancer, are thought to interact with the hormone causing increased cell growth, which can then result in cancer. The exact mechanism of how this occurs is not understood.

Risk factors for endometrial cancer include obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, taking pills that contain estrogen without progesterone, a history of tamoxifen use, late menopause, and certain hereditary conditions (Lynch syndrome, Cowden syndrome). Risk factors for uterine sarcoma include prior radiation therapy to the pelvis, a history of tamoxifen use, a history of childhood retinoblastoma, and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome.

== Diagnosis ==
To evaluate for uterine cancer, a clinician might perform a pelvic exam to visually inspect internal pelvic organs and to feel the size and position of the uterus and ovaries. A “pap smear” may also be done to brush the sides of the cervix to collect cells for testing and to look at under a microscope. A dilatation and curettage is often done to collect a sample of uterine lining tissue. An ultrasound is also often performed to look for tumors.

== Screening and Prevention ==

Screening for uterine cancers is not recommended except for in women with certain hereditary conditions that increase their risk (Lynch, Cowden, HLRCC). 

In general, combined oral contraceptive pills and progestin-only pills are protective against uterine cancers. Weight loss and/or bariatric surgery reduces the risk for patients with obesity.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of uterine cancer may differ depending on the type of cancer and staging of the tumor. In early stages, minimal invasive surgery is preferred. 

For endometrial cancer, five main types of treatments are used, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy. The most common treatment modality for endometrial cancer is surgery, whereby the uterus is removed via a total hysterectomy. Hysterectomies may also be accompanied by removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes, called a salpingo-oophorectomy. Additionally, hormone therapy which seeks to block the growth of cancer cells may also be used in the treatment of endometrial cancer. Targeted therapy may include monoclonal antibodies, mTOR inhibitors, and signal transduction inhibitors which all act to target cancer cells specifically. 

As of 2021, treatment options for uterine sarcoma include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.

== Prognosis ==
Prognosis varies for the different types of endometrial cancer. Factors that influence prognosis across types of uterine cancer are age at diagnosis, the stage of the cancer, the grade of the cancer, histology, depth of invasion into the myometrium, and the presence of spread to nearby lymph nodes or other regions. Endometrial cancer typically has a good 5-year-survival when diagnosed early. Generally, the prognosis is poorer for uterine sarcomas as compared to endometrial cancers.

==Epidemiology==
Uterine cancer effects approximately 3.1% of females during their lifetime. Uterine cancer resulted in 45,000 deaths worldwide in 1990, with this number increasing to 58,000 deaths in 2010. North America and Northern Europe have the highest rates of uterine cancer. Asia, Southern Europe, Australia and South America have moderate rates, with the lowest rates in Africa and Eastern Asia. About 81% of women with uterine cancer survive for five years. This rate is higher with more localized cancer at 95% survival rate for five years and lower for a distant spread of the cancer, at a 16.8% survival rate for five years.

===United Kingdom===

Uterine cancer is the fourth most common cancer in females in the UK (around 8,500 women were diagnosed with the disease in 2011), and it is the tenth most common cause of cancer death in females (around 2,000 women died in 2012).

===United States===

Uterine cancer has a high prevalence in the United States, with approximately 772,247 women with the disease in 2016. Of those uterine cancers, approximately 90% of the cases are endometrial cancers. This is the fourth most commonly diagnosed type of cancer. 

In the United States, uterine cancer is the most common invasive gynecologic cancer. The number of women diagnosed with uterine cancer has been steadily increasing, with 35,040 diagnosed in 1999 and 56,808 diagnosed in 2016. The age-adjusted rate of new cases in 1999 was 23.9 per 100,000 and has increased to 27.3 per 100,000 in 2016. The incidence of uterine cancer increased even more in 2019, with an approximated 61,880 new cases.

The rates of incidence and death for uterine cancer differ depending on race. The rate of diagnosis is highest for white females, with 28.1 new cases per 100,000 persons. Black females have a similar incidence with 27.4 new cases per 100,000 persons. Other ethnic groups had lower incidences: Hispanic females had 24.1 new cases per 100,000 persons, Asian/Pacific Islander females had 20.8 new cases per 100,000 persons, and American Indian/Alaska Native females had 19.7 new cases per 100,000 persons. For the death rates of uterine cancer, black females had the highest rates, 8.5 deaths per 100,000 persons. The death rates for the other ethnic groups were dramatically lower. White females had 4.4 deaths per 100,000 persons, Hispanic females had 3.9 deaths per 100,000 persons, American Indian/Alaska Native females had 3.5 deaths per 100,000 persons, and Asian/Pacific Islander females had 3.1 deaths per 100,000 persons.

== Research ==
As current diagnostic methods are invasive and inaccurate, researchers are looking into new ways to catch womb cancer, especially in its early stages. A study found that using a technique involving infrared light on simple blood test samples detected uterine cancer with high accuracy (87%), and could detect precancerous growths in all cases.

<doc id="412798" wikidata="Q880767" url="?curid=412798" title="William Milliken">
<text>William Grawn Milliken (March 26, 1922 – October 18, 2019) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 44th governor of Michigan from 1969 to 1983. A member of the Republican Party, he assumed the governorship following the resignation of George Romney and went on to win three terms in 1970, 1974, and 1978, becoming the longest-serving governor in Michigan history. During this period he dealt with dramatic changes to the state economy, due to industrial restructuring and challenges to the auto industry, resulting in loss of jobs and population from Detroit, the state&#x27;s largest city. He also oversaw the PBB crisis and adopted a policy of environmental protection and conservation.

==Early life==
Milliken was born in Traverse City, Michigan, the second child in a family devoted to public service. His father, James T. Milliken, served as mayor of Traverse City and as Michigan state senator for the 27th District, 1941–1950, and his mother Hildegarde (née Grawn) served on the Traverse City School Board; she was the first woman elected to public office in the city. Milliken&#x27;s paternal grandfather James W. Milliken had previously one term as a Michigan state senator from the 27th District, 1898–1900.

After graduating magna cum laude from Traverse City Senior High School, Milliken entered Yale University, where he met his future wife, Helen Wallbank. In 1942, he interrupted his studies to enlist in the Army Reserve Corps and, in early 1943, volunteered for the Army Air Corps. During World War II, he flew 50 combat missions as a waist-gunner on B-24 bombers and survived two crash landings. He received seven military honors, including the Purple Heart and Air Medal.

On October 20, 1945, one month after his honorable discharge, Milliken married Helen. The couple had two children: a daughter, Elaine, a lawyer and feminist who died of cancer in 1993; and a son William, Jr. The following spring, Milliken graduated from Yale.

 William and Helen Milliken moved back to Traverse City that year and he became president of J.W. Milliken, Inc., a department store founded by his grandfather, and later run by his father. Milliken&#x27;s operated locations in Traverse City, Cadillac, Manistee and Mount Pleasant at its peak before being sold to Stage Stores in 1996, then operated as Stage–Milliken before finally being shuttered in 2001. Helen Milliken died at the age of 89 on November 16, 2012, at their Traverse City home, from ovarian cancer.

==Political career==
In 1947, Governor Kim Sigler appointed Milliken to the Michigan Waterways Commission. In 1960, Milliken was elected as a state senator from the 27th District, serving from 1961 to 1964. He was elected and served as the 54th lieutenant governor of Michigan from 1965 to 1969. He succeeded to the position of governor after George W. Romney resigned from office to serve in President Richard Nixon&#x27;s cabinet. Milliken was subsequently elected to full four-year terms in his own right in 1970, 1974, and 1978. He was considered to be a moderate Rockefeller Republican. In June 1982, the governor led the formation of the Council of Great Lakes Governors. 

As Governor for 14 years, Milliken is the longest-serving man in that position in state history. With governors limited to 2 absolute terms in office since 1992, it is unlikely that any will serve longer than Milliken. John Engler served for 12 years as governor from 1991 to 2003, making him the second Republican after Milliken to serve three four-year terms.

In December 1982, Milliken appointed Dorothy Comstock Riley to the Michigan Supreme Court to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Blair Moody, Jr. Riley had run for election to the Supreme Court in the 1982 general election and had been defeated. Milliken was leaving office in less than a month and newly elected Democratic governor James Blanchard argued he should have made the appointment to replace Moody rather than Milliken. In 1983, the other Supreme Court Justices voted 4–2 to remove Riley from the court, and Blanchard appointed his own choice. Riley was elected to the court in her own right in 1985.

==Later life==
After retiring from public office, Milliken moved back to Traverse City. He soon joined the board of directors of the Chrysler Corporation and chaired the Center for the Great Lakes, a research center dedicated to the protection of the Great Lakes. He spoke at the funeral of former Mayor of Detroit Coleman Young in 1997, who was the first African American elected as mayor of that city.

In presidential elections since 2004, Milliken expressed support for several Democratic candidates. In 2004, he endorsed Democratic senator John Kerry in his bid to unseat George W. Bush, stating &quot;The truth is that President George W. Bush does not speak for me or for many other moderate Republicans on a very broad cross section of issues.&quot; In 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain, but backed away in October after McCain&#x27;s campaign began attacking Democratic candidate Barack Obama. He told &quot;The Grand Rapids Press&quot; that &quot;He is not the John McCain I endorsed.&quot; Milliken expressed concern about the direction of the Republican Party: &quot;Increasingly, the party is moving toward rigidity, and I don&#x27;t like that. I think Gerald Ford would hold generally the same view I&#x27;m holding on the direction of the Republican Party.&quot; In August 2016, Milliken announced that he would vote for Hillary Clinton for president in the 2016 presidential election, saying that Donald Trump does not embody Republican ideals.

In Michigan state elections, Milliken supported candidates from both parties. In 2010, he endorsed businessman Rick Snyder in the Republican gubernatorial primary, and continued to support him in the general election. In 2014, he endorsed Snyder for a second term. In the 2014 Senate election, he supported Democrat Gary Peters over the Republican nominee Terri Lynn Land.

In 2015, Milliken signed an amicus brief in support of same-sex marriage.

== Death ==
On October 18, 2019, Milliken died at his home in Traverse City after years of declining health. His remains were cremated and buried on Mackinac Island next to wife, Helen and daughter, Elaine. On August 6, 2020, he was honored with a memorial service at Interlochen Center for the Arts.

<doc id="412800" wikidata="Q1639689" url="?curid=412800" title="Lydd">
<text>Lydd is a town and electoral ward in Kent, England, lying on Romney Marsh. It is one of the larger settlements on the marsh, and the most southerly town in Kent. Lydd reached the height of its prosperity during the 13th century, when it was a corporate member of the Cinque Ports, a &quot;limb&quot; of Romney. Located on Denge Marsh, Lydd was one of the first sandy islands to form as the bay filled in and evolved into what is now called Romney Marsh.

The parish of Lydd comprises the town of Lydd, Dungeness, Lydd-on-Sea and parts of Greatstone-on-Sea.

Notable buildings in Lydd include the Gordon house longhall, a guildhall, and a medieval courthouse. Chamberlains and churchwardens&#x27; accounts of the 15th century survive alongside the town charters.

Lydd lies to the southwest of New Romney and east of Rye.

==History==
The place-name &#x27;Lydd&#x27; is first attested in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 774, where it appears as &quot;ad Hlidum&quot;. This is the dative plural of the Old English &quot;hlid&quot; meaning &#x27;slope&#x27;.

Lydd developed as a settlement on a shingle island during the Romano-British period, when the coast at the time cut off Lydd from the mainland. 

The settlement continued into the Saxon period, when the Saxon church used Roman materials as part of its early construction. The town reached the height of its prosperity during the 13th century, when it was a &quot;corporate member&quot; of the Cinque Ports, a &quot;limb&quot; of Romney. 

Together with sites in the marsh, the town was a base for smuggling in the 18th and 19th centuries. Lydd Guildhall, which originally accommodated some prison cells, dates to 1792.

Before and during the First World War, Lydd Camp was important for artillery training and practice. Experiments with high explosives carried out on the shingle wastes around 1888 led to the invention of the explosive Lyddite. Lydd was at one time a garrison town. At one time it had an extensive narrow gauge railway network, and the area is still an important training ground for the armed forces. Nearby RAF Denge was established between the world wars. It has surviving concrete acoustic mirrors, developed during World War II to detect aircraft before radar was perfected. 

In the 20th century the hamlets of Lade and Lydd-on-Sea developed along the coast east of Lydd. They mostly consist of holiday bungalows.

===Second World War===
In September 1940, four young Dutch men landed on the coast between Hythe and Dungeness in a rowing boat. One was arrested for spying shortly after drinking at the Rising Sun pub.

On 21 October, a Dornier Do 17 ran short of fuel and was forced to land at RAF Lydd. The German pilot had been confused in his bearings whilst attempting to return to France. He had been using the recently invented equipment devised to interrupt the homing beams sent from Germany to guide such planes. The Dornier was the first example of this new type of bomber to fall into the hands of British Intelligence. RAF Lydd was situated north of the town. Only one Nissen hut now remains of the complex.

A Vickers Wellington bomber had the misfortune to crash-land on 26 June on returning from a 1,500-plane attack on Bremen. The 19-year-old pilot got the plane down safely near Lydd, and the crew survived the crash. They were not certain they had landed in England until rescuers came to their assistance.

On 27 November 1942, a train came under attack by two Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. The train, hauled by Southern Railway D3 number 2365, was just departing from Lydd Town railway station. The engine&#x27;s boiler was hit. The resulting jet of high pressure steam from the engine hit the plane, causing it to crash-land nearby. The German pilot was found dead, but no British railway staff or passengers were injured. The two planes had been heading over the coast after a raid on Ashford and attacking a minesweeper off Dover.

==All Saints&#x27; Church==

All Saints&#x27; Church, also known as Lydd Church or The Cathedral on the Marsh, belongs to the Diocese of Canterbury. All Saints is the longest parish church in Kent at ; it has one of the tallest towers in the county at . The church is thought to incorporate a small Romano-British basilica, possibly built in the 5th century. Most of the current fabric is medieval. 

It was associated with local fraternities or guilds in the 15th century and could seat 1,000 people at a time. Severely damaged by World War II bombing, the church was subsequently restored. In 1950 it was listed as a Grade I building.

Lydd church, with its tall tower, was a major link in the chain of trigonometric measuring points for the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790). This connected the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the Paris Observatory. This eighteenth-century survey was led by General William Roy. It included a secondary base-line for checking purposes on Romney Marsh, between Ruckinge and Dymchurch. The primary base-line was on Hounslow Heath. All Saints&#x27; Lydd was the main intermediate point on the south coast between Fairlight Down to the west and Dover Castle to the east.

==Economy==
The parish encompasses four electricity industry sites: Dungeness A &amp; B Nuclear Power Stations, a substation of the National Grid, and a former static inverter plant used by the HVDC Cross-Channel between 1961 and 1984. Dungeness A has now ceased electricity production and is in the process of being de-commissioned. The several sewers in the area include Dengemarsh Sewer, Jury&#x27;s Gut Sewer, and Scotney Petty Sewer.

==Sport==
Lydd has two football clubs, Lydd Town established in 1885, and Lydd United, established in 2009. Lydd Town play in the Kent Invicta Football League. United play in the Ashford and District Saturday League.

Lydd also has a kart/minimoto track called Lydd International Kart Circuit. Lydd Cricket Club is based at the Banks, Dennes Lane. Both the ground and pavilion belong to the Town Council.

Lydd Golf Club and Driving Range is on the Romney Road in Lydd. Apart from the 18-hole championship quality course, it boasts an 18-bay covered driving range, a 6-hole par 3 course, two chipping greens, and a putting green.

==Local media==
Lydd has two subscription newspapers, the &quot;Romney Marsh Herald&quot; (published by Kent Regional News and Media), and the &quot;Kentish Express&quot; (published by the KM Group. Free town newspapers include the &quot;Folkestone and Hythe Extra&quot;. A fortnightly publication called &quot;The Looker&quot; is published by the owners of RMFM. An aternate publication called &quot;The Marsh Mail&quot; was edited by Amanda Heath; it was published for only a couple of editions.
&quot;The Looker&quot; &#x27;has the largest circulation, comprising 15,000 copies every two weeks.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Dover TV transmitter.

The local radio station for Lydd is KMFM Shepway and White Cliffs Country. Lydd is also served by the county-wide stations Heart South, Gold, and BBC Radio Kent. 

Cinque Ports Radio 100.2FM is the community radio station for Romney Marsh and Rye. It has been broadcasting since 7 March 2022. This replaced Shoreline FM 100.2FM, which broadcast since January 2020. It is now an online service called Shoreline Easy, serving Romney Marsh, Rye, and Hythe.

==Club day==

Lydd Club Day is the annual local carnival held on the Rype. It is the largest such festival on Romney Marsh, and is held on the third Saturday of June. 

It was established in 1868. Apart from a brief cessation during the war years, it has taken place annually ever since. The day features a funfair, boot fair in the morning, stalls and children&#x27;s dressing up in the afternoon, and floats in the evening. The evening ends with a firework display and the lit up funfair, as well as the annual crowning of the Queen Elect.

On the Friday evening before Lydd Club Day, a long-standing tradition supports &quot;Test Night,when the funfair opens at reduced prices for the evening. 

In the early 2000s, &quot;Pirate Friday&quot; was instituted. Most Lydd residents have no real understanding of what this event is supposed to entail, other than Lydd&#x27;s pub frequenters dressing in pirate outfits.{citation needed|date=November 2024}} The event was created in 2006 by local residents Jason James, David Usher and Ian Parrot, and friends in the Royal Mail pub. Now an annual event, it has proved so popular that it has been adopted by every pub in Lydd. Since 2011, there has been an entrant in the evening parade of Club Day from residents who have participated in Pirate Friday.

== Railways ==
A railway line from Dungeness to Appledore formerly had stations at Lydd Town and Lydd-on-Sea. 

This operated December 1881 to 1967. It was closed then to passenger traffic. The line remains in use for freight traffic. There has been discussion to reopen the line. By being included in the Folkestone and Hythe district Local Plan, the station is protected against development that could be prejudicial to the reopening of the line from Appledore to the public. 

The Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway has two stations within the Lydd parish: Romney Sands and Dungeness.

==Airport==
Lydd Airport, originally known as Ferryfield, and now also known as London Ashford Airport, was the first airport to be constructed in Britain after the Second World War.

==Notable individuals==
David Denne (1799–1861), of the family of that name from Lydd, was an English first-class cricketer, Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for the County of Kent, and formerly Captain of the East Kent and Cinque Ports Yeomanry, and Bailiff of the town Corporation 23 times. 

Samuel Fisher (1605–1665), a noted lecturer at Lydd, resigned his lectureship to become Baptist and a Quaker. He was noted for his controversial religious views, and is notable for his book &quot;Rusticus ad Academicos: The Rusticks Alarm to the Rabbies&quot;. It is considered to anticipate some principles of modern biblical criticism. Fisher lived in Lydd from 1632 until 1660.

==Climate==
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).

<doc id="412806" wikidata="Q1677099" url="?curid=412806" title="Jack LaLanne">
<text>Francois Henri LaLanne (; September 26, 1914 – January 23, 2011), the &quot;Godfather of Fitness&quot;, was an American fitness and nutrition guru and motivational speaker. He described himself as being a &quot;sugarholic&quot; and a &quot;junk food junkie&quot; until he was 15 years old. He also had behavioral problems but &quot;turned his life around&quot; after listening to a public lecture about the benefits of good nutrition by health food pioneer Paul Bragg. During his career, he came to believe that the country&#x27;s overall health depended on the health of its population, and he referred to physical culture and nutrition as &quot;the salvation of America&quot;.

LaLanne hosted the first and longest-running nationally syndicated fitness television program, &quot;The Jack LaLanne Show,&quot; from 1951 to 1985. He published numerous books on fitness and was widely recognized for publicly preaching the health benefits of regular exercise and a good diet. He started working out with weights when they were an oddity. As early as 1936, at the age of 21, he opened the nation&#x27;s first modern health club in Oakland, California, which became a prototype for dozens of similar gyms bearing his name, later licensing them to Bally.

One of LaLanne&#x27;s 1950s television exercise programs was aimed toward women, whom he also encouraged to join his health clubs. He invented a number of exercise machines, including the pulley and leg extension devices and the Smith machine, as well as protein supplement drinks, resistance bands, and protein bars. He also popularized juicing and the jumping jack. He produced his own series of videos so viewers could be coached virtually. He pioneered coaching the elderly and disabled to exercise in order to enhance their strength and health.

LaLanne also gained recognition for his success as a bodybuilder and for his prodigious feats of strength. At the age of 70, handcuffed and shackled, he towed 70 boats, carrying a total of 70 people, a mile and a half through Long Beach Harbor. Steve Reeves credited LaLanne as his inspiration to build his muscular physique while keeping a slim waist. Arnold Schwarzenegger, as governor of California, placed him on his Governor&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness, and on the occasion of LaLanne&#x27;s death he credited LaLanne for being &quot;an apostle for fitness&quot; by inspiring &quot;billions all over the world to live healthier lives&quot;.

LaLanne was inducted into the California Hall of Fame and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
LaLanne was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Jennie (&quot;née&quot; Garaig) and Jean/John LaLanne, French immigrants from Oloron-Sainte-Marie. Both entered the US in the 1880s as young children at the Port of New Orleans. LaLanne had two older brothers, Ervil, who died in childhood (1906–1911), and Norman (1908–2005), who nicknamed him &quot;Jack&quot;. He grew up in Bakersfield, California and later moved with his family to Berkeley, California circa 1928. In 1939, his father died at the age of 58 in a San Francisco hospital, which LaLanne attributed to &quot;coronary thrombosis and cirrhosis of the liver&quot;. In his book &quot;The Jack LaLanne Way to Vibrant Health&quot;, LaLanne wrote that as a boy he was addicted to sugar and junk food. He had violent episodes directed against himself and others, describing himself as &quot;a miserable kid ... it was like hell&quot;.

Besides having a bad temper, LaLanne also suffered from headaches and bulimia, and temporarily dropped out of high school at the age of 14. The following year, aged 15, he heard health food pioneer Paul Bragg give a talk on health and nutrition, focusing on the &quot;evils of meat and sugar&quot;. Bragg&#x27;s message had a powerful influence on LaLanne, who then changed his life and started focusing on his diet and exercise. In his own words, he was &quot;born again&quot;. and besides his new focus on nutrition, he began working out daily (although while serving during World War II as a Pharmacist Mate First Class at the Sun Valley Naval Convalescent Hospital, LaLanne stated that he started in bodybuilding at &quot;age 13&quot;). Describing his change of diet, LaLanne stated, &quot;I had to take my lunch alone to the football field to eat so no one would see me eat my raw veggies, whole bread, raisins and nuts. You don&#x27;t know the crap I went through&quot;.

Writer Hal Reynolds, who interviewed LaLanne in 2008, notes that he became an avid swimmer and trained with weights; he described his introduction to weight lifting thus:

LaLanne went back to school, where he made the high school football team, and later went on to college in San Francisco where he earned a Doctor of Chiropractic degree. He studied Henry Gray&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy of the Human Body&quot; and concentrated on bodybuilding and weightlifting.

==Fitness career==
===Early wrestling career===
LaLanne won the American Athletic Foundation Wrestling Championship in 1930, the American Athletic Union medal for wrestling in 1936, and was put on the 1936 Olympic wrestling team but was taken off the team because he was “charging money for exercise” by opening a gym and thus “considered a professional”.

===Health clubs===
Arnold Schwarzenegger said of Lalanne, “It doesn’t matter where you go, there’s a health club, and it all started with Jack LaLanne.”

In 1936, he opened the nation&#x27;s first health and fitness club in Oakland, California, where he offered supervised weight and exercise training and gave nutritional advice. His primary goal was to encourage and motivate his clients to improve their overall health. Doctors, however, advised their patients to stay away from his health club, a business totally unheard of at the time, and warned their patients that &quot;LaLanne was an exercise &#x27;nut&#x27;, whose programs would make them &#x27;muscle-bound&#x27; and cause severe medical problems&quot;. LaLanne recalls the initial reaction of doctors to his promotion of weight lifting:

LaLanne designed the first leg extension machines, pulley machines using cables, weight selectors, and many other inventions, none of which he patented, that are now standard in the fitness industry. He invented the original model of what became the Smith machine. He invented resistance bands, which he marketed as the Glamour Stretcher for women and the Easy Way for men with different tensions. LaLanne encouraged women to lift weights (though at the time it was thought this would make women look masculine and unattractive), and he was the first to have a coed health club. By the 1980s, Jack LaLanne&#x27;s European Health Spas numbered more than 200. He eventually licensed all his health clubs to the Bally company, now known as Bally Total Fitness. Though not associated with any gym, LaLanne continued to lift weights until his death.

===Books, television and other media===
LaLanne presented fitness and exercise advice on television for 34 years. &quot;The Jack LaLanne Show&quot; was the longest-running television exercise program. According to the SF Chronicle TV program archives, it first began on 28 September 1953 as a 15-minute local morning program (sandwiched between the morning news and a cooking show) on San Francisco&#x27;s ABC television station, KGO-TV, with LaLanne paying for the airtime himself as a way to promote his gym and related health products. LaLanne also met his wife Elaine while she was working for the local station. In 1959, the show was picked up for nationwide syndication, and continued until 1985.

The show was noted for its minimalist set, where LaLanne inspired his viewers to use basic home objects, such as a chair, to perform their exercises along with him. Wearing his standard jumpsuit, he urged his audience &quot;with the enthusiasm of an evangelist,&quot; to get off their couch and copy his basic movements, a manner considered the forerunner of today&#x27;s fitness videos. In 1959, LaLanne recorded &quot;Glamour Stretcher Time&quot;, a workout album that provided phonograph-based instruction for exercising with an elastic cord called the Glamour Stretcher. As a daytime show, much of LaLanne&#x27;s audience were stay-at-home mothers. LaLanne&#x27;s wife Elaine LaLanne was part of the show to demonstrate the exercises and to show that doing them would not ruin the figures or musculature of women. LaLanne also included his dog Happy as a way to attract children to the show. Later in the run, another dog named Walter was used, with LaLanne claiming &quot;Walter&quot; stood for &quot;We All Love To Exercise Regularly&quot;.

LaLanne published several books and videos on fitness and nutrition, appeared in movies, and recorded a song with Connie Haines. He marketed exercise equipment, a range of vitamin supplements, and two models of electric juicers. These include the &quot;Juice Tiger&quot;, as seen on &quot;Amazing Discoveries&quot; with Mike Levey, and &quot;Jack LaLanne&#x27;s Power Juicer&quot;. It was on the show that LaLanne introduced the phrase &quot;That&#x27;s the power of the juice!&quot; However, in March 1996, 70,000 Juice Tiger juicers, 9% of all its models, were recalled after 14 injury incidents were reported. The Power Juicer is still sold in five models.

LaLanne played the role of &quot;Hercules&quot; in the Christmas television movie, &quot;The Year Without Santa Claus&quot; starring John Goodman, in 2006, his last acting role.

LaLanne celebrated his 95th birthday with the release of a new book titled &quot;Live Young Forever&quot;.

==Personal health routine==
===Diet===
One of LaLanne&#x27;s sayings was &quot;If man made it, don&#x27;t eat it.&quot;

LaLanne blamed ultra-processed foods for many health problems. For most of his life, he eschewed sugar and white flour while eating many fruits and vegetables, and he ate a mostly dairy-free and meatless diet that included lots of egg whites and fish. He also took vitamin supplements and protein supplements.

The NY Times reported in his obituary that he avoided snacks and ate two meals a day, although he once said that he ate three meals a day. His breakfast, after working out for two hours, consisted of hard-boiled egg whites, a cup of broth, oatmeal with soy milk, and seasonal fruit. Other sources say that breakfasts were homemade protein shakes: one was protein powder shake with wheat germ, brewer&#x27;s yeast, bone meal, juice, and handfuls of vitamins and minerals consisting of “100 liver-yeast tablets, 15,000 milligrams of vitamin C, 2000 units of B, some boron and some zinc, also 75 alfalfa and kelp tablets”.

Another shake LaLanne consumed consisted of egg whites and soybean with carrot juice, celery juice, and some fruit. One source reported that his lunch was four boiled egg whites, five servings of fresh fruit, plus five raw vegetables. For dinner, he and his wife typically ate a high-protein salad with egg whites along with fish (often salmon) and some wine. He did not drink coffee.

He once described his diet by saying, “ At least eight to 10 raw vegetables and three to four pieces of fresh fruit a day. I have natural grains, beans, brown rice, lentils, wheat. And I get most of my protein from fish and egg whites. I eat no meat of any kind. I drink my breakfast. Half carrot juice, half celery juice and then I put an apple and a banana in it and 50 grams of protein made out of egg whites and soybean. For lunch I’ll have three pieces of fresh fruit, three to six egg whites and whole wheat toast. And Elaine makes soup for me with vegetables but no cream or butter. Elaine and I eat out practically every night, but we have the restaurants trained. We call them that we’re coming in, and they’ll have a raw vegetable salad and I’ll have oil dressing loaded up with chopped garlic. I take my own pita bread made out of whole wheat with no salt or oils. And I’ll have a baked potato and fish.”

===Exercise===
When exercising, LaLanne worked out repetitively with weights until he experienced &quot;muscle fatigue&quot; in whatever muscle groups he was exercising, or when it became impossible for him to go on with a particular routine; this is most often referred to as &quot;training to failure&quot;. LaLanne moved from exercise to exercise without stopping. To contradict critics who thought this would leave him tightly musclebound and uncoordinated, LaLanne liked to demonstrate one-handed balancing. His home contained two gyms and a pool that he used daily.

He continued with his two-hour workouts into his 90s, which also included walking. He stated, &quot;If I died, people would say &#x27;Oh look, Jack LaLanne died. He didn&#x27;t practice what he preached.&#x27;&quot;

LaLanne summed up his philosophy about good nutrition and exercise:

&quot;Dying is easy. Living is a pain in the butt. It&#x27;s like an athletic event. You&#x27;ve got to train for it. You&#x27;ve got to eat right. You&#x27;ve got to exercise. Your health account, your bank account, they&#x27;re the same thing. The more you put in, the more you can take out. Exercise is king and nutrition is queen: together, you have a kingdom.&quot;

He said that since the average person doesn&#x27;t have the time to exercise two hours per day, he recommended 30-minute workouts, 3-4 times a week, and changing one&#x27;s routine every 2–3 weeks.

===Views on food additives and drugs===

LaLanne often stressed that artificial food additives, drugs, and processed foods contributed to making people mentally and physically ill. As a result, he writes, many people turn to alcohol and drugs to deal with symptoms of ailments, noting that &quot;a stream of aches and pains seems to encompass us as we get older&quot;. He refers to the human bloodstream as a &quot;River of Life&quot;, which is &quot;polluted&quot; by &quot;junk foods&quot; loaded with &quot;preservatives, salt, sugar, and artificial flavorings&quot;.

Relying on evidence from The President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness, he also agreed that &quot;many of our aches and pains come from lack of physical activity&quot;. As an immediate remedy for symptoms such as constipation, insomnia, tiredness, anxiety, shortness of breath, or high blood pressure, LaLanne states that people will resort to various drugs: &quot;We look for crutches such as sleeping pills, pep pills, alcohol, cigarettes, and so on.&quot;

==Family==
LaLanne was married to his second wife, Elaine Doyle LaLanne, for over five decades. They had three children: Yvonne LaLanne, a daughter from his first marriage, Dan Doyle, a son from Elaine&#x27;s first marriage, and Jon LaLanne, a son they had together. Yvonne is a chiropractor in California; Dan and Jon are involved in the family business, BeFit Enterprises, which they and their mother and sister plan to continue. Another daughter from Elaine&#x27;s first marriage, Janet Doyle, died in a car accident at age 21 in 1974.

==Death==
LaLanne often said, &quot;I can never die; that would ruin my image!&quot; He died of respiratory failure due to pneumonia at his home on January 23, 2011. He was 96. According to his family, he had been sick for a week but refused to see a doctor. They added that he had been performing his daily workout routine the day before his death. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California.

==LaLanne&#x27;s feats==

&quot;(As reported on Jack LaLanne&#x27;s website)&quot; 
* 1954 (age 40)Swam the entire length of the Golden Gate in San Francisco, under water, with of air tanks and other equipment strapped to his body; a world record.
* 1955 (age 41)Swam from Alcatraz Island to Pier 43 in San Francisco while handcuffed. When interviewed afterwards, he was quoted as saying that the worst thing about the ordeal was being handcuffed, which significantly reduced his ability to do a jumping jack.
* 1956 (age 42)Set what was claimed as a world record of 1,033 push-ups in 23 minutes on &quot;You Asked For It&quot;, a television program hosted by Art Baker.
* 1957 (age 43)Swam the Golden Gate channel while towing a cabin cruiser. The swift ocean currents turned this one-mile (1.6 km) swim into a swimming distance of .
* 1958 (age 44)Maneuvered a paddleboard nonstop from Farallon Islands to the San Francisco shore. The trip took 9.5 hours.
* 1959 (age 45)Did 1,000 push-ups and 1,000 chin-ups in 1 hour, 22 minutes, to promote &quot;The Jack LaLanne Show&quot; going nationwide. LaLanne said this was the most difficult of his stunts, but only because the skin on his hands started ripping off during the chin-ups. He felt he couldn&#x27;t stop because it would have been seen as a public failure.
* 1974 (age 60)For the second time, he swam from Alcatraz Island to Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf. Again, he was handcuffed, but this time he was also shackled and towed a boat, according to his obituary in Los Angeles Times in 2011 and his website. However, according to an account of this event published the day after it occurred in the Los Angeles Times, written by Philip Hager, a Times staff writer, LaLanne was neither handcuffed nor shackled if each of those terms has the conventional meaning of &quot;tightly binding the wrists or ankles together with a pair of metal fasteners&quot;. Hager says that LaLanne &quot;had his hands and feet bound with cords that allowed minimal freedom&quot;. But &quot;minimal&quot; clearly did not mean &quot;no&quot; freedom, since elsewhere in the article Hager describes LaLanne&#x27;s method of propulsion through the water as &quot;half-breast-stroke, half-dog paddle&quot;, which is how you swim with your hands tied.
* 1975 (age 61)Repeating his performance of 21 years earlier, he again swam the entire length of the Golden Gate Bridge, underwater and handcuffed, but this time he was shackled and towed a boat.
* 1976 (age 62)To commemorate the &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76,&quot; United States Bicentennial, he swam one mile (1.6 km) in Long Beach Harbor. He was handcuffed and shackled, and he towed 13 boats (representing the 13 original colonies) containing 76 people.
* 1979 (age 65)Towed 65 boats in Lake Ashinoko, near Tokyo, Japan. He was handcuffed and shackled, and the boats were filled with of Louisiana Pacific wood pulp.
* 1980 (age 66)Towed 10 boats in North Miami, Florida. The boats carried 77 people, and he towed them for over one mile (1.6 km) in less than one hour.
* 1984 (age 70)He towed 70 rowboats, one with several guests, from the Queen&#x27;s Way Bridge in the Long Beach Harbor to the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, 1 mile.

==Awards and honors==

On June 10, 2005, then governor Arnold Schwarzenegger launched the &quot;California Governor&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sport&quot;.

<text>Jason Thomas Mraz (; born June 23, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. He rose to prominence with the release of his debut studio album, &quot;Waiting for My Rocket to Come&quot; (2002), which spawned the single &quot;The Remedy (I Won&#x27;t Worry)&quot; that peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. His second studio album &quot;Mr. A-Z&quot; (2005) peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

His third studio album, &quot;We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.&quot; (2008), peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified four times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;I&#x27;m Yours&quot;, reached the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while spending a then-record 76 weeks on the Hot 100, and it was certified Diamond by the RIAA. The album also spawned the Grammy Award winning singles &quot;Make It Mine&quot; and &quot;Lucky&quot; with Colbie Caillat.

His fourth album, &quot;Love Is a Four Letter Word&quot; (2012), peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned the single &quot;I Won&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, which became his second top ten hit on the Hot 100. He went on to release the top ten albums &quot;Yes!&quot; (2014) and &quot;Know.&quot; (2018). After signing a three-album agreement with BMG in 2020, Mraz released the albums &quot;Look for the Good&quot; (2020) and &quot;Mystical Magical Rhythmical Radical Ride&quot; (2023).

Along with receiving two Grammy Award wins, Mraz is also the recipient of two Teen Choice Awards, a People&#x27;s Choice Award, and the Hal David Songwriters Hall of Fame Award. As of July 2014, Mraz has sold over seven million albums, and over 11.5 million in digital singles.

In 2023, Mraz competed as a contestant on season 32 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, finishing in second place, behind Xochitl Gomez.

==Early life==
Mraz was born and raised in Mechanicsville, Virginia. He is of Slovak descent through his paternal grandfather, who moved to the United States from Austria-Hungary in 1915. His surname is ; , ). His parents, Tom (Tomáš ) Mraz and June Tomes, divorced when he was five years old, leaving Mraz to live with his father while his sister lived with his mother. His father is a postal worker, and his mother is vice president at a branch of Bank of America.

While attending Lee-Davis High School, Mraz was a member of the cheerleading squad, school chorus, and drama club. He starred as Joseph in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; and as Snoopy in &quot;Snoopy! The Musical&quot;. During this period of his life, he struggled with his sexuality at times, wondering if he was gay. Mraz graduated in 1995.

After high school, Mraz attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York City for about a year and a half, originally to work in musical theater. When his roommates played guitar he would provide the vocals. Eventually, a friend gave him a guitar that was about to be thrown away and Mraz learned to play and write his own music. Mraz credits an early girlfriend as being one of the influences that drove him to songwriting. She encouraged him to write his thoughts on paper which helped him get &quot;all of the voices in my head to shut up&quot; and &quot;become something I could follow.&quot;

Mraz moved to the Shockoe Bottom neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia, where he took a series of odd jobs, including elementary-school janitor, and joined the Ashland Stage Company. Mraz then enrolled at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, on a scholarship. Instead of attending classes, he headed west on a road trip that ultimately brought him to San Diego, where he decided to stay.

==Music career==
===1999–2001: Career beginnings===
Soon after moving to San Diego in 1999, Mraz became a roadie for the band Elgin Park. He met future band member Toca Rivera at Java Joe&#x27;s, a coffee house in the Ocean Beach neighborhood of San Diego known for being formative in the careers of Jewel and Steve Poltz. Mraz performed once a week for nearly three years, building a following in San Diego and online.

Mraz self-published the albums &quot;A Jason Mraz Demonstration&quot; (1999), &quot;From the Cutting Room Floor&quot; (2001), and &quot;On Love, In Sadness (The E Minor EP in F)&quot; (2001). In 2001, Mraz released the live acoustic album &quot;Live at Java Joe&#x27;s&quot;, performing with percussionist Rivera and bassist Ian Sheridan. The album featured several songs he would later re-release, including &quot;1000 Things&quot;, &quot;You and I Both&quot;, and &quot;Halfway Home&quot;. The album was later released on iTunes, on March 11, 2008, under the title &quot;Jason Mraz: Live &amp; Acoustic 2001&quot;. Mraz returned to perform at Java Joe&#x27;s for the 15th anniversary of the album on January 29, 2016. Mraz&#x27; last self-released album was &quot;Sold Out (In Stereo)&quot;, released on March 21, 2002.

===2002–2004: &quot;Waiting for My Rocket to Come&quot;===
In late 2001, Mraz signed a recording contract with Elektra Records and moved to Los Angeles.

In 2002, Mraz opened for Jewel on her tour.

On October 15, 2002, Mraz released his first major label debut album, &quot;Waiting for My Rocket to Come&quot;, which peaked at number 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The day after the album&#x27;s release, Mraz played on &quot;The Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn&quot;. &quot;You &amp; I Both&quot; was released as a promotional single prior to the album&#x27;s release, but received minimal airplay.

In early 2003, Mraz released his first commercial single, &quot;The Remedy (I Won&#x27;t Worry)&quot;. The track was co-written by music production team The Matrix, and became Mraz&#x27;s first top-40 single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 15. The song was inspired by a high school friend who was diagnosed with cancer. At the time of the album&#x27;s release, Mraz said that he did not like &quot;The Remedy (I Won&#x27;t Worry)&quot; and had not wanted it on the album. In June 2003, &quot;You &amp; I Both&quot; was released commercially as the second single from the album. &quot;Waiting for My Rocket to Come&quot; was certified Platinum in May 2005 for selling 1 million units.

Mraz opened for Tracy Chapman in 2003 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In 2004, while on tour, Mraz released a live album with an accompanying DVD, &quot;Tonight, Not Again: Jason Mraz Live at the Eagles Ballroom&quot;. He performed with his touring band, including drummer Adam King, Rivera, Sheridan and keyboardist Eric Hinojosa, along with a guest appearance from Blues Traveler frontman John Popper.

===2005–2007: &quot;Mr. A–Z&quot;===

On July 26, 2005, Mraz released his second major label album, &quot;Mr. A–Z&quot;, produced by Steve Lillywhite for Atlantic Records. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Wordplay&quot;, was produced by Kevin Kadish, and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 5. The album earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, while Lillywhite received a nomination for Producer of the Year.

Mraz began a long-running tour in support of &quot;Mr. A–Z&quot; at the San Diego Music Awards on September 12, 2005. The tour featured several opening acts, including Bushwalla and Tristan Prettyman, with whom he had written the duet &quot;Shy That Way&quot; in 2002. Mraz opened for Alanis Morissette during her 2005 &quot;Jagged Little Pill Acoustic&quot; tour, and for the Rolling Stones on five dates during their 2005–06 world tour. In March 2006, he performed in Singapore as part of the annual Mosaic Music Festival. That May, he toured mostly small venues and music festivals in the U.S., along with a few shows in the United Kingdom and Ireland where he supported James Blunt. The tour included a May 6, 2006, acoustic show with P.O.D., Better Than Ezra, Live, and The presidents of the United States of America. Mraz was featured as a headlining guest of St. Louis&#x27;s annual Fair St. Louis and performed a free concert at the base of the Gateway Arch on July 1, 2006. During this time, Mraz was also the opening act at several dates for Rob Thomas&#x27; Something to Be Tour.

In 2005, Mraz was one of many singers featured in the fall advertisement campaign for The Gap campaign &quot;Favorites&quot;, singing a cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;One Love&quot;. 2006 saw the release of &quot;Selections for Friends&quot;, the live, online-only album recorded during the Songs for Friends Tour. In 2007, &quot;The Beauty in Ugly&quot;, an earlier track penned by Mraz originally titled &quot;Plain Jane&quot;, was rewritten for the ABC television show &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;. The song was featured as a part of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Be Ugly in &#x27;07&quot; campaign.

===2008–2011: &quot;We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.&quot;===

On May 13, 2008, Mraz released his third studio album, &quot;We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.&quot; The album debuted at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was later certified quadruple platinum. It broke into the top 10 of many international music charts. Mraz said that the album title was taken from the work of Scottish artist David Shrigley. Prior to its release, Mraz released three EPs, each with acoustic versions of songs from the album.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;I&#x27;m Yours&quot;, was written in August 2004 and was initially released in demo form on the limited edition EP &quot;Extra Credit&quot; in 2005&quot;.&quot; Through Mraz&#x27;s live performances of the song, it gained in popularity with fans. &quot;I&#x27;m Yours&quot; became Mraz&#x27;s first Top 10 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at No. 6 on September 20, 2008. It ultimately spent 76 weeks on the Hot 100, longer than any other song in the magazine&#x27;s 51-year history (a record since broken by Imagine Dragons with &quot;Radioactive&quot; in 2014). It was a major commercial success in the US and was certified 7x multi-Platinum by the RIAA for sales of over seven million. The song was also successful internationally, topping the charts in New Zealand, Norway, Portugal and Sweden, and peaking in the top ten on the charts in 11 other countries. By May 2012, it had gained over 125,000,000 hits on YouTube. It was the first song to top the charts in four different radio formats: Mainstream Top 40, Adult Contemporary, Adult Top 40 and Triple A. &quot;Make It Mine&quot; was released as the second single from the album but failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Lucky&quot; with Colbie Caillat was released as the third single from the album and peaked at number 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

At the 2009 Grammy Awards, &quot;I&#x27;m Yours&quot; was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, and &quot;We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.&quot; was nominated for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. In 2009, Mraz was awarded the Hal David Starlight Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2010, Mraz won two Grammy Awards for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance (&quot;Make It Mine&quot;) and Best Pop Collaboration (&quot;Lucky&quot; with Colbie Caillat). &quot;I&#x27;m Yours&quot; was also named ASCAP&#x27;s 2010 Song of the Year.

Mraz&#x27;s 2008 world tour traveled across the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia. His personal photo travelogue from the world tour was published as a book, titled &quot;A Thousand Things&quot; (2008). The book was launched with a photo exhibition at Charles Cowles Gallery in New York City at the end of 2008. Also in 2008, Mraz played with Eric Clapton to a crowd of 45,000 in Hyde Park, London, sold out London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, and performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo. That year, he embarked on the Music, Magic &amp; Make Peace Tour with Bushwalla, The Makepeace Brothers, and magician Justin Willman&quot;.&quot;

In 2009, Mraz recorded &quot;The Way Is Love&quot;, an unreleased Roy Orbison song, as a duet with Willie Nelson. In November 2009, he released the live CD/DVD &quot;Jason Mraz&#x27;s Beautiful Mess: Live on Earth&quot;, recorded in Chicago during the Gratitude Café tour. The following year, he went to Brazil to record &quot;Simplesmente Todo&quot; with Milton Nascimento, who sings in Portuguese while Mraz sings in English. He also did some writing with Dido and recorded new material with producer Martin Terefe. Mraz released the live EP, &quot;Life Is Good&quot; on October 5, 2010.

===2012–2013: &quot;Love Is A Four Letter Word&quot;===

Mraz released the live EP, &quot;Love Is A Four Letter Word&quot;, on February 28, 2012. His fourth studio album, &quot;Love Is a Four Letter Word&quot; was released on April 13, 2012. It reached number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and the top 20 in 10 other countries. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, debuted at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number 1 on the Digital Songs chart. It charted in 15 countries in total, and in October 2013 was certified 4x multi-platinum, for selling in excess of 4 million units. Further singles from the album were &quot;93 Million Miles&quot; and &quot;The Woman I Love&quot;, but these releases were not as successful.

&quot;Love Is a Four Letter Word&quot; was nominated for a 2012 Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. In 2012, he played sold-out shows at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, Madison Square Garden in New York and the O2 Arena in London, and performed at President Barack Obama and family&#x27;s lighting of the national Christmas tree at the White House; a noted Obama supporter, he has also performed at numerous other events involving Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.

==Personal life==
Mraz lives a health-conscious lifestyle and has said that he eats mostly raw vegan foods. His vegan diet has also influenced his music. He owns a five-and-a-half acre avocado farm in Oceanside, California. He is an investor at Café Gratitude, a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles, and named his 2011 tour Gratitude Café in its honor. His hobbies include surfing, yoga and photography.

===Relationships and sexuality===
Mraz married Sheridan Edley in 2001. They divorced the following year.

Mraz was engaged to singer-songwriter and long-time close friend Tristan Prettyman on Christmas Eve 2010; they broke off the engagement six months later.

On October 25, 2015, Mraz married Christina Carano in a private ceremony in his hometown of Mechanicsville, Virginia. On June 22, 2023, Mraz announced that he and Carano had divorced.

In June 2018, Mraz penned a &quot;love letter&quot; to the LGBT community, as part of a &quot;Billboard&quot; feature during gay pride month. A line in the poem, &quot;I am bi your side. / All ways&quot; led some media reports to state that the poem represented Mraz&#x27;s coming out as bisexual. In an article published on July 19, 2018, by &quot;Billboard&quot;, Mraz said he has had previous experiences with men, even while dating Carano. Mraz said Carano defined him as a &quot;two-spirit&quot;, a description that was criticized by some as misappropriating a word originally coined for the Native American population, arguing that it distorted the term&#x27;s meaning.

===Social activism and philanthropy===

Mraz is a social activist whose philanthropic efforts span wide-ranging issues, including environmentalism, human rights, and LGBT equality.

In 2003, after learning one of his beer bottles was listed for sale on eBay, Mraz was inspired to auction off items of his wardrobe online, raising money for the Make a Wish Foundation.

During early tours, he encouraged his fans to drop off food items as they arrived at the venue, an effort to support local food banks.

In 2009, he participated in a rescue mission to Ghana with members of Free the Slaves, a global nonprofit working to liberate children sold into slavery. In 2012, he was featured on the cover of &quot;Instinct&quot; magazine in recognition of his efforts in support of LGBT rights.

The Jason Mraz Foundation was established in 2011, with a mission to support charities in the areas of human equality, environment preservation and education. Organizations supported by the foundation include VH1&#x27;s Save The Music Foundation, MusiCares, Surfrider Foundation, Free the Children, Life Rolls On, the School of the Performing Arts in the Richmond Community, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the True Colors Fund, which promotes LGBT equality.

Mraz was named the 2010 Surf Industry Manufacturers Association (SIMA) Humanitarian of the Year. He also received the Clean Water Award in 2010 from the Surfrider Foundation, for helping to preserve the world&#x27;s oceans and beaches. That same year, he teamed up with The Nature Conservancy and created a PSA using his song &quot;I&#x27;m Yours&quot; to raise awareness about the nonprofit organization&#x27;s efforts to protect the earth.

On December 16, 2012, Mraz headlined the Milestone Concert in Myanmar to raise awareness about human trafficking, making him the first foreign artist to play an open-air concert in Myanmar. The concert was organized by MTV EXIT and held in the People&#x27;s Square in Yangon, with over 70,000 people in attendance, as part of an initiative to raise awareness about human trafficking in Myanmar. Also in 2012, Mraz spent a week in Antarctica with a group of environmentalists, scientists and researchers on a mission led by Al Gore, to learn about the effects of climate change.

Mraz is a continued supporter of WhyHunger, a grassroots support organization dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty in the United States. The organization was founded by late musician Harry Chapin and Radio DJ Bill Ayres in 1975.

On June 19, 2020, Mraz announced he would be donating all profits from his album &quot;Look for the Good&quot; to Black Lives Matter and other organizations working toward equality and justice.

===Politics===
On October 24, 2019, Mraz endorsed Bernie Sanders for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries stating, &quot;Bernie is the perfect candidate to follow Trump &amp; continue to shake up the system for the benefit of true American values: Life, Liberty &amp; The Pursuit of Happiness&quot;.

<doc id="412808" wikidata="Q234994" url="?curid=412808" title="Jennifer Granholm">
<text>Jennifer Mulhern Granholm (born February 5, 1959) is a Canadian-born American politician who was the 16th United States secretary of energy from 2021 to 2025. A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the 47th governor of Michigan from 2003 to 2011 and as the 51st attorney general of Michigan from 1999 to 2003, the first woman to hold either office.

Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Granholm moved to California at age four. She obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1984 and a Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1987. She then clerked for Judge Damon Keith of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, became an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan in 1991, and was appointed to the Wayne County Corporation Counsel in 1995.

In 1998, Granholm ran for attorney general of Michigan, defeating Republican nominee John Smietanka. She ran for governor of Michigan in 2002 and was elected the state&#x27;s first female governor. She was re-elected in 2006.

Granholm was a member of the presidential transition team for Barack Obama before he assumed office in 2009. After leaving public office, Granholm took a position at the UC Berkeley and, with her husband Daniel Mulhern, wrote &quot;A Governor&#x27;s Story: The Fight for Jobs and America&#x27;s Future&quot;, released in 2011. She became host of &quot;The War Room with Jennifer Granholm&quot;. In 2017, she was hired as a CNN political contributor.

After President-elect Joe Biden announced his intention to nominate Granholm to head the United States Department of Energy in 2020, she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2021.

==Early life and education==
Granholm was born February 5, 1959, in Vancouver, British Columbia, to Shirley Alfreda (née Dowden) and Victor Ivar Granholm, both bank tellers. Granholm&#x27;s maternal grandparents came from Ireland and Newfoundland, respectively. Her paternal grandfather was Hugo &quot;Anders&quot; Granholm, who immigrated to Penny, British Columbia, Canada, in the late 1920s from Robertsfors, Sweden, where his father was the mayor. The former Minister for Enterprise and Energy and former Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, Maud Olofsson, lives in Robertsfors, and when the two met in Sweden, the media revealed that Olofsson&#x27;s husband is a relative of Granholm. Her paternal grandmother was Judith Olivia Henriette (Solstad) Granholm, an emigrant from Gjerstad in Southern Norway. She came with the ship SS &quot;Bergensfjord&quot; from Oslo to Halifax, and from there she took the railway to Penny, British Columbia, where her uncles and several others had established a small logging village.

Granholm&#x27;s family immigrated to California when she was four years old. She grew up in Anaheim, San Jose, and San Carlos. Granholm attended Ida Price Junior High and Del Mar High School before graduating from San Carlos High School in 1977 and won the Miss San Carlos beauty pageant. As a young adult, she attempted to launch a Hollywood acting career but abandoned her efforts at age 21. In 1978, she appeared on &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, and held jobs as a tour guide at Universal Studios and in customer service at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and was the first female tour guide at Marine World Africa USA in Redwood City, piloting boats with 25 tourists aboard.

In 1980, at age 21, she became a naturalized U.S. citizen, and worked for John B. Anderson&#x27;s campaign for president of the United States as an Independent in the 1980 election. She then enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, the first person in her family to attend college. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated in 1984 with a B.A. in political science and French. During a year in France, she helped to smuggle clothes and medical supplies to Jewish people in the Soviet Union and became involved in the Anti-Apartheid Movement. She then earned a Juris Doctor degree at Harvard University, also with honors, in 1987. At Harvard Law School, Granholm served as editor-in-chief of the &quot;Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review&quot;.

==Early career==
After graduating from Harvard Law School, Granholm clerked for Judge Damon Keith, a senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, from 1987 to 1988. She also worked for the Michael Dukakis 1988 presidential campaign. After working as an attorney in the Wayne County executive office from 1989 to 1991, Granholm became an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan in 1991. She helped to prosecute drug dealers, gang members and child pornographers, sued the state and fought against credit card fraud. Of the 154 people Granholm tried, 151 were convicted. In 1995, she was appointed as Corporation Counsel for Wayne County, the youngest person to hold the position. Granholm defended the county against lawsuits, sued the state over road taxes, and fought to uphold environmental laws.

==Michigan Attorney General (1999–2003)==

===1998 election===
Thirty-seven-year Democratic Attorney General Frank J. Kelley chose not to run for a 10th term in 1998 and Granholm entered the race to succeed him. Unopposed for the Democratic nomination, she faced Republican John Smietanka, the 1994 nominee and former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Michigan, in the general election. The campaign began as a relatively friendly one, with both agreeing that they wanted to expand the Internet Crimes Unit, start neighborhood-based crime-fighting programmes and continue working as a consumer advocate, as Kelley had done.

However, the race turned bitter in mid-September, when Smietanka ran television ads that called Granholm an &quot;inexperienced&quot; and &quot;dangerous&quot; liberal. He also tried to link Granholm to Democratic gubernatorial nominee Geoffrey Fieger&#x27;s crime plan, which called for greater emphasis on rehabilitation for non-violent criminals and shortening their prison terms. Granholm, who had disavowed Fieger&#x27;s crime plan the day it was released, said the claim was &quot;a lie, just a lie&quot; and that as attorney general, &quot;you are the person who is to protect the consumer from deceitful ads.&quot; Asked what separated her from Smietanka, Granholm replied, &quot;Besides honesty?&quot; Kelley also came to Granholm&#x27;s defense, starring in an advertisement where he called Smietanka&#x27;s ads &quot;garbage&quot; and a &quot;con&quot; and accused him of running a &quot;dishonest campaign&quot;. For his part, Smietanka was angered by Democratic advertisements that referred to late child support payments he had made and claimed that he had lied about how much of his own money he donated to his campaign.

After a close race, with polls showing the two candidates with virtually identical votes, Granholm defeated Smietanka by 1,557,310 votes (52.09%) to 1,432,604 (47.91%). After Granholm was elected governor in 2002, arguments arose between Smietanka and then-Republican Governor John Engler about who was most responsible for Granholm&#x27;s meteoric rise in Michigan politics. Smietanka blamed Engler for trying to force him out of the 1998 race in favor of G. Scott Romney, for dredging up the issue of his missed child support payments and for not supporting him more fully after he defeated Romney at the Republican convention. Engler countered that Smietanka was a weak candidate who should have stepped aside for Romney, who would have beaten the inexperienced Granholm; she would then not have had a launch pad for her gubernatorial campaign in 2002.

===Tenure===
Granholm was sworn into office on January 1, 1999, becoming the first female attorney general of Michigan. She served a single term, from 1999 to 2003. In office, she continued Kelley&#x27;s work on protecting citizens and consumers&#x27; rights and established Michigan&#x27;s first High Tech Crime Unit, appointing Terrence Berg as its first chief.

In April 1999, Granholm announced a lawsuit against RVP Development, builders of the Arcadia Bluffs Golf Course, alleging that poor construction of the course had led to illegal discharges of sediment into Lake Michigan from erosion following heavy storms in 1998, which had &quot;turned a ravine into a ravaged gorge&quot;. Development company President Richard Postma refused to pay the $425,000 of state fines, saying he had made moves to stop the erosion and accused Granholm of trying to make him &quot;a poster child for her campaign of the future&quot;. Granholm responded that his &quot;perception of the political landscape in Michigan is as poor as his ability to construct a golf landscape&quot;. After years of negotiations and legal wrangling, the lawsuit was settled in August 2003, with RVP Development agreeing to pay a $125,000 fine.

During her tenure as Attorney General, Granholm became a harsh critic of the annual tradition at The University of Michigan called the Naked Mile. Through her efforts, the event was essentially cancelled by April 2000 never to emerge again. In July 2000, Granholm&#x27;s office settled with J.C. Penney after the retailer made numerous pricing and scanning errors in stores in Michigan. The issue came to the attention of the attorney general&#x27;s office after a &quot;repeat and progressively worse error rate&quot; that saw 33% of items sold in December 1999 being sold for more at the register than they were listed for on the shelves. J.C. Penney paid a fine and agreed to designate &quot;pricing associates&quot; to monitor for errors in pricing.

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Granholm directed state agencies to work with lawmakers in keeping the fight against terrorism within the powers of the state. She also imposed a regulation on gasoline dealers to keep them from raising prices dramatically, something which occurred sporadically across Michigan immediately following the attacks. In February 2002, Granholm announced that her office was joining with the AARP Michigan State Office to help consumers fight calls from telemarketers.

==Governor of Michigan (2003–2011)==

===2002 election===

In the 2002 election, incumbent Republican governor John Engler was term-limited and not able to run for re-election to a fourth term in office. The Republicans unified around Engler&#x27;s lieutenant governor, Dick Posthumus. Meanwhile, Granholm faced a competitive primary against former U.S. Ambassador to Canada and governor James Blanchard and U.S. Representative and former House Minority Whip David E. Bonior. Blanchard had been defeated for reelection by Engler in 1990 and Bonior had resigned as Democratic whip to run for governor, his House district having been redrawn to make it all but unwinnable for him.

Granholm, seen by many as a &quot;fresh face&quot; after the 12-year Engler administration, raised more money than Blanchard and Bonior and consistently led them in polls by large margins. Her campaign led to increased turnout among women and she comfortably won the Democratic primary with 499,129 votes (47.69%) to Bonior&#x27;s 292,958 (27.99%) and Blanchard&#x27;s 254,586 (24.32%).

Granholm was the heavy favorite in the general election, boasting strong support from working women, African-Americans and voters under 30 years of age. She campaigned on her record on crime and was seen as more charismatic than Posthumus. Despite the 2002 elections being a good year for Republicans nationwide, who gained control of the U.S. Senate and increased their hold on the U.S. House, Granholm defeated Posthumus by 1,633,796 votes (51.42%) to 1,506,104 (47.40%).

===First term (2003–2007)===

Granholm was sworn in as the 47th governor of the state of Michigan on January 1, 2003. Upon her inauguration, in addition to becoming the state&#x27;s first female governor, she also became its third governor who was not a natural-born citizen of the United States and its fourth who was not born within the United States. The earlier two non-natural-born citizens were Fred M. Warner, who was born in England and was the 26th governor from 1905 to 1911; and John Swainson, who was also born in Canada and was the 42nd governor from 1961 to 1963. George W. Romney, who was born in Mexico and was the 27th governor from 1963 to 1969, was a natural-born citizen by virtue of his parents&#x27; U.S. citizenship at the time of his birth.

Granholm emphasized Michigan&#x27;s need to attract young people and businesses via the Cool Cities Initiative. As governor, she was a member of the National Governors Association, chairing its Health and Human Services Committee and co‑chairing its Health Care Task Force. She is also a former chair of the Midwestern Governors Association. She lived in the official Michigan Governor&#x27;s Residence, located near the Capitol Building.

During Granholm&#x27;s first year in office, she made a significant number of budget cuts to deal with a $1.7billion deficit (about two percent of the annual state budget). She was upset by proposals to cut state funding to social welfare programs, such as homeless shelters and mental health agencies.

Granholm has been a proponent of education reform since the first year of her term. In her first State of the State Address in 2003, Granholm announced Project Great Start to focus on reforming education for children from birth to age five. Project Great Start has coordinated public and private efforts to encourage educating new parents and encouraging parents to read to their children.
Granholm emphasized post-secondary education for Michiganders following the decline in Michigan manufacturing jobs, many of which did not require a college degree. In 2004 she asked Lieutenant Governor John D. Cherry to lead the Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth to double the number of college graduates in Michigan. Many of the commission&#x27;s recommendations were enacted into law during Granholm&#x27;s tenure as governor, e.g. increasing high school graduation standards (The Michigan Merit Curriculum) so that every Michigan high school student takes a college preparatory curriculum, which includes four years of math and English/language arts and three years of science and social studies, beginning with students who entered high school in the fall of 2006.

At an awards ceremony on October 28, 2004, Granholm was inducted into the &quot;Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame&quot;. She has also been the recipient of the Michigan Jaycees 1999 &quot;Outstanding Young Michiganders&quot; and the YWCA &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; awards.

During the 2004 presidential election in Michigan, Granholm campaigned hard for Democratic nominee John Kerry after early polls showed President George W. Bush with a narrow lead. She cited the economy as the main concern for Michiganders, not the Iraq War or the War on Terror, which meant that with &quot;the deficit larger; the Dow dropping; unemployment claims up, hitting an all-time high; General Motors profits below expectations, with health claims crippling profits; flu vaccine in short supply; oil prices rising&quot; her state was badly hit.

In February 2005, Michigan&#x27;s Republican-dominated legislature refused to vote on Granholm&#x27;s proposed state budget, citing concerns over cuts to state funding for higher education. In the previous years of Granholm&#x27;s term, many cuts to higher education had been demanded and voted in the legislature in order to balance the state budget. The year before, Republican leaders had called Granholm a &quot;do‑nothing governor&quot;, claiming that she failed to lead, while Democrats accused legislative Republicans of being obstructionist. In January 2005, Granholm presented an early budget proposal, demanded immediate response from the Legislature, and held a press conference outlining the highlights of the proposed budget. After refusing to consider, debate, or vote on the proposed budget, Republicans stated they would prefer that the legislature have more involvement in the formation of the state budget.

Michigan&#x27;s economy had been losing jobs since 2000, largely owing to the decline in the American manufacturing sector. Granholm supported diversification of Michigan&#x27;s economy away from its historical reliance on automotive manufacturing. She pushed through a $2billion 21st Century Jobs Fund to attract jobs to Michigan in the life sciences, alternative energy, advanced manufacturing, and homeland security sectors.

===2006 election===

Granholm ran for a second term in the 2006 election. Her opponent was Republican businessman and politician Dick DeVos.

Both the Granholm campaign and the Michigan Democratic Party put out television commercials produced by Joe Slade White focusing on her efforts to revive Michigan&#x27;s economy and accusing DeVos of cutting Michigan jobs while he was head of what was then called Amway. Granholm won re-election, defeating DeVos. The election results were 56 percent for Granholm, 42 percent for DeVos, and a little over one percent for minor-party candidates Gregory Creswell, Douglas Campbell, and Bhagwan Dashairya. Granholm&#x27;s share of the vote was 4.9 percent higher than in her first gubernatorial election in 2002. Granholm&#x27;s campaign was managed by Howard Edelson.

===Second term (2007–2011)===
The 2006 elections saw a return to power by the Democrats in the State House of Representatives and the retention of Republican control over the State Senate. The partisan division of power in Michigan&#x27;s state government led to a showdown between Granholm and lawmakers over the FY 2008 state budget that resulted in a four-hour shutdown of nonessential state services in the early morning of October 1, 2007, until a budget was passed and signed. The budget cut services, froze state spending in areas such as the arts, increased the state income tax, and created a new set of service taxes on a variety of businesses, e.g. ski lifts and interior design and landscaping companies, to address a state budget shortfall. As a result of the controversial budget, some taxpayer and business advocates called for a recall campaign against Granholm and lawmakers who voted for the tax increases.

The budget crisis eventually led Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s to downgrade Michigan&#x27;s credit rating from AA to AA−. Additionally, the crisis contributed to sinking approval ratings for Granholm, which went from 43 percent in August 2007 to a low of 32 percent in December 2007. She had one of the lowest approval ratings for any governor in the United States.

In 2007 Granholm proposed and signed into law the No Worker Left Behind Act to provide two years of free training or community college for unemployed and displaced workers. Since its launch in August 2007, more than 130,000 people have enrolled in retraining. The program caps tuition assistance at $5000 per year for two years, or $10,000 per person, and covers retraining in high-demand occupations and emerging industries.

The Department of Energy, Labor, and Economic Growth reported back in October 2009 that 62,206 people had enrolled and that of the 34,355 who had completed training, 72% had found work or retained their positions and a further 18,000 were still in long-term or short-term training. 16% of all enrollees had withdrawn or failed to complete the training. As of July 2010, more than two years after the program was launched, 65,536 people were in training or involved in on-the-job training. Dropouts had been reduced to 13.1% of enrollments.

Granholm delivered her sixth State of the State address on January 29, 2008. The speech focused mainly on creating jobs in Michigan through bringing alternative energy companies to Michigan. Through passing a renewable portfolio standard, which would require that ten percent of Michigan&#x27;s energy would come from renewable sources by 2015 and twenty-five percent by 2025, Granholm expected the alternative energy industry to emerge in Michigan. Since the passage of the standard, Mariah Power, Global Wind Systems, Cascade Swift Turbine, Great Lakes Turbine, and 38 other companies have announced new projects in Michigan. The solar and wind power industries now provide more than ten thousand jobs in Michigan.

Granholm also called in the speech for an incentive package to offer tax breaks to filmmakers who shoot in Michigan and use local crews in production. A package of bills offering film industry incentives was approved by both houses of the Michigan legislature and signed into law by Granholm on April 7, 2008.
Partly because of pressure from Granholm, Michigan&#x27;s Democratic presidential primary was moved up to January 15, leading the Democratic National Committee to strip the Michigan Democratic Party of its delegates (Michigan historically had held its caucuses on February 9). Granholm has been named by some as a possible candidate for United States attorney general. She was the policy chair of the Democratic Governors Association.

On April 29, 2008, Granholm had emergency surgery to fix a health issue that stemmed from a 1993 accident. Because of the surgery, Granholm had to postpone a trip to Israel and Kuwait. She finally made the journey in November 2008 and signed a water technology partnership agreement with the Israeli government. In addition, she delivered the keynote address at an automotive event organized by the Michigan Israel Business Bridge and the Israel Export Institute.

In response to a May 14, 2008 resolution by the Detroit City Council that Granholm remove Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick from office because of eight (later ten) felony counts against him, Granholm began an inquiry that culminated in a removal hearing on September 3, 2008. On September 3, Granholm outlined the legal basis for the hearings, arguments were made, and three witnesses were called. On the morning of September 4, Kilpatrick agreed to two plea deals in which he pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury and no contest one count of assaulting and obstructing a police officer in two separate cases. Both deals required his resignation. When the hearing reconvened later that day, Granholm said the hearing would be adjourned until September 22 as a result of the plea deals, and if Kilpatrick&#x27;s resignation became effective before then the hearing would be cancelled.

In September 2008, Governor Granholm undertook the role of Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin in a series of practice debates with Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden.

With the election of Barack Obama as president, Granholm joined his economic advisory team, having had extensive experience running the Michigan economy, and there was speculation that she might join the Obama administration. On May 13, 2009, the Associated Press reported that President Obama was considering Granholm, among others, for possible appointment to the United States Supreme Court. Eventually Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor.

In 2010, Granholm was barred from seeking re-election due to Michigan&#x27;s term limits law. Her governorship ended on January 1, 2011, when Republican Rick Snyder, who won the 2010 election, was sworn in.

==Subsequent career==

Granholm is a distinguished adjunct professor of law and public policy at the UC Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy and UC Berkeley School of Law. In the Autumn of 2011, she taught a graduate course entitled &quot;Governing in Tough Times&quot;. She is also a senior research fellow at the Berkeley Energy and Climate Institute (BECI). As a senior advisor to The Pew Charitable Trusts&#x27; Clean Energy Program and founder of The American Jobs Project at UC Berkeley, Granholm spearheads a campaign for a national clean energy policy that promotes and funds American energy independence and home-grown manufacturing and innovation for wind, solar, and advanced battery industries across the United States. She is a regular contributor to NBC&#x27;s political talk show &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, has written on U.S. energy policy and has co-authored a book with her husband, &quot;A Governor&#x27;s Story: The Fight For Jobs and America&#x27;s Economic Future&quot;, which was released in September 2011 and was about the lessons Michigan&#x27;s experience can offer to America.

Granholm served on the board of directors of the Dow Chemical Company from March to October 2011. In May 2011, she joined the board of directors of Marinette Marine Corporation, a Wisconsin ship builder and Defense contractor. Granholm is currently serving as the sponsor of , a warship under construction by the company. In August 2013, she joined the board of Talmer Bancorp, a Michigan financial institution, remaining on the board until the bank was sold in September 2016. In August 2016, she joined the board of ChargePoint, a corporation which manages a network of electric vehicle charging stations. In March 2017, Granholm also joined the board of Proterra, a manufacturer of electric buses and charging stations.

In October 2011, Current TV announced that she would be joining its new political primetime lineup as host of the new program &quot;The War Room with Jennifer Granholm&quot;. In January 2013, she announced that she was leaving the network due to the sale to Al Jazeera.

In October 2012, she became a &quot;household name&quot; after delivering what has been described as a &quot;hyperactive&quot; and &quot;sharp-tongued&quot; speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, on September 6. Granholm&#x27;s speech centered on the automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010; specifically, President Obama&#x27;s decision to bail out General Motors and Chrysler, its beneficial effects on the U.S. economy, and Mitt Romney&#x27;s opposition to the bailout.

In January 2014, she was picked to co-chair Priorities USA Action opposite Jim Messina. She has previously said Hillary Clinton &quot;is the strongest candidate out there should she decide to raise her hand&quot; in regard to the upcoming 2016 presidential election. Granholm previously supported Clinton over Barack Obama in the 2008 election campaign. She considered running for the United States Senate in 2014 to replace retiring Democrat Carl Levin, but decided against doing so.

In August 2015, months after Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign announcement for the 2016 presidential election, Granholm transitioned from Priorities USA Action to Correct the Record, another Clinton-aligned political committee whose classification allows Granholm to serve as a direct &quot;surrogate&quot; for Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail. In August 2016, Granholm was named by Clinton to the team planning for her potential presidential transition.

===Speculation of a return to office===
Granholm was twice mentioned as a possible U.S. Secretary of Energy, first in December 2008 when President-elect Obama was assembling his first-term Cabinet and again in December 2010, when it was rumored that Secretary Steven Chu might resign.

Granholm was also twice considered by President Obama to be a potential Supreme Court candidate. In May 2009, she was on the shortlist of candidates to replace the retiring Associate Justice David Souter. She attended a CAFE standards meeting at the White House on May 19 and spoke with Obama, but officials would not comment on whether the two discussed a potential court appointment. Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor, who was confirmed by the Senate in August. After the retirement of Associate Justice John Paul Stevens in May 2010, Granholm was again spoken of as a potential candidate; Obama chose Elena Kagan, who was confirmed in August.

In March 2011, with Tim Kaine poised to resign as chairman of the Democratic National Committee to run for the U.S. Senate from Virginia in 2012, Granholm was mentioned as a potential successor. However, she made clear early on that she was not interested, which was reported to have &quot;stunned&quot; senior Democrats, who were &quot;surprised and disappointed&quot; that Granholm had taken herself out of the running. U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida was elected instead.

After President Obama was re-elected in 2012, Granholm was reportedly considered for a position in Obama&#x27;s second-term Cabinet, specifically to succeed Chu as secretary of energy, Ray LaHood as U.S. secretary of transportation, Hilda Solis as U.S. secretary of labor or Eric Holder as U.S attorney general. Granholm herself dampened such speculation, citing her sharp criticism of Republicans during the 2012 election and her time presenting on Current TV.

In March 2013, Michigan&#x27;s senior U.S. senator, Democrat Carl Levin, announced that he would not run for a seventh term in 2014. Granholm was mentioned as a candidate to succeed him, but she announced shortly after that she would not run. She endorsed U.S. Representative Gary Peters, who defeated Republican nominee Terri Lynn Land in the general election.

In September 2014, when U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intention to step down, there was speculation that Granholm might be a potential candidate to succeed him. Loretta Lynch was ultimately nominated and confirmed for the position.

There was speculation that Granholm&#x27;s increased visibility from her senior role in the Clinton campaign indicated that she would be under consideration for a position in the U.S. Cabinet or Democratic National Committee leadership if Clinton had won the 2016 election.

==Secretary of Energy (2021–2025)==
===Nomination and confirmation===
Then-President-elect Joe Biden nominated Granholm to be the next secretary of energy. Granholm was seen as one of Biden&#x27;s least controversial nominees, winning support from unions, environmental groups, and some Republicans. University of California, Berkeley professor of energy Daniel Kammen, who worked with Granholm at UC Berkeley, said she will be &quot;phenomenal for DOE&quot; because &quot;she understands the technology, she understands deployment and she knows how to run a big agency.&quot; She appeared before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on January 27, 2021, and the committee voted to advance her nomination in a 13–4 vote on February 3, 2021. She was confirmed by the Senate 64–35 on February 25, 2021, and was sworn into office later that day by Vice President Kamala Harris. She is the first secretary of energy born outside the United States.

===Tenure===

In April 2021, she said President Joe Biden &quot;has a goal of getting to net zero carbon dioxide for this country by 2050. And that means that we have got to figure out ways to clean up our fossil fuel industry.&quot; On May 19, 2022, the Department of Energy announced a $3.5 billion program funded under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to create four large-scale regional direct air capture hubs each consisting of a network of carbon dioxide removal projects.

Granholm had a call with Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud. They discussed closer cooperation in the energy field. In late 2021, she blamed the OPEC oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia and the U.S. gas and petroleum industry for rising fuel prices in the United States. When asked what her plans were to increase oil production in the United States, she laughingly replied: &quot;That is hilarious. Would that I had the magic wand on this.&quot;

Granholm signed a detailed ethics agreement for the top energy government job and has since then, violated certain provisions of the STOCK Act.

On December 16, 2022, Granholm posthumously cleared J. Robert Oppenheimer, American theoretical physicist, often credited as the &quot;father of the atomic bomb&quot; for his role in the Manhattan Project – the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons, of the 1954 revocation of his security clearance due to a &quot;flawed investigation&quot;.

==Personal life==
While Granholm was at Harvard, she met fellow law student and Michigan native Daniel Mulhern, a theology graduate from Yale University. They married in 1986 and they took each other&#x27;s surname as their middle names. They have three children.

On October 21, 2010, Granholm was made a Commander of the Royal Order of the Polar Star, First Class, by the King of Sweden &quot;for her work in fostering relations between Michigan and Sweden to promote a clean energy economy.&quot;

Granholm is Catholic. She converted to Catholicism while at Harvard Law School.

<text>Endometrial cancer is a cancer that arises from the endometrium (the lining of the uterus or womb). It is the result of the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.
Approximately 40% of cases are related to obesity. Endometrial cancer is also associated with excessive estrogen exposure, high blood pressure and diabetes. Whereas taking estrogen alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer, taking both estrogen and a progestogen in combination, as in most birth control pills, decreases the risk. Between two and five percent of cases are related to genes inherited from the parents. Endometrial cancer is sometimes called &quot;uterine cancer&quot;, although it is distinct from other forms of cancer of the uterus such as cervical cancer, uterine sarcoma, and trophoblastic disease. The most frequent type of endometrial cancer is endometrioid carcinoma, which accounts for more than 80% of cases. Endometrial cancer is commonly diagnosed by endometrial biopsy or by taking samples during a procedure known as dilation and curettage. A pap smear is not typically sufficient to show endometrial cancer. Regular screening in those at normal risk is not called for.
The leading treatment option for endometrial cancer is abdominal hysterectomy (the total removal by surgery of the uterus), together with removal of the Fallopian tubes and ovaries on both sides, called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In more advanced cases, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy may also be recommended. If the disease is diagnosed at an early stage, the outcome is favorable, and the overall five-year survival rate in the United States is greater than 80%.
In 2012, endometrial cancers newly occurred in 320,000 women and caused 76,000 deaths. This makes it the third most common cause of death in cancers which only affect women, behind ovarian and cervical cancer. It is more common in the developed world and is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract in developed countries. Rates of endometrial cancer have risen in a number of countries between the 1980s and 2010. This is believed to be due to the increasing number of elderly people and increasing rates of obesity. 

==Signs and symptoms==
Vaginal bleeding or spotting in women after menopause occurs in 90% of endometrial cancer. Bleeding is especially common with adenocarcinoma, occurring in two-thirds of all cases. Abnormal menstrual cycles or extremely long, heavy, or frequent episodes of bleeding in women before menopause may also be a sign of endometrial cancer.

Symptoms other than bleeding are not common. Other symptoms include thin white or clear vaginal discharge in postmenopausal women. More advanced disease shows more obvious symptoms or signs that can be detected on a physical examination. The uterus may become enlarged or the cancer may spread, causing lower abdominal pain or pelvic cramping. Painful sexual intercourse or painful or difficult urination are less common signs of endometrial cancer. The uterus may also fill with pus (pyometrea). Of women with these less common symptoms (vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, and pus), 10–15% have cancer.

==Risk factors==
Risk factors for endometrial cancer include obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, use of tamoxifen, never having had a child, late menopause, high levels of estrogen, and increasing age. Immigration studies (migration studies), which examine the change in cancer risk in populations moving between countries with different rates of cancer, show that there is some environmental component to endometrial cancer. These environmental risk factors are not well characterized. It is found that adiposity is associated with the earlier diagnosis of EC, particularly the endometrioid subtype.

===Hormones===
Most of the risk factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An estimated 40% of cases are thought to be related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation, and exposes the endometrium continuously to high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, type II diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for Type I endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.

Estrogen replacement therapy during menopause when not balanced (or &quot;opposed&quot;) with progestin is another risk factor. Higher doses or longer periods of estrogen therapy have higher risks of endometrial cancer. Women of lower weight are at greater risk from unopposed estrogen. A longer period of fertility—either from an early first menstrual period or late menopause—is also a risk factor. Unopposed estrogen raises an individual&#x27;s risk of endometrial cancer by 2–10 fold, depending on weight and length of therapy. In trans men who take testosterone and have not had a hysterectomy, the conversion of testosterone into estrogen via androstenedione may lead to a higher risk of endometrial cancer. Higher circulating testosterone levels in women have also been identified as an independent endometrial cancer risk factor.

===Genetics===

Genetic disorders can also cause endometrial cancer. Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2–10% of endometrial cancer cases. Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer, also causes endometrial cancer, especially before menopause. Women with Lynch syndrome have a 40–60% risk of developing endometrial cancer, higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before colon cancer, on average, 11 years before. Carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 or MLH2: genes that participate in the process of mismatch repair, which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also mismatch repair genes. Women with Lynch syndrome represent 2–3% of endometrial cancer cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, women with Lynch syndrome have different risks of endometrial cancer. With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.

Women with a family history of endometrial cancer are at higher risk. Two genes most commonly associated with some other women&#x27;s cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2, do not cause endometrial cancer. There is an apparent link with these genes but it is attributable to the use of tamoxifen, a drug that itself can cause endometrial cancer, in breast and ovarian cancers. The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause endometrial cancer. Women with this disorder have a 5–10% lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer, compared to the 2–3% risk for unaffected women.

Common genetic variation has also been found to affect endometrial cancer risk in large-scale genome-wide association studies. Sixteen genomic regions have been associated with endometrial cancer and the common variants explain up to 7% of the familial relative risk.

===Other health problems===
Some therapies for other forms of cancer increase the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer, which is a baseline 2–3%. Tamoxifen, a drug used to treat estrogen-positive breast cancers, has been associated with endometrial cancer in approximately 0.1% of users, particularly older women, but the benefits for survival from tamoxifen generally outweigh the risk of endometrial cancer. A one to two-year course of tamoxifen approximately doubles the risk of endometrial cancer, and a five-year course of therapy quadruples that risk. Raloxifene, a similar drug, did not raise the risk of endometrial cancer. Previously having ovarian cancer is a risk factor for endometrial cancer, as is having had previous radiotherapy to the pelvis. Specifically, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and thecomas are tumors associated with endometrial cancer.

Low immune function has also been implicated in endometrial cancer. High blood pressure is also a risk factor, but this may be because of its association with obesity. Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from endometrial cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.

===Protective factors===
Smoking and the use of progestin are both protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than five infants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18 months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual&#x27;s risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective. Mendelian randomization analyses have established potential protective factors such as LDL cholesterol, later age of menarche and sex hormone binding globulin.

==Pathophysiology==

Endometrial cancer forms when there are errors in normal endometrial cell growth. Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. These abnormal cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow excessively.

In 10–20% of endometrial cancers, mostly Grade 3 (the highest histologic grade), mutations are found in a tumor suppressor gene, commonly p53 or PTEN. In 20% of endometrial hyperplasias and 50% of endometrioid cancers, PTEN has a loss-of-function mutation or a null mutation, making it less effective or completely ineffective. Loss of PTEN function leads to up-regulation of the PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway, which causes cell growth. The p53 pathway can either be suppressed or highly activated in endometrial cancer. When a mutant version of p53 is overexpressed, the cancer tends to be particularly aggressive. P53 mutations and chromosome instability are associated with serous carcinomas, which tend to resemble ovarian and Fallopian carcinomas. Serous carcinomas are thought to develop from endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma.
PTEN and p27 loss of function mutations are associated with a good prognosis, particularly in obese women. The Her2/neu oncogene, which indicates a poor prognosis, is expressed in 20% of endometrioid and serous carcinomas. CTNNB1 (beta-catenin; a transcription gene) mutations are found in 14–44% of endometrial cancers and may indicate a good prognosis, but the data is unclear. Beta-catenin mutations are commonly found in endometrial cancers with squamous cells. FGFR2 mutations are found in approximately 10% of endometrial cancers, and their prognostic significance is unclear. SPOP is another tumor suppressor gene found to be mutated in some cases of endometrial cancer: 9% of clear cell endometrial carcinomas and 8% of serous endometrial carcinomas have mutations in this gene.

Type I and Type II cancers (explained below) tend to have different mutations involved. ARID1A, which often carries a point mutation in Type I endometrial cancer, is also mutated in 26% of clear cell carcinomas of the endometrium, and 18% of serous carcinomas. Epigenetic silencing and point mutations of several genes are commonly found in Type I endometrial cancer. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes are common in Type II endometrial cancer. PIK3CA is commonly mutated in both Type I and Type II cancers. In women with Lynch syndrome-associated endometrial cancer, microsatellite instability is common.

Development of an endometrial hyperplasia (overgrowth of endometrial cells) is a significant risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do develop into adenocarcinoma, though cancer can develop without the presence of a hyperplasia. Within ten years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53, and develops into a serous carcinoma.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of endometrial cancer is made first by a physical examination, endometrial biopsy, or dilation and curettage (removal of endometrial tissue; D&amp;C). This tissue is then examined histologically for characteristics of cancer. If cancer is found, medical imaging may be done to see whether the cancer has spread or invaded tissues like the myometrium (the muscular wall of the womb) or the uterine cervix. A study from 2024 indicates that transvaginal ultrasound provides diagnostic performance comparable to magnetic resonance imaging regarding the myometrial infiltration assessment. However, magnetic resonance imaging showed significantly better specificity in low-grade endometrial cancer. 

===Examination===
Routine screening of asymptomatic people is not indicated since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, should be aware of the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).

Women with Lynch syndrome should begin to have annual biopsy screening at the age of 35. Some women with Lynch syndrome elect to have a prophylactic hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy to greatly reduce the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer.

Transvaginal ultrasound to examine the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used to aid in the diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They can also be used to investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.

Dilation and curettage or an endometrial biopsy are used to obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, but it may not give conclusive results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with a biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D&amp;C has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.

Before treatment is begun, several other investigations are recommended. These include a chest x-ray, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and a test for levels of CA-125, a tumor marker that can be elevated in endometrial cancer.

===Classification===
Endometrial cancers may be tumors derived from epithelial cells (carcinomas), mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumors (carcinosarcomas), or mesenchymal tumors.
Traditional classification of endometrial carcinomas is based either on clinical and endocrine features (Type I and Type II), or histopathological characteristics (endometrioid, serous, and clear-cell). Some tumors are difficult to classify and have features overlapping more than one category. High grade endometrioid tumors, in particular, tend to have both type I and type II features.

====Carcinoma====
The vast majority of endometrial cancers are carcinomas (usually adenocarcinomas), meaning that they originate from the single layer of epithelial cells that line the endometrium and form the endometrial glands. There are many microscopic subtypes of endometrial carcinoma, but they are broadly organized into two categories, Type I and Type II, based on clinical features and pathogenesis. The two subtypes are genetically distinct.

Type I endometrial carcinomas occur most commonly before and around the time of menopause. In the United States, they are more common in white women, particularly those with a history of endometrial hyperplasia. Type I endometrial cancers are often low-grade, minimally invasive into the underlying uterine wall (myometrium), estrogen-dependent, and have a good outcome with treatment. Type I carcinomas represent 75–90% of endometrial cancer.

Type II endometrial carcinomas usually occur in older, post-menopausal people, in the United States are more common in black women, and are not associated with increased exposure to estrogen or a history of endometrial hyperplasia. Type II endometrial cancers are often high-grade, with deep invasion into the underlying uterine wall (myometrium), are of the serous or clear cell type, and carry a poorer prognosis. They can appear to be epithelial ovarian cancer on evaluation of symptoms. They tend to present later than Type I tumors and are more aggressive, with a greater risk of relapse and/or metastasis.

=====Endometrioid adenocarcinoma=====

In endometrioid adenocarcinoma, the cancer cells grow in patterns reminiscent of normal endometrium, with many new glands formed from columnar epithelium with some abnormal nuclei. Low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have well differentiated cells, have not invaded the myometrium, and are seen alongside endometrial hyperplasia. The tumor&#x27;s glands form very close together, without the stromal tissue that normally separates them. Higher-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have less well-differentiated cells, have more solid sheets of tumor cells no longer organized into glands, and are associated with an atrophied endometrium. There are several subtypes of endometrioid adenocarcinoma with similar prognoses, including villoglandular, secretory, and ciliated cell variants. There is also a subtype characterized by squamous differentiation. Some endometrioid adenocarcinomas have foci of mucinous carcinoma.

The genetic mutations most commonly associated with endometrioid adenocarcinoma are in the genes PTEN, a tumor suppressor; PIK3CA, a kinase; KRAS, a GTPase that functions in signal transduction; and CTNNB1, involved in adhesion and cell signaling. The CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) gene is most commonly mutated in the squamous subtype of endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

=====Serous carcinoma=====

Serous carcinoma is a Type II endometrial tumor that makes up 5–10% of diagnosed endometrial cancer and is common in postmenopausal women with atrophied endometrium and black women. Serous endometrial carcinoma is aggressive and often invades the myometrium and metastasizes within the peritoneum (seen as omental caking) or the lymphatic system. Histologically, it appears with many atypical nuclei, papillary structures, and, in contrast to endometrioid adenocarcinomas, rounded cells instead of columnar cells. Roughly 30% of endometrial serous carcinomas also have psammoma bodies. Serous carcinomas spread differently than most other endometrial cancers; they can spread outside the uterus without invading the myometrium.

The genetic mutations seen in serous carcinoma are chromosomal instability and mutations in TP53, an important tumor suppressor gene.

=====Clear cell carcinoma=====

Clear cell carcinoma is a Type II endometrial tumor that makes up less than 5% of diagnosed endometrial cancer. Like serous cell carcinoma, it is usually aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. Histologically, it is characterized by the features common to all clear cells: the eponymous clear cytoplasm when H&amp;E stained and visible, distinct cell membranes. The p53 cell signaling system is not active in endometrial clear cell carcinoma. This form of endometrial cancer is more common in postmenopausal women.

=====Mucinous carcinoma=====
Mucinous carcinomas are a rare form of endometrial cancer, making up less than 1–2% of all diagnosed endometrial cancer. Mucinous endometrial carcinomas are most often stage I and grade I, giving them a good prognosis. They typically have well-differentiated columnar cells organized into glands with the characteristic mucin in the cytoplasm. Mucinous carcinomas must be differentiated from cervical adenocarcinoma.

=====Mixed or undifferentiated carcinoma=====
Mixed carcinomas are those that have both Type I and Type II cells, with one making up at least 10% of the tumor. These include the malignant mixed Müllerian tumor, which derives from endometrial epithelium and has a poor prognosis.

Undifferentiated endometrial carcinomas make up less than 1–2% of diagnosed endometrial cancers. They have a worse prognosis than grade III tumors. Histologically, these tumors show sheets of identical epithelial cells with no identifiable pattern.

=====Other carcinomas=====
Non-metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma are very rare in the endometrium. Squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium has a poor prognosis. It has been reported fewer than 100 times in the medical literature since its characterization in 1892. For primary squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium (PSCCE) to be diagnosed, there must be no other primary cancer in the endometrium or cervix and it must not be connected to the cervical epithelium. Because of the rarity of this cancer, there are no guidelines for how it should be treated, nor any typical treatment. The common genetic causes remain uncharacterized. Primary transitional cell carcinomas of the endometrium are even more rare; 16 cases had been reported . Its pathophysiology and treatments have not been characterized. Histologically, TCCE resembles endometrioid carcinoma and is distinct from other transitional cell carcinomas.

====Sarcoma====
In contrast to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that originate in the non-glandular connective tissue of the endometrium. They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The prognosis for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60–90% five-year survival. High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (HGUS) has a worse prognosis, with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year survival. HGUS prognosis is dictated by whether or not the cancer has invaded the arteries and veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year survival is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best prognosis, with five-year survival of 98% and ten-year survival of 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.

===Metastasis===
Endometrial cancer frequently metastasizes to the ovaries and Fallopian tubes when the cancer is located in the upper part of the uterus, and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part of the uterus. The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa, then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, but in no specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other gynecologic cancer.

===Histopathology===

There is a three-tiered system for histologically classifying endometrial cancers, ranging from cancers with well-differentiated cells (grade I), to very poorly-differentiated cells (grade III). Grade I cancers are the least aggressive and have the best prognosis, while grade III tumors are the most aggressive and likely to recur. Grade II cancers are intermediate between grades I and III in terms of cell differentiation and aggressiveness of disease. There is also a separate &quot;nuclear grade&quot; system, where grade 1 tumors have inconspicuous cell nuclei, whereas grade 3 tumors have highly atypical nuclei.

The histopathology of endometrial cancers is highly diverse. The most common finding is a well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma, which is composed of numerous, small, crowded glands with varying degrees of nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and stratification. This often appears on a background of endometrial hyperplasia. Frank adenocarcinoma may be distinguished from atypical hyperplasia by the finding of clear stromal invasion, or &quot;back-to-back&quot; glands which represent nondestructive replacement of the endometrial stroma by the cancer. With progression of the disease, the myometrium is infiltrated.
===Staging===
Endometrial carcinoma is surgically staged using the FIGO cancer staging system. The 2009 FIGO staging system is commonly used. There is an updated 2023 FIGO staging system, but it is not yet universally adopted. The 2009 FIGO staging system is as follows:


Myometrial invasion and involvement of the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes are the most commonly seen patterns of spread. A Stage 0 is sometimes included, in this case it is referred to as &quot;carcinoma in situ&quot;. In 26% of presumably early-stage cancers, intraoperative staging revealed pelvic and distant metastases, making comprehensive surgical staging necessary.
==Management==

===Surgery===

The initial treatment for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% of women with endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is the removal of the uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In women with presumed stage I disease, a 2017 systematic review found no evidence that lymphadenectomy reduces the risk of death or relapse of cancer when compared with no lymphadenectomy. Women who undergo lymphadenectomy are more likely to experience systemic morbidity related to surgery or lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, in those with presumed early stage primary endometrial cancer, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with reduced operative morbidity and similar overall and disease free survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.

The few contraindications to surgery include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or a desire to preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D&amp;C or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and lymphedema, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.

===Add-on therapy===
There are a number of possible additional therapies. Surgery can be followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy in cases of high-risk or high-grade cancers. This is called adjuvant therapy.

====Chemotherapy====
Adjuvant chemotherapy is a recent innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). Adjuvant chemotherapy has been found to increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.

In cases where surgery is not indicated, palliative chemotherapy is an option; higher-dose chemotherapy is associated with longer survival. Palliative chemotherapy, particularly using capecitabine and gemcitabine, is also often used to treat recurrent endometrial cancer.

Low certainty evidence suggests that in women with recurrent endometrial cancer who have had chemotherapy, receiving drugs that inhibit the mTOR pathway may reduce the risk of disease worsening compared to having more chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Though, mTOR inhibitors may increase the chance of experiencing digestive tract ulcers.

====Radiotherapy====
Adjuvant radiotherapy is commonly used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; in the case of endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.

Radiotherapy can also be used before surgery in certain cases. When pre-operative imaging or clinical evaluation shows tumor invading the cervix, radiation can be given before a total hysterectomy is performed. Brachytherapy and EBRT can also be used, singly or in combination, when there is a contraindication for hysterectomy. Both delivery methods of radiotherapy are associated with side effects, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.

====Hormonal therapy====
Hormonal therapy is only beneficial in certain types of endometrial cancer. It was once thought to be beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. There is no evidence to support the use of progestagen in addition to surgery for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.

In 2010 hormonal therapy is of unclear effect in those with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. There is insufficient evidence to inform women considering hormone replacement therapy after treatment for endometrial cancer.

==== Targeted therapy ====
Dostarlimab has been approved by the FDA for therapy of endometrial cancer with specific biomarker

===Monitoring===
The tumor marker CA-125 is frequently elevated in endometrial cancer and can be used to monitor response to treatment, particularly in serous cell cancer or advanced disease. Periodic MRIs or CT scans may be recommended in advanced disease and women with a history of endometrial cancer should receive more frequent pelvic examinations for the five years following treatment. Examinations conducted every three to four months are recommended for the first two years following treatment, and every six months for the next three years.

Women with endometrial cancer should not have routine surveillance imaging to monitor the cancer unless new symptoms appear or tumor markers begin rising. Imaging without these indications is discouraged because it is unlikely to detect a recurrence or improve survival, and because it has its own costs and side effects. If a recurrence is suspected, PET/CT scanning is recommended.

==Prognosis==

===Survival rates===

The five-year survival rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. More than 70% of women diagnosed have FIGO stage I cancer, which has the best prognosis. Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III–IV endometrial cancer is nine to ten months. Older age indicates a worse prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher survival rate than black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease by the time of their diagnosis. Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to three years, compared with 36% of women with low progesterone receptor disease. Heart disease is the most common cause of death among those who survive endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common. Following diagnosis, quality of life is also positively associated with a healthy lifestyle (no obesity, high-quality diet, physical activity).

===Recurrence rates===

Recurrence of early stage endometrial cancer ranges from 3 to 17%, depending on primary and adjuvant treatment. Most recurrences (75–80%) occur outside of the pelvis, and most occur within two to three years of treatment—64% within two years and 87% within three years.

Higher-staged cancers are more likely to recur, as are those that have invaded the myometrium or cervix, or that have metastasized into the lymphatic system. Papillary serous carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and endometrioid carcinoma are the subtypes at the highest risk of recurrence. High-grade histological subtypes are also at elevated risk for recurrence.

The most common site of recurrence is in the vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer that has not been treated with radiation, EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with radiation recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (&lt;1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).

==Epidemiology==
, approximately 320,000 women are diagnosed with endometrial cancer worldwide each year and 76,000 die, making it the sixth most common cancer in women. It is more common in developed countries, where the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer in women is 1.6%, compared to 0.6% in developing countries. It occurs in 12.9 out of 100,000 women annually in developed countries.

In the United States, endometrial cancer is the most frequently diagnosed gynecologic cancer and, in women, the fourth most common cancer overall, representing 6% of all cancer cases in women. In that country, it was estimated that 52,630 women were diagnosed yearly and 8,590 would die from the disease. Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, and North America have the highest rates of endometrial cancer, whereas Africa and West Asia have the lowest rates. Asia saw 41% of the world&#x27;s endometrial cancer diagnoses in 2012, whereas Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, and North America together comprised 48% of diagnoses. Unlike most cancers, the number of new cases has risen in recent years, including an increase of over 40% in the United Kingdom between 1993 and 2013. Some of this rise may be due to the increase in obesity rates in developed countries, increasing life expectancies, and lower birth rates. The average lifetime risk for endometrial cancer is approximately 2–3% in people with uteruses. In the UK, approximately 7,400 cases are diagnosed annually, and in the EU, approximately 88,000.

Endometrial cancer appears most frequently during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), between the ages of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50 years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63 years of age; in the United States, the average age of diagnosis is 60 years of age. White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than black American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.

==Research==

There are several experimental therapies for endometrial cancer under research, including immunologic, hormonal, and chemotherapeutic treatments. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), an antibody against the Her2 protein, has been used in cancers known to be positive for the Her2/neu oncogene, but research is still underway. Immunologic therapies are also under investigation, particularly in uterine papillary serous carcinoma.
Cancers can be analyzed using genetic techniques (including DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry) to determine if certain therapies specific to mutated genes can be used to treat it. PARP inhibitors are used to treat endometrial cancer with PTEN mutations, specifically, mutations that lower the expression of PTEN. The PARP inhibitor shown to be active against endometrial cancer is olaparib. Research is ongoing in this area as of the 2010s.
Research is ongoing on the use of metformin, a diabetes medication, in obese women with endometrial cancer before surgery. Early research has shown it to be effective in slowing the rate of cancer cell proliferation. Preliminary research has shown that preoperative metformin administration can reduce expression of tumor markers. Long-term use of metformin has not been shown to have a preventative effect against developing cancer, but may improve overall survival.
Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, is under investigation as a potential treatment. Research shows that mTOR inhibitors may be particularly effective for cancers with mutations in PTEN. Ridaforolimus (deforolimus) is also being researched as a treatment for people who have previously had chemotherapy. Preliminary research has been promising, and a stage II trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. There has also been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. Bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which inhibit angiogenesis, are being researched as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Ixabepilone is being researched as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Treatments for rare high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being researched, as there is no established standard of care yet for this disease. Chemotherapies being researched include doxorubicin and ifosfamide.
There is also research in progress on more genes and biomarkers that may be linked to endometrial cancer. The protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and the IUD is being investigated. Preliminary research has shown that the levonorgestrel IUD placed for a year, combined with six monthly injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, can stop or reverse the progress of endometrial cancer in young women; specifically complex atypical hyperplasia however the results have been inconclusive. An experimental drug that combines a hormone with doxorubicin is also under investigation for greater efficacy in cancers with hormone receptors. Hormone therapy that is effective in treating breast cancer, including use of aromatase inhibitors, is also being investigated for use in endometrial cancer. One such drug is anastrozole, which is currently being researched in hormone-positive recurrences after chemotherapy. Research into hormonal treatments for endometrial stromal sarcomas is ongoing as well. It includes trials of drugs like mifepristone, a progestin antagonist, and aminoglutethimide and letrozole, two aromatase inhibitors.
Research continues into the best imaging method for detecting and staging endometrial cancer. As current diagnostic methods are invasive and inaccurate, researchers are looking into new ways to catch endometrial cancer, especially in its early stages. A study found that using a technique involving infrared light on simple blood test samples detected uterine cancer with high accuracy (87%), and could detect precancerous growths in all cases. In surgery, research has shown that complete pelvic lymphadenectomy along with hysterectomy in stage 1 endometrial cancer does not improve survival and increases the risk of negative side effects, including lymphedema. Other research is exploring the potential of identifying the sentinel lymph nodes for biopsy by injecting the tumor with dye that shines under infrared light. Intensity modulated radiation therapy is currently under investigation, and already used in some centers, for application in endometrial cancer, to reduce side effects from traditional radiotherapy. Its risk of recurrence has not yet been quantified. Research on hyperbaric oxygen therapy to reduce side effects is also ongoing. The results of the PORTEC 3 trial assessing combining adjuvant radiotherapy with chemotherapy were awaited in late 2014.

There is not enough evidence to determine if people with endometrial cancer benefit from additional behavioural and life style interventions that are aimed at losing excess weight.

==History and culture==
Endometrial cancer is not widely known by the general populace, despite its frequency. There is low awareness of the symptoms, which can lead to later diagnosis and worse survival.

<text>The national flag of Turkey, officially the Turkish flag (), is a red flag featuring a white crescent and star on its emblem, It’s based on the 18th-century Ottoman Empire flag. The flag is often called &quot;the red flag&quot; (), and is referred to as &quot;the red banner&quot; () in the Turkish national anthem. The measures, geometric proportions, and exact tone of red of the flag of Turkey were legally standardized with the Turkish Flag Law on 29 May 1936.

== History ==
The star and crescent design appears on Ottoman flags beginning in the late 18th or early 19th century. The white star and crescent moon on red as the flag of the Ottoman Empire were introduced in 1844.

After the declaration of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the new administrative regime maintained the last flag of the Ottoman Empire. Proportional standardizations were introduced in the Turkish Flag Law of 1936.

== Legal basis ==
Fundamentals of the Turkish flag were laid down by Turkish Flag Law No. 2994 on 29 May 1936 during the Republic period of Turkey. Turkish Flag Regulation No. 2/7175 dated 28 July 1937, and Supplementary Regulation No. 11604/2 dated 29 July 1939, were enacted to describe how the flag law would be implemented. The Turkish Flag Law No. 2893 dated 22 September 1983, and Published in the Official Gazette on 24 September 1983, was promulgated six months after its publication. According to Article 9 of Law No. 2893, a statute including the fundamentals of the implementation was also published.

=== Usage in the Republic of Cyprus ===
According to the Constitution of Cyprus, the community authorities and their institutions have the right to hoist the Turkish flag (as well as the Greek flag) alongside the flag of Cyprus during the holidays. Any citizen may, without any restriction, fly the Greek or Turkish flag, or both, next to the flag of Cyprus.

== Construction ==

===Colours===
In the Turkish flag statute, the red colour is specified as codice_1 in the LAB colour space. The resulting colour is a very dark red approaching the colour of claret.

In official digital usage, however, a brighter red is used. In an RGB colour space, this red colour of the Turkish flag is composed of 89% red and 11% white. In a CMYK colour space, it is composed of 0% cyan, 95.6% magenta, 89.9% yellow and 11% black. It has a hue angle of 356.4 degrees, a saturation of 91.6%, and a lightness of 46.5%. The red colour on the Turkish flag is &quot;vivid red&quot; and this colour can be obtained by blending #FF142E with #C70000. The closest websafe colour is: #CC0000.

The colours approximation is listed below:
===Dimensions===
The specification below, given by Turkish Flag Law, implies that the distance between (the left edge of) the inner circle of the crescent and a vertical line connecting the two pointed ends of the crescent is G = 0.34875 G; thus, the left point of the star intrudes about 0.0154 G beyond that line.

== Display and use ==


=== State institutions ===
The flag is always displayed prominently in state institutions from schools to ministries. The Beştepe Presidential Complex, Parliament, ministries, schools, military, councils, governors buildings, muhtar&#x27;s offices, bridges, airports, and every state owned building in the country features one or more flags of Turkey.

=== Uniforms ===
On military uniforms the flag is displayed on a patch either on the right shoulder or on the front of the uniform. Helmets can display the flag too on the front or the sides. Flight suits, navy uniforms, Jandarma uniforms and others feature the flag on shoulder patches or helmets. Along with uniforms several emblems and patches display the flag with prominence or minor alteration.

=== Days of display ===
Turkey celebrates many national events such as battle victories and Republic Day. People come to the streets with their flags to celebrate such days. On other occasions the public uses the flag heavily when protesting or commemorating certain events or deaths respectively. Statues and monuments may be draped with the flag while marches and songs are played. On television screens the flag is displayed in celebration of such events too with the portrait of Atatürk next to it. The flag may also be presented at half staff in mourning of tragic events or important days.

=== Funerals ===
The flag has a prominent display on state and military funerals. A burial flag is always draped over the deceased coffin and is carried by the military police or relatives of the deceased. Soldiers of all types and the Presidential Guard also carry the coffin at times. Many attendees also feature the flag on their lapels along with an image of the deceased.

<doc id="412816" wikidata="Q790766" url="?curid=412816" title="Avia S-199">
<text>The Avia S-199 is a propeller-driven Messerschmitt Bf 109G-based fighter aircraft built after World War II using the Bf 109G airframe and a Junkers Jumo 211F engine in place of the original and unavailable Daimler-Benz DB 605 engine. It is notable as the first fighter obtained by the Israeli Air Force, and used during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

Constructed in Czechoslovakia, with parts and plans left over from Luftwaffe aircraft production, the aircraft had numerous problems and was generally unpopular with its pilots. Czechoslovak pilots nicknamed it &quot;Mezek&quot; (&quot;Mule&quot;), while in Israel, it was officially known as the &quot;Sakeen&quot; (&quot;knife&quot; in Hebrew). In practice, the aircraft was more often called Messerschmitt or &quot;Messer&quot; (which also means &quot;knife&quot;, in German and Yiddish).

==Design and development==

Avia continued building Messerschmitt Bf 109G-6s after the war under the Avia S-99 name, at two aircraft factories in Czechoslovakia.
One of them was officially called &quot;závod Avia&quot; (Avia Plant) (1946–48) and &quot;závod Avia-Jiřího Dimitrova&quot; (Avia-George Dimitroff-Plant, 1948–49) in Čakovice near Prague, as a postwar corporative part of the &quot;Automobilové závody, n.p.&quot; [Automotive Works, National Corp.]. The other was named &quot;závod Vysočany&quot; (Vysočany Plant, 1948–49) in Prague, as a corporative part of &quot;Letecké závody, n.p.&quot; [Aviation Works, National Corp.], but soon ran out of the 109&#x27;s Daimler-Benz DB 605 engines after many were destroyed during an explosion at a warehouse in Krásné Březno.

The S-199 continued to use the Bf 109G airframe, but with none of the original DB 605 engines available, an alternative power unit had to be sourced. It was decided that the aircraft would use the Junkers Jumo 211F engine and same propeller type, both as fitted to the Heinkel He 111 bomber. However, the results were far from satisfactory and the outcome was an aircraft that displayed some quite alarming handling characteristics. The substitute engine with the propeller lacked the responsiveness of the Daimler-Benz unit and the torque created by the massive paddle-bladed propeller made control very difficult. This, in combination with the 109&#x27;s narrow-track undercarriage, made landings and takeoffs extremely hazardous.

The Daimler-Benz DB 605 engine allowed for a central cannon mount (&quot;Motorkanone&quot; in German) that fired through the propeller spinner. As the Jumo 211 did not have provision for this, the S-199 used a version of the &quot;Rüstsatz VI&quot; modification kit. This consisted of a single MG 151 cannon mounted beneath each wing, but this further impaired the aircraft&#x27;s performance. A final hidden danger lay in the gun synchronizer for the cowl-mounted MG 131 machine guns, which did not function as envisaged, leading to some Israeli pilots shooting off their own propellers.

Despite these drawbacks, around 550 S-199s were built, including a number of conversion trainers designated CS-199 (armed) and C-210 (unarmed). The first flight took place in March 1947, and production ended in 1949. The last examples were withdrawn from Czechoslovak service (with their National Security Guard) in 1957.

==Operational history==

===Israeli service===
Israeli agents negotiated the purchase of Avia S-199s from the Czechoslovak government in defiance of an arms embargo that Israel faced at the time. Twenty-five aircraft were obtained and all but two were eventually delivered. The price for a fully equipped plane was $190,000. The first four examples arrived on 20 May 1948, six days after Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence and five days after the commencement of hostilities by Egypt. Forming Israel&#x27;s first fighter squadron, the four Avias were assembled and sent into combat for the first time on 29 May during Operation Pleshet, attacking the Egyptian army between Isdud and the Ad Halom bridge, south of Tel Aviv. A few days later, on 3 June, taking off from Herzliya Airport the type scored the Israeli Air Force&#x27;s first aerial victories when Modi Alon shot down two Royal Egyptian Air Force C-47s, which had just bombed Tel Aviv.

The type proved unreliable and performed poorly in combat. Furthermore, maintenance problems meant that no more than five were typically airworthy at any one time. However, Israeli-operated S-199s did score victories over their opponents, including the Spitfire which also equipped the Egyptian Air Force. The Avias were mostly withheld from service by the end of October, when only six remained operational. The S-199 continued making sporadic sorties until mid-December.

<doc id="412822" wikidata="Q942755" url="?curid=412822" title="Folliculitis">
<text>Folliculitis is the infection and inflammation of one or more hair follicles. The condition may occur anywhere on hair-covered skin. The rash may appear as pimples that come to white tips on the face, chest, back, arms, legs, buttocks, or head.

Although acne can often involve superficial infection and inflammation of some hair follicles, the condition of those follicles is usually not called folliculitis, as that term is usually reserved for the separate set of disease entities comprising infected and inflamed hair follicles with causes other than acne.

== Signs and symptoms ==

* Rash (reddened skin area)
* Itching skin
* Pimples or pustules located around a hair or follicle; may be confused with chicken pox
** May crust over
** Typically occur on neck, armpit, or groin
** May present as genital lesions
* Spreading from leg to arm to body through improper treatment with antibiotics
===Complications===
This condition can develop into a more severe skin condition, such as cellulitis or abscess.

== Causes ==
Most carbuncles, boils, and other cases of folliculitis are infected with &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;.

Folliculitis starts with the introduction of a skin pathogen to a hair follicle. Hair follicles can also be damaged by friction from clothing, an insect bite, blockage of the follicle, shaving, or braids that are very tight and close to the scalp. The damaged follicles are then infected by &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; spp. Folliculitis can affect people of all ages. Iron-deficiency anemia is sometimes associated with chronic cases.

===Bacterial===
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; folliculitis
* Hot-tub folliculitis is caused by the bacterium &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;. The folliculitis usually occurs after sitting in a hot tub that was not properly cleaned before use. Symptoms are found around the body parts that sit in the hot tub – the legs, hips, chest, buttocks, and surrounding areas. Symptoms are amplified around regions that were covered by wet clothing, such as bathing suits.
* Sycosis vulgaris, sycosis barbae, or barber&#x27;s itch is a staphylococcal infection of the hair follicles in the bearded area of the face, usually the upper lip. Shaving aggravates the condition.
* Gram-negative folliculitis may appear after prolonged acne treatment with antibiotics.

===Fungal===

* Tinea barbae is similar to barber&#x27;s itch, but the infection is caused by the fungus &quot;T. rubrum&quot;.
* Malassezia folliculitis, formerly known as &quot;Pityrosporum &quot;folliculitis, is caused by yeasts (part of the fungus kingdom) of the genus &quot;Malassezia&quot;

===Mites===
*Demodex folliculitis is usually caused by an overgrowth of &quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot; a mite that lives in human hair follicles. Although most people with &quot;D. folliculorurm&quot; have no symptoms, the mite can reproduce excessively, particularly in people with oily scalps.

===Viral===
* Herpetic folliculitis is rarer, but may occur when herpes simplex virus infection spreads to nearby hair follicles appearing in groups or clusters, mostly around the mouth.

===Noninfectious===
* Pseudofolliculitis barbae is a disorder occurring when hair curves back into the skin and causes inflammation.
* Eosinophilic folliculitis may appear in persons with impaired immune systems.
* Folliculitis decalvans or tufted folliculitis usually affects the scalp. Several hairs arise from the same hair follicle. Scarring and permanent hair loss may follow. The cause is unknown.
* Folliculitis keloidalis scarring on the nape of the neck is most common among males with curly hair.
* Oil folliculitis is inflammation of hair follicles due to exposure to various oils, and typically occurs on forearms or thighs. It is common in refinery workers, road workers, mechanics, and sheep shearers. Even makeup may cause it.
* Malignancy may also be represented by recalcitrant cases.

==Treatment==
Most simple cases resolve on their own, but first-line treatments are typically topical medications.
# Topical antiseptic treatment is adequate for most cases.
# Topical antibiotics, such as mupirocin or neomycin/polymyxin B/bacitracin ointment may be prescribed. Oral antibiotics may also be used.
# Some patients may benefit from systemic narrow-spectrum penicillinase-resistant penicillins (such as dicloxacillin in the US or flucloxacillin in UK).
# Fungal folliculitis may require an oral antifungal such as fluconazole. Topical antifungals such as econazole nitrate may also be effective.

Folliculitis may recur even after symptoms have gone away.

<text>The national flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran, also known as the &quot;Tricolour Flag of Iran&quot; (), is a tricolour featuring the Pan-Iranian colors comprising equal horizontal bands of green, white and red with the national emblem (&quot;Allah&quot;) in red centred on the white band and the &quot;takbir&quot; written 11 times each in the Kufic script in white, at the bottom of the green and the top of the red band. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the present-day flag was adopted on 29 July 1980.

Many Iranian exiles opposed to the Iranian government use the Iranian monarchy tricolour flag with the Lion and Sun at the center, or the tricolour without additional emblems.

==Flag description==
===Colour symbolism===

The Iranian flag, which was later designed under Darius I, symbolised this unity and victory (green above white and red) as the flag of the people of Iran.

====Colour scheme====

===Construction===
Physical requirements for the Iranian flag, a simple construction sheet, and a compass-and-straightedge construction for the emblem and the takbir are described in the national Iranian standard ISIRI 1.

==History==
===Prehistory===

The oldest flag found in Iran is the Bronze Age Shahdad Standard, found in Shahdad, Kerman province, dating back to , made of bronze. It features a seated man and a kneeling woman facing each other, with a star in between. This iconography can be found in other Bronze Age pieces of art in the area as well.

===Achaemenid Empire===
The Old Persian word for &quot;banner, standard&quot; was &quot;drafša-&quot; (Avestan &quot;drafša-&quot;, Middle Persian &quot;drafš&quot;, cognate with Sanskrit &quot; drapsá-&quot;). Xenophon in &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; (7.1.4) describes the standard of Artaxerxes II at Cunaxa as &quot;a golden eagle, with outspread wings, borne aloft on a long spear-shaft&quot;, the same banner recorded to be used by Cyrus the Great.

According to Herodotus (9.59), each Persian army division had its own standard, and &quot;all officers had banners over their tents&quot; (Xenophon, 8.5.13). One such banner, a square plaque in saltire, is depicted on a Greek vase, the so-called &quot;Douris cup&quot; held by the Louvre. A similar design is known from an Urartian bronze disk from Altıntepe. Similar square plaques on poles are known from six of the audience scenes of the Throne Hall relief at Persepolis. The Alexander Mosaic of Pompeii, a Roman-era copy of a Hellenistic painting dated , also shows the royal Persian standard., depicted as a rectangular plaque, possibly originally in purple, with a dark red border with yellow dots. In the field, a golden bird is only partially preserved. The &quot;royal falcon&quot; of Persia (&quot;varəγna&quot;) represented &quot;farr&quot; &#x27;glory&#x27;, while the eagle was associated with the Achaemenid dynasty itself.

A square tile representing a miniature (12 cm2) banner was discovered at Persepolis in 1948. The tile is made of Egyptian blue frit and likely represents Ancient Egyptian Horus, but in the Persian context suggests local association with the Avestan &quot;varəγna&quot; or the royal eagle of the Achaemenids.

===Sassanid Empire===

===Seljuk Empire===
Various emblems and banners have been recorded to be used by the Seljuks in different periods. Early Seljuks were using their traditional emblems, but they gradually adopted local Muslim emblems and banners. The official flag of the empire was most probably a black flag, similar to the flag of the Abbasid Caliphate. The flag was decorated with emblems, which were either superimposed over it or was placed above the flag. This black flag was traditionally presented to the Seljuk sovereigns by the Abbasid caliphs.

A yellow flag was also used to denote Seljuk sovereignty over a town.

===Ghaznavid dynasty===
The Turkic Ghaznavid dynasty were invested in promoting Iranian culture. They are known to have displayed a number of heraldic emblems that harked back to pre-Islamic Iran, including the Sun and Lion motif, as well as the Griffin motif. Their banners appear to have shown chequered motifs.

====Flags====
===Afsharid dynasty===
Nader Shah consciously avoided the using the colour green, as green was associated with Shia Islam and the Safavid dynasty.

The two imperial standards were placed on the right of the square already mentioned: one of them was in stripes of red, blue, and white, and the other of red, blue, white, and yellow, without any other ornament: though the old standards required 12 men to move them, the shah lengthened their staffs, and made them yet heavier; he also put new colours of silk upon them, the one red and yellow striped, the other yellow edged with red: they were made of such an enormous size, to prevent their being carried off by the enemy, except by an entire defeat. The regimental colours were a narrow slip of silk, sloped to a point, some were red, some white, and some striped.

===Zand dynasty===
The state flag of the Zand dynasty was a white triangular pennant with a green border and a gold lion and sun in the centre. Another version shown below included the same design but with green and red.

====Flags====
===Early Qajar dynasty===
Few sources directly describe the national flag during Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar&#x27;s reign. Gholam Hossein Afzal ol-Molk refers to the &quot;Beyraq Qapuq&quot; (&#x27;execution flag&#x27;) of the Naserid period as originating from Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s time. This pennon flag is red and displays the lion and sun motif with a sword, although it is unlikely that the emblem resembled that of Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s time given the sword-less design on the coins of this era. Several modern sources attribute a square flag with a red background and a pale yellow circle in the center, featuring a lion and a sun motif with a sword, to the period of Agha Mohammad Shah. The only visible source for this design is an unidentified portrait of Agha Mohammad Shah, where such a banner is present next to him. This painting was featured on the cover of the 1992 book &quot;Les Rois oubliés: L&#x27;épopée de la dynasty Kadjare&quot;, by Ali Mirza Qajar (grandson of Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar). Moreover, the painting was also photographed at a Qajar family gathering at Chateau de Bonmont, Cheserex, Switzerland in 2003.

In contradistinction, various contemporary and modern sources provide more detailed descriptions of Iranian flags and the development of the lion and sun motif during Fath-Ali Shah&#x27;s rule, particularly in military contexts. Colonel Gaspard Drouville, a French officer who served as a military instructor for the Iranian government after the signing of the Treaty of Finckenstein, authored a two-volume travelogue that offers additional information on Iranian flags and standards. Drouville expounds that in 1813, Fath-Ali Shah Qajar and Abbas Mirza attended a royal inspection of the regular infantry in Azarbaijan to personally confer each standard to their respective corps. These flags included the lion and sun motif, a date or number pertaining to the unit, and the inscription: &quot;Sultan ibn Sultan Fath-Ali Shah Qajar&quot; (Sultan son of Sultan Fath-Ali Shah Qajar), in reference to Abbas Mirza&#x27;s title. The flags and standards are further described as similar to those of the French, adorned with taffeta white streamers and golden fringes. Based on Drouville&#x27;s illustration, the larger flags of the regular infantry were painted red, and the flagpole was crowned by the silver Hand of Ali. The smaller standards that were prescribed to the cavalry lancers were a deep blue and featured a crouching lion brandishing a curved sword before a setting sun. These standards were topped by golden spears that were &quot;as sharp as those of the Houlans&quot;.
An illustration by the French battle painter Joseph Louis Hippolyte Bellangé depicts Abbas Mirza reviewing Persian regular troops. The infantry corps carries a standard with a spearhead finial bearing a couchant lion and sun with a sword, similar to the cavalry flag of the Nezam lancers depicted by Drouville. However, as the work dates to 1835, two years after Abbas Mirza&#x27;s death, the flag&#x27;s design may be an artistic oversight. 

In his accounts of the Russo-Persian war, Captain Yermolov, the Russian commander-in-chief in the Caucasus, documented the Iranian military in detail. One excerpt from his notes provides a vivid portrayal of a Nezam drummer, soldier, and officer carrying a Sarbaz infantry military banner dated to 1817. This banner, which shares many similarities with contemporary European regimental flags, features a lion and sun motif devoid of a sword within a white lozenge accented by a golden border. The light blue banner boasts a flagpole crowned by the silver Hand of Ali. 
A painting, believed to be the work of Allahverdi Afshar between 1814 and 1817, which adorned the walls of Abbas Mirza&#x27;s Ojan castle portrays the Iranian triumph at the Battle of Sultanabad on 13 February 1812. The painting exhibits Persian troops carrying banners of Napoleonic style, featuring the passant lion and sun equipped with a sword.

No contemporary sources have made any other indications of a sword wielded by the lion until the reign of Mohammad Shah. Nonetheless, this illustration provides valuable insight into the evolution of the emblem and its use on Iranian flags during the Qajar period. However, Zoka mentions the inscription of a coin from the Urmia mint, dated 1833 (1249 AH), in which a couchant lion is depicted holding a sword. According to Zoka, these sources prove that the earliest representation of the sword-wielding lion and sun pre-dates the reign of Mohammad Shah and was likely institutionalized in the latter years of Fath-Ali Shah&#x27;s reign.

During Fath-Ali Shah&#x27;s reign, the state flag and other flags adopted by the Iranian government purportedly opted for square or rectangular shapes over the pennon flags commonly used in earlier eras. Another distinction noted in the designs of the lion and sun depicted on coins and flags of Fath-Ali Shah&#x27;s era relative to those of prior years is the appearance of the lion. Before the middle of Fath-Ali Shah&#x27;s reign, a Persian lion, which is maneless and smaller in stature was prominent, whereas later depictions evolved to an African lion. Towards the end of Fath-Ali Shah&#x27;s reign the two common symbols of the Qajar empire were combined to include the Zulfiqar and the lion and sun in the official flag.

While there is little evidence, several modern sources state that Fath-Ali Shah adopted three different state flags; a plain red flag with a couchant lion and sun motif as the war flag, a plain white flag with a couchant lion and sun for diplomatic purposes, and a green flag with a lion passant in front of the setting sun, wielding a sword during peacetime.

Alexis Soltykoff&#x27;s &quot;Voyage en Perse&quot; includes an illustration depicting a standing lion wielding a sword. The painting is titled &quot;Entrée de l&#x27;ambassade de Perse a St. Petersbourg&quot; (&#x27;Entrance of the Persian Embassy to St. Petersburg&#x27;) and shows the arrival of Mirza Abolhassan Khan Ilchi, then the Iranian ambassador to Russia, in 1838. The image features a Persian standard-bearer holding a rectangular flag with a lion passant, holding a curved sword in front of the setting sun. Atop the flagpole is the Hand of Ali finial. The painting was included in Soltykoff&#x27;s book, which was published in 1851, several years after the events it depicts.

French orientalist Louis Dupeux stated that one of the privileges enjoyed by the Shah of Iran was the right to &quot;raise&quot; several flags. Dubeux suggests that Mohammad Shah had two flags. He describes one of these flags as displaying the Zulfiqar while the other depicted a couchant lion and sun motif. 

While Iranian flags and military banners were largely uniform and similar in design by Mohammad Shah&#x27;s reign, &quot;Ahmad Naqash&#x27;s&quot; 1860 oil painting depicting the successful Iranian siege of the fort of Ghurian in 1837 serves as a contradictory source of information. Several noteworthy discrepancies arise. Firstly, the use of pennon banners is unusual as square and rectangular flags were more prominently used in Iran and adopted by the military at that time. Secondly, the sword-less lion and sun motif depicted in the painting is outdated. Thirdly, the white and green colour combination contradicts contemporary literature describing military banners and standards as being red or blue. According to Zoka, the painter may have relied on local designs as the work likely originated from Isfahan or Shiraz, where forts in the provinces often raised flags different from those in Tehran. Zoka also suggests that the Herat expedition&#x27;s army could have reused dated standards predating the new designs.

Under Nasser al-Din Shah, the principal flag was white with a green border on three sides and a lion and emblem in the centre. There was also a naval ensign which had a red and green border and a civil ensign which looked the same as the naval ensign but without the lion and sun in the middle.

====Flags====
===Post-Constitutional Revolution===
The first version of the modern Iranian tricolour was adopted in the wake of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1906. The Supplementary Fundamental Laws of 7 October 1907 described the flag as a tricolour of green, white, and red, with a lion and sun emblem in the middle. A decree dated 4 September 1910 specified the exact details of the emblem, including the shape of the lion&#x27;s tail and the position and the size of the lion, the sword, and the sun.

During this period, the colours of the flag were very pale, with the red appearing closer to pink in practice. There were three variants of the flag in use. The state flag was a tricolour with the lion and sun emblem in the centre. The national flag and civil ensign was a plain tricolour with no emblem. The naval ensign and war flag was similar to the state flag, but the emblem was surrounded by a wreath and surmounted by a crown. All three flags had a 1:3 ratio.

The flag was modified twice during the Pahlavi era. In 1933, the colours of the flag were darkened and the design of the emblem was changed. The sun&#x27;s facial features were removed and the Kiani Crown on the naval ensign was replaced with the Pahlavi Crown. In 1964, the ratio was changed from 1:3 to 4:7 and the emblem on the naval ensign was shrunk to fit entirely within the white stripe.

Following the Iranian Revolution, the Interim Government of Iran removed the crown from the naval ensign. The old state and national flags remained unchanged until 29 July 1980, when the modern Iranian flag was adopted.

====Historical flags====


The new Iranian government viewed the Lion and Sun symbol as representing the &quot;oppressive Westernising monarchy&quot; that had to be replaced, despite the emblem&#x27;s traditional Shi&#x27;a meanings and the lion&#x27;s association with Ali, the first Imam of the Shi&#x27;a. For that reason, the name of the Red Lion and Sun Society was changed to Red Crescent Society.

Currently, the Lion and Sun flag is used by Iranian communities in exile as a symbol of opposition to the Islamic Republic. Some political groups in Iran, including monarchists, continue to use it as well. In Los Angeles, California and other cities with large Iranian expatriate communities, the Lion and Sun, as a distinguishing marker, appears on Iranian flags and souvenirs to an extent that far surpasses its display during the years of monarchy in its homeland, where the plain tricolour was usually used. After the Islamic Revolution in Iran and the replacement of the lion and sun flag with the new flag, new designs of this flag were still presented, prominently by the People&#x27;s Mujahideen of Iran.
