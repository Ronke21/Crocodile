<text>Staining is a technique used to enhance contrast in samples, generally at the microscopic level. Stains and dyes are frequently used in histology (microscopic study of biological tissues), in cytology (microscopic study of cells), and in the medical fields of histopathology, hematology, and cytopathology that focus on the study and diagnoses of diseases at the microscopic level. Stains may be used to define biological tissues (highlighting, for example, muscle fibers or connective tissue), cell populations (classifying different blood cells), or organelles within individual cells.

In biochemistry, it involves adding a class-specific (DNA, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates) dye to a substrate to qualify or quantify the presence of a specific compound. Staining and fluorescent tagging can serve similar purposes. Biological staining is also used to mark cells in flow cytometry, and to flag proteins or nucleic acids in gel electrophoresis. Light microscopes are used for viewing stained samples at high magnification, typically using bright-field or epi-fluorescence illumination.

Staining is not limited to only biological materials, since it can also be used to study the structure of other materials; for example, the lamellar structures of semi-crystalline polymers or the domain structures of block copolymers.

== &quot;In vivo&quot; vs &quot;In vitro&quot; ==
&quot;In vivo staining&quot; (also called vital staining or intravital staining) is the process of dyeing living tissues. By causing certain cells or structures to take on contrasting colours, their form (morphology) or position within a cell or tissue can be readily seen and studied. The usual purpose is to reveal cytological details that might otherwise not be apparent; however, staining can also reveal where certain chemicals or specific chemical reactions are taking place within cells or tissues.

&quot;In vitro&quot; staining involves colouring cells or structures that have been removed from their biological context. Certain stains are often combined to reveal more details and features than a single stain alone. Combined with specific protocols for fixation and sample preparation, scientists and physicians can use these standard techniques as consistent, repeatable diagnostic tools. A counterstain is stain that makes cells or structures more visible, when not completely visible with the principal stain.
* Crystal violet stains both Gram positive and Gram negative organisms. Treatment with alcohol removes the crystal violet colour from gram negative organisms only. Safranin as counterstain is used to colour the gram negative organisms that got decolorised by alcohol.

While ex vivo, many cells continue to live and metabolize until they are &quot;fixed&quot;. Some staining methods are based on this property. Those stains excluded by the living cells but taken up by the already dead cells are called vital stains (e.g. trypan blue or propidium iodide for eukaryotic cells). Those that enter and stain living cells are called supravital stains (e.g. New Methylene Blue and brilliant cresyl blue for reticulocyte staining). However, these stains are eventually toxic to the organism, some more so than others. Partly due to their toxic interaction inside a living cell, when supravital stains enter a living cell, they might produce a characteristic pattern of staining different from the staining of an already fixed cell (e.g. &quot;reticulocyte&quot; look versus diffuse &quot;polychromasia&quot;). To achieve desired effects, the stains are used in very dilute solutions ranging from to (Howey, 2000). Note that many stains may be used in both living and fixed cells.

== Preparation ==
The preparatory steps involved depend on the type of analysis planned. Some or all of the following procedures may be required.

Wet mounts are used to view live organisms and can be made using water and certain stains. The liquid is added to the slide before the addition of the organism and a coverslip is placed over the specimen in the water and stain to help contain it within the field of view.

Fixation, which may itself consist of several steps, aims to preserve the shape of the cells or tissue involved as much as possible. Sometimes heat fixation is used to kill, adhere, and alter the specimen so it accepts stains. Most chemical fixatives (chemicals causing fixation) generate chemical bonds between proteins and other substances within the sample, increasing their rigidity. Common fixatives include formaldehyde, ethanol, methanol, and/or picric acid. Pieces of tissue may be embedded in paraffin wax to increase their mechanical strength and stability and to make them easier to cut into thin slices.

Mordants are chemical agents which have power of making dyes to stain materials which otherwise are unstainable

Mordants are classified into two categories:

a) Basic mordant: React with acidic dyes e.g. alum, ferrous sulfate, cetylpyridinium chloride etc.

b) Acidic mordant : React with basic dyes e.g. picric acid, tannic acid etc.

Direct Staining: Carried out without mordant.

Indirect Staining: Staining with the aid of a mordant.

Permeabilization involves treatment of cells with (usually) a mild surfactant. This treatment dissolves cell membranes, and allows larger dye molecules into the cell&#x27;s interior.

Mounting usually involves attaching the samples to a glass microscope slide for observation and analysis. In some cases, cells may be grown directly on a slide. For samples of loose cells (as with a blood smear or a pap smear) the sample can be directly applied to a slide. For larger pieces of tissue, thin sections (slices) are made using a microtome; these slices can then be mounted and inspected.

=== Standardization ===

Most of the dyes commonly used in microscopy are available as BSC-certified stains. This means that samples of the manufacturer&#x27;s batch have been tested by an independent body, the Biological Stain Commission (BSC), and found to meet or exceed certain standards of purity, dye content and performance in staining techniques ensuring more accurately performed experiments and more reliable results. These standards are published in the commission&#x27;s journal Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry. Many dyes are inconsistent in composition from one supplier to another. The use of BSC-certified stains eliminates a source of unexpected results.

Some vendors sell stains &quot;certified&quot; by themselves rather than by the Biological Stain Commission. Such products may or may not be suitable for diagnostic and other applications.

=== Negative staining ===
A simple staining method for bacteria that is usually successful, even when the positive staining methods fail, is to use a negative stain. This can be achieved by smearing the sample onto the slide and then applying nigrosin (a black synthetic dye) or India ink (an aqueous suspension of carbon particles). After drying, the microorganisms may be viewed in bright field microscopy as lighter inclusions well-contrasted against the dark environment surrounding them. Negative staining is able to stain the background instead of the organisms because the cell wall of microorganisms typically has a negative charge which repels the negatively charged stain. The dyes used in negative staining are acidic. Note: negative staining is a mild technique that may not destroy the microorganisms, and is therefore unsuitable for studying pathogens.

=== Positive staining ===
Unlike negative staining, positive staining uses basic dyes to color the specimen against a bright background. While chromophore is used for both negative and positive staining alike, the type of chromophore used in this technique is a positively charged ion instead of a negative one. The negatively charged cell wall of many microorganisms attracts the positively charged chromophore which causes the specimen to absorb the stain giving it the color of the stain being used. Positive staining is more commonly used than negative staining in microbiology. The different types of positive staining are listed below.

=== Simple versus differential ===
Simple Staining is a technique that only uses one type of stain on a slide at a time. Because only one stain is being used, the specimens (for positive stains) or background (for negative stains) will be one color. Therefore, simple stains are typically used for viewing only one organism per slide. Differential staining uses multiple stains per slide. Based on the stains being used, organisms with different properties will appear different colors allowing for categorization of multiple specimens. Differential staining can also be used to color different organelles within one organism which can be seen in endospore staining.

=== Types ===
== Techniques ==

=== Gram ===

Gram staining is used to determine gram status to classifying bacteria broadly based on the composition of their cell wall. Gram staining uses crystal violet to stain cell walls, iodine (as a mordant), and a fuchsin or safranin counterstain to (mark all bacteria). Gram status, helps divide specimens of bacteria into two groups, generally representative of their underlying phylogeny. This characteristic, in combination with other techniques makes it a useful tool in clinical microbiology laboratories, where it can be important in early selection of appropriate antibiotics.

On most Gram-stained preparations, Gram-negative organisms appear red or pink due to their counterstain. Due to the presence of higher lipid content, after alcohol-treatment, the porosity of the cell wall increases, hence the CVI complex (crystal violet – iodine) can pass through. Thus, the primary stain is not retained. In addition, in contrast to most Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria have only a few layers of peptidoglycan and a secondary cell membrane made primarily of lipopolysaccharide.

=== Endospore ===

Endospore staining is used to identify the presence or absence of endospores, which make bacteria very difficult to kill. Bacterial spores have proven to be difficult to stain as they are not permeable to aqueous dye reagents.  Endospore staining is particularly useful for identifying endospore-forming bacterial pathogens such as &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;. Prior to the development of more efficient methods, this stain was performed using the Wirtz method with heat fixation and counterstain. Through the use of malachite green and a diluted ratio of carbol fuchsin, fixing bacteria in osmic acid was a great way to ensure no blending of dyes. However, newly revised staining methods have significantly decreased the time it takes to create these stains. This revision included substitution of carbol fuchsin with aqueous Safranin paired with a newly diluted 5% formula of malachite green. This new and improved composition of stains was performed in the same way as before with the use of heat fixation, rinsing, and blotting dry for later examination. Upon examination, all endospore forming bacteria will be stained green accompanied by all other cells appearing red.

=== Ziehl-Neelsen ===
A Ziehl–Neelsen stain is an acid-fast stain used to stain species of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; that do not stain with the standard laboratory staining procedures such as Gram staining.

This stain is performed through the use of both red coloured carbol fuchsin that stains the bacteria and a counter stain such as methylene blue.

=== Haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) ===
Haematoxylin and eosin staining is frequently used in histology to examine thin tissue sections. Haematoxylin stains cell nuclei blue, while eosin stains cytoplasm, connective tissue and other extracellular substances pink or red. Eosin is strongly absorbed by red blood cells, colouring them bright red. In a skillfully made H&amp;E preparation the red blood cells are almost orange, and collagen and cytoplasm (especially muscle) acquire different shades of pink.

=== Papanicolaou ===

Papanicolaou staining, or PAP staining, was developed to replace fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in hopes of decreasing staining times and cost without compromising quality. This stain is a frequently used method for examining cell samples from a variety of tissue types in various organs. PAP staining has endured several modifications in order to become a “suitable alternative” for FNAC. This transition stemmed from the appreciation of wet fixed smears by scientists preserving the structures of the nuclei opposed to the opaque appearance of air dried Romanowsky smears. This led to the creation of a hybrid stain of wet fixed and air dried known as the ultrafast papanicolaou stain. This modification includes the use of nasal saline to rehydrate cells to increase cell transparency and is paired with the use of alcoholic formalin to enhance colors of the nuclei. The papanicolaou stain is now used in place of cytological staining in all organ types due to its increase in morphological quality, decreased staining time, and decreased cost. It is frequently used to stain Pap smear specimens. It uses a combination of haematoxylin, Orange G, eosin Y, Light Green SF yellowish, and sometimes Bismarck Brown Y.

=== PAS ===
Periodic acid-Schiff is a histology special stain used to mark carbohydrates (glycogen, glycoprotein, proteoglycans). PAS is commonly used on liver tissue where glycogen deposits are made which is done in efforts to distinguish different types of glycogen storage diseases. PAS is important because it can detect glycogen granules found in tumors of the ovaries and pancreas of the endocrine system, as well as in the bladder and kidneys of the renal system. Basement membranes can also show up in a PAS stain and can be important when diagnosing renal disease. Due to the high volume of carbohydrates within the cell wall of hyphae and yeast forms of fungi, the Periodic acid -Schiff stain can help locate these species inside tissue samples of the human body.

=== Masson ===

Masson&#x27;s trichrome is (as the name implies) a three-colour staining protocol. The recipe has evolved from Masson&#x27;s original technique for different specific applications, but all are well-suited to distinguish cells from surrounding connective tissue. Most recipes produce red keratin and muscle fibers, blue or green staining of collagen and bone, light red or pink staining of cytoplasm, and black cell nuclei.

=== Romanowsky ===

The Romanowsky stains is considered a polychrome staining effect and is based on a combination of eosin plus (chemically reduced eosin) and demethylated methylene blue (containing its oxidation products azure A and azure B). This stain develops varying colors for all cell structures (“Romanowsky-Giemsa effect) and thus was used in staining neutrophil polymorphs and cell nuclei. Common variants include Wright&#x27;s stain, Jenner&#x27;s stain, May-Grunwald stain, Leishman stain and Giemsa stain.

All are used to examine blood or bone marrow samples. They are preferred over H&amp;E for inspection of blood cells because different types of leukocytes (white blood cells) can be readily distinguished. All are also suited to examination of blood to detect blood-borne parasites such as malaria.

=== Silver ===

Silver staining is the use of silver to stain histologic sections. This kind of staining is important in the demonstration of proteins (for example type III collagen) and DNA. It is used to show both substances inside and outside cells. Silver staining is also used in temperature gradient gel electrophoresis.

&quot;Argentaffin cells&quot; reduce silver solution to metallic silver after formalin fixation. This method was discovered by Italian Camillo Golgi, by using a reaction between silver nitrate and potassium dichromate, thus precipitating silver chromate in some cells (see Golgi&#x27;s method). A&quot;rgyrophilic cells&quot; reduce silver solution to metallic silver after being exposed to the stain that contains a reductant. An example of this would be hydroquinone or formalin.

=== Sudan ===

Sudan staining utilizes Sudan dyes to stain sudanophilic substances, often including lipids. Sudan III, Sudan IV, Oil Red O, Osmium tetroxide, and Sudan Black B are often used. Sudan staining is often used to determine the level of fecal fat in diagnosing steatorrhea.

=== Wirtz-Conklin ===
The Wirtz-Conklin stain is a special technique designed for staining true endospores with the use of malachite green dye as the primary stain and safranin as the counterstain. Once stained, they do not decolourize. The addition of heat during the staining process is a huge contributing factor. Heat helps open the spore&#x27;s membrane so the dye can enter. The main purpose of this stain is to show germination of bacterial spores. If the process of germination is taking place, then the spore will turn green in color due to malachite green and the surrounding cell will be red from the safranin. This stain can also help determine the orientation of the spore within the bacterial cell; whether it being terminal (at the tip), subterminal (within the cell), or central (completely in the middle of the cell).

===Collagen hybridizing peptide===

Collagen hybridizing peptide (CHP) staining allows for an easy, direct way to stain denatured collagens of any type (Type I, II, IV, etc.) regardless if they were damaged or degraded via enzymatic, mechanical, chemical, or thermal means. They work by refolding into the collagen triple helix with the available single strands in the tissue. CHPs can be visualized by a simple fluorescence microscope.

== Common biological stains ==
Different stains react or concentrate in different parts of a cell or tissue, and these properties are used to advantage to reveal specific parts or areas. Some of the most common biological stains are listed below. Unless otherwise marked, all of these dyes may be used with fixed cells and tissues; vital dyes (suitable for use with living organisms) are noted.

=== Acridine orange ===
Acridine orange (AO) is a nucleic acid selective fluorescent cationic dye useful for cell cycle determination. It is cell-permeable, and interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions. When bound to DNA, it is very similar spectrally to fluorescein. Like fluorescein, it is also useful as a non-specific stain for backlighting conventionally stained cells on the surface of a solid sample of tissue (fluorescence backlighted staining).

=== Bismarck brown ===
Bismarck brown (also Bismarck brown Y or Manchester brown) imparts a yellow colour to acid mucins and an intense brown color to mast cells. One default of this stain is that it blots out any other structure surrounding it and makes the quality of the contrast low. It has to be paired with other stains  in order to be useful. Some complementing stains used alongside Bismark brown are Hematoxylin and Toluidine blue which provide better contrast within the histology sample.

=== Carmine ===

Carmine is an intensely red dye used to stain glycogen, while Carmine alum is a nuclear stain. Carmine stains require the use of a mordant, usually aluminum.

=== Coomassie blue ===
Coomassie brilliant blue nonspecifically stains proteins a strong blue colour. It is often used in gel electrophoresis.

===Cresyl violet===

Cresyl violet stains the acidic components of the neuronal cytoplasm a violet colour, specifically nissl bodies. Often used in brain research.

=== Crystal violet ===
Crystal violet, when combined with a suitable mordant, stains cell walls purple. Crystal violet is the stain used in Gram staining.

=== DAPI ===
DAPI is a fluorescent nuclear stain, excited by ultraviolet light and showing strong blue fluorescence when bound to DNA. DAPI binds with A=T rich repeats of chromosomes. DAPI is also not visible with regular transmission microscopy. It may be used in living or fixed cells. DAPI-stained cells are especially appropriate for cell counting.

=== Eosin ===
Eosin is most often used as a counterstain to haematoxylin, imparting a pink or red colour to cytoplasmic material, cell membranes, and some extracellular structures. It also imparts a strong red colour to red blood cells. Eosin may also be used as a counterstain in some variants of Gram staining, and in many other protocols. There are actually two very closely related compounds commonly referred to as eosin. Most often used is eosin Y (also known as eosin Y ws or eosin yellowish); it has a very slightly yellowish cast. The other eosin compound is eosin B (eosin bluish or imperial red); it has a very faint bluish cast. The two dyes are interchangeable, and the use of one or the other is more a matter of preference and tradition.

=== Ethidium bromide ===
Ethidium bromide intercalates and stains DNA, providing a fluorescent red-orange stain. Although it will not stain healthy cells, it can be used to identify cells that are in the final stages of apoptosis – such cells have much more permeable membranes. Consequently, ethidium bromide is often used as a marker for apoptosis in cells populations and to locate bands of DNA in gel electrophoresis. The stain may also be used in conjunction with acridine orange (AO) in viable cell counting. This EB/AO combined stain causes live cells to fluoresce green whilst apoptotic cells retain the distinctive red-orange fluorescence.

=== Acid fuchsin ===
Acid fuchsine may be used to stain collagen, smooth muscle, or mitochondria.
Acid fuchsin is used as the nuclear and cytoplasmic stain in Mallory&#x27;s trichrome method. Acid fuchsin stains cytoplasm in some variants of Masson&#x27;s trichrome. In Van Gieson&#x27;s picro-fuchsine, acid fuchsin imparts its red colour to collagen fibres. Acid fuchsin is also a traditional stain for mitochondria (Altmann&#x27;s method).

=== Haematoxylin ===
Haematoxylin (hematoxylin in North America) is a nuclear stain. Used with a mordant, haematoxylin stains nuclei blue-violet or brown. It is most often used with eosin in the H&amp;E stain (haematoxylin and eosin) staining, one of the most common procedures in histology.

=== Hoechst stains ===
Hoechst is a &quot;bis&quot;-benzimidazole derivative compound that binds to the &quot;minor groove&quot; of DNA. Often used in fluorescence microscopy for DNA staining, Hoechst stains appear yellow when dissolved in aqueous solutions and emit blue light under UV excitation. There are two major types of Hoechst: &quot;Hoechst 33258&quot; and &quot;Hoechst 33342&quot;. The two compounds are functionally similar, but with a little difference in structure. Hoechst 33258 contains a terminal hydroxyl group and is thus more soluble in aqueous solution, however this characteristics reduces its ability to penetrate the plasma membrane. Hoechst 33342 contains an ethyl substitution on the terminal hydroxyl group (i.e. an ethylether group) making it more hydrophobic for easier plasma membrane passage

=== Iodine ===
Iodine is used in chemistry as an indicator for starch. When starch is mixed with iodine in solution, an intensely dark blue colour develops, representing a starch/iodine complex. Starch is a substance common to most plant cells and so a weak iodine solution will stain starch present in the cells. Iodine is one component in the staining technique known as Gram staining, used in microbiology. Used as a mordant in Gram&#x27;s staining, iodine enhances the entrance of the dye through the pores present in the cell wall/membrane.

Lugol&#x27;s solution or Lugol&#x27;s iodine (IKI) is a brown solution that turns black in the presence of starches and can be used as a cell stain, making the cell nuclei more visible.

Used with common vinegar (acetic acid), Lugol&#x27;s solution is used to identify pre-cancerous and cancerous changes in cervical and vaginal tissues during &quot;Pap smear&quot; follow up examinations in preparation for biopsy. The acetic acid causes the abnormal cells to blanch white, while the normal tissues stain a mahogany brown from the iodine.

=== Malachite green ===
Malachite green (also known as diamond green B or victoria green B) can be used as a blue-green counterstain to safranin in the Gimenez staining technique for bacteria. It can also be used to directly stain spores.

=== Methyl green ===
Methyl green is used commonly with bright-field, as well as fluorescence microscopes to dye the chromatin of cells so that they are more easily viewed.

=== Methylene blue ===
Methylene blue is used to stain animal cells, such as human cheek cells, to make their nuclei more observable. Also used to stain blood films in cytology.

=== Neutral red ===
Neutral red (or toluylene red) stains Nissl substance red. It is usually used as a counterstain in combination with other dyes.

=== Nile blue ===
Nile blue (or Nile blue A) stains nuclei blue. It may be used with living cells.

=== Nile red ===
Nile red (also known as Nile blue oxazone) is formed by boiling Nile blue with sulfuric acid. This produces a mix of Nile red and Nile blue. Nile red is a lipophilic stain; it will accumulate in lipid globules inside cells, staining them red. Nile red can be used with living cells. It fluoresces strongly when partitioned into lipids, but practically not at all in aqueous solution.

=== Osmium tetroxide (formal name: osmium tetraoxide) ===
Osmium tetraoxide is used in optical microscopy to stain lipids. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.

=== Propidium iodide ===
Propidium iodide is a fluorescent intercalating agent that can be used to stain cells. Propidium iodide is used as a DNA stain in flow cytometry to evaluate cell viability or DNA content in cell cycle analysis, or in microscopy to visualise the nucleus and other DNA-containing organelles. Propidium Iodide cannot cross the membrane of live cells, making it useful to differentiate necrotic, apoptotic and healthy cells. PI also binds to RNA, necessitating treatment with nucleases to distinguish between RNA and DNA staining

=== Rhodamine ===
Rhodamine is a protein specific fluorescent stain commonly used in fluorescence microscopy.

=== Safranine ===
Safranine (or Safranine O) is a red cationic dye. It binds to nuclei (DNA) and other tissue polyanions, including glycosaminoglycans in cartilage and mast cells, and components of lignin and plastids in plant tissues. Safranine should not be confused with saffron, an expensive natural dye that is used in some methods to impart a yellow colour to collagen, to contrast with blue and red colours imparted by other dyes to nuclei and cytoplasm in animal (including human) tissues.

The incorrect spelling &quot;safranin&quot; is in common use. The -ine ending is appropriate for safranine O because this dye is an amine.

=== Thiazole-Orange-Based DNA Dyes ===
Thiazole Orange derivatives, such as SYBR Safe,  SYBR Green, SYBR Gold, Pico Green, SYTO-16, SYTO-9 and TOPhBu are special cyanine dyes commonly used as fluorescent DNA sensors.  The ability of the dyes to detect DNA at low concentrations was evaluated using two metrics: absolute fluorescence enhancement (AFE) and relative fluorescence enhancement (RFE).

==Stainability of tissues==

Tissues which take up stains are called chromatic. Chromosomes were so named because of their ability to absorb a violet stain.

Positive affinity for a specific stain may be designated by the suffix &quot;-philic&quot;. For example, tissues that stain with an azure stain may be referred to as azurophilic. This may also be used for more generalized staining properties, such as acidophilic for tissues that stain by acidic stains (most notably eosin), basophilic when staining in basic dyes, and &quot;amphophilic&quot; when staining with either acid or basic dyes. In contrast, chromophobic tissues do not take up coloured dye readily.

== Electron microscopy ==
As in light microscopy, stains can be used to enhance contrast in transmission electron microscopy. Electron-dense compounds of heavy metals are typically used.

===Phosphotungstic acid===
Phosphotungstic acid is a common negative stain for viruses, nerves, polysaccharides, and other biological tissue materials. It is mostly used in a .5-2% ph form making it neutral and is paired with water to make an aqueous solution. Phosphotungstic acid is filled with electron dense matter that stains the background surrounding the specimen dark and the specimen itself light. This process is not the normal positive technique for staining where the specimen is dark and the background remains light.

=== Osmium tetroxide ===
Osmium tetroxide is used in optical microscopy to stain lipids. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance. Because it is a heavy metal that absorbs electrons, it is perhaps the most common stain used for morphology in biological electron microscopy. It is also used for the staining of various polymers for the study of their morphology by TEM. is very volatile and extremely toxic. It is a strong oxidizing agent as the osmium has an oxidation number of +8. It aggressively oxidizes many materials, leaving behind a deposit of non-volatile osmium in a lower oxidation state.

=== Ruthenium tetroxide ===
Ruthenium tetroxide is equally volatile and even more aggressive than osmium tetraoxide and able to stain even materials that resist the osmium stain, e.g. polyethylene.

Other chemicals used in electron microscopy staining include:
ammonium molybdate, cadmium iodide, carbohydrazide, ferric chloride, hexamine, indium trichloride, lanthanum(III) nitrate, lead acetate, lead citrate, lead(II) nitrate, periodic acid, phosphomolybdic acid, potassium ferricyanide, potassium ferrocyanide, ruthenium red, silver nitrate, silver proteinate, sodium chloroaurate, thallium nitrate, thiosemicarbazide, uranyl acetate, uranyl nitrate, and vanadyl sulfate.

<text>The BMW film series The Hire consists of eight short films (averaging about ten minutes each) produced for the Internet in 2001 and 2002. A form of branded content, the shorts were directed by popular filmmakers from around the globe and starred Clive Owen as &quot;the Driver&quot; while highlighting the performance aspects of various BMW automobiles. The series made a comeback in 2016, fourteen years after its original run ended.

==Premise==
This series of short films center on a nameless protagonist, known as &quot;The Driver&quot; (Clive Owen), who is a highly-proficient professional driver of BMW automobiles. The plot of each film varies, but all involve the Driver being hired to perform tasks for various clients, typically to transport important individuals and/or cargo while evading pursuing antagonists.

==Summary==

===Season 1===

====&quot;Ambush&quot;====
While escorting an elderly man in the middle of the night, the Driver is confronted by a van full of armed thieves and is told that the old man is carrying a large amount of diamonds. The old man claims to have swallowed the diamonds and that the men will likely cut him open to retrieve them. The Driver decides to save his client and attempts to evade the van while being shot at. The Driver eventually baits the thieves into dying in a collision with a parked bulldozer. The Driver delivers the old man to his destination and asks if he really swallowed the diamonds. The client merely chuckles and walks away before the Driver departs.
* Starring Tomas Milian

====&quot;Chosen&quot;====
The Driver is hired to protect an Asian holy child who is brought to America by boat. The child gives the Driver a gift, but tells him not to open it yet. After being pursued by kidnappers and being grazed in the ear by a gunshot, he successfully delivers the boy to a waiting monk. However, the child signals silently to the Driver that the man is an imposter, indicated by his footwear, just visible under his robe. The impostor monk tries to kidnap the child, but the Driver thwarts him and rescues the boy. Before leaving, the Driver opens the gift, which is revealed to be an adhesive bandage for his bleeding ear.

====&quot;The Follow&quot;====

The Driver is hired by a nervous manager to spy on a paranoid actor&#x27;s wife. The Driver narrates while following the wife, describing the right methods to survey someone, as well as his fear of what he might learn of the wife&#x27;s tragic life. He eventually discovers the wife is fleeing the country to return to her mother in Brazil, and that she&#x27;s been given a black eye—likely by her husband. The Driver returns the job&#x27;s money to the manager, refuses to tell him where the wife is, and tells him to never call him again before driving off.

They eventually arrive at the venue, where she is thrown out of the car and photographed by paparazzi in an embarrassing end on the red carpet.

====&quot;Powder Keg&quot;====
In a war-torn Latin-American country, war photographer Harvey Jacobs witnesses a massacre and is wounded trying to escape. The UN assigns the Driver to rescue Jacobs from hostile territory. Jacobs tells the Driver about the horrors he saw as a photographer, and his regrets for being unable to help any victims. He gives the Driver the film needed for a &quot;New York Times&quot; story and his dog tags, which are to be given to his mother. When they reach the border they are confronted by a guard, who becomes hostile when Jacobs is taking pictures and refuses to stop. The Driver drives through a hail of gunfire towards safety, but finds Jacobs has died in the escape. The Driver returns to America to visit Jacobs&#x27; mother, returning his dog tags and telling her that Jacobs had won the Pulitzer Prize.

===Season 2===

====&quot;Hostage&quot;====
The Driver is hired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to help defuse a hostage situation. A disgruntled employee has kidnapped a CEO and has hidden her, demanding $5,088,042 for her release. The Driver delivers the money, writing the sum on his hand as instructed by the hostage taker, and is then ordered to burn the money. As he complies, the federal agents break in and attempt to subdue the man, who shoots himself in the head without revealing the woman&#x27;s location. The Driver surmises the ransom amount is actually the woman&#x27;s cellphone number, and tracks her location to the trunk of a sinking car. The woman is rescued and brought to the hospital to confront the kidnapper. It is revealed that she and the kidnapper were actually lovers, and the woman coldly tells the kidnapper she only used him for sex before he dies.

====&quot;Ticker&quot;====
In an unnamed foreign country, a man carrying a mysterious briefcase survives an ambush en route to his destination. The Driver rescues and escorts the man while under helicopter attack. During the chase, the briefcase is struck by a bullet, causing it to leak grey fluid and the number on its display to begin counting down. The Driver manages to cause the helicopter to crash, but refuses to proceed without knowing the contents of the damaged briefcase. It is revealed that the man guards a human heart that is to be transplanted into the nation&#x27;s leader, who has brought peace and prosperity to the country for many years. Should he die, his heir will be a tyrannical army General, whose soldiers had been attempting to stop them the entire time. The Driver finally reaches a military base and brings the heart to waiting surgeons, who successfully save the leader from dying. The General tries to intervene, but realizes he has failed and decides to leave with his men.

====&quot;Beat the Devil&quot;====
The Driver is employed by James Brown, who goes to meet the Devil to re-negotiate the deal he made as a young man, in which he traded his soul for fame and fortune. James is worried about his aging and the fact he can no longer perform like he used to. To renew his contract, James proposes that they have a drag race on the Las Vegas Strip at dawn, wagering the Driver&#x27;s soul for another 50 years of success. The race ends with the Driver swerving to pass a moving train, while the Devil&#x27;s car (a flamed Pontiac Firebird) crashes and explodes. Having won the race, the Driver leaves James Brown in the desert, but as he drives away he sees him as a young man again. The final scene shows Marilyn Manson, who lives down the hall from the Devil, complaining that the noise is disturbing his Bible reading. 
* Starring James Brown, Gary Oldman, and Danny Trejo
* Cameo by Marilyn Manson
* Directed by Tony Scott
* Written by David Carter, Greg Hahn and Vincent Ngo
* Featured the BMW Z4 3.0i

===&quot;The Subplot Films&quot;===
Four smaller movies, dubbed &quot;The Subplot Movies&quot; were shot and directed by Ben Younger. Lacking any real style (and appearing to be shot with a standard consumer-level DV-cam), they were designed to &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; between the five films and featured a man who appeared to be tracking the Driver, finding &quot;clues&quot; usually scribbled, in pen, on small pieces of paper. The films, at first glance, have no real connection to the Driver movies at all and made no real sense – they contained &quot;clues&quot; that were part of an alternate reality game that would lead intuitive fans to a party in Las Vegas, Nevada.

===Season 3===

====&quot;The Escape&quot;====

After the disappearance of geneticist Dr. Nora Phillips, the Molecular Genetics company&#x27;s illegal activities in human cloning become exposed and the FBI raids the facility. One surviving specimen, Lily, is escorted by a ruthless mercenary named Holt to be delivered to an unknown client. The Driver is hired to transport the package with Holt accompanying him, along with an armed convoy of other mercenaries. When the Driver realizes that Lily possesses humanity, he forces Holt to get out of the car. The Driver thwarts Holt and his mercenaries in a pursuit and then drives the girl to a harbor, where she is happily reunited with Dr. Phillips—the unknown client that hired the Driver.
* Starring Jon Bernthal, Dakota Fanning, and Vera Farmiga
* Directed by Neill Blomkamp
* Written by Neill Blomkamp and David Carter
* Featured the BMW 5 Series (G30)

==Production==
BMW&#x27;s idea for the series came from the fact that 85% of its customers shop online before purchasing their cars. If BMW could attract the right kind of traffic to their website, the type of person who enjoys art films from influential directors and actors, they could translate that into sales. BMW stated that John Frankenheimer&#x27;s film &quot;Ronin&quot; served as creative inspiration for &quot;The Hire&quot; series.

On April 26, 2001, John Frankenheimer&#x27;s &quot;Ambush&quot; premiered on the BMW Films website and, two weeks later, was followed by Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Chosen&quot;. Soon after, director Wong Kar-Wai was tapped to make a third film entitled &quot;The Follow&quot;, a dramatic piece about a runaway wife being followed by &quot;the Driver&quot;. The films debuted at the Cannes Film Festival and received mixed reviews, perhaps due to the films&#x27; purpose as advertising. It was followed by Guy Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Star&quot; and Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s &quot;Powder Keg&quot;.

After the series began, BMW saw their 2001 sales increase 12% from the previous year. The movies were viewed over 11 million times in four months. Two million people registered with the website and a large majority of users, registered to the site, sent film links to their friends and family. The series was originally created by members of famed indie New York City film studio – Shooting Gallery – such as CJ Follini, Paul Speaker, and Eamonn Bowles.

The films were so popular that BMW produced a free DVD for customers who visited certain BMW dealerships. Due to demand, BMW ran out of DVDs. In September, BMW and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine collaborated to distribute a second DVD edition of &quot;The Hire&quot; in the magazine. The &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; disc did not include Wong Kar-Wai&#x27;s &quot;The Follow&quot;. Forest Whitaker had an uncredited part in &quot;The Follow&quot; and had only agreed to be in the film if it were shown exclusively on the Internet. When the movie was released on DVD, Whitaker allegedly exercised an option in his contract which stipulated that the movie would not be released in any other format without authorization from the actor himself. The &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; disc, in lieu of carrying &quot;The Follow&quot;, contained a link to the website with instructions to the viewer to watch the movie online.

The DVD was highly sought on Internet forums after the September 2001 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; quickly vanished from shelves and became a rare find. The movies were reviewed by &quot;Time Magazine&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who praised BMW for creating entertaining content for &quot;discerning movie watchers&quot;.

The series continued in October 2002, replacing producer David Fincher with Ridley and Tony Scott due to Fincher&#x27;s continuing work on &quot;Panic Room&quot;.

Season 2 debuted with a dark action/comedy piece by Tony Scott called &quot;Beat the Devil&quot;. The movie, shot in Scott&#x27;s trademark pseudo-psychedelic style, featured James Brown enlisting the Driver to take him to Las Vegas to re-work a decades-old deal he made with the devil which evidently gave Brown his &quot;fame and fortune&quot;.

Some differences were evident. Whereas the first season was serious and subdued with tiny bursts of action and comedy, the second season was all flash and fun. To fit this motif, John Woo and Joe Carnahan were hired to direct &quot;Hostage&quot; and &quot;Ticker&quot;, respectively. The other main difference was that, instead of showcasing several different BMW cars (like the first season had done), the only car showcased was the then-new BMW Z4 Roadster.

To celebrate the premiere of the second season, BMW threw a party at the ArcLight Hollywood on October 17, 2002, just a week before the film&#x27;s internet debut. The party, co-hosted by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, was also a charity and benefit for the homeless.

A month after the premiere of &quot;Beat the Devil&quot;, DirecTV began airing the entire series in half-hour loops for five weeks, on one of the blank satellite channels the system offered. The films were a success and, as a result, DirecTV considered using blank channels to air other companies&#x27; ads.

In 2003, BMW decided to make a third (and final) DVD compilation of &quot;The Hire&quot;. The new DVD made its debut at The Palais des Festival during the 2003 Cannes Film Festival and contained all eight movies, including Wong Kar-Wai&#x27;s previously absent &quot;The Follow&quot;. Once again, the disc became available at select dealerships but fans could also obtain the disc for a nominal shipping fee via the BMW Films website.

During the last quarter of 2004, Dark Horse Comics and BMW planned to publish a 6-issue comic book limited series based on the main character of the films. The books were written by Kurt Busiek, Bruce Campbell, Katsuhiro Otomo, and Mark Waid as well as other comic book talents. Only four books were produced. &quot;Tycoon&quot; was the last book released (in December 2005). While the comics are still able to be purchased in collector shops and some comic book stores, they are no longer available for purchase on the BMW website.

On October 21, 2005, BMW stopped distribution of &quot;The Hire&quot; on DVD and removed all eight films from the BMW Films website just four years after the first film debuted. The series was abandoned, reportedly because the project had become too expensive. BMW&#x27;s Vice President of Marketing James McDowell, originator of the BMW Films project, left BMW to become the VP of sales and marketing for BMW&#x27;s &quot;Mini USA&quot; division. BMW also split from longtime ad partner Fallon Worldwide which was the creative production outlet for the series and BMW&#x27;s German division had attempted to become involved with the US division of the company, cutting costs.

The series was viewed over 100 million times in four years and had changed the way products were advertised.

Copies of the DVD are still found in Internet shops and auction sites. The films themselves continue to appear on many torrent searches and viral video sites around the Internet.

In early 2006, BMW released a line of free &quot;BMW Audiobooks&quot; to take advantage of the growing popularity of portable MP3 players (and the fact that most BMW&#x27;s came with an iPod dock pre-installed in their vehicles). While the stories had the same pulp-action feel as &quot;The Hire&quot;, the character of &quot;the Driver&quot; was absent. The audiobooks were free (like the films that preceded them) but are no longer available for download from the BMW website.

On February 17, 2007, MINI (BMW) launched a new short film series called &quot;Hammer &amp; Coop&quot;. The series is a comedic parody of 1970s action-television shows like &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, and showcases BMW&#x27;s Mini Cooper line of cars as the featured product.

On September 20, 2016, it was reported that BMW Films has resurrected the series fourteen years after the original production wrapped, with Clive Owen returning to reprise his role as the Driver. The first episode was revealed to be titled &quot;The Escape&quot;, which premiered on October 23, 2016, on BMW Films&#x27; official website.

In 2023 BMW released &quot;The Calm&quot;, starring Pom Klementieff and Uma Thurman. Produced by Joseph Kosinski and directed by Sam Hargrave, the new film features the BMW i7 M70.

==Contest/game &amp; party==
Shortly after the release of the &quot;Subplot Films&quot;, reports circulated around the Internet that Apple, Starbucks, BMW Films First Illinois Mortgage, and Susstones&#x27; all had a small, hidden link on their website that had a direct connection with the movies. Upon further investigation, three phone numbers and a web address were found in the four films, which led many viewers to call those numbers and go to that website.

Thousands took to the web, taking place in the hunt but only 250 solved the puzzle, which allowed the lucky few to be entered in a drawing to win a 2003 BMW Z4, seen in &quot;Hostage&quot;.

The final piece of the puzzle was a voicemail, instructing participants to meet with a correspondent in Las Vegas, the site of a VIP Party for BMW where the Grand Prize Z4 was given away to a couple from Bellingham, Washington. The first prize was a BMW Q3.s mountain bike, awarded to a student from the University of New Hampshire.

The game was designed and co-written by Mark Sandau and Russ Stark.

==Influences==
Several companies attempted to capitalize on the success of BMW&#x27;s film series.

In 2002, the Nissan produced its own short film featuring their newly introduced 350Z. Entitled &quot;The Run&quot;, the film was directed by John Bruno, a James Cameron protege who worked with Cameron on &quot;True Lies&quot;, &quot;The Abyss&quot;, and &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. The film was shown in theaters before feature films in November 2002. Nissan offered a DVD of the film for $9.95.

Mercedes-Benz followed BMW&#x27;s lead in 2002 advertising the SL 500 in &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, directed by Michael Mann and starring Benicio del Toro. In 2004, Mercedes released &quot;The Porter&quot;, a 15-minute film by director Jan Wentz, starring Max Beesley and Bryan Ferry.

A few years later, Bombardier Recreational Products company introduced a series of short movies on the Internet which showcased their &quot;Sea-Doo&quot; line of personal water craft (PWC) while Covad Business also constructed a campy internet horror film based on their products called &quot;The Ringing&quot; with the intent of showcasing VoIP technology.

&quot;The Transporter&quot; was also based on &quot;The Hire&quot; film series as Luc Besson has said in interviews. In fact, many of the elements seen in &quot;The Hire&quot; were incorporated into &quot;The Transporter&quot;, right down to the BMW automobile.

Around the same time &quot;The Hire&quot; made its comeback in October 2016, the Ford Motor Company produced its very own short film, advertising their new car, the 2015 Ford Edge incorporated into a story, starring Mads Mikkelsen as the titular character in &quot;Le Fantôme&quot;, directed by Jake Scott, who co-produced the second season of &quot;The Hire&quot;.

<text>Vaikuntha (), also called Vishnuloka (), and Tirunatu (Tirunāṭu) in Tamil, is the abode of Vishnu, the supreme deity in the Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism, and his consort, Lakshmi, the supreme goddess of the sect.

According to Ramanuja, Vaikuntha is the &quot;Parama Padam&quot; or &quot;Nitya Vibhuti,&quot; an &quot;eternal heavenly realm&quot;, and is the &quot;divine imperishable world that is God&#x27;s abode&quot;. In Vaishnava literature, Vaikuntha is described as the highest realm above the fourteen &quot;lokas&quot; (worlds), and the place where the devotees of Vishnu go upon achieving liberation. It is guarded by the twin deities, Jaya and Vijaya, the dvarapalakas, or gatekeepers of Vaikuntha. The army of Vishnu, stationed at Vaikuntha, is led by Vishvaksena. The planets of Vaikuntha are described as being full of golden palaces and hanging gardens that grow fragrant fruits and flowers.

The planets of Vaikuntha begins 26,200,000 yojanas (209,600,000 miles) above Satyaloka. This does not refer to the physical distance. In most of the extant Puranas and Vaishnava traditions, Vaikuntha is located in the direction of the &quot;Makara rashi,&quot; which corresponds with the Capricorn constellation. One version of the cosmology states that Vishnu&#x27;s eye is present at the south celestial pole, from where he watches the cosmos.

== Literature ==
=== Vedas ===
The Vedas do not mention Vaikuntha, but a verse in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; mentions Vishnu&#x27;s feet as a potential abode:

=== Bhagavata Purana ===
Vaikuntha and its characteristics are described in the Bhagavata Purana, a revered text in Vaishnavism, which was composed between the eighth and the tenth century CE, and maybe as early as the 6th century CE.

American Indologist Edwin Bryant, in his book from 2003, comments about the verses describing Vaikuntha in the text of Bhagavata Purana:

Translation of some verses in Canto 2, by Bibek Debroy:
 


 




It is also said that Vaikuntha is the liberated world or the world after moksha.

=== Narayana Upanishad ===
The Narayana Upanishad mentions the abode:

=== Brihad Bhagavatamrita ===
The Brihad Bhagavatamrita paints a picture of Vishnu&#x27;s activities at Vaikuntha:
=== Tiruvaymoli ===
In the work of Nammalvar, Vaikuntha is referred to as &quot;Tirunatu&quot; (sacred land) in the Tamil literary tradition. In Sri Vaishnava tradition, this abode is listed as the one hundred and eighth, and the last of the Divya Desams, the divine realms of Vishnu on earth and beyond. The verses of the Tiruvaymoli describe this abode as the following:

<text>The Brothel in Rosenstrasse is a 1982 novel by Michael Moorcock. The main character is Rickhardt von Bek, a member of the family of Ulrich von Bek which is central to some of Moorcock&#x27;s other fantasy novels, notably &quot;The War Hound and the World&#x27;s Pain&quot;, &quot;The City in the Autumn Stars&quot;, and &quot;The Dragon in the Sword&quot;. The novel is written as Bek&#x27;s memoir of a dying, demented man, in which he recalls his time with a bi-sexual teenage nymphet girl and how they take refuge in a superior brothel in a German city under siege during a 19th-century war. The standard German spelling of the name in the novel&#x27;s title is &quot;Rosenstraße&quot; (Street of Roses).

Unlike other Bek stories, this novel is not a fantasy, though John Clute refers to it as &quot;a fantasy of sexual torment set in a very slightly displaced Europe.&quot; Although it takes place in a fictitious location—the free city of Mirenburg, capital of a similarly fictitious independent state bordering Germany called Waldenstein—it is otherwise realistic in content. Moorcock describes Mirenburg as &quot;an attempt to produce an ideal middle European city&quot;, and it is believed to be based partly on Prague.

Moorcock also recorded and released a single called &quot;Brothel in Rosenstrasse&quot;. The song was included as a bonus track on the Griffin Records rerelease of the Michael Moorcock and Deep Fix album &quot;The New Worlds Fair&quot;.

<text>Michael Allen &quot;Mac&quot; Collins (October 15, 1944 – November 20, 2018) was an American businessman and politician. He was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005, representing (previously from 1993 to 2003). In 2004, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate.

==Early life==
Collins was born in Jackson, Georgia, and joined a concrete products business run by his father after graduating from high school, eventually expanding it into a ready-mix concrete company. His mother was the first woman to serve on the Flovilla, Georgia, city council. He attended public schools throughout his youth. He served in the Georgia Army National Guard from 1964 to 1970.

==Georgia politics and State Senator==
Collins began his political career in 1977, when he was elected to the Butts County Commission. He was immediately elected chairman by his colleagues and served two terms, giving up his seat in 1980 when he switched his party affiliation from Democratic to Republican. After losing two elections for Georgia State Senate, he was elected in 1988 from a district in Henry County south of Atlanta and served two terms there.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

=== Electoral history ===
During the 1990s round of redistricting, Democrats in the Georgia state legislature, bent on getting rid of Newt Gingrich, dismantled his old 6th District. The new map shifted much of Gingrich&#x27;s former territory south of Atlanta—including Collins&#x27;s home—to the 3rd District, which at the time was based in Columbus and represented by five-term Democrat Richard Ray.

Collins immediately jumped into the race. In 1992, he defeated Paul Broun (who would later be elected to Congress from the 10th District) in the Republican primary and then defeated Ray in the general election by almost 10 points.

In 1994, Collins defeated Democrat Fred Overby 66%-34%.

In 1996, he defeated Democrat Jim Chafin 61%-39%.

In 1998, he ran unopposed for reelection.

In 2000, he defeated Democrat Gail Notti 63%-37%.

After the 2000 redistricting cycle, Collins was placed in the 8th District. In 2002, he easily won re-election by the widest margin of his career over Democrat Angelos Petrakopoulos, 78%-22%.

In 2004, he declined to run for re-election, opting to run for U.S. Senate. Lynn Westmoreland succeeded him representing the 8th District.

=== Congressional Record ===
In the United States House of Representatives, Collins was a member of the Ways and Means Committee, Deputy Whip for the Republican Party, and was selected by the Speaker of the House to serve on the highly-classified United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He lost his role as Deputy Whip of the United States House of Representatives after the September 11 attacks in 2001 when he informed President George W. Bush that he would not support the creation of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

Collins was a sponsor in the passage of two bills. The first, H.R. 1121, designated the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 18 Greenville Street in Newnan, Georgia, as the “Lewis R. Morgan Federal Building and United States Courthouse”. The second, H.R. 1316, amended chapter 87 of title 5, United States Code, with respect to the order of precedence to be applied in the payment of life insurance benefits.

Collins was focused on commerce, tax reform, foreign trade and international finance, and technology legislation.

==Later political career==
===2004 United States Senate campaign===

In 2004, Collins was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate seat left vacant by the retirement of Senator Zell Miller; it went to Johnny Isakson, who won the Republican primary. With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Isakson had 53% of votes, followed by Herman Cain with 26% and Collins with 21%. Isakson went on to win the general election against Democratic Congresswoman Denise Majette.

===2006 campaign for U.S. House of Representatives===
In 2006, Collins moved back to Butts County and made an attempt to return to Congress against Democrat Jim Marshall. This district included none of the territory Collins represented in his first five terms, but three counties that he represented in his last after a mid-decade Republican redistricting. It made for one of the most competitive House races in the nation. he race featured heavy spending, not only by the candidates themselves, but from independent groups. During the campaign, President George W. Bush attended a rally to try to help Collins. Marshall narrowly won reelection by 1,700 votes, 50.5%–49.5%.

==Personal life and death==
Collins was a Christian and was married to his wife for 54 years. They had four children including Mike Collins who is a U.S. representative for Georgia&#x27;s 10th congressional district.

Collins died on November 20, 2018, in Flovilla, Georgia, at age 74.

<doc id="411795" wikidata="Q10926413" url="?curid=411795" title="Soil type">
<text>A soil type is a taxonomic unit in soil science. All soils that share a certain set of well-defined properties form a distinctive soil type. Soil type is a technical term of soil classification, the science that deals with the systematic categorization of soils. Every soil of the world belongs to a certain soil type. Soil type is an abstract term. In nature, you will not find soil types. You will find soils that belong to a certain soil type.

In hierarchical soil classification systems, soil types mostly belong to the higher or intermediate level. A soil type can normally be subdivided into subtypes, and in many systems several soil types can be combined to entities of higher category. However, in the first classification system of the United States (Whitney, 1909), the soil type was the lowest level and the mapping unit.

For the definition of soil types, some systems use primarily such characteristics that are the result of soil-forming processes (pedogenesis). An example is the German soil systematics. Other systems combine characteristics resulting from soil-forming processes and characteristics inherited from the parent material. Examples are the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) and the USDA soil taxonomy. Other systems do not ask whether the properties are the result of soil formation or not. An example is the Australian Soil Classification.

A convenient way to define a soil type is referring to soil horizons. However, this is not always possible because some very initial soils may not even have a clear development of horizons. For other soils, it may be more convenient to define the soil type just referring to some properties common to the whole soil profile. For example, WRB defines the Arenosols by their sand content. Many soils are more or less strongly influenced by human activities. This is reflected by the definition of many soil types in various classification systems.

Because soil type is a very general and widely used term, many soil classification systems do not use it for their definitions. The USDA soil taxonomy has six hierarchical levels that are named order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series. The WRB calls the first level Reference Soil Group. The second level in WRB is constructed by adding qualifiers, and for the result (the Reference Soil Group plus the qualifiers), no taxonomic term is used.

<doc id="411799" wikidata="Q507092" url="?curid=411799" title="Charlie Norwood">
<text>Charles Whitlow Norwood Jr. (July 27, 1941 – February 13, 2007) was an American politician who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 until his death in 2007. At the time of his death, Norwood was the representative of the 10th District of Georgia.

==Early life and education==
Born in Valdosta, Georgia, Norwood graduated from Baylor School, then a military academy, in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He then attended Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, Georgia and Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Before entering the House, Norwood operated a successful dentistry practice in Augusta.

He married his wife, Gloria, in 1962. They had two sons, Charles and Carlton, and lived in Evans, Georgia; a suburb of Augusta. Norwood was a Methodist.

==Military service==
Norwood served as a captain in the United States Army from 1967 to 1969, beginning with an assignment to the U.S. Army Dental Corps at Sandia Army Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1968 he was transferred to the Medical Company (Company B-Med) of the 173rd Airborne Brigade in South Vietnam, and served a combat tour at Qui Nhon, An Khe and LZ English. During his tour, he participated in experimental military dental practices that are now standard procedure for the armed forces. Norwood was one of the first participants in the Army&#x27;s outreach program that delivered dentists to forward firebases in lieu of transferring patients to rear treatment areas. He provided some of the first field-based dental treatment of military guard dogs, and assisted in non-dental trauma care in Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals.

In recognition of his service under combat conditions, Norwood was awarded the Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars. After Vietnam, Norwood was assigned to the Dental Corps at Fort Gordon, Georgia, where he served until his discharge in 1969. He remained a member of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Military Order of the World Wars until his death.

==Congressional campaigns==

In late 1993, Norwood sold his dental practice to run for Congress in the 1994 elections as a Republican in the Augusta-based 10th District. In that election, he routed freshman Democratic incumbent Clete Donald Johnson Jr. by 31-point margin—one of the largest margins of defeat of the 1994 election cycle. He became the first Republican to represent his northeastern Georgia district since Reconstruction.

Norwood was nearly defeated in 1996, winning by only four points. He easily turned back spirited challenges in 1998 and 2000. However, in the 2000s round of redistricting, the Democratic-controlled state legislature crafted a congressional map designed to elect seven Democrats and six Republicans; at the time Georgia&#x27;s congressional delegation consisted of eight Republicans and five Democrats. In the process, the legislature renumbered Norwood&#x27;s district as the 9th District and shifted most of Augusta—which had been the heart of the district and its predecessors for over a century—to the newly created 12th District. To make up for the loss in population, Norwood&#x27;s district picked up some more Republican territory in the North Georgia mountains. Norwood was reelected from this now heavily Republican district with 73 percent of the vote.

In 2004, Norwood received 74 percent of the vote against Democrat Bob Ellis. In 2006, his district was renumbered the 10th once again, and was pushed slightly to the west, absorbing Athens in the process. Athens was home to Democratic 12th District Congressman John Barrow, and Barrow was forced to move to Savannah rather than face certain defeat. Norwood was handily reelected, taking 68 percent of the vote against Democrat Terry Holley.

===Potential bids for higher office===
While Norwood was speculated as a potential candidate for Governor of Georgia in 2002 and United States Senate in 2004, he declined to run in either race, citing his health issues.

==Congressional career==

Norwood was a staunch supporter of tight immigration control, and &quot;called for putting nearly 40,000 troops on the U.S.-Mexico border. He co-wrote a provision to the recent Deficit Reduction Act that bars illegal aliens from getting Medicaid.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote the following in a summary of his career:

Norwood regarded the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which requires certain jurisdictions to obtain federal approval before enacting changes to their election laws, as &quot;blatant discrimination&quot; against the targeted states. He opposed changing Georgia&#x27;s state flag to one with less overt Confederate imagery.

==Illness and death==
In 1998, Norwood was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, something he initially kept secret. In October 2004, he underwent a single lung transplant due to the condition. A year after the transplant, a cancerous tumor was found on Norwood&#x27;s non-transplanted lung, and he underwent chemotherapy. By December 2006, the cancer had spread to his liver. The disease was believed to be caused by the immunosuppressants Norwood had to take due to the lung transplant. After the reconvening of Congress in January 2007, Norwood missed most of the sessions due to weakness from the chemotherapy.
During the State of the Union address on January 23, 2007, President George W. Bush noted Congressman Norwood&#x27;s absence from the Hall of the House and extended his thoughts for a speedy recovery.

On February 7, Norwood&#x27;s office announced that he was forgoing further treatment for his cancer, and would be returning to Augusta in order to receive in-home hospice care.

Norwood died nearly one week later, on February 13. At approximately 2:02 PM Eastern time on the day of his death, a few moments of silence were observed for Norwood on the House floor. This moment of silence was repeated at 2:21 PM, at the behest of a delegation of Congressmen from Georgia. Norwood was survived by his wife, 2 children, and 4 grandchildren. President Bush said that he and his wife Laura were saddened by Norwood&#x27;s death. &quot;Charlie was a good friend and a strong, spirited legislator who always stuck to his principles, remembering that his duty was to represent the best interests of the citizens of his district,&quot; the President said in a written statement released by the White House.

In tribute to his life and service, The Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Augusta, GA was rededicated to bear his name. On January 15, 2008, the center officially became known as the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center.

<doc id="411800" wikidata="Q16972671" url="?curid=411800" title="Climacteric year">
<text>In Ancient Greek philosophy and astrology, the climacterics (, from the Greek , &quot;klimaktērikós&quot;) were certain purportedly critical years in a person&#x27;s life, marking turning points.

==Historic use==
According to the astrologers, the person would see some very notable alterations to the body, and be at a great risk of death during these years. Authors on the subject include the following: Plato, Cicero, Macrobius, Aulus Gellius, among the ancients; as well as Argol, Maginus, and Salmasius. Augustine, Ambrose, Bede, and Boetius all countenanced the belief.

The first climacteric occurs in the seventh year of a person&#x27;s life; the rest are multiples of the first, such as 21, 49, 56, and 63. The &quot;grand climacteric&quot; usually refers to the 63rd year, with the dangers here being supposedly more imminent; but may refer to the 49th (7 × 7) or the 81st (9 × 9).

The belief has a great deal of antiquity on its side. Aulus Gellius says that it was borrowed from the Chaldeans. Pythagoras, basing his philosophy (Pythagoreanism) on numbers, imagined an extraordinary virtue in the number 7.

These turning points were viewed as changes from one kind of life, and attitude toward life, to another in the mind of the subject: the &quot;locus classicus&quot; is Ptolemy, &quot;Tetrabiblos&quot; C204–207, which in turn gave rise to Shakespeare&#x27;s delineation of the Seven Ages of Man.

They were also viewed, logically within the framework of ancient medicine and its ties to astrology, as dangerous years from a medical standpoint. In this sense, the word has been used by medicine of more recent times; in the 16th through the 18th centuries, it often refers to the day on which a fever was thought to break (see quartan fever, quintan fever).

Marsilius Ficinus gives a foundation for the belief: he states that there is a year assigned for each planet to rule over the body of man, each in his turn. Now, Saturn being the most malefic planet of all, every seventh year, which falls to his lot, becomes very dangerous; especially that of 63, since the person is already of old age.

Some hold, according to this doctrine, every seventh year to be an established climacteric; but others only allow the title to those years produced by the multiplication of the climacterical space by an odd number, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. Others observe every ninth year as a climacteric, in which case the 81st year is the &quot;grand climacteric&quot;. Some also believed that the climacteric years are also fatal to political bodies and governments.

The Roman emperor Augustus refers to having passed his own grand climacteric, about which he had been apprehensive.

The astronomer Johannes Hevelius wrote a volume under the title &quot;Annus climactericus&quot; (1685), describing the loss he sustained in the burning of his observatory in 1679, which he considered climacteric because it was 49 years after the beginning of his observing career.

The legacy of these climacteric years is still with us to some extent: the age of reason is often taken to be when a child reaches 7, and in many countries the age of full adulthood is taken as 21.

For astrologers, the discovery of the planet Uranus in 1781 confirmed what may have originated as the mundane observations of the ancients on living things. Uranus has an orbital period of 84 years, which divides into four periods of 21 years each. Astrologers take Uranus as the bringer of abrupt changes, so when it forms a square or 90 degree relationship with its original position in a nativity at age 21, this brings the change from irresponsible youth to responsible adulthood. The opposition occurs at age 42, traditionally the time of midlife crisis. Thus the second square at age 63, the climacteric, would be the most dangerous for the ancients who rarely lived long enough to see the conjunction (return to the natal position) at age 84. This combination of the periods of Saturn and Uranus are powerful indicators of life changes for astrologers.

<doc id="411803" wikidata="Q179732" url="?curid=411803" title="Nathan Deal">
<text>John Nathan Deal (born August 25, 1942) is an American politician and former lawyer who served as the 82nd governor of Georgia from 2011 to 2019. A Republican, he previously served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Deal served in the Georgia State Senate from 1981 to 1993, the last two years as president pro tempore of the senate. He faced a crowded field of candidates in the Republican primary when he ran for governor in 2010, ultimately facing former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel in a tightly contested primary runoff election, and won by fewer than 2,500 votes. In the general election, Deal defeated the Democratic opponent, former governor Roy Barnes, and succeeded term-limited Sonny Perdue in 2011. He won his re-election campaign for governor in 2014 against Democrat Jason Carter.

Deal came to prominence in 2014 when he signed into law the Safe Carry Protection Act, known by critics as the &quot;Guns Everywhere Law&quot;, which allows residents with a permit to carry a concealed weapon to bring firearms into most public areas, including churches, school zones, government buildings and certain sections of airports. He was barred by term limits in 2018 and was succeeded by outgoing Secretary of State Brian Kemp.

==Early life and career==
Deal was born on August 25, 1942, in the town of Millen and grew up on a farm in Sandersville, Georgia. His parents, Mary (née Mallard) and Noah Jordan Deal, were teachers.

He attended Mercer University in Macon, where he earned his bachelor and law degrees with honors. After he earned his Juris Doctor degree in 1966, he joined the United States Army, where he earned the rank of captain.

Deal spent twenty-three years in private law practice. He was also a criminal prosecutor, a Hall County juvenile court judge, and a Northeastern Judicial Circuit superior court judge. In 1980, he was elected to the Georgia State Senate as a Democrat.

In November 1990, he was elected by his party to be the President Pro Tempore, the second highest ranking position in the chamber. Democrat Jane Hemmer replaced him in the Senate, but she was defeated by Republican Casey Cagle two years later.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1993–2010)==
===Elections===

Deal was first elected to Congress in November 1992 as a Democrat, succeeding eight-term incumbent Ed Jenkins in . He was re-elected as a Democrat in 1994.

However, on April 11, 1995, shortly after Republicans assumed control of the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years, Deal joined the Republican Party, which was led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, a fellow Georgian. Years later, Gingrich said that Deal became a Republican because he liked what he saw in the Contract With America.

Deal was handily re-elected in his first election as a Republican in the 1996 general election, even though Jenkins endorsed his Democratic opponent, attorney and state representative McCracken &quot;Ken&quot; Poston, who represented much of the congressional district&#x27;s northwestern portion. This was the first time his district had elected a Republican for a full term since Reconstruction. To date, Poston is the last Democrat to win even 30 percent of the vote in this district.

Deal was unopposed for re-election in 1998, 2002, and 2004 and defeated an underfunded Democratic candidate in 2000. His district was renumbered the 10th District in 2003, but became the 9th again after a mid-decade redistricting in 2006.

In November 2006, Deal was re-elected 77%–23%. His Democratic opponent was John Bradbury, a former elementary school teacher turned truck driver. His district, already heavily Republican, became even more Republican after the mid-decade redistricting pushed it further into the Atlanta suburbs.

===Tenure===
Deal&#x27;s voting record was relatively moderate in his first term, getting ratings in the 60s from the American Conservative Union (ACU). He moved sharply to the right after his party switch and voted for all four articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton. From 1996 onward, he garnered ratings of 90 or higher from the ACU.

During his 17 years in Congress, Deal rose to chair the Health Subcommittee of Energy and Commerce, where he became a noted expert on entitlement reform and health care policy.

Deal introduced H.R. 698, the Citizenship Reform Act, which would eliminate birthright citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the U.S. The 14th Amendment begins &quot;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. ... &quot; Deal&#x27;s argument is that undocumented immigrants (and their children) are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet
** Subcommittee on Health (Ranking Member)
** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations

===Recovery Services, Inc. controversy===
The Office of Congressional Ethics released a report on March 30, 2010, that concluded Deal appeared to have improperly used his office staff to pressure Georgia officials to continue the state vehicle inspection program that generated hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for his family&#x27;s auto salvage business. Deal stated: &quot;I have done nothing wrong and am not going to let this tarnish my ... record of public service.&quot;

The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE), released their investigative report (Review No. 09-1022) on March 30, 2010. The report stipulates,

Representative Nathan Deal and his business partner own Recovery Services, Inc. a/k/a Gainesville Salvage &amp; Disposal (&#x27;GSD&#x27;), located in Gainesville, Georgia ... The OCE does not take a position on Representative Deal&#x27;s motivations for inserting himself into discussions of potential modifications to a state vehicle inspection program ... The OCE reviews the facts as presented at the time of review and does not take a position on whether Representative Deal&#x27;s income from GSD was mistakenly reported as earned income since 2006 on his federal income taxes ... [F]or all the reasons stated above, the OCE Board recommends further review by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.

===Resignation from Congress===
On March 1, 2010, 29 days before the official release of the ethics report, Deal resigned his seat, which he said, excluded him from the Office of Congressional Ethics&#x27; jurisdiction. Although this seemed too coincidental for some, Deal maintained in a speech to supporters that the resignation was so that he could &quot;devote [his] full energies&quot; to the gubernatorial campaign.

Before returning to Georgia to run for governor, Deal cast his final congressional vote against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

====2011 ethics investigation====
In 2011, then Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission Executive Secretary Stacey Kalberman and Deputy Executive Secretary Sherilyn Streiker launched an ethics investigation into Deal&#x27;s campaign finances during his 2010 gubernatorial race. According to the complaint, Deal had used state campaign funds to pay legal bills stemming from a federal ethics investigation when he was in Congress, that he had personally profited from his gubernatorial campaign&#x27;s $135,000 rental of aircraft from a company he partly owned, and that he had accepted campaign contributions beyond the legal limits. The campaign also paid a total of $135,000 to consulting companies which were owned by Deal&#x27;s daughter-in-law and the father of Chris Riley, Deal&#x27;s chief of staff.

As Kalberman and Streiker were preparing to serve subpoenas to Deal, his chief of staff, and others involved in the case, Kalberman&#x27;s salary was cut by $35,000 and Streiker was ousted from her position. Soon after, Kalberman was forced to resign and was replaced by Holly LaBerge, who was recruited by the governor&#x27;s office.

On July 23, 2012, the ethics commission cleared Deal of major ethics violations while finding he made &quot;technical defects&quot; in a series of personal financial and campaign finance reports. In July 2012, Deal agreed to pay $3,350 in administrative fees to resolve violations of campaign finance and disclosure laws.

Holly LaBerge, the head of the ethics commission that cleared Deal of major ethics violations, claimed in July 2014 that Ryan Teague, Deal&#x27;s counsel, called her to say: &quot;It was not in the agency&#x27;s best interest for these cases to go to a hearing ... nor was it in their best political interest either.&quot; Deal has stated that he is &quot;not aware of any communications along those lines&quot;.

==Governor of Georgia (2011–2019)==
===2010 gubernatorial election===

Incumbent Republican Governor Sonny Perdue was term-limited in 2010. Seven candidates filed to run in the Republican primary. In the initial Republican primary in July, no candidate received the 50% threshold to win the primary outright. Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel ranked first with 34%, qualifying for the run-off election. Deal, ranked second with 23% of the vote, also qualified for the run-off election.

Candidates who didn&#x27;t qualify included State Senator Eric Johnson (20%), Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine (16%), State Senator Jeff Chapman (3%), businessman Ray McBerry (3%), and businessman Otis Putnam (0%). Deal performed the strongest in the northern part of the state, where he lives and represented in Congress. However, he also won some counties in the southern part of the state, such as Candler (30%) and Tift (24%). He won five counties with a majority including his home of Hall (64%), Dade (56%), Walker (56%), White (53%), and Stephens (53%).

The run-off election between Handel and Deal was very competitive. Deal was endorsed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, U.S. Representative Jack Kingston, and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. Handel was endorsed by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.

On August 10, Deal defeated Handel 50.2%-49.8%, a difference of just 2,519 votes. Handel performed well in the western and eastern borders of the state, as well as the counties surrounding Atlanta. She won the heavily populated Fulton County with 71%, her best performance in the state, followed by Glascock (70%) and Burke (70%). Deal&#x27;s two best counties were Taliaferro (80%) and Hall (79%).

In the general election, Deal faced former governor and state senator Roy Barnes (D) and John Monds (L). Barnes previously won the 1998 gubernatorial election with 52% of the vote, and lost re-election in 2002 to State Senator Sonny Perdue 51%-46%. Perdue was the first Georgia Republican Governor since Reconstruction.

Barnes has always been considered a moderate. After he lost re-election, he returned to practicing law for eight years until mounting a political comeback. Deal tried to connect Barnes with President Barack Obama. Barnes said &quot;if you would listen to what is being said, you would have thought that this is an election for president of the United States.&quot; Barnes also tried to distance himself from Obama, saying his health care law was &quot;the greatest failure of political leadership in my lifetime&quot;. On November 3, Deal defeated Barnes 53%-43%.

===2014 gubernatorial election===

Deal ran for re-election in 2014. He defeated two primary challengers and defeated Democratic State Senator Jason Carter in the general election with 53% of the vote to Carter&#x27;s 45%.
===Inauguration===
Deal took office as governor on January 10, the second Monday of 2011. His second inauguration took place on January 12, 2015.

===Supreme Court expansion===
As Governor, Deal expanded the Supreme Court, adding two more justices to the court.

===Immigration===
In 2011, despite protests outside his office and threats of boycotts, Deal signed Georgia HB 87 into law, which increased the state&#x27;s enforcement powers in regards to illegal immigration, as well as required many employers to determine whether their newly hired employees are undocumented immigrants or not.

===Criminal justice reform===
In 2011, Georgia was in the midst of a criminal justice crisis. The prison population had doubled in the past two decades to 56,000, along with the state&#x27;s incarceration budget. The recidivism rate was 30 percent for adults and 65 percent for juveniles. In response, Deal commissioned the Georgia Criminal Justice Reform Council, tasked with performing an exhaustive review of the state&#x27;s current system, identifying key areas of focus and providing recommendations for reforms. These areas included increased funding and support for accountability courts, overhauling the juvenile justice system, and implementing prisoner re-entry initiatives. The council&#x27;s work resulted in bipartisan legislation that caused Georgia to avoid the need for 5,000 additional prison beds over 5 years and saved taxpayers at least $264 million. A 2014 study showed that &quot;prison sentences imposed on African-American offenders have dropped by 20 percent.&quot;

On April 25, 2013, Deal signed HB 349 into law, which enacted a second round of criminal justice reforms. These reforms took a &quot;smart on crime&quot; approach and were based on recommendations from the Special Council on Criminal Justice Reform. This law gave those who, while locked up, have earned money toward college in the form of a HOPE Scholarship G-E-D Voucher the ability to use that money up to two years after their release. In addition, Deal reinvested $5 million to create a voluntary grant program that gives communities incentives to offer judges more non-confinement sentencing options. These could include substance abuse treatment or family counseling.

With the help of the Council and the Vera Institute of Justice, Deal developed extensive performance measures to track the success of previous reforms to ensure they were enhancing public safety and saving taxpayer dollars. &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; reported, &quot;Since 2007 alone, more than three-dozen such courts have opened their doors across Georgia. In the first quarter of 2014, more than 4,100 offenders were enrolled in the state&#x27;s 105 accountability courts, and many of these participants would likely be in prison without this alternative.&quot;

On April 25, 2014, Deal announced the creation of the Governor&#x27;s Interfaith Council, composed of religious leaders across Georgia, to expand upon recent criminal justice reforms. These programs and council advisors will implement cost-effective strategies will work to increase the number of former offenders returning to the workforce and supporting their families. By removing barriers to employment, housing and education for rehabilitated offenders, a larger number of returning citizens are able to rejoin the workforce and support their families. Some of Deal&#x27;s initiatives include education and jobs training programs, &quot;banning the box&quot; and creation of the Department of Community Supervision, which streamlines re-entry programs across various state agencies.

===Safe Carry Protection Act===
In 2014, Deal signed House Bill (H.B.) 60, the Safe Carry Protection Act, referred to by critics as the &quot;Guns Everywhere&quot; Law. Deal stated that gun rights through the United States Constitution&#x27;s Second Amendment are important to people in Georgia. The Safe Carry Protection Act took effect on July 1, 2014, and permits licensed gun owners to carry guns into many public and private places, including churches, school property, bars, nightclubs, libraries, and some government buildings in Georgia. The law was supported by the Georgia Baptist Convention which included 3,600 Baptist churches in Georgia in favor of increased church autonomy, but was not supported by Catholic or Episcopalian church leaders due to their belief that it is against Jesus&#x27; teachings. By 2016, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; found that while 57% of Georgians believed that owning a gun protects people, 59% disapproved of the law itself.

===Resettlement of Syrian refugees===
In 2015 Deal issued an executive order ordering state agencies to &quot;halt any involvement in accepting refugees from Syria for resettlement in the state of Georgia&quot;, resulting in the state&#x27;s Department of Human Resources refusing to process applications for food stamps and other benefits filed by newly arrived Syrian refugees. Deal rescinded his order on January 4, 2016, after Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said Deal lacked the authority to issue it.

===Religious liberty bill veto===
On March 28, 2016, Deal vetoed a religious liberty bill that had been passed by both houses of the Georgia State Legislature, and that had been opposed by multiple large corporations, including Salesforce.com, the Coca-Cola Company and the Home Depot.

===Campus carry===
On May 3, 2016, Deal vetoed a campus carry bill that had been passed by the state legislature, after a number of state legislators refused to include exceptions for child-care centers and other places on college campuses. Had Deal signed the bill into law, it would have made concealed carrying of guns legal at every public college in Georgia, so long as the carrier was 21 or older and had a proper permit. One year later, on May 4, 2017, Deal signed a revised and stricter version of the campus carry bill into law.

Deal was succeeded as governor by Brian Kemp on January 14, 2019.

<doc id="411807" wikidata="Q3014316" url="?curid=411807" title="Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)">
<text>The Chamber of Deputies (Spanish: , ) is the lower house of the Congress of the Union, the bicameral parliament of Mexico. The other chamber is the Senate. The structure and responsibilities of both chambers of Congress are defined in Articles 50 to 70 of the Constitution.

==History==
A bicameral legislature, including the Chamber of Deputies, was established on 4 October 1824. A unicameral congress existed from 7 September 1857 to 13 November 1874.

== Elections and qualifications ==

=== Qualifications ===
Article 55 of the Mexican Constitution establishes the requirements to serve as a deputy. To be eligible, a candidate must:

* Be a Mexican citizen by birth with full legal rights.
* Be at least 18 years old on election day.
* Be a resident of, or have lived in, the state they seek to represent for at least six months prior to the election.
* Not be on active military duty or hold a police command within 90 days before the election.
* Not be a minister of any religious faith.

The article also imposes restrictions on public officials seeking election:

* Governors and the Head of Government of Mexico City cannot be elected as deputies in their respective jurisdictions during their terms, even if they resign.
* Ministers of the Supreme Court, magistrates or secretaries of the Electoral Tribunal of the Federal Judiciary, members of the General, local, or district councils of the National Electoral Institute (INE), or senior executives within INE must resign at least three years before the election.
* State secretaries, federal and local magistrates and judges, as well as municipal presidents and mayors in Mexico City, must resign at least 90 days before the election to be eligible.
* Officials holding leadership positions in autonomous constitutional bodies, as well as Secretaries or Undersecretaries of State and heads of decentralized or deconcentrated federal agencies, must also resign at least 90 days before the election.

=== Elections ===
The Chamber of Deputies comprises one federal deputy (in Spanish: &quot;diputado federal&quot;) for approximately every 250,000 citizens. The Chamber has 500 members, elected using the parallel voting system.

Of the 500 deputies, 300 are elected by plurality from single-member districts, known as federal electoral districts, with each state having at least two districts, as stipulated in Articles 52 and 53 of the Constitution. The remaining 200 deputies are assigned through proportional representation across five multi-state, 40-seat electoral regions (&quot;circunscripciones&quot;), in accordance with Articles 53 and 54. These seats, not tied to specific districts, are distributed to parties based on their share of the vote within each electoral region, serving as a counterbalance to district-based representation. Deputies are elected alongside substitutes, known as alternates, making special elections rare.

Article 59 of the Mexican Constitution allows deputies to be reelected for up to three consecutive terms, but only for the party under which they were originally elected—unless they resign from the party before the midpoint of their term. From 1917 to 2015, a constitutional ban on immediate reelection required a complete renewal of the Chamber of Deputies at each election, making it one of the few legislative bodies in the world subject to complete renewal at each election.

Elections are held every three years. Congressional elections held midway through a six-year presidential term are referred to as midterm elections.

=== Terms and reelection ===
Deputies serve three-year terms, beginning on 1 September following an election, with swearing-in typically occurring two to three days prior. Before 1933, terms lasted two years.

== Governing bodies ==

=== Board of Directors ===

The Board of Directors oversees the sessions of the Chamber of Deputies, ensuring that debates, discussions, and votes comply with the Constitution and the law. It is elected during the constitutive session on August 29, three days before the start of the legislative term following an election. The Board consists of a President, four Vice Presidents, and seven Secretaries. The President of the Chamber of Deputies serves as the Chamber&#x27;s highest authority and official representative, also assuming the role of President of the Congress of the Union during joint-sessions of the General Congress.

According to Article 17 of the Organic Law of the General Congress of the United Mexican States, each member of the Board is elected for a one-year term with the possibility of reelection. The Board is elected by a two-thirds majority, with candidates nominated by each parliamentary group.

=== Political Coordination Board ===
The Political Coordination Board (JUCOPO) is the governing body responsible for facilitating political dialogue, negotiations, and consensus-building within the Chamber of Deputies, in accordance with Article 34 of the Organic Law of the General Congress of the United Mexican States. It promotes agreements among parliamentary groups to streamline the legislative process, oversees political debates, formulates the legislative agenda, and negotiates proposals and initiatives. Additionally, it manages the Chamber’s budget, allocates resources to parliamentary groups, proposes the composition of committees, and participates in the appointment process for autonomous bodies.

Article 31 states that the JUCOPO consists of the coordinators of each parliamentary group. The presidency is held for the full three-year term by the coordinator of the party with an absolute majority; if no party holds an absolute majority, the position rotates annually among the coordinators of the three largest parliamentary groups.

=== Parliamentary groups ===
Article 27 of the Organic Law of the General Congress of the United Mexican States states that a parliamentary group consists of deputies organized according to their party affiliation. Each group must have at least five members, and only one group can exist per national political party with representation in the Chamber of Deputies. Each parliamentary group is led by a coordinator.

<text>John Phillip Gingrey (born July 10, 1942) is an American physician and former politician who served as a U.S. Representative for from 2003 to 2015. He is a member of the Republican Party (GOP). His district comprised the northwestern suburbs of Atlanta. Since leaving Congress, Gingrey has worked as a senior adviser at the District Policy Group in Washington, D.C., which is the lobbying arm of the Drinker Biddle law firm.

On March 27, 2013, Gingrey announced he would be a candidate in the 2014 race for U.S. Senate in his home state, he was unsuccessful, later losing in the May 20, 2014 Republican primary, placing fourth.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Gingrey was born and raised in Augusta, Georgia and graduated from Aquinas High School. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry from Georgia Tech in 1965, and then earned his M.D. from Medical College of Georgia. He started his 26-year practice as an obstetrician/gynecologist. While at Georgia Tech, Gingrey was a driver of the Ramblin&#x27; Wreck mascot car. He also became a member of the Gamma Alpha chapter of the Sigma Nu fraternity and was the President of the fraternity his senior year.

Gingrey entered politics when he ran for the Marietta School Board, a body of which he was three times named chairman. He served two terms as a member of the Georgia State Senate from 1999 to 2003.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

==== 2012 ====
In his final campaign for his U.S. House seat in 2012, Gingrey defeated Democrat Patrick Thompson with 68.6 percent of the vote.



==== 2010 ====
In 2010, Gingrey ran unopposed.

==== 2008 ====


==== 2006 ====


==== 2004 ====


==== 2002 ====


===Tenure===
Gingrey was one of four OB/GYNs in the House of Representatives, the other three being fellow Republicans Michael Burgess of Texas, former Congressman Ron Paul of Texas, and Phil Roe of Tennessee. He is a founding member and co-chairman of the GOP Doctors Caucus, a group of 20 health care providers in the House of Representatives. The Caucus utilizes their medical expertise to develop and advocate for patient-centered health care reforms focused on quality, access, affordability, portability, and choice.

Stephen Colbert interviewed Gingrey on his Better Know a District segment. Colbert sarcastically asked, &quot;The war in Iraq. Great War – or the greatest war?&quot; Gingrey responded that it may be the greatest war. Colbert asked Gingrey if he was a &quot;Georgia peach&quot; and Gingrey responded in the affirmative.

In 2008 Gingrey signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.

==== Bank of Ellijay ====
In November 2011, it was reported that Gingrey allegedly received stock benefits, potentially in violation of congressional ethics rules, from his role as an investor and board member of two Georgia banks. One of these banks, Bank of Ellijay, failed in September 2010 and was taken over by regulators at a cost of $60 million to taxpayers. Gingrey&#x27;s office denied any conflicts of interests. In December 2014, the House Ethics Committee publicly released findings that Gingrey had given special privilege to the Bank of Ellijay in TARP discussions, that Gingrey should not have aided the bank since it was not in his district. The committee told Gingrey: &quot;It is true that you received no compensation or financial benefits as a result of these meetings.&quot;

Gingrey&#x27;s attorney observed to the press: 

====Todd Akin for Senate campaign====

Gingrey&#x27;s office said that this comments were misconstrued after he was reported saying that former Republican representative Todd Akin was &quot;partially right&quot; in saying that a woman would not conceive after a &quot;legitimate rape.&quot; Akin had been running for the U.S. Senate from Missouri; his campaign fell apart after he said the debunked claim that &quot;the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.&quot; At a local Chamber of Commerce meeting, Gingrey said that Akin wasn&#x27;t entirely wrong. &quot;I&#x27;ve delivered lots of babies, and I know about these things,&quot; Gingrey said, according to &quot;The Marietta Daily Journal&quot;.

Gingrey has been an OB-GYN since 1975. He had served as co-chair of the GOP Doctors Caucus.

====Congressional and staff pay====
In September 2013, he received intense criticism by Republican congressional aides when he observed that many congressional aides – who initially are somewhat relatively low paid – go on to careers as major lobbyists in Washington, D.C.&#x27;s K Street area (or elsewhere) and can eventually make hundreds of thousands of dollars, implying that his own congressional salary (he said $172,000; it is actually $174,000, not including other benefits) was somehow inadequate. Meanwhile, his constituents in Georgia have a median household income of about
$49,000.

====Ebola virus concerns====
In July 2014, as concern over the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa was in the USA media, Gingrey wrote a letter to the USA CDC, stating &quot;Reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus and tuberculosis are particularly concerning.&quot;

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Environment and Economy
** Subcommittee on Health
** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations
* House Armed Services Committee
* House Science Committee
* House Rules Committee
* Committee on House Administration

===Caucus leaderships===
* GOP Doctors Caucus, co-chair 
* Immigration Reform Caucus, executive committee 
* Congressional Vision Caucus, co-chair 
* Congressional Constitution Caucus, member
* Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus, member

=== Commissioner ===
* Legislative Commissioner, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Helsinki Agreement

==2014 U.S. Senate election==

In March 2013, Gingrey officially announced he would run for the open senate seat vacated by Republican U.S. senator Saxby Chambliss. He was defeated in the Republican primary on May 20, 2014, coming in 4th in a field of eight.

== Post-political career ==
After leaving Congress, Gingrey joined The District Policy Group as a senior adviser. He writes a regular column on the firm&#x27;s website called &quot;Phil on the Hill&quot; where he writes about policy topics such as health care, the federal budget, annual appropriations, regulatory reform, and life sciences. He is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

He remains a licensed physician who practices on a volunteer basis for low-income Georgians at the Good Samaritan Clinic in Smyrna, Georgia.

=== Policy views ===

==== Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program ====
Gingrey supported the reauthorization of the federal Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which is a program that provides matching funds to states for health insurance to families with children. The program was designed to provide health insurance to uninsured children in families with incomes that are modest but too high to qualify for Medicaid. In January 2018, Congress extended the program for six years. Gingrey wrote, &quot;Reauthorizing CHIP is a smart move by Republicans to address to address the neediest and most vulnerable of our society. And why not? The recent CBO score shows that the program almost pays for itself, easing pressure off the need to find offsets.&quot;

==== Health care industry stability ====
In a &quot;Phil on the Hill&quot; column, Gingrey wrote that, &quot;Health care is by its nature a dynamic and uncertain field. Researchers are always working to pull together grants to keep the centrifuges spinning and Bunsen burners burning. Hospitals must continually untie a tangle of HR, regulatory, budgetary and technology issues while delivering quality health care. Health care providers have to develop efficient business solutions that improve the quality of care and are tailored specifically to the individual communities they serve.&quot; Tasked with a constant juggling act, Gingrey wrote, health care leaders benefit when policies from the federal government are predictable and the government itself is stable. Gingrey argued that President Trump took a step toward promoting stability with his nomination of Alex Azar as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Azar brings issue expertise, political know-how and ideas to the position, Gingrey wrote.

==== MedPAC ====
The Medicare Payment Advisory Center (MedPAC) is a nonpartisan federal advisory commission on federal government healthcare-related policy issues. Twice a year, MedPAC submits a report to Congress. It also supports the Medicare and Medicaid programs with analyses and recommendations. Gingrey supports MedPAC and has encouraged members of Congress and policymakers to utilize MedPAC&#x27;s advice.

=== Media ===
Gingrey has written several op-eds for &quot;The Hill&quot; newspaper on a wide variety of topics.

In the summer of 2016, Gingrey wrote an op-ed about the opioid epidemic occurring in the U.S. To combat the epidemic, Gingrey wrote that he favors wider access to Naloxone (commonly known by its brand name Narcan) to save people who have overdosed, supports the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) which had recently passed Congress, encourages more states to adopt the Good Samaritan laws (laws that provide immunity for those who call 911 if they are witnessing or attending to an overdose), and public awareness education campaigns.

In January 2017, shortly before Donald Trump&#x27;s inauguration, Gingrey wrote in support of Trump&#x27;s pick of Tom Price as the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Not since President George H.W. Bush picked Dr. Louis Sullivan as the 17th HHS secretary in 1989 has there been a physician at the head of HHS. Gingrey and Price served together in the Georgia State Senate before serving in the U.S. House. &quot;Through hard work, collaboration with colleagues, and levering his health policy expertise, he has earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle,&quot; Gingrey wrote about Price.

In November 2017, Gingrey penned an op-ed where he argued that the government should not interfere with the patient-physician relationship. During the debate over Obamacare, one key issue of concern for physicians serving in Congress (such as Gingrey) was the promotion and utilization of cost-effectiveness data and &quot;comparative effectiveness research&quot; (CER). &quot;We were concerned that such information would be used to support government takeover of the practice of medicine, and specifically that these types of analyses and studies would dictate decision-making to doctors,&quot; Gingrey wrote. As it turns out, he now supports the federal agency that the Affordable Care Act created that creates the CERs. He believes they are important decision-making tools for practitioners, and he supports reauthorization of the agency in 2019.

==Personal life==
Gingrey is a Roman Catholic. He is married to the former Billie Ayers of Newnan, Georgia; they have four children and 13 grandchildren.

<doc id="411811" wikidata="Q303555" url="?curid=411811" title="Hypoactive sexual desire disorder">
<text>Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), hyposexuality, or inhibited sexual desire (ISD) is sometimes considered a sexual dysfunction, and is characterized as a lack or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity, as judged by a clinician. For this to be regarded as a disorder, it must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulties and not be better accounted for by another mental disorder, a drug (legal or illegal), or some other medical condition. A person with ISD will not start, or respond to their partner&#x27;s desire for, sexual activity. HSDD affects approximately 10% of all pre-menopausal women in the United States, or about 6 million women, 1.5% of men and an unstudied amount of gender non-conforming people .

There are various subtypes. HSDD can be general (general lack of sexual desire) or situational (still has sexual desire but lacks sexual desire for current partner), and it can be acquired (HSDD started after a period of normal sexual functioning) or lifelong (the person has always had no/low sexual desire).

In the DSM-5, HSDD was split into male hypoactive sexual desire disorder and [[female sexual interest/arousal disorder]]. It was first included in the DSM-III under the name inhibited sexual desire disorder, but the name was changed in the DSM-III-R. Other terms used to describe the phenomenon include sexual aversion and sexual apathy. More informal or colloquial terms are &quot;frigidity&quot; and &quot;frigidness&quot;.

==Causes==
Low sexual desire alone is not equivalent to HSDD because of the requirement in HSDD that the low sexual desire causes marked distress and interpersonal difficulty and because of the requirement that the low desire is not better accounted for by another disorder in the DSM or by a general medical problem. It is therefore difficult to say exactly what causes HSDD. It is easier to describe, instead, some of the causes of low sexual desire.

In men, though there are theoretically more types of HSDD/low sexual desire, typically men are only diagnosed with one of three subtypes.
* Lifelong/generalised: The man has little or no desire for sexual stimulation (with a partner or alone) and never had.
* Acquired/generalised: The man previously had sexual interest in his present partner, but lacks interest in sexual activity, partnered or solitary.
* Acquired/situational: The man was previously sexually interested in his present partner but now lacks sexual interest in this partner but has desire for sexual stimulation (i.e. alone or with someone other than his present partner).

Though it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between these types, they do not necessarily have the same cause. The cause of lifelong/generalized HSDD is unknown. In the case of acquired/generalized low sexual desire, possible causes include various medical/health problems, psychiatric problems, low levels of testosterone or high levels of prolactin. One theory suggests that sexual desire is controlled by a balance between inhibitory and excitatory factors. This is thought to be expressed via neurotransmitters in selective brain areas. A decrease in sexual desire may therefore be due to an imbalance between neurotransmitters with excitatory activity like dopamine and norepinephrine and neurotransmitters with inhibitory activity, like serotonin. Low sexual desire can also be a side effect of various medications. In the case of acquired/situational HSDD, possible causes include intimacy difficulty, relationship problems, sexual addiction, and chronic illness of the man&#x27;s partner. The evidence for these is somewhat in question. Some claimed causes of low sexual desire are based on empirical evidence. However, some are based merely on clinical observation. In many cases, the cause of HSDD is simply unknown.

Some factors are believed to be possible causes of HSDD in women. As with men, various medical problems, psychiatric problems (such as mood disorders), or increased amounts of prolactin can cause HSDD. Other hormones are believed to be involved as well. Additionally, factors such as relationship problems or stress are believed to be possible causes of reduced sexual desire in women. According to one recent study examining the affective responses and attentional capture of sexual stimuli in women with and without HSDD, women with HSDD do not appear to have a negative association to sexual stimuli, but rather a weaker positive association than women without HSDD.

One study found a third of post operation transgender women experience HSDD, roughly consistent with ovulating women when adjusted for age. No evidence was found that HSDD in transgender women is caused by a lack of free testosterone. Progesterone has shown to alleviate some symptoms of HSDD in transgender women, as well as other hormone treatments.

==Diagnosis==
In the DSM-5, male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is characterized by &quot;persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies and desire for sexual activity&quot;, as judged by a clinician with consideration for the patient&#x27;s age and cultural context. Female sexual interest/arousal disorder is defined as a &quot;lack of, or significantly reduced, sexual interest/arousal&quot;, manifesting as at least three of the following symptoms: no or little interest in sexual activity, no or few sexual thoughts, no or few attempts to initiate sexual activity or respond to partner&#x27;s initiation, no or little sexual pleasure/excitement in 75–100% of sexual experiences, no or little sexual interest in internal or external erotic stimuli, and no or few genital/nongenital sensations in 75–100% of sexual experiences.

For both diagnoses, symptoms must persist for at least six months, cause clinically significant distress, and not be better explained by another condition. Simply having lower desire than one&#x27;s partner is not sufficient for a diagnosis. Self-identification of a lifelong lack of sexual desire as asexuality precludes diagnosis.

==Treatment==

===Counseling===
HSDD, like many sexual dysfunctions, is something that people are treated for in the context of a relationship. Theoretically, one could be diagnosed with and treated for HSDD without being in a relationship. However, relationship status is the most predictive factor accounting for distress in women with low desire and distress is required for a diagnosis of HSDD. Therefore, it is common for both partners to be involved in therapy.

Typically, the therapist tries to find a psychological or biological cause of the HSDD. If the HSDD is organically caused, the clinician may try to treat it. If the clinician believes it is rooted in a psychological problem, he or she may recommend therapy. If not, treatment generally focuses more on relationship and communication issues, improved communication (verbal and nonverbal), sexual communication, working on non-sexual intimacy, or education about sexuality may all be possible parts of treatment. Sometimes problems occur because people have unrealistic perceptions about what normal sexuality is and are concerned that they do not compare well to that, and this is one reason why education can be important. If the clinician thinks that part of the problem is a result of stress, techniques may be recommended to more effectively deal with that. Also, it can be important to understand why the low level of sexual desire is a problem for the relationship because the two partners may associate different meanings with sex but not know it.

In the case of men, the therapy may depend on the subtype of HSDD. Increasing the level of sexual desire of a man with lifelong/generalized HSDD is unlikely. Instead, the focus may be on helping the couple to adapt. In the case of acquired/generalized, it is likely that there is some biological reason the clinician can address. In the case of acquired/situational, some form of psychotherapy may be used, possibly with the man alone and possibly together with his partner.

===Medication===

====Approved====
Flibanserin was the first medication approved by FDA for the treatment of HSDD in pre-menopausal women. Its approval was controversial and a systematic review found its benefits to be marginal. The only other medication approved in the US for HSDD in pre-menopausal women is bremelanotide, in 2019.

====Off-label====
A few studies suggest that the antidepressant, bupropion, can improve sexual function in women who are not depressed, if they have HSDD. The same is true for the anxiolytic, buspirone, which is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist similarly to flibanserin.

Testosterone supplementation is effective in the short term. However, its long-term safety is unclear.

==History==
The term &quot;frigid&quot; to describe sexual dysfunction derives from medieval and early modern canonical texts about witchcraft. It was thought that witches could put spells on men to make them incapable of erections. Only in the early nineteenth century were women first described as &quot;frigid&quot;, and a vast literature exists on what was considered a serious problem if a woman did not desire sex with her husband. Many medical texts between 1800 and 1930 focused on women&#x27;s frigidity, considering it a sexual pathology.

The French psychoanalyst Princess Marie Bonaparte theorized about frigidity and considered herself to have it. Additionally, in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-III), frigidity and impotence were cited as alternate nomenclatures for Inhibited Sexual Excitement.

In 1970, Masters and Johnson published their book &quot;Human Sexual Inadequacy&quot; describing sexual dysfunctions, though these included only dysfunctions dealing with the function of genitals such as premature ejaculation and impotence for men, and anorgasmia and vaginismus for women. Prior to Masters and Johnson&#x27;s research, female orgasm was assumed by some to originate primarily from vaginal, rather than clitoral, stimulation. Consequently, feminists have argued that &quot;frigidity&quot; was &quot;defined by men as the failure of women to have vaginal orgasms&quot;.

Following this book, sex therapy increased throughout the 1970s. Reports from sex-therapists about people with low sexual desire are reported from at least 1972, but labeling this as a specific disorder did not occur until 1977. In that year, sex therapists Helen Singer Kaplan and Harold Lief independently of each other proposed creating a specific category for people with low or no sexual desire. Lief named it &quot;inhibited sexual desire&quot;, and Kaplan named it &quot;hypoactive sexual desire&quot;. The primary motivation for this was that previous models for sex therapy assumed certain levels of sexual interest in one&#x27;s partner and that problems were only caused by abnormal functioning/non-functioning of the genitals or performance anxiety but that therapies based on those problems were ineffective for people who did not sexually desire their partner. The following year, 1978, Lief and Kaplan together made a proposal to the APA&#x27;s taskforce for sexual disorders for the DSM III, of which Kaplan and Lief were both members. The diagnosis of Inhibited Sexual Desire (ISD) was added to the DSM when the 3rd edition was published in 1980.

For understanding this diagnosis, it is important to recognize the social context in which it was created. In some cultures, low sexual desire may be considered normal, and high sexual desire conversely problematic. For example, sexual desire may be lower in East Asian populations than Euro-Canadian/American populations. In other cultures, this may be reversed. Some cultures try hard to restrain sexual desire. Others try to excite it. Concepts of &quot;normal&quot; levels of sexual desire are culturally dependent and rarely value-neutral. In the 1970s, there were strong cultural messages that sex is good for you and &quot;the more the better&quot;. Within this context, people who were habitually uninterested in sex, who in previous times may not have seen this as a problem, were more likely to feel that this was a situation that needed to be fixed. They may have felt alienated by dominant messages about sexuality and increasingly people went to sex-therapists complaining of low sexual desire. It was within this context that the diagnosis of ISD was created.

In the revision of the DSM-III, published in 1987 (DSM-III-R), ISD was subdivided into two categories: Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder and Sexual Aversion Disorder (SAD). The former is a lack of interest in sex and the latter is a phobic aversion to sex. In addition to this subdivision, one reason for the change is that the committee involved in revising the psychosexual disorders for the DSM-III-R thought that the term &quot;inhibited&quot; suggests psychodynamic cause (i.e., that the conditions for sexual desire are present, but the person is, for some reason, inhibiting their own sexual interest). The term &quot;hypoactive sexual desire&quot; is more awkward, but more neutral with respect to the cause. The DSM-III-R estimated that about 20% of the population had HSDD. In the DSM-IV (1994), the criterion that the diagnosis requires &quot;marked distress or interpersonal difficulty&quot; was added.

The DSM-5, published in 2013, split HSDD into &quot;male hypoactive sexual desire disorder&quot; and &quot;female sexual interest/arousal disorder&quot;. The distinction was made because men report more intense and frequent sexual desire than women. According to Lori Brotto, this classification is desirable compared to the DSM-IV classification system because: (1) it reflects the finding that desire and arousal tend to overlap (2) it differentiates between women who lack desire before the onset of activity, but who are receptive to initiation and or initiate sexual activity for reasons other than desire, and women who never experience sexual arousal (3) it takes the variability in sexual desire into account. Furthermore, the criterion that 6 symptoms be present for a diagnosis helps safeguard against pathologizing adaptive decreases in desire.

==Criticism==
===General===
HSDD, as currently defined by the DSM, has come under criticism of the social function of the diagnosis.
* HSDD could be seen as part of a history of the medicalization of sexuality by the medical profession to define normal sexuality. It has also been examined within a &quot;broader frame of historical interest in the problematization of sexual appetite&quot;.
* HSDD has been criticized over pathologizing normal variations in sexuality because the parameters of normality are unclear. This lack of clarity is partly due to the fact that the terms &quot;persistent&quot; and &quot;recurrent&quot; do not have clear operational definitions.
* HSDD may function to pathologize asexuals, though their lack of sexual desire may not be maladaptive. Because of this, some members of the asexual community lobbied the mental health community working on the DSM-5 to distinguish hypoactive sexual desire as a disorder from asexuality as a sexual orientation.

Other criticisms focus more on scientific and clinical issues.
* HSDD is such a diverse group of conditions with many causes that it functions as little more than a starting place for clinicians to assess people.
* The requirement that low sexual desire causes distress or interpersonal difficulty has been criticized. It has been claimed that it is not clinically useful because if it is not causing any problems, the person will not seek out a clinician. One could claim that this criterion (for all of the sexual dysfunctions, including HSDD) decreases the scientific validity of the diagnoses or is a cover-up for a lack of data on what constitutes normal sexual function.
* The distress requirement is also criticized because the term &quot;distress&quot; lacks a clear definition.

Some critics of hypoactive sexual desire disorder have described it as ego-dystonic asexuality in some cases, pointing out that it pathologizes a lack of sexual desire. An asexual person may experience distress due to allonormativity, potentially meeting the distress condition for diagnosis. Unnecessarily medicating asexual people for HSDD could be described as conversion therapy, so the individual needs to be prompted to examine the cause of their distress.

===NICE (UK) assessment===
Hypoactive sexual desire disorder is not recognized as a disorder by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for the British National Health Service, with the judgement based on an article in the &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot; that &quot;Hypoactive sexual desire disorder is a typical example of a condition that was sponsored by industry to prepare the market for a specific treatment&quot;.

===DSM-IV criteria===
Prior to the publication of the DSM-5, the DSM-IV criteria were criticized on several grounds. It was suggested that a duration criterion should be added because lack of interest in sex over the past month is significantly more common than lack of interest lasting six months. Similarly, a frequency criterion (i.e., the symptoms of low desire be present in 75% or more of sexual encounters) has been suggested.

The current framework for HSDD is based on a linear model of human sexual response, developed by Masters and Johnson and modified by Kaplan consisting of desire, arousal, orgasm. The sexual dysfunctions in the DSM are based around problems at any one or more of these stages. Many of the criticisms of the DSM-IV framework for sexual dysfunction in general, and HSDD in particular, claimed that this model ignored the differences between male and female sexuality. Several criticisms were based on the inadequacy of the DSM-IV framework for dealing with females&#x27; sexual problems.
* Increasingly, evidence shows that there are significant differences between male and female sexuality. Level of desire is highly variable from female to female and there are some females who are considered sexually functional who have no active desire for sex, but they can erotically respond well in contexts they find acceptable. This has been termed &quot;responsive desire&quot; as opposed to spontaneous desire.
* The focus on merely the physiological ignores the social, economic and political factors including sexual violence and lack of access to sexual medicine or education throughout the world affecting females and their sexual health.
* The focus on the physiological ignores the relationship context of sexuality despite the fact that this is often the cause of sexual problems.
* The focus on discrepancy in desire between two partners may result in the partner with the lower level of desire being labeled as &quot;dysfunctional,&quot; but the problem really sits with the difference between the two partners. However, within couples the assessment of desire tends to be relative. That is, individuals make judgments by comparing their levels of desire to that of their partner. 
* The sexual problems that females complain of often do not fit well into the DSM-IV framework for sexual dysfunctions.
* The DSM-IV system of sub-typing may be more applicable to one sex than the other.
* Research indicates a high degree of comorbidity between HSDD and female sexual arousal disorder. Therefore, a diagnosis combining the two (as the DSM-5 eventually did) might be more appropriate.

<doc id="411820" wikidata="Q285780" url="?curid=411820" title="Urpmi">
<text>urpmi is a package management tool for installing, removing, updating and querying software packages of local or remote (networked) media. It wraps around the RPM Package Manager in the role of a smart package manager. It uses repositories and will resolve dependencies so that the user will not suffer from dependency hell that can happen when using RPM directly. It works with official sources from Mandriva or unofficial sources such as those from the Penguin Liberation Front. It has a graphical front-end: Rpmdrake.

It&#x27;s made of 2 parts:
* a low level C/perl bindings
* a higher level perl code implementing the advanced algorithms

In addition to the now-defunct Mandriva Linux, it is also being used by:
*Uruk GNU/Linux, a 100% free software system origin in Iraq, based on this package manager virtually for Uruk package manager simulator, and Linux-libre kernels and apt real package manager from Trisquel, also named after a city in Iraq
*Mageia, a French fork of Mandriva Linux that for a time was the base for future Mandriva products but is now an independent community driven Linux distribution.
*ROSA Linux, a Russian fork of Mandriva Linux that is the base for future OpenMandriva products.

==History==
urpmi was developed as an experiment by Pascal Rigaux (Pixel) to address RPM install limitations; it was further maintained by François Pons and different Mandriva employees. It is currently (2010–2024) maintained by Thierry Vignaud who was the maintainer of rpmdrake and one of the co-maintainers of the drakx installer and tools at Mandriva before he continued doing that job at Mageia.

Per Øyvind Karlsen maintained a fork of urpmi at Rosa Linux, backporting fixes and improvements from Thierry Vignaud work, but this is not the version that was used by Mandriva Business Server (which was based on Mageia). This fork died around 2013 (date of last commit).

<doc id="411823" wikidata="Q3813256" url="?curid=411823" title="Casualty insurance">
<text>Casualty insurance is a defined term which broadly encompasses insurance not directly concerned with life insurance, health insurance, or property insurance. 

Casualty insurance is mainly liability coverage of an individual or organization for negligent acts or omissions. However, the term has also been used for property insurance, aviation insurance, boiler and machinery insurance, and glass and crime insurance. It may include marine insurance for shipwrecks or losses at sea, fidelity and surety insurance, earthquake insurance, political risk insurance, terrorism insurance, fidelity and surety bonds.

One of the most common kinds of casualty insurance today is automobile insurance. In its most basic form, automobile insurance provides liability coverage in the event that a driver is found &quot;at fault&quot; in an accident. This can cover medical expenses of individuals involved in the accident as well as restitution or repair of damaged property, all of which would fall into the realm of casualty insurance coverage.

If coverage were extended to cover damage to one&#x27;s own vehicle, or against theft, the policy would no longer be exclusively a casualty insurance policy.

== Definitions ==
The state of Illinois includes vehicle, liability, worker&#x27;s compensation, glass, livestock, legal expenses, and miscellaneous insurance under its class of casualty insurance.

In 1956, in the preface to the fourth edition of &quot;Casualty Insurance&quot; Clarence A. Kulp wrote:Broadly speaking, it may be defined as a list of individual insurances, usually written in a separate policy, in three broad categories: third party or liability, disability or accident, and health, material damage. One of the results of comprehensive policy-writing ... is to raise the question of the usefulness of the traditional concept of casualty insurance ... some insurance men predict that the casualty insurance of the future will include liability and disability lines only. Later in Chapter 2 the book states that insurance was traditionally classified under life, fire-marine, and casualty. Since multiple-line policies began to be written (insurance contracts covering several types of risks), the last two began to merge.

When the NAIC approved multiple underwriting in 1946, casualty insurance was defined as a blanket term for the legal liability except for marine, disability and medical care, and some damage to physical property.

<text>Pictou ( ; Canadian Gaelic: &quot;Baile Phiogto&quot; Miꞌkmawiꞌsimk: &quot;Piktuk&quot;) is a town in Pictou County, in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Located on the north shore of Pictou Harbour, the town is approximately 10 km (6 miles) north of the larger town of New Glasgow.

Once an active shipping port and the shire town of the county, today Pictou is primarily a local service centre for surrounding rural communities and the primary tourist destination in this region of Nova Scotia.

The name Pictou derives from the Mi&#x27;kmaq name , meaning &quot;explosive place&quot;, a reference to the river of pitch that was found in the area, or perhaps from methane bubbling up from coal seams below the harbour.

==History==
Pictou Town had been the location of an annual Mi&#x27;kmaq summer coastal community prior to European settlement. Pictou was part of the Epekwitk aq Piktuk Mi&#x27;kmaq District, which included present-day Prince Edward Island and Pictou.

The town of Pictou was a receiving point for many Scottish immigrants moving to a new home in northern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island following the Highland Clearances of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The first wave of immigrants arrived on September 15, 1773, on the &quot;Hector&quot;. While there were a significant number of Scottish people settled in other parts of Nova Scotia at the time Pictou was settled, the town&#x27;s tourism slogan is &quot;The Birthplace of New Scotland&quot;, which is based on being the first primarily made up Scottish immigrants and the ship &quot;Hector&quot; being recognized as the first immigrant ship to sail directly from Scotland to what is now Canada. Pictou today contains many important examples of stone housing constructed by those early generations of Scottish immigrant, which have clear connections to architectural styles and design in Scotland itself.

When the &quot;Hector&quot; arrived, there were already a few families in Pictou that had arrived on the &quot;Betsy&quot; six years earlier. The town has an indirect connection to Scottish settlement in New Zealand; the Reverend Norman McLeod emigrated to Pictou from Scotland some years after the &quot;Hector&quot; but eventually re-settled with his parishioners at St. Ann&#x27;s on Cape Breton Island. He later encouraged his parishioners to move to Waipu where there are still many descendants from Pictou and St. Ann&#x27;s.

During the American Revolution, in November 1777 at Pictou, American privateers from Machias captured the ship &quot;Molly&quot;, under the command of Captain William Lowden. Local resident Wellwood Waugh was implicated in the raid on Pictou and was forced to move to Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia. He became a prominent inhabitant and Waugh River is named after him.
In 1812 Sir Hector Maclean (the 7th Baronet of Morvern and 23rd Chief of the Clan Maclean) emigrated to Pictou from Glensanda and Kingairloch in Scotland with almost the entire population of 500. Sir Hector is buried in the cemetery at Pictou.

During the latter part of the 19th century, Pictou&#x27;s industrial sector gained strength. The Intercolonial Railway was built to the town on a spur from the Stellarton-Oxford Junction &quot;Short Line&quot;. Shipbuilding increased through the 19th century, particularly with the increase in coal being shipped from Pictou Landing, Abercrombie and the East River of Pictou. A number of shipyards have been continuously established in the town since this period. A notable shipbuilding accomplishment was the speedy construction of 24 Park ship freighters by the newly created Pictou Shipyard in World War II. After the war the shipyard continued operation building many fishing trawlers and ferries. The port&#x27;s cargo activity increased after the nearby Scott Maritimes pulp mill opened in Abercrombie in 1965. CN Rail abandoned its service to the town in the late 1980s but other transportation – including Highway 106 (the Trans-Canada Highway) – opened in the 1970s to provide alternatives.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Pictou had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Education==
Pictou Academy is the town&#x27;s high school and was founded in 1803 by Dr. Thomas McCulloch, who was travelling to his new clergy posting on Prince Edward Island. He was convinced to stay the winter and ended up remaining in Pictou for much longer. Disappointed by the lack of education among Pictonians, Dr. McCulloch decided to start a &quot;college&quot;. There was considerable argument between Dr. Thomas McCulloch and Nova Scotia&#x27;s provincial government for funding however it finally became a reality in 1816 when the Pictou Academy was incorporated. The province of Nova Scotia would not let it be named a &quot;college,&quot; as such, but it was a school of higher education (senior matriculation) which was open to people of every race and denomination.

Between 1816 and the present, Pictou Academy has been in four separate buildings. The school was moved from its original building to a new site, while the second and third buildings both burned down. There were Academy graduates from every year since it was incorporated, excluding the years between several of its different buildings.

At the start of the school year of 2003–2004, all high schools in Pictou County were closed, and their students began to go to the two new &quot;superschools&quot;, Northumberland Regional High School, and North Nova Education Centre, for their education. The only exception to this is Pictou Academy, which continues to operate.

The town operates a small library and C@P site.

==Attractions==
===Events===

The Pictou Lobster Carnival takes place annually in early July at the former train station. The Lobster Carnival is a yearly event celebrating the end of the fishing season and has been celebrated since 1934. The carnival includes a midway, &#x27;Rock the Lobster&#x27; concerts, a pageant, breakfasts, a car show, fireworks, a beer garden, crate runs, hauling/net cutting contests, boat races, and lobster dinners. As of 2024, it is the longest-running active lobster festival in North America. It draws thousands to the town annually for the event.

The town also used to host a large celebration for Ship Hector Festival in August. This ended in the early 2010s, although there are still New Scotland Days celebrations in September. The celebrations centre on the ship &quot;Hector&quot; and include a Celtic church service and a descendants reunion. 
In 2023, for the 250th Anniversary of the landing of the Ship Hector, the town received federal and provincial funding to support a three-month long celebration. 

The main celebrations consisted of evening concerts on a waterfront stage, a daily vendor market, the rededication of the No. 2 Construction Battalion monument, the church service, descendants reunion, the &quot;Voyage&quot; musical about the &quot;Hector,&quot; and a visits from the Governor General of Canada and the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. The headliners for the concerts included Ashley MacIsaac, Cassie &amp; Maggie, Terra Spencer, Mary Beth Carty, Ray Stewart, Amelia Parker, Christina Martin, Jud Gunning, Steve MacIntyre, Morgan Toney, Darren McMullen, Rachel Davis, Rum Ragged, Terry Kelly, DeeDee Austin, and the Barra MacNeils.

===Museums===
The primary tourist attraction in Pictou Town is the waterfront along Pictou Town Harbour. During the 1990s–2000s, industrial land on the Pictou Town waterfront was redeveloped with the centrepiece being construction of the replica tall ship &quot;Hector&quot;. Now completed, the ship is docked each summer at the Hector Heritage Quay, an interpretive centre that includes three floors of exhibits, as well as access to the floating replica. From 2020 to 2024. Next door to the Hector Heritage Quay is the Northumberland Fisheries Museum, Lobster Hatchery, and Lighthouse Museum.

Grohmann Knives Ltd., the only knife manufacturing factory in Canada, are the sole producers of the historic D.H. Russell Belt Knives and Grohmann Kitchen Knives for over 50 years. Free factory tours of the plant are offered to the public on Water Street.

The McCulloch House Museum on the edge of downtown offers an archives and research centre and a nineteenth-century house museum. 

===Architecture===

Besides the museum aspect of the McCulloch House, the 19th century home once belonged to Rev. Dr. Thomas McCulloch. It is one of many examples of centuries-old houses in Pictou. The downtown is home to several &#x27;Scottish&#x27; designed buildings that include locally sourced sandstone and five-sided dormers. A book dedicated to the history of each old home and building is available at the museum.

The waterfront redevelopment also features a marina and small boardwalk that connects to the Trans-Canada Trail. The historic Intercolonial Railway station (pictured above) on the waterfront has been restored and connects to the waterfront by the old customs house.

===Other===

There are several monuments around the town, including the Hector Settler in Market Square, the No. 2 Construction Battalion monuments on the waterfront, and the cenotaph on Church Street. The war cenotaph was sculpted by the renowned George Hill.

Boat Tours through Discover the Strait are available, offering various trips to see the harbour and the wildlife in the Northumberland Strait. The waterfront is also home to a marine and cruise ship docks, allowing boat-bound tourists to dock.

Pictou Town is 5 kilometres south of the port of Caribou where Northumberland Ferries Limited operates a seasonal vehicle-pedestrian ferry service to Prince Edward Island; there is also a pedestrian-only ferry that operates seasonally to Pictou Island. Several beaches are located near Pictou Town, most notably Caribou Provincial Park and Waterside Beach Provincial Park. The Jitney Trail also starts at the waterfront. The former train route has been converted into a paved and gravel walkway for pedestrians and runs from Pictou to Oxford, Nova Scotia. The trail also connects to Brown&#x27;s Point, just a few kilometres outside of Pictou, where the &quot;Hector&quot; landed.

<text>Ivan Minchov Vazov (; – 22 September 1921) was a Bulgarian poet, novelist, and playwright, often referred to as &quot;the Patriarch of Bulgarian literature&quot;. He was born in Sopot, a town in the Rose Valley of Bulgaria (then part of the Ottoman Empire). The works of Ivan Vazov reveal two historical epochs - the Bulgarian Renaissance and the Post-Liberation (from Ottoman Empire rule) epoch. Ivan Vazov holds the highest honorary title of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences - Academician. He acted as Education and People Enlightenment Minister from September 7, 1897, until January 30, 1899, representing the People&#x27;s Party.

==Biography and major works==
The exact date of Vazov&#x27;s birth is disputed. His parents, Saba and Mincho Vazov, both had a lot of influence on the young poet.

After Ivan finished primary school in Sopot, Mincho sent him to Kalofer, appointing him assistant teacher. Having done his final exams in Kalofer, the young teacher returned to Sopot to help in his father&#x27;s grocery. The following year his father sent him to Plovdiv to Naiden Gerov&#x27;s school. There Vazov made his first steps as a poet.

He returned to Sopot only to leave for Oltenița in Romania, as his father wanted him to become an apprentice and study trade at his uncle&#x27;s. Ivan Vazov showed no interest in the trade profession whatsoever. Instead he was immersed in literature. Soon he fled from his uncle&#x27;s place and went to Brăila where he lived with the Bulgarian exiled revolutionaries and met Hristo Botev, a Bulgarian revolutionary and poet.

In 1874, he joined the struggle for his country&#x27;s independence from the Ottoman Empire. He returned to Sopot in 1875, where he became a member of the local revolutionary committee. After the failure of the April Uprising of 1876, he had to flee the country, going back to Galaţi, where most of the surviving revolutionaries were exiled. There he was appointed a secretary of the committee.

Vazov was probably heavily influenced by Botev, who was the ideological leader of the Bulgarian revolutionary movement. He started writing his famous poems with Botev and some other Bulgarian emigrants in Romania. In 1876 he published his first work, &quot;Priaporetz and Gusla&quot;, followed by &quot;Bulgaria&#x27;s Sorrows&quot; in 1877.

Bulgaria regained its independence in 1878 as a result of the Russo-Turkish War and Vazov wrote the famous &quot;Epic of the Forgotten&quot;. He became the editor of the political reviews &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Dawn&quot;. He was, however, forced into exile once again, this time to Odesa, because of the persecution of the russophile political faction. Returning to Bulgaria with the help of his mother Saba Vazova, he started teaching. Vazov&#x27;s next stay was in Svishtov, where he became a civil servant.

He moved to Sofia in 1889 where he started publishing the review &quot;Dennitsa&quot;.

Vazov&#x27;s 1888 novel &quot;Under the Yoke&quot;, which depicts the Ottoman oppression of Bulgaria, is the most famous piece of classic Bulgarian literature and has been translated into over 30 languages.

Later in his life Vazov was a prominent and widely respected figure in the social and cultural life of newly independent Bulgaria. He died on September 22, 1921.

==Other famous works==
Some of the other famous works by Vazov include the novels &quot;New Country&quot; (1894), &quot;Under Our Heaven&quot; (1900), &quot;The Empress of Kazalar&quot; (1902), &quot;Songs of Macedonia&quot; (1914), &quot; It Will Not Perish &quot; (1920) and the plays &quot;Vagabonds&quot; (1894), &quot;A Newspaperman?&quot; (1900), &quot;Borislav&quot; (1909) and &quot;Ivaylo&quot; (1911).

Vazov also wrote the first Bulgarian science fiction story &quot;The Last Day of XX Century&quot; (1899), the first Bulgarian fantasy poem &quot;In the Kingdom of the Fairies&quot; (1884) and some other fantasy poetry.

==Historical site==
Vazov&#x27;s home in Sofia has been turned into a museum, containing a restoration of his residence with period furnishings, as well as Vazov&#x27;s taxidermically preserved dog. Although the museum is ostensibly open Tuesday through Saturday, it is in practice not always staffed, so visitors are advised to call in advance. The museum is located at the corner of Ivan Vazov Street and Georgi S. Rakovski Street in Sofia.
Another gem of a museum is his large home in Berkovitsa. It is filled with poetry combined with old photographs of the area and the revolution, blown up to poster size. The second floor has two large meeting rooms, one for men, the other for women. Platform couches doubled as beds.

==Honours==
The Bulgarian Ivan Vazov National Theatre in Sofia is named after him, the &quot;Ivan Vazov&quot; neighborhood in Sofia, as is the Ivan Vazov National Library () in Plovdiv. A park near St. Sofia Church in Sofia features the city&#x27;s best-known monument to Vazov.

Vazovova Street in Bratislava, Slovakia, and Vazov Point and Vazov Rock on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica are also named after him.

In 1917, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in literature.

A crater on the planet Mercury was named in his honor in June 2020.

<text>Octanitrocubane (molecular formula: C8(NO2)8) is a proposed high explosive that, like TNT, is shock-insensitive (not readily detonated by shock). The octanitrocubane molecule has the same chemical structure as cubane (C8H8) except that each of the eight hydrogen atoms is replaced by a nitro group (NO2). As of 1998, octanitrocubane had not been produced in quantities large enough to test its performance as an explosive.

It is, however, not as powerful an explosive as once thought, as the high-density theoretical crystal structure has not been achieved. For this reason, heptanitrocubane, the slightly less nitrated form, is believed to have marginally better performance, despite having a worse oxygen balance.

Octanitrocubane is thought to have 20–25% greater performance than HMX (octogen). This increase in power is due to its highly expansive breakdown into CO2 and N2, as well as to the presence of strained chemical bonds in the molecule which have stored potential energy. In addition, it produces no water vapor upon combustion, making it less visible, and both the chemical itself and its decomposition products (nitrogen and carbon dioxide) are considered to be non-toxic.

Octanitrocubane was first synthesized by Philip Eaton (who was also the first to synthesize cubane in 1964) and Mao-Xi Zhang at the University of Chicago in 1999, with the structure proven by crystallographer Richard Gilardi of the United States Naval Research Laboratory.

== Synthesis ==
Although octanitrocubane is predicted to be one of the most effective explosives, the difficulty of its synthesis inhibits practical use. Philip Eaton&#x27;s synthesis was difficult and lengthy, and required cubane (rare to begin with) as a starting point. As a result, octanitrocubane is more valuable, gram for gram, than gold.

A proposed path to synthesis is the cyclotetramerization of the as yet undiscovered and presumably highly unstable dinitroacetylene.

<doc id="411837" wikidata="Q6521653" url="?curid=411837" title="Distribution frame">
<text>In telecommunications, a distribution frame is a passive device which terminates cables, allowing arbitrary interconnections to be made.

For example, the Main Distribution Frame (MDF) located at a telephone central office terminates the cables leading to subscribers on the one hand, and cables leading to active equipment (such as DSLAMs and telephone switches) on the other. Service is provided to a subscriber by manually wiring a twisted pair (called a jumper wire) between the telephone line and the relevant DSL or POTS line circuit.

In broadcast engineering, a distribution frame is a location within an apparatus room through which all signals (audio, video, or data) pass, with the ability to arbitrarily route and connect sources and destinations between studios and other internal and external points. Connections can either be soldered, or made using terminal blocks. Because the frame may carry live broadcast signals, it may be considered part of the airchain.

In data communication, a building distribution frame (BDF) houses data switches, etc.

==Types==
Distribution frames for specific types of signals often have specific initialisms:
* DDF—digital distribution frame
* IDF—Intermediate distribution frame
* MDF—Main distribution frame
* ODF or OFDF—optical fiber distribution frame
* VDF—voice distribution frame

==Modernization==
Distribution frames may grow to extremely large sizes. In major installations, audio distribution frames can have as many as 10,000 incoming and outgoing separate copper wires (balanced audio signals require two wires plus earth ground for each signal). Telephone signals do not use a separate earth ground wire, but some urban exchanges have about 250,000 wires on their MDF. Installing and rewiring these jumpers is a labour-intensive task, leading to attempts in the industry to devise so-called active distribution frames or Automated Main Distribution Frames. The principal issues which stand in the way of their widespread adoption are cost and reliability.

Newer digital mixing consoles can act as control points for a distribution frame or router, which can handle audio from multiple studios (even for multiple co-located radio or TV stations) at the same time. Multiple smaller frames, such as one for each studio, can be linked together with fibre-optics (which also helps eliminate ground loops), or with gigabit Ethernet. This has the advantage of not having to route dozens of feeds through walls (and sometimes floors and ceilings) to a single point.

<text>Christine Ellen Hynde (born September 7, 1951) is an American-British musician. She is a founding member of the rock band The Pretenders and is the band&#x27;s lead vocalist, guitarist, and primary songwriter; she and drummer Martin Chambers are the band&#x27;s two remaining original members. Hynde is the only continuous member of the Pretenders, having appeared on every studio album released by the band.

Hynde formed the Pretenders in Hereford, England, in 1978, with Pete Farndon, James Honeyman-Scott and Chambers. She has also recorded a number of songs with other musicians, including Frank Sinatra, Cher and UB40. Hynde recorded her first solo album, &quot;Stockholm&quot;, in 2014. Hynde was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005 as a member of the Pretenders. 

==Early life==
Hynde was born in Akron, Ohio, United States, the daughter of a part-time secretary and a Yellow Pages manager, and grew up in nearby Cuyahoga Falls. She graduated from Firestone High School in Akron but stated that &quot;I was never too interested in high school. I mean, I never went to a dance, I never went out on a date, I never went steady. It became pretty awful for me. Except, of course, I could go see bands, and that was the kick. I used to go to Cleveland just to see any band. So I was in love a lot of the time, but mostly with guys in bands that I had never met. For me, knowing that Brian Jones was out there, and later that Iggy Pop was out there, made it kind of hard for me to get too interested in the guys that were around me. I had, uh, bigger things in mind.&quot;

==Early career==
Hynde became interested in hippie counterculture, Eastern mysticism, and vegetarianism. While attending Kent State University&#x27;s Art School for three years, she joined Sat. Sun. Mat., a band which included Mark Mothersbaugh, later of Devo. Hynde was also caught up in the Kent State massacre on May 4, 1970, in which the boyfriend of one of her friends was among the four victims.

In May 1973, Hynde moved to London. With her art background, she got a job in an architectural firm but left after eight months. It was then that she met rock journalist Nick Kent and landed a position at the music magazine &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;), writing what she subsequently described as &quot;half-baked philosophical drivel and nonsensical tirades.&quot; Afterwards Hynde got a job at Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s clothing store, Sex. Hynde attempted to start a band in France, before her return to Cleveland in 1975, and joined a rhythm and blues group, Jack Rabbit. 

After living in Tucson, she returned to France in 1975 at the invitation of Michael Fradji Memmi, bass player of &quot;the Frenchies&quot; (fr), which she joined as the singer. She returned to London 1976 in the midst of the early punk movement. At one point she tried to convince Steve Jones and then Johnny Rotten (of the Sex Pistols, who were managed by McLaren) to marry her to get her a work permit. Hynde&#x27;s version of this episode has it that Rotten &quot;offered to go to a registry office with me and do the unmentionable&quot; but when he subsequently withdrew, Sid Vicious volunteered to take his place. Upon arrival at the registry office the following morning, they found it &quot;closed for an extended holiday&quot; and were unable to attend the following day due to Vicious making a court appearance. In late 1976, Hynde responded to an advertisement in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; for band members and attended an audition for the band that would become 999. Jon Moss (who would later be in Culture Club) and Tony James of Generation X also auditioned. Later, Hynde tried to start a group with Mick Jones from the Clash.

After the lack of success with the band, Malcolm McLaren placed her as a guitarist in Masters of the Backside but she was asked to leave the group just as it became the Damned. After a brief spell in the band Johnny Moped, Mick Jones invited Hynde to join his band on their initial tour of Britain. Hynde recollected of that period,
Hynde also spent a short time with punk band the Moors Murderers in 1978. Named after a pair of child-killers, the band consisted of future Visage front man Steve Strange on vocals, Vince Ely on drums, with Mark Ryan (a.k.a. the Kid) and Hynde on guitar. The band&#x27;s name alone was enough to start controversy, and she soon distanced herself from the group, as noted in &quot;NME&quot;. Hynde said, &quot;I&#x27;m not in the group, I only rehearsed with them&quot;. She stated that &quot;Steve Strange and Soo Catwoman had the idea for the group, and asked me to help them out on guitar, which I did, even though I was getting my own group together and still am&quot;.

==The Pretenders==
In 1978, Hynde made a demo tape and gave it to Dave Hill, owner of the label Real Records. Hill stepped in to manage her career, and began by paying off the back rent owed on her rehearsal room in Covent Garden, London. Hill also advised Hynde to take her time and get a band together. In the spring of 1978, Hynde met bass guitarist Pete Farndon and they selected a band consisting of James Honeyman-Scott (guitar, vocals, keyboards), and Martin Chambers (drums, vocals, percussion). The name &quot;the Pretenders&quot; was inspired by the Sam Cooke version of the Platters&#x27; 1955 R&amp;B hit song &quot;The Great Pretender&quot;.

They recorded a demo tape (including &quot;Precious&quot;, &quot;The Wait&quot; and a Kinks cover, &quot;Stop Your Sobbing&quot;), handed it to Hynde&#x27;s friend Nick Lowe, produced a single (&quot;Stop Your Sobbing&quot;/&quot;The Wait&quot;) and performed their first gig at a club in Paris. The single was released in January 1979 and hit No. 33 in the UK. A second single &quot;Kid&quot; followed to similar success in July 1979. In November 1979, the Pretenders released their first signature single &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot; in the UK, which hit UK number 1 on January 19, 1980, the same date as their eponymous first album. Both went on to similar chart success worldwide.
The band released an EP album, &quot;Extended Play&quot;, then &quot;Pretenders II&quot; later in the summer. &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; and &quot;Message of Love&quot; were on both. The Pretenders lineup would change repeatedly over the next decade. Honeyman-Scott died of a drug overdose on June 16, 1982, just days after Farndon had been fired from the band. Farndon also died of a drug overdose the following year. After reforming with a caretaker line-up (Martin Chambers, Billy Bremner, Tony Butler, and Jeremy Allom) for their next single, &quot;Back on the Chain Gang&quot;, the band settled down with Robbie McIntosh (guitar) and Malcolm Foster (bass) during the recording of their next album, the worldwide hit &quot;Learning to Crawl&quot;. Chambers left the band in the mid-1980s before the &quot;Get Close&quot; album was released in 1986. The album included the hits &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Me Wrong&quot; and &quot;My Baby&quot;. Amidst the ever-changing lineup, Hynde endured as the sole original Pretender until Chambers&#x27; return in the mid-1990s. Hynde was the only stable member of the band during this period. In 1994, the band had another hit, the ballad &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand by You&quot;.

Hynde continued with the Pretenders into the new century both in new recording as well as multiple tours worldwide. New Pretenders albums emerged in 2002 (&quot;Loose Screw&quot;), 2008 (&quot;Break Up the Concrete&quot;) and 2016 (&quot;Alone&quot;).

Hynde was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005 as a member of the Pretenders. The ceremony was held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, New York City.

In 2016, the band collaborated with Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys on the album &quot;Alone&quot;. This album was released as a Pretenders&#x27; album, though Hynde was the only original member to appear on it. The new band also played a concert for the BBC at the Maida Vale studio. In 2016, Hynde and the Pretenders opened for Stevie Nicks.

In July 2020, the Pretenders released their 11th studio album &quot;Hate for Sale&quot;. The album was well received critically and obtained a score of 78 on the critical aggregator Metacritic.

On March 9, 2022, Hynde performed a rendition of the Pretenders song &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand By You&quot; at Night for Ukraine, a fundraising benefit held at the Roundhouse in north London, with the funds raised being donated to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal, to provide aid to people fleeing Ukraine following the Russian invasion. The event was organized by Fabien Riggall in collaboration with the Ukrainian pop duo Bloom Twins.

On June 24, 2023, Hynde and the band played the Glastonbury Festival with guest artist Johnny Marr. Dave Grohl also guested on drums for one song.

==Other musical projects==
Hynde, along with Curved Air&#x27;s Sonja Kristina, sang backing vocals on Mick Farren&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Vampires Stole My Lunch Money&quot; and also on &quot;Hurt&quot; by Chris Spedding. She also sang backing on a track, &quot;Nite Klub&quot;, on the Specials&#x27; eponymous debut album. Hynde sang a duet with INXS on their album &quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot; in 1993. She appears on the title track of the album. Hynde sang the vocals on the track &quot;State of Independence Part II&quot; on a Moodswings album named &quot;Moodfood&quot;, which was played during the closing credits on the soundtrack of &quot;Single White Female&quot;. She provided backing vocals on Morrissey&#x27;s single &quot;My Love Life&quot; in 1991 and again on b-side &quot;Shame Is The Name&quot; in 2009.

Hynde recorded a duet with Frank Sinatra on Sinatra&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Duets II&quot;. They performed the song &quot;Luck Be a Lady&quot;. In 1995, Hynde made an acting appearance as fictional character Stephanie Schiffer on the US television comedy &quot;Friends&quot; on the episode &quot;The One with the Baby on the Bus&quot;, in which she performed &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; and the comedy song &quot;Smelly Cat&quot; (which she co-wrote) with Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay on acoustic guitar. Also, in 1995, Hynde sang a cover of &quot;Love Can Build a Bridge&quot; with Cher and Neneh Cherry. Eric Clapton appeared on the track, supplying the lead guitar solo that is featured in the song&#x27;s instrumental bridge.

In 1997, the EMI publishing company issued a cease and desist request to Rush Limbaugh, who for years had been using an edited instrumental version of Hynde&#x27;s song &quot;My City Was Gone&quot; for the broadcast&#x27;s opening theme. When the request came to Hynde&#x27;s attention during a radio interview, she said her parents loved and listened to Rush and she did not mind its use. They agreed to a royalty contract which she retained and at one time used for a payment to PETA to raise awareness of chemical testing on animals.

Hynde&#x27;s most popular non-Pretenders collaboration with another artist, chartwise, was her 1985 collaboration with UB40 on a cover of Sonny and Cher&#x27;s &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;. The track topped the UK singles chart and went as high as No. 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the U.S.

On April 10, 1999, Hynde led the memorial concert &quot;Here, There and Everywhere – A Concert for Linda&quot; for her late close friend Linda McCartney at the Royal Albert Hall, London. Proceeds went to animal rights charities. The Pretenders were the backing band for all artists.

In 1999, Hynde played guitar and sang vocals with Sheryl Crow on the song &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot; during a concert in Central Park. Hynde is mentioned prominently in the lyrics of the Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby song &quot;Penelope Please&quot;. In 1998, Hynde sang a duet with her friend Emmylou Harris, &quot;She&quot;, accompanied by the Pretenders on the Gram Parsons tribute album, &quot;Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons&quot;. Hynde had previously reviewed Gram and Emmylou&#x27;s debut country rock classic, &quot;GP&quot;. The version merges Emmylou&#x27;s country rock and Hynde&#x27;s reggae-tinged new wave. Hynde also recorded a song called &quot;Cry (If You Don&#x27;t Mind)&quot; with the Spanish band Jarabe de Palo for their album &quot;Un metro cuadrado – 1m²&quot;. She supplied the voice for Siri, the clouded leopard in the movie &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot; (2003) in which she sang a duet with Bruce Willis.

In 2004, Hynde moved to São Paulo, Brazil, for a couple of months in order to play with Brazilian musician Moreno Veloso. She was also the vocalist on Tube &amp; Berger&#x27;s 2004 No. 1 Hot Dance Airplay track &quot;Straight Ahead&quot;. The track gave Hynde a No. 1 track on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Likewise in 2005, Hynde duetted with Ringo Starr on a song entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Hang Up&quot; which can be heard on Starr&#x27;s album &quot;Choose Love&quot;. Also in 2005, she collaborated with Incubus on a song called &quot;Neither Of Us Can See&quot;. The song is on the soundtrack album for &quot;Stealth&quot;.

On October 17, 2008, she was an opening act for fellow Akron-area musicians Devo at a special benefit concert at the Akron Civic Theater for then-presidential candidate Barack Obama. The Black Keys, another Akron-based band, and the then up-and-coming solo artist, Rachel Roberts, performed prior to her.

Hynde features as guest vocalist on Ray Davies&#x27; 2009 Christmas single &quot;Postcard From London&quot; and Morrissey&#x27;s &quot;Years of Refusal&quot; the same year.

Hynde and Welsh singer J.P. Jones formed a band called &quot;J.P., Chrissie and the Fairground Boys&quot;, releasing an album, &quot;Fidelity&quot;, on August 24, 2010. Several stops on the tour were recorded and sold on USB flash drives.

On February 5, 2011, Hynde and the Pretenders performed live on &quot;CMT Crossroads&quot; with Faith Hill and her band, including songs from both catalogs.

Along with John Cale and Nick Cave, Hynde played on BBC Four for the &quot;Songwriter&#x27;s Circle&quot; program on July 9, 1999. The concert took place at the Subterania Club in London, England and was released on DVD. She also later joined Cave in 2010 for a rendition of Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins&#x27; song &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; as a benefit for the Haiti disasters. The song and music video featured performances by Mick Jones, Glen Matlock, Shane MacGowan, and Bobby Gillespie among others.

Hynde released a new album, &quot;Stockholm&quot;, on June 10, 2014. The album featured contributions from Neil Young and John McEnroe.

Hynde released &quot;Valve Bone Woe&quot;, a jazz/pop album of selected covers with the Valve Bone Woe ensemble on September 6, 2019, produced by Marius de Vries. The album debuted at No.32 on the Official UK album charts and at No. 1 on the UK Jazz and Blues chart.

==Artistry and influence==

Hynde has a contralto vocal range. Until 1978, shortly before the advent of the Pretenders, Hynde had little idea what she sounded like. Hynde eschews formal voice training; she contends that &quot;distinctive voices in rock are trained through years of many things: frustration, fear, loneliness, anger, insecurity, arrogance, narcissism, or just sheer perseverance – anything but a teacher.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Hynde at number 114 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

In a 1994 interview, Madonna recalled of Hynde:

&quot;I saw her play in Central Park [in August 1980, performing with the Pretenders]. She was amazing: the only woman I&#x27;d seen in performance where I thought, yeah, she&#x27;s got balls, she&#x27;s awesome! ... It gave me courage, inspiration, to see a woman with that kind of confidence in a man&#x27;s world.&quot;
==Personal life==
Hynde, born in the United States, has long maintained dual citizenship with the UK. In the 1970s, Hynde, unable to obtain a work visa, asked both Sid Vicious and Johnny Rotten to marry her, though for various reasons neither did. Hynde then went back to the US briefly before returning to the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;culturecalling/2017/interview-hynde&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Hynde and Ray Davies planned to wed in Guildford, but &quot;the guy in the registry office took one look at us and suggested we come back another time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;getsurrey/10139985&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Hynde had a daughter, Natalie, with Davies. She married Jim Kerr, lead singer of the band Simple Minds, in 1984. Together they had a daughter, Yasmin, in 1985. They lived in South Queensferry, Scotland and divorced in 1990; Hynde was married to Colombian artist and sculptor Lucho Brieva from 1997 to 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;thefreelibrary/a061077299&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

She follows Vaishnavism, a branch of Hinduism, and travels to India once every year to further her studies.

Hynde lives in London&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn/travel/chrissie-hynde&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and also has an apartment in the Northside Lofts in her hometown of Akron.

Hynde has described becoming a vegetarian as &quot;the best thing that ever happened to me&quot;. She says that she came to regard meat-eaters with &quot;distaste, almost contempt&quot; but has learned to &quot;live and associate with [them] but never respected them&quot;. Hynde is also an animal rights activist and a supporter of PETA and the animal rights group Viva!. 

Hynde has publicly campaigned against the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States, and in February 2020 called on then President Donald Trump to &quot;set him free&quot;.

===Autobiography===
Hynde published an autobiography, &quot;&quot;, on September 8, 2015.

In October 2018, Hynde released a limited edition book of her artworks, titled &quot;Adding the Blue&quot;, the name being taken from the final track on her 2014 solo album, &quot;Stockholm&quot;.

===Restaurant venture===

Hynde opened the VegiTerranean, a vegan restaurant, in the Northside Lofts, Akron, Ohio&lt;ref name=&quot;thevegiterranean/20110228093036&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in November 2007. The restaurant served fusion Italian-Mediterranean food by head chef James Scot Jones. Before the restaurant&#x27;s opening on September 15, 2007, Hynde performed three songs at the restaurant with Adam Seymour, a former lead guitarist of the Pretenders. The restaurant was voted among the top five vegan restaurants in the U.S. It closed on October 2, 2011, owing to the economic climate, according to Hynde.

<doc id="411844" wikidata="Q2662072" url="?curid=411844" title="Indigenous music of North America">
<text>Indigenous music of North America, which includes American Indian music or Native American music, is the 
music that is used, created or performed by Indigenous peoples of North America, including Native Americans in the United States and Aboriginal peoples in Canada, Indigenous peoples of Mexico, and other North American countries—especially traditional tribal music, such as Pueblo music and Inuit music. In addition to the traditional music of the Native American groups, there now exist pan-Indianism and intertribal genres as well as distinct Native American subgenres of popular music including: rock, blues, hip hop, classical, film music, and reggae, as well as unique popular styles like chicken scratch and New Mexico music.
== Characteristics ==
Singing and percussion are the most important aspects of traditional Native American music. Vocalization takes many forms, ranging from solo and choral song to responsorial, unison and multipart singing. Percussion, especially drums and rattles, are common accompaniment to keep the rhythm steady for the singers, who generally use their native language or non-lexical vocables (syllable sounds outside of language). Traditional music usually begins with slow and steady beats that grow gradually faster and more emphatic, while various flourishes like drum and rattle tremolos, shouts and accented patterns add variety and signal changes in performance for singers and dancers.

Although each Native American group can be characterized by their own distinct genres and styles, certain aspects of style can be found with similarities among native groups who would have been neighboring tribes. These similarities are even further expanded upon when music and instruments are shared between each tribe, making it easy to find certain characteristics in frequent use. Melodies usually consist of a scale simpler than the classical eight-pitch scale of eastern culture, often finding itself in the pentatonic or tritonic scale.

The voice can range from a tense, nasal, or relaxed sound, and consist of higher timbres specifically for male vocalists where falsetto is common. Vocal vibrato, when it occurs, is a rapid pulsating of different pitches as a more ornamental effect. Rhythmic patterns often can be found in meters of two or three and account for the vocal rhythms and syncopation in order to incorporate it into the pattern. Call and response patterns are common in vocal parts and ostinato may be included in the percussion part as well.

Drums consist of types ranging from single headed, double headed, and kettle drums. Other percussive instrumentation consist of rattles and shakers, and made out of things like turtle shells. In addition to percussive instruments and vocals, a common sound in Native American music is instrumentation like flutes, whistles, and other instruments that produce sound from the player&#x27;s breath (horns, pipes, etc.). Instruments with strings that may be struck, plucked, or bowed include that like the musical bow which originated to the Americas, but does not appear often in contemporary indigenous music. Other stringed instruments include native guitars and fiddles whose structure and composition vary from tribe to tribe.

A study made in 2016 analyzed the musical features of indigenous music in relation to social contexts and lyrical subject. Upon analyzing over 2,000 songs from Frances Densmore&#x27;s collection of native music, the study was able to find even the relation between subjects like love in songs, and pitch variety and tessitura. Love songs could be characterized with high tessituras and spacious melodies, with larger intervals and ranges. They are also, in many cases, perceived as &quot;sad&quot;: pertaining to departure, loss or longing. This explains the relationship between the lyrical subject and relatively slow melodic movement and low dynamics. Hiding-game songs, such as those associated with &quot;moccasin, hand and hiding-stick or hiding-bones games,&quot; were found with a significantly low average duration and small pitch range and variety. They also found that &quot;healing songs,&quot; and their characteristic of a narrow range and comparatively increased repetition of low notes, was likely intended to create a soothing sound that would ease discomfort in the event when a healing song would be sung. Regarding the music of specific people, they found that Yuman nature songs often have a small range, a descending melodic movement, and frequent repeated musical motifs. The Densmore collection also characterizes war songs as having a wider range, higher register, and greater diversity in duration and pitch. In comparison, dance songs also have these distinctions, although they can be found in the opposite sense, as dance songs are often found with lower registers. Dance songs are also similar to animal songs in range, pitch variety, and primary register.

This study also maintains a significant view that many of these characteristics (&quot;pitch height, tempo, dynamics, and variability&quot;) have a direct relationship with emotional response, bringing out such response regardless of culture, meaning that similar characteristics of one culture&#x27;s music and its function will often be found in another culture&#x27;s for the same function. This is how Shanahan, Neubarth, and Conklin were able to use Densmore&#x27;s collection of over 2,000 songs to create an analysis of comparison between subject and musical characteristic.

=== Song texts and sources ===
Native American song texts include both public pieces and secret songs, said to be &quot;ancient and unchanging&quot;, which are used for only sacred and ceremonial purposes. There are also public sacred songs, as well as ritual speeches that are sometimes perceived as musical because of their use of rhythm and melody. These ritual speeches often directly describe the events of a ceremony, and the reasons and ramifications of the night.

Vocables, or lexically meaningless syllables, are a common part of many kinds of Native American songs. They frequently mark the beginning and end of phrases, sections or songs themselves. Often songs make frequent use of vocables and other untranslatable elements. Songs that are translatable include historical songs, like the Navajo &quot;Shi&#x27; naasha&#x27;&quot;, which celebrates the end of Navajo internment in Fort Sumner, New Mexico in 1868. Tribal flag songs and national anthems are also a major part of the Native American musical corpus, and are a frequent starter to public ceremonies, especially powwows. Native American music also includes a range of courtship songs, dancing songs and popular American or Canadian tunes like &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, &quot;Jambalaya&quot; and &quot;Sugar Time&quot;. Many songs celebrate harvest, planting season or other important times of year.

== Societal role ==

Native American music plays a vital role in history and education, with ceremonies and stories orally passing on ancestral customs to new generations. Native American ceremonial music is traditionally said to originate from deities or spirits, or from particularly respected individuals. Rituals are shaped by every aspect of a song, dance, and costuming, and each aspect informs about the &quot;makers, wearers and symbols important to the nation, tribe, village, clan, family, or individual&quot;. Native Americans perform stories through song, music, and dance, and the historical facts thus propagated are an integral part of Native American beliefs. Epic legends and stories about cultural heroes are a part of tribal music traditions, and these tales are often an iconic part of local culture. They can vary slightly from year to year, with leaders recombining and introducing slight variations. The Pueblo composes a number of new songs each year in a committee that uses dreams and visions.

Some Native Americans view songs as &#x27;property&#x27; owned by the tribe or individual who first perceived it. For example, if an individual received the song in a dream or vision, the music would belong to that individual, and that individual would have the power to give the song to another. In other cases, the music would be the property of the peoples from which it originated.

The styles and purposes of music vary greatly between and among each Native American tribe. However, a common concept amongst many indigenous groups is a conflation of music and power. For example, the Pima people feel many of their songs were given in the beginning and sung by the Creator. It was believed that some people then have more of an inclination to musical talent than others because of an individual&#x27;s peculiar power.

=== Gender ===

Within various Native American communities, gender plays an important role in music. Men and women play sex-specific roles in many musical activities. Instruments, songs and dances are often particular to one or the other sex, and many musical settings are strictly controlled by sex. In modern powwows, women play a vital role as backup singers and dancers. The Cherokee people, for example, hold dances before stickball games. At these pre-game events, men and women perform separate dances and follow separate regulations. Men will dance in a circle around a fire, while women dance in place. Men sing their own songs, while women have their songs sung for them by an elder. Whereas the men&#x27;s songs invoke power, the women&#x27;s songs draw power away from the opposing stickball team. In some societies, there are customs where certain ceremonial drums are to be played by men only. For the Southern Plains Indians, it is believed that the first drum was given to a woman by the Great Spirit, who instructed her to share it with all women of native nations. However, there also exist prohibitions against women sitting at the Beg Drum.

Many tribal music cultures have a relative paucity of traditional women&#x27;s songs and dances, especially in the Northeast and Southeast regions. The Southeast is, however, home to a prominent women&#x27;s musical tradition in the use of leg rattles for ceremonial stomp and friendship dances, and the women&#x27;s singing during Horse and Ball Game contests. The West Coast tribes of North America tend to more prominence in women&#x27;s music, with special women&#x27;s love songs, medicine songs and handgame songs; the Southwest is particularly diverse in women&#x27;s musical offerings, with major ceremonial, instrumental and social roles in dances. Women also play a vital ceremonial role in the Sun Dance of the Great Plains and Great Basin, and sing during social dances. Shoshone women still sang the songs of the Ghost Dance into the 1980s.

== History ==
Music and history are tightly interwoven in Native American life. A tribe&#x27;s history is constantly told and retold through music, which keeps alive an oral narrative of history. These historical narratives vary widely from tribe to tribe and are an integral part of tribal identity. However, their historical authenticity cannot be verified; aside from supposition and some archaeological evidence, the earliest documentation of Native American music came with the arrival of European explorers. Musical instruments and pictographs depicting music and dance have been dated as far back as the 7th century. However, archaeological evidence shows that musical instruments in North America date to at least the Archaic period (ca. 8000–1000 BC), which includes instruments such as turtle shell rattles.

Bruno Nettl refers to the style of the Great Basin area as the oldest style and common throughout the entire continent before Mesoamerica but continued in only the Great Basin and in the lullaby, gambling, and tale genres around the continent. A style featuring relaxed vocal technique and the rise may have originated in Mesoamerican Mexico and spread northward, particularly into the California-Yuman and Eastern music areas. According to Nettl, these styles also feature &quot;relative&quot; rhythmic simplicity in drumming and percussion, with isometric material and pentatonic scales in the singing, and motives created from shorter sections into longer ones.

While this process occurred, three Asian styles may have influenced North American music across the Bering Strait, all featuring pulsating vocal technique and possibly evident in recent Paleo-Siberian tribes such as Chuckchee, Yukaghir, Koryak. Also, these may have influenced the Plains-Pueblo, Athabascan, and Inuit-Northwest Coast areas. According to Nettl, the boundary between these southward and the above northward influences are the areas of greatest musical complexity: the Northwest Coast, Pueblo music, and Navajo music. Evidence of influences between the Northwest Coast and Mexico are indicated, for example, by bird-shaped whistles. The Plains-Pueblo area has influenced and continues to influence the surrounding cultures, with contemporary musicians of all tribes learning Plains-Pueblo-influenced pantribal genres such as Peyote songs.

=== Influence ===
During his time in the United States, composer Antonín Dvořák maintained that the future of the American voice in music lay in African American and Native American music, and supported their growth in the U.S. He had a goal to discover &quot;American Music&quot; and called upon American composers to look to these cultures of music for study and inspiration. (While Native American and African American musical roots are rather different, they share similar characteristics such as featured pentatonic melodies and complex rhythms.)

In this study of the American sound, he wrote:
The music of the people is like a rare and lovely flower growing amidst encroaching weeds. Thousands pass it, while others trample it underfoot, and thus the chances are that it will perish before it is seen by the one discriminating spirit who will prize it above all else.

During this time he also wrote his Symphony No. 9, From the New World, which would become one of his greatest successes.

Before the symphony&#x27;s performance, he made it clear the fact that &#x27;the work was written under the direct influence of a serious study of the national music of North American Indians.&#x27; Although at this time, Dvořák was under the impression that Native American music was more similar to African American music than it truly was, due to the presence of pentatonic melodies in songs of each culture.

==Academic study==
Archaeological evidence of Native American music dates as far back as the Archaic period (ca. 8000–1000 BC). However, the earliest written documentation comes from the arrival of European explorers on the American continent, and the earliest academic research comes from the late 19th century. During that period, early musicologists and folklorists collected and studied Native American music, and propounded theories about indigenous styles. 

In the early 20th century, more systematic research began. It was led by comparative musicologists like Frances Densmore, Natalie Curtis, George Herzog and Helen Heffron Roberts. Densmore was the most prolific of the era, publishing more than one hundred works on Native American music. As a child, Densmore gained an appreciation for indigenous music by listening to the Dakota peoples, and throughout her life was able to record over a thousand songs performed by Native Americans in fifty plus years, beginning in 1907. One distinction that makes her work so valuable, is that many of her recordings were conducted with more elderly individuals with little influence from Western musical tradition, and involve an impressively large range in geographical origin. Many of the recordings she made are now held in the Library of Congress for researchers and tribal delegations.

Most recently, since the 1950s, Native American music has been a part of ethnomusicological research, studied by Bruno Nettl, William Powers and David McAllester, among others.

== Music areas ==

Nettl uses the following music areas which approximately coincide with Wissler, Kroeber, and Driver&#x27;s cultural areas: Inuit-Northwest coast, Great Basin, California-Yuman, Plains-Pueblo, Athabascan, and Eastern.

===Southwest===


Native Americans of the Southwestern United States were limited to idiophones and aerophones as mediums to sound production beginning date in the seventh century. The applicable idiophones included: plank resonators, footed drums, percussion stones, shaken idiophones, vessel rattles, and copper and clay bells. The applicable aerophones included bullroarers, decomposable whistles and flutes, clay resonator whistles, shell trumpets and prehistoric reed instruments. The wood flute was of particular significance.

Arid American Southwest is home to two broad groupings of closely related cultures, the Pueblo and Athabaskan. The Southern Athabaskan Navajo and Apache tribes sing in Plains-style nasal vocals with unblended monophony, while the Pueblos emphasize a relaxed, low range and highly blended monophonic style. Athabaskan songs are swift and use drums or rattles, as well as an instrument unique to this area, the Apache fiddle, or &quot;Tsii&#x27;edo&#x27;a&#x27;tl&quot; meaning &quot;wood that sings&quot; in the Apache language.

Pueblo songs are complex and meticulously detailed, usually with five sections divided into four or more phrases characterized by detailed introductory and cadential formulas. They are much slower in tempo than Athabaskan songs, and use various percussion instruments as accompaniment.

Nettl describes Pueblo music, including Hopi, Zuni, Taos Pueblo, San Ildefonso Pueblo, Santo Domingo Pueblo, and many others, as one of the most complex on the continent, featuring increased length and number of scale tones (hexatonic and heptatonic common), variety of form, melodic contour, and percussive accompaniment, ranges between an octave and a twelfth, with rhythmic complexity equal to the Plains sub-area. He cites the Kachina dance songs as the most complex songs and Hopi and Zuni material as the most complex of the Pueblo, while Tanoan and Keresan music is simpler and intermediate between the Plains and western Pueblos. The music of the Pima and Tohono O&#x27;odham is intermediary between the Plains-Pueblo and the California-Yuman music areas, with melodic movement of the Yuman, though including the rise, and the form and rhythm of the Pueblo.

He describes Southern Athabascan music, that of the Apache and Navajo, as the simplest next to the Great Basin style, featuring strophic form, tense vocals using pulsation and falsetto, tritonic and tetratonic scales in triad formation, simple rhythms and values of limited duration (usually only two per song), arc-type melodic contours, and large melodic intervals with a predominance of major and minor thirds and perfect fourths and fifths with octave leaps not rare. Peyote songs share characteristics of Apache music and Plains-Pueblo music having been promoted among the Plains by the Apache people.

He describes the structural characteristics of California-Yuman music, including that of Pomo, Miwak, Luiseno, Catalineno, and Gabrielino, and the Yuman tribes, including, Mohave, Yuman, Havasupai, Maricopa, as using the rise in almost all songs, a relaxed nonpulsating vocal technique (like European classical music), a relatively large amount of isorhythmic material, some isorhythmic tendencies, simple rhythms, pentatonic scales without semitones, an average melodic range of an octave, sequence, and syncopated figures such as a sixteenth-note, eight-note, sixteenth-note figure. The form of rise used varies throughout the area, usually being rhythmically related to the preceding non-rise section but differing in melodic material or pitch. The rise may be no higher than the highest pitch of the original section, but will contain a much larger number of higher pitches. In California the non-rise is usually one reiterate phrase, the rise being the phrase transposed an octave higher, the Yumans use a non-rise of long repeated sections each consisting of several phrases, the rise being three to five phrases performed only once, and in southern California the previous two and progressive forms are found. A distinctively Californian instrument is the clapper stick, a percussion instrument made by splitting an elderberry branch used to accompany singers and dancers.

In Southern California today, the traditional music of the Cahuilla is kept alive in the performance of the Bird songs. The Bird songs are a song cycle depicting the story of the southward migration of the Cahuilla people and also contain lessons on life as well as other topics. Altogether, they make up more than 300 pieces of music, traditionally performed in a specific sequence. Performances of the Bird songs would begin at dusk and end at dawn, each night for a week, until the song cycle was complete. As such, physical and vocal dexterity were highly sought after attributes within performers.

===Eastern Woodlands===

Inhabiting a wide swath of the United States and Canada, Indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands, according to Nettl, can be distinguished by antiphony (call and response style singing), which does not occur in other areas. Their territory includes Maritime Canada, New England, U.S. Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes and Southeast regions. Songs are rhythmically complex, characterized by frequent metric changes and a close relationship to ritual dance. Flutes and whistles are solo instruments, and a wide variety of drums, rattles and striking sticks are played. Nettl describes the Eastern music area as the region between the Mississippi River and the Atlantic. The most complex styles are that of the Southeastern Creek, Yuchi, Cherokee, Choctaw, Iroquois and their language group, with the simpler style being that of the Algonquian language group including Delaware and Penobscot. The Algonquian-speaking Shawnee have a relatively complex style influenced by the nearby southeastern tribes.

The characteristics of this entire area include short iterative phrases; reverting relationships; shouts before, during, and after singing anhemitonic pentatonic scales; simple rhythms and meter and, according to Nettl, antiphonal or responsorial techniques including &quot;rudimentary imitative polyphony&quot;. Melodic movement tends to be gradually descending throughout the area and vocals include a moderate amount of tension and pulsation.

===Plains===

Extending across the American Midwest into Canada, Plains-area music is nasal, with high pitches and frequent falsettos, with a terraced descent (a step-by-step descent down an octave) in an unblended monophony. Strophes use incomplete repetition, meaning that songs are divided into two parts, the second of which is always repeated before returning to the beginning.

Large double-sided skin drums are characteristic of the Plains tribes, and solo end-blown flutes (flageolet) are also common.

Nettl describes the central Plains Indians, from Canada to Texas: Blackfoot, Crow, Dakota, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, and Comanche, as the most typical and simple sub-area of the Plains-Pueblo music area. This area&#x27;s music is characterized by extreme vocal tension, pulsation, melodic preference for perfect fourths and a range averring a tenth, rhythmic complexity, and increased frequency of tetratonic scales. The musics of the Arapaho and Cheyenne intensify these characteristics, while the northern tribes, especially Blackfoot music, feature simpler material, smaller melodic ranges, and fewer scale tones.

Nettl Arapaho music includes ceremonial and secular songs, such as the ritualistic Sun Dance, performed in the summer when the various bands of the Arapaho people would come together. Arapaho traditional songs consist of two sections exhibiting terraced descent, with a range greater than an octave and scales between four and six tones. Other ceremonial songs were received in visions, or taught as part of a man&#x27;s initiations into a society for his age group. Secular songs include a number of social dances, such as the triple meter round dances and songs to inspire warriors or recent exploits. There are also songs said to be taught by a guardian spirit, which should be sung only when the recipient is near death.

===Great Basin===
Music of the Great Basin is simple, discreet and ornate, characterized by short melodies with a range smaller than an octave, moderately-blended monophony, relaxed and open vocals and, most unusually, paired-phrase structure, in which a melodic phrase, repeated twice, is alternated with one to two additional phrases. A song of this type might be diagrammed as follows: AA BB CC AA BB CC, etc.

Nettl describes the music of the sparsely settled Great Basin, including most of desert Utah and Nevada (Paiute, Ute, Shoshoni) and some of southern Oregon (Modoc and Klamath), as &quot;extremely simple,&quot; featuring melodic ranges averaging just over a perfect fifth, many tetratonic scales, and short forms. The majority of songs are iterative with each phrase repeated once, though occasional songs with multiple repetitions are found. Many Modoc and Klamath songs contain only one repeated phrase and many of their scales only two to three notes (ditonic or tritonic). This style was carried to the Great Plains by the Ghost Dance religion which originated among the Paiute, and very frequently features paired-phrase patterns and a relaxed nonpulsating vocal style. Herzog attributes the similarly simple lullabies, song-stories, and gambling songs found all over the continent historically to the music of the Great Basin which was preserved through relative cultural isolation and low population.

===Northwest Coast===
Open vocals with monophony are common in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, though polyphony also occurs (this is the only area of North America with native polyphony). Chromatic intervals accompanying long melodies are also characteristic, and rhythms are complex and declamatory, deriving from speech. Instrumentation is more diverse than in the rest of North America, and includes a wide variety of whistles, flutes, horns and percussion instruments.

Nettl describes the music of the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw, Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsimshian, Makah, and Quileute as some of the most complex on the continent, with the music of the Salish nations (Nlaka&#x27;pamux, Nuxálk, and Sliammon, and others directly east of the Northwest tribes) as being intermediary between these Northwest Coast tribes and Inuit music. The music of the Salish tribes, and even more so the Northwest coast, intensifies the significant features of Inuit music, see below, however their melodic movement is often pendulum-type (&quot;leaping in broad intervals from one limit of the range to the other&quot;). The Northwest coast music also &quot;is among the most complicated on the continent, especially in regard to rhythmic structure,&quot; featuring intricate rhythmic patterns distinct from but related to the vocal melody and rigid percussion. He also reports unrecorded use of incipient polyphony in the form of drones or parallel intervals in addition to antiphonal and responorial forms. Vocals are extremely tense, producing dynamic contrast, ornamentation, and pulsation, and also often using multiple sudden accents in one held tone.

===Arctic===
The Inuit of Alaska, Northwest Territories, Yukon Territory, Nunavut and Greenland are well known for their throat-singing, an unusual method of vocalizing found only in a few cultures worldwide. The traditional Inuit form of throat singing usually involves two females in a face to face position, where one performer sets a rhythmic pattern with voiced or unvoiced sounds, and the other fills in the gaps of the rhythm with these sounds. These sounds are very different from that of Tuvan throat singing, which includes overtones of whistling and nasal sounds, but most prominently a low &#x27;growling&#x27; sound. They instead produce sounds through inhalation or exhalation, most often a mixture of both in fast pace, producing an athletic musical performance. Throat-singing is used as the basis for a game among the Inuit where each performer attempts to keep up their pace and rhythm of the duet without failing. The winner of this game is the one to beat the largest number of people in these contests. Narrow-ranged melodies and declamatory effects are common, as in the Northwest. Repeated notes mark the ends of phrases. Box drums, which are found elsewhere, are common, as is a tambourine-like hand drum. In addition, the peoples of the Arctic used the bull-roarer for children&#x27;s toys or for a ritual which would harden snow for easier travel. Nettl describes &quot;Eskimo&quot; music as some of the simplest on the continent, listing characteristics including recitative-like singing, complex rhythmic organization, relatively small melodic range averaging about a sixth, prominence of major thirds and minor seconds melodically, with undulating melodic movement.

=== Caribbean ===
Many styles of music existed amongst the indigenous people of the Caribbean islands, and the Taíno are a noteworthy example. In terms of vocals, Taíno songs typically took strophic form, where lyrics change over a constant melody for each verse. Additionally, when singing in large groups, Taíno songs often involved one vocal soloist and an entire indigenous choir singing melodic lines back and forth in a form of call and response. Additionally, like most indigenous music of North America, Taíno songs were based around the 5-pitch, pentatonic scale.

As for Taíno instrumentation, both the guiro and maracas were believed to have originated from the Taíno in modern-day Puerto Rico. The guiro is a percussion instrument made by carving shells of certain fruits and leaving parallel notch marks on the surface. It is typically played with an accompanying stick or wire fork called &quot;pua&quot;. By rubbing the &quot;pua&quot; on the carved shell, a ratchety and rasping sound is elicited and like most percussive instruments, the purpose of the guiro is providing a feeling of beat to the music. Maracas are another percussive instrument. They are made from the edible figs of the Higuera tree, which cannot be too big nor small. Once the pulp is removed from the fruit. pebbles are added to the inside of the fruit shell through two holes bored into its surface. A handle is then added to finish the crafting of the instrument. Maracas are played by shaking the tiny pebble-containing fruit husks with the handles. Another instrument includes the Fotuto, which was made via the seashells of marine species such as C&quot;haronia variegata,&quot; a species of sea snail. Indigenous Taíno blew through the small orifices located on the shells, which produced certain bass tones. Fotuto not only had its uses in musical festivities, but also acted as an effective tool for alerting Taíno fisherman of bad weather.

A prominent aspect of Taíno music is that of &quot;Areitos.&quot; Described by Spanish conquistadors as musical events ranging from rituals, celebrations, work songs, funeral observances, and drunken parties, &quot;Areito&quot; may have simply meant &quot;group&quot; or &quot;activity&quot; in the native Taíno language. Ultimately, &quot;Areitos&quot; became more than socioreligious musical events. As Spanish colonists began exploiting the Taíno and imposing Spanish culture, &quot;Areitos&quot; became a symbol of indigenous defiance and resistance. Reports exist of a Taíno female chief named Anacona, who ruled Xaragua (modern day Port-au-Prince) and led native revolts after the death of her brother at the hands of Spanish colonists. She also held &quot;Areito&quot; performances with many of her serving maidens which included songs that described the cruelty and malice of the Spanish colonists in their treatment of the Taíno as well as the blissfulness of life before the Spanish made first contact with the natives. In fact,19th century Cuban Composer Antonio Bachiller y Morales&#x27;s &quot;poem-song&quot; is dedicated to Anacona and her heroic story. &quot;Areito&quot; dances varied widely in style with typical performances including line dances, dances that did not move more than one or two steps in either direction, and call-response styles akin to country dancing.

=== Northeastern Mexico ===
A primary style of indigenous music in Northeastern Mexico is that of the Huastec/Huaxtec indigenous group (otherwise known as Huapango style). Instruments that are emblematic of Huapango style include three-holed flutes made from sugar cane wood, small ocarinas (known as &quot;Kokowilotl),&quot; bronze bells, and a wide array of percussion instruments such as turtle shells and slit-drums known as &quot;nukup or teponaxtli.&quot;

All instruments listed above have origins that predate the arrival of any settler colonialists or foreign presence in modern-day Mexico. Many of the instruments are deeply entrenched with Huastec beliefs and culture. For example, when making a &quot;teponaxtli,&quot; Huastec belief dictates that the maker must craft the drum beside the roots of the tree that the drum&#x27;s wood originated from. Additionally, the crafter must make offerings to the drum, leaving food, drinks, candles, and prayers to ensure that it maintains a good sound.

Eventually, with the arrival of Spanish colonialists and African slaves into Huastec territory, Huapango style evolved into what is known as &quot;Son Huasteco&quot;, a style more indicative of the original indigenous music infused with Spanish and African influences. With Spanish influence came the introduction of new instruments such as the &quot;Jarana (&quot;a smaller five-stringed guitar)&quot;, Huapanguera (an eight-stringed baroque guitar),&quot; and the violin. In fact, the &quot;Son Huasteco&quot; style of violin playing is notably unique in comparison to other modern-day styles in Mexico. Songs are most often written with a 6/8 time signature (which some attribute to West-African influences), and the violinist (along with a &quot;Jarana&quot; and &quot;Huapanguera&quot; player to form a trio) has flexibility in manipulating the tempo, slowing and speeding the music as they see fit, which is very akin to a tempo rubato, although to a slightly larger degree. in fact one could say that &quot;Son Huasteco&quot; is rather improvisatory, both in speed and pitch.

&quot;Son Huasteco&quot; music frequently involves singing too. Songs are often about natural environment, elements of daily life, strong emotions, and stories. The singer will typically sing poetic verses in a strophic or verse-repeating form. Then, the singer may give the spotlight to the musicians, where a violin or &quot;Jarana&quot; may improvise for a verse or two. Then, the singer will continue singing their verses again in an A-B-A format. In some songs, the singer and instrumentalists may continue taking turns being the focus of the music, switching places until the song ends.

Most &quot;Son Huasteco&quot; music typically has a secular basis. However, there does exist indigeous styles of music in Mexico more centered around ritualistic and religious purposes. These styles are known as &quot;Son Costumbre&quot; or perhaps more simply, &quot;Son Indígena.&quot; This branch of Huastec music only involves music and dance as opposed to the key feature of singing in most &quot;Son Huasteco&quot; styles. One instance where &quot;Son Costumbre&quot; is used for rituals is for corn harvesting, an essential food sources for the Huastec region. Sets of &quot;Canarios&quot;, or small pieces, are played during important ceremonies such as weddings to pray to the gods for a successful corn harvest. These rituals are known as &quot;Tlamanes.&quot; Interestingly, the Harp is regarded in a particularly sacred position by Huastec culture, to the point where Harp music can only be played for religious ceremonies. For example, harps like the &quot;kuarsono&quot; (a 22 or 24-stringed harp) were played to pray to the gods for rain when water was scarce or for Day of the Dead celebrations (which are known as &quot;Xantolo&quot;).

==Intertribal music==

Many music genres span multiple tribes. Pan-tribalism is the syncretic adoption of traditions from foreign communities. Since the rise of the United States and Canada, Native Americans have forged a common identity, and invented pan-Indian music, most famously including powwows, peyote songs, and honor or victory songs.

Apache-derived peyote songs, prayers in the Native American Church, use a descending melody and monophony. Rattles and water drums are used, in a swift tempo. Ceremonial songs from the Great Plains provide the foundation for intertribal powwows, which feature music with terraced descent and nasal vocals, both Plains characteristic features.

An example of an intertribal song is the AIM Song, which uses vocables to make it accessible to people of all tribes. However, because of its origins from the Lakota and Ojibwe people, it still retains some Northern Plains and Great Lakes characteristics, called &quot;Northern&quot; style, as opposed to the slower &quot;Southern&quot; style.

John Trudell (Santee Dakota) launched a new genre of spoken word poetry in the 1980s, beginning with &quot;Aka Graffiti Man&quot; (1986). The next decade saw further innovations in Native American popular music, including Robbie Robertson (of The Band) releasing a soundtrack for a documentary, &quot;Music for the Native Americans&quot;, that saw limited mainstream success, as well as Verdell Primeaux and Johnny Mike&#x27;s modernized peyote songs, which they began experimenting with on &quot;Sacred Path: Healing Songs of the Native American Church&quot;.

Waila (or chicken scratch music of the Tohono O&#x27;odham) has gained performers like the Joaquin Brothers fame across Native American communities, while hip hop crews like WithOut Rezervation and Robby Bee &amp; the Boyz From the Rez (&quot;Reservation of Education&quot;) have a distinctively Native American flourish to hip hop. Meanwhile, young Native musicians such as Red Earth (see &quot;Zia Soul&quot; (2003) ), DJ Abel, Derek Miller, Ethnic DeGeneration, War Water, and Casper are producing outstanding underground music (ranging from hip-hop to funk to reggae to metal) defying stereotypes of Native people (without label support).

American Indian opera is an intertribal music tradition, created when Gertrude Bonnin, a Yankton Dakota activist collaborated with a classical composer William Hanson to create the opera, &quot;Sun Dance&quot; in 1913. Cherokee Nation mezzo-soprano opera singer, Barbara McAlister has performed in many opera troupes and has sung at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera House. Brulé Lakota band Brulé and the American Indian Rock Opera create fullscale contemporary musical performances, including &quot;Concert for Reconciliation of the Cultures.&quot;

===Native American flute===
The Native American flute has achieved some measure of fame for its distinctive sound, used in a variety of new age and world music recordings. Its music was used in courtship, healing, meditation, and spiritual rituals.

The late 1960s saw a roots revival centered around the flute, with a new wave of flautists and artisans like Doc Tate Nevaquaya (Comanche) and Carl Running Deer. Notable and award-winning Native American flautists include: Mary Youngblood, Kevin Locke, Charles Littleleaf, Jay Red Eagle, Robert Tree Cody, Robert Mirabal, Joseph Firecrow, and Jeff Ball. Tommy Wildcat is a contemporary flautist, who makes traditional Cherokee river cane flutes. Of special importance is R. Carlos Nakai (&quot;Changes&quot;, 1983), who has achieved Gold record status and mainstream credibility for his mixture of the flute with other contemporary genres.

The Native American flute is the only flute in the world constructed with two air chambers – there is a wall inside the flute between the top (slow) air chamber and the bottom chamber which has the whistle and finger holes. The top chamber also serves as a secondary resonator, which gives the flute its distinctive sound. There is a hole at the bottom of the &quot;slow&quot; air chamber and a (generally) square hole at the top of the playing chamber. A block (or &quot;bird&quot;) with a spacer is tied on top of the flute to form a thin, flat airstream for the whistle hole (or &quot;window&quot;). Some more modern flutes use an undercut either in the block or the flute to eliminate the need for a spacer.

The &quot;traditional&quot; Native American flute was constructed using measurements based on the body – the length of the flute would be the distance from armpit to wrist, the length of the top air chamber would be one fist-width, the distance from the whistle to the first hole also a fist-width, the distance between holes would be one thumb-width, and the distance from the last hole to the end would generally be one fist-width. Unlike Western music, traditional American Indian music had no standard pitch reference such as A440, so flutes were not standardized for pitch.

Historic Native American flutes are generally tuned to a variation of the minor pentatonic scale (such as you would get playing the black keys on a piano), which gives the instrument its distinctive plaintive sound. Recently some makers have begun experimenting with different scales, giving players new melodic options. Also, modern flutes are generally tuned in concert keys (such as A or D) so that they can be easily played with other instruments. The root keys of modern Native American flutes span a range of about three and a half octaves, from C2 to A5.

Native American flutes most commonly have either 5 or 6 holes, but instruments can have anything from no holes to seven (including a thumb hole). Various makers employ different scales and fingerings for their flutes.

Some modern Native American flutes are called &quot;drone&quot; flutes, and are two (or more) flutes built together. Generally, the drone chamber plays a fixed note which the other flute can play against in harmony.

===Drums===

Drums are highly influential in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums and how to play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui type of water drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.

Another type of drum called a foot drum have been found in several southwestern and central-Californian Native American archaeological sites inhabited, or formally inhabited, by the Miwok, Maidu, Nahua, and Hopi Indian tribes. These drums were often semicircle cross-sectioned hollow logs laid over wood covered &#x27;resonating&#x27; pits positioned according to custom in kivas or dance houses. The foot drums were played by stomping on top of the hollow log with the structure&#x27;s poles used for steadying.

===Awards===
The dedicated Native American Music Awards, which successfully proposed the Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album, was launched in 1998 and continues to be held annually. The Native American Music Awards or N.A.M.A. was the first national awards program for Native American music in North America. The awards were born out of a need for greater recognition for Native American music initiatives and remains the largest professional membership based organization in the world.

From 2001 to 2011, the American Grammy Awards presented an annual award for Best Native American Music Album, and the Canadian Juno Awards present an annual award for Aboriginal Recording of the Year. On April 6, 2011, it was announced that the Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album would be merged with the Best Hawaiian Music Album and Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album categories into a new category, Best Regional Roots Music Album. This change was part of a massive restructuring of Grammy categories.

==Samples==
* is a recording from the Library of Congress, collected by Alice Cunningham Fletcher and Francis La Flesche and published in 1897. The singer is George Miller, who was probably born in about 1852. It was described as: &quot;The true love-song, called by the Omaha Bethae waan, an old designation and not a descriptive name, is sung generally in the early morning, when the lover is keeping his tryst and watching for the maiden to emerge from the tent and go to the spring. They belong to the secret courtship and are sometimes called Me-the-g&#x27;thun wa-an – courting songs. . . . They were sung without drum, bell or rattle, to accent the rhythm, in which these songs is subordinated to tonality and is felt only in the musical phrases. . . . Vibrations for the purpose of giving greater expression were not only affected by the tremolo of the voice, but they were enhanced by waving the hand, or a spray of artemesia before the lips, while the body often swayed gently to the rhythm of the song (Fletcher, 1894, p. 156).&quot;
* Ghost Dance and gambling song from the Paiute and Arapaho Native Americans from the Library of Congress&#x27; &quot;Emile Berliner and the Birth of the Recording Industry Collection&quot;; performed by James Mooney (possibly along with Charles Mooney; neither are believed to be Native Americans) on July 5, 1894

<text>The 63rd (Royal Naval) Division was a United Kingdom infantry division of the First World War. It was originally formed as the Royal Naval Division at the outbreak of the war, from Royal Navy and Royal Marine reservists and volunteers, who were not needed for service at sea. For RN personnel, the designation HMS &quot;Victory IV&quot; was used. The division fought at Antwerp in 1914 and at Gallipoli in 1915. In 1916, following many losses among the original naval volunteers, the division was transferred to the British Army as the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division, re-using the number from the disbanded second-line 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) Division Territorial Force. As an Army formation, it fought on the Western Front for the remainder of the war.

==Origins==

===Advanced Base Force===

When the war began, a Marine Brigade of four infantry battalions was formed from men of the Royal Marine Light Infantry and Royal Marine Artillery. The brigade was to be an Advanced Base Force, according to a pre-war plan to furnish the Admiralty with a means to take, fortify or defend temporary naval bases for fleet operations or the supply of army field forces. The recruits included regular marines and those mobilised from the Fleet Reserve; each battalion was drawn from one of the big naval depot ports—Chatham, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Deal—and named accordingly.

===Royal Naval Division===

On 16 August, Winston Churchill the First Lord of the Admiralty, decided to embody two more naval brigades with surplus men of the Naval Reserve, to join with the Marine Brigade to produce a composite Royal Naval Division. A few petty officers and ratings were transferred from the navy to provide a cadre and some officers were provided by the army but most of the recruits were reservists or men who had volunteered on the outbreak of war. The eight battalions were named after naval commanders, Drake, Benbow, Hawke, Collingwood, Nelson, Howe, Hood and Anson, later being numbered from 1st to 8th. The division was not provided with medical, artillery or engineer units, consisting solely of lightly equipped infantry. Many of the trained men were then reclaimed for fleet service and recruits were taken over at the request of the War Office, from oversubscribed north country regiments. Training was slow, except for the Marine Brigade which had its own infrastructure, because resources were needed for the rapid expansion of the army and naval ratings were not issued with field equipment or khaki uniforms before being embarked for overseas service. On 26 August, the Marine Brigade was sent to Ostend to reinforce the Belgian garrison, after German cavalry had appeared in the area. The brigade returned on 1 September after the scare subsided and on 3 September the Admiralty decided to train the two Naval Reserve brigades as infantry, to form an infantry division with the Marine Brigade. Rifles were drawn from Royal Navy stocks and only arrived at the end of September; these were older Charger-Loading Lee–Enfields rather than the modern Short Magazine Lee–Enfields issued to the army.

==Belgium==

===Ostend===
Following early Belgian and Entente defeats in the German invasion of Belgium and cut off from the rest of the Allies by the German advance, the majority of the Belgian army fell back towards the fortified port of Antwerp, in late August 1914. Belgian troops were also withdrawn from ports along the Belgian coast. The Admiralty wanted to deny the Germans submarine bases in Belgian ports for operations in the English Channel. On 24 August, German cavalry patrols were reported near Ostend and it was decided to land a small naval detachment to secure the town. Further south, the French armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) conducted the Retreat from Mons, with the German armies driving south-west after them, leaving very few units to guard lines of communication. The Admiralty planned to use the Channel ports as a base to attack German land supply routes, with the Royal Marine Brigade forming the basis of a landing force.

Deal Battalion was still assembling, so only Chatham, Portsmouth and Plymouth battalions were sent to Flanders; two landing at Ostend in the early morning of 27 August and the other the next day. They were ordered to hold the town until Belgian troops who had retreated into France could be transferred and troops arrived on 30 August. The rapid Allied retreat led the War Office to decide that supplies would have to be brought through ports in western France, as the existing arrangements in the Pas de Calais ports were too exposed. This would be more demanding on naval escort ships, leaving too few to support the force at Ostend. The Marines were re-embarked on 31 September and returned to their ports.

===Antwerp===

The division participated in the Siege of Antwerp. The Royal Marine Brigade arrived opposite Lier in requisitioned London buses on 4 October and occupied a position around the northern fringe of Lier, which turned out to be sections of a shallow trench between hedgerows, with one strand of wire in front. The two naval brigades arrived early on 6 October to reinforce the Marine Brigade but were diverted to forts 1 to 8 of the inner ring, where the trenches were again found to be shallow and the ground cleared for in front, which made them easily visible to German artillery observers. On the night of intervening trenches between forts 2 and 7 were occupied by the two naval brigades and the 4th and 7th Fortress regiments, with the Belgian 2nd Division and the Marine Brigade in reserve. The British forces under the command of Major-General Archibald Paris were ordered by Winston Churchill to continue the defence for as long as possible and to be ready to cross to the west bank (near The Netherlands frontier) rather than surrender.

The Belgian commanders decided to continue the defence of Antwerp with the garrison troops and move the 2nd Division and the British troops across the Scheldt; it was decided that if forts 1 and 2 were lost, the Royal Naval Division would withdraw at dusk. News arrived that the forts had fallen at and orders were sent to the 2nd Division and the British for a retirement, which began at but the orders failed to reach all of the 1st Naval Brigade, only one battalion of which withdrew. At the mistake was realised as the rest of the division began to cross the river from and moved west, parallel to the Netherlands frontier. The 1st Naval Brigade reached the Scheldt at midnight, only to find that the bridges were being demolished and under a German shrapnel bombardment. The troops crossed using barges and boats and set out for a rendezvous at Zwijndrecht, which was reached at on 9 October. The British moved on to Sint-Gillis-Waas, where information arrived that the Germans had cut the railway at Moerbeke. The commander, Commodore Henderson, decided to head for the Dutch border to the north and at about half the original complement, were interned and about forty stragglers managed to sneak along the border and escape. The men were to spend the rest of the war at Groningen, where they were held in a camp they dubbed HMS Timbertown, a name inspired by the wooden huts where they were quartered.

==Gallipoli==
===Landings===


The division was shipped to Egypt and fought at the Battle of Gallipoli at Anzac Cove and Cape Helles. Casualties before the campaign began included Rupert Brooke, who died at sea from an infected mosquito bite on 23 April 1915. The RND was one of two British divisions (the other being the regular 29th Division) at the Gallipoli landings. Eleven troopships and &quot;Canopus&quot;, &quot;Dartmouth&quot; and &quot;Doris&quot;, two destroyers and trawlers rendezvoused off Bulair before dawn and the warships began a day-long bombardment, just after daybreak. A destroyer made a close pass off the beach and later on, ships&#x27; boats were swung out from the troopships and lines of eight cutters pulled by a trawler made as if to land. In the late afternoon men began to embark on the boats, which headed for the shore just before dark and returned after night fell. During the night Lieutenant-Commander Bernard Freyberg swam ashore and lit flares along the beach, crept inland and observed the Ottoman defences. Freyberg found that the defences were dummies and returned safely to report. Just after dawn, the decoy force sailed south to join the main landings, coming ashore on 30 April.
==Western Front==

===Battle of the Ancre===

After the evacuation of Gallipoli, the RND moved to France where it participated in the final phase of the Battle of the Somme, advancing along the River Ancre to capture Beaucourt. The division had four objectives during the Battle of Ancre, the Dotted Green Line, the German front trench, then the Green Line, the road to Beaucourt station. The road ran along a fortified ridge. The Yellow Line was a trench which lay beyond the road, around the remains of Beaucourt on its south-west edge and the final objective, the Red Line, was beyond Beaucourt, where the division was to consolidate.

The plan was for the battalions to leap-frog towards the final objective. The 1st RMLI, Howe, Hawke and Hood battalions were assigned the Dotted Green Line and the Yellow Line, the 2nd RMLI, Anson, Nelson and Drake battalions were to take the Green and Red lines. When the battle began in the early hours of 13 November, platoons from the 1st RMLI crawled across no-man&#x27;s land towards the German line. A creeping barrage was fired by the British artillery but many casualties were suffered in no-man&#x27;s land, about 50 percent of the total casualties occurring before the first German trench had been captured. German artillery-fire and machine-gun fire was so effective that all company commanders of 1st RMLI were killed before reaching the first objective.

The German trenches had been severely damaged by the British bombardment, the attackers lost direction and leap-frogging broke down. The commander and second-in-command of Drake Battalion were killed and Hawke battalion lost its commander and several company commanders. Freyberg, having been promoted to temporary lieutenant-colonel and command of Hood Battalion, led it to the Green Line and pressed forward with the remaining men of Drake Battalion. The station road served as a landmark and allowed the attackers to orientate themselves and re-organise the attack. The next creeping barrage began on time at and led the British towards the Yellow Line at Beaucourt Station. Nelson, Hawke and Howe battalions had suffered many casualties; Lieutenant-Colonel Burge, Commanding Officer of Nelson Battalion, was killed whilst attacking a fortified section of the Dotted Green Line and Lieutenant-Colonel Wilson DSO, Commanding Officer of Hawke Battalion, was severely wounded attacking the same objective. Lieutenant-Colonel Saunders, Commanding Officer of Anson Battalion, was killed early in the battle but Anson Battalion still managed to capture the Green Line and advance to the Yellow Line, after making contact with the 51st Highland Division to its left. By Beaucourt had been captured.

On 17 October, just before the Battle of the Ancre, Paris was wounded and replaced by Major-General Cameron Shute. Shute was appalled by the un-military &quot;nautical&quot; traditions of the division and made numerous unpopular attempts to stamp out negligent hygiene practices and failures to ensure that weapons were kept clean. Following a particularly critical inspection of the trenches, Sub-Lieutenant A. P. Herbert (later a humorist, legal satirist and Member of Parliament), wrote


===Actions of Miraumont===
On the north bank of the Ancre, the 63rd Division attacked on 17 February, with the 188th Brigade and two battalions of the 189th Brigade, to capture of the road north from Baillescourt Farm towards Puisieux, to gain observation over Miraumont and form a defensive flank on the left, back to the existing front line. Two battalions attacked with a third battalion ready on the right flank, to reinforce them or to co-operate with the 18th Division between the Ancre and the Miraumont road. On the northern flank two infantry companies, engineers and pioneers were placed to establish the defensive flank on the left. The divisional artillery and an army field brigade with guns and provided covering fire, with three field batteries from the 62nd Division further north, to place a protective barrage along the northern flank. The darkness, fog and mud were as bad as on the south bank but the German defence was far less effective. The creeping barrage moved at in four minutes, slower than the rate on the south bank and the Germans in a small number of strong-points were quickly overcome. The objective was reached by and the defensive flank established, the last German strong-point being captured at A German counter-attack the next day was stopped by artillery-fire. The 63rd Division lost and the three attacking divisions took 

===Second Battle of Passchendaele===

The division arrived at Ypres just before the Second Battle of Passchendaele (26 October – 10 November). On 26 October, Immediately to the north of the Canadian Corps, the supporting attack by XVIII Corps involved one brigade each from the 63rd and 58th divisions. The 188th Brigade, of the 63rd Division quickly captured Varlet Farm and Banff House. The centre of the attack was held up on the road between Bray Farm and the village of Wallemolen and the troops dug-in near Source Trench. As dark fell, Banff House was abandoned and the line reformed at Berks House, leaving Banff House and Source Trench the only part of the first objective not occupied. On 30 October, the 63rd Division infantry were caught by German artillery fire at their jumping-off line and made only slight progress in deep mud against German machine-gun fire. The infantry were unable to reach their rendezvous with the Canadians, leaving their troops at Source Farm and Vapour Farm in precarious positions. Two companies later advanced through the Canadian sector to capture Source Trench but were only able to reinforce the Canadian outpost at Source Farm, then form a defensive flank to Vapour Farm. The 63rd Division had from The division was able to close up to the Paddebeek by attacking at night from a method which took more ground than its attacks in October, for a loss of and

<text>Othell Maxie Burns Jr. (born November 8, 1948) is an American politician and academic from the state of Georgia. A member of the Republican Party, Burns has represented the 23rd district in the Georgia State Senate since January 2021. He previously served in the United States House of Representatives from 2003 to 2005, representing . From 2012 to 2017 he was the president of Gordon State College in Barnesville, Georgia.

==Early life and education==
Max Burns was born in Millen, Georgia. Burns received a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, a Master of Business Administration in information systems from Georgia State University and a Doctor of Business Administration from Georgia State University.

== Career ==
Burns also served as a member of the United States Army Reserve from 1973 to 1981. He served as a member of the Screven County Commission from 1993 to 1998 and as chairman towards the end of his tenure.

Prior to his tenure in Congress, he was a professor of information systems at Georgia Southern University&#x27;s College of Business Administration in Statesboro, Georgia. Burns was also a Senior Fulbright Scholar, teaching Corporate Information Management in Sweden. He has also taught in Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea.

Burns has also worked as a consultant to Gulfstream Aerospace and Grinnell Mechanical Products. He also developed the Southern Suppliers&#x27; Network to connect Southeast Georgia&#x27;s small business suppliers to major manufacturers. Earlier in his professional career, the Congressman served in information management positions with Oxford Industries and the North American Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention.

After leaving Congress, Burns was dean of the Mike Cottrell Business School at North Georgia College &amp; State University in Dahlonega, Georgia.

After his final bid to regain his congressional seat, Burns served as senior policy adviser at Thelen, Reid and Priest, LLP in Washington, D.C. He also served as associate dean and chair of the business administration department at the Cottrell School of Business at North Georgia College &amp; State University. In 2011, he was appointed as president of Gordon College. He served in that role until his retirement on December 31, 2017.

In January 2024, Burns co-sponsored S.B.390, which would withhold government funding for any libraries in Georgia affiliated with the American Library Association.

== Elections ==

=== 2002 ===
Burns won the Republican primary for the 12th district, one of two Georgia gained after the 2000 Census. He defeated Barbara Dooley, the wife of University of Georgia coaching legend Vince Dooley.

Initially, Burns was thought to be a significant underdog in the general election. The 12th had been drawn as a Democratic stronghold. Additionally, Burns ran on a very conservative platform. However, the Democratic candidate, Augusta businessman Charles &quot;Champ&quot; Walker, Jr., son of state Senate majority leader Charles Walker, Sr., was dogged by ethical questions and began losing ground during the summer. Eventually, Burns won by a surprising 10-point margin, taking 55% to Walker&#x27;s 45 percent.

=== 2004 ===
Burns was elected president of the Republican freshman class, but was a top Democratic target in the 2004 elections. His 2004 Democratic opponent was Athens-Clarke County Commissioner John Barrow, who beat Burns 52% to 48%.

=== 2006 ===
In May 2005, Burns announced that he would seek a rematch against Barrow in 2006. The state legislature, now controlled by Republicans, had conducted a highly controversial mid-decade redistricting. In the process, they drew Barrow&#x27;s home in Athens out of the district and moved several Republican-leaning Savannah suburbs from the 1st District. Although the result was to make the 12th about five points more African-American than its predecessor, it was also slightly less Democratic.

Barrow narrowly defeated Burns, 50.3% to 49.7%, the closest margin for a Democratic incumbent in the cycle. While Burns won 14 of the district&#x27;s 22 counties, he lost in the two largest counties, Chatham and Richmond, home to Savannah and Augusta respectively. President George W. Bush made two personal appearances campaigning on behalf of former Representative Burns. The first appearance by President Bush was in Savannah, Georgia and the second in Statesboro, Georgia. This was the second time a sitting president has visited Savannah Georgia and first time a sitting president has visited Statesboro Georgia.

<doc id="411849" wikidata="Q689213" url="?curid=411849" title="MK 108 cannon">
<text>The MK 108 (German: &quot;Maschinenkanone&quot;—&quot;machine cannon&quot;) is a 30 mm caliber autocannon manufactured in Germany during World War II by Rheinmetall‑Borsig for use in aircraft.

The cannon saw widespread use as an anti-bomber weapon during the second half of the war, first seen in 1943 in the Bf 110G-2 bomber destroyers and Bf 109G-6/U4. 

Four MK 108s formed the main armament of the Me 262 the next year. It could be found on some versions or optional mountings on practically every other German fighter of the era.

==Development==
The weapon was developed as a private venture by the company in 1940 and was submitted to the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM—Reich Aviation Ministry) in response to a 1942 requirement for a heavy aircraft weapon for use against the Allied heavy bombers appearing over German-controlled regions by then. Testing verified that the autocannon was well suited to this role, requiring on average just four hits with its 85g RDX-load (in a 330g shell) and a resulting strongly brisant high-explosive ammunition, to bring down a heavy bomber such as a B-17 Flying Fortress or B-24 Liberator, and just a single &quot;shattering&quot; hit to down a fighter. In comparison, the otherwise excellent 20 mm MG 151/20 (18g of HE in a 92g shell) required about 15 to 20 hits to down a B-17.

The MK 108 was quickly ordered into production and was installed in a variety of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighter aircraft. It saw first operational service in summer 1943 with the Bf 110G-2 bomber destroyers and in the Bf 109G-6/U4.

==Design details==
===Ammunition===
The cannon used specially-developed 30×90RB mm ammunition—30 mm calibre, 90 mm case length, rebated/reduced rim. Unlike most other weapon rounds, which used traditional brass for the case, the MK 108&#x27;s ammunition used steel cases. Several types of ammunition were developed, including practice, armor-piercing, high-explosive and incendiary. In operation, however, two major ammunition types were used: mine shell and high-explosive incendiary. The mine shell was made by drawn steel (the same way brass cartridge-cases are made) instead of being forged and machined as was the usual practice for cannon shells. This resulted in a shell with a thin but strong wall, which hence had a much larger cavity in which to pack a much larger explosive or incendiary charge than was otherwise possible.

===Construction===
The cannon proved to be relatively light, effective, reliable, compact and easy to manufacture due to its simple construction—80% of the weapon was made from stamped parts, and the number of moving parts was kept to a minimum by using advanced primer ignition blowback (APIB) operation. The simplicity of construction allowed inexperienced workers to make the parts (mostly women).

The MK 108 was optimized for a high rate of fire at the expense of ballistic performance. It was easy to maintain, and its compact size, low weight and electrical priming made it ideal for aircraft installation. 

The cannon&#x27;s distinctive heavy pounding sound and high rate of fire gave it the nickname &quot;pneumatic hammer&quot; amongst Allied aircrews, who feared its destructive power.

===Mechanism===
Normally, gas-operated or recoil-operated mechanisms are used in automatic weapons of rifle calibre and larger because the chamber pressure in such weapons is very high. Therefore, if a simple blowback system (where there is no positive lock between the bolt and barrel) is used, the bolt may recoil and open the breech while the chamber pressure is still high, causing damage to the weapon and split cases. To avoid this, simple blowback guns have to use low-powered cartridges or a very heavy bolt, as discussed in blowback article.

In an Advanced Primer Ignition Blowback design such as the MK 108, the forward motion of the bolt is used instead of a locking mechanism to prevent this premature opening. When the 108 is ready to fire, the bolt and main spring are held back at the rear of the gun, the spring under considerable tension. When the trigger is squeezed, they are released and shoot forward at a high speed. The bolt picks up a cartridge and chambers it, but instead of coming to rest against the breech face, it follows the case a small distance into the chamber—which is of course made specially longer in these guns to accommodate this manoeuvre. Also a cartridge case with a rebated rim is used, so that the extractor claw can hook over the rim and still fit within the chamber.

Primer ignition is timed so that the bolt is still moving forward when the propellant is ignited. The expanding gases from the fired round stop the forward motion of the bolt, then reverse its motion. The key characteristic of the APIB system is that, because the resistance due to the weight of the bolt and the mainspring are supplemented by the bolt&#x27;s considerable forward momentum, the propellant gases are contained in the barrel for critical microseconds, and the projectile will have had time to leave the muzzle, allowing the gas to escape forward and reducing the chamber pressure to a safe level before the bolt and cartridge case emerge from the opposite end. Once they emerge the weapon cycles like other automatic guns, with one significant exception: instead of simply ejecting the spent cartridge case, the 108 reinserts it into the empty link in the ammunition belt. The heavy bolt continues backwards, compressing the main spring. When the spring is fully compressed it begins to expand forwards again, reversing the motion of the bolt and recommencing the cycle. This sequence is repeated until the trigger is released or the ammunition is exhausted. 
The APIB design makes practical the use of far more powerful ammunition than with simple blowback operation, but the length and the speed of the bolt&#x27;s movement within the chamber are limited by the stresses placed on the case by the sliding motion, which takes place under high gas pressure. To keep these within limits either the bolt must be heavy to absorb the pressure, or the barrel must be short to limit the duration of high pressure within the barrel. The operational tradeoff is that a heavy bolt reduces the rate of fire while a short barrel reduces ballistic performance. The designers of the MK 108 opted for a high rate of fire and thus used a relatively light bolt, accepting reduced ballistic performance due to the corresponding necessity of a short barrel. As a result, the MK 108 had a muzzle velocity of only 540 m/s, compared to the approx. 800 m/s for the MG 151/20.

Another significant feature is that, in the APIB system the cycle starts with the bolt open, which prevents an autocannon using the APIB principle from being accurately synchronized with an aircraft&#x27;s propeller.


==Operational usage==
The MK 108 saw widespread use among fighters tasked with shooting down enemy bombers. Some of the aircraft deploying, or intended to be armed with, the MK 108 were Messerschmitt Bf 109, Messerschmitt Bf 110, Messerschmitt Me 163, Messerschmitt Me 262, Focke-Wulf Fw 190, Focke-Wulf Ta 152, Focke-Wulf Ta 154, Heinkel He 162, Heinkel He 219, Horten Ho 229 and Junkers Ju 388.

The MK 108 was also fitted to night fighters in an unusual installation, called &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; (literally &quot;awkward music&quot; or &quot;slanted music&quot;). In this configuration, the cannons were mounted in the fuselage, aiming upwards and &quot;slightly&quot; forwards at an oblique (18 to 30 degree) angle, depending on fitment and aircraft. This allowed the night fighter to attack bombers, often undetected, by approaching from underneath the enemy aircraft - many British heavy bombers had neither weapons on the ventral fuselage nor windows for vision. This installation was so effective that discovery and news of its adoption was much slower than usual in reaching British night-bombing forces, as there were rarely any survivors from the attacks to report the new threat. This system was fitted to some versions of the He 219 Uhu, late-model Bf 110 night fighters, Junkers Ju 88 &amp; 388 and the Dornier Do 217N model. It was also fitted more rarely to the (prototype) Focke-Wulf Ta 154 and Fw 189 along with the planned, two-seat Me 262B-2 jet night-fighter. In the latter case this produced a jet fighter with six MK108 cannons - with the fitment of the projected mass-produced, mid-VHF band FuG 218 radar.

The MK 108 mechanism was scaled up in the MK 112 cannon, using a 55×175RB cartridge. The MK 112 was intended to be fitted in pairs in the nose of Me 262 fighters, with 25 rounds per gun, and also in the nose of later models of the Arado Ar 234 for night fighter duty. Underwing mounts for the twin-engined, high-speed Dornier Do 335 heavy fighter were in development as well. The gun was not finished in time to see operations in World War II. Only 15 prototypes were built; of these 10 were delivered for tests and 5 were kept at the factory for improvements based on expected feedback. Of the ten guns delivered for tests, seven were of an early model, weighing , and three were lighter at — these were both significantly lighter than the slightly smaller, 50-mm calibre, 21-round armed &quot;Bordkanone&quot;-series BK 5 cannon, itself weighing some 540 kg (1,190 lb). The MK 112&#x27;s projectile was supposed to weigh ; of these, were reserved for the explosive. The US captured some of these prototypes and knowledge gleaned from them was incorporated into the experimental US 57 mm T78 autocannon, but this did not see production either.

<text>Sexual dysfunction is difficulty experienced by an individual or partners during any stage of normal sexual activity, including physical pleasure, desire, preference, arousal, or orgasm. The World Health Organization defines sexual dysfunction as a &quot;person&#x27;s inability to participate in a sexual relationship as they would wish&quot;. This definition is broad and is subject to many interpretations. A diagnosis of sexual dysfunction under the DSM-5 requires a person to feel extreme distress and interpersonal strain for a minimum of six months (except for substance- or medication-induced sexual dysfunction). Sexual dysfunction can have a profound impact on an individual&#x27;s perceived quality of sexual life. The term &quot;sexual disorder&quot; may not only refer to physical sexual dysfunction, but to paraphilias as well; this is sometimes termed &quot;disorder of sexual preference&quot;.

A thorough sexual history and assessment of general health and other sexual problems (if any) are important when assessing sexual dysfunction, because it is usually correlated with other psychiatric issues, such as mood disorders, eating and anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia. Assessing performance anxiety, guilt, stress, and worry are integral to the optimal management of sexual dysfunction. Many of the sexual dysfunctions that are defined are based on the human sexual response cycle proposed by William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson, and modified by Helen Singer Kaplan.
==Types==
Sexual dysfunction can be classified into four categories: sexual desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasm disorders, and pain disorders. Dysfunction among men and women are studied in the fields of andrology and gynecology respectively.

===Sexual desire disorders===

Sexual desire disorders or decreased libido are characterized by a lack of sexual desire, libido for sexual activity, or sexual fantasies for some time. The condition ranges from a general lack of sexual desire to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner. The condition may start after a period of normal sexual functioning, or the person may always have had an absence or a lesser intensity of sexual desire.

The causes vary considerably but include a decrease in the production of normal estrogen in women, or testosterone in both men and women. Other causes may be aging, fatigue, pregnancy, medications (such as SSRIs), or psychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety. While many causes of low sexual desire are cited, only a few of these have ever been the object of empirical research.

===Sexual arousal disorders===

Sexual arousal disorders were previously known as frigidity in women and impotence in men, though these have now been replaced with less judgmental terms. Impotence is now known as erectile dysfunction, and frigidity has been replaced with a number of terms describing specific problems that can be broken down into four categories as described by the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;: lack of desire, lack of arousal, pain during intercourse, and lack of orgasm.

For both men and women, these conditions can manifest themselves as an aversion to and avoidance of sexual contact with a partner. In men, there may be partial or complete failure to attain or maintain an erection, or a lack of sexual excitement and pleasure in sexual activity.

There may be physiological origins to these disorders, such as decreased blood flow or lack of vaginal lubrication. Chronic disease and the partners&#x27; relationship can also contribute to dysfunction.

Additionally, postorgasmic illness syndrome (POIS) may cause symptoms when aroused, including adrenergic-type presentation: rapid breathing, paresthesia, palpitations, headaches, aphasia, nausea, itchy eyes, fever, muscle pain and weakness, and fatigue.

From the onset of arousal, symptoms can persist for up to a week in patients.

The cause of this condition is unknown; however, it is believed to be a pathology of either the immune system or autonomic nervous systems. It is defined as a rare disease by the National Institute of Health, but the prevalence is unknown. It is not thought to be psychiatric in nature, but it may present as anxiety relating to coital activities and may be incorrectly diagnosed as such. There is no known cure or treatment.

====Erectile dysfunction====

Erectile dysfunction (ED), or impotence, is a sexual dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis. There are various underlying causes of ED, including damage to anatomical structures, psychological causes, medical disease, and drug use. Many of these causes are medically treatable.

Psychological ED can often be treated by almost anything that the patient believes in; there is a very strong placebo effect. Physical damage can be more difficult to treat. One leading physical cause of ED is continual or severe damage taken to the nervi erigentes, which can prevent or delay erection. These nerves course beside the prostate arising from the sacral plexus and can be damaged in prostatic and colorectal surgeries.

Diseases are also common causes of erectile dysfunction. Diseases such as cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, kidney failure, vascular disease, and spinal cord injury can cause erectile dysfunction. Cardiovascular disease can decrease blood flow to penile tissues, making it difficult to develop or maintain an erection.

Due to the shame and embarrassment felt by some with erectile dysfunction, the subject was taboo for a long time and is the focus of many urban legends. Folk remedies have long been advocated, with some being advertised widely since the 1930s. The introduction of perhaps the first pharmacologically effective remedy for impotence, sildenafil (trade name Viagra), in the 1990s caused a wave of public attention, propelled in part by the newsworthiness of stories about it and heavy advertising.

It is estimated that around 30 million men in the United States and 152 million men worldwide have erectile dysfunction. However, social stigma, low health literacy, and social taboos lead to under reporting which makes an accurate prevalence rate hard to determine.

The Latin term &quot;impotentia coeundi&quot; describes the inability to insert the penis into the vagina, and has been mostly replaced by more precise terms.

ED from vascular disease is seen mainly amongst older individuals who have atherosclerosis. Vascular disease is common in individuals who smoke or have diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or hypertension. Any time blood flow to the penis is impaired, ED can occur.

Drugs are also a cause of erectile dysfunction. Individuals who take drugs that lower blood pressure, antipsychotics, antidepressants, sedatives, narcotics, antacids, or alcohol can have problems with sexual function and loss of libido.

Hormone deficiency is a relatively rare cause of erectile dysfunction. In individuals with testicular failure, as in Klinefelter syndrome, or those who have had radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or childhood exposure to the mumps virus, the testes may fail to produce testosterone. Other hormonal causes of erectile failure include brain tumors, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or adrenal gland disorders.

===Orgasm disorders===

==== Anorgasmia ====

Anorgasmia is classified as persistent delays or absence of orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase in at least 75% of sexual encounters. The disorder can have physical, psychological, or pharmacological origins. SSRI antidepressants are a common pharmaceutical culprit, as they can delay orgasm or eliminate it entirely. A common physiological cause of anorgasmia is menopause; one in three women report problems obtaining an orgasm during sexual stimulation following menopause.

====Premature ejaculation====
Premature ejaculation is when ejaculation occurs before the partner achieves orgasm, or a mutually satisfactory length of time has passed during intercourse. There is no correct length of time for intercourse to last, but generally, premature ejaculation is thought to occur when ejaculation occurs in under two minutes from the time of the insertion of the penis. For a diagnosis, the patient must have a chronic history of premature ejaculation, poor ejaculatory control, and the problem must cause feelings of dissatisfaction as well as distress for the patient, the partner, or both.

Premature ejaculation has historically been attributed to psychological causes, but newer theories suggest that premature ejaculation may have an underlying neurobiological cause that may lead to rapid ejaculation.

====Post-orgasmic disorders====
Post-orgasmic disorders cause symptoms shortly after orgasm or ejaculation. Post-coital tristesse (PCT) is a feeling of melancholy and anxiety after sexual intercourse that lasts for up to two hours. Sexual headaches occur in the skull and neck during sexual activity, including masturbation, arousal or orgasm.

In men, post orgasmic illness syndrome (POIS) causes severe muscle pain throughout the body and other symptoms immediately following ejaculation. These symptoms last for up to a week. Some doctors speculate that the frequency of POIS &quot;in the population may be greater than has been reported in the academic literature&quot;, and that many with POIS are undiagnosed.

POIS may involve adrenergic symptoms: rapid breathing, paresthesia, palpitations, headaches, aphasia, nausea, itchy eyes, fever, muscle pain and weakness, and fatigue.

The etiology of this condition is unknown; however, it is believed to be a pathology of either the immune system or autonomic nervous systems. It is defined as a rare disease by the NIH, but the prevalence is unknown. It is not thought to be psychiatric in nature, but it may present as anxiety relating to coital activities and thus may be incorrectly diagnosed as such. There is no known cure or treatment.

Dhat syndrome is another condition which occurs in men: it is a culture-bound syndrome which causes anxious and dysphoric mood after sex. It is distinct from the low-mood and concentration problems (acute aphasia) seen in POIS.

===Sexual pain disorders===

Sexual pain disorders in women include dyspareunia (painful intercourse) and vaginismus (an involuntary spasm of the muscles of the vaginal wall that interferes with intercourse).

Dyspareunia may be caused by vaginal dryness. Poor lubrication may result from insufficient excitement and stimulation, or from hormonal changes caused by menopause, pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Irritation from contraceptive creams and foams can also cause dryness, as can fear and anxiety about sex.

It is unclear exactly what causes vaginismus, but it is thought that past sexual trauma (such as rape or abuse) may play a role. Another female sexual pain disorder is vulvodynia, or vulvar vestibulitis when localized to the vulval vestibule. In this condition, women experience burning pain during sex, which seems to be related to problems with the skin in the vulvar and vaginal areas. Its cause is unknown.

In men, structural abnormalities of the penis like Peyronie&#x27;s disease can make sexual intercourse difficult and/or painful. The disease is characterized by thick fibrous bands in the penis that lead to excessive curvature during erection. It has an incidence estimated at 0.4–3% or more, is most common in men 40–70, and has no certain cause. Risk factors include genetics, minor trauma (potentially during cystoscopy or transurethral resection of the prostate), chronic systemic vascular diseases, smoking, and alcohol consumption.

Priapism is a painful erection that occurs for several hours and occurs in the absence of sexual stimulation. This condition develops when blood is trapped in the penis and is unable to drain. If the condition is not promptly treated, it can lead to severe scarring and permanent loss of erectile function. The disorder is most common in young men and children. Individuals with sickle-cell disease and those who use certain medications can often develop this disorder.

== Causes ==
There are many factors which may result in a person experiencing a sexual dysfunction. These may result from emotional or physical causes. Emotional factors include interpersonal or psychological problems, which include depression, sexual fears or guilt, past sexual trauma, and sexual disorders.

Sexual dysfunction is especially common among people who have anxiety disorders. Ordinary anxiety can cause erectile dysfunction in men without psychiatric problems, but clinically diagnosable disorders such as panic disorder commonly cause avoidance of intercourse and premature ejaculation. Pain during intercourse is often a comorbidity of anxiety disorders among women.

Physical factors that can lead to sexual dysfunctions include the use of drugs, such as alcohol, nicotine, narcotics, stimulants, antihypertensives, antihistamines, and some psychotherapeutic drugs. For women, almost any physiological change that affects the reproductive system—premenstrual syndrome, pregnancy and the postpartum period, and menopause—can have an adverse effect on libido. Back injuries may also impact sexual activity, as can problems with an enlarged prostate gland, problems with blood supply, or nerve damage (as in sexual dysfunction after spinal cord injuries). Diseases such as diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, tumors, and, rarely, tertiary syphilis may also impact activity, as can the failure of various organ systems (such as the heart and lungs), endocrine disorders (thyroid, pituitary, or adrenal gland problems), hormonal deficiencies (low testosterone, other androgens, or estrogen), and some birth defects.

In the context of heterosexual relationships, one of the main reasons for the decline in sexual activity among these couples is the male partner experiencing erectile dysfunction. This can be very distressing for the male partner, causing poor body image, and it can also be a major source of low desire for these men. In aging women, it is natural for the vagina to narrow and atrophy. If a woman does not participate in sexual activity regularly (in particular, activities involving vaginal penetration), she will not be able to immediately accommodate a penis without risking pain or injury if she decides to engage in penetrative intercourse. This can turn into a vicious cycle that often leads to female sexual dysfunction.

According to Emily Wentzell, American culture has anti-aging sentiments that have caused sexual dysfunction to become &quot;an illness that needs treatment&quot; instead of viewing it as a natural part of the aging process. Not all cultures seek treatment; for example, a population of men living in Mexico often accept ED as a normal part of their maturing sexuality.

=== With SSRI medication ===

Sexual problems are common with SSRIs, which can cause anorgasmia, erectile dysfunction, diminished libido, genital numbness, and sexual anhedonia (pleasureless orgasm). Poor sexual function is also one of the most common reasons people stop the medication. In some cases, symptoms of sexual dysfunction may persist after discontinuation of SSRIs. This combination of symptoms is sometimes referred to as post-SSRI sexual dysfunction.

=== Pelvic floor dysfunction ===

Pelvic floor dysfunction can be an underlying cause of sexual dysfunction in both women and men, and is treatable by pelvic floor physical therapy, a type of physical therapy designed to restore the health and function of the pelvic floor and surrounding areas.

===Female sexual dysfunction===
Several theories have looked at female sexual dysfunction, from medical to psychological perspectives. Three social psychological theories include: the self-perception theory, the overjustification hypothesis, and the insufficient justification hypothesis:

*Self-perception theory: people make attributions about their own attitudes, feelings, and behaviours by relying on their observations of external behaviours and the circumstances in which those behaviours occur
*Overjustification hypothesis: when an external reward is given to a person for performing an intrinsically rewarding activity, the person&#x27;s intrinsic interest will decrease
*Insufficient justification: based on the classic cognitive dissonance theory (inconsistency between two cognitions or between a cognition and a behavior will create discomfort), this theory states that people will alter one of the cognitions or behaviours to restore consistency and reduce distress

The prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women is not well known due to a paucity of epidemiological studies, inconsistent criteria for sexual dysfunction across different studies and incomplete recruitment, with studies often excluding women who were without a partner or who were sexually inactive. However, based on incomplete population based studies from the United States, Europe and Australia, unspecified arousal dysfunction (in which a woman is unable to achieve desirable genital or non-genital sexual arousal despite adequate stimulation and desire) was present in 3-9% of women aged 18–44, 5-7.5% aged 45–64 and 3-6% in women older than 65. Anorgasmia with distress (in which women were unable to achieve an orgasm) was present in 7-8% of women younger than 40, 5-7% aged 40–64 and 3-6% of those older than 65. Poor sexual self image leading to distress was seen in 13.4% of women younger than 40 in an Australian population based study.

The importance of how a woman perceives her behavior should not be underestimated. Many women perceive sex as a chore as opposed to a pleasurable experience, and they tend to consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity. Several factors influence a women&#x27;s perception of her sexual life. These can include race, gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion. Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study found that African American women are the most optimistic about menopausal life; Caucasian women are the most anxious, Asian women are the most inhibited about their symptoms, and Hispanic women are the most stoic.

Since these women have sexual problems, their sexual lives with their partners can become a burden without pleasure, and may eventually lose complete interest in sexual activity. Some of the women found it hard to be aroused mentally, while others had physical problems. Several factors can affect female dysfunction, such as situations in which women do not trust their sex partners, the environment where sex occurs being uncomfortable, or an inability to concentrate on the sexual activity due to a bad mood or burdens from work. Other factors include physical discomfort or difficulty in achieving arousal, which could be caused by aging or changes in the body&#x27;s condition.

Sexual assault has been associated with excessive menstrual bleeding, genital burning, and painful intercourse (attributable to disease, injury, or otherwise), medically unexplained dysmenorrhea, menstrual irregularity, and lack of sexual pleasure. Physically violent assaults and those committed by strangers were most strongly related to reproductive symptoms. Multiple assaults, assaults accomplished by persuasion, spousal assault, and completed intercourse were most strongly related to sexual symptoms. Assault was occasionally associated more strongly with reproductive symptoms among women with lower income or less education, possibly because of economic stress or differences in assault circumstances. Associations with unexplained menstrual irregularity were strongest among African American women; ethnic differences in reported circumstances of assault appeared to account for these differences. Assault was associated with sexual indifference only among Latinas.

===Menopause===
The most prevalent of female sexual dysfunctions that have been linked to menopause include lack of desire and libido; these are predominantly associated with hormonal physiology. Specifically, the decline in serum estrogens causes these changes in sexual functioning. Androgen depletion may also play a role, but current knowledge about this is less clear. The hormonal changes that take place during the menopausal transition have been suggested to affect women&#x27;s sexual response through several mechanisms, some more conclusive than others.

===Aging in women===
Whether or not aging directly affects women&#x27;s sexual functioning during menopause is controversial. However, many studies have demonstrated that aging has a powerful impact on sexual function and dysfunction in women, specifically in the areas of desire, sexual interest, and frequency of orgasm. The primary predictor of sexual response throughout menopause is prior sexual functioning, which means that it is important to understand how the physiological changes in men and women can affect sexual desire. Despite the apparent negative impact that menopause can have on sexuality and sexual functioning, sexual confidence and well-being can improve with age and menopausal status.

Testosterone, along with its metabolite dihydrotestosterone, is important to normal sexual function in men and women. Dihydrotestosterone is the most prevalent androgen in both men and women. Testosterone levels in women at age 60 are on average about half of what they were before the women were 40. Although this decline is gradual for most women, those who have undergone bilateral oophorectomy experience a sudden drop in testosterone levels, as the ovaries produce 40% of the body&#x27;s circulating testosterone.

Sexual desire has been related to three separate components: drive, beliefs and values, and motivation. Particularly in postmenopausal women, drive fades and is no longer the initial step in a woman&#x27;s sexual response.

==Diagnosis==
===List of disorders===
====DSM====
The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders lists the following sexual dysfunctions:

* Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (see also asexuality, which is not classified as a disorder)
* Sexual aversion disorder (avoidance of or lack of desire for sexual intercourse)
* Female sexual arousal disorder (failure of normal lubricating arousal response)
* Male erectile disorder

==Treatment==

===Males===
Several decades ago, the medical community believed most sexual dysfunction cases were related to psychological issues. Although this may be true for a portion of men, the vast majority of cases have now been identified to have a physical cause or correlation. If the sexual dysfunction is deemed to have a psychological component or cause, psychotherapy can help. Situational anxiety arises from an earlier bad incident or lack of experience, and often leads to development of fear towards sexual activity and avoidance which enters a cycle of increased anxiety and desensitization of the penis. In some cases, erectile dysfunction may be due to marital disharmony. Marriage counseling sessions are recommended in this situation.

Lifestyle changes such as discontinuing tobacco smoking or substance use can also treat some types of ED. Several oral medications like Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra have become available to alleviate ED and have become first line therapy. These medications provide an easy, safe, and effective treatment solution for approximately 60% of men. In the rest, the medications may not work because of wrong diagnosis or chronic history.

Another type of medication that is effective in roughly 85% of men is called intracavernous pharmacotherapy, which involves injecting a vasodilator drug directly into the penis to stimulate an erection. This method has an increased risk of priapism if used in conjunction with other treatments, and localized pain.

Premature ejaculations are treated by behavioural techniques Squeeze technique and Stop Start Technique. In Squeeze technique the area between head and shaft of penis is pressed using index finger and thumb just before ejaculation. In Stop Start Technique the male partner stops having sexual intercourse just before ejaculation and waits for the sense of ejaculation to pass away. Both Techniques are repeated many times.

When conservative therapies fail, are an unsatisfactory treatment option, or are contraindicated for use, the insertion of a penile implant may be selected by the patient. Technological advances have made the insertion of a penile implant a safe option for the treatment of ED, which provides the highest patient and partner satisfaction rates of all available ED treatment options.

Pelvic floor physical therapy has been shown to be a valid treatment for men with sexual problems and pelvic pain.

The 2020 guidelines from the American College of Physicians support the discussion of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low levels of testosterone who have sexual dysfunction. They recommend yearly evaluation regarding possible improvement and, if none, to discontinue testosterone; intramuscular treatments should be considered rather than transdermal treatments due to costs and since the effectiveness and harm of either method is similar. Testosterone treatment for reasons other than possible improvement of sexual dysfunction may not be recommended.

===Females===
In 2015, flibanserin was approved in the US to treat decreased sexual desire in women. While it is effective for some women, it has been criticized for its limited efficacy, and has many warnings and contraindications that limit its use. Flibanserin was found to increase pleasurable sexual experiences by 0.5 events per month in trials. Possible side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, nausea and fatigue. Flibanserin should not be taken with alcohol. Bremelanotide has been shown to modestly increase sexual desire in women, but it has not shown evidence of increasing the number of satisfactory sexual experiences per month. Possible side effects include nausea, flushing and headaches. Women experiencing pain with intercourse are often prescribed pain relievers or desensitizing agents; others are prescribed vaginal lubricants. Many women with sexual dysfunction are also referred to a counselor or sex therapist. Counselling for female sexual dysfunction, including sexual counselling, cognitive behavioral therapy, body awareness counselling, and couples counselling have been found to be helpful.

Estrogen replacement therapy, outside of the indicated use for menopausal symptoms, is not recommended for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in women.

====Menopause====
Estrogens are responsible for the maintenance of collagen, elastic fibers, and vasculature of the urogenital tract, all of which are important in maintaining vaginal structure and functional integrity; they are also important for maintaining vaginal pH and moisture levels, both of which help to keep the tissues lubricated and protected. Prolonged estrogen deficiency leads to atrophy, fibrosis, and reduced blood flow to the urogenital tract, which cause menopausal symptoms such as vaginal dryness and pain related to sexual activity and/or intercourse. Women experiencing vaginal dryness who cannot use commercial lubricants may be able to use coconut oil as an alternative.

Androgen therapy for hypoactive sexual desire disorder has a small benefit but its safety is not known. It is not approved as a treatment in the United States. It is more commonly used among women who have had an oophorectomy or are in a postmenopausal state. However, like most treatments, this is also controversial. One study found that after a 24-week trial, women taking androgens had higher scores of sexual desire compared to a placebo group. As with all pharmacological drugs, there are side effects in using androgens, which include hirsutism, acne, polycythaemia, increased high-density lipoproteins, cardiovascular risks, and endometrial hyperplasia. Alternative treatments include topical estrogen creams and gels that can be applied to the vulva or vagina area to treat vaginal dryness and atrophy.

==Research==

In modern times, clinical study of sexual problems is usually dated back no earlier than 1970 when Masters and Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Human Sexual Inadequacy&quot; was published. It was the result of over a decade of work at the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation in St. Louis, involving 790 cases. The work grew from Masters and Johnson&#x27;s earlier &quot;Human Sexual Response&quot; (1966).

Prior to Masters and Johnson, the clinical approach to sexual problems was largely derived from Sigmund Freud. It was held to be psychopathology and approached with a certain pessimism regarding the chance of help or improvement. Sexual problems were merely symptoms of a deeper malaise, and the diagnostic approach was from the psychopathological viewpoint. There was little distinction between difficulties in function and variations nor between perversion and problems. Despite work by psychotherapists such as Balint sexual difficulties were crudely split into frigidity or impotence, terms which acquired negative connotations in popular culture.

&quot;Human Sexual Inadequacy&quot; moved thinking from psychopathology to learning; psychopathological problems would only be considered if a problem did not respond to educative treatment. Treatment was directed at couples, whereas before partners would be seen individually. Masters and Johnson believed that sex was a joint act, and that sexual communication was the key issue to sexual problems, not the specifics of an individual problem. They also proposed co-therapy, with a pair of therapists to match the clients, arguing that a lone male therapist could not fully comprehend female difficulties.

The basic Masters and Johnson treatment program was an intensive two-week program to develop efficient sexual communication. The program is couple-based and therapist-led, and began with discussion and sensate focus between the couple to develop shared experiences. From the experiences, specific difficulties could be determined and approached with a specific therapy. In a limited number of male-only cases (41) Masters and Johnson developed the use of a female surrogate, which was abandoned over the ethical, legal, and other problems it raised.

In defining the range of sexual problems, Masters and Johnson defined a boundary between dysfunction and deviations. Dysfunctions were transitory and experienced by most people, and included male primary or secondary impotence, premature ejaculation, and ejaculatory incompetence; female primary orgasmic dysfunction and situational orgasmic dysfunction; pain during intercourse (dyspareunia) and vaginismus. According to Masters and Johnson, sexual arousal and climax are a normal physiological process of every functionally intact adult, but they can be inhibited despite being autonomic responses. Masters and Johnson&#x27;s treatment program for dysfunction was 81.1% successful.

Despite Masters and Johnson&#x27;s work, sexual therapy in the US was overrun by enthusiastic rather than systematic approaches, blurring the space between &quot;enrichment&quot; and therapy.

<doc id="411853" wikidata="Q132071" url="?curid=411853" title="David Scott (Georgia politician)">
<text>David Albert Scott (born June 27, 1945) is an American politician and businessman who has served as the U.S. representative for since 2003. Scott&#x27;s district includes all of Rockdale County, as well as portions of Clayton, DeKalb, Gwinnett, Henry, and Newton counties. Before his election to Congress in 2002, Scott served as a Democratic member of both chambers of the Georgia Legislature and operated a small business. In 2023, he succeeded Glenn Thompson as ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee.

==Early life and education==
Scott was born in Aynor, South Carolina, and attended high school in Daytona Beach, Florida. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in finance from Florida A&amp;M University and a Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Scott is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

== Early career ==
In 1978, Scott founded Dayn-Mark Advertising (from the names of his two daughters, Dayna and Marcie), which places billboards and other forms of advertising in the Atlanta area. Scott&#x27;s wife, Alfredia, now heads the business. In May 2007, it was reported that the business owed more than $150,000 in back taxes and penalties. Scott&#x27;s campaigns paid the company more than $500,000 from 2002 to 2010, including expenses for office rent, printing, T-shirts, and other services. He has also paid his wife, two daughters, and son-in-law tens of thousands of dollars for campaign work such as fund raising and canvassing.

Scott served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1974 to 1982 and in the Georgia State Senate from 1982 to 2002.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
When Georgia picked up an additional district as a result of the 2000 census, Scott entered a five-way Democratic primary for the seat, winning with 53.8% of the vote. He then defeated Republican Clay Cox in the general election with 59% of the vote. He has never faced another contest that close, and has been reelected eight times, running unopposed in 2004, 2014 and 2016.

In 2007, the political watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Scott one of the 25 most corrupt members of Congress.

During his first two terms, Scott represented a district that twisted and wound its way through parts of nine counties and was barely contiguous in some areas. In a mid-decade redistricting held after the 2004 elections, the district was redrawn to be somewhat more compact, with its population centered in Clayton, Douglas and Fulton Counties. Redistricting after the 2010 census gave the district all of Douglas County and pushed it further into Clayton.

===Committee assignments===
For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Agriculture (Ranking Member)
**As Ranking Member of the Committee, Rep. Scott is entitled to sit as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member in all subcommittee meeting, per the committee rules.
* Committee on Financial Services
** Subcommittee on Capital Markets
** Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy

===Caucus memberships===
* Blue Dog Coalition (left in 2023)
* New Democrat Coalition
* Congressional Black Caucus
* U.S.-Japan Caucus
* Congressional Coalition on Adoption
* Rare Disease Caucus

==Political positions==
Scott was ranked as the 18th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the second most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Georgia) in the Bipartisan Index created by the Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy, which ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship by measuring how often each member&#x27;s bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member co-sponsors bills by members of the opposite party.

===Affordable Care Act===
Scott voted for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). On August 6, 2009, he was confronted by a constituent who was also a local doctor. The doctor, who later appeared in subsequent debates with his opposition candidate, asked Scott why he was going to vote for a health care plan similar to the plan implemented in Massachusetts and whether he supported a government-provided health care insurance option. Scott questioned whether the doctor was a resident of his district, although the local TV station WXIA-TV confirmed that the doctor did live and work in the district. Scott also said the doctor had not called Scott&#x27;s office to set up a meeting about health care; this was not verified.

===Fiscal policy===
Although Scott voted against the first version of the 2008 bailout, he backed the final version &quot;after being assured the legislation would aid homeowners facing foreclosures. Scott crafted an added provision dedicating $14 billion to aid those homeowners.&quot;

===Same-sex marriage===
Scott supported two failed pieces of legislation in 2004 and 2006 that aimed to establish a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. However, in May 2013 thinkprogress.org reported receiving an email from a spokesman of Scott saying, &quot;Congressman Scott fully supports marriage equality.&quot; The Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s profile of Scott also contains this sentence as his statement under &quot;position on marriage equality&quot;.

===Iran deal===
Scott has announced his opposition to the nuclear deal with Iran, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a good deal for Iran, for Russia, China and probably Hezbollah, but is it not, definitely not a good deal for Israel or for the United States or our allies – especially Jordan and Saudi Arabia&quot;.

=== Yemeni civil war ===
Scott was one of five House Democrats to vote for the U.S. to continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia and to support the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. This vote was cast the day after the Senate, on December 13, 2018, for the first time in the 45 years after the passage of the War Powers Resolution in 1973, came together and used congressional authority given by federal law to end military action.

==Personal life==

Scott&#x27;s brother-in-law was Baseball Hall of Fame member Hank Aaron.

Scott allegedly received death threats over his support of the Affordable Care Act. A swastika was found spray-painted on a sign outside his district office.

<doc id="411855" wikidata="Q469689" url="?curid=411855" title="Neil Abercrombie">
<text>Neil Abercrombie (born June 26, 1938) is an American politician who served as the seventh governor of Hawaii from 2010 to 2014. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Born in Buffalo, New York, Abercrombie is a graduate of Union College and the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. He began his political career in 1975, winning a seat in the Hawai&#x27;i House of Representatives. He served in the Hawai&#x27;i House until 1979, when he was elected to the Hawai&#x27;i State Senate. Upon the resignation of Cecil Heftel, who resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives to run for governor, Abercrombie was elected to his vacant seat in a special election in 1986, but lost the Democratic primary for a full term on the same day. Abercrombie served the remainder of Heftel&#x27;s term until January 1987. He served on the Honolulu City Council from 1988 to 1990 before returning to Congress in 1991. Abercrombie served nine consecutive terms in the House from 1993 to 2010, representing Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s 1st congressional district, consisting of urban Honolulu.

With incumbent Governor Linda Lingle prevented from running for reelection due to term limits, Abercrombie declared his candidacy for governor in March 2009. In September 2010 he won the five-candidate Democratic primary with 59% of the vote. Abercrombie went on to face Republican nominee, Lieutenant Governor Duke Aiona, in the general election. On November 2, 2010, Abercrombie and running mate Brian Schatz defeated Aiona with 57% of the vote. Abercrombie was sworn into office on December 6, 2010. In 2014, he was defeated in the Democratic primary by state senator David Ige, who went on to win the general election.

==Early life and education==
Abercrombie was born on June 26, 1938, in Buffalo, New York, the son of Vera June (née Grader) and George Donald Abercrombie. He has English, Irish and German ancestors. His paternal great-grandfather James Abercrombie left Ireland for Canada; his son then immigrated to the United States. After graduating from Williamsville High School (now Williamsville South High School), Abercrombie pursued studies in sociology at Union College in Schenectady, New York, where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1959 and was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. He arrived in Honolulu in September 1959 to study at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in sociology and later a doctorate in American Studies. At the university he befriended and attended classes with President Barack Obama&#x27;s parents, Ann Dunham and Barack Obama Sr.

To support himself as a graduate student, Abercrombie worked as a waiter at Chuck&#x27;s Steak House in Waikīkī, a locker desk clerk at the Central YMCA, a custodian at Mother Rice Preschool, a construction apprentice program director, an elementary school teacher, and a college lecturer.

==Political career==
Abercrombie first participated in a political campaign in 1970, seeking the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate. Unsuccessful, Abercrombie ran for the Hawai&#x27;i State House of Representatives, where he served from 1975 to 1979. A distinguishing symbol of his early campaigns was a yellow Checker Taxi with his name and face painted on the side, the use of which was motivated by lack of money for traditional campaigning methods. The taxi became a symbol of both his standing as an outsider from the mainland and his unconventional style. In 1979, Abercrombie was elected to the Hawai&#x27;i State Senate, where he served from 1980 to 1986. After U.S. Representative Cecil Heftel resigned in July 1986 to run for governor of Hawai&#x27;i, Abercrombie was elected to the House in a September 1986 special election to complete Heftel&#x27;s unexpired term. On the same day, he lost the Democratic primary for a full two-year term to Mufi Hannemann, who lost to Republican Pat Saiki in the general election.

Abercrombie then set his sights on a seat of the Honolulu City Council. He won the race and served from 1988 to 1990.

===U.S. Congress===
At the end of his council tenure in 1990, Abercrombie once again ran for Congress and won. He was reelected ten times. In the 2008 election, he won with 70.6% of the vote.

Abercrombie was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and compiled a generally liberal voting record. He supported and voted for the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act. On October 10, 2002, he was among the 133 members of the House who voted against authorizing the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He cosponsored H.R. 1312 (Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2005) on July 28, 2005. He took issue with the Vatican over not listing torture as a sin.

According to Project Vote Smart, Abercrombie holds the following issue positions: he is pro-choice, has voted against a ban on partial birth abortion, and has voted with the interests of NARAL and Planned Parenthood 100% of the time between 2000 and 2006. He has voted for bills designed to make it easier for Americans to vote, such as the motor voter bill. He has advocated strongly for civil liberties; his voting record is supported by both the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and American Library Association. He was one of the 67 representatives to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996 and has also voted against a constitutional amendment proposed in 2006 to limit marriage to being between one man and one woman. He was one of only nine representatives not to cast a vote for or against the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001. In 2005 he voted against the extension of the act, calling it &quot;a blank check to trample civil liberties.&quot; In 2007 he signed on as a co-sponsor of H.R. 676, which would have established a national health insurance program. He resigned from Congress on February 28, 2010, to concentrate on his campaign for governor.

Abercrombie served as chairman of the Armed Forces Subcommittee on Air and Land Forces and a senior member of the Natural Resources Committee. He co-authored landmark legislation creating public-private partnerships between the military and private developers to build, maintain and manage housing for military families.

===2010 gubernatorial campaign===

On March 9, 2009, Abercrombie announced his candidacy for governor of Hawai&#x27;i. On December 11, 2009, he announced that he would resign from Congress to concentrate on his gubernatorial bid. He was succeeded in Congress by Republican Charles Djou, the first Republican elected to Congress from Hawai&#x27;i since Pat Saiki.

During his campaign, Abercrombie released his &quot;A New Day in Hawai&#x27;i Plan,&quot; offering a roadmap based on Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s values and priorities. The plan was the result of conversations with thousands of people and many hours of research. Abercrombie met with business people, entrepreneurs, economists, principals, teachers, parents, academics, public employees, farmers, nonprofit leaders, health professionals, students, seniors, conservationists, cultural practitioners, construction workers, and citizens of all backgrounds. He also held dozens of issue forums and meetings on every island to hear from residents about their concerns and hopes for Hawai&#x27;i.

Abercrombie defeated his challenger, former Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann, in the 2010 Democratic gubernatorial primary election on September 18, 2010, 59.3% to 37.7%.

On November 2, 2010, Abercrombie defeated Republican nominee Duke Aiona, 57.8% to 40.8%, to become Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s 7th governor. In his November 3 victory speech, he credited many people for his success, including the founder of the Department of Religion at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, Dr. Mitsuo Aoki.

===Governor of Hawaii===

Abercrombie was sworn in as governor of Hawai&#x27;i on December 6, 2010, the first gubernatorial victor of the 2010 election cycle to be sworn into office.

Abercrombie was 72 when he was sworn in as governor, and was the oldest current United States governor for a little less than a month. On January 3, 2011, he lost that title to Jerry Brown of California, who is two months older than Abercrombie.

When Abercrombie took office, he vowed to end the investigations into President Obama&#x27;s birth certificate. A spokesperson for Abercrombie said he would ask the office of the Attorney General what it could do. State Attorney General David M. Louie informed Abercrombie that state privacy laws prevent the release of &quot;an individual&#x27;s birth documentation without the person&#x27;s consent&quot; to persons who do not have &quot;a tangible interest&quot; in the document.

According to polls, in October 2011, Abercrombie was the least popular governor in the country, with a 30% approval rating.

In February 2011, Abercrombie signed into law a bill legalizing civil unions. His predecessor, Linda Lingle, had vetoed the legislation. In 2013, he called the Hawai&#x27;i Legislature into a special session to consider a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, which he signed into law on November 13.

Upon the death of longtime Senator Daniel Inouye, Abercrombie had to appoint his replacement. The State Democratic Party gave him a list of three finalists and he chose Lieutenant Governor Brian Schatz, despite Inouye&#x27;s stated wish that he select Colleen Hanabusa. Schatz is now Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s senior U.S. Senator.

Obama appointed Abercrombie to the Council of Governors, and he served from 2012 to 2014. The council consists of 10 governors the president appoints to focus on national security, homeland defense, and synchronization and integration of state and federal military activities in the United States and matters of mutual interest pertaining to the National Guard.

In November 2013, Abercrombie was named to Obama&#x27;s Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience, a group of governors, mayors and other leaders who were to develop recommendations on how the federal government could better support local preparedness and resilience-building efforts. Hawai&#x27;i also signed on to the Majuro Declaration as a U.S. Climate Leader in September of that year, making the state the first sub-national government to sign.

After an intense special session, Abercrombie signed into law a bill that legalized marriage for same-sex couples in Hawai&#x27;i. The new law took effect on December 2, 2013. Hawaii was the 15th state to legalize same-sex marriage.

In the August 9, 2014, Democratic gubernatorial primary, Abercrombie was defeated by state senator David Ige, taking 31% of the vote to Ige&#x27;s 67%, making him the first incumbent governor to lose a primary in Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s history. The margin of defeat was the largest of any incumbent governor in U.S. history (though not the smallest share of the vote). Abercrombie had the support of President Barack Obama and had outspent Ige $4.9 million to $447,000 during the primary campaign. His confrontational style of governing, his proposal to raise taxes in the aftermath of the Great Recession, restructuring labor union pensions, and his selection of Brian Schatz over Colleen Hanabusa to fill the Senate seat vacated by Daniel Inouye&#x27;s death, which was considered disrespectful of Inouye&#x27;s wishes, were regarded as factors in Abercrombie&#x27;s loss. Nonetheless, Schatz, who was also endorsed by Obama, defeated Hanabusa in the 2014 Democratic Senate primary and went on to win the general election.

==Personal life==

In 1981, Abercrombie married Nancie Caraway, a political scientist and feminist writer at the University of Hawai&#x27;i at Mānoa&#x27;s Globalization Research Center. Abercrombie lives in the Mānoa Valley area of Honolulu.

Abercrombie is a powerlifter and has a stated goal of lifting 200 pounds more than his age on each birthday. On his 72nd birthday, he bench-pressed 272 pounds.

In 2006, Abercrombie was named &quot;Scot of the Year&quot; by the Caledonian Society of Hawai&#x27;i.

<doc id="411856" wikidata="Q1114305" url="?curid=411856" title="Haemophilus ducreyi">
<text>Haemophilus ducreyi are fastidious gram-negative coccobacilli bacteria.

This species causes the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, a major cause of genital ulceration in developing countries characterized by painful sores on the genitalia. The first study linking this disease with the agent &quot;Hemophilus ducreyi&quot; was published in 1889 by Auguste Ducrey. Each year in the United States, there are over 2,000 cases of chancroid. Chancroid starts as an erythematous papular lesion that breaks down into a painful bleeding ulcer with a necrotic base and ragged edge. It has also been found to cause chronic skin ulceration away from the genitalia, infect children and adults, and behave in a manner that mimics yaws.

&quot;H. ducreyi&quot; can be cultured on chocolate agar and incubated in an environment with elevated humidity and CO2 enrichment at 33° to 35 °C. It is best treated with a macrolide, e.g. azithromycin, and a third-generation cephalosporin, e.g. ceftriaxone.

==Morphology==
&quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot; is a Gram-negative coccobacillus, and has a shape between a spherical coccus and a rod-shaped bacterium. This species of bacterium has pili, fine and tangled appendages composed predominantly of protein, that allow bacteria to attach to surfaces, including those of cells.

== Colonies ==
Colonies of &quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot; are described as yellow-grey, small, and semiopaque as well as nonmucoid. Scanning electron microscopy has been used to observe that the microbe can form a colony of many cells; the cells adhere to each other because of an intercellular matrix. This bond can make it difficult to isolate a single cell of &quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot;, hindering the genetic studies that have been done on the microbe.

== Metabolism ==
&quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot; has been shown to have high phosphatase activity (acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and phosphoamidase). There are specific temperature and nutritional necessities for the pathogen to grow, requiring advanced laboratory equipment to study the bacteria. A saturated atmosphere with elevated CO2 levels is considered optimal for most strains, and the most favorable growth has been observed to occur under micro-aerophilic conditions achieved in a sealed anaerobic jar without a catalyst, using two envelopes that generate CO2 and H2, commonly referred to as &quot;Campylobacter&quot; growth conditions.

==Pathogenesis==
&quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot; is a human pathogen; and there are no known animal or environmental reservoirs.
&quot;H. ducreyi&quot; is an opportunistic microorganism that infects its host by way of breaks in the skin or epidermis. Inflammation then takes place as the area of infection is inundated with lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. This pyogenic inflammation causes regional lymphadenitis in the sexually transmitted disease chancroid.

== Toxins ==
&quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot; is able to defend itself against the immune response&#x27;s T cells through two toxins: a hemolysin and the cytolethal distending toxin (CDT). CDT is characterized by its ability to arrest epithelial cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and combats T cells by inducing apoptosis. Together, these toxins showcase the adeptness of &quot;H. ducreyi&quot; in manipulating host cell processes.

== Diagnosis ==
Although antigen detection, serology, and genetic amplification methods are sometimes used to diagnose infections with &quot;H. ducreyi&quot; and the genetic tests have greater sensitivity, they are not widely available, so cultures are currently considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; test, which has about 80% sensitivity under optimal combination of media.

==Treatment==
Single-dose antibiotic treatments using macrolides, third-generation cephalosporins, or fluoroquinolone continue to be effective in treating chancroid. The first line treatments recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are one of four options: azithromycin one gram orally in a single dose, ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly in a single dose, ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally two times a day for three days, or erythromycin base 500 mg orally three times a day for seven days. Some antibodies were specific to all strains, while others targeted only certain groups of strains &quot;H. ducreyi,&quot; indicating that the outer membrane proteins of &quot;H. ducreyi&quot; can vary in their immune recognition. Infected individuals are still susceptible to reinfection due to the absence of developed protective immunity.

A rise in antimicrobial resistance among &quot;H. ducreyi&quot; strains result in a shift away from benzylpenicillin as the preferred treatment.

<text>Edward Espenett Case (born September 27, 1952) is an American lawyer and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he has served as the U.S. representative for Hawaii&#x27;s 1st congressional district since 2019, which covers the urban core of Honolulu. He represented the 2nd district, which covers the rest of the state, from 2002 to 2007.

Case first came to prominence in Hawaii as majority leader of the Hawaii State Legislature and in his 2002 campaign for governor of Hawaii, when he was a Blue Dog Democrat. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2002 in a special election to fill the seat of Patsy Mink, who died of pneumonia, Case represented Hawaii&#x27;s 2nd congressional district until 2006, when he unsuccessfully challenged Daniel Akaka in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate.

In 2010, Case was one of two Democratic candidates in the special election for Hawaii&#x27;s 1st congressional district. With the Democratic vote split, Republican Councilman Charles Djou&#x27;s 39% of the vote earned him the seat. Case ran again in the Democratic primary for the November general election, but suspended his campaign in May. Colleen Hanabusa, Case&#x27;s fellow Democrat in the special election, won the primary and the general election against Djou. Case again ran for the Senate in 2012 after Akaka announced his retirement, but lost to Mazie Hirono.

In July 2013, Case announced that he was joining Outrigger Enterprises Group and that his political career was &quot;likely&quot; over. In June 2018, Case announced he would run again in Hawaii&#x27;s 1st congressional district. He won the crowded Democratic primary election in August and the general election. He took office in January 2019.

==Early life, education, and legal career==
Case was born in Hilo, the eldest of six children. In 1970, he graduated from Hawaii Preparatory Academy in Kamuela. After high school, Case traveled for a year in Australia, where he worked as a jackaroo on a New South Wales sheep station, and in New Zealand. He then attended Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology in 1975.

In 1981, Case graduated from the University of California Hastings College of Law in San Francisco with a Juris Doctor.

From 1981 to 1982, Case served as law clerk to Hawaii Supreme Court Chief Justice William S. Richardson. From 1983 to 2002, he worked at the law firm Carlsmith Ball in Honolulu, where he became a partner in 1989, and served as managing partner from 1992 to 1994, when he was first elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives. Case resigned his partnership upon winning election to the United States Congress in 2002. In 2007 he said he would work for the Honolulu-based law firm of Bays Deaver Lung Rose &amp; Baba.

==Early political career==
Case got his first taste of political life as a legislative assistant to Congressman and then Senator Spark Matsunaga from 1975 to 1978. In 1985, he won his first election, to the Mānoa Neighborhood Board of Honolulu. He became its chairman in 1987, a position he held until leaving the board in 1989.

==Hawaii House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1994, Case ran for Hawaii&#x27;s 23rd House district. He won the Democratic primary with 51% of the vote in a five-candidate field. In the general election, he defeated Green party nominee Toni Worst 59%–41%. In 1996, he was reelected with 67% of the vote. In 1998, he was reelected to a third term with 70% of the vote. In 2000, he was reelected to a fourth term unopposed.

===Tenure===
Case served four two-year terms in the Hawaii House of Representatives from 1994 to 2002, where he focused on basic change in Hawaii governance. In 1999, after he led an effort to replace the State House leadership, his Democratic peers elected him Majority Leader.

A conservative Democrat by Hawaii standards, Case sought to change the way state government operated and repeatedly warned that Hawaii was not addressing long-term fiscal challenges. On the last legislative day of 2000, he said in a floor speech: &quot;If you cannot make those choices, please get out of the way, because you are just making it harder for the rest of us.&quot;

On January 21, 1997, in the House Judiciary Committee, Case cast the lone vote against advancing HB117, which would allow a referendum to effectively constitutionally ban gay marriage. He and six others opposed the bill again in the full House vote. When he was up for reelection in November 1998, he publicly opposed the referendum because, he said, &quot;changing the Constitution would go against its intended purpose—protecting the rights of the minority against the will of the majority.&quot; Leading up to the November election, polls consistently predicted that the measure would pass by 70–75%, a prediction that was accurate. Due to the measure&#x27;s popularity, only three other politicians or candidates in Hawaii joined his position.

In 2001, Case co-sponsored an unsuccessful civil unions bill.

*House Judiciary Committee

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
====2002====
U.S. Representative Patsy Mink died on September 28, 2002, one week after the primary election, leaving her 107th Congress (2001–2003) seat vacant. She was posthumously reelected to the 108th Congress (2003–2005) in November. On November 30, 2002, Case was elected in a special election to serve the remaining two months of Mink&#x27;s term, gaining over 50% of the vote in a field of over 40, even though he did not live in the district. Members of the House are only constitutionally required to live in the state they represent, though convention calls for them to live in the district they represent. During the special election campaign, Case pointed out that he grew up on the Big Island.

====2003====
Case ran in a second special election on January 4, 2003, for Mink&#x27;s 108th Congress seat, facing more than three dozen other candidates. Other Democrats included Matt Matsunaga and Colleen Hanabusa. Republicans included Barbara Marumoto, Bob McDermott, and Frank Fasi. Case won with 43% of the vote.

====2004====
In 2004, Case defeated Republican challenger Mike Gabbard, a social conservative who focused almost exclusively on gay marriage issues. He won his first full term with 63% of the vote.

====2018====

In June 2018, Case ran in the crowded Democratic primary, set for August 11. He won with 40% of the vote, defeating six other challengers, including Doug Chin, the incumbent lieutenant governor. In the general election, Case carried Hawaii&#x27;s 1st congressional district by a 50-point margin, 73.1%—23.1%, defeating Republican Campbell Cavasso.

====2020====

He was reelected in 2020 with 72.02% of the vote, defeating Republican Ron Curtis.

===Tenure===
==== 2002–2007 ====
Case sponsored 36 bills between 2003 and 2006. Of those bills, Congress passed H.Con.Res.218 recognizing 100 years of Filipino-American immigration to America, the Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park Addition Act (H.R.546 / Public Law No. 108-142), legislation (H.R. 2030 / Public Law No: 108-5) designating the U.S. Postal Service facility in Paia, Hawaii, as the Patsy Takemoto Mink Post Office Building, and the Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act (H.R. 2619 / Public Law No. 108-481). Two of his other bills were included in subsequent legislation. H.R. 3535, to include country of origin labeling for macadamia nuts, was included in the 2008 Farm Bill. Hirono reintroduced the Kalaupapa Memorial Act (H.R. 4529), which she added to Public Law No. 111-11.

Case entered the House of Representatives too late to cast a vote on the Iraq War Resolution, but supported the Iraq War throughout his tenure in the House. As late as 2006, he opposed a firm timetable for withdrawal.

Case often sided with Republicans on major tax legislation. He was one of only 34 Democrats (who sided with 196 Republicans) to support reducing the estate tax. He also was one of 15 Democrats (who sided with 229 Republicans) to support lower taxes on investment income.

In 2005, Case voted for an amendment by Jeb Hensarling that would eliminate funding for PBS, NPR, and Title X family planning, including money for Planned Parenthood. He was the only Democrat to support the amendment, which failed 102–320.

Case also introduced the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Marine Refuge Act (H.R. 2376), which would have protected the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands by making them a national marine refuge. In June 2006, President George W. Bush achieved much of the bill&#x27;s goals by issuing a public proclamation creating the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument under the authority of the Antiquities Act of 1906.

Case co-sponsored 808 bills during the same period. He missed 148 (6%) of 2,435 votes in his tenure.

==== 2019–present ====
Case rejoined the Blue Dog Coalition on January 29, 2019.

On July 25, 2019, Case, Don Young, Brad Sherman and Ted Yoho founded the Congressional Pacific Islands Caucus in order to increase Congressional attention to the Indo-Pacific region. The caucus was also formed to encourage greater education for House members on the unique environmental, defense and economic issues of island nations and states in the Pacific Ocean.

On August 27, 2019, Case introduced H.R. 4547, the Safe and Quiet Skies Act. The bill would regulate tour airplane and helicopter flights and, among other things, set decibel limits over residential neighborhoods, prohibit overflights of military facilities, national parks, and residential areas by air tours and require a sterile cockpit. The introduction followed two fatal air tour helicopter crashes in Hawaii that killed 14 people.

On December 18, 2019, Case voted to impeach President Donald Trump.

In August 2021, Case joined a group of conservative Democrats, dubbed &quot;The Unbreakable Nine&quot;, who threatened to derail the Biden administration&#x27;s $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package meant to tackle the nation&#x27;s infrastructure.

As of 2022, Case has voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time, according to &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;. Case voted to provide Israel with support following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

On July 11, 2024, Case called for Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 United States presidential election.

== Other political campaigns ==
=== 2002 gubernatorial election ===
In early 2001, at the beginning of his fourth term in the Hawaii State House, Case chose not to continue as Majority Leader. In October 2001, he announced his candidacy for governor of Hawaii in 2002. Case&#x27;s initial opponent was the early favorite in the race, Mayor of Honolulu Jeremy Harris, also a Democrat. Case supporters were discontented with the &quot;Democratic Party of Hawaii machine&quot; that had ruled the state for 40 years and was perceived to have left the economy stagnant, a &quot;machine&quot; to which Harris was closely tied.

Despite high polling numbers, Harris abruptly dropped out of the race in May 2002 because of ongoing campaign spending investigations. Lieutenant Governor Mazie Hirono dropped out of her race for mayor of Honolulu to challenge Case in the primary. A later entrant into the Democratic primary was D. G. &quot;Andy&quot; Anderson, the former Republican state chair and aide to former Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi. Case told Hawaii voters that his campaign was one of government reform and the future, as opposed to Hirono and Anderson, who represented the &quot;Old Boys&#x27; Network&quot; and a status quo past.

In one of the closest primary elections for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Hawaii history, Hirono beat Case, 41% to 40%, with Anderson a distant third with 17%. In the general election, Hirono lost to Republican nominee Linda Lingle.

=== 2006 U.S. Senate election ===
Case challenged Senator Daniel Akaka in the Democratic primary election. He lost the September primary, 55-45%.

Akaka centered his campaign on the difference in support for the U.S. intervention in Iraq. He was one of only a handful of Democratic senators to vote against the use of force resolution against Iraq in 2002; Case, while not in Congress at the time of the vote, had said he would have voted in support of the resolution.

Despite his loss, Case decided to stay in politics.

=== 2010 special congressional election ===
On March 29, 2009, Case announced his candidacy for Hawaii&#x27;s 1st congressional district seat, being vacated by Neil Abercrombie. His main opponents were fellow Democrat Colleen Hanabusa and Republican Charles Djou. Case and Hanabusa represented different wings of the party, Case being a conservative Blue Dog Democrat, while Hanabusa was preferred by the progressive wing. Hanabusa was endorsed by EMILY&#x27;s List, the local party establishment, and local labor unions. Case was at odds with the party establishment over his primary challenge to Akaka in 2006 when he was still Representative of the 2nd district.

Case and Hanabusa each proposed that the other drop out for the sake of party unity. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) dispatched an aide to the state in the hopes of at least ensuring no other Democrats enter the race. It was unlikely either Democrat would drop out; they represented different views and had already faced off in a 2003 special election for Hawaii&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, which Case won. On May 10, 2010, the DCCC said it would not spend any further resources on the race, preferring to save those resources for the November election.

The election was held on May 22, 2010. Djou became the first Republican to win a Hawaii congressional election since 1988. He won with a plurality of 39% of the vote. Hanabusa came in second with 31% and Case came in third with 28% of the vote.

Case initially said he would run in the next primary against Hanabusa, but later changed his mind and dropped out of the race, citing party unity and his third-place finish.

=== 2012 U.S. Senate election ===

On April 10, 2011, Case announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate, to replace retiring U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka.

In a rematch of the 2002 gubernatorial primary, Hirono once again defeated him, this time by a 17-point margin, 58%–41%.

==Papers==
The Ed Case Papers were donated to the University of Hawaii at Manoa Library and are held in the Hawaii Congressional Papers Collection of the Library&#x27;s Archives &amp; Manuscripts Department. The Papers consist of materials from his years in Congress and the Hawaii legislature, as well as campaign material from his successful and unsuccessful campaigns. The papers were processed in 2007 by archivist Ellen Chapman, and will be opened for research on January 3, 2037.

==Personal life==

Case has two children from his first marriage from 1988 to 1998. In 2001, he married Audrey Nakamura, a former classmate from Hawaii Preparatory Academy, who is a flight attendant with United Airlines. He became reacquainted with her at their 30th class reunion. Nakamura also had two children from a previous marriage.

Case&#x27;s cousin, Steve Case, is the co-founder of America Online, as well as the former chairman of Time Warner.

Case is Protestant. Case has also received criticism for referring to himself as &quot;an Asian trapped in a white body&quot;.

<doc id="411859" wikidata="Q286701" url="?curid=411859" title="Hiromi Kawakami">
<text>is a Japanese writer known for her off-beat fiction, poetry, and literary criticism. She has won numerous Japanese literary awards, including the Akutagawa Prize, the Tanizaki Prize, the Yomiuri Prize, and the Izumi Kyōka Prize for Literature. Her work has been adapted for film, and has been translated into more than 15 languages.

==Early life and education==
Kawakami was born in Tokyo in 1958 and grew up in the Takaido neighborhood of Suginami City. She graduated from Ochanomizu Women&#x27;s College in 1980.

==Career==
After graduating from college Kawakami began writing and editing for &quot;NW-SF&quot;, a Japanese science fiction magazine. Her first short story, &quot;Sho-shimoku&quot; (&quot;Diptera&quot;), appeared in &quot;NW-SF&quot; in 1980.
She also taught science in a middle school and high school, but became a housewife when her husband had to relocate for work. 

In 1994, at the age of 36, Kawakami debuted as a writer of literary fiction with a collection of short stories entitled &quot;Kamisama&quot; (&quot;God&quot;). In 1996 &quot;Hebi wo fumi&quot; (&quot;Tread on a Snake&quot;) won the Akutagawa Prize, one of Japan&#x27;s most prestigious literary awards. It was later translated into English under the title &quot;Record of a Night Too Brief&quot;. She received the Tanizaki Prize in 2001 for her novel &quot;Sensei no kaban&quot; (&quot;The Briefcase&quot; or &quot;Strange Weather in Tokyo&quot;), a love story about a friendship and romance between a woman in her thirties and her former teacher, a man in his seventies. After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, Kawakami rewrote her debut short story &quot;Kamisama&quot; (&quot;God&quot;), keeping the original plot but incorporating the events of Fukushima into the story. 

In 2014 the film &quot;Nishino Yukihiko no Koi to Bōken&quot;, based on Kawakami&#x27;s 2003 novel of the same name and starring Yutaka Takenouchi and Machiko Ono, was released nationwide in Japan. That same year Kawakami&#x27;s novel was published by Bungeishunjū. &quot;Suisei&quot; won the 66th Yomiuri Prize in 2015, with selection committee member Yōko Ogawa praising the book for expanding the horizon of literature. In 2016 Kawakami&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, a collection of 14 short stories published by Kodansha, won the 44th Izumi Kyōka Prize for Literature.

==Writing style==
Kawakami&#x27;s work explores emotional ambiguity by describing the intimate details of everyday social interactions. Many of her stories incorporate elements of fantasy and magical realism. Her writing has drawn comparisons to Lewis Carroll and Banana Yoshimoto, and she has cited Gabriel García Márquez and J. G. Ballard as influences. Many of her short stories, novel extracts, and essays have been translated into English, including &quot;God Bless You&quot; (&quot;Kamisama&quot;), &quot;The Moon and the Batteries&quot; (extract from &quot;Sensei no kaban&quot;), &quot;Mogera Wogura&quot;, &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, &quot;The Ten Loves of Nishino&quot;, and &quot;People in My Neighborhood.&quot;

<doc id="411860" wikidata="Q39593" url="?curid=411860" title="Butch Otter">
<text>Clement Leroy &quot;Butch&quot; Otter (born May 3, 1942) is an American businessman and politician who served as the 32nd governor of Idaho from 2007 to 2019. A member of the Republican Party, he was elected in 2006, and reelected in 2010 and 2014. Otter served as lieutenant governor from 1987 to 2001 and in U.S. Congress from the first district from 2001 to 2007.

==Early life, education and business career (1942–1972)==
Born in Caldwell, Idaho into a small Roman Catholic family of limited means, his parents were Regina Mary ( Buser) and Joseph Bernard Otter. His father was a journeyman electrician, and the family lived in many rural locations in the Midwest and West during his youth, attending fifteen different schools.

His nickname &quot;Butch&quot; was the result of a few schoolyard fights which resulted in minor bruises; Catholic nuns had initially nicknamed him &quot;Clem&quot; after a character in the Red Skelton Show. He graduated from St. Teresa&#x27;s Academy (predecessor of Bishop Kelly High School) in Boise in 1962. Otter graduated from high school at age twenty – a childhood accident involving gasoline severely burned his younger brother and forced Otter to take a year off. He worked throughout high school as a janitor, theater usher, and lawn boy.

Otter briefly attended St. Martin&#x27;s College in Lacey, Washington, returned to Idaho and attended Boise Junior College, then earned his B.A. in political science from the College of Idaho in 1967. He was the only member of his family to graduate from college, and made the dean&#x27;s list in his last term. He served in the Idaho Army National Guard&#x27;s 116th Armored Cavalry from 1968 to 1973.

Otter&#x27;s business experience includes thirty years with Simplot International, an agribusiness corporation founded by his then father-in-law, J.R. Simplot. He started at a low-level position and eventually was appointed to the company&#x27;s presidency.

==Early political career (1972–1986)==
===Idaho legislature===
His first bid for elective office was in 1972; he won a seat in the state legislature from Canyon County, and was re-elected to the House in 1974 serving until 1976.

===1978 gubernatorial election===

In January 1977, incumbent Democratic Governor Cecil Andrus was appointed U.S. Secretary of Interior under President Jimmy Carter. Lieutenant governor John Evans, a Democrat, succeeded Andrus and Otter announced in June his intention to run for governor in 1978. In the six-man Republican primary in August, Otter ranked a close third with 26.0% of the vote. Allan Larsen, the House Speaker from Blackfoot, won the nomination with 28.7% of the vote, followed by Vern Ravenscroft of Tuttle, 

The nominees of both parties were Mormon, marking the first time in state history one would be elected governor. Incumbent Evans was unopposed in the Democratic primary and won the general election in November with nearly sixty percent of the vote; it was the third of six consecutive victories by Democrats.

===State politics===
After losing the gubernatorial primary, he was on the Idaho Republican Party Central Committee and was Chairman of the Canyon County Republican Party.

===Reagan administration===
After Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, he appointed Otter to the administration&#x27;s Task Force on International Private Enterprise, the World Bank&#x27;s Agricultural Advisory Committee, and the Center for International Private Enterprise.

==Lieutenant governor (1987–2001)==
In 1986, Otter returned to Idaho politics and was elected lieutenant governor, and reelected in 1990, 1994, and 1998. He served under three different governors, Democrat Cecil Andrus, and Republicans Phil Batt and Dirk Kempthorne. In 1991, when the Idaho Senate was evenly divided between 21 Republicans and 21 Democrats, Otter&#x27;s tie-breaking votes kept the body under GOP control. Midway through his fourth term in 2001 (14 years), Otter resigned to take his congressional seat in Washington, D.C.; he is the longest-serving lieutenant governor in Idaho history.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2001–2007)==

===Elections===
Congresswoman Helen Chenoweth-Hage of the First District had promised to serve only three terms in the House when first elected in the Republican wave of 1994, and kept that pledge in 2000 even after calling term limits bad policy.

Otter entered the Republican primary, and immediately became the favorite due to his name recognition as lieutenant governor. He won handily, and breezed to victory in November, and was re-elected in 2002 and 2004.

===Tenure===
In Congress, Otter was largely conservative with a slight libertarian streak, as reflected in his opposition to the Patriot Act. He was one of three Republicans (along with Bob Ney of Ohio and Ron Paul of Texas) to vote against the Act in 2001.

He since stated that &quot;much of the USA PATRIOT Act is needed to help protect us in a dangerous age of stateless zealots and mindless violence&quot;. Otter was also very critical of the Bush Administration&#x27;s Terrorist Surveillance Program concerning communications to those outside the United States. He served as a deputy majority whip for most of his time in Congress.

====LGBT rights====
He supports a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between &quot;one man and one woman.&quot;

====Gun laws====
He has been a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights and opposes federal restrictions on gun sales.

====Economy====
On economic issues, he has voted for a 2001 bankruptcy overhaul requiring partial debt repayment. He supports a balanced budget amendment to the US Constitution and supports broad-based tax cuts including eliminating the estate and marriage taxes. He has supported expanding free-trade agreements with nations such as Singapore and Chile.

====Health care====
He has voted for medical malpractice and tort reform. He has voted to allow importation of prescription drugs and has supported small business associations to reduce health insurance costs via collaborative efforts.

====Foreign policy====
Otter voted to authorize the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

===Committee assignments===
*U.S. House Committee on Resources
*U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
*U.S. House Committee on Government Reform
*U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce

==Governor of Idaho (2007–2019)==
===2006 election===

In December 2005, Otter announced his candidacy for the gubernatorial seat in 2006. Otter won the May Republican primary with 70% of the vote, defeating three opponents

In the general election, he faced Democrat Jerry Brady in the November 7 general election. Brady, the former publisher of &quot;The Post Register&quot; in Idaho Falls, had run for governor in 2002, losing to incumbent Republican Governor Dirk Kempthorne. Otter was initially considered an overwhelming favorite, given his popularity and Idaho&#x27;s strong Republican lean. However, the race was far closer than expected in the last weeks of the campaign. A poll conducted for the &quot;Idaho Statesman&quot; and Boise ABC affiliate KIVI showed Otter ahead of Brady by only a single point– a statistical dead heat. According to the &quot;Statesman,&quot; it was the first time in over a decade that the governor&#x27;s race has not already been decided 10 days prior to the election.

State Republican Party chairman Kirk Sullivan told the paper that the race appeared to be closer than normal because of a strong national trend against the Republicans. Otter pulled away in the final week, and won the election 53%–44%, the closest gubernatorial race since 1994.

===First term===
Otter has recommended an increase in Idaho state educational funding by $1.36 billion as well as expanding needs-based scholarships for college-bound students. Otter supports expanding offshore oil drilling and supports tax incentives for development of alternative fuels. He has stated that the US should set a goal of 25% renewable energy by 2025.

On January 11, 2007, Otter announced his support for a &quot;gray wolf kill,&quot; in which all but 100 of Idaho&#x27;s recently recovered population would be eradicated, pending the forthcoming U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removal of the wolves&#x27; federal protections under the Endangered Species Act. Otter even remarked that he would be first in line to purchase a tag to kill one of the animals. This position drew criticism from many Western environmental and animal advocate groups, including Priscilla Feral, president of Friends of Animals who called for a boycott of potatoes from Idaho.

In the summer of 2007, actress Dawn Wells, the original Mary Ann from Gilligan&#x27;s Island, presented Governor Butch Otter with the Idaho Visionary Award for work he had done supporting Idaho filmmakers at the SpudFest Family Film and Music Festival that she founded in Driggs, Idaho.

===2010 election===

In the Republican primary, he had five opponents file against him. He won re-nomination with just 55% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated Democratic nominee Keith Allred by 118,803 votes

===Second term===
He was sworn into his second term on January 7, 2011. In the first State of the State in his second term, he proposed the elimination of teacher tenure, becoming one of the most aggressive governors in the country when it comes to education reform. The &quot;Stateline&quot; explained that the &quot;Idaho plan is perhaps the most far-reaching effort to use teachers&#x27; rights and performance as part of a bid to revamp a state&#x27;s entire educational process.&quot; Critics say that roughly 770 teaching positions would be eliminated and teacher contracts would have to be renegotiated every year, in which bargaining would cover only pay and benefits. In March 2011, Otter signed two bills into law, one limits the ability of teachers to collectively bargain and eliminates tenure for new teachers. The other allows school districts to pay teachers based on their performance. The &quot;Luna laws&quot; (named after the state&#x27;s superintendent of education) were later overturned in three state referendums in 2012.

In April 2011, Otter issued an executive order prohibiting Idaho state agencies from implementing the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

In 2013, the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) confirmed that an internal review showed the corporation had falsified records involving about 4,800 employee hours over a period of seven months, at its Idaho State Correctional Center. In 2014, a subsequent KPMG audit showed the actual overbilling was for over 26,000 hours. Otter ordered Idaho State Police to investigate to see if criminal charges should be brought. Otter had received a total of $20,000 in campaign contributions from employees of the company since 2003. In March, the state announced that the FBI was taking over the investigation, as well as investigating CCA operations in other states. In January 2014, Otter announced that the state would take back the operations of the prison.

In May 2016, CCA, which had by then changed its name to CoreCivic, was found in contempt of court for having failed to comply with a court order regarding the Idaho State Correctional Institution. In an apparent attempt to increase profits, the company had been assigning too few staff to the prison and it submitted false staffing reports in order to appear to be in compliance.

In March 2014 Otter established the &quot;Wolf Control Fund and State Board&quot; which continues his policy of exterminating wolves in Idaho.

===2014 election===

In November 2014, Otter was elected to a third consecutive term as governor.

===Third term===
Senate Bill 1146a, which would have legalized CBD oil for persons with severe epilepsy, passed the Idaho Legislature following &quot;lengthy and emotional&quot; hearings, but was vetoed by Otter in April 2015.

In his veto, Otter stated:

For the United States presidential election in 2016 Otter endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.

In May 2016, CCA, which had changed its name to CoreCivic, was found in contempt of court for having failed to comply with a court order regarding the Idaho State Correctional Institution. In an apparent attempt to increase profits, the company had been assigning too few staff to the prison. They submitted false staffing reports to appear to be in compliance.

In July 2017, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton led a group of Republican Attorneys General from nine other states, and also including Otter, in threatening the Donald Trump administration that they would litigate if the president did not terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy that had been put into place by president Barack Obama.

On January 5, 2019, the State Central Committee of the Idaho Republican Party passed a resolution condemning and censuring Otter ultimately over endorsing an independent candidate over a candidate nominated in the previous May primary.

==Personal life==

In 1964, Otter married Gay Simplot (b. 1945), the sister of Scott Simplot and only daughter of J. R. Simplot. After 28 years of marriage, the couple amicably divorced in 1992. The marriage was later annulled by the Catholic Church.

In 2006, Otter married his longtime girlfriend Lori Easley (born 1967), a former Miss Idaho USA, in Meridian on August 18.

===Drunk driving arrest===
In August 1992, Otter was pulled over on Interstate 84 near Meridian for suspicion of driving under the influence. He said the arresting officer observed him swerving as he was reaching for his cowboy hat, which had been blown off by the wind in his open car. Otter offered several explanations for failing the field sobriety test including: his stocking feet were stung by weeds and gravel, he had run eight miles (13 km) and his knee hurt, he was hungry, and that he had soaked his chewing tobacco in Jack Daniel&#x27;s. A jury convicted Otter in March 1993, and he was sentenced to 72 hours of community service and 16 hours at an alcohol treatment program, fined $700, and had his license revoked.

He publicly admitted the incident could have ended his political career; it likely forced him to abandon an anticipated run for governor in 1994 and instead seek re-election for lieutenant governor. Phil Batt won the gubernatorial election for the first Republican victory in 28 years.

===Tenure===
While the Republican Party held the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Simpson often served as the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House, particularly during debates on controversial legislation, due to his command of House procedure. Simpson is known to have broken several sounding boards with the gavel while calling the House to order. This inspired him to have a number of sounding boards produced in Idaho, which he presented to then Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert as a joke. When the Republican Party regained control of the House of Representatives in 2010, Simpson began once again to serve frequently as Speaker Pro Tempore.

In the 111th United States Congress Simpson became the Ranking Member on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. He also serves as the small state representative on the 33-member House Republican Steering Committee. Known as the &quot;committee of committees&quot;, the Steering Committee decides which Republican lawmakers become ranking members on House committees. Simpson replaced Don Young on the committee.

In December 2020, Simpson signed an amicus brief in support of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton&#x27;s lawsuit seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

====Larry Craig scandal====
On June 11, 2007, U.S. Senator Larry Craig was arrested for indecent behavior in a men&#x27;s restroom at Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport; he pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct in August 2007 and paid $575 in court fines and fees. Simpson was openly considered for an appointment to the Senate if Craig resigned. But Simpson asked Governor Butch Otter to remove his name from consideration, claiming that the Idaho Congressional Delegation would be in a better position if he were to remain in the House and retain his seniority on the House Appropriations Committee.

Simpson criticized Senate leadership treatment of Craig. He said: &quot;If that&#x27;s how they treat their own, that tells me they&#x27;re more interested in party than individuals, and the party is made up of individuals. How you treat them says a lot about your party.&quot; Simpson demanded that Craig be treated fairly, saying &quot;They have people over there [in the Senate Republican Conference] in far worse trouble that they haven&#x27;t said a thing about.&quot; 

====2013 government shutdown====
In October 2013, Simpson voted to end the United States federal government shutdown of 2013.

==== Health care ====
Affordable Care Act repeal 
Simpson voted for and presided over the vote on the American Health Care Act of 2017, which passed the House on May 4, 2017.

Newborn health
Simpson was an original co-sponsor of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1281; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize grant programs and other initiatives to promote expanded screening of newborns and children for heritable disorders. Simpson said: &quot;the bill reflects the realities of reduced budgets Washington, but continues and strengthens the well established system of monitoring and evaluating infant conditions soon after birth. Just one small blood sample from the newborn&#x27;s foot identifies infants with genetic or other conditions that can be treated quickly and effectively, saving and improving thousands of lives.&quot;

==== Energy and water ====
On June 20, 2014, Simpson introduced the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4923; 113th Congress), a bill that would make appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for FY2015. The bill would appropriate $34 billion, which is $50 million less than these agencies then received. The appropriations for the United States Department of Energy and the United States Army Corps of Engineers are made by this bill.

====Gun rights====
Simpson was one of the members of Congress to sign the D.C. v. Heller amicus brief which supported a recognition of the Second Amendment as an individual right.

====Idaho-focused environmental legislation====
Simpson&#x27;s hallmark legislation is the Central Idaho Economic Development and Recreation Act (CIEDRA), which would create 312,000 acres of wilderness in central Idaho, much of which is currently a wilderness study area. He has faced substantial resistance from groups like the Sierra Club, which claim the bill lacks &quot;wilderness values&quot; because it allows for motorized access to certain parts of the wilderness area and some federal land would be transferred to the State of Idaho to promote the economic development of the local community and the recreational use of National Forest land and other public lands in central Idaho. Simpson has also faced opposition from groups that oppose new federal land designations, and wilderness designations particularly, because of restricted access to wilderness areas. In August 2015, a revised version of CIEDRA, the Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Jerry Peak Wilderness Additions Act, passed Congress and was signed by President Obama, creating the Hemingway–Boulders, Jim McClure–Jerry Peak, and White Clouds wilderness areas, which cover a total of of central Idaho.

On March 21, 2014, Simpson introduced the bill To amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to maintain or replace certain facilities and structures for commercial recreation services at Smith Gulch in Idaho (H.R. 4283; 113th Congress). The bill would require the United States Secretary of Agriculture to permit private entities to repair or replace certain commercial facilities on United States Forest Service land in Idaho. Simpson said, &quot;this legislation clarifies Congress&#x27;s intent of the 2004 amendments to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act which continued the existing use and occupancy of commercial services in this corridor of the Salmon River&quot;. The legislation passed the House, but stalled in the Senate.

In February 2021, Simpson announced a &quot;Salmon and Energy&quot; concept intended to restore Snake River salmon while protecting agricultural and energy interests across the Columbia River basin.

====Judgeship reorganization====

Simpson has pushed to divide the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sponsoring bills to that effect in 2007, 2011, 2017, and 2021. None of these bills were successful.

====Dentistry====
A dentist himself, Simpson has worked closely with the American Dental Association on issues over the years. This has included co-sponsoring an unsuccessful 2009 bill intended to counter &quot;methmouth&quot; and pushing for better reimbursements and coverage for dental care.

====Tax reform====
Simpson voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. After passing the bill, he said he spoke to Idaho farmers, ranchers and businesses who called for a simplified tax code and reform. He said the bill would &quot;create economic growth in the United States by unleashing American small businesses and unburdening middle-class families so they can make better financial decisions with their own money.&quot;

====2020 election====
In December 2020, Simpson was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

In January 2021, Simpson voted to certify both Arizona&#x27;s and Pennsylvania&#x27;s results in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.

On May 19, 2021, Simpson was one of 35 Republicans to join all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the attack of the U.S. Capitol.

====Immigration====
In 2021, Simpson voted for the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021, which passes work visas for illegal immigrant farm workers.

Simpson voted for the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, which authorized DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.

Simpson voted for the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), which effectively prohibits Immigration and Customs Enforcement from cooperating with the Department of Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of Unaccompanied Alien Children.

Simpson supports Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).

====LGBT rights====
In 2021, Simpson was among the House Republicans to sponsor the Fairness for All Act, the Republican alternative to the Equality Act. The bill would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, and protect the free exercise of religion.

In 2021, Simpson was one of 29 Republicans to vote to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. This bill expanded legal protections for transgender people and contained provisions allowing transgender women to use women&#x27;s shelters and serve time in prisons matching their gender identity.

In 2022, Simpson was one of 47 House Republicans to vote with the Democratic Party for the Respect for Marriage Act, repealing the Defense of Marriage Act. He later voted for the final form of the bill as passed in the Senate in December.

== Political positions ==
Simpson is a Republican who is known to take moderate stances. For example, he has supported the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, voting each year against Republican amendments to strip them of funding. In the past he has opposed earmarks.

&quot;Esquire&quot; listed Simpson as one of the 10 Best Members of Congress in October 2008. The magazine wrote, &quot;More than any other representative, Simpson lives by the philosophy that democratic representation is a matter of finding not advantageous positions but common ground&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s portrayal of Simpson echoes one of his personal philosophies, which is embodied in Henry Clay&#x27;s words: &quot;Politics is not about ideological purity or moral self-righteousness. It is about governing, and if a politician cannot compromise he cannot govern effectively.&quot; This quotation is framed and hangs in Simpson&#x27;s Washington D.C. office. Simpson played a key role in the election of John Boehner as House Majority Leader in the 109th United States Congress.

=== Idaho federal judgeships ===
In 2010, Simpson joined congressman Walt Minnick in his effort to secure a third federal judge for Idaho. Simpson said, &quot;The caseload of the Idaho District Court has increased significantly in recent decades resulting in Idaho&#x27;s district judges carrying a disproportionate share of cases in relation to their colleagues in other states.&quot;

As of May 2024, Idaho still has two federal judgeships.

=== Health care ===
Simpson has committed to repealing the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), questioning its constitutionality and effectiveness. He was close and loyal to Speaker John Boehner.

=== Tax reform ===
Simpson supports tax reform. When asked about the Grover Norquist pledge to oppose any net increase in taxes, Simpson said, &quot;Well, first, the pledge: I signed that in 1998 when I first ran. I didn&#x27;t know I was signing a marriage agreement that would last forever.&quot;

=== Climate change ===
In a 2019 conference in Boise, Simpson said: &quot;climate change is a reality. It’s not hard to figure out. Go look at your thermometer.&quot; In his speech, he tied climate change to the viability of salmon in Idaho lakes and rivers.

=== Energy ===
Simpson is also known as an outspoken proponent of nuclear power, extolling its virtues as an environmentally friendly source of energy with minimal carbon output. His support for nuclear energy plays a significant role in his membership of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, which oversees the Idaho National Laboratory, a main site for nuclear and alternative energy research in the United States.

=== Ukraine ===
In 2022, Simpson voted to provide approximately $14 billion to the government of Ukraine.

=== Social issues ===
Simpson supports efforts to make it illegal to desecrate the American flag.

=== Abortion ===
Simpson is anti-abortion. He has a zero rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America and a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee for his voting record on abortion. He opposes using federal monies to fund abortions, embryonic stem cell research, restricting the transport of minors over state lines to receive abortions, partial-birth abortions except to save a mother&#x27;s life and human cloning. He supports cutting federal funding of Planned Parenthood.

=== Cannabis ===
Simpson opposes veterans having access to medical marijuana if recommended by their Veterans Health Administration doctor and if it is legal for medicinal purposes in their state of residence.

=== Big Tech ===
In 2022, Simpson was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2021, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.

<text>Dysmenorrhea, also known as period pain, painful periods or menstrual cramps, is pain during menstruation. Its usual onset occurs around the time that menstruation begins. Symptoms typically last less than three days. The pain is usually in the pelvis or lower abdomen. Other symptoms may include back pain, diarrhea or nausea.
Dysmenorrhea can occur without an underlying problem. Underlying issues that can cause dysmenorrhea include uterine fibroids, adenomyosis, and most commonly, endometriosis. It is more common among those with heavy periods, irregular periods, those whose periods started before twelve years of age and those who have a low body weight. A pelvic exam and ultrasound in individuals who are sexually active may be useful for diagnosis. Conditions that should be ruled out include ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, interstitial cystitis and chronic pelvic pain.
Dysmenorrhea occurs less often in those who exercise regularly and those who have children early in life. Treatment may include the use of a heating pad. Medications that may help include NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, hormonal birth control and the IUD with progestogen. Taking vitamin B1 or magnesium may help. Evidence for yoga, acupuncture and massage is insufficient. Surgery may be useful if certain underlying problems are present.
Estimates of the percentage of female adolescents and women of reproductive age affected are between 50% and 90%. It is the most common menstrual disorder. Typically, it starts within a year of the first menstrual period. When there is no underlying cause, often the pain improves with age or following having a child.
== Signs and symptoms ==

The main symptom of dysmenorrhea is pain concentrated in the lower abdomen or pelvis. It is also commonly felt in the right or left side of the abdomen. It may radiate to the thighs and lower back.

Symptoms often co-occurring with menstrual pain include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, disorientation, fainting and fatigue. Symptoms of dysmenorrhea often begin immediately after ovulation and can last until the end of menstruation. This is because dysmenorrhea is often associated with changes in hormonal levels in the body that occur with ovulation. In particular, prostaglandins induce abdominal contractions that can cause pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. The use of certain types of birth control pills can prevent the symptoms of dysmenorrhea because they stop ovulation from occurring.

Dysmenorrhea is associated with increased pain sensitivity and heavy menstrual bleeding.

For many, primary dysmenorrhea symptoms gradually subside after their mid-20s. Pregnancy has also been demonstrated to lessen the severity of dysmenorrhea, when menstruation resumes. However, dysmenorrhea can continue until menopause. 5–15% of women with dysmenorrhea experience symptoms severe enough to interfere with daily activities.

==Causes==
There are two types of dysmenorrhea, primary and secondary, based on the absence or presence of an underlying cause. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs without an associated underlying condition, while secondary dysmenorrhea has a specific underlying cause, typically a condition that affects the uterus or other reproductive organs.

Painful menstrual cramps can result from an excess of prostaglandins released from the uterus. Prostaglandins cause the uterine muscles to tighten and relax causing the menstrual cramps. This type of dysmenorrhea is called &quot;primary dysmenorrhea&quot;. Primary dysmenorrhea usually begins in the teens soon after the first period.

&quot;Secondary dysmenorrhea&quot; is the type of dysmenorrhea caused by another condition such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, uterine adenomyosis, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Rarely, birth defects, intrauterine devices, certain cancers, and pelvic infections cause secondary dysmenorrhea. If the pain occurs between menstrual periods, lasts longer than the first few days of the period, or is not adequately relieved by the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or hormonal contraceptives, this could indicate another condition causing secondary dysmenorrhea.

&quot;Membranous dysmenorrhea&quot; is a type of secondary dysmenorrhea in which the entire lining of the uterus is shed all at once rather than over the course of several days as is typical. Signs and symptoms include spotting, bleeding, abdominal pain, and menstrual cramps. The resulting uterine tissue is called a decidual cast and must be passed through the cervix and vagina. It typically takes the shape of the uterus itself. Membranous dysmenorrhea is extremely rare and there are very few reported cases. The underlying cause is unknown, though some evidence suggests it may be associated with ectopic pregnancy or the use of hormonal contraception.

When laparoscopy is used for diagnosis, the most common cause of dysmenorrhea is endometriosis, in approximately 70% of adolescents.

Other causes of secondary dysmenorrhea include leiomyoma, adenomyosis, ovarian cysts, pelvic congestion, and cavitated and accessory uterine mass.

==Risk factors==
Genetic factors, stress and depression are risk factors for dysmenorrhea. Risk factors for primary dysmenorrhea include: early age at menarche, long or heavy menstrual periods, smoking, and a family history of dysmenorrhea.

Dysmenorrhea is a highly polygenic and heritable condition. There is strong evidence of familial predisposition and genetic factors increasing susceptibility to dysmenorrhea. There have been multiple polymorphisms and genetic variants in both metabolic genes and genes responsible for immunity which have been associated with the disorder.

Three distinct possible phenotypes have been identified for dysmenorrhea which include &quot;multiple severe symptoms&quot;, &quot;mild localized pain&quot;, and &quot;severe localized pain&quot;. While there are likely differences in genotypes underlying each phenotype, the specific correlating genotypes have not yet been identified. These phenotypes are prevalent at different levels in different population demographics, suggesting different allelic frequencies across populations (in terms of race, ethnicity, and nationality).

Polymorphisms in the ESR1 gene have been commonly associated with severe dysmenorrhea. Variant genotypes in the metabolic genes such as CYP2D6 and GSTM1 have been similarly been correlated with an increased risk of severe menstrual pain, but not with moderate or occasional phenotypes.

The occurrence and frequency of secondary dysmenorrhea (SD) has been associated with different alleles and genotypes of those with underlying pathologies, which can affect the pelvic region or other areas of the body. Individuals with disorders may have genetic mutations related to their diagnoses which produce dysmenorrhea as a symptom of their primary diagnosis. It has been found that those with fibromyalgia who have the ESR1 gene variation Xbal and possess the Xbal AA genotype are more susceptible to experiencing mild to severe menstrual pain resulting from their primary pathology. Commonly, genetic mutations which are a hallmark of or associated with specific disorders can produce dysmenorrhea as a symptom which accompanies the primary disorder.

In contrast with secondary dysmenorrhea, primary dysmenorrhea (PD) has no underlying pathology. Genetic mutation and variations have therefore been thought to underlie this disorder and contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. There are multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with PD. Two of the most well studied include an SNP in the promoter of MIF and an SNP in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) gene. When a cytosine 173 base pairs upstream of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) promoter was replaced by a guanine there was an associated increase in the likelihood of the individual experiencing PD. While a CC/GG genotype led to an increase in likelihood of the individual experiencing severe menstrual pain, a CC/GC genotype led to a more significant likelihood of the disorder impacting the individual overall and increasing the likelihood of any of the three phenotypes. A second associated SNP was located 308 base pairs upstream from the start codon of the TNF-α gene, in which guanine was substituted for adenine. A GG genotype at the loci is associated with the disorder and has been proposed as a possible genetic marker to predict PD.

There has also been an association with mutations in the MEFV gene and dysmenorrhea, which are considered to be causative. The phenotypes associated with these mutations in the MEFV genes have been better studied; individuals who are heterozygous for these mutations are more likely to be affected by PD which presents as a severe pain phenotype.

Genes related to immunity have been identified as playing a significant role in PD as well. IL1A was found to be the gene most associated with primary dysmenorrhea in terms of its phenotypic impact. This gene encodes a protein essential for the regulation of immunity and inflammation.15 While the mechanism of how it influences PD has yet to be discovered, it is assumed that possible mutations in IL1A or genes which interact with it impact the regulation of inflammation during menstruation. These mutations may therefore affect pain responses during menstruation which lead to the differing phenotypes associated with dysmenorrhea.

Two additionally well studied SNPs which are suspected to contribute to PD were found in ZM1Z1 (the mutant allele called rs76518691) and NGF (the mutant allele called rs7523831). Both ZMIZ1 and NGF are associated with autoimmune responses and diseases, as well as pain response. The implication of these genes impacting Dysmenorrhea is significant as it suggests mutations which affect the immune system (specifically the inflammatory response) and pain response may also be a cause of primary dysmenorrhea.

==Mechanism==

The underlying mechanism of primary dysmenorrhea is the contractions of the muscles of the uterus which induce a local ischemia.

During an individual&#x27;s menstrual cycle, the endometrium thickens in preparation for potential pregnancy. After ovulation, if the ovum is not fertilized and there is no pregnancy, the built-up uterine tissue is not needed and thus shed.

Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are released during menstruation, due to the build up of omega-6 fatty acids. Release of prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators in the uterus cause the uterus to contract and can result in systemic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating and headaches or migraines. Prostaglandins are thought to be a major factor in primary dysmenorrhea. When the uterine muscles contract, they constrict the blood supply to the tissue of the endometrium, which, in turn, breaks down and dies. These uterine contractions continue as they squeeze the old, dead endometrial tissue through the cervix and out of the body through the vagina. These contractions, and the resulting temporary oxygen deprivation to nearby tissues, are thought to be responsible for the pain or cramps experienced during menstruation.

Compared with non-dysmenorrheic individuals, those with primary dysmenorrhea have increased activity of the uterine muscle with increased contractility and increased frequency of contractions.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of dysmenorrhea is usually made simply on a medical history of menstrual pain that interferes with daily activities. However, there is no universally accepted standard technique for quantifying the severity of menstrual pains. There are various quantification models, called menstrual symptometrics, that can be used to estimate the severity of menstrual pains as well as correlate them with pain in other parts of the body, menstrual bleeding and degree of interference with daily activities.

===Further work-up===
Once a diagnosis of dysmenorrhea is made, further workup is required to search for any secondary underlying cause of it, in order to be able to treat it specifically and to avoid the aggravation of a perhaps serious underlying cause.

Further work-up includes a specific medical history of symptoms and menstrual cycles and a pelvic examination. Based on results from these, additional exams and tests may be motivated, such as:
* Gynecologic ultrasonography
* Laparoscopy

==Management==
Treatments that target the mechanism of pain include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and hormonal contraceptives. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin production. With long-term treatment, hormonal birth control reduces the amount of uterine fluid/tissue expelled from the uterus. Thus resulting in shorter, less painful menstruation. These drugs are typically more effective than treatments that do not target the source of the pain (e.g. acetaminophen). Regular physical activity may limit the severity of uterine cramps.

===NSAIDs===
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen are effective in relieving the pain of primary dysmenorrhea. 
They can have side effects of nausea, dyspepsia, peptic ulcer, and diarrhea.

===Hormonal birth control===
Use of hormonal birth control may improve symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea. A 2009 systematic review (updated in 2023) found evidence that the low or medium doses of estrogen contained in the birth control pill reduces pain associated with dysmenorrhea. In addition, no differences between different birth control pill preparations were found. The review did not determine if the estrogen in birth control pills was more effective than NSAIDs.

Norplant and Depo-provera are also effective, since these methods often induce amenorrhea. The intrauterine system (Mirena IUD) may be useful in reducing symptoms.

===Other===
A review indicated the effectiveness of transdermal nitroglycerin.
Reviews indicated magnesium supplementation seemed to be effective.
A review indicated the usefulness of using calcium channel blockers.
Heat is effective compared to NSAIDs and is a preferred option by many patients, as it is easy to access and has no known side effects.

Tamoxifen has been used effectively to reduce uterine contractility and pain in dysmenorrhea patients.

There is some evidence that exercises performed 3 times a week for about 45 to 60 minutes, without particular intensity, reduces menstrual pain.

===Alternative medicine===

There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of many herbal or dietary supplements for treating dysmenorrhea, including melatonin, vitamin E, fennel, dill, chamomile, cinnamon, damask rose, rhubarb, guava, and uzara. Further research is recommended to follow up on weak evidence of benefit for: fenugreek, ginger, valerian, zataria, zinc sulphate, fish oil, and vitamin B1. A 2016 review found that evidence of safety is insufficient for most dietary supplements. There is some evidence for the use of fenugreek.

One review found thiamine and vitamin E to be likely effective. It found the effects of fish oil and vitamin B12 to be unknown. Reviews found tentative evidence that ginger powder may be effective for primary dysmenorrhea. Reviews have found promising evidence for Chinese herbal medicine for primary dysmenorrhea, but that the evidence was limited by its poor methodological quality.

A 2016 Cochrane review of acupuncture for dysmenorrhea concluded that it is unknown if acupuncture or acupressure is effective. There were also concerns of bias in study design and in publication, insufficient reporting (few looked at adverse effects), and that they were inconsistent. There are conflicting reports in the literature, including one review which found that acupressure, topical heat, and behavioral interventions are likely effective. It found the effect of acupuncture and magnets to be unknown.

A 2007 systematic review found some scientific evidence that behavioral interventions may be effective, but that the results should be viewed with caution due to poor quality of the data.

Spinal manipulation does not appear to be helpful. Although claims have been made for chiropractic care, under the theory that treating subluxations in the spine may decrease symptoms, a 2006 systematic review found that overall no evidence suggests that spinal manipulation is effective for treatment of primary and secondary dysmenorrhea.

Valerian, &quot;Humulus lupulus&quot; and &quot;Passiflora incarnata&quot; may be safe and effective in the treatment of dysmenorrhea.

===TENS===
A 2011 review stated that high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may reduce pain compared with sham TENS, but seems to be less effective than ibuprofen.

===Surgery===
One treatment of last resort is presacral neurectomy.

==Epidemiology==
Dysmenorrhea is one of the most common gynecological problems, regardless of age or race. It is one of the most frequently identified causes of pelvic pain in those who menstruate. Dysmenorrhea is estimated to affect between 50% and 90% of female adolescents and women of reproductive age. Another report states that estimates can vary between 16% and 91% of surveyed individuals, with severe pain observed in 2% to 29% of menstruating individuals. Reports of dysmenorrhea are greatest among individuals in their late teens and 20s, with reports usually declining with age. The prevalence in adolescent females has been reported to be 67.2% by one study and 90% by another. It has been stated that there is no significant difference in prevalence or incidence between races, although one study of Hispanic adolescent females indicated an elevated prevalence and impact in this group. Another study indicated that dysmenorrhea was present in 36.4% of participants, and was significantly associated with lower age and lower parity. Childbearing is said to relieve dysmenorrhea, but this does not always occur. One study indicated that in nulliparous individuals with primary dysmenorrhea, the severity of menstrual pain decreased significantly after age 40.

A survey in Norway showed that 14 percent of females between the ages of 20 and 35 experience symptoms so severe that they stay home from school or work. Among adolescent girls, dysmenorrhea is the leading cause of recurrent short-term school absence.

A study from India conducted by Dr RimJhim Kumari found that painful menstruation affected 66.7% of the girls, out of which only 27% sought medical advice from a doctor.

<text>The &quot;Articles of the Church of Christ&quot; was an 1829 revelation purportedly given by God to Oliver Cowdery in the early history of the Latter Day Saint movement. The original Articles were never included in the Mormon canon; however, the language of much of the Articles found its way into various sections of the Book of Commandments and the Doctrine and Covenants, such as D&amp;C 20. The Article begins, &quot;A commandment from God unto Oliver how he should build up his church &amp; the manner thereof—&quot;

<text>A bureau à gradin is an antique desk form resembling a writing table with, in addition, one or several tiers of small drawers and pigeonholes built on part of the desktop surface. Usually the drawers and pigeonholes directly face the user, but they can also surround three sides of the desk, as is the case for the Carlton house desk form. A small, portable version is a bonheur du jour.

In some cases the bureau à gradin has a second tier of drawers under the work surface, and thus looks like an advanced form of the bureau Mazarin or like a non-enclosed version of the cylinder desk, or the tambour desk.

<text>The 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division was an infantry division of the British Army that was originally formed as the Lowland Division, in 1908 as part of the Territorial Force. It later became the 52nd (Lowland) Division in 1915. The 52nd (Lowland) Division fought in the First World War before being disbanded, with the rest of the Territorial Force, in 1920.

The Territorial Force was later reformed as the Territorial Army and the division was again raised, during the inter-war years, as the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division - a 1st Line Territorial Army Infantry Division - and went on to serve during the Second World War.

By December 1947, the formation amalgamated with 51st (Highland) Infantry Division to become 51st/52nd Scottish Division, but, by March 1950, 51st Division and 52nd Division had been recreated as separate formations. 52nd (Lowland) Division finally disbanded in 1968.

==History==

===Formation===
The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades. One of the divisions was the Lowland Division. In peacetime, the divisional headquarters was at 7 West George Street in Glasgow.

===First World War===
====Operations====
The famous territorial regiments that were incorporated in the division were all drawn from the Scottish Lowlands, and have a history that in some cases goes back more than 300 years. It consisted of three infantry brigades, the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade, 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, and 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigades. Initially assigned to the defence of the Scottish coast, the division moved to Gallipoli (without two of its artillery brigades), arriving there in early July 1915. While moving from Scotland the division suffered the loss of 210 officers and men killed, and another 224 injured in the Quintinshill rail crash, near Gretna, that involved the 1/7th Royal Scots.

During the First World War, the division first saw action at Gallipoli. The division, under the command of Major General Granville Egerton, began landing at the Helles front, on the Gallipoli peninsula, in June 1915 as part of VIII Corps. The 156th Brigade was landed in time to take part in the Battle of Gully Ravine, where it was mauled, under the notorious Lieutenant-General Aylmer Hunter-Weston, commanding VIII Corps. Advancing along Fir Tree Spur, to the right of the ravine, the brigade had little artillery support and no experience of the Gallipoli battlefield. The brigade suffered heavy casualties.

When the remaining brigades were landed, they attacked towards Krithia, along Achi Baba Nullah, on 12 July. They succeeded in capturing the Ottoman trenches, but were left unsupported and vulnerable to counter-attack. For a modest gain in ground, they suffered 30 per cent casualties and were in no fit state to exploit their position.

The division moved to Egypt as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, where it manned the east-facing defensive fortifications during the Battle of Romani. On the first, and most crucial day, of the battle the division was heavily engaged with the enemy&#x27;s right flank, while the Australian Light Horse, New Zealand Mounted Rifles, and 5th Mounted Brigades fought the centre and left flank in extended order. With insufficient water, the mid-summer conditions proved too much for the infantry ordered to advance the following day and were not heavily involved in the fighting thereafter. Following the battle, they advanced across the Sinai occupying Bir el Abd, El Mazar and El Arish, but remained in a supporting role.

The division fought in the First and Second Battle of Gaza in March and April 1917.

As a division of XXI Corps, it played an important part in the final overthrow of the Ottomans at the Third Battle of Gaza and the subsequent advance. The division then participated in the Battle of Jerusalem. The Battle of Jaffa saw the passage of the Nahr El Auja, on the night of 20–21 December 1917, by the division&#x27;s three Brigades, which according to General Sir Edmund Allenby&#x27;s despatch &quot;reflects great credit on the 52nd (Lowland) Division. It involved considerable preparation, the details of which were thought out with care and precision. The sodden state of the ground, and, on the night of the crossing, the swollen state of the river, added to the difficulties, yet by dawn the whole of the infantry had crossed. The fact that the enemy were taken by surprise, and, that all resistance was overcome with the bayonet without a shot being fired, bears testimony to the discipline of this division. The operation, by increasing the distance between the enemy and Jaffa from three to eight miles, &quot;rendered Jaffa and its harbour secure, and gained elbow-room for the troops covering Ludd and Ramleh and the main Jaffa-Jerusalem road.&quot;

In April 1918, the division moved to France where it fought in the Second Battle of the Somme, the Second Battle of Arras, and the Battle of the Hindenburg Line during the Hundred Days Offensive.

After the war, the division was disbanded along with the rest of the Territorial Force. However, it was re-established in 1920 as part of the Territorial Army.

===Second World War===

====Operations====
The 52nd (Lowland) Division, which had seen numerous changes in composition during the interwar period, was mobilised, along with the rest of the Territorial Army (previously the Territorial Force, reformed in 1920 and soon renamed the TA), in late August 1939, due to the worsening situation in Europe at the time. The Second World War began on 3 September 1939, after both Britain and France declared war on Germany after the latter&#x27;s invasion of Poland and the 52nd, based in Scotland under the command of Major-General James S. Drew, was serving in Scottish Command, alongside its second line duplicate unit, the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division.

The division was briefly deployed to France, following the Dunkirk evacuation, as part of the Second British Expeditionary Force (2BEF) to cover the withdrawal of Allied forces near Cherbourg during Operation Aerial. The division returned to the United Kingdom and, like most of the rest of the British Army after Dunkirk, began training to repel an expected German invasion, which never occurred. From May 1942 until June 1944, the 52nd was trained in a mountain warfare capacity, originally for a proposed invasion of Norway. However, the division was never employed in this role. Following June 1944, the 52nd Division was reorganised and trained in airlanding operations. As part of this new role, the division was transferred to the First Allied Airborne Army. By this time, the 52nd Division was under the command of Major-General Edmund Hakewill-Smith.
Several operations were planned for the division, following the successful conclusion of the Normandy Campaign. &quot;Operation Transfigure&quot; planned to have the British 1st and American 101st Airborne Divisions capture landing strips near Rambouillet, for the 52nd Division to land at. The three divisions would have then blocked the German line of retreat towards Paris. &quot;Operation Linnet&quot; proposed using most of the First Allied Airborne Army, including the 52nd Division, to seize areas in north-eastern France to block the German line of retreat. As part of &quot;Operation Market Garden&quot;, the British 1st Airborne Division was given a subsidiary mission of capturing Deelen airfield, on which the 52nd Division would land. Due to the disastrous course of events that unfolded during the Battle of Arnhem, where the 1st Airborne Division was virtually destroyed and lost almost 8,000 men, the 52nd Division was not deployed.
The division would never be used in either of the roles it had trained for, and was transferred to Belgium via sea landing in Ostend. The 157th Infantry Brigade landed first at the end of the first week of October and the rest of the division arrived over the course of the following fortnight. On 15 October, the 157th Brigade was, temporarily, attached to the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and relieved the Canadian units in the bridgehead over the Leopold Canal. At first the Scots of 52nd Division and the Canadians did not see eye to eye, with a cultural clash of untidy and &#x27;undisciplined&#x27; Canadians against &#x27;spit and polish&#x27; Scots. On taking over some Canadian positions in mid-October, Scottish officers commented: &quot;No one in Scotland would ask a pig to lie in the houses (recently vacated by the Canadians) on the south side of the canal.&quot; However, both sides soon came to recognise that high fighting capability could be engendered in both approaches.
From 23 October until December, the 52nd (Lowland) Division was assigned to the First Canadian Army, serving first under II Canadian Corps and then the British I Corps. The division&#x27;s first operation would be to aid in opening the vital Belgian port of Antwerp, in the Battle of the Scheldt. Ironically, the first operation of the division would not be in mountainous terrain or being deployed by air, but fighting below sea level on the flooded polders around the Scheldt Estuary of Belgium and the Netherlands. Operation Vitality and Operation Infatuate were aimed at capturing South Beveland and the island of Walcheren to open the mouth of the Scheldt Estuary. This would enable the Allies to use the port of Antwerp as a supply entrepôt for the troops in North-West Europe. It was in this vital operation that the 52nd Division was to fight its first battle with brilliant success that earned them high praise. During the battle, the division was given command &quot;of all the military operations&quot; on Walcheren. This included command of the 4th Commando Brigade, after it had landed on the island, and No. 4 Commando during the assault on Flushing. Following the battle the division would remain on Walcheren until November, when it was relieved by the 4th Canadian Armoured Division.
On 5 December, the division was transferred to XXX Corps of the British Second Army. During the month, the 157th Infantry Brigade was temporarily attached to the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division for several days. In January 1945, the 52nd Division, now serving under XII Corps, participated in Operation Blackcock, the clearing of the Roer Triangle between the rivers Meuse and Roer. During the operation, 19-year-old Fusilier Dennis Donnini of the 4th/5th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. During the operation, the 155th Infantry Brigade was attached to the 7th Armoured Division.

In February and March, the division was slightly reorganised with battalions being transferred amongst the division&#x27;s brigades. Peter White, a second lieutenant within the 4th Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, describes this change due to 21st Army Group commander Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;aversion to two Battalions of the same Regiment&quot; being in the same brigade as it could result &quot;in one home district or town having disproportionate losses after any sticky action&quot;. For most of April, the 155th Infantry Brigade was again attached to the 7th Armoured Division &quot;to drive for the Elbe across Lüneburg Heath&quot;. The division (minus the 155th Brigade) took part in the Western Allied invasion of Germany, with its last major action being the Battle of Hamburg, where it ended the war.

===Post Second World War===
During 1946, the First Canadian Army was withdrawn from Germany and disbanded. As it withdrew from Germany, it &quot;turned over its responsibilities&quot; to the 52nd Division. After its postwar demobilisation, the TA was reformed in 1947. The division was amalgamated with the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division to form the 51st/52nd Scottish Division, while the surplus Lowland artillery regiments formed a separate 85 (Field) Army Group Royal Artillery (Lowland) in Scottish Command on 1 January 1947. In 1950, the 51st/52nd (Scottish) Division was split, restoring the independence of the 52nd Lowland Division, which took regional command of Territorial Army units based in the Scottish Lowlands, including the Territorial infantry battalions of the Lowland Brigade regiments. On 1 July 1950 85 AGRA was once more designated as HQ RA 52 (Lowland) Division. In 1967, 52nd Lowland Division was reduced to brigade strength: two brigade-level districts were established in the Highlands and Lowlands, with the Lowland District Headquarters commanded by Major General Sir Francis James Cecil Bowes-Lyon in Hamilton, near Glasgow.

<doc id="411886" wikidata="Q2928328" url="?curid=411886" title="Bureau Mazarin">
<text>The bureau Mazarin is a 17th-century desk form named after Cardinal Mazarin, who was the Chief minister of France from 1642 to 1661. It is the earliest predecessor of the pedestal desk and differs from it by having only two tiers of drawers or three tiers of rather small drawers under the desktop surface, followed by eight legs supporting the whole. Also, the bureau Mazarin has cross braces between the legs, forming two Xs or two Hs on each side.

A bureau Mazarin is usually a kneehole desk, in that it is meant to be used sideways, with one knee only beneath the work surface. The kneehole desk was designed in an age where only the nobility, or those who followed its customs closely, could afford to have such desks made. Members of the nobility often wore a ceremonial or practical sword, which was forever in the way. It was thus easier to use a desk sideways, with only one knee under it. The rest of the space next to the knee often served as a lockable storage space.

As was often the case with many desks of the period, the bureau Mazarin was often used as a dressing table instead of serving as a desk, or was used for both functions.

As with the Kunstschrank of the lands of the Holy Roman Empire, the desk was sometimes more of a status symbol than a useful piece of furniture.

<doc id="411887" wikidata="Q16513416" url="?curid=411887" title="Faithfulness">
<text>Faithfulness means unfailingly remaining loyal to someone or something, and putting that loyalty into consistent practice regardless of extenuating circumstances. It may be exhibited, for example, by a husband or wife who does not engage in sexual relationships outside of the marriage. It can also mean keeping one&#x27;s promises no matter the prevailing circumstances, such as in certain communities of monks who take a vow of silence. Literally, it is the state of being full of faith in the sense of steady devotion to a person, thing, or concept.

== Etymology ==
Its etymology is distantly related to that of fidelity; indeed, in modern electronic devices, a machine with high &quot;fidelity&quot; is considered &quot;faithful&quot; to its source material. Similarly, a spouse who, inside a sexually exclusive relationship, has sexual relations outside of marriage could be considered as being &quot;unfaithful&quot; and as having committed &quot;infidelity&quot;.

== Religions ==
Sexual faithfulness within a marriage is a required tenet in Christianity—one of the four pillars of marriage. It is also required in Jewish marriage, and Islam.

<doc id="411888" wikidata="Q477172" url="?curid=411888" title="Premarital sex">
<text>Premarital sex is sex before marriage. It is an act of sex between two people who are not married to each other. Premarital sex is considered a sin by a number of religions and also considered a moral issue which is taboo in many cultures. Since the Sexual Revolution of the 1960s, it has become accepted by certain liberal and progressive social movements, especially in the Western world. A 2014 Pew study on global morality found that premarital sex was considered particularly unacceptable in Muslim-majority countries, such as Malaysia, Jordan, and Pakistan, each having over 90% disapproval, while people in Western European countries were the most accepting, with Spain, Germany, and France expressing less than 10% disapproval.

==Definition==
Until the 1950s, &quot;premarital sex&quot; referred to sexual relations between two people prior to marrying each other. During that period, it was the norm in Western societies for men and women to marry above the age of 21, and there were no considerations that one who had sex would not marry. The term was used instead of fornication, which had negative connotations, and was closely related to the concept and approval of virginity, which is sexual abstinence until marriage.

The meaning has since shifted to refer to any sexual relations a person has prior to marriage and removing the emphasis on the relationship of the people involved. The definition has a degree of ambiguity. It is not clear whether sex between individuals legally forbidden from marrying or the sexual relations of one uninterested in marrying would be considered premarital.

Alternative terms for premarital sex have been suggested, including &quot;non-marital sex&quot; (which overlaps with adultery), &quot;youthful sex&quot;, &quot;adolescent sex&quot;, and &quot;young-adult sex&quot;. These terms also suffer from a degree of ambiguity, as the definition of &quot;having sex&quot; differs from person to person.

==Prevalence==
In modern Western cultures, social value of sexual abstinence before marriage has declined. Historically, a significant portion of people had engaged in premarital sex, although the number willing to admit to this was not always high. In a study conducted in the United States, 61 percent of men and 12 percent of women born prior to 1910 admitted to having premarital sex; this gender disparity may have been caused by cultural double standards regarding the admission of sexual activity, or by men frequenting prostitutes.

Starting in the 1920s, and especially after World War II, premarital sex became more common, particularly among women. By the end of the 20th century, between 75 and 80 percent of Americans had experienced sexual intercourse before the age of 22. This has been attributed to numerous causes, including the increasing median age at marriage and the widespread availability of efficient contraceptives.

According to a 2001 UNICEF survey, in 10 out of 12 developed nations with available data, more than two-thirds of young people have had sexual intercourse while still in their teens. In Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States, the proportion is over 80%. In Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, approximately 25% of 15-year-olds and 50% of 17-year-olds have sex. In a 2005 Kaiser Family Foundation study of US teenagers, 29% of teens reported feeling pressure to have sex, 33% of sexually active teens reported &quot;being in a relationship where they felt things were moving too fast sexually&quot;, and 24% had &quot;done something sexual they didn&#x27;t really want to do&quot;. Several polls have indicated peer pressure as a factor in encouraging both girls and boys to have sex.

A majority of Americans have had premarital sex, according to a 2007 article in Public Health Reports. This is true for current young adults and also young adults in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Data from the National Survey of Family Growth indicate that in 2002, 77% of Americans had sex by age 20, and of that percent, 75% had premarital sex. Of women who were born between 1949 and 1978, approximately 91% had premarital sex by age 30, and of women who were born between 1939 and 1948, 82% of them had had premarital sex by age 30. 

When comparing the General Social Survey of 1988–1996 to the one of 2004–2012, researchers found that participants of 2004–2012 did not report more sexual partners since the age of 18, nor more frequent sex or sex partners during the past year than those respondents of the previous survey. There appears to be no substantial change in sexual behavior contrasting the earlier era to the current one. Current-era respondents were more likely to report having sex with a casual date or friend than reporting having sex with a spouse or regular partner. From 1943 to 1999, young women&#x27;s approval towards premarital sex increased from 12% to 73%, and from 40% to 79% among young men. The percentage of people who felt guilt around premarital sex also decreased during this period. As of 2005, less than 25% of people believe premarital sex is “always or almost always” wrong.

===Gender differences===
Within the United States, a cohort study of young adults in university found that men self-report more permissive attitudes about casual sex than women. Another study found university students can be grouped by their ideal relationships—those who express a desire for sex exclusively in a committed partnership have fewer hookups and &quot;friends with benefits&quot; partners than those categorised as desiring &quot;flexible&quot; relationships and recreational sex.

A 2006 study that analysed the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study found that more boys report having non-dating sexual partners than girls. Of this sample, a third of boys only have had sex with their romantic partner. A third of boys who have had sex with a partner they are not dating within the past year wished for the girl to be their girlfriend.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmiddoi: 10.1177/0743558406291692&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many young adults are more likely to engage in sex with romantic partners than with casual acquaintances or &quot;friends with benefits.&quot;

A 2011 study that surveyed young adults about their emotional reactions after premarital sexual encounters found that men reported more positive and fewer negative emotional reactions, and both men and women reported that the experience was largely more positive than negative. Women reported that condom use was associated with fewer positive and more negative emotional reactions, and for men condom use was associated with fewer negative emotional reactions. A 23-year study in a Human Sexuality class investigated gender differences in men and women&#x27;s reactions to their first sexual experience. In the earlier years of the study, men reported more pleasure and greater anxiety than women, while women reported more feelings of guilt than men. Cohort studies carried out over 23 years found that in later years, women expressed greater pleasure and less guilt. The differences between emotional reactions among men and women decreased slightly during the 23 years. Such decreases in differences to first sexual intercourse may be a result of the increasing normality of premarital sex in America. An international online sex survey compared responses of residents of 37 countries against World Economic Forum figures for gender equality in those countries, finding that countries with high gender equality had respondents report more casual sex, a greater number of sex partners, younger ages for first sex, and greater tolerance of premarital sex.

In some countries, gender differences with premarital sex can be linked to virginity. In India, a woman may undergo a &quot;virginity test&quot; on her wedding night where she can be banished by her husband or subject to an honor killing if found she is no longer a virgin. Men are not subjected to this same test and could get away with having premarital sex. In Iran, if a husband finds out his wife had premarital sex, it can be used as grounds for divorce. Therefore, hymen reconstruction surgery is not uncommon for women who wish to prove their virginity.

===Ethnicity differences===
Different ethnic and cultural groups in America have varied religiosity and sexual attitudes. A study with college participants found that Asians had more conservative sexual attitudes compared to Hispanics and Euro-Americans. Hispanics reported sexual attitudes similar to that of Euro-Americans. Asian, Hispanic, and Euro-American women with high levels of spirituality were found to have a correlation between conservative sexual attitudes and perceived religiosity. Religiosity and religious fundamentalism most strongly predicted conservative sexual attitudes in Euro-Americans and Asians.

In the Indian city of Mumbai, research showed that among college-age students, 3% of females affirmed having premarital sex and 26% of males affirmed having premarital sex. Population Council, an international NGO, released a working report in 2006 showing similar statistics nationally in India, with fewer than ten percent of young females reporting having had premarital sex, compared with 15% to 30% of young males. In Pakistan, 11% of men were reported as having participated in pre-marital sex, although a greater percentage, 29% reported having participated in non-marital sex.

==Safe sex practices==
People who have premarital sex are recommended by health professionals to take precautions to protect themselves against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV/AIDS. There is also a risk of an unplanned pregnancy in heterosexual relationships. Around the world, sex education programs are run to teach school students about reproductive health, safe sex, sexual abstinence, and birth control.

Sexual activity among unmarried people who do not have access to information about reproductive health and birth control can increase the rate of teenage pregnancies and contraction of sexually transmitted infections. The rates of teenage pregnancy vary and range from 143 per 1000 girls in some sub-Saharan African countries to 2.9 per 1000 girls in South Korea. The rate for the United States is 52.1 per 1000, the highest in the developed world, and about four times the European Union average. The teenage pregnancy rates between countries must take into account the level of general sex education available and access to contraceptive options.

== Religion ==
Views on premarital sex are often shaped by religious teachings and beliefs, in part because ancient religious texts forbid it. People who actively practice religion are less likely to engage in premarital sex or at least go longer before having sex for the first time. Evangelical Christian young adults (ages 15 through 22) who are never married are much less likely to engage in premarital sex if they attend church services on a weekly basis, compared to those with no church attendance. Additionally, among Christians who have never been married, those who consider religion to be &quot;very important&quot; engage less in premarital sexual intercourse than those who view religion as &quot;somewhat important&quot;. Those young adult Christians who belong to conservative denominations (e.g. Conservative Mennonites) are less likely to engage in premarital sex than those who are members of mainline churches. 

One study published in 2013 indicated that Muslims and Hindus are less likely to report having premarital sex than Christians, Jews, and Buddhists. The study indicated that people in predominantly Islamic societies have the lowest report of engaging in premarital sex, 53% lower than Christians (primarily in Europe and North America). Buddhists, Jews, and individuals from other religious traditions are more likely to report premarital sex compared to Christians. While Christianity, Judaism, and Islam have strict rules regarding sex outside of marriage, Buddhism lacks such specific behavioral prohibitions, though its ethical precepts still discourage premarital sex. Studies shows Buddhists are more likely than Muslims, Christians, Hindus, and people of traditional faiths to report premarital sex, with rates similar to Jews and no significant differences regarding extramarital sex.

Students who attend a faith-based (predominantly Christian) university view premarital sexual activity more negatively than students who do not.

==Cultural views==
The cultural acceptability of premarital sex varies between individuals, cultures and time periods. Western cultures have traditionally been disapproving of it, on occasions forbidding it. In other cultures, such as the Muria people of Madhya Pradesh, sexuality prior to marriage is accepted and at times expected.

Individual views within a given society can vary greatly, with expectations ranging from total abstinence to frequent casual sex. These views are dependent on the holders&#x27; value system, as formed by their parents, religion, friends, experiences, and in many cases the media. Unmarried cohabitation and births outside marriage have increased in many Western countries during the past few decades. Economist Jeremy Greenwood (2019, Chp. 4) discusses how technological progress in contraception led to a rise in premarital sex and less stigmatization by parents, churches, and governments. He argues that singles weigh the cost (a potential pregnancy) and benefit of premarital sex. As contraception improved the cost of premarital sexual activity fell. Parents and social institutions also weigh the cost and benefit of socialization. Technological improvement in contraception reduced the benefit of socialization because premarital sexual activity was no longer as risky in terms of unwanted pregnancies, which placed a strain on parents and social institutions. As a result, there was social change.

===United Kingdom===
Sex before the public marriage ceremony was normal in the Anglican Church until the Marriage Act 1753, which for the first time required all marriages in England and Wales occur in their parish church. (The law also applied to Catholics, but Jews and Quakers were exempt.) Before its enactment couples lived and slept together after their betrothal or &quot;the spousals&quot;, which was considered a legal marriage. Until the mid-1700s it was normal and acceptable for the bride to be pregnant at the nuptials, the later public ceremony for the marriage. The Marriage Act 1753 combined the spousals and nuptials, and by the start of the 19th century social convention prescribed that brides be virgins at marriage. Illegitimacy became more socially discouraged, with first pregnancies outside marriage declining from 40% to 20% during the Victorian era. At the start of the 21st century, the figure was back up to 40%.

In the United Kingdom, births outside marriage were up to 47.6% by 2012. In 2014, only 13% of the population found premarital sex unacceptable.

===United States===
During the colonial period, premarital sex was publicly frowned upon but privately condoned to an extent. Unmarried teenagers were often allowed to spend the night in bed together, though some measures such as bundling were sometimes attempted to prevent sexual intercourse. Even though premarital sex was somewhat condoned, having a child outside wedlock was not. If a pregnancy resulted from premarital sex, the young couple were expected to marry. Marriage and birth records from the late 1700s reveal that between 30 and 40 percent of New England brides were pregnant before marriage.

The growing prevalence of the automobile, and corresponding changes in dating practices, caused premarital sex to become more prevalent. Alfred Kinsey found that American women who became sexually mature during the 1920s were much less likely to be virgins at marriage than those who became mature before World War I. A majority of women during the 1920s under the age of 30 were nonetheless virgins at marriage, however, and half of those who were not only had sex with their fiancés. A 1938 survey of American college students found that 52% of men and 24% of women had had sex. 37% of women surveyed reported being virgins but believed sex outside marriage was acceptable. Prior to the middle of the 20th century, sexuality was generally constrained. Sexual interactions between people without plans to marry was considered unacceptable, with betrothal slightly lessening the stigma. However, premarital sex was still frowned upon.

Beginning in the 1950s, as premarital sex became more common, the stigma attached to it lessened for many people. In 1969, 70% of Americans disapproved of premarital sex, but by 1973 this number had dropped to 50%. By 2000, roughly a third of couples in the United States had lived together prior to marriage. During the second half of the twentieth century, premarital sex has remained steady for men, but 60% more women lost their virginity prior to marriage during this same period. This has altered the traditional nuclear family, with half of all children living with a single parent at some point in their life.

During this period of sexual liberation, sexual media and pornography became more prevalent and normalized premarital sex. People who watched pornography viewed both adult and teenage premarital sex as societally acceptable.

However, premarital sex was considered unacceptable by 30% of the population in a 2014 study, while 29% found it acceptable, and 36% considered it not a moral issue.

==Studies==
According to a 2004 peer-reviewed study published in the &quot;Journal of Marriage and Family&quot; found that women who have more than one premarital sexual relationship have a higher likelihood in the long run of disruptions if ever married, with this effect being the &quot;strongest for women who have multiple premarital co-residential unions&quot;. Kahn and London (1991) found that premarital sex and divorce are positively correlated.

==Law==
In December 2022 Indonesia&#x27;s parliament passed a bill that partially criminalizes sex outside marriage and cohabitation. Government officials have stated that the new criminal code respects privacy and human rights, due to the law being codified and complaint based, which can only be filed by a spouse or parents or children. With the code, government expected that local law enforcement will not invade privacy due to being codified and there will be no more local regulation sweeping power to their local law enforcement. &quot;When these articles are regulated in the criminal code, there would definitely be no raids,&quot; deputy minister of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights said. He explained that so far, there have been regulations in several regions based on which, officers of the Public Order Agency (Satpol PP) have carried out raids at hotels and inns.
After the articles are regulated in the criminal code and an explanation is provided, those regulations that are beneath the law will all be revoked, he said. Indonesia is predominantly Muslim.

<doc id="411889" wikidata="Q888599" url="?curid=411889" title="Bobby Rush">
<text>Bobby Lee Rush (born November 23, 1946) is an American politician, activist and pastor who served as the U.S. representative for for three decades, ending in 2023. A civil rights activist during the 1960s, Rush co-founded the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party.

Rush was first elected to Congress in 1992. He won consecutive reelections until his retirement. His district was originally principally on the South Side of Chicago, with a population from 2003 to early 2013 that was 65% African-American, a higher proportion than any other congressional district. In 2011 the Illinois General Assembly redistricted this area after the 2010 census. Although still minority-majority, since early 2013 it is 51.3% African American, 36.1% White, 9.8% Hispanic, and 2% Asian. A member of the Democratic Party, Rush is the only politician to have defeated Barack Obama in an election, which he did in the 2000 Democratic primary for Illinois&#x27;s 1st congressional district.

On January 3, 2022, Rush announced that he was retiring from Congress.

==Early life, education, and activism==
Rush was born on November 23, 1946, in Albany, Georgia. After his parents separated when Rush was 7 years old, his mother took him and his siblings to Chicago, Illinois, joining the Great Migration of African Americans out of the South in the first part of the 20th century. In 1963, Rush dropped out of high school before graduating and joined the U.S. Army. While stationed in Chicago in 1966, he joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which had helped obtain national civil rights legislation passed in 1964 and 1965. In 1968, he went AWOL from the Army and co-founded the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers. He later finished his Army service, receiving an honorable discharge.

Throughout the 1960s, Rush was involved in the civil rights movement and worked in civil disobedience campaigns in the southern United States. After co-founding the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party in 1968, he served as its defense minister. After the Chicago Police Department and the State&#x27;s Attorney Office assassinated Black Panther Fred Hampton in a police raid, Rush said, &quot;We needed to arm ourselves&quot;, and called the police &quot;pigs&quot;. Earlier that year, Rush had discussed the philosophy of his membership in the Black Panthers, saying, &quot;Black people have been on the defensive for all these years. The trend now is not to wait to be attacked. We advocate offensive violence against the power structure.&quot; After Hampton&#x27;s death, Rush became acting chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party. He worked on several nonviolent projects that built support for the Black Panthers in African-American communities, such as coordinating a medical clinic which offered sickle-cell anemia testing on an unprecedented scale. Rush was imprisoned for six months in 1972 on a weapons charge after carrying a pistol into a police station. In 1974, he left the Black Panthers, who were already in decline. &quot;We started glorifying thuggery and drugs&quot;, he told &quot;People&quot;. A deeply religious born-again Christian, Rush said, &quot;I don&#x27;t repudiate any of my involvement in the Panther party—it was part of my maturing.&quot;

==Formal education==
Rush earned his Bachelor of General Studies with honors from Roosevelt University in 1973, and a Master&#x27;s degree in political science from University of Illinois at Chicago in 1974. He completed a degree in theological studies at McCormick Theological Seminary in 1998. On May 13, 2017, Rush received a Doctorate of Humanities, &quot;honoris causa&quot;, from the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) for his outstanding contributions to Chicago.

==Politics==
===Chicago politics===
In 1975, Rush ran for a seat on the Chicago City Council, the first of several black militants to seek political office, and lost to incumbent alderman William Barnett, receiving 23% of the vote to Barnett&#x27;s 55% and Larry S. Bullock&#x27;s 21%. He ran again in 1983 and won, alongside Harold Washington&#x27;s victory as Chicago&#x27;s first black mayor. Rush supported Washington&#x27;s coalition during the Council Wars that followed the 1983 election. Rush&#x27;s allies in the black-power movement abandoned the Democrats in the wake of the political turmoil that followed the sudden death of Washington in 1987, and formed their own political party, naming it after Washington. Rush infuriated Harold Washington Party leaders by spurning their candidates for local offices and sometimes backing white Democrats instead. He worked with the Democrats and was rewarded with the deputy chairmanship of the state party.

=== Congressional elections ===

After redistricting in 1992, Rush ran in Illinois&#x27;s newly redrawn 1st congressional district, which included much of Chicago&#x27;s South Side. The district had a high proportion of African-American residents; it has been represented by Black congressmen since 1929. Rush defeated incumbent U.S. Representative Charles Hayes and six other candidates in the Democratic primary election. He won the general election with 83% of the vote. (The 1st is so heavily Democratic that Rush had all but assured himself of a seat in Congress with his primary win.) The district has been in Democratic hands since 1935.

In the 2000 Democratic primary for the district, Rush was challenged by Illinois State Senator Barack Obama. During the primary, Rush said, &quot;Barack Obama went to Harvard and became an educated fool. Barack is a person who read about the civil rights protests and thinks he knows all about it.&quot;

Rush claimed Obama was insufficiently rooted in Chicago&#x27;s black neighborhoods to represent constituents&#x27; concerns. Obama said Rush was a part of &quot;a politics that is rooted in the past&quot; and said he could build bridges with whites to get things done. But while Obama did well in his own Hyde Park base, he did not get enough support from the surrounding black neighborhoods. Starting with 10% name recognition, Obama eventually gained 30% of the vote, losing by more than 2 to 1 despite winning among white voters. Rush won 61% of the vote, and won the general election with 88% of the vote.

=== Subsequent Chicago politics ===
In 1999, Rush ran for mayor of Chicago, but lost to incumbent Richard M. Daley, an ethnic Irish American whose father had long controlled the city as mayor. He remained active in city and regional politics.

In 2013, Rush criticized U.S. Senator Mark Kirk&#x27;s proposal that 18,000 members of the Chicago gang &quot;Gangster Disciples&quot; be arrested, calling Kirk&#x27;s suggestion &quot;headline grabbing&quot; and an &quot;upper-middle-class, elitist white boy solution to a problem he knows nothing about&quot;. A spokesman for Kirk said Kirk had dealt with the issues for decades.

Also in 2013, Alex Clifford was forced to resign as CEO of Metra commuter rail agency, but soon after he left, a memo was released indirectly accusing Rush of using his political power to steer a $50,000 contract to a Washington-based business group.

===Endorsements===

In the 2015 Chicago mayoral election, Rush endorsed Mayor Rahm Emanuel in Emanuel&#x27;s runoff reelection campaign against Jesus &quot;Chuy&quot; Garcia.

In the 2019 Chicago mayoral election, Rush endorsed Bill Daley in the first round and Toni Preckwinkle in the runoff.

Though a very close friend of former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, Rush announced early on in the 2008 Democratic primaries that he would support Obama. After Obama won the presidency and vacated his Senate seat, Rush said that an African American should be appointed to the seat: &quot;With the resignation of President-elect Obama, we now have no African-Americans in the United States Senate, and we believe it will be a national disgrace to not have this seat filled by one of the many capable African-American Illinois politicians.&quot; Rush said he did not support any particular person and was not interested in the seat. On December 30, 2008, Governor Rod Blagojevich announced his appointment of Roland Burris, the former Attorney General of Illinois; Rush was present at the press conference and spoke in support of Burris.

Rush endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. After she dropped out, he endorsed Michael Bloomberg and became his campaign&#x27;s national co-chair.

Rush endorsed incumbent Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 Chicago mayoral election. After Lightfoot failed to advance to the runoff, Rush endorsed Paul Vallas, who was backed by Chicago&#x27;s Fraternal Order of Police. Vallas lost to progressive Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

Rush had been considered a loyal Democrat during his tenure; in the 110th Congress, he voted with his party 97.8% of the time. Rush was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and the House Baltic Caucus.

===Issues===
;Fiscal and Income
Rush initiated the Chicago Partnership for the Earned Income Tax Credit, an ongoing program designed to help low-income working Chicago residents receive the Earned Income Tax Credit, a federal income tax credit.

;Healthcare
Rush sponsored the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act passed in 1999. The law temporarily addressed the nursing shortage by providing non-immigrant visas for qualified foreign nurses in Chicago&#x27;s Englewood neighborhood and was reauthorized in 2005. Rush sponsored the Melanie Blocker-Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act, named for a Chicago native who jumped to her death from a 12th-story window due to postpartum depression. The bill would provide for research on postpartum depression and psychosis and services for people suffering from these disorders. The Children&#x27;s Health Act, passed in 2000, incorporated Rush&#x27;s Urban Asthma Reduction Act of 1999, amending the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant program and including an integrated approach to asthma management.

;Energy
Rush was very outspoken against the GOP&#x27;s No More Solyndras Bill, which would override a loan guarantee by the Energy Department to encourage research and development. The Energy Department provided a federal loan guarantee to the solar manufacturing company Solyndra to help with R&amp;D. He said the No More Solyndras Bill would be better named the No More Innovation Bill.

;Firearms
Rush introduced Blair Holt&#x27;s Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009 on January 6, 2009. The bill would require all owners of handguns and semiautomatic firearms to register for a federal firearms license. All sales of the subject firearms would have to go through a licensed dealer. It would also make it illegal not to register as an owner of a firearm.

;Darfur genocide
On July 15, 2004, Rush became the second sitting member of Congress, after Charles Rangel and before Joe Hoeffel, to be arrested for trespassing while protesting the genocide in Darfur and other violations of human rights in Sudan in front of the Sudanese Embassy.

;Armed forces
On February 13, 2007, Rush opposed President George W. Bush&#x27;s proposed 20,000-serviceman troop surge in Iraq. He said the troops&#x27; presence in Iraq was the greatest catalyst of violence there and advocated a political resolution of the situation. Rush said the troop surge would serve only to make the Iraqi situation more volatile.

;Trayvon Martin
On March 28, 2012, Rush addressed the House while wearing a hoodie in honor of Trayvon Martin, a teenager who was shot in Florida by a local resident. He spoke against racial profiling. As the House forbids its members from wearing headgear as a breach of decorum, Rush was called out of order and escorted from the chamber.

;Lynching
Rush twice introduced the Emmett Till Antilynching Act (named for Chicago teenager Emmett Till) to make lynching a federal crime. Federal anti-lynching legislation in Congress had been held up for about 100 years, but the Emmett Till Act finally became law in 2022.

===Committee assignments===
In the 115th United States Congress (January 3, 2017, to January 3, 2019):
*Committee on Energy and Commerce
**Subcommittee on Communications and Technology
**Subcommittee on Energy (Chair)

===Missed votes===
Rush&#x27;s career average missed vote percentage is 15.7, much higher than the median missed vote percentage of 2.2 for members of the House. In the first session of the 114th session of Congress (January to December 2015), Rush missed 15.6% of the votes and ranked 12th in missed votes. He had the distinction of missing more votes than any other member of the House between 2007 and 2015: of 6,906 votes, Rush missed 1,549 (22.4%). Health issues for Rush and his wife were his main explanations for his high number of missed votes.

===Ethics concerns and conflicts of interest===
The Office of Congressional Ethics referred a matter involving Rush to the House Ethics Committee in 2014. The Office of Congressional Ethics report found he did not pay about $365,000 in rent for longtime use of an office to conduct politics. Rush has paid family members for years in questionable practices. He had a family member who for years worked for his church but was paid by a campaign supporter and friend. The Federal Election Commission questioned a Rush campaign-finance report that showed thousands of dollars spent on vague categories such as &quot;campaign visibility&quot; and &quot;services rendered.&quot; His campaign paid his wife, Carolyn, $50,000 in 2015 for consulting, and his brother, Marlon Rush of Lansing, $13,000 in 2016 for two months&#x27; work as campaign manager, according to FEC reports. Oxford Media Group Inc., an Oak Brook company owned by multimillionaire businessman Joseph Stroud, paid the Commonwealth Edison bill—which was well past due, totaling $17,900 for Rush&#x27;s Beloved Community Christian Church in 2010. Rush had personally been named in a ComEd lawsuit over the church&#x27;s previous unpaid bills. Stroud was trying to break into the wireless phone industry dominated by Verizon and AT&amp;T, and Rush was pushing for federal tax incentives that would give one of Stroud&#x27;s other companies a leg up as a minority-owned business. A nonprofit Rush started got $1 million from the charitable arm of what is now AT&amp;T for what turned out to be a failed effort to create a &quot;technology center&quot; in Englewood. At the time, the telecom giant was seeking support for legislation in a House committee of which Rush was a key member.

From 2001 to 2013, businesses counting on favorable actions by Rush in Congress donated roughly $1.7 million to his pet charities. Rush attracted more charitable corporate giving than any other Illinois congressman by a large margin, according to a Sunlight Foundation study of expenditures from 2009 to 2011. While it is impossible to assign cause and effect, at critical junctures Rush parted with fellow liberal Democrats in Congress to take pro-industry positions aligned with corporate benefactors SBC/AT&amp;T, Comcast and ComEd.

===Electoral history===










































==Beloved Community Christian Church==
Rush is pastor of the Beloved Community Christian Church in Chicago&#x27;s Englewood neighborhood. Leaders of other Englewood nonprofit organizations complained that the church&#x27;s programs—a community development corporation Rebirth of Englewood, a public health center, and a group serving teens convicted of crimes—received inordinate government aid and weighed heavily on their own efforts for renewal.

===Unpaid taxes and wage garnishment===
In 2013, Rush and his wife, the Beloved Community Christian Church of which Rush is pastor, and another nonprofit organization operating out of the church had tax delinquencies totaling $195,000, and the pattern of tax delinquency was a decade old. Unpaid taxes included property taxes, income taxes, and employee withholding taxes. New City Bank sued Rush and his wife for $500,000, claiming they failed to pay their property taxes in 2009. In 1994, Rush owed the IRS $55,000 in federal income taxes, according to Cook County records.

Since 2018, 15% of Rush&#x27;s congressional salary has been garnished to repay more than $1 million he owes on a delinquent loan for the now-closed church he founded in Chicago. Cook County Circuit Judge Alexander White ordered Rush to repay the $550,000 loan that New City Bank granted him and seven other co-signers in 2005. With the money, Rush bought the former Our Redeemer Lutheran Church in Englewood and restyled it as the Beloved Community Church of God in Christ.

==Personal life==

Rush has been married three times. His first marriage, when he was 19, was to Sandra Milan. They had two children together and divorced in 1973. He was married to community organizer, precinct captain, and political strategist Carolyn Thomas from 1980 or 1981 until her death from congestive heart failure on March 13, 2017. Their blended family had seven surviving children at the time of her death. On June 30, 2018, Rush married minister and author Paulette Holloway.

Rush&#x27;s son Huey Rich was murdered on the South Side of Chicago at age 29, in October 1999. He was named after Black Panther co-founder Huey P. Newton. Rich&#x27;s mother was Saundra Rich, whom Rush never married. On October 18, 1999, Rich was approached outside his apartment building by Leo Foster and Darcell Prince, who falsely claimed to be police officers. They wore bulletproof vests, and carried walkie-talkies, guns, and badges, but Rich didn&#x27;t believe them and ran. Foster and Prince chased and shot Rich, then stole several hundred dollars and keys from his pockets. He died in the hospital four days later from extensive blood loss. Foster told police that he and Prince were coming to collect $110,000 worth of cocaine that Rich had been paid to procure but hadn&#x27;t delivered. Rich&#x27;s friends didn&#x27;t believe Foster&#x27;s story, with some suggesting it may have been a case of mistaken identity. Rush said Rich &quot;was involved in positive—as far as I know—endeavors&quot;, adding &quot;as parents, we don&#x27;t always know&quot;. Foster was sentenced to 60 years in prison for the murder and Prince to 50 years. The murder prompted Rush to prioritize efforts to reduce gun violence.

In 2008, Rush had a rare type of malignant tumor removed from his salivary gland. He is a member of Iota Phi Theta fraternity. According to a DNA analysis conducted under the auspices of the TV program &quot;Know Your Heritage,&quot; he is descended mainly from the Ashanti people of Ghana. Rush attributed his election to Congress to Tony Robbins. His heroes include Abraham Lincoln, Kit Carson, and Huey P. Newton.

In 2018, Rush&#x27;s son Flynn Rush unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Illinois House of Representatives, losing in the Democratic primary to Curtis Tarver.

<text>The United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is the corporate research laboratory for the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps. Located in Washington, DC, it was founded in 1923 and conducts basic scientific research, applied research, technological development and prototyping. The laboratory&#x27;s specialties include plasma physics, space physics, materials science, and tactical electronic warfare. NRL is one of the first US government scientific R&amp;D laboratories, having opened in 1923 at the instigation of Thomas Edison, and is currently under the Office of Naval Research.

As of 2016, NRL was a Navy Working Capital Fund activity, which means it is not a line-item in the US Federal Budget. Instead of direct funding from Congress, all costs, including overhead, were recovered through sponsor-funded research projects. NRL&#x27;s research expenditures were approximately $1 billion per year.

==Research==
The Naval Research Laboratory conducts a wide variety of basic research and applied research relevant to the US Navy. NRL scientists and engineers author over 1200 openly published research papers in a wide range of conferences, symposia, and journals each year.

It has a history of scientific breakthroughs and technological achievements dating back to its foundation in 1923. In some instances the laboratory&#x27;s contributions to military technology have been declassified decades after those technologies have become widely adopted.

In 2011, NRL researchers published 1,398 unclassified scientific and technical articles, book chapters and conference proceedings. In 2008, the NRL was ranked No. 3 among all U.S. institutions holding nanotechnology-related patents, behind IBM and the University of California.

Current areas of research at NRL include, for example:
* Advanced radio, optical and infrared sensors
* Autonomous systems
* Computer science, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence
* Communications Technology (e.g., radio, networking, optical transmission)
* Directed energy technology
* Electronic electro-optical device technology
* Electronic warfare
* Enhanced maintainability, reliability and survivability technology
* Environmental effects on naval systems
* Human-robot interaction
* Imaging research and systems
* Information Security
* Marine geosciences
* Materials
* Meteorology
* Ocean acoustics
* Oceanography
* Plasma physics
* Space systems and technology
* Surveillance and sensor technology
* Undersea technology

In 2014, the NRL was researching: armor for munitions in transport, high-powered lasers, remote explosives detection, spintronics, the dynamics of explosive gas mixtures, electromagnetic railgun technology, detection of hidden nuclear materials, graphene devices, high-power extremely high frequency (35–220 GHz) amplifiers, acoustic lensing, information-rich orbital coastline mapping, arctic weather forecasting, global aerosol analysis &amp; prediction, high-density plasmas, millisecond pulsars, broadband laser data links, virtual mission operation centers, battery technology, photonic crystals, carbon nanotube electronics, electronic sensors, mechanical nano-resonators, solid-state chemical sensors, organic opto-electronics, neural-electronic interfaces and self-assembling nanostructures.

The laboratory includes a range of R&amp;D facilities. 2014 additions included the NRL Nanoscience Institute&#x27;s Class 100 nanofabrication cleanroom; quiet and ultra-quiet measurement labs; and the Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research (LASR).

==Notable accomplishments==
===Space sciences===
The Naval Research Laboratory has a long history of spacecraft development. This includes the second, fifth and seventh American satellites in Earth orbit, the first solar-powered satellite, the first surveillance satellite, the first meteorological satellite and the first GPS satellite. Project Vanguard, the first American satellite program, tasked NRL with the design, construction and launch of an artificial satellite, which was accomplished in 1958. , Vanguard I and its upper launch stage are still in orbit, making them the longest-lived man-made satellites. Vanguard II was the first satellite to observe the Earth&#x27;s cloud cover and therefore the first meteorological satellite. NRL&#x27;s Galactic Radiation and Background I (GRAB I) was the first U.S. intelligence satellite, mapping out Soviet radar networks from space. The Global Positioning System (GPS) was invented at NRL and tested by NRL&#x27;s Timation series of satellites. The first operational GPS satellite, Timation IV (NTS-II) was designed and constructed at NRL.

NRL pioneered the study of the sun Ultraviolet and X-Ray spectrum and continues to contribute to the field with satellites like Coriolis launched in 2003. NRL is also responsible for the Tactical Satellite Program with spacecraft launched in 2006, 2009 and 2011.

The NRL designed the first satellite tracking system, Minitrack, which became the prototype for future satellite tracking networks. Prior to the success of surveillance satellites, the iconic parabolic antenna atop NRL&#x27;s main headquarters in Washington, D.C. was part of Communication Moon Relay, a project that utilized signals bounced off the Moon both for long-distance communications research and surveillance of internal Soviet transmissions during the Cold War.

NRL&#x27;s spacecraft development program continues today with the TacSat-4 experimental tactical reconnaissance and communication satellite. In addition to spacecraft design, NRL designs and operates spaceborne research instruments and experiments, such as the Strontium Iodide Radiation Instrumentation (SIRI) and RAM Angle and Magnetic field sensor (RAMS) aboard STPSat-5, the Wide-field Imager for Solar PRobe (WISPR) aboard the Parker Solar Probe, and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). NASA&#x27;s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST) [formerly called Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST)] was tested at NRL spacecraft testing facilities. NRL scientists have most recently contributed leading research to the study of novas and gamma ray bursts.

===Meteorology===

The Marine Meteorology Division (Naval Research Lab–Monterey, NRL–MRY), located in Monterey, California, contributes to weather forecasting in the United States and around the world by publishing imagery from 18 weather satellites. Satellite images of severe weather (e.g. hurricanes and cyclones) that are used for advanced warning often originate from NRL–MRY, as seen in 2017 during Hurricane Harvey. NRL is also involved in weather forecasting models such as the Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model released in 2007.

===Materials science===

NRL has a long history of contributions to materials science, dating back to the use of Industrial radiography with gamma rays for the nondestructive inspection of metal casings and welds on Navy vessels beginning in the 1920s. Modern mechanical fracture mechanics were pioneered at NRL and were subsequently applied to solve fracture problems in Navy vessels, commercial aircraft and Polaris missiles. That knowledge is in widespread use today in applications ranging from design of nuclear reactors to aircraft, submarines and toxic material storage tanks.

NRL developed the synthesis of high-purity GaAs crystals used in a myriad of modern high frequency transceivers including cellular phones, satellite communication systems, commercial and military radar systems including those aboard all US combat aircraft and ARM, Phoenix, AIM-9L and AMRAAM missiles. NRL&#x27;s GaAs inventions were licensed by Rockwell, Westinghouse, Texas Instruments and Hughes Research. High-purity GaAs is also used for high-efficiency solar cells like those aboard NASA&#x27;s Spirit and Opportunity rovers currently on Mars.

NRL discovered solar-wind hydrogen in Apollo lunar soil samples provided by a NASA-funded research mission.

Fundamental aspects of stealth technology were developed at NRL, including the radar absorption mechanisms in ferrite-containing materials. Metal bearing surface treatments using Cr ion implantation researched at NRL nearly tripled the service life of Navy turbine engine parts and was adopted for Army helicopter parts as well. Fluorinated polyurethane coatings developed at NRL are used to line fuel storage tanks throughout the US Navy, reducing leakage and environmental and fuel contamination. The same polymer films are used in Los Angeles-class submarine radomes to repel water and enable radar operation soon after surfacing.

Scientists at NRL frequently contribute theoretical and experimental research on novel materials, particularly magnetic materials and nanomaterials and thermoplastic.

===Radar===
The first modern U.S. radar was invented and developed at NRL in Washington, DC in 1922. By 1939, NRL installed the first operational radar aboard the USS New York, in time for radar to contribute to naval victories of the Coral Sea, Midway and Guadalcanal. NRL then further developed over-the-horizon radar as well as radar data displays. NRL&#x27;s Radar Division continues important research &amp; development contributing to US Navy and US Department of Defense capabilities.

===Tactical electronic warfare===
NRL&#x27;s Tactical Electronic Warfare (TEW) Division is responsible for research and development in support of the Navy&#x27;s tactical electronic warfare requirements and missions. These include electronic warfare support measures, electronic countermeasures, and supporting counter-countermeasures, as well as studies, analyses, and simulations for determining and improving the performance of Electronic Warfare systems. NRL TEW includes aerial, surface, and ground EW within its scope. NRL is responsible for the identification, friend or foe (IFF) system and a number of other advances.

===Information security===
The &quot;Information Technology Division&quot; features an information security R&amp;D group, which is where the IETF&#x27;s IP Security (IPsec) protocols were originally developed. The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol developed at NRL is widely used for virtual private network (VPN) connections worldwide. The projects developed by the laboratory often become mainstream applications without public awareness of the developer; an example in computer science is onion routing, the core principle of the anonymizing Tor software.

===Nuclear research===
Nuclear power research was initiated at NRL as early as 1939, six years before the first atomic bomb, for the purpose of powering submarines. Uranium enrichment methods sponsored by NRL over the course of World War II were adopted by the Manhattan Project and guided the design of Oak Ridge National Laboratory&#x27;s Uranium enrichment plant. NRL is currently developing laser focusing techniques aimed at inertial confinement fusion technology.

===Physical sciences===
The static discharger seen on trailing edges of virtually all modern aircraft was originally developed by NRL scientists during World War II. After the war, the laboratory developed modern synthetic lubricants initially for use in the Navy&#x27;s jet aircraft but subsequently adopted by the commercial jet industry.

In the late 1960s, NRL researched low-temperature physics, achieving for the first time a temperature within one millionth of a degree of absolute zero in 1967. In 1985 two scientists at the laboratory, Herbert A. Hauptman and Jerome Karle, won the Nobel Prize for devising direct methods employing X-ray diffraction analysis in the determination of crystal structures. Their methods form the basis for the computer packages used in pharmaceutical labs and research institutions worldwide for the analysis of more than 10,000 new substances each year.

NRL has most recently published research on quantum computing, quantum dots, plasma shockwaves, thermodynamics of liquids, modeling of oil spills and other topics.

NRL operates a small squadron of research aircraft termed Scientific Development Squadron (VXS) 1. Its missions include, for example, Rampant Lion, which used sophisticated airborne instrumentation (gravimeters, magnetometers and hyperspectral cameras) to collect precise 3D topography of two-thirds of Afghanistan and locate natural resources (underground gas and mineral deposits, vegetation types, etc.) there and in Iraq and Colombia.

===Plasma science===
The Division of Plasma Physics conducts research and development into ionized matter. NRL currently holds the world record for most energetic rail gun projectile () and fastest man-made projectile ().

===Artificial intelligence===
NRL established the Navy Center for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence in 1981, which conducts basic and applied research in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, autonomy, and human-centered computing. Among its achievements are advances in cognitive architectures, human-robot interaction, and machine learning.

==Organization==

As of 2017, the laboratory was divided into four research directorates, one financial directorate, and one executive directorate. All the directorates are headquartered in Washington, D.C. Many directorates have other facilities elsewhere, primarily at either the &quot;Stennis Space Center&quot; in Bay St Louis, Mississippi or in Monterey, California.

===Staff===

Most NRL staff are civilians in the civil service, with a relatively small number of Navy enlisted personnel or officers. Virtually all NRL staff are US citizens and are not dual-nationals. In addition, there are some support contractors that work on-site at NRL. As of 31 December 2015, across all NRL locations, NRL had 2540 civilian employees (i.e., not including civilian contractors). On the same date, there were 35 military officers on-board NRL and 58 enlisted on-board NRL, most of whom are with NRL&#x27;s VXS-1 Scientific Flight Detachment, which is located at the Patuxent River (&#x27;Pax River&#x27;) Naval Air Station (NAS) in southern Maryland.

NRL has special authority to use a Pay-Band pay system instead of using the traditional &quot;General Schedule (GS)&quot; pay system for its civilian employees. This gives NRL more ability to pay employees based on performance and merit, rather than time-in-grade or some other seniority metric. There are several different pay-band groups at NRL, each being for different categories of civilian employees. As of 31 December 2015, NRL had 1615 civilian scientists/engineers in the &quot;NP&quot; pay system, 103 civilian technicians in the &quot;NR&quot; pay system, 383 civilian administrative specialists/professionals in the &quot;NO&quot; pay system, and 238 civilian administrative support staff in the &quot;NC&quot; pay system.

NRL scientists &amp; engineers typically are in the &quot;(NP)&quot; pay group in NRL&#x27;s Pay Band system. The NP-II pay band is equivalent to GS-5 Step 1 through GS-10 Step 10. The NP-III pay band is equivalent to GS-11 Step 1 through GS-13 Step 10. NRL&#x27;s &quot;Pay Band IV&quot; corresponds to the GS-14 Step 1 to GS-15 Step 10 pay grades, inclusive, while NRL&#x27;s Pay Band V can pay above GS-15 Step 10 and corresponds to the &quot;Senior Technologist (ST)&quot; pay grade elsewhere in the civil service.

For new graduates, someone with a Bachelor of Science degree typically is hired at a salary in the GS-7 range; someone with a Master of Science degree typically is hired at a salary in the GS-11 range; someone with a PhD typically is hired at a salary in the GS-12 range. NRL has the flexibility to offer partial student loan repayments for new hires.

According to the NRL Fact Book (2016), of NRL civilian full-time permanent employees, 870 had a doctorate, 417 had a master&#x27;s, and 576 had a bachelor&#x27;s as their highest degree.

The laboratory also hosts post-doctoral researchers and was voted #15 in the Best Places to Work PostDocs 2013 survey.

===Research directorates===
The four research directorates within NRL were:
* The Systems Directorate (Code 5000) is responsible for performing a range of activities from basic research through engineering development to expand the operational capabilities of the US Navy. There are four research divisions: Radar, Information Technology, Optical Sciences, and Tactical Electronic Warfare.
* The Materials Science and Component Technology Directorate (Code 6000) carries out a range of materials research with the aim of better understanding of the materials in order to develop improved and advanced materials for use by the US Navy. There are seven research divisions: Laboratory for the Structure of Matter, Chemistry, Material Science &amp; Technology, Laboratory for Computational Physics and Fluid Dynamics, Plasma Physics, Electronics Science &amp; Technology, and the Center for Biomolecular Science &amp; Engineering.
* The Ocean and Atmospheric Science and Technology Directorate (Code 7000) performs research in the fields of acoustics, remote sensing, oceanography, marine geosciences, marine meteorology, and space science. There are six research divisions: Acoustics, Remote Sensing, Oceanography, Marine Geosciences, Marine Meteorology, and Space Science.
* The Naval Center for Space Technology (Code 8000) is a focal point and integrator for NRL technologies used in space systems. It provides system engineering and technical assistance for development and acquisition of space systems. There are two research departments: Space Systems Development and Spacecraft Engineering.

===Support directorates===

The two support directorates were:
* The Executive Directorate operations are directed by the Commander of the NRL, who typically is a US Navy Captain. Scientific Development Squadron ONE (VXS-1), located at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, which provides airborne research facilities to NRL and other agencies of the US Government, is run out of the Executive Directorate.
* The Business Operations Directorate provides program management for the business programs which support the scientific directorates of NRL. It provides contracting, financial management and supply expertise to the scientific projects.

===Nanoscience Institute===
In April 2001, in a departure from traditional working relationships between NRL scientists, the Institute for Nanoscience was established to conduct multidisciplinary research in the fields of materials, electronics and biology. Scientists may be part of the Nanoscience Institute while still performing research for their respective divisions.
===Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research===
Opened March 2012, the Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research (LASR) is a 50,000 square foot facility that supports basic and applied research in autonomous systems. The facility supports a wide range of interdisciplinary basic and applied research in autonomous systems to include research in autonomous systems, intelligent autonomy, human-autonomous system interaction and collaboration, sensor systems, power and energy systems, networking and communications, and platforms.

LASR provides unique facilities and simulated environmental high bays (littoral, desert, tropical, and forest) and instrumented reconfigurable high bay spaces to support integration of science and technology components into research prototype systems.

==Locations==
The main campus of NRL is in Washington, D.C., near the southernmost part of the District. It is on the Potomac River and is immediately south of (but is not part of) Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. This campus is immediately north of the Blue Plains site of the DC Water Authority. Exit 1 of northbound I-295 leads directly to Overlook Avenue and the NRL Main Gate. The U.S. Postal Service operates a post office on the NRL main campus.

In addition, NRL operates several field sites and satellite facilities:
* NRL-South is located at NASA&#x27;s Stennis Space Center in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and specializes in oceanography, marine geology, geophysics, geoacoustics, and geotechnology.
* NRL-Monterey is located east of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, sharing a campus with the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center and the San Francisco Bay Area/Monterey local forecast office of the National Weather Service. NRL-Monterey is dedicated to meteorology and atmospheric research.
* The Scientific Development Squadron (VXS) 1 is located at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Lexington Park, Maryland, and operates a wide range of research aircraft.
* The Chesapeake Bay Detachment (CBD) in Chesapeake Beach, Maryland is 168-acre site for research in radar, electronic warfare, optical devices, materials, communications, and fire research. This facility is often used in combination with the Multiple Research Site on Tilghman Island, Maryland just across the Chesapeake Bay.
* The Midway Research Center in Quantico, Virginia, Free Space Antenna Range in Pomonkey, Maryland, and Blossom Point Satellite Tracking and Command Station in Blossom Point, Maryland are used by NRL&#x27;s Naval Center for Space Technology.
* The Marine Corrosion Facility located on Fleming Key at Naval Air Station Key West in Florida is used by the Center for Corrosion Science &amp; Engineering.
* NRL operates several synchrotron radiation beamlines and the Extreme-Ultraviolet and X-Ray Calibration Facility at the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.

==History==

===Early history===
Artifacts found on the NRL campus, such as stone tools and ceramic shards, show that the site had been inhabited since the Late Archaic Period. Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, granted the tract of land which includes the present NRL campus to William Middleton in 1663. It became part of the District of Columbia in 1791, and was purchased by Thomas Grafton Addison in 1795, who named the area Bellevue and built a mansion on the highlands to the east.

Zachariah Berry purchased the land in 1827, who rented it out for various purposes including a fishery at Blue Plains. The mansion was demolished during the Civil War to build Fort Greble. In 1873 the land was purchased by the federal government as the Bellevue Annex to the Naval Gun Factory, and several buildings were constructed including the Commandant&#x27;s house, &quot;Quarters A&quot;, which is still in use today.

===Foundation===
The &quot;Naval Research Laboratory&quot; came into existence from an idea that originated from Thomas Edison. In a May 1915 editorial piece in the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot;, Edison wrote; &quot;The Government should maintain a great research laboratory... In this could be developed...all the technique of military and naval progression without any vast expense.&quot; This statement addressed concerns about World War I in the United States.

Edison then agreed to serve as the head of the Naval Consulting Board that consisted of civilians who had achieved expertise. The focus of the Naval Consulting Board was as advisor to the U.S. Navy pertaining to science and technology. The board brought forward a plan to create a modern facility for the Navy. In 1916 Congress allocated $1.5 million for implementation. However, construction was delayed until 1920 because of the war and internal disagreements within the board.

The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, the first modern research institution created within the United States Navy, began operations at 1100 on 2 July 1923. The Laboratory&#x27;s two original divisions – Radio and Sound – performed research in the fields of high-frequency radio and underwater sound propagation. They produced communications equipment, direction-finding devices, sonar sets, and the first practical radar equipment built in the United States. They performed basic research, participating in the discovery and early exploration of the ionosphere. The NRL gradually worked towards its goal of becoming a broadly based research facility. By the beginning of World War II, five new divisions had been added: Physical Optics, Chemistry, Metallurgy, Mechanics and Electricity, and Internal Communications.

===World War II years and growth===
Total employment at the NRL jumped from 396 in 1941 to 4400 in 1946, expenditures from $1.7 million to $13.7 million, the number of buildings from 23 to 67, and the number of projects from 200 to about 900. During World War II, scientific activities necessarily were concentrated almost entirely on applied research. Advances were made in radio, radar, and sonar. Countermeasures were devised. New lubricants were produced, as were antifouling paints, luminous identification tapes, and a marking dye to help locate survivors of disasters at sea. A thermal diffusion process was conceived and used to supply some of the U-235 isotope needed for one of the first atomic bombs. Also, many new devices that developed from booming wartime industry were type tested and then certified as reliable for the Fleet.

===After WWII===
As a result of the scientific accomplishments of the WWII, the United States emerged into the postwar era determined to consolidate its wartime gains in science and technology and to preserve the working relationship between its armed forces and the scientific community. While the Navy was establishing the Office of Naval Research (ONR) in 1946 as a liaison with and supporter of basic and applied scientific research, the Navy encouraged NRL to broaden its scope since it was the Navy Department&#x27;s corporate research laboratory. NRL was placed under the administrative oversight of ONR after ONR was created. NRL&#x27;s Commanding Officer reports to the Navy&#x27;s &quot;Chief of Naval Research (CNR)&quot;. The Chief of Naval Research leads the Office of Naval Research, which primarily is located in the Ballston area of Arlington, Virginia. The reorganization also caused a parallel shift of the Laboratory&#x27;s emphasis to one of long-range basic and applied research in the full range of the physical sciences.

However, rapid expansion during the war had left NRL improperly structured to address long-term Navy requirements. One major task – neither easily nor rapidly accomplished – was that of reshaping and coordinating research. This was achieved by transforming a group of largely autonomous scientific divisions into a unified institution with a clear mission and a fully coordinated research program. The first attempt at reorganization vested power in an executive committee composed of all the division superintendents. This committee was impracticably large, so in 1949, a civilian director of research was named and given full authority over the program. Positions for associate directors were added in 1954.

===Modern era===
In 1992, the previously separate &quot;Naval Oceanographic and Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NOARL)&quot;, with centers in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and Monterey, California, was merged into NRL. Since then, NRL is also the lead Navy center for research in Oceanographic and Atmospheric Sciences, with special strengths in physical oceanography, marine geosciences, ocean acoustics, marine meteorology, and remote oceanic and atmospheric sensing.

===Centennial===

Commissioned July 2, 1923, as the Naval Experimental and Research Laboratory — later shortened to the Naval Research Laboratory (c.1926) — the laboratory began operations seven years after inventor Thomas Edison suggested that the Government establish &quot;a great research laboratory.&quot;

Throughout the past century, NRL has changed the way the U.S. military fights, improved its capabilities, prevented technological surprise, transferred vital technology to industry, and tilted the world’s balance of power on at least three occasions; with the first U.S. radar, world’s first intelligence satellite, and first operational satellite of the Global Positioning System (GPS).

July 2, 2023, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory celebrates 100 years of service as the Navy&#x27;s corporate laboratory with a rich history of performing advanced scientific research and making significant contributions to U.S. military forces on, under, and above the seas.

==Environmental contamination==
The Navy’s environmental investigations began in 1984. NRL was not listed on the National Priorities List as a Superfund and the Maryland Department of the Environment has regulatory oversight. Since the early 2010s, the Navy and MDE have coordinated their activities at NR. In 2017 groundwater investigation PFAS were present on-base in the shallow aquifer. As of 2022, there are 6 active IRP sites (Photo-processing Waste Discharge, fire testing area etc) and 3 active munition response sites at former small arms ranges with lead contamination in the Chesapeake Bay Detachment. An online Restoration Advisory Board (RAB) meeting in May 2021 alarmed residents because of extremely high PFAS levels in the soil at the CBD&#x27;s fire training facility.

<doc id="411900" wikidata="Q609189" url="?curid=411900" title="Jesse Jackson Jr.">
<text>Jesse Louis Jackson Jr. (born March 11, 1965) is an American politician. He served as the U.S. representative from from 1995 until his resignation in 2012. A member of the Democratic Party, he is the son of activist and former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson and, prior to his career in elected office, worked for his father in both the elder Jackson&#x27;s 1984 presidential campaign and his social justice, civil rights and political activism organization, Operation PUSH. Jackson&#x27;s then-wife, Sandi Jackson, served on the Chicago City Council. He served as a national co-chairman of the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign. Jackson established a consistent liberal record on both social and fiscal issues, and he has co-authored books on civil rights and personal finance.

In October 2012, Jackson was investigated for financial improprieties including misuse of campaign funds. Jackson resigned from Congress on November 21, 2012, citing mental and physical health problems, including bipolar disorder and gastrointestinal problems. On February 8, 2013, Jackson admitted to violating federal campaign law by using campaign funds to make personal purchases. Jackson pleaded guilty on February 20, 2013, to one count of wire and mail fraud. On August 14, 2013, he was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison. Jackson was released from prison on March 26, 2015. Jackson and other Democratic Chicago leaders asked President Biden for Jackson to be given a pardon at the end of 2024. 

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Jackson was born in Greenville, South Carolina, and was raised in the Jackson Park Highlands District of the South Shore community area on the South Side of Chicago. He was one of five children of Jesse and Jacqueline (Brown) Jackson. He attended nursery school at the University of Chicago and attended John J. Pershing Elementary School. At age five, Jackson mimicked his father in a speech atop a milk crate at the Operation PUSH headquarters. His time with his father sometimes occurred in the time between political meetings.

He and his brother Jonathan were sent to Le Mans Academy in Rolling Prairie, Indiana after Jackson was diagnosed as hyperactive. As a young cadet, he was paddled at times for disciplinary reasons. During his tenure there, he earned the rank of Company Commander. Jackson repeated ninth grade and was suspended from school twice. Jackson graduated from St. Albans School. He was an all-state running back on his football team in high school and was featured in the February 1984 issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as part of their Faces in the Crowd section, which noted him for his 15 touchdowns, 889 rushing yards, and 7.2 yards per carry in six games. Jackson enrolled in North Carolina A&amp;T University, his father&#x27;s alma mater, earning his Bachelor of Science degree &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1987. He decided to follow his father&#x27;s advice to receive a seminary education at the Chicago Theological Seminary, where he earned his master&#x27;s degree a year early but opted not to become ordained. Jackson proceeded to law school at the University of Illinois and convinced his future wife to transfer there from the Georgetown University Law Center. He then earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Illinois College of Law in 1993. Jackson never sat for the bar exam despite finishing his coursework a semester early.

As a teenager, Jackson and his brother Jonathan assisted in their father&#x27;s civil rights activities. During the 1984 Democratic primaries, the three Jackson brothers sometimes appeared at events together in support of their father&#x27;s presidential campaign. While in college, Jackson held a voter registration drive that registered 3,500 voters on a campus with 4,500 students. His first job after graduation was as an executive director for the Rainbow Coalition.

Jackson was again involved in his father&#x27;s campaigning during the 1988 Democratic primaries. In 1988, in the dealings between his father and Michael Dukakis at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, Jackson&#x27;s father obtained for him a position as an at-large member of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) by a nomination from Democratic Party chairman Paul Kirk. Jackson Jr. was the last of the five children to speak and introduced his father with the words &quot;a man who fights against the odds, who lives against the odds, our dad, Jesse Jackson.&quot; At the time, in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Margaret Carlson depicted the younger Jackson as a well-spoken and compelling personality who would likely carry any of his father&#x27;s political aspirations that his father was unable to achieve himself. His experience with the DNC gave him the opportunity to work on numerous congressional election races. After the convention he also became a vice president of Operation PUSH.

Jackson was arrested on his twenty-first birthday in Washington, D.C., following his participation in demonstrations against apartheid at the South African Embassy. He had been arrested with his father and brother the year before in a similar activity. His protest against apartheid extended to weekly demonstrations in front of the South African Consulate in Chicago. Jackson shared the stage with Nelson Mandela when Mandela made his historic speech following his release from a 27-year imprisonment in Cape Town in February 1990. Before entering the House, he became secretary of the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s Black Caucus, the national field director of the National Rainbow Coalition and a member of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. Jackson served as the national field director of the Rainbow Coalition from 1993 to 1995. Under Jackson&#x27;s leadership, the Rainbow Coalition attempted to stimulate equitable hiring in the National Basketball Association because while 78% of the league&#x27;s players were African American, 92% of the front-office executive positions, 88% of the administrative jobs, and 85% of the support positions were held by whites. While serving as the field director for the National Rainbow Coalition, he helped register millions of new voters through a newly instituted national non-partisan program. He also created a voter education program to teach citizens the importance of participating in the political process. He was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and also a founding board member of the Apollo Alliance.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Jackson&#x27;s wife wanted him to run for the 2nd District Congressional seat in the 1996 primary election, while his father wanted him to run for a position as an alderman or for the Illinois General Assembly. The 2nd District includes part of Chicago&#x27;s southeast suburbs known as the Southland and part of the South Side. Jackson&#x27;s father approached state Sen. Alice J. Palmer with a deal in which the Jacksons would support her for Congress in exchange for her support for Jackson for the Illinois Senate. Jackson Jr. did not agree with the plan and wanted to run for the 2nd District seat. After seeking approval from former Democratic National Committee chairman David Wilhelm, he decided to run for the seat against Palmer. When Mel Reynolds, who was later convicted on sexual misconduct charges, resigned from Congress on September 1, 1995, Jackson&#x27;s name surfaced as a potential replacement; on September 10, 1995, Jackson officially declared his candidacy. Jackson&#x27;s opponents in the Democratic primary were Palmer, Emil Jones, Monique Davis, and John Morrow in the Democratic primary, which was set for November 29, 1995. Jones was endorsed by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. Jackson was endorsed by the &quot;Daily Southtown&quot;, Markham Mayor Evans Miller, and one local labor organization. Campaign controversy arose when it was revealed that Jackson&#x27;s salary as field director the Rainbow Coalition had been subsidized by the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, which was accused by a U.S. Senate investigative committee of having ties to organized crime. Jackson was one of several Democrats who received campaign contributions from John Huang, a Democratic fundraiser who illegally funneled over $150,000 to Democratic candidates and was later convicted of conspiracy to commit campaign finance fraud. While most other recipients of the Huang-aggregated funds returned them or donated them elsewhere, Jackson kept the money, saying Huang&#x27;s $1,000 contribution to his campaign was within legal limits.

Jackson won the Democratic primary with 48% of the vote to Jones&#x27;s 39%, with the rest of the votes scattered among the other three candidates. The Republicans nominated Thomas Somer. Since the district was overwhelmingly Democratic, Jackson was the favorite for the December 12, 1995 special election. Jackson won the general election with 76% of the vote; his victory was widely anticipated. Upon his victory, Jackson made it known he would be a liberal voice in opposition to Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich. He took office on December 15, 1995. Jackson was perceived as less charismatic than his father and less credentialed than his predecessor, but his family pedigree was expected to help him politically. In August 1996, Somer withdrew from a rematch leaving Jackson with no major party opposition in the November 1996 general election. As a result, Jackson received 94% of the vote in the general election.

As he prepared to run for president in 2000, Vice President Al Gore attempted to maintain good relations with the Jackson family, hoping to discourage Jackson&#x27;s father from running for president against him. Jackson received a congratulatory call from Gore after his election in 1995. In 1998, Gore campaigned for and advised Jackson, and went out of his way to instruct aides to create a vice presidential event in Jackson&#x27;s district to boost Jackson.

The 2nd District was overwhelmingly black when Jackson was first elected and remained so after the redistricting process following the 2000 Census. Jackson won re-election in 2000 by a 90–10 margin over Robert Gordon.

In 2001, the Federal Election Commission ruled that Jackson could hire his wife on his campaign payroll as long as she was paid no more than the fair market value for her services. In 2002, Jackson was challenged in the Democratic primary by three candidates. Jackson claimed that state Sen. William Shaw and his brother, Cook County Board of Review Commissioner Robert Shaw, had planted a bogus candidate in the primary race. The claim was that they selected 68-year-old retired Robbins truck driver, Jesse L. Jackson, as an opponent in order to confuse voters and derail the congressman&#x27;s re-election campaign. Jackson asked a Cook County court to question the Shaws and others under oath, but his effort was rejected and no criminal wrongdoing was found. As Jackson prepared to take further legal action, Jesse L. Jackson withdrew his candidacy after the unexpected deaths of his wife and grandson.
Jackson won re-election in the 2004 House of Representatives elections by a wide margin over Stephanie Kennedy Sailor. In 2005, Jackson supported legislation that gave the United States Federal Court of Appeals jurisdiction over the Terri Schiavo case. In the 2006 election among Jackson&#x27;s opponents was Libertarian Party candidate and African-American pastor Anthony Williams, an outspoken opponent of immigration. Jackson won with 85% of the vote.

===Tenure===
Jackson quickly built a track record of never missing a floor vote. Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother&#x27;s funeral for a roll call, but the presiding officer was able to slightly delay the closing of the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. Fellow Democrats said he debates and votes with a contentiousness that makes it difficult to view him as a team player. Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who had a hand in several attempts to block Jackson&#x27;s seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport. Jackson has also been a target of conservative media figures. Jackson established a heavily liberal voting record on both social and fiscal issues. During the 1990s, because of his name recognition and liberal track record, Jackson received many public speaking and media requests.

After being elected, Jackson attempted to parlay his popularity into a seat on the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, using the leverage of his ability to perform voter registration drives. In the 1996 elections, Jackson began to rival his father as a requested visitor to congressional districts with 36 requests from congressional colleagues. He was typically sent on the &quot;black circuit&quot; without any notification to the press when he campaigned for other candidates. Jackson made 30 appearances for Democratic congressional candidates in 1998.

Jackson had some controversial interactions with Jewish leaders in his early years in office. In 1996, his message of unity and cooperation with the Jews was met with skepticism. In 1997, Jackson was criticized for offering mere disagreement with anti-Semitic remarks made by Louis Farrakhan while he was in New York City for the mayoral race; Jewish leaders were unsatisfied by Jackson&#x27;s response to Farrakhan. In 1997, &quot;Newsweek&quot; mentioned Jackson in their list of 100 people to watch in the new century, dubbed &quot;the Century Club&quot;, and raised the question of whether he would be the first black president. Jackson criticized the Bill Clinton administration for working with Republicans and voted in dissent on several notable bills that were the products of compromise between Democrats and Republicans. Jackson preferred direct aid and debt relief to trade reform as a method of helping impoverished nations such as those of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin, fearing that relaxed trade regulations would possibly benefit corporations and exploit labor. He is also an opponent of incentives for corporations to invest in developing nations. He was outspoken on issues of minority hiring in information technology. Jackson voted against the impeachment of Bill Clinton, voting against all four articles of impeachment considered by the House.

In late 2000, as word spread that President-elect George W. Bush intended to appoint both Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and a third unnamed black to the United States Cabinet, Jackson sought to prevent blacks from supporting Bush as Bush planned to reach out to blacks. Jackson partnered with Republican Henry Hyde to push for a third Chicago airport. Jackson said Hyde was the right wing complement to his own left wing role in pursuing support for the airport. Jackson has withheld support for local Democrats who would not support the airport, such as 1998 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Glenn Poshard.

On January 6, 2001, Jackson and other members of the House of Representatives objected to counting the 25 electoral votes from Florida which George W. Bush narrowly won after a contentious recount. Because no senator joined his objection, the objection was dismissed by Vice President Al Gore, who was Bush&#x27;s opponent in the 2000 presidential election.

In 2004, Jackson supported the Ho-Chunk tribe&#x27;s proposal for a casino within his district in Lynwood, Illinois. The proposal was to build the largest casino in the state as part of an entertainment complex. In 2005, Jackson sponsored a bill for the creation and acquisition of a life-size statue of Rosa Parks to be placed in Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol. The bill approving the funding for the statue was signed by President Bush on December 1, 2005.

After the 2004 elections, Jackson became vocal in supporting election reform, disliking the way election rules differ across jurisdictions, saying that the U.S. &quot;is founded on the constitutional foundation of &#x27;states&#x27; rights&#x27;—50 states, 3,067 counties and 13,000 different election jurisdictions, all separate and unequal.&quot; He was one of the 31 House Democrats who voted to not count the 20 electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election, despite Republican President George Bush winning the state by 118,457 votes. He also proposed legislation for uniform voting standards that was supported by black leaders.

Jackson and Zach Wamp were spokespersons for the changing the name of the main hall of the United States Capitol Visitor Center from the Great Hall to Emancipation Hall. The Library of Congress&#x27;s main hall was already designated Great Hall. Some had wanted further feedback on naming possibilities, but the United States House Committee on Appropriations approved the new name, and it passed the House.

Jackson was one of the liberal leaders who supported a fixed timetable for Iraq troop withdrawals. In 2007, he has also co-sponsored (along with Roy Blunt), legislation providing nearly $1 million to each family that lost someone to the al-Qaida activities in the 1998 United States embassy bombings. In 2007 Jackson voiced an interest in initiating impeachment proceedings against President Bush for &quot;crimes against the Constitution of the United States.&quot;

In March 2011, Jackson attracted ridicule for a speech he made on the House floor proposing a constitutional amendment for &quot;equal education rights&quot;, which he illustrated by proposing that every student in America receive an iPad from the federal government. In April 2011, Jackson spoke on the house floor, blaming the iPad for &quot;eliminating thousands of American jobs.&quot; In the February 27, 2007 Chicago municipal elections, Jackson&#x27;s wife, Sandi Jackson, won the election for Alderman in Chicago&#x27;s 7th ward.
Jackson gave a prime-time speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 25, 2008. During his speech he referenced Martin Luther King Jr., stating, &quot;I&#x27;m sure that Dr. King is looking down on us here in Denver noting this is the first political convention in history to take place within sight of a mountain top.&quot; Jackson said, &quot;I know Barack Obama. I&#x27;ve seen his leadership at work. I&#x27;ve seen the difference he has made in the lives of people across Illinois.&quot; At the convention, Jackson started what was described as a &quot;hugfest&quot; in an attempt to unite the Illinois Democratic party, which had been squabbling internally. He started by hugging Bobby Rush (who had been upset that Jackson&#x27;s wife was being positioned for Rush&#x27;s seat when Rush had been ill earlier in the year) and then he hugged Debbie Halvorson, who had been at odds with him over the proposed airport. He then asked if anyone else was mad at him. At this point Mayor Daley jumped up to hug Jackson. Jackson then said, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to be satisfied until I see Rod Blagojevich give Mike Madigan a hug.&quot;

Before the entire Congress was charged with seeking a solution to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and overall economic crisis of 2008, Jackson proposed that the United States Department of Agriculture increase the allotment of food stamps. During the congressional debates on a federal bailout, Jackson worried about the viability of various plan iterations to his constituents. Although only two years earlier he spoke of Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in glowing terms, he could not support the late-September version of the legislation she was proposing because he felt it contained inadequate homeowner protections. Although he voted against the bill on September 29, 2008 he voted in support of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 on October 3, 2008. He later expressed concerns in a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed article about the implications that the eventual bill had on enfranchisement due to the lack of protections for homeowners as it relates to voting rights. Jackson sponsored legislation to make the Pullman District a National Park Service jurisdiction. On April 21, 2012, Jackson held a symbolic groundbreaking for the proposed third airport.

====Committee assignments====
*Committee on Appropriations
**Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies
**Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs

Jackson was also appointed to the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission in 2003. He was among the scholars and politicians adding commentaries to &quot;Lincoln in Illinois&quot; which was published by the Abraham Lincoln Association and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation. The book had been expected in the fall but was published in June 2008.

===Health issues, criminal investigation, and resignation===
On June 10, 2012, Jackson took a medical leave of absence from the House, citing exhaustion. On July 11, 2012, Jackson&#x27;s office said he was being treated for a mood disorder at a residential treatment facility. His office denied speculation that he was being treated for alcoholism. On August 13, 2012, it was confirmed by numerous news outlets that Jackson was being treated for bipolar disorder.

==Campaign fraud==
In October 2012, federal prosecutors and FBI agents in Washington, D.C., investigated Jackson for alleged financial improprieties, including possible misuse of campaign funds. Sixteen days after being re-elected to another term, Jackson resigned effective on November 21, 2012, citing his health problems and acknowledging the ethics investigations.

Jackson and wife Sandi signed plea agreements in early February 2013. Jackson Jr. agreed to plead guilty to charges of fraud, conspiracy, making false statements, mail fraud, wire fraud, and criminal forfeiture—having used about $750,000 in campaign money for over 3000 personal purchases that included a Michael Jackson fedora and cashmere capes.

The Justice Department filed the charges on February 15, 2013, and Jackson pleaded guilty on February 20, 2013, to one count of wire and mail fraud in connection with his misuse of $750,000 of campaign funds. On June 7, 2013, federal prosecutors indicated that they sought a four-year prison sentence for Jackson. On August 14, 2013, Jackson was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison, while wife Sandi was sentenced to 12 months in prison for filing false tax returns in an attempt to conceal the crimes. Their sentences were not concurrent; Jackson served his, and after his release she served hers. The staggered sentences allowed for the Jackson children to have access to one parent during the time the other was in prison.

===Prison and release===
On October 26, 2013, Jackson reported to the Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, near Raleigh, North Carolina, to begin serving his sentence.

On March 26, 2015, Jackson was released from the minimum-security Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery in Montgomery, Alabama, to serve the rest of his sentence at a halfway house (the Volunteers of America Chesapeake facility in Baltimore, Maryland). After being released, Jackson was required to complete another three years on supervised release and perform 500 hours of community service. He was released in the morning of June 22, 2015, after spending three months serving his remaining sentence in a halfway house.

==Other political activities==

===2000 presidential election===
Jackson reluctantly supported Al Gore when he became the Democratic presidential nominee, saying Gore and his running mate Joe Lieberman were not liberal enough but that he supported Gore as the only alternative to George W. Bush. Jackson criticized Lieberman and the campaign for emphasizing the importance of personal morality in American politicians. Nevertheless, Jackson indicated he would persuade liberal voters unenthusiastic about Gore to support the Democratic ticket, rather than Green Party nominee Ralph Nader.

Despite his criticism of the Gore campaign, Jackson was still mentioned as a possible appointee for United States Secretary of Education if Gore was elected.

===2007 mayoral election===
Chicago is the largest American city without mayoral term limits, and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley started his mayoral tenure in 1989. Jackson held press conferences less frequently than his father. After making a formal announcement in 2006 with a press conference, Jackson was considered a strong potential candidate to oppose Daley in the municipal election on February 27, 2007. He stated on September 7, 2006, that his final decision would come after the Congressional election in November. Jackson had built up a more moderate reputation than his father and had support that transcended racial lines. Jackson viewed his broad based support as a sign that the U.S. had advanced to the point where politicians from ethnic minorities could appeal to broad constituencies.

After more than a decade in the national political spotlight he had maintained an untarnished image, unlike his troubled 2nd district predecessors Mel Reynolds and Gus Savage, and had challenged Daley on several issues on the local political scene. Jackson supported the living wage legislation that had been hotly contested in the Chicago City Council, and he has been an ardent backer of the long-proposed third Chicago airport in Peotone, Illinois, placing him at odds with Daley on both issues. He also railed against Daley over a trucking contract scandal involving city workers&#x27; collecting payoffs. At the time, the Mayor had recently exercised the first veto in his seventeen-year mayoral term to thwart a big box retailer city minimum wage bill from the City Council despite the bill&#x27;s public popularity.

There were always doubts about the seriousness of Jackson&#x27;s interest in the Mayor&#x27;s office. On November 8, 2006, Jackson reported that he would not pursue a 2007 mayoral campaign in Chicago:

===Support for Barack Obama===
Jackson was speculated as a potential candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004, but declined to run and instead became one of Barack Obama&#x27;s early supporters. He endorsed Howard Dean for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, joining Al Gore in saying Dean was the most likely candidate in the primary to beat Bush. The endorsement was a bitter blow to the hopes of candidate Al Sharpton, who had hoped for endorsements from both Jackson and his father.

Jackson was a national co-chairman of Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. As such, he is involved in garnering support from the superdelegates. During the campaign, he provided the voice for some advertisements such as one South Carolina radio ad in which he said: &quot;Once, South Carolina voted for my father, and sent a strong message to the nation, ... Next year, you can send more than a message. You can launch a president.&#x27;&quot; When describing Obama, he stated that &quot;Barack Obama is not speaking as a friend of the community; he&#x27;s part of the community ... He doesn&#x27;t always tell people what they want to hear. He tells them what they need to hear.&#x27;&quot; During the campaign, he described Obama as the first &quot;successor&quot; of Martin Luther King Jr. to use the thoughtful and careful approach to language to frame social debate in a way that is unlikely to alienate whites and noted his ability to get various factions to agree with him and his political positions.

Jackson had a lengthy relationship with Obama. Obama&#x27;s Illinois State Senate 13th district that he served from 1997 to 2005 was within Jackson&#x27;s district. Jackson&#x27;s sister Santita was a close friend of Michelle Obama and served as a bridesmaid at the Obama wedding. In 2008, Jackson&#x27;s father, Jesse Jackson, wrote an op-ed in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; attacking presidential candidate Obama for his lack of activist involvement; Jackson Junior responded sharply in the same paper with a defense of Obama.

On July 6, 2008, Jackson&#x27;s father said he thought Obama talks down to black people, and unaware he was near a live microphone offhandedly commented that he would like to &quot;cut [Obama&#x27;s] nuts off&quot;. Jackson Junior quickly expressed his outrage at and disappointment in his father&#x27;s &quot;ugly rhetoric&quot;. Jackson&#x27;s father said he was expressing his disappointment in Obama&#x27;s Father&#x27;s Day speech chastisement of Black fathers.

===2009 U.S. Senate seat===
Jackson emerged as a possible candidate to replace Barack Obama, who, after being elected President of the United States on November 4, 2008, officially resigned his seat in the U.S. Senate effective November 16. The class 3 Illinois Senate seat was up for re-election in 2010. Other contenders included Danny Davis, Jan Schakowsky, Tammy Duckworth, Emil Jones Jr., Kwame Raoul, Dan Hynes, and Lisa Madigan, while other sources also mentioned Luis Gutierrez and Melissa Bean. One early name mentioned, Valerie Jarrett, withdrew her name from consideration and both Davis and Duckworth noted that they had not been contacted by the governor&#x27;s office by the time Obama announced his resignation on November 13, 2008. In a radio interview on the subject, Jackson cited his record on federal funding for his district, loyalty to Obama and diligence in voting in the U.S. House. At the time, Obama was the only black U.S. Senator, and black leaders pressured Blagojevich to appoint a black successor. The &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; and &quot;Southtown Star&quot; both endorsed Jackson, who noted that public opinion polls show him as the favorite. The selection was coming at a time when the Governor&#x27;s public approval ratings were at an all-time low, which added to the pressure for him to make a selection that would be good for his own political perception, and it was believed that Jackson&#x27;s constituency was one that the Governor might need to appease. Although Obama and Duckworth laid a wreath together on Veterans Day, Obama did not endorse a successor. However, in an internal report filed by Obama legal advisor Greg Craig, &quot;Obama authorized Emanuel to pass on the names of four people he considered to be highly qualified to take over his seat – Illinois Comptroller Dan Hynes, Illinois Veterans&#x27; Affairs Director Tammy Duckworth, Rep. Jan Schakowsky and Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.&quot;

On November 27, 2008, Blagojevich hinted that Davis might be his choice. On December 6, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that Jackson was among the minority of potential candidates who had not been granted a meeting with Blagojevich on the subject, but two days later Blagojevich granted Jackson a meeting. On December 9, the day after a 90-minute meeting that Jackson described as his first meeting with Blagojevich in years, the Rod Blagojevich federal corruption scandal became public when the Governor was arrested. On December 10, Jackson was contacted by federal prosecutors for questioning with regard to the scandal involving Governor Blagojevich&#x27;s search for a replacement. The press speculated that Jackson was &quot;Senate Candidate #5&quot;, for whom it is alleged by Blagojevich that emissaries offered up to a million dollars in exchange for the appointment. Jackson, however, denies any wrongdoing, and says that the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office assured him that he is not a target of the investigation. In a press conference, his lawyer confirmed his belief that Jackson is candidate No. 5, but asserted that he has done nothing wrong. Immediately thereafter, in his own news conference, Jackson confirmed that he is a subject and not a target of the investigation and emphatically stated his opposition to &quot;pay to play&quot; politics. On December 16, a Jackson spokesperson confirmed special federal investigators have been questioning him since the summer. Also WLS-TV reported December 15 that Jackson has notified investigators that Blagojevich refused to appoint Sandi Jackson, his wife, as state lottery director because Jackson refused to donate $25,000 to the governor&#x27;s campaign fund. Jackson spokesman Kenneth Edmonds clarified that although Jackson had been a federal informant for over a decade, never did his cooperation concern the current investigation into the Senate seat.

Although Blagojevich&#x27;s corruption was reported to have been under federal investigation, journalist Howard Fineman of the Huffington Post allegedly has sources that claim Jackson attributes the Obama replacement case to Obama&#x27;s neutral stance. According to Fineman&#x27;s reported source, Jackson felt if Obama had endorsed him, Blagojevich would have selected Jackson. When the scandal first broke, the reaction was that Jackson&#x27;s reputation was sullied to the point that his viability as a senatorial candidate was diminished. However, reports that Jackson has been a longtime federal information provider has led political allies to continue to speak of his viability as a candidate. After much controversy, Roland Burris was successfully nominated by Blagojevich.

In 2009, Jackson was named one of the 15 most corrupt members of Congress by the liberal Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington for his role in the scandal. On September 21, 2010, Jackson addressed a claim by businessman Raghuveer Nayak to the FBI that Jackson purchased plane tickets for a woman Nayak identified as a &quot;social acquaintance&quot; of Jackson, &quot;The reference to a social acquaintance is a private and personal matter between me and my wife that was handled some time ago,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;I ask that you respect our privacy.&quot;

In September 2010, fundraiser Nayak was mentioned in the press as having been an alleged go between for Jackson and Blagojevich with the message that Jackson would help Blagojevich raise $6 million in exchange for the Senate appointment. The allegations became the subject of a Congressional ethics investigation.

==Author==
In December 1999, he co-authored &quot;It&#x27;s About the Money: How You Can Get Out of Debt, Build Wealth, and Achieve Your Financial Dreams&quot;. The book is a self-help book with directions for achieving personal financial independence. The book is targeted toward people of limited means. In the fall of 2001, he co-authored &quot;Legal Lynching: The Death Penalty and America&#x27;s Future&quot;, also known as &quot;Legal Lynching II&quot;. With coauthors, Rev. Jesse Jackson, Jackson Jr., and Bruce Shapiro, the anti-death penalty voice was heard very publicly. The book was published, at a time when public opposition to the death penalty was at a historically high level, by two of America&#x27;s most prominent civil rights leaders. It was a follow-up to &quot;Legal Lynching: Racism, Injustice and the Death Penalty&quot;, which was released in 1996 by Jackson Sr. In 2001, Jackson Jr. authored &quot;A More Perfect Union: Advancing New American Rights&quot;, with his press secretary, Frank Watkins. The book outlines his moral and political philosophies, and it provides an autobiographical sketch. It provides analysis on the link between race and economics from colonial America to the present with a vision for the future. In addition to the analysis, it provides eight proposed constitutional amendments that Jackson sees as essential to pursuit of broader social and economic opportunity. Since the publication of this book, Jackson has refined these and formally proposed these constitutional amendments.

==Personal life==

During the 1988 presidential campaign, Jackson met his future wife, Sandi Stevens, who was press secretary for United States Congressman Mickey Leland. After her first year at Georgetown University Law Center, the couple decided public higher education was more affordable and jointly enrolled at the University of Illinois College of Law. While still law students, they married on June 1, 1991. Jackson and Sandi have two children, Jesse III (&quot;Tre&quot;) and Jessica and keep two homes. They own one in the South Shore community area, which is within both the 2nd district that Congressman Jackson represented in the United States House of Representatives and within the seventh ward that his wife represented on the Chicago City Council as Alderman. The South Shore home serves as an election base for himself and candidates he has supported, for which he claims a 13–0 record in public elections. The South Shore home was the featured renovation on an HGTV &quot;Hidden Potential&quot; episode, first aired on March 24, 2009. The Jacksons also own a home in Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C., which served as the family home and base for his service in Congress.

Jackson&#x27;s earliest public controversy came when he was linked to alleged Nigerian drug trafficker Pius Ailemen. Ailemen was supposed to be Jackson&#x27;s best man at his 1991 wedding, but canceled at the last minute due to supposed passport-related issues. Jackson and Aileman were investigated by the FBI; the investigation and court proceedings extended for several years. A wiretap recorded many conversations between the two, and financial records indicate that Ailemen had purchased an Alfa Romeo using a $13,000 charge on Jackson&#x27;s credit card. Ailemen was sentenced to 24 years and four months in jail. In 2003, Ailemen was denied petition for a writ of certiorari. Ailemen&#x27;s current motion questions Jackson&#x27;s activities as a government informant at the time of his testimony in Ailemen&#x27;s trial.

Jackson acknowledges that he has had the benefits of privilege and opportunity and says that his hobbies include fencing, hunting and fishing, especially salmon fishing. He often enjoys these hobbies in bipartisan friendships that include Dick Armey and regarded the late Republican Rep. Henry Hyde as one of his closest friends. In fact, Armey points to Jackson as an example of his ability to work with politicians at all ends of the political spectrum. Jackson also has a very good relationship with Republican United States President George W. Bush despite their sharp ideological differences. The relationship traces back to when Jackson Sr. and United States President-Elect George H. W. Bush met to discuss a range of issues while Jackson Jr. and his siblings Santita and Jonathan had an hour-and-a-half luncheon with future President George W. He also developed a relationship with Bill and Hillary Clinton that enabled him to watch Super Bowl XXXIII at Camp David with them.

In March 2005, Jackson revealed that he had lost due to bariatric surgery. In &quot;Ebony&quot;, Joe Madison revealed that when he and Jackson were on a panel at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation conference he asked Jackson why he looked so different. He stated that Jackson described having undergone a duodenal switch medical procedure that his sister, Santita, had used to lose over several years.

Jackson is a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. In 2006, when Jackson became a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity, Nu Pi chapter, the Illinois House of Representatives issued a congratulatory resolution to his father. Jesse Sr. is also a member of the Omega fraternity. Jackson Jr. delivered the keynote address to the fraternity at the November 18, 2006 Founder&#x27;s Day gathering. He is also affiliated with the Theta Epsilon chapter.

Jackson is a martial arts enthusiast who practices kung fu, tae kwon do, and karate. On August 1, 2007, Jackson got into a verbal disagreement with Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska on the House floor. Jackson stated in floor debate that &quot;Republicans can&#x27;t be trusted&quot; and Terry responded with &quot;shut up&quot; before approaching Jackson. Jackson then spoke profanities and challenged Terry to step outside, presumably for a physical fight. Steve Rothman helped avoid escalation to actual physical confrontation. Martial artists throughout the Omaha, Nebraska area (Terry&#x27;s district) called to inquire about Jackson&#x27;s mindset and intentions. Jackson says Terry was the instigator. Terry says Jackson was at fault, but the two shook hands the next day and agreed to move forward in the interest of their constituents. However, a week later an unidentified man who claimed to be a Jackson relative walked into Terry&#x27;s Omaha office saying he was Jackson&#x27;s hitman who had come to beat up Terry, which led to FBI involvement.

He used a battery-powered, GPS-equipped Segway in Washington. Jackson, who missed two votes in his first thirteen years in Congress, quipped that the Segway helped him to maintain his good voting record.

On July 12, 2012, Jackson&#x27;s office acknowledged that he had been absent from Congress since June 10, stating that he was receiving &quot;intensive medical treatment at a residential treatment facility for a mood disorder.&quot; After weeks of the public&#x27;s not knowing where the Congressman was, his office announced on July 27, 2012, that he was at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, undergoing an extensive inpatient evaluation for depression and for gastrointestinal issues. On August 13, 2012 the Mayo Clinic released a statement that Jackson was being treated for bipolar II disorder.

On July 14, 2016, Jackson filed for divorce from his wife in Cook County, Illinois. They reached a settlement in April 2018.

<text>The Blue Grotto () is a sea cave on the coast of the island of Capri, southern Italy. Sunlight shining through an underwater cavity is reflected back upward through the seawater below the cavern, giving the water a blue glow that illuminates the cavern. The cave extends some into the cliff at the surface, and is about deep, with a sandy bottom.

== Access ==
The cave is long and wide. The entry is wide and roughly high at low tide, making safe access possible only when tides are low and the sea is calm. To enter the grotto, visitors must lie flat on the bottom of a small four-person rowboat. The oarsman then uses a metal chain attached to the cave walls to guide the boat inside the grotto. 

In 2011 a visitor suffered a life-altering injury when his neck was broken while entering the cave. The Cooperativa Battellieri Grotta Azzurra initially denied liability but settled a damages claim. It was concluded that the boatmen had continued entering the cave when the sea conditions were inappropriate. Swimming in the grotto is forbidden.

== Color ==

The Blue Grotto is one of several sea caves worldwide that is flooded with a brilliant blue or emerald light. The quality and nature of the color in each is determined by its unique combination of depth, breadth, water clarity, and light source.

In the case of the Blue Grotto, the light comes from two sources: the narrow arched entranceway, and a large hole somewhere below the above water entrance, separated by a band of rock between one and two meters tall. Because it is farther from the surface much less light passes through the lower opening, but its depth and size allow it to be the grotto water&#x27;s primary source of illumination.

As light passes through the water into the cave, red reflections are filtered out and only blue light enters the cave. Objects placed in the water of the grotto famously appear silver. This is caused by tiny bubbles, which cover the outside of the object when they are placed underwater. The bubbles cause the light to refract differently than it does from the surrounding water and gives off the silver effect.

In part because of the dazzling effect of the light from the above-water opening, it is impossible for a visitor who is in one of the rowboats to identify the shape of the larger hole, the outline of the bar that separates the two holes, or the nature of the light source, other than a general awareness that the light is coming up from underneath, and that the water in the cave is more light-filled than the air. A visitor who places a hand in the water can see it &quot;glow&quot; eerily in this light.

The island of Capri gives its name to the color Capri because of the color&#x27;s resemblance to the bright blue color of the waters of the Blue Grotto.

==History==
During Roman times, the grotto was used as the personal swimming hole of Emperor Tiberius as well as a marine temple. Tiberius moved from the Roman capital to the island of Capri in 27 AD. During Tiberius&#x27; reign, the grotto was decorated with several statues as well as resting areas around the edge of the cave. Three statues of the Roman sea gods Neptune and Triton were recovered from the floor of the grotto in 1964 and are now on display at a museum in Anacapri. Seven bases of statues were also recovered from the grotto floor in 2009. This suggests that there are at least four more statues lying on the cave&#x27;s bottom. The cave was described by the Roman historian Pliny the Elder as being populated with Triton &quot;playing on a shell&quot;. The now-missing arms on the recovered Triton statue—usually depicted with a conch shell—suggest that the statues recovered in 1964 are the same statues Pliny the Elder saw in the 1st century AD. According to a reconstruction of how the Blue Grotto may have looked in Roman times, a swarm of Triton statues headed by a Neptune statue may have stood in the walls of the cave. The Marevivo association aims to construct this by placing statues in the grotto. This project is being carried out in collaboration with the archaeological superintendence of Pompeii.

At the back of the main cave of the Blue Grotto, three connecting passageways lead to the Sala dei Nomi, or &quot;Room of Names&quot;, named for the graffiti signatures left by visitors over the centuries. Two more passages lead deeper into the cliffs on the side of island. It was thought that these passages were ancient stairways that led to Emperor Tiberius&#x27; palace. However, the passages are natural ones that narrow and then end further along.

During the 18th century, the grotto was known to the locals as &quot;Gradola&quot;, after the nearby landing place of Gradola. It was avoided by sailors and islanders because it was said to be inhabited by witches and monsters. The grotto was then &quot;rediscovered&quot; by the public in 1826, with the visit of German writer August Kopisch and his friend Ernst Fries, who were taken to the grotto by local fisherman Angelo Ferraro.

==The legend of the blue Grotto==
The cave as in every medieval history was said to be a refuge for devils and monsters. Two priests determined to drive them away entered the cave swimming, after a few minutes spent inside it they ran away in panic as if they had seen the face of the devil. From that moment on, the two began to rant. Named the cursed cave, it preserves numerous legends .

==Cultural influence==
In 1826, German writer August Kopisch and his friend Ernst Fries, a German painter, visited the cave and recorded their visit in the Kopisch&#x27;s &quot;Entdeckung der blauen Grotte auf der Insel Capri&quot; in 1838.

In 1842 Danish choreographer August Bournonville set the second act of his ballet &quot;Napoli&quot; in the Blue Grotto. In this fantastic tale, Golfo, the demon who rules the Blue Grotto, transforms the ballet&#x27;s heroine, Teresina, into a Naiad.

Mark Twain visited the Blue Grotto in 1867 and recorded his thoughts in his book &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot;.

Uranian poet Edwin Emmanuel Bradford recorded his impression of a bathing boy in the Blue Grotto in the poem &quot;In Quest of Love&quot;, included in &quot;In Quest of Love and Other Poems&quot; (1914), and again in &quot;The Bather in the Blue Grotto at Capri&quot;, included in &quot;The New Chivalry and Other Poems&quot; (1918) and reprinted in &quot;To Boys Unknown&quot; (1988). Both poems were anthologised in &quot;Lad&#x27;s Love: An anthology of Uranian poetry and prose&quot; (2010).

The grotto is highlighted in the 1953 Newbery Honor book &quot;Red Sails to Capri&quot; by Ann Weil. 

In Alberto Moravia&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;Il disprezzo&quot; (Contempt), a vision appears to the protagonist when, under heavy mental stress, he visits the cave alone.

<text>Minsk region, also known as Minsk oblast or Minsk voblasts, is one of the six regions of Belarus. Its administrative center is Minsk, although it is a separate administrative territorial entity of Belarus. The region&#x27;s population was recorded at 1,411,500 in 2011.

==Geography==
Minsk region covers a total area of , about 19.44% of the total area of the entire country. Lake Narach, the largest lake in the country, is located in the northern part of the region. There are four other large lakes in this region: Svir (8th largest), Myadel (11th largest), Syalyava (14th largest) and Myastro (15th largest). It is the only region of Belarus whose border is not part of the international border of Belarus.

==History==
Beginning the 10th century, the territory of the current Minsk region was part of Kievan Rus&#x27;, the Principality of Polotsk, and later it was included in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. With the unification of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, the territory became part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In 1793, as a result of the Second Partition of Poland, the area was annexed by Russia as the Minsk region. During the collapse of the Russian Empire due to the Civil War, the western part was annexed to Poland in 1921, while the east became Soviet Belarus. The Polish National District with its capital in Dzyarzhynsk was located in the Soviet-controlled part of the current oblast in the interwar period.

The Minsk region was established on 15 January 1938, based on the amendment of the Constitutional Law of the USSR. As of 20 February 1938, the area included 20 districts. Following the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, 1939 at the start of World War II, the former eastern lands of the Second Polish Republic were annexed in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact partitioning Poland and added to the Minsk region.

On 20 September 1944, by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Gressky, Kopyl, Krasnoslobodski, Luban, Slutsky, Starobin, Starodorozhski districts and the city of Sluck were removed from the Minsk region and transferred to the newly formed Bobruisk region.

On 8 January 1954, by the decree of the USSR Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the Nesvizhski and Stolbtsovsky districts from the abolished Baranovichi region, as well as the Glusk, Gressky, Kopyl, Krasnoslobodski, Luban, Slutsky, Starobin, Starodorozhski districts and the city of Sluck from the abolished Bobruisk region, were added to the Minsk region.

In 1960, following the abolition of Molodechno region, its southern part became the northern part of the Minsk region.

==Tourism==

<doc id="411914" wikidata="Q1751597" url="?curid=411914" title="Oophorectomy">
<text>Oophorectomy (; from Greek , , &#x27;egg-bearing&#x27; and , , &#x27;a cutting out of&#x27;), historically also called &quot;ovariotomy&quot;, is the surgical removal of an ovary or ovaries. The surgery is also called ovariectomy, but this term is mostly used in reference to non-human animals, e.g. the surgical removal of ovaries from laboratory animals. Removal of the ovaries of females is the biological equivalent of castration of males; the term &quot;castration&quot; is only occasionally used in the medical literature to refer to oophorectomy of women. In veterinary medicine, the removal of ovaries and uterus is called ovariohysterectomy (spaying) and is a form of sterilization.

The first reported successful human oophorectomy was carried out by (Sir) Sydney Jones at Sydney Infirmary, Australia, in 1870.

Partial oophorectomy or ovariotomy is a term sometimes used to describe a variety of surgeries such as ovarian cyst removal, or resection of parts of the ovaries. This kind of surgery is fertility-preserving, although ovarian failure may be relatively frequent. Most of the long-term risks and consequences of oophorectomy are not or only partially present with partial oophorectomy.

In humans, oophorectomy is most often performed because of diseases such as ovarian cysts or cancer; as prophylaxis to reduce the chances of developing ovarian cancer or breast cancer; or in conjunction with hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). In the 1890s people believed oophorectomies could cure menstrual cramps, back pain, headaches, and chronic coughing, although no evidence existed that the procedure impacted any of these ailments.

The removal of an ovary together with the fallopian tube is called salpingo-oophorectomy or unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (USO). When both ovaries and both fallopian tubes are removed, the term bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is used. Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy are not common forms of birth control in humans; more usual is tubal ligation, in which the fallopian tubes are blocked but the ovaries remain intact. In many cases, surgical removal of the ovaries is performed concurrently with a hysterectomy. The formal medical name for removal of a woman&#x27;s entire reproductive system (ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus) is &quot;total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy&quot; (TAH-BSO); the more casual term for such a surgery is &quot;ovariohysterectomy&quot;. &quot;Hysterectomy&quot; is removal of the uterus (from the Greek ὑστέρα hystera &quot;womb&quot; and εκτομία ektomia &quot;a cutting out of&quot;) without removal of the ovaries or fallopian tubes.

Oophorectomy is used as part of castration to punish some female sex offenders.

==Technique==
Oophorectomy for benign causes is most often performed by abdominal laparoscopy. Abdominal laparotomy or robotic surgery is used in complicated cases or when a malignancy is suspected.

==Statistics==
According to the Centers for Disease Control, 454,000 women in the United States underwent oophorectomy in 2004. The first successful operation of this type, account of which was published in the &quot;Eclectic Repertory and Analytic Review&quot; (Philadelphia) in 1817, was performed by Ephraim McDowell (1771–1830), a surgeon from Danville, Kentucky. McDowell was dubbed as the &quot;father of ovariotomy&quot;. It later became known as Battey&#x27;s Operation, after Robert Battey, a surgeon from Augusta, Georgia, who championed the procedure for a variety of conditions, most successfully for ovarian epilepsy.

==Indication==
Most bilateral oophorectomies (63%) are performed without any medical indication, and most (87%) are performed together with a hysterectomy. Conversely, unilateral oophorectomy is commonly performed for a medical indication (73%; cyst, endometriosis, benign tumor, inflammation, etc.) and less commonly in conjunction with hysterectomy (61%).

Special indications include several groups of women with substantially increased risk of ovarian cancer, such as high-risk BRCA mutation carriers and women with endometriosis who also have frequent ovarian cysts.

Bilateral oophorectomy has been traditionally done in the belief that the benefit of preventing ovarian cancer would outweigh the risks associated with removal of ovaries. However, it is now clear that prophylactic oophorectomy without a reasonable medical indication decreases long-term survival rates substantially and has deleterious long-term effects on health and well-being even in post-menopausal women. The procedure has been postulated as a possible treatment method for female sex offenders.

The procedure is sometimes performed at the same time as hysterectomy in transgender men and non-binary people. The long term effects of oophorectomy in this population are not well studied.

===Cancer prevention===

Oophorectomy can significantly improve survival for women with high-risk BRCA mutations, for whom prophylactic oophorectomy around age 40 reduces the risk of ovarian and breast cancer and provides significant and substantial long-term survival advantage. On average, earlier intervention does not provide any additional benefit but increases risks and adverse effects.

For women with high-risk BRCA2 mutations, oophorectomy around age 40 has a relatively modest benefit for survival; the positive effect of reduced breast and ovarian cancer risk is nearly balanced by adverse effects. The survival advantage is more substantial when oophorectomy is performed together with prophylactic mastectomy.

The risks and benefits associated with oophorectomy in the BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population are different than those for the general population. Prophylactic risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is an important option for the high-risk population to consider. Women with BRCA1/2 mutations who undergo salpingo-oophorectomy have lower all-cause mortality rates than women in the same population who do not undergo this procedure. In addition, RRSO has been shown to decrease mortality specific to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Women who undergo RRSO are also at a lower risk for developing ovarian cancer and first occurrence breast cancer. Specifically, RRSO provides BRCA1 mutation carriers with no prior breast cancer a 70% reduction of ovarian cancer risk. BRCA1 mutation carriers with prior breast cancer can benefit from an 85% reduction. High-risk women who have not had prior breast cancer can benefit from a 37% (BRCA1 mutation) and 64% (BRCA2 mutation) reduction of breast cancer risk. These benefits are important to highlight, as they are unique to this BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population.

===Endometriosis===
In rare cases, oophorectomy can be used to treat endometriosis by eliminating the menstrual cycle, which will reduce or eliminate the spread of existing endometriosis as well as reducing pain. Since endometriosis results from an overgrowth of the uterine lining, removal of the ovaries as a treatment for endometriosis is often done in conjunction with a hysterectomy to further reduce or eliminate recurrence.

Oophorectomy for endometriosis is used only as last resort, often in conjunction with a hysterectomy, as it has severe side effects for women of reproductive age. However, it has a higher success rate than retaining the ovaries.

Partial oophorectomy (i.e., ovarian cyst removal not involving total oophorectomy) is often used to treat milder cases of endometriosis when non-surgical hormonal treatments fail to stop cyst formation. Removal of ovarian cysts through partial oophorectomy is also used to treat extreme pelvic pain from chronic hormonal-related pelvic problems.

==Risks and adverse effects==

===Surgical risks===
Oophorectomy is an intra-abdominal surgery and serious complications stemming directly from the surgery are rare. When performed together with hysterectomy, it has influence on choice of surgical technique as the combined surgery is much less likely to be performed by vaginal hysterectomy.

Laparotomic adnexal surgeries are associated with a high rate of adhesive small bowel obstructions (24%).

An infrequent complication is injuring of the ureter at the level of the suspensory ligament of the ovary.

===Long-term effects===
Oophorectomy has serious long-term consequences stemming mostly from the hormonal effects of the surgery and extending well beyond menopause. The reported risks and adverse effects include premature death, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment or dementia, parkinsonism, osteoporosis and bone fractures, decline in psychological well-being, and decline in sexual function. Hormone replacement therapy does not always reduce the adverse effects.

===Mortality===
Oophorectomy is associated with significantly increased all-cause long-term mortality except when performed for cancer prevention in carriers of high-risk BRCA mutations. This effect is particularly pronounced for women who undergo oophorectomy before age 45.

The effect is not limited to women who have oophorectomy performed before menopause; an impact on survival is expected even for surgeries performed up to the age of 65. Surgery at age 50-54 reduces the probability of survival until age 80 by 8% (from 62% to 54% survival), surgery at age 55-59 by 4%. Most of this effect is due to excess cardiovascular risk and hip fractures.

Removal of ovaries causes hormonal changes and symptoms similar to, but generally more severe than, menopause. Women who have had an oophorectomy are usually encouraged to take hormone replacement drugs to prevent other conditions often associated with menopause. Women younger than 45 who have had their ovaries removed with prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy face a mortality risk 170% higher than women who have retained their ovaries. Retaining the ovaries when a hysterectomy is performed is associated with better long-term survival. Hormone therapy for women with oophorectomies performed before age 45 improves the long-term outcome and all-cause mortality rates.

===Menopausal effects===
Women who have had bilateral oophorectomy surgeries lose most of their ability to produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone, and lose about half of their ability to produce testosterone, and subsequently enter what is known as &quot;surgical menopause&quot; (as opposed to normal menopause, which occurs naturally in women as part of the aging process). In natural menopause the ovaries generally continue to produce low levels of hormones, especially androgens, long after menopause, which may explain why surgical menopause is generally accompanied by a more sudden and severe onset of symptoms than natural menopause, symptoms that may continue until the natural age of menopause. These symptoms are commonly addressed through hormone therapy, utilizing various forms of estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, or a combination.

===Cardiovascular risk===
When the ovaries are removed, a woman is at a seven times greater risk of cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms are not precisely known. The hormone production of the ovaries currently cannot be sufficiently mimicked by drug therapy. The ovaries produce hormones a woman needs throughout her entire life, in the quantity they are needed, at the time they are needed, in response to and as part of the complex endocrine system.

===Osteoporosis===
Oophorectomy is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures. A potential risk for oophorectomy performed after menopause is not fully elucidated. Reduced levels of testosterone in women is predictive of height loss, which may occur as a result of reduced bone density. In women under the age of 50 who have undergone oophorectomy, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is often used to offset the negative effects of sudden hormonal loss such as early-onset osteoporosis as well as menopausal problems like hot flashes that are usually more severe than those experienced by women undergoing natural menopause.

===Adverse effect on sexuality===
Oophorectomy substantially impairs sexuality. Substantially more women who had both an oophorectomy and a hysterectomy reported libido loss, difficulty with sexual arousal, and vaginal dryness than those who had a less invasive procedure (either hysterectomy alone or an alternative procedure), and hormone replacement therapy was not found to improve these symptoms. In addition, oophorectomy greatly reduces testosterone levels, which are associated with a greater sense of sexual desire in women. However, at least one study has shown that psychological factors, such as relationship satisfaction, are still the best predictor of sexual activity following oophorectomy. Sexual intercourse remains possible after oophorectomy and coitus can continue. Reconstructive surgery remains an option for women who have experienced benign and malignant conditions. 

===Effect on fertility===
==Managing side effects of prophylactic oophorectomy==

===Non-hormonal treatments===

The side effects of oophorectomy may be alleviated by medicines other than hormonal replacement. Non-hormonal biphosphonates (such as Fosamax and Actonel) increase bone strength and are available as once-a-week pills. Low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as Paxil and Prozac alleviate vasomotor menopausal symptoms, i.e., &quot;hot flashes&quot;.

===Hormonal treatments===
In general, hormone replacement therapy is somewhat controversial due to the known carcinogenic and thrombogenic properties of estrogen; however, many physicians and patients feel the benefits outweigh the risks in women who may face serious health and quality-of-life issues as a consequence of early surgical menopause. The ovarian hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are involved in the regulation of hundreds of bodily functions; it is believed by some doctors that hormone therapy programs mitigate surgical menopause side effects such as increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and female sexual dysfunction.

Short-term hormone replacement with estrogen has negligible effect on overall mortality for high-risk BRCA mutation carriers. Based on computer simulations, overall mortality appears to be marginally higher for short-term HRT after oophorectomy or marginally lower for short-term HRT after oophorectomy in combination with mastectomy. This result can probably be generalized to other women at high risk in whom short-term (i.e., one- or two-year) treatment with estrogen for hot flashes may be acceptable.

<text>The Gizmos were an American punk band formed in Bloomington, Indiana, United States, in 1976. The original band was made up of Ken Highland, Eddie Flowers, Ted Niemiec and the members of a group called Cerberus; Rich Coffee, Dave Sulak, Rick Czajka, and Jim DeVries. The Gizmos released three 7-inch EPs on Gulcher Records in 1976, 1977, and 1978.

In late 1977 the band broke up. Then, Ted Niemiec recruited new members to form a new version of the Gizmos. This version of the band released one EP, &quot;Never Mind The Sex Pistols Here&#x27;s The Gizmos&quot;.

After Niemiec left the band, new member Dale Lawrence carried on using the band name with new members.

==After the Gizmos==
Ken Highland later relocated to Boston, Massachusetts, where he has been in a long string of garage-oriented bands over the years, including Club Linehan a Go-Go, the Hopelessly Obscure, Johnny &amp; the Jumper Cables, the Kenne Highland Clan, the Goody Goody Gumdrops, and the Vatican Sex Kittens.

Eddie Flowers and Rich Coffee moved to Los Angeles in the late 1970s and become active in the underground rock scene there. Flowers started Crawlspace with members of the Lazy Cowgirls in 1985. Coffee sang and played in Thee Fourgiven and the Tommyknockers, influenced by late 1960s pre-punk hard rock bands like the MC5 and the Doors as well as more recent acts like the Cramps, the Gun Club, and Billy Childish. The bands of both Coffee and Flowers were associated with the Sympathy for the Record Industry record label.

<text>The Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum (REM) is devoted to ancient Egypt, located at Rosicrucian Park in the Rose Garden neighborhood of San Jose, California, United States.

It was founded by the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC). The Rosicrucian order continues to support and expand the museum and its educational and scientific activities. The museum holds the largest collection of ancient Egyptian antiquities in the Western United States, and is located next to the AMORC headquarters.

==History==

The founder of AMORC, Harvey Spencer Lewis, was a collector of various artifacts with mystical symbolism, some of them from the East. His very first artifact was a small Sekhmet statue. In 1921 he contributed financially to the archaeological excavations at Tel el Amarna (Akhetaten, the capital city of the 18th dynasty pharaoh Akhenaten) of the Egypt Explorations Society of Boston by receiving donations from AMORC members. In return, the Egypt Explorations Society donated several Egyptian antiquities to AMORC.

In 1928, he presented to the public a collection named &quot;The Rosicrucian Egyptian Oriental Museum&quot;, located at the administration buildings of AMORC at San Jose, California. Supposedly, the San Jose location was chosen because of the affordability of the land back then. After Lewis&#x27; tour in Egypt in 1929, AMORC received many more artifacts and donations, and as a result the collection grew significantly, with more than 2000 exhibits.

The second Imperator of AMORC, Ralph Maxwell Lewis, son of H. Spencer Lewis, built new buildings for the museum, which opened in November 1966.

By that time the museum was unique in:
* Having the largest exhibition of Ancient Egyptian antiquities in the Western US.
* Being the only such museum in the world with buildings constructed in Ancient Egyptian architectural style.
* Having a purpose-built planetarium adjacent to the museum, the fifth opened in the United States, and the first with a Star Projector built in the country, constructed by H. Spencer Lewis.
* Having its buildings set in an Egyptian Revival park.

In 1995, Julie Scott, M.A., S.R.C., who is a practicing Rosicrucian, became director of the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum.

In 2017, the museum was claiming 110,000 visitors per year, including 26,000 sixth-graders. The building is also used by the Rosicrucians for meditation and group discussions. In 2018, the museum became a zero-energy building.

==Notable exhibits==

A notable activity took place in 1999 when the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum started the traveling exhibition &quot;Women of the Nile&quot; accompanied by many lectures. &quot;Women of the Nile&quot; travelled across the United States of America and Canada, and continued until 2001. In 2000–2002, a stone figure of Cleopatra VII from the collection was displayed in Rome, London, and Chicago in similar exhibitions.

The Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum&#x27;s child mummy traveled to Stanford University in nearby Palo Alto on May 6, 2005, to be studied under CT scans and other high-resolution methods of remote sensing, in a collaboration between the museum, Silicon Graphics, and Stanford University Hospital and the NASA Biocomputational Lab. The results were released at the 75th Anniversary of the Museum on August 6, 2005, with detailed scans. One of the scanning images won the Science and Engineering Visualization Challenge 2006 co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation and &quot;Science&quot;. In November 2017, x-ray images of the mummy were released that provide a 3D visualization of the girl&#x27;s remains.

A statue of Taweret, the ancient Egyptian hippopotamus-like goddess of pregnant women and childbirth, once stood at the entrance, but has been moved to the side. Since 2004, the Museum has been completely renovated, with the following Gallery themes:
*Afterlife and Rock Cut Tomb
*Daily Life and Other Cultures
*Kingship and Palace
*Temple (Sekhmet) and Akhenaten&#x27;s Amarna period
*Rotating Exhibits: Since 2015: The Rosicrucian Alchemy Exhibit
The museum also holds a 1.5 million-year-old stone hand ax, but it is not exhibited to the public.

===Rock-cut tomb replica===

The Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum contains a composite replica of an ancient Egyptian rock-cut tomb, based on photos and sketches taken by Rosicrucian expeditions to tombs at Beni Hasan, in order to give the guests the experience of being in such an excavation. Below are photographs of the interior of the replica tomb, largely containing scenes from the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;. The dark interior of the tomb replica is evident.

=== The Rosicrucian Alchemy Exhibit ===
Beginning in 2015, for the 100th Anniversary of the incorporation of AMORC in America, which owns and operates the Museum, the museum&#x27;s Rotating Exhibits Gallery became The Rosicrucian Alchemy Exhibit. The highlights of the collection were put on display in this exhibit.

This exhibit, curated by the alchemist Dennis William Hauck, features a journey through the seven stages of the alchemical process, a meditation chamber featuring the Azoth of the Philosophers and a recorded guided meditation, and a full-size reproduction of an alchemist’s workshop. There is also a reproduction of the Ripley Scroll with illustrative commentary.

The Exhibit forms the kernel of what will be the first alchemy museum in the United States, and the largest in the world. It will be housed in the present &quot;Rose-Croix University International&quot; building at Rosicrucian Park. The RCUI Building also contains a working alchemy lab.

On June 22, 2024, the museum unveiled the Thoth AI, a fully integrated artificial intelligence persona modeled after the ancient Egyptian god Thoth. This innovative addition enhances the educational experience by providing interactive guidance and insights, bridging ancient wisdom with modern technology.

<text>Konrad Paul Kujau (27 June 1938 – 12 September 2000) was a German illustrator and forger. He became famous in 1983 as the creator of the so-called Hitler Diaries, for which he received DM 2.5 million (€2,421,020 in 2020 terms, adjusted for inflation) from a journalist, Gerd Heidemann, who in turn sold it for DM 9.3 million to the magazine &quot;Stern,&quot; resulting in a net profit of DM 6.8 million (€6,585,174 in 2020 terms, adjusted for inflation) for Heidemann. The forgery resulted in a four-and-half-year prison sentence for Kujau.

==Biography==
===Early life===
&quot;Konny&quot; Kujau was born in Löbau, Nazi Germany, one of six children of Richard Kujau, a cobbler, and his wife, both of whom had joined the Nazi Party in 1933.
Kujau&#x27;s early life was of unremitting poverty and his mother was obliged to send her children into orphanages for periods of time. The boy grew up believing in the Nazi ideals and idolising Adolf Hitler; the defeat by the Allies in 1945, and Hitler&#x27;s suicide, did not temper his enthusiasm for the Nazi cause. He held a series of menial jobs until 1957, when he was working as a waiter at the Löbau Youth Club, and a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with the theft of a microphone. In June he fled to Stuttgart, West Germany, where he soon drifted into temporary menial work and petty crime. 

In 1959 he was fined 80 Marks (DM) for stealing tobacco; in 1960 he was sent to prison for nine months after being caught breaking into a storeroom to steal cognac; in 1961 he spent more time in prison after stealing five crates of fruit. Six months later he was arrested after getting into a fight with his employer while working as a cook in a bar.

In 1961, he began a relationship with Edith Lieblang, one of the waitresses at the bar where he was working. The couple moved to Plochingen and opened a dance bar, which was a modest success. Kujau began to create a fictional background for himself, telling people his real name was Peter Fischer, changing his date of birth by two years, and altering the history of his time in East Germany. By 1963, the bar began suffering financial difficulties and the couple moved back to Stuttgart, where Kujau found work as a waiter. He also started his career as a counterfeiter, forging DM 27 worth of luncheon vouchers; he was caught and sentenced to five days in prison. On his release he and his wife formed the Lieblang Cleaning Company, although the company provided little income for them. In March 1968, at a routine check at Kujau&#x27;s lodgings, the police established he was living under a false identity, after the name, address and date-of-birth details Kujau had provided to the police were different to those on the papers he was carrying at the time. At the police station he offered a third set of details, and a false explanation as to why he was masquerading under an assumed identity, but the subsequent fingerprint check confirmed he was Kujau. He was sent to Stuttgart&#x27;s Stammheim Prison.

After his release in the late 1960s, the cleaning business became profitable enough for the couple to buy a flat in Schmieden, near Stuttgart. In 1970, Kujau visited his family in East Germany and found out that many of the locals held Nazi memorabilia, contrary to the laws of the Communist government. Kujau saw an opportunity to buy the material cheaply on the black market and make a profit in the West, where there was an increasing demand for such items. Prices among Stuttgart collectors were up to ten times the prices paid by Kujau. The trade was illegal in East Germany, and the export of what were deemed items of cultural heritage was banned. Both the Kujaus were stopped, although only once each, and their penalty was the confiscation of the contraband.

Among the items smuggled out of East Germany were weapons, and Kujau would occasionally wear a pistol, sometimes firing it in a nearby field, or shooting empty bottles in his local bar. One night in February 1973, while drunk, he took a loaded machine gun to confront a man he thought had been slashing the tyres of his cleaning company van. The man ran off and Kujau chased him into the wrong doorway, terrifying a prostitute. Her screams brought the police who arrested Kujau. When they searched his flat they found five pistols, a machine gun, a shotgun and three rifles. Kujau apologised and was given a fine.

In 1974, he rented a shop into which he placed his Nazi memorabilia. The outlet also became the venue for late-night drinking sessions with friends and fellow collectors, including Wolfgang Schulze, a resident of the US, who became Kujau&#x27;s American agent. Kujau soon began to raise the value of items in his shop by forging additional authentication details, including for a genuine First World War helmet, worth a few marks, for which Kujau forged a note saying it had been Hitler&#x27;s, worn in Ypres in late October 1914, thereby radically raising its value. In addition to notes by Hitler, he produced documents in the handwriting of Martin Bormann, Rudolf Hess, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Göring and Joseph Goebbels. Although the handwriting was a passable imitation of the owners, the rest of the work was crude: Kujau used modern stationery, which he aged with tea, and created letterheads by using Letraset. In many cases the spelling and grammar was inaccurate, particularly when he forged documents in English, such as a copy of the Munich Agreement between Hitler and Neville Chamberlain, which he transcribed as:

&quot;We regard the areement signet last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another againe.&quot;

In the mid- to late-1970s Kujau, an able amateur artist, turned to producing paintings which he claimed were by Hitler, who had himself been an amateur artist in his younger days. Having found a market for his forged works, Kujau painted subjects his buyers professed an interest in, such as cartoons, nudes and men in action — subjects that Hitler never painted, nor would want to paint. Often these paintings were accompanied by small notes purportedly from Hitler but forged by Kujau. The paintings proved profitable for the forger. To explain his access to the memorabilia, he invented several sources in East Germany, including a former Nazi general, the director of a museum whom he had bribed, and his brother, a general in the East German army.

Having found success in passing off his forged notes as those of Hitler, Kujau grew more ambitious, and copied, by hand, the text from both volumes of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, even though the originals were completed by typewriter. Kujau also produced an introduction to a third volume of the work. He sold these &quot;manuscripts&quot; to one of his regular clients, Fritz Stiefel, a collector of Nazi memorabilia. Kujau also began forging a series of war poems by Hitler, which were so amateurish that Kujau later admitted that &quot;a fourteen-year-old collector would have recognized it as a forgery&quot;. When some of those poems were published in 1980, one historian pointed out that one of them could not have been produced by Hitler because it had been written by Herybert Menzel.

=== Hitler diaries ===

It is unclear when Kujau produced his first Hitler diary. Stiefel says Kujau gave him a diary on loan in 1975. Schulze puts the date in 1976, while Kujau says he began in 1978. He used one of a pile of notebooks he had bought cheaply in East Berlin, and mistakenly put the letters FH (instead of AH) in gold on the front; these letters were purchased in a department store and made of plastic in Hong Kong. To add a further look of authentication, he took the black ribbon from a real SS document, and attached it to the cover using a German army wax seal. For the ink he purchased two bottles of Pelikan ink, one black and one blue, and mixed the two together with water so it flowed more easily from the cheap modern pen he used. Kujau had spent a month practising to write in the old German gothic script in which Hitler used to write. Kujau showed it to Stiefel who was impressed by the work, and wanted to buy it, but when the forger refused to sell it, he asked to borrow it instead, which was agreed upon.

In 1978 Kujau sold his first &quot;Hitler Diary&quot; to a collector. In 1980 he was contacted by the journalist Gerd Heidemann who had learned of the diary. Kujau told Heidemann that the diaries were in the possession of his brother, who was a general in the East German Army. Heidemann made a deal with Kujau for &quot;the rest&quot; of the diaries. Over the next two years Kujau faked a further 61 volumes and sold them to Heidemann for DM 2.5 million. Heidemann in turn received DM 9 million from his employers at &quot;Stern&quot;. On their publication in 1983, the diaries were soon proved to be fabrications, and Heidemann and Kujau were arrested. In August 1984, Kujau was sentenced to four and a half years for forgery and Lieblang to one year as an accomplice. Heidemann was convicted of fraud and also received a four-and-half year prison sentence the following year.

On his release from prison after three years, Kujau became something of a minor celebrity, appearing on TV as a &quot;forgery expert&quot;, and set up a business selling &quot;genuine Kujau fakes&quot; in the style of various major artists. He stood for election as Mayor of Stuttgart in 1996, receiving 901 votes. Kujau died of cancer in 2000.

In 2006, someone claiming to be his grandniece, Petra Kujau, was charged with selling &quot;fake forgeries&quot;, cheap Asian-made copies of famous paintings with forged signatures of Konrad Kujau.

<doc id="411924" wikidata="Q809077" url="?curid=411924" title="Barry McGuire">
<text>Barry McGuire (born October 15, 1935) is an American singer-songwriter primarily known for his 1965 hit &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot;. He was later a singer and songwriter of contemporary Christian music.

==Early life==
McGuire was born in Oklahoma City; his family moved to California when he was two years old. After working as a commercial fisherman and a journeyman pipe fitter, McGuire began singing in a bar. In 1961 he released his first single, &quot;The Tree&quot;, which was not a hit.

McGuire formed a duo with Barry Kane (d.2013) called Barry &amp; Barry. They performed original folk songs at The Ice House, a small folk club in Pasadena, California, before moving to The Troubadour in Hollywood in the spring of 1962. There they joined the folk group the New Christy Minstrels and McGuire sang lead vocals on the novelty single &quot;Three Wheels on My Wagon&quot;.

McGuire and Kane continued to perform their duo act as well as playing with the New Christy Minstrels. With Horizon Records, they cut their first and only album as Barry &amp; Barry titled &quot;Here and Now&quot;, which contained songs such as &quot;Gold Wedding Ring&quot;, &quot;Land of Odin&quot;, &quot;Another Man&quot; (released as a single), &quot;Summer&#x27;s Over&quot;, &quot;You Know My Name&quot;, &quot;Bull &#x27;Gine Run&quot;, and &quot;Far Side of the Hill&quot;. It also included &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot;, three months after the release of the song by folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary.

In 1963 McGuire, with Randy Sparks (founder of the New Christy Minstrels), co-wrote and sang lead vocal on the band&#x27;s first and biggest hit single: &quot;Green, Green&quot;. McGuire left the Christys in January 1965 after recording the album &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot;, although on the 1965 album &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee&quot; he sang on the title cut.

==Solo career==
As a solo folk rock singer in the 1960s, McGuire was best known for his hit &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; and for &quot;Sins of a Family&quot;, both written by P. F. Sloan. McGuire&#x27;s other chart successes were &quot;Child of Our Times&quot; and &quot;Cloudy Summer Afternoon (Raindrops)&quot; (written by Travis Edmonson of the 1960s folk-duo Bud &amp; Travis). &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; sold more than one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. The album &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; peaked at No. 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart during the week ending September 25, 1965. That same week the single went to No. 1 on both the &quot;Cashbox&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and knocked &quot;Help!&quot; by the Beatles from the top of the chart. According to McGuire, &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; was recorded in one take on a Thursday morning from words scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper and he received a call from the record company at 7am the following Monday telling him to turn on the radio, his song was playing. The recording included an &quot;ahhh&quot; where McGuire could not read the words. &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; was McGuire&#x27;s only Top 40 entry. 

McGuire&#x27;s second album, &quot;This Precious Time,&quot; was released in February 1966 on Dunhill Records. The album included a version of &quot;California Dreamin with the Mamas &amp; the Papas singing backing vocals. McGuire is mentioned several times in the Mamas &amp; the Papas&#x27; hit song &quot;Creeque Alley&quot;. The Temptations referenced McGuire&#x27;s &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; in their song &quot;Ball of Confusion (That&#x27;s What the World Is Today)&quot;. Frank Zappa included McGuire&#x27;s name on the sleeve of his &quot;Freak Out!&quot; album (1966) as one of his musical influences.

McGuire appeared in the 1967 movie &quot;The President&#x27;s Analyst&quot; with James Coburn as the character &quot;Old Wrangler&quot;, the leader of a band which consisted of the Los Angeles group Clear Light, who were between lead vocalists; and in &quot;Werewolves on Wheels&quot; in 1971. In 1968 he starred for a year in the Broadway musical &quot;Hair&quot;.

McGuire became a born-again Christian in 1971 after meeting evangelist Arthur Blessitt in October 1970. In 1973, he joined the Myrrh label and released the album &quot;Seeds&quot;. This album contained backing vocals by the family trio that would become known as the 2nd Chapter of Acts. In 1974, McGuire released his second Jesus music album, &quot;Lighten Up&quot;, which included a remake of &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot;. He toured with 2nd Chapter of Acts and &quot;A Band Called David&quot;, and in 1975 this collaborative effort resulted in the double live album &quot;To the Bride&quot;.

In 1976, McGuire left Myrrh and joined former Myrrh executive Billy Ray Hearn&#x27;s new label, Sparrow Records. He recorded seven albums on Sparrow, the best known of which is &quot;Cosmic Cowboy&quot;, released in 1978. The title track was No. 1 on CCM Magazine&#x27;s music chart for 35 weeks. That year McGuire also released a children&#x27;s album, &quot;Bullfrogs and Butterflies&quot;, part of the Agapeland series, for Sparrow&#x27;s subsidiary label, Birdwing. In 1978, McGuire toured England, Scotland, and Wales with the Jimmy Owens&#x27; musical &quot;The Witness&quot;, in which he played the part of the apostle Peter. He also played this part on the studio recording of &quot;The Witness&quot;.

In 1985 McGuire was featured in the contemporary musical recording &quot;The Scroll&quot;, performing the character of Jesus. The musical was composed by Canadian singer/songwriter Bruce Stacey and was recorded in England with the National Philharmonic Orchestra. It also featured other contemporary Christian artists of the day. &quot;The Scroll&quot; was released on Light Records and was featured at three world exhibitions as a major multi-media presentation.

==Later life==
In the 1980s, after his final album &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, McGuire left the music industry and settled for a time in New Zealand with his wife, Mari. He wrote music, performed and hosted the videos for several years for Gospel Light Publishing&#x27;s Vacation Bible School Programs. McGuire returned to the United States in the 1990s and teamed up with Terry Talbot, recording as Talbot McGuire. The duo released four albums between 1996 and 2000. In 1990 McGuire published the novel &quot;In the Midst of Wolves&quot;, co-written with Logan White, which told the story of &quot;a group of bikers who came to know God&quot;. McGuire worked with The New Mamas and the Papas in 1997–1998. In 2000 he toured with Christian musician John Michael Talbot. In 2006, McGuire undertook engagements which included songs and talks on a mixture of topics by McGuire and his wife. The McGuires resided in Fresno, California, but also spent part of every year in New Zealand.

On March 12, 2008, McGuire appeared on the Australian music comedy/game show &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;, performing an updated version of &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; with new lines such as, &quot;You&#x27;re old enough to kill / you just started voting&quot; and &quot;... can live for ten years in space&quot;. A reference to &quot;Red China&quot; was also removed. In 2009, McGuire released &quot;Eve 2012&quot; in which the text was modified to reflect contemporary problems, mostly environmental, rather than the problems of the 1960s.

In 2008, McGuire joined a former member of the Byrds, John York, for a live tour called &quot;Trippin&#x27; the &#x27;60s&quot;, which McGuire described as &quot;taking the songs and the truth that was in those songs from the 1960s and bringing them into the present moment... It&#x27;s not a cover pack, it&#x27;s us singing songs that we sung with a lot of our friends that aren&#x27;t around anymore to sing them.&quot;

In 2013, McGuire appeared in the documentary film &#x27;The Byrd Who Flew Alone&#x27;, produced by Four Suns Productions. The film was about Gene Clark, one of the original Byrds, who was a friend of McGuire&#x27;s for many years.
